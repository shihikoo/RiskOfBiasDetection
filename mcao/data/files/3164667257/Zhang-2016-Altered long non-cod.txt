The brain endothelium is an important therapeutic target for the inhibition of cerebrovascular dysfunction in ischemic stroke. Previously, we documented the important regulatory roles of microRNAs in the cerebral vasculature, in particular the cerebral vascular endothelium. However, the functional signiﬁcance and molecular
mechanisms of other classes of non-coding RNAs in the regulation of cerebrovascular endothelial pathophysiology after stroke are completely unknown.
Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology, we proﬁled long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expressional signatures in primary brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) after oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD), an
in vitro mimic of ischemic stroke conditions. After 16 h of OGD exposure, the expression levels for 362 of the
10,677 lncRNAs analyzed changed signiﬁcantly, including a total of 147 lncRNAs increased and 70 lncRNAs decreased by more than 2-fold. Among them, the most highly upregulated lncRNAs include Snhg12, Malat1, and
lnc-OGD 1006, whereas the most highly downregulated lncRNAs include 281008D09Rik, Peg13, and lnc-OGD
3916. Alteration of the most highly upregulated/downregulated ODG-responsive lncRNAs was further conﬁrmed
in cultured BMECs after OGD as well as isolated cerebral microvessels in mice following transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) and 24 h reperfusion by the quantitative real-time PCR approach. Moreover, promoter
analysis of altered ODG-responsive endothelial lncRNA genes by bioinformatics showed substantial transcription
factor binding sites on lncRNAs, implying potential transcriptional regulation of those lncRNAs. These ﬁndings are
the ﬁrst to identify OGD-responsive brain endothelial lncRNAs, which suggest potential pathological roles for
these lncRNAs in mediating endothelial responses to ischemic stimuli. Endothelial-selective lncRNAs may function as a class of novel master regulators in cerebrovascular endothelial pathologies after ischemic stroke.

1. Introduction
Stroke is one of the severest health issues in the United States
(Moskowitz et al., 2010). Currently, thrombolytic therapy is not enough
for the acute intervention of ischemic stroke and only small percentage
of patients can receive it because of its narrow therapeutic time window
(Schellinger et al., 2004; Stapf and Mohr, 2002). Thus, development of
effective therapies is urgently required. During the past two decades,
extensive studies showing the effectiveness of neuroprotectants in animal stroke models, but not in stroke clinical trials, imply that solely focusing on neuroprotection is not sufﬁcient (Ginsberg, 2009; Iadecola

and Anrather, 2011). Thus, greater attention has been paid to the local
environment of the surviving neuron, such as the cerebral microvasculature, neurovascular units, and vascular neural network (Barone, 2009;
del Zoppo, 2006; Ginsberg, 2009; Lok et al., 2007; Yin et al., 2010a, 2011;
Yuan, 2009; Zhang et al., 2012). As a major structural and functional element of the brain microvasculature, the vascular endothelium plays a
dominant role in maintaining its normal physiological functions. There
is increasing evidence showing that ischemia-induced cerebral
endothelial injury, endothelial inﬂammation, and subsequent impairment of endothelial function increase cerebrovascular permeability
and BBB leakage, contributing to ischemic brain injury (del Zoppo and
Hallenbeck, 2000; Ishikawa et al., 2004; Sandoval and Witt, 2008).
Thus, it is important to identify the insightful mechanisms by which cerebrovascular disorders can be effectively inhibited or reduced through
protection of the brain endothelium under ischemic stroke conditions
(Fagan et al., 2004; Fisher, 2008; Rodriguez-Yanez et al., 2006).

Understanding the critical mediators in regulating cerebrovascular endothelial dysfunction may eventually lead us to discover novel targets
for the treatment of stroke.
Recently, accumulating studies have shown that non-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs) are functional RNA molecules that are generally not translated into proteins but can actively regulate the expression and function of
protein-coding genes by different mechanisms. It is worth noting that
only approximately 1.5% of DNA sequences in the human genome are
responsible for protein coding whereas at least 98% of the genome
does not contain protein-coding DNA sequences but transcribed into
various ncRNAs (Derrien et al., 2012; Qureshi and Mehler, 2012). In addition to well-known ncRNAs such as rRNAs and tRNAs, ncRNAs can be
broadly classiﬁed as small (b 200 nt) and long (N 200 nt) ncRNAs
(lncRNAs) (Bartel, 2004; Kim, 2005; Qureshi and Mehler, 2012;
Schonrock et al., 2012; Taft et al., 2010; Vemuganti, 2013; Yin et al.,
2014). NcRNAs have become a focus in biomedical research in the last
half decade and are now regarded as important and essential mediators
in major biological/physiological processes impacting development, differentiation, and metabolism, as well as pathologies in a variety of
human diseases (Qureshi and Mehler, 2012; Schonrock et al., 2012;
Suarez and Sessa, 2009; Taft et al., 2010; Vemuganti, 2013; Wienholds
and Plasterk, 2005; Yin et al., 2014). So far in the stroke ﬁeld, the role
of a speciﬁc class of small ncRNAs, miRNAs, was mainly investigated in
the pathogenesis of stroke (Eacker et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013;
Ouyang et al., 2013; Rink and Khanna, 2010; Saugstad, 2010; Tan
et al., 2011; Vemuganti, 2010; Yin et al., 2013b, 2014). Notably, our research team has focused on studying the functional signiﬁcance of
stroke-associated endothelial ncRNAs with a special focus on miRNAs
in cerebral endothelial pathophysiology after stroke (Yin et al., 2010a,
2012, 2013a, 2013b, 2014).
Non-coding transcripts N 200 nucleotides up to ~100 kb are deﬁned
as lncRNAs (Mattick, 2009; Mercer et al., 2009; Ponting et al., 2009;
Vemuganti, 2013; Yin et al., 2014). Recently, whole transcriptome sequencing (e.g. RNA-seq) of human and other genomes has revealed signiﬁcant numbers of lncRNAs which are long transcripts similar to
mRNAs but lack protein coding (translation) potential (Derrien et al.,
2012). LncRNAs can control gene expression by various mechanisms
that include recruitment of histone modiﬁcation complexes, modulating transcription factor activity and splicing machinery, increasing
mRNA stability, and acting as transcription enhancers. LncRNAs function in various biological processes including gene transcription, cell differentiation, imprinting, immune responses, and stem cell pluripotency,
and have cell-speciﬁc expression patterns that respond to external
stimuli (Mattick, 2009; Mercer et al., 2009; Ponting et al., 2009). Involvement of lncRNA in human diseases, including stroke, has
begun to appear and is expected to escalate. For example, recent microarray proﬁling studies identifying stroke-responsive alterations
of lncRNAs (Dharap et al., 2012, 2013; Vemuganti, 2013) underscore the importance of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of ischemic
stroke. However, the essential role and molecular mechanisms of
lncRNA in ischemic stroke still remain poorly understood. In particular,
nothing is known to date about the functional signiﬁcance of lncRNAs in
cerebral vascular endothelial biology and pathophysiology in ischemic
stroke.
In this article, we utilized RNA-seq technology to transcriptome proﬁling lncRNAs in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) after exposure to oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro mimic of
stroke conditions. For the ﬁrst time, we have identiﬁed substantial
OGD-responsive lncRNAs in BMECs, and further conﬁrmed the altered
pathological lncRNA expression in the cerebral vascular endothelium
in a mouse ischemic stroke model. Moreover, we also found a number
of conserved transcription factor binding sites in the promoter region
of these OGD-responsive endothelial lncRNAs. Therefore, our studies
could uncover lncRNAs associated with brain endothelial dysfunction
in ischemic stroke, potentially advancing the ﬁeld by linking lncRNA biology to stroke-induced cerebral vasculature pathologies.

2. Materials and methods
All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO), while cell culture supplies were purchased from Invitrogen
Corporation (Carlsbad, CA) unless speciﬁed.
2.1. BMEC cultures and oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)
Mouse BMECs were prepared as previously described (Yin et al.,
2002b). Brieﬂy, mouse cerebral cortex from adult male C57BL/6J mice
(male, body weight 25–30 g, 3–4 months-old) (Jackson Laboratory,
Bar Harbor, ME) was homogenized, ﬁltered and sequentially digested
with collagenase B, then collagenase/dispase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), followed by centrifugation in 40% Percoll
solution. The second band containing microvessels was collected and
plated onto collagen-coated dishes. Mouse BMECs (1–5 passages,
N95% purity based on expression of factor VIII and exhibiting bradykinin
receptor function) were grown to 85–95% conﬂuency before use (Yin
et al., 2002b).
To mimic ischemic-like conditions in vitro, cell cultures were exposed to OGD for a ﬁxed time (Yin et al., 2002a). Brieﬂy, mouse BMEC
cultures were transferred into a temperature controlled (37 ± 1 °C) anaerobic chamber (Forma Scientiﬁc, Marietta, OH) containing a gas mixture composed of 5% CO2 and 95% N2. The culture medium was replaced
with deoxygenated glucose-free Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and cells were maintained in the hypoxic
chamber for 16 h. Control mouse BMECs were not exposed to OGD.
2.2. RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis
RNA was extracted from cultured BMECs by using a miRNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Eluted RNA was prepared for sequencing
using Illumina protocols, and then sequenced on the HiSeq 2000
(Illumina) to generate 50 bp paired-end reads. We obtained about
41.4–59.1 M reads for each sample (four independent biological replicates per group). The reads were aligned to the mouse genome (from
UCSC Genome Browser) using Bowtie2 (2.1.0) (Langmead et al., 2009)
with Tophat (2.0.8b) (Trapnell et al., 2009). We used Cufﬂinks to ﬁrst
assemble transcripts from all datasets using the NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq) mouse gene annotation as a reference guide. All
mouse XenoRefSeq annotations that overlapped with the unannotated
transcripts were identiﬁed. Nonoverlapping transcripts were assessed
for protein-coding potential using PhyloCSF (Lin et al., 2011). Using a
threshold previously used to identify non-coding RNAs, all multiexonic transcripts with a PhyloCSF score N20 were called novel
protein-coding transcripts and b 20 as lncRNAs (Leung et al., 2013; Lin
et al., 2011; Pauli et al., 2012). FPKM values were calculated for expression levels of each transcript. To assess the biological reproducibility between the replicates for each condition, Pearson's Correlation value was
also determined for each pair of replicates. Cuffdiff (Trapnell et al.,
2010) was used to identify differentially expressed transcripts in two
conditions with the reference annotation containing mouse RefSeq
genes and lncRNAs with an FPKM N 0.5.
Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on normalized array
values with Cluster 3.0 with Euclidean distance and single linkage for
N10,000 genes and average linkage for smaller gene sets. Heatmaps
were generated with Java TreeView. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was
completed using GO Elite with default settings.
To assess the signiﬁcance of the proximity of co-regulated lncRNAs
and protein-coding genes, we carried out 100,000 simulations of proximity measurements on randomly placed co-regulated lncRNAs and
protein-coding genes in the mouse genome (Leung et al., 2013; Lin
et al., 2011; Pauli et al., 2012). We analyzed 4301 coding genes and
362 lncRNAs to be co-regulated and then counted the number of simulated OGD-responsive lncRNAs within 500 kb of a simulated OGDresponsive gene.

2.3. Promoter analysis of transcription factor binding sites

2.6. Quantitative real-time PCR

As transcription factors are crucial in the process of transcription of
non-coding RNAs, we checked and analyzed the promoter region of
OGD-responsive lncRNA genes for the identiﬁcation of conserved
transcription factor binding sites. For each lncRNA, a 2-kb promoter
sequence upstream to the transcription start site was analyzed for
conserved TF binding sites by using the Genomatix Software. All TF
matrices with a Z-score of N2 (representing P N 0.05) were considered
statistically signiﬁcant (Dharap et al., 2011).

Total RNA was isolated from BMEC cultures or isolated cerebral
microvessels by using a miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or
Trizol (Invitrogen). A quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out with a Bio-Rad
thermocycler and an SYBR green kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) according
to the manufacturer's recommendations. Speciﬁc lncRNA primers used
for the reaction are listed in Supplemental Table 1. The relative lncRNA
expression was normalized by 18S RNA levels. The PCR experiments
were repeated 3 times, each using separate sets of cultures (Yin et al.,
2006a, 2006b).

2.4. Mouse model of transient focal cerebral ischemia
2.7. Immunoﬂuorescence staining
Male C57BL/6J mice (male, 8- to 10-weeks-old) were purchased
from Jackson Laboratory. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by
intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using a nylon
monoﬁlament suture as described previously (Yin et al., 2010a, 2010b,
2011, 2013a). Brieﬂy, mice were anesthetized with ketamine
(100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). After a midline skin incision,
the left common carotid artery was exposed and then its branches
were electrocoagulated. A 2-cm length of 6-0 rounded tip nylon suture
was gently advanced from the external carotid artery up to the internal
carotid artery until regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) was reduced to
less than 16% of baseline. After 60 min of proximal MCA occlusion,
blood ﬂow was restored by removing the suture. Changes in cerebral
blood ﬂow (CBF) at the surface of the cortex were recorded using a
laser-Doppler ﬂowmetry monitor (BPM2 System, Vasamedic, St. Paul,
MN). Sham control animals were subjected to similar operations to
expose the carotid arteries without occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. After 60 min of MCAO, the mice were allowed to recover for 24 h.
Arterial blood gases, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate were also
monitored in selected animals 30 min before, during, and 30 min after
MCAO. The rectal temperature was controlled at 37.0 ± 0.5 °C during
surgery with a feedback-regulated heating pad (Harvard, Holliston,
MA). After the ischemic insult, mice were kept in an air-ventilated
incubator at 24.0 ± 0.5 °C. The animals were sacriﬁced at 24 h of reperfusion, and the brains were quickly removed for biochemical assays as
well as infarct determination. All procedures using laboratory animals
were approved by the University of Michigan Animal Care and Use
Committee.

2.5. Cerebral microvessel isolation
Cerebral microvessel isolation employed previously described
methods with modiﬁcations (Yin et al., 2006b, 2010a). Brieﬂy, mice
were sacriﬁced by decapitation under anesthesia. The brains were immediately removed from the skull and immersed in ice-cold buffer A
(103 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KC1, 2.5 mM CaC12, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM
MgSO4, 15 mM Hepes, pH 7.4). The brain was homogenized in a 5-fold
volume excess of buffer B (103 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KC1, 2.5 mM CaC12,
1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 15 mM Hepes, 25 mM HCO3, 10 mM
glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1 g/100 ml dextran pH 7.4) with
a Teﬂon homogenizer. The homogenate was suspended in an equal volume of 25% BSA and was centrifuged at 5800 ×g at 4 °C for 30 min. The
pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer B and passed over an 85 μm
nylon mesh (Tetko, Depu, NY). This ﬁltrate was then passed over a
3 × 4 cm glass bead column (0.45 mm glass beads) with a 44 μm
nylon mesh at the bottom, and then washed with 400 ml of buffer
B. Microvessels adhered to the glass beads while contaminants
passed unimpeded. Microvessels were recovered by repeated gentle
agitation of the glass beads in buffer B. The supernatant with
microvessels was decanted and spun at 500 × g for 5 min, and the
ﬁnal pellet was stored at − 80 °C until various biochemical assays
were performed.

Mouse BMECs grown on coverslips were then ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and washed 3 times with 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4). The
cells were incubated with a primary rat anti-CD31 antibody (1:50; BD
Bioscience), mouse anti-Claudin 5 (1:50; Invitrogen), or mouse antiOccludin antibody (1:50; Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C. On the following
day, the cells were incubated with ﬂuorescein-conjugated anti-rat or
anti-mouse IgG (1:100; Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h. BMECs
were counterstained with 1 μg/ml of DAPI (Molecular Probes; Eugene,
OR) to visualize nuclear morphology. Slides were washed, wet mounted
and examined with an Olympus ﬂuorescence microscope (Yin et al.,
2002b, 2006a).
2.8. Quantitative and statistical analyses
Quantitative data are expressed as mean ± SD or SEM based on at
least three independent experiments of triplicate samples. Differences
among groups were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's post-hoc test. Comparison between two
experimental groups was based on a two-tailed t-test. A P-value less
than 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. RNA-seq identiﬁcation of transcriptome proﬁling in mouse BMECs after
OGD
To determine the transcriptomic effects of OGD, an in vitro mimic of
ischemic stroke conditions, on the cerebral vascular endothelium, we
treated mouse BMECs (Fig. 1) with OGD for 16 h and then performed
RNA sequencing (Fig. 2) of RNA isolated from non-OGD control and
OGD-treated cells. RNA sequencing reads were generated and mapped
to the mouse genome reference. A total of 79.68% of ﬁltered reads
could be aligned to the mouse reference genome. Four independent biological replicates were performed for each treatment and the transcript expression level (FPKM) was calculated as described in the
Materials and methods section.
We discovered 55,832 transcripts using this approach, and further
divided them into protein-coding or non-coding by assessing their
protein-coding potential. We classiﬁed a total of 10,677 transcripts
with limited protein-coding potential as lncRNAs and 43,705 as
protein-coding transcripts (Table 1). Approximately 5241 lncRNA transcripts that did not overlap with the known mouse genome were classiﬁed as novel (non-annotated), and named as lnc-OGD in numerical
order (lnc-OGD 1-5241) compared to 5436 annotated lncRNAs
(Table 1). Further bioinformatics analysis using Cuffdiff discovered
4663 signiﬁcantly differentially expressed transcripts (FDR b 0.05), including 362 annotated or unannotated lncRNAs and 4301 coding
genes (Table 1). Hierarchical clustering showed systematic variations
in the expression of lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs in mouse
BMECs after ischemic stimuli (Fig. 3). Among the 362 signiﬁcantly
changed lncRNAs analyzed, a total of 147 lncRNAs increased and 70

endothelial cell marker, CD31 and BBB markers, Claudin 5 and Occludin reveals typical circumcellular signals of CD31, Claudin 5, and Occludin. Scale bars are indicated.

lncRNAs decreased by more than 2-fold in mouse BMECs after 16 h of
OGD exposure, and were classiﬁed as OGD-responsive endothelial
lncRNAs (Table 1). The most highly-upregulated annotated lncRNAs
are Snhg12, Malat1, and Srsf3, whereas the most highly upregulated
non-annotated lncRNAs are lnc-OGD 1645, lnc-OGD 2327, and lncOGD 1006 (Table 2). Accordingly, the most highly downregulated annotated lncRNAs include 281008D09Rik, Peg13, and Pisd-ps1, whereas the
most highly downregulated non-annotated lncRNAs include lnc-OGD
3916, lnc-OGD 2838, and lnc-OGD 301 (Table 3).
Interestingly, we also found that a total of 992 protein-coding RNAs
increased and 748 decreased by more than 2-fold in mouse BMECs after
the same ischemic exposure (Table 1). Within the listed differentially
expressed genes (Supplemental Tables 2–3), GO analysis results were
determined and KEGG pathway analysis (Supplemental Fig. 1) revealed
substantial enrichment-related pathways, including cell degradation,
cell adhesion, cell cycle, p53, MAPK, VEGF, and other signiﬁcant signaling pathways in this proﬁle, many of which are associated closely with
cell death, abnormal cell metabolism, ER stress, oxidative stress, inﬂammation, or cerebral endothelial pathologies under ischemic stroke.
It has been reported that lncRNAs may prefer to co-regulate with
neighboring genes and exert enhancer-like activities (Cabili et al.,
2011; Leung et al., 2013; Orom et al., 2010a, 2010b). In order to determine the signiﬁcance of the proximity of co-regulated OGDresponsive endothelial lncRNAs and protein-coding genes, we carried

out 100,000 simulations of proximity measurement on randomly placed
co-regulated lncRNAs and protein-coding genes in the mouse genome.
In particular, we focused on 4301 signiﬁcantly changed genes and the
most highly altered lncRNAs (Tables 2–3) to be co-regulated. We counted the number of simulated OGD-responsive lncRNAs that were within
500 kb of a simulated OGD-responsive gene. We found that most highly
upregulated or downregulated lncRNAs are proximal (b 500 kb) to
differentially expressed OGD-responsive genes (Supplemental
Tables 4–5). Further functional association or regulation between
OGD-responsive lncRNAs and their neighboring/adjacent proteincoding genes needs to be further veriﬁed in the future.
3.2. QPCR veriﬁcation of RNA-seq identiﬁed OGD-responsive brain endothelial lncRNAs
In order to validate the expression proﬁles generated from RNA-seq,
we performed quantitative real-time PCR to identify the correlation between the two datasets. As shown in Fig. 4, the most highly upregulated
or downregulated brain endothelial lncRNAs found in RNA-seq proﬁling
experiments were further veriﬁed and showed consistent alteration
tendencies in our qPCR study. These ﬁndings are the ﬁrst to identify
OGD-responsive brain endothelial lncRNAs, which suggest potential
functional roles for these lncRNAs in mediating vascular endothelial responses to ischemic stimuli.
3.3. The expression of OGD-responsive endothelial lncRNAs in cerebral microvasculature in mice after transient focal cerebral ischemia
Extending our in vitro observations into in vivo studies, we further
examined if OGD-responsive endothelial lncRNAs (upregulated and
downregulated) have similar pathological expression patterns in
mouse cerebral vasculature after ischemic stroke. To quantitatively determine expression of OGD-responsible lncRNAs in the cerebral

(Fig. 5A). Of note, three most highly upregulated (Snhg12, Malat1, lncOGD1006) or downregulated (281008D09Rik, Peg13, and lncOGD3916) OGD-responsive endothelial lncRNA transcripts were also
signiﬁcantly increased or reduced in isolated mouse cerebral
microvessels in response to ischemic stroke (Fig. 5B), respectively.
These data suggest that the expression of OGD-responsive endothelial
lncRNAs will also be signiﬁcantly altered in the cerebral vascular endothelium after in vivo ischemic insults, suggesting that these OGDresponsive lncRNA transcripts are associated with cerebrovascular
pathogenesis after ischemic stroke, and warrant further investigation.

2010; Yin et al., 2010a). We analyzed a total of 128 transcription factors
with FPKM N 1 in all conditions of our RNA-seq data. To explore the possibility that TFs regulate OGD-responsive lncRNA expression in a transcriptional manner, we employed Genomatix software to screen for TF
binding sites in the promoter region of 362 OGD-responsive endothelial
lncRNAs (Table 4). Our bioinformatics analysis has identiﬁed that Sp1
and Krüppel-like transcription factors (KLFs) are the two highest overrepresented TFs in the promoter region of OGD-responsive lncRNA
genes, whereas LOC100861682 and 2610019E17Rik have the highest
number of TFs bound in their promoters (Table 4). These ﬁrst-step results suggest that TFs may speciﬁcally affect the activity of OGDresponsive endothelial lncRNAs under ischemic stimuli.

proﬁling approach. For the ﬁrst time, our data have shown that brain
vascular endothelial cells respond to ischemic stimuli by dramatically
altering hundreds of lncRNA transcriptomic proﬁles, suggesting potential and uncovered functional roles for these differentially expressed
lncRNAs in the brain vascular pathogenesis of ischemic stroke.
During the past few years, our understanding of the complex aspects
of vascular endothelial biology dramatically increased by the discovery
of ncRNAs (Bartel, 2004; Kim, 2005; Qureshi and Mehler, 2012;
Schonrock et al., 2012; Taft et al., 2010; Vemuganti, 2013; Yin et al.,
2014). In that context, ncRNAs such as miRNAs have been shown to
play crucial roles in the control of endothelial cell biology, including cerebral endothelial biology (Yin et al., 2013b, 2014). Except for endothelial miRNAs, only a few reports have demonstrated the participation of
speciﬁc lncRNAs in the regulation of endothelial biology and function
during physiological and disease conditions (Gordon et al., 2010; Li
et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2012). A recent study has shown that genetic inactivation of Meg3 in mice leads to a signiﬁcant increase in the expression of pro-angiogenic genes that promote new microvessel formation
in the brain cortex (Gordon et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010; Yuan et al.,
2012). Up to now, the expression and function of lncRNAs in cerebral
vascular endothelial biology and stroke-induced cerebral vascular pathologies are totally unknown (Yin et al., 2014).
In this study, we employed RNA-seq approaches to provide deﬁnitive evidence that cerebral vascular endothelial cells express high levels
of lncRNA transcripts. In particular, we identiﬁed a total of 362 annotated and unannotated OGD-responsive endothelial lncRNAs in cultured
BMECs, including 147 OGD-upregulated and 70 OGD-downregulated
lncRNA transcripts. These most highly altered expression proﬁles of cerebral endothelial lncRNAs were further conﬁrmed by our quantitative

PCR analysis in cultured BMECs after in vitro stimuli. Importantly, the
expression levels of the most highly upregulated lncRNAs (Snhg12,
Malat1, and lnc-OGD 1006) as well as the most highly downregulated
lncRNAs (281008D09Rik, Peg13, and lnc-OGD 3916) have also been
found to increase or decrease respectively in cerebral microvasculature
after in vivo ischemic stimuli (mouse ischemic stroke model). These
ﬁndings strongly suggest that OGD-responsive brain endothelial
lncRNAs may have functional roles in mediating endothelial responses
to ischemic stimuli, and may serve as endogenous modulators to regulate endothelial cell biology and also pathophysiology after cerebral ischemia. Further studies are needed in the future to show the
signiﬁcance of individual lncRNA molecules in the regulation of poststroke cerebrovascular pathophysiology and neurological outcomes.
Also, the molecular/transcriptional regulation of selective lncRNAs in
cerebral vascular endothelium was warranted for further investigation.
These results will provide novel insights into a better understanding of
lncRNA-based molecular regulatory mechanisms in the control of impaired cerebral vascular endothelial structure and function after cerebral ischemia.
LncRNAs are known to recruit chromatin-modifying proteins such as
Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to speciﬁc sites of genome and
affect gene expression through regulating chromatin states (Rinn and
Chang, 2012). Human lncRNA HOTAIR is the ﬁrst such RNAs recognized:
HOTAIR physically associates with PRC2, and modulates PRC2 and
H3K27me3 localization of hundreds of sites throughout the genome
(Rinn et al., 2007; Tsai et al., 2010). Also, a number of studies indicated
that many TFs are able to transactivate or transrepress the transcription
of lncRNAs and thus affect their functions (Bethke et al., 2009; Huang
et al., 2015; Schanen and Li, 2010; Yin et al., 2010a). For example
lincRNA-p21 expression can be activated by p53 through physical interaction with p53, lincRNA-p21 then serves as a transcriptional repressor
in the p53 pathway and plays a role in triggering apoptosis (Huarte

J. Zhang et al. / Experimental Neurology 277 (2016) 162–170

et al., 2010). In another study, lncRNA TUG1 expression was found induced by nuclear transcription factor SP1 and TUG1 further repressed
Krüppel-like factor 2 transcription in the epigenetic level (Xu et al.,
2015).
Consistent with the previous studies, our bioinformatics analysis has
shown that there are a substantial number of TF binding sites in the promoter regions of the 362 OGD-responsive lncRNAs, including Krüppellike transcription factors (KLFs) and Sp1 as the two highest overrepresented TFs in the promoter regions of most OGD-responsive lncRNA
genes. These data imply the possibility that TFs may regulate OGDresponsive lncRNA expression in a transcriptional manner. In order to
further validate TF transcriptional regulation of OGD-responsive
lncRNAs, a series of further experiments, including luciferase transcription activity assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis,
qPCR, and Western blotting, will need to be performed in the future as
described in our previous publications (Yin et al., 2010a, 2013a).
In summary, this study is the ﬁrst to proﬁle lncRNA regulatory transcripts in cerebral vascular endothelium under ischemic conditions by
using high-throughput deep sequencing (RNA-seq) technology. The
functional importance and molecular regulatory mechanisms of
lncRNAs in the cerebral vasculature, especially in the endothelium following ischemic stroke, are totally unknown. Identiﬁcation of new
lncRNA transcripts will provide a novel window of opportunity to
study RNA-directed epigenetic regulators in cerebral endothelial biology and their essential role in stroke-induced vascular endotheliumdependent cerebrovascular pathologies, as well as likely reveal novel
targets for a promising translational future of lncRNA-based diagnostics
and therapeutics in ischemic stroke.
