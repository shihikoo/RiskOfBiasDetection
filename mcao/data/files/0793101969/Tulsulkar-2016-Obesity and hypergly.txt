Objective: Obesity-induced diabetes has increased over the years and has become one of the risk factors for stroke. We investigated the influence of diet-induced obesity and hyperglycemia on permanent
distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO)-induced ischemic stroke in mice.
Methods: Male C57/Bl6 mice were treated with a high-fat/high-carbohydrate diet [HFCD/obese and
hyperglycemia (O/H)] or a normal diet (control) for 3.5 months, subjected to pMCAO, and sacrificed after
7 days.
Results: Infarct volume analysis showed no differences between the O/H and control group, whereas
neurological deficits were significantly higher in the O/H group compared to the control group. Sirtuin
(Sirt1) was overexpressed and NADPH oxidase was reduced in the O/H group. O/H mice had significantly
lower expression of Wnt and glycogen synthase kinase 3 a and b, a key component in the Wnt signaling
pathway. Translocation of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) to the nucleus was observed in both the O/H
and control groups, but O/H mice showed a higher expression of AIF in the nucleus.
Conclusions: These data suggest that impaired Wnt signaling and active apoptosis result in reduced
post-stroke recovery in obese and hyperglycemic mice.

Introduction
In the United States and similar industrialized nations, obesity
caused by long-term consumption of a high-fat diet is an independent risk factor for acute ischemic stroke (1,2). Recent studies have
suggested that obesity is linked to type 2 diabetes, hypertension,
neurodegenerative disease, lipid disorders, and cognitive impairments (3,4). Obesity is an autonomous predictor of unfavorable
functional outcome and mortality in ischemic patients treated with
tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which is the only therapy available for ischemic stroke (5). Concurrent pathological conditions in
obesity comprise the metabolic syndrome and increase the risk of
vascular disease and type 2 diabetes, which are the risk factors for
stroke. Neovascularization is considered protective in stroke, but in
high-fat diet-induced type 2 diabetes mice, excessive angiogenesis
resulted in impaired neovascularization and subsequent coronary and
peripheral complications (6).
Wnt proteins are extracellular factors that are secreted as glycoproteins and play an important role in developing an adult central nervous system. They regulate proliferation and differentiation of neural
progenitor cells to neuronal cells. Activation of Wnt signaling ini-

tiates a neuroprotective mechanism in Alzheimer’s disease (7). Activation of Wnt signaling provides an appropriate environment for
neuronal differentiation and migration of newborn neurons toward
the ischemic lesion, thus helping in functional recovery. Moreover,
Wnt signaling is critically involved in neurogenesis, and inhibition
of Wnt signaling reduces newly formed neurons and impairs object
recognition in rodents (8,9).
In this study, we explore whether high-fat-diet-induced exacerbates
ischemic injury and post-ischemic recovery. Age-matched animals
were fed with either a high-fat/high-carbohydrate diet (HFCD) or a
normal diet (ND) for 3.5 months prior to ischemia, and subsequent
functional and histological evaluations were conducted 7 days following stroke. We questioned whether mice exposed to HFCD for
several months would have increased functional deficits and larger
infarct volume following permanent distal middle cerebral artery
occlusion (pMCAO) compared to animals maintained on a ND. In
addition, we investigated the cortical protein expression levels of
various proteins that play a critical role in the injury and repair
phase of stroke, such as histone deacetylase Sir2 (silent information
regulator 2), orthologue sirtuin-1 (Sirt1), Wnt, glycogen synthase
kinase 3 a and b (GSK-3a/b), apoptosis inducing factor (AIF),

hyperglycemic (O/H). Animals were divided into four groups: 1)
sham (no obesity/no hyperglycemia/no pMCAO), 2) sham obesity/
hyperglycemic (O/H) (obesity/hyperglycemia/no pMCAO), 3) control (no obesity/no hyperglycemia/pMCAO), and 4) O/H/pMCAO
(obesity/hyperglycemia/pMCAO). Animals that were fed a HFCD
prior to the pMCAO continued on the HFCD for the 7 days postischemia. Likewise, ND-fed mice continued a ND for the 7 days
post-ischemia days following pMCAO. Therefore, fasting blood glucose was only tested prior to the pMCAO.

Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
Control (n 5 12) and O/H/pMCAO (n 5 15) groups were subjected
to pMCAO as per our previously optimized method to occlude the
distal part of the MCA (11). Mice initially anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and then maintained at 1.5% were operated on under a surgical microscope. A thin 1.0 cm vertical skin incision given between
the right eye and ear exposed the temporal bone after moving the
temporal muscles aside. A 2.0 mm hole drilled with a dental drill
precisely over the region of the distal MCA was followed by removing dura mater over the distal part of the MCA. With the help of a
bipolar coagulator, the distal part of the MCA was severed to interrupt the blood flow to the area supplied by the artery. A rectal probe
was inserted to monitor the core body temperature, which was maintained at 37.0 6 0.58C during the procedure with a heating blanket.
After the end of the surgical procedure, mice were transferred to a
temperature-regulated incubator and kept for 2 h to recover from
surgery and finally shifted to home cages. All behavioral parameters
were evaluated by an expert person blinded to the treatment groups.

Motor activity
Motor functions were evaluated by using rotarod equipment (Columbus Instrument, OH). Each animal was given three trials 24 h before
performing the actual task. Locomotor activity was monitored 4 h
before surgery (baseline), 24 h post-surgery, and 7 days after
pMCAO surgery.

Neurological deficit scoring
Each group was evaluated on a 28-point scoring pattern after 7 days
following pMCAO. Both sensory and motor deficits, such as body
symmetry, gait, climbing, circling behavior, front limb symmetry,
compulsory circling, and whisker response, were evaluated in the
task. Each of the seven tests was graded from 0 to 4, with higher
scores indicating more severe deficits.

After sectioning the digital images of the caudal and rostral sides of
each stained coronal sections were obtained and analyzed. The
infarct area was estimated from five slices of each brain, measuring
rostral and caudal sides of each individual slice in conjunction with
the thickness, and expressed as a percentage of the volume of the
contralateral hemisphere. Infarct volume analysis was performed
using ImageJ software provided by NIH.

Western blot analysis
A separate cohort of four groups of mice (n 5 6/group) subjected to
the same experimental protocol was used for protein analysis. The
ipsilateral brain cortices (including infarcted tissues) from sham (control and O/H) and pMCAO (control and O/H) groups were dissected
out, weighed, and homogenized. Fractionation was carried out to separate nuclear and cytosolic fractions of brains tissues. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), and samples were analyzed by loading
equivalent amounts of total cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins (25 lg)
onto 10% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred
from the gel to the PVDF membrane followed by overnight incubation
at 48C with the following antibodies: mouse anti-actin (Millipore,
MA), rat anti-histone (Thermo Scientific, IL), rabbit anti-Wnt
(Abcam, MA), rabbit anti-p-GSK-3a/b (Thermo Scientific), mouse
anti-GSK-3a/b (Thermo Scientific), mouse anti-Sirt1 (Santa Cruz Biotech, TX), rabbit anti-AIF (Millipore), rabbit anti-APP (Genscript,
NJ), and rabbit anti-NOX4 (Thermo Scientific) using the following
dilutions: 1:2,000, 1:2,000, 1:2,000, 1:400, 1:1,000, 1:1,000, 1:1,000,
1;1,000, and 1:1,000, respectively. After washing, membranes were
incubated with the secondary antibody, goat anti-rabbit, and/or goat
anti-mouse, at a dilution of 1:4,000 (Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories, PA). Images were analyzed using Bio-Rad ChemiDocTM
XRS1 image analyzer. The densitometric values were normalized
with respect to the values of actin immunoreactivity to correct for any
loading and transfer differences between samples.

Statistical analysis
All behavioral parameters and infarct volumes between different
groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Newman–Keuls
post hoc test. For the protein analysis, the differences between
groups were determined by Student’s t test. In all statistical analyses
performed, a value of P < 0.05 was considered to be significant.

Results
Diet-induced obesity and hyperglycemia

Grip strength
Front limb grip strength in mice was determined at 4 h prior to
ischemia, 24 h and 7 days after pMCAO using grip strength equipment (Columbus Instrument, OH). Each animal was tested three
times per trial at 4 h before, 24 h after, and 7 days after pMCAO,
and the scores were averaged.

Infarct volume analyses
Animals from control and O/H/pMCAO groups were euthanized by
a carbon dioxide overdose 7 days after pMCAO for evaluation of
infarct volume. Brains were carefully removed and placed on dry
ice for sectioning into five 2-mm-thick coronal sections before incubating in 2% triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) (Sigma Co., MI).

Mice fed a HFCD for 3.5 months have a significant weight gain
(P < 0.001), and significantly increased fasting blood glucose level
(P < 0.001) compared to mice fed a ND (see Table 1). Therefore,
after 3.5 months of feeding, the HFCD-fed mice are obese and
hyperglycemic.

O/H mice suffer from higher neurological deficits
and impaired locomotor activity after 7 days of
pMCAO
Here, we wanted to determine the effect of HFCD on mouse brains
after permanent ischemia. Mice were sacrificed after 7 days of
pMCAO. The O/H group suffered from significantly higher neurologic deficits (Figure 1A) and impaired locomotor activity (Figure

1B), but grip strength was not significantly affected (Figure 1C) on
day 7, and the infarct size was similar to that of the control group
(Figure 1D). Our data are consistent with previous findings (6), suggesting that the permanent model of ischemia in early diabetic condition causes a smaller infarct volume and no hemorrhage, which
was observed possibly due to no reperfusion in the permanent ischemia or possibly due to neovascularization in the brain (12).

Sirt1 expression in O/H group following pMCAO
The sirtuin proteins are class III histone deacetylases (HDAC), and Sirt1
has been shown to play a central role in metabolic homeostasis. Here we
observed that Sirt1 expression goes down in control pMCAO mice, but
was significantly higher in the O/H group subjected to pMCAO (Figures
2A,B) and compared to the control pMCAO group. However, in sham O/
H and pMCAO control groups, NOX4 expression was significantly lower
as compared to sham control which was observed to be further downregulated in the O/H pMCAO group (Figures 2C,D).

Impaired Wnt signaling and GSK-3a/b after
pMCAO in control mice is further decreased in
O/H mice
Wnt proteins are the secreted cysteine rich glycosylated proteins that play
an important role in embryonic development and in the matured central
nervous system involved in cell proliferation and cell survival. Our Western blot data suggest that the control pMCAO group had significantly
lower Wnt1 expression which was further downregulated in the O/H
pMCAO group (Figures 3A,B) as compared to sham control animals.
Similarly, p-GSK-3a/b (Figures 3C,D) expression levels were observed
to be lower in sham O/H and control pMCAO as compared to the sham
control group and the expression was observed to be further downregulated in the O/H pMCAO group. These results indicate that obesity and
hyperglycemia worsen the post-ischemic recovery in O/H mice possibly
due to lower expression of Wnt and p-GSK-3a/b expression levels.

AIF translocation to nucleus after pMCAO
in O/H results in apoptosis
Oxidative stress causes apoptosis by either a caspase-dependent or
caspase-independent mechanism. AIF is a caspase-independent protein which, on activation, is released from mitochondria and translocates to the nucleus, leading to cell death (13). Expression of AIF
and translocation to the nucleus was significantly higher in O/H
pMCAO and as compared to sham control or sham O/H (Figures
4A,B). These results suggest that the caspase-independent apoptosis
mechanism is prevalent in O/H mice even after 7 days of ischemia.

HFCD-induced O/H reduces non-amyloidogenic
APP expression following pMCAO
APP is a type I transmembrane protein expressed in a soluble form
as sAPP. In the central nervous system, an increase in the expression
of APP coincides with the peak of neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth (14). Here we investigated the role of a short N terminal sequence of non-amyloidogenic APP (44-63) in control and
O/H mice subjected to pMCAO; we observed no significant changes
in APP expression in the sham control and sham O/H mice. However, the non-amyloidogenic APP levels were significantly reduced
in both the groups when compared to their basal levels in sham
(Figures 5A,B).

translocation of AIF to the nucleus was significantly elevated in the
O/H group, which is a major pathway for apoptosis. Together, these
results suggest that no differences in infarct volume in the O/H
group compared to that of the control group might be due to the
protective role of Sirt1 but impaired signaling of AIF and Wnt
partly contributed to diminished recovery after 7 days of permanent
ischemia.
A diet with a high amount of saturated fat has been linked to obesity,
type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, but the effect of these comorbidities has not been widely studied in human or animal models
(15). Clinical as well as pathological studies have shown that elevated
blood glucose due to obesity-induced type 2 diabetes at the time of
stroke is associated with higher cerebral infarction and hemorrhagic
transformation (16). Previous studies on rats have shown that the activity of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) is increased in diabetes.
MMP inhibitors such as metformin and minocycline inhibit MMP-9
activity and attenuate cerebral macro-vessel formation, suggesting a
direct role of MMP-9 and vascular remodeling in diabetes (17). Recent
studies also suggest that diabetes modulates neovascularization, which
can result from angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, collateral growth, and/or
arteriogenesis (6). It is also well established in colon cancer models
that chronic consumption of a high-fat diet increases tumor angiogenesis due to overexpression of vascular-endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), leptin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, angiogenin,
angiopoietin-1, and angiopoietin-3 (18). Sirt1 is an important modulator of angiogenesis, vasodilation, and blood supply. Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) deacetylation causes Sirt1 to block endothelial cell
senescence and promotes endothelial cell growth, vascular sprouting,
branching morphogenesis, and blood vessel formation in mice. Deacetylation of endothelial nitric oxide activates Sirt1 thus resulting in overexpression of nitric oxide, leading to vasodilation, and increased blood
supply (19). Numerous studies have reported the protective effect of
Sirt1 in liver and muscle from detrimental metabolic consequences
upon exposure to a high-fat diet (20). In a recent study (21), inhibiting
Sirt1 resulted in increased acetylation of eNOS activity and further
reduced eNOS expression, initiating endothelial dysfunction. It was
also reported that NO is inactivated by NAD(P)H oxidase derived O2
2
(22). However, ours is the first study showing that Sirt1 overexpression
in the brain is possibly associated with angiogenesis and cerebral
remodeling in HFCD-fed mice which might be the cause of not observing any differences in the infarct volume. There are conflicting reports
on the differences between O/H and normal mice when subjected to
different models of stroke. Chen et al. (23) showed differences between
db/db versus db1 (nondiabetic) mice at 24 h after 1 h of ischemia
reperfusion whereas Kim et al. (24) showed the differences only after
30 min of ischemia and 3 days of reperfusion in diet-induced diabetic
mice. However, the differences were not observed at 24 h of permanent
model of stroke (6) pertinently due to augmented neovascularization
owing to angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. Our study is consistent with
the permanent model of ischemia and supports our hypothesis (6).
The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is an extracellular factor crucial for mammalian central nervous system development and regulates diverse processes including cell proliferation, differentiation,
and migration (11,25). Binding of Wnt to the frizzled receptors and
lipoprotein receptor-related protein co-receptors initiates the signaling cascade and inhibits GSK-3b activity. Reduced GSK-3b stabilizes and prevents b-catenin from proteasomal degradation, allowing
unphosphorylated b-catenin to translocate to the nucleus for activation of developmentally important genes such as VEGF, bcl2,

422

Obesity | VOLUME 24 | NUMBER 2 | FEBRUARY 2016

survivin, tight junctions (26). Wnt proteins are significantly involved
in embryonic development, cellular differentiation, and cell survival
(27). More importantly, b-catenin expression by Wnt signaling promotes renal cell survival during metabolic stress and may be
involved in muscle-to-fat cell conversion (28). Recent studies
showed that loss of Wnt1 during oxygen glucose deprivation contributes to cell injury, apoptosis, and DNA degradation. Studies also
suggest that type 2 diabetes risk gene, transcription factor 7-like 2
(T-cell specific, HMG-box) (TCF7L2) is an effector of Wnt signaling pathway, and Wnt signaling controls the gut and brain glucose
metabolism (29,30). Wnt is the important component against neuronal degeneration, and blockade of Wnt inhibits neuroprotection and
affects the functional recovery, thus highlighting the role of Wnt in
neurodegeneration (31,32). The results of our study conform to previous studies suggesting that ischemia abrogates Wnt1-mediated
neuroprotection in the brain against oxidative stress, and we are the
first to show the detrimental effect of a high-fat diet on Wnt expression, which might have been the reason for slow post-ischemic functional recovery. In a non-pathological condition, APP is cleaved
within the b amyloid sequence by non-amyloidogenic a secretase to
release a soluble form of sAPP which represents a major secretory
pathway and is non-amyloidogenic (33). In the central nervous system, the basal level of APP peaks during neuronal differentiation
and neural outgrowth. The soluble form of APP generated by cleaving within the b amyloid sequence has beneficial neuronal functions
such as synaptogenesis, neurite outgrowth, cell survival, and adhesion (33). The existence of adult neural stem cells and progenitors
increases the possibility of sAPP’s role in adult neurogenesis (34).
A study demonstrating Wnt inhibitor-induced inhibition of nonamyloidogenic processing of APP, also suggests possible crosstalk
between Wnt and non-amyloidogenic APP expression (35). Our
results of reduced APP expression in both the control and O/H
groups after ischemia are in agreement with the previous study.
In brain development as well as in neuronal tissue injury, the apoptotic
cell death pathway plays an important role and is required for eliminating truncated neurons and maintaining healthy cells (36). Various
cell death pathways have been elucidated during neuronal injury
induced by ischemia, including p53, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP), c-Jun, and the plasma membrane death receptor ligand system (36-38). Although caspases are recognized as important mediators
of apoptosis, accumulating evidence indicates the existence of
caspase-independent mechanisms of neuronal cell death (13). AIF is a
caspase-independent effector of cell death which, on activation in
response to death signals, is released from mitochondria and translocated to the nucleus (39). Recent evidence on PARP-1 knockout mice
and PARP-1 null neuronal culture suggests that PARP-1 activation
signals mitochondrial AIF release. Apoptosis from cerebral ischemia
involving nuclear translocation of cell death protein, AIF, occurs in
neurons (40), but to our knowledge, this is the first report to examine
the role of this cell death pathway in neurons of HFCD-fed animals
after stroke. In this study, we showed that neuronal apoptosis in
HFCD-fed animals after ischemia occurs due to the translocation of
AIF to the nucleus, a the possible mechanism of cell death.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the importance of increased

HFCD-induced O/H, which resulted in no changes in infarct volume.
The reduced expression of Wnt possibly resulted in lower neurobehavioral and functional outcomes after 7 days of ischemia in the
HFCD group. The HFCD-fed group also showed translocation of
AIF to the nucleus, which can be a possible mechanism of ongoing
apoptosis. We recognize that there are some limitations to this
study; for example, neurobehavioral parameters were assessed only
after 7 days. Further studies are warranted to explore the underlying
mechanism of neovascularization, blood flow measurements in
HFCD, and the use of Sirt1 and Wnt inhibitors on functional recovery after ischemia.O
