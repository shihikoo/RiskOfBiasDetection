Abstract Cell transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs)
is a promising approach for neurological recovery both
structurally and functionally. However, one big obstacle is
to promote differentiation of NSCs into neurons and the
followed maturation. In the present study, we aimed to
investigate the protective effect of taurine on the differentiation of NSCs and subsequent maturation of their
neuronal lineage, when exposed to oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD). The results suggested that taurine
(5–20 mM) promoted the viability and proliferation of
NSCs, and it protected against 8 h of OGD induced
impairments. Furthermore, 20 mM taurine promoted NSCs
to differentiate into neurons after 7 days of culture, and it
also protected against the suppressive impairments of 8 h
of OGD. Consistently, taurine (20 mM) promoted the
neurite sprouting and outgrowth of the NSC differentiated
neurons after 14 days of differentiation, which were significantly inhibited by OGD (8 h). At D21, the mushroom
spines and spine density were promoted or restored by
20 mM taurine. Taken together, the enhanced viability and
proliferation of NSCs, more differentiated neurons and the
promoted maturation of neurons by 20 mM taurine support

Introduction
Neural stem cells (NSCs) are self-renewing, multipotent
cells that generate the central nervous system [1]. They
primarily differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes [1]. NSCs can be isolated from the adult striatal tissue [1, 2]. They are considered as candidate for cell
replacement therapy in various neurological diseases, particularly in ischemic stroke-induced cerebral damages [3–
7]. Ischemic stroke accounts for 80 % of all strokes [8].
After a stroke, only a very small fraction of the damaged
neurons is restored by neuronal differentiation from
endogenous NSCs, whereas most of them are replaced by
glia scar tissue. Therefore, exogenous transplantation of
NSCs can provide enhanced neurogenesis to decrease glia
scar formation and relieve neurological dysfunction [5].
However, there exist many obstacles for this strategy to be
applied in clinic, especially the neuronal proliferation and
differentiation rate of NSCs [3, 5, 9].

Neurochem Res (2015) 40:2348–2356

Of clinical interest, taurine has sparked our interest in its
therapeutic application for promoting the proliferation and
differentiation of NSCs during their transplantation. It was
first found to be involved in brain development by studies
showing a higher taurine content (3–5-times higher) in the
developing and neonatal brain, as compared to the adult
brain in different species [10, 11], suggesting the requirement of taurine when brain cells are in the process of
development or maturation. Meanwhile, a series of studies
showed impaired brain development in taurine deficient
animals, as well as in human [12]. Pasantes-Morales and
Hernandez-Benitez revealed that taurine acted as a trophic
and/or protective factor, and it might be involved in the
optimal maturation of neural cells [13].
In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect
of taurine on the culture of NSCs for 21 days exposed to
oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) in an in vitro cell
model. OGD is widely used as an in vitro model of
ischemia. In such cultured condition, cells (NSCs or neurons formed) are incubated in deoxygenated, glucose-free
medium [14, 15] to mimic the ischemic stroke situation
in vitro. Our results clearly demonstrated that taurine
protected against the impairments of neural stem cell differentiated neurons induced by OGD. The present research
is of clinical significance to direct the stem cell therapy of
NSCs for neurological recovery, particularly in an ischemic
stroke environment.

Materials and Methods
NSC Culture
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.
The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics
of Animal Experiments of Soochow University. All surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia,
and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.
NSCs were isolated from E13.5 to E14.5 mouse
embryonic brains. The dissected cerebral cortices were cut
into small chunks and were digested with Accutase solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 5 min at 37 °C and
mechanically dissociated using a fire-polished glass Pasteur
pipette. Cells were washed once in PBS solution, plated in
a six-well plastic plate in DMEM medium supplemented
with 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, Perprotech, USA), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF,
Perprotech, USA), 2 % B27 supplement (Gibco, USA), and
1 % penicillin/streptomycin, and incubated at 37 °C in 5 %
CO2. The medium was changed every 3 days and the cells
were passaged every 7 days.

2349

For neural differentiation, NSCs were induced by
replacing the proliferation medium by a medium without
growth factors and containing 1 % bovine serum.
Oxygen and Glucose Deprivation
After 3 passages, cultured mouse NSCs were seeded into a
6-well plate at a density of 1 9 105/ml and placed into an
anaerobic chamber (Hitech, China) containing a gas mixture of 20 % CO2 and 80 % N2 (\0.2 % O2). The culture
medium of NSCs was replaced by glucose-free DMEM
with the same supplements as in the culture medium above
and incubated for various periods of time as indicated in
the study.
Immunostaining and Fluorescence Imaging
of Mouse NSCs
For the growth and differentiation condition, mouse NSCs
were immunostained against nestin (Abcam, USA), tuj-1
(Abcam), and DAPI (Sigma) at different time points
according routine protocols and imaged under a confocal
microscope.
Wst Assay
The proliferation and viability of NSCs were analyzed at
450 nm by the WST-1 reagent (4-[3-(4-lodophenyl)-2-(4nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene
disulfonate)
(Roche, USA). The assay was based on the cleavage of the
tetrazolium salt WST-1 by mitochondrial dehydrogenases
in viable cells. Briefly, after mouse NSCs were treated,
WST-1 was added to each well, and NSCs were further
incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. And the absorbance was measured at 490 nm with a plate reader.
Imaging of Dendritic Spines in Mouse NSCs
Dendritic spines were imaged under a confocal microscope
in mouse NSCs transduced with lentivirus encoding
mCherry-actin. pLVX-mCherry-actin vector (Clontech,
USA) was used for packaging the lentivirus. mCherry-actin
fusion protein (red) can be incorporated into actin filaments, and therefore allows for visualization of actincontaining dendritic spines in mouse NSCs in the present
study.
MTT Assay
In the present study, cell viability was measured by MTT
assay according to routine protocols. Briefly, mouse NSCs
were plated onto a 96-well plate at 60 % confluent for
further treatment. After treatment, the cells were incubated

123

2350

with 0.5 mg/ml of MTT solution for 4 h at 37 °C. The
formed formazan crystals in each well were dissolved in
DMSO and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm with a
plate reader. Cell viabilities were normalized to the control.
All experiments for each value were repeated for three
times independently.

Neurochem Res (2015) 40:2348–2356

were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-GFP, Abcam,
USA; anti-MAP2, Sigma, USA) overnight at 4 °C, and
then incubated with Alexa488 and Alexa594 s antibodies
(Invitrogen, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. DAPI was
used for nuclear staining.
Statistical Analysis

BrdU Incorporation Assay
For cell proliferation assay, mouse NSCs were cultured and
incubated together with 100 lM BrdU (stock of 10 mM in
PBS; Roche) in a 96-well plate at about 60 % confluent
right before further treatment as indicated in the study.
Immediately after treatment, NSCs were washed and fixed
for 30 min at -20 °C with ice-cold fix solution: 70 ml
ethanol ? 30 ml glycine pH 2.0. After extensive washing,
anti-BrdU primary antibody and fluorescently labeled
secondary antibody were sequentially applied on the cells
before drying and further examination with a fluorescent
microscope.
Western Blot
Western blot experiments were performed according to
routine protocols. Primary antibodies used were listed as
below: tuj-1 (Abcam), GFAP (Cell Signaling, USA), O4
(Cell Signaling), GAP-43 (Chemicon International, CA,
USA), GAPDH (Sigma). Individual experiments were
repeated for at least three times independently.
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO)
A heat-blunted and silicon-coated tip was inserted into the
right internal carotid artery of anesthetized mice (50 mg/
kg, intraperitoneally injection) with a 6-0 thread, which
subsequently reached the original site of MCA. The abrupt
drop in cortical perfusion (\25 % of the baseline) was
monitored by the laser Doppler flowmetry (PRIMED Inc.,
Stockholm, Sweden). After 60 min of MCAO, the filament
was removed to permit for reperfusion ([75 % of the
baseline). Taurine (5 mg/kg) was administrated intravenously 1 h after MCAO and the following days (once
every day) until the examination of the neuronal
differentiation.
Immunohistochemistry
After 4 weeks, the animals were perfused with 4 %
paraformaldehyde. Brains were dissected and fixed at 4 °C
and transferred to 20 % sucrose (12 h) and 30 % sucrose
(3 days). The brain sections were fixed in acetone for
15 min at 4 °C, and then incubated in 5 % BSA with 0.1 %
Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. The samples

123

All data were shown as mean ± SEM. All experiments
were independently repeated for at least 3 times. Mean
values were compared with the control by Student’s t test
and P \ 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Characterization of Neural Stem Cells
The survival and proliferation of NSCs are important in
their clinical application for cerebral structural and functional recovery during stem cell therapy. In the present
study, mouse embryonic NSCs were separated aseptically
and purified for at least five passages in vitro. Immunostaining against NSC specific marker nestin demonstrated
that most of the cultured cells were either single NSCs
(Fig. 1a) or neurospheres (Fig. 1b). Furthermore WST
assay demonstrated that NSCs proliferated normally with
time from D1 (day 1) to D5 (Fig. 1c). In the in vitro culture, NSCs formed spherical free-floating aggregates
known as neurospheres with time (Fig. 1d–f). Altogether,
the cultured cells used in the present study were mostly
NSCs and they exhibited well-preserved proliferation and
differentiation potential.
Viability and Proliferation of NSCs Under OGD
or Taurine Treatment
After 7 days of culture, we further examined the viability
and proliferation of NSCs after OGD or taurine treatment.
MTT assay showed that the viability of NSCs was
decreased by the treatment of OGD (Fig. 2a, left), and such
decrease was more pronounced with prolonged OGD
treatment from 2 h to 8 h (Fig. 2a, left). After 8 h of OGD
treatment, the cell viability was decreased to 45 %. Contrary to the OGD treatment, taurine promoted the cell
viability significantly (Fig. 2a, right) in the range of
5–20 mM, consistent with other studies [16]. Similarly,
BrdU incorporation assay demonstrated that the proliferation of NSCs decreased with OGD treatment (Fig. 2c, left),
and the proliferation rate after 8 h of OGD treatment was
about 31 % of the control without OGD treatment. Consistently, taurine treatment promoted the proliferation of
NSCs (Fig. 2c, right). Furthermore, cultured mouse NSCs

were treated with OGD for 8 h together with 20 mM taurine, since 8 h of OGD induced the most severe damage,
and we assessed whether 20 mM taurine could protect

against the damages induced by 8 h of OGD treatment.
Cell viability assay (Fig. 2b) and proliferation assay
(Fig. 2d) showed that 20 mM taurine restored the viability

123

2352

and proliferation rate to normal level (P [ 0.05). When
treated by a shorter duration of OGD (4 h), 20 mM taurine
showed similar or even stronger protective effects on the
observed parameters (Supplementary Fig. S1). In short,
OGD treatment inhibited the viability and proliferation of
NSCs, while taurine exhibited a favorable effect by
restoring the cytotoxic effect of OGD effectively. Worthy
of mentioning, when NSCs were co-treated with 8 h of
OGD and 20 mM taurine, the NSC density is at a comparable level to the control without treatment. Therefore,
NSCs were co-treated with 8 h of OGD and 20 mM taurine
for further study in their differentiation and the followed
maturation without interference from differences in the cell
density [17]. Worth of mentioning, when the cells were
treated by 20 mM taurine after OGD induction, taurine
successfully protected the cells from the impairments
induced by OGD insult, as evidenced by the improved cell
viability and proliferation compared to OGD group (Supplementary Fig. S2). It is not surprising that these results
are very similar with those in co-treatment experiments
(Fig. 2b, d), considering that the difference between these
two conditions is that there was only 8 more hours’ taurine
treatment for co-treatment experiment. Also, another dose
(5 mM) was employed to give a better impression of the
protective effects of taurine. 5 mM taurine was also capable of partially protecting NSCs against the OGD-8 h
induced impairments (Supplementary Fig. S3), but not as
completely as 20 mM taurine did.
NSC Differentiation After 7 days of Culture
The ability to generate the different cell types of central
nervous system is a distinctive characteristic of NSCs [18].
NSCs can differentiate into different type of cells, including neurons, astrocytes and oligo-dendrocytes. After 7 days
of differentiation, cells were immunostained against tuj-1,
a specific maker for neuron (red) (Fig. 3a). It was shown
that after OGD treatment for 8 h, the percentage of neuron
was decreased to about 66 % of that in the control without
treatment, and such decrease was significant from analysis
of 3 independent experiments (Fig. 3b). 20 mM taurine
promoted the differentiation of neuron to 124 % (Fig. 3b).
Similarly, when cells were co-treated with OGD (8 h) and
taurine (20 mM), the percentage of neuron significantly
increased, compared to that treated with OGD (8 h) alone.
Furthermore, Western blot analysis demonstrated that
NSCs differentiated into different type of cells, including
oligo-dendrocytes (indicated by the specific marker of O4),
astrocytes (GFAP), and neurons (tuj-1). Statistical analysis
from 3 independent experiments showed that OGD (8 h)
treatment inhibited the differentiation of neurons, and
promoted the differentiation of astrocytes. Consistently,
20 mM taurine promoted the differentiation of neurons,

123

Neurochem Res (2015) 40:2348–2356

and inhibited the differentiation of astrocytes (Fig. 3d),
which effectively recovered the differential changes caused
by OGD (8 h) treatment (Fig. 3d). There was no obvious
difference in NSC differentiation to oligodendrocytes in
the experimental groups. In short, taurine (20 mM) promoted the differentiation of neurons from NSCs, and it
protected against the changes caused by OGD (8 h) during
NSC differentiation.
Neurite Sprouting and Outgrowth of the NSC
Differentiated Neurons After 14 days
of Differentiation
After 14 days of differentiation, we examined the neurite
sprouting and outgrowth of the NSC differentiated neurons
under different conditions (Fig. 4a). The neurite sprouting
and outgrowth were characterized by the number of the
primary dendrites per cell (Fig. 4b), the number of dendritic end tips (Fig. 4c) and the average length of primary
neurites (Fig. 4d). It was shown that the treatment of OGD
(8 h) significantly decreased the number of dendritic end
tips (Fig. 4c) and the average length of primary neurites
(Fig. 4d) (both P \ 0.05), whereas it had no effect on the
number of the primary dendrites. Conversely, taurine
(20 mM) promoted the neurite sprouting and outgrowth of
the NSC differentiated neurons as evidenced by the
increased number of the primary dendrites per cell
(P \ 0.05, Fig. 4b), dendritic end tips (P \ 0.05, Fig. 4c)
and the increased average length of primary neurites
(P \ 0.05, Fig. 4d). Consistently, it was also found that
20 mM taurine significantly restored the impairments
caused by OGD (8 h) (Fig. 4b–d). Western blot analysis
also demonstrated that the expression of GAP-43, a growth
or plasticity protein of neurons [19], was downregulated by
the treatment of 8 h of OGD (P \ 0.05), whereas it was
increased significantly (P \ 0.05) by the treatment of
20 mM taurine (Fig. 4e, f). Not surprisingly, the suppressed expression of GAP-43 by 8 h of OGD was restored
(P \ 0.05, Fig. 4e, f). In short, both immunostaining and
Western blot results demonstrated that OGD (8 h) suppressed neurite sprouting and outgrowth of the NSC differentiated neurons, whereas taurine (20 mM) recovered
the OGD (8 h) suppressed neurite sprouting and outgrowth.
Spine Morphology and Density in the NSC
Differentiated Neurons After 21 days
of Differentiation
Dendritic spines are classified into 3 categories: stubby,
mushroom and thin spines [13]. Spine morphology and
density in the NSC differentiated neurons after 21 days of
differentiation were examined, after the cells were transfected with mCherry-actin (Fig. 5a). It was shown that

20 mM taurine promoted the proportion of mushroom
spines, a mature type of spines taking function (P \ 0.05,
Fig. 5b). Meanwhile, it was also found that 20 mM taurine
also promoted the proportion of mushroom spines in NSCs
treated with 8 h of OGD (P \ 0.05, Fig. 5b). Moreover, it
was noticed that the spine density, expressed as the number
of spines per 10 lm of dendrites of the neurons, was
suppressed by OGD (8 h) (P \ 0.05), whereas promoted
by 20 mM taurine (P \ 0.05) (Fig. 5c). Not surprisingly,
the suppressed spine density by OGD (8 h) was restored by
20 mM taurine (Fig. 5c). In short, 20 mM taurine promoted the maturation of neurons differentiated from NSCs
and increased the number of spines.

neuronal differentiation of NSCs in vivo.

Enhanced NSC Differentiation into Neurons
in a Mouse MCAO Model
Furthermore, MCAO model was established to study neuronal differentiation of NSCS under taurine treatment
in vivo. Taurine (5 mg/kg) was administrated every day
after MCAO until examination. In taurine-treated group,
much more MAP2-positive cells could be found in those
GFP-positive cells (Fig. 6a, b, P \ 0.05) compared to that

Discussion
NSCs have been proposed for the treatment of different
cerebral diseases, such as ischemic stroke-induced neurological impairments, since they were separated from the adult
mouse striatal tissues in 1992 [20]. However, one of the big
obstacles remaining in clinic is to efficiently promote their
proliferation and differentiation into neurons. In this present
study, we aimed to investigate the effect of taurine on the
proliferation, differentiation and maturation of mouse NSCs at
different stages for 21 days in an in vitro cell model of OGD.
OGD is an in vitro model to mimic the in vivo conditions
during ischemia or ischemic stroke, where cells were cultured in a deoxygenated, glucose-free medium. Consistent
with previous studies, our results clearly demonstrated that
treatment of OGD (2–8 h) decreased cell viability and proliferation (Fig. 2a, c). After 8 h of OGD treatment, the cell
viability was decreased to 43 % (Fig. 2a) and the proliferation rate was about 32 % of the control without OGD

treatment (Fig. 2c). OGD insult was previously reported to
induce both excitotoxic necrosis and apoptosis in cortical
neurons [21]. OGD also inhibited the differentiation of
NSCs into neurons and the maturation of NSC-differentiated
neurons. After 7 days of culture, neurons differentiated from
NSCs treated with 8 h of OGD were down to about 62 %,
compared to the control without OGD treatment (Fig. 3a, b).
At D14, the neurite sprouting and outgrowth of the NSC
differentiated neurons were significantly suppressed by 8 h
of OGD (Fig. 4). Moreover, the spine density in the NSC
differentiated neurons after 21 days of differentiation was
about 60 % of the control (Fig. 5c).
Consistent with many previous studies, taurine exerted a
benificial effect on the viability and proliferation of NSCs
[22–26]. Our results clearly demonstrated that taurine
treatment (5–20 mM) significantly promoted cell viability
by MTT assay (Fig. 2a, b) and proliferation by BrdU

incorporation assay (Fig. 2c, d). And taurine (20 mM)
significantly reduced OGD-induced cell death and OGDinhibited proliferation of NSCs (Fig. 2). Of note, NSCs
grew normally in culture without taurine, and it was
reported that taurine treatment during the first 1.5 h in
culture was not sufficient to sustain its effect on increasing
BrdU incorporation [12, 25, 27, 28]. This observation
suggests that the action of taurine requires a prolonged
incubation with cells therefore is not the result of shortterm effects, such as membrane stabilization or activation
of membrane-located proliferation receptors [12, 29].
However the exact mechanism remains unclear.
Noteworthy, cell density has an important effect on the
differentiation of NSCs and followed maturation process of
in vitro neuronal networks, as reported in another research
using a model of hippocampal neurons [17]. Neuronal
cultures at different cell densities have differences in the

number of synapses per neuron, which results in a densitydependent neuronal network activity [17]. Therefore, in the
present study the cell density were maintained at a comparable level among different groups for the treatment with
or without OGD/taurine during examination of the differentiation and maturation process.
Of clinical significance, 20 mM taurine promoted neurons from cultured NSCs, and the proportion significantly
increased by 25 % (P \ 0.05, Fig. 3b). Typically, after a
differentiation process, astrocytes are the most abundant
cell type, whereas fewer neurons are present. Therefore,
such promotion in the differentiation into neurons from
NSCs has significant importance in clinic. Also, 20 mM
taurine promoted the neurite sprouting and outgrowth of
the NSC-derived neurons after 14 days of differentiation
(P \ 0.05, Fig. 4), as well as spine maturation and density
after 21 days (P \ 0.05, Fig. 5). More importantly, 20 mM
taurine protected against the OGD-induced damages on the
NSCs. Co-treatment of 20 mM taurine restored the cell

viability and proliferation of NSCs in culture, which was
significantly impaired by 8 h of OGD (Fig. 2b, d). After
7 days of culture, the inhibited differentiation of NSCs into
neurons by 8 h of OGD was significantly restored by
20 mM taurine (P \ 0.05, Fig. 3b). Moreover, damages of
OGD (8 h) on the neurite sprouting and outgrowth (Fig. 4),
spine maturation and density (Fig. 5) in culture were all
reversed by 20 mM taurine (P \ 0.05). Moreover, in a
mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO),
taurine also enhanced the differentiation of NSCs into
neurons (Fig. 6), suggesting the promoted effects of taurine
in neuronal differentiation of NSCs to repair the ischemia
induced damage in the pathological sites.
Taken together, taurine exhibited a beneficial effect on the
NSC viability and proliferation, neuronal differentiation and
the followed maturation. Meanwhile, it protected against the
damages induced by OGD. The present study demonstrates
that taurine hold a great potential as an excellent neural trophic
agent for neuronal repair and regeneration.

Conclusion
The present study demonstrated that taurine significantly
protected against the impairments of neural stem cell differentiated neurons induced by OGD, an in vitro model to
mimic ischemic stroke. It promoted cell viability and proliferation, neuronal differentiation and the followed maturation at different stages till 21 days during culture. The
present study highlighted the role of taurine as a therapeutic
agent for ischemic stroke induced cerebral damages.
