Abstract
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) induces secondary damages in the hippocampus that is remote from
primary ischemic regions. Tau hyperphosphorylation is an
important risk for neurodegenerative diseases. Increased
tau phosphorylation has been identiﬁed in ischemic cortex,
but little is known regarding the changes in the hippocampus. We showed that unilateral transient MCAO induced
accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and concurrent
dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3b at Ser 9
in the ipsilateral hippocampus. These MCAO-induced
changes were not reproduced when glutamatergic inputs
from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus were
transected; however, the changes were mimicked by
intrahippocampal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) administra-

tion. Inhibition of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) subunit NR2B,
but not NR2A activity in the hippocampus attenuated the
accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and spatial cognitive impairment in MCAO rats. Together, our data
suggest that overactivation of NR2B-containing NMDARs
through entorhinal–hippocampal connection plays an important role in the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in
the hippocampus following MCAO. Glycogen synthase
kinase-3b is an important protein kinase involved in
NMDARs-mediated tau hyperphosphorylation. This study
indicates that early inhibition of NR2B-containing NMDARs
may represent a potential strategy to prevent or delay the
occurrence of post-stroke dementia.

Stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
worldwide. Ischemic stroke comprises more than 80% of all
strokes, and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) is the
most common cause of ischemic stroke. In addition to
sensorimotor deﬁcits, MCAO also leads to cognitive impairment in humans and rodents (Wahl et al. 1992; Okada et al.
1995; Xie et al. 2011; Li et al. 2013). MCAO typically
results in extensive damage in the ischemic cortex, but it also
causes neuropathological changes in non-ischemic remote
areas, including the ipsilateral hippocampus, thalamus and
substantia nigra (Tamura et al. 1990, 1991; Wang et al.
2004; Uchida et al. 2010; Xie et al. 2011). Because the
hippocampus plays an important role in spatial information
processing and memory formation, the pathological changes

in the hippocampus and its relation to cognitive impairment
following MCAO have attracted substantial attention.

MCAO induced hippocampal tau phosphorylation

Given the extensive neuronal network within the brain,
primary ischemic lesion may extend to the hippocampus
through cortical–hippocampal connection. The hippocampus
receives cortical inputs via the perforant path that originates
from the entorhinal cortex (Steward 1976; Takacs et al.
2012), which is located next to MCAO-induced infarct.
Antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)
subtype of glutamate receptors prevented the impairment of
hippocampal long-term potentiation in MCAO rats (Sopala
et al. 2000). More importantly, an increased extracellular
glutamate concentration in the hippocampus has also been
observed in rat transient and permanent MCAO models
(Yang et al. 2001; Xie et al. 2011). NMDAR-mediated
excitotoxicity is the primary step that causes neuronal
damage after ischemic insult. Therefore, it is reasonable to
propose that secondary hippocampal changes may be
initiated by NMDAR overactivation triggered by excessive
glutamate release from the terminal of entorhinal input.
Tau protein, a microtubule-associated protein, predominantly localizes to neuronal axons where it modulates the
stability and assembly of microtubules in a phosphorylationdependent manner. Hyperphosphorylation of tau not only
reduces its binding afﬁnity to microtubules, which leads to
axonal transport impairment, but also causes tau mislocalization to dendritic spines and subsequent synaptic dysfunction (Iqbal et al. 2009; Hoover et al. 2010).
Hyperphosphorylation of tau has been proposed as an
important pathogenic process that contributes to the initiation
and progression of several human neurodegenerative diseases referred to as tauopathies, including Alzheimer’s
disease, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17,
Pick’s disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy (Iqbal
et al. 2009). MCAO induced site-speciﬁc hyperphosphorylation of tau and Alzheimer’s disease-like tauopathy in the
ischemic cortex in a rat stroke model (Wen et al. 2004a,b,
2007). However, little is known regarding the phosphorylation state of tau in the hippocampus following MCAO.
In the adult hippocampus, neurons primarily express
NMDARs that contain NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B subunits
(Cull-Candy et al. 2001). NMDAR activation can regulate
the phosphorylation state of cytoskeletal proteins, including
neuroﬁlament subunit NF-M (Fiumelli et al. 2008), microtubule-associated protein 2 (Quinlan and Halpain 1996;
Llansola et al. 2001) and tau (Fleming and Johnson 1995;
Allyson et al. 2010; De Montigny et al. 2013). NMDARcoupled downstream signaling cascade depends on both
receptor composition and location (Hardingham and Bading
2010; Paoletti et al. 2013). Whether and how distinct
NMDAR subtype activation inﬂuences hippocampal tau
phosphorylation following focal cerebral ischemia remains
unknown.
To address these questions, we examined the phosphorylation state of tau in the hippocampus in a rat MCAO model
and further explored the involvement of NMDARs in

567

secondary hippocampal damage. Here, for the ﬁrst time,
we demonstrated that MCAO resulted in accumulation of
hyperphosphorylated tau in the ipsilateral hippocampus, with
entorhinal inputs playing an important role in the initiation of
secondary hippocampal neuropathology.

Materials and methods
Reagents
Ifenprodil (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) and lithium chloride
(LiCl; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were dissolved in
sterile 0.9% NaCl. NR2A and control shRNA plasmids were
obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
An enhanced chemiluminescence solution was obtained from
Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). The following antibodies were
used: p-Akt (Ser473), p-glycogen synthase kinase-3b (GSK-3b)
(Ser9, cross-react weakly with the phosphorylated form of GSK-3a
at Ser21), Akt, GSK-3b (all from Cell Signaling Technology,
Beverly, MA, USA), b-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p-tau at
Ser199/202 (Gene Tex, Irvine, CA, USA), p-tau at Ser396, p-tau at
Ser404, tau-5 (all from Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), NR2A
(Millipore), and secondary antibodies for immunoblot (Thermo
Scientiﬁc, Rockford, IL, USA). The MCAO monoﬁlaments were
obtained from Sunbio Biotech (Beijing, China).
Animals and the MCAO model
All animal procedures were in accordance with the Guidelines for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals at Wuhan University and
were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee.
Three-month-old male Sprague–Dawley rats that weighed 240–
280 g were housed in a room with a 12 h light/dark cycle and free
access to food and water. Rats were subjected to transient right
MCAO using the intraluminal suture model previously described
with minor modiﬁcations (Longa et al. 1989). Brieﬂy, rats were
anesthetized via an intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate
(0.35 mL/100 g weight). Focal cerebral ischemia was subsequently
induced by introducing a 4-0 silicone-coated monoﬁlament from the
right external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery to obstruct
the origin of middle cerebral artery. After occlusion of the right
middle cerebral artery, the right external carotid artery was ligated.
Body temperature was maintained at 37.0  0.5°C during the
surgery with a homeothermic blanket. After 90 min of occlusion,
the intraluminal monoﬁlament was withdrawn to allow reperfusion.
A sham surgery was performed similarly with the exception that the
monoﬁlament was immediately removed after it was introduced into
the internal carotid artery.
Drug administration and intrahippocampal injection
We chose the CA1 region for intrahippocampal injection in which
delayed neuronal death has been observed following MCAO (Wang
et al. 2004; Uchida et al. 2010). NMDA (dissolved in 0.9% NaCl,
5 nmol in 1 lL) or NR2A shRNA plasmid (2 lg in 2 lL) was
directly administered into the right CA1 area via stereotaxic
injection (AP 3.7, ML 2.6, and DV 2.7 mm), according to the atlas
of Paxinos and Watson (Paxinos and Watson 2007), at a ﬂow rate of
0.5 lL/min. The injection needle was left in place for an additional
5 min to allow diffusion; it was then slowly withdrawn. Control rats
received 0.9% NaCl or control shRNA. To alleviate local lesion in

the entorhinal cortex, ifenprodil was administered into the right
medial entorhinal cortex at two different dorsoventral levels (AP
7.3, ML 5, DV 8 and 8.5 mm, 15 nmol in 1 lL for each level). For
3-day consecutive administration of ifenprodil and LiCl, a microinjection cannula system (guide cannula of 0.65 mm outer-diameter
and injection cannula of 0.41 mm diameter, purchased from RWD
Life Science, Shenzhen, China) was stereotaxically placed into the
CA1 region; it was ﬁxed on the skull with two small screws using
dental resin 2 days prior to MCAO or sham operation. Ifenprodil
(15 nmol in 1 lL) or LiCl (20 nmol in 1 lL) was administered at
30 min, 24 h, and 48 h after the onset of occlusion, and 0.9% NaCl
was administered as vehicle control.

Cell fractionation
To assess tau binding to microtubules, detergent-soluble cytosol and
insoluble cytoskeleton were separately isolated as previously
described (Elyaman et al. 2002). Brieﬂy, hippocampal proteins
were extracted in buffer that contained 25 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH
6.8, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 30% glycerol, 10 mmol/L
benzamidine, 0.1% Triton X-100, and a protease and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). After centrifugation for 10 min at 16 000 g, the supernatant that contained
detergent-soluble proteins was collected, and the pellets that
contained detergent-insoluble proteins were resuspended in the
sample buffer and heated to dissolve the proteins.

Transection of entorhinal inputs to the hippocampus
The surgical procedure for deafferentation was performed as
previously described (Zhou et al. 1989, 1998; Dong et al. 2006).
The transection completely disrupted perforant path with little
bleeding and minimal damage to the hippocampus (Zhou et al.
1989). Brieﬂy, rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and the
transverse sinus was exposed using a stereotaxic apparatus. Two
trenches were drilled on the skull: the ﬁrst trench was initiated at a
coordinate of 3.0 mm lateral to the midline and 1.5 mm caudal to
the lambda, which extended laterally to the crista frontalis. The
second trench was initiated from the end of the ﬁrst trench and
extended frontally to the crista frontalis. Perforant path was
transected using a microknife (2 mm wide, 0.3 mm thick) inserted
into the brain and moved down to the skull bottom along the ﬁrst
trench, and then curved frontally along the second trench.

Western blot analysis
Rats were killed at the indicated time points, and ipsilateral
hippocampi were isolated and stored at 80°C until use. The tissues
were homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation lysis buffer
(50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate),
which contained a protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail.
Protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid
protein assay (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Samples were separated by a
sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane (Millipore). The blots were
processed with primary and secondary antibodies and then visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents by Viber Fusion
FX7 imaging system (Viber Lourmat, Torcy France). The relative
tau protein level was normalized to b-actin, whereas the relative
phosphorylated GSK-3b and Akt was normalized to the corresponding total protein level.

Neurological assessment
Neurological deﬁcits were evaluated after 1 day of occlusion based
on previously published criteria (0 = no deﬁcit, 1 = failure to fully
extend right forepaw, 2 = circling to the right, 3 = falling to the
right, and 4 = no spontaneous walking with a depressed level of
consciousness) (Longa et al. 1989). Rats that scored one or two
points were killed for the study.
Nissl staining
Rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and perfused with
phosphate buffer saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The
brain was post-ﬁxed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde before
being transferred to 30% sucrose solution in 0.1 mol/L phosphate
buffer. The brain was coronally sectioned (30 lm) using a cryostat
(Leica Micro-systems AG, Nussloch, Germany). Sections were
stained with 0.2% thionin for 20 min at 37°C, rinsed in phosphate
buffer saline and differentiated in 95% ethyl alcohol. Sections were
then cleared in xylene and mounted with permanent mounting
medium.

Morris water maze
On the 10th day after ischemic onset, Morris water maze task was
performed to test spatial learning and memory as previously
described with some modiﬁcations (Morris 1984; Vorhees and
Williams 2006). The maze comprised a circular tank of 120 cm in
diameter and 60 cm in height, which was divided into four equal
quadrants. In the training sessions rats received four trials/day for
ﬁve consecutive days. Rats were allowed to ﬁnd a hidden platform
(9 cm in diameter, 1.5 cm below the water surface) within 120 s
and rest on it for 20 s. If the rat failed, it was guided onto the
platform with a stick and allowed to stay on it for 20 s before it was
removed. Swimming path and latency to escape onto the hidden
platform were recorded, and mean values of four trials in the daily
training were calculated to analyze spatial learning ability. At 24 h
after the last training, the rats were subjected to a 60 s probe trial in
which the platform was removed. The percentage of time spent in
the target quadrant and the number of crossing over the exact

location of the former platform were recorded to reﬂect memory
retention. All trials were recorded and analyzed by a Video tracking
system (Chengdu Instrument, Chengdu, China).
Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean  SEM and were analyzed using
SPSS 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Group differences in
swimming speed and escape latency in water maze task were
analyzed using two-way repeated-measure ANOVA followed by
Bonferroni’s post hoc test. Other data were analyzed by Student’s
t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Turkey’s post hoc test.
Statistical signiﬁcance was deﬁned as p < 0.05.

Results
MCAO resulted in elevated hyperphosphorylated tau in the
hippocampus and impaired spatial cognition
Western blot analysis demonstrated that phosphorylated tau
at Ser199/202, Ser396 and Ser404 signiﬁcantly increased in
the ipsilateral hippocampus from 2 to 14 days after MCAO
(Fig. 1a). However, increased tau phosphorylation did not
occur on the ﬁrst day after ischemia. A similar change was
observed in total tau level detected by tau-5 (Fig. 1a).
Interestingly, an obvious up-shift of the bands was observed
at 2 days after MCAO, which suggests an increased posttranslational modiﬁcation in tau. To assess tau binding to
microtubules, detergent-soluble cytosol and insoluble cytoskeleton were fractionated. MCAO induced a decrease in
total tau protein in the cytoskeletal fraction and an increase in
the soluble cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1b), which indicates the
signiﬁcant reduction in tau binding to cytoskeleton and
disruption of cytoskeletal network. However, we did not
identify neuronal loss in the hippocampus. Nissl staining
exhibited no alteration in the number or arrangement of the
ipsilateral hippocampal neurons compared with contralateral
and sham-operated hippocampus (Fig. 1c).
We then examined whether spatial cognition was
impaired in MCAO rats. During the 5-day hidden platform
trial, no signiﬁcant difference in swimming speed was
observed between sham-operated and MCAO rats (Fig. 1d).
Escape latency in the two groups decreased in a daydependent pattern. However, MCAO rats took more time to
ﬁnd the platform compared with sham-operated rats
(Fig. 1d). In the probe trial, MCAO rats exhibited fewer
platform crossing and less time spent in the target quadrant
compared with sham-operated rats (Fig. 1e). These observations indicate that spatial learning and memory was
impaired after MCAO.
GSK-3b inhibitor reduced the hippocampal
hyperphosphorylated tau and cognitive impairment in
MCAO rats
GSK-3b is an important protein kinase involved in the
regulation of tau phosphorylation. GSK-3 inhibition has been
shown to exert neuroprotective effects against cerebral

ischemia in animal model and glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in cultured neurons (Chuang et al. 2011). We then
examined whether GSK-3b was involved in hippocampal
tauopathy following MCAO. Consistent with the alteration in
tau phosphorylation, the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3b at Ser 9 was decreased in MCAO rats (Fig. 2a), which
indicated an increased GSK-3b activity. To examine the
upstream regulator for decreased Ser 9 phosphorylation, the
activity of Akt was monitored by immunoblotting with an
antibody that speciﬁcally recognized the phosphorylated,
activated form. MCAO induced a reduction in Akt phosphorylation, which was consistent with the dephosphorylation of
GSK-3b at Ser 9 (Fig. 2a).
To further conﬁrm the association between GSK-3b
dephosphorylation and elevated level of hyperphosphorylated tau, we investigated the effects of GSK-3 inhibitor LiCl
on tau phosphorylation and spatial cognition in MCAO rats.
LiCl can inhibit GSK-3 activity directly and indirectly by
increasing inhibitory GSK-3 phosphorylation. In shamoperated rats, LiCl treatment reduced phosphorylated tau
protein but had no effect on total tau protein (Fig. 2b). The
results indicate that GSK-3 is involved in the regulation of
basal tau phosphorylation. In contrast, LiCl treatment
signiﬁcantly attenuated both phosphorylated and total tau
protein in MCAO rats (Fig. 2b). During water maze test,
LiCl treatment did not cause signiﬁcant change in swimming
speed in sham or MCAO groups (data not shown). In MCAO
rats, LiCl treatment signiﬁcantly shortened the latency to ﬁnd
the hidden platform, and increased the crossing frequency
and percentage of time staying in the target quadrant (Fig. 2c
and d). LiCl administration in sham-operated rats caused no
obvious change in spatial cognition (Fig. 2c and d).
Entorhinal inputs to hippocampus were required for MCAOinduced tau hyperphosphorylation
We next examined whether entorhinal inputs played an
important role in the initiation of hippocampal secondary
damage. Entorhinal inputs were completely transected with
no damage to the hippocampus (Figure S1). Interestingly,
transection of entorhinal–hippocampal projections led to a
signiﬁcant reduction in total tau protein and phosphorylated
tau, as well as the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3b
compared with sham-operated control (Fig. 3a). In contrast,
MCAO following deafferentation caused no obvious alteration in the phosphorylation state of tau, Akt or GSK-3b
compared with deafferented rats (Fig. 3a). Spatial cognition
in deafferented rats was not examined because entorhinal
inputs are essential for hippocampus-dependent memory
formation (Brun et al. 2008; Suh et al. 2011). Using a preinjection of NR2B antagonist ifenprodil into the entorhinal
cortex 30 min prior to MCAO to alleviate the local lesion,
we further investigated the association between entorhinal
lesion and hippocampal secondary damage. Ifenprodil pretreatment in the entorhinal cortex markedly reduced total tau

and phosphorylated tau at Ser404 and increased the phosphorylation of GSK-3b but not Akt (Fig. 3b).

GSK-3b was also abrogated by ifenprodil treatment
(Fig. 4b). During water maze test, ifenprodil treatment did
not cause signiﬁcant change in swimming speed in sham or
MCAO groups (data not shown). Impaired spatial cognition
in MCAO rats was signiﬁcantly improved by ifenprodil
treatment, which was demonstrated by shorter escape
latency, more platform crossing and more time spent in the
target quadrant (Fig. 4c and d). Ifenprodil treatment in shamoperated rats had no signiﬁcant effect on spatial cognition
(Fig. 4c and d).
Because of the lack of a selective NR2A antagonist, we
chose speciﬁc shRNA to examine whether NR2A-containing
NMDARs participated in accumulation of phosphorylated

signiﬁcant effect on phosphorylated tau level in shamoperated rats, but it induced a dramatic decrease in MCAO
rats (Fig. 4a). MCAO-induced dephosphorylation of Akt and

the speciﬁc shRNA was conﬁrmed by reduced NR2A
expression in the hippocampal region surrounding shRNA
injection site (Fig. 5a). In sham-operated rats, NR2A shRNA
increased tau phosphorylation at Ser199/202 and Ser 396
epitopes, but not at Ser404 or total tau level, which indicates
that physiological NR2A-containing NMDARs limit tau
phosphorylation (Fig. 5b). However, inhibition of NR2A

both total and hyperphosphorylated tau, and this effect was
inhibited by ifenprodil (Fig. 6). NMDA administration also
suppressed the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3b, and
ifenprodil treatment reduced these changes (Fig. 6).

NR2B antagonist also reduced intrahippocampal NMDA
administration-induced tauopathy
We further conﬁrmed the involvement of NMDAR overactivation in MCAO-induced hippocampal tauopathy by direct
administration of 5 nmol of NMDA into the CA1 area; this
dose has been demonstrated to cause hippocampal neuronal
damage (Davidson et al. 1995). As expected, intrahippocampal application of NMDA resulted in elevated level of

Discussion
One novel ﬁnding in this study is that unilateral transient
MCAO induced accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau
in the ipsilateral hippocampus as early as 2 days after
ischemia. Tau hyperphosphorylation has been observed in
rat ischemic cortex after MCAO (Wen et al. 2004a,b,
2007), as well as in the gerbil hippocampus after global
ischemia (Morioka et al. 2006), which suggests that tau
hyperphosphorylation may contribute to ischemic neuronal
injury. Recently, hyperphosphorylated tau (Thr231 and
Ser199) and secondary neuronal death were observed in
the ipsilateral thalamus remote from the primary ischemic
region after MCAO (Dong et al. 2014). Together, these

ﬁndings indicate that accumulation of hyperphosphorylated
tau may also contribute to MCAO-induced secondary
damage in remote areas. We found that total tau protein
was also increased following MCAO, and inhibition of
GSK-3b or NR2B reduced both total and phosphorylated
tau. Increased total tau level observed in MCAO rats may
be a result of tau hyperphosphorylation because abnormal
phosphorylation of tau could impair tau proteolysis and
thus result in an abnormal accumulation of the protein
(Johnson 2006).
In this study, no signiﬁcant neuronal loss was observed in
the ipsilateral hippocampus, which was in accordance with
a recent report of Li et al. (2013) but in disagreement with
the reports of Wang et al. (2004) and Uchida et al. (2010)
which demonstrated hippocampal neuronal death after

MCAO. In these two studies, blood ﬂow in the common
carotid artery was transiently blocked for the duration of
MCAO or permanently blocked. Therefore, the discrepancy
between the aforementioned ﬁndings might result from the
differences in blood ﬂow in the common carotid artery
during and after ischemia. However, we observed that the
amount of tau binding to the cytoskeleton demonstrated by
tau protein level in detergent-insoluble fraction was markedly reduced, which indicates the disruption of cytoskeletal
network in hippocampal neurons. Cytoskeletal disruption
causes impaired axonal transport, which is predicted to be
an early event in several neurodegenerative diseases
(Brooks 1991). Our result provides evidence to explain
the morphological changes in axons that have previously
been described in rat hippocampus following MCAO, which

primarily manifested as swelling of axons and varicosities
(Zhang et al. 2012). It is widely known that hyperphosphorylated tau protein loses its ability to bind to microtubules
and may lead to aggregation and ultimately cytotoxicity.
Accumulating evidence suggests that tau is able to regulate
synaptic function (Pooler et al. 2014) and hyperphosphorylated tau impairs synaptic transmission and spine density
(Hoover et al. 2010; Rocher et al. 2010; Tepper et al.
2014). Taken together, although cell death may not occur in
the hippocampus after MCAO, accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau can lead to cytoskeletal disruption and
neuronal dysfunction, which subsequently causes cognitive
deﬁcit.

Another important ﬁnding of this study is that the
hippocampal secondary lesion is initiated by overactivation
of NR2B-containig NMDARs via entorhinal–hippocampal
connection. The hippocampal CA1 area receives glutamatergic inputs via perforant path from the entorhinal cortex
indirectly through a trisynaptic path as well as directly
through a monosynaptic path (Steward 1976; Brun et al.
2008; Takacs et al. 2012). These entorhinal inputs are
necessary for hippocampus-dependent memory formation
(Brun et al. 2008; Suh et al. 2011). Transection of entorhinal–hippocampal projections reduced the basal levels of
total and phosphorylated tau in the hippocampus, which
indicates the essential role of entorhinal inputs in the

MCAO induced hippocampal tau phosphorylation

regulation of hippocampal tau phosphorylation. MCAOinduced elevation of hyperphosphorylated tau was not
reproduced in rats with destruction of the entorhinal inputs,
and was alleviated in rats with a less severe ischemic lesion
in the entorhinal cortex. Furthermore, intrahippocampal
NMDA administration also induced an increase in hyperphosphorylated tau that was similar to MCAO. An increased
extracellular glutamate concentration in the hippocampus has
been observed with several peaks during ischemia and the
subsequent reperfusion period in rat and mouse transient
MCAO models (Yang et al. 2001; Xie et al. 2011). These
ﬁndings strongly suggest that entorhinal–hippocampal glutamatergic connection plays a critical role in the evolution and
spread of ischemic lesion to the hippocampus. It must be
noted that the increased extracellular glutamate in the
hippocampus may result from the release from both presynaptic entorhinal neurons and damaged post-synaptic
hippocampal neurons, as well as increased plasma amino
acids from a disrupted blood–brain barrier (Yang et al.
2001). However, the excitotoxicity initiated by pre-synaptic
glutamate release may be exacerbated by subsequent release
from damaged hippocampal neurons. Unlike the thick
ﬁlament (3-0), the thin ﬁlament (4-0) used in this study
does not cause blood ﬂow reduction in the hippocampus
(Ozdemir et al. 1999; Tanaka et al. 2000; Xie et al. 2011).
Thus, secondary hippocampal damage resulted from excessive activation of the hippocampal NMDARs rather than
reduced blood ﬂow.
In the mature hippocampus, pyramidal neurons primarily
express NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B subunits (Cull-Candy
et al. 2001). Physiological levels of NMDAR activation
could play an active role in the regulation of cytoskeletal
protein phosphorylation, including neuroﬁlament subunit
NF-M (Fiumelli et al. 2008), microtubule-associated protein
2 (Quinlan and Halpain 1996; Llansola et al. 2001) and tau
(Fleming and Johnson 1995; Allyson et al. 2010; De
Montigny et al. 2013). In this study, we demonstrated that
NR2B antagonist ifenprodil had no effect on the basal level
of phosphorylated tau, whereas NR2A shRNA induced an
increase in the basal level of phosphorylated tau at Ser199/
202 and Ser396 epitopes. This ﬁnding, together with the
previous in vitro study demonstrating that an NR2A
antagonist increases tau phosphorylation in hippocampal
slices (Allyson et al. 2010), suggests that NR2A-containing
NMDAR activity plays an essential role in limiting tau
phosphorylation under physiological conditions. Conversely,
the increase in hyperphosphorylated tau in MCAO rats was
prevented by inhibition of NR2B, but not NR2A activity.
The discrepancy between these two ﬁndings may be a result
of different patterns of synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDAR
activation under the aforementioned experimental conditions. Synaptic NMDARs are activated by trans-synaptic
release of glutamate under physiological conditions, whereas
extrasynaptic NMDARs are typically activated by elevated

575

extracellular glutamate under pathological conditions, such
as ischemic insult. Therefore, hyperphosphorylated tau
accumulated in the hippocampus may be predominantly
mediated by extrasynaptic NR2B-containing NMDARs.
Substantial data have supported the involvement of extrasynaptic NR2B-containing NMDARs in neurodegenerative
disease and acute CNS injury (Parsons and Raymond
2014). Interestingly, increased hyperphosphorylated tau
was not observed on the ﬁrst day after MCAO, which was
not consistent with the early elevation of extracellular
glutamate in the hippocampus (Yang et al. 2001; Xie et al.
2011). The precise mechanism remains unknown; however,
extrasynaptic NMDARs may be slow-responding receptors,
and their full activation may require prolonged ligand
exposure (Zhou et al. 2013). NMDARs function is regulated
by several mechanisms, including receptor expression,
trafﬁcking, phosphorylation, and interaction with differential
signaling cascades (Gladding and Raymond 2011). MCAO
rats exhibited no signiﬁcant change in hippocampal NR2B
expression compared with sham-operated rats (Figure S2).
The relevant molecular determinants require further investigation. It should be noted that excessive quinolinic acid
released from activated microglia and macrophage may also
contribute to NMDARs overactivation. Quinolinic acid, a
tryptophan catabolite produced through the kynurinine
pathway, acts as an NMDAR agonist and can induce tau
hyperphosphorylation (Rahman et al. 2009; Schwarcz et al.
2012).
GSK-3b is an important protein kinase involved in the
regulation of tau phosphorylation. The basal activity of GSK3b is inhibited by phosphorylation at Ser 9, and Akt is one
Ser 9 kinase. MCAO-induced tau hyperphosphorylation and
spatial impairment were attenuated by LiCl and ifenprodil
treatment. Ifenprodil also dramatically reduced the concurrent dephosphorylation of GSK-3b and Akt in MCAO rats.
These data suggest that NR2B-containing NMDARs mediate
hippocampal tauopathy via Akt/GSK-3b signaling pathway,
and elevated level of hyperphosphorylated tau is correlated
with spatial cognitive deﬁcit after MCAO. Interestingly,
GSK-3 inhibition has been shown to elicit neuroprotection
against excitotoxicity in in vivo and in vitro ischemic models
(Chuang et al. 2011). Therefore, GSK-3b inhibition may be
a rational strategy to combat ischemic stroke by protecting
neurons in both ischemic core and remote areas. Ifenprodil
pre-treatment, which was used to partially lessen the
entorhinal ischemic lesion, caused inconsistent alterations
in the phosphorylation of GSK-3b and Akt. This ﬁnding
suggests other regulatory mechanisms are also involved in
the modulation of GSK-3b phosphorylation. Protein phosphotase-1 and protein phosphotase-2A, which are not only
the major direct regulators of tau phosphorylation but also
regulate GSK-3b activity (Iqbal et al. 2005; Wang et al.
2015), are known to be coupled with NMDARs (Szatmari
et al. 2005; Kamat et al. 2013). Further study is necessary to

reveal the roles and involvements of these protein phosphotases in regulating tau phosphorylation and GSK-3b
activity.
In conclusion, our study indicates that overactivation of
NR2B-containing NMDARs through entorhinal–hippocampal connection initiates the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the hippocampus, which contributes to
consequent spatial cognitive impairment in MCAO rats.
Our results provide new insight into the mechanism of poststroke dementia and open further prospects of selective
NR2B antagonist and GSK-3b inhibitor in stroke therapy.
