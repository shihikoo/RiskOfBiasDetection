Excitotoxicity following cerebral ischemia elicits a molecular cascade, which leads to neuronal death. c-Jun-N-terminal kinase
(JNK) has a key role in excitotoxic cell death. We have previously shown that JNK inhibition by a specific cell-permeable peptide
significantly reduces infarct size and neuronal death in an in vivo model of cerebral ischemia. However, systemic inhibition of JNK
may have detrimental side effects, owing to blockade of its physiological function. Here we designed a new inhibitor peptide
(growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45β (GADD45β-I)) targeting mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7), an
upstream activator of JNK, which exclusively mediates JNK’s pathological activation. GADD45β-I was engineered by optimizing the
domain of the GADD45β, able to bind to MKK7, and by linking it to the TAT peptide sequence, to allow penetration of biological
membranes. Our data clearly indicate that GADD45β-I significantly reduces neuronal death in excitotoxicity induced by either
N-methyl-D-aspartate exposure or by oxygen–glucose deprivation in vitro. Moreover, GADD45β-I exerted neuroprotection in vivo in
two models of ischemia, obtained by electrocoagulation and by thromboembolic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAo).
Indeed, GADD45β-I reduced the infarct size when injected 30 min before the lesion in both models. The peptide was also effective
when administrated 6 h after lesion, as demonstrated in the electrocoagulation model. The neuroprotective effect of GADD45β-I is
long lasting; in fact, 1 week after MCAo the infarct volume was still reduced by 49%. Targeting MKK7 could represent a new
therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ischemia and other pathologies involving MKK7/JNK activation. Moreover, this new
inhibitor can be useful to further dissect the physiological and pathological role of the JNK pathway in the brain.

In many disorders of the nervous system, overactivation of Nmethyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors leads to neuronal death
and consequent neurological impairment. NMDA-induced
neuronal death, that is, excitotoxicity, has been implicated in
many neurodegenerative diseases such as stroke, epilepsy,
Alzheimer disease, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury,
hearing loss, Parkinson’s and Huntington diseases.1 However,
the molecular mechanisms underlying excitotoxic neuronal
death remain only partially understood.
Excitotoxicity triggers complex signal transduction events
that induce the neuronal death program. Among them,
activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway has
a key role.2–5 There are only two direct upstream activators of
JNK: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 and 7 (MKK4
and MKK7).6,7 In some cell types, MKK4 activates JNK
primarily in response to stress stimuli, whereas MKK7

signaling is triggered by release of inflammatory
cytokines.8–10 In neurons, however, we showed that MKK7 is
mainly responsible for JNK overactivation during excitotoxicity
both in vitro3 and in vivo following middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAo).4 Conversely, MKK4 controls JNK physiological role and its activation is not affected by excitotoxic stimuli.3
Inhibition of the JNK pathway by the specific JNK inhibitor
peptide, D-JNKI1, has been proposed for the treatment of
ischemia.2 D-JNKI1 induces powerful neuroprotection in
in vitro models of excitoxicity2,11 and leads to a 93% reduction
in the infarct size in rodent models of ischemia.2,4,12 Despite
the potent and long-lasting neuroprotective effect of D-JNKI1,
total inhibition of JNK is not deprived of negative side effects,
as it regulates a variety of physiological events13 such as cell
proliferation, survival and differentiation.13 For these reasons,
MKK7 may represent a more attractive target for clinical

application, as it activates JNK specifically after toxic stimuli.
Thus, by targeting MKK7 the physiological role of JNK,
regulated by MKK4, will be preserved.
Here we designed a set of new cell-permeable inhibitor
peptides able to block MKK7 activity and protect against
excitotoxic death.
We took advantage of the growth arrest and DNA damageinducible 45β (GADD45β) ability to bind MKK7.9,14,15
GADD45β is involved in the control of cell stress responses
in cell cycle, DNA repair and oncogenesis.9,16 GADD45β
binds tightly to MKK7 and inhibits its enzymatic activity15 by
interacting with its catalytic domain.9 More importantly,
GADD45β inhibition is MKK7-specific and has no effect on
MKK4, MKK3/6 and MEK1/2 activity.9 The minimal essential
domain of interaction between MKK7 and GADD45β has
already been defined (GADD45β60–86 and 69–86 sequences).15
We here used in silico approaches to design an effector
peptide, based on the domain of GADD45β, and optimize its
affinity for MKK7. We then linked the effector peptide to a TATcargo in order to penetrate neuronal plasma membrane.17 The
selected cell-permeable MKK7 inhibitor peptide (GADD45β-Ι)
confers neuroprotection in vitro against NMDA and oxygen–
glucose deprivation (OGD) toxicity, as well as in vivo in two
models of MCAo with a clinically relevant post-ischemic
temporal window (6 h) at both 24 h and 1 week after lesion.
These data shed light on a new approach for the treatment of
ischemia.
Results
Design and development of TAT-MKK7 inhibitor peptides:
GADD45β-I. The minimal essential region of GADD45β that
interacts with MKK7 is at residues 60–86, but another region
(residues 104–113) seems to have a more marginal role to
stabilize the interaction between GADD45β and MKK7 (Papa
et al.15) (Figure 1a). As shown in Figure 1a, reporting the
structure of GADD45β obtained by homology modeling,
residues 60–86 form a helix-turn motif (Figure 1b). Most of
the residues in this region are hydrophilic and residues 62–68
are all negatively charged. Residues 104–113 form a long
loop with an alternation of hydrophilic and negative residues
(Figure 1b), and its marginal role in the GADD45β–MKK7
protein–protein interaction is probably due to the highly
flexible nature of this portion of GADD45β.
GADD45β interacts with MKK7 in proximity of its ATPbinding site9 and this may justify the presence of acidic
residues able to establish electrostatic interactions with the
basic residues in this site.9
The docking results put in evidence that in the majority of the
complexes obtained, region 60–86 is able to interact with
MKK7 (Figure 1a), matching the experimental data already
available.9,14,15 In detail, the α-helix of GADD45β establishes a
network of hydrogen bonds with the β-sheets forming the
MKK7 ATP-binding site (Figure 1a). The negatively charged
residues following GADD45β α-helix interact through a cluster
of electrostatic interactions with the positively charged
residues of MKK7 (Figure 1a).
These pieces of information were used to design two
peptides able to interact with MKK7 and inhibiting its function.
Cell Death and Disease

The first peptide (GADD45β69–86) was designed by considering only the sequence of the α-helix (residues 69–86) and
avoiding the cluster of negative residues (Figure 1c).
Consistently with in silico prediction, GADD45β69–86
showed an affinity in the low micromolar range for recombinant
MKK7 in vitro, as assayed by surface plasmon resonance
(SPR, Figure 2). Of note, the measured binding affinity
(3.71 μM) of the GADD45β69–86 peptide for recombinant
MKK7 was in good agreement with the biologically relevant
concentrations observed in subsequent experiments. The TAT
sequence was then been added to the N-terminal region of the
peptide (Figure 1c). A second peptide (TAT-GADD45β60–86)
was designed by considering all the regions formed by
residues 60–86 (Figure 1d). As previously stated, residues
62–68 are all negatively charged and they could have a key
role in stabilizing the interaction. However, this peptide
showed poor solubility in water. To avoid the interaction
between the negatively charged residues in the effector and
the positively charged amino acids of the TAT peptide, a
spacer sequence was added between the peptide and the TAT
(TAT-spacer-GADD45β60–86) (Figure 1d). To validate the
specificity
of
TAT-GADD45β69–86
and
TAT-spacerGADD45β60–86 peptides we designed a control peptide, TATGADD45β60–86 CONTROL, where 17 residues out of 27
composing the GADD45β60–86 peptide were changed. In
detail, the control peptide was obtained by substituting all the
negative charges with alanine residues (Figure 1d). Moreover,
to achieve a complete inhibition of interaction with MKK7, we
made the peptide less specific as possible by also mutating in
alanine or glycine the amino acids with physical–chemical
characteristics that could have a cooperative effect on the
binding (Figure 1c; i.e., Gln, His, Phe, Thr and Cys, and
Figure 1d). Based on these predictions, the control peptide
TAT-GADD45β60–86 CONTROL was designed in order to be an
inactive peptide.
Effect of GADD45β − I peptides on cultured neurons. The
cell-permeable MKK7 inhibitor peptides were tested in
primary cultures from dissociated cortical neurons. Toxicity
of the peptides was assessed after 24 h with LDH assay.
Application of both TAT-GADD45β69–86 and TAT-spacerGADD45β60–86 peptides did not induce neuronal death for
concentrations as high as 10 μM (one-way ANOVA, P40.05)
(Figure 3a). Conversely, the control (5′-AIAAAAAAAIALGIGA
GLIGSAAGNGAGAGAAGRKKRRQRRR-3′) peptide, TATGADD45β60–86 CONTROL application for 24 h resulted in an
increase of neuronal death at the higher dosages (5 and
10 μM) (not shown, one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post-hoc test,
***Po0.001).
NMDA neurotoxicity and neuroprotection by GADD45β − I
peptides. The
TAT-GADD45β69–86,
the
TAT-spacerGADD45β60–86 and the TAT-GADD45β60–86 CONTROL peptides
were tested against NMDA toxicity in vitro. Addition of the
cell-penetrating GADD45β − Ι peptides at the concentration of
1, 2.5 and 5 μM protected neurons against excitotoxicity
induced by exposure to 100 μM NMDA for 6 h (Figure 3b). In
fact, the TAT-GADD45β69–86 peptide exerts a 65% protection
against NMDA insult at 2.5 μM concentration, whereas the
TAT-spacer-GADD45β60–86 peptide protects by 53, 64 and

125% at 1, 2.5 and 5 μM, respectively (one-way ANOVA,
Tukey’s post-hoc test, ***Po0.001 NMDA versus CTR,
#Po0.05 NMDA+MKK7I versus NMDA, ##Po0.01 NMDA
+MKK7I versus NMDA and ###Po0.001 NMDA+MKK7I
versus NMDA) (Figure 3b). Similar results were obtained
after 12 h of NMDA exposure (Figure 3b). In this case, both
TAT-GADD45β69–86 and TAT-spacer-GADD45β60–86 peptides
lead to a significant protection of 59 and 56%, respectively, at
the higher dose tested (5 μM) (one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s
post-hoc test, ***Po0.001 NMDA versus CTR, #Po0.05
NMDA+MKK7I versus NMDA and ###Po0.001 NMDA
+MKK7I versus NMDA). As expected TAT-GADD45β60–86
peptide showed no protection for all the
CONTROL
concentrations tested (1, 2.5 and 5 μM) and both time points

(6 and 12 h) (Supplementary Figure S1, one-way ANOVA,
P40.05). Thus, the protective effect of the TAT-GADD45β69–
86 peptides is entirely accountable to the peculiar amino acids
composition of the region between residues 69–86 of the
GADD45β protein.
Out of the two peptides tested, TAT-spacer-GADD45β60–86
resulted as the most efficient in preventing NMDA excitotoxicity. Therefore, we decided to use this peptide for the
following experiments. We tested TAT-spacer-GADD45β60–86
in an in vitro model of OGD. TAT-spacer-GADD45β60–86
(5 μM) inhibited by 95% the neuronal death induced by 12 h
OGD (one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post-hoc test, **Po0.01
OGD versus CTR and ##Po0.01 OGD+MKK7I versus OGD)
(Figure 3c).

Figure 2 GADD45β69–86 interacts with recombinant MKK7. Starting at time 0, the
indicated concentrations of GADD45β69–86 were injected for 150 s over SPR sensor
surfaces on which 5000 RUs of human recombinant MKK7 had been previously
captured by amine coupling. The SPR chip was then washed with buffer alone to
monitor ligand dissociation. Fitted sensorgrams show GADD45β69–86 binding to
recombinant MKK7 in RUs. The data were obtained by subtracting the reference
channels, containing bovine serum albumin or no polypeptides. The heterogenous
ligand equation was the best algorithm to fit the data, suggesting that recombinant
MKK7 was immobilized in different orientations on the chip surface. Binding
parameters obtained in this manner were as follows: kon = 3.15 × 102 1/Ms;
koff = 1.30 × 10 − 3 1/s; KD = 3.71 μM

Efficacy and specificity of GADD45β − I peptides. We
tested the specificity of the TAT-spacer-GADD45β60–86
peptide for MKK7. Application of NMDA for 5, 30 and
60 min triggers MKK7 activation in neurons3 by increasing
its phosphorylation by 1.7-, 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively,
confirming its pivotal role in excitotoxicity (two-way ANOVA,
Tukey’s post-hoc test, *Po0.05 CTR versus NMDA and
***Po0.001 CTR versus NMDA) (Figure 4a). Treatment with
the TAT-spacer-GADD45β60–86 peptide abolishes MKK7
phosphorylation in cortical neurons, inhibiting the kinase
activity after either 5, 30 or 60 min of NMDA application by 78,
146 and 64%, respectively (two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s
post-hoc test, ##Po0.01 MKK7I+NMDA versus NMDA)
(Figure 4a). On the contrary, NMDA application does not
affect MKK4 activation and treatment with TAT-spacerGADD45β60–86 peptide has no effect on MKK4 pathway
(two-way ANOVA, interaction 40.05) (Figure 4b).
MKK7 inhibition is protective in two in vivo models of
cerebral ischemia. The TAT-spacer-GADD45β60–86 inhibitor
peptide (referred as GADD45β − I) was tested in the MCAo
and the thromboembolic ischemia model in rats.
MCAo model: We used this ischemic model to perform most of
the experiments. Two different paradigms of GADD45β − Ι
administration were chosen as follows: (1) 30 min before
(pre-ischemic injection) and (2) 6 h after cerebral ischemia
(clinical setting). Infarct area measurements were performed on
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)-stained brain slices
24 h after ischemia. In all animals, MCAo affected the right
frontoparietal cortex areas, as well as the underlying striatum,
even though moderately (Figure 5a). Pre-ischemic injection of
GADD45β − Ι reduced the infarcted volume by 43%
(Figures 5b–d). In fact, the percentage of ischemic volume on
the whole rat brain (mean ± s.d.) was 7.85 ± 2.03% in the
Cell Death and Disease

GADD45β − Ι-treated group (n = 6) versus 13.72 ± 4.07% in
control rats (n = 5) (**Po0.01; Figures 5b–d).
To define the therapeutic window of this inhibitor peptide, we
injected GADD45β − Ι 6 and 12 h after induction of MCAo.
Injection of GADD45β − Ι 6 h post ischemia reduced the infarct
volume by 42%, indicating a strong protection and a great
potential of GADD45β − Ι treatment (Figures 5c and d). In this
case, the percentage of ischemic volume in GADD45β − Ιtreated rats injected 6 h post lesion was 8.04 ± 1.04% (n = 5)
(**Po0.01; Figures 5c and d). On the contrary, the 12-h postischemic injection of GADD45β − Ι did not significantly
decrease the infarct volume, indicating the failure of protection
at this time point (not shown). Significant reduction in infarct
size was maintained 1 week after MCAo, when pre-ischemic
administration of GADD45β − I reduced the infarct volume by
almost 50% (Figures 5e and f). The percentage of ischemic
volume was 6.22 ± 0.98% in the GADD45β − Ι-treated group
(n = 5) versus 12.42 ± 2.22% in control rats (n = 5) (**Po0.01;
Figures 5f–h). Injection of GADD45β − Ι 6 h post ischemia
reduced the infarct volume by 44% (Figures 5e–g).
In this case, the percentage of ischemic volume in
GADD45β − Ι treated rats injected 6 h post lesion was
6.95 ± 0.93% (n = 5) (**Po0.01; Figures 5g and h).
MKK7-mediated neuroprotection: mechanism of action.
To validate the GADD45β − Ι action mechanism we characterized MKK7 activation, evaluated as P-MKK7/MKK7
ratio, in ischemic tissues from control and GADD45β − Ιtreated MCAo animals at 3 and 6 h after ischemia. As
previously reported, MKK7 phosphorylation increased in the
ipsilateral hemisphere after ischemia at 3 and 6 h, suggesting
an early activation.4 Treatment with GADD45β − Ι conferred a
43% protection on infarct size, which correlated with MKK7
inhibition in treated animals compared with MCAo: in fact,
rats treated with GADD45β − Ι showed a 54% reduction of
P-MKK7/MKK7 ratio 3 h after ischemia (two-way ANOVA,
Tukey’s post-hoc test, *Po0.05) (Figure 6a), which persisted
6 h after ischemia (33% reduction of P-MKK7/MKK7 ratio;
two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post-hoc test, *Po0.05)
(Figure 6b). To clarify the neuroprotective mechanism of
GADD45β − Ι we analyzed the levels of JNK 6 h post
ischemia. At 6 h, ischemic injury leads to a pathological
activation of JNK, which was reduced by application of
GADD45β − Ι (Figure 6c). To verify the specificity of
GADD45β − Ι for the MKK7-JNK pathway, we also analyzed
the phosphorylation level of MKK4: treatment with
GADD45β − Ι induces a modest, but not significant, increase
in the basal activity of MKK4 (Figure 6d). These results
suggest that GADD45β − Ι specifically inhibits MKK7
pathway, without blocking MKK4, and this inhibition leads to
a significant neuroprotection in vivo, with a temporal
intervention window of 6 h after cerebral ischemia.
Thromboembolic ischemia model: To confirm the neuroprotective role of GADD45β − Ι in vivo, we used a second
ischemic model. In this model, the GADD45β − I peptide was
injected 30 min before the induction of ischemia. Rats treated
with GADD45β − I showed significant improvements of the
functional neuroscore 24 h after ischemia compared with the
control group. Furthermore, TTC staining showed that rats

(Microbrightfield, Williston, VT, USA) and Cavalieri’s geometry on TTC-stained sections 24 h after thromboembolic
occlusion of the MCA (Figures 7a and b). All animals showed
an ipsilateral ischemic damage, that is, in the right lateral
frontoparietal cortex (Figures 7a and b). Pre-ischemic

50% (Figure 7c). The percentage of ischemic lesion on the
whole brain volume was 9.47 ± 1.96% in GADD45β − ΙCell Death and Disease

(**Po0.01) (Figure 7c). These data indicated the powerful
neuroprotective effect of GADD45β − Ι against brain injury

Discussion
JNK is a Janus-faced molecule, which may both protect and
damage neurons, regulated by the two upstream activators,
MKK4 and MKK7, which are not redundant,18,19 and respond
differently to stress stimuli,8–10 representing a ‘bottleneck’ in its
activation.

We found that MKK7, and not MKK4, mediates the
activation of JNK signaling in excitotoxic neuronal death3
and cerebral ischemia.4 Here we show, for the first time, that
MKK7-specific inhibition represents a good strategy to prevent
excitotoxic neuronal death and overcome possible side effects
occurring in response to JNK inhibition.13
We designed a new MKK7 inhibitor peptide by modeling the
minimal region necessary for the binding and coupling it with
the TAT peptide, to allow penetration of the blood–brain barrier
and neuronal membrane. A spacer was introduced between
the TATand the GADD45β sequences previously discovered.9
This allowed to functionally separate the different domains of
GADD45β − I, guaranteeing the entry of the peptide into
neurons (TAT sequence), and the ability to interact with MKK7
and inhibit its function (GADD45β sequence). Moreover, the

spacer sequence helped in stabilizing the peptide and in
increasing its solubility. The introduction of the spacer and the
use of the longer sequence, which includes the seven
negatively charged residues, increased the efficiency of the
inhibitor peptide. In fact, in vitro, GADD45β − I (TAT-spacerGADD45β60–86) showed a more potent neuroprotective effect
against excitotoxicity, if compared with the shorter TATGADD45β69–86 peptide. TAT-spacer-GADD45β60–86 peptide
completely protected from OGD in vitro, confirming the key
role of MKK7 also in this model. All together, the in vitro results
obtained with the SPR and the mutated peptide (TATGADD45β69–86 CONTROL) demonstrate the selectivity of
GADD45β-I peptide for MKK7.
Finally, the peptide showed no toxicity by itself on neurons,
suggesting its safety for in vivo treatments. To validate

GADD45β-I for clinical applications, we tested it in two in vivo
models of cerebral ischemia: the MCAo and the thromboembolic ischemia. Administration of the peptide before the
ischemic insult prevented neuronal death, reducing the infarct
volume of 43% 24 h after lesion. The neuroprotective effect
was maintained also when the peptide was administered 6 h
after ischemia, extending its clinical window. Currently, the
utilization of tissue plasminogen activator, the only pharmacological treatment approved for ischemic stroke,20 is
restricted
by
the
narrow
therapeutic
window
(3–4.5 h) and the limited efficacy, as only a sub-optimal dose
(0.9 mg/kg) can be administered, owing to the risk of iatrogenic
intracranial hemorrhage21–23, limiting treatment to an estimated 2–5% of ischemic stroke patients in the United States.24
Importantly, also in vivo GADD45β − I inhibited MKK7 activity
and its inhibition is in agreement with the protection obtained
on infarcted volumes at 24 h as well as at 1 week after lesion.
Our protection in vivo lasts at least 1 week, thus suggesting
that the effect of treatment is permanent and does not consist
in a mere delay in neuronal death. The time course of
phosphorylation of MKK7, that is, of its activation, is
compatible with the administration time of GADD45β − I, that
Cell Death and Disease

is, 3–6 h after the lesion. GADD45β − I revealed efficient in
reducing the infarct size in both the in vivo models tested. Even
though the thromboembolic model resembles the most
adherent to human stroke, the MCAo is by and large the most
commonly used for testing new drugs against excitotoxicity.
We are aware that notwithstanding the significant results
obtained in preclinical studies by blocking specific molecular
pathways, their clinical application remains poor25,26 and no
approved therapy exists for stroke other than thrombolysis.
This failure in translation from bench to bedside has led to the
recommendations on the stroke therapy academic industry
roundtable (STAIR),27 even though clinical trials fulfilling the
STAIR criteria for EPO or G-CSTS did not confirm preclinical
experimentation as well.28 The reasons for this failure are
multifarious, ranging from the plurality of mechanisms of cell
death,29 the side effects of activity blockade to prevent
excitotoxicity and the general conditions of the patient due to
comorbidities.
A strategy would be blocking the excitotoxic cascade at the
level of the activation of NMDA receptors by glutamate release
inhibition, NMDAR antagonists, Na+- or Ca++ channel blockers. All of these had significant effects on neuronal death, but

showed remarkable neurological and non-neurological side
effects in clinical trials.30 Furthermore, a certain degree of
NMDAR activation may be neuroprotective,31 eventually
through the activation of the Akt pathway.32 An opposed effect
has been shown for phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted
on chromosome 10 (PTEN) pathway, which mediates
NMDAR-induced death signaling. Its inhibition by a TAT-k13
peptide is neuroprotective against cerebral ischemia.33 No
cross-links between the PTEN and the JNK pathways have
been described thus far. The major neuroprotective effects
both in experimental and in clinical conditions have been
obtained with peptides targeting the PSD95-nNOS interaction
(NR2B9c) in rodents,34 primates35 and, finally, in clinical
trial.35,36 In fact, the binding of PSD95 to the NMDAR and
nNOS brings nNOS into close proximity with the NMDAR
channel pore and with the Ca++ that fluxes through the
NMDAR, thus activating the enzyme.37,38
Recently, as an alternative strategy, we found that M5, a
mutant of native urokinase plasminogen activator (prouPA),
can reduce infarct size with a reduced risk of bleeding.39
Cell Death and Disease

In addition, preconditioning stimuli reduce the effects of
cerebral ischemia,40 thus suggesting the administration of
gaseous carbon monoxide or carbon monoxide donors
(CORMs).41 Cell-based therapy has also been proposed to
modulate neuroinflammation, replace dying neurons and
stimulate brain repair by enhancing neurogenesis and
angiogenesis, but it is far from clinical therapy.42
Our inhibitor may represent an important tool to specifically
prevent the development of excitotoxicity in neurons, in the
absence of side effects and with a very interesting therapeutic
window. It might be associated to drugs acting on different
pathways of death as well as to increase their efficacy.
For example, blocking excitotoxicity could extend the therapeutic window for thrombolysis as well.
The in vivo results support its high therapeutic potential
against cerebral ischemia. For the first time, specific inhibition
of MKK7 was sufficient to prevent excitotoxicity in vitro as well
as cerebral ischemia in two different in vivo models.2,4,39
This confirms that excitotoxicity/cerebral ischemia leads to
activation of MKK7/JNK pathway, without activating
MKK4/JNK. Importantly, GADD45β-I still prevented neuronal
death after 1 week from the lesion, proving that the peptide
really blocks neuronal death program after lesion and not just
postpone it in time.
Compared with D-JNKI1 (specific inhibitor of all JNKs
isoforms),2 GADD45β-I reduced the infarct volume by 45%,
whereas D-JNKI1 reduced by 93% at the same temporal
window (6 h); both peptides block neuronal death. The
advantage of inhibiting MKK7 (GADD45β-I), instead of JNK
(D-JNKI1), lies in the fact that the JNK physiological role,
controlled by MKK4,43 is preserved with GADD45β-I treatment
Conclusions
GADD45β − I is markedly neuroprotective against in-vitro
excitotoxicity and OGD in cortical neurons, and more
importantly against two experimental stroke models.
GADD45β − I specifically decreases MKK7 phosphorylation/
activation and reduces the infarct volume by 45–50% at 24 h
post lesion, when injected 6 h post ischemia. GADD45β − I
(injected 6 h post ischemia) reduces infarct volume by 49% at
1 week after lesion, proving that GADD45β − I is able to
inhibit and not just postpone neuronal death after ischemia.
We therefore conclude that this agent offers great promise for
developing therapies for cerebral ischemia.
Materials and Methods
Modeling and docking design. Up to now the three-dimensional structure
of GADD45β is not available and for this reason it has been obtained through
homology modeling, using as a template the structure of the GADD45α (Protein
Data Bank (PDB) ID: 2KGA)44 sharing 60% of identity with our sequence of
interest.14 After the modeling, the structure obtained has been minimized for 1000
step using the Steepest Descent algorithm.45 The atomic coordinates of MKK7 have
been solved and are available in the PDB (PDB ID: 2DYL), but the residues
composing the three loops, 143–148, 282–296 and 307–314, are lacking. These
regions have been modeled using the loops databank of the Swiss PDB viewer
Version 4.1 program.46
In order to predict the GADD45β–MKK7 complex, 100 runs of docking using the
HADDOCK web server,47 in particular suitable for the protein–protein docking, have
been carried out. The results of the docking runs have been clustered based on the
RMSD criterion, using a 4.5-Å cutoff. The best GADD45β–MKK7 complex has been
chosen by considering the HADDOCK score, which is calculated according to the

Exploring the role of MKK7

11
weighted sum of various energy terms: van der Waals, electrostatic, restraints,
diffusion anisotropy, dihedral angle restraints, symmetry restraints, buried surface
area, binding and desolvation energies (see the HADDOCK manual for further
information47). Docking simulations of the GADD45β–MKK7 have generated 10
families, where the cluster with the best HADDOCK score contains 60% of total
complexes generated after the 100 runs. The best structure of this cluster has been
selected for the study of the interaction between GADD45β and MKK7 in order to
design the peptides.
Peptide synthesis. The synthetic peptides TAT-GADD45β69–86 (aminoacidic
sequence: 5′-IALQIHFTLIQSFCCDNDGRKKRRQRRR-NH2-3′) and TAT-spacerGADD45β60–86 (aminoacidic sequence: 5′-DEEEEDDIALQIHFTLIQSFCCDNDAGA
GAAAGRKKRRQRRR-NH2-3′) were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis
method using a multiple peptide synthesizer (SyroII, MultiSynTech GmbH, Witten,
Germany) on 4-(2’,4’-dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-aminomethyl)-phenoxyacetamido
norleucyl-MBHA resin (100–200 mesh) (Novabiochem). The fluoren-9ylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) strategy48 was used throughout the peptide chain
assembly, using O-(7-Azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N,N-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate as the coupling reagent.49 The side-chain-protected amino acid building
blocks used were as follows: N-a-Fmoc-Nω-(2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl)-L-arginine, N-a-Fmoc-g-tert-butyl-L-glutamic acid, N-a-Fmoc-β-tertbutyl-L-aspartic acid, N-a-Fmoc-O-tert-butyl-L-serine, Na-Fmoc-O-tert-butyl-L-threonine, N-a-Fmoc-Ne-(tert-butyloxycarbonyl)-L-lysine, N-a-Fmoc-N(im)-trityl-L-histidine, N-a-Fmoc-N-g-trityl-L-glutamine, N-a-Fmoc-S-trityl-cystine and N-a-Fmoc-Nβ-trityl-L-asparagine. Cleavage of the peptides was performed by reacting the
peptidyl resins with a mixture containing TFA/ethanedithiol/phenol 5% for 2.5–3 h.
Crude peptides were purified by a preparative reverse-phase HPLC. Molecular
masses of the peptides were confirmed by mass spectroscopy on a MALDI
TOF–TOF mass spectrometer (model 4800, AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA).
The purity of the peptides was in the range 90–95% as evaluated by analytical
reverse-phase HPLC.
SPR analyses. Binding studies were performed on a ProteOn XPR36 Protein
Interaction Array system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Detection of
GADD45β69–86 interaction with MKK7 was performed by immobilizing ~ 5000
resonance units (RUs) of human recombinant full-length MKK7 (residues M1-R419,
as in NCBI/Protein entry NP_660186.1; ProQinase GmbH, Freiburg, Germany) on
the surface of a sensor chip (GL-C chip, Bio-Rad) by amine-coupling chemistry.
GADD45β69–86 molecules were then perfused over the chip for 150 s to allow
association, followed by 500 s buffer (PBST) wash to monitor dissociation. Signals
were normalized to control channels containing ~ 5000 RUs of bovine serum
albumin or no proteins. The resulting sensorgrams were fitted to a heterogenous
ligand binding model using the ProteOn analysis software, to obtain the
corresponding association and dissociation rate constants (kon and koff,
respectively) and the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD).
Cortical neuronal culture. Cortical pieces were dissected from the brains of
2-day-old rat pups, incubated with 200 U of papain for 30 min at 34 °C and, after
trypsin inhibitor (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) treatment (1%, 45 min at room
temperature), were mechanically dissociated. Neurons were then plated at densities
of ~ 5 × 105 cells/plate on 3.5-mm tissue culture dishes (BD, San Jose, CA, USA)
and 5 × 104 cells/plate on 95-well culture plates (SPL Life Sciences, Pocheon, South
Korea) all pre-coated with 10 μg/ml poly-D-lysine (Sigma Aldrich) and 2 μg/ml
laminine (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The plating medium consisted
of Neurobasal Medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 2% B27
(Life Technologies), 50 mM glutamine (Life Technologies) and 1000 U/ml
penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies). Experiments were performed after 11–
13 days in culture, at which time the neurons had elaborate axonal and dendritic
arbors, and had formed many synapses. GADD45β inhibitors were added to the
dishes at the desired concentrations, 30 min before NMDA treatment (100 μM,
Abcam, Cambridge, UK).
All experimental procedures on animals were done in accordance with the
European Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/EEC) and all
efforts were made to minimize animal suffering.
Oxygen–glucose deprivation. OGD was performed on cortical neurons
maintained in an Hypoxia Incubator Chamber (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver,
BC, Canada) for 12 h; during the first 4 min, oxygen in the chamber was replaced by

a mixture of 95% N2 5% CO2; glucose deprivation was realized by substituting
culture medium with glucose-free Neurobasal Medium (Life Technologies).
Peptides administration. All treated rats underwent ICV administration
(−1 AP, +2 ML, − 3 DV), 30 min before or 6 h post lesion, of GADD45β-I (11 μg/μl)
ipsilaterally to the lesion. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% during
induction, then maintained with 1.5%) in a mixture of 30:70 O2/N2O and placed
in a Stereotaxic Apparatus (Stoelting, 51600, Wood Dale, IL, USA). Injection
(2 μl volume) was made with a graduate glass pipette through an osmotic pump to
minimize side effects.
LDH cytotoxicity assay. Neuroprotection was evaluated by an LDH assay.
LDH released into the bathing medium 5–24 h after NMDA was measured using the
Cytotox 96 non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA),
according to the manufacturer’s indications.
Western blot analysis. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and
transferred to a PVDF membrane. Incubation with primary antibodies was overnight
at 4 °C using the following: 1 : 1000 anti-MKK7 (4172, Cell Signaling Technology,
Beverly, MA, USA), 1 : 1000 anti-P-MKK7 (4171, Cell Signaling Technology),
1 : 1000 anti-MKK4 (07-194 Upstate, Charlottesville, VA, USA), 1 : 1000 anti-PMKK4 (9151, Cell Signaling Technology), 1 : 1000 anti-JNK (9252S, Cell Signaling
Technology) and 1 : 1000 anti-P-JNK (9252S, Cell Signaling Technology). All
P-antibodies, P-MKK7, P-MKK4 and P-JNK, are specific and recognize only the
phosphorylated form of these proteins (they do not recognize cortical neuronal
extracts dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase overnight). In a single
experiment, a very large number of neurons were analyzed, providing very
consistent results, and the blots were all normalized with respect to actin (1 : 10 000
anti-actin, 1501 Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Blots were developed using
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti mouse IgGHRP and goat anti rabbit IgG-HRP, both from Santa-Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and the ECL chemiluminescence system (Promega).
Quantification. The quantification of western blottings was performed using
ImageQuant TL software (Amersham Biosciences, Amersham, UK) and was based
on at least three independent experiments.
Ischemic models
Ethical statement: Male adult Sprague–Dawley rats (Harlan, Lesmo, Italy)
weighing 270–350 g were used in this study. All animal experimental procedures
were approved and carried out in accordance to the European Community Council
Directive 86/609/EEC (24 November 1986), Italian Ministry of Health and University
of Turin institutional guidelines on animal welfare (law 116/92 on Care and
Protection of living animals undergoing experimental or other scientific procedures;
authorization number 17/2010-B, 30 June 2010) and ad-hoc Ethical Committee of
the University of Turin. Free access to food and water was maintained and all efforts
were made to minimize suffering and limit the number of animals used.
Part I. Ischemia reperfusion (n = 43). The MCA was cauterized by the method
described by Renolleau et al.50 Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% during
induction, then maintained with 1.5%), in a mixture of 30 : 70 O2/N2O delivered with a
face mask throughout the surgery duration. Briefly, under an operating microscope
(Nikon, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy), a midline incision of the head was performed, the
temporal muscle dissected and the temporal bone exposed; a burr hole was drilled
very close to the zygomatic arch and the left MCA was identified. The MCA main
branch was then electrocoagulated close to its origin at the junction with the olfactory
branch. Thereafter, a median incision was made in the neck to expose the left
common carotid artery (CCA), which was transiently occluded by a clip in order to
reduce infarct size variability due to anastomoses in the MCA territory. After 90 min,
the clip was removed. Successful occlusion was confirmed by progressive whitening
of the cortex. Animals were initially killed 24 h post lesion. To further confirm the
neuroprotective effect of our MKK7 inhibitor at a chronic condition, the same
experimental groups were replicated but the animals were killed 7 days after lesion. In
another set of experiments, control (n = 3) and treated (n = 3) rats were killed 6 h post
surgery, to analyze the p-JNK/JNK ratio and MKK7/4 activation by western blotting.
Part II. Thromboembolic ischemia (n = 7). Ischemia was induced by injection of
autologous blood clots in suspension into the internal carotid artery (ICA), as
described by Busch et al.51 In order to prepare blood clots for embolism, femoral
Cell Death and Disease

arterial blood from a donor rat was collected into a 20-cm long PE-50 catheter and
retained for 2 h at room temperature, and subsequently at 4 °C for 22 h to allow clot
formation to go to completion. Clots were pushed out of the catheter with a salinefilled syringe, rinsed several times in a Petri dish containing phosphate-buffered
solution (PBS, pH 7.4), in order to remove blood cells and obtain a white clot, then
inspected under the microscope to select fibrin-rich fragments. These fragments
were cut into 2-mm-long pieces and transferred into a solution containing 1 mg/ml
albumin in PBS, to allow clot retraction. Approximately 2 h later, 20 fibrin-rich
fragments were drawn up in the albumin solution in 1-m-long PE50 catheter, taking
care to maintain ~ 3 cm distance between clots in order to keep them apart, and all
embolized into MCA origin.
Surgical procedures: Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% during
induction, then maintained with 1.75%), in a mixture of 30 : 70 O2/N2O delivered
with a face mask throughout the surgery duration. After a longitudinal incision of
2 cm in length in the midline of the ventral cervical skin, left CCA, ICA and external
carotid artery (ECA) were carefully dissected and exposed, avoiding any damage to
the adjacent vagus nerve. Inferior thyroid and occipital arteries, branching from the
ECA, were visualized and cauterized; the distal portion of ECA was ligated and cut
along with the terminal lingual and maxillary artery branches, and the carotid
bifurcation identified. ICA was dissected cranially up to the origin of pterygopalatin
branch, which was ligated using a 6/0 suture. A 5-0 silk suture was loosely tied
around the origin of ECA, and then the CCA and ICA were temporarily clamped
using microvascular clips. A PE-50 catheter, containing blood clot suspension, with
a modified 0.3-mm outer diameter, was introduced into the ECA stump through a
small puncture and advanced 1–2 mm beyond carotid bifurcation; the 5/0 suture
was tightened around the catheter to prevent backflow bleeding. The clip around
ICA was removed and clots injected within 30 s, whereas CCA was still occluded. At
the end of injection, the catheter was withdrawn, the ECA stump was ligated and the
CCA clip removed, so that blood pressure could push clots cranially. The wound
was then closed; the rat was allowed to completely recover from anesthesia and
returned to its cage. The surgery was complete in ~ 30 min.
Functional neuroscore: Functional outcome was tested at 2 and 24 h by
observers blinded to the pharmacological regimen. A 5-point scale described by
Longa et al.52 was used (grade 0: no neurological deficit; grade 1: failure to fully
extend left forepaw; grade 2: contralateral circling; grade 3: contralateral falling;
grade 4: absence of spontaneous movement or unconsciousness). The neuroscore
was also used to further confirm that successful thrombotic occlusion had been
achieved, as the existence of initial neurological deficit is a reliable predictor for
successful occlusion of the MCA;53,54 only animals grade 1 or higher at 2 h were
included in the study. Exclusion of animals took place before assignment into the
various treatment groups.
Functional neuroscore was also assessed 7 days after surgery in animals lesioned
with MCAo.
Determination of infarct volumes: At 24 h, the animals were euthanized,
brains were removed, cooled on ice and then coronally cut into 2-mm-thick sections
using a tissue slicer, starting from 2 mm caudal to the frontal tip. Sections were
immediately stained with 2% TTC (Sigma) at 37 °C for 10 min, then fixed in 4%
phosphate-buffered formalin as previously described.55 Each slice was examined for
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Slices were scanned with a Coolpix camera (Nikon);
infarct volume and brain edema were measured using NIH ImageJ analysis
software (available at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Ischemic volumes were calculated as
the sum of infarcted area (in mm2) multiplied by slice thickness (~2 mm). Edema
volumes were calculated by subtracting the contralateral hemisphere volume from
the ischemic hemisphere volume; for edema correction, the equation ischemic
volume × contralateral hemisphere/ipsilateral hemisphere volume was used, as
previously described.56 Seven 2-mm-thick slices were measured for each brain.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was done using Stat-View software.
Data were calculated as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were compared
using Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVA, followed by
Dunnett’s or Tukey’s test. P-values o0.05 were considered significant.
