ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular therapy is an emerging treatment option in patients with acute ischemic stroke and
especially in cases presenting late after symptom onset. Information about remaining viable tissue as measured with perfusion imaging is
crucial for proper patient selection. The aim of this study was to investigate whether perfusion imaging with C-arm CT in the angiography
suite is feasible and provides measurements comparable with ones made by CTP.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MCA was occluded surgically in 6 sheep. Perfusion studies were performed before surgery, immediately
after, and at 3 hours after MCA occlusion by using a robotic ﬂat panel detector C-arm angiographic system. For comparison, conventional
CTP was performed at the same time points. Two different protocols with the C-arm CT were tested. Images were analyzed by 2 readers
with regard to the presence and size of perfusion abnormalities.
RESULTS: With C-arm CT, perfusion abnormalities were detected with a high sensitivity and speciﬁcity when vessel occlusion was
conﬁrmed by criterion standard DSA. No difference was found between lesions sizes measured with the 2 C-arm CT protocols and CTP.
Growth of the CBV lesions with time was captured with C-arm CT and CTP.
CONCLUSIONS: In this small study, it was feasible to qualitatively measure CBV and CBF by using a ﬂat panel detector angiographic system.

S

troke is a major cause of death and disability throughout the
world. IV thrombolysis within 4.5 hours of symptom onset
remains the only therapy with benefit for patients so far, as proved
by randomized trials.1-3 However, the results of studies investigating endovascular approaches indicate that the outcome of patients with large-artery occlusions may be improved in comparison with IV thrombolysis.4-8
Perfusion measurements are useful in selecting patients most
likely to benefit from revascularization because they provide information about the ratio of infarct core to penumbra. This is
especially true for those patients presenting outside the therapeutic time window for IV thrombolysis.

Despite the potential value of MR imaging or CTP measurements, these studies are often not performed because there is no
solid evidence that they improve outcome, there is a significant
time cost in obtaining the measurements, and they only provide a
snapshot of a dynamic process.9 The ability to obtain these measurements in the angiography suite would eliminate the last 2 objections.
Several experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that
measurement of CBV is feasible by using C-arm CT.10-12 More recently, CBF was measured in healthy swine and canines with such a
system.13,14 We report our experience using a modified C-arm system to measure steady-state CBV and also to make dynamic measurements of CBF in an experimental sheep stroke model.

Creation of Stroke
The experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines and with written consent of the local ethics authorities.
Stroke was successfully created surgically in 6 of 7 German Blackheaded sheep (1 animal died during surgery from ventricular fibrillation). For surgery, the animals were placed in a supine position on the angiography table. General anesthesia was inducted
with propofol; isoflurane was used for maintenance. Vital parameters were monitored continuously. Surgery was necessary because in sheep, the ICA develops from a rete mirabile, which is

by using the laser guide. After contrast injection, the scan was started and the contrast bolus was followed for 60 seconds
with 1 acquisition every second.
Identical injection parameters were
used for C-arm CT and CTP: IV administration of 42-mL iomeprol (Iomeron 400;

euthanized.

Data Acquisition
CBV and CBF perfusion measurements were performed with Carm CT and with a conventional CT scanner. The C-arm of the
flat panel angiography system is mounted on a robot arm (Artis
zeego; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), which, due to modifications
of the software configuration, allows very fast serial forward and
backward rotations, with data acquisition in both directions.
With C-arm CT, 2 different protocols were tested. Each comprised 7 rotations (sweeps) of the C-arm before and after contrast
administration (baseline and fill runs). The main differences between the 2 protocols lie in the duration of sweeps and the number of
projections per rotation. The parameters for the first protocol (slow
scan) were as follows: 7 sweeps with a duration of 4.43 seconds each;
a 1.57-second pause between 2 sweeps; rotation angle, 200°; rotation
speed, 60° per second; 248 projections per rotation; angulation step,
0.8°/frame. The second protocol (fast scan) also comprised 7 sweeps,
but with a duration of 2.83 seconds each; a 1.57-second pause between rotations; rotation angle, 200°; rotation speed, 100° per second; 133 projections per rotation; angulation step, 1.5°/frame. The
x-ray tube voltage was 90 kV in both protocols.
For CTP, a Somatom Emotion 6 (Siemens) was used. The
animals were placed on the CT table in a supine position. The

Number of Datasets
Of 84 possible datasets in 7 sheep, only 60 (22 before and 38 after
surgery) were evaluated (Table 1). Reasons for exclusion of data
were death from cardiac failure during surgery (n ⫽ 12), failed
vessel occlusion (n ⫽ 8), failed contrast injection (n ⫽ 2), and
inability to open the datasets (n ⫽ 2). Because reconstruction of
the data with the prototype software was time-consuming and
performed after completion of the protocol, the failed contrast
injection and the corruption of datasets were not observed during
the course of the procedure. In the case of failed vessel occlusion,
DSA could not confirm the success of the surgery. The reason was
formation of a blood clot around a catheter that was left in the
arteries feeding the rete mirabile for postsurgical DSA. As a result,
ipsilateral DSA did not show intracranial vessels and contralateral
DSA was not sufficient to depict the vessels on the operated side.
Perfusion studies were performed nevertheless because the neurosurgeon was confident that the MCA was occluded.

Postprocessing and Data Analysis
The CTP data were calculated by using commercially available
software (VPCT; Siemens) and also with prototype software

developed and provided by Siemens.16 This calculation was performed to find out whether the different software implementations would yield similar results with the same data and also to
avoid a bias of one algorithm over the other. The data acquired
with the C-arm CT were only compatible with the prototype software. So, at every time point (before surgery, immediately and 3
hours after surgery) 4 datasets, each consisting of 1 CBV and 1
CBF color map, were acquired per animal (Fig 2). MTT and TTP
were not calculated because the prototype software was not optimized for these parameters.
The arterial input function was chosen manually at the ICA
close to the site where it originates from the rete mirabile or the
MCA on the side opposite the MCA occlusion (Fig 3). Both the
time-attenuation curves and the arterial input functions are undersampled because of the limited temporal resolution (slow rotation) of the C-arm. Specifically, there is only 1 measurement
time point per sweep. The intermediate values for all 1-second
steps were determined by a bicubic spline interpolation.
Positioning of the head of the animals in the angiographic
system was different from that in the CT scanner to allow uninhibited rotation of the C-arm. This required reformatting to generate comparable images concerning section orientation and
thickness. Anatomic detail in the perfusion maps acquired was
not sufficient to allow automatic registration, so matching of the
CT and C-arm images had to be performed on a syngo worksta1742

tion (Siemens) on a visual basis by an experienced neuroradiologist who did not take part in the evaluation. The volume datasets
acquired with the C-arm system were displayed on the workstation and adjusted by using reference lines, so that the final axial
images paralleled the frontal lobe as it did in the CT images. The
result of this procedure was directly compared with the timely
matching CTP images of the same animal and was further corrected, if necessary, to achieve the best possible agreement.
After anonymization, the color maps were transferred to a
certified OsiriX PRO workstation (aycan Digitalsysteme, Würzburg, Germany). They were randomly presented with regard to
the time of acquisition and animal subject and were evaluated by
2 experienced neuroradiologists who were blinded to the surgical
status. Each neuroradiologist was asked to decide whether perfusion abnormalities were present, and if present, to measure the
size in the section exhibiting the largest lesion on a visual basis.

Statistical Analysis
Interobserver reliability was calculated by using the Cohen ␬ value
and was classified according to the Landis and Koch17 scale. Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of perfusion deficits, with
DSA-proved vessel occlusion serving as the criterion standard,
were determined for each protocol and for both readers. For comparison of the measured sizes of the perfusion lesion, a 2-tailed
Student t test was applied to search for differences between the 2
readers. A pair-wise testing was performed to compare the different protocols.

RESULTS
Interobserver agreement was “substantial” for the fast scan (␬ ⫽
0.72), “almost perfect” for the slow scan (␬ ⫽ 0.86), and “perfect”
for CTP (␬ ⫽ 1.00). Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of
perfusion lesions with the different protocols for both readers are
outlined in Table 2. With regard to the C-arm protocols, specificity was higher and sensitivity was lower for the fast rather than the
slow scans for both readers. For the data obtained with CTP and

DISCUSSION
In ischemic stroke, several factors influence patient outcome. These comprise,
among others, time from symptom onset
to recanalization, collateral flow, thrombus size, and location of the vessel occlusion. IV thrombolysis is the standard
therapy for patients without contraindications and presenting within 4.5 hours
after symptom onset, but endovascular
therapy may be more effective in patients
with occlusion of major cerebral arteries.
Additionally, several works indicate that
interventional recanalization might be

reader 2 tended to measure a smaller size for all lesions might be
the effect of evaluating datasets of the whole brain. Different sections might have been chosen. However, a more conservative approach to measurement might be taken into account as well.
Size differences between CBF and CBV lesions were measured
at both time points, and CBV lesions were larger after 3 hours than
immediately after surgery. These size differences of the CBV lesions were significant with all protocols. This finding probably
reflects growth of the infarct core with time. That enlargement of
CBV lesions found in all protocols and not only in CTP suggests
that C-arm CT might be capable of depicting changes of brain
perfusion, even if small. This possibility might have an impact on
treatment decisions. Perfusion measurement with C-arm CT can
be performed not only before therapy but at any time during
endovascular stroke intervention. There are thus scenarios in
which this information might influence treatment decisions. One
such situation could be a difficult intervention with partial recanalization. If no improvement of functional outcome can be expected, the intervention might as well be terminated so that the
patient is not exposed to unnecessary risk of complications due to
the intervention. In addition, stent placement in the acute phase
with all its negative consequences such as dual-antiplatelet therapy might be avoided if perfusion maps indicate a large infarct
with little viable parenchyma. Of course, the presented data cannot serve as a basis for validating the use of this technique for such
decisions. However, the encouraging results support further effort to reach the goal of making stroke imaging in the angiography
suite feasible. C-arm CT already allows the exclusion of intracranial hemorrhage in many cases, and intracranial vessels can be
well-depicted.23-26 Also, measurement of CBV was feasible by using a C-arm CT.10-12 The described technique may additionally
provide information about dynamic perfusion parameters.
There are several limitations in this study. First, only a small
number of animals were examined. Therefore, the results should
be interpreted with caution concerning statistical significance.
Nevertheless, a positive trend with regard to lesion detection
seems to exist. The complete and irreversible occlusion of a major
intracranial artery led to large CBV lesions already in the early
phase. Therefore, their enlargement was only slight, and significance might have occurred by chance. Therefore, whether progression of the core infarct can be depicted with C-arm CT remains unclear with this small sample number.
Second, we did not quantify perfusion changes. One reason
was that the slow temporal sampling rate leads to an underestimation of the arterial input function; consequently, because CBF
values are inversely proportional to the area under the arterial
input function, CBF would have been overestimated.27 Moreover,
our focus was to find out whether assessment of dynamic perfusion parameters was feasible in a new large-animal model. However, quantification is possible as was demonstrated by Ganguly et
al.13 They stated that CBF measured with C-arm cone beam CT
correlated well with that from CTP, but in this work, multiple
injections and multiple acquisitions were performed to overcome
the temporal resolution limits of the C-arm system, whereas we
chose a protocol with a single injection and only 1 fill run.
Third, we chose sheep for our experiments because the technique of surgical occlusion was described and sheep have a larger,

gyrencephalic brain, as opposed to that in most other animal
stroke models. However, we were not aware that the attenuated
bony anatomy of the sheep skull would cause such marked streak
artifacts compared with humans. We did not appreciate this
drawback during the experiments because postprocessing was
performed after having completed the protocol for the animal.
When we realized the occurrence of these artifacts, we initially
tried to eliminate other possible causes like movement induced by
the ventilation tube, exact centering of the brain, or minimizing
overlying material needed for anesthesia. The artifacts were more
pronounced in the fast scans. Although image quality was not
assessed systematically, these artifacts might explain the lower
sensitivity compared with the other protocols.
Finally, to ensure the best possible image quality, we chose a
high-system x-ray dose. It is likely that new system hardware and
advanced software will provide further dose reduction in the future. A dose measurement with an Alderson phantom is being
planned.

CONCLUSIONS
With the described technique, we demonstrated that measurement of CBV and, additionally, CBF as a dynamic perfusion parameter is feasible by using the novel C-arm system. Information
about brain perfusion considered helpful in modern concepts of
diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke may be derived
with the same device. This small study supports the effort of further development of a technique that may have the potential to
improve management of patients with acute severe stroke by saving time from diagnosis to treatment and by adding information
for proper patient selection.
