Ethnopharmacological relevance: The An-Gong-Niu-Huang Wan (AGNH), a Chinese traditional medicine,
has been used for treatment of cerebral diseases for centuries in China and other Asian countries, and is
approved by the State Food and Drug Administration of China for the treatment of stroke. The aim of
present study is to test the neuroprotective effects of AGNH on cerebral ischemia in rats and to explore
the underlying mechanisms.
Materials and methods: 75 Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: sham,
ischemia–reperfusion (I/R), and I/R plus 0.065 g/kg/d AGNH, 0.125 g/kg/d AGNH and 0.25 g/kg/d AGNH.
Cerebral ischemia was induced by 1.5 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Neurological
functional deﬁcits were evaluated according to Zea longa's score, cerebral infarct area was measured by
tetrazolium staining. Cell injury and apoptosis were assessed by Nissl staining and DNA fragmentation
assay. The expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 were analyzed by Western blot.
Results: Rats subjected to MCAO exhibited worsened neurological score, infarct area, cell damage and
apoptosis. These were all attenuated by AGNH (0.125 and 0.25 g/kg/d). Moreover, AGNH reversed
cerebral ischemia induced decreases in Bcl-2 expression and increases in Bax and caspase-3 expression.
Conclusions: These results suggest that AGNH exerts neuroprotective effects, and the neuroprotection is
likely to relate to depressed Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 level, leading to inhibition of apoptotic
cell death.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke, caused by a reduction or complete blockade of
blood ﬂow to regions of the brain, remains a leading cause of
death and disability worldwide. Ischemic stroke shows a complex
pathophysiologcal course that involves a plethora of distinct
molecular and cellular pathways (Dirnagl et al., 1999; Wardlaw
et al., 1997). Cell apoptosis, as a critical event during cerebral
ischemia, mostly locates in the ischemic penumbra, which is
potentially salvageable (Fisher, 2004; Ferrer and Planas, 2003;
Zhao et al., 2011). Bcl-2 family proteins play crucial roles in the

intrinsic signaling, activated caspase family proteins further lead to
promote DNA fragment (Ferrer and Planas, 2003; Broughton et al.,
2009). After cerebral ischemia, apoptotic signaling cascades were
launched (Ferrer and Planas, 2003; Broughton et al., 2009).
Current research about stroke were to search a patent medicine
or strategy to inhibit neuron apoptosis (Ferrer and Planas, 2003;
Guegan et al., 2006; Li et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2011).
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) as an alternative approach
for human health has a long history and accumulated extensive
clinical experience in treating stroke with indigenous herbal
materials. TCM has been widely used in ethnic communities and
it is recognized as an attractive alternative to conventional
medicine. An-Gong-Niu-Huang Wan (AGNH), a classic traditional
prescription, was ﬁrst documented in Wen Bing Tiao Bian, a
classical work of TCM written in the Ming dynasty. As the theory
of TCM is concerned, this medication functions to clear heat,

detoxify, relieve convulsion and resuscitate (2010). At present,
AGNH has been widely used for acute and chronic cerebral
diseases, such as stroke, viral encephalitis, and severe craniocerebral trauma (Lu et al., 2011). Given to its perfect clinical effects,
AGNH is approved by the State Food and Drug Administration of
China for the treatment of stroke (state medical license No.
Z33020160). However, there is little known about the neuroprotective effects of AGNH and the underlying mechanisms.
Thus, in the present study, we tested the neuroprotection of
AGNH on focal cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO), and investigated whether it exerted the
neuroprotection by inhibiting apoptosis. In addition, we examined
the effects of AGNH on Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3 expressions in the
ischemic penumbra of brain.

2.4. Transient focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion model
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) as described previously (Longa et al., 1989). Brieﬂy,
rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, i.p.) and the
left common carotid artery (CCA), the external carotid artery (ECA),
and the internal carotid artery (ICA) were exposed. A length of
3.0 monoﬁlament nylon suture (18.5–19.5 mm), determined by the
weight of the animal, with its tip rounded by heating near a ﬂame,
was advanced from the ECA into the lumen of the ICA until it blocked
the origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). 1.5 h after MCAO
animals were reanesthetized with halothane, and reperfusion was
initiated by withdrawal of the suture until the tip cleared the lumen
of the ECA. Sham-operated animals were subjected to the same
surgical procedure but the suture was not introduced.
2.5. Evaluation of neurological deﬁcits

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
All experiments were performed on adult male SpragueDawley rats (Experimental Animal Center, Zhongshan Hospital,
Fudan University, China) weighing 250–280 g. One hundred
twenty rats were kept in groups of four and maintained on a
12:12 h light: dark cycle at a constant room temperature of 21 1C
with free access to food and water. The experimental protocols and
animal handling procedures were approved by the Animal Care
and Use Committee (ACUC) of Fudan University and were consistent with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals.

2.2. Drug
The An-Gong-Niu-Huang Wan (AGNH) was manufactured by
Huqingyutang Co., Ltd (Hangzhou, China). It is composed of Bubali
Cornu (horn of Bubalus bubalis Linnaeus), Bovis Calculus (gallstones of Bas taurus domesticus Gmelin), Cinnabar (Cinnabaris),
Rabiagar (Realgar), Scutellariae Radix (root of Scutellaria baicalensis
Georgi), Coptidis Rhizoma (root of Coptis chinensis Franch.), Curcumae Radix (root of Curcuma wenyujin Y.H. Chen et C. Ling),
Gardeniae Fructus (fruit of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis), Margarita
[pearl of Herbaceous Cumingii (Lea)], Moschus (secretion in sachet
of Moschus berezovskii Flerov), Borneolum Syntheticum (resin of
Dryobalanpos aromatica Gaertner f.) in a 8:4:4:4:4:4:4:4:2:2:1
weight ratio. These materials were originally ground to a ﬁne
powder by a micronizer and prepared as capsules, which were
authenticated and standardized on the basis of marker compounds
in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2010 (National Pharmacopoeia
Committee, 2010).

2.3. Drug administration
For AGNH treatment, the common human daily dose of AGNH
is 1.5 g/75 kg bodyweight. According to the formula:
drat ¼dhuman  0.7/0.11 (Huang et al., 2004), the common dose of
AGNH in rat should be 0.125 g/kg/day. We therefore selected
0.065, 0.125, and 0.25 g/kg/day as the low, medium, and high
dosages. The rats in the AGNH treated groups were intragastrically
administered appropriate doses of AGNH each day for 3 d before
ischemia induction and 1 d after reperfusion until sacriﬁce at
conclusion of the experiment. Other rats were given the same
volume of distilled water.

Evaluation of neurological deﬁcits was performed at 24 h after
reperfusion (n ¼8–10). Deﬁcits were scored on a ﬁve-point scale
adapted from a previous publication (Longa et al., 1989). 0, no
neurological deﬁcit (normal); 1, mild neurological deﬁcit (failure to
lift forepaw fully); 2, moderate neurological deﬁcit (circling to the
left); 3, severe neurological deﬁcit (falling to the left); and 4, very
severe neurological deﬁcit (failure to walk spontaneously,
depressed level of consciousness). MCAO rats showed no detectable neurological deﬁcits were excluded from the analysis to
exclude operative failures.
2.6. Measurement of cerebral infarct area
Rats were sacriﬁced after 24 h of reperfusion and their brains
were isolated for estimation of infarct area (n ¼5). As described
previously (Xiang et al., 2010a), the rats were sacriﬁced under
deep anesthesia, brains were removed immediately and sectioned
into 2 mm slices. Samples were placed in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyl
tetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma, USA) stain for 15 min at 37 1C.
The brain tissue was differentiated according to white-colored
infarct area and red–purple non-infarct area. Cerebral infarct areas
were measured using microscope image-analysis software (ImagePro plus, USA). The ratio of infarct area to total brain area was
calculated.
2.7. Histologic procedures
At 24 h after reperfusion, the rats were deep anesthetized with
10% chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused transcardially
with 200 ml normal saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
(0.1 M phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4). The brains were
removed and postﬁxed in the same ﬁxative for 24 h at 4 1C. After
dehydration in graded ethanol and xylene, the brains were
embedded in parafﬁn and sectioned into slices of 5 μm on a rotary
microtome. To assess brain injury, Nissl staining was performed
with toluidine blue. Brieﬂy, slices were dewaxed, dehydrated, and
stained with 1% toluidine blue (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)
at 50 1C for 30 min. Then the slices were rinsed and cleared in
graded ethanol and xylene and coverslipped under permount. The
photomicrographs were captured with a light microscope (Olympus/BX51, Tokyo, Japan). And the number of intact cells in
penumbra of ischemic cortex was counted throughout ﬁve lesion
regions randomly.
2.8. Immunoﬂuorescence and TUNEL staining
Immunoﬂuorescence labeling with anti-NeuN antibody (1:100;
Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) and TUNEL staining with an in situ

158

Cell Death Detecting Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg,
Germany) was performed as previously described (Lan et al.,
2013). Brieﬂy, the brain slices were blocked with goat serum for
1 h and incubated with primary antibody at 4 1C overnight. The
slices were washed with PBS for 5 min  3 and incubated with
secondary antibodies for 60 min (light shielded) at 37 1C. For
TUNEL staining, the slices were incubated with TUNEL reaction
mixture in a dark humidiﬁed chamber at 37 1C for 1 h, after
washing with PBS, slices were counter stained with DAPI (Beyotime, Haimen, Jiangsu, China) for 15 min and then covered with
glycerine. The captured images were viewed with a ﬂuorescence
microscope (Olympus/BX51, Tokyo, Japan). The stained cells in
penumbra of ischemic cortex were counted throughout ﬁve lesion
regions randomly.
2.9. Western blotting analysis
Western blotting was used to assess the expression of caspase-3,
Bax and Bcl-2 at 24 h after reperfusion. The ischemic hemisphere
tissues were prepared in lysis buffer with protease inhibitors
(Beyotime, Haimen, Jiangsu, China) and centrifuged at 13,000  g
for 5 min. The supernatant was collected. Protein concentrations
were determined with a BCA kit (Beyotime). Fifty micrograms of
protein solution were separated by electrophoresis in different
concentrations of polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). After
blocking for 2 h with a 5% solution of skim milk, prepared with
Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST), the primary antibodies polyclonal rabbit anti-caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 (all diluted
1:1000; Abcam, HK, China) were incubated with the membranes at
4 1C overnight. The membranes were incubated with the secondary
antibody conjugated with horseradish-peroxidase (Beyotime) after
washing with TBST three times for 10 min each. The targeted
antigens were detected by standard chemical luminescence methods (Beyotime) with Fluor Chem FC2 gel imaging system (Alpha
Innotech, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The expression of the targeted
proteins was determined by using the GADPH protein as a loading
control. Western blots were duplicated with three independent sets.
Band intensities were measured with Quantity One software (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).

treated rats were signiﬁcantly reduced (P o0.05). But AGNH-L
did not display the signiﬁcant protective effect compared with I/R
group (Fig. 2).

2.10. Statistical analysis
Values are presented as means 7SEM. Statistical signiﬁcance
was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey multiple
comparison test or unpaired Student's t-tests using SPSS 11.5
for Windows. Po 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical signiﬁcance.

Nissl staining revealed neuronal injury in ischemic penumbra
of cortex after 24 h of reperfusion. In the I/R group, most cells in
the ischemic cortex were reduced in size with increased intercellular space indicative of injury induced by ischemia. In the
ischemic penumbra of cortex there were signiﬁcantly more intact
cells in the AGNH (0.125 and 0.25 g/kg/d) treated groups compared
to the I/R group (Fig. 3).

3. Results

3.4. AGNH decreased cell apoptosis

3.1. AGNH ameliorated neurological deﬁcits

We analyzed cell apoptosis at 24 h after reperfusion by TUNEL
staining. The TUNEL positive cells were markedly increased in the
border zone of the ischemic cortex. While in the AGNH (0.125 and
0.25 g/kg/d) treated groups had signiﬁcantly reduced TUNELpositive staining than the I/R group, suggesting decreased apoptosis by AGNH treatment (Fig. 4A and B).

Neurological deﬁcit was evaluated at 24 h after reperfusion.
Compared with I/R group, the neurological scores were markedly
reduced in AGNH treated groups. Signiﬁcant difference was
observed at 24 h after reperfusion between Sham and AGNH
(0.125 and 0.25 g/kg/d) treated groups (Fig. 1).

3.5. AGNH inhibited neuron apoptosis
3.2. AGNH reduced infarct area
No infarction was observed in Sham group, while the rats
underwent MCAO showed extensive lesion in both striatum and
lateral cortex in I/R group at 24 h after reperfusion. Compared with
I/R group, the infarct areas of AGNH (0.125 and 0.25 g/kg/d)

We further evaluated neuron apoptosis at 24 h after reperfusion
by TUNEL and NeuN (neuron marker) double staining. The results
showed that the TUNEL positive neurons were markedly increased in
the border zone of the ischemic cortex. Compared with I/R group,
AGNH (0.125 and 0.25 g/kg/d) treatment signiﬁcantly reduced TUNEL

and NeuN double stained cells, suggesting inhibited neuron apoptosis (Fig. 4A and C).
3.6. AGNH upregulated Bcl-2 expression and downregulated Bax,
caspase-3 expression
90 min of cerebral ischemia followed by 24 h of reperfusion
induced the sharp increases in Bax and caspase 3 expression
levels, and a marked decrease in Bcl-2 expression. Compared with
I/R group, the expression of Bcl-2 was up-regulated and the
expressions of Bax and caspase-3 were down-regulated at 24 h
after reperfusion treated with AGNH (0.125 and 0.25 g/kg/d).
However, there were no signiﬁcant differences between I/R and
0.065 g/kg/d AGNH group (Fig. 5).

4. Discussion
We demonstrated that rats treated with AGNH (0.125 and
0.25 g/kg/d) had decreased infarct areas, improved neurological
outcomes and attenuated cell damage after focal cerebral ischemic
injury. Our ﬁndings supported the hypothesis that AGNH provided
neuroprotection through an anti-apoptotic mechanism, and this
effect was apparently related with regulating the expression of
apoptosis-related molecules.
Based on the symptoms and characteristics of patients and the
theories of TCM, Chinese medicinal formulations containing different type of plants and/or minerals are designed to improve
clinical efﬁcacy. The major therapeutic approach of TCM is to
collectively exert therapeutic actions and modulate other effects
using a mixture of herbs. In the prescription, the principal
constituents provide the main therapeutic actions, and the roles
of secondary principal constituents is to enhance or assist the
effects of the principal ones, while the rest serve modulation roles
such as treatment of accompanying symptoms, moderation of
harshness and toxicity, enhancement of the delivery of herbal

ingredients and harmonization. It is believed that various components which engage multiple targets exert synergistic therapeutic
effects.
AGNH as a patent drug to treat stroke in TCM, its active
compounds have been reported exert different properties which
are beneﬁcial to ischemic stroke. For instance, scutellaria baicalensis
signiﬁcantly protected CA1 neurons against forebrain ischemia and
inhibit TNF-α and nitric oxide production (Kim et al., 2001). Baicalin
sharply reduced infarction volume and decreased neurological deﬁcit
scores induced by 2 h of MCAO followed by reperfusion for 24 h (Xue
et al., 2010). Berberine has anti-inﬂammatory and anti-apoptosis
effects. Recent stroke studied indicated that berberine reduced
ischemic brain injury after pMACO, and increased the activation of
Akt/GSK signaling and claudin-5 expression, and decreased NFkappaB expression (Zhang et al., 2012). Berberine also decreased
the intracellular ROS level and inhibited cytochrome c release from
mitochondria and apoptosis-inducing factors (AIFs) expression
evoked by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) (Zhou et al., 2008). In
the clinic, cornu bubali was widely used to dispel heat, relieve
convulsion and cool blood. Evidence showed that cornu bubali has
antipyretic activity by enhancing anti-oxidation enzyme activities
(Liu et al., 2010). The studies showed that Bovis calculus compound
preparation could improve microcirculation, (Cai et al., 2007; Li et al.,
2010) and could enhance the tolerance of the tissues to hypoxia and
remove free radicals, regulate the neurotransmitters (Cai et al., 2007).
In view of the above ﬁndings, it is plausible to suggest that these
properties could contribute to the neuroprotective effects of AGNH
against injury induced by cerebral ischemia. In the present study,
cerebral infarct in the territory of middle cerebral artery was
identiﬁed by TTC staining and neurological deﬁcits scores were
evaluated after 24 h of reperfusion. It is interesting that AGNH
treatment could signiﬁcantly reduced cerebral infarct area. In addition, neurological deﬁcits scores were improved by AGNH. Nissl
staining suggested that AGNH alleviated the ischemic injury.
Brain cells that are compromised by ischemic insult can die
by necrosis or apoptosis (Lulli et al., 2010). Necrosis, which is

characterized by cellular swelling and lysis, involves the death
of a group of cells and evokes a signiﬁcant inﬂammatory response.
It is the predominant mechanism that follows acute, severe
ischemia. However, apoptosis, as a special programmed cell death
form, involves single cells and results in cell shrinkage and
apoptotic body formation, with subsequent phagocytosis by adjacent normal cells (Beilharz et al., 1995; Leist and Nicotera, 1998). In
milder injury, cell death takes place through a process that

resembles apoptosis, and mostly locates in the ischemic penumbra. Amounting evidence has indicated that ischemia-induced
cellular cascades including depletion of ATP, changes in intracellular ion content, release of excitatory amino acids, and oxidative
stress, are all thought to contribute to neuronal apoptosis in the
penumbra (Fisher, 2004; Lipton, 1999; Phan et al., 2002; Zhan et
al., 2001). The ischemic penumbra is the focus of the stroke
researches. It has been reported that drugs targeting apoptosis in

the penumbra can alleviate ischemic damage in stroke models
(Fisher, 2004; Lan et al., 2013; Phan et al., 2002; Schulz et al., 1999;
Xiang et al., 2010b; Zemke et al., 2004). In this study, histological
analysis revealed the presence of a large number of TUNELpositive cells with morphological apoptotic features in the periphery of the ischemia. In a dose-dependent manner, AGNH (0.125
and 0.25 g/kg/d) signiﬁcantly reduced cell damage and apoptosis
induced by ischemia. Double staining, i.e., TUNEL staining and
immunocytochemical labeling with antibodies against neuronal
nuclei, suggested that the TUNEL-positive cells were mostly
neurons. The data indicated that the neuron apoptosis was notably
inhibited by AGNH (0.125 and 0.25 g/kg/d) treatment.
Bcl-2, a gene located at chromosome 18q21, encodes a 26-kD
protein that blocks programmed cell death without affecting
cellular proliferation. The Bax protein, a member of the Bcl-2
family, promotes apoptosis (Rosse et al., 1998; Salakou et al., 2007).
The decision to initiate apoptosis is governed by the equilibrium
between Bcl-2 and Bax, and drugs that stabilize the equilibrium
can sustain cell survival, whereas interventions that shift the
equilibrium toward free Bax promote the induction of apoptosis
(Polster and Fiskum, 2004; Sharp et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2003).
In many systems, members of the Bcl-2 family modulate apoptosis,
with the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio serving to as a rheostat to determine cell
susceptibility to apoptosis (Salakou et al., 2007). The caspases,
especially caspase-3, are known to play a key role in the execution
of apoptosis. Caspase-3 activation by cell death signals may
happen via three routs: the mitochondrial (related to Bax and
Bcl-2), the endoplasmic reticulum, or a death receptor (FAS, FAS-L)
(Benchoua et al., 2001; Chen et al., 1998; Ferrer and Planas, 2003;
Manabat et al., 2003). By suppressing the over-expression of Bax
and the down-regulation of Bcl-2, AGNH (0.125 and 0.25 g/kg/d)
modulated the Bcl-2/Bax equilibrium to block the expression of
caspase-3 in a dose dependent manner. The data further showed

that AGNH protected against apoptosis probably through the
mitochondrial pathway.
In conclusion, we have found that that AGNH exerts neuroprotective effects in a rat model of stroke, and the neuroprotection is
likely to relate to depressed Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 level,
leading to inhibition of apoptotic cell death.
