With the goal to enhance the distribution of cationic Mn porphyrins within mitochondria, the lipophilic
Mn(III)meso-tetrakis(N-n-hexylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ has been synthesized and
tested in several different model of diseases, where it shows remarkable efﬁcacy at as low as 50 mg/kg
single or multiple doses. Yet, in a rat lung radioprotection study, at higher 0.6–1 mg/kg doses, due to its
high accumulation and micellar character, it became toxic. To avoid the toxicity, herein the pulmonary
radioprotection of MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ was assessed at 50 mg/kg. Fischer rats were irradiated to their
right hemithorax (28 Gy) and treated with 0.05 mg/kg/day of MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ for 2 weeks by
subcutaneously-implanted osmotic pumps, starting at 2 h post-radiation. The body weights and
breathing frequencies were followed for 10 weeks post-radiation, when the histopathology and
immunohistochemistry were assessed. Impact of MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ on macrophage recruitment (ED1), DNA oxidative damage (8-OHdG), TGF-β1, VEGF(A) and HIF-1α were measured. MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ
signiﬁcantly decreased radiation-induced lung histopathological (H&E staining) and functional damage
(breathing frequencies), suppressed oxidative stress directly (8-OHdG), or indirectly, affecting TGF-β1,
VEGF (A) and HIF-1α pathways. The magnitude of the therapeutic effects is similar to the effects
demonstrated under same experimental conditions with 120-fold higher dose of  5000-fold less
lipophilic Mn(III)meso-tetrakis(N-ethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTE-2-PyP5 þ .

Introduction
The normal tissue surrounding tumor suffers substantial
damage during anticancer therapy, which limits radiation dose
and thus the magnitude of therapeutic effects. There is still an
unmet need for the efﬁcacious radioprotector of a normal tissue.
Such a compound will also be invaluable in the cases of accidental
nuclear exposures. Thus radioprotectors have been actively sought
by a number of groups [1–6]. We have demonstrated the therapeutic efﬁcacy of cationic Mn(III) N-substituted pyridylporphyrins (MnPs) in various animal models of diseases, radiation injury
included, which all have oxidative stress in common [2,7,8]. MnPs
are among the most potent metal-based SOD mimics thus far
developed. While data suggests that O2  might not be always the
only and/or major species involved in their mechanism of action,
the ability of MnPs to catalyze the O2  dismutation, described by
the rate constant for the catalysis of O2  dismutation by MnP,
kcat(O2  ), parallels their ability to exhibit therapeutic effects in all
diseases thus far tested. The latter is related to their favorable
properties which allow them to readily exchange electrons with
cellular reductants, reactive species and redox-active signaling
proteins. For details the reader is advised to see the most updated
review on the mechanisms of action of SOD mimics and their
radioprotective and anticancer effects (Forum issue on “SOD
mimics” of Antioxid Redox Signal [2]). The facile exchange of
electrons with bio-targets is controlled by the thermodynamic
property of Mn porphyrin, i.e. the reduction potential of MnIII/MnII
redox couple, E1/2, and the kinetic property (kcat(O2  ). Both
properties are controlled by the placement of cationic charges in
the close vicinity of Mn site on the ortho pyridyl nitrogens (Fig. 1)
[2,9]. Such placement of charges attracts anionic reactive species
(O2  , ONOO  , HO2  , ClO  , GS  , RS  ) to the metal site where
redox chemistry/biology occurs.
The MnTE-2-PyP5 þ (AEOL10113) was the very ﬁrst developed and
thus far the most studied cationic Mn(III) N-substituted pyridylporphyrin [1,10–12]. Based on the same thermodynamic and kinetic
principles, the similarly hydrophilic N,N0 -dialkylimidazolium analog,
MnTDE-2-ImP5þ (AEOL10150) has been developed and successfully
tested in different in vitro and in vivo models of oxidative stress
injuries [13–17]. With a goal to increase mitochondrial and brain
accumulation while maintaining the favorable redox property of the
metal site and the positive charges, the 5000-fold more lipophilic
MnTnHex-2-PyP5þ was synthesized [18] and successfully tested in
different diseases (summarized in Fig. 1). The pharmacokinetic data
clearly show that more lipophilic compounds distribute to higher
levels in key cellular fragments – mitochondria: MnTE-2-PyP5 þ (Fig. 1)
distributes 1.5-fold more in mouse heart mitochondria relative to
cytosol, while for MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ the mitochondrial to cytosolic
ratio is 3.6 [2]. The higher mitochondrial accumulation likely contributes to up to 120-fold larger therapeutic effects of MnTnHex-2PyP5þ than of MnTE-2-PyP5 þ . The same property that facilitates the
transport of MnP across the mitochondrial membranes – cationic
charge and lipophilicity – allows it to cross the blood brain barrier and
exert protection in injuries of central nervous system. The toxicity
dose, TD50, at which 50% of mice developed signs of disease, is
91.5 mg/kg (given sc) for MnTE-2-PyP5þ and 12.5 mg/kg for
MnTnHex-2-PyP5þ [19]. Toxicity was demonstrated as hypotonia,
and shaking. The ratio of maximal tolerable dose to the lowest
efﬁcacious dose is 15 (91.5/6) for MnTE-2-PyP5þ vs 250 (12.5/0.05)
for MnTnHex-2-PyP5þ . The ratio 250/15 implies that the therapeutic
window of MnTnHex-2-PyP5þ is  17-fold larger than for MnTE-2PyP5þ [1,2,12,19–21].
We recently reported the rat pulmonary radioprotection by
those two Mn porphyrins [10,11]. While the most efﬁcacious dose
of MnTE-2-PyP5 þ tested was 6 mg/kg/day, the MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ
exhibited signiﬁcant toxicity at doses of 0.6 and 1 mg/kg/day. The

401

daily subcutaneous injections of 0.6 and 1 mg/kg/day of MnTnHex2-PyP5 þ over a period of 14 days (starting at 2 h post-radiation)
resulted in skin lesions, leading to local necrosis and alopecia.
Even with the most efﬁcacious daily dose of 0.3 mg/kg given over a
14 day-period, the signiﬁcant loss of body weight was demonstrated. The therapeutic effect of MnP was diminished to a certain
degree by such toxicity [10]. The toxicity was originally ascribed to
the surfactant nature of MnP which allowed it to damage lipid
bilayers of cellular membranes [1,7]. Meanwhile, the lack of
dark toxicity of redox-inactive but similarly lipophilic analog,
ZnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ was demonstrated [22]. Therefore, the toxicity
of MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ is likely linked to its higher lipophilicity
and consequently higher accumulation inside the cell, where it
could dose-dependently induce apoptotic processes. The ethyl
and n-hexyl analogs differ signiﬁcantly with respect to E1/2 of
MnIIIP/MnIIP redox couple also, the impact of which on the efﬁcacy
and toxicity waits further exploration (see Discussion).
Few animal studies, such as rat kidney ischemia/reperfusion
and rabbit cerebral palsy, indicated that MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ has
remarkable efﬁcacy at as low as 0.05 mg/kg (single or multiple
dosing) [23,24]. We therefore aimed herein to investigate whether
0.05 mg/kg/day of MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ might be more beneﬁcial
than 0.3 mg/kg/day in a rat irradiation-induced lung injury. The
effects of 0.05 mg/kg/day of MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ were compared to
those produced by 6 mg/kg of hydrophilic MnTE-2-PyP5 þ [10].
The remarkable data provided in this study led to the non-human
primate lung radioprotection study where 0.05 mg/kg of MnTnHex-2PyP5 þ was given twice daily for 4 months, starting at 24 h before
radiation. The data demonstrated a signiﬁcant pulmonary radioprotection [25]. A subsequent non-human primate study is in progress with
maximal tolerable dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day (Cline et al., unpublished).

Methods
Animals
Twenty-four female Fischer-344 rats were used in this study
with prior approval from the Duke University Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. Three animals were housed per cage and
maintained under identical conditions with food and water
provided ad libitum. All rats were sacriﬁced ten weeks postradiation by pentobarbital overdose.
SOD mimetic
MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ was synthesized and characterized as previously described [26]. The PBS solution of the manganese
porphyrin was used in this study.
Irradiation and treatment with SOD mimetic
At the time of irradiation all rats weighed between 175 and
185 g to minimize possible variations in lung size. The 24 animals
were divided equally into the following groups to receive: 1) right
hemithoracic irradiation (IR), 2) no IR and PBS, 3) IR and
MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ (0.05 mg/kg/day). Hemithoracic irradiation of
the right lung with a single dose of 28 Gy using 150 kV X-rays with
a dose rate of 0.71 Gy/min (Therapax 320, Pantak Inc., East Haven,
CT) was performed as previously described [10,11,27]. Mn porphyrin as well as PBS were delivered for 14 days by subcutaneous
implanted osmotic pumps (Alzets Model 2ML2, Durect Corporation, Cupertino, CA) at a dose rate of 5.0 ml/h (0.05 mg/kg/day)
starting at 2 h after radiation. Relative to our previous experiences
where MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ was injected subcutaneously [10], the
controlled injection rate (5 ml/min) via sc-implanted osmotic

pumps was well tolerated. It did not cause any negative effects
such as local alteration of pump implantation sites or weight loss.
Follow-up and functional assessment of lung injury
All animals were followed-up during ten weeks after IR. Bodyweight was measured bi-weekly. Breathing frequency using
whole-body plethysmography (Model RM-80, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA) was measured as an indicator of
pulmonary injury. Measurements were taken in a representative
group (n ¼10) before IR and in 5 animals per group biweekly,
starting 4 weeks after IR until week 10. The mean values of ﬁve
measurements were recorded.
Histology
At the time of sacriﬁce, the right upper lobes of all animals
were obtained for immunohistochemistry and histopathology
studies. Animals were euthanized with pentobarbital overdose.
Both lungs were infused by tracheal instillation of a solution
containing 2% glutaraldehyde and 0.085 M sodium cacodylate
buffer for 25 min for ﬁxation prior to removal of the lung. After
removal, the lobes of the irradiated right lung were separated and
embedded in parafﬁn.
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
Hematoxylin and eosin staining: Five-micrometer thick sections
of the lung tissue, embedded in parafﬁn, were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The extent of radiation-induced

damage for each ﬁeld was graded on a scale from 0 (normal lung)
to 8 (total obliteration of the ﬁeld), as described by Ashcroft et al.
[28]. Average scoring below grade 4 (moderate thickening of walls
without obvious damage to lung architecture) resulted in the rat
allocation in the “no damage” group, while average scoring above
grade 4 (increased ﬁbrosis with deﬁnite damage to lung architecture) led to the respective rat placement in the “damage” group.
Immunohistochemistry of lungs was done as previously
described [10,11,14,27]. Lungs were assessed for the number
and activity of macrophages with ED-1 staining, the expression of
8-OHdG (8-hydroxy-20 -deoxyguanosine) as a marker of oxidatively
modiﬁed DNA, expression of TGF-β1 (transforming growth factorβ1), a proﬁbrogenic cytokine, and HIF-1α (hypoxia inducible factor
1α), a pro-angiogenic transcription factor and its product VEGF(A)
(vascular endothelial growth factor A), a pro-angiogenic cytokine.
Immunohistochemistry was performed as described by Hsu
et al. [29]. The primary antibodies used, were directed against
activated macrophage marker ED1 (MCA341, 1:100, Serotec,
Oxford, UK), 8-OHdG (MOG-020P, 1:1000, JaICA, Shizuoka, Japan),
VEGF(A) (Sc-152, 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz,
CA), active TGF-β1 (Sc-146, 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.,
Santa Cruz, CA), and HIF-1α (NB 100-105, 1:100, Novus Biologicals,
Littleton, CO). Image analysis was carried out as previously
described [10,11]. Results were expressed as the number of
positively stained macrophages or as percentage of 8-OHdG or
HIF-1α-positive nuclei per digital image (average of eight digital
images per animal, average of ﬁve or six animals per group). For
TGF-β and VEGF(A), the results represent the average percentage
of positive staining (the ratio of positive staining over the total
tissue area per digital image).

Statistical analysis
The discrepancies between binomial proportions were tested
using Fisher0 s exact test [30]. The distributions of the biomarkers
with respect to the drug (or dose) were compared in a pairwise
fashion using the exact two-sample Wilcoxon test [31]. For
breathing frequencies and body weight, an aggregate measure
was computed as the empirical area under the curve. The
distributions of these curves were compared in a pairwise fashion
using the exact two-sample Wilcoxon test [31]. The R statistical
environment [32] was used for all statistical analyses.

Results
Body weight and breathing frequencies
The control non-irradiated rats gain weight more than the
irradiated group for most of a 10 week-period of observation. Even
for a large period of time rats irradiated but treated with MnP
gained weight in a similar fashion as non irradiated non MnPtreated rats (Fig. 2, Table 1). Average starting body weight across
all groups was 181.17 2.2 g at day of IR. The non-irradiated control
group gained undisturbed weight throughout the entire process.
In contrast, animals which were irradiated but received no treatment (IR only-group) gained signiﬁcantly less weight (p ¼0.012 vs.
PBS only). Animals which were irradiated and treated with
MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ displayed higher body weight in comparison
with the untreated irradiated animals (p ¼0.004 vs IR only-group).
In contrast, animals which received MnTE-2-PyP5 þ showed only a
trend towards higher body weight in comparison with the IR onlygroup (p¼ 0.129 vs. IR only-group). This is in agreement with what
we saw in other studies where low levels of MnPs produce beneﬁt
to wild type E. coli and different cancer cell lines [33,34]. Nevertheless, animals from the IR þMnTE-2-PyP5 þ -group displayed a
slightly decreased starting body weight in comparison with most
other groups. When the trajectories depicting body weight over
ten weeks were compared between MnTE-2-PyP5 þ and MnTnHex2-PyP5 þ treatment groups, no difference could be observed
(p ¼0.487 for IR þMnTE-2-PyP5 þ -group vs IR þMnTnHex-2PyP5 þ -group) (Fig. 2; p values Table 1).
Signiﬁcantly higher breathing rates were measured in the IR
only-group (p ¼0.008 vs. control group). In stark contrast, animals
which were treated with MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ (0.05 mg/kg) starting
2 h after IR did not display any changes in breathing frequencies
relative to control group (Fig. 3; p ¼0.008 for IR þ MnTnHex-2PyP5 þ vs IR only-group). Also, animals which received MnTE-2PyP5 þ (6 mg/kg) displayed signiﬁcantly decreased breathing frequencies in comparison to the IR only-group (p ¼0.008 for
IR þMnTE-2-PyP5 þ vs IR only-group). Nevertheless, in direct
comparison animals which received MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ after IR
revealed signiﬁcantly lower breathing frequencies in comparison
to the IR þ MnTE-2-PyP5 þ group (p ¼0.032) signifying less functional damage in this group (Fig. 3; p values in Table 1).
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
H&E staining showed no damage in the control group (average
scoring grade ¼ 0.29 for PBS only). In comparison, 10 weeks after
RT the average damage scoring for animals in the IR-only group
was 5.3 (min 0, max 8), i.e., 85% of all animals in this group
displayed signiﬁcant histopathological damage (scoring 44,
describing obvious damage to lung structure [28]). The damage
was composed of severe distortion of lung structure, accumulation of alveolar macrophages, interstitial/alveolar edema, and
beginning of the formation of ﬁbrous masses. Animals in both

The IR only-group gained signiﬁcantly less weight (p ¼0.012 vs. PBS only). The
IRþ MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ group displayed higher body weight in comparison with
the untreated irradiated animals (p ¼0.004 vs IR only-group). In contrast, animals
which received MnTE-2-PyP5 þ starting 2 h after IR showed only a trend towards
higher body weight in comparison with the IR only-group [11].

MnP-treated groups showed less histopathological damage, comprising mostly of thickening of alveolar walls, alveolar edema,
accumulation of alveolar macrophages, and rareﬁcation of alveolar
wall structures (Figs. 4 and 5, Table 1 for p values), but also of a high
percentage of normal lung tissue. The administration of MnTnHex2-PyP5 þ and MnTE-2-PyP5 þ after IR signiﬁcantly reduced damage
in comparison with the IR-only group (p¼0.026 for MnTE-2-PyP5 þ
and p¼0.009 for MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ vs. IR-only, RST).

signiﬁcant evidence (but trend towards signiﬁcance) for inhibition
of HIF-1α activation was found (p¼ 0.132 vs IR only). This ﬁnding
may have been confounded by a conspicuously high standard
deviation in this group weakening the statistical power of analysis.
Nevertheless, we were not able to determine a clear difference
between MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ and MnTE-2-PyP5 þ treatment in
respect to activation of HIF-1α (p ¼0.24 for MnTE-2-PyP5 þ vs
MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ ).

changes in breathing frequencies (p ¼0.008 for both groups vs IR only-group).
Treatment with MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ after IR resulted in signiﬁcantly lower breathing frequencies in comparison to the IR þMnTE-2-PyP5 þ group (p ¼0.032).

Macrophage recruitment
No activation of macrophages was seen in control animals.
Positive staining for ED-1 was observed in the IR-only group
(p ¼0.002 vs. no IR). As seen in previous investigations [10,11],
early treatment (2 h after IR) with MnTE-2-PyP5 þ did not result in
decreased numbers of activated macrophages (p ¼0.179 vs. IR
only). On the contrary, the early post-IR treatment with
MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg resulted in a signiﬁcantly lower activation of macrophages (p¼ 0.015 vs. IR only;
Table 1, Figs. 4 and 5).
DNA damage
No 8-OHdG was detected in the control group. 10 weeks post
IR, a high level of DNA oxidation was seen in animals which
received no MnP treatment after IR (p ¼0.002 vs. no IR). Treatment
with both MnPs resulted in reduced 8-OHdG formation (p ¼0.002
for MnTE-2-PyP5 þ and p ¼0.009 for MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ vs. IR
only). In direct comparison between the MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ and
MnTE-2-PyP5 þ treatment groups, treatment with MnTE-2-PyP5 þ
resulted in a lower level of DNA oxidation (p ¼0.015 for MnTE-2PyP5 þ vs. MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ ).
TGF-β1
No positive immunostaining for TGF-β1 was observed in
control animals. In comparison, active TGF-β1 was signiﬁcantly
elevated in the IR-only group (p¼ 0.002 vs. control group). The
irradiated animals which were treated with either MnP post-IR
exhibited the equal reduction in immunostaining for active TGFβ1 in comparison with animals which received only PBS after
irradiation (for both MnPs p ¼0.002 vs. IR only).
HIF-1α
No positive staining for the transcription factor HIF-1α was
seen in the control group. After 10 weeks, the IR only-group
displayed highly elevated levels of HIF-1α (p¼ 0.002 vs control
group). Treatment with MnTE-2-PyP5 þ (6 mg/kg) resulted in a
signiﬁcantly decreased activation of HIF-1α (p¼ 0.002 vs IR only).
In contrast, with MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ , starting 2 h after IR, no

VEGF (A)
Vascular endothelial growth factor A, VEGF(A), is a dimeric
glycoprotein. It is considered a dominant inducer of the blood
vessels growth and is essential for adults during organ remodeling
and diseases that involve blood vessels, such as wound healing,
tumor angiogenesis, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related muscular degeneration [35]. No positive staining for VEGF (A) was seen
in the control group. Signiﬁcant positive staining for VEGF (A) was
detected in the IR-only group (p¼ 0.002 vs. control group).
Animals which received MnTE-2-PyP5 þ (6 mg/kg) after IR showed
signiﬁcantly decreased upregulation of VEGF (A) in comparison
with animals which received only PBS after IR (p ¼ 0.002 for MnTE2-PyP5 þ vs IR only-group). Also, treatment with MnTnHex-2PyP5 þ (0.05 mg/kg) after IR resulted in decreased VEGF (A)
(p ¼0.009 for MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ vs IR only-group). No difference
in VEGF (A) levels was observed between the two treatment
groups (p ¼0.818 for MnTE-2-PyP5 þ vs MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ ). The
strong effect of MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ on HIF-1α-regulated VEGF by
itself supports the arguments related to the high standard deviation of HIF-1α immunohistochemistry, which might have weakened the HIF immunohistochemistry results (see above).

Discussion
Therapeutic effects of MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ
To eliminate the contribution of the toxicity we undertook the
study dosing a rat at 0.05 mg/kg/day for 14 days, starting at 2 h
post-radiation. The therapeutic outcome at 10 weeks postradiation and 8 weeks post-administration of MnP was impressive.
At such a low dose, the MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ favorably affected the
growth of rats relative to irradiated rats and to non-irradiated
control rats in a similar or better way than 6 mg/kg of MnTE-2PyP5 þ (Fig. 2). The signiﬁcantly higher body weight in the group
which received MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ was observed in comparison
with irradiated but non-treated animals (Fig. 2).
The reduction of lung injury was clearly demonstrated as MnPbased suppression of breathing frequencies (Fig. 3). Further, the
lung histology (Fig. 4) indicated that ﬁbrous masses start to form
after irradiation; their growth was suppressed by both MnPs, as
was the severe distortion of lung structure. Also the accumulation
of alveolar macrophages, and interstitial/alveolar edema were
largely reduced (Fig. 4). Both MnPs signiﬁcantly suppressed
oxidative stress yet at 120-fold different doses. The near full
inhibition of oxidative DNA damage, i.e. formation of 8-OHdG,
was demonstrated (Figs. 4 and 5). Suppression of macrophage
inﬁltration contributed further to the suppression of oxidative
stress (Figs. 4 and 5). Importantly, statistical signiﬁcance has been
reached in blocking the activation of alveolar macrophages after IR
by 50 mg/kg/day MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ , but not by 6 mg/kg/day
MnTE-2-PyP5 þ . Macrophages are large source of superoxide and
nitric oxide which gives rise to a whole array of reactive species
leading to increased secondary oxidative stress and increased
activation of cellular transcription [36]. The immunohistochemical
data clearly demonstrate that a cationic MnP is able to signiﬁcantly
affect cellular transcription and prevent detrimental ﬁbrotic

0.05 mg/kg/day MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ in comparison with 6 mg/kg/day MnTE-2-PyP5 þ . The analyses were done at 10 weeks post-IR. The effects of MnTE-2-PyP5 þ and
MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ on the level of histopathological damage (H&E), oxidative stress [described here by macrophage activation (ED-1) and DNA oxidative modiﬁcation

processes leading to the loss of lung function by down regulation
of TGF-β1 and HIF-controlled VEGF (Figs. 4 and 5). The impact on
TGF-β1 would in turn suppress oxidative stress also, as it is
involved in inﬂammatory cell recruitment (see Mechanistic
Considerations) [58]. It is important to note that MnP was
administered for only 2 weeks while the therapeutic effects were
still profound at 8 weeks post-drug delivery; such data provide the
evidence for (i) the drug accumulation in the tissue and within cell
and cellular fragments and subsequent slow release in agreement
with reported pharmacokinetic studies [37]; and (ii) the catalytic
nature of MnP actions.
Therapeutic effects of MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ vs its toxicity
The earlier data demonstrated a toxicity of MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ
at all doses 40.6 mg/kg/day [10,11]. The lung protection was
reported at 0.3 mg/kg/day but was lower relative to the effect
produced by 6 mg/kg/day MnTE-2-PyP5 þ [10,11]. The loss of body
weight was observed with 0.3 mg/kg of MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ [10].
Other dose-dependent studies of MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ [1,2,10,38]
suggest that the pro-oxidative pathways likely reduce the
therapeutic efﬁcacy of MnP when given at 0.3 mg/kg/day (Fig. 6)
[10,11]. At certain threshold, the cellular levels of MnP may
become too high. Under such circumstances, the higher levels of
H2O2 will be produced by MnP (either in reaction with oxygen or
superoxide, see Fig. 6 Scheme B) [39,40]. If the ability of cell to
eliminate peroxide is inferior (the H2O2-removing enzymes downregulated or inactivated which is often seen with cancer or gravely
sick cells, see refs [38,41], H2O2 would be employed by MnP for the
catalysis of oxidation of redox-sensitive NF-kB cysteines [giving
rise to protein (R) disulﬁdes, R-S-S-R] or glutathionylation [giving
rise to glutathionylated proteins, R-S-S-G] of redox-sensitive subunits of NF-kB with consequent inhibition of its transcription. Also

MnP can catalyze the glutathionylation and subsequent inhibition
of complexes I and III of mitochondrial respiration - electron
transport chain, etc, with subsequent reduction in ATP production
and apoptosis (Fig. 6B and summarized in [2,39,42–45]). See also
discussion further below. The same pro-oxidative action is likely
involved in the transient suppression of pro-inﬂammatory transcription factor NF-κB also, which results in limited reduction of
cycling oxidative stress/inﬂammation and thus in beneﬁcial therapeutic antioxidative effects [2,9,39]. MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ carries a
fair micellar/surfactant character as it bears hydrophobic alkyl
chains and hydrophilic positively charged pyridyl nitrogens. It
therefore has the ability to damage lipid bilayers [46]. Recent data
indicate, though, that ZnTnHex-2-PyP4 þ , the redox-inactive analog, exhibits no toxicity in darkness, while its micellar character is
nearly identical to that of MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ [44,47,48]. Further
studies on the mechanism of MnPs are in progress. Given the
complexity of cellular pathways and MnP redox activities (due to
the four biologically easily accessible oxidation states of Mn, þ 2,
þ3, þ4, and þ 5), we are still far away from fully understanding
the actions of MnPs in vivo (see refs [2,9,39] for further
discussions).
Mechanistic considerations
The remarkable therapeutic efﬁcacy of redox-active pentacationic MnPs was attributed to the their impact on signaling redoxactive pathways [1,2]. This was herein demonstrated by the
suppression of HIF-1α transcription and downregulation of VEGF
(A) and TGF-β1 (Figs. 2–4. The cross talk between NF-κB, HIF-1α,
AP-1, TGF-β, NOX4 and Smad signaling pathways has been substantiated in literature [61–66]. TGF-β has a central role in ﬁbrosis
(produced by inﬂammatory cells and involved in their recruitment
[67]). Its signal (through cell surface serine/threonine kinases)

Fig. 6. Radioprotective, therapeutic effects of MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ vs its toxicity is dose-dependent. (A) The effects reported in this work. The substantial amount of literature
data strongly suggest that there is a cross-talk between HIF-1α, VEGF(A) TGF-β1 and NF-kB and likely involve the effects on NADPH oxidase isoform NOX4 [16] and Smads
proteins [49–52]. Effects of MnP on HIF-1α, VEGF and NOX-4 have been reported [16,53–55]. Based on our most recent advancement in cell biology and aqueous chemistry data
we believe that the in vivo mechanism of MnP is related to its redox cycling with cellular reductants and/or reactive species and oxygen as shown in Scheme B which gives rise
to H2O2. The peroxide is in turn used by MnP to oxidize [55,56] or glutathionylate [43,45] the redox-sensitive cysteines of p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB. Such modiﬁcations
imparted by MnP suppress the transcription of NF-κB, perpetuating thus the inﬂammation. The glutathionylation of redox sensitive complexes I and III of mitochondrial electron
transport chain and therefore (i) increase in O2  and its progeny production and (ii) decrease in cellular energy production may impact the HIF-1α, VEGF(A) and TGF-β1
pathways and in turn the lung damage [43]. If the intracellular levels of MnP and/or peroxide are high, the magnitude of NF-κB oxidation may be excessive and apoptosis may
predominate. Such scenario likely occurred at Z0.3 mg/kg/day of MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ [1,2,39,40,42,56–60]. In addition to the impact of MnP on pathways addressed in this work
(red arrows), the Scheme also shows the pathways demonstrated previously to be involved in the actions of MnPs. It also includes those pathways which have not yet been
explored in pulmonary radioprotection but are likely involved such as (Smads proteins).

is transduced into nucleus via Smads proteins [65]. Based on
the cross talk between NF-κB, HIF-1α and TGF-β pathways and
on the abundance of evidence on the effect of analogous
Mn(III) meso-tetrakis N-substituted pyridylporphyrins on NF-κB
and AP-1 activation in different oxidative stress-based diseases
[43,55,57,68–72], it is likely that the NF-κB regulation of HIF-1α
transcription is at least in part controlled by the MnP-driven
oxidative modiﬁcation of redox-sensitive cysteines of p50 and
p65 subunits of NF-κB pathways. The action is presumably
catalytic and, in addition to a MnP catalyst, involves H2O2 and
glutathione (Scheme B of Fig. 6) [1,2,9,39,40,45]. These effects
originate from the thiol oxidase- of glutathione peroxidase-like
mechanisms of cationic MnPs and are presently under detailed
exploration [43,45,57,69]. Such actions led to the suppression of
cycling inﬂammation and thus suppression of secondary oxidative
stress. The effects are similar to those achieved by ethyl analog,
MnTE-2-PyP5 þ at a 120-fold higher dose [11] (shown for comparison for both MnPs in Figs. 2–4). This remarkable enhancement in
the efﬁcacy of hexyl relative to ethyl analog has originally been
attributed to the higher lipophilicity of hexyl porphyrin [18] which
allows it to more easily cross plasma membrane and two mitochondrial membranes and get into the mitochondrial matrix at
2.4-fold higher level [2,7,38]. In mitochondria, the MnTnHex-2PyP5 þ acts as MnSOD. Its ability to mimic MnSOD has been most
clearly demonstrated with mouse cardiomyocytes by St. Clair0 s
group [73]. MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ also crosses the blood brain barrier

(getting into cortex and hippocampus) driven by anionic phosphates groups, and enters brain mitochondria [74]. Transport
across the BBB is facilitated in much the same fashion as the
transport across two mitochondrial membranes [74]. Consequently, it protects brain against radiation [75], and radiosensitizes
glioblastoma multiforme D-245 MG (mouse ﬂank sc xenograft
study) to radiation and temozolomide treatment [2,76].
The impact of nearly 100 mV higher metal-centered reduction
potential of MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ (E1/2 ¼ þ228 mV vs NHE for MnTE2-PyP5 þ and is þ 314 mV vs NHE for MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ ) may not
be fully excluded in its differential action [2], and requires further
investigations. Based on our present knowledge, we believe that
the beneﬁcial therapeutic effects of this and other cationic Mn(III)
N-substituted pyridylporphyrins originate likely from the interplay
of their lipophilicities and redox-activities. For example, once it is
distributed within cell, the higher the E1/2 is, the easier MnP is
reduced with cellular reductant; consequently it prefers to stay in þ2
oxidation state. This suppresses or precludes its ability to redox cycle
back to Mn þ3 or þ4 oxidation states in order to exert catalytic action
in regulation of redox-sensitive NF-κB/HIF pathways [2,34,42,77].
The action/s of MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ , which contribute to the pulmonary
radioprotection, are summarized in Fig. 6. In addition to NF-kB, MnP is
also able to inhibit AP-1 as reported in skin carcinogenesis model [72]
and HIF-1α transcription factor as reported here and in 4T1 breast
cancer model [78]. The PI3K/AKT pathway is reportedly involved in
AP-1 suppression by MnP [72], and is linked to NF-κB, HIF pathways

408

and mTOR pathways. The former is known to be involved in the
activation of mTOR which in turn regulates cell growth, cell proliferation, cell motility, cell survival, protein synthesis, and transcription.
Thus far, the most widely explored the in vivo impact of MnP on
redox-sensitive proteins relates to the studies of the oxidation of
cysteines of NF-κB and complexes I, III, and IV of mitochondrial
electron transport chain in lymphoma cellular model [43,79]. The
critical importance of such studies is reﬂected in the fact that thiol
modiﬁcations are regarded as major signaling events [41,80]. The
impact of MnP on NF-κB in CNS injuries [71,81], and diabetes has been
addressed also [12,55,56,58,82].
The additional beneﬁt of a lipophilic MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ , relative to a hydrophilic and equally redox-active analog MnTE-2PyP5 þ , lies in the fact that 120-fold less drug needs to be
synthesized in the case of former. That could in turn greatly
reduce costs of GMP-based drug synthesis. Even more importantly,
it is easier to formulate 4 mg of MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ relative to the
formulation of  500 mg of MnTE-2-PyP5 þ for a daily administration to an adult whose weight averages 80 kg. Of note, MnTE-2PyP5 þ was GMP-synthesized and Drug Master File ﬁled. A good
safety/toxicity proﬁle was demonstrated [83].

Conclusion
Our data demonstrate a remarkable rat lung radioprotection
exerted by a lipophilic MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ . Under same experimental conditions a similar magnitude of protection was observed
with MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ at 50 mg/kg/day (given for 14 days, starting at 2 h post-radiation) as with 120-fold higher dose of hydrophilic MnTE-2-PyP5 þ . Both Mn porphyrins prevent direct oxidative damage of biomolecules as demonstrated with large suppression of 8-OHdG formation. Further, they impact the HIF-1α/VEG
(A)/TGF-β1 redox-sensitive signaling pathways, presumably involving NF-κB, whereby reducing secondary oxidative stress and in
turn preventing irradiation-based lung ﬁbrosis and loss of its
function. Finally, the MnP-driven reduction in recruitment of
macrophages – major source of reactive species – contributed
largely to the suppression of oxidative stress.
Once the drug reaches clinics, there is a signiﬁcant advantage in
formulating a low amount of it. The formulation of 4 mg of a drug
needed for daily administration of MnTnHex-2-PyP5 þ to an 80 kgadult should not present a problem, while the formulation of
500 mg of a hydrophilic MnTE-2-PyP5 þ could be challenging.
