Delayed reperfusion deﬁcits after experimental stroke account
for increased pathophysiology
Fiona E Burrows1, Natasha Bray1, Adam Denes1,2, Stuart M Allan1 and Ingo Schiessl1
Cerebral blood ﬂow and oxygenation in the ﬁrst few hours after reperfusion following ischemic stroke are critical for
therapeutic interventions but are not well understood. We investigate changes in oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) concentration in the
cortex during and after ischemic stroke, using multispectral optical imaging in anesthetized mice, a remote ﬁlament to induce
either 30 minute middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), sham surgery or anesthesia alone. Immunohistochemistry establishes
cortical injury and correlates the severity of damage with the change of oxygen perfusion. All groups were imaged for 6 hours after
MCAo or sham surgery. Oxygenation maps were calculated using a pathlength scaling algorithm. The MCAo group shows a
signiﬁcant drop in HbO2 during occlusion and an initial increase after reperfusion. Over the subsequent 6 hours HbO2
concentrations decline to levels below those observed during stroke. Platelets, activated microglia, interleukin-1α, evidence
of BBB breakdown and neuronal stress increase within the stroked hemisphere and correlate with the severity of the
delayed reperfusion deﬁcit but not with the ΔHbO2 during stroke. Despite initial restoration of HbO2 after 30 min MCAo there
is a delayed compromise that coincides with inﬂammation and could be a target for improved stroke outcome after
thrombolysis.

INTRODUCTION
Stroke is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the
western world. Given the multiparametric response of the brain
and immune system to an ischemic insult, there are few
therapeutic interventions available.1,2 In humans, the main cause
of stroke is ischemic brain injury (85%), usually following from
occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA).3,4 Ischemic stroke
leads to hypoperfusion of brain tissue, inducing an energydepleted state within the infarct core and triggering a number of
acute pathophysiologic processes, altogether resulting in neuronal
injury. Induction of hypoperfusion, i.e. the reduction in cerebral
blood ﬂow within the affected area, starves neurons of glucose5
and leads to the constriction of pericytes,6 the release of
endogenous mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns,7 and proinﬂammatory cytokines.8,9 To improve treatment
of ischemic stroke, it is important to understand the underlying
pathophysiologic changes that occur within the acute phase of
cerebral ischemia.
Hypoperfusion that results in a deﬁcit in the delivery of oxygen
to cerebral tissue within the infarct core causes irreversible
changes to neuronal integrity and vascular components that
contribute further to the lack of reperfusion.6,10 The ‘no-reﬂow’
phenomenon is a concept that has been documented in clinical
cases and animal models of cerebral ischemia triggered by
occlusions as short as 30 minutes.11–13 Signiﬁcant alterations in
microvessel integrity occur within the ﬁrst few minutes of ﬂow
cessation after an ischemic insult.14 These changes culminate in
focal ‘no-reﬂow’ within the microvessels, where the activation of

endothelium and coagulation factors leads to the recruitment of
leukocytes and platelets, obstructing the microvessel lumen and
leading to an increase in microvessel permeability.14–16 The
penumbral region borders the infarct core and contains stressed,
but functionally viable, neurons. Timely reperfusion can salvage
stressed neurons within the penumbral region, but if not
achieved, continued hypoperfusion leads to the extension of the
infarct core, which eventually envelops the penumbral region.17,18
Two-dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy (2D-OIS) is a
powerful imaging technique that uses different wavelengths of
illumination to record image data from which hemodynamic
parameters can be determined, including changes in HbO2 concentration at the cortical surface.19 Traditionally, studies using 2DOIS investigate changes in the hemodynamic parameters between
periods of cortical stimulation and rest. Here, we calculate the
changes between different time points of the ischemic event.
Focal ischemia can be replicated in rodent models by middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) whereby a siliconized ﬁlament is
placed at the base of the MCA branch to cause occlusion.20,21
Although many other forms of occlusion exist (coagulation of the
artery or surgical ligature) such techniques are less controllable
with respect to reperfusion after a limited period of occlusion than
the ﬁlament MCAo method.22,23 However, one drawback with
ﬁlament MCAo is the larger intersubject variability with regard to
the ﬁnal infarct volume. In this study, we developed a remote
ﬁlament method, whereby the ﬁlament is placed in the artery
without blocking blood ﬂow, to allow baseline recordings to be
made, and is then advanced in the imaging setup to cause the
focal ischemic event, with subsequent retraction after the desired

length of time. Using this approach we are the ﬁrst group to
report the μmolar change in the concentration of HbO2 from the
baseline perfusion, during the stroke period, and after block
removal (reperfusion) for each animal in vivo. This allows us to
correlate the dynamical changes of HbO2 perfusion with speciﬁc
markers that can delineate a timeline of events that lead to
neuronal injury6,16 and that have already been identiﬁed as
contributing to the ‘no-reﬂow’ phenomenon, i.e., platelets and
neutrophils, as well as markers of blood brain barrier (BBB)
disruption, glial activation, and inﬂammation.
We hypothesise that the lack of sustained reperfusion and
not the initial decrease in HbO2 during occlusion governs the
extent of pathophysiologic damage and that platelet aggregation
has a key role in the cerebral ischemic no-reﬂow phenomenon
through physical obstruction of the microvasculature.

the remote ﬁlament in place. The tubing was then secured on to the
sternocleidomastoid muscle.
For imaging experiments, animals were ﬁxed in a stereotactic frame
(Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) with ear bars, mouth bar and a dorsal head post
to prevent movement. Animals were artiﬁcially ventilated at 1% to 1.5%
isoﬂurane in room air via a Zoovent Jetsys ventilator (Universal Lung
Ventilators Ltd, Milton Keynes, UK). Body temperature was maintained at
36.9 ± 0.2°C via a heating blanket controlled with a rectal probe (Harvard
Apparatus, Kent, UK), and the heart rate was monitored via ECG
throughout the experiment.
A midline incision in the scalp was made and the skull on the left side
exposed. A soft parafﬁn (Vaseline) ‘well’ was constructed directly onto the
skull and ﬁlled with 37°C saline. This well was then closed with a glass
coverslip to create a stable imaging window over the somatosensory
cortex, through which the intact and translucent skull could be observed.

Two-Dimensional Optical Imaging Spectroscopy
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Remote Filaments
Sterile Ethicon 5-0 monoﬁlament sutures (Ethicon, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) were
cut to 5 cm lengths and then marked at 10 mm from the tip for subsequent
coating. Clear 0.5 mm diameter i.v. catheter tubing (Portex, Kent, UK) was cut
to 2 cm length and used to aid stability during insertion of the remote
ﬁlament. The ﬁlament tip was dipped in ethanol to remove any dirt or grease
and covered evenly over the 10-mm length with a mixture of Xantopren M
Mucosa and Activator NF Optosil.24 Filament diameter was checked under a
microscope using a μm scale (diameter ranged from 0.21 to 0.23 mm).
Filaments were then suspended tip down and left to air dry for 1 hour.

Animals
All procedures were performed under appropriate Home Ofﬁce Licence
(UK), adhered to the Animals Scientiﬁc Procedures (1986) Act and were
performed in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. Experiments and the
study were approved by the local ethics committee in the Faculty of Life
Sciences of the University of Manchester, UK. Mice were kept at 21°C and
65% humidity with a regulated 12-hour light–dark cycle and with free
access to food and water. Fifteen male C57/BL6 mice weighing between 30
and 36 g (age 18 to 25 weeks) were used in this study. Nine C57/BL6 male
mice underwent 30 minutes occlusion with 6 hours reperfusion (MCAo
group); three underwent sham (SHAM) surgery, where the ﬁlament was left
within the internal carotid artery during surgery but not advanced; and
three control (CTRL) mice underwent a tracheotomy only. Animals in the
sham group showed no signiﬁcant variability in the measures between
subjects and with the control animals using an ANOVA comparison.
Therefore in line with the 3 R’s for the humane use of animals in scientiﬁc
research we kept the sham and control group at n = 3.

Surgical Preparation
Anesthesia was induced with 4% isoﬂurane (Abbott, Berkshire, UK) in room
air. Once the animals were unconscious with lack of pedal reﬂex, they were
maintained under 2% isoﬂurane via a face mask for surgery and, once a
tracheal cannula had been inserted, 1% to 1.5% isoﬂurane for the
remainder of the experiment.
For MCAo, a midline skin incision across the throat was made to expose
the left common carotid artery, and its bifurcation into internal and
external branches. After cauterizing the superior thyroid artery branching
from the external carotid artery (ECA), the common carotid artery was
ligated with a 10x2 mm micro-serreﬁne (Fine Surgical Tools (FST), DE).21
The ECA was fully occluded by cauterization as distally from the bifurcation
with the internal carotid artery as could be achieved and an ~ 0.23 mm
hole was cut into the ECA proximally. A standard Doccol 0.21 ± 0.02 mm
width ﬁlament (6021PK10, Doccol Corporation, Sharon, MA, USA) was
inserted and advanced 5 mm. The custom-made remote ﬁlament was
levered into the hole in the wall of the ECA while the Doccol ﬁlament was
simultaneously removed. The ﬁlament was then further advanced to the
internal carotid artery to a point just before the MCA branch, but without
occluding the MCA. The ﬁlament was secured in place with a surgical
suture loop around the ECA that was tight enough to prevent bleeding but
would allow the movement of the ﬁlament. A 2-cm length of transparent
0.5 mm diameter i.v. catheter tubing was ﬁlled with silicon oil (SigmaAldrich, Gillingham, UK) and positioned close to the surgical site, holding

Two-dimensional spectroscopic imaging data were collected through the
imaging window over the intact skull using a high signal-to-noise charged
coupled device (CCD) camera (Pantera 1M30, DALSA, Munich, Germany).
The region of interest was illuminated sequentially by four different
wavelengths of light (550 ± 10 nm, 560 ± 10 nm, 577 ± 10 nm, and 700
± 10 nm) using a Lambda DG-4 high-speed ﬁlter changer (Sutter
Instruments, Novato, CA, USA). Camera data collection was synchronized
with the ﬁlter changer so that each image frame was recorded with one of
the four different cortical illumination wavelengths in a sequential manner
at a rate of 28 Hz.
A ceramic attenuator (PI Instruments, Bedford, UK) was attached to a
single whisker on the right whisker pad to enable computer-controlled
mechanical stimulation of the barrel cortex throughout the experiment.
A single imaging experiment consisted of a continuous recording of 30
trials. Each trial was 16 seconds long and contained a 4-second prestimulus
period; 4 seconds of 8 Hz mechanical whisker stimulation and an 8-second
recovery time. These 8-minute experiments were recorded before, during,
and after MCAo or the time equivalents in the other experimental groups.
Supplementary Figure 1 shows the timing of a single trial, experiment and
the timeline for the whole procedure.

Induction of Cerebral Ischemia
Once the CCD camera was in position, an imaging region of interest was
chosen to include branches of the MCA and surrounding parenchyma
within the left somatosensory cortex. Visualization of the activation of the
barrel from whisker stimulation provided instant feedback on the correct
positioning. Two sets of trials were recorded for baseline comparison, after
which the ﬁlament was externally moved ~ 2 to 3 mm to induce occlusion
of the MCA. Experiments were recorded consecutively, for a total of
30 minutes, during the occlusion phase. The remote ﬁlament was then
retracted back 6 mm to allow full reperfusion of the MCA. Trial sets were
then recorded every 30 minutes for 6 hours after reperfusion.
After 6 hours reperfusion, the animal was transcardially perfused with
0.9% saline solution containing 0.5% sodium nitrate followed by 2%
paraformaldehyde solution. After ﬁxing, the brain was removed, stored in
2% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours and submerged in a 30% sucrose
solution for a further 24 hours.

Tissue Processing
Coronal brain sections (30 μm thick) were cut on a sledge microtome
(Leica, Milton Keynes, UK) with freezing stage (Bright Instruments,
Huntingdon, UK). Sections were stored in antifreeze solution (30% ethylene
glycol and 20% glycerol (Sigma, Gillingham, UK) in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS)) at − 20 °C, before histological staining.

Immunohistochemistry
Brain sections were washed in PBS and incubated for 1 hour at room
temperature with 2% normal donkey or rabbit serum (Vector Labs,
Peterborough, UK) in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma) to block
nonspeciﬁc binding. Sections were then incubated overnight with primary
antibodies as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-CD41/integrin alpha 2b
antibody (platelets) (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit anti-Iba1
(microglia) (1:1,000, Abcam), rabbit anti-laminin antibody (1:500, Abcam),
and rabbit neutrophil serum anti-SJC (clone SJC4, 1:1,000). Sections were
further incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488 nm

or Alexa 594 nm ﬂuorochromes (1:500, Invitrogen, UK) for 2 hours at room
temperature.
A ﬁnal wash was performed in PBS and slices were mounted on charged
microscope slides. Prolong Gold antifade reagent (with or without DAPI;
Invitrogen) was used as the mounting medium for glass coverslips. Images
were captured using an Olympus wideﬁeld BX51 upright microscope
featuring 4x/0.13 UPlanFLN, 10x/0.3 UPlanFLN, and 20x/0.5 UPlanFLN
objectives. Images were captured using a Coolsnap EZ camera (Photometrics, Herts, UK) and MetaVue Software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,
CA, USA). Speciﬁc band-pass ﬁlter sets were used for DAPI (31000v2,
BP350/50 nm), Alexa 488 (FITC 41001 BP480/40 nm), and Alexa 594 (Texas
Red 41004 BP560/55 nm). Settings remained constant, and a selected area
of the cerebral cortex at the same magniﬁcation (x20) was used across
groups for each speciﬁc marker.
Premounted sections for IL-1α and IL-1β immunohistochemistry were
performed to detect endogenous IL-1α and IL-1β expression. Sections were
mounted onto charged slides before antigen-retrieval step, during which
slides were submerged in citrate buffer (Invitrogen) diluted 1:100 in distilled
water. Slides in buffer were heated in a microwave for 10 minutes to remove
paraformaldehyde-induced crosslinks within the tissue. Sections were
blocked with endogenous peroxidase consisting of 10% methanol (Fisher,
Loughborough, UK) with 3% H2O2 (Sigma) in PBS containing 0.3% Triton
X-100 (Sigma). Sections were washed in PBS and incubated for 1 hour at
room temperature with 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) with 5% normal
rabbit serum (Vector Labs) in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma) to
block nonspeciﬁc binding, followed by overnight incubation at room
temperature with primary goat anti-mouse IL-1α or IL-1β IgG antibody
(1:500, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and subsequent incubation with
a biotinylated rabbit anti-goat antibody (1:500, Vector Labs) for 2 hours.
Sections were incubated for 1 hour with Vectastain ABC kit (Elite Standard;
Vector Labs) followed by nickel ammonia diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining—

with a 0.1-mol/L sodium acetate wash to initiate and stop DAB reaction—
followed by a ﬁnal dehydration step, in which slices were incubated in
ascending ethanol concentrations (70%, 90% and 100%) for 5 minutes each,
followed by a further 5-minute incubation in Ultraclear (TAAB Laboratories,
Berks, UK). Slides then underwent counterstain with cresyl violet (CV; see
protocol below) before coverslipping with DPX mounting medium (Agar
Scientiﬁc, Stansted, UK). Full-slice images were captured using a brightﬁeld
Olympus S2X9 microscope with GXCAM-1.3 video capture and highlight
3100 power source. GX-capture software was used for image acquisition
(Camera and software from GX Optical, Stansﬁeld, UK). Magniﬁcation and
light-illumination settings remained constant for capture of all images.
Extravasation of IgG through the leaky BBB and into the ipsilateral
hemisphere was detected by mouse IgG antibody DAB staining as
described above. IgG is easily detectable as it is found in large quantities
within systemic plasma (550 to 1900 mg/dL).25 The presence of IgG within
the brain parenchyma is therefore a reliable measure of BBB disruption.26
Free-ﬂoating immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the leakage
of endogenous IgG into the brain parenchyma as a measure of BBB
breakdown. Slices were loaded into wells with PBS and endogenous
peroxidases blocked with 1% H2O2. A second blocking agent, consisting of
5% normal horse serum (Vector Labs) and 2% bovine serum albumin in
PBS containing 0.3% Triton-X-100 (Sigma), was applied for 1 hour. Sections
were incubated with biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:500,
Vector Labs). Sections were incubated for 1 hour with ABC kit followed by
DAB staining with 0.1 mol/L sodium acetate wash to initiate and stop DAB
reaction. Sections were mounted on charged slides, dried and coverslipped
using DPX mounting medium.

Cresyl Violet Staining
Brain sections were mounted on gelatinized slides and initially soaked in
alcohol of increasing concentrations 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100% followed

Figure 1. Example color maps of ΔHbO2 in the three experimental groups. The ﬁrst two columns show the maps over the time course of the
experiment for the control and sham group. For the total time of nearly 7 hours animals in both groups are very stable and show only small
variations in the HbO2 concentrations. The third column of maps shows a typical animal in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (MCAo)
group. The sudden decrease in the HbO2 concentration gives instant feedback that the occlusion was successful. When removing the ﬁlament
we can see increased HbO2 in the branches of the MCA coming in from the left and the microvasculature supplying the parenchyma. This
initial reperfusion then fades away over time. The masked maps on the right show the areas that were considered for further analysis. Maps in
the ﬁrst two rows show change with respect to a time point before occlusion and the reperfusion maps show change with respect to the end
of the occlusion (scale bar = 1 mm, arrow points rostral).

by descending order again (4 minutes each concentration) to remove
lipids and ﬁxation chemicals from the tissue, sections are then submerged
with 1.5% CV staining solution. Sections underwent ascending alcohol
concentrations 50%, 70%, 90% and 100% (2 minutes each concentration)
to dehydrate the tissue. Ultraclear (4 minutes) was used as a clearing agent,
making unstained parts of the tissue transparent followed by coverslipping
with DPX mounting medium.

Data Analysis
Immunohistochemistry. Images of the cerebral cortex were collected from
ﬁve evenly spaced sections spanning the somatosensory cortex from both
hemispheres for comparison. IL-1α and IgG were quantiﬁed using changes
in measured pixel density between the cortex in the stroked left
hemisphere and the corresponding right hemispheres, using Image J
software (National Institute of Health, USA). IgG and IL-1α were quantiﬁed
by measuring the mean gray value (pixel density) of each hemisphere, the
value of which was subtracted from the absolute white value (max), and
comparing hemispheric values. Activated microglia (Iba-1) and platelet
cells (CD41) were double-blinded to eliminate bias and then counted
manually and in each hemisphere in a 0.46 × 0.34 mm size region of the
somatosensory cortex. Cresyl violet-positive (CV) cells for cortex counts
were centred on layer IV with a 0.3 × 0.3 mm region of interest for all
animals.
Spectroscopic imaging. First, imaging frames were separated according to
illumination wavelength, resulting in an effective frame rate of 7 Hz. These
single-wavelength data stacks were then averaged to obtain one single
grayscale image per wavelength for each set of 30 trials. The dependency
of multiwavelength optical imaging on photon pathlength was corrected
for using a modiﬁed Beer-Lambert Law.19,27 In the conversion from
grayscale to attenuation the sets of four images were compared between
different time points within the experiment. For example, to establish the
baseline variability in cortical HbO2 levels, we compared the two image
sets recorded before occlusion. To establish the extent of the decrease in
HbO2 during occlusion, we compared the set before occlusion with those
at the end of the 30-minute occlusion. All the remaining oxygenation maps
for the MCAo group were calculated by comparing the data at the end of
occlusion against the maps recorded in the 6 hours after the ﬁlament was
withdrawn (see Figure 1, third column of maps). For the other two
experimental groups (sham and control), we compared the equivalent
time points, though no actual occlusion took place (Figure 1, ﬁrst and
second column of maps). Once these maps were created, we produced a
single mask for each animal to exclude the large arteries and veins from
further analysis (Figure 1, fourth column of maps). This approach allowed
the calculation of μmolar changes in HbO2 concentration in the area of
microvascular perfusion of the parenchyma before, during and after
occlusion, as well as comparisons between groups.
For the visualization of the ΔHbO2 we created a μmol color scale, with
blue for a decrease, red an increase and with green colors indicating little
change compared with the reference time point (Figure 1, far right). For
statistical evaluation, the mean pixel values of the regions outside the
masks of the ΔHbO2 maps were calculated. Due to a slight variability of
carrying out the complex experiment, the timing within the MCAo group
for the data acquisition during early reperfusion ranged from 8 to 15
minutes after block removal and later reperfusion ranged from 345 to
360 minutes. The timing of baseline recordings and recordings during
occlusion was precise up to the minute.

RESULTS
Imaging of Loss in Reperfusion After Middle Cerebral Artery
Occlusion
Before investigating the change in HbO2 concentration caused by
ischemia, we established the interexperiment variability of the
HbO2 parameter (without any manipulation of blood ﬂow using
the ﬁlament). Baseline recordings from the three experimental
groups show small ﬂuctuations of ΔHbO2 between trials of
2.55 ±2.20 μmol in the MCAo group, 2.37 ± 4.7 μmol for the sham
group and 3.4 ± 4.36 μmol for the control group (see Figure 2,
Preocclusion). Nonsigniﬁcant variation was observed between
mean [HbO2] values for ﬁrst baseline readings compared with
second baseline readings across the experimental.
Once we moved the remote ﬁlament forward in the MCAo
group the ΔHbO2 displayed an 8-fold decrease within the stroked
hemisphere. ΔHbO2 values decreased to − 15.36 ± 5.93 μmol
compared with baseline level. Over the same time period, the
ﬂuctuations in the sham and control group remained at baseline
level with ΔHbO2 sham 1.85 ± 3.57 μmol and control 4.31 ± 3.1
μmol (Figure 2, Occlusion).
After 30 minutes of occlusion, we retracted the ﬁlament to allow
reperfusion to occur. There is an instant 2-fold increase in
oxygenated blood supply within microvessels supplying the brain
parenchyma with ΔHbO2 values of 8.22 ± 6.89 μmol compared
with levels at the end of the occlusion period (Figure 2, Early
Reperfusion). Again, in the sham and control groups, which did
not undergo occlusion, the HbO2 concentration recorded at the
equivalent time points remains similar to baseline ﬂuctuation
levels with ΔHbO2 values for sham − 0.80 ± 4.12 μmol and control
7.11 ± 4.13 μmol.
Over the 6 hours after retracting the remote ﬁlament occluding
the MCA we saw a signiﬁcant decline of the ΔHbO2 concentration.
The decrease of ΔHbO2 in the MCAo group is − 37.23 ± 16.52 μmol
compared with the last recording during occlusion. End point
sham and control animal ΔHbO2 were recorded at 1.54 ± 1.14
μmol and 9.15 ± 7.11 μmol, respectively (Figure 2, Late
Reperfusion).

Statistical Analysis
Animals were randomized for experiments and quantitative analyses were
double-blinded across all groups; control group n = 3, sham group n = 3,
MCAo group n = 9 (one mouse was excluded from group due to
hemorrhage). One-way ANOVA was used to compare mean HbO2
concentration change in μmolar values outside the masked regions in
the imaging data, coupled with Bonferroni multiple comparisons test in
histology data to indicate differences between the ipsilateral and
contralateral hemispheres, calculated and displayed as mean values with
error (± ) displayed by standard deviation. A Pearson’s rank correlation
coefﬁcient test was performed to measure the strength of association
between mean changes in ΔHbO2 concentration during occlusion and
during late reperfusion with CD41, Iba-1, IgG, IL-1α, and CV data.

Figure 2. Changes in oxyhemoglobin concentrations. Variations in
ΔHbO2 for all three groups at the preocclusion time point are small
and stable. The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) group
shows a signiﬁcant decrease in HbO2 during occlusion. The other
two groups remain stable at the equivalent time points. All of the
following changes are calculated with respect to the occlusion
value. There is an initial increase at the early reperfusion time point
in the HbO2 concentration for the MCAo group after removing the
ﬁlament. But by the late reperfusion time point the HbO2
concentration for the MCAo group has decreased signiﬁcantly
below the concentrations at the end of occlusion. The other two
groups show some ﬂuctuations but the changes are not signiﬁcant.

Signiﬁcant Change in Biomarkers of Ischemic Injury 6 Hours After
Stroke
Known markers of acute ischemic injury like CD41+ showing
platelets, Iba-1+ staining microglia, IgG and IL-1α as markers of
inﬂammation and BBB breakdown, differed signiﬁcantly between
the cortex of the stroked left hemisphere of the MCAo group mice
compared with their right cortex (see Figure 3 and Supplementary
Figure 2). These changes were also signiﬁcant compared with the
cortices in either hemisphere of the sham and control group.
These data provide further evidence that an ischemic challenge
was initiated using the remote ﬁlament and a 30 minute MCAo.
In the stroked animals, the 30-minute MCAO induced a 44%
increase in numbers of CD41+ platelets (P o0.01) in the left cortex
compared with the left cortex of the control group and a 40%
increase (Po 0.01) compared with sham group (Figure 3A). The
MCAo also induced a 31% increase in activation of Iba-1+
microglia (P o 0.01) in the stroked cortex compared with control
equivalent and a 22% increase compared with sham group
(Figure 3B). Detection of the pro-inﬂammatory cytokine IL-1α in
the stroked hemisphere was up by 7.55% compared with an
increase of 1.95% in the sham animals and − 1.02% in the control
group (Figure 3D; P o 0.01). Leakage of systemic protein IgG into
the stroked brain hemisphere was detected as an increase of
10.62% compared with the right hemisphere (Figure 3E). This
difference between the two hemispheres was signiﬁcantly bigger
than the difference in the sham (0.66%) and control group

(−0.42%; P o0.01). Cresyl violet stain revealed a reduction as well
as morphological changes of the cortical neurons in the stroked
hemisphere of the MCAo group, indicative of dying cells. Neurons
were more condensed with smaller cell bodies and displayed a
24% (P o 0.01) reduction in CV-stained cells compared with other
hemisphere as well as 18% 20%, 21%, and 22% compared with
sham ipsilateral and contralateral, control ipsilateral, and contralateral hemispheres, respectively (Figure 3C). Supplementary
Figure 2 A1 and A2 displays the CV stains from an MCAo animal.
Late Reperfusion Deﬁcit Correlates with Increased Pathology
To establish whether it is the lack of oxygenation during the acute
phase of the MCAo or the later decline in HbO2 concentration that
contributes most to the pathological damage shown in the
paragraph above, we ranked the individual animals in the MCAo
group according to the magnitude of ΔHbO2 at the late

plotted the magnitude of the histological correlates of the DAB
stains for IgG and IL-1α (Figure 4B) and the immunoﬂuorescence
stains and Nissl stain (Figure 4C). All the plots display a monotone
relationship between the late reperfusion deﬁcit and the
histological biomarkers.
To quantify this correlation, we performed a Pearson’s rank
coefﬁcient test to measure the strength of association between
the mean change in HbO2 during occlusion and late reperfusion
with known histological markers of acute ischemic injury (Iba-1,

Pearson’s rank coefﬁcient revealed that there is no signiﬁcant
correlation in the change of HbO2 concentration during the acute
ischemic event and the histological biomarkers in the MCAo
group but there is a signiﬁcant correlation for the late reperfusion
time point. The Pearson’s rank coefﬁcient found a signiﬁcant
association between late reperfusion ΔHbO2 values and Iba-1

DISCUSSION
By using a remote ﬁlament design in combination with 2D-OIS, we
are the ﬁrst group to quantify in the same animal the changes in
HbO2 concentration before, during, and after ischemia in a
preclinical model of stroke with high spatial and temporal
resolution. Our ﬁndings show that it is not the initial decrease in
HbO2 during occlusion that correlates to the histological
biomarkers but the ‘no reﬂow’ event, after block removal and
subsequent reperfusion that predicts pathophysiologic outcome.
Thus, the level of inﬂammation with neuronal damage correlates
with secondary decline of HbO2 and not occlusion.
Our study shows that the design of a remote ﬁlament allows
recordings of baseline HbO2 to be obtained and compared with
occlusion and reperfusion states. The observed decrease in HbO2
during occlusion ﬁts with the previous ﬁndings28,29 where similar
changes in HbO2 were sufﬁcient to induce neuronal damage.28
This response reveals the presence of an ischemic stroke; HbO2
levels decrease due to the cessation of blood ﬂow to the region of
interest (left somatosensory cortex). The lack of a resupply of
oxygenated blood coupled with the continued respiration of
neurons results in dramatic decreases in HbO2 levels in the
stroked cortex.30,31 The lack of signiﬁcant change in sham and
control data throughout the experiment reveals that HbO2
changes observed within the MCAo group result from the
transient ﬁlament occlusion and not overall decline of the animal
through the course of the experiment.
Upon reperfusion, HbO2 levels increase within the major vessels
and parenchymal regions, coinciding with the hyperemia phase
that has been previously documented.32,33 Hyperemia occurs as
ﬂow is restored to the cerebral cortex after removal of the block,
reintroducing oxygenated blood. This hyperemia upon reperfusion is thought to arise from vasoparalysis: loss of autoregulation
of cerebral blood ﬂow due to accumulation of lactic acid and
vasoactive mediators during occlusion.32,33 Over time, reperfusion
dissipates: the concentration of HbO2 starts to decrease within the
parenchyma, with only the major vessels retaining increased HbO2
levels as shown in Figure 1 similar to events reported by Kuo
et al.28 This dissipation could be linked to the presence of CD41
positive platelets that stick to the microvessel walls because of
adhesion molecule upregulation on the surface of endothelial cells
forming micro-thrombi aggregates within the stroked hemisphere
(Figure 3A). Ischemia-induced hypoxia is a powerful stimulus
for coagulation initiation and can thus lead to deﬁcits in
reperfusion.14,15,34 Hypoxia-induced platelet accumulation within
the microvasculature contributes to the ‘no reﬂow’ phenomenon.12,14,35 A state of no-reﬂow is established around 5 hours
after reperfusion, leading to neuronal loss. There appears to be an
overﬂow effect occurring within the contralateral hemisphere of
the MCAo group whereby increased numbers of CD41-positive
platelets and Iba1-positive activated microglia were found. This
suggests that a dampened pathophysiologic cascade has been
initiated within the contralateral (non-lesioned) hemisphere as
well as the ipsilateral (lesioned) hemisphere after 30 minutes of
focal ischemia.
Known markers of early inﬂammatory processes, microglia
activation, BBB breakdown, and neuronal loss were observed after
the ﬁrst 6 hours of reperfusion. Pathophysiologic changes at this
early time point are not well understood and many studies have
focused on time periods of more than 12 hours after stroke.8,36
Furthermore, very few studies in mice have used a transient model
of MCAo to investigate the acute phase of reperfusion. Neuronal
injury triggers activation of the resident immune cells of the brain,
microglia, upregulating Iba-1 protein at cell surface and initiating
early inﬂammatory processes.7,37 Activation of microglia leads to
the production and release of proinﬂammatory cytokines, including IL1α within 8 hours of reperfusion, which then switches to
IL-1β after 8 hours.9 IL-1α induces vascular endothelial cell

expression of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.38
These adhesion molecules trap platelets and circulating leukocytes in the lumen of microvessels, which contribute to BBB
breakdown. Evidence of BBB disruption was indicated by the
presence of IgG protein in the brain parenchyma (Figure 3E). IgG is
present within the plasma of the circulation throughout the body,
but does not pass the BBB unless disruption has occurred.8,25,26
Our results show neuronal loss by 6 hours after reperfusion,
supporting ﬁndings recorded from permanent occlusion studies in
rats.36,39,40
It is widely believed that the main predictor for pathophysiologic outcome and neuronal injury occurs as a consequence of
stroke severity whereby the worse the stroke, the worse the
outcome. We show however that the HbO2 decrease during
occlusion does not correlate with pathophysiologic outcome, but
that it is the HbO2 value at the end of 6 hours reperfusion that is
associated with pathophysiologic outcome.
In this study, we compared individual animals mean ΔHbO2 at
occlusion and at late reperfusion with immunohistochemistry
markers. The test revealed a strong correlation between the mean
change in μmol of HbO2 values at late reperfusion with increased
levels of pathophysiologic markers—CD41+ platelet aggregates,
Iba-1-positive activated microglia, IgG (representative of BBB
breakdown), IL-1α expression—as well as decreased numbers of
CV-stained neurons. A ﬂow-dependent response governs ischemic
pathology, as lack of reperfusion at acute time points correlates
with decreased neuronal survival.
Platelet aggregates present within the microvasculature of the
ischemic cerebral cortex were signiﬁcantly more prevalent in mice
where the lack of reperfusion at late stages was most severe. This
reveals a strong correlation between the outcome of reperfusion
and the number of platelet aggregates, suggesting an association
between increased numbers of platelet and lack of sustained
reperfusion within the cerebral cortex. Platelets produce and
release the proinﬂammatory cytokine IL-1α, which was detected in
the stroked hemisphere after 6 hours of reperfusion.38 This was
also seen in our MCAo animals.
We have demonstrated that 2D-OIS is an excellent tool to
investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of HbO2 changes
before, during, and after stroke. One disadvantage of these optical
approaches is that data acquisition is limited to cortical areas at
the surface of the brain. This is less of a problem in the
lissencephalic brain of a mouse but could be problematic in
species with a more folded cortex. Furthermore, it would be
interesting in the future to measure the actual tissue oxygenation
with either Clark style electrodes or oxygen-sensitive MRI.
In conclusion, we show for the ﬁrst time a method whereby an
ischemic stroke can be fully controlled within a mouse model in
such a way to allow the acquisition of baseline images for
comparison with occlusion and reperfusion states in the same
animal. Spectroscopic analysis of the imaging data produces color
maps that represent μmolar changes in the concentration of
HbO2, which show the effect of an ischemic challenge on
hemodynamic responses with high spatial and temporal

resolution. Immunohistochemistry analysis conﬁrms that the
ischemic challenge triggers early inﬂammatory biomarkers of
ischemia
and inﬂammation. The lack of reperfusion at later time points
correlates with decreased neuronal survival, suggesting a ﬂowdependent response. There is no correlation with the acute
decrease in HbO2 concentration during the occlusion. This ﬁnding
underpins the importance for future stroke research to focus on
overcoming the mechanisms that lead to a reduction in late
HbO2 perfusion. The ability to gain baseline recordings for
comparison within the same animal can create a platform for
drug development and testing as well as comparison between
comorbidity groups.
