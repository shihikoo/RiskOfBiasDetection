a b s t r a c t
It has been wildly accepted that willed movement(WM) training promotes neurological rehabilitation in
patients with stroke. However, it was not clear whether the effect of WM is better than other forms of
exercise. The purpose of this study is to assess different effects of WM and other forms of exercise on rats
with focal ischemia. The subjects are all had right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery and
randomly allocated to three groups of training and one control group with no training. Infarct volume
by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) dye, expression of PICK1 and synaptophysin in cerebral
cortex and striatum of injured side by western blotting and immunoﬂuorescence performed are analyzed.
Exercise has done respectively on rats in each group for 15 days and 30 days. Compared with the control
group, the brain damage is reduced in other groups after 15 days exercise. The protein expressions levels of
synaptophysin and PICK1 are upregulated after exercise. Concentration of PICK1 protein in WM is greater
than other exercise groups, and the expression of synaptophysin in WM and SM groups are higher than
EM groups. The number of PICK1 positive cells, synaptophysin and PICK1 co-positive cells are increased
by exercise. Synaptophysin is widely distributed in cortex surrounding the injury area in WM and EM. It
is indicated in our result that willed-movement training is the most effective intervention in enhancing
the PICK1-mediated synaptic plasticity in the area adjacent to the damage region of ischemic rats.

1. Introduction
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and adult disability
in the world. Rehabilitation plays a key role in therapeutic process
in addition to drug interventions. The role of Motor skill training
accompanied by perception training in rehabilitation is well established (Schweighofer et al., 2012; Summa et al., 2011), and there
is considerable evidence of the value of voluntary motor training as a neuromotor intervention in stroke rehabilitation (Uysal
et al., 2015; Ke et al., 2011a). Willed-movement (WM) training
(Waterland, 1967) is deﬁned as a task-oriented training with fully
voluntary motor training and arouse the enthusiasm of patient.
Identiﬁcation of functional molecules in the brain related to
improvement of motor dysfunction and perception after stroke
(Ploughman et al., 2009) will contribute to establish a new treat-

ment strategy for stroke rehabilitation. Those molecules participate
in promoting neuron growth, the processes of plasticity and longterm memory formation after cerebral ischemia injury.
Synaptophysin(SYP) contributes to the structure and function of
synapsis, and its upregulation might be involved in synaptic plasticity. Exercise could promote the expression of SYP in rats subjected
to cerebral ischemia (Lan et al., 2014).
AMPA
(␣-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic
acid) receptors mediate most of the excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. Therefore, alterations in AMPA receptors number
or function at the synapse (Lee, 2011; Malinow and Malenka, 2002)
might regulate synaptic strength. PICK1 (protein interacting with
C-kinase 1) has been implicated in the regulation of AMPA receptors trafﬁcking (Hanley, 2006; Jin et al., 2006) underlying several
forms of synaptic plasticity. PICK1 was called a multi-talented
modulator of AMPA receptor trafﬁcking (Hanley, 2008). However,
there were few report about the role of PICK1 in the recovery of
cerebral ischemic model.

Hence, the purpose of our study is to investigate the effect of
WM training on brain damage. The expression patterns of SYP and
PICK1 were assess in rats with cerebral ischemia underwent exercises, and we speculate that WM might superior than other exercise
after stroke and PICK1 might contribute to neuronal plasticity in
rehabilitation process of focal ischemia rats.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Subjects
One hundred and twenty-one male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250–280 g at the time of surgery were used in this study.
Animals were housed in Plexiglas cages on a 12:12 h light: dark
cycle at 23 ± 2 ◦ C room temperature. All procedures were performed during the animals’ light phase. These experiments were
performed in accordance with the guidelines for the care and use
of animals approved by the animal ethics committees of Central
South University. Rats were moderately food restricted (deprived
of food for 12 h from9 p.m. to 9 a.m. of the next day) to motivate
performance on the reaching task.
2.2. Rehabilitation protocols
The training apparatus design with herringbone ladder was similar to Tang (Tang et al., 2007). Prior to infarct induction, animals
were pre-trained in the apparatus over three consecutive days.
According to Longa et al. (1989) and Tang et al. (2013), rats with
a modiﬁed neurological deﬁcit score(NDS) of 2 and 3, as evaluated
at 2 h after MCAO surgery, were used in this study. Three days after
subjected right middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery, ischemic
animals were stratiﬁed randomly assigned to four training conditions according to neurological deﬁcit score:1.Willed-movement
training (WM) rats need to climb the ladder or walls of the apparatus to reaching food and water,the exercise lasts for 30 min/day;
2. environmental modiﬁcation(EM) rats can climb the ladder voluntarily but never need to climb in the training apparatus to get
food and water;3.forced swimming exercise (SE); rats are forced to
swim for 15 min in a round glass tank (24 cm W × 44 cm H) ﬁlled to a
depth of 30 cm with water (25 ± 1 ◦ C) 4. Control (no rehabilitation).
Rehabilitation training lasts for 30 consecutive days.
2.3. Neurological and neurobehavioral assessments
Neurological examinations were performed on the exercise
beginning day and then on days 3, 7, 15, and 30 post-exercise until
sacriﬁce using the NDS as above. Investigators performing the outcome testing were kept blind to the group assignments. Only the
subjects lasts 30 days of training were brought into statistical analysis, but rats with 15 days training before executed and dead on the
training way were excluded from it.
2.4. TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride) staining
15 days after the training started, cerebral infarct volume was
measured in 6 animals from each group. Rats were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (65 mg/kg, intraperitoneally)
and immediately decapitated, their whole brains were rapidly
removed and frozen at −20 ◦ C for 20 min. And then cut into
6 2-mm-thick coronal sections, and sections were stained with
2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)(Sigma–Aldrich, USA)
solution at 37 ◦ C for 30 min. Stained slides were immersed in 4%
paraformaldehyde at 4 ◦ C overnight. The infarct area of each section
was measured using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernet-

91

ics Inc, Rockville, MD), and the total infarct volumes were calculated
based on the formula which Swanson (Swanson et al., 1990) used.
2.5. Western blotting
Two sets of animals (n = 6 for each group) that performed until
the 15th day and 30th day of intervention were used, and their
brains get as above. For western blot analyses, the cortex and
striatum adjacent to the injury brain were isolated for protein harvest. These tissue were extracted with RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime,
Shanghai, China) supplemented with PMSF. The concentration in
the tissue samples was determined by using the Bradford method
of using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Protein lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to
0.45 um PVDF membranes(Millipore, USA); each sample was run
at least twice. The membranes were blocked in 5% BSA overnight
at 4 ◦ C and followed by incubation in primary antibody at 4 ◦ C
overnight. Primary antibodies used were as follows: Rabbit antiSYP (1:10000, Abcam, USA), Mouse anti-PICK1 (1:5000, Abcam,
USA) and Mouse anti-beta-actin(1:5000, Abcam, USA). Blots were
washed (3 × 10 min) in TBS containing 0.05% Tween (TBS-T, Sigma,
USA), after incubation with HRP- labeled donkey secondary antibody (Anti-Mouse, 1:2000, Anti-Rabbit, 1:2000) (Invitrogen, USA)
and washed in TBS-T (3 × 10 min), protein bands were visualized
using Amersham ECL Prime (GE Healthcare, NJ, USA) on GelDoc XR
System (Bio-rad, USA) and quantiﬁed by NIH ImageJ software version 9.0. The intensities of the PICK1 and SYP protein bands were
all normalized to ␤-actin.
2.6. Immunoﬂuorescence
After training for 15 days, rats were deeply anesthetized
with sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with cold
heparinized saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphatebuffered saline. Brains (each group n = 6) were removed from
the skull, ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered
saline for 90 min at 4 ◦ C, and then transferred in turn to 20% and
30% sucrose at 4 ◦ C overnight. Thirty ␮m-thick coronal sections
were cut with Leica CM1900 cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) beginning 5 mm from the anterior tip of the frontal
lobe to 9 mm sections(Ashwal et al., 1998; Paxinos and Watson,
2007) were pretreated with 10 mM citrate buffer pH 6.1 for 15 min
at 90 ◦ C in a steamer and then permeabilized with 0.1% TritonX-100
in PBS and blocked 30 min in PBS containing 5% normal Donkey
Serum (Sigma–Aldrich, USA). After that, sections were incubated
with Mouse anti-PICK1 (1:5000, Abcam, USA) and Rabbit anti-SYP
(1:10000, Abcam, USA) ut supra at 4 ◦ C for 48 h. Fluorescent detection was obtained by secondary incubation with donkey antisera
speciﬁc against rabbit IgG coupled with AlexaFluor-488 (Invitrogen, 1:100, Germany) and donkey against mouse IgG coupled with
Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen, 1:100, Germany) respectively 2 h at
37 ◦ C. Sections were mounted on Polysine slides in an Antifade
Mounting Medium (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) before being examined. An inverted ﬂuorescence microscope (Eclipse T1, Nikon,
Melville, NY) and a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM510,
Zeiss; Jena, Germany) were used to examine immunoﬂuorescence staining ﬂuorescence micrographs. Speciﬁcity of the protein
expression was assessed by counting the number of antibodypositive cells in each scanning ﬁeld with Image-Pro Plus 6.0(Media
Cybernetics Inc, Rockville, MD).
2.7. Statistical analysis
SPSS software (version 18.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was
used for data analysis. One-way ANOVA followed by LSD-t post hoc
test was used to assess the differences of infarct volumes between

groups and result of immunoﬂuorescence staining. Repeated measures ANOVA determined differences in NDS and targets protein
expression among groups with time.
3. Result
Eighteen rats died during the experimental period and six rats
were excluded from the study because of with either higher or
lower neurological deﬁcit score. Only 96 survived rats with neurological deﬁcit score of 2 and 3 at 2 h after recirculation were used
in the experience.
3.1. Neurological and neurobehavioral assessments
The animals subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion
showed the largest neurological deﬁcits 3 days after ischemia
(rehabilitation training starts on that day) compared to other time
points. But, scores in four groups were all in a downward trend
over time after rehabilitation begins, which fully indicates neurological deﬁcits in cerebral ischemia rats would be slowly recovery
whether with exercise or not (Fig. 1). Through repeated measurements of the variance of four groups in neurological deﬁcit score,
we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant effect of training on ameliorating neurological
deﬁcit. (F(3,20) = 3.74 P < 0.05), Subsequent multiple comparisons
showed that neurological deﬁcits recovery in control group was
more slowly than groups with exercise. (Student–Newman–Keuls
test, P < 0.05), but there were no difference between the effection of
WM, EM and SM on rehabilitation of neurologic function(p > 0.05).
3.2. Infarct volume
Cerebral infarctions were found in the hemisphere ipsilateral to
the occlusion (right side) in animals that were exposed to MCAO
surgery. Unstained areas were deﬁned as infarcted tissue, and
normal tissue was stained red. As shown in (Fig. 2A), the infarct
area was in accordance with the distribution area of MCA in rats.
Comparison of infarct volumes percentage showed a statistical
difference between the 4 groups (F(3,20) = 5.92, p < 0.05). Multiple comparisons showed that infarction volumes of control group
(19.76 ± 4.35%, n = 6) were greater than all three exercise groups.
The average infarct volumes of WM (12.84 ± 3.79%, n = 6) were not
smaller than EM (13.66 ± 5.14%, n = 6) and SM (14.6 ± 3.50%, n = 6)
groups after consecutive training 15 days(p > 0.05).
3.3. Effects of exercise regimens on brain levels of SYP and PICK1
In this study, the expression of two components in the lesion
periphery areas of ischemia (Cortex and striatum) (each subgroup

n = 6) are characterized. By Western Blot analysis, the proteins
(Fig. 3A) and compared expression levels among four groups are
quantiﬁed to assess any differences in the training conditions.
ANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant effect of training×time
(F(3,40) = 13.95; P < 0.05) on the ratio of SYP to ␤-actin, training factor (F(3,40) = 89.89, P < 0.05), time factor (F(1,40) = 114.07,
P < 0.05). Subsequent multiple comparisons showed that rehabilitation had signiﬁcantly elevated SYP levels compared with the
control groups (Fig. 3B, Student–Newman–Keuls test, P < 0.05). The
expression of SYP in EM groups were slight higher than the control
groups, but below the WM and SM groups(P < 0.05). However,
there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in the level of SYP
between WM and SM groups over time (P = 0.094). As time went
by, SYP Protein levels increased in three training groups(pairedsamples t-test,P < 0.05), whereas there is no difference in the
control groups at both time points(Fig. 3B).
ANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant effect of training×time
(F(3,40) = 7.32; P < 0.05). the training factor (F(3,40) = 133.25,
P < 0.05), time factor (F(1,40) = 155.15, P < 0.05). Subsequent multiple comparisons showed that the expression of PICK1 in WM
groups was greater than other groups. The effect of SM was second,
and EM groups had high levels of PICK1 levels compared to the
control groups (Fig. 3C Student–Newman–Keuls test, P < 0.05).
Finally, PICK1 Protein levels increased over time in all four groups
(Fig. 3C paired-samples t-test P < 0.05).

3.4. Immunoﬂuorescence

4. Discussion

The expression of SYP in the motor cortex of penumbra
area reﬂected the number of synaptic vesicle adjacent to the
injury objectively. Exercise increased the expression of PICK1
and SYP, this was further corroborated by immunoﬂuorescence
with concentration of green ﬂuorophore which anti-PICK1 antibody be marked with and red ﬂuorophore which represented
SYP distribution (Fig. 4A–D). Percentage of SYP positive cells in
four groups were inconsistent (F(3,20) = 29.62, p < 0.05). Multiple comparison showed that SM and Control were smaller than
EM (Table 1 p < 0.05). Expression of SYP in WM was the most
extensive (p < 0.05). Percentage of PICK1 positive cells in four
groups were also inconsistent (F(3,20) = 28.62, p < 0.05). LSD-t
test conﬁrming that the Control displayed litter staining compared with rehabilitation groups (Table 1, p < 0.05). Expression of
PICK1 in WM group was extensive compared with EM and SM
(p < 0.05). Nevertheless, confocal microscope analysis of ﬂuorescent image revealed that part overlap between the expression
of PICK1 and SYP in neuron cells (Fig. 4E), the two targets were
obviously different in intracellular distribution position. SYP protein was mainly distributed on nerve neuron membrane, but
PICK1 was localized in the cytoplasm of the cells largely. Percentage of SYP and PICK1 positive cells in WM group was not
differ from other training groups, but greater than that in no
rehabilitation control group (Table 1). ANOVA revealed that rehabilitation increased the number of SYP and PICK1 co-positive cells
(F(3,20) = 19.81, p < 0.05), WM training enhanced the co-expression
of SYP and PICK1 mostly in this study. (p < 0.05). Consistent
with previous experiment, we detected the co-positive neuron
radio in EM and SM was larger than that in the control group
(p < 0.05).

Increasing evidence suggests that damage to the adult brain
could result in adaptive plasticity in regions adjacent to the injury,
such as increased dendritic arbors and synaptogenesis (Jones et al.,
1999; Bury and Jones, 2002). Drug therapy in ischemia stroke,
which has been studied for decades, can protect the rat brain from
ischemic damage caused by MCAO (Zhang et al., 2014). Meanwhile,
the plastic changes may be modulated by post-injury rehabilitation training. Exercise is an effective way (Fang et al., 2010;
Timmermans et al., 2010) to reduce damage in cerebral ischemia.
It was reported that physical activity signiﬁcantly reduced neurologic deﬁcits and infarct volume (Li et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2007) in
the frontoparietal cortex and the dorsolateral striatum of rats with
cerebral ischemia. The results of our previous (Tang et al., 2013) and
present study were in consistent with those ﬁndings. In the present
study, we found that the infarction volumes of rats without exercise
(control group) was larger than exercise groups (WM, EM, and SM
groups) and NDS in control group was much higher than groups
with exercise. An unanticipated ﬁnding in our study, however, is
the lack of signiﬁcant variance among WM, EM an SM in infarction
volumes. This is unexpected since Ke et al. (2011b) and Ploughman
et al. (2005) have reported that the forced exercise was the least
neuro-protective intervention with high-pressure exercise.
SYP contributes to the structure and function of synapsis
(Valtorta et al., 2004; Thiel, 1993), and its upregulation might be
involved in synaptic plasticity(Bai and Strong, 2014). Complex environment housing independently increased the number of synaptic
mitochondria (Briones et al., 2005) in presynaptic terminals in the
region adjacent to the site of the principal insult. In our study, we
found SYP concentrations signiﬁcantly higher in all exercise groups
than control groups. And WM was more useful in formation of new
synapses than EM, which was consistent with our inference. There

was no difference in the level of SYP in WM and SM, which suggests
that the willing training is not the main factor to affect structure
and function of synapsis in the process of recovery after brain damage. When concerning the alteration of SYP between 15 and 30
days after exercise initiate, we found that level of SYP increased as
exercise went on. The result indicates that the duration of training is an independent factor conductive to synapse formation and
strengthen the synaptic plasticity.
PICK1 has increasingly been recognized as a key regulator of
AMPA receptor trafﬁcking. Different from simply regulating the
number of AMPARs at the synapse, recent reports (Cull-Candy et al.,
2006; Isaac et al., 2007) suggest that PICK1 is involved in both
plasticity and pathological mechanisms after cerebral ischemic.
Previous studies (Tang et al., 2013) had reported WM exercise result
in an increase of PICK1 protein and a recovery of motor function in
ischemic rats. Compared to other groups, our date also shows that
WM training can lead to the increasing expression of PICK1 and
reduce brain damage signiﬁcantly. The level of PICK1 protein in EM
and SM also increased compared to the control. We conclude that
PICK1 might contribute to neuroprotection and neuronal plasticity
in rehabilitation process of focal ischemia rats.
Recent randomized controlled trials (Lan et al., 2014; Tang et al.,
2013; Qian et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2013) point out that SYP is
widely distributed in cortex and hippocampus of ischemic peripheral in rehabilitation process and PICK1 is abundantly expressed
in the cortex, neural nuclei below the putamenand thalamus, but
much less expressed in the hippocampus. Our study also showed
SYP and PICK1 was expressed in abundance in motor cortex area
adjacent to damage. SYP and PICK1 positive cell radio following WM
training is signiﬁcantly higher than the other two types of rehabilitation, which suggested that exercise with will, purpose and no
stress might be more appropriate for the growth of new branches
on the neurons and synaptic plasticity related proteins synthesis in
rats with cerebral ischemia.
All in all, our ﬁndings demonstrate that WM training results in a
decreased brain damage and an increase of synaptic number morphologically, an increase of PICK1 protein in the IP. It is concluded
that WM training was the most effective intervention in enhancing
the PICK1-mediated synaptic plasticity in the PI region of ischemic
rats. Further study is needed to ﬁgure out which forms of synaptic plasticity PICK1-mediated from the view of electrophysiology
and molecular mechanisms of that following WM training after the
ischemic events with application of translational electrophysiological and neuroimaging methods, which illustrate ischemia area and
damage degree (Moyanova and Dijkhuizen, 2014) more accurately
than the methods in this paper.
