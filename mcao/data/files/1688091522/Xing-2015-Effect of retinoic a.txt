Summary: The purpose of this study was to observe the expression of LINGO-1 after cerebral ischemia,
investigate the effects of retinoic acid (RA) on the expression of LINGO-1 and GAP-43, and the number
of synapses, and to emplore the repressive effect of LINGO-1 on neural regeneration after cerebral
ischemia. The model of permanent focal cerebral ischemia was established by the modified suture
method of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The expression of
LINGO-1 was detected by Western blotting and that of GAP-43 by immunohistochemistry. The number
of synapses was observed by transmission electron microscopy. The SD rats were divided into three
groups: sham operation (sham) group, cerebral ischemia (CI) group and RA treatment (RA) group. The
results showed that the expression level of LINGO-1 at 7th day after MCAO in sham, CI and RA groups
was 0.266±0.019, 1.215±0.063 and 0.702±0.081, respectively (P<0.01). The number of Gap-43-positive
nerve cells at 7th day after MCAO in sham, CI and RA group was 0, 59.08±1.76 and 76.20±3.12 per
high power field, respectively (P<0.05). The number of synapses at 7th day after MCAO was 8.42±0.13,
1.74±0.37 and 5.39±0.26 per μm2, respectively (P<0.05). It is concluded that LINGO-1 expression is
up-regulated after cerebral ischemia, and RA inhibits the expression of LINGO-1, promotes the
expression of GAP-43 and increases the number of synapses. It suggests that LINGO-1 may be involved
in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia, which may provide an experimenal basis for LINGO-1
antogonist, RA, for the treatment of cerebral ischemia.

The lack of regeneration after central nervous
system injury was the main cause of permanent
neurological damage. In recent years, researches on
Nogo and inhibition of neurite regeneration became a
hotspot[1]. Nogo receptor complex consists of Nogo
receptor 1 (NgR1), LINGO-1, and p75NTR or TROY[2].
LINGO-1 (LRR and Ig domain-containing Nogo
receptor interacting protein) is an important
transmembrane protein in the Nogo receptor complex,
expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes of the central
nervous system. Experiments in vitro and in vivo
confirmed that LINGO-1 negatively regulated
oligodendrocyte differentiation, myelination, neuronal
survival and axonal regeneration[3]. However, few studies
reported the role of LINGO-1 in the recovery of nerves
after cerebral ischemia.
This study investigated the expression of LINGO-1
after cerebral ischemia, and the effect of retinoic acid
(RA) on the expression of LINGO-1, GAP-43 and the
number of synapses, aimed to explore the possible role
of LINGO-1 in nerve regeneration after cerebral ischemia, and speculated that the up-regulation of LINGO-1

expression may be one of the reasons why nerve regeneration is impeded after cerebral ischemia.
1 MATERIALS AND METHODS
1.1 Experimental Animals and Grouping
Forty-five adult male Sprague-Dawlery (SD) rats,
weighing 180–200 g, were provided by the Animal Experimental Center of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong
University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.
The experiments were divided into three groups (with
five rats in each group): sham operation (sham) group,
cerebral ischemia (CI) group and RA treatment (RA)
group. RA was insoluble in water, but soluble in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), so RA was formulated into
3 mg/mL solution with DMSO. In sham or CI group,
each rat was daily intraperitoneally injected with 0.6 mL
solvent DMSO 24 h after sham operation or CI. In RA
group, each rat was daily intraperitoneally injected with
RA (10 mg/kg, 0.6 mL solution) 24 h after CI. Seven
days later, rats were decapitated for the next experiment.
This study was performed with the approval of the local
ethical committee and all the experiments were
performed according to the National Institutes of Health
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
1.2 Animal Model of Permanent Focal Cerebral
Ischemia
Rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (3
mL/kg) by intraperitoneal injection. Animal body tem-

perature was maintained normal with a heat lamp during
operation. The right common carotid, external carotid,
and internal carotid arteries were in turn exposed through
a midline cervical incision, and the common carotid artery was ligated. A 40-mm length filament (diameter:
0.20 mm or 0.24 mm), with its tip being rounded and
coated with poly-l-lysine, was inserted through common
and internal carotid artery, and advanced to the anterior
cerebral artery until the distance between the black mark
of filament and the bifurcation of the common carotid
artery was about 2 mm. The total length of inserted filament was 20 mm. Thus, the middle cerebral artery was
occluded. Then, the incision was closed, and the rats returned to their cage. Sham-operated animals underwent
the same surgical procedure, but the total length of inserted filament was only 10 mm.
1.3 Western Blot Analysis for LINGO-1 Protein
Rats were deeply anesthetized and decapitated. The
sample was taken from the peri-infarcted cerebral tissues
and homogenized with a homogenizer in lysis buffer
(0.01 mol/L, pH 7.2, PBS). The homogenates were
centrifuged at 12 000 g for 8 min at 4°C. The supernatant
for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
was diluted with 5-fold buffer, and then boiled for 10
min. The separation gel and spacer gel were prepared,
and the sample was added. Electrophoresis was
performed as follows: At beginning, the voltage was 80
V; once the sample was removed from the spacer gel, the
voltage was increased to 180 V. Electrophoresis was
stopped while bromophenol blue ran to the bottom of the
separation gel. The protein on separation gel was
transferred onto PVDF membranes. Then, the membrane
was incubated in 5% skimmed milk at room temperature
for 1 h to block nonspecific binding, and then probed
with the primary anti-LINGO-1 antibody (dilution
1:1000; Upstate, USA) and anti-β-actin antibody
(dilution 1:1000; Santa Cruze, USA) overnight at 4°C.
The membranes were washed three times for 10 min with
0.05% Tween-20, and then incubated with a
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (dilution 1:4000;
Amersham, USA) at room temperature for 2 h.
Immunodetection was performed with an enhanced
chemiluminescent (ECL) substrate (P0018; BeyoECL
Plus, China). The signals were quantified with an image
analyzer (ChemiDocXRS; Chemilumin escense imaging
system; Bio-Rad, USA). Densitometry analysis was
carried out with Image Lab 3.0 software. Quantitative
results were obtained by measuring absorbance (A) value
of each band. The expression ratio of each targeted
protein to β-actin represented the expression of
1.4 Immunohistochemistry for GAP-43
LINGO-1.
Rats were deeply anesthetized and perfused through
heart with buffered saline at 37°C, and then with 4%
paraformaldehyde at 4°C. Brains were removed and immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C, and
then cut into 1-cm thick blocks which were embedded in
paraffin. The embedded blocks were cut into 5-μm thick
sections that were mounted on glass slides. Mounted tissue sections were deparaffinized, hydrated and placed in
10 mmol/L sodium citrate (pH 6.0), heated to boiling for
2 min for antigen retrieval. These sections reacted with

3% hydrogen peroxide in absolute methanol at room
temperature for 10 min to abolish endogenous peroxidase-like activity. All tissues were incubated in the appropriate blocking solution (5% BSA) for 20 min, and
then washed twice in PBS for 3 min. The slides were
removed to humidified chambers, incubated with rabbit
anti-GAP-43 antibody (1:500) overnight at 4°C. After
that, these sections were treated with biotinylated secondary antibody (REALTMEnVision+/HRP RABBIT/MOUSE) for 50 min, and then visualized with 3,3-diaminoben-zidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB, REALTMEnVision+/HRP RABBIT/MOUSE). Finally, these
sections were dehydrated and covered with coverslips.
Immunostained sections were observed by XSP-C204
microscope. The number of positive cells was measured
in five rectangles of high power field and analyzed by
image analysis software (Image-Pro Plus 6.0).
1.5 Transmission Electron Microscopy
Rats were deeply anesthetized and perfused through
heart with buffered saline at 37°C, and then with 4%
paraformaldehyde at 4°C. Their brains were removed
and immediately immersed into 2.5% glutaraldehyde on
ice and fixed for 2 h, and then washed in 0.1 mol/L PB,
and cut into 1-mm3 tissue blocks which were then
post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 2 h. The blocks
were rinsed several times in distilled water, dehydrated
in graded series of aceton followed by ethanol gradient
dehydration, and finally embeded in pure Epon812.
Ultrathin sections were obtained on a German
LEICAULTRACUTUCT ultramicrotome, collected on
copper grids, and stained with 4% uranyl acetate and
lead citrate. The sections were imaged with Netherlands
FEI Tecnai G i 12 TEM. The synaptic density was
analysed by the automatic colorimage-analying system
(HPIAS-1000)
1.6 Statistical Analysis
All data are expressed as ±s. Statistical analysis was performed by using a one-way ANOVA, Graphpad 5.0
statistical software. P value less than 0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.
2 RESULTS
2.1 Effect of RA on Expression of LINGO-1 after
Cerebral Ischemia
The expression of LINGO-1 protein was observed
after cerebral ischemia (fig. 1). Results showed that the
increasing expression of LINGO-1 protein was inhibited
by RA after cerebral ischemia.
2.2 Expression of GAP-43 in Nerve Cells after
Cerebral Ischemia
The positive expression of GAP-43 in RA, CI and
sham groups was detected by immunohistochemical
staining technique (table 1 and fig. 2). GAP-43 expression was mainly concentrated on the nerve cell membrane in the accurate penumbra area. The positive cells
stained brown or yellow brown colors. The results
showed that the expression of GAP-43 was not detectable in the sham group, but increased remarkably in the
CI group, and jumped to the highest level in the RA
group.

3 DISCUSSION
Following nerve injury, myelin associated inhibitory
factors bind to Nogo receptor (NgR) complex. Then,

RhoA and RhoA kinase (ROCK) are activated in turn.
Activated ROCK changes cytoskeletal dynamics, leading
to collapse of growth cone within neurons. Thereby, axonal regeneration is inhibited[1]. Researches have shown

57

J Huazhong Univ Sci Technol [Med Sci] 35(1):2015

that NgR complex, a kind of CNS myelin protein, played
a key role in inhibiting neurite growth[4]. LINGO-1 is
necessary for the NgR complex which consists of NgR,
LINGO-1, and p75NTR or TROY, and can transmit
myelin inhibitory signals[5]. LINGO-1 is a kind of specific protein in brain, highly expressed in neurons and
oligodendrocytes of brain, co-distributed with NgR, expressed at low level in spinal cord except for other body
tissues. So far, it is unclear whether the expression of
LINGO-1 protein increases or decreases after cerebral
ischemia. This study proved that the expression of
LINGO-1 significantly increased after cerebral ischemia.
It suggested that LINGO-1 may be one of the causes for
inhibition of nerve regeneration after cerebral ischemia.
Researches had shown that NgR antagonists could
increase axonal regeneration[6]. LINGO-1, as an important part of the NgR complex, negatively regulates oligodendrocytes differentiation, myelinogenesis, neuron
survival and axonal regeneration[3]. RA is a kind of biologically active derivative of vitamin A. It was a small
lipophilic molecule which can cross the blood brain barrier and then potentially reach all the injured neurons.
Recently, RA is shown to directly and transcriptionally
inhibit expression of LINGO-1 under an axonal growth
inhibitory environment in vitro as well as spinal injury in
vivo[7]. The mechanism is that there is a direct relationship between pathway of RA receptor β and that of NgR
complex during the process of neurite extension and regeneration[7]. After RA binds to RA receptor β, RA binds
to RA reaction components (RARE) within the LINGO-1
promoter, which inhibites the LINGO-1 gene transcription, thus reduces RhoA activation and promotes axonal
sprouting and functional recovery[7]. Researches have
shown that LINGO-1 inhibited differentiation of oligodendrocytes and synthesis of myelin through interactions of cells in multiple sclerosis[8]. Antibodies against
LINGO-1 promoted the remyelination in multiple sclerosis patients[9]. Knockout of LINGO-1 gene promoted the
differentiation of oligodendrocytes and remyelination[10].
In this study, LINGO-1 expression was repressed by RA
treatment after cerebral ischemia. It suggests that
LINGO-1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of
cerebral ischemia.
Growth associate protein (GAP-43), a phosphoprotein which mainly exists in neuronal growth cone and
presynaptic membrane[11], plays a critical role in promoting nerve sprouting and eliciting outgrowth of neurites in transgenic mice and in cultured cells[12]. Normal
nervous system does not express GAP-43. While the
nervous system injury happens, GAP-43 expression begins to grow. Thus, GAP-43 is a preferred molecular
probe in neural plasticity studies and a molecular marker
of axonal regeneration. The upregulation of GAP-43 expression markedly promotes neuronal growth and axon
regeneration. The GAP-43 level increasing may be one
of mechanisms by which functional recovery can be obtained after cerebral ischemia[13]. It had also been proven
that GAP-43 is involved in synaptic plasticity. Neurons
expressed high levels of GAP-43 during axonal growth
and synaptogenesis whereas GAP-43 levels declined
sharply once synaptic connections became mature.
Communication between neurons usually occurs at
specialized junctions called synapses. Synaptic plasticity
referrs to the variability in synaptic morphology and
function. The increase of synaptic density indicates that
new synaptic connections develop, which can give rise to
the corresponding change of nervous system function.
Synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system is the
basis of neurological rehabilitation. In this experiment,

GAP-43 expression increased and the number of synapses decreased after cerebral ischemia. Compared to CI
group, RA group had more GAP-43 expression and synaptic number, indicating that RA promoted nerve growth.
This study showed that RA inhibited LINGO-1 expression, increased GAP-43 expression and synaptic
number, thus promoted nerve regeneration after cerebral
ischemia. It may provide an experimenal basis for
LINGO-1 antogonist, RA, for the treatment of cerebral
ischemia. However, the complicated molecular mechanism of RA against LINGO-1 on nerve regeneration
warrants further study.
