Abstract
Activation of a-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (a-7 nAchR) has a neuro-protective effect on ischemic and hemorrhagic
stroke. However, the underlying mechanism is not completely understood. We hypothesized that a-7 nAchR agonist
protects brain injury after ischemic stroke through reduction of pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1) and oxidative stress.
C57BL/6 mice were treated with PHA568487 (PHA, a-7 nAchR agonist), methyllycaconitine (MLA, nAchR antagonist), or
saline immediately and 24 hours after permanent occlusion of the distal middle cerebral artery (pMCAO). Behavior test,
lesion volume, CD68+, M1 (CD11b+/Iba1+) and M2 (CD206/Iba1+) microglia/macrophages, and phosphorylated p65
component of NF-kB in microglia/macrophages were quantified using histological stained sections. The expression of M1
and M2 marker genes, anti-oxidant genes and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase were
quantified using real-time RT-PCR. Compared to the saline-treated mice, PHA mice had fewer behavior deficits 3 and 7 days
after pMCAO, and smaller lesion volume, fewer CD68+ and M1 macrophages, and more M2 macrophages 3 and 14 days
after pMCAO, whereas MLA’s effects were mostly the opposite in several analyses. PHA increased anti-oxidant genes and
NADPH oxidase expression associated with decreased phosphorylation of NF-kB p65 in microglia/macrophages. Thus,
reduction of inflammatory response and oxidative stress play roles in a-7 nAchR neuro-protective effect.

ischemic injury, experiencing an early ‘‘healthy’’ M2 phenotype,
followed by a transition to a ‘‘sick’’ M1 phenotype [12]. Thus,
reduction of the M1/M2 microglia/macrophage ratio both at the
acute and chronic stages of stroke might improve stroke recovery.
Reducing inflammation at the acute stage of ischemic stroke has
been shown to attenuate brain damage and improve functional
outcomes [8]. The physiological regulation of the innate immune
system has been used in the treatment of infectious or inflammatory diseases [13,14]. One of the regulatory targets is a-7 nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor (a-7 nAchR), which is expressed on the
surface of systemic macrophages as well as on neurons, microglia,
and endothelial cells of the mammalian brain [15–19]. Activation
of a-7 nAchR attenuates macrophage production of inflammatory
cytokines and inhibits the inflammation process [13,20,21]. a-7
nAchR agonist treatment has reduced brain injury in a
subarachnoid hemorrhage rat model [16] and conferred neuroprotection in an intracerebral hemorrhage mouse model [19]. It
has also reduced neuro-inflammation and cognitive decline in
mice that have been subjected to aseptic bone fracture surgery

Introduction
Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States
[1]. In response to ischemic brain injury, the resident microglia
and systemic macrophages are rapidly mobilized to the injury site
and initiate inflammatory response [2]. Studies have reported
biphasic inflammatory response after stroke [3]. Inflammation
after cerebral ischemia amplifies the initial injury by linking acute
responses in glia and cytokines to a secondary infiltration of
immune cells into the brain. Prolonged inflammation may offer a
longer window of opportunity to block secondary events that
expand brain infarction and injury [3]. Inflammation at the acute
stage of stroke has an adverse effect on stroke recovery [3–5], and
modulating inflammation has been shown to promote the healing
process and functional recovery [6–8].
Microglia/macrophages can polarize into two extreme phenotypes: pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2), producing pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines,
respectively [9–12]. Hu et al showed in a transient ischemic stroke
mouse model that microglia/macrophages respond dynamically to

[21]. However, the mechanism of a-7 nAchR neuro-protective
effect is not fully understood.
It has been reported that oxidative stress is implicated in the
pathogenesis of brain injury during ischemic or hemorrhagic
stroke. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)
oxidase-mediated oxidative stress is recognized as one of the main
mechanisms triggering pathogenic action in ischemic stroke
[22,23]. Chen et al demonstrated that mice deficient in NOX2
(one of the subunits of NADPH oxidase) decreased levels of proinflammatory mediators after ischemic stroke [24], associated with
the activity of the inflammatory transcription factor, nuclear factor
kappa B (NF-kB) [25]. It is still unclear whether activation of a-7
nAchR can modulate oxidative stress after pMCAO.
We tested the hypothesis that a-7 nAchR agonist protects brain
against ischemic injury through reduction of pro-inflammatory
macrophages (M1) and oxidative stress in a mouse ischemic stroke
model. The mouse is used because there is no computer simulation
or in vitro system can fully mimic injury response and our
understanding of mouse genetics, the availability of molecular
probes and antibodies for outcome analyses. The primary analysis
is the behavior tests. The secondary analysis includes quantification of M1 and M2 microglia and macrophages, and oxidative
stress.

Chemicals
PHA 568487 (PHA), a selective a-7 nAchR agonist, was
purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO), and methyllycaconitine (MLA), an a-7 nAchR antagonist, from Sigma (St
Louis, MO). Both were diluted with 0.9% saline prior to the
experiment, then injected intra-peritoneally as shown in Figure 1.

Permanent occlusion of distal middle cerebral artery
(pMCAO)
Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane inhalation. Buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg of body weight) was injected intraperitoneally. Under a surgical microscope, a 1-cm incision was made
between the left orbit and tragus and a 2 mm2 craniectomy was
performed. The arachnoid mater was opened, and the left middle
cerebral artery was permanently occluded using electrical coagulation just proximal to the pyriform branch. The left MCA and
its branches proximal to this point maintained blood flow, and
only the segment and branches distal to this point were blocked.
During the surgical procedure, body temperature was maintained
at 3760.5uC using a thermal blanket, and systemic blood pressure
was monitored using a tail-cuff system from Visitech Systems
(Apex). Surface cerebral blood flow (sCBF) was monitored
throughout the procedure using a laser Doppler flowmeter
(Vasamedics Inc, MN). Mice were excluded from the study if
sCBF in the ischemic core region was more than 15% of the
baseline [8]. Mice were allowed to recover from the anesthesia on
a warm blanket. Brain samples were collected 3 and 14 days after
pMCAO. A total of 6 mice had to be euthanized because of
massive bleeding during the surgery procedure.

Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
Animal experimental procedures were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the
University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and conformed to
NIH Guidelines. Animal husbandry was made available by the
staff of the Animal Core Facility, and by the staff of the IACUC of
UCSF, under the guidance of supervisors who are certified Animal
Technologists. Veterinary care was provided by IACUC faculty
members and veterinary residents located on the San Francisco
General Hospital campus.

Behavioral tests
Corner test. To detect sensorimotor and postural asymmetries, the corner test was used as previously described [26]. Mice
were placed between two boards with identical dimensions
(3062061 cm2). When mice approached the corner, both sides
of their vibrissae were stimulated. The mice reared forward and
upward, then turned back to face the open end. Normal mice
would turn to the left or right side with equal frequency, whereas

Animals
Adult wild-type male mice (C57BL/6J, 8–10 weeks of age) were
purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were
fed standard rodent food and water ad libitum, and were housed (5

stroke mice would turn more frequently to the lesion side (left side
in this study). The percentage of left turns was recorded in 3
different sets of 10 trials 1 day before pMCAO (baseline), and 3, 7
and 14 days after. Turning movements without incorporating a
rearing movement were not recorded.
Adhesive removal test. As previously described [27], the
adhesive removal test was performed to assess possible somatosensory deficits. Adhesive tape (0.360.3 cm) was applied on each
paw. The time was recorded with a maximum testing time of 120
seconds, after which the tapes were removed from each paw. Mice
were trained twice daily for 4 days before the surgery procedure in
order to obtain an optimal level of performance. The adhesive
time was recorded after 2 rounds of trials performed 1 day before
pMCAO (baseline), and 3, 7 and 14 days after.

samples were run in triplicate, and relative gene expression was
calculated using the comparative threshold cycle (CT) and
normalized to GAPDH (DCT). Results are exhibited as foldchange relative to the mean of the saline-treated group on day 3
after pMCAO.

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean 6 SD. Normality was tested with
the d’Agostino-Pearson omnibus normality test. Equalities of
variances were tested with the F test.
Sample size was determined based on our previous study [8],
wherein the time it took to remove the adhesive on the right paw
(contralateral to the brain lesion) on day 3 was used as the primary
outcome for behavior tests. We estimated that a sample of 10
C57BL/6J MCAO mice per group would be needed to
demonstrate a 20% increase (from 20 seconds to 30 seconds with
7 seconds of standard deviation), with 80% power at the 0.025
alpha level (after adjusting for three comparisons, saline vs. PHA,
saline vs. MLA) to find a significant difference. We used 11 mice
per group for behavior tests. After the final tests 14 days after
pMCAO, 7 were used for histological analysis and 4 for gene
expression analysis. An additional group of mice (11 for each
treatment) was utilized for sample collections 3 days after pMCAO
(Figure 1).
Mice are randomly assigned to experimental groups after the
baseline behavior tests performed one day before pMCAO. The
behavior tests were performed on days 3, 7 and 14 after pMCAO,
and the histological, immunostaining and RT-PCR analyses, on
days 3 and 14. We performed two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) for repeated measures to study the timing (days when
the test were performed) and the treatment (saline, MLA and
PHA) effects. The ANOVA analysis was followed by 3 (behavior)
or 2 (other tests) pairwise t-tests with Bonferroni-correction,
alpha = 0.05/2 = 0.025 after two-way ANOVA on days 3, 7 and
14 (behavior) and days 3 and 14 (other tests). Thus, P value ,
0.025 was considered statistically significant.

Evaluation of infarct and atrophy volume
Lesion volume (infarct volume 3 days and atrophy volume 14
days after pMCAO) was quantified on cresyl violet-stained
sections. Briefly, a series of 20- mm thick coronal sections, from
bregma 1.7 mm to 2.1 mm (about 8 mm3), were obtained. One in
every 10 sections was stained with cresyl violet. Images were taken
from the brain sections and digitized. Using image J, the infarct
and atrophy areas were outlined and their areas, quantified. The
infarct volumes were reconstructed by taking the sum of infarct
areas from all these sections and multiplying by 200 mm. The
atrophic area was calculated as the area of the normal area of the
ischemic hemisphere subtracted from the non-ischemic hemisphere. The atrophy volume was reconstructed using serial
sections [28].

Immunohistochemical analysis
Immunohistochemical staining was performed using a series of
20- mm-thick coronal sections. For immunofluorescent staining,
sections were incubated overnight at 4uC with the following
primary antibodies: CD68 (1:50, AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC),
NeuN (Neuronal Nuclei, 1:500, Millipore, Bedford, MA), Iba-1
(1:200, Wako, Richmond, VA), CD11b (1:200, AbD Serotec,
Raleigh, NC), CD206 (1:100, R&D, Minneapolis, MN), and
phosphor-NF-kB p65 (1:100, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). After
washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), sections were then
incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated, or Alexa Fluor 488conjugated IgG (1:500, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTPnick end-labeling
(TUNEL) assays (Apop Tag, Millipore, Bedford, MA) were used
to stain apoptotic nuclei according to the manufacture instruction.
Negative controls were performed by omitting the primary or the
secondary antibodies during the staining procedure. All sections
used for quantification were from the same anatomical region
(bregma 1.2 to 1.4 mm). The CD68, CD11b, CD206, NF-kB and
Iba-1 positive cells were separately counted using Image J software
(NIH, USA) by 3 researchers who had no knowledge of the group
assignment.

Results
PHA alleviated the sensorimotor deficit
Adhesive removal and corner tests were used to determine the
influence of PHA (a-7 nAchR agonist) on functional recovery after
ischemic injury, as these are the most reliable tests for the pMCAO
model [26,27,29]. Two-way ANOVA analysis of the right paw
removal time (contralateral to the bran lesion), using the adhesive
removal test, revealed significant effects on the timing (41.1% of
total variation, P,0.0001) and on the treatments (14.7% of total
variation, P,0.0001), with significant interaction between the two
factors (7.2% of total variation P,0.001). Bonferroni post-hoc
analyses showed that, compared to the saline group, PHA mice
took significantly less time to remove the adhesive on the right paw
on day 3 (1863 seconds [s] vs. 2364 s, p = 0.008) and day 7
(1863 s vs. 2264 s, p = 0.005) after pMCAO. Although, the PHA
group showed reduced adhesive removal time 14 days after
pMCAO, the difference between the PHA and saline groups was
not statistically significant (1862 s vs. 2163 s, p = 0.03, Figure 2A). Conversely, MLA (a-7 nAchR antagonist) mice took
longer to remove the adhesive on the right paw on days 3 (3163 s,
p,0.001) and 7 (2862 s, p,0.001), but not on day 14 (2464 s,

Real-time RT-PCR analyses
To prevent blood contamination, mice were perfused with
saline for 5 minutes to wash out blood from the cerebral
vasculature before sample collection. The cortex from bregma
1.7 mm to 22.1 mm (about 8 mm3) was rapidly collected under a
dissecting microscope, and placed in RNAlater solution (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA). Total RNA was extracted using Trizol Reagent
(Qiagen, Valencia, OH), and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using
a High Capacity RNA to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems, CA).
Real-time PCR was performed using TaqMan Fast Advanced

p = 0.03, Figure 2A). Neither treatment had an effect on adhesive
removal from the left paws (P.0.05, Figure 2B).
Two-way ANOVA analysis revealed that the timing (68.1% of
total variation P,0.0001) and the treatments (13.9% of total
variation P,0.0001) also affected the corner test results, with
significant interaction between the two factors (5.6% of total
variation, P,0.001). Bonferroni post-hoc analyses showed that
PHA mice made statistically fewer left turns on day 3 (6267% vs.
6965%, p = 0.02). However, the difference did not reach the
statistical cut-off on day 7 (6168% vs. 7069%, p = 0.03) and was
not significant by day 14 (66611% vs. 65614%, p = 0.9) after
pMCAO (Figure 2C). Conversely, as shown in figure 2C, MLA
mice made more left turns than the saline group on day 3
(81611% p = 0.0003) and day 7 (8069%, p = 0.003). The
difference did not reach the statistical cut-off on day 14
(7667%, p = 0.028).

PHA reduced lesion volume and neuronal death
To analyze neuronal injury, infarct and atrophic volume were
quantified using cresyl violet-stained brain sections collected 3
(infarct) and 14 (atrophic) days after pMCAO. PHA mice had
smaller infarct volume on day 3 (10.263.4 mm3 vs. 16.063.7
mm3, p = 0.009, Figure 3A & B) and atrophy volume on day 14
(1.660.7 mm3 vs. 2.760.5 mm3, p = 0.008, Figure 3A & C),
compared with the saline group at the corresponding time points,
whereas MLA mice had larger infarct volume on day 3 (23.362.3
mm3, p = 0.001, Figure 3A & B) and atrophic volume on day 14
(5.261.8 mm3, p = 0.008, Figure 3A & C) than the corresponding
saline groups. PHA also reduced the number of TUNEL+ neurons
in the peri-infarct region (Figure 3D) of brain sections collected 3
days after pMCAO (2662% of NeuN+ cells vs. 3262%, p = 0.001,
Figure 3E & F). MLA mice had more TUNEL+ neurons (6166%,
p,0.001, Figure 3E & F). All groups had a similar number of
TUNEL+ neurons on day 14 (PHA group: 561% vs.461%,
p = 0.80; MLA group: 562%, p = 0.37, Figure 3F).

14: 1.860.4-fold vs. 3.561.0-fold, p = 0.003, Figure 6B). Regarding M2 markers, PHA increased CD206 (2.060.7-fold vs.
0.960.2-fold, p = 0.01, Figure 6C) and IL-10 (2.560.4-fold vs.
1.060.2-fold, p,0.001, Figure 6D) expression on day 3 compared
with corresponding saline groups. However, the increased
expression of CD206 in the PHA group did not reach the
statistical cut-off 14 days after pMCAO (0.260.1-fold vs.
0.160.02-fold, p = 0.03, Figure 6C). We could not detect IL-10
expression in the samples collected 14 days after pMCAO. These
results were consistent with the histological analysis. Conversely,
the MLA group expressed higher iNOS (day 3: 1.760.4-fold,
p = 0.017; day 14: 18.164.4-fold, p = 0.004, Figure 6A) and
CD11b (day 3: 2.360.6-fold, p = 0.006; day 14: 7.361.1-fold,
p = 0.002, Figure 6B). MLA treatment did not change CD206
expression 3 and 14 days (p.0.05, Figure 6C) and IL-10
expression 3 days (P = 0.46, Figure 6D) after pMCAO.

PHA decreased M1 microglia/macrophages and M1/M2
ratio
To analyze whether PHA treatment alters microglia/macrophage polarization, we used antibodies specific to CD11b and Iba1 to identify M1, and antibodies specific to CD206 and Iba-1 to
identify M2. Compared with the saline group, PHA mice had
fewer M1 3 days (284654/mm2 vs. 437650/mm2, p,0.001) and
14 days (609694/mm2 vs. 852692/mm2, p,0.001, Figure 5A &
B) after pMCAO. The MLA group had more M1 than the saline
group 3 days (578652/mm2, p,0.001) and 14 days (12636145/
mm2, p,0.001, Figure 5A & B) after pMCAO. PHA significantly
increased the M2 cells on day 3 (381639/mm2 vs. 284623/mm2,
p,0.001, Figure 5C & D) compared with the saline group,
whereas MLA did not alter the number of M2. M2 numbers were
similar in all groups 14 days after pMCAO (PHA: 299640/mm2
vs. 335634/mm2, p = 0.12; MLA: 342666/mm2, p = 0.81,

on day 3 (0.860.3 vs. 1.660.3, p,0.001) and day 14 (2.060.8 vs.
2.661.0, p = 0.015), and higher in the MLA group on day 3
(2.060.3, p = 0.018) and day 14 (3.861.6, p = 0.009), compared
with the saline groups (Figure 5E).

PHA increased anti-oxidant gene expression and
decreased NADPH oxidase and NF-kB activity
The expression of anti-oxidant genes (superoxide dismutase 1
[SOD1] and glutathione peroxidase 1 [GPX1]), and the
expression of the two subunits of pro-oxidative stress protein
NADPH oxidase (gp91phox and p22phox) were analyzed using
RT-PCR. NF-kB activity was analyzed by quantifying phosphoNF-kB p65 positive microglia/macrophages in the peri-infarct
region. PHA increased the expression of SOD1 (day 3: 1.660.2fold vs. 1.060.2-fold, p = 0.009; day 14: 0.560.2-fold vs.
0.260.04-fold, p = 0.009, Figure 7A) and GPX1 (day 3:

vs. 0.360.1-fold, p = 0.01, Figure 6B), and decreased the expression of gp91phox (day 3: 0.460.2-fold vs. 1.060.2-fold, p = 0.002;

PHA decreased M1 and increased M2 marker gene
expression
To corroborate the histological findings, we quantified the
expression of M1 markers (iNOS and CD11b) and M2 markers
(CD206 and IL-10) using real time RT-PCR in the tissues
collected from the peri-infarct area. PHA mice expressed lower
iNOS but did not reach the Boferroni post-hoc cut-off adjusted for
multiple comparison (day 3: 0.760.1-fold vs. 1.060.1-fold,
p = 0.03; day 14: 4.161.1-fold vs. 7.061.7-fold, p = 0.03,

Discussion
In our study, we found that in mice, activation of a-7 nAchR by
PHA at the acute stage of ischemic stroke reduced brain injury and
functional deficits after pMCAO. PHA treatment also reduced the
number of CD68+, pro-inflammation M1 microglia/macrophages
(CD11b+/Iba-1+), and M1 marker genes (CD11b, iNOS) in the
peri-infarct region. As a result, the ratio of pro-inflammation M1
to anti-inflammation/pro-tissue repair M2 was reduced in the
PHA group. Further, PHA increased anti-oxidant gene expression
and decreased expression of NADPH oxidase, which is associated
with reduced expression of NF-kB activity in microglia/macrophages in the peri-infarct region. Our data therefore suggest that

a-7 nAchR Agonist Reduces Ischemic Brain Injury

reduction of pro-inflammation microglia/macrophages and oxidative stress are part of the underlying mechanisms of a-7 nAchR
neuro-protective effect.
Inflammation has biological roles in determining the outcome of
stroke. Both systemic and local inflammation in the acute phase of
ischemic stroke may have deleterious effects on stroke outcome [3–
5]. Prolonged systemic inflammation increases functional impairment after focal ischemia in rats [30]. Therefore, reducing
inflammation poses a therapeutic opportunity for improving
functional outcomes in stroke patients.
Since most of the commonly used anti-inflammatory drugs
(including non-steroidal [NSAID] and steroids) are associated with
some side effects (e.g., increasing the risk of stroke) and are not
suitable for use in stroke patients [31–33], it is necessary to explore
new strategies. Recently, the cholinergic pathway has been found
to inhibit cytokine release through a mechanism requiring
nAChRs [34]. Activation of nAChR protects against ischemic
stroke-related cerebral damage [35,36] and reduces tibial fractureinduced systemic/hippocampal inflammation [21]. Activation of
a7 nAchR has also been shown to reduce neuronal death in a
subarachnoid hemorrhage rat model [16] as well as in an
intracerebral hemorrhage mouse model [19]. We demonstrated
in this study that activation of a-7 nAchR using PHA reduces
lesion volume and apoptotic neuron, and improves functional
recovery in ischemic stroke mice. Both microglia and peripheral
macrophages express a7 nAchR [15,37]. Since we delivered PHA
via intra-peritoneal injection, we postulate that the effect we
observed in this study is mostly mediated by systemic macrophage
a-7 nAchR.
Macrophages participate in acute inflammatory response to
infection and tissue injuries, and give rise to different cell
populations that participate in host defense (M1, pro-inflammation), wound healing (M2, anti-inflammation), and immune
regulation [38]. Deletion of the macrophage lineage may cause
deleterious effects on stroke recovery. Exaggerated host defense,
such as an excessive amount of M1 macrophages in the ischemic
brain injury area at the recovery stage, may have an adverse
impact on injury repair. Thus, modulating host response by
reducing M1 and increasing M2 at the recovery stage could play a
role in a-7 nAchR neuro-protective effect. In this study, we
demonstrated that activation of a-7 nAchR using PHA at the
acute stage not only reduced CD68+ and M1 cells in the periinfact region at both the early and late stages of ischemic stroke,
but also increased M2 cells at the early stage, resulting in a
decrease in the M1/M2 macrophage ratio. With the a-7 nAchR
antagonist (MLA), however, both M1 macrophages and the M1/
M2 ratio increased, and no effect was observed in M2
macrophages.

NADPH oxidase (NOX)-mediated oxidative stress has been
shown to play a major role in pathogenic actions following
ischemic stroke [22,23] by contributing to the inflammatory
response. NOX2-deficient mice have lower levels of pro-inflammatory mediators than wild-type mice [24]. Also, the inflammatory transcription factor, NF-kB, participates in the oxide stress
process [25]; however, the connection between a-7 nAchR and
oxide stress has not been demonstrated. Our data show that
activation of a-7 nAchR reduces oxidative stress and NF-kB
activity.
The limitations of this study are: (1) The first dose of PHA was
administered immediately after pMCAO, which is almost
impossible to perform in a clinical setting. More clinically relevant
treatment schemes, such as giving the first dose between 6–
24 hours after stroke, will be tested in future studies. (2) We used
11 mice per group for behavioral analyses based on our previous
data. With this sample size, the PHA group showed better
performance at 14 days for right paw adhesive removal (P = 0.03),
and 7 days for the corner test (P = 0.03). However, the P values of
these tests at the indicated time-points did not reach the significant
cutoff point we have set (P = 0.025). (3) It was unclear why MLA
had no effect on M2 macrophage numbers. One possible
explanation is that different doses may be needed to induce
different phenotypes in various models. For example, 6 mg/kg of
MLA exacerbated the behavioral dysfunction in our model, but
did not increase behavioral dysfunction or brain edema in a mouse
model of intracerebral hemorrhage in another study [19]. A
greater dose of MLA might be needed to reduce the number of
M2 microphages.
In conclusion, our study has determined that reduction of proinflammatory M1, oxidative stress, and NF-kB activity in
microglia/macrophages contributes to the neuro-protective effect
of a-7 nAchR. Moreover, the data from this study posit a strong
case for considering a-7 nAchR activation a potential and viable
therapeutic opportunity to improve functional recovery in
ischemic stroke patients.
