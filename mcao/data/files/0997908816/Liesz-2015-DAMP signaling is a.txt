Acute brain lesions induce profound alterations of the peripheral immune response comprising the opposing phenomena of early
immune activation and subsequent immunosuppression. The mechanisms underlying this brain-immune signaling are largely unknown. We used animal models for experimental brain ischemia as a paradigm of acute brain lesions and additionally investigated a large
cohort of stroke patients. We analyzed release of HMGB1 isoforms by mass spectrometry and investigated its inflammatory potency and
signaling pathways by immunological in vivo and in vitro techniques. Features of the complex behavioral sickness behavior syndrome
were characterized by homecage behavior analysis. HMGB1 downstream signaling, particularly with RAGE, was studied in various
transgenic animal models and by pharmacological blockade. Our results indicate that the cytokine-inducing, fully reduced isoform of
HMGB1 was released from the ischemic brain in the hyperacute phase of stroke in mice and patients. Cytokines secreted in the periphery
in response to brain injury induced sickness behavior, which could be abrogated by inhibition of the HMGB1-RAGE pathway or direct
cytokine neutralization. Subsequently, HMGB1-release induced bone marrow egress and splenic proliferation of bone marrow-derived
suppressor cells, inhibiting the adaptive immune responses in vivo and vitro. Furthermore, HMGB1-RAGE signaling resulted in functional exhaustion of mature monocytes and lymphopenia, the hallmarks of immune suppression after extensive ischemia. This study
introduces the HMGB1-RAGE-mediated pathway as a key mechanism explaining the complex postischemic brain-immune interactions.

which contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality of patients. The best described component of these systemic immune
alterations is an acquired immune deficiency in the subacute
phase after ischemic stroke, which predisposes patients to infections (Meisel et al., 2005). The main features of this syndrome are
an inactivation of circulating monocytes and lymphopenia (Liesz
et al., 2009; Urra et al., 2009b). On the other hand, activation of
the peripheral immune system preceding the immunosuppressive syndrome has also been consistently described (Offner et al.,
2006a). This sterile inflammatory response includes the massive
release of proinflammatory cytokines from systemic innate immune cells within hours after the brain lesion (An et al., 2014).
Yet, the pathophysiological impact of this early immune activation as well as its mediators are unknown.
In view of the extensive impact of the perturbed peripheral
immune system on the damaged brain as well as on systemic
infectious complications, the identification of the signaling pathways underlying systemic immune modulation is of great translational relevance. Previous reports have suggested a role of the
autonomic nervous system in mediating subacute immunosuppression after acute brain injuries because elevated catechol-

amine levels were observed in some of the previous experimental
stroke studies. Blocking of adrenoreceptors reversed aspects of
poststroke immunodepression, including susceptibility to bacterial infections in experimental stroke (Prass et al., 2003; Meisel
et al., 2005). However, recent clinical (Liesz et al., 2013a) as
well experimental (Mracsko et al., 2014) studies have yielded
mixed results regarding the implications of catecholamines in
immunodepression.
Therefore, we focused in this study on soluble mediators released from the necrotic brain tissue as an alternative pathway in
poststroke brain-immune interaction. Previous studies suggested
a strong correlation between the volume of damaged brain tissue
and the extent of systemic immune alterations, regardless of infarct location (Gendron et al., 2002; Hug et al., 2009). Accordingly, we speculated that soluble mediators would be released
from dying neurons in proportion to the extent of necrotic tissue.
As a prototypic alarmin, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a
nuclear protein, which is released from necrotic cells with high
inflammatory potency (Lotze and Tracey, 2005). As such,
HMGB1 can act itself as a cytokine or amplify the binding of
cytokines and nucleosomes to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Bianchi, 2009). The receptor of advanced glycation end-products
(RAGE) has been identified as a key receptor (in addition toTLR2
and TLR4) for HMGB1, mediating activation pathways to a variety of cell types in an organ-specific manner (Lotze and Tracey,
2005).
Our study introduces the signaling of brain-released alarmins,
such as HMGB1, through RAGE as an important link between
acute brain injury and systemic immune alterations. We demonstrate a biphasic scenario where this signaling cascade initially
activates peripheral monocytes and dendritic cells, resulting in a
massive release of proinflammatory cytokines. Subsequently, initial (over)activation of the peripheral immune system results in
exhaustion of monocytes and recruitment of immature monocytes. Suppressive signaling by the altered monocyte population
leads to apoptosis of lymphocytes, the hallmark of poststroke
immunosuppression.

Materials and Methods
Animals. The study was conducted in accordance with national guidelines for the use of experimental animals, and the protocols were approved by the governmental committee (Regierungspraesidium
Karlsruhe, Germany). Animal experiments were designed, performed,
and data reported according to the ARRIVE guidelines (Kilkenny et al.,
2010). We used age-matched, male mice (C57BL/6J, 10 –12 weeks, 23–25
g body weight, Charles River Laboratories). RAGE ⫺/⫺ (Liliensiek et al.,
2004) and MyD88 ⫺/⫺ (Adachi et al., 1998) mice were bred in the core
animal facility of the University of Heidelberg under specified pathogenfree conditions.
Patient recruitment and blood sampling. Blood samples used for analysis in this study were collected during a previous study (Liesz et al.,
2013a) conducted between October 2011 until November 2012. In brief,
inclusion criteria were study enrollment within 24 h after symptom onset. Exclusion criteria were recent clinical infection (fever, cough, antibiotic treatment, laboratory markers) within 14 d before admission, a
chronic immunological disorder, preexisting immunosuppression, cancer, and pregnancy. Blood samples from 104 patients obtained within
24 h after symptom onset were analyzed. Patient characteristics are depicted in Tables 1 and 2. Stroke patients received routine cranial imaging
by CT (Somatom Sensation 16) and/or 3T MRI (Trio and/or Verio; all
Siemens Medical Systems) to detect ischemic brain lesions. Volume was
calculated by integrating areas on each image multiplied by section diameter using a Syngo Multimodality workplace with syngoMMWPsoftware (version VE31A, Siemens). For the control group, patients were
included that presented at the Department of Ophthalmology for pre-

surgical screening for cataract operation. Patients were selected to be in
the same range for age and gender of patients with cerebrovascular disorders. All procedures were performed after written informed consent
was obtained by the patient or a legal representative.
Animal experiments. Animals received intraperitoneal injection of 100
␮g monoclonal anti-HMGB1 antibodies (clone 2g7) (Qin et al., 2006) 30
min before ischemia induction or an isotype control antibody (BioXCell); 100 ␮g soluble RAGE (full-length recombinant human sRAGE)
was injected before middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) induction
and 4 h after MCAO. The ␤2-adrenoreceptor inhibitor ICI 118,551
(Sigma) was administered intraperitoneally at 4 mg/kg body weight before MCAO and at 4, 8, and 12 h after MCAO (Mracsko et al., 2014).
Neutralization of circulating cytokines was achieved by intraperitoneal
injection of 200 ␮g each of anti-IL-1beta, anti-TNF-␣, or anti-IL-6 antibodies (all from eBioscience, functional grade purified) in a total volume
of 200 ␮l PBS intraperitoneally. Control mice received 300 ␮g of isotype
control antibody. Organ sampling (brain, spleen, thymus, bone marrow,
blood from retro-orbital sinus) for further analysis was performed in
anesthesia with ketamin/xylazine. Rectal temperature and body weight
were measured daily. Neurological deficits were assessed by a modified
“Bederson score” (Bederson et al., 1986): 0, no deficit; 1, forelimb flexion;

using the Rotarod test as previously described (Jones and Roberts, 1968;
Liesz et al., 2013b). Briefly, mice were trained at first at constant 4 rpm,
then three times at acceleration from 4 to 40 rpm in 210 s. Baseline
assessment was performed as for training with acceleration and the mean
calculated from three runs with a 10 min break in between. Time was

stopped if the mouse fell off the beam or passively rotated twice on the
beam. Assessment 24 h after MCAO was performed similar to baseline
measurement.

Experimental stroke models
Coagulation model. We used this stroke model for experiments shown in
Figure 1A, B. Mice were anesthetized with 1.0%–2.0% halothane in O2/

586 • J. Neurosci., January 14, 2015 • 35(2):583–598

N2O. After making a 1 cm skin incision between the left eye and ear, we
drilled a burr hole through the temporal skull. We removed the dura
mater and occluded the MCA permanently using a bipolar electrocoagulation forceps (ERBOTOM, Erbe). During the operation, body temperature was kept at 37°C using a feedback controlled heating pad. We
sutured the skin lesion and placed the mouse in a cage under an infrared
heating lamp until recovery from anesthesia. Sham treatment was given
according to the same surgical protocol as for MCAO but without coagulation of the MCA. The overall mortality in the coagulation model was
⬍5% for the 3 d observation period.
Filament model. We used this model for all remaining experiments.
Mice were anesthetized with 1.0%–2.0% halothane in O2/N2O-enriched
air. We placed the laser Doppler probe over the cortical area supplied by
the MCA. Baseline CBF was measured as relative perfusion units and
defined as 100% flow. After neck dissection, we made an incision into the
left external carotid artery between two ligations and advanced a siliconcovered 8-0 nylon monofilament through the internal carotid artery to
occlude the MCA. MCA occlusion was documented as a decrease in
relative perfusion values by laser Doppler to ⬍20% of original flow, a less
pronounced decrease in CBF was used as an exclusion criterion. We fixed
the filament in this position by ligation, closed the neck, removed the
Doppler probe, and placed the mouse in its cage. Then, 30 min (only for
experiments in Fig. 1 A, B) or 90 min, respectively, after filament insertion, the mouse was anesthetized again and the filament removed. After
we closed the surgical wound, the mice were transferred to their cages
with free access to water and food. During the operations body temperature was kept at 37°C with a feedback-controlled heating pad. We maintained normal body temperature of the mice between operations and
until recovery after the procedure by an infrared heating lamp. Sham
operation was performed in exactly the same manner as described above,
including repeated anesthesia 30 or 90 min after sham surgery, except
that the filament was only introduced briefly into the external carotid
artery. The overall mortality in the 30 min occlusion model was ⬍5% for
the 3 d observation period; mortality for the 90 min occlusion model is
reported in Figure 1H.
Assessment of infarct volume. We anesthetized the mice and perfused
them transcardially with 20 ml normal saline. We removed the brains
from the skull and froze them immediately in isopentane (⫺20°C). We
cut 20-␮m-thick coronal cryosections every 400 ␮m, stained the sections
using a standard cresyl-violet staining protocol, scanned them at 600 dpi,
and analyzed the infarct area on each section (ImageJ). The Swanson
method was applied to indirectly measure the infarct area and to
correct for cortical swelling (Swanson et al., 1990). The total infarct
volume was determined by integrating measured areas and distances
between sections.
Analysis of HMGB1 by electrospray ionization liquid chromatography
mass spectrometry. All chemicals and solvents were of the highest available grade (Sigma). Samples were precleared with 50 ␮l protein
G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4°C. Supernatant HMGB1 was immunoprecipitated with 5 ␮g rabbit anti-HMGB1 (Abcam; ab18256) for 16 h at
4°C as previously described (Antoine et al., 2009). Free thiol groups
within HMGB1 were alkylated for 90 min with 10 mM iodoacetamide at
4°C. Cysteine residues in disulfide bonds were then reduced with 30 mM
DTT at 4°C for 1 h followed by alkylation of newly exposed thiol groups
with 90 mM NEM at 4°C for 10 min. Samples were subjected to trypsin
(Promega) or GluC (New England Biolabs) digestion according to manufacturer’s instructions and desalted using ZipTip C18 pipette tips (Millipore). Characterization of whole protein molecular weights, acetylated
lysine residues, or redox modifications on cysteine residues within
HMGB1 were determined as described previously by whole protein electrospray ionization or tandem mass spectrometry (Antoine et al., 2012;
Nyström et al., 2013) using either an AB Sciex QTRAP 5500 or an AB
Sciex TripleTOF 5600 (Sciex Inc.). Peptide analysis was determined using
an AB Sciex QTRAP 5500 equipped with a NanoSpray II source by in-line
liquid chromatography using a U3000 HPLC System (Dionex), connected to a 180 ␮m ⫻ 20 mm nanoAcquity UPLC C18 trap column and
a 75 ␮m ⫻ 15 cm nanoAcquity UPLC BEH130 C18 column via reducing
unions. A gradient from 0.05% TFA (v/v) to 50% ACN/0.08% TFA (v/v)
in 40 min was applied at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. The ionspray potential

was set to 2200 –3500 V, the nebulizer gas to 19, and the interface heater
to 150°C.
ELISA. Human and mouse serum and cell culture supernatants were
collected and immediately frozen at ⫺80°C until analysis. Commercial
ELISA kits were used for the quantitative analysis of HMGB1 (IBL) and
cytokine expression of IL-1␤, TNF-␣, IL-6, and IL-12p40 (all R&D
Systems).
Homecage behavior analysis. Mice were held individually in 37 ⫻ 16 ⫻
13 cm transparent plastic cages as homecages. Mice were recorded for
17–24 h for each day/night/d cycle before MCAO and at day 1 and/or day
3 after MCAO using CCD cameras and an infrared illumination system
during the dark cycle. The camera angle was set up for recording of the
long side of cages to observe horizontal as well as vertical activities, such
as rearing and hanging. Ethovision (EthovisionXT, version 4.1, by Noldus Information Technologies) video tracking software was used to digitize the trials at a rate of 12.5 frames/s. Total distance moved, rearing
time, and rearing frequency were determined using animal center point
analysis according to areas indicated in Figure 2F.
Bacterial culture. For bacterial blood cultures, 30 ␮l blood was drawn
from each mouse and diluted in 270 ␮l sterile PBS. For bacterial lung
cultures, both lung lobes were homogenized in PBS in a total volume of
300 ␮l; 50 ␮l of each blood sample or 100 ␮l of each lung homogenate
was plated on Columbia agar with 5% sheep blood (BD Biosciences).
Plates were incubated at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2 and colony
forming units were evaluated after 24 h.
Determination of bacterial DNA in lung homogenates by quantitative
PCR. Bacterial load in lung homogenates was determined applying a
quantitative real-time PCR that amplifies 16S ribosomal DNA. Both lung
lobes were homogenized, and DNA was extracted using the QIAmpDNA
Mini kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with an
eluate volume of 100 ␮l. Samples were amplified with primers targeting
conserved regions within the 16S rRNA gene (forward, 5⬘-TGG AGC
ATG TGG TTT AAT TCG A-3⬘; reverse, 5⬘-TGC GGG ACT TAA CCC
AAC A-3⬘). A defined plasmid standard (16S rRNA amplicon from Escherichia coli, cloned in pCR2.1, Invitrogen; plasmids quantified by spectrophotometry) was used as positive control for qPCR. Samples were
assayed in triplicate in a 25 ␮l reaction mixture containing 2 ␮l of template DNA, 12.5 ␮l of 2⫻ Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 12.5 pmol of forward primer and reverse primer (MWG).
Cycling conditions were as follows: 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40
cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min each. For quantification,
background levels of the nontemplate control were subtracted from
the specific samples.
Western blotting. Proteins were isolated for HMGB1 and ARG1 Western blotting from samples using ice-cold RIPA buffer as previously reported (Liesz et al., 2013b). Lysates were electrophoresed, transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked with skim milk. Blocked membranes were probed with rabbit anti-HMGB1 (1:1000) or incubated with
sheep anti-ARG1 (1:500; R&D Systems) in TBS-T plus 5% milk overnight at 4°C Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and donkey antisheep secondary antibodies were used, respectively, and blots developed
by standard chemiluminescence protocols.
Stress mediator analysis. Serum cortisol and metanephrine/normetanephrine concentrations were measured in the central laboratory of the
University Hospital Heidelberg by the same procedures used and validated for routine diagnostic analysis. Cortisol concentrations were measured by chemiluminescence immunoassays, and serum metanephrine/
normetanephrine were detected by ELISA.
Magnetic cell sorting. MACS sorting using magnetic beads was used for
isolation of CD11b-, CD11c-, and CD3-positive cells for in vitro studies.
Single-cell suspensions were prepared from spleens of the respective naive donor animals or after experimental brain ischemia as indicated in
the manuscript. Single-cell suspensions were then processed for further
purification of the subpopulation according to the manufacturer’s protocol using commercial MACS kits (Miltenyi Biotec) for the purification
of the indicated population (total T cells, monocytes, dendritic cells,
myeloid-derived suppressor cells).
Real-time PCR. RNA was isolated from spleens or isolated cells using
the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN). Reverse transcription was performed with the

HMGB1 is released from necrotic brain lesions
We analyzed HMGB1 serum concentrations by ELISA in different experimental stroke models varying by location and volume
of the resulting infarct (Fig. 1A) and detected a significant increase only after large infarcts at early time points after stroke
(Fig. 1B). This was verified by HMGB1 Western blotting at 2 h
after stroke onset (Fig. 1C). We also found massively increased
HMGB1 serum concentrations in stroke patients within the first
hours after symptom onset (Fig. 1D). To verify HMGB1 release in
human stroke, we further evaluated HMGB1 concentrations in
blood samples from 104 patients (patient characteristics summarized in Table 1) within 24 h after symptom onset of small or large
lesions (dichotomized by the median infarct volume, in this cohort 30 ml) and compared it with control patients (Fig. 1E).
Because human and murine results showed a consistent pattern
of early HMGB1 release into the circulation after extensive ischemic brain lesions, further experimental studies were performed
exclusively in the 90 min transient MCAO model.
We analyzed the impact of blocking HMGB1 by neutralizing
antibodies or by elimination of its receptor RAGE in knock-out
mice on stroke outcome. Infarct volumes (Fig. 1F ) and basic
sensory-motor deficits measured by the Bederson score (Fig. 1G)
did not differ significantly among anti-HMGB1 treated animals,
RAGE ⫺/⫺ mice, and controls in our experiments. Intriguingly,
despite the lack of effect on infarct size and neurological deficit,
7 d mortality was substantially reduced in RAGE ⫺/⫺ mice ( p ⫽
0.008, n ⫽ 22) and tended also to be lower in anti-HMGB1treated mice ( p ⫽ 0.07, n ⫽ 17) (Fig. 1H ). Both HMGB1 neutralization and RAGE deficiency also attenuated loss of body
weight and hypothermia after stroke (Fig. 1I ). This dissociation
between similar lesion size and differing mortality might indicate
that HMGB1-RAGE blockade modified important systemic consequences of brain infarction rather than resulting in immediate
structural neuroprotection.

T-cell stimulation assay. For intracellular cytokine staining of isolated T
cells, we plated single-cell suspensions of 300,000 mononuclear cells
on 96-well plates (RPMI-1640, ⫹ 10% FCS, ⫹ glutamine, ⫹HEPES, ⫹
penicillin/streptomycin, ⫹ mercaptoethanol). Each sample was processed in triplicate. We primed the cells for 48 h with plate-bound antimouse CD3e (clone 145-2C11, BD Biosciences) and 2 ␮g/ml soluble
anti-mouse CD28 (clone 37, clone 51, BD Biosciences), followed by restimulation with 500 ng calcimycin (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 ng/ml PMA
(Sigma-Aldrich), and protein transport inhibitor (BD GolgiPlug, BD
Biosciences) for 5 h.
Dendritic cell stimulation assay. CD11c ⫹ splenic dendritic cells were
isolated by MACS following the manufacturer’s protocol (Miltenyi
Biotec). CD11c ⫹ cells were cultured at a concentration of 100,000 cells/
well for 24 h. Fully phosphorothioate modified CpG-ODN 1668 (TIB
Molbiol) was used at a concentration of 100 nM by adding the stimulus
directly into the culture medium.
Marrow-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) suppression assay. CD11b ⫹Ly6Chigh ⫹ cells were isolated by MACS and cocultered with CD3 ⫹ T cells
(MACS-isolated) at the indicated ratio with a total cell count of 200,000
cells per well of a 96-well round-bottom plate. T cells were labeled with
CFSE (CFSE cell proliferation kit, Invitrogen), and their proliferation
was stimulated by plate-bound anti-CD3␧ (10 ␮g/ml) and addition of
concavalin A at 2 ␮g/ml for a culture time of 42 h. Suppression of T-cell
proliferation was assessed by measuring the CFSE dilutions and analyzed
using Flowjo 4.2 software (TreeStar).
HMGB1 stimulation assay. For assessment of the cytokine-inducing
activity of HMGB1, mixed splenocyte cultures (Fig. 2D) or cocultures of
T cells with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (Fig. 2E) were used.
Erythrocyte-depleted primary cell suspensions of spleens from naive animals were used for mixed splenocyte cultures. For cocultures, T cells
were isolated by MACS (T cell isolation kit I, Miltenyi) and APCs were
isolated using the same kit. APCs were either irradiated or received sham
treatment (placement in chamber with no irradiation). Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium, “Cytokine HMGB1”(C23-C45 disulfide
bond, purchased from HMGBiotech) was added to the culture medium
at the indicated concentrations.
Flow cytometry. We collected organs (spleen, blood, mesenteric lymph
nodes, and bone marrow) after transcardial perfusion with saline at various time points after MCAO for flow cytometric analysis. We stained
single-cell suspensions for anti-mouse CD3 (clone 17A2), CD4 (clone
RM 4 –5), CD8 (clone 53– 6.7), B220 (clone RA3– 6B2), NK1.1 (clone
PK136), Ly-6C (clone HK1.4), Ly-6G (Gr-1; clone RB6 – 8C5), CD80
(clone 16 –10A1), CD86 (clone GL1), CD25 (clone PC61), CD69 (clone
H1.2F3), CD11b (clone M1/70), MHC-II (M5/114.15.2), and CD11c
(clone N418). Expression of IFN-␥ (clone XMG1.2) and IL-4 (clone
11B11) was intracellularly detected after stimulation of T cells by the
above published stimulation protocol.
Blood samples from stroke patients for FACS analysis were collected in
EDTA tubes and immediately processed. Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and single-cell suspensions stained
for anti-human CD11b (clone ICRF44), CD33 (clone P67.6), and
HLA-DR (clone L243). We performed flow cytometry on a Becton Dickinson FACS Calibur and analyzed the data by CellQuest Pro software.
Statistical analysis. Sample size of the experiments was determined by a
priori calculation presuming Type I error of 0.05, power of 0.8, and
specific variance based on according preexperiments using g* power statistical software. All values in bar graphs are expressed as mean ⫾ SD. We
analyzed infarct volumes and functional outcome tests by two-tailed
Student’s t test after validating the normal distribution of these datasets

HMGB1 matures in the circulation to its cytokineinducing isoform
Because the biological activity of HMGB1 is critically dependent
on the redox state of cysteine residues at C23, C45, and C106
(Yang et al., 2013), we analyzed post-translational HMGB1 modifications by tandem mass spectrometry (Fig. 2 A, B). At 2 h after
ischemia, the fully reduced isoforms with no cytokine-inducing
but chemoattractant activity predominated in brain and serum
samples as the disulphide form was not detected in any of the
investigated brains and only in two often serum samples. Moreover, the exclusively hypoacetylated state confirmed the passive
release of HMGB1 from necrotic cells (Fig. 2C, summary). In
contrast, the cytokine-inducing C34-C45 disulphide HMGB1
isoform (Yang et al., 2010) was found as the prevalent isoform in
serum samples at 24 h but could still not be detected in brain
samples of the corresponding animals (Fig. 2D). These results
indicate HMGB1 maturation in the blood circulation toward its
cytokine-stimulating isoform after initial (passive) release from
the necrotic brain tissue.

unstimulated samples (control). Bars represent p ⬍ 0.05 between indicated groups. Each data point represents one individual experiment. D, Naive CD3 ⫹ T cells were cocultured with untreated
(vital) or irradiated APCs and stimulated with HMGB1 at the indicated concentration for 24 h. Interferon-␥ concentrations were measured in the supernatant by ELISA (data representative of 5
individual experiments). Vital APCs are required for stimulation of IFN-␥ production by T cells.

The early phase after brain injury is characterized by massive
systemic cytokine secretion mediating sickness behavior
To determine the contribution of HMGB1 signaling on sterile
systemic inflammation, cytokine concentrations were determined within the acute phase after brain ischemia. Expression
levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1␤, TNF-␣, and IL-6
were markedly increased in the acute phase after stroke onset
(Fig. 3A). Antibody-mediated neutralization of HMGB1 significantly attenuated splenic expression and serum concentrations of
these proinflammatory cytokines (Fig. 3 A, B). Supporting the
immune-stimulatory role of HMGB1, in vitro stimulation of
splenocyte cultures with the cytokine-stimulating isoform of
HMGB1 resulted in increased expression of T cell- (IFN-␥) and
monocyte- (IL-12) derived cytokine secretion (Fig. 3C). Moreover, we detected a dose–response relation for HMGB1 concentration and IFN-␥ secretion by isolated T cells, which depended
on the presence of viable APCs (Fig. 3D).
Weight loss and hypothermia, as shown in Figure 1I, are considered as basal markers of sickness in models of immunemediated diseases (Dantzer, 2006). We further investigated this
phenomenon in a homecage behavior analysis setup, which enabled the automated analysis of circadian rhythm and complex
mouse behavior (Jhuang et al., 2010; Spulber et al., 2012) (Fig.
4A). Although no behavioral difference was detected between
RAGE ⫺/⫺ animals and WT controls at baseline before MCAO (data
not shown), we detected a disturbance in circadian rhythm at day 1
after stroke. This was more pronounced in WT compared with
RAGE ⫺/⫺ animals with respect to arousal after the start of the day
cycle (6 A.M.) and disparity between overall night and day activity
(Fig. 4B). Furthermore, mobility and exploratory behavior (total
distance moved), targeted movements to reach the water bottle

(rearing time and frequency), and challenging physical activities
(hanging time) were significantly less affected during the early phase
after stroke induction in RAGE ⫺/⫺ compared with WT mice (Fig. 4C).
To investigate the role of the peripheral cytokine release in the
acute phase after brain injury as the potential link between RAGE
deficiency and improved behavior, we antagonized IL-1␤,
TNF-␣, and IL-6 by neutralizing antibodies and analyzed key
features of sickness behavior as introduced above. Infarct volumetry
revealed similar infarct volumes in control- and anti-cytokine–
treated mice (Fig. 4D). Additionally, focal sensorimotor dysfunction
analyzed by the Rotarod test did not differ between the treatment
groups (Fig. 4E). This demonstrated that peripheral cytokine neutralization had no immediate impact on the primary brain lesion. In
contrast, homecage behavior analysis revealed a similar treatment
effect of cytokine antagonization as previously seen in RAGEdeficient mice. The cytokine neutralization improved the strokeinduced disturbances in circadian rhythm with reduced variation
between light and dark periods (Fig. 4F). It also improved overall
motility as depicted by analysis of total distanced moved in the first
2 h of the light period (6 A.M. to 8 A.M.) (Fig. 4G).
RAGE signaling promotes MDSC expansion
Based on the finding that APC viability is critical for the impact of
HMGB1 on lymphocyte function (Fig. 3D), we further analyzed
the role of monocytes in this model. We found an expansion of a
specific immature monocyte subpopulation in the spleen, characterized by the CD11b ⫹Ly-6C ⫹MHC-IIlow expression pattern
after stroke (Fig. 5A), which was abrogated by anti-HMGB1
treatment (Fig. 5B). Further analysis of this population in spleen
and bone marrow revealed both increased splenic proliferation
(marker Ki-67) and a reduced proportion of this subpopulation

in the bone marrow (Fig. 5B). These findings are compatible with
a combination of local splenic proliferation as well as bone marrow egress of immature monocytes. Moreover, stroke in WT
mice resulted in an increase in CD80 expression and a reduction
of MHC-II expression on monocytes (Fig. 5C). The strokeinduced rise of immature splenic monocytes compared with

sham-operated mice was significantly reduced in RAGE ⫺/⫺ animals 3 d after MCAO, supporting the role of HMGB1-RAGE
signaling on immature monocyte recruitment (Fig. 5D).
To assess functional capabilities of splenic monocytes after
stroke that were independent of the RAGE signaling pathway, we
performed stimulation assays with the TLR9-ligand CpG-ODN.

This revealed substantially reduced IL-12 and TNF-␣ secretion
by monocytes 3 d after brain ischemia consistent with a reduced
responsiveness of splenic monocytes resulting from functional
exhaustion. In vivo anti-HMGB1 treatment partially attenuated
monocytic hyporesponsiveness to in vitro stimulation as
shown by increased IL-12 secretion in the anti-HMGB1treated group compared with control mice, although it had no
effect on TNF-␣ production (Fig. 5E). Next, we analyzed the
frequency of immature monocytes, delineated by expression
of CD11b ⫹CD33 ⫹HLA ⫺, in stroke patients with extensive brain
lesions (⬎100 ml lesion volume) and matched control patients
without neurological disease (Fig. 5F; Table 2). We detected a
significant expansion of immature monocytes also after human
stroke (Fig. 5G). We further analyzed the functional properties of
the expanded CD11b ⫹Ly-6C ⫹ monocyte population to stimulate or inhibit T cells. Splenic CD11b ⫹ monocytes isolated 3 d
after stroke used as APCs in coculture with CD3 ⫹ T cells had a
suppressive effect on T-cell proliferation (Fig. 5 H, I ). Additionally, arginase-1 (Arg1) expression, a marker of myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (Rodríguez and Ochoa, 2008; Gabrilovich and
Nagaraj, 2009), was massively increased in poststroke splenic
monocytes, which was prevented by in vivo pretreatment with
anti-HMGB1 (Fig. 5J ).

HMGB1 treatment, reduced splenic lymphocyte apoptosis after
brain ischemia (Fig. 6 A, B). Similarly, the stroke-induced reduction of circulating blood T cells was prevented in RAGE-deficient
mice (Fig. 6C). The postischemic effect on B-cell and granulocyte
counts, however, was not influenced by either anti-HMGB1
treatment or by RAGE- or MyD88 deficiency, respectively (data
not shown). Furthermore, we observed a relative increase of activated T cells (activation markers CD25 and CD69) in RAGE ⫺/⫺
mice compared with WT mice after stroke (Fig. 6D). Because of
the incomplete antagonization of the immunosuppressive phenotype by RAGE deficiency, we further investigated the impact of
TLR-mediated pathways in stroke-induced immune disturbances using MyD88 ⫺/⫺ mice. We detected a similar pattern for
T-cell counts in spleen and blood as for RAGE ⫺/⫺ mice after
stroke with partial abrogation of lymphopenia in MyD88 ⫺/⫺
mice without further augmentation by anti-HMGB1 treatment
(Fig. 6E). In summary, these results indicate that the immunosuppressive and lymphotoxic effects of extensive brain ischemia
are mediated at least in part by HMGB1 via the RAGE and the
TLR-MyD88 pathways.
HMGB1-RAGE signaling is a distinct alternative signaling
pathway after acute brain injury
To control for potential confounding factors known for the used
stroke model of large brain lesion, we performed additional analyses to investigate alternative explanations for the observed effects independent of the HMGB1-RAGE pathway. Previous
reports have demonstrated bacterial infections in this model,
which could have interfered with the immunological and behavioral readout parameters investigated in this study. However, we
did not detect bacteria in lung homogenates or blood of any mice
(Fig. 7A). Furthermore, catecholamines released by activation of
the sympathetic autonomous nervous system have been reported
as mediators of poststroke immunosuppression (Prass et al.,
2003; Meisel et al., 2005). Therefore, we measured serum concentrations of glucocorticoid and catecholamine stress mediators in
WT control mice, anti-HMGB1 treated, and RAGE-deficient
mice after stroke without detecting significant differences among
groups (Fig. 7B). Next, we aimed to analyze the functional role of
catecholamine signaling on critical parameters affected by the
HMGB1-RAGE pathway in the previous experiments, such as
cytokine release, spleen cellularity, and MDSC expansion. Therefore, we treated mice either with the ␤2-adrenoreceptor blocker
(b2-INH) ICI 118,551 (Mracsko et al., 2014), sRAGE. or the combination of both. We observed that the inhibition of the RAGE
pathway by sRAGE-treatment, but not blockade of the adrenergic b2 receptor by b2-INH, abrogated the increased systemic
IL-6 secretion after brain ischemia (Fig. 7C). Both sRAGE
treatment and b2-INH injection prevented the expansion of
the CD11b ⫹Ly-6C ⫹ monocyte fraction (compare withFig. 5B).
However, b2-INH injection also caused a significant reduction in
this cell population compared with control-treated mice (Fig.
7D). On the other hand, the marked reduction of spleen cellularity (Fig. 7E) was not affected by b2-INH but significantly abrogated by sRAGE treatment. Interestingly, the combination of the
RAGE as well as the catecholamine signaling had an additive
effect on this parameter. These results indicate that the HMGB1RAGE and the stress-mediator pathways might be largely independent but differentially involved in specific signaling cascades,
such as acute cytokine release and immunosuppressive pathways.

Discussion
This study presents data supporting a novel concept of brainimmune interaction after acute brain lesions in which soluble
danger signals from the brain mediate a complex immunomodulatory reaction in the peripheral immune system. Previous studies have focused on the role of HMGB1 and other DAMPs on
immediate tissue injury within a defined organ, such as the heart

and the brain (Andrassy et al., 2008; Muhammad et al., 2008;
Shichita et al., 2012). This is the first study uncovering suprasystemic cross signaling via RAGE largely by cytokine-inducing isoforms of the soluble mediator HMGB1 released from the necrotic
brain. Our findings provide new insights into the peripheral immune alterations in response to brain injury and propose brainreleased alarmins as important mediators of the systemic

immune response leading to complex behavioral and metabolic
sequelae.
Our results are of clinical relevance for patients presenting
with severe acute brain injury because their prognosis is strongly
influenced by secondary immune-mediated complications. In
the early phase after clinical stroke and traumatic brain injury
features of sickness behavior, including sleep disorders, fatigue,
and depression, are common (Dantzer, 2006; Crosby et al., 2012),
which affect secondary morbidity and physical recovery (Willey
et al., 2010; Lerdal and Gay, 2013). The concept of proinflammatory cytokines as the cause of clinical sickness behavior and peripheral inflammation is well established, and IL-1␤, IL-6, and
TNF-␣ are seen as the main mediators (Dantzer et al., 2008).
These cytokines are also strongly upregulated in the periphery
during the acute phase after brain ischemia as shown in the present and previous reports (Offner et al., 2006a; Chamorro et al.,
2012), but the underlying signaling and the resulting pathophysiological implications were unknown. In this study, we identified
the HMGB1-RAGE signaling pathway as the critical route inducing this overshooting immune reaction after brain injury. Inhibiting this signaling pathway improved the systemic metabolic and
behavioral consequences of stroke and reduced mortality but did
not affect the size of the brain lesions. Similarly, direct neutralization of the overshooting cytokine-release in the acute phase
after MCAO improved similar behavioral parameters, such as

circadian rhythm and mobility as for inhibition of the HMGB1RAGE pathway, supporting the concept of HMGB1-RAGE
mediated cytokine-induced behavioral alterations. Because
cytokine-induced sickness behavior is still not well established as
a distinct syndrome in the clinical setting and also requires more
comprehensive characterization in experimental models, future
studies will have to further validate this concept. Additionally, we
cannot exclude immediate modulatory effects of HMGB1-RAGE
signaling on brain structures that are not primarily affected by the
brain ischemia (e.g., hippocampus). Also, stress mediators,
which are released after acute brain injury, might have a currently
unknown direct impact on poststroke behavior mimicking
cytokine-induced sickness behavior (see below).
Immunosuppression predisposes patients to bacterial infections, which contribute substantially to poststroke morbidity
(Katzan et al., 2003). Based mainly on an experimental landmark
study using the ␤ blocker propranolol (Prass et al., 2003), catecholamines have been suggested as the key mediators of poststroke immune suppression and infectious complications
(Dirnagl et al., 2007; Iadecola and Anrather, 2011). Furthermore,
a previous study reported the modulation of hepatic iNKT cells

B, Differential effects of HMGB1 in the spleen (left) and bone marrow (right) in the acute phase (⬍24 h) after stroke. Splenic monocytes are activated via a RAGE-dependent pathway, producing increased
amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. In the bone marrow, HMGB1 induces proliferation of immature monocytes and their release to the circulation. C, The expanded population of (bone marrow-derived)
immature monocytes has features of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which inhibit lymphocyte activation via arginase (ARG1) secretion and might induce lymphocyte apoptosis. Splenic and circulating APCs have an
“exhausted” phenotype characterized by reduced MHC-II expression and decreased cytokine production upon stimulation. Inadequate costimualtory signaling to lymphocyte induces T-cell dysfunction and might lead to
apoptosis.Additionally,increasedcatecholaminelevelsinthesubacutephaseafterstrokeresultinimpairedmonocytefunctionandlymphocytereductionprobablyindependentofHMGB1-RAGEsignaling.

in vitro fails to prevent lymphocytopenia, the hallmark of immunodepression (Mracsko et al., 2014). Although increased catecholamine blood levels have been reported after experimental
and clinical stroke (Chamorro et al., 2007; Urra et al., 2009b),

their correlation with lymphopenia, humoral immunosuppression or bacterial infections was not confirmed in a recent study in
stroke patients (Liesz et al., 2013a). Moreover, the catecholaminergic concept of poststroke immune depression suggests the in-

volvement of structures of the autonomic nervous system (e.g.,
the insula) and a laterality of the observed effect (right vs left
hemisphere). However, the evidence from clinical and experimental studies rather points to lesion size instead of lesion location as the primary determinator of immune depression
(Gendron et al., 2002; Hug et al., 2009; Liesz et al., 2013a). Therefore, the link between acute ischemic brain injury and the impact
on the peripheral immune system remained to be identified. Genetic or pharmacological blockage of pattern recognition receptor signaling via HMGB1 and RAGE in this study abrogated
cellular immunosuppression and also restored the activation of
lymphocytes in the subacute phase after stroke. We have performed experiments comparing the differential effects of inhibiting the RAGE signaling cascade and beta2-adrenergic signaling
on key outcome parameters of the acute immunostimulatory
phase (cytokine release) and the subsequent immunosuppressive state in the subacute phase (spleen cellularity and MDSC
expansion). Our findings suggest that alarmin-mediated pathways and the poststroke stress-related catecholaminergic effects are largely independent. While brain-released alarmins
are released early after brain injury and might cause peripheral
immune activation and subsequent immune exhaustion, catecholamines might represent an additional signaling pathway
in the subacute phase compromising poststroke immune
function (Fig. 8).
The concept of “stroke-induced immunodepression” (Meisel
et al., 2005; Dirnagl et al., 2007) has been perceived as an independent and isolated immunological phenomenon after acute
brain injury. However, our results suggest that this immunosuppressive state in the subacute phase after stroke has to be
integrated as only one feature of the complex systemic immunomodulation by disturbed brain-immune communication. We
detected a marked release of HMGB1 from the ischemic brain in
the hyperacute phase after the lesion. Mass spectrometric analysis
revealed a “maturation” of the post-translationally unmodified,
fully reduced isoform of HMGB1 toward the cytokine-inducing
isoform within the acute phase (Fig. 8A). For the cytokinestimulating function of HMGB1, its residues at C23 and C45
must form a disulfide bond, whereas the unpaired C106 within
BoxB must be in the reduced thiol state (Yang et al., 2010). This
isoform is a very strong stimulus for various types of immune
cells comparable with the stimulatory function of bacterial antigens, such as LPS (Lotze and Tracey, 2005). In this study, we have
identified the induction of an “exhausted phenotype” of mature
splenic monocytes after the initial (over)activation of the peripheral immune cells by brain-released HMGB1 in the acute phase
(Fig. 8 B, C). The induction of reduced responsiveness of monocytes/macrophages to endotoxins or bacterial stimuli after a
strong inflammatory reaction has been described in immunological conditions, such as sepsis or sterile inflammatory response
(Randow et al., 1995; Haupt et al., 1998; Cavaillon et al., 2005).
This hyporesponsive state of innate immune cells encompasses
the reduced expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules as
well as the impaired secretion of proinflammatory cytokines
(TNF-␣ and IL-12). These features have also been reported after
brain ischemia (Hug et al., 2009; Urra et al., 2009b; Vogelgesang
et al., 2013). Inhibition of the initially overshooting immune activation in the hyperacute phase by neutralizing HMGB1 interaction with its receptors ameliorated also the secondary
monocyte exhaustion, indicating a functional link between the
distinct and opposing immunological phenotypes observed in
the acute and subacute phase after brain lesion.

In addition to the exhaustion of mature monocytes, we describe here for the first time the HMGB1-induced expansion of a
monocyte subpopulation after stroke. This subpopulation has
features of MDSCs and contributes to the immunosuppressive
state in the subacute phase. However, the source of this expanding population could not be determined with certainty. Our findings suggest that it might arise from bone marrow egress, result
from peripheral expansion, or represent a mere phenotypical
change in the monocyte population. The phenotype of MDSCs
was previously identified in several disease models as
CD11b ⫹Gr-1 ⫹ cells, although distinct functional subsets have
meanwhile been characterized in different immunological milieus and disease models (Gabrilovich and Nagaraj, 2009). Although a relative expansion of monocytes after stroke was noted
also in previous clinical and experimental studies (Vogelgesang et
al., 2008; Liesz et al., 2009, 2013a), the phenotypical and functional characteristics of this expanding population had not been
analyzed so far. We detected a strong suppressive function of the
expanding CD11 ⫹Ly-6C ⫹ population on lymphocytes. Additionally, the expression of Arg1 was strongly increased in the
splenic monocyte population. Previous reports suggested a suppressive and even toxic function of MDSCs on lymphocytes by
upregulation of Arg1, which induces apoptosis in activated lymphocytes by limiting the essential L-arginine concentration
needed for lymphocyte viability (Bronte et al., 2003; Rodríguez
and Ochoa, 2008). This novel finding of MDSC expansion and
increased Arg1 expression might be one mechanism explaining
the induction of lymphocytopenia after stroke, a key feature of
poststroke immunosuppression syndrome (Meisel et al., 2005).
Indeed, lymphocytopenia has been consistently described in this
study and previously in patients and experimental models of extensive brain lesions (Vogelgesang et al., 2008; Klehmet et al.,
2009; Urra et al., 2009a) and was found to be an independent
predictor of poststroke infections in patients (Liesz et al., 2013a).
The above-mentioned characteristics of lymphocyte-suppressing
MDSCs after stroke and the necessity of APCs for the stimulation of T cells by HMGB1 demonstrated herein, suggest an
interaction of monocytes/APCs with lymphocytes downstream of the HMGB1-mediated pathways. However, the exact
molecular pathways underlying this potential monocyte/APC–
lymphocyte interaction after brain ischemia require further investigation. Furthermore, also other immunosuppressive cell
populations induced by the acute brain injury might be involved
in the observed peripheral immune alterations.
In conclusion, our data strongly suggest that HMGB1 release
from the ischemic brain and signaling through the pattern recognition receptor RAGE is a key mechanism of the intricate peripheral immune response after brain injury that has profound
consequences on clinical outcome. Interfering with this pathway
may provide a promising therapeutic target for prevention of
immune-mediated complications of acute brain damage.
