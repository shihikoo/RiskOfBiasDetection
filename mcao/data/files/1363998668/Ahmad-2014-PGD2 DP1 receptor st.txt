Every year, a substantial amount of the population
endures new or recurrent stroke, yet eﬀective therapies
with wide beneﬁcial outcomes are lacking. Decades
after being identiﬁed as ‘‘the best therapy’’ against
stroke, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) still remains
the only evidence-based and FDA-approved therapy
(Zivin et al., 1985; The National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Stroke rt-PA Stroke Study Group, 1995).
However, tPA treatment is extensively time dependent,
which restricts its beneﬁcial eﬀects to only a small percentage of the population (Kohrmann et al., 2010). The
severe blood ﬂow deﬁcit in the ischemic core leads to
an irreversible cascade of cell death within minutes,
whereas the cells in the peri-infarct undergo milder insults
due to having residual perfusion from collateral circulation
(Liebeskind, 2003; Shuaib et al., 2011; Riva et al., 2012).
Therefore, one of the objectives in rescuing the brain after
stroke is to use a therapeutic intervention that augments
perfusion in the penumbra (Shih et al., 2009; Sutherland
et al., 2012). Although numerous trials are underway for
stroke treatment, the need to ﬁnd a better and eﬀective
strategy to rescue the brain after stroke still continues
(Fisher et al., 2009; Eltzschig and Eckle, 2011;
Sutherland et al., 2012).
Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is the most abundant
prostaglandin in the brain and it exerts its actions mainly
through its DP1 receptors, although DP2 receptors are
also reported (Matsuoka et al., 2000). Cloning and characterization of the DP1 receptor in 1995 provided an
abundant avenue to study the role of PGD2 in various
physiologic conditions (Boie et al., 1995; Thornhill and
Asselin, 1999; Urade and Hayaishi, 1999). The characterization and availability of highly selective DP1 ligands
such as BW245C have played a crucial role in determining the eﬀect of this receptor in various disease conditions
(Kiriyama et al., 1997; Koch et al., 2005). This receptor
has been shown to protect rat hippocampal slice cultures
against N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and oxygenglucose deprivation-induced toxicity (Liang et al., 2005).
Similarly, in a mouse neonatal hypoxic-ischemic model,
DP1 receptor activation by BW245C has a neuroprotective eﬀect (Taniguchi et al., 2007). Data from our lab show
that DP1 / mice have greater brain infarction compared
with the WT mice. Moreover, intracerebroventricular
pre-treatment with the DP1 agonist BW245C minimizes
excitotoxic and ischemic brain damage (Saleem et al.,
2007; Ahmad et al., 2010). In vivo data suggest that
DP1 activation improves hemodynamics (Koch et al.,

Abstract—Stroke is a leading cause of death and morbidity
worldwide, yet eﬀective treatments are lacking. The association of prostaglandin D2 and its DP1 receptor with vasculature and blood propelled us to examine whether the
clinically tested DP1 receptor agonist BW245C had beneﬁcial eﬀects following stroke. To determine if BW245C aﬀects
basal cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF), C57BL/6 WT and DP1 /
mice were given a single i.p. injection of vehicle or
BW245C, and CBF was recorded for 2 h. To test the eﬀect
of BW245C on stroke, WT and DP1 / mice were subjected
to middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by a single
i.p. injection of vehicle or 0.02, 0.2, or 2.0-mg/kg BW245C
immediately before reperfusion. Functional and anatomical
outcomes were determined at 96 h. We also determined
the eﬀect of BW245C on CBF in peri-infarct and core during
occlusion and reperfusion. Furthermore, we tested the eﬀect
of BW245C on bleeding time and ex vivo coagulation.
BW245C treatment increased the basal CBF signiﬁcantly in
WT but not in DP1 / mice. The BW245C treatment also
signiﬁcantly improved functional outcome and lowered
infarction volume. The multisite CBF monitoring by laserDoppler ﬂowmetry shows that BW245C signiﬁcantly
increased the CBF in peri-infarct, with a signiﬁcant inverse
correlation between infarction and CBF. The signiﬁcantly
higher infarction volume in DP1 /
mice remained
unchanged with BW245C treatment. Moreover, BW245C
preserves hemostasis in non-stroke conditions. Combined,
these data suggest that the DP1 receptor is an endogenous
target that can rescue the brain following stroke by
regulating CBF and hemostasis. Ó 2014 IBRO. Published

2005), which may have a beneﬁcial eﬀect on stroke
outcomes. Moreover, it has also been reported that
PGD2 and BW245C attenuate the platelet aggregation
mediated by arachidonic acid and other platelet
aggregators (Whittle et al., 1983; Schuligoi et al., 2007).
Although the neuroprotective eﬀect of the DP1 receptor
has been recognized recently, the therapeutic potential
of DP1 activation by the systemic administration of selective pharmacologic agents after stroke has not yet been
tested.
A better collateral circulation and augmented cerebral
blood ﬂow (CBF) along the ischemic/hypoxic territory
have shown to have improved functional and anatomical
outcomes following stroke (Liebeskind, 2003; Shuaib
et al., 2011; Riva et al., 2012). Therefore, given the role
of BW245C on vasodilation and the fact that this compound has already been tested in humans (Whittle
et al., 1983; Shah et al., 1984), in this study, we wanted
to determine whether the systemic treatment of mice with
this DP1 agonist after stroke would have a beneﬁcial
eﬀect, and whether this beneﬁcial eﬀect was through
improved CBF and hemostasis. This study provides
insight into a potential new role for BW245C in stroke,
which makes the DP1 receptor a novel target that can
be used in designing a better therapy to rescue the brain
after stroke.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mice and drugs
Adult male (4–5 months old) C57BL/6 WT and DP1 /
mice were used following the NIH institutional guidelines
for the use and care of laboratory animals. The protocol
was approved by the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions
and the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. The DP1 / mice were inbred and
backcrossed with C57BL/6 WT (Jackson Laboratories,
Bar Harbor, ME) eight to ten generations. The DP1
agonist BW245C was purchased from Cayman
Chemicals, whereas the DP1 / mice provided by Dr.
Shuh Narumiya (Matsuoka et al., 2000) are now being
bred and maintained in our breeding facility at the University of Florida. All animals were randomized and investigators responsible for surgical procedures, drug
treatments, and functional and anatomical outcome measurements were blinded.
Basal CBF measurement
Mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane (3.0% for
induction and 1.5% for maintenance). A vertical skin
incision was made between the right eye and ear, and
the temporal bone was exposed by moving the temporal
muscle. A ﬁber optic probe was placed and ﬁxed with
medical grade adhesive on the skull over middle
cerebral artery (MCA) approximately 6 mm lateral and
1 mm posterior to the bregma, and CBF was monitored
by laser-Doppler ﬂowmetry (LDF) (Moor Instruments,
Devon, UK). Once a stable baseline was obtained, mice
(n = 6/group) were given single i.p. injections of vehicle,
or 0.02-, 0.2-, or 2.0-mg/kg BW245C, and CBF was

261

continuously recorded until 2 h after the injection. To
determine the selectivity of BW245C toward the DP1
receptor and any compensatory mechanism associated
with DP1 receptor deletion, the eﬀect of 0.2-mg/kg
BW245C on CBF was then tested in DP1 / mice
(n = 6).
MCA occlusion (MCAO) and BW245C treatment
Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced by
occluding the MCA with an intraluminal ﬁlament as
described earlier (Longa et al., 1989; Ahmad et al.,
2006). Brieﬂy, WT and DP1 / mice were anesthetized
with continuous isoﬂurane anesthesia. Relative CBF over
the parietal cortex was monitored by LDF by placing the
probe 1 mm posterior to the bregma and 6 mm lateral to
the midline. Occlusion of the MCA was accomplished by
inserting a 7-0 Ethilon nylon monoﬁlament (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) coated with ﬂexible silicone. Successful
occlusion was conﬁrmed by a decrease of >80% in CBF.
During the 60-min occlusion period, the incision was
sutured, anesthesia was discontinued, and the mice were
transferred to a humidity- and temperature-controlled
chamber. Reperfusion was achieved 60 min after occlusion by re-anesthetizing the mice and retracting the ﬁlament. Immediately before reperfusion, mice were given
no treatment (control; n = 13) or single i.p. injections of
vehicle (n = 8), 0.02 (n = 10), 0.2 (n = 8), or 2.0
(n = 8) mg/kg BW245C. The mice were returned to the
chamber for 2 h before being transferred to new, clean
home cages. During the entire surgical procedure and
recovery phase, mice body temperature was maintained
at 37.0 ± 0.5 °C. Postoperative analgesia was provided
solely by inﬁltration of the surgical incision at the end of
the procedure with 0.1-mg/kg bupivacaine.
Functional outcome tests
On day 4 after the occlusion, mice were tested for
diﬀerent functional outcomes as described below:
1. Neurologic deﬁcit score: Neurologic deﬁcit was measured in each mouse on day 4 after reperfusion
according to the following 0- to 4-point graded scoring
system (Hattori et al., 2000): 0 = no deﬁcit; 1 = forelimb weakness and torso turning to the ipsilateral side
when held by tail; 2 = circling to aﬀected side;
3 = unable to bear weight on aﬀected side; and
4 = barrel rolling or no spontaneous activity.
2. Locomotor activity: Mice were individually housed in
the monitoring cages of the automated Home Cage
Video tracking system, which can monitor a maximum
of four cages at the same time (Med Associates Inc.,
St. Albans, VT, USA). After a 15-min habituation, the
recording was started and was continued for 15 min.
Data were obtained in three sets of 5 min each. Cages
were washed and cleaned before and after each testing (Singh et al., 2013).
3. Cylinder test: Mice were tested for this task as
described earlier (Li et al., 2004) with some modiﬁcations. Instead of testing the mice for paw preference,
in this study, mice were tested for their spontaneous

262

reﬂex. The mice were placed in a clear, Plexiglass
cylinder and the time taken by the mice to respond to
the environment by rearing and touching the cylinder
wall was recorded. Each mouse was tested three times
at an interval of 15 min.
4. Hanging wire test: The grip strength of the mice was
assessed by this test as described earlier (Hattori
et al., 2000). Mice were suspended with their forelimbs
from a wire that was stretched at a height of 60 cm
between two poles that were 100 cm apart. The time
taken by the mice to fall down or to reach either side
of the pole was recorded. A soft cushion was placed
beneath the mice to prevent any suﬀering to the mice
from the fall.

Statistical analysis
The TTC-stained brain sections were imaged and
analyzed with ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA),
whereas the Prism software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA,
USA) was used for statistical analysis. The infarction
volume, bleeding time, and uncoagulated content data
were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA followed by
Newman–Keuls multiple range tests. These data are
represented as mean ± SEM. For the correlation
analysis, infarction volume and CBF data were analyzed
by linear regression with a CI of 95%. Functional
outcomes were analyzed by the non-parametric Kruskal–
Wallis analysis of ranks and are presented as medians
with interquartile ranges (25th and 75th percentiles).
Signiﬁcant levels were achieved when P < 0.05.

Infarction volume quantiﬁcation
After the functional outcome assessment, mice were
anesthetized and brains were harvested and processed
for 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining to
determine the infarction volume (Ahmad et al., 2006).
CBF measurement during and after stroke
Mice were prepared for CBF monitoring in the ischemic
core as described above. Similarly, a second probe was
placed approximately 1 mm posterior to the bregma and
2 mm lateral to the midline to monitor CBF changes in
the ischemic peri-infarct. We chose this coordinate
based on previous reports by us and others that most of
the anastomoses in mouse brains are found to be
around 2 mm lateral to the midline (Liebeskind, 2003;
Xu et al., 2010; Glushakov et al., 2013). Thereafter, following the protocol as described above, the mice were
subjected to 60 min of MCAO. The CBF was continuously
monitored and 20 min after occlusion, a single i.p. dose of
0.2-mg/kg BW245C was given. Reperfusion was
achieved 60 min after occlusion and CBF monitoring
was continued for an additional 60 min.
Tail bleeding time after BW245C treatment
To test whether DP1 activation plays a role in hemostasis,
a tail bleeding test was performed as we have described
earlier (Faraday et al., 2013). The mice were untreated
or given an i.p. injection of the vehicle (1% DMSO) or
0.2-mg/kg BW245C. Thirty minutes after the injection,
the mice were anesthetized and placed on a thermoregulated pad to maintain body temperature, and 3 mm of the
tail tip was excised. The tail was immediately dipped in
warm PBS (37.0 ± 0.5 °C) and time to visible cessation
of bleeding was recorded.

RESULTS
BW245C augments basal CBF
All tested doses of BW245C in WT resulted in a signiﬁcant
increase in CBF starting at about 20 min after the
administration and remained elevated for the duration of
the monitoring (Fig. 1). This eﬀect of BW245C treatment
observed in WT was found to be absent in DP1 / mice.
BW245C improves functional outcomes after stroke
Neurologic deﬁcit was signiﬁcantly augmented, whereas
locomotor activity was signiﬁcantly reduced after stroke
in WT mice (Fig. 2A, B). BW245C signiﬁcantly reversed
these conditions. Interestingly, the augmented deﬁcits in
DP1 / mice remained unchanged with the BW245C
treatment. Similarly, the BW245C-treated mice took a
longer time to fall from the elevated wire, whereas the
eﬀect of BW245C in DP1 / mice remained unchanged
compared with the vehicle-treated DP1 /
mice
(Fig. 2C). Moreover, the time taken to respond to the
new environment, as tested by the cylinder test, was
signiﬁcantly attenuated with BW245C treatment in WT
mice, whereas the eﬀect of BW245C was absent in
DP1 / mice (Fig. 2D). Overall, these data suggest that
the DP1 receptor agonist rescues functional deterioration
following stroke.
BW245C rescues the brain from stroke
Systemic treatment of WT mice with 0.2-mg/kg BW245C
1 h after stroke resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in brain
infarction in WT mice, whereas the eﬀect of this
treatment was not observed in DP1 / mice (Fig. 3). The
0.2-mg/kg group had 26.43 ± 15.45% less brain
infarction compared with the vehicle-treated group.

Ex vivo blood coagulation

BW245C improved CBF during and after stroke

To determine whether BW245C facilitates clot formation
ex vivo, 200 lL of mouse blood was mixed and
vortexed with 800 lL of the vehicle or 800 lL of
BW245C (24 lg). The mixture was kept at room
temperature for 2 min followed by centrifugation for 30 s
at 4000g. The tubes were gently taken out and the
amount of uncoagulated supernatant was quantiﬁed.

The CBF started to improve signiﬁcantly in peri-infarct
after 20 min of BW245C administration, whereas the
eﬀect was signiﬁcant in the ischemic core only after
40 min of BW245C administration (Fig. 4). After
reperfusion, the CBF in the ischemic core started to
decline after 10 min of reperfusion, however, it remained
elevated until 40 min after reperfusion and then reached

Fig. 1. BW245C improves basal CBF. WT mice (n = 6/group) were anesthetized and an LDF probe was aﬃxed to the skull and CBF was
monitored. Once the baseline was established, diﬀerent doses of BW245C (0.02-, 0.2-, or 2.0-mg/kg) or vehicle were injected i.p. and CBF was
monitored for 120 min. A BW245C dose of 0.2-mg/kg resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in the CBF. The eﬀect of this treatment was absent in DP1 /
mice. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. ⁄⁄P < 0.01, ⁄⁄⁄P < 0.001, when compared with the vehicle group.

Fig. 2. BW245C attenuates functional deﬁcits after stroke. MCAO was induced by occluding the MCA with a silicone-coated nylon monoﬁlament
and then initiating the reperfusion at 60 min by retracting the ﬁlament. Immediately before reperfusion, mice were given no injection (control; n = 13)
or a single injection of 0.02 (n = 10), 0.2 (n = 8), 2.0-mg/kg BW245C (n = 8) or vehicle (n = 8; 1% DMSO). At 96 h after MCAO, mice were tested
for (a) distance traveled (locomotor deﬁcit), (b) neurologic deﬁcit score, (c) hanging wire test, and (d) cylinder test. MCAO resulted in signiﬁcant
diminution in functional outcomes, whereas 0.2-mg/kg BW245C signiﬁcantly restored the functional outcomes. Data are presented as
mean ± SEM. ⁄P < 0.05,  P < 0.05 when compared with the vehicle group; ns = non-signiﬁcant.

51.2 ± 7.1% (Control), 52.7 ± 8.6% (vehicle), 47.2 ± 7.5% (0.02-mg/kg), 38.7 ± 8.1% (0.2-mg/kg), and 46.7 ± 4.9% (2.0-mg/kg). The 0.2-mg/kg
dose decreased the infarct size signiﬁcantly in WT mice, whereas this dose has no eﬀect on DP1 / mice. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.

Fig. 4. BW245C improves CBF during and after stroke. Mice were anesthetized and two probes were ﬁxed on the skull according to the following
coordinates. Probe 1 (ischemic core): 1 mm posterior to the bregma and 6 mm lateral to the midline; Probe 2: 1 mm posterior to the bregma and
2 mm lateral to the midline. Thereafter, mice were subjected to MCAO and reperfusion was achieved 60 min after occlusion. CBF was monitored
before, during, and until 60 min after reperfusion. (Top panel) Changes in CBF recorded by probe 2 in the peri-infarct area. A signiﬁcant increase in
CBF was observed immediately before reperfusion which remained elevated throughout the monitoring. (Bottom panel) Changes in CBF recorded
by probe 1 in the ischemic core. A signiﬁcant increase in CBF was observed immediately before reperfusion and 30 min after reperfusion, however,
afterward the CBF declined and reached the level of vehicle-treated groups. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. ⁄P < 0.05, ⁄⁄P < 0.01, when
compared with the vehicle group.

A. S. Ahmad / Neuroscience 279 (2014) 260–268

to the level of the vehicle-treated group. Interestingly, the
CBF after reperfusion in the ischemic peri-infarct
remained elevated for the entire duration of monitoring
after reperfusion.
Signiﬁcant correlation between CBF and infarction
volume
A plot between infarction volume and changes in CBF at
60 min after reperfusion by using linear regression
analysis suggests a signiﬁcant correlation between
these two parameters in the ischemic peri-infarct of
BW245C-treated groups (Fig. 5; r2 = 0.74; P < 0.02).
Moreover, a signiﬁcant correlation was also observed
immediately before reperfusion (60 min after occlusion)
in the ischemic peri-infarct (r2 = 0.58; P < 0.05).
However, these correlations were absent in the
ischemic core.
DP1 agonist treatment preserves hemostasis
Systemic administration of BW245C resulted in
signiﬁcantly prolonged bleeding compared with the
vehicle-treated group. Interestingly, the tail bleeding time
was signiﬁcantly lower in the DP1 / mice (Fig. 6A).
Measurement of the uncoagulated content following
vehicle or BW245C addition shows a signiﬁcantly higher
content in the BW245C group compared with the vehicle
group (Fig. 6B).

DISCUSSION
The therapeutic potential of DP1 activation by the
systemic administration of selective pharmacologic
agents after stroke has not been reported. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to show that the
beneﬁcial eﬀects of the DP1 selective agonist BW245C
in stroke appear potentially through regulating CBF and
hemostasis. In this study, we show that the DP1 agonist
increases the basal CBF level. By testing diﬀerent doses

265

of BW245C after stroke, we found that the 0.2-mg/kg
dose, when given 1 h after occlusion, provides signiﬁcant
improvement in functional and neurological outcomes,
and also attenuates brain infarction. Interestingly, when
this agonist was tested in DP1 / mice, no changes
were detected. Moreover, when the DP1 agonist was
given during occlusion, improvements in the CBF of the
ischemic peri-infarct and ischemic core were observed.
Most importantly, we observed a signiﬁcant correlation
between the augmented CBF in the ischemic peri-infarct
and attenuated brain infarction. Furthermore, BW245C
treatment also increased the tail bleeding time and
attenuated ex vivo coagulation.
Recent studies suggest that the status of collateral
circulation and stroke outcomes are directly associated
(Liebeskind, 2003; Maas et al., 2009; Sutherland et al.,
2011; Riva et al., 2012). Although collateral circulation is
an important criterion in clinical settings, this criterion
has not been well tested in basic research. This ﬁeld is
now getting its due credit; several studies propose the
importance of monitoring collateral circulations and suggest the beneﬁcial eﬀects of increased circulation and
perfusion status in the peri-infarct region or the ‘‘area at
risk’’ in stroke (Liebeskind, 2005; Livnat et al., 2010;
Bang et al., 2011). Therefore, by using multisite CBF
monitoring with LDF in the MCA-anterior cerebral artery
border zone (ischemic peri-infarct) and lateral MCA territories (ischemic core), we show for the ﬁrst time a new
physiologic role for the DP1 receptor as the regulator of
the ﬁnal stroke outcome. By extending the CBF monitoring to 1 h after reperfusion, we found two distinct patterns
of CBF in the ischemic peri-infarct and the ischemic core.
Following drug treatment, the ischemic peri-infarct has a
signiﬁcant and sustained increase in CBF even 60 min
after reperfusion. The CBF in the ischemic core also
improved until about 40 min after reperfusion; however,
it gradually decreased and followed a pattern similar to
that observed in the vehicle group (Fig. 4). Interestingly,
a linear regression analysis between the infarction volume

Fig. 5. Infarction volume is inversely related to the CBF. The CBF data immediately before reperfusion (60 min of occlusion) and 60 min after
reperfusion were plotted against the infarction volume. A signiﬁcant correlation between CBF and infarction volume was observed at both time
points in the peri-infarct area. The correlation was stronger at 60 min after reperfusion (r2 = 0.74; P < 0.02) than at 60 min of occlusion (r2 = 0.58;
P < 0.05).

Fig. 6. DP1 agonist preserves hemostasis. (A) Mice were either untreated or given an i.p. injection of the vehicle or 0.2-mg/kg BW245C. Thirty
minutes after the injection, mice were anesthetized and 3 mm of tail tip was excised. The tail was dipped in warm PBS (37.0 ± 0.5 °C) and bleeding
time was recorded. BW245C treatment in WT mice signiﬁcantly prolonged the bleeding as compared with the vehicle-treated groups. Interestingly,
the tail bleeding time was signiﬁcantly lower in DP1 / mice. (B) The eﬀect of BW245C on ex vivo clot formation was tested by mixing 200 lL of
mouse blood with 800 lL of the vehicle or 800 lL BW245C (24 lg). The mixture was kept at room temperature for 2 min then centrifuged for 30 s at
4000g. The tubes were gently taken out and the amount of supernatant (uncoagulated content) was quantiﬁed. A signiﬁcantly higher content in the
BW245C group compared with the vehicle group was found. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. ⁄P < 0.05 when compared with the vehicletreated group.

and CBF suggests a signiﬁcant correlation between the
two in the ischemic peri-infarct 60 min after reperfusion.
A similar pattern was also found in the ischemic periinfarct at 60 min of occlusion. We also observed a similar
correlation pattern in the ischemic core; however, it did
not reach a signiﬁcant level.
These data suggest that BW245C improved overall
CBF. The tissue in the ischemic peri-infarct survived
through collateral circulation, and when the blood ﬂow
was restored, DP1 activation improved the CBF in the
ischemic peri-infarct persistently for a longer duration of
time, eventually limiting the infarction. Similarly, the
increase in CBF in the ischemic core during occlusion
following BW245C treatment suggests that BW245C
induced vasodilation and improved CBF in the ischemic
core as well. However, due to the irreversible cascade
of cell death that had already been initiated in the core,
the short-lived increase in CBF was not able to aﬀord
any protection there. There are various factors, such as
impaired CBF autoregulation and arteriole-neuronastrocyte interaction, that could inﬂuence poor CBF
restoration in the core, even after reperfusion (Cohen
et al., 1997; Peterson et al., 2001; Hamel, 2006;
Hossmann, 2006; Zlokovic, 2008). Moreover, studies
suggest that the occlusion exposes the vascular wall
and initiates a cascade of events, resulting in hypoperfusion (Henriksson et al., 2003; McColl et al., 2004;
Shuaib et al., 2011). Therefore, we believe that poor
CBF restoration after reperfusion as observed in the vehicle group could be due to any of these events, whereas
the DP1 agonist counters these eﬀects and improves
CBF. This conviction is further supported by the fact that
PGD2 and the DP1 agonists inhibit platelet aggregations,
which are one of the prime factors in forming atherosclerosis plaque and resulting in hypoperfusion (Whittle et al.,

1983; Schuligoi et al., 2007). Another factor leading to
better CBF after BW245C treatment could be the interaction of arterioles with astrocytes and neurons in brain
parenchyma. Both of these cell types have been implicated in partially controlling local blood ﬂow (Cohen
et al., 1997; Hamel, 2006; Zlokovic, 2008). Nevertheless,
further testing is needed to completely understand the
molecular mechanisms associated with DP1 receptormediated CBF regulation in the ischemic stroke paradigm.
An important question is whether vessel dilation can
lead to a less complete blockage of the MCA, which
could be a cause of protection? As shown in Fig. 4,
occlusion leads to >80% decrease in CBF in the
ischemic core, which conﬁrms that the occlusion is
complete. Interestingly, after treatment with BW245C,
we do see an increase in CBF in the ischemic periinfarct, as well as in the ischemic core. An increase in
CBF in the ischemic peri-infarct suggests compensatory
blood ﬂow in this region, potentially through collateral
circulation, whereas an increase in CBF in the ischemic
core may imply that it could be due to the vasodilatory
eﬀect of BW245C, which has been reported by others
(Koch et al., 2005; Cheng et al., 2006). However, after
reperfusion, the CBF elevation in the ischemic core
declines, suggesting that the partial increase in CBF
observed during the occlusion phase is lost in the ischemic core. Thus, the temporary vasodilatory eﬀect of
BW245C treatment in the ischemic core was not enough
to induce protection there.
BW245C treatment also resulted in longer bleeding
times and attenuated ex vivo coagulation (Fig. 6), which
could have facilitated the increase in CBF. Taniguchi
and colleagues have shown, in a hypoxic ischemic
model, that DP1 attenuates brain damage through
improved vasculature (Taniguchi et al., 2007). Another

study shows that the DP1 agonist improves systemic
vasodilation, whereas the DP1 antagonist inhibits niacininduced vasodilation in rodents and humans (Cheng
et al., 2006). These accumulating data suggest that the
DP1 receptor plays a critical role in blood ﬂow and hemostasis, therefore it could regulate the ﬁnal outcomes of
stroke. However, the eﬀect of BW245C in increasing
bleeding time should not be compared with the hemorrhagic transformation associated with delayed tPA treatment. There are various major players contributing to
the hemorrhagic property of tPA (Rosenberg, 2002; Lo
et al., 2003; Jickling et al., 2014). One such cascade
could be the dysregulated extracellular proteolytic activity
of tPA on the neurovascular matrix mediated by matrix
metalloproteinases (Rosenberg, 2002). Another candidate mediator could be the interaction of tPA with the
overactivation of NMDA receptors. The accumulating
data thus far suggest a potential role of the DP1 receptor
in hemodynamics (Koch et al., 2005; Cheng et al., 2006);
however, the role of DP1 activation in proteolytic or thrombolytic activity has not been reported. In the current study,
by measuring tail bleeding time, we indirectly show that
DP1 activation prevents platelet adhesion and aggregation in response to an injury, which is one of the major
causes of building atherosclerotic plaque leading to ischemic stroke. Similar tail bleeding studies are used in many
other studies where platelet response is measured indirectly (Lauer et al., 2011; Faraday et al., 2013). These
data in conjunction with blood ﬂow data suggest that the
increase in bleeding time could be due to an overall
increase in CBF and/or vasodilation.
In our experimental conditions, hemorrhage is
observed in a very small percentage of control as well
as treated groups after MCAO. These hemorrhagic
incidents are due to the perforation of the MCA by the
ﬁlament, as has been reported in the literature. There
was no diﬀerence in hemorrhage after MCAO among
the groups. According to our preset exclusion criteria, all
animals exhibiting hemorrhage were excluded from the
study.
We recognize the limitations associated with LDF such
that it measures microvascular perfusion in a small and
localized cortical region and expresses blood ﬂow values
in arbitrary perfusion units that indicate relative rather
than absolute CBF. Despite these known limitations,
LDF provides continuous dynamic monitoring, the
generation of quantitative data within the same session,
easy to interpret data, and is cost eﬀective. It would be
interesting to know whether other, more sophisticated
imaging techniques or the use of radioligands such as
14
C iodoantipyrine could also provide similar quantitative
data under similar experimental conditions. Nonetheless,
in clinical settings, a strong correlation has been reported
between improved CBF and improved functional and
anatomical outcomes after stroke. Interestingly, in this
study, we also found a signiﬁcant correlation between
improved CBF and attenuated brain infarction. We also
recognize that administration of BW245C 1-h postischemia is not clinically relevant. This study was
performed to test the proof of concept that BW245C
treatment post-ischemia protects the brain by regulating

blood ﬂow. Further studies are underway to test the
therapeutic window of BW245C in diﬀerent models of
MCAO.

CONCLUSION
Based on the previous reports suggesting a strong
interaction of PGD2 and DP1 receptor in blood and
vasculature, we show for the ﬁrst time that systemic
administration of DP1 receptor selective agonist
BW245C following stroke increases CBF and decreases
infarction volume. It is important to note that previously,
we and others have reported that DP1 receptor
activation by BW245C attenuates ischemic brain
damage partially through minimizing acute excitotoxicity
(Liang et al., 2005; Ahmad et al., 2010). Therefore,
whether the DP1 receptor has its beneﬁcial eﬀect by regulating the two cascades (i.e., blood ﬂow and excitotoxicity) independently or it aﬀects these cascades cohesively
needs further examination. Although the molecular mechanisms that lead to the improvement in CBF after stroke
following BW245C treatment are yet to be determined,
this study provides a novel insight into a potential physiologic role of DP1 activation, leading to neuroprotection.
