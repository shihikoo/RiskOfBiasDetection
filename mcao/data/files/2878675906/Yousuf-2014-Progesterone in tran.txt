Abstract
Rationale Previous studies demonstrate the neuroprotective
effects of progesterone in numerous animal injury models, but
a systematic dose–response study in a transient ischemic
stroke model is lacking.
Objectives We investigated the effects of progesterone at different doses on post-stroke brain infarction and functional
deficits in middle-aged rats.
Methods Cerebral ischemia was induced in 13-month-old
male Sprague–Dawley rats by right middle cerebral artery
occlusion for 2 h followed by reperfusion. Rats received
intraperitoneal injections of 8, 16, or 32 mg/kg of progesterone (P8, P16, P32) or vehicle at 2 h post-occlusion followed
by subcutaneous injections at 6 h and every 24 h post-injury
for 7 days. Functional recovery was evaluated at intervals over
22 days using motor, sensory, and cognitive tests. Infarct size
was evaluated at 22 days post-stroke.
Results Repeated-measures ANOVA showed significant
group effects on grip strength, rotarod, and sensory neglect.
All progesterone-treated groups had improved (p<0.05) spatial memory performance. The P8 and P16 groups showed
maximum improvement in long-term memory compared to
vehicle. Significant (p<0.05) gait impairments were observed
in the vehicle group compared to shams. Animals receiving
the P8 dose showed maximum gait improvement compared to
vehicle. Post hoc analysis revealed that the P8 and P16 groups
showed significant attenuation in infarct volume compared to
vehicle. Animals receiving the P32 dose did not show any
effect on infarct volume.
Conclusions Although all doses were somewhat effective,
progesterone given at 8 mg/kg led to the most consistent

Introduction
Stroke occurs every 40 s in the USA and takes a life every
4 min (Roger et al. 2012). Ischemic stroke accounts for 87 %
of all strokes (Muntner et al. 2006). Aging is a major nonmodifiable risk factor, and an aged person with stroke is more
likely to suffer cognitive impairments. One in six older people
suffer a stroke, and 30 % of these individuals develop vascular
dementia or vascular cognitive impairment (Savva and
Stephan 2010).
A number of clinical trials seeking a safe and effective
stroke treatment have failed in recent years and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) remains one of the few pharmacologic treatment options. Unfortunately, tPA has a very narrow
therapeutic time window and can have severe side effects
including intracerebral hemorrhage. Mortality rates reach a
striking 75 % at 3 months (The NINDS t-PA Stroke Study
Group 1997; Strbian et al. 2011). Using tPA for stroke has
been compared to using “gasoline to put out fire” (Millard
2013). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a safe and
effective drug with a wide therapeutic window.
Progesterone (PROG), an ovarian and adrenal steroid, is
also a potent neurosteroid (Schumacher et al. 1996; Baulieu
et al. 2001) because it is also synthesized in the brain.
Numerous pre-clinical studies have reported its efficacy
in a variety of injury models (for review see Deutsch
et al. 2013). PROG’s efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in two independent phase II clinical trials for
moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) (Wright

3314

et al. 2007; Xiao et al. 2008). PROG effects are currently
being studied under two independent phase III clinical
trials for TBI (Protect III, at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/
NCT00822900; SyNAPSe, at http://www.synapse-trial.
com). Increasing pre-clinical evidence from our and other
laboratories around the world provides important corroboration that PROG treatment improves functional recovery
and reduces brain infarction in different stroke models (Atif
et al. 2013; Yousuf et al. 2013; De Nicola et al. 2013;
Gibson et al. 2011; Wong et al. 2013).
The Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable
(STAIR) committee, which seeks to advance the development
of acute and restorative stroke therapies (Albers et al. 2011),
recommends that preclinical stroke studies include dose–response relationships, extend therapeutic time windows, and
test efficacy in multiple stroke models, aged animals, and
animals with comorbidities. In the present study, we evaluated
dose–response relationships for PROG treatment following
ischemic stroke in older rats. We tested the therapeutic effects
of three dosages of PROG (8, 16, and 32 mg/kg) using a
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in
middle-aged male rats, which are better models of the older
human population more at risk for stroke than their younger
counterparts. Because behavioral assessment after stroke is
among the most important factors in evaluating the effectiveness of any neuroprotective drug (Stroke Treatment Academic
Industry Roundtable 1999), we used a battery of behavioral
tests to determine the most effective dose of PROG that could
potentially be used for human ischemic stroke patients. We
evaluated brain infarction and functional recovery following
PROG treatment over 3 weeks.

Materials and methods
All behavioral testing, drug treatment, and histological assays
were performed independently by a researcher double blinded
to the experimental conditions.
Animals and treatment regimen Male Sprague–Dawley rats
(450–500 g; 13 months of age at the beginning of the experiments; Harlan) were obtained, quarantined for 7 days before
the experiment, and housed in an AAALAC-approved Research Animal Facility with a temperature- (21–25 °C),
humidity-controlled (45–50 %) and light-controlled environment under a 12-h reverse light/dark cycle with free access to
food and water. Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals, and all other applicable regulations, policies, and procedures, were followed and approved
by Emory University Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee (Protocol #200-1517). Rats were randomized to the
treatment conditions, and the identity of the groups was coded

Psychopharmacology (2014) 231:3313–3323

to avoid experimenter bias. Investigators were blinded to the
allocation of treatment while doing surgeries or evaluating
outcomes.
We calculated the starting sample sizes to be at least eight
animals/group to reject the null hypothesis (of no differences
among the treatment groups relative to untreated controls) at a
power of 0.8 with a p value of <0.05. A total of 40 rats had
tMCAO surgery and 35 survived. Three additional rats were
excluded based on the criteria for LDF inclusion/exclusion of
animals. Animals were assigned to tMCAO vehicle (n=8),
PROG 8-mg/kg (P8, n=8), PROG 16-mg/kg (P16, n=8), or
PROG 32-mg kg (P32, n=8) groups. A total of eight animals
underwent sham surgery as a control but received no PROG
(n=8).
PROG (P-0130; Sigma–Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO) was
dissolved in 22.5 % 2-hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin (HBC).
One hour post-tMCAO, the animals were given an i.p. injection (to ensure more rapid absorption) of 8, 16, or 32 mg/kg of
PROG, followed by subcutaneous injections at 6 h post-injury
and then every 24 h for the next 7 days. The dose was tapered
over the final two treatments. The PROG dose was reduced by
50 % each day for the last 2 days of treatment to avoid PROG
withdrawal effects, which compromise functional recovery
and produce an inflammatory rebound effect (Cutler et al.
2005, 2006a, b). The tMCAO vehicle and sham-operated
animals received only HBC.
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion Transient cerebral
ischemia was induced by occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery as previously described (Longa et al. 1989). Our
standard procedures are as follows: A midline incision is made
on the ventral surface of the neck and the right common
carotid arteries are isolated and ligated with 6.0 silk suture.
The internal carotid and pterygopalatine artery are temporarily
occluded with a microvascular clip. A 4-0 Doccol filament
(Doccol Corporation, Redlands, CA) is introduced into the
internal carotid artery through the incision in the external
carotid artery. The filament is advanced approximately
20 mm distal to the carotid bifurcation. Relative cerebral
blood flow (CBF) is monitored by laser Doppler flowmetry
(LDF) for the entire 2 h of occlusion. In sham-operated rats,
the external carotid artery is surgically prepared for insertion
of the filament but the filament is not inserted.
Drug treatment was randomly assigned 5 min before onset
of reperfusion. After 2 h of MCAO, the occluding filament
was withdrawn back into the common carotid artery to allow
for reperfusion. Relative CBF was monitored for 5 min before
the wound was sutured and the rats were then permitted to
recover from anesthesia. We monitored heartbeat and blood
oxygen saturation levels (SpO2) using a SurgiVetTM pulse
oximeter. CBF, heart rate, hemoglobin levels, blood glucose
level, and other biochemical variables were monitored continuously during surgery. Body temperature was maintained at

Psychopharmacology (2014) 231:3313–3323

37 °C using an automated heat lamp (Harvard Apparatus,
South Natick, MA). All animals with LDF >40 % were
excluded from the study to ensure uniform and consistent
large ischemic damage. The animals’ baseline and postsurgery weights on days 2, 7, 14, and 21 were taken as an
indicator of their general well-being.

Behavioral testing
Motor coordination Motor impairment was assessed with the
accelerating rotarod (Atif et al. 2013). Rats were pre-trained
before surgery in two sessions 5 min apart. The animals were
habituated to the stationary rod and then placed on the rotating
rod. The rod was started at 2 rpm and accelerated linearly to
5 rpm within 180 s. Latency to fall off the rotarod was
determined before ischemia and then post-surgery. The animals were evaluated at days 2, 6, 9, and 21 post-surgery.
Grip strength A grip strength meter (Columbus Instruments,
Columbus, OH) was used to measure the degree of force
necessary to make the animal release a pull grid assembly
with the forepaws. A digital reading (in Newtons) of two
successive trials was obtained for each rat, and then averaged
for analysis. Baseline values for forelimb grip strength were
measured pre-surgery and at 2, 6, 9, and 21 days post-surgery.
Somatosensory-neglect test This test measures the detection
of tactile sensation of the affected limb to small pieces of
adhesive tape placed on the forelimbs after MCAO
(Esneault et al. 2008). Removable sticky tape was placed on
the ventral side of the paw contralateral to the induced stroke.
The time taken to contact/sense the tape and the time taken to
remove it were recorded during a 180-s observation period.
Two trials per animal were averaged for analysis. Baseline
values were taken prior to surgery; post-surgical testing was
repeated at 3, 7, 10, and 22 days.
Cognitive testing The Morris water maze (MWM) apparatus
consists of a 133-cm diameter circular tank filled with opaque
water (20±1 °C; Artista™ nontoxic white paint) to a depth of
64 cm (23 cm from top of tank). A platform (11×11 cm) was
submerged to a depth of 2 cm and placed approximately
28 cm from the wall of the pool in the center of the northeast
quadrant. Each trial was videotaped by a ceiling-mounted
video camera and the animals’ movement tracked using a
computer-assisted tracking system. We administered two
types of tests: (1) acquisition of spatial memory and (2) spatial
probe trial performed after the acquisition phase. Testing
began 13 days post-injury, and the rats were examined for
7 days with two trials each session. Parameters for the acquisition of spatial memory test were latency to reach the platform, length of path to platform, and swim strategy, i.e.,

3315

percent of total time spent in the outer versus inner annulus.
The eighth session was a spatial probe trial in which the
platform was removed and the rats were placed into the core
of the pool and allowed to swim freely for 90 s. This task
measures swim strategies and working (short-term, trial-totrial) and reference (longer-term, day-to-day) memory. As a
measure of reference memory, time spent in the quadrant that
previously contained the platform was recorded and calculated as percentage of total time spent in pool.
Gait analysis Animals were tested on a Catwalk system
(Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, The Netherlands) which consists of an enclosed walkway set on a glass
plate on which a rat can run from one side to the other. Green
light enters at the long edge of the plate and can escape only
where the animal’s paws make contact with the plate. When
this happens the light is scattered and the paws’ images are
captured by a high-speed video camera under the walkway,
transformed into digital images, and transferred to a computer.
Rats were pre-trained on the walkway 5 days before surgery
and evaluated at post-surgical days 6 and 21. After each
footprint was identified and labeled, a wide range of gait data
was generated, including: (1) the spatial parameters related to
individual paws (intensity, maximum area, print area); (2)
relative spatial relationship between different paws (stride
length); (3) inter-limb coordination (step pattern, regularity
index, and phase lag); and (4) temporal parameters (swing,
stance, cadence, and walk speed).
Analysis of infarct volume Cerebral infarct size was evaluated
using previously applied methods (Ishrat et al. 2010). On postischemia day 22, animals were deeply anesthetized using
isoflurane. After transcardial perfusion with cold saline
followed by 10 % buffered formalin, brains were extracted,
fixed in gradient sucrose solution, and cut coronally into
20-μm sections for histological analysis. On average, a total
of 14 brain sections were used from each animal to evaluate
infarct size. Entire brain sections were stained in 0.1 % cresyl
violet solution for 10 min at 45 °C, and then rinsed in distilled
water. Stained sections were fixed by serial dehydration in
alcohol and xylene and mounted with xylene-based cytoseal.
Fixed sections were coded to hide group identity and then
scanned. Infarct areas, defined as areas showing reduced Nissl
staining under light microscopy, were traced and quantified
with an image-analysis system (ImageJ, 1.38, NIH, Rockville,
MD). Infarct size was calculated by multiplying the infarct
area on each section by the distance between sections and
represented as a percentage of the size of the contralateral
hemisphere±the standard error of the mean (SEM).
Statistical analysis of data As noted, based on a delta value of
1.5 we calculated the sample sizes and power needed to reject
the null hypothesis (of no differences among the treatment

3316

Psychopharmacology (2014) 231:3313–3323

groups relative to untreated controls) to achieve >80 % power
to detect a 50 % difference. The number of rats per group at
these criteria was determined to be at least eight. Calculations
were obtained using SPSS 11.0 software. All behavioral data
were analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA, followed by a
Tukey post hoc test. Other results were analyzed with oneway ANOVA followed by LSD and Tukey HSD post test for
multiple comparisons. All results were expressed as mean±
SEM and the criterion for statistical significance was set at
p<0.05. To establish a correlation between brain infarction
and functional deficits, the Pearson correlation coefficient was
evaluated using Microsoft Excel 10.

Results
Physiological monitoring We observed no significant differences among the groups in CBF during ischemia and early
reperfusion, or in glucose or Hb, suggesting that the relative
ischemic insult, glucose, and Hb were equivalent among all
groups (Table 1).
Body weight General well-being of the animals is shown by
their body weight changes at different time-points after
tMCAO. No significant differences were seen in the body
weights of the animals between any of the groups at 21 days.
Sham animals maintained their body weights consistently,
whereas in the vehicle group a significant decrease (p<0.05)
was seen compared with sham values. Baseline values were
almost identical for all groups. Some improvement in weight
was seen in the 8- and 16-mg/kg PROG groups compared
with vehicle but it was not significant. No weight gains were
seen in the P32 animals compared to the vehicle-treated group
(data not shown).
Effect of PROG treatment on rotarod performance RMANOVA showed a significant group effect in the rotarod
performance of PROG-treated animals (F(4, 35) = 3.308;
p<0.021). We observed a significant deficit in motor performance in vehicle-treated animals compared to their sham
counterparts at 2, 6, 9, and 21 days post-injury (p<0.05;
Fig. 1). Post hoc analyses showed that PROG treatment at
8-, 16-, and 32-mg/kg doses significantly improved the ability

of animals to remain on the rotarod at 6, 9, and 21 days postinjury compared to their vehicle group (p<0.05; Fig. 1). At
day 21 post-injury, the 8-mg/kg dose of PROG was found to
be more neuroprotective, showing a 61.84 % improvement in
rotarod performance compared to 50.93 and 46.54 % in the
16- and 32-mg/kg groups, respectively.
Effect of PROG treatment on grip strength A significant
group effect (F(4, 35) =17.89; p<0.001) in the grip strength of
PROG-treated animals was observed. There was a decrease in
grip strength in vehicle-treated animals compared to shams
(p<0.05; Fig. 2). Post hoc analyses showed that PROG treatments at both 8- and 16-mg/kg doses significantly improved
grip strength compared to vehicle group (p<0.05; Fig. 2).
PROG at the 32-mg/kg dose was neuroprotective only at
6 days post-injury. At day 21, the 8-mg/kg dose was more
effective in restoring grip strength (127.62 %) compared to the
vehicle group. PROG at 16 mg/kg showed a 94.23 %
improvement.
Effect of PROG treatment on sensory neglect We observed a
significant group effect on latency (F(4, 35) =3.13; p<0.026) to
remove sticky tape from the contralateral forepaw. There was a
significant increase in latency to remove the sticker in vehicletreated animals compared to shams at 3, 7, 10, and 22 days
post-injury (p<0.05; Fig. 3). Post hoc analyses showed that
PROG treatments at 8 mg significantly decreased removal

treatment. MCAO caused a significant (p<0.05) increase in
time to reach the platform in vehicle-treated animals compared
to shams. PROG treatment at 8, 16, and 32 mg/kg produced a
significant decrease in swim-time to reach the hidden platform
at all time-points compared to the vehicle-treated animals
(p<0.05; Fig. 4a).

Fig. 2 Dose–response effect of PROG on tMCAO-induced grip strength
deficits in middle-aged rats. Rats were tested for grip strength at 2, 6, 9,

maximum improvement. Values are expressed as means±SEM (n=8

latency compared to vehicle-only values at 7, 10, and 22 days
post-injury (p<0.05; Fig. 3). Rats given PROG at 16 mg/kg
showed improvement in removal latency at day 22 only. Rats
receiving 32 mg/kg PROG showed no significant effect on
sensory neglect at any time point. At day 22 post-injury the
most effective dose was found to be 8 mg/kg, which led to an
84.79 % reduction in removal latency; the 16-mg/kg dose led
to 75.11 % reduced removal latency.

maximum improvement in removal latency. Values are expressed as
means±SEM (n=8). Significant difference #p<0.05 compared to sham
and *p<0.05 compared to vehicle

Memory The probe trial revealed that vehicle-treated animals
spent significantly (p<0.05) less time in the platform quadrant
compared to shams. Rats treated with PROG at 8 and 16 mg/kg
spent significantly more time in the platform quadrant (136.25
and 96.53 %, respectively; p<0.05) compared to the vehicletreated animals.
Delayed PROG treatment reduces gait impairment
Stand phase We measured the duration in seconds of the
contact of each rat’s paw with the glass floor of the apparatus.
Stand time in the use of the contralateral forepaw (% baseline)
showed a significant group effect (F(4, 35) =12.63; p<0.001)
following PROG treatment. There was a significant (p<0.05)
decrease in stand time in vehicle-treated rats compared to their
sham group. Post hoc analyses showed that PROG treatment
at 8 mg/kg significantly increased stand time compared to the
vehicle groups at 6 and 21 days post-injury (p<0.05; Fig. 5a).
PROG at 16 mg/kg was effective only at 21 days post-injury.
No significant effect of 32-mg/kg PROG treatment on stand
time was observed at any time point compared to vehicle
(Fig. 5a).
Contact area Contact area is a measure of spasticity. Transient
MCAO led to a persistent reduction of maximal paw contact
area. Contact area (percent baseline) of the contralateral forepaw showed a significant group effect (F(4, 35) = 13.61;
p<0.001) following PROG treatment. There was a significant
(p<0.05) decrease in contact area in vehicle-treated rats at 6
and 21 days post-injury compared to shams. Post hoc analyses
showed that delayed PROG treatment at 8- and 16-mg/kg
doses significantly increased the contact area compared to
the vehicle group at 6 and 21 days post-injury (p<0.05;
Fig. 5b). No significant effect of 32-mg/kg PROG treatment
on contact area was observed at any time compared to vehicle
(Fig. 5b). We observed 125 and 88.25 % increases in contact
area following PROG treatment at 8- and 16-mg/kg doses,
respectively, compared to vehicle at 21 days.
Print length This is the length (horizontal direction) of the
complete paw print, which is the sum of all contacts with the
floor. The print length (% baseline) of the contralateral forepaw showed a significant group effect (F (4, 35) = 9.09;
p<0.001) following PROG treatment. We observed a significant (p<0.05) decrease in the print length of vehicle-treated
rats at different times post-injury compared to sham groups.

whether infarct size affects functional outcomes (Fig. 7). We
observed a significant correlation between infarct volume and
motor activity on rotarod (r=−0.408; p <0.05) and grip
strength (r=−0.553; p<0.05) at day 21. The analysis of infarction volume and gait deficits revealed a significant correlation with LF stand (r=−0.558; p<0.05) and contact area (r=
−0.596; p<0.05), whereas no significant correlation was
found with print length (r=−0.375; p<0.07). We found no
significant correlation of infarction volume with the sensoryneglect test (r= −0.074; p < 0.730) or cognitive function
(MWM probe trial, r=−0.255; p<0.227).

PROG treatment attenuates infarction volume A significant
group effect (F(3, 20) =7.529; p<0.001) was observed in infarction volume among the groups on day 21 post-surgery. CV
staining revealed a significant increase in infarct volume in
vehicle-treated animals (p<0.05; Fig. 6) compared with the
PROG-treated animals. Post hoc analysis revealed that PROG
treatment at 8 and 16 mg/kg resulted in a significant (p<0.05)
reduction in infarct volume compared to vehicle-treated rats.
However, there was no significant effect of P32 treatment on
infarct volume.

Discussion

Correlations to brain infarction We conducted a correlation
analysis between brain infarction volume and functional deficits in different groups at post-stroke day 21 to determine

We conducted our research in older animals which, like
humans, are more prone to stroke than the younger population
(Donnan et al. 2008). In most stroke research, young animals
are preferred over aged, probably for two main reasons: aged
animals are more expensive, and they present technical and
methodological challenges during surgery and training on

behavioral outcomes (Turner et al. 2013). In this study, we
established a dose–response relationship of PROG against
transient ischemic stroke-induced functional deficits and brain
infarction in middle-aged male rats. We tested three PROG
doses—8, 16, and 32 mg/kg—and found that the 8-mg/kg
treatment was, overall, more neuroprotective in decreasing
infarct volume and improving behavioral outcomes over
3 weeks of functional testing.
While considerable attention has been paid to treatment
with PROG in the acute phases of ischemic injury, less is
known about the changes that occur in the sub-acute phase.
In this study, we tried to model a clinical setting by using
middle-aged rats tested for 3 weeks after injuries to evaluate the efficacy of PROG over a longer period of time.
Using behavioral tests that remain sensitive to deficits up
to weeks after ischemic injury, we found that functional

impairments were much more persistent in the vehicle group
compared to the sham-operated animals. PROG treatment at
8, 16, and 32 mg/kg led to behavioral restoration and decreased infarct volumes. Additional support for the results
reported here is provided by the neuroprotective effectiveness
of PROG treatment demonstrated in different models of stroke
(Ishrat et al. 2009, 2012; Yousuf et al. 2013; Atif et al. 2013;
Gibson and Murphy 2004; Gibson et al. 2011).
Overall dose effects We found that 8- and 16-mg/kg doses of
PROG provided the best neuroprotection after tMCAO, while
32 mg/kg was not as effective. Goss et al. (2003) tested the
same three doses of PROG after TBI and hypothesized an
inverted U-shaped response curve, with 16 mg/kg the best
dose. Drugs that mimic or enhance the activity of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) have
been found to disrupt functional recovery due to their sedative–hypnotic effects after cortical injury (Jones and Schallert
1992). There is a time window for the process of recovery
after brain injury which is vulnerable to the effects of
GABAergic agents that may alter or permanently disrupt
recovery. Thus 32 mg/kg of PROG may have been ineffective
because the very high dose could have blocked levels of
neural/metabolic activity needed to trigger an acute reparative
response to the injury. High doses of PROG could possibly be
beneficial if treatment is delayed by 2 h or more, but this
question will require new experiments to test the hypothesis.
Behavioral impairments Hemiparesis following stroke reduces the patient’s ability to walk, so improving extremity
functions contributes to an important quantitative measure of
recovery. Numerous studies have measured subtle gait impairments after stroke (Wang et al. 2008; Encarnacion et al. 2011).
MCAO is associated with an increase in the number of contralateral foot faults or paw slips that occur when animals are
subjected to a task that requires good motor coordination
(DeVries et al. 2001). The computer-assisted gait measurement test we used for the present study is sensitive to the
effects of different doses of PROG treatments and enabled us
to track behavioral recovery over time. After tMCAO, the
pattern of deficits and functional recovery can vary in severity
and pattern in aged animals. Because tMCAO was induced on
the right side of the brain, the contralateral or left foot was
used to evaluate gait deficits. We observed significant impairments in the spatial parameters related to individual paws, the
spatial relationship between paws, and in the temporal gait
parameters in the vehicle-treated animals compared to shams.
We tested all the animals at 6, 9, and 21 days post-stroke.
Vehicle-treated animals were severely impaired in their gait
outcomes, whereas the animals receiving P8, P16, and P32
doses showed significantly fewer deficits. The P8 group
showed the best improvements in gait compared with the
other two groups.

Psychopharmacology (2014) 231:3313–3323

We used the motor and grip strength tasks to look for
potential asymmetry in neuromuscular function and the sticky
tape test for somatosensory neglect. We observed that the
vehicle-treated animals showed the worst outcomes in rotarod,
grip strength, and somatosensory neglect compared to sham
animals. PROG at all three doses led to significant improvement in outcome measures, but again, the P8 group had the
best performance overall. A number of studies have reported
that somatosensory stimulation results in improved motor
functions and motor cortex plasticity in stroke patients
(Ward and Cohen 2004; Scalha et al. 2011). We found that
PROG reduced somatosensory neglect, which in turn led to
better motor recovery in the sub-acute post-stroke period. In
contrast, vehicle-treated animals were not able to sense the
sticky tape and had severe motor deficits.
The MWM assesses cognitive deficits associated with
frontal cortex and hippocampal damage. MWM testing revealed severe deficits in learning and memory in vehicletreated aged rats compared to sham animals. These deficits
may be the result not only of spatial memory impairments but
also of a combination of motor, sensory, and cognitive deficits
caused by cortical and hippocampal damage. The vehicletreated animals showed a much stronger thigmotaxic response: they swam along the walls of the pool and did not
try to search for the platform by swimming out to the center or
crossing through the pool. In contrast, rats given the P8 or P16
dose navigated by crisscrossing the pool to locate the platform, suggesting that they used other kinesthetic or extramaze
cues to navigate to the platform. These groups also had
significantly decreased latencies to find the hidden platform
and performed significantly better than the vehicle group in
the probe trial. Again, PROG at 8 mg/kg was most effective
compared to the other doses. Our findings confirm earlier
studies in young animals from our and other laboratories
suggesting that PROG treatment effectively improves cognitive, motor, and sensory functions following stroke and TBI
(Cai et al. 2008; Gibson and Murphy 2004, 2005, 2011; Hua
et al. 2011 Djebaili et al. 2004; Goss et al. 2003).
Infarct volume correlation with behavior In the present study,
we found differential results in correlating infarct volume and
functional recovery on several behavioral tests taken on day
21 post-stroke. We found a significant correlation between
rotarod performance, grip strength, and infarction volume. Of
three gait analysis parameters, only two (stand and contact
area) showed a significant correlation with infarction volume,
and no correlation was found between infarct volume and
somatosensory and cognitive tests. Our data suggest that not
all behavioral measures of functional recovery correlate with
infarct volume. The literature reports inconsistent findings on
the correlation between infarct size and functional recovery.
Some studies show a strong correlation (Borlongon et al.
1999; Peeling et al. 2001) whereas others suggest no

Psychopharmacology (2014) 231:3313–3323

correlation (Wahl et al. 1992; Wallace et al. 1999). Several
factors may account for this variability. For instance, there are
reports suggesting that the timing of various behavioral tests
and the end point at which the tissue was collected may
influence the extent of correlation (DeVries et al. 2001). It is
also possible that neurons surviving the ischemic insult may
remain alive but highly abnormal, and thus could lead to longterm functional disruptions (Aronowski et al. 1996; DeVries
et al. 2001). Therefore, in light of our findings and previous
literature, we speculate that infarct volume may not always
correlate with every type of functional outcome measure.
We have recently published a follow-up time-window
study for PROG in ischemic stroke where the best neuroprotective dose of PROG (8 mg/kg) was administered at 3, 6, and
24 h post-occlusion (Yousuf et al. 2013). We reported that
delayed PROG treatment restores functional recovery and
reduces brain infarction when administered up to 6 h postocclusion. However, 8-mg/kg PROG treatment delayed for
24 h did not significantly improve functional outcomes or
reduce infarction volume. Such effects could be attributed,
in part, to the functional recovery resulting from the
inhibitory/modulatory effect of PROG on key cytotoxic
events that occur during the acute phase of the ischemic brain
injury cascade (within 6–12 h), e.g., neuronal depolarization
due to energy depletion, excitotoxicity, apoptosis, etc. These
are processes which typically tend to dissipate at 24 h and are
therefore less amenable to the window of treatment known to
be effective for PROG. As we noted earlier, it may be worthwhile to test high-dose PROG at delays up to 24 or more
hours, but it is a very unlikely clinical model since epidemiological data shows that very few stroke patients wait that long
to seek care. Nonetheless, it may be worthwhile from an
experimental perspective to verify whether the treatment
could show benefit after such a long delay.

What do we know about mechanisms of action?
There is still a gap in what is known about the mechanisms
involved in progesterone PROG neuroprotection after stroke
in older animals. Various mechanisms have been proposed for
PROG’s pleiotropic actions in enhancing neuronal repair after
various kinds of brain injury (Meffre et al. 2013; Stein 2013;
Petersen et al. 2013; Schumacher et al. 1996). Recently
Yousuf et al. (2013) reported that PROG treatment delayed
up to 6 h after transient ischemic stroke can improve functional deficits and reduce brain infarction, possibly by modulating glial gibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and matrix metalloproteinase-9
(MMP-9) expression. PROG repairs the blood–brain barrier
by reducing the expression of MMPs, thereby preventing
degradation of tight junction proteins (Ishrat et al. 2010) and
decreasing apoptosis through modulation of the P13K/Akt

3321

pathway (Ishrat et al. 2012). Atif et al. (2013) showed that
PROG exerts its effects through a variety of intra-nuclear and
membrane-bound molecular mechanisms after transient
stroke. Wong et al. (2013) found that PROG inhibits the
tPA-induced increase in MMP-9 and VEGF, thereby attenuating cerebral hemorrhage after ischemic stroke. EspinosaGarcia et al. (2014) reported reduction of neurite growth
inhibitory molecules Nogo-A, Ng-R, and Rho-A due to the
restorative effects of PROG treatment, which in turn supported functional preservation of the hippocampus following
global cerebral ischemia. It appears that PROG’s pleiotropic
actions on the reduction of various complex molecular and
genomic cascades of injury are responsible for the improvement in various injury markers and functional outcomes.
Briefly stated, PROG offers neuroprotection through numerous pathways and this is why it can be considered a pleiotropic
hormone.
In conclusion, stroke is a complex systemic disease more
likely to affect the elderly, so stroke studies in older animals
should be given consideration as a necessary first step in
identifying neuroprotective agents and how they should be
employed. Older animals clearly show a more profound and
clinically comparable response to ischemic injury and treatment than “hardy” juveniles. We found that the optimized
dose of PROG (8 mg/kg) most consistently and effectively
reduced brain infarction and improved functional outcomes in
middle-aged animals following tMCAO. These preclinical
dose–response data provide a foundation for PROG as a
potential test candidate for ischemic stroke clinical trial.
