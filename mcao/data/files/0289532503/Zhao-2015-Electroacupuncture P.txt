Abstract We have reported electroacupuncture (EA)
pretreatment induced the tolerance against focal cerebral
ischemia through activation of canonical Notch pathway.
However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully
understood. Evidences suggest that up-regulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) contributes to neuroprotection against ischemia which could interact with
Notch signaling pathway in this process. Therefore, the
current study is to test that up-regulation of HIF-1a associated with Notch pathway contributes to the neuroprotection of EA pretreatment. Sprague–Dawley rats were
treated with EA at the acupoint ‘‘Baihui (GV 20)’’ 30 min
per day for successive 5 days before MCAO. HIF-1a levels
were measured before and after reperfusion. Then, HIF-1a
antagonist 2ME2 and c-secretase inhibitor MW167 were
used. Neurologic deficit scores, infarction volumes, neuronal apoptosis, and Bcl2/Bax were evaluated. HIF-1a and
Yu Zhao and Bin Deng have contributed equally to this work.

Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) were assessed. The
results showed EA pretreatment enhanced the neuronal
expression of HIF-1a, reduced infarct volume, improved
neurological outcome, inhibited neuronal apoptosis, upregulated expression of Bcl-2, and down-regulated expression of Bax after reperfusion in the penumbra, while
the beneficial effects were attenuated by 2ME2. Furthermore, intraventricular injection with MW167 efficiently
suppressed both up-regulation of NICD and HIF-1a after
reperfusion. However, administration with 2ME2 could
only decrease the expression of HIF-1a in the penumbra. In
conclusion, EA pretreatment exerts neuroprotection against
ischemic injury through Notch pathway-mediated upregulation of HIF-1a.

Introduction
Stroke is a major cause of death and disability in adults
throughout the world, and only a minority of stroke patients
receives thrombolytic therapy due to the narrow time
window and side effects associated with the thrombolytic
agent (Go et al. 2013). Therefore, new strategies focusing
on neuroprotection are urgently needed. Preconditioning,
as a potent endogenous protective procedure, activates
several endogenous signaling pathways that protect against
ischemia (Wang et al. 2009). Electroacupuncture (EA) has
been shown to produce clinically beneficial effects in
stroke patients, and EA pretreatment can also induce tolerance against ischemia (Zhao et al. 2012). However, the
signaling mechanisms mediating the effects of EA pretreatment are unclear.

HIF-1a is a transcription factor that plays a key role in
regulating the adaptive response to hypoxia by regulating the
expression of its target genes, which include heme oxygenase1 (HO-1) (Singh et al. 2012). HIF-1a has been shown to
protect neurons from death during the initial 24 h following
mild hypoxia (Lopez-Hernandez et al. 2012). Previous studies
have shown that the neuroprotection against focal cerebral
ischemia provided by various agents is through the upregulation of HIF-1a (Wang et al. 2012a; Yuan et al. 2011;
Doeppner et al. 2012). Whether HIF-1a acts in a similar
manner after EA neuroprotective pretreatment is unclear.
Our previous study demonstrated that EA pretreatmentinduced tolerance against cerebral ischemia by activating
the canonical Notch signaling pathway. A potential link
between HIF-1a and Notch signaling has been reported
(Wilkins et al. 2009). Additionally, the expression of HIF1a and its downstream target genes requires the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(STAT3), and Notch signaling can activate STAT3 phosphorylation (Jung et al. 2005; Kamakura et al. 2004). Notch
and HIF-1a appear to share several levels of molecular
regulatory mechanisms.
Therefore, the aims of the current study are to test the
hypothesis that the up-regulation of HIF-1a contributes to
the neuroprotective effects of EA pretreatment and to determine whether the neuroprotection induced by the upregulation of HIF-1a is associated with the Notch signaling
pathway.

Materials and Methods
Experimental Protocols
Experiment I
To assess the effect of EA pretreatment on the expression
of HIF-1a and HO-1 after ischemia, the rats were randomly
divided into two groups: Ischemia and reperfusion (I/R)
and EA ? I/R. The animals were subjected to middle
cerebral arterial occlusion (MCAO). The rats in the
EA ? I/R group were given 30 min of EA stimulation per
day for 5 days. At 24 h after the last EA pretreatment and
at 2, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h after reperfusion, RT-PCR and
Western blot analysis were performed (n = 8). At 24 h
after reperfusion, HIF-1a/NeuN double immunofluorescence analyses were performed in the Sham, I/R, and
EA ? I/R groups (n = 8).
Experiment II
To determine the effects of the HIF-1a inhibitor 2ME2 on
the neuroprotection associated with EA pretreatment, rats

123

Cell Mol Neurobiol (2015) 35:1093–1103

were randomly divided into five groups: Sham, I/R,
EA ? I/R, 2ME2 ? I/R, EA ? 2ME2 ? I/R. 2ME2 was
administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection at 30 min
before MCAO in the 2ME2 ? I/R and EA ? 2ME2 ? I/R
groups. At 72 h after reperfusion, neurobehavioral
evaluation and infarct assessment were then performed
(n = 8). At 24 h after reperfusion, TUNEL staining and
both Bcl2 and Bax expressions were tested to measure
neuronal apoptosis (n = 8).
Experiment III
To evaluate the interaction between the Notch signaling
pathway and HIF-1a levels induced by EA pretreatment,
rats were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 8 in each
group): I/R, EA ? I/R, EA ? MW167 ? I/R (c-secretase
inhibitor) and EA ? 2ME2 ? I/R. MW167 was administered by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection 30 min
before MCAO in the EA ? MW167 ? I/R group, and
2ME2 was administered by i.p. injection 30 min before
MCAO in the EA ? 2ME2 ? I/R group. At 24 h after
reperfusion, Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence were performed (n = 8).
Electroacupuncture Pretreatment
The EA pretreatment was performed as described previously (Wang et al. 2009). The ‘‘Baihui (GV 20)’’ acupoint
was used, which, in rats, is located at the intersection of the
sagittal midline and the line linking the two ears. The
animals were anesthetized using 40 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital (SP) (i.p.), and then the acupoint ‘‘Baihui (GV 20)
was stimulated at the intensity of 1 mA and frequency of
2/15 Hz for 30 min per day for five successive days using
the G6805–2 EA Instrument (Model No. 227 033; Qingdao
Xinsheng Ltd).
Drug administration
In experiment II, 2ME2 was dissolved in PBS with 10 %
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and administered by i.p. injection 30 min before MCAO in the 2ME2 ? I/R and
EA ? 2ME2 ? I/R groups. The same volume of vehicle
(10 % DMSO in PBS) was administered by i.p. injection
30 min before MCAO in Sham, I/R, and EA ? I/R groups.
The 2ME2 dose (16 mg/kg) was consistent with previously
published in vivo doses (Zhou et al. 2008). In experiment
III, MW167 was dissolved in PBS with 10 % DMSO and
used at a concentration of 1 mM (Jurynczyk et al. 2005),
which was administered by i.c.v. injection 30 min before
MCAO in the EA ? MW167 ? I/R group. The same
volume of vehicle(10 % DMSO in PBS) was administered
by i.c.v. injection 30 min before MCAO in I/R, EA ? I/R,

Cell Mol Neurobiol (2015) 35:1093–1103

and EA ? 2ME2 ? I/R groups. The i.c.v. injection was
performed as described previously (Zhao et al. 2012).
2ME2 was dissolved in PBS with 10 % dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and administered by i.p. injection 30 min before
MCAO in EA ? 2ME2 ? I/R group. The same volume of
vehicle (10 % DMSO in PBS) was administered by i.p.
injection 30 min before MCAO in I/R, EA ? I/R, and
EA ? MW167 ? I/R groups. The stereotactic coordinates
were as follows: A, -1.0; R, 1.5; and H, 3.8 (coordinates
corresponding to the right lateral ventricle) (Paxinos et al.
1980).
Transient Focal Cerebral Ischemia
Animal Care: The animals were provided by the Experimental Animal Center of the Fourth Military Medical
University (Xi’an, China). Male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats
weighing 260–300 g were housed in a specific pathogenfree environment with free access to sterile laboratory
pellets and water. The experimental protocol was approved
by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation of
the Fourth Military Medical University and was conducted
according to the Guidelines for Animal Experimentation of
the Fourth Military Medical University.
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by a transient right
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats as described previously (Wang et al. 2012b). Animals were
anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 40 mg/kg SP
for all surgical procedures. The regional cerebral blood
flow (rCBF) was monitored using a disposable microtip
fiber optic probe (diameter, 0.5 mm) connected through a
master probe to a computerized laser Doppler main unit
(PeriFlux 5000, Perimed AB, Sweden). Rats retaining
[20 % of baseline perfusion during ischemia were excluded. Reperfusion was accomplished by withdrawing the
suture after 120 min of ischemia, followed by suturing of
the surgical wounds. The temporalis muscle temperature
was monitored and maintained at 37.0–37.5 °C by surface
heating or cooling during surgery until the rats recovered
from anesthesia.
Real-Time PCR
The ischemic penumbras of the cerebral cortex were harvested as described previously (Wei et al. 2014). PCR was
performed under the following thermal cycling conditions:
one cycle at 94 °C for 5 min; 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s,
55 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 30 s and one cycle at 72 °C
for 10 min. Melt-curve analysis was used to identify different reaction products, including nonspecific products.
The following primers for RT-PCR were designed by the
TaKaRa corporation: HIF-1a (Fwd: CCA GAT TCA AGA
TCA GCC AGC A, Rev: GCT GTC CAC ATC AAA GCA

1095

GTA CTC A), HO-1 (Fwd: AGG TGC ACA TCC GTG
CAG AG, Rev: CTT CCA GGG CCG TAT AGA TAT
GGT A), and GAPDH (Fwd: GGC ACA GTC AAG GCT
GAG AAT G, Rev: ATG GTG GTG AAG ACG CCA
GTA). Each sample was tested in triplicate. Samples were
obtained from 3 independent experiments and analyzed for
relative gene expression data using the 2-DDCT method.
Western Blot
At 24 h after the last EA pretreatment and at 2, 6, 24, 48,
and 72 h after reperfusion, HIF-1a expression in the ischemic penumbra of rats in Experiment I was evaluated. At
24 h after reperfusion, the Bcl2 and Bax expression in the
ischemic penumbra of rats in Experiment II was evaluated.
At 24 h after reperfusion, NICD and HIF-1a expression
was measured in the rats in Experiment III as described
previously (Deng et al. 2013, 2014). The following primary
antibodies were used: mouse anti-HIF-1a (1:400, Novus
Biologicals), mouse anti-Bcl2 (1:200, Aobo), mouse antiBax (1:200, Aobo), rabbit anti-Notch1 NICD (1:400;
Abcam), and mouse anti-beta-actin antibody (1:1000,
Abcam). Secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated goat–anti-rabbit antibody or goat–anti-mouse antibody (Pierce Biotechnology Inc; 1:5000 dilution) was used.
Changes in relative protein expression were represented as
the ratio of the integrated optical density of the protein
bands to that of b-actin. Quantitative analysis of the protein
bands was performed using an Image-Quant 5.0 GE
Healthcare Densitometer (GE Healthcare, Sunnyvale,
CA). The experiments were performed independently in
triplicate.
Double Immunofluorescence Staining
HIF-1a/NeuN double immunofluorescence analyses were
performed in the Sham, CON, and EA groups. Monoclonal
mouse anti-HIF-1a (1:200, Novus Biologicals) and polyclonal rabbit anti-NeuN (1:1000, Millipore) were used.
HIF-1a/Notch1 NICD double immunofluorescence analyses of the CON and EA groups were then performed. The
secondary antibody used was FITC-labeled goat antimouse IgG (1:2000; Molecular Probes, USA) and Alexa
Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1 000; Molecular
Probes, USA). Finally, sections were observed, and images
were captured using an Olympus BX-60 fluorescence microscope (Olympus Corporation, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan)
with software named QCapture Pro.
TUNEL Staining

groups from Experiment II was performed using an In Situ
Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany) as described previously(Wang et al. 2013) and
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Images were
viewed using an Olympus BX-60 fluorescence microscope.
Integrated optical density/area of positive TUNEL staining
in each group was measured by 2 blinded investigators
using Image-Pro plus 5.1 software (Media Cybernetics,
Inc., Bethesda, MD, USA).
Neurobehavioral Evaluation and Infarct Volume
Assessment
At 72 h after reperfusion, a neurological assessment of the
rats in Sham, I/R, EA ? I/R, 2ME2 ? I/R, EA ? 2ME2 ?
I/R groups was performed by a blinded observer using the
18-point scoring system reported by Garcia et al. (1995).
The system consisted of the following six tests: (1) spontaneous activity, (2) symmetry in the movement of four
limbs, (3) forepaw outstretching, (4) climbing, (5) body
proprioception, and (6) response to vibrissae touch. The
score given to each rat at the completion of the evaluation
was the summation of all six individual test scores. Minimum neurologic score was 3; maximum was 18.
After neurological evaluation, rats were decapitated, and
2-mm thick coronal sections throughout the brain were
stained with 2 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)
to evaluate the infarct volume as described previously(Zhou et al. 2013). The areas of injured (white) and uninjured (red) were measured using an image analysis
system (Adobe Photoshop 8.0, Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jose, CA) for each slice. Infarct volume was
calculated by Swanson and Sharp’s method to correct for
edema: 1009 (contralateral hemisphere volume—nonlesioned ipsilateral hemisphere volume)/contralateral hemisphere volume (Swanson and Sharp 1994).
Statistical Analysis
SPSS 11.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used.
The HIF-1a and HO-1 mRNA levels, HIF-1a, Bcl2, Bax
and NICD levels and infarct volumes were analyzed using
one-way analysis of variance, and differences between the
groups were detected using the post hoc Student–Newman–
Keuls test. Each neurological deficit score was expressed as
a median (range) and analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis test
followed by Dunn’s post hoc test. Other values were reported as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) and
analyzed among groups using one-way analysis of variance.
When indicated by a significant F ratio, post hoc testing was
performed using Scheffe’s test. Values of p \ 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

Results
EA Pretreatment Significantly Enhanced HIF-1a
and HO-1 Expression in the Ischemic Penumbra
at the Early Stage of Reperfusion
Expression of the HIF-1a and HO-1 genes in the ischemic
penumbra was examined at the early stage of reperfusion.
HO-1 is one of the downstream genes regulated by HIF-1a.
The HIF-1a and HO-1 mRNA expression levels were
significantly higher in EA ? I/R group than in I/R group at
2, 6, and 24 h after reperfusion (p \ 0.05). However, the
expression levels of HIF-1a and HO-1 mRNA were significantly lower in EA ? I/R group than in I/R group at 48
and 72 h after reperfusion (p \ 0.05) (Fig. 1b/c).
Semi-quantitative Western blot analysis indicated that
HIF-1a was significantly elevated at 2 h after reperfusion
in EA ? I/R group (p \ 0.05 vs. before I/R) and reached
the maximum level at 48 h after reperfusion. Furthermore,
the level of HIF-1a in the EA ? I/R group was significantly higher than in I/R group (p \ 0.05) at 2, 6, 24, or
48 h (Fig. 1d, e).
We also evaluated whether neurons in the ischemic
penumbra region expressed HIF-1a. The results indicated
that there were more HIF-1a- and NeuN-positive cells in
EA ? I/R group than in I/R group 24 h after reperfusion.
Furthermore, the number of HIF-1a/NeuN double-labeled
neurons in EA ? I/R group was significantly higher than in
I/R group 24 h after reperfusion (Fig. 2). These results
suggested that EA pretreatment increased the expression of
HIF-1a and HO-1 in the ischemic penumbra at the early
stage of reperfusion.
HIF-1a Inhibitor 2ME2 Attenuated
the Neuroprotective Effect of EA Pretreatment
Neurological function was assessed using Garcia scores. At
72 h after reperfusion, rats receiving EA pretreatment
showed significantly higher neurological function scores
than those in I/R group (p \ 0.05). However, the neurological function scores in the group given EA pretreatment
with 2ME2 were significantly lower than in the group
pretreated with EA alone (Fig. 3a).
At 72 h after reperfusion, the brain infarct volumes in
EA ? I/R group were significantly smaller than those in
I/R group (p \ 0.05). Interestingly, the infarct volumes in
EA ? 2ME2 ? I/R group were significantly larger than
those in EA ? I/R group (p \ 0.05). There was no difference between the I/R group and the group subjected to
only 2ME2 (Fig. 3b, c). These results suggested that the
neuroprotective effect induced by EA pretreatment can be
alleviated by 2ME2 intervention.

To assess the effect of 2ME2 on neuronal apoptosis,
TUNEL staining on ischemic brain sections at 24 h after
reperfusion was performed. There were more TUNELpositive cells in the ischemic penumbras from the I/R and
EA ? 2ME2 ? I/R groups than from the EA ? I/R group
(p \ 0.05) 24 h after reperfusion (Fig. 4b, c, e). These

results indicated that the EA pretreatment-induced reduction of neuronal apoptosis was attenuated by 2ME2.
We also assayed the expressions of the Bax and Bcl-2
proteins 24 h after reperfusion. As shown in Fig. 3g–i, rats
only subjected to the EA pretreatment showed markedly
up-regulated Bcl-2 levels (p \ 0.05 vs. I/R) in the ischemic

penumbra 24 h after reperfusion, whereas the Bcl-2 protein
levels in the ischemic penumbra in EA ? 2ME2 ? I/R
group were significantly lower than those in EA ? I/R
group (p \ 0.05) (Fig. 4g/h/i). Meanwhile, the up-regulation of Bax in the ischemic penumbra was markedly reduced by the EA pretreatment (p \ 0.05 vs. I/R).
Interaction Between the Notch Signaling Pathway
and HIF-1a
As shown in Fig. 5b–e, there were significantly more HIF1a- or NICD-positive cells in the ischemic penumbra in
EA ? I/R group than in I/R group (p \ 0.05) 24 h after
reperfusion. Furthermore, there were more HIF-1a/NICD
double-labeled cells in the ischemic penumbra in EA ? I/R
group than in I/R group (p \ 0.05) 24 h after reperfusion.

123

These results indicated that HIF-1a and Notch1NICD were
co-expressed in the ischemic penumbra.
To explore the relationship between the Notch signaling
pathway and HIF-1a, we evaluated the expression of HIF-1a
and NICD after the Notch signal was inhibited. As shown in
Fig. 5f, g, the amount of HIF-1a and NICD in the ischemic
penumbra of EA ? I/R group was significantly higher than that
in I/R group (p \ 0.05) 24 h after reperfusion. However,
MW167, which can inhibit the activation of the Notch signaling
pathway, decreased the expressions of both HIF-1a and NICD
(p \ 0.05, EA ? MW167 ? I/R vs. EA ? I/R). Furthermore,
2ME2 inhibited HIF-1a expression (p \ 0.05, EA ? 2ME2 ?
I/R vs. EA ? I/R) but had no effect on the expression of NICD
(p [ 0.05, EA ? 2ME2 ? I/R vs. EA ? I/R). These results
suggested that inhibition of the Notch signal suppressed the
expression of HIF-1a in the ischemic penumbra.

before MCAO, the 2ME2 were administered. At 72 h after ischemia/
reperfusion, neurological function scores, and infarct volumes were
assessed in every group. At 24 h after ischemia/reperfusion, TUNEL
staining, the expression of Bcl2 and Bax was tested to evaluate
neuronal apoptosis in every group

Discussion

mRNA transcription or the stability of the HIF-1a protein
(Baranova et al. 2007). 2ME2 is a natural metabolite of
estrogen that is known to inhibit HIF-1a in a dose-dependent manner (Ricker et al. 2004). The dose (16 mg/kg) of
2ME2 can effectively inhibit the expression of HIF-1a and
its target gene, VEGF(Zhou et al. 2008; Zhu et al. 2014).
The administration of 2ME2 attenuated the beneficial effects of EA on infarct volumes, neurological outcomes, and
apoptosis. These results suggest that the up-regulation of
HIF-1a may contribute to the neuroprotective effects of EA
pretreatment against focal ischemia. Certainly, 2ME2 has
other features, such as anti-tumor, anti-angiogenesis, anticytotoxicity, and anti-proliferation. These features may
have some effect on our research.
Apoptosis is one of the major causes of neuronal injury
following cerebral ischemia, and the inhibition of apoptosis
reduces ischemic injury. HIF-1a is a transcription factor
that plays a key role in regulating the adaptive response to
hypoxia and is involved in regulating apoptosis under hypoxic conditions. Increasing HIF-1a protein stability

In the present study, we found that EA pretreatment significantly increased HIF-1a expression in the ischemic
penumbra following reperfusion. In addition, immunofluorescence staining suggested that HIF-1a immunoreactivity
was
colocalized
with
NeuN
immunoreactivity, indicating that the effect of EA pretreatment on HIF-1a expression may be neuron-specific.
Baranova et al. reported that the neuron-specific inactivation of HIF-1a increased brain injury in a mouse model of
transient focal cerebral ischemia (Baranova et al. 2007). A
research showed that sevoflurane postconditioning protected the brain from focal cerebral ischemic reperfusion
injury through up-regulating mRNA and protein expression
of HIF-1a and its target gene, HO-1 (Ye et al. 2012). To
address whether HIF-1a played a neuroprotective role in
EA pretreatment after reperfusion, we inhibited HIF-1a
expression using 2ME2, which selectively suppressed cellular HIF-1a protein synthesis without affecting HIF-1a

reduces brain injury after transient cerebral ischemia
(Kunze et al. 2012). We found that EA pretreatment significantly reduced the number of apoptotic neurons, upregulated the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and downregulated the pro-apoptotic protein of Bax in the ischemic
penumbra, suggesting that EA pretreatment alleviates

neuronal apoptosis. Yang et al. reported that Panaxynol
protected cortical neurons from ischemia-like injury by upregulation of HIF-1a expression and inhibition of apoptotic
cascade (Yang et al. 2010). However, how HIF-1a exerts
its neuroprotective effects after EA administered remains
investigation.

It is still controversial whether the activated canonical
Notch signaling is beneficial to the ischemic cerebral tissues.
Many researchers have found that the activation of Notch
signaling was involved in the ischemic tolerance induced by
inhalation anesthetics preconditioning (Zhang et al. 2014;
Yang et al. 2012). However, other reports was consistent
with the opinion that Notch signaling can induce neuronal
cell death (Arumugam et al. 2011). The discrepancies might
be explained by the injury model, the severity of injury and
the timepoint of notch inhibition. In our past work, we found
that EA pretreatment-induced tolerance against focal cerebral ischemia through activation of the canonical Notch
signaling pathway (Zhao et al. 2012). Notch signaling and
the cellular hypoxic response have been shown to be functionally integrated (Gustafsson et al. 2005; Kamarehei and
Yazdanparast 2014). Zheng et al. reported that FIH-1 played
a role in mediating hypoxia-potentiated Notch signaling,
suggesting that Notch ICD could sequester FIH-1 from HIF1a, thus decreasing HIF-1a function (Zheng et al. 2008). Lee
JH et al. found that the transcription of HIF-1a gene was upregulated by the induction of Notch signaling under hypoxic
conditions (Lee et al. 2009). Our results also indicated the
inhibition of the Notch signal suppressed HIF-1a expression

in the ischemic penumbra, whereas HIF-1a inhibition had no
effect on NICD expression. These results suggest that the upregulation of HIF-1a during the EA pretreatment is mediated
by the activation of the Notch pathway. However, our results
do not agree with a recent report by Cheng et al. showing that
the NICD and HIF-1a collaborated to engage pro-inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathways in stroke (Cheng
et al. 2014). The discrepancies might be explained by the
different levels of HIF-1a expression in the ischemic
penumbra after focal cerebral ischemia, because HIF coordinated both cell survival and death mechanisms. The research of Cheng focused on the expression and function of
NICD and HIF-1a in ischemic stroke, while our focus was
the benefit of up-regulation of NICD and HIF-1a expression
induced by EA pretreatment in the focal cerebral ischemic
injury. Besides, the time of MCAO in Cheng’ research was
much less than that in our research.
In summary, the current investigation indicates that EA
pretreatment affords strong protection against transient
cerebral ischemic injury and increases the protein expression and activation of HIF-1a in rats. The beneficial effects
of EA pretreatment may be mediated by the activation of
the Notch signaling pathway.
