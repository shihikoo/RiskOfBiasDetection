a b s t r a c t
Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a potential therapeutic protein on a variety of central
nervous system diseases including ischemic stroke. However, GDNF is a large molecule that cannot cross
the blood–brain barrier (BBB), which is still intact in the early hours after stroke when neural rescue
is possible. PEP-1 protein transduction domain can deliver protein cargo across the cell membrane and
the BBB. In the present study, we generated a novel fusion protein PEP-1-GDNF and examined whether
PEP-1-GDNF is protective in focal cerebral ischemia. PEP-1-GDNF (200 ␮g/kg) or PBS was intravenously
applied over 5 min immediately after reperfusion of 90 min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO). After 28 days, rats were deeply anesthetized and decapitated. Behavioral tests were performed
during this period. The results showed that PEP-1-GDNF signiﬁcantly reduced the infarct volume and
improved behavioral function. Further, PEP-1-GDNF promoted the cell proliferation and differentiation
in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and attenuated ischemia-induced learning and memory damage.

1. Introduction
Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has potent
neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke via different delivery
approaches [1]. For example, topical application of GDNF can
decrease brain edema, attenuate apoptotic cells, and reduce the

infarct volume after stroke [2,3]. In addition, elevated GDNF level
by gene transfer can reduce the infarct size and improve behavioral
function in a rat MCAO model [4]. Further, transplantation of neural stem and progenitor cells modiﬁed to secrete GDNF signiﬁcantly
increases the level of GDNF in the brain and promotes the migration
and differentiation of the stem cells [5]. Stroke initiates damage
to the brain and impairs neurological function; however, stroke
also induces several endogenous protective mechanisms, such as
neurogenesis, which in turn limits tissue damage and promotes
plasticity [6]. Neurogenesis mainly occurs in the dentate gyrus (DG)
of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) of lateral
ventricles. Particularly, reports suggest that neurogenesis is linked
with learning and memory processes in the hippocampus [7,8].
Interestingly, GDNF-family receptor␣-1 (GFR␣-1) is up-regulated
in CA3 and the DG of the hippocampus after stroke, suggesting

Y. Liu et al. / Neuroscience Letters 617 (2016) 150–155

that GDNF has an important role in the neurogenesis following
stroke [9]. Indeed, GDNF has been reported to promote the cellular proliferation, survival, and differentiation of progenitor cells in
the hippocampus [10,11]. Although GDNF has potent neuroprotective effects, it is limited for clinical application because of a lack of
an efﬁcient and noninvasive method to delivery GDNF across the
blood–brain barrier (BBB). To overcome this problem, GDNF has
been linked to the protein transduction domain (PTD) as a fusion
protein, which enables it to cross cell membranes and the BBB [12].
PTDs are small peptides (typically 5–25 amino acids), which are
used to deliver the normally impermeable cargo across the cell
membrane and the BBB through systemic administration. Some
PTDs have been used in experiments or clinical trials [13]. PEP-1,
a kind of PTDs, has successfully delivered multiple nonpenetrating
therapeutic proteins into the brain by intravenous administration
[14–17].
In the present study, we generated a novel fusion protein
PEP-1-GDNF and investigated whether intravenous PEP-1-GDNF
was protective after ischemic stroke in rats. The results revealed
that intravenous administration of PEP-1-GDNF at the starting
of reperfusion was neuroprotective. The PEP-1-GDNF group displayed signiﬁcantly smaller infarct volume compared with the PBS
control group. In addition, PEP-1-GDNF-treated rats performed signiﬁcantly better in the cylinder test and Morris water maze. Further,
PEP-1-GDNF promoted the cell proliferation and differentiation in
the hippocampus of ischemic brain.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Expression and puriﬁcation of recombinant PEP-1-GDNF
fusion protein
The
PEP-1-GDNF
coding
sequence
was
polymerase chain reaction ampliﬁed by use of primers:
5 -tcgagctcaggaggaaacgccatggagaaagaaacctggtgggaaacctggtggaccg-3
and
5 -cctggtggaccgaatggtctcagccgaaaaaaaaacgtaaagtgtcaccagataaacaaa-tgg-3 for 5 -terminue, and
primer 5 -tcaagcttcagatacatccacaccttt-3 for 3 -terminue (96 ◦ C for
3 min, 97 ◦ C for 30 s, 59 ◦ C for 30 s, and 72 ◦ C for 31 s for 35 cycles;
72 ◦ C for 7 min). Puriﬁed polymerase chain reaction fragments
were cloned into the Not1/Bamh1 sites of the pPET-45b vector.
PEP-1-GDNF was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3)
pLysS (Novagen) and lysed by sonication. The E. coli lysate was
denatured in 8 mol/L urea; the bacterial debris was pelleted; and
the supernatant was subjected to metal-afﬁnity chromatography
using a Ni-NTA matrix (Qiagen). Salts were removed by gel ﬁltration on Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The
identity of the protein was conﬁrmed by Western blotting, and the
protein concentration was estimated with the Bradford method,
using bovine serum albumin (BSA, 2 mg/ml) as a standard.
2.2. Animals and surgery
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250–280 g were purchased from the Center for Experimental Animals of Guangzhou
University of Chinese Medicine (Guangzhou, China) and maintained at a speciﬁc pathogen-free housing facility. All procedures
performed on these animals were approved by the Institutional
Animal Ethical Committee at Sun Yat-Sen University and were in
accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals of the National Institute of Health (Publication No. 80-23,
revised 1996).
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced
by the intraluminal ﬁlament technique, as described in our previous report [18]. Brieﬂy, under anesthesia with chloral hydrate

151

(350 mg/kg, i.p.), a midline neck incision was made, and the right
common carotid artery (CCA), the internal carotid artery (ICA), and
the external carotid artery (ECA) were exposed. After ligation of
the ECA and the proximal CCA, an MCAO monoﬁlament was gently
inserted into the ICA through the CCA until it blocked the bifurcating origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The ﬁlament was
withdrawn, initiating reperfusion after 90 min of MCA occlusion.
2.3. Treatment
Immediately after reperfusion, rats were randomly divided into
two groups: the PEP-1-GDNF treatment group (N = 10) and the PBS
control group (N = 8). PEP-1-GDNF (200 ␮g/kg) was slowly injected
via tail vein within 5 min according to the previous report [19].
The control group received equal volume of PBS. To evaluate the
cell proliferation, all rats received BrdU (50 mg/kg, i.p. daily) for
successive 2 weeks starting 24 h after reperfusion.
2.4. Cylinder test
The cylinder test was performed at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after
drug treatment to assess asymmetric forelimb use. Brieﬂy, the rats
were placed inside a clear glass cylinder (Ø 20 cm). In total, 20 wall
placements of the right forelimb (R), left forelimb (L), and both forelimbs simultaneously (S) were recorded [20]. Finally, the parameter
was calculated as Limb Use Asymmetry Score = (R−L)/(R + L + S)
[21].
2.5. Morris water maze
This test was chosen to evaluate spatial learning and memory of
rats after reperfusion according to previous reports [22,23]. Brieﬂy,
from 21 to 27 days after stroke, rats were allowed to swim in a 1.3m diameter pool ﬁlled with water for 60 s to search for the platform
submerged under 1.5 cm of the water surface. Rats that located the
platform were allowed to remain on it for 10 s, and rats that did not
reach the platform during 60 s were gently guided to the platform
and located on it for 10 s. The mean time that rats spent in the water
during three attempts each day was collected to investigate the
spatial learning. The probe trial was performed for each animal at
day 28 of the experiment. In this trial, the platform was removed,
and each animal was allowed to search for the platform for 60 s
in the water at a predetermined location. Time spent in the goal
quadrant was calculated to evaluate how well rats remembered
the location of the platform.
2.6. Infarct volume calculation
At 28 days after surgery, all rats were sacriﬁced under deep anesthesia. The rats were transcardially perfused with saline, followed
by 4% paraformaldehyde. Five coronal brain sections of 20 um thickness with equal space (2 mm apart, between −5.80 and +2.20 mm
from Bregma; based on the Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates of
Paxinos and Watson 2005) were prepared. Then the sections were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE), and the infarct volume
was calculated as a percentage of the area of the contralateral hemisphere, and multiplied by the distance between sections to obtain
the respective volume as reported previously [24,25].
2.7. Immunohistochemistry
Fluorescence double staining was used for visualization of BrdU
and Nestin, GFAP, or NeuN, according to the protocol reported elsewhere [26]. In brief, series of every ﬁfth section (150 ␮m apart)
through each hippocampus were processed. Sections were incubated in 2 N HCl for 30 min at 37 ◦ C and rinsed in 0.1 M borate

buffer for 10 min (pH 8.5). Following blocking in TBS with 0.3%
Triton X-100 and 10% normal goat serum, sections were incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 ◦ C. Sections were
then washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with the secondary
antibodies at room temperature for 1 h, followed by washing 3
times with PBS. Antibodies and their concentrations were as follows: anti-BrdU antibody (1:300, rat, Abcam), anti-Nestin antibody
(1:200, mouse, Millipore), anti-NeuN antibody (1:200, mouse, Millipore), or anti-GFAP antibody (1:300, rabbit, Sigma), anti-rat IgG
555 (1:500, Life), anti-mouse IgG 488 (1:500, Cell Signaling), and

results were expressed as percentages of total BrdU-labeled cells.

2.8. Cell counting

Western blot analysis showed the PEP-1-GDNF fusion protein
was highly puriﬁed (Fig. 1A). The infarct volume measured by HE
staining is shown (Fig. 1B and C). Quantitative evaluation revealed
a signiﬁcant reduction in infarct volume in rats receiving PEP1-GDNF compared with the control group after MCAO (Fig. 1D,
25.00 ± 4.13% vs. 38.20 ± 2.13%, P < 0.05).

Sections were viewed on an Olympus BX51 microscope with
Nikon digital camera, and the images were visualized on a computer monitor. Cell numbers were analyzed with the ImageJ
software. For BrdU staining, results were presented as the aver-

of BrdU and GFAP double-staining cells was detected between the two groups (G). Values are means ± SEM, **P < 0.01.

3.2. PEP-1-GDNF improved the neurological functions
PEP-1-GDNF-treated animals showed a much better progressive recovery of the impaired limb in the cylinder test at 21 and
28 days after stroke compared with PBS-treated animals (Fig. 2A).
Limb Use Asymmetry Scores were 0.46 ± 0.11, 0.36 ± 0.11 for PEP1-GDNF-treated rats and 0.80 ± 0.82, 0.76 ± 0.12 for PBS-treated
rats at 21 and 28 days, respectively (all P < 0.05). PEP-1-GDNFtreated rats took signiﬁcantly less time than PBS-treated rats did
to ﬁnd the hidden platform from day 3 to day 6 of learning trials.
The time of PEP-1-GDNF and PBS group were: 32.63 ± 4.23 s and
50.68 ± 3.53 s at day 3 (P < 0.05); 23.02 ± 3.44 s and 42.87 ± 5.54 s at
day 4 (P < 0.05); 17.24 ± 4.23 s and 36.90 ± 6.65 s at day 5 (P < 0.05);
and 14.86 ± 3.54 and 33.01 ± 5.64 at day 6 (P < 0.05), respectively
(Fig. 2B). Moreover, the memory trials revealed that PEP-1-GDNFtreated rats spent signiﬁcantly more time in the platform quadrant
than PBS-treated rats did at 28 days (Fig. 2C, 24.47 ± 1.86 vs.
16.51 ± 1.87, P < 0.05).

3.3. PEP-1-GDNF promoted the cell proliferation and
differentiation in the DG
To determine whether PEP-1-GDNF affected the neurogenesis in the DG, BrdU was used to label dividing cells (Fig. 3A
and B). BrdU/NeuN and BrdU/GFAP double staining were used
to evaluate the differentiation of the new cells (Fig. 3C and D).
Quantiﬁcation of BrdU incorporated cells in the ipsilateral DG
revealed that the number of cells labeled with BrdU was signiﬁcantly higher in the DG of PEP-GDNF-treated rats than in the PBS
control rats (Fig. 3E, 42.13 ± 2.34 and 22.00 ± 3.52, p < 0.01). Moreover, the number of BrdU and NeuN co-labeled cells in the DG of
the PEP-1-GDNF-treated group was signiﬁcantly higher compared
with the PBS-treated group (Fig. 3F, 60 ± 3.20% and 20.64 ± 3.89%,
P < 0.01). There was no difference in BrdU and GFAP double-staining
cells between these two groups (27.34 ± 3.10% and 20.92 ± 2.35%,
P > 0.05). There were no BrdU-positive cells co-labeled with Nestin
in the either group (data not shown).

4. Discussion

References

It has been well documented that GDNF decreases infarct
volume in stroke through topical, intracerebral, or intracerebroventricular administration [3,4,27–29]. However, therapeutic beneﬁts
of intravenous GDNF are limited because of its poor permeability [20]. The present study demonstrated a signiﬁcant reduction of
infarct size by intravenous treatment of PEP-1-GDNF immediately
after 90 min MCAO, suggesting a therapeutic potential of PEP-1GDNF for treatment of stroke.
Neurogenesis is important for the recovery in stroke. The hippocampal neurons, which play an important role in learning and
memory processes, are vulnerable to neuronal injury induced by
ischemia [30]. It is believed that GDNF is crucial for the restoration
of ischemia-induced learning and memory impairment. For example, increased level of GDNF is associated with improved water
maze performance in rats [31]. In addition, impaired water maze
performance occurs in mice with decreased GDNF gene expression
[32] and mice lacking the GFRa-2 receptor [33]. We found that the
ipsilateral DG of the hippocampus had a signiﬁcantly higher number of BrdU+ cells in the PEP-1-GDNF group compared with the
PBS control group. Interestingly, the majority of the BrdU+ cells
also expressed the neuron marker NeuN at 28 days after stroke,
indicating that the newly divided cells differentiated to mature
neurons. Correspondingly, PEP-1-GDNF treated animals had much
better performance in the Maze water test compared with controls.
Thus, the present data suggests that the effects of GDNF on neurogenesis in the hippocampus can facilitate the recovery of learning
and memory processes after stroke.
The present data showed that PEP-1-GDNF signiﬁcantly promoted the cell proliferation and differentiation to neurons but not
to astrocytes (Fig. 3F and G). This ﬁnding is in agreement with a
previous study reporting that intrastriatal infusion of GDNF significantly enhances the proliferated cells mature to neurons in the
hippocampus after MCAO [11]. We found no Nestin-positive cells
in the DG at 28 days after reperfusion in either group. Similarly,
a previous study also suggests that ischemic stroke facilitates the
cell proliferation, the new cells in the DG mainly formed in the ﬁrst
week but survived until the end of third week, and intracerebroventricular infusion of GDNF further promoted the effect [9].
In conclusion, the present study revealed that PEP-1-GDNF was
neuroprotective by systematic administration after stroke. PEP-1GDNF signiﬁcantly decreased the infarct volume and promoted
the recovery of behavior function of rats with ischemic stroke.
Moreover, PEP-1-GDNF enhanced the cell proliferation and differentiation in the DG of the hippocampus, which was associated
with the improvement of the learning and memory impairment
after stroke. Our study suggests that PEP-1-GDNF is a promising
treatment for ischemic stroke. However, there is a limitation in
our study. We did not show that the PEP-1-GDNF actually reached
the brain or the region around the infarcted area after intravenous
administration. This is an important detail that we will investigate
in future work.
