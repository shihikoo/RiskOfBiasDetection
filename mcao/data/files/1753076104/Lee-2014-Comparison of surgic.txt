ABSTRACT.	

Rodent models of focal cerebral ischemia that do not require craniotomy have been developed by intraluminal suture middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Mouse MCAo models have been widely used and extended to genetic studies of cell death or recovery
mechanisms. Therefore, we compared surgery-related parameters and techniques between such rats and mice. In rodent MCAo models, has
to be considered body temperature during the operative period, as well as the need for the use of a standardized tip in terms of the outer
diameter of probes. Induction of focal cerebral ischemia was measured by neurological dysfunction parameters. Our methods could induce
stable moderate-severity ischemic brain injury models and histological alteration at 24 hr after MCAo surgery. Moreover approximately
80% (rats) and 85% (mice) survival ratios were shown indicating with model engineering success. Finally, we described and compared
major parameters between rats and mice, including probe size, thread insert length, operation and occlusion periods, and differences in the
procedures.

Cerebral ischemia-related research has been extensively
used rodents with various methods, including vessel occlusion, hypotension and hypovolemia [4, 14]. In order to
investigate the mechanisms underlying the injury after ischemic brain injury as well as to exploit effective therapeutic
approaches for the disease, several ischemic stroke models
have been developed in a variety of species, including rodents, canines, rabbits, cats and primates [1]. Experimental
stroke research commonly employs focal cerebral ischemic
rat models. Most investigators utilize permanent or transient
occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in mice or
rats [8]. In general, there are two major types of animal
model of ischemic brain injury: (1) global cerebral ischemia
[2, 24] and (2) focal cerebral ischemia [18]. Ischemic stroke
in humans typically results from thrombotic or embolic
occlusion in a major cerebral artery, most often the MCA,
so experimental focal cerebral ischemia models have been
exploited to mimic human stroke [7]. Rodent models of focal
cerebral ischemia that do not require craniotomy have been
developed by intraluminal suture MCAo [22]. Furthermore,

mouse MCAo models have been widely used and extended
to genetic studies of cell death or recovery mechanisms [13].
Genetically engineered mouse stroke models are particularly
useful for ischemic pathophysiology and in designing potential new prophylactic, neuroprotective and therapeutic agents
and interventions [2]. In the past 2 decades, MCAo surgery
techniques have been developed in rodent models that are
not easy to extend to mouse MCAo models. Previous studies
have suggested detailed methods for rodent MCAo model
engineering, which involved a variety of standards, such as
in terms of filament size, tip outer diameter, insert length of
probe and occlusion period [19, 25, 27]. Moreover, several
studies suggested that rodent strains should be considered
for transient MCAo model engineering [15, 16, 28]. Thus,
ischemic stroke-related researchers have required a standard
method for rodent MCAo model engineering.
Therefore, we established a procedure of mouse MCAo
model engineering compared with a rat MCAo model using
histological staining and behavioral measurement for neurological severity analysis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and pre-operative care: All animal procedures
were approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Care
and Use at Inje University (Approval No. 2012–29). A total
of 47 healthy adult male rats, weighing 240–260 g, and 37
mice, weighing 20–25 g, were subjected to transient MCAo
surgery. All animals were individually housed in plastic
cages at controlled temperature (22 ± 1°C), relative humid-

ity (55 ± 10%) and photoperiod (light/dark conditions 12/12
hr lights on 7:00 a.m.). Food and water were available ad
libitum.
Preparations of middle cerebral artery occlusion microsurgery: MCAo surgery required 4–0 and 6–0 nylon threads
(AILEE Co., Busan, Korea) in rats and mice, respectively.
The nylon thread was cut into 4 cm (for rats) or 2 cm (for
mice) pieces, and its tips were blunted to form a bulb shape
by heating (outer diameter of bulb shape or corn dog form:
0.4–0.45 mm for rats and 0.15–0.18 mm for mice) [10].
Microsurgical procedures of middle cerebral artery occlusion: All animals were anesthetized with 40 mg/kg tiletamine/zolazepam cocktail (Zoletil) and 10 mg/kg xylazine
(Rompun) via intraperitoneal injection. After anesthesia,
the animals’ body temperature was maintained at 36.5°C to
37.0°C using a heating pad on the surgical table. The animals
were placed in the supine position and fixed to the surgical
table using adhesive tape. The incision region was disinfected with povidone-iodine solution. The midline neck skin
was incised, and the common carotid artery (CCA), external
carotid artery (ECA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) were
carefully separated from the vagus nerve. The ICA bifurcates
into the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the pterygopalatine artery (PPA) from the CCA. The occipital artery (OA)
originates from the bifurcation point of the ECA and the
ICA. A transient knot was placed on the distal portion of the
CCA, near the manubrium of the sternum. A microvascular
clamp was transiently placed on the ICA proximal to the
CCA junction. Two closely spaced permanent knots were
then placed on the distal portion of the ECA, below the
suprathyroid artery, to prevent the backflow of blood. The
tied section of the ECA was dissected using microscissors
to insert the probe, which reached the ICA through the CCA
junction. The microvascular clamp that had been placed on

the ICA was then removed to allow probe insertion. The
probe was carefully inserted into the MCA from the CCA
junction (up to 18–20 mm in rats and 9–11 mm in mice).
After confirmation of MCA blockage (mild bending of the
ICA), the rat model exhibited blood supply from the CCA,
but the mouse model only exhibited blood supply after the
occlusion period (dual occlusion by CCA ligation). After 60
to 90 min, the probe was carefully withdrawn until the tip
was near the arteriotomy for reperfusion. After confirmation
of blood flow reperfusion, topical lidocaine gel was applied
onto the surgical region to relieve pain and discomfort in the
postoperative period. Each animal also received 1.0 ml of
normal saline subcutaneously for volume replenishment after the surgery. All surgical procedures were finished within
15 min, excluding the occlusion and reperfusion periods
(Fig. 1A).
Measurements of neurological dysfunction in rats and
mice followed by MCAo: The battery of rat MCAo model
tests consisted of evaluation of the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) [12]. Table 1 shows a set of the
mNSS. Neurological function was graded on a scale of 0 to
18 (normal score: 0, maximal deficit score: 18). The mNSS
evaluation involves a composite of motor, sensory, reflex
and balance tests. In the severity scores of injury, 1 point is
awarded for the inability to perform the test or for the lack of
a tested reflex; thus, the higher the score, the more severe the
injury. Likewise, mouse MCAo models have been suggested
to have an association with a neurological disability status
score (NDSS) (Table 2) [21].
Evaluation of infarct lesion between rats and mice followed by MCAo: The subjects were anesthetized with an
intraperitoneal injection of Zoletil (40 mg/kg) and Rompun
(10 mg/kg). Subsequently, they underwent transcardial
perfusion with 0.1 M PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) (pH

stored in the same solution (4% NBP) for 24 hr at 4°C and
then passed through a gradient (10, 20, and 30%) of sucrose
solutions for cryoprotection. Next, tissue samples were embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA, U.S.A.). Brain tissues were dissected at 10 and
20 µm using a cryostat (HM525; MICROM International
GmbH, Walldorf, Germany). They were then stained with
either H&E (10-µm thick sections) or cresyl violet acetate
(Nissl; 20-µm thick sections), serially dehydrated in EtOH
solutions, cleared with xylene and mounted with Permount
(SP15-500; Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ, U.S.A.).
Statistical analysis: Data were collected from repeated experiments and are presented as means ± SD. Student`s t-test
was used for statistical analysis. Differences were deemed to
be statistically significant when P<0.05. All analyses were
performed using the SPSS software (SPSS ver. 19.0, IBM,

g) and 20–25 g (mice; 60 min: 23.30 ± 0.79 g and 90 min:
23.50 ± 1.19 g). The subjects showed significant reductions
of body weight compared with those before onset (rats; 60
min: 23.70 ± 7.43 g and 90 min: 36.29 ± 9.31 g) (mice; 60
min: 2.03 ± 0.54 g and 90 min: 3.17 ± 1.11 g) (P<0.01) (Fig.
2A, B). In 60 min occlusion models, there were reductions
of approximately 10% compared with initial body weight in
rats and mice. However, 90 min occlusion models showed
approximately 15% reductions compared with initial body
weight (P<0.01).
Survival ratio of MCAo rodent models: The 60 min occlusion rat model animals showed a survival ratio of 80.95%. A
total of 6 rats were excluded in the moderate-severity MCAo
model. Specifically, 3 rats were lost due to respiratory failure
after reperfusion, 1 rat died from bleeding from the jugular vein, and 2 rats were excluded due to mild symptoms.
Therefore, a total of 21 rats underwent MCAo surgery, and
15 of them showed moderate symptoms (model engineering
success ratio: 72.43%). In the mice, 19 mice were subjected
to MCAo surgery. A total of 16 mice also showed moderateseverity symptoms, as well as 3 mice that died due to respiratory failure. In terms of comparison of the 90 min occlusion
MCAo models, 15 rats were excluded in the MCAo model.
In detail, 1 rat was lost due to cardiac arrest at approximately
80 min during occlusion, 1 rat died from bleeding from the
occipital artery, and 3 rats were lost due to cardiac arrest

with respiratory failure. A total of 8 rats were also lost due to
respiratory failure after reperfusion. Therefore, a total of 26
rats underwent MCAo surgery, and 11 rats showed moderate
to severe symptoms. In the mouse MCAo model animals,
10 mice were also lost due to respiratory failure, as well as
2 mice that died from bleeding upon occipital artery rupture.
Likewise, 18 mice were subjected to MCAo surgery, and 6
mice also showed high severity symptoms (Table 3).
Measurement of neurological dysfunction: All subjects
were evaluated for neurological dysfunction following
mNSS (for rats) and NDSS (for mice). The occlusion period
is important for neurological severity. A period of occlusion
of 60 min occlusion might be appropriate for moderate
severity. A total of 19 rats showed moderate-severity symptoms (11.93 ± 0.96) (Fig. 2C). However, 2 rats showed mild
symptoms, excluding circling gait, spasticity of paretic limbs
or falling down on the beam. In the mice, 16 also exhibited
moderate-severity symptoms (6.81 ± 0.83) (Fig. 2D). In contrast, 90 min occlusion more often showed higher severity
than 60 min. A total of 11 rats showed high-severity symptoms (13.18 ± 0.98), including falling down on the paretic
side in open field, falling down in 20 sec on the beam and the
absence of a proprioceptive response (Fig. 2C). Likewise,
6 mice presented high-severity symptoms, including severe
hypomobility, respiratory distress and motor in coordination
(Fig. 2D).

model: Transient MCAo models were affected by the occlusion period. Therefore, the occlusion period was divided
into 60 and 90 min. All animals were sacrificed 24 hr after
reperfusion. The animals were employed for the following
histological studies: TTC staining (60 min occlusion: 3 rats
and 3 mice; 90 min occlusion: 3 rats and 2 mice), H&E and
Nissl staining (60 min occlusion: 12 rats and 13 mice; 90
min occlusion: 8 rats and 4 mice). We previously found that
the infarct volume is affected by the occlusion period using
the TTC staining method [10]. Here, we obtained quantitative results using general histological methods. Therefore,
H&E and Nissl staining was performed according to the protocol described in the Methods section. In the comparison
of the infarct volume using H&E staining, the bregma 0.00
mm (slice #3) region showed the largest infarct volume at 60
min of occlusion in both rat and mouse models (rats, 58.43 ±
0.38%; mice, 46.70 ± 0.81%). However, the infarct volume
was slightly smaller in the caudal slices. Infarct lesion of
MCAo animal models with occlusion for 90 min was significantly extended to retrograde at #3, #4 and #5 compared
with those of MCAo animal models with occlusion for 60
min in rats and mice (*P<0.05, **P<0.01) (Table 4). The
corpus callosum exhibited a dark violet contralateral lesion
on Nissl staining. However, the ipsilateral corpus callosum
showed a pale violet lesion (Fig. 1B and C, black arrow)
without a clear division between superficial and profundus
layer in cerebrum (Fig. 1B, C, lower panel).
DISCUSSION
The intraluminal MCAo model mimics one of the most
common types of ischemic stroke in human. Nevertheless,
MCAo models have typically involved rats for strokerelated research [23]. However, mouse stroke models have

insteadoften involved genetically or molecularly manipulated mice in research using knockout and knockdown techniques [5, 6, 17]. Knockout mice have been informative in
the discovery of unexpected biological functions of specific
molecules [26]. In particular, targeted molecules were identified as having roles in pathophysiological mechanisms.
In stroke-related studies, knockout mice have been used to
identify the inhibitory mechanism of cell death signaling,
as well as applied in the pharmacological developmental
industry through elucidation of the effects of candidate molecules that exhibit therapeutic efficiency [9, 17]. Genetically
mutated mouse models are essential for exploring genetic
diseases or undisclosed disease mechanisms [26].
Numerous studies have described MCAo surgery procedures [3, 4, 10–12, 14, 19, 20]. However, there are different
procedures, such as in terms of filament size and tip diameter,
insert length, occlusion period and surgical techniques. The
aim of the present study was to establish a standard mouse
MCAo model surgery procedure, as well as to compare
it with rat MCAo, which is extensively applied in strokerelated animal research.
In MCAo surgery, when all procedures have been completed, recovery of the body temperature must be achieved,
since numerous studies have proposed a body temperature
range of 37.0 ± 0.5°C, as well as indicating that the operation
period can also affect hypothermia. Body temperature is one
of the essential factors affecting the extent of infarction, hypothermia decreases and hyperthermia increases the infarct
lesion size [6]. Thus, completion of operation within 15 min
has been recommended [8]. Consequently, we exclude animals that have undergone operation for longer than 15 min.
The rat MCAo model used a 4–0 monofilament nylon, which
is made of a 0.4–0.45-mm outer-diameter thread by heating.
Numerous studies have suggested that the optimal thread re-

1560

quires 6–0 monofilament nylon for occlusion, which is made
with a 0.17–0.2-mm outer-diameter by heating [6, 13]. We
utilized 0.15–0.18-mm outer-diameter 6–0 nylon by heating.
Mouse MCAo models showed similar infarct volume to the
rat MCAo models upon 60 min occlusion. In particular, the
bregma 0.00 mm region showed the largest infarct volume
in both rat and mouse brains, as well as presenting a pattern
of infarct lesion from rostral to caudal in 60 min occlusion
models. The 90 min occlusion models also showed a similar
pattern of infarct lesion. Conversely, infarct volume was
shown to be slightly reduced from bregma 0.00 to caudal
(Fig. 2).
We previously suggested that the occlusion period by
MCAo surgery affects the infarct volume in rat and mouse
models of focal cerebral ischemia; rat and mouse 90 min
MCAo models exhibited significantly augmented infarct
volume from bregma 0.00 to −4.00 mm and from 2.00 to
−2.00 mm, respectively [10]. Brain infarct volume might be
associated with the survival rate.
In terms of the survival ratio, the 60 min occlusion rat
model showed an approximately 80% survival ratio, as
well as a 72.43% ischemic model engineering success ratio.
Likewise, mouse model animals showed approximately 85%
survival and 85% ischemic model engineering success ratio.
However, 90 min occlusion models showed a poor model
engineering success ratio followed by cardiac arrest, respiratory failure and severe ischemic damage. As a result, 90 min
was associated with 42.03% and 33.34% model engineering
success ratios in rats and mice, respectively.
We reported that transient MCAo models exhibited a moderate severity score by the mNSS test [12, 19, 20]. In terms
of a comparison of neurological dysfunction, 60 min occlusion rat model animals revealed optimal moderate-severity
symptoms, including flexion pattern of forelimb, circling
gait toward the paretic side and poor balance or falling down
on the beam. However, 90 min occlusion rat model animals
exhibited severe neurological symptoms, such as falling
down on the paretic side during gait, not attempting to balance on the beam, and myodystony. Moreover, there reduced
survival ratio during 24 hr after MCAo. Mouse MCAo model
animals also showed moderate neurological disability status,
as well as presenting with moderate-severity symptoms,
including circling gait, moderate hypomobility, excessive
urination, forelimb flexion and body rotation by tail suspension. Likewise, 90 min mouse MCAo model animals showed
a severe neurological disability status, such as severe motor
in coordination namely no attempt to climb to the top of the
edge on the inclination board, severe hypomobility namely
no movement during 30 sec and respiratory distress.
In conclusion, we have elucidated that the mouse MCAo
model procedure could induce a moderate-severity MCAo
model, as well as that our method might obtain a higher survival ratio and stable model engineering using mice.
To produce results relevant for a stroke study, standardized and high-quality rodent models are very important in
experimental stroke research. In addition, rodent MCAo
model engineering has to consider monofilament standard
for a hand-made probe, tip outer diameter (unrelated to

silicone coating or rounding by heating), probe insert length
(is needed regarding hemorrhage or ACA infarction) and
maintenance of body conditions during operation (body
temperature control) and occlusion time (moderate versus
severe score models and identity of model).
The following is a summary of rodent MCAo models:
(1) 0.40–0.45 mm probe of 4–0 nylon (for rats) and 0.15–
0.18 mm probe of 6–0 nylon (for mice) by heating
(2) Inserted probe length from bifurcated ICA and ECA:
18–20 mm (for rats) and 9–11 mm (for mice)
(3) Operation time: a maximum of 15 min
(4) Occlusion time: 60 min
(5) MCA occlusion allows CCA reperfusion (for rats) or
CCA binary occlusion (for mice)
