Vasoreactivity to hypercapnia has been used for assessing cerebrovascular tone and control altered by ischemic stroke. Despite the
high prognostic potential, traits of hypercapnia-induced hemodynamic changes have not been fully characterized in relation with
baseline vascular states and brain tissue damage. To monitor cerebrovascular responses, T2- and T2*-weighted magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) images were acquired alternatively using spin- and gradient-echo echo plannar imaging (GESE EPI) sequence with
5% CO2 gas inhalation in normal (n = 5) and acute stroke rats (n = 10). Dynamic relative changes in cerebrovascular volume (CBV),
microvascular volume (MVV), and vascular size index (VSI) were assessed from regions of interest (ROIs) delineated by the percent
decrease of apparent diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC). The baseline CBV was not affected by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
whereas the baseline MVV in ischemic areas was signiﬁcantly lower than that in the rest of the brain and correlated with ADC.
Vasoreactivity to hypercapnic challenge was considerably attenuated in the entire ipsilesional hemisphere including normal ADC
regions, in which unsolicited, spreading depression-associated increases of CBV and MVV were observed. The lesion-dependent
inhomogeneity in baseline MVV indicates the effective perfusion reserve for accurately delineating the true ischemic damage while
the cascade of neuronal depolarization is probably responsible for the hemispherically lateralized changes in overall neurovascular
physiology.

INTRODUCTION
Systemic hypercapnia, induced by inhaling excessive CO2, is
known to evoke signiﬁcant cerebral vasodilation, in which both
the overall cerebral blood volume (CBV) and the blood ﬂow (CBF)
are dramatically elevated.1,2 Such vasodilatory effects are related
to changes in extracellular ﬂuid pH that accompany the blood
pCO2 increase. The extracellular pH change directly mediates
several mechanisms capable of controlling smooth muscle cells
via (1) ATP-sensitive K+ channels, (2) prostanoids derived from
cyclooxygenase-1, and (3) nitric oxide signaling to maintain
homeostasis under normal healthy brain condition. In occlusive
cerebrovascular diseases, the vascular responsiveness to a vasodilator (e.g., PaCO2) is expected to be impaired in brain regions
where the cerebral perfusion pressure is below the low limit of
autoregulation. In this regard, induction of systemic hypercapnia
has been used to estimate the disrupted vascular tone and
maximum cerebral perfusion reserve after stroke for assessing
ischemic brain damage and vascular status.3–5 Moreover, mild
1

hypercapnia has been even suggested as a therapy option due to
the strong vasodilatory response.6,7
In the study of altered cerebrovascular tonus after focal or
global cerebral ischemia, most investigations have focused to
monitor changes in CBF. A number of studies using autoradiography with C14-iodoantipyrine,8 microspheres,9 or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI)10 reported that the CO2 reactivity in
CBF is abolished in the ischemic core but partially remains in the
brain tissue surrounding the core area (peri-infarct zone).
Although the reduced perfusion response to hypercapnia may
indicate a lack of cerebrovascular tone and control, the link
between ischemic cell damage and such disrupted hemodynamics has not been validated. In particular, we hypothesized that
characterization of microvascular blood distribution in respect to
tissue blood content is required to conﬁrm the utility of hypercapnic stimulation. In fact, among all vascular populations,
capillary bed offers the main site of chemical exchange, nutrient
delivery, and waste product removal, thus the welfare of
microvascular environment is in direct association with brain cell

survival. Although quantitative measurement of total CBV has
been often performed for understanding brain pathophysiology in
ischemic stroke,11,12 microvascular parameters have been overlooked mostly due to technical difﬁculties. In the current study,
using a novel MRI method and animal stroke model, (1)
characteristics of the hypercapnia-induced responses in different
vascular populations and (2) interdependence among multiple
MRI-derived hemodynamic and tissue parameters were investigated to understand whether the hypercapnic stimulation could
be used to delineate localized cellular and vascular damage.
Among modalities used to quantify vascular responses, MRI
provides a unique means for noninvasively quantifying physiologically relevant hemodynamic parameters (i.e., blood oxygen leveldependent (BOLD) signal, CBF, and CBV) with excellent structural
resolution. Until recently, most MRI studies have used BOLD signals
to investigate the neurovascular effects of stimulants and inspired
gases.13,14 However, because BOLD signal is derived from multiple
independent vascular parameters including blood oxygenation,
CBV, CBF, and cerebral metabolic rate of O2, interpretation of
BOLD signal is not always straightforward. To compensate such
demerits and improve the measurement sensitivity of vascular
parameters, the use of nonleaky intravascular MR contrast agents,
such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) with
a long half-life in the blood pool15,16 has been introduced to
evaluate both relative and regional CBV changes as well as the
relative blood volume changes pertaining only to microvasculature (i.e., microvascular volume (MVV)).
Magnetic resonance imaging signals acquired using gradientecho (GE) sequence before and after intravenous administration of
SPION reveal the total relative CBV (rCBV, ~ ΔR2*),17,18 while spinecho (SE) MRI signal is sensitive to the relative blood volume
occupying small sized microvessels (rMVV, ~ ΔR2).15,19,20 In addition, the vessel radii (vessel size index, VSI) can be estimated by
calculating the ratios of relaxation rate changes (ΔR2*/ΔR2), which
was previously showed to be linearly proportional to the vessel
radius.21,22 As such, the use of several MRI techniques in concert
provides extensive vascular information and can facilitate the
detection of spatial and temporal changes in neurovascular
physiology.
Our previous study showed signiﬁcant rCBV, rMVV, and VSI
responses to systemic hypercapnia in normal cerebral tissue. In
this study, repeated hypercapnic stimulations were performed
sequentially to obtain separate GE and SE signals for rCBV and
rMVV measurements, respectively, in which not only additional
scan time but also the recovery time to baseline (45 minutes) had
to be considered.23 In the application of the hypercapnia-induced
hemodynamic response (i.e., vasoreactivity) to assess acute stroke,
it is apparent that simultaneous acquisition of both GE and SE
sequences is advantageous since the short total acquisition time
would minimize the measurement error derived from rapidly
changing animal physiology. For this purpose, gradient- and spinecho (GESE) echo plannar imaging (EPI) is used in the current
study, which continuously alternates GE and SE EPI to capture
time-dependent hemodynamic events in a synchronous manner.
Such dynamic visualization of vasoreactivity at the multiple
vascular levels offers a technical advantage for real-time monitoring of vascular events and is expected to improve our understanding of ischemic tissue function and the related neurovascular
damage. The experiments were designed to characterize the
relationship between the MRI-derived vasoreactivity in response to
hypercapnia and baseline vascular states during the acute stage of
ischemic stroke and with the speciﬁc goal to test whether the
impaired vascular control correlates with acute tissue damage
deﬁned by decreased apparent diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
All procedures used in this study performed according to a protocol
approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Subcommittee on
Research Animal Care, in accordance with the guidelines established by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Theory
The compartmentalization of paramagnetic contrast agent within the
vasculature induces long-range magnetic ﬁeld perturbations that extend
over many microns and increases the transverse relaxation rates (R2 and
R2*) of tissue. Since susceptibility contrast mechanisms designed to study
the distribution of vessel sizes entirely rely on the compartmentalization of
the contrast agent within the vasculature, SPION, a large intravascular T2
contrast agent, can be used to measure the regional relative CBV, which
itself is a nonlinear function of the blood ﬂow.15,16 In this study, ΔR2 and
ΔR2* changes before and after injection of SPION were measured. Using
the different dependence of ΔR2 and ΔR2* sensitivity on vascular geometry (i.e., vessel radius), VSI was deﬁned by ΔR2*/ΔR2 ratio to provide a
measure of the average blood vessel size.21–24 Assuming a monoexponential signal decay, the enhancement of R2 and R2* caused by SPION can
be expressed in forms of relative vascular volumes as follows:

where S is the signal intensity, T2(*) is the transverse magnetization
relaxation time, the subscripts ‘pre’ and ‘post’ refer to the measurement
times with respect to contrast agent injection. Each rat was injected with
SPION (20 mg/kg), which was synthesized by us using the synthesis
technique previously described25,26 and similarly used as an intravascular
agent in the previous studies.22,23,27,28 Changes in transverse relaxation
rate due to SPION were negligible in normal rats for 1 hour after reaching
the initial equilibrium.

Animal Preparation
Adult Male Wistar rats (Charles River, MA, USA) weighing 280 to 300 g were
used for this study. Both stroke (n = 10, with permanent middle cerebral
artery (MCA) occlusion (MCAO)) and control (n = 5, without MCAO) groups
were randomly chosen from these subjects. For MCAO surgery, the rats
were anesthetized with 1.5% isoﬂurane in 70% N2O /30% O2 (ﬂow rate,
1.0 L/min), and then the right MCA was permanently occluded using the
intraluminal ﬁlament technique as previously described.29 In brief, the
common carotid artery and the proximal pterygopalatine artery were
ligated using 4-0 silk suture. Thereafter, the superior thyroid and occipital
branches of the external carotid artery were electro-coagulated and
transected. This was followed by ligation, electrocoagulation, and transect
of the external carotid artery, creating a stump to allow a commercialized
silicon rubber-coated 5-0 nylon monoﬁlament (tip diameter: 0.31 ±
0.02 mm) to advance 18 to 19 mm from the carotid bifurcation, along
the internal carotid artery for the occlusion of the MCA permanently. The
GESE EPI scan was initiated ~ 3 hours after the MCAO onset.
One femoral artery and both femoral veins were cannulated using
polyethylene catheters (PE50). One venous catheter was used for infusion
of SPION and the arterial catheter was used for monitoring mean arterial
blood pressure and blood gas analysis. The other venous catheter was
inserted to accommodate continuous infusion of anesthesia solution (αchloralose) containing muscle relaxant (pancuronium bromide). The
change of anesthesia regimen to α-chloralose was based on the previous
studies2,18,24 and used to avoid the neuronal activity suppression and
blood vessel dilation that are typically associated with the use of
isoﬂurane.30 Animals were tracheotomized and mechanically ventilated
with 1.5% isoﬂurane in 50% air/50% oxygen at a respiratory rate of 35 to 40
breaths/min,23 in which the oxygen concentration was determined from
the in-house experience to ensure the stable physiologic conditions in
blood pressure, body temperature, oxygen saturation, and heart rate.23,24
Before each MRI experiment, the anesthetic regimen was switched from
the isoﬂurane gas mixture used for surgery to continuous infusion of
α-chloralose (30 mg/kg per hour), preceded by a loading bolus (35 mg/kg).

Concurrently with α-chloralose administration, rats were paralyzed with an
intravenous bolus of pancuronium bromide (1.2 mg/kg), which was
followed by continuous infusion (1 mg/kg per hour). Animals were secured
in an MR-compatible rat stereotaxic headset with ear and tooth bars
throughout the experiment, during which a temperature-controlled water
blanket was placed under the rat's torso to maintain the body temperature
at 37.0°C.

Gas Stimulation Paradigm
The hypercapnic challenge involved an exposure to a premixed gas
consisting of 5% CO2, 47.5% air, and 47.5% oxygen. Each gas trial included
a 2-minute baseline (50% air and 50% oxygen), a 5-minute hypercapnia
(5% CO2, 47.5% air, and 47.5% oxygen), and a 5-minute return to baseline
(50% air and 50% oxygen). The inspired gas mixtures were manually
controlled using a multi-gas ﬂowmeter (Surgivet/Anesco, Colonial Medical
Supply, Waukesha, WI, USA).

Magnetic Resonance Image Acquisition
The MRI measurements were performed using a horizontal bore 9.4 T
Bruker/Magnet system equipped with a gradient coil (peak strength = 440
mT/m; peak slew rate = 3,440 T/m/s) and a home-built rat head surface
transmit-receive RF coil, approximately 30 mm in diameter. Magnetic ﬁeld
homogeneity was optimized by automatic shimming (Bruker Biospec,
Billerica, MA, USA). Before GESE EPI, multi-slice multi-echo sequence
(MSME) was performed to outline the brain anatomy. Parameters for the
MSME sequence were repetition time = 3,000 ms, echo time = 15, 30, 45,
60, 75, 90, 105, and 120 ms, ﬁeld of view = 2.35 × 2.35 cm2, matrix = 80 × 80
(resolution 0.294 mm), slice thickness = 1 mm, 16 slices, and scan time = 4
minutes. To delineate the lesion and draw the ADC-deﬁned regions of
interest (ROIs), a single-shot echo-planar diffusion tensor imaging data set
was acquired with the following parameters: repetition time = 9,000 ms,
echo time = 50 ms, ﬁeld of view = 2.35 × 2.35 cm2, matrix = 80 × 80 (resolution 0.294 mm), number of diffusion direction = 7 and b factor = 0, 800
seconds/mm2, and scan time = 4 minutes 12 seconds. Field of view, matrix
size, slice thickness, and number were same with the MSME sequence.
For the simultaneous monitoring of rCBV and rMVV responses, T2- and
T2*-weighted images were acquired alternatively using the newly developed GESE EPI sequence before (preGESE, repetition number = 20,
2 minutes) and after (postGESE, repetition number = 120, 12 minutes)
administering SPION (20 mg/kg). PostGESE sequence is composed of
prehypercapnia (duration for baseline measurement, 2 minutes), hypercapnia (duration of stimuli, 5 minutes), and posthypercapnia (duration of
rest, 5 minutes) periods. Repetition time/echo time for GE and SE was
3,000/15.16 ms and 3,000/27.73 ms, which resulted in the average signalto-noise ratio of 17.04 ± 2.56 and 16.84 ± 2.08 for GE and SE EPI images,
respectively. Other geometric parameters such as ﬁeld of view, slice
thickness, and number were the same as the MSME and diffusion tensor
imaging sequences except for the matrix size. The spatial and temporal
resolutions for the GESE were 0.367 mm and 6 seconds, respectively.

Data Analysis
Analysis of Functional NeuroImages was used for all MRI signal analysis.
Image conversion into the Analysis of Functional NeuroImages format,
motion correction, image separation of SE and GE, calculation of cerebrovascular parameters, deﬁning ROIs, adjustment of spatial resolution,
and vasoreactivity analysis during the hypercapniawere performed using
Analysis of Functional NeuroImages. Voxel-wise hemodynamic maps were
calculated described by the equation (1, 2, 3) over the postGESE scan time.
The MRI time courses were analyzed using the standard general linear
model approach.31 The functional activation maps from CO2 stimuli were
acquired, for which the stimulus paradigm is convolved with the respective
hemodynamic response function for rCBV, rMVV, and VSI, to generate a
maximum likelihood estimator. The relative contrast-to-noise was computed using a t-test provided by deconvolution program (http://afni.nimh.
nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dDeconvolve.html) between the
baseline (during the last 30 seconds before the hypercapnic challenge)
and hypercapnia (during the last 30 seconds before the CO2 is turned off)
period after the injection of SPION. The spatial resolution of ADC maps
produced from diffusion tensor imaging data sets resolution (0.294 mm)
was interpolated to match that of the functional hemodynamic voxelwise
maps (0.367 mm) using the reorientation program (http://afni.nimh.nih.
gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dresample.html). Regions of interest
were classiﬁed by the percent decrease of ADC compared with the

contralesional cortex. (1) core: area with greater than 35% decrease in ADC,
(2) peri-infarct: area with ADC decrease between 15% and 35%, (3) subnormal: subcortex, and (4) cortex-normal: cortex area with the ADC
decrease less than 15%. Regions of interest in contralesional hemisphere
were placed in the homologous regions of the ipsilesional hemisphere.
Quantitative analysis of the lesion sizes, baseline blood volumes, and
vasoreactivities were performed using ADC-deﬁned ROIs. The Friedman
test was performed to compare the CO2 reactivity and baseline differences
among three kinds of ROI, which were obtained from the normal rat brain,
ipsilesional and contralesional of the stroke rat brains. For analysis of the
relationship between the core/peri-infarct size and baseline blood volume,
and core/peri-infarct size and the vasoreactivities during hypercapnia, the
correlation coefﬁcients squared (R2) were calculated using regression and
nonparametric correlation analysis (Spearman correlation) method. An R2
indicated the degree of correlation, in which R2 values were divided into
three groups: 0.3 to 0.49, 0.5 to 0.69, and 40.7 showing mild, moderate,
and strong correlation groups, respectively. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was
performed to compare the baseline and the vasoreactivity during
hypercapnia between the normal and stroke group, Wilcoxon signedrank was for the internal difference measurements in the individual rats. All
statistical signiﬁcance was accepted at a conﬁdence level of 0.95. Values in
Figures 2, 3, 4, 5 are presented as the mean ± standard deviation.

RESULTS
Physiologic Measurements
Before and after GESE data acquisition, mean arterial blood pressure results were within normal physiologic ranges, consistent
with previously reported measurements.23 During hypercapnia,
the mean arterial blood pressure measured before the hypercapnic challenge decreased from 113.1 ± 15.6 to 90.3 ± 21.6 mm Hg
(P o 0.05). However, blood gas results (pH, PaO2, PaCO2, etc)
obtained before and after GESE image acquisition times showed
no signiﬁcant differences (data are not shown).
Interrelationship between Stroke Volume, Baseline Volumes, and
Vasoreactivities
Relationships between the lesion (core, peri-infarct) volumes,
baseline blood volumes (rCBVbase, rMVVbase), and vasoreactivities (CBVreac, MVVreac) are shown in Figure 1. Middle cerebral
artery occlusion led to the apparent DWI signal intensity increase
and ADC decrease in the affected cerebral tissue, majority of
which were located in subcortex. The mean infarct core volume,
deﬁned as the brain tissue volume with ADC o65% of the
contralesional cortical ADC, was 30.98 ± 13.35 mm3, while the
mean peri-infarct volume, with the ADC between 65% and 85% of
the contralesional cortical ADC, was 21.4 ± 5.03 mm3 (Figure 1). No
statistically signiﬁcant relationships were found for either lesion
volumes (i.e., core and peri-infarct) with rCBVbase and CBVreac or
peri-infarct volume and rMVVbase. However, statistically signiﬁcant negative correlations were established between stroke core
volume and rMVVbase (Po 0.01, R2 = 0.637; moderate correlation),
core volume and MVVreac (P o 0.05, R2 = 0.425; mild correlation),
and peri-infarct volume and MVVreac (Po 0.05, R2 = 0.541;
moderate correlation) (Figures 1C and 1E).
Baseline Blood Volumes
Baseline characteristics of vascular parameters (rCBVbase,
rMVVbase, and VSIbase) are displayed in Figures 2 and 3. First,
the internal variation test within the control rat brains revealed
similar rCBVbase, rMVVbase, and VSIbase values between left and
right hemispheres, showing the absence of hemispheric bias.
Upon comparing cortex with subcortex, signiﬁcantly greater
subcortical rCBVbase and VSIbase than those measured in the
cortex were observed, whereas the subcortical rMVVbase was
lower than the cortical value (Figure 2). In the stroke group,
independent of hemispheric laterality, the baseline vascular
parameters acquired from either ipsi or contralesional cortical

areas pertaining to the normal ADC were not different compared
with those measured in the normal healthy cortical tissue of
control rat brains (Figures 2A, 2C, and 2E). Similarly for subcortex,
both the rCBVbase and rMVVbase values in the core and periinfarct areas were not signiﬁcantly different from those measured
in the normal control rats (see Figures 2B, 2D and 2F). However,
the rMVVbase values in the ipsilesional normal ADC subcortical
areas and their contralesional counterpart areas were increased
compared with those measured in either any other areas in the
stroke rat brains or the normal rat brains (Figure 2D), which results
in the decrease of mean VSIbase (Figure 2F).
In the stroke rat group, although the cortical rCBVbase values
measured in both ipsi or contralesional hemisphere were slightly
less than those measured from the subcortical other regions,
the rCBVbase values were not statistically distinguishable and
independent of ADC (Figures 3A and 3B). However, the signiﬁcant
differences of rMVVbase between ipsi and contralesional hemispheres were found in all subcortex areas (Figure 3C and Table 1).
Of particular note, the ipsilesional rMVVbase was negatively
correlated with the lesion severity deﬁned as ADC decrease, in
which the mean rMVVbase in core, peri-infarct, and normal ADC
subcortical areas was 10.92 ± 3.76, 12.51 ± 2.87, and 14.85 ± 5.88 1/s,
Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2015), 1033 – 1043

respectively (Figures 3A and 3C). Similarly, the mean ipsilesional
VSIbase, an indicator of vessel dilation, was signiﬁcantly greater
than that measured in the contralesional only in the core infarct
area, in which the VSIbase was positively correlated with the lesion
severity (Figures 3A and 3D).
Vasoreactivities During Hypercapnia
Vasoreactivity in response to hypercapnia was quantiﬁed by
calculating the time average (during the last 30 seconds before
the CO2 is turned off) of percent changes in rCBV, rMVV, and VSI as
shown in Figure 4. These vascular responses were not different
between bilateral hemispheres in normal control rats (Figure 4A)
while those measured in the ipsilesional tissue of stroke rats were
hemispherically deﬁcient in all areas including the normal ADC
regions (Figure 4B). In fact, the reduced CBVreac and MVVreac
within the ipsilesional hemisphere of the stroke rats were not
signiﬁcantly different among all four ipsilesional ROIs, indicating
that the vasoreactivity was not dependent on either the ADCdeﬁned stroke severity or the status of baseline blood volume. The
VSIreac was not statistically different from that in normal rat brain,
in which the VSIreac in all ROIs of the normal and stroke rat brains

converged to zero due to the proportionally comparable CBVreac
and MVVreac (Figure 4).
The time dependence of percent changes in rCBV, rMVV, and
VSI during hypercapnia is displayed in Figure 5. In normal control
rats, both rCBV and rMVV almost linearly increased for the ﬁrst
~ 36 seconds. After such sharp initial increases, both rCBV and
rMVV slowly increased reaching plateaus, in which the cortical
blood volume increases were always greater than the subcortical
increases (Figures 5A and 5B). In the stroke group, even in the
contralesional hemisphere, the slope of initial increase was much
less than the normal control whereas the time to reach the peak in

each time course was much shorter. Despite these altered
temporal traits, the rCBV and rMVV response amplitudes in the
contralesional hemisphere were similar to those measured in the
normal control rats. No notable changes in VSI were observed in
either rat groups (Figures 5C, 5F, 5I, 5L, and 5O). However, in the
infarct tissue (reduced ADC areas), compared with contralesional
counterparts, the increases in both rCBV and rMVV were signiﬁcantly attenuated without any appreciable difference, independent of lesion severity (Figures 5D, 5E, 5G, and 5H). Similarly for
normal ADC regions in the ipsilesional hemisphere, both rCBV and
rMVV response amplitudes were signiﬁcantly lower than those

Functional analyses in normal rat brain revealed little difference
in activation between bilateral hemispheres (Figures 6B and 6C). In
the contralesional hemisphere of ischemic rats, strong cortical
rCBV activation due to hypercapnic stimulation was accompanied
by relatively smaller subcortical responses (caudate and thalamus:
Figures 6E and 6H). The rMVV functional maps also revealed
signiﬁcant responses to hypercapnia; however, in contrast to the

lower than the subcortical activation in the contralesional hemisphere (Figures 6F and 6I). Both rCBV and rMVV functional maps
conﬁrmed hemispherically deﬁcient, extremely zero activation
even for normal ADC areas in ipsilesional hemisphere (Figures 6D–

even in slices that contain very small infarct core volume. The

(Figures 6D–6F) and smaller volume (Figures 6G–6I) were acquired
from the same stroke rat images.
During the scan, sudden increases of rCBV and rMVV,
presumably as results of the spreading depression (SD), were
occasionally observed in the only ipsilesional hemispheres of the
stroke rats (Figure 7). Single and local (n = 2), single and
hemispheric (n = 1), and repeated and hemispheric (n = 1, 3 times)
increases lasted for 90 ~ 222 seconds. These unsolicited, sporadic
increases in both rCBV and rMVV occurred with the similar
proportions, resulting in the lack of VSI increases.
DISCUSSION
Newly Developed Gradient- and Spin-Echo Technique
Increasing R2 and R2* of blood using superparamagnetic colloidal
nanoparticles, such as SPION can effectively decrease the MRI
Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2015), 1033 – 1043

signals, creating negative contrasts that are weighted by the
relative blood volume associated with either microvasculature
only or entire blood vessels, respectively. Thus, by combining SE
and GE measurements, the caliber-dependent characteristics of
vasculature can be obtained with a relatively simple manipulation
of MRI pulse sequence.24 The advantage of such technical features
has been exploited to construct parametric vascular maps for
assessing accurate perfusion state in different regions of the
organ, especially the microvascular circulation in relation to the
total blood volume. Additionally, the present study expanded the
application to evaluate dynamic traits of cerebrovascular changes
simultaneously at different vascular levels using the alternating
GESE EPI, speciﬁcally capturing the response to systemic hypercapnia after focal cerebral ischemia. Our previous study using
normal healthy rats23 quantiﬁed the dynamic rCBV and rMVV but
used independent acquisitions of GE and SE signals with separate

hypercapnic challenges. Compared with the current GESE method,
previous measurements with the separate acquisitions of rCBV
and rMVV required more time as much as the recovery time from
the peak to the baseline (~ 5 minutes) and also the additional
stabilizing time until the cerebrovascular ﬂuctuation disappeared
completely (approximately 25 to 30 minutes) after CO2 was turned
off. Moreover, despite the consistent results, both physiologic and
MRI system drifts between acquisitions could not have been ruled
out entirely under such settings and might have limited the
measurement precision. In this sense, the GESE EPI technique
provides an important improvement for assessing dynamic
characterization of the full vascular status (i.e, rCBV and rMVV
and VSI) in conditions that are highly time-limited or physiologically unpredictable.
Baseline Blood Volume Changes in Stroke Tissue
In conjunction with the apparent CBF decrease by arterial occlusion, several studies reported signiﬁcant CBV decrease in the
ischemic core and peri-infarct areas at acute stroke phase (3 to
6 hours after stroke onset).32,33 Unlike these results, the rCBVbase
between the bilateral hemispheres and among variable lesion
areas (Figure 3B) was undifferentiated in the current study, which
suggests uncoupling of lesion severity and perfusion change in
the ischemic rat brain. Such conﬂicting results may have arisen
from differences in experimental methods. The current study
utilized a strictly steady-state technique, whereas the rCBVbase
measured in other previous studies was mostly derived from the
CBF measurements using tracer kinetic method, in which the
rCBVbase in low perfusion areas can be easily underestimated
unless the local arterial input function is properly deﬁned.32–34
Upon classifying small sized vessel traits, despite the unaffected
cortical rMVVbase, a signiﬁcant increase of the mean subcortical
ipsilesional rMVVbase was observed only in the normal ADC area,
compared with normal healthy rats (Figure 2D). This ﬁnding
particularly implies the autoregulatory cooption of capillaries (i.e.,
increased density of perfused vessels). Such increases in rMVVbase
were also observed in the contralesional subcortex, which suggests an important autoregulatory response to maximize the
global perfusion at the subcortical capillary level and perhaps
reciprocally shows the deﬁcient control of capillary bed in
ipsilesional core and peri-infarct areas. When ipsilesional ROI’s
were compared with the homologous contralesional areas, all the
ipsilesional subcortical rMVVbase values were signiﬁcantly smaller
than contralesional rMVVbase values (Figure 3C), most likely due
to the inadequate perfusion pressure and subsequent deprival of
capillary blood in the infarct area.
The reduced rMVVbase in core and peri-infarct areas compared
with the homologous and normal ADC subcortical regions,
combined with the surprisingly unaffected CBV, resulted in the
signiﬁcantly increased mean VSIbase (Figures 3B–3D). And the
reduced rMVVbase was in signiﬁcant correlation with the formation of cytotoxic edema (i.e., ADC decrease) irrespective of the
rCBVbase status. Accordingly, we wish to point out that the microvasculature perfusion may have a critical role to control the
cellular damage and provide a predictive marker for assessing the
stroke severity. In particular, the direct inverse relationship
between the severity of ischemia (measured by stroke core
volume) and rMVVbase (Figure 1C) further supports the relationship between ischemia-induced damage and functional changes
of capillary perfusion. Therefore, these ischemia-associated baseline vascular traits circumstantially point toward a few possible
scenarios: (1) the augmentation of subcortical rMVVbase in normal
ADC tissue via cooption of microvessels, which give rise to the
decrease in VSIbase (Figures 2D and 2F), (2) the relative decrease
of the infarct core rMVVbase (i.e., occlusion of microvessels), in
which lack of capillary perfusion in the infarct tissue is compensated by the dilation of larger vessels, thus maintaining the
© 2015 ISCBFM

rCBVbase (see Figures 3B–3D), and (3) the microvessel dilation
leading to the concomitant decrease of the measured infarct core
rMVVbase (Figures 3C and 3D). Although hypothetically diverse,
the phenotypic imbalance between rCBVbase and rMVVbase in
the reduced ADC areas likely occurred as a result of autoregulation
disturbance. The strong dependence of the ADC-deﬁned stroke
severity as well as the overall stroke core volume makes the
attenuated rMVVbase in the ipsilesional hemisphere a key vascular
factor contributing to the acute stroke outcome (Figure 1 and
Table 1).
Hemispherically Decreased Vasoreactivities in Ipsilesional
Hemisphere
In the current study, increased rCBV and rMVV in all regions of
healthy control rat brain during CO2 exposure without any signiﬁcant changes in VSI is in good agreement with our previous study
results.23 This observation suggests the proportional increases of
both capillary and large vessel blood volumes with even volume
increases of either vascular population (Figure 4A). Similarly, CO2
inhalation resulted in signiﬁcantly elevated rCBV and rMVV in the
contralesional hemisphere of stroke rat brain; however, these
responses were much less in the ipsilesional hemispheres. The
mean percent rCBV increase values in the entire ipsilesional and
homologous contralesional hemisphere were 5.03 ±1.41% and
17.44 ± 0.78% while the percent rMVV increase values were
5.04 ± 1.2% and 19.14 ± 1.03%, respectively (Figure 4B). Even for
the ischemic brain, the magnitudes of rCBV and rMVV responses
were proportional, thus no noticeable VSI increases were found.
This lack of VSI increase obtained in the current MRI study
seemingly conﬂicts with the previous results by Duelli et al,35 in
which the increased capillary diameter during hypercapnia was
accompanied by the increases in both the CBF and the density of
perfused capillaries. In fact, the cooption and dilation of microvessels attributed to the increases in both ΔR2 and ΔR2* due to
the increase in number of perfused micvovessels and the actual
increases in size of microvessels’ caliber, respectively. Therefore,
despite the possible difference in origin, these simultaneous
increases might have led to the current observation, in which
similar percent increases in ΔR2 and ΔR2* (MVVreac and CBVreac)
resulted in the nearly unresponsive VSIreac to the hypercapnic
challenge. Interestingly, the vessel population imbalance found in
the baseline vascular measurements did not affect the proportionality of percent response magnitudes, which also led to the
lack of VSIreac change (Figure 4B).
In regards to the comprehensive impairment of cerebrovascular
reactivity in whole ipsilesional hemisphere, the phenomenon of
diaschisis is a likely cause for these remote effects. The strokeassociated diaschisis is deﬁned as the autoregulatory dysfunction5
or alteration in regional blood ﬂow and metabolism36 in brain
areas remote from the ischemic lesion. Similarly, remote impairments in cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity have also been found in
human37 and animal.3,8,9 For example, the hypercapnic vasoreactivity was found abolished in the ischemic center, depressed in
the peri-infarct and affected even in the normal remote areas (e.g.,
territory supplied by anterior cerebral artery of the ipsilesional
hemisphere or white matter of the contralesional hemisphere) in
rat8 and baboon9 MCAO models. Histologic examination performed by Symon et al3 strengthened the theory of diaschisis by
demonstrating that the normal healthy tissue territories also
exhibited the reduced CO2 reactivity. Several human studies also
showed the hemispherically reduced CO2 reactivity in cortical
infarct patients and the diffused attenuation in bilateral hemispheres of patients with subcortical (lacuar) infarction.37 These
results indicate that the decreased CO2 vasoreactivity occurs along
with or originates from the extensive vasoparalysis after focal
cerebral ischemia and also that this disturbance is unrelated to
ischemic territory deﬁned by ADC.

As shown in Figure 7, sudden increases of CBV and MVV
conﬁned in the ipsilesional hemisphere were frequently observed
during MRI scan, which is probably linked to SD. Spreading
depression is characterized by waves of depolarizing neurons
accompanied by dramatic changes in neural metabolism and
cerebral blood ﬂow in the affected region, and ischemic stroke is
known to trigger the propagation of SD along the pei-infarct and
often into the nonischemic tissue.38 In the current study, the
hypercapnic vasoreactivity is impaired independent of cellular
damage and/or baseline vascular values, as previous studies
showed signiﬁcantly reduced CO2 reactivity after SD.39,40 Although
hypercapnic vasodilation is presumably induced without eliciting
strong neuronal or metabolic changes,1,2 we posit that the
hemispheric absence of vasoreactivity is connected to the strokeassociated SD and subsequent neural damage. Especially, the
remotely impaired vasoreactivity produced after cerebral ischemia
is likely to result from the neural damage in relation with SD rather
than intrinsic changes in the neural circuitry or blood vessels in
the remote region.
As such, dynamic monitoring of hypercapnic response provides
an effective means to capture stroke-affected neurovascular
disturbances. Although robust, a technical requirement such as
the maintenance of intravascular contrast agent concentration in
this approach is noteworthy. In the current study, the relatively
short acquisition time (~20 minutes) minimized the inﬂuence from
the systemic clearance of SPION concentration (measured by ΔR2).
A long half-life of SPION, in which no detectable change in the
baseline ΔR2 was observed for 3 hours also aided the measurement accuracy without further signal modiﬁcation.
Our study extensively characterized the cerebrovascular alteration (e.g., baseline blood volumes) and hypercapnia-induced
hemodynamic changes in different vascular populations at an
acute stage of focal ischemia. While the rCBVbase was unaffected,
the rMVVbase in the ipsilesional areas signiﬁcantly correlated with
the regional ADC decrease. In particular, the mismatch between
the baseline vascular parameters and hemispheric impairment of
cerebrovascular reactivity in nonischemic regions suggests neural
diaschisis, which was partially and/or indirectly induced by
apparent SD. Therefore, the region-dependent inhomogeneity in
rMVVbase may indicate the true differentiation of effective perfusion reserve and may used for delineating the stroke damage and
prognosis, whereas the impaired CO2-dependent cerebral supply
perhaps reveals changes in overall neurovascular physiology caused
by the neuroelectric insult. The current study shows that the
impaired CO2 reactivity and altered baseline MVV in concert provide
a MRI-based acute stroke assessment strategy and markers of
generalized stroke-associated neural and vascular damage.
