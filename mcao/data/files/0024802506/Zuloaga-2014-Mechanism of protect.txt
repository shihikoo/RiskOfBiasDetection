Abstract
Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a potential target of therapy for ischemic injury. sEH metabolizes
neuroprotective epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). We recently demonstrated that sEH inhibition reduces infarct size after
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in type 1 diabetic mice. We hypothesized that inhibition of sEH would protect
against ischemic injury in type 2 diabetic mice. Type 2 diabetes was produced by combined high-fat diet, nicotinamide and
streptozotocin in male mice. Diabetic and control mice were treated with vehicle or the sEH inhibitor t-AUCB then subjected
to 60-min MCAO. Compared to chow-fed mice, high fat diet-fed mice exhibited an upregulation of sEH mRNA and protein in
brain, but no differences in brain EETs levels were observed between groups. Type 2 diabetic mice had increased blood
glucose levels at baseline and throughout ischemia, decreased laser-Doppler perfusion of the MCA territory after
reperfusion, and sustained larger cortical infarcts compared to control mice. t-AUCB decreased fasting glucose levels at
baseline and throughout ischemia, improved cortical perfusion after MCAO and significantly reduced infarct size in diabetic
mice. We conclude that sEH inhibition, as a preventative treatment, improves glycemic status, post-ischemic reperfusion in
the ischemic territory, and stroke outcome in type 2 diabetic mice.

hyperglycemia, the two diseases are metabolically quite distinct.
Type 1 diabetes results in hyperglycemia due to destruction of
pancreatic beta cells leading to absolute insulin deficiency. In
contrast type 2 diabetes results in hyperglycemia due to insulin
resistance or relative insulin deficiency, and is commonly
associated with obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension [18]. In
the current study, we wanted to determine whether the protective
effect of sEH inhibition would extend to the setting of type 2
diabetes, a much more prevalent and complex hyperglycemic
disease. In addition, we utilized a rodent model of pre-diabetes to
determine if sEH is upregulated before development of overt type
2 diabetes. We hypothesized that inhibition of sEH, as a
preventative treatment, would protect against ischemic injury in
type 2 diabetic mice.

Introduction
Individuals with diabetes have more than twice the risk for
stroke compared to non-diabetic individuals [1]. Hyperglycemia is
also associated with poor stroke outcome in both humans [2–4]
and in several rodent models of stroke [5–10]. Approximately 40%
of ischemic stroke patients are hyperglycemic upon admission to
the hospital [4]. Clinically, blood glucose levels correlate with both
infarct size and degree of disability [4]. However, tight glycemic
control in hyperglycemic patients has failed to protect against
stroke incidence or improve outcome in clinical trials [11–16].
Since tight glycemic control has failed to protect hyperglycemic
patients from increased stroke risk and worse stroke outcome, the
goal of the current study was to determine if inhibition of soluble
epoxide hydrolase (sEH) would protect against ischemic injury in
type 2 diabetic mice. sEH is a potential mediator of ischemic
injury via its metabolism of neuroprotective epoxyeicosatrienoic
acids (EETs). sEH is expressed in a variety of cells in the brain
including cerebrovascular endothelium, vascular smooth muscle
cells, neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes [17].
Using a rodent model of type 1 diabetes, we have recently
shown that hyperglycemia decreases brain EETs concentrations
and increases infarct size after MCAO [8]. Furthermore, we
showed that sEH inhibition could restore brain EETs concentrations and reduce infarct size in type 1 diabetic mice [8]. While
both type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus are characterized by

isoflurane, blood collected, and either sacrificed by decapitation
and brains removed for infarct size measurement, or perfused with
heparinized ice-cold saline for brain collection for qPCR, and
Western blot. Insulin levels were measured in serum by
radioimmunoassay using a Rat Insulin RIA Kit (Millipore,
Billerica, MA). Measurements were run in duplicate and
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
intra-assay coefficient of variation was 5.7%.

High Fat Diet Model of Pre-diabetes in Mice
Long-term high fat diet is a model of pre-diabetes in mice,
leading to elevated body weight and impaired glucose tolerance
without causing overt hyperglycemia [19]. Five-week old male
C57BL/6J mice (JAX) were acclimatized to the animal facility and
then placed on a high fat (60% fat) diet (D12492, Research Diets,
Inc., New Brunswick, NJ) or normal chow (13% fat) diet (LabDiet
5001; Nestle Purina, St. Louis, MO) for 15 weeks. Weight was
tracked biweekly. At 20 weeks of age, mice were fasted overnight
then subjected to a glucose tolerance test (GTT). For the GTT,
blood glucose was measured just prior to injection of glucose (2 g/
kg, i.p.), and once every 15–30 minutes for 2 hrs after the
injection. Insulin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay
using a Rat Insulin RIA Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Measurements were run in duplicate and performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The intra-assay coefficient of variation was 5.7%.

Brain Infarct Size
Infarct size in cerebral cortex, caudate putamen and total
hemisphere was measured at 24 h after MCAO in 2-mm thick
coronal brain sections using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) staining and digital image analysis (SigmaScan Pro 5.0,
Aspire Software, Ashburn, VA) as previously described [22]. To
account for edema, infarcted area was estimated by subtracting the
uninfarcted region in ipsilateral hemisphere from the contralateral
hemisphere, and expressing infarct volume as a percentage of the
contralateral hemisphere.

Real-time Quantitative PCR

High Fat Diet, Streptozotocin and Nicotinamide (HFD+
STZ/NA) Model of Type 2 Diabetes in Mice

Levels of EPHX2 (sEH gene) mRNA were determined as
previously described [8]. In brief, RNA was isolated using a
commercial kit (RNAqueous-Micro, Ambion, Austin, TX), contaminant genomic DNA removed by DNase treatment, and RNA
reverse transcribed using a commercial high capacity cDNA
archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Resulting cDNA
was amplified using TaqMan Universal PCR amplification in a
commercial sequence detection system (ABI Prism 7000, Applied
Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Quantitative PCR was performed in a
96-well plate using 50 ml total volume, in triplicate. PCR was
concurrently run on controls without template to assess DNA
contamination and primer-dimer formation. Remaining RNA not
reverse transcribed was included to control for genomic DNA
amplification. 18S was measured as an internal control using an
18S mRNA control kit (FAM-TAMRA, Eurogentec, Seraing,
BEL). EPHX2 primers were purchased as a TaqMan Gene
Expression Assay (Invitrogen, Catalog #4351372). All final
EPHX2 mRNA levels were normalized to 18S.

Five-week old male C57BL/6J mice (JAX) were acclimatized to
the animal facility and placed on a high fat (60% fat) diet (D12492,
Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ) or normal chow (13%
fat) diet (LabDiet 5001; Nestle Purina, St. Louis, MO) for 4 wks.
After 4 wks on the high fat diet, mice were fasted overnight and
treated with nicotinamide (NA; 240 mg/kg, i.p.) and streptozotocin (STZ; 100 mg/kg, i.p.) 15 min later. Chow-fed controls
received equal volume of saline (i.p.) followed by 50 mM citric
acid buffer (i.p) 15 min later. Two days later, the mice were again
fasted and treated with either NA/STZ or saline/citric acid buffer.
Nakamura et al. [1] demonstrated that with STZ treatment alone
(type 1 diabetes model) pancreatic beta cells are lost, but that STZinduced beta cell damage is attenuated by NA in a dose-dependent
manner [20]. After 6 weeks on their diets, mice were fasted and
glycemia in saphenous vein blood was measured by glucometer
(Breeze 2, Bayer, Tarrytown, NY) to confirm hyperglycemia in
type 2 diabetic mice. This model of type 2 diabetes has been well
characterized and has been shown to cause insulin resistance [20].

Western Blot
sEH protein expression was measured as previously described
[8]. In brief, mice were perfused with ice-cold heparinized saline to
remove blood, and brains were collected. Brains were homogenized in lysis buffer, centrifuged, and supernatant collected.
Protein samples (40 mg) were separated by gel electrophoresis and
then transferred to Polyvinylidene Difluoride (PVDF) membranes.
Blots were blocked in 5% dry milk, and incubated at 4uC
overnight with a primary rabbit polyclonal antibody against
murine sEH (1:500; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). The
signal was visualized using a horseradish peroxidase-linked (HRP)
rabbit secondary antibody (1:1,000; GE Healthcare, Piscataway,
NJ) followed by detection using Supersignal chemiluminescent
reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with a
FluorChem FC2 (Protein Simple, Santa Clara, CA). Blots were
stripped using Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and re-probed for beta actin (1:2,000; SigmaAldrich) and followed by HRP mouse secondary antibody
(1:1,000; GE Healthcare) and re-imaged. Densitometry was
quantified with AlphaView software (Protein Simple) and sEH
protein was normalized relative to beta actin as expressed as a
ratio compared to chow-fed mice.

Inhibition of Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase (sEH) Activity
In vivo sEH activity was inhibited with trans-4-[4-(3-Adamantan-1-yl-ureido) -cyclohexyloxy]-benzoic acid (t-AUCB), developed and generously provided by Dr. Bruce Hammock, University
of California, Davis, CA [21]. Mice received 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg
t-AUCB or saline vehicle i.p. daily for the final 6 days before
cerebral ischemia, with the final t-AUCB dose administered
immediately after reperfusion.

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO)
MCAO was performed 2 weeks after completion of STZ/NA
treatment or vehicle for corresponding controls. Transient (60min) focal cerebral ischemia was induced in overnight-fasted mice
using an intraluminal MCAO technique described previously [22].
Briefly, isoflurane-anesthetized mice were instrumented with a
laser-Doppler probe and rectal temperature probe and MCAO
ischemia induced via insertion of a silicone-coated 6-0 nylon
monofilament into the right internal carotid artery until MCA flow
was ,20% of baseline. The occluding filament was subsequently
withdrawn for reperfusion. Mice were allowed to recover and
observed for 1 day, after which they were anesthetized with

Type 2 Diabetes, sEH and Stroke

Cerebral Blood Flow during Reperfusion is Decreased in
Type 2 Diabetic Mice and Rescued with sEH Inhibition

Statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as mean 6 SEM. Groups were compared by
t-test for two groups or two-way ANOVA with post hoc NewmanKeuls test for multiple measures with multiple groups using
GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA).
Differences were considered significant at p,0.05.

Results

Fig. 5 shows that relative perfusion, measured by laser Doppler
probe, of the MCA territory after reperfusion was decreased in
HFD+STZ/NA mice compared to controls (p,0.001 vs. Control
Vehicle). Furthermore, sEH inhibition with t-AUCB prevented the
perfusion deficit of the MCA territory during reperfusion in HFD+
STZ/NA mice (p,0.01 vs. HFD+STZ/NA Vehicle).

High Fat Diet Increases sEH mRNA and Protein
Expression in Brain

sEH Inhibition Prevented Type 2 Diabetes-induced
Increases in Infarct Size following MCAO

Using a rodent model of pre-diabetes, we aimed to determine if
sEH expression is altered in the pre-diabetic state, before
development of overt type 2 diabetes. The HFD model of prediabetes causes impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance,
without producing the overt hyperglycemia pathognomonic of
type 2 diabetes mellitus [19]. Long-term treatment (15 weeks) with
a high fat (60% fat) diet caused an increase in body weight
(Fig. 1A), an increase in insulin levels (Fig. 1B) and a decrease in
glucose tolerance (Fig. 1C–D) in high fat-fed compared to chowfed mice (p,0.001). Fig. 2A shows that, compared to chow-fed
mice, high fat diet-fed mice exhibited a 1.7 fold upregulation of
EPHX2 (gene encoding for sEH) mRNA in cortex (p,0.05).
Fig. 2B shows that sEH protein expression was also 20% higher in
brains of high fat-diet fed mice compared to chow-fed mice (p,
0.01). Despite changes in sEH expression, we did not detect
differences in EETs levels, measured via liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry [23], in brains of high fat diet-fed mice
compared to chow-fed mice (515+/262 pg/10 mg wet weight in
high fat diet group vs. 399+/213 pg/10 mg wet weight in chow
group, n = 4–5 per group).

Fig. 6 shows that HFD+STZ/NA vehicle-treated mice
sustained a 66% larger cortical infarct size and 55% larger total
hemisphere infarct size than control vehicle-treated mice (p,0.05).
To test whether inhibition of sEH in HFD+STZ/NA-treated mice
might decrease vulnerability to stroke, we blocked sEH activity
using the specific antagonist t-AUCB during the week before
MCAO. As stated above, treatment with t-AUCB decreased
fasting glucose levels at baseline and throughout ischemia and
improved reperfusion in the MCA territory in HFD+STZ/NA
mice. In line with these improvements in glycemic status and
cerebral perfusion, t-AUCB reduced cortical infarct size by 29%
and total hemisphere infarct size by 31% in HFD+STZ/NA mice
(p,0.05 vs. HFD+STZ/NA Vehicle, Fig. 6). Although the 1 mg/
kg t-AUCB dose was not sufficient to reduce infarct size in control
mice, a 2 mg/kg t-AUCB dose did decrease infarct size in control
mice compared to vehicle treated control mice in the cortex, the
striatum, and the total hemisphere (p,0.05 vs. HFD+STZ/NA
Vehicle, Fig. 7).

Discussion
The goal of this study was to determine if sEH inhibition, used
as a preventative treatment, could provide protection against
ischemic brain injury in type 2 diabetic mice. Previous studies have
shown that several animal models of diabetes increase infarct size
following cerebral ischemia [7–10], as we also observed in the
present study. Using a long-term high fat diet rodent model of prediabetes, our data show that pre-diabetes increases expression of
sEH mRNA and protein in brain, but does not significantly alter
EETs levels in brain. Using a rodent model of type 2 diabetes that
combines high fat diet with STZ/NA treatment, we further
demonstrated that sEH inhibition with t-AUCB decreases blood
glucose levels, increases cerebral perfusion, and decreases infarct
size in type 2 diabetic mice. Our findings show that sEH
inhibition, used as a preventative treatment, improves glycemic
status, post-ischemic reperfusion in the ischemic territory, and
stroke outcome in the setting of type 2 diabetes. However, based
on the current study we cannot determine the relative contribution, if any, of improvements glycemic status and cerebral
perfusion on stroke outcome. Future studies will address this issue
by experimentally controlling for blood glucose levels between
groups by co-administering t-AUCB with Metformin.
The current data support a novel role for sEH in both prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. We have previously shown that
hyperglycemia, caused by beta cell destruction with STZ, increases
EPHX2 expression in cerebral vessels and decreases EETs levels in
brain [8]. However, it was unclear if this effect could be elicited by
factors involved in the etiology of type 2 diabetes, other than
hyperglycemia. We used a long-term high fat diet to model prediabetes, a diet which increases body weight and impairs glucose
tolerance in the absence of overt resting hyperglycemia [19]. The
HFD mice exhibited hyperinsulinemia, which likely preserved
euglycemia in the absence of a glucose challenge. A similar

sEH Inhibition Attenuates Increases in Baseline Fasting
Blood Glucose Levels in Type 2 Diabetic Mice
HFD+STZ/NA was used to model type 2 diabetes. The main
endpoint diagnostic criterion for diabetes (either type 1 or type 2) is
hyperglycemia [24]. STZ alone induces type 1 diabetes by
destroying the pancreatic beta cells, causing insulinopenia and
consequent hyperglycemia, and this treatment may also cause a
decrease in body weight [20]. Co-administration of NA with STZ
attenuates the beta cell injury and prevents overt hyperglycemia
[20]. However, if STZ/NA are administered to mice on a high fat
diet, the NA is less able to protect the beta cells, resulting in the
constellation of hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and impaired
glucose tolerance [20]. This triad is the hallmark of type 2 diabetes
[24]. Notably, these treated mice also exhibit hyperlipidemia [20],
which is common in type 2 diabetic individuals. Table 1 shows
characteristics of study mice prior to MCAO, which did not differ
among groups in age, body weight, or temperature. HFD+STZ/
NA mice had increased fasting blood glucose levels compared to
control mice at baseline (p,0.001, Fig. 3A). The sEH inhibitor tAUCB reduced fasting blood glucose levels in HFD+STZ/NA
mice (p,0.05) but not in control mice (Fig. 3B). In addition to
baseline blood glucose levels, we also monitored blood glucose
levels throughout the MCAO surgery and measured insulin levels
24 h after ischemia. There were no differences in serum insulin
levels between groups (Fig. 3C). HFD+STZ/NA mice had
increased blood glucose levels compared to control mice before
MCAO, during the occlusion, and during reperfusion (p,0.001
vs. Control Vehicle, Fig. 4). Furthermore, t-AUCB treated HFD+
STZ/NA mice had decreased blood glucose levels compared to
vehicle-treated HFD+STZ/NA mice at each time point (p,0.01
vs. HFD+STZ/NA Vehicle, Fig. 4).

The first stage of pre-diabetes involves a long period of insulin

(GTT). As the disease progresses, the increased insulin secretion
progressively fails to compensate for the insulin resistance and
hyperglycemia ensues over time. Eventually, the beta cells cannot
produce enough insulin and hyperglycemia (type 2 diabetes) results
[25]. Using the HFD model, we show that pre-diabetes causes
increased EPHX2 gene expression as well as increased sEH
protein expression in brain. These data indicate that sEH is
elevated before the onset of type 2 diabetes. Surprisingly, despite
increased mRNA and protein levels of sEH, we did not detect a
statistically significant difference in EETs levels between chow and
HFD fed mice. In fact, there was a trend for higher EETs in mice
on HFD vs. normal chow. Because the level of EETs is regulated
both by their synthesis via P450 epoxygenase and their metabolism
via sEH, it is possible that EETs synthesis was increased to
compensate for an increase in sEH expression. In a similar model,
De Taeve et al. found that sEH mRNA and protein levels did not
differ, but sEH activity was higher in adipose tissue from obese
mice on ‘‘western-style’’ vs. regular diet [26]. If so, increased

vulnerability to stroke injury in rodents fed a high fat diet, either in
the presence (as we have observed) or absence of STZ/NA (as
others have observed [27]), may not necessarily be the result of
lower brain EETs, but rather to differences in insulin resistance
and glycemic status. It is important to note that our model of prediabetes included impaired glucose tolerance. Clinical studies in
pre-diabetic patients with impaired glucose tolerance show that
these patients are at increased risk for stroke, while studies that do
not include impaired glucose tolerance in their definition of prediabetes show less of an association [28].
Individuals with diabetes have more than twice the risk for
stroke compared to non-diabetic individuals [1]. The mechanisms
underlying increased ischemic sensitivity during the evolution of
type 2 diabetes are poorly understood and no therapeutic options
are currently available to reduce risk, other than weight reduction
and glycemic control. Although hyperglycemia is associated with
poor stroke outcome in both humans [2–4] and rodents [5–10],
tight glycemic control in hyperglycemic patients has failed to

protect against stroke incidence or improve outcome in clinical
trials [11–16]. Therefore, the goal the current study was determine
if sEH inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for type 2
diabetic stroke.
Our current data confirm that type 2 diabetes, induced by high
fat diet combined with STZ/NA treatment, enhances ischemic
injury in multiple brain regions. In addition we show that type 2
diabetes also causes a decrease in perfusion to the ischemic
territory following MCAO, suggesting that vascular mechanisms
are contributing to the enhanced susceptibility to ischemic injury
in the context of type 2 diabetes. This is in contrast to our previous
findings using a model of type 1 diabetes, induced by STZ, in
which we found that CBF and cortical perfusion were unaltered in
type 1 diabetic mice [8] compared to controls. In contrast to our
previous type 1 diabetes model in which STZ is administered
alone, in the current study nicotinamide, a B3 vitamin and
precursor to NAD+, was used to reduce the toxicity of STZ and
prevent large reductions in beta cell mass in mice fed a high fat

diet to more closely model type 2 diabetes[20]. The HFD+STZ/
NA mice did not exhibit a difference in circulating insulin
concentration compared to controls, most likely due to pancreatic
beta cell damage, as indicated by their relative hyperglycemia
compared to controls. Nakamura et al. have shown that
insulinemia is not altered by STZ/NA [20]. A similar phenomenon is observed clinically in many type 2 diabetic patients, in
which the pancreatic beta cells progressively fail to secrete
adequate insulin to maintain normal glycemic status, at which
time circulating insulin concentration is not elevated [24,25].
However, it should be noted that nicotinamide alone could also
have had neuroprotective effects through multiple mechanisms.
Nicotinamide has been shown to cross the blood brain barrier and
to improve mitochondrial function/ATP synthesis following
ischemia by acting as a PARP inhibitor [29]. Furthermore,
nicotinamide has also been shown to protect against ischemic
damage through the sirtuin-1 pathway [30]. However, these effects
are unlikely to have contributed substantially to ischemic outcome

in the current study, as the nicotinamide was administered two
weeks prior to ischemia and the STZ/NA group had larger, not
smaller, infarct size compared to controls. Nevertheless, important

differences underlying etiology of type 1 and type 2 diabetic stroke
may exist and warrant further investigation.

Type 2 Diabetes, sEH and Stroke

Other studies support our finding that vascular mechanisms
may contribute to enhanced injury in type 2 diabetic mice. For
example, using the db/db genetic model for type 2 diabetes, it was
found that diabetic male mice have decreased cerebrovascular
diameter, arteriolar density, and decreased blood brain barrier
function in the ischemic brain compared to wild type mice [31].
Using the Goto Kakaizaki rat model for type 2 diabetes, it has also
been shown that diabetes decreases vascular volume in the
ischemic cortex and striatum [32]. Taken together, these data
provide evidence that type 2 diabetic rodents have enhanced
injury after stroke that is mediated, in part, by vascular
dysfunction.
We have previously shown that sEH inhibition protects the
brain from ischemic injury by a mechanism linked to preservation
of EETs in non-diabetic mice [22], and more recently in type 1
diabetic mice [8]. Our current data show that sEH inhibition also
reduces infarct size in type 2 diabetic mice. Interestingly, t-AUCB
reduced infarct size in type 2 diabetic mice at a lower dose (1 mg/
kg) than the dose that was needed in control mice (2 mg/kg) to
elicit the same protective effect, suggesting that diabetic mice may
be more sensitive to the protective effects of sEH inhibition.
However, since we did not monitor serum levels of t-AUCB in
either cohort, a difference in pharmacokinetics between groups
cannot be ruled out. Another limitation of the current study is that
we did not assess functional outcomes of sEH inhibition following
stroke. In a previous study [22], we have shown that another sEH
inhibitor, AUDA-BE, was effective in reducing infarct when
administered after stroke. In the current study, sEH inhibitor was
administered before stroke, which has limited value as a stroke
therapy, but is ideal for determining the role of sEH in the
exacerbation of stroke injury in brains of type 2 diabetic mice,
which was the goal of the current study. Based on previous studies
in non-diabetic mice, it is possible that sEH inhibitors could also
attenuate neurological deficits following stroke [33], and we intend
to address this possibility in future studies. Nevertheless, we show
that sEH inhibition improves both glycemic status and cerebral
perfusion in the ischemic territory in type 2 diabetic mice when
administered as a pre-treatment. This is in contrast to our findings
in type 1 diabetic mice, in which sEH inhibition protected against
ischemic damage without altering glycemic status or early (5 min)
re-perfusion to the ischemic territory [8]. Therefore, sEH
inhibition appears to protect against type 1 and type 2 diabetic
stroke, at least in part, through different mechanisms. EETs can
provide neuroprotection by multiple mechanisms including:
enhancing vasodilation [17], inhibiting of platelet adhesion [34],
reducing inflammation [35], reducing of oxygen free radicals [36],
reducing apoptosis, or activating protective signal transduction
[17,37]. In line with this, we have previously shown that sEH
knockout mice are protected against ischemic injury in part due to
enhanced cerebral blood flow after MCAO [38]. It has also been
shown that EETs reduce ischemic injury by improving cerebrovascular structure and increasing microvascular density in
spontaneously hypertensive rats [33].
In addition to the protective effects of EETs outlined above,
EETs may have additional protective effects specifically in the
context of diabetes. Although we did not observe differences in
brain EETs levels in mice fed a high fat diet, sEH inhibition could
still be more protective in type 2 diabetic mice than control mice
because it could increase EETs in tissues other than the brain,
especially the pancreas, which as previously reported by Luria et
al. [39], would improve beta cell survival, insulin secretion and
glycemic status. In line with this, we observed improvements in
glycemic status consequent to sEH inhibition that could possibly
have contributed to reductions in infarct size and cerebral

perfusion. Since hyperglycemia is associated with poor stroke
outcome in both humans [2–4] and rodents [5–10], any reduction
in blood glucose levels may have also contributed to a reduction in
infarct size. Furthermore, hyperglycemia has been shown to
negatively affect cerebral vascular function and cerebral blood
flow after ischemia [40,41] in some studies, although others have
shown no effect [42,43]. Nevertheless, randomized prospective
clinical trials have consistently failed to demonstrate that tight
glycemic status improves outcome from stroke [12–16]. Similar to
the reduction in blood glucose levels, in the HFD+STZ/NA mice,
t-AUCB caused a 17% reduction in post-ischemic insulin levels
compared to vehicle-treated HFD+STZ/NA, although this effect
was not statistically significant. Likewise, enhancing EETs has
been shown to enhance insulin signaling and improve insulin
sensitivity [39,44–46]. Luo et al. showed that either deletion of the
sEH-coding gene or pharmacological inhibition of sEH attenuated
hyperglycemia in STZ-treated mice, a model for type 1 diabetes
[46]. They found that sEH inhibition improved STZ hyperglycemia by directly limiting STZ-mediated damage to pancreatic bcells [46]. Luria et al. demonstrated that either sEH inhibition or
sEH gene deletion reduces the severity of insulin resistance in mice
fed a HFD [39]. Specifically, they found that sEH inhibition/gene
deletion increased insulin receptor signaling, pancreatic islet size
and vascularization, glucose clearance during a glucose tolerance
test (GTT), and insulin sensitivity during an insulin tolerance test.
Thus, both the availability of insulin and the peripheral tissue
response to the insulin were both improved by limiting the
influence of sEH. They further showed that sEH gene deletion or
sEH inhibition yielded fasting glycemia that was lower during a
high-fat diet when compared to control animals on the same diet.
All of these effects occurred without a reduction in body mass or
adiposity, indicating that these are primary effects [39]. This
improvement in glucose homeostasis plays a role in the ability of
EETs to protect against diabetic cardiomyopathy [45]. Furthermore, glycemic control can improve vascularization, which is
needed for brain repair, in the ischemic cortex and striatum in
type 2 diabetic mice and enhance sensorimotor and cognitive
function recovery [32]. Future studies will determine if the ability
of sEH inhibition to improve glycemic control translates to
enhanced repair and recovery following cerebral ischemia via
vascular mechanisms, such as enhanced vascularization in the
ischemic territory.
In summary, we found that 1) pre-diabetes, induced by longterm high fat diet, increases expression of sEH mRNA and protein
but not EETs levels in brain, 2) type 2 diabetes, induced by a
combination of high fat diet and STZ/NA, exacerbates cerebral
infarct size after MCAO in mice, and 3) sEH inhibition with tAUCB, when administered prior to the ischemic event, improves
glycemic status, increases cerebral perfusion, and reduces brain
infarct size after MCAO. These findings indicate sEH inhibition
improves stroke outcome, glycemic status, and post-ischemic
perfusion in the ischemic territory in setting of type 2 diabetes.
This data suggest that sEH inhibition may be a potential
preventative therapeutic target for improving stroke outcome in
individuals with type 2 diabetes who are at increased risk for stroke
[1].
