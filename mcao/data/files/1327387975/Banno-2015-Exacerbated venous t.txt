Key Points

Introduction
Protein S (PS) is a vitamin K–dependent plasma glycoprotein that is
mainly synthesized in liver and endothelial cells. PS acts as an anticoagulant cofactor for activated protein C (APC) in the proteolytic inactivation of factor Va (FVa) and factor VIIIa (FVIIIa) and negatively
regulates blood coagulation.1,2 In human plasma, ;60% of PS forms
a complex with C4b binding protein (C4BP), and the formation of this
complex abolishes the APC cofactor activity of PS. PS also acts as
a cofactor for tissue factor pathway inhibitor during the inhibition of
factor Xa (FXa) in human plasma, but this cofactor activity has not been
detected in mouse plasma.3
PS deﬁciency is a risk factor for developing venous thromboembolism (VTE).4 Homozygous or compound heterozygous PS deﬁciency is an extremely rare disorder that causes purpura fulminans in
affected newborns.5 Heterozygous PS deﬁciency is milder but ﬁrmly
associated with an increased risk of VTE.4 The risk of thrombosis in
individuals with PS deﬁciency is increased with other genetic or
acquired factors predisposing to thrombosis.
A rare variant in the PS gene, PROS1, that is present in 1.8% of
Japanese, which causes a Lys196 to Glu substitution in PS (PS-K196E,
rs 121918474, c.586A.G, also known as PS Tokushima,6 PS-K155E

in the mature protein numbering7) is a genetic risk factor for VTE in the
Japanese population (odds ratio 5 3.7-8.6).8-11 The K196E mutation
in PS is located in the second epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like
domain.2,7,9,11-14 We estimate that ;1 out of every 12 000 Japanese individuals is homozygous for the 196E allele, representing a total of as
many as 10 000 individuals.13 Thus, a substantial number of Japanese
carry the mutant PS 196E allele, as a heterozygote or homozygote, and
a likely risk of development of VTE. The phenotype-genotype analysis
in individuals with PS-K196E mutation showed that heterozygotes
had 16% lower PS anticoagulant activity than wild-type individuals,
although the anticoagulant activities between heterozygotes and wildtypes are substantially overlapped.12 PS-K196E mutation appears to be
a genetic risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) during pregnancy,15 and
PS-K196E mutation concomitant with other predisposing mutations for
thrombosis was found in patients with VTE.16 This mutation, however,
did not increase the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes deﬁned by
2 or more miscarriages, fetal growth restriction, and/or intrauterine fetal
death.17 PS-K196E mutation seems to be Japanese speciﬁc, because the
mutation has not been observed in the white, Chinese, or Korean
populations.11,18,19

BANNO et al

Racial differences in the genetic background of venous thrombosis
have been well documented.20 As an example, the factor V (FV) Leiden
mutation, R506Q, that is a VTE risk factor is predominantly found in
white populations.21 This mutation renders FVa resistant to the inactivation by APC, resulting in a hypercoagulable state.22,23 A mouse
model carrying the homologous murine FV Leiden mutation (R504Q)
showed enhanced venous thrombosis, consistent with an increased
incidence of VTE in human FV Leiden carriers.24,25 Thus, FV Leiden
mice provide a valuable in vivo model of thrombosis-associated diseases in whites and have been studied under various stimulations or
pathophysiologic conditions.25-27
Recent guidelines for establishing pathogenic causality of rare
genetic variants emphasize that the strongest evidence for causality
comes from disruption of the candidate gene in a model organism (eg,
a mouse) that recapitulates the pathology in humans.20 Hence, we
generated a mouse colony carrying the PS-K196E mutation. Based on
PS-knockout (PS-KO) studies,3,28 homozygous PS deﬁciency in mice
leads to embryonic lethality with a fulminant coagulopathy and hemorrhages. Heterozygous PS-deﬁcient mice had reduced plasma PS
antigen levels and APC cofactor activity, and they survived to adulthood
but showed severe thrombosis after induction of pulmonary embolism
(PE) by injection of tissue factor.
In the present study, we generated PS-K196E knockin mice and
analyzed their phenotypes, comparing with heterozygous PS-deﬁcient
mice and FV-R504Q knock-in mice. Our data show that the PS-K196E
mutation in mice increases the risk of thrombotic diseases, proving the
pathogenic causality of this mutation beyond doubt. The PS K196E
mice may be valuable for future pathogenic studies related to venous
thrombosis.

incubation with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-human PS prepared using
Peroxidase Labeling Kit-NH2 (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) for 1 hour. Bound
antibody was detected using SureBlue Reserve TMB Microwell Peroxidase
Substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) as absorbance
change at 450 nm. The PS level measured in wild-type mouse plasma was
arbitrarily deﬁned as 100%.
APC cofactor activity analysis of recombinant mouse PS
proteins in vitro
Recombinant mouse wild-type PS and PS-K196E mutant proteins were made as
described.33 SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions revealed that the
recombinant proteins were ;95% pure (data not shown). APC cofactor activity
of recombinant PS was determined by modiﬁed APTT and FXa 1-stage clotting
assays as described previously.33 In a modiﬁed APTT assay, 10 mL normal
mouse pooled plasma (BioreclamationIVT, Baltimore, MD), 5 mL human ﬁbrinogen (2 mg/mL; Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN), 25 mL
recombinant mouse APC (36 nM), 25 mL recombinant mouse PS (0, 3.38, 6.75,
13.5, and 27 nM), and 25 mL APTT-XL (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham,
MA) were mixed and incubated for 3 minutes at 37°C. The clotting time was
recorded after adding 25 mL CaCl2 (25 mM). In an FXa 1-stage clotting assay,
10 mL normal mouse pooled plasma, 25 mL of a mixture (4:1) of phospholipid
vesicles (25 mM, 80% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine/20%
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine; Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster,
AL) plus human ﬁbrinogen (2 mg/mL), 25 mL recombinant mouse APC
(53 nM), 25 mL recombinant mouse PS (0, 0.63, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 nM), and
25 mL mouse FXa (Haematologic Technologies, Essex Junction, VT) were
mixed and incubated for 3 minutes at 37°C. The clotting time was recorded after
adding 25 mL CaCl2 (25 mM). Each assay was performed in triplicate. The APC
cofactor activity of recombinant mouse PS was evaluated based on the slope of
a linear increase in clotting time with the dosage of recombinant mouse PS.

Materials and methods
Generation of PS-K196E knockin mice and PS-KO mice, genetic
analysis, and RNA analysis
The targeting vector was introduced into 129/SvEvTac-derived embryonic stem
cells by electroporation.29-32 The male chimeras were bred to wild-type C57BL/6J
females and F1 offspring with the PS-K196E mutation or PS deﬁciency were
backcrossed to C57BL/6J mice (Japan SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan) for 10 generations. The detailed materials and methods are described in the supplemental Data
(available on the Blood Web site). All animal procedures were approved by the
Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular
Center and performed in accordance with institutional and national guidelines
and regulations.
Plasma APC cofactor activity and PS antigen assays
Blood was collected from anesthetized mice via the retro-orbital plexus into tubes
containing a 0.1 volume of 3.8% sodium citrate. Plasma was prepared from blood
by centrifugation at 1000g for 10 minutes.
Plasma APC cofactor activity was measured by an activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)-based clotting assay using a recombinant mouse APC.33
Plasma samples (40 mL) were pretreated with 450 nM recombinant mouse APC
or Owren-Koller buffer (10 mL) for 1 min at 37°C. STA-Cephascreen reagent
(50 mL; Diagnostica Stago, Asnières-sur-Seine, France) was added and incubated
for 3 min at 37°C. The clotting time was recorded using a coagulometer
(STart4; Diagnostica Stago) after adding 25 mM CaCl2 (50 mL). The prolongation
of clotting time by the addition of APC to wild-type plasma was considered as
100% APC cofactor activity.
Plasma PS antigens were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
using antibodies against human PS. Plasma samples in 0.5% bovine serum albumin were applied to rabbit anti–human PS-coated (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark)
microwell plates for 2 hours at room temperature. Bound PS was detected by

A mouse DVT model of electrolytic inferior vena cava (IVC) injury was
performed according to the method of Diaz et al, with minor modiﬁcations.34,35
Mice were anesthetized with 2.5% 2,2,2-tribromoethanol and kept around 37°C
using a heating pad (Bio Research Center, Nagoya, Japan). The IVC was exposed
through a midline laparotomy, and all side branches between the renal and iliac
veins were ligated with a 7-0 polypropylene suture. An anode of 27G stainlesssteel needle electrode (NE-115B; Nihon Koden, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted into
the caudal IVC and attached to the anterior wall. A cathode was inserted
subcutaneously to complete a circuit. A direct current of 200 mA was applied for
10 minutes using an electric stimulator (SEN-3041; Nihon Koden) with an
isolator unit (SS-203J; Nihon Koden). After current load, the needle was gently
removed from the IVC and the abdomen was closed by polyglycolic acid suture
and cyanoacrylate glue. At 2 days postsurgery, blood was collected and platelet
counts were determined using an automatic cell counter (KX-21NV; Sysmex,
Kobe, Japan). Thrombi formed in the IVC were removed, weighed in wet
condition, and photographed using a digital microscope (VHX-1000; Keyence,
Osaka, Japan). Plasma thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and interleukin-6
(IL-6) levels were measured using an Enzygnost TAT micro kit (Siemens AG,
Munich, Germany) and a BD OptEIA mouse IL-6 ELISA kit (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA), respectively.
PE models
A recombinant human tissue factor (TF) reagent (Dade Innovin) containing
phospholipids and calcium was purchased from Siemens AG. A high-molecularweight polyphosphate (HMW polyP) was prepared as reported by Smith et al.36
Sodium metaphosphate (Sigma-Aldrich Japan, Tokyo, Japan) was washed twice
with puriﬁed water and solubilized in 250 mM LiCl. The soluble HMW polyP
(40-1200 phosphate units long) was precipitated by adding 2.5 volumes of
acetone and dissolved in puriﬁed water. The concentrations of HMW polyP were
determined as phosphate monomer using BIOMOL Green reagent (Enzo Life
Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) after complete hydrolysis in 1 N HCl.
Mice were anesthetized with 2.5% 2,2,2-tribromoethanol, and 15 mL/g body
weight of the TF reagent (1/30 dilution) or HMW polyP (1.67 g/L) was infused
into the IVC.37 The dose of TF and HMW polyP was chosen such that ;20% of

wild-type mice survived after the infusion. Survival time was recorded until 20
minutes after the infusion, while deﬁning death as respiratory arrest that persisted
for at least 2 minutes. Two minutes after the respiratory arrest (but while the heart
was still beating) or at the completion of the 20-minute observation period, mice
were perfused with 0.5 mL 1% Evans blue via right ventricle. Lungs were
excised, photographed, and scored for Evans blue perfusion defects using a
scoring scale (from 0 for no occlusion to 4 for complete occlusion). The scores
were evaluated by 2 individuals anonymously.
Transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion model
Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced using the 3-vessel occlusion
technique as described previously.38,39 In brief, the left common carotid artery
was isolated and occluded by a vascular clip (1-vessel occlusion [1-VO]) under
halothane inhalation-anesthesia. A skin incision was made at the midpoint
between the left orbit and the external auditory canal. After the removal of the
zygomatic bone and downward retraction of the mandibular bone, a craniectomy
was made using an electric drill. The distal M1 portion of left MCA, peripheral to
the perforating arteries of the basal ganglia, was permanently occluded (2-vessel
occlusion [2-VO]) by electrocauterization and cut at the lateral edge of the
olfactory tract. Finally, the right common carotid artery was occluded (3-vessel
occlusion [3-VO]) using a vascular clip. After 15-minute focal ischemia induced
by the 3-VO, 2 clips at the common carotid arteries were removed to establish
reperfusion through the collateral arteries (the source of the vascular reserve)
distal to the 1-VO in the cortex. During the operation, blood pressure was monitored by an indirect blood pressure meter (BP-98A; Softron, Tokyo, Japan) and
rectal temperature was regulated within the range of 36.5 to 37.5°C by a temperature controller (NS-TC10; Neuroscience, Tokyo, Japan). After 24 hours,
neurologic deﬁcits were assessed using a scoring scale (from 0 to 4) as described
previously,38,39 and the brains were excised and stained with 2,3,5-triphenyl
tetrazolium chloride. The infarcted and the total hemispheric areas of each section
were measured using a computer-assisted image-analysis system (WinROOF;
Mitani, Tokyo, Japan).31,39 The infarct volume was adjusted for edema by dividing
the volume by the edema index (left hemisphere volume/right hemisphere volume).
Statistical analysis
Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed by the 1-way analysis of variance
followed by the post hoc Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. Data for
nonnormal and nonparametric distributions were assessed by the Kruskal-Wallis
test followed by the post hoc Dunn’s multiple comparison test. Survival rates
were analyzed by the Mantel-Cox log-rank test. Differences were considered to
be signiﬁcant at P , .05.

Results
Generation of PS-K196E and PS-KO mice

To generate PS-K196E mice, we introduced the K196E mutation into
the endogenous Pros1 gene by homologous recombination (supplemental Figure 1A). We conﬁrmed the expected structure of the targeted
locus by polymerase chain reaction (data not shown) and Southern
blotting (supplemental Figure 1B). Pros1 messenger RNA was detected in PS-K196E mice with normal sizes (;3.5 kb) and amounts by
the northern blot analysis of liver total RNA (supplemental Figure 1C).
Expression of the mutant messenger RNA in PS-K196E mice was
veriﬁed by the appearance of 238-bp and 171-bp fragments in reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction products after digestion with NruI
(supplemental Figure 1D) and by direct sequencing of the products. To
generate PS-KO mice, we disrupted the Pros1 gene in a similar manner
using a targeting vector that eliminated exon 3 (supplemental Figure 2).
Genotyping of 299 offspring by intercrosses in heterozygous
PS-K196E (Pros11/E) mice showed the expected 1:2:1 Mendelian
distribution of Pros11/1 (82/299, 27.4%), Pros1 1/E (149/299,
49.8%), and Pros1E/E (68/299, 22.7%). Pros1E/E mice were viable

and fertile. In contrast, no Pros12/2 pups were obtained in a total of
316 pups from Pros11/2 intercrosses, as previously reported.3,28
Pros11/1 and Pros11/2 mice were born in the 1:2 distribution
(109/316 [34.5%] and 207/316 [65.5%], respectively) by Pros11/2 mice
intercrosses, and Pros11/2 mice grew normally. Thus, although PS
is essential for embryonic development in mice, the homozygous
PS-K196E mutation did not cause embryonic lethality. In addition,
Pros1E/2 mice were viable when Pros1E/E mice were bred with
Pros11/2 mice.
Plasma APC cofactor activities and PS antigens in PS-K196E
and PS-KO mice

We measured plasma APC cofactor activity by an APTT-based clotting
assay in the absence and presence of recombinant mouse APC as
previously reported.33 The APC cofactor activity determined from
the prolongation of clotting time by APC was signiﬁcantly reduced in
Pros11/E, Pros1E/E, and Pros11/2 mice compared with Pros11/1 mice
(Figure 1A). Similar to human Pros11/E subjects, Pros11/E mice had
;18% lower activity (82.0% 6 9.5%, mean 6 SD) than Pros11/1 mice
(100% 6 18.0%). More severe reductions in the activity were observed
in Pros1E/E (67.1% 6 7.8%) and Pros11/2 (54.3% 6 8.3%) mice.
Basal APTT values in the absence of added APC were not different

among the mouse groups (Pros11/1, 23.3 6 0.6 s; Pros11/E, 23.3 6 0.6 s;
Pros1E/E, 23.3 6 0.6 s; Pros11/2, 23.3 6 0.6 s).
The plasma PS antigen levels were normal in Pros11/E mice
(98.2% 6 7.9%) and Pros1E/E (95.7% 6 6.4%) mice, indicating that
PS-K196E mutant was normally secreted into blood but had reduced
APC anticoagulant cofactor activity (Figure 1B). In contrast, the PS
antigen levels were reduced in Pros11/2 mice (57.7% 6 3.5%), corresponding to around 50% reduction in the APC cofactor activity.
In vitro APC cofactor activity of recombinant mouse
PS-K196E mutant

To characterize further the effect of K196E mutation on the anticoagulant activity of PS, we prepared recombinant mouse wild-type PS
and the PS-K196E mutant and compared their APC cofactor activities
using 2 different in vitro assays. In a modiﬁed APTT assay, PS-K196E
showed 60% APC cofactor activity compared with wild-type PS
(Figure 2A). In an FXa 1-stage clotting assay, PS-K196E similarly
showed 49% APC cofactor activity compared with wild-type PS
(Figure 2B). Thus, the puriﬁed PS-K196E mutant had 49% to 60% of
normal PS APC cofactor activity.
Exacerbation of VTE in PS-K196E mice

To investigate the effects of PS-K196E mutation on VTE, we performed DVT and PE model experiments. In the DVT model experiment, we applied the electrolytic IVC injury to Pros11/1, Pros11/E,
Pros1E/E, Pros11/2, and homozygous FV-R504Q (FvQ/Q) mice. In this
model, thrombus formation under continuous blood ﬂow is induced by
endothelial activation at the site of anodal electrolysis and thrombi grow
to a maximum size at 2 days after the injury.34 In this study, we applied
milder electrolytic stimulation (200 mA, 10 minutes) than that of the
original method (250 mA, 15 minutes) to adequately assess prothrombotic states in mice. We measured thrombus weight in IVC at 2 days
after the injury and found enhanced thrombus formation in Pros1E/E,
Pros11/2, and FvQ/Q mice compared with Pros11/1mice (Figure 3A).
Accompanying the increase in thrombus weight, peripheral platelet
counts were decreased, and plasma TAT and IL-6 levels were increased
in Pros1E/E, Pros11/2, and FvQ/Q mice compared with Pros11/1 mice
(Figure 3B-D). In Pros11/E mice, thrombus weight, plasma TAT, and
IL-6 levels were modestly, although not signiﬁcantly, increased and
platelet counts were signiﬁcantly decreased compared with Pros11/1
mice. Platelet counts, plasma TAT, and IL-6 levels in nontreated mice
were not different among the mouse groups. IL-6 has been shown to play
a key role in promoting inﬂammation in mouse DVT models.40,41 Thus,
these results suggest that PS-K196E mutation in mice promotes venous
thrombus formation accompanied by enhancement of coagulation and
inﬂammatory responses.
In the PE model experiments, we infused recombinant human TF or
HMW polyP into mouse IVC. PolyP is a linear polymer of inorganic
phosphates that is ubiquitous from bacteria to humans. PolyP acts as a
natural negatively charged surface that activates the intrinsic pathway
of blood coagulation.36 After the induction of PE in mice by TF or
HMW polyP, we evaluated the 20-minute survival (Figure 4A-B,
respectively). Using a scoring scale from no occlusion (score 0) to
complete occlusion (score 4) (Figure 4C), we determined the degree of
lung vascular occlusion by perfusion with Evans blue (Figure 4D-E).
The survival was signiﬁcantly reduced in Pros11/E, Pros1E/E, Pros11/2,
and FvQ/Q mice compared with Pros11/1 mice in both TF-induced
and HMW polyP-induced PE models. The lung perfusion defect score
was inversely correlated with survival and signiﬁcantly increased in
Pros1E/E, Pros11/2, and FvQ/Q mice after TF-induced PE, and in Pros11/E,
Pros1E/E, Pros11/2, and FvQ/Q mice after HMW polyP-induced PE.

PS (d) or PS-K196E (n) were added to normal mouse pooled plasma, and a modified
APTT clotting assay was performed in the presence of recombinant mouse APC. (B)
FXa 1-stage clotting assay. Increasing concentrations of recombinant mouse WT PS (d)
or PS-K196E (n) were added to normal mouse pooled plasma, and an FXa 1-stage
clotting assay was performed in the presence of recombinant mouse APC. Each assay
was performed in triplicate, and data are shown as mean 6 SD.

These results suggest that the PS-K196E mutation in mice increases
lung vascular occlusion and mortality after induction of PE.
No exacerbation of ischemic stroke in PS-K196E mice

To examine the effects of PS-K196E mutation on arterial ischemic
diseases, transient MCA ischemia-reperfusion injury was applied in mice
using the 3-VO technique. We previously observed that both FvQ/1 and
FvQ/Q mice showed increased infarct volumes compared with wild-type
mice 24 hours after the ischemia-reperfusion injury induced by the
same technique.42 However, infarct volumes 24 hours after ischemia in
Pros11/E, Pros1E/E, and Pros11/2 mice were not different from those in
Pros11/1 mice (Figure 5). The edema index and the neurologic deﬁcit
score were also not different among the mouse groups (data not shown).
These results suggest that PS-K196E mutation in mice does not cause
aggravation of ischemic stroke, unlike FV Leiden mutation.

Discussion
To assess the pathogenic causality of the PS K196E mutation for venous
thrombosis, we established colonies of PS-K196E knockin mice and
PS-KO mice.43 Plasma from PS-K196E homozygous mice had 67%
of normal APC cofactor activity, similar to puriﬁed recombinant murine PS-K196E that had 49% to 60% APC cofactor activity. Mouse
C4BP does not contain the PS-binding subunit, the b-chain, which is

a pseudogene in mice,44 so interpretation of APC cofactor activity
is uncomplicated by C4BP considerations. The susceptibility of
PS-K196E mice to venous thrombosis was determined in multiple
models, including (1) an electrolytic IVC model of venous thrombosis
that produces a nonocclusive and consistent IVC thrombus in the presence of constant blood ﬂow, (2) TF-initiated pulmonary thrombosis, and
(3) HMW-polyP–initiated pulmonary thrombosis. All thrombotic biomarkers or parameters in these thrombosis injury models, including
mortality, showed that the PS-K196E mutation caused increased venous
thrombosis, generally very similar to PS heterozygosity and to the
murine FV Leiden mutation. Heterozygosity for this PS mutation gave

a milder thrombotic phenotype than PS mutant homozygosity. These
results unambiguously demonstrate a causal link between the PS-K196E
mutation and thrombophilia, strongly supporting the PS-K196E mutation as a human genetic risk factor for VTE.8-11
The PS lysine residue 196 is located in the second EGF-like domain,
and it is highly conserved in PS from human, chimpanzee, rhesus
monkey, mouse, rat, opossum, cattle, dog, pig, chicken, and Xenopus,
indicating its importance for the PS function. Based on modeling of the
tertiary structure of the second EGF-like domain of PS, Lys-196 is on
the surface of the molecule,2 where it likely interacts with APC.
Consistent with this interpretation for the molecular defect of PS-K196E,

Five rare genetic race-speciﬁc variants linked to VTE risk include
PS-K196E in Japanese, FV Leiden and prothrombin II ntG20210A in
whites, and R189W-protein C and del-Lys193-protein C in Chinese.11
Whether these mutations have been deleterious or advantageous
during evolution is unclear. Each mutation, whether a gain of
function or a loss of function, causes increased thrombin generation
that may prevent bleeding and achieve hemostasis or increase
thrombosis risk. Even today, as in ancient history, bleeding is the
leading cause of maternal death linked to childbirth in the absence
of modern medical care.50 Thus, the PS-K196E, like the other 4
VTE-linked mutations, on balance may have beneﬁted the Japanese
population historically by reducing maternal death, although it
increased VTE risk. If so, this PS-K196E Japanese mutation has
been advantageous since its ﬁrst occurrence after divergence of the
Japanese population from other populations and during its subsequent adaptive evolution.
In summary, the murine PS-K196E mutation similarly reduces its
APC anticoagulant cofactor activity in plasma and in puriﬁed systems,
and PS-K196E mice and heterozygous PS deﬁciency are more vulnerable to venous thrombosis than wild-type mice, proving pathogenic
causality for the K196E mutation. Thus, PS-K196E mice may provide
a novel murine resource for studies of thrombosis in vivo that may assist
deﬁning race-dependent, PS-dependent pathophysiological mechanisms for thrombosis in humans.

monoclonal antibodies were made that recognize the PS-196E epitope,46
indicating that residue 196 is likely exposed on the PS surface.
Currently, the extent to which the PS-K196E mutation or PS
deﬁciency are risk factors for arterial occlusive diseases is not clear. To
explore the arterial occlusive risk of these PS genetic variations, we
used a cerebral focal ischemia-reperfusion model. Because of some
limitations of the nylon-thread–induced ischemia/reperfusion MCA
occlusion brain injury methodology,46 we employed the 3-VO technique for rodent ischemic stroke.38,39 This method consists of temporary
occlusion of both common carotid arteries in conjunction with permanent unilateral occlusion of an MCA. The method does not use any
foreign materials to occlude the lumen of the vessels and consistently
produces focal ischemia, regional cerebral blood ﬂow that is .10% but
,20%, and adequate reperfusion in the cortex, achieving good reproducibility for the homogeneous development of cortical infarction.39
When this method was used to evaluate the susceptibility of PS-K196E
mice and PS-KO mice to cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, we
found that these PS-modiﬁed mice did not show any increase in brain
infarct volume compared with wild-type control mice. PS protects
neurons from ischemic injury in mouse stroke models.47 Therefore,
mice with decreased APC cofactor activity might have been expected to
show an aggravation of ischemic stroke, but it was not the case, indicating that the PS-K196E mutation and heterozygosity for wild-type
PS do not compromise endogenous PS neuroprotective mechanisms.
Because the neuroprotective effects of PS are mediated through its
sex-hormone–binding globulin-like region,48 we speculate that the
PS-K196E mutant with the intact sex-hormone–binding globulin-like
region retains its neuroprotective actions. Moreover, the neuroprotective effects of pharmacologic APC are based on APC’s cell-signaling
actions, not on its anticoagulant actions, so loss of APC anticoagulant
cofactor activity might not compromise endogenous neuroprotection.49
