SUMMARY
Background: Recent studies have indicated that dynamic alterations in the structure of
postsynaptic density (PSD) are involved in the pathogenesis of many central nervous system
disorders, including ischemic stroke. Homer is the newly identified scaffolding protein
located at PSD and regulates synaptic function. Homer1a, an immediate early gene, has
been shown to be induced by several stimulations, such as glutamate, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and trauma. However, whether acidosis mediated by acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) and hypoxia during cerebral ischemia can change Homer1a expression
remains to be determined. Results: We investigated that acidosis and hypoxia selectively
and rapidly upregulated Homer1a expression, but not Homer1b/c in cultured cortical neurons. We also found that Homer1a exhibited induction expression in brain cortex of the
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats. Additionally, acid-evoked Homer1a mRNA
induction depended on extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) and Akt activity,
and ASIC1a-mediated calcium influx whereas hypoxia depended only on ERK1/2 activity.
Also, we demonstrated that continuous acidosis and hypoxia resulted in pronounced cell
injury and Homer1a knockdown with small interfering RNA aggravated this damage
induced by 3 h acid and hypoxia incubation in neuro-2a cells. Conclusion: Homer1a
might act as an activity-dependent regulator responding to extracellular stimuli during cerebral ischemia.

Introduction
The postsynaptic density (PSD) is a specialized structure which is
present in the postsynaptic membrane in the central nervous system (CNS) and enriched in excitatory glutamate receptors, cytoskeletal and scaffolding proteins. It was previously reported that
protein-protein interactions and gene induction expression enable
the PSD apparatus to become a dynamic structure. Dynamic alterations of PSD are suggested to be involved in the regulation of
synaptic function and plasticity, and be implicated in the development of many CNS disorders, such as ischemic stroke [1]. Emerging evidence suggests that cerebral ischemia and reperfusion
induces biological and morphological alterations of PSD [2]. Takagi et al. [1] reported that transient global ischemia resulted in
altered interaction between the postsynaptic protein PSD-95 and
ionotropic glutamate receptor NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate).

Another study revealed that PSD-95 inhibitor that disrupted PSD95/MNDA interaction provided neuroprotection by reducing
infarct volumes and improving neurobehavioral functions [3].
These findings demonstrate that the dynamic alterations in the
PSD during cerebral ischemia are related to synaptic disturbance
and neuronal death [4]. Thus, understanding the molecular
mechanisms of dynamic modifications in the PSD fraction is
assumed to contribute to developing an appropriate strategy for
the treatment of cerebral stroke.
Homer family proteins, the recently discovered scaffolding proteins, are concentrated at PSD fraction and encoded by three
genes, including Homer1, 2, and 3. This family of proteins consists
of two major groups: the long- and short-form proteins. The long
form of Homer proteins such as Homer1b/c is constitutively
expressed and encodes a C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain that
mediates self-multimerization. Conversely, the short form of pro-

tein Homer1a identified as an immediate early gene (IEG) lacks
the CC domain and possesses a characteristic repeat of the AU-rich
motif, which is implicated in the destabilization of short-lived
mRNAs [5]. All of the Homer proteins share a conserved N-terminal Ena/VASP homology 1 (EVH 1) domain that directly interacts
with group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRIs), inositol
1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R), and indirectly with NMDA
receptor through Shank family proteins, and facilitates the assembly of signaling complexes [6–8]. Homer1a has also been shown to
be rapidly transcribed followed by the neural activity, such as glutamate, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and trauma
[9,10]. Increased Homer1a functions as a negative regulator that
disassembles multimerization and uncouples protein signaling
complexes mediated by Homer proteins [5]. Indeed, these results
imply that Homer1a plays an essential role in the activity-dependent synaptic reorganization [11]. Additionally, we have earlier
demonstrated that the dynamic alterations of PSD are implicated
in the pathological mechanisms of cerebral ischemia and acidosis
mediated by acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) and hypoxia are
the well established features of ischemic stroke [1,12]. Hence, it is
of great interest to investigate the regulation of Homer1a expression after exposure to acid and hypoxia.
This study sought to investigate the effects of acidosis mediated
by ASICs activation and hypoxia on Homer1a expression and
probe the underlying mechanisms of this induction. To eliminate
the potential secondary activation of glutamate and voltagedependent calcium channels, blockers for NMDA and AMPA
receptors and voltage-gated calcium channels were present in the
acid-treated cells [12,13]. Here, we observed that acidosis and
hypoxia displayed the capability to significantly upregulate
Homer1a levels in cultured cortical neurons. Homer1a was also
largely induced after reperfusion in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats. Additionally, acidosis-mediated Homer1a
mRNA induction may depend on more signaling pathways than
hypoxia, and exposure to acid and hypoxia resulted in robust cell
insults which were exacerbated after downregulating Homer1a
expression in neuro-2a cells. Thus, Homer1a might function as an
activity-dependent factor in response to extracellular stimuli during cerebral ischemia.

Cells Cultures and Transfection
Sprague–Dawley rats and neuro-2a cells were purchased from
Shanghai Institute of Chinese Academy of Science. All the procedures complied with the standards for the Guide for Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals and were approved by the local animal ethics
committee. Rat primary cortical neurons and neuro-2a cells were
cultured as previously described [12,14].
The small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes targeting mouse
Homer1a mRNA were synthesized in (Invitrogen Grand Island,
NY, USA). The control siRNAs with a nontargeting sequence for
mouse were purchased from Invitrogen. The siRNAs were transfected with FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Hypoxia and Acidosis Insults
The original oxygen and glucose-containing media was removed
from the dishes. Cells were incubated with deoxygenated glucosefree ECF at pH 7.4 in an anaerobic chamber whereas cells-treated
with acid were incubated with ECF at pH 6.0 in a normoxic incubator. MES was used for more reliable pH buffering. All treatments were terminated after 90 min, adding the original media
and incubating the cultures in the normoxic incubator. ECF contained (in mM) 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 25 HEPES, 20 glucose, 1.3
CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, 0.0005 TTX (pH 7.4), 320–335 mOsm.

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed as previously described [15].

Drug Treatments
To suppress the potential secondary activation of glutamate
NMDA and AMPA receptors and voltage-gated calcium channels,
MK-801 (10 lM), CNQX (20 lM), and nimodipine (5 lM) were
added together to the culture medium in acid-treated cells
[12,13]. To determine whether ASIC1a-mediated calcium influx
played a vital role in Homer1a mRNA induction, PcTX1 (100 ng/
mL), a specific ASIC1a blocker, amiloride (100 lM), a nonspecific
ASICs blocker, or EGTA (2 mM), a calcium chelator, was applied
30 min before and the duration of acidosis insults. To study the
role of ERK1/2 and PI3K-Akt signaling cascades blockade in the
effects of acidosis and hypoxia on Homer1a mRNA induction, the
cells subjected to acidosis or hypoxia were pre-incubated with
MEK (Mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase) inhibitor
PD98059 (10 lM) or PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 lM) for
30 min.

ing to the applied instructions. The following primers were used:
for Homer1a, forward 5′-ACCAGAAAGTATCAATGGGACA-3′ and
reverse 5′-GCACAGCGTTTG CTTGACTA-3′; for Homer1b/c, forward 5′-ACACTGTTTATGGACTGGGATT-3′ and reverse 5′GCACAGCGTTTGCTTGACT A-3′.

Western Blotting
Cells were lysed, separated by 10% SDS–PAGE, and subsequently
transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The polypeptides were exposed to rabbit anti-Homer (1:1000), anti-pERK1/2 (1:2000), or anti-p-Akt (1:2000) antibodies for 2 h and
goat antirabbit secondary antibody (1:1000) for 1 h.

Cell Injury Assay-LDH Measurement
Cell injury was determined by the measurement of LDH release in
various treatments. The amount of LDH released into the medium
was determined using the LDH Detection Kit as previously
described [12].

Cell Viability Assay
Cell viability was assayed with the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8)
according to the supplier recommendations. The results were
expressed as the percentage of viable cells relative to control
group.
Three dishes were used for each group in the experiments of
induction expression whereas eight dishes were used in LDH
release and cell viability assay. Each experiment was conducted
for three or eight times, respectively.

Statistical Analysis
Results were expressed as mean  SD. Statistical analyses were
performed by one-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc tests for multiple comparisons. Unpaired Student’s t-tests were used for comparisons of two groups only. P < 0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.

Results
Acidosis Preferentially and Substantially
Upregulates Homer1a mRNA Levels
Previous studies have demonstrated that Homer1a as an IEG can
be regulated in an activity-dependent manner [10]. Acidosis and
hypoxia have been shown to be the common features of ischemia
stroke [12]. To explore the potential role of Homer1a in cerebral
ischemia, in the present study, we first sought to determine
whether acidosis had an effect on Homer1a expression. Rat cortical neurons were treated with acid for 90 min in the presence of
blockers for NMDA and AMPA receptors and voltage-gated calcium channels. Homer1a mRNA expression was examined at the
time points after 90 min acid incubation. As shown in Figure 1A,
B, Homer1a mRNA level was significantly upregulated instantly
after acid stimulation. This induction peaked at 3 h and gradually
restored to the normal level at 12 h after 90 min acid stimulation.

J.-J. Su et al.

Conversely, no significant changes in Homer1b/c mRNA level
were observed despite a fairly small increase at 1 h after acid treatment. The results from Western blot analysis indicated that treatment of cells with 90 min acid markedly increased Homer1a
protein levels which peaked at 3 h and gradually returned to the
basal level at 24 h after acidosis (Figure 1C, D). These results demonstrated that acidosis preferentially and substantially upregulated Homer1a mRNA and its translation product in cultured cortical
neurons.
We next addressed Homer1a mRNA levels after continuous acid
incubation. Homer1a mRNA was dramatically induced as early as
0.5 h acid stimulation. This induction peaked at 3 h and sustained
at higher levels than the basal level up to 12 h stimulation (Figure 1E, F). These data indicate that continuous acid stimulation
resulted in a much higher and longer Homer1a induction compared with 90 min acid treatment.

Hypoxia Transiently Upregulates Homer1a mRNA
Levels
It is well established that hypoxia is another common phenomenon in brain ischemia [12]. We next addressed whether hypoxia
had a similar ability to upregulate Homer1a level in cultured neurons. As shown in Figure 2A, B, Homer1a mRNA transiently
peaked after hypoxia treatment for 90 min, and thereby gradually
fell back to the basal level at 12 h reoxygenation. Similar to acid
incubation, levels of Homer1b/c were not strikingly altered after
hypoxia treatment. Western blot analysis showed that 90 min
hypoxia treatment rapidly promoted Homer1a protein levels
which peaked at 3 h reoxygenation (Figure 2C, D). The results
from continuous hypoxia treatment displayed that Homer1a
mRNA was strikingly increased at 0.5 h hypoxia stimulation. The
levels of Homer1a mRNA were still significantly higher than the
basal level at 12 h stimulation (Figure 2E, F). Collectively, these
findings demonstrated that hypoxia could selectively and transiently induce Homer1a expression, which was consistent with
the results from acid stimulation.

Homer1a mRNA Induction in Rat Brain Cortex
Following MCAO
We next investigated Homer1a expression in brain cortex of
MCAO rats followed by reperfusion. As shown in Figure 3A,
Homer1a mRNA produced significant induction which peaked at
1 h reperfusion and sustained at higher levels than the basal level
up to 24 h reperfusion. These results further provided evidence
for Homer1a induction in the in vivo ischemic animal models.

Homer1a mRNA Induction by ASIC1a Channelmediated Calcium Influx
We observed that acidosis and hypoxia could selectively and
rapidly upregulate Homer1a expression. But little is known
about the mechanisms underlying activity-dependent Homer1a
mRNA induction by the two distinct stimuli in cultured cortical
neurons. We first gained insights into how acidosis enhanced
Homer1a mRNA expression. A body of studies has demonstrated
that calcium influx is implicated in the activity-dependent gene

expression in neurons [16,17]. Sato et al. [10] reported that
glutamate stimulation of mice cerebellar granule cells upregulated Homer1a mRNA via influx of extracellular calcium mediated
by the glutamate-dependent calcium channel NMDA. Thus, we
examined the role of a glutamate-independent calcium channel
ASIC1a in Homer1a mRNA induction. Cortical neurons were
pretreated with the specific ASIC1a blocker PcTX1, nonspecific
ASICs blocker amiloride, or calcium chelator EGTA for 30 min,
and thereby incubated with acid application for 3 h in the setting of blockers for glutamate and voltage-gated calcium channels. As shown in Figure 3B, C, acid treatment substantially
enhanced Homer1a mRNA levels. The addition of ASICs inhibitors markedly suppressed Homer1a mRNA induction by acid
treatment. Importantly, chelation of extracellular calcium by
EGTA nearly counteracted acid-mediated Homer1a mRNA
increase. These results indicated that calcium influx mediated
by the glutamate-independent calcium channel ASIC1a was at
least partially responsible for Homer1a mRNA induction after
acidosis.

Previous studies have reported that ERK1/2 signaling is implicated
in Homer1a mRNA induction after glutamate stimulation [10].
Moreover, PI3K/Akt has also been reported to be involved in
mGluRIs function which can be regulated by Homer proteins
[18,19]. Thus, we further defined the roles of ERK1/2 and PI3K/
Akt signaling cascades in Homer1a mRNA induction. We first
monitored the expression of ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation by
immunoblotting at the indicated times after continuous acid and
hypoxia treatments. The results indicated that there was a slight
inhibitory effect on the expression of p-ERK1/2 and p-Akt at
5 min acid stimulation. However, the expression of p-ERK1/2 and
p-Akt was rapidly enhanced at 30 min acid treatment and thereby
slowly decreased. It sustained at higher levels than the basal level
up to 90 min (Figure 4A, B). The results from hypoxia stimulation
showed that p-ERK1/2 induction peaked at 30 min, and gradually
fell back to basal level at 6 h. In contrast, no marked change was
observed in p-Akt expression after continuous hypoxia treatment
(Figure 4C, D). These results suggested that ERK1/2 and Akt signaling might be involved in mechanisms of acidosis insults. However, hypoxia injury might require ERK1/2 activity.
Thus, we addressed whether the blockade of these signaling
pathways by the specific inhibitors had effect on Homer1a mRNA
induction after acid and hypoxia exposure. Cultured cells were
treated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 or PI3K inhibitor
LY294002 together with acid or hypoxia stimulation for 3 h. We
found that the blockade of MEK and PI3K/Akt signaling by
PD98059 and LY294002, respectively, almost completely abrogated Homer1a mRNA induction by acidosis (Figure 5A, B). However, only the addition of MEK inhibitor PD98059 abolished
hypoxia-evoked Homer1a mRNA induction (Figure 5C, D). Altogether, these data supported the view that acidosis-stimulated
Homer1a mRNA induction involved ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways whereas hypoxia-induced Homer1a mRNA upregulation was in dependence of ERK1/2 activity.

expression of p-ERK1/2 and p-Akt was rapidly induced at 30 min acid stimulation and thereby decreased slowly. (C, D) Hypoxia significantly induced pERK1/2 expression at 30 min and subsequently p-ERK1/2 expression was markedly decreased at 60 min and 90 min. However, hypoxia showed no

Role of Homer1a in Cell Injury by Acidosis and
Hypoxia
We had demonstrated acid and hypoxia-evoked Homer1a mRNA
induction and the potential mechanisms underlying this induction. However, the role of Homer1a in cell injury triggered by acidosis and hypoxia remains to be determined. We first sought to
examine LDH release and cell survival at the various time points
after the two stimuli. As shown in Figure 6A, B, when compared
with normal cells, neurons exposed to continuous acidosis and
hypoxia displayed a time-dependent increase in LDH release and
decrease in cell viability. More importantly, acidosis produced
higher LDH release and lower cell survival than hypoxia at each

270

time point in cultured cells. Generally, these findings implied that
cells subjected to acidosis and hypoxia display injured changes
and acid-induced Homer1a mRNA expression was accompanied
by more pronounced cell damage than hypoxia at the same time
points.
Finally, we observed cell injury alterations after Homer1a
knockdown using siRNA in neuro-2a cells exposed to acidosis and
hypoxia. The data indicated that Homer1a downregulation largely
enhanced acid- and hypoxia-induced LDH release when compared with the control siRNA-transfected cells at 3 h acid and
hypoxia treatments (Figure 6C, D). These results suggested that
Homer1a might play a beneficial role during the initial phase of
acid- and hypoxia-mediated neuronal injury.

Discussion
Homer1a represents a member of the IEG family and has been
established to be rapidly upregulated in response to extracellular
stimuli that affect synaptic plasticity. NMDA receptor activation
by glutamate and BDNF have been reported to enhance Homer1a
expression in cultured mice cerebellar granule cells [10]. Similarly, cocaine administration strongly increases Homer1a levels in
rat striatum neurons in vivo and in vitro and this event is mediated
through the dopamine D1 receptor [20]. Likewise, seizure, longterm potentiation (LTP), and light stimulation have also been considered to have the potential to raise the transcription induction of
Homer1a mRNA [21,22]. Consistent with previous studies, in this
study, we demonstrated the selective and marked increases in the
levels of Homer1a expression, but not Homer1b/c in cultured neu-

rons following acid and hypoxia exposure. In addition, we also
observed that Homer1a was largely induced after reperfusion in
MCAO rats. These results indicate that Homer1a may act as a neuronal activity marker in various pathological conditions.
A variety of studies have revealed that calcium ions, as a principal second messenger, plays a critical role in the activity-dependent gene expression in neurons [17]. The intracellular calcium is
believed to have the ability to activate protein kinase signaling
cascades, such as calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK)
and protein kinase C (PKC), and bring about the activation of
gene transcription in neurons [16,23]. Sato et al. [10] provided
evidence that glutamate stimulation of mice cerebellar granule
cells upregulated Homer1a mRNA via influx of extracellular calcium mediated by the glutamate-dependent calcium channel
NMDA receptor. However, the effect of calcium influx mediated

by the glutamate-independent calcium channel ASIC1a on
Homer1a induction remains to be established. Here, we observed
that the addition of specific ASIC1a blocker PcTX1, nonspecific
ASICs blocker amiloride, or calcium chelator greatly suppressed
acid-evoked Homer1a mRNA increase. These findings imply that
glutamate-independent calcium channel ASIC1a-mediated calcium influx is indispensable for Homer1a mRNA induction after
acid stimulation, which is consistent with previous reports [10].
Previous studies showed that ERK1/2 signaling was involved in
the process of IEG expression induction including Homer1a when
exposed to environmental stimuli in cultured cells [10,17,24]. The
mechanisms underlying ERK1/2-mediated IEG induction have
been well characterized in neurons in vivo. It has been proved that
ERK1/2 signaling is transferred to cellular nucleus after serial
phosphorylation events and the activated ERK1/2 potentiates its
ability to regulate transcription activity of many IEGs [25]. It has

element-binding protein (CREB) and Elk-1 are crucial for the
ERK1/2-mediated IEG transcription activation. There are several
response elements for CREB and Elk-1 in the promoter region of
IEG c-fos. ERK1/2 has been addressed to function as a common
component in two signaling pathways (ERK/Elk-1 and ERK/
CREB) converging on the c-fos promoter in cultured neurons
[26]. In this study, acidosis and hypoxia exhibited their potentials
to increase p-ERK1/2 and Homer1a mRNA levels. The inhibition
of ERK activity by MEK blocker PD98059 almost completely
counteracted Homer1a induction triggered by acidosis and
hypoxia. These data suggest that ERK activity is required for acidand hypoxia-mediated Homer1a induction, consistent with previous reports [10]. More interestingly, our results from bioinformatics analysis showed that Homer1a promoter region contained the
response elements for three transcription factors, such as CREB,
activator protein-1 (AP-1), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-jB)
(data not shown). Therefore, further studies need to be done to

Homer1a Expression

shed light on whether these transcription factors might be implicated in the regulation of Homer1a expression mediated by ERK1/
2 during acid and hypoxia exposure.
PI3K/Akt is another important signaling pathway that participates in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury [27] and has also
been reported to be involved in mGluRIs function which can be
regulated by Homer proteins [18,19]. In addition, it has been confirmed that phosphoinositide 3 kinase enhancer (PIKE)-L, a new
designated form of PI3K enhancer, binds to Homer1b/c and mGluRIs to form mGluRI-Homer-PIKE-L complex which leads to PI3K
activation [28]. Based on these observations, we presumed that
PI3K/Akt signaling cascades might be closely related to the function and regulation of Homer proteins including Homer1a. Here,
we presented evidence that acidosis, but not hypoxia, significantly
induced p-Akt dynamic expression. However, LY294002, a PI3K
inhibitor, abolished the induction-promoting ability of acidosis on
Homer1a. These results indicate that PI3K/Akt signaling is essential for Homer1a transcription activity induced by acidosis.
Previous study demonstrated that activity-induced Homer1a
significantly decreased chronic inflammatory hyperalgesia [29].
However, the role of Homer1a induction in ischemic stroke
remains elusive. It is well established that calcium signaling in
response to extracellular stimuli plays a vital role in neuronal
death during cerebral ischemia [30]. Furthermore, NMDA and
mGluRIs are the well-known calcium channels responsible for calcium influx from extracellular space and intracellular calcium
release, respectively [31]. Homer1a can keep calcium homeostatic
through reflecting NMDA and mGluRIs signaling [7,32]. Together,
we proposed that Homer1a induction might be associated with
pathological process of cerebral ischemia. Here, these results
showed that Homer1a knockdown markedly exacerbated cell
damage at 3 h of acid and hypoxia stimulation, indicating that
Homer1a might play a beneficial part in the early stage of acid and
hypoxia insults. It has been identified that cerebral ischemia
induces IEGs expression which is regarded as a brain plasticity
response that enables neurons to cope with potentially harmful
conditions [33]. Homer1a overexpression has been proved to

directly activate mGluRIs independent of their agonists in cultured neurons [34]. On the other hand, mGluRIs have also been
shown to protect cultured neurons from apoptosis [18]. Therefore,
the transient upregulation of Homer1a might be thought to initiate the protective mechanism against injury. In the present data,
Homer1a expression peaked at 3 h after 90 min acid and hypoxia
stimulation which might be implicated in early defense mechanism and plasticity response of brain. However, in our study,
accompanied by continuous acid and hypoxia treatments, acidosis
triggered more robust cell injury than hypoxia, and persistent
Homer1a upregulation. It has been reported that ASICs activation
by acidosis and hypoxia can regulate synaptic structure and
induce cell death [2,35]. Furthermore, the upregulated Homer1a
by acidosis and hypoxia is suggested to be involved in the activitydependent synaptic reorganization [11]. Accordingly, we presumed that the late dynamic expression of Homer1a might be
related to the final cell damage exposed to acidosis and hypoxia,
which requires further deep investigation.
In summary, our study demonstrates that acidosis and hypoxia
can remarkably induce Homer1a expression. Furthermore, acidosis might trigger more complex neuronal responses than hypoxia,
including ERK1/2 and Akt activity, and ASIC1a-mediated calcium
influx, to initiate Homer1a transcription relevant to cell ischemic
injury, which might account for why PI3K/Akt signaling is
involved in the acidosis-induced Homer1a alteration, but not
hypoxia. These results demonstrate that Homer1a might serve as a
key adaptor protein that links extracellular stimuli to intracellular
response and pathological process of cerebral ischemia.
