Conclusions: Our results indicate that Khat treatment can induce apoptosis through enhancing the release of Smac/DIABLO from the mitochondria to the cytosol after transient focal

chewing should be avoided by people who have cerebrovascular problems.

Introduction

Khat is the name generally used for Catha edulis, a dicotyledonous evergreen shrub of the family Celastraceae. The leaves
of the Khat shrub are traditionally chewed in Arab countries,
parts of the Middle East, Yemen and East Africa although
recently this habit has spread to Western countries including the USA and Asia country such as China (Al-Hebshi and
Skaug, 2005; Al-Motarreb et al., 2002). It is a stimulant and is
used to improve performance, stay alert and to increase work
capacity. Students have chewed Khat in an attempt to improve
mental performance before exams (Warfa et al., 2007). So far,
very little is known about the biological effects of Khat on
cells. In rats, a decreased serum level of free radical metabolizing scavenging enzymes and glucose has been observed
after oral administration of Khat, suggesting a systemic capacity to handle oxidative radicals after Khat use (Al-Qirim et al.,
2002). It has also been reported that Khat induces cytotoxic
effects in cells due to an early effect on mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex leading to mitochondrial inner
transmembrane permeabilisation and cell death (Lukandu
et al., 2009). Khat extract contains the major alkaloid of the
phenylpropylamine type of which the main psychoactive constituent is S-(−)-␣-aminopropiophenone (cathinone), together
with the less psychoactive phenylpropanolamine diastereomers S,S-(+)-norpseudoephedrine (cathine) (Brenneisen and
Geisshüsler, 1985). These alkaloids have previously been
detected in human plasma and urine After Kath chewing
(Toennes et al., 2003; Stefan and Gerold, 2002). Feyissa and
Kelly (2008) suggested that these compounds of Khat can
induce apoptosis respectively or by combination. Previous
studies have suggested that Khat cytotoxicity could be related
to Khat-speciﬁc phenylpropylamines including cathinone,
cathine and norephedrine (Pennings et al., 2008; Li et al., 2008).
Dimba et al. (2003) showed that an organic extract of Khat
induces a selective type of cell death having all morphological
and biochemical features of apoptotic cell death in leukemia
cells. Khat-induced apoptosis occurred synchronously in various human cell lines (HL-60, NB4) within 8 h of exposure
through mechanisms involving activation of caspase-1, -3 and
-8 (Dimba et al., 2004). It was reported that Khat induced
apoptotic cell death in primary normal oral keratinocytes
and ﬁbroblasts by an early effect on mechanisms that regulate oxidative stress (Lukandu et al., 2008). In addition, Khat
users may increase the risk of seizures when they are treated
with drugs with proconvulsant potential (Oyungu et al., 2009).
Chronic Khat use is associated with an increased number of
cardiovascular events such as hypertension and myocardial
infarct. Vanwalleghem et al. (2006) proved that Khat chewing
exacerbates the acute cerebral infarction (ischemic stroke).
Smac/DIABLO is pro-apoptotic protein released from the
mitochondria into the cytosol in response to cell deathinducing signals. Smac/DIABLO expression has been detected
in the hippocampal CA1 subregion of rat brains in a transient global cerebral ischemia model (Sugawara et al., 2002).
It localized within the mitochondrial intermembranous space
under the normal circumstances. The release of Smac/DIABLO
which lead to sequential activation of cysteine proteases,
referred to as caspases and cell death (Verhagen et al., 2000).

425

That suggests that Smac/DIABLO might play a critical role
in the early processes of the mitochondrial cell death pathway, which is followed by the caspase chain reaction (Shiozaki
and Shi, 2004). Moreover, there is evidence that Smac/DIABLO
functions not only at the level of XIAP binding, but also
directly with both the Apaf-1 apoptosome and the effector
caspases after caspase initiation (Srinivasula et al., 2000).
The rapid increase of released Smac/DIABLO might follow by
cytochrome c release and it might promote the proapoptotic
cascade by overcoming the inhibitory reaction of XIAP via the
binding to XIAP (Saito et al., 2003). However, it is still unclear
whether the adverse effects of the Khat on cerebral ischemia
are mediated by Smac/DIABLO genes.
In the present study we investigated the levels of protein
of Smac/DIABLO genes in dorsolateral cortex of ischemic rats
and their cellular localization to understand the mechanism
of Khat on the apoptosis of ischemic neurons.

Materials and methods

Eighty-four adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used
in our experiment, weighing 200 ± 50 g and came from the
animal department of XiangYa School of Medicine of Central
South University, Hunan province, PR China. All animal handling and surgery were performed in accordance with the Care
Standard of the Laboratory Animal (China Ministry of Health
publication, 1998). The rats were randomly divided into two
groups: control group (n = 42) and Khat-treated group (n = 42).

2.1.

Administration of Khat

Forty-two rats were received Khat orally twice daily for 4 weeks
(3 g/kg was dissolved in sterile saline). Dry Khat was collected
in the Thamar area, 100 km south of Yemen’s capital, Sana. It
was dried at normal temperature free of humidity and sunlight
and then crushed to powder.

2.2.

Preparation of MCAO and reperfusion model

Rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for
2 h followed by focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion for variable time (3, 6, 12 h) using an intraluminal suture technique, as
described in detail previously (Bi et al., 2008). Brieﬂy, rats in all
groups were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate intraperitoneal (0.35 ml/100 g), the left common and external carotid
arteries were carefully exposed and ligated using 4-0 ﬁlament
through a ventral midline neck incision. A 4-0 monoﬁlament
with a blunted tip was transiently inserted into the left internal carotid artery (approximately 18 mm from the carotid
bifurcation) for 2 h to induce transient focal ischemia. To monitor occlusion and reperfusion, the local cerebral blood ﬂow
(LCBF) was measured using a Laser-Doppler blood ﬂowmeter
(Periﬂux4001, Perimed, Sweden).

2.3.

Assessment of neurological scores

Neurological scores were evaluated with the exploratory test
as previously described (Xiao et al., 2007). After variable
time of reperfusion, neurological symptoms in each rat were

426

e n v i r o n m e n t a l t o x i c o l o g y a n d p h a r m a c o l o g y 3 9 ( 2 0 1 5 ) 424–432

evaluated in a blind fashion using a neurological deﬁcit
score (0 = no deﬁcit, 1 = failure to extend right forepaw fully,
2 = circling to the right, 3 = falling to the right, 4 = no spontaneous walking with a depressed level of consciousness). The
inclusion of an animal in the present study was dependent on
the neurological score of 1–3 for MCAO rats.

2.4.

Measurement of infarct volume

To measure the infarct volume, brains were isolated after sacriﬁcing the rats (n = 6, each group) and cut into six coronal
sections of 2 mm thickness from the frontal tip. They were
stained with 2% TTC, and then ﬁxed with 10% phosphate
buffered formalin solution. Infarct areas of all the sections
were calculated using image analysis software (Mitani Co.,
Japan). The infarct area in each stained section was determined by subtracting intact area in the ischemic hemisphere
from total area in the contralateral hemisphere to correct for
brain edema as previous described (Xiao et al., 2007). The total
infarct area was multiplied by thickness of brain sections to
get infarct volume.

2.5.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and TUNEL staining

Thirty-six rats were perfused with 0.9% saline followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4)
and embedded in parafﬁn. The parafﬁn-embedded sections
(4 ␮m thick) were deparafﬁnized with xylene and rehydrated
with graded ethanol. Immunohistochemical study was performed as following steps. Brieﬂy, after blocking endogenous
peroxidase activity by incubation with 1% H2 O2 in PBS for
15 min, sections were incubated with blocking buffer (2% goat
serum in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature, then incubated
overnight at 4 ◦ C with anti-Smac/DIABLO (1:200, Millipore,
Temecula, CA, USA), followed by washing in PBS. The sections
were incubated for 2 h in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (KPL Co., USA), diluted at 1:200 and in an ABC kit (KPL
Co., USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
horseradish peroxidase reaction was detected by incubation
with diaminobenzidine (0.05% in PBS). To ensure comparable immunostaining, sections were processed together at the
same time under the same conditions. For the assessment of
non-speciﬁc immunostaining, alternating sections from each
experimental group were incubated without the primary antibody.
TUNEL staining was carried out using the in situ cell death
detection kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Each procedure was followed
by several rinses in 0.1 M PBS. A negative control was similarly performed except for omitting TUNEL reaction mixture.
TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells were counted in the periinfarct area were calculated using image analysis software
(HPIAS-1000, Wuhan University, China) under the same conditions in randomly selected four microscopic ﬁelds per section
in a blind fashion (n = 6, each group) as previous described.

2.6.

Western blot

The methods for Western blot have been previously described
(Bi et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2004). Ipsilateral dorsolateral

cortex was dissected from the coronal section (Bregma 1.2
to −0.8 mm) of each rat from six animals from each group
were used for Western blot study. Brain homogenates were
ﬁrst centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min, and then the supernatant was centrifuged further at 8000 × g for 20 min. The
second pellet containing the mitochondrial fraction was saved
at 80 ◦ C and then dissolved in the same suspension buffer as
above before use. The supernatant was further centrifuged
at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 ◦ C. This supernatant was used
for cytosolic analysis. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method with the Bio-Rad protein
assay Kit II (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The protein content was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts
of protein per lane (40 ␮g) were loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel and separated by electrophoresis at 100 V for
120 min. Proteins were then electrotransferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride ﬁlter (PVDF) membrane at 200 V for 120 min
and the membrane was blocked for 2 h at room temperature
with 5% non-fat milk in buffer solution (phosphate-buffered
saline containing 0.1% Tween 20). Thereafter, the PVDF was
incubated overnight at 4 ◦ C with rabbit anti-Smac/DIABLO
polyclonal antibody (1:1000) in buffer solution. After washing three times with buffer solution, the PVDF was incubated
with horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit (Zymed
Inc., USA) antibody diluted at 1:2000 in buffer solution at
room temperature for 60 min. As an internal control, the same
PVDF was incubated with an antibody speciﬁcally for mouse
anti-␤-actin (1: 40,000, Sigma–Aldrich) as internal control for
the cytosolic protein or mouse anti-COX IV (0.1 ␮g/ml, Molecular Probes) as internal control for mitochondrial protein,
followed by corresponding secondary antibodies after being
stripped.

2.7.

Image acquisition and data analysis

Samples were viewed under a light microscopy (Motic). Images
were captured using a digital camera (Nikon) attached to
the microscope. Capture parameters were initially established
and kept unmodiﬁed for all images. For the quantiﬁcation of
immunohistochemical data, the mean optic density (OD) of
positive products for Smac/DIABLO in the peri-infarct area
were calculated using image analysis software (HPIAS-1000,
Wuhan University, China) under the same conditions in randomly selected four microscopic ﬁelds per section (n = 6, each
group) as described by Li et al. (2008). The measurements
were performed by an author who was blind with respect
to treatments. The Western blot band optical density was
determined by a computer image analysis system (Tanon,
Shanghai, China). The optical density from internal control
was used as a reference and relative ratio of optical density from the different group was calculated against the
control.

2.8.

Statistical analysis

Statistics analysis was performed using software SPSS 13.0
(SPSS Inc.). Data are reported as means ± S.D. The data were
determined by the unpaired Student’s t test for two-group
comparisons or ANOVA followed by Duncan’s multiple range
test for multiple comparisons among more than two groups.

Results

3.1.

Neurological scores and infarct volume

Our observation showed that Khat-treated rats had worse clinical outcome than the control rats. As shown in Fig. 1E, the
scores in Khat-treated group were signiﬁcantly higher than
vehicle group (3.15 ± 0.85 vs. 2. 35 ± 0.31, t = 2.715, p = 0.022,
n = 6).
As shown in the representative photos (Fig. 1B and C), the
infarction area in the ischemic brain treated by Khat (Fig. 1C)
was markedly larger than that its vehicle group (Fig. 1B) at
12 h after reperfusion. Analyzed infarction volume in the Khattreated group was signiﬁcantly increased compared to that
in the vehicle group (204.2 ± 12.5 mm3 vs. 182.7 ± 12.8 mm3 ,
t = 2.942, p = 0.015, n = 6).

3.2.

Immuonohistochemistry and TUNEL

A large number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells
were observed mainly in the peri-infarct areas after
ischemia/reperfusion. Based on the TUNEL assay, cells
with brown-stained nuclei are considered to be apoptotic
cells. The black leftwards arrowhead at the apoptotic cells
with brown-stained nuclei as shown in Fig. 2e and f. The number of TUNEL-positive cells was signiﬁcantly increased in the
Khat treated group compared with that in the ischemia group
at 3 h (54.8 ± 4.0 vs.45.3 ± 4.8, F(1,10) = 14.089, p < 0.01, Fig. 2B,
b, E and e) and 12 h (60.3 ± 5.68 vs.53.7 ± 3.33, F(1,10) = 6.154,
p < 0.05, Fig. 2C, c, F and f) after ischemia/reperfusion. The

number of TUNEL-positive cells was increased in the shamoperated group after Khat treatment 4 weeks compared with
the sham-operated group without Khat treatment group,
but the effect was not statistically signiﬁcant (5.67 ± 1.21 vs.
4.67 ± 1.21, F(1,10) = 2.045, p > 0.05, Fig. 2A, a D and d).
The
analysis
of
Smac/DIABLO-immunoreactivity
(Smac/DIABLO-ir) revealed changes in the cortex following transient focal cerebral ischemia (tFCI). Staining intensity
scores were graded as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate),
and 3 (strong). Positive area percentages were graded as
follows: grade 0 (≤5%), 1 (6–15%), 2 (16–25%), 3 (26–50%), 4
(51–75%) and 5 (>75%). Positivity was determined using the
following formula: IHC score = percentage score multiplied
by staining intensity score. Positive expression was deﬁned
as an IHC score > 6. The expression of Smac/DIABLO in the
cytosol was low in the normal state and increased during the
reperfusion phase (3–12 h) in cortical cells (Fig. 3B, b, C and
c) implying an upregulation immediately after reperfusion.
In the sham-operated animals, Smac/DIABLO staining was
mainly observed in the cytoplasm of cortical neurons around
the nucleus (Fig. 3A and a). In the ischemic hemisphere, the
Smac/DIABLO staining became more intense at 3 h and 12 h
after ischemia/reperfusion compared with sham-operated
group (F(2,15) = 13.596, p < 0.01, Fig. 3B, b, C and c). We observed
a nuclear immunoreactivity of Smac/DIABLO in the rat cortex
after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (Fig. 3B, b, C and c). After
Khat treatment, the increase of Smac/DIABLO staining intensity was stronger than control group animals 3 h and 12 h
after reperfusion (F(1,10) = 7.529, p < 0.05 and F(1,10) = 7.874,
p < 0.05) (Fig. 3E, e, F and f). Some of the Smac/DIABLO positive
cells showed a long, process-like structure resembling axons
(black leftwards arrowhead indicated in Fig. 3f) and presented
an ischemic change, such as triangle-shaped shrunken nuclei
or a condensed nucleus. It showed diffuse pattern in the

cytoplasm indicating their release from mitochondria
and Khat enhanced the release of Smac/DIABLO from
mitochondria (Fig. 3E, e, F and f).

3.3.

Western blot

Western blot analysis revealed that Smac/DIABLO immunoreactivity was evident as a single band of molecular weight
of 24 kDa; it was lower in the cytosolic fraction and strongly
present in the mitochondrial fraction in the sham-operated
rats (Figs. 4 and 5). There was correlation between immunohistochemical results and Western blotting, conforming that
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion promoted a rise in cytosolic

Smac/DIABLO from the mitochondria to the cytosol, evident
at 3, 6, and 12 h after reperfusion, as assessed by Western
blot analysis (F(3,20) = 54.180, p < 0.01, Fig. 4A), with no signiﬁcant change in the mitochondrial fraction relative to that of
sham-operated group (Fig. 5) (F(3,20) = 0.071, p > 0.05, Fig. 5).
Khat treatment did not alter the abundance of Smac/DIABLO
in the mitochondrial fraction of the cortex (F(3,20) = 0.756,
p > 0.05, Fig. 5). But Khat promoted the mitochondrial release of
Smac/DIABLO and induced an upregulation of Smac/DIABLO
in the cytosolic fraction, evident at 3, 6 and 12 h after reperfusion. The cytosolic levels of Smac/DIABLO were signiﬁcantly
higher in the Khat treated group vs. ischemia group at 3 h
(F(1,10) = 17.644, p < 0.01), at 6 h (F(1,10) = 7.640, p < 0.05) and at

Fig. 3 – Representative photomicrographs showed staining of Smac/DIABLO distribution in the ischemia group and
Khat-treated group at 3 h (B and E) and 12 h (C and F) after reperfusion in the peri-infarct area. The immunoreactivity of
Smac/DIABLO in dorsolateral cortex was observed in the ischemic cortex, but clear positivity in the nuclei was not observed
in sham-operated group (A and a) and sham-operated group after Khat treatment 4 weeks (D and d). At 3 and 12 h
post-reperfusion, Smac/DIABLO-ir exhibited a pattern within cytoplasmic compartments. The immunohistochemistry
sections show increased positive signal in the Khat-treated group (E, e, F and f) compared with the ischemia group (B, b, C
and c) at 3 h and 12 h after reperfusion in the peri-infarct area. Some of the Smac/DIABLO positive cells showed a long,
process-like structure resembling axons (black leftwards arrowhead in (f) and presented an ischemic change, such as
triangle-shaped shrunken nuclei or a condensed nucleus. Staining intensity scores were graded as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2
(moderate), and 3 (strong). Positive expression was deﬁned as an IHC score > 6. (G) Quantiﬁcation of OD of Smac/DIABLO-ir in
the peri-infarct area. *p < 0.05 vs. the ischemia group at 3 h, 12 h after reperfusion. Scale bar = 100 ␮m and 50 ␮m.

12 h (F(1,10) = 10.504, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4B). Together, these results
showed that Smac/DIABLO translocated from mitochondria
to the cytosol during the early period after cerebral ischemia.
Such release of Smac/DIABLO was elevated after the rats were
pretreated with Khat (Figs. 4 and 5). Results shown are representative of three independent studies. A consistent amount
of ␤-actin was observed in the ischemic and Khat treatment
samples. COX IV was used as a mitochondrial marker and no
difference was observed between the samples, suggesting that
the amount of the loaded protein was consistent.

Discussion

The leaves of the tree Catha edulis, known as Khat, are
chewed by the adult population of Yemen, Somalia and other

East African countries for their stimulating and euphoric
effect. The psychoactive constituents are the cathines, which
consist of norpseudoephedrine, norephedrine and cathinone, an alkaloid with a structure resembling amphetamine.
Khat precipitates psychosis and causes arterial hypertension, angina pectoris and myocardial infarction (Balint et al.,
2009). Stroke-like cerebral complications have been observed
in patients abusing sympathomimetic drugs like cocaine and
amphetamines (Miranda and O’Neill, 2002). Carvalho et al.
(2003) concluded a possible association between Khat use and
brain disorders, including migraine and cerebral hemorrhage.
Neuropathology of brain injury after hypoxiaischemia (HI)
includes focal ischemic infarction, selective neuronal necrosis and apoptosis (Vannucci and Hagberg, 2004). Apoptotic
and antiapoptotic signaling pathways are activated after

cerebral HI, and a shift in the balance between apoptotic
and antiapoptotic cellular factors determines cells fate. The
mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis after cerebral ischemia
has been already reported. Mitochondria are the major site
of superoxide production under normal or pathologic conditions, such as tFCI (Piantadosi and Zhang, 1996). Many
studies of in vivo cerebral ischemia have provided evidences
that the mitochondrial pathway leads to caspase activation
and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of apoptotic neuronal cell death after ischemic injury. Excessive
superoxide production may cause mitochondrial injury that
leads to the release of proteins, such as cytochrome c and
Smac/DIABLO, from their intermembrane space (Sugawara
et al., 2002). Other studies showed that mechanism of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) induction through
the depletion of GSH followed the down-regulation of the
organ-speciﬁc methionineadenosyl-transferase type I (MAT1)
by acidic sphingomyelinase (A-SMase). MPT opening or the
activation of Bax/Bak results in SMAC/DIABLO release and caspase activation. SMAC/DIABLO can relieve the inhibition of
IAPs on caspases. If ATP levels are insufﬁcient, caspase-9 cannot be activated despite the release of cytochrome c. In this
case, mitochondrial dysfunction may trigger other forms of
caspase-independent cell death (e.g. through Ca2+ deregulation and overproduction of ROS) (Cerretani et al., 2011). When
released, Smac/DIABLO promotes apoptosis by binding and
neutralizing inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). Moreover,

the cytosol in response to apoptotic stimuli can regulate IAPs
to promote caspase activation by binding and eliminating IAP
function (Siegelin et al., 2005).
The principal ﬁnding of this study is that Khat treatment
signiﬁcantly exacerbate the neurological damage (p < 0.05) and
increased the total infarct volumes (p < 0.05), compared with
control group. The number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cell
in the peri-infarct area was increased after Khat treatment.
Therefore, fewer cells in the peri-infarct area might survive
in the Khat-treated animals compared to the control group
animals. These observations suggest that the cytotoxicity
induced by Khat would be related to promote cell death in
the ischemic cortex. Our other aim was to investigate certain
mechanisms for cytoxicity of Khat by determining the effect
of Khat on apoptosis and expression of apoptosis-related
genes. Some researchers revealed Smac/DIABLO expression
in cerebral ischemia. In the present study, we evaluated the
expression and subcellular distribution of Smac/DIABLO in the
ischemic cortex after Khat treatment.
Our results on the pattern and time course of the gene
expression proﬁles obtained by two independent techniques
are highly consistent. Normally, this gene is expressed at
very low levels in a small population of neurons. It is localized within the mitochondrial intermembranous space under
normal circumstances (Shibata et al., 2002). We observed a
nuclear immunoreactivity of Smac/DIABLO in the rat cortex after cerebral ischemia. After Khat treatment, Some of

the Smac/DIABLO positive cells showed a long, process-like
structure resembling axons (black leftwards arrowhead indicated in Fig. 3f) and presented an ischemic change, such
as triangle-shaped shrunken nuclei or a condensed nucleus,
the staining intensity was stronger than control group animals 3 h and 12 h after reperfusion indicating Khat treatment
inducing the upregulation of Smac/Diablo in the ischemic cortex. Consisted with IHC, Western blot analysis also revealed
that Smac/DIABLO immunoreactivity was evident as a single band of molecular mass of 24 kDa. The acute transient
ischemia triggers upregulation of the Smac/DIABLO as early as
3 h, gradually increased with the time after MCAO. We found
Smac/DIABLO translocated from mitochondria to the cytosol
during the early period after tFCI consisitent with the previous report by Saito et al. (2003). Such release of Smac/DIABLO
was elevated after the rats were pretreated with Khat indicating that this protein may be part of a death pathway of the
Khat-induced apoptosis after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.
The mechanism by which Khat pretreatment interferes
with Smac/DIABLO release is unclear. The increase in cytosolic Smac/DIABLO could derive from other sources, such as
ischemia-induced upregulation or impaired protein import.
It is possible that Khat pretreatment targets and inhibits
proapoptotic proteins that induce Smac/DIABLO release from
mitochondria. It has been shown that the apoptosis promoter
Smac/DIABLO is encoded by a nuclear gene and is subsequently imported into mitochondria (Silke et al., 2000). Upon
induction of most cell death-related stimuli, Smac/DIABLO is
released into the cytosol and facilitates cell death by abrogating the caspase-inhibiting actions of the IAPs, which plays a
decisive role in the cell death mechanism (Russell et al., 2008;
Srinivasula et al., 2001). The cytosolic Smac/DIABLO probably
prevents the IAPs from binding to caspases and subsequently
reactivate the caspases and result in massive apoptotic cell
death after Khat treatment. However, whether Khat increased
the release of Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria by enhancing the activation of caspases is still to be clariﬁed. Hence, it
seems reasonable to assume that Smac/DIABLO contributes
to the apoptotic cell death in our model of focal cerebral
ischemia in rats as was demonstrated previously in mice by
using the model of focal ischemia (Saito et al., 2003, 2004). Furthermore, the results presented not only emphasize the role
of release of Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria in the regulation of apoptosis but also provide evidences that activation
of the Smac/DIABLO is implicated in the pathophysiological mechanisms of reperfusion injury after Khat treatment.
So, our results provide a direct evidence for the existence
of Smac/DIABLO protein in cortex of the ischemic rats and
demonstrate in this area the effect of Khat on apoptosis.
Therefore, inhibiting of Smac gene expression could perform
in the process of Khat inducing nerve cells apoptosis. Similar
data have been reported inhibitors of IAPs activity, particularly Smac/DIABLO, are essential for normal functioning of
apoptotic caspase cascade (Saito et al., 2003, 2004).

Conclusion

Our results suggest the existence of a new pathway of neurotoxicity effect of Khat in which Khat induces apoptosis

431

after cerebral ischemia through modulating Smac/DIABLO
expression. Inhibiting the expression of Smac/DIABLO plays
an important role in the process of Khat inducing nerve cells
apoptosis in the cortexs which may be an important mechanism of Khat cytotoxicity. Therefore, Khat chewing should be
avoided by people who have cerebrovascular problems. There
is insufﬁcient evidence to ﬁgure out which compounds of Khat
are responsible for Khat-induced cell death in our model. Nevertheless, Khat chewing should be avoided in persons who
have any cerebrovascular problems.
