metabolism-related proteins after MCAO.

Introduction

Stroke is a serious cerebrovascular disorder and a major cause
of death. Moreover, the incidence of stroke is increasing
annually. Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder and an
important risk factor for ischemic cerebrovascular disease.
Patients with diabetes mellitus have at least twofold higher
risks for cerebrovascular complications compared with people

without diabetes and also have increased mortality and
morbidity after stroke [1,2]. Moreover, diabetic rats have
increased infarct volume and neuronal damage after cerebral
ischemia compared with nondiabetic rats [3]. Diabetes also
induces various neuronal injuries such as neuroaxonal dystrophy, synaptic dysplasia, and defective axonal regeneration
as a result of high blood glucose toxicity [4]. Hyperglycemia
increases the production of reactive oxygen species, induces

apoptotic cell death, and results in diabetes pathogenesis [5,6].
The excessive oxidative stress in diabetic animals directly
causes neuronal cell death by damaging mitochondria [7].
Glycogen in the brain serves an important role in maintaining physiological functions such as energy metabolism and
neurotransmitter homeostasis [8]. The disruption of glucose
metabolism in diabetes causes disorders in brain function, and
neurodegenerative diseases appear to be associated with an
imbalance in energy metabolism [8,9]. A defect in energy
metabolism leads to neuronal depolarization and increases in
intracellular calcium, which in turn results in cell damage [9].
Moreover, impairment of cellular energy metabolism is a general pathologic process in ischemic brain injury [10]. Although
previous studies demonstrated the relationship between cerebral damage and hyperglycemia, the underlying mechanisms are complex and poorly understood. We hypothesized
that the hyperglycemic condition modulates various proteins
that regulate neuronal cell death during brain injury. Thus, we
used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to detect specific proteins that were altered by hyperglycemic condition during focal cerebral ischemic injury.

Materials and methods

2.1.

Experimental animals

Adult male SpragueeDawley rats (190e200 g, n ¼ 40) were
purchased from Samtako Co (Animal Breeding Center, Osan,
Korea) and randomly assigned to four groups: nondiabetic þ
sham, diabetic þ sham, nondiabetic þ middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO), and diabetic þ MCAO. Diabetes was induced
by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO). Streptozotocin was dissolved in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH
4.6) at a dose of 40 mg/kg [11]. Nondiabetic animals were
injected with only citrate buffer. Blood glucose levels were
analyzed using a strip-based blood glucose sensor (Accu-ChekRoche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and diabetes was
defined as fasting blood glucose >300 mg/dL. Animals were
maintained under conditions of controlled temperature (25 C)
and lighting (14:10 lightedark cycle). All animal experiments
were carried out in accordance with the guidelines approved by
the ethics committee concerning animal research at Gyeongsang National University (GNU-LA-20).

2.2.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion

At 4 wk after injection of streptozotocin, MCAO was
performed using an intraluminal procedure as previously
described [12]. Blood glucose and body weight were measured
before MCAO. Animals were anesthetized with Zoletil (50 mg/
kg; Virbac, Carros, France) and the right common carotid
artery, external carotid artery, and internal carotid artery were
exposed. The external carotid artery was ligated and cut, and
the right common carotid artery was temporarily blocked
using microvascular clips. A 4/0 monofilament nylon suture
tip that was rounded by heating was gently inserted from the
external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery, thereby
blocking the origin of the middle cerebral artery. The external
carotid artery was ligated with nylon and the microvascular

clip on the right common carotid artery was removed. At 24 h
after the onset of occlusion, the animals were decapitated and
the brains were removed.

2.3.

Two-Dimensional gel electrophoresis

A proteomic approach was performed according to the
previously described method [13]. The right cerebral cortices
were homogenized in lysis buffer (8 M urea, 4% 3[(-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate
[CHAPS], ampholytes, and 40 mM TriseHCl) and centrifuged at
16,000  g for 20 min at 4 C. The pellets were dissolved in lysis
buffer and the concentration of protein was determined using
a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Proteins were separated
by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. First dimension isoelectric focusing was performed on an Ettan IPGphor 3 System
(GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) using immobilized pH
gradient (IPG) gel strips (17 cm, pH 4e7 and pH 6e9; Bio-Rad).
Rehydration was performed in sample buffer (8 M urea, 2%
CHAPS, 20 mM dithiothreitol [DTT], 0.5% IPG buffer, and bromophenol blue) for 13 h. The protein samples (100 mg) were
loaded onto the IPG strips and isoelectric focusing was performed as follows: 250 V for 15 min, 10,000 V for 3 h, and then
10,000e50,000 V. The strips were equilibrated with a solution
(6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS],
50 mM TriseHCl [pH 8.8], 1% DTT) for 15 min. For the second
dimension, the strips were applied to gradient gels (7.5%e
17.5%) for SDS gel electrophoresis. The gels were loaded on
Protein-II XI electrophoresis equipment (Bio-Rad) and subjected to 5 mA for 2 h, followed by 10 mA for 10 h at 10 C. The
gels were reacted in fixation solution (12% acetic acid, 50%
methanol) for 2 h and washed with 50% ethanol for 20 min.
Gels were then stained with silver solution (0.2% silver nitrate)
for 20 min and developed in a solution of 0.2% sodium carbonate. The gel images were scanned with Agfa ARCUS 1200
(Agfa-Gevaert, Mortsel, Belgium). PDQuest 2-D analysis software (Bio-Rad) was used for analysis of the protein spots.
Protein spots were excised from the gels and processed for
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight
[MALDI-TOF]. The gel particles were digested in trypsincontaining buffer and then extracted. Peptides were
analyzed with a Voyager System DE-STR MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometer (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA). MS-Fit
(University of California, San Francisco, CA) and ProFound
programs were used to detect proteins, and the databases
SWISS-PROT and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) were used to identify protein sequences.

2.4.
Reverse transverseepolymerase chain reaction
amplification
Total RNA was extracted with Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD). Total RNA (1 mg) from each sample was
reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA with a superscript III first-strand system using reagents from Invitrogen
(Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
primer sequences used are presented in Table 1. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out as follows: an
initial 5 min at 94 C; 30 s at 94 C, 30 s at 54 C, and 1 min at 72 C

Data analysis

All data are expressed as the means  SD. The intensity analysis was performed using SigmaGel 1.0 (Jandel Scientific, San
Rafael, CA) and SigmaPlot 4.0 (SPSS Inc, Point Richmond, CA).
The results for each group were compared by two-way analysis
of variance followed by post hoc Scheffe’s test. Differences in
comparisons were considered significant at P < 0.05.

these protein spots, 36 proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF
analysis with sequence coverage of 11%e62.5% (Table 2).
However, two proteins were not identified and named as
unknown proteins.

3.3.
The change in metabolism-related proteins in
diabetic animals with MCAO
Among these identified proteins, we focused on metabolismrelated proteins such as isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH),
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), adenosylhomocysteinase, pyruvate kinase, and glucose-6phosphate isomerase (neuroleukin). In proteomic studies,
expression of these proteins in the cerebral cortex was
decreased in both groups of MCAO operated animals. However, expression of these proteins was reduced to a greater
extent in diabetic animals than in nondiabetic animals (Fig. 3).

3.4.
Reverse transcriptionePCR analysis of metabolismrelated proteins in diabetic animals with MCAO
Reverse transcriptionePCR analysis showed that transcript
levels of these proteins also decreased in the cerebral cortex of
MCAO operated animals, and that the diabetic animals showed
more severe decreases in transcript expression than the
nondiabetic animals during MCAO injury (Fig. 4). Transcript
levels are represented as the ratio of intensity of each PCR
product to that of actin. Relative transcript levels in nondiabetic and diabetic animals with MCAO injury were 0.52  0.02
and 0.19  0.02, respectively, for ICDH. GAPDH levels were
0.59  0.02 and 0.22  0.03 in nondiabetic and diabetic animals
with MCAO injury. Adenosylhomocysteinase levels were
0.54  0.03 and 0.21  0.03 in nondiabetic and diabetic animals
with MCAO injury. Pyruvate kinase levels were 0.62  0.02 and
0.20  0.02 in nondiabetic and diabetic animals with MCAO
injury. Neuroleukin levels were 0.67  0.02 and 0.54  0.04 in
nondiabetic and diabetic animals with MCAO injury.

conditions than normal glucose levels. In this study, we identified differentially expressed proteins between diabetic and
nondiabetic animals after MCAO damage. Among these identified proteins, we discussed on metabolism-related proteins.
Changes in the expression of these proteins were closely associated with worse brain damage in diabetic animals after brain
ischemic injury.
ICDH is an essential enzyme that is involved in the third
step of citric acid cycle [15]. This enzyme exists in a two-step
process. ICDH catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate into a-ketoglutarate and CO2, converting NADþ to
NADH. Because ICDH is involved in energy production,
dysfunction of this enzyme causes a reduction in adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) production and impairment of energy
metabolism [16]. Moreover, as energy metabolism is closely
correlated with physiological function, impairment of energy
metabolism causes pathologic changes associated with brain
ischemia [17]. The activity of ICDH is decreased in the brain of

patients with Alzheimer’s disease and reduced under conditions of brain ischemia [18,19]. A reduction in ICDH decreases
ATP production and energy metabolism, and consequently
triggers cells death. Moreover, overproduction of ICDH protects
cells from oxidative stress, whereas cells with decreased
expression of ICDH show increased reactive oxygen species
generation and susceptibility to oxidative stress [20]. Therefore, regulation of ICDH is important for modulating energy
metabolism in neuronal cells. We revealed that ICDH expression is downregulated in both diabetic and nondiabetic animals after focal cerebral ischemia and that this effect is greater
in diabetic animals compared with nondiabetic animals. Hyperglycemic conditions cause more severe brain damage after
cerebral ischemia than normal glucose levels [3]. This study
suggests that the aggravated reduction of ICDH in diabetic rats
enhances the impairment of energy metabolism and consequently leads to more severe brain damage compared with
nondiabetic rats.

GAPDH is an essential glycolytic enzyme that breaks down
glucose for energy metabolism. In addition to its metabolic
function, GAPDH is involved in diverse cellular activities
including transcription activation, inhibition of apoptosis, and
axonal transport [21,22]. A previous study using fresh frozen
cryosections demonstrated a clear reduction in GAPDH mRNA
within the ischemic tissue after MCAO [23]. Thus, GAPDH is
considered as a marker for the estimation of infarct volume in
MCAO animal models [23]. These results are in agreement
with our results that demonstrated a decrease in GAPDH
expression in focal cerebral ischemia. We additionally show
that GAPDH levels are reduced to a greater extent during cerebral ischemia in diabetic animals compared with nondiabetic animals. Glycolytic ATP is closely related to neuronal cell
recovery after brain ischemic injury through the regulation of
ionic homeostasis [24]. Inhibition of GAPDH leads to serious
neurodegeneration because of a defective glycotic pathway
[25]. Similarly, downregulation of GAPDH during ischemic
brain injury leads to damage of neuronal cells. Cerebral
ischemia also decreases the mitochondrial capacity and causes impairment of energy metabolism [10]. Therefore, maintenance of GAPDH levels is important for the regulation of
cellular energy metabolism and neuronal cell survival. Our
results suggest that hyperglycemia induces an excessive

reduction of GAPDH and disorders in energy metabolism, and
aggravates neuronal cell damage in focal cerebral ischemia.
Adenosylhomocysteinase catalyzes the conversion of
S-adenosylhomocysteine to homocysteine and adenosine
[26]. Adenosylhomocysteinase is primarily localized
in the neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum [27].
Adenosylhomocysteinase controls the intracellular adenosylhomocysteine level. Homocysteine, adenosine, and adenosylhomocysteine precursor levels are carefully regulated by
multiple metabolic mechanisms to avoid accumulation of
adenosylhomocysteine [26]. Inhibition of adenosylhomocysteinase induces intracellular accumulation of adenosylhomocysteine, which reduces cellular methylation ability and
decreases the levels of adenosine and adenosylhomocysteine
precursors that have neuroprotective effects [26,28]. Adenosylhomocysteinase deficiency leads to developmental abnormalities of the brain in humans [29]. Therefore, maintenance
of adenosylhomocysteinase is essential for neuronal cells
survival. This study identified a reduction in adenosylhomocysteinase in both diabetic and nondiabetic animals after
MCAO injury. Moreover, the decrease in adenosylhomocysteinase was exaggerated in animals with diabetes combined
with MCAO injury. Thus, we suggest that the severe reduction
of adenosylhomocysteinase in hyperglycemic conditions with

brain injury induces a deficiency of adenosine and magnifies
brain damage.
Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme that plays a role in glycolysis
metabolism by catalyzing conversion of a phosphate group
from phosphoenolpyruvate to adenosine diphosphate (ADP)
and generating pyruvate and ATP. Lack of pyruvate kinase
slows down the process of glycolysis. Brain ischemia induces
dysfunctions in energy metabolism. This study revealed that
the level of pyruvate kinase is decreased in both nondiabetic
and diabetic animals after brain ischemia, although diabetic
animals exhibited a more severe decrease in pyruvate kinase
after MCAO than nondiabetic animals. A decrease in pyruvate
kinase may lead to a decrease in pyruvate levels after
ischemic brain injury. Pyruvate exerts protective effects
against brain ischemic injury [30,31], administration of pyruvate reduces the infarct volume and improves neurologic
deficits after permanent focal cerebral ischemia in rats [30].
Pyruvate also exerts an antioxidant effect through inhibition

of nuclear factor-kappa B in brain ischemia [32]. Regulation of
pyruvate kinase is important for neuroprotection in brain
injury. Moreover, a deficiency of pyruvate kinase indicates a
dysfunction in glycolysis metabolism. The results of our study
suggest that the excessive reduction of pyruvate kinase in
hyperglycemia magnifies neuronal damage during focal cerebral ischemia and leads to serious neuronal dysfunction.
Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase is a cytosolic enzyme that
catalyzes the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to fructose
6-phosphate in the second step of glycolysis [33]. Glucose6-phosphate isomerase, also known as neuroleukin, is a
multifunctional protein that is involved in various cellular
processes including glucose metabolism, neuronal growth,
and differentiation [34]. Neuroleukin plays a role as a neurotrophic factor in spinal and sensory neurons during development, and its inhibition results in increased susceptibility
of neuronal cells to caspase-dependent apoptosis [34,35].
Moreover, neuroleukin deficiency causes nonspherocytic

hemolytic anemia and, in some cases, is genetically related to
neurologic impairment [36]. Our results show that the level of
neuroleukin is downregulated in the cerebral cortex after
MCAO injury. Hyperglycemia induces a more severe reduction
in neuroleukin expression during focal cerebral ischemia
compared with normal conditions. A reduction in neuroleukin
expression indicates impairment of neurons. Diabetes is
known to enhance the induction of apoptosis by cerebral
ischemia and exaggerate cerebral stroke [14]. To date, no other
study has reported changes in neuroleukin expression after
ischemic brain injury in streptozotocin-induced diabetic animals. Although the relationship between neuroleukin and
hyperglycemia is not completely understood, this study
shows that the decrease in neuroleukin after MCAO is more
severe in hyperglycemic conditions than normal glucose
levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that downregulation of neuroleukin in the diabetic condition exacerbates the damage of cerebral ischemic injury.
This study clearly demonstrated a change in several
metabolism-related proteins, including ICDH, GAPDH, adenosylhomocysteinase, pyruvate kinase, and neuroleukin after
MCAO injury under hyperglycemic conditions. Dysfunctions
in glucose and energy metabolism indicate disorders
of neuronal cells [8e10]. Our proteomic approach clearly
demonstrated that expression of metabolism-related proteins
in the cerebral cortex was decreased in MCAO operated animals. However, expression of these proteins was reduced to a
greater extent in diabetic animals than in nondiabetic animals. Moreover, reverse transcriptionePCR and Western blot
analyses confirmed the fact that the diabetic condition exacerbates the decrease in expression of metabolism-related
proteins after MCAO. The decrease in metabolism-related
proteins in diabetes finally deteriorates brain damage after
ischemic brain. Unfortunately, we did not demonstrate exact
regulative mechanisms of these proteins in diabetic condition
and cerebral ischemia. Although this study did not demonstrate exact mechanism of metabolism-related protein in
diabetes and cerebral ischemia, this study clearly shows the
change in these proteins in diabetes and cerebral stroke. Thus,
further study is needed to elucidate the regulative mechanisms of metabolism-related protein in diabetes and stroke
animal models. Our findings will provide important information for the understanding of the relationship between diabetes and cerebral ischemia. The results of this study will
support basic data for the production of therapeutic agent for
diabetes and cerebral stroke.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that hyperglycemia exacerbates brain
damage after ischemic brain injury through severe downregulation of metabolism-related proteins.
