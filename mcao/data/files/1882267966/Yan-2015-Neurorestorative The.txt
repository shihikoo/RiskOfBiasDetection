Background and Purpose—Diabetes mellitus is a high-risk factor for ischemic stroke. Diabetic stroke patients suffer
worse outcomes, poor long-term recovery, risk of recurrent strokes, and extensive vascular damage. We investigated
the neurorestorative effects and the underlying mechanisms of stroke treatment with human umbilical cord blood cells
(HUCBCs) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats.
Methods—Adult male T2DM rats were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Three days after
MCAo, rats were treated via tail-vein injection with (1) PBS and (2) HUCBCs (5×106), n=10 per group.
Results—HUCBC stroke treatment initiated 3 days after MCAo in T2DM rats did not significantly decrease blood–brain
barrier leakage (P=0.1) and lesion volume (P=0.078), but significantly improved long-term functional outcome and
decreased brain hemorrhage (P<0.05) when compared with the PBS-treated T2DM MCAo control group. HUCBC
treatment significantly promoted white matter remodeling as indicated by increased expression of Bielschowsky silver
(axons marker), Luxol fast blue (myelin marker), SMI-31 (neurofilament), and Synaptophysin in the ischemic border
zone. HUCBC promoted vascular remodeling and significantly increased arterial and vascular density. HUCBC treatment
of stroke in T2DM rats significantly increased M2 macrophage polarization (increased M2 macrophage, CD163and CD
206; decreased M1 macrophage, ED1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression) in the ischemic brain compared
with PBS-treated T2DM MCAo controls (P<0.05). HUCBC also significantly decreased proinflammatory factors, that
is, matrix metalloproteinase 9, receptor for advanced glycation end products and toll-like receptor 4 expression in the
ischemic brain.
Conclusions—HUCBC treatment initiated 3 days after stroke significantly increased white matter and vascular remodeling in
the ischemic brain as well as decreased neuroinflammatory factor expression in the ischemic brain in T2DM rats and promoted
M2 macrophage polarization. HUCBC reduction of neuroinflammation and increased vascular and white matter axonal
remodeling may contribute to the HUCBC-induced beneficial effects in T2DM stroke rats.   (Stroke. 2015;46:2599-2606.

T

he global concern for stroke, a cardiovascular disease
that can lead to long term disability or even death, is rapidly growing. Among the prominent risk factors for ischemic
stroke is diabetes mellitus (DM). The combination of diabetes mellitus and stroke leads to extensive brain damage and
worse poststroke outcomes.1 The T2DM stroke combination
puts the patient at a risk of recurrent strokes2 and massive vascular damage leading to poor long-term functional recovery
and even lifelong paralysis. Although the only FDA-approved
drug for ischemic stroke is tissue-type plasminogen activator
that can breakdown the blood clot and restore blood flow to the

brain, the treatment is challenged by practicality because of
its narrow treatment window (3–4.5 hours after stroke onset).
Thus, there is a compelling need to develop and test neurorestorative therapeutic approaches for stroke, with treatment
initiated days after stroke.3 One such therapy uses HUCBCs to
induce neurorestorative effects post ischemic stroke.
HUCBCs therapy administered via tail vein injection
within 24 to 72 hours post an ischemic insult in nondiabetic
stroke rats has significant functional benefits associated with
the regulation of inflammatory and immune responses.4,5 In
T1DM rats, initiation of HUCBC treatment (5×106 cells) via

tail vein injection 24 hours post stroke had several beneficial
effects, including improved functional outcome, enhanced
vascular, and white matter (WM) remodeling.6 The primary
mechanism of action was attributed to increasing angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and decreasing inflammatory factor receptor
for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) expression in the
ischemic border zone (IBZ) in T1DM rats.6 T2DM mice that
underwent stroke had worse functional outcome, increased
brain hemorrhage, severe WM damage, and increased inflammatory factor matrix mettaloproteinase-9 (MMP9) expression.1 Mortality rates in diabetic stroke mice were significantly
greater than in wild-type mice.7 With T2DM being the most
common form of diabetes mellitus and the success of HUCBC
treatment in nondiabetic and T1DM stroke animals, our aim in
this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficiency and underlying mechanism of delayed HUCBC treatment in T2DM rats
when treatment is initiated 3 days after stroke.

Materials and Methods
All experiments were conducted in accordance with the standards and
procedures of the American Council on Animal Care and Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Henry Ford Health System.

Diabetes Induction
T2DM was induced using a combination of 2-week high-fat diet followed by low dose of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg, Sigma Chemical Co, St.
Louis, MO) intraperitoneal injection in adult male Wistar rats and continued a high-fat diet for another 2 weeks. Two weeks after streptozotocin
injection, the fasting blood glucose level was tested using a glucose analyzer (Accu-Chek Compact System; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis,
IN) and animals with fasting blood glucose >300 mg/dL underwent 2
hours of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo).

MCAo Model and Experiment Groups
Twenty-four T2DM rats were subjected to transient (2 hours) right
MCAo via intraluminal vascular occlusion, as previously described.8,9
The exclusion criteria were rats with modified neurological severity
score (mNSS) <6 (possibly small to no lesion) or >13 (poor survival)
at 24 hours after MCAo (before treatment). Accordingly, 4 rats were
excluded from this study. The rats were randomly assigned to different groups and treated with (1) PBS as vehicle control (n=10); (2)
HUCBCs (5×106, n=10; Saneron CCEL Therapeutics) via tail vein
injection starting at 3 days post MCAo. The treatment time point of
72 hours after stroke in T2DM rats was used to investigate HUCBCinduced neurorestorative effects as well as to accommodate a wide
treatment window. Rats were euthanized 28 days after MCAo for immunostaining quantification analysis.

Neurological Functional Tests
An investigator was blinded to the experimental groups to perform a
battery of functional tests, including foot-fault,10 adhesive removal,8
and evaluation of mNSS8 before MCAo and after MCAo on days 1,
7, 14, 21, and 28.

Histological and Immunohistochemical Assessment
Brains were fixed using transcardial perfusion with saline, followed
by perfusion and immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde. Then, the
brains were embedded in paraffin and a standard block was obtained
from the center of the lesion (bregma –2 mm to +2 mm). A series of
6-μm thick sections were cut from the block. Hematoxylin and eosin
stained 7 coronal sections of tissue were used for lesion volume calculation and presented as a percentage of lesion compared with the
contralateral hemisphere.

Brain coronal tissue sections were prepared and antibody against
α-smooth muscle actin (mouse monoclonal IgG, 1:800; Dako); Von
Willebrand factor (1:400; Dako); SMI-31 (Neurofilaments, phosphorylated monoclonal, 1:1000; Covance); Synaptophysin (monoclonal,
1:500; Millipore); RAGE (1:400; Dako); toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4;
goat polyclonal IgG, dilution 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology);
MMP9 (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); CD163 (1:500, Abcam
Cambridge, MA); ED1 (a mouse mAb against rat microglia/macrophages, monoclonal, 1:30; AbD Serotec); CD 206 (1:3000; Abcam);
and inducible nitric oxide synthase (1:200; Millipore) were used.
Antibody against albumin (albumin-fluorescein isothiocyanate polyclonal, 1:500; Abcam) was used to demonstrate blood–brain barrier
(BBB) leakage and Prussian blue staining used to evaluate hemorrhage. Bielschowsky silver immunostaining was used to demonstrate
axons, and luxol fast blue (LFB) staining was used to demonstrate
myelin. Control experiments consisted of staining brain coronal tissue sections as outlined above, but nonimmune serum was substituted
for the primary antibody.

Quantification Analysis
All the immunostaining quantification analysis was performed by an
investigator who was blinded to the experimental groups. Five slides
from each brain, with each slide containing 8 fields from striatum of
the IBZ were digitized under a ×20 objective (Olympus BX40) using
a 3-CCD color video camera (Sony DXC-970MD) interfaced with
an MCID image analysis system (Imaging Research, St. Catharines,
Canada). For Bielschowsky silver and LFB measurements, positive
areas of immunoreactive cells were measured in the WM bundles of the
striatum in the IBZ.11 For other immunostaining (albumin-fluorescein
isothiocyanate Prussian blue, Synaptophysin, SMI-31, RAGE, MMP9,
and TLR4), positive areas of immunoreactive cells were measured in
the IBZ, and for CD163, inducible nitric oxide synthase, ED1, and
CD206 positive cell number was measured in the IBZ.12

Vascular Density Measurement
To measure the vascular density in the IBZ, 8 fields of view of Von
Willebrand factor immunostaining from the IBZ were digitized using
a ×20 objective via the MCID software.13 The α-smooth muscle actin–
stained arteries were analyzed with regard to small and large vessels
(≥10 μm diameter). The arterial density in the IBZ was measured.14

Statistical Analysis
One-way ANOVA was used for the evaluation of functional outcome
and histology, respectively. Contract/estimate statement was used to
test the group difference. If an overall treatment group effect was
detected at P<0.05, pair-wise comparisons were made. All data are
presented as mean±SE.

Results
HUCBC Treatment Significantly Improved LongTerm Functional Outcome but Did Not Significantly
Decrease BBB Leakage and Lesion Volume
Long-term functional benefit derived from HUCBC treatment
initiated at 3 days after MCAo in T2DM rats was assessed
using a battery of behavioral tests. n=10 per group was used
and with a mortality rate of 20% (between days 7–14 after
MCAo), 8 rats per group survived at the end of experiments
in both treatment and control groups. Figure 1A presents
mNSS, adhesive removal, and foot-fault data for 28 days after
stroke that indicate significantly improved functional outcome
in T2DM MCAo rats treated with HUCBCs compared with
PBS-treated control group (P<0.05).

body weight and blood glucose level and did not significantly decrease lesion volume (P=0.078; Figure 1C) and

albumin immunostaining (P=0.1; Figure 1B) compared
with PBS-treated T2DM MCAo rats.

To test the beneficial effects of HUCBC treatment, vascular
remodeling was evaluated using α-smooth muscle actin and
Von Willebrand factor immunostaining. Figure 2 indicates
that HUCBC significantly enhanced cerebral artery density

HUCBC Stroke Treatment Promoted White Matter
Remodeling and Increased Axonal and Synaptic
Plasticity
Bielschowsky silver and LFB staining were used to evaluate
the beneficial effects of HUCBC treatment on WM remodeling. HUCBC treatment significantly increased Bielschowsky
silver and LFB expression (Figure 3A and 3B) in the WM bundles compared with PBS-treated T2DM MCAo rats (P<0.05).
HUCBC treatment also regulated axonal and synaptic plasticity, indicated by significantly increased SMI-31 (Figure 3C)
and Synaptophysin (Figure 3D) expression levels in the IBZ
compared with PBS-treated T2DM MCAo rats (P<0.05).

HUCBC Stroke Treatment Significantly Decreased
Neuroinflammatory Factor Expression and
Increased M2 Macrophage Polarization in the IBZ
To understand the mechanisms of HUCBC therapy–derived
benefits, neuroinflammation was evaluated in the ischemic
brain. Expression levels of inflammatory factors TLR4,
MMP9, and RAGE were measured in the IBZ. As indicated
in Figure 4, HUCBC treatment significantly decreased TLR4,
MMP9, and RAGE (P<0.05) expression compared with PBStreated T2DM stroke rats (P<0.05).
To test the effect of HUCBC treatment on macrophage
polarization, expression levels of M2 macrophage markers,
CD163 and CD206, and M1 macrophage markers, ED1 and
inducible nitric oxide synthase, were measured. Figure 5
shows that HUCBC treatment in T2DM MCAo rats significantly increased M2 and decreased M1 macrophage expression in the ischemic brain in comparison with PBS-treated
T2DM stroke rats (P<0.05).

Discussion
HUCBCs have received a great deal of attention as a treatment option for hematologic disorders and malignancies as

they are a rich source of hematopoietic stem cells. The driving
advantages in using HUCBCs include easy availability as it
is discarded post birth, lack of ethical conflicts, and none to
low severity effects like graft versus host disease from donorrecipient human leukocyte antigen mismatch.15 This tolerance of HUCBC therapy to donor-recipient human leukocyte
antigen mismatch aided by cord blood’s naïve and immature
immune function15 plays a key role in translating this therapy
to the clinic. We found that HUCBC therapy in T2DM rats initiated intravenously at 3 days post stroke, did not significantly
decrease BBB leakage and lesion volume, but significantly
decreased brain hemorrhagic transformation and significantly increased vascular and WM remodeling and improved
functional recovery. The underlying mechanisms of HUCBC
induced benefits maybe decreasing neuroinflammatory effects
and promotion of M2 macrophage polarization.
Several stroke treatments in the diabetic rat population have failed, including bone marrow stromal cells16
and tissue-type plasminogen activator.17 These failures
were associated with increased BBB leakage, brain hemorrhagic transformation, and inflammation in T1DM16,17 and
T2DM18 rats. In this study, significant functional benefit
was derived on HUCBC therapy, although we found that
HUCBC treatment initiated 3 days after stroke in T2DM did
not significantly decrease BBB leakage and lesion volume
compared with T2DM PBS-treated stroke rats. These data
suggest that HUCBC-induced therapeutic and functional
benefits in T2DM stroke rats may primarily be derived from
the regulation of vascular and WM remodeling. In nondiabetic rats, hemorrhagic transformation and BBB leakage
occur early after stroke, but in diabetic rats, these events
have an extended time window and are present at 14 days
after stroke.12,16 Although the 28-day time point is not ideal
for studying BBB permeability and hemorrhagic transformation which occur acutely after stroke,19,20 because we
observed HUCBC treatment–induced functional benefits
starting at 14 days after stroke, we elected not to perform
these measurements at an early time point.

A multifaceted mechanism of action has been suggested by
several studies using cell-based therapies to promote poststroke
long-term beneficial effects; minor benefit derived from a small
portion of infused cells migrating to the brain and differentiating into neuronal cells, and major benefit derived by promoting various aspects of neurorestoration like WM remodeling,
vascular remodeling, synaptogenesis, and neurogenesis by (1)
enhancing endogenous brain repair mechanisms and (2) secreting trophic and growth factors. Stroke decreases cerebral blood
flow and triggers vascular remodeling to improve blood supply
via angiogenesis and arteriogenesis.21 Increasing angiogenesis
and arteriogenesis are correlated with neurological functional
outcome after stroke.22 In T2DM mice, poor functional outcome
was correlated with exacerbated WM and vascular damage
compared with nondiabetic stroke mice.1 HUCBC treatment
increased cerebral arterial and vascular density in the IBZ.
These results indicate that HUCBC stroke treatment induces an
increase in cerebral vascular remodeling in T2DM rats.

WM of brain is highly susceptible to ischemic stress primarily because of its relatively limited blood supply. Hence,
after a stroke, WM recovery is critical for sustained long-term
functional recovery. HUCBC treatment enhanced the expression of Bielschowsky silver, SMI-31, and LFB in the IBZ indicative of enhanced axonal plasticity and myelin regeneration.
Several studies point toward axonal remodeling to improve
brain repair, attenuate stroke-induced neurological deficits,
and to contribute long-term benefits in functional improvement.23–25 At the same time, worse outcomes in DM stroke
subjects have been associated with defective or restricted
axonal regeneration.26,27 The importance of enhanced axonal
myelination centers on faster communication and sensory/
motor reflexes which helps restore lost neurological function
and decreases stroke-induced paralytic symptoms. Stroke not
only leads to loss of myelin in the peri-infarct area at 48 hours
after onset but also stimulates the formation of new myelin
around the damaged and sprouting axons.28 This endogenous

brain repair process is significantly enhanced by HUCBC treatment to promote the expression of LFB, a myelin marker, in
the ischemic brain regions. HUCBC treatment also enhanced
synaptic plasticity, indicated by increased Synaptophysin
expression in the IBZ. Intercellular communication between
neurons and other neurons/cells is facilitated via a synapse in
the central nervous system, and improved synaptic plasticity
indicated by enhanced Synaptophysin expression has been
reported to mediate stroke treatment benefits.29 Enhanced axonal and myelin remodeling and axonal and synaptic plasticity
may contribute to the observed HUCBC treatment induced
post stroke recovery in T2DM rats.
Regulation of the inflammatory responses induced by
stroke early after onset lasting up to weeks later is crucial
for effectiveness of stroke treatments. While mild inflammation can be favorable for brain repair in a chronic stage,30 in
the acute phase, on uncontrolled inflammation the activated
microglia, astrocytes, and macrophages can exacerbate damage or death to the injured brain by releasing proinflammatory factors and by creating an inhospitable environment for
neurovascular plasticity.31,32 MMP9 has been implicated in
enhancing T2DM-induced WM and axonal damage.1,33 TLR4
and RAGE are both inflammatory factors typically increased
in diabetic stroke animals and have been implicated in exacerbating brain damage.34,35 HMGB1 (high-mobility group box
1) is an inflammatory mediator secreted on injury by immune
cells or injured cells. HMGB1 release can trigger an inflammatory cascade and binds to its receptors, TLR4 and RAGE.
It has been reported that in cerebral ischemia HMGB1 triggers
MMP9 increase in neurons and astrocytes mainly through

TLR4.36 Hence, treatments that can regulate the HMGB1/
TLR4 signaling pathway can potentially decrease tissue damage by controlling postischemic inflammatory responses.
HUCBC treatment significantly decreased the expression levels of these detrimental inflammatory factors (TLR4, RAGE,
and MMP9) in the IBZ and induced restorative effects in
T2DM stroke rats.
M2 macrophage polarization has been associated with
decreased neuroinflammation and enhanced axon growth in
injured mouse spinal cord.37 Our data show that M2 macrophage polarization was significantly increased by HUCBC
treatment in the IBZ of T2DM MCAo rats. M2 macrophage
polarization, marked by increased M2 macrophage CD163
and decreased M1 macrophage ED1 expression, was evident
with HUCBC treatment. The M2 macrophage polarization
mechanism can improve functional outcome post stroke.38
Microglia and macrophages on ischemic insult can assume an
anti-inflammatory M2 activation and protect neurons; which
is a potential target for neurorestorative therapies.39,40 Soon
after focal cerebral ischemia, the local and infiltrating macrophages assume M2 phenotype and decrease the expression of
inflammatory factors thereby extending a protective effect to
the neurons and improving their survival in the ischemic environment.39 Extending the M2 phase of these macrophages and
microglia and delaying their transit into M1 phenotype, which
is detrimental to the ischemic brain because of increased proinflammatory factor production, is a desirable effect. HUCBC
treatment promotes M2 macrophage polarization which may
contribute to improved neurological outcome. Although it is
common knowledge that macrophage invasion starts around

24 hours after stroke and increases by 3 to 7 days after stroke,
recent studies have revealed that the increased level of macrophage accumulation in the brain persists to at least 28 days
after stroke,41 lasting ≤1 year after stroke.42 The links between
M2 polarization and HUCBC-induced regulation of neuroinflammation and WM and vascular remodeling leading to beneficial effects are not clear, and further studies are warranted.

Conclusions
Treatment of stroke initiated 3 days post the ischemic insult via
intravenous administration of HUCBCs in T2DM rats significantly improves functional recovery by enhancing WM axonal
and vascular remodeling in the ischemic brain. Our data suggest that decreasing neuroinflammatory factors and increasing
M2 macrophage polarization may be contributing mechanisms
underlying HUCBC treatment–derived beneficial effects.
