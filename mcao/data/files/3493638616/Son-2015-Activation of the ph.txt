Abstract
Cerebral infarction causes permanent neuronal loss inducing
severe morbidity and mortality. Because hypertension is the main
risk factor for cerebral infarction and most patients with hypertension take antihypertensive drugs daily, the neuroprotective
effects and mechanisms of anti-hypertensive drugs need to be
investigated. Cilnidipine, a long-acting, new generation 1,4dihydropyridine inhibitor of both L- and N-type calcium channels,
was reported to reduce oxidative stress. In this study, we
investigated whether cilnidipine has therapeutic effects in an
animal model of cerebral infarction. After determination of the
most effective dose of cilnidipine, a total of 128 rats were
subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion. Neurobehavioral
function test and brain MRI were performed, and rats with similar
sized infarcts were randomized to either the cilnidipine group or
the control group. Cilnidipine treatment was performed with
reperfusion after 2-h occlusion. Western blots and immunohis-

tochemistry were also performed after 24-h occlusion. Initial
infarct volume on diffusion-weighted MRI was not different
between the cilnidipine group and the control group; however,
ﬂuid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI at 24 h showed significantly reduced infarct volume in the cilnidipine group compared
with the control group. Cilnidipine treatment signiﬁcantly
decreased the number of triphosphate nick end labeling-positive
cells compared to the control group. Western blot and immunohistochemistry showed increased expression of phosphorylated
Akt (Ser473), phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3b, and
Bcl-2 and decreased expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3.
These results suggest that cilnidipine, which is used for the
treatment of hypertension, has neuroprotective effects in the
ischemic brain through activation of the PI3K pathway.

Cerebral ischemia activates a variety of neuronal cell death
mechanisms, such as oxidative stress, inﬂammation, excitotoxicity, ionic imbalances, and apoptosis. These mechanisms
ultimately lead to cerebral infarction causing severe morbidity and mortality (Sahota and Savitz 2011). To prevent these
cell death mechanisms, many researchers have focused on
developing and discovering neuroprotective agents. Because
hypertension is one of the main risk factors for cerebral
infarction and patients with hypertension need to take
antihypertensive drugs daily, the neuroprotective effects of
antihypertensive drugs need to be investigated.
The neuroprotective effects of calcium channel blockers
have been controversial. Nifedipine and nimodipine specifically block L-type calcium channels. Nifedipine has been
reported to have beneﬁcial effects by attenuating excitatory

amino acid neurotoxicity (Weiss et al. 1990). Several
different studies also suggested that nimodipine could have
neuroprotective effects in acute cerebral infarction patients

Cilnidipine reduces cerebral infarction

(Gelmers et al. 1988; Martinez-Vila et al. 1990). Since these
reports, however, several researchers have shown that
treatment with nimodipine had no neuroprotective effect in
acute cerebral infarction patients (The American Nimodipine
Study Group 1992). Meta-analysis also ruled out clinically
beneﬁcial effects of these calcium channel blockers on
cerebral infarction (Horn and Limburg 2001). Cilnidipine
blocks both L- and N-type calcium channels and is a longacting, new generation 1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP) (Yoshimoto et al. 1991; Hosono et al. 1992; Tominaga et al. 1997;
Takahara et al. 2004; Takeda et al. 2004). It has been
reported to reduce infarction volume in the rat focal brain
ischemia model (Takahara et al. 2004). Cilnidipine was
conﬁrmed to reduce oxidative stress and activate the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3k) pathway in our previous
in vitro study (Lee et al. 2009).
In this study, we investigated whether cilnidipine has
neuroprotective effects on an animal model of ischemic
stroke and the mechanism of such a neuroprotective effect in
cerebral infarction.

Methods
Animal preparation and experimental protocols
We conducted all experiments involving animals in compliance
with the Hanyang University guidelines for the care and use of
laboratory animals. Our studies were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Hanyang University. Adult
male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 250–270 g were purchased
from Orient Bio Incorporated (Seoul, Korea). After periods of
adaptation and pre-training for neurological examination for
7 days, the left middle cerebral arteries of 128 Sprague–Dawley
rats weighing 280–300 g were occluded for 2 h using the
intraluminal ﬁlament technique described previously (Koh et al.
2004, 2005, 2008a,b,c). The rats were anesthetized with isoﬂurane
(3% for induction and 2% for surgical procedure) in a mixture of
oxygen/nitrous oxide (30%/70%). Body temperature was maintained at 36.6  0.5°C with a thermistor-controlled heating pad.
After 2 h of occlusion, reperfusion was performed as described
previously (Koh et al. 2004, 2005, 2008a,c). A sham surgery was
performed on additional rats by introducing and then immediately
withdrawing a thread into the left common carotid artery. Other
procedures in the sham group were identical to those used in the
ischemic surgery.
Determination of the most effective dose and time window
Cilnidipine was a generous gift from UCB Japan Co., Ltd. (Tokyo,
Japan). Before use, cilnidipine was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide.
In the ﬁrst experiment to determine the most effective dose, rats
were randomly divided into four groups (each n = 13) treated with
different doses of cilnidipine (control, 1, 10, and 100 lg/kg) just
before reperfusion. In the second experiment to determine the most
effective time window, the most effective dose (10 lg/kg) was
randomly administered to four groups (each n = 13) at different
time points (control, 2, 6, and 24 h). All rats were killed 48 h after
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and the infarct volume

187

was calculated after staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) as described previously
(Koh et al. 2004).
Evaluation of neurologic deficit
A modiﬁed neurologic severity score (mNSS) was measured just
before MCAO, just before reperfusion, and 2, 6, 24, and 48 h after
MCAO (just before killing) with the most effective dose of
cilnidipine by an investigator who was blinded to the experimental
groups. Distribution of rats to the cilnidipine or control groups was
based on mNSS score just before reperfusion. This score was
comprised of consciousness (0, normal; 1, restless; 2, lethargic; 3,
stuporous), gait (0, normal; 1, paw adduction; 2, unbalanced
walking; 3, circling; 4, unable to stand; 5, no movement), and limb
tone (0, normal; 1, spastic; 2, ﬂaccid). Neurological function was
graded on a scale of 0–10 (normal score, 0; maximal deﬁcit score,
10) (Koh et al. 2008a,b,c).
MRI protocol for experimental rats
After determination of optimal therapeutic dose and time, we
performed a randomized study based on diffusion-weighted MRI
(DWI). All MR images were obtained with a 3-Telsa MR machine
(Achieva; Philips, Best, The Netherlands) with a four-channel phased
array coil (Mouse coil; Shanghai Chenguang Medical Technology,
Shanghai, China). All rats underwent DWI (TR/TE = 8800/160 ms,
slice thickness/gap = 5/2 mm, matrix = 128 9 128, FOV = 240
9 240 mm) 1 h after MCAO. The rats were randomized to either
cilnidipine group (10 lg/kg) or control group (saline 1 mL). Rats
were subjected to ﬂuid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI
(TR/TE/TI = 11 000/125/2800 ms, slice thickness/gap = 5/2 mm;
matrix = 352 9 189, FOV = 230 9 183 mm) 24 h after MCAO.
The ﬁnal infarct volume was also independently assessed with
Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization (MIPAV) by
two experienced radiologists without any knowledge of experimental
information. The ﬁnal infarct volume was calculated by averages of
two measurements. All animals were sacriﬁced for histological and
immunohistochemistry assessments after FLAIR MRI.
TUNEL assay
To detect apoptotic cells caused by ischemic stroke, we performed
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine
triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) (Roche Boehringer
Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Cilnidipine was administered
in three different concentrations for sham, control, and 10 lg/kg
groups. After sacriﬁce, brains of each group were transcardially
perfused with 0.9% sodium chloride. Brains were swiftly removed
and ﬁxed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde solution and then
cryoprotected in a 30% sucrose solution for 3 days. Each brain was
mounted on a cold metal block using optimal cutting temperature
compound (Sakura Tissue Tek, Torrance, CA, USA). Coronal
sections (20 lm thickness) were cut on a motorized cryostat (Leica,
Richmond, IL, USA) at 20°C. Slides were stored at 4°C and
processed for TUNEL staining. After washing the ﬁxed tissues with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min, the tissues were
incubated with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 10 min. The tissues were
rinsed with PBS and placed in 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium
citrate for 2 min on ice. We washed the tissues three more times,
added TUNEL reaction mixture, and ﬁnally placed them in a 37°C

incubator without light for 1 h. After three more washings with
PBS, the tissues were mounted with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA,
USA). We then counted TUNEL-positive cells.
Western blot
The frozen brain tissues of two mice from the sham group, two from
the control group, and two from the cilnidipine group were rapidly
microdissected on an ice-chilled plate. The peri-infarct zones were
then used in western blot analysis. The microdissected tissue was
homogenized by 1.0 mL Wheaton Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton,
Millville, NJ, USA) and a type B pestle in 10 : 1 volume/weight
buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mM EGTA, 250 mM
sucrose, 2 lg/mL aprotinin, 5 lg/mL leuperptin, 2 lg/mL pepstatin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl ﬂuoride. The protein
concentration of the tissue lysate was determined by Bio-Rad
(Hercules, CA, USA) protein assay kit. An equal amount (20 lg) of
protein was resolved on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 2% skim milk before
incubation with speciﬁc primary antibodies including phosphorylated Akt (ser473) (1 : 500; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA),
Bcl-2 (1 : 1000; Cell Signaling), Bax (1 : 500; Cell Signaling), and
cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175) (1 : 500; Cell Signaling). Primary
antibodies were added to each membrane overnight. On the next
day, the membranes were washed three times using 0.1% Tween-20
in Tris-buffered saline for 10 min each. They were then washed
three more times with 0.1% Tween-20 in Tris-buffered saline.
Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (1 : 2000; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ,
USA) was used as a secondary antibody. Finally, the membrane was
read using enhanced chemiluminescence detection solution (GenDepot, Barker, TX, USA). The results of western blots were quantiﬁed
with image analyzer (ImageQuant LAS 4000; GE Healthcare,
Piscataway, NJ, USA).
Immunohistochemistry
For immunohistochemistry, four rats from each of the groups
were selected, anesthetized with isoﬂurane, and perfused with
0.9% sodium chloride and 4% paraformaldehyde. Immunohistochemical staining was performed as previously described (Koh
et al. 2004, 2008a,b,c). Fixed tissues were permeabilized with
0.5% Triton X-100 in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline
(DPBS) for 20 min. Next, 3% H2O2 was used to block
endogenous peroxidase activity of the tissues for 20 min, and
tissues were washed with DPBS for 10 min. Tissues were
incubated overnight with 0.5% fetal bovine serum in primary
antibodies for phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase (pGSK)3b (Ser9) (1 : 500; Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA, USA)
and cleaved caspase-3 (1 : 500; Cell Signaling). Next, tissues
were incubated in secondary antibodies diluted in 0.5% fetal
bovine serum for 60 min. Anti-rabbit tetramethylrhodamine
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) or goat anti-mouse Alexa
Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) was used for detecting the primary
antibody. Next, tissues were mounted with DAPI mounting
solution (Vector Laboratories). Immunohistochemically positive
cells were identiﬁed under a ﬂuorescence microscope (Olympus,
Center Valley, PA, USA). The quantity of positive cells was
expressed as the average number of positive cells per high-

powered ﬁeld (9200). As a negative control, the above procedures were repeated without primary antibodies, which resulted in
no stained cells.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean  SEM from ﬁve or more
independent experiments. To determine normal distributions, a
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was performed on all data sets. The two
groups were compared statistically by t-test, and the analysis of
three or more data sets was performed using one-way ANOVA
followed by Tukey’s post hoc comparisons. Two-tailed p-values
< 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant. All statistical
analyses were performed using the SPSS 17.0 software package for
Windows (SPSS, Seoul, Korea).

Results
Reduced infarct volume by cilnidipine on TTC staining
Administration of cilnidipine 2 h after MCAO with reperfusion decreased infarct volume on TTC staining at 48 h after
MCAO. Cilnidipine had beneﬁcial effects at 1 and 10 lg/kg
but not at 100 lg/kg. The most effective dose was 10 lg/kg,
so subsequent experiments were performed with this dosage
(Fig. 1a and b). In experiments to determine the optimal
therapeutic time window, cilnidipine (10 lg/kg) was consistently beneﬁcial regardless of time (2, 6, or 24 h); however,
infarct volume was smallest at 2 h (Fig. 1c). Therefore,
administration 2 h after MCAO was used for the main
experiments.
Reduced modified neurologic severity score by cilnidipine
Only 10 lg/kg cilnidipine signiﬁcantly reduced mNSS after
MCAO, and the beneﬁcial effect was consistent regardless of
time (2, 6, or 24 h) (Fig. 2a and b).
Effect of cilnidipine in randomization study based on MRI
To determine whether cilnidipine treatment has a beneﬁcial
effect on infarct volume, we performed a randomization study
based on DWI. Infarct volume of rats was measured 1 h after
MCAO, and rats with similar sized infarcts were randomized
to either treatment or control groups. Based on initial DWI,
the mean infarct volumes (SD) in the cilnidipine and control
groups had no difference (91.04 mm3 vs. 96.56 mm3
respectively) (Fig. 3, p = 0.12). However, FLAIR MRI
performed 24 h after MCAO showed signiﬁcantly reduced
infarct volume in the cilnidipine group compared with the
control group (101.62 mm3 vs. 180.50 mm3, respectively),
suggesting that infarct volume was signiﬁcantly attenuated by
cilnidipine (Fig. 3, p = 0.003).
Effect of cilnidipine on expression TUNEL assay
The number of TUNEL-positive cells in the peri-infarct
region of the cilnidipine group (277  12/HPF) was less
than that of the control group (492  20/HPF) (Fig. 4,
p = 0.004).

Fig. 1 Effect of cilnidipine on infarct volume on 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. We sacriﬁced rats 24 h after middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery. (a–c) Then we performed
TTC staining. (d) In the experiment to study the varying effects of
different cilnidipine concentrations on cerebral infarction, 10 lg/kg
cilnidipine decreased infarct volume most signiﬁcantly. On the other

hand, all rats treated with 100 lg/kg died. (e) In the experiment to
evaluate the effect of cilnidipine depending on treatment time after
MCAO, 2 h was most effective although treatment at other time points
had some effect. All groups were analyzed via a Tukey’s test after
one-way ANOVA. *p < 0.05 (vs. control group); **p < 0.01 (vs. control
group).

Fig. 2 Effect of cilnidipine on neurobehavioral function after cerebral
infarction. We evaluated neurobehavioral function test just before
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), just before reperfusion, and
48 h after MCAO. Cilnidipine 10 lg/kg (a) delivered 2 h after MCAO

(b) was the most effective regimen for improving neurobehavioral
function 48 h after MCAO. All groups were analyzed via a Tukey’s test
after one-way ANOVA. *p < 0.05 (vs. control group); **p < 0.01 (vs.
control group).

Effect of cilnidipine on intracellular signals
To investigate mechanisms underlying cilnidipine-induced
neuroprotection after ischemic stroke, immunoreactivities of
phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) (Ser473), phosphorylated GSK3beta (pGSK-3beta) (Ser9), Bcl-2, Bax, and cleaved caspase3 were measured in the ischemic penumbra. The results of
western blots showed that the immunoreactivities of pAkt,
pGSK-3beta, and Bcl-2, which are survival-related proteins,
were signiﬁcantly increased in the cilnidipine group compared with the control group (Fig. 5a, b, c); however, Bax

and cleaved caspase-3, which are death-related proteins, were
relatively decreased after cilnidipine treatment (Fig. 5d, e).
Immunohistochemistry also showed increased decreased
cleaved caspase-3 after cilnidipine treatment (Fig. 5f).

Discussion
Cilnidipine, which is used as an antihypertensive drug, is a
long-acting, slow-onset, new generation DHP, which can
block both L- and N-type Ca2+ channels (Yoshimoto et al.

Fig. 3 Effect of cilnidipine in randomization study based on MRI. Between
control and cilnidipine groups, there was no
difference in diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI);
however, on ﬂuid-attenuated inversion
recovery (FLAIR), infarct volume was
signiﬁcantly less in the cilnidipine group
than in the control group. All groups were

1991; Hosono et al. 1992; Takahara et al. 2004). Cilnidipine
has been known to induce vasodilatation by blocking L-type
calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle (Lohn et al.
2002). Since it was suggested that nifedipine attenuated slow
excitatory amino acid neurotoxicity by inhibiting calcium
inﬂux through voltage-gated channels (Weiss et al. 1990),
there have been many studies to conﬁrm whether DHPs have
neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke (Gelmers et al.
1988; Martinez-Vila et al. 1990; Fogelholm et al. 2000;
Horn and Limburg 2001). Unlike L-type calcium channels,
some previous reports have suggested that N-type calcium
channels play an important role in neuronal cell death.
Therefore, their antagonists may reduce infarct volume in
focal cerebral ischemia (Takizawa et al. 1995; Pringle et al.
1996; Perez-Pinzon et al. 1997). It was reported that
cilnidipine reduced infarct volume in focal cerebral infarction, although the report did not show the exact action
mechanism (Takahara et al. 2004). In this study, cilnidipine
was administered just before reperfusion. This is an advantage from a previous examination (Takahara et al. 2004),

since patients with cerebral infarction is pharmacologically
treated after occlusion of the cerebral artery.
Furthermore, our in vitro ischemic injury model conﬁrmed
that the neuroprotective mechanisms of cilnidipine were
achieved by lowering the free radical production induced by
oxidative stress, increasing PI3K, pAkt, pGSK-3b, and
HSTF-1, and decreasing cytochrome c release and caspase-3
activation (Lee et al. 2009). In this study, we conﬁrmed that
the neuroprotective mechanisms of cilnidipine were achieved
by increasing pAkt, Bcl-2, and pGSK-3b and decreasing Bax
and caspase-3 activation in an animal model of ischemic
stroke similar to the in vitro ischemia model.
The PI3K/Akt pathway is a major pathway in cell survival.
It upregulates anti-apoptotic proteins and down-regulates
pro-apoptotic proteins (Cantrell 2001; Cantley 2002; Lee
et al. 2008). Activated PI3K phosphorylates its downstream
target Akt/protein kinase B to mediate several biochemical
cascades (Pap and Cooper 2002). Phosphorylated Akt
directly inﬂuences GSK-3b, Bcl-2-associated apoptosis
promoter (BAD)/Bcl-2, caspase-9, IkB kinase, and Fork

prepared three samples from sham, control,
and 10 lg/kg cilnidipine groups. DAPI
staining and triphosphate nick end labeling
(TUNEL) assay were done (a) and the
percent of TUNEL-positive cells among
DAPI-positive cells was calculated (b).
TUNEL assay showed that 10 lg/kg
cilnidipine reduced apoptosis by 60%
compared to the control group. All groups
were analyzed via a Tukey’s test after oneway ANOVA. **p < 0.01 (vs. control group).

Cilnidipine reduces cerebral infarction

191

Fig. 5 Effect of cilnidipine on intracellular signaling proteins. Using
western blot, we identiﬁed the alteration of intracellular signaling
proteins after treatment with 10 lg/kg cilnidipine. (a–c) Cilnidipine
10 lg/kg increases the expression of phospho-AKT (Ser 473) and Bcl2, which are survival-related proteins. (d, e) On the other hand, Bax
and cleaved caspase-3, which are apoptosis-associated proteins,
were reduced in 10 lg/kg cilnidipine-treated rats. Through immunohistochemistry (IHC), we also conﬁrmed the beneﬁcial effect of

cilnidipine on intracellular signaling proteins after middle cerebral
artery occlusion. (f) DAPI staining and immunohistochemistry for
cleaved caspase-3 were performed (a), the percent of cleaved
caspase-3-positive cells among DAPI-positive cells was calculated
(b) and cilnidipine (10 lg/kg) decreased the expression of cleaved
caspase-3. All groups were analyzed via a Tukey’s test after one-way
ANOVA. *p < 0.05 (vs. control group); **p < 0.01 (vs. control group).

head-related transcription factor 1 (Pap and Cooper 2002;
Lee et al. 2008). The active form of GSK-3b inhibits HSTF1 and enhances the mitochondrial death pathway associated
with increased cytochrome c release from mitochondria and
activation of caspase-3 (Frame et al. 2001; Pap and Cooper
2002; Koh et al. 2008b,c), so inactivation of the active form
of GSK-3b by pAkt is important in neuronal cell survival. In
this study, we conﬁrmed that activation of the PI3K pathway
is involved in the neuroprotective effect of cilnidipine in
cerebral infarction.
Our study revealed another distinct ﬁnding. By evaluating
neurobehavioral function and performing a randomization
study based on MRI, we conﬁrmed the neuroprotective effect
of cilnidipine in ischemic stroke, unlike in the previous study

(Takahara et al. 2004). In this study, administration of 10 lg/
kg cilnidipine improved neurobehavioral function. Infarct
volume based on DWI in FLAIR MRI was measured 24 h
after MCAO in the randomization study to minimize selection
bias and was signiﬁcantly decreased in the cilnidipine group.
These ﬁndings further raised the possibility that cilnidipine has
neuroprotective effects in acute cerebral infarction patients.
There are several limitations to this study. First, it is
apparent that no single animal model can precisely replicate
human cerebral infarction. Thus, future studies in other
ischemic stroke animal models are warranted. Second, we
did not conduct a mechanistic study to conﬁrm the precise
point of action of cilnidipine. Therefore, further studies are
needed to deﬁne the exact mechanism of action for

cilnidipine. Third, although we suggested that the neuroprotective effect of cilnidipine on ischemic stroke is associated
with the activation of the PI3K pathway based on the ﬁnding
that the signaling proteins, which belong to the PI3K
pathway, were increased in the cilnidipine-treated group,
we did not use any speciﬁc inhibitor of PI3K to block the
neuroprotective effect of cilnidipine and PI3K activators to
compare their effects with the ones of cilnidipine. In our
previous reports using in vitro ischemic injury model (Lee
et al. 2008, 2009), however, we showed that cilnidipine
deﬁnitely has a neuroprotective effect and its effect is
associated with the activation of the PI3K pathway based on
the result that PI3K speciﬁc inhibitors block the neuroprotective effect of cilnidipine. And, in this experiment, we
wanted to conﬁrm whether cilnidipine has neuroprotective
effects in vivo ischemic stroke model and if its effect is
associated with the activation of the PI3K pathway, as it is in
in vitro studies. In any case, we think that further in vivo
studies are needed to deﬁne the exact role of the PI3K
pathway in the neuroprotective effect of cilnidipine in vivo
stroke model. In this former experiment, our data had been
obtained from surviving animals 48 h after MCAO, so we
were unable to entirely exclude selection bias in analyzing
the neuroprotective effect of cilnidipine. However, there
were minimal differences in the survival rate of each group.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the neuroprotective
effect and action mechanism of cilnidipine in an acute
ischemic stroke model. Considering the daily use of antihypertensive drugs for patients with hypertension, cilnidipine
could be especially effective for patients with ischemic stroke.
