The Na ⫹-Ca 2⫹ exchanger 1 (NCX1) is reduced in stroke by the RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST), whereas it is increased in
ischemic brain preconditioning (PC) by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Because ncx1 brain promoter (ncx1-Br) has five putative
consensus sequences, named Sp1A–E, for the specificity protein (Sp) family of transcription factors (Sp1– 4), we investigated the role of
this family in regulating ncx1 transcription in rat cortical neurons. Here we found that Sp1 is a transcriptional activator, whereas Sp3 is
a transcriptional repressor of ncx1, and that both bind ncx1-Br in a sequence-specific manner, modulating ncx1 transcription through the
Sp1 sites C–E. Furthermore, by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in rats, the transcriptional repressors Sp3 and REST
colocalized with the two histone-deacetylases (HDACs) HDAC1 and HDAC2 on the ncx1-Br, with a consequent hypoacetylation. Contrarily, in PC⫹tMCAO the transcriptional activators Sp1 and HIF-1 colocalized with histone acetyltransferase p300 on ncx1-Br with a
consequent hyperacetylation. In addition, in neurons silenced with siRNA of NCX1 and subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation
(OGD) (3 h) plus reoxygenation (RX) (24 h), the neuroprotection of Class I HDAC inhibitor MS-275 was counteracted, whereas in neurons
overexpressing NCX1 and subjected to ischemic preconditioning (PC⫹OGD/RX), the neurotoxic effect of p300 inhibitor C646 was
prevented. Collectively, these results demonstrate that NCX1 expression is regulated by the Sp3/REST/HDAC1/HDAC2 complex in
tMCAO and by the Sp1/HIF-1/p300 complex in PC⫹tMCAO and that epigenetic intervention, by modulating the acetylation of ncx1-Br,
may be a strategy for the development of innovative therapeutic intervention in stroke.

gression of stroke (Annunziato et al., 2004; Pignataro et al., 2004)
and for the reduction of the cerebral infarct damage elicited by
ischemic preconditioning (Valsecchi et al., 2011; Pignataro et al.,
2012). Indeed, studies have shown that ncx1 ablation markedly
increases infarct volume after stroke (Pignataro et al., 2004;
Boscia et al., 2006) and partially reverts preconditioning-induced
neuroprotection (Pignataro et al., 2012). We previously demonstrated that in an in vivo model of stroke, obtained by transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), NCX1 reduction is
due to RE1-Silencing Transcription factor (REST) (Formisano et
al., 2013), which regulates global gene expression after stroke
(Noh et al., 2012; Schweizer et al., 2013; Kaneko et al., 2014).
Instead, NCX1 increase in ischemic preconditioning plus ischemia (PC⫹tMCAO) is determined by hypoxia-inducible factor 1
(HIF-1) (Valsecchi et al., 2011). Interestingly, the ncx1 brain promoter (ncx1-Br) sequence contains several consensus binding
sites for Specific protein 1 (Sp1). Sp proteins comprise four isoforms, Sp1-Sp4 (Suske, 1999), which recognize the same Sp1
sequence with similar affinities (Hwang et al., 2001). The only
exception is Sp2, which binds to a GT-rich element instead
(Philipsen and Suske, 1999). Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 can act as either

activators (Ammanamanchi et al., 2003; Ishimaru et al., 2007;
Ravache et al., 2010) or repressors (Ammanamanchi and Brattain, 2001; Ramos et al., 2009; Law et al., 2011) of gene expression.
Therefore, both the presence of several binding sites for Sp1 on
the ncx1-Br region and that Sp1 is involved in NGF-induced
regulation of NCX1 (Sirabella et al., 2012) prompted us to investigate the relationship between the members of the Sp family and
its role in modulating NCX1 expression during tMCAO and
PC⫹tMCAO. Furthermore, because REST reduces NCX1 expression during tMCAO (Formisano et al., 2013) and HIF-1
increases NCX1 expression during PC⫹tMCAO, we also investigated the possible interaction between REST and Sp3 and
between HIF-1 and Sp1 after tMCAO and PC⫹tMCAO, respectively. In addition, because both REST and Sp3 modulate their
target genes via the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family (Won et
al., 2002; Rodenas-Ruano et al., 2012), we investigated whether
the interaction between REST and Sp3 forms a protein complex
which, in turn, recruits HDAC1 and HDAC2, thus repressing
ncx1 expression after tMCAO. Moreover, considering that histone acetyl transferase (HAT) is involved in gene expression induced by HIF-1 and Sp1 (Billon et al., 1999; Ke and Costa, 2006),
we investigated whether the interaction between HIF-1 and Sp1
forms a protein complex that recruits the HAT p300, and activates ncx1 expression after PC⫹tMCAO. Finally, we assessed the
effect of the Class I HDAC inhibitor MS-275 (Lanzillotta et al.,
2013; Formisano et al., 2015b) and of the HAT p300 inhibitor
C646 (Min et al., 2010) on cell survival and its correlation with
NCX1 expression in neurons subjected to either oxygen and glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation (OGD/RX) or PC
plus OGD/RX.

Materials and Methods
Materials
All restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased
from New England Biolabs or Promega. Luciferase reporter kits and
luciferase vectors were from Promega. Synthetic oligonucleotides
were from Primm. siRNAs against rat REST and HIF-1 were performed as already published (Formisano et al., 2013), whereas siRNAs
for Sp1 (siSp1) (SI02039044), Sp3 (siSp3) (SI05434387), Sp4 (siSp4)
(SI02039114), p300 (sip300) (SI02989693), and negative control
siCONTROL (siCTL) (1027280) were from QIAGEN. To knock down
rat HDAC1 and HDAC2,MISSION siRNAs from Sigma were used. The
sequences of siRNAs were as follows: for HDAC1 forward, 5⬘CUUUGAAUACUUUGGACCA(dT) (dT)-3⬘ and reverse, 5⬘-UGGU
CCAAAGUAUUCAAAG(dT) (dT)-3⬘; for HDAC2 forward, 5⬘-GAU
AUCGGGAAUUAUUAUU(dT) (dT)-3⬘ and reverse, 5⬘-AAUAAUA
AUUCCCGAUAUC(dT) (dT)-3⬘. Two sets of siRNAs were tested for
Sp1, Sp3, Sp4, p300, HDAC1, and HDAC2. The set that was more effective was chosen for the experiments (data not shown). The construct
used to silence NCX1 (siNCX1) and the mismatch sequence cloned in the
same vector (MS siNCX1) were used as previously described (Formisano
et al., 2008; Sirabella et al., 2009). The constructs pN3 and pN3-Sp1,
pN3-Sp3, and pN3-Sp4, carrying Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 cDNAs, were kindly
provided by Prof. G. Suske (Marburg, Germany). The constructs
pKCRH-NCX1 overexpressing canine NCX1 and the empty vector
( pKCRH) were kindly provided by Prof. Iwamoto (Fukuoka, Japan)
(Iwamoto et al., 2004). The HDAC inhibitor MS-275 (EPS002) and the
HAT-inhibitor C646 (SML002) were obtained from Sigma. Both were
dissolved in DMSO and diluted with cell culture medium. The final
concentration of DMSO was ⬍0.2%. All common reagents were of the
highest quality and were purchased from Sigma.

Cell cultures
Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were prepared as previously described (Guida et al., 2014). Primary cortical neurons were prepared
from 17-day-old Wistar rat embryos (Charles River) and used after 7 d.

J. Neurosci., May 13, 2015 • 35(19):7332–7348 • 7333

Cytosine arabinoside (2.5 ␮M) was added on the second day to reduce
glial contamination. The experiments on primary cortical neurons were
performed according to the experimental protocols approved by the Ethics Committee of “Federico II” University of Naples. Briefly; dissection
and dissociation were performed in Ca 2⫹/Mg 2⫹-free PBS containing
glucose (30 mM). Tissues were incubated with papain for 10 min at 37°C
and dissociated by trituration in Earl’s Balanced Salt Solution containing
DNase (0.16 U/ml), BSA (10 mg/ml), and ovomucoid (10 mg/ml). Neurons, plated in plastic Petri dishes (Falcon Becton-Dickinson) precoated
with poly-D-lysine (20 ␮g/ml), were grown in MEM/F12 containing glucose, deactivated FBS (5%), horse serum (5%), glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (50 U/ml), and streptomycin (50 ␮g/ml) (Invitrogen). For LDH
assay, cells were plated in 24 well plates at a density of 1 ⫻ 10 6 cells/well;
for luciferase assay, they were plated in 12 well plates at a density of 2 ⫻
10 6 cells/well; for qRT-PCR, they were plated in 60 mm well plates at a
density of 5 ⫻ 10 6 cells/well; for Western blot and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses, they were plated in 100 mm well plates at
a density of 15 ⫻ 10 6 cells/well.

Transfection with expression plasmids or small interfering RNA
(siRNA) and luciferase reporter assay, in cortical neurons
Cortical neurons were transfected with 50 nM of rat siCTL, siSp1, siSp3,
or siSp4 (for catalog numbers, see Materials). To overexpress pN3, Sp1,
Sp3, and Sp4, pKCRH and pKCRH-NCX1, neurons were transfected
with the above mentioned constructs in the following amounts: 0.5 ␮g
for 24 well plates, 1.3 ␮g for 12 well plates, 7 ␮g for 60 mm plates, and 15
␮g for 100 mm plates. Each transfection was performed at 7 DIV in OptiMEM together with Lipofectamine LTX (15338 –100, Invitrogen), as suggested by the producer. After a 2 h transfection, the medium was replaced
with a fresh one. To silence NCX1 with siNCX1 and MS-NCX1 (siCTL)
neurons were transfected as previously reported (Sirabella et al., 2009). In
particular, cells were transfected with 0.5 ␮g for 24 well plates (for LDH
assay) and 15 ␮g for 100 mm plates (for Western blot analysis) of the
above mentioned constructs. For luciferase assay experiments, cortical
neurons were transfected in 12 well plates. Cells were cotransfected with
2 ␮g of total DNA vectors; the reporters (560 ng each) were as follows: (1)
the pGL3-Basic ( pGL3) construct; (2) the pGL3-ncx1 (⫺340/151) contained a 350 bp fragment, named (short ncx1 promoter) (Valsecchi et
al., 2011); (3) the pGL3-ncx1/Sp1Bmut (GGCGGCGGGC); (4) the
pGL3-ncx1/Sp1Cmut (CGGGCGGGG); (5) the pGL3-ncx1/Sp1Dmut
(GGGAGGGG); (6) the pGL3-ncx1/Sp1Emut (GGCCCCGGC); and (7)
the pGL3-ncx1/Sp1CDEmut. This last reporter contained the simultaneous mutations of the Sp1 binding sites C, D, and E. Each italicized base
represents the mutated sequences in pGL3. Each ncx1/Sp1 site was mutated by GG ⬎TT substitution. Mutagenesis of the Sp1 sites in the promoter was performed using the QuikChangeSite-Directed Mutagenesis
Kit from Stratagene. To overexpress Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4, we used expression vectors and the empty vector pN3 (1.3 ␮g each). For RNA interference, a concentration of 50 nM of specific siCTL, siSp1, siSp3, or siSp4 was
used. Each transfection mix also contained 140 ng of the pRL-TK control
vector expressing the Renilla luciferase gene. After 2 h of incubation, the
medium was replaced with a fresh one and analyzed after 24 h with the
Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System kit (E1910) (Promega), as already reported (Formisano et al., 2013). SHSY-5Y cells (70% of confluence) were plated in 100 mm dishes and transiently cotransfected with 9
␮g of constructs carrying cDNA for Sp1 and Sp3 or with pN3 and with 6
␮g of (1) pGL3-ncx1, (2) pGL3-ncx1 Sp1/C mut, (3) pGL3-ncx1 Sp1/D
mut, (4) pGL3-ncx1 Sp1/E mut, and (5) pGL3-ncx1 Sp1/CDE mut using
lipofectamine in Opti-MEM, for 6 h. After this time, the medium was
changed to normal DMEM. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection
and lysed for Western blot analysis. Transfection efficiency was ⬵60%
for SH-SY5Y cells and ⬵40% for cortical neurons (data not shown).

Combined OGD and RX
OGD was performed in cortical neurons incubated in a medium previously saturated with 95% N2 and 5% CO2 for 20 min and containing the
following: 116 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgSO4, 26.2 mM NaHCO3,
1 mM NaH2PO4, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 0.01 mM glycine, and 0.001% w/v phenol
red; afterward, cells were placed in a hypoxic chamber for 3 h (Billups

7334 • J. Neurosci., May 13, 2015 • 35(19):7332–7348

Rothemberg) (37°C, 5% CO2, and 95% N2) (Sisalli et al., 2014). To
terminate OGD, neurons were removed from the hypoxic chamber and
placed in a normal medium for 24 h of RX. For PC, neurons were exposed
to 30 min of OGD, as described above, and then placed in a normal
medium. Twenty-four hours after PC, cultures were again subjected to
OGD for 3 h followed by 24 h of RX. Twenty-four hours after transfection
with pKCRH-NCX1, pKCRH, siNCX1, and MS siNCX1 cells were subjected to OGD/RX or PC⫹OGD/RX. MS-275 (1 ␮M) was added at the
end of OGD for 2 h, whereas C646 (20 ␮M) was added to the medium 30
min before PC and throughout the PC phase.

qRT-PCR analysis
First-strand cDNA and qRT-PCR were performed as previously described (Formisano et al., 2007). Using one-tenth of the cDNAs as a
template, qRT-PCR was performed in a 7500-fast real-time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems) by Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (cod 4385610;
Applied Biosystems). Samples were amplified simultaneously in triplicate in one assay as follows: heating 2 min at 50°C, denaturation 10 min
at 95°C, amplification and quantification 35 cycles of 15 s at 95°C; 1 min
at 60°C with a single fluorescence measurement. PCR data were collected
using ABI Prism 7000 SDS software (Applied Biosystems). After PCR,
products were electrophoretically separated on 1.5% agarose gels, and
the bands were visualized with ethidium bromide and documented using
a Gel Doc Imaging System (Bio-Rad). The data were normalized by
hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl-transferase as an internal control. Differences in mRNA content between groups were calculated as normalized
values by using 2 ⫺⌬⌬ct formula, and results were tested for significance
using the relative expression software tool (REST) (Formisano et al.,
2007). The oligonucleotide sequences for NCX1 (forward 1716 –1736
and reverse 3311–3292) (GenBank accession number NM_019268.3),
NCX3 (forward 3229 –3250 and reverse 1916 –1899) (GenBank accession
number NM_078620.1), and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl-transferase
(forward 444 – 467 and reverse 528 –507) (GenBank accession number
NM_078620.1) were performed as previously described (Pignataro et al.,
2011).

Western blotting
For Western blot analysis, cells (or tissues) were collected in ice-cold lysis
buffer (Formisano et al., 2013) containing anti-protease mixture (P8340
Sigma). For HDAC1, HDAC2, and acetyl-histone H3 expression, proteins (50 ␮g) were separated on 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels, whereas
for NCX1, NCX3, Sp1, Sp3, Sp4, REST, HIF-1 and p300 expression,
proteins (100 ␮g) were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Both
were transferred onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (GE
Healthcare). Membranes were first blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in
0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) (2 mM Tris-HCl and 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) for 2 h
at room temperature. Then, they were incubated overnight at 4°C in the
blocking buffer with the 1:1000 monoclonal antibodies against HDAC1
(5356) and HDAC2 (5113) (Cell-Signaling, EuroClone), p300 (sc-48343;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HIF-1 (MAB5382; Millipore), and 1:2000
␤-actin (A 4700; Sigma), either with the 1:1000 polyclonal antibodies
against REST (Iannotti et al., 2013) and acetyl-histone H3 (06 – 866)
(Millipore), NCX1 ( p 11–13; Swant), NCX3 (Boscia et al., 2012), Sp1
(sc-14027), Sp3 (sc-644), or Sp4 (sc-645) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Finally, after incubation with primary antibodies, membranes were first
washed with 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The immunoreactive bands were detected with the ECL reagent (GE Healthcare). The optical density of the
bands, normalized to ␤-actin, was determined by Chemi-Doc Imaging
System (Bio-Rad).

ChIP and re-ChiP assay
Brain tissue and cortical neurons were processed into chromatin according to previous protocols (Formisano et al., 2007) with some modifications. Cells and tissues were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, and
then reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of
0.125 M. Brain tissue and cells were washed three times in cold PBS
containing proteinase inhibitors and then collected in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 8.1, 1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, and anti-protease mixture. For cell and tissue samples, chromatin was fragmented by

sonication into 200 –500 bp fragments (6 rounds for cells and 15 rounds
for brain tissue of 10 s pulses at 50% of maximum potency) by a Bandelin
Sonopuls HD 2070 ultrasonic homogenizer (Bandelin). Equal amounts
of chromatin lysates (50 ␮g for cells and 70 ␮g for tissues) were incubated
overnight with 5 ␮g of antibody for Sp1 (sc-14027), Sp3 (sc-644), Sp4
(sc-645), p300 (sc-48343) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), REST (Iannotti et
al., 2013), acetyl-histone H4 (06 – 866), hypoxia inducible factor 1 ␣
(MAB5382) (Millipore), HDAC1 (5356), HDAC2 (5113) (CellSignaling, EuroClone), and RNA POL II (R1530; Sigma). Normal rabbit
or mouse IgG was used as negative control. After immunoprecipitation,
the DNA-histone complex was collected with 40 ␮l of salmon sperm
DNA/protein A or G-agarose beads (16 –157, 16 –201; Millipore). After
rotating for 2 h at 4°C on a spinning wheel, the beads were washed once
with each of the following buffers in the order shown: high-salt buffer
(0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.1, 500
mM NaCl); low-salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20
mM Tris HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mM NaCl); LiCl buffer (0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP40,
1% deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.1). They were then
washed twice at room temperature with TE buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.1,
and 1 mM EDTA). The precipitated fragments were eluted with a buffer
containing 1% SDS and 0.1 M NaHCO3. DNA was analyzed by qRT-PCR
using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (cod 4385610; Applied Biosystems).
In particular, DNA sequences/samples were heated for 2 min at 50°C and
denatured for 10 min at 95°C. Amplification and quantification,
achieved after 35 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, were followed by single fluorescence measurements for 1 min at 60°C. The binding activity was graphically represented as the percentage of the total input of chromatin, and
the results were analyzed using a previously described formula (Renthal et al., 2007). The following oligonucleotides were used for the
amplification of immunoprecipitated DNA: ncx1-Br (I) forward 5⬘CCGCTGGGGAAACCCCTGCC-3⬘ and reverse 5⬘-GCGCTGCAACTT
TTCTTTTGAACG-3⬘, ncx1-Br (II) forward 5⬘-GGGTGCAGAAGAG
AGCGCTGGC-3⬘ and reverse 5⬘- GCACAAAGCGCGGCGGCCCG-3⬘
and Neurotrophin-3 (NT3) (Ishimaru et al., 2007). For each amplification, melting curves and gel electrophoresis of the PCR product were
used to verify their identities. Samples were amplified simultaneously in
triplicate in one assay run. Re-ChIP experiments were performed to
detect the simultaneous presence of Sp1 with HIF-1 and p300 or of Sp3
with REST, HDAC1, and HDAC2. Beads from the first ChIP analysis
with anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 were incubated with an equal volume of 10
nM dithiothreitol at 37°C for 30 min and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1
min to elute DNA-bound proteins. Elution was repeated twice. The final
elute was diluted 1:10 in lysis buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture and reimmunoprecipitated with anti-REST, anti-HIF-1, antiHDAC1, anti-HDAC2, anti-p300 antibodies or IgG. ChIP and input
DNA were analyzed with PCR: denaturation for 10 min at 95°C, 35 cycles
of 30 s at 95°C; for 1 min at 60°C; for 1 min at 72°C. PCR products were
then electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium
bromide. For ChIP and Re-ChIP experiments, we used ncx1-Br (II)
primers because the amplified sequence of ncx1-Br contains the binding
sites for REST (⫺18/1) (Formisano et al., 2013), HIF-1 (⫺331/⫺327 and
⫺164/⫺160) (Valsecchi et al., 2011), Sp1, and Sp3.

Transient-transfection ChIP assay
Cell culture and ChIP from SHSY-5Y cells was performed as described
above. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested by cross-linking
with 1% formaldehyde, and ChIP was performed with antibodies for
Sp1, Sp3, and IgG as negative control (data not shown). The input and
the precipitated DNA was amplified using ncx1-Br forward (II) 5⬘GGGTGCAGAAGAGAGCGCTGGC-3⬘ and a LucNrev primer 5⬘- CCTTATGCAGTTGCTCTCC ⫺3.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
EMSA experiments were performed as previously described (Valsecchi et
al., 2011). In particular, 5 ␮g of nuclear extracts was incubated with
double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (PRIMM) labeled with cy5 at the
5⬘ termini of both strands. Sense strand sequences were as follows: Cy5Sp1 consensus sequence: 5⬘-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3⬘
(Ko et al., 1998; Ryu et al., 2003); ncx1-Sp1B: 5⬘-AGGAGGCG-

Transient focal ischemia and ischemic preconditioning. Transient focal ischemia was induced
by suture occlusion of middle cerebral artery
(MCA) in male rats with 1.5% sevoflurane, 70%
N2O, and 28.5% O2 (Valsecchi et al., 2011)
Achievement of ischemia was confirmed by
monitoring regional cerebral blood flow through
laser Doppler (PF5001; Perimed). Animals not
showing cerebral blood flow reduction of at least
70%, as well as those dying after ischemia induction, were excluded from the study. Rats were divided into four experimental groups: (1) shamoperated rats (CTL); (2) preconditioned rats
(PC); (3) ischemic rats, subjected to tMCAO; and
(4) preconditioned ischemic rats (PC⫹tMCAO).
The sham-operated animals underwent the same
experimental conditions, except that the filament
was not introduced; in the ischemic group, the
MCA was occluded for 100 min; in the preconditioned ischemic group, rats were subjected to 30
min of tMCAO 72 h before 100 min of tMCAO.
The rat siRNAs used in ischemic and preconditioned ischemic rats were intracerebroventricularly administered (1 ␮l) at concentrations of 20

Quantification of neuronal injury
Neuronal injury was assessed by measurement of LDH efflux into the
medium after OGD/RX or PC⫹OGD/RX. In neuronal cultures, LDH
activity is correlated with the number of damaged cells in the medium
(Koh and Choi, 1987). Cytosolic levels of LDH in the extracellular medium
were measured with the LDH Cytotoxicity Kit (1000882 Cayman, DBA).
Briefly, after induction of OGD/RX or PC⫹OGD/RX, the medium was
removed and sampled for LDH content by measuring absorbance at 490
nm using a spectrophotometer BioPhotometer (Eppendorf). Cell lysate,
prepared 1% Triton X-100, was used as a positive control and its value
was considered 100%.

In vivo studies
Experimental groups. Male Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River) weighing
250 –300 g were housed under diurnal lighting conditions (12 h darkness/light). Experiments were performed according to the international
guidelines for care and use of experimental animals of the European
Community Council directive (86/609/EEC). All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of “Federico II” University of Naples, IT.

promoter sequence
Because Sp1 and Sp3 both recognize the GC-rich sequences
known as GC boxes (Isomura et al., 2005), we searched for Sp1
sequences at the level of the ncx1-Br promoter (GenBank accession no. U95138) and subjected the ncx1-Br sequence to a computational prediction of transcriptional factors using the
database TF SEARCH, version 1.3 (Cassimere et al., 2009). As
shown in Fig. 1a, five binding sites, named Sp1A–E, were identified within the ncx1-Br sequence at ⫺439/⫺431, ⫺179/⫺170,
⫺129/⫺121, ⫺111/⫺104, and ⫺67/⫺58 from the transcriptional start site. All these sequences were characterized by the TF
search threshold score, a parameter of sequence identity, ⬎85.0.
To prove a direct association of Sp transcription factors with the
ncx1-Br promoter in the nuclear environment, we performed
ChIP assays on extracts from cortical neurons that basally express
Sp1, Sp3 (Ryu et al., 2003), and Sp4 (Ishimaru et al., 2007). To
this aim, we divided ncx1-Br into two different fragments,
termed ncx1-Br (I) (⫺702/⫺387) and ncx1-Br (II) (⫺366/58),
and experiments were performed using specific primers recog-

nizing these two parts of the ncx1-Br promoter. As shown in Fig.
1b, when chromatin was precipitated with Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4
antibodies, ncx1-Br (II), but not ncx1-Br (I), was amplified with
Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies, compared with control IgG. Importantly, no signal was detected with the Sp4 antibody in the
ncx1-Br (I) and ncx1-Br (II) fragments (Fig. 1b),whereas it was
able to bind its known target gene neurotrophin-3 (NT3) (Ishimaru et al., 2007) in cortical neurons (Fig. 1c). This result suggests that Sp4 does not bind to the ncx1-Br promoter and that
only the ncx1-Br (II) sequence is important for Sp1 and Sp3
binding in cortical neurons.
Sp1 and Sp3 have an opposite effect on ncx1 gene promoter
activity, mRNA, and protein expression
To evaluate the effect of Sp transcription factors on the ncx1 gene
promoter activity (evaluated by luciferase assay), as well as
mRNA and protein expression levels, neurons were silenced by
specific siRNAs, namely, siSp1, siSp3, and siSp4. These were able
to decrease Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 protein expression by 68%, 63%,
and 70%, respectively (Fig. 2a– c). In particular, for luciferase
experiments, we used a pGL3 construct containing the 5⬘flanking region upstream of the brain ncx1 transcriptional start
site (⫹1), named short ncx1 promoter (pGL3-ncx1), already used
in a previous study (Valsecchi et al., 2011). This construct contained the native Sp1 consensus sequences from B to E, which are
present in the sequence of ncx1-Br (II) fragment. As shown in
Figure 3a– c, Sp1 silencing reduced ncx1 gene promoter activity,
mRNA levels (24 h after the treatment), and protein expression
(48 h after treatment) by 45%, 48%, and 37%, respectively. By

contrast, Sp3 silencing increased ncx1 gene promoter activity,
mRNA levels (24 h after treatment), and protein expression (48 h
after the treatment) by 68%, 65%, and 53%, respectively. The
concomitant silencing of Sp1 and Sp3 or the knockdown of Sp4
did not affect the ncx1 gene promoter, mRNA levels, or protein
expression, compared with cells transfected with siCTL. To further confirm the role of Sp transcription factors in modulating
NCX1 expression, cortical neurons were transfected with constructs overexpressing Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 (Fig. 2d–f ). Neurons
overexpressing Sp1 showed an increase in ncx1 gene promoter
activity, mRNA levels (24 h after the treatment), and protein
expression (48 h after the treatment) by 64%, 77%, and 61%,
respectively. By contrast, Sp3 overexpression decreased ncx1
gene promoter activity, mRNA levels (24 h after the treatment),
and protein expression (48 h after the treatment) by 76%, 58%,
and 42%, respectively. The concomitant overexpression of
Sp1 and Sp3 or Sp4 transfection alone did not affect the ncx1 gene
promoter, mRNA levels, or protein expression, compared with
control (Fig. 3d–f ). To identify the functional Sp1 sequences
within the ncx1 promoter, the Sp1 binding sites B-E were mutated in the pGL3-ncx1 construct by site-directed mutagenesis.
Thus, four different luciferase reporter constructs (pGL3-ncx1/
Sp1 B mut, pGL3-ncx1/Sp1 C mut, pGL3-ncx1/Sp1 D mut, and
pGL3-ncx1/Sp1 E mut; Fig. 4a) were generated and cotransfected
into cortical neurons with an expression plasmid of Sp1 or Sp3
(Fig. 4b,c). Interestingly, the cells transfected with the three constructs pGL3-ncx1/Sp1C–E mut significantly reduced the increase of luciferase activity induced by Sp1 overexpression by
30% (Fig. 4b). By contrast, transfection of the three constructs in

cells overexpressing Sp3 significantly reverted by 35% Sp3decreased ncx1 luciferase activity (Fig. 4c). Under both experimental conditions, mutation of Sp1 sequence B (pGL3-ncx1/Sp1
B mut) had no effect on ncx1 transcriptional activity (Fig. 4b,c).
Interestingly, in neurons overexpressing Sp1 or Sp3, transfection
of pGL3-ncx1/Sp1 CDE construct containing mutations of all
three Sp1 sites on ncx1-Br sequence, further reduced ncx1
promoter-luciferase activity by 65% or increased it by 85%, respectively, compared with pGL3-ncx1 alone (Fig. 4b,c). Because
the ncx1-Br (II) fragment contains four (Sp1B–E) of the five
putative Sp1 binding elements identified, EMSA experiments
were performed to determine which of these Sp1 sites were involved in the binding with Sp1 and Sp3 proteins. These experiments were conducted in SH-SY5Y cell lines that have been
already used to study the binding of Sp transcription factors on
specific gene promoter sequence (Formisano et al., 2015a).
Therefore, nuclear extracts from SH-SY5Y were incubated with a
5⬘-Cy5 fluorescent double-stranded oligonucleotide (Cy5-Sp1
consensus sequence), which specifically binds Sp1 and Sp3 as
previously reported (Ko et al., 1998; Ryu et al., 2003). As shown in
Figure 4d, lane 2 protein binding to the Cy5-Sp1 consensus sequence oligonucleotide produced two major closely migrating
complexes (as indicated by the arrowheads). Interestingly, only
the unlabeled oligonucleotides of ncx1/Sp1C–E sites competed
for binding of both protein complexes (Fig. 4d, lanes 7, 8, 11, 12,
15, and 16); however, this competition did not occur in the presence of excess mutated probes (Fig. 4d, lanes 9, 10, 13, 14, 17, and
18). Furthermore, as shown in Figure 4d (lanes 3– 6), the excess of

ncx1/Sp1 B probes wild-type partially competed with Cy5-Sp1
consensus sequence, whereas the mutated were not able to modify the intensity of the doublet bands protein/DNA complexes.
Moreover, the addition of antibodies against Sp1 and Sp3 was
able to decrease the appearance of the upper and lower band of
the formed complexes, respectively (Fig. 4d, lanes 19 and 20).
Furthermore, EMSA experiments performed with fluorescent
probes containing ncx1/Sp1C or ncx1/Sp1D or ncx1/Sp1E sequences showed the formation of specific DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 4e– g, lanes 1), that completely diminished in the
presence of an excess of unlabeled probes (Fig. 4e– g, lanes 2), but
not in the presence of an excess of mutated probes (Fig. 4e– g,
lanes 3). This suggests that mutations of ncx1-Sp1C–E sites at
these positions alter binding of proteins to the ncx1-Br promoter
sequence. Interestingly, incubation of the nuclear extract with an
anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 decreased the intensity of the upper and
lower band for ncx1-Sp1 C (Fig. 4e, lanes 4 and 5), ncx1-Sp1D
(Fig. 4f, lanes 4 and 5), and ncx1-Sp1E sites (Fig. 4g, lanes 4 and
5), indicating that the binding of Sp1 and Sp3, detected by the
upper and lower band, was inhibited by the antibodies. Notably,
experiments with antibody against Sp4 were not able to modify
both bands of the complex formed between nuclear extracts and
the probes (Fig. 4c– e, lane 7). To further confirm that Sp1 and
Sp3 bind the ncx1-Sp1C–E sequences as suggested by EMSA,
SHSY-5Y cells were cotransfected with plasmid containing the
wild-type ncx1-Br promoter sequence (pGL3-ncx1) or the luciferase reporter constructs: pGL3-ncx1/Sp1 C mut, pGL3-ncx1/
Sp1 D mut, pGL3-ncx1/Sp1 E mut, and pGL3-ncx1/Sp1 CDE

able to increase Sp1 and Sp3 protein expression by almost 50%,
respectively (data not shown). Then, transfected cells were subjected to ChIP assay with Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies. As shown in
Figure 4h, i, exogenous wild-type chromatin was immunoprecipitated by the Sp1 and Sp3 and amplified using as forward
primer an oligonucleotide recognized the ncx1-Br sequence
[ncx1-Br forward (II)] and as reverse primer an oligonucleotide
recognized specifically the luciferase gene of pGL3 construct
(LucNrev). In particular, overexpression of Sp1 or Sp3 increased
their binding on ncx1 exogenous promoter sequence, compared
with cells transfected with the empty vector pN3. By contrast,
PCR product containing the mutated ncx1-Sp1C–E sequences
was reduced, whereas transfection of a construct containing
ncx1-Sp1C–E sites jointly mutated completely abolished Sp1 and

struct. Thus, Sp1 and Sp3 are efficiently recruited to the ncx1-br
promoter sequence by binding ncx1-Sp1C–E sites. Together,
these results demonstrate that Sp1 and Sp3 interact with the
ncx1-Br promoter within three specific sequences, thereby increasing or decreasing its expression, respectively.
REST/Sp3 and HIF-1/Sp1 complexes colocalize on ncx1 brain
promoter after tMCAO and PCⴙtMCAO, respectively
The three Sp1 sequences we identified on the ncx1-Br promoter
are located near the binding sites of both the ncx1 transcriptional
repressor REST and the ncx1 transcriptional activator HIF-1.
Whereas the former is responsible for NCX1 reduction in cerebral ischemia (tMCAO) (Formisano et al., 2013), the latter is
responsible for NCX1 increase after ischemic preconditioning
plus tMCAO (PC⫹tMCAO) (Valsecchi et al., 2011). The temporoparietal brain cortex has been chosen as a region of interest
because after tMCAO ischemic damage it involves both striatum
and cortex, which represent the brain areas irrigated by MCA. In
particular, the temporoparietal cortex is a unique region because
after tMCAO it includes the ischemic core, the area irreversibly
damaged, and the ischemic penumbra, the area that can be still
rescued from cell death (Barone et al., 1998; Pignataro et al.,
2012) and intact tissue. In addition, the same cortical area is
spared by the ischemic damage when a preconditioning stimulus
is applied. Therefore, the processes triggered by preconditioning
and able to modify the extent of ischemic brain lesion are usually
evaluated in this area. Interestingly, Western blot analysis, performed in the ipsilesional–temporoparietal cortex of rats at 24 h
after PC alone, tMCAO, or PC⫹tMCAO revealed that PC alone
did not significantly modify the expression of NCX1, REST,
HIF-1, Sp1, or Sp3 compared with CTL (Fig. 5a– e). On the con-

of the precleared chromatin used in each ChIP reaction. The figure is representative of two independent experiments.

trary, tMCAO reduced NCX1 by 44% while simultaneously increasing HIF-1 by 75%, REST by 180%, and Sp3 by 100%.
However, it did not affect Sp1 (Fig. 5d). Finally, PC⫹tMCAO
remarkably increased NCX1 by 140%, HIF-1 by 450%, and Sp1
by 180% compared with CTL, whereas it completely blocked
tMCAO-induced REST and Sp3 increase, compared with
tMCAO values (Fig. 5a– e). In all the above experimental conditions, Sp4 protein expression was not affected (Fig. 5f ). To evaluate the possible interaction between REST and Sp3 and between
HIF-1 and Sp1, their binding activity to the ncx1-Br sequence was
measured in rats subjected to tMCAO and PC⫹tMCAO. Inter-

estingly, in rats subjected to cerebral ischemia, REST and Sp3
binding, but not HIF-1 and Sp1, increased, compared with CTL
(Fig. 6a– d). On the contrary, whereas HIF-1 and Sp1 binding to
the ncx1-Br sequence increased after PC⫹tMCAO, REST and
Sp3 did not (Fig. 6a– d). We further conducted re-ChIP assay to
test whether the transcriptional repressors REST and Sp3 or the
transcriptional activators HIF-1 and Sp1 all colocalized on the
ncx1 Br sequence during tMCAO and PC⫹tMCAO, respectively.
Re-ChIP assay revealed that Sp3, REST, HDAC1, and HDAC2

after PC⫹tMCAO, respectively. These results suggest that Sp3
REST, HDAC1, and HDAC2, and Sp1, HIF-1, and p300 form two
functional complexes on the ncx1-Br sequence during tMCAO
and PC⫹tMCAO, respectively.
Epigenetic remodeling of the ncx1-Br promoter by HDAC1
and HDAC2 after tMCAO and by p300 after PCⴙtMCAO
The transcription factors REST, HIF-1, Sp1, and Sp3 regulate
their target genes by epigenetic modifications, such as acetylation
(Won et al., 2002; Formisano et al., 2007; Azahri et al., 2012; Noh
et al., 2012; Pawlus and Hu, 2013). Thus, by performing ChIP
assay, we evaluated the following: (1) the modification of the
acetylated histone protein H3; (2) the binding of HDAC1,
HDAC2, and histone acetyltransferase p300; and (3) the binding
of RNA polymerase II (RNA-Pol II) on ncx1-Br promoter sequence in the ipsilesional–temporoparietal cortex of rats subjected to PC, tMCAO, and PC⫹tMCAO and compared it with
CTL. PC alone did not significantly modify the amount of the
ncx1 promoter associated with acetylated H3, RNA-Pol II,
HDAC1, HDAC2, and p300 (Fig. 7a– e).
On the other hand, our results showed that tMCAO reduced
the amount of the ncx1 promoter associated with acetylated H3
and RNA-Pol II (Fig. 7a,b). Concomitantly, the same experimental condition increased the binding activity of HDAC1 and
HDAC2 on the ncx1 gene promoter (Fig. 7c,d), compared with
CTL. After tMCAO, p300 binding on the ncx1-Br promoter was

absent (Fig. 7e). Interestingly, HDAC1 and HDAC2 did not bind
to the ncx1-Br promoter in animals subjected to PC⫹tMCAO
(Fig. 7c,d). Contrarily, our results showed that PC⫹tMCAO increased not only the amount of ncx1-Br associated with acetylated H3, but also the binding activity of RNA-Pol II and p300 to
the ncx1-Br promoter, compared with CTL (Fig. 7a,b,e). To better understand the role of REST, Sp3, HDAC1, and HDAC2 in
tMCAO-induced NCX1 reduction, we evaluated the acetylation
status of the ncx1-Br promoter, the ncx1 gene level, and protein
expression, after intracerebroventricular injection of siSp3,
siREST, alone or in combination, and siHDAC1 and siHDAC2 in
combination. In particular, siSp3, siHDAC1, and siHDAC2 were
able to reduce protein expression by 80%, 75%, and 81%, respectively, whereas expression for siREST was already published
(Formisano et al., 2013) (Fig. 8a– c). As shown in Figure 9a– c,

gene and protein reduction were reverted when all the proteins
were silenced, compared with CTL. Furthermore, tMCAOinduced Sp3 and REST binding to ncx1-Br sequence was reverted
when Sp3 and REST were silenced alone or in combination, compared with siCTL (Fig. 9d). Interestingly, in the same experimental conditions, tMCAO-induced ncx3 gene and protein decrease
was not reverted by siSp3, siREST, alone or in combination, and
by double silencing for HDAC1 and HDAC2, compared with the
CTL (Fig. 10a,b). Furthermore, we studied the role of HIF-1, Sp1,
and p300 in the PC⫹tMCAO-induced NCX1 increase after in-

tracerebroventricular injection of siSp1,
siHIF-1, alone or in combination, and
sip300. In particular, siSp1 and sip300
were able to reduce protein expression by
80% and 85% (Fig. 8d,e), respectively,
whereas the decrease of protein expression obtained by siHIF-1 was already published (Valsecchi et al., 2011). Our results
showed that hyperacetylation of histone
H3 on the ncx1-Br promoter sequence,
induced by PC⫹tMCAO, was reverted
when we administered siSp1 (Fig. 9e),
siHIF-1, alone or in combination, and
sip300 (Fig. 9e), compared with the CTL
(Fig. 9e). Likewise, the ncx1 gene and protein increase, induced by PC⫹tMCAO,
was also reverted (Fig. 9f,g). In addition,
PC⫹tMCAO-induced Sp1 and HIF-1
binding to ncx1-Br sequence was reverted
when Sp1 and HIF-1 were silenced alone
or in combination, compared with siCTL
(Fig. 9h). Importantly, in the same experimental conditions, PC⫹tMCAO-induced
ncx3 gene and protein increase was not reverted by silencing the above mentioned
transcriptional factors, compared with the
CTL (Fig. 10c,d).

Class I HDAC inhibitor MS-275 reduces neuronal cell death
by increasing NCX1 expression during OGD/RX
Considering that HDAC1 and HDAC2 belong to Class I histone
deacetylases (Chuang et al., 2009), we evaluated the effect of the
Class I HDAC inhibitor MS-275 (1 ␮M) in cortical neurons exposed to OGD/RX (Lanzillotta et al., 2013; Formisano et al.,
2015b). First, we validated the specificity of MS-275 to inhibit
Class I HDAC by measuring the levels of the acetylated forms of
histone H3 (indicating the activity of Class I) (Simonini et al.,
2006; Galmozzi et al., 2013). Results showed that MS-275 increased histone H3 acetylation (Fig. 11a). In addition, MS-275
exerted a remarkable neuroprotective effect by preventing cell
death during OGD/RX, an effect that was though counteracted by
siNCX1. Interestingly, siNCX1 alone exacerbated the neuronal
death induced by OGD/RX (Fig. 11b).
To identify the role of NCX1 in MS-275-induced neuroprotection, Western blot analysis was performed for NCX1 under the
same experimental conditions. Furthermore, exposure of cortical
neurons to OGD/RX⫹MS-275 induced an increase in NCX1
protein expression compared with the OGD/RX⫹vehicle (Fig.
11c). As expected, the MS-275-induced NCX1 increase was counteracted by siNCX1 (Fig. 11c).
Hystone acetyl transferase p300 inhibitor C646 reverts PCinduced neuroprotection by counteracting NCX1 increase
We investigated whether PC could exert a neuroprotective effect
in cortical neurons exposed to OGD/RX by increasing p300 and
NCX1 expression. The specificity of C646 to inhibit hystone
acetyl transferase p300 was validated by measuring the levels of
the acetylated form of histone H3 (Federman et al., 2013). Results
showed that C646 decreased histone H3 acetylation (Fig. 11d). In
particular, in neurons exposed to PC⫹OGD/RX, the p300 inhibitor C646 (20 ␮M) (Min et al., 2010), increased cell death compared with vehicle. Interestingly, NCX1 overexpression was able
to counteract C646-induced neuronal death, compared with vec-

tor (Fig. 11e). In addition, C646 prevented the increase in NCX1
in cortical neurons exposed to PC⫹OGD/RX, an effect that was
counteracted by NCX1 overexpression (Fig. 11f ).

Discussion
This study has shown, for the first time, that NCX1 is epigenetically downregulated in brain ischemia by the REST/Sp3 complex
and upregulated in brain ischemic preconditioning by the HIF1/Sp1 complex. Particularly, our results suggest that these proteins form two functional complexes on the ncx1-Br sequence in
brain ischemia and in brain ischemic preconditioning. We
showed that REST/Sp3-induced NCX1 downregulation after tMCAO 24 h and HIF-1/Sp1-induced NCX1 upregulation after
PC⫹tMCAO 24 h are associated with these transcriptional factors expression. Particularly, 24 h after tMCAO and 24 h after
PC⫹tMCAO was the first time points in which Sp3 (data not
shown) and REST (Formisano et al., 2013) or HIF-1 (Valsecchi et
al., 2011) and Sp1 (data not shown), respectively, were increased.
Indeed, intracerebroventricular injections of siREST and siSp3,
alone or in combination, in tMCAO, and of siHIF-1 and siSp1,
alone or in combination, in PC⫹tMCAO completely reverted the
decreases and the increases, respectively, in NCX1 mRNA and
protein levels. Previous studies have proposed that a crosstalk
between Sp1, Sp3, and REST regulates the expression of some
genes. For instance, hypoxia-induced expression of the regulation in development and DNA damage response (Redd1) gene is
mediated by the coactivation of Sp1 and HIF-1 (Jin et al., 2007).
Interestingly, in our study, we report, for the first time, that a
crosstalk between Sp1, Sp3, and REST specifically regulates ncx1
expression. In particular, whereas Sp1 activates the expression of
REST target genes (Plaisance et al., 2005), Sp3 interacts with
REST by binding to the GC box, thereby repressing the expression of mu opioid receptor (Kim et al., 2006). Moreover, within
the rat ncx1-Br, we discovered five Sp1 motifs (Sp1A–E) located
at ⫺439, ⫺179, ⫺129, ⫺111, and ⫺67 from the transcriptional

start site, and indentified them as possible molecular determinants involved in Sp1 isoform-induced ncx1 regulation. Furthermore, we found that, among the Sp family of transcription
factors, Sp1 and Sp3, but not Sp4, bind to ncx1-Br in a very
selective manner, as revealed by ChIP analysis. These results are

in accordance with other studies showing that not all the genes
containing GC boxes in their promoter are regulated by all Sp1
transcription factor isoforms (Lerner et al., 2002) and that some
genes are target of Sp1 and Sp3, but not of Sp4 (Nguyen-Huynh
and Schaffer, 1998; Khalil et al., 2008). Importantly, even though

Sp4 in mammals is predominantly expressed in tissues of neuronal origin (Lerner et al., 2005), regulating the developmental patterning of dendrites (Ramos et al., 2007), and has been linked to
schizophrenia (Pinacho et al., 2011), our experiments show that
Sp4 does not bind the ncx1-Br promoter sequence in cortical
neurons. Conversely, our results on the regulation of NCX1 by
Sp1 and Sp3 are in line with data showing that Sp1 and Sp3
regulate the transcription of target genes by binding to identical
cognate DNA elements with similar affinities (Hagen et al., 1992).
Indeed, transfection of specific siRNAs for Sp1 and Sp3 in cortical
neurons produced a decrease or an increase, respectively, in the
ncx1 promoter activity, mRNA levels, and protein expression.
These results demonstrate that Sp1 is an activator, whereas Sp3 is
a repressor of ncx1 transcription, a mechanism also reported for
other Sp1 target genes (Stains et al., 2003). Notably, in the present
paper, we identified three Sp1 binding sites (C–E) on ncx1-Br,
which showed the highest promoter activity, and found that mutations at the level of the Sp1C–E sites in neurons overexpressing
Sp1 and Sp3 could significantly reduce or increase, respectively,
the activity of ncx1 brain promoter, whereas Sp1B had no effect.
As regard the Sp1-B site, because the binding to this putative Sp1
site of nuclear factors from SHSY-5Y cells is partially competed
by the Cy5-Sp1 consensus sequence, we cannot exclude the possibility that other additional transcription factors recognizing GC
elements different from Sp1 family (Carrasco-Serrano et al.,
1998), such as the Early growth response protein 1 (Mora-López
et al., 2008), may participate to bind such complexes. Accordingly, luciferase experiments show that Sp1 and Sp3 factors are

not involved in the regulation of ncx1-Br promoter activity
through the Sp1-B site. Importantly, as shown by ChIP, this effect
was associated with an increase of Sp1 or of Sp3 binding on
Sp1C–E sites, which was completely abolished when the three
sequences were jointly mutated. Collectively, these results show
that three of the five putative Sp1 elements present on the
ncx1-Br sequence modulate the promoter activity of the ncx1
gene. Indeed, studies report that global transcriptional repression
upon ischemia is similarly reflected by a decrease in histone acetylation and that HDAC inhibition reduces ischemia-induced
alterations in HDAC expression, thereby determining neuroprotection (Abel and Zukin, 2008; Noh et al., 2012). Consistently,
data emerging from our study seem to suggest that both REST
during ischemia and HIF-1 during preconditioning interfere
with NCX1 gene expression through the participation of
HDAC1, HDAC2, and p300. In particular, our ChIP analyses
reveal that in brain ischemia REST and Sp3, together with the
corepressors HDAC1 and HDAC2, are recruited to ncx1-Br, thus
decreasing H3 acetylation, RNA-Pol II binding, and determining
a reduction in ncx1 mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly,
PC⫹tMCAO induces an increase in the abundance of ncx1-Br
associated with acetylated H3, along with increases in RNA-Pol
II, HIF-1, and p300 binding, thus determining an increase in
NCX1 mRNA levels and protein expression. Furthermore ReChIP experiments using Sp3 as first antibody and REST, HDAC1,
or HDAC2 as second antibody, or Sp1 as first antibody and HIF-1
or p300 as second antibody, further confirm that REST/Sp3/
HDAC1/HDAC2 and HIF-1/Sp1/p300 are present on ncx1-Br

sequence during tMCAO or PC⫹tMCAO, respectively. All these
data suggest that the REST/Sp3/HDAC1/HDAC2 complex decreases NCX1 expression during brain ischemia, whereas the
HIF-1/Sp1/p300 complex increases its expression during preconditioning. Notably, this regulation regards exclusively NCX1 and
not NCX3, another NCX isoform involved in brain ischemia and
ischemic brain preconditioning (Pignataro et al., 2012). Indeed,
changes in NCX3 mRNA and protein expression were not associated with either the REST/Sp3/HDAC1/HDAC2 complex in
tMCAO or the PC⫹tMCAO complex in ischemic brain preconditioning. Furthermore, the rat Sp1C–E, repressor element 1
(RE-1) and hypoxia-responsive element-1 (HRE-1) sequences
have 60%, 75%, 70%, 85%, and 85% of similarity with human
sequences, respectively. Fascinatingly, the positions of all the
above mentioned sequences on ncx1 human and rat promoters
are conserved. This high percentage of homology between rat and
human ncx1 brain promoter sequences indicates the relevance of
our results obtained in animal models of stroke to human brain

ischemia. On the other hand, as REST (Calderone et al., 2003;
Formisano et al., 2007; Ooi and Wood, 2007; Yeo et al., 2009),
Sp1 and Sp3 (Bigger et al., 1997; Lee et al., 2006), and HIF-1
(Matrone et al., 2004) regulate also other genes, on the basis of
our results, it cannot rule out that other proteins in coordination
with NCX1 can participate in the physiopathology of stroke.
About the mechanism(s) that trigger(s) the increase of REST and
Sp3 by tMCAO and of HIF-1 and Sp1 in PC⫹tMCAO, it has been
reported that the increasing of REST expression in stroke has
been associated with a decrease of casein kinase 1 (CK1) activation,
which reduces REST phosphorylation blocking its proteasomal degradation (Kaneko et al., 2014), whereas the transcriptional repressor
Sp3 is associated with CK2-phosphorylated histone deacetylase 2
(Sun et al., 2002), it could be suggested a role of CK1 to increase
Sp3 and REST protein expression and their consequent binding
on ncx1-Br promoter sequence. On the other hand, it has been
found in PC⫹tMCAO that p-AKT inhibition prevented the upregulation of NCX1 (Pignataro et al., 2012) and that Sp1 and

7346 • J. Neurosci., May 13, 2015 • 35(19):7332–7348

HIF-1 are both targets of AKT (Jiang et al., 2001; Tan and Khachigian, 2009); therefore, it could be hypothesized that activation of
this protein kinase during PC⫹tMCAO determines an increase of
Sp1 and HIF-1 binding on ncx1-Br promoter sequence. Furthermore, we investigated the role of HDAC1, HDAC2, and p300 in
NCX1-induced neuroprotection in neurons subjected to either
OGD/RX or PC⫹OGD/RX. We observed that neuroprotection
induced by the HDAC1 and HDAC2 inhibitor MS-275 was completely abolished during OGD/RX by silencing NCX1, a finding
that further supports the tight relationship between HDAC1,
HDAC2, and NCX1 in the pathophysiological processes leading
to stroke. These results are in accordance with Noh et al. (2012),
showing that HDAC1 and HDAC2 are recruited to the AMPA
receptor subunit GluA2 promoter sequence and that injection
of the pan-HDAC inhibitor thrichostatin A after an ischemic
episode ameliorates neuronal injury. In addition, p300 inhibitor C646-induced cell death was completely reverted in
PC⫹OGD/RX by NCX1 overexpression, thus suggesting a
close relationship between the histone acetyltransferase p300
and NCX1 in ischemic preconditioning. In summary, we have
shown that, under brain ischemia and brain ischemic preconditioning, NCX1 expression is epigenetically modulated, respectively, by two functional protein complexes: REST/Sp3/
HDAC1/HDAC2 and HIF-1/Sp1/p300. In particular, whereas
the former downregulates NCX1 expression during brain
ischemia, the latter upregulates it during preconditioning.
Notably, the development of drugs that epigenetically regulate
NCX1 by preventing its downregulation in stroke might be a
new pharmacological avenue to ameliorate neuronal damage
during brain ischemia.
