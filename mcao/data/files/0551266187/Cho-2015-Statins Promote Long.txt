Inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase (statins), widely used to lower cholesterol in coronary heart and vascular disease, are effective
drugs in reducing the risk of stroke and improving its outcome in the long term. After ischemic stroke, cardiac autonomic
dysfunction and psychological problems are common complications related to deficits in the noradrenergic (NA) system. This
study investigated the effects of statins on the recovery of NA neuron circuitry and its function after transient focal cerebral
ischemia (tFCI). Using the wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) transgene technique combined with the recombinant adenoviral vector
system, NA-specific neuronal pathways were labeled, and were identified in the locus coeruleus (LC), where NA neurons originate.
NA circuitry in the atorvastatin-treated group recovered faster than in the vehicle-treated group. The damaged NA circuitry was
partly reorganized with the gradual recovery of autonomic dysfunction and neurobehavioral deficit. Newly proliferated cells might
contribute to reorganizing NA neurons and lead anatomic and functional recovery of NA neurons. Statins may be implicated to
play facilitating roles in the recovery of the NA neuron and its function.

1. Introduction
Therapeutic aims after CNS injury are to prevent second complications in acute stage and to enhance functional recovery
of the damaged brain in chronic stage. The neurological secondary implications contain urinary disorders, depression,
or dementia [1]. Cardiac complications including sudden
death are also frequent during recovery phase after stroke [2].
Response to increased serum cardiac enzyme and high blood
pressure, plasma noradrenaline (NA) levels are often elevated
[3, 4]. Dysfunction of the noradrenergic system is a frequent feature in various neurodegenerative disorders such as
Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and Parkinson‚Äôs disease, as well as in acute
ischemic stroke. At stroke onset, ischemic sites and lesion
size may be related to different characteristics of autonomic
dysfunction [5]. Malfunction in the noradrenergic system is
also implicated in many psychiatric disorders manifesting
abnormal social behavior, attention deficit, hyperactivity,
anxiety, and depression. Brain ischemia induces pathological
synaptic plasticity caused by delayed neuronal death and
induces physiological plasticity which leads to structural

reorganization resulting in functional recovery [6, 7]. NA has
been reported to regulate neural stem cell and also act as
a positive modulator for hippocampal neurogenesis in vitro
and in vivo [8]. In adult mice, alteration of noradrenergic
system could affect neurogenesis and consequently improve
the performing ability to perceptual learning task [9].
Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A
(HMG-CoA) reductase are widely used for secondary stroke
prevention [10]. Statin has been reported to have numerous
effects on neuron survival, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis
as well as lipid-lowering activity [11, 12]. Along with these
therapeutic usage, it was been mainly investigated whether
statin treatment, HMG-CoA reductase inhibition, could
promote neurological recovery, perilesional, and contralesional neuronal plasticity in the post-acute stroke phase
promotes [13]. Administration of rosuvastatin for 30 days
after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) showed the
effect on reducing dementia [13]. Similar results were also
reported in treatment by simvastatin or atorvastatin [14].
Additionally, statin might be related to reducing risk of
dementia [15‚Äì17], and it received attention regarding playing

2
another role in neurodegenerative disease. In Parkinson‚Äôs
disease (PD) animal model, simvastatin treatment showed
various neuroprotective effects by interacting with NMDA
receptor [18] and also by regulating muscarinic M1/4 receptor
[19]. Additionally, mevalonate pathway inhibited the neurites
outgrowth by blocking the cell rounding rapidly induced [17].
However, it is extremely poorly reported that statin affects
NA system which is deeply affected and altered by cerebral
ischemic stroke and closely related to chronic disabilities of
physical and emotional type. This current study presented the
visualized noradrenergic neuronal circuitry using a genetic
tracing method and investigated the effects of statins on the
functional recovery after stroke by focusing on NA neuron
circuitry and its function. We put the point on the behavioral
improvement in chronic stage by statin treatment.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Animal Model and Drug Treatment. To obtain focal cerebral ischemia animal model, adult male C57BL/6 mice (23‚Äì
26 g; Orient Co., Gyeonggi-do, South Korea) were housed
in a 12 h light/dark cycle and permitted food and water.
These mice were anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane
in N2 O/O2 (%, 70 : 30) and subjected to fFCI by MCA
occlusion with a surgical nylon suture (5.0, Silkam, B.Braum,
PA, USA) for 1 hour. A Laser Doppler flowmeter (Transonic
System Inc., New York, USA) probe placed directly on the
skull surface over the territory of the MCA (1 mm posterior
and 5 mm lateral to bregma) measured regional CBF before
and after occlusion and immediately before sacrifice. Blood
pressure was monitored by cannulating a femoral artery with
Pressure Transducer (Harvard Apparatus, Inc., Holliston,
MA, USA). All procedures were approved by the animal
care committee at Yonsei University medical college. Statin
(atorvastatin) was dissolved to concentration of 1 mg/mL in
5% methanol (methanol 10 ùúáL in saline 20 mL). The prepared
statin solution was treated with intraperitoneal injection with
10 mg/kg from 1 day after MCAO.
2.2. MRI Analysis and Infarct Size Measurement. To obtain
consecutive brain damage images, we performed MRI scans
of mice. For MRI analysis, mice were put on a horizontal
bore (400 mm) after anesthetizing with isoflurane by 4.7
Teslar MR scanner (Brucker Biospin, Billerica, MA, USA).
Images were obtained using a T2-weighted fast spin echo
sequence. Diffusion images were also acquired. Temperature
was maintained and respiration was monitored throughout
the entire scan. Mice recovered quickly following the scan
with a 100% survival rate. Among the obtained MR images,
4 cuts were used in infarct size measurement and were
combined. Each damage region was measured by ImageJ and
represented by relative value with area of contralateral side
versus damaged area of ipsilateral side.
2.3. Recombinant Adenoviral Construction and Viral Infection.
The procedure for generation of recombinant adenoviruses
was described and performed previously [20, 21]. The PRSWGA adenovirus was friendly gifted from Dr. Huh, Kyung
Hee University. A gene cassette containing the WGA gene

Neural Plasticity
downstream of the PRS2x8 promoter was inserted into the
pAdTrack plasmid and finally into the pAdEasy1. Recombinant adenoviral DNA was cut with Pac1 and transfected into
HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, CA, USA).
Viruses were harvested 5 days after transfection from the
transfected HEK293 cells and amplified on dishes. The viral
particles were purified by cesium chloride density gradient
ultracentrifugation, dialyzed, and tittered.
Animals were anesthetized and placed in a stereotaxic
instrument. After incision of the skin, a small burr hole was
made directly at LC (5.4 mm posterior, 1.0 mm lateral, and
3.8 mm deep to bregma) and the viral vector was unilaterally
injected into the LC of ischemic hemisphere using a Hamilton
syringe (Hamilton Co., Nevada, USA). A single injection
of 0.2‚àº0.3 ùúáL of the concentrated adenovirus suspension
(about 2 √ó 1013 cfu/mL) was used in this study. The scalp was
then sutured, and then the mouse was returned to standard
housing. After 2 days of virus injection, mice were perfused
with 4% formaldehyde and the brains were removed for
histological analysis.
2.4. Immunohistochemistry. Fixed mouse brains were sectioned with a cryostat to obtain 40 ùúám sections, respectively.
The sections were pretreated for 20 min with 1% H2 O2 in PBS
containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for inactivation of endogenous
peroxidase activity and permeabilization of cells. The sections
were then incubated for 30 min with 5% normal rabbit
serum in PBS to block nonspecific protein-binding sites
and incubated with anti-WGA polyclonal antibody (1 : 2000,
Vector Laboratory, CA, USA) and anti-BrdU monoclonal
antibody (1 : 200, AbD Serotec, UK) in PBS containing 0.3%
Triton X-100 with 2% normal rabbit serum overnight at 4‚àò C
and for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing, the
sections were incubated with biotin-labeled anti-goat IgG
(1 : 200, Vector Laboratory) followed by Vectastatin ABC
elite kit (Vector Laboratory), TSA kit (Perkin Elmer, Boston,
USA), and Vectastatin ABC elite kit again. Signals were
visualized with Ni2+ -intensified diaminobenzidine/peroxide
reaction kit (Vector Laboratory). Specimens were observed
with a microscope and computerized digital camera system
(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan: Provis) and an image analysis
system and program (Adobe Photoshop, San Jose, CA).
2.5. BrdU Labeling and Tissue Processing. Cell proliferation
was measured by the incorporation of the thymidine analogue 5Û∏Ä† -bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) that is incorporated
into the DNA of dividing cells in immunohistochemically
detectable quantities during the S phase of cell division. After
MCAO, the animals were twice injected intraperitoneally
with BrdU (Roche) (50 mg/kg at a concentration of 10 mg/mL
in 0.9% NaCl) at 24 hours and 1 hour before sacrifice.
For immunohistochemical detection of incorporated BrdU,
double-stranded DNA was denatured to a single-stranded
form suitable for immunohistochemical detection on sections. Sections were incubated in 50% formamide in standard
sodium citrate at 65‚àò C for 2 hours and treated further with
2 M HCl at 35‚àò C for 30 min. After being rinsed for 10 min
at room temperature in 0.1 M boric acid, the sections were
washed with PBS and then incubated with 0.03% H2 O2 in

methanol for 5 min. The sections were incubated with a
primary antibody against BrdU (1 : 1,000, Roche Diagnostics)
at room temperature for 30 minutes, washed with PBS, and
reacted with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1 : 200,
Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA, USA) for 30 min at room
temperature. After washing, stained tissue samples were
mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Lab,
Burlingame, CA, USA).
2.6. Behavioral Assessment-Light/Dark Transition Test and
Resident-Aggression-Intruder Test
2.6.1. Light/Dark Transition Test. The test is based on the
aversive nature of mice to light and on their spontaneous
exploratory behavior in new environments [22]. The apparatus for the test consisted of a dark chamber and a bright
chamber. There are gates to pass between two chambers and
mice are allowed to move freely between the two chambers.
The test is performed in the bright illuminated chamber and
the number of entries into the dark chamber evaluated for
5 min. Besides the number of transitions, latent time in dark
chamber was evaluated.
2.6.2. Resident-Aggression-Intruder Test. Mice were habituated in the same cage for at least over 1 week. Aggression
level was assessed with three sessions at three-day interval.
Evaluating items were duration of aggressive behavior and the
number of aggression. Duration of aggression indicates the
sum of time that determine resident animal the duration to
show active move action toward intruder, social exploration,
lateral threat, or clinch attack. Latency to attack was expressed
by measuring the time between the introduction of the
intruder and the first clinch attack.

2.7. Data Analysis. The data were expressed as mean ¬± S.D.
The statistical comparisons were performed by unpaired ùë°test and one-way ANOVA (StatView, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary,
NC, USA). The significance between the groups was assigned
at ‚àó ùëù < 0.05 and ‚àó‚àó ùëù < 0.001.

3. Results
3.1. Adenovirus-Mediated NA Neuron Expressing WGA in
the Locus Coeruleus (LC). Adenoviral construct used in this
study contains the wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) gene under
control of the eight copies of PRS promoter and the green
fluorescent protein (GFP) gene under the control of the
cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, which makes it possible
to detect viral delivery to the target sites (Figure 1(a)). After
injection of the PRS-WGA adenovirus to the LC, localization
of GFP expression and WGA protein was examined on
adjacent coronal sections. Colocalization of GFP and WGA
demonstrates that WGA protein was synthesized in NA neurons of the LC in our previous report [21]. In sagittal sections
of noninjured brain, intense WGA immunoreactivity was
detected in the pontine reticular nucleus, motor and sensory
trigeminal nucleus, thalamic nucleus, lateral hypothalamic
area, deep mesencephalic nucleus, superior colliculus, caudate putamen, corpus callosum, anterior commissure, and
olfactory bulb (Figure 1(b)). WGA immunoreactivity was
also observed in the parabrachial nucleus, A5 NA cells, substantia nigra, lateral habenular nucleus, hippocampus, optic
tract, and piriform cortex in coronal sections (Figure 1(b)).
In adenovirus infected mice there was no evidence of cell
loss or tissue damage due to the viral infection in LC. All of
the experimental animals that recovered after the infection
remained healthy until being sacrificed without exhibiting
any behavioral abnormalities.

3.2. Transsynaptic Transfer of WGA in Noradrenergic Neurons
of Vehicle-Treated and Statin-Treated Mice after MCA Occlusion. After transient focal cerebral ischemia (tFCI), WGA
immunoreactivity showed the transsynaptic pattern of NA
neurons according to day in each vehicle-treated or statintreated mouse (Figure 2). NA circuits containing thalamic
area, lateral hypothalamic area, cortex, and hippocampus
were destroyed with severe infarction (data not shown).
Although a large infarction was formed in the MCA territory,
mice that survived slowly and gradually recovered the damaged area in the long-term stage (Figure 2(a)). When statin
was given for a long period, the convalescence periods were
faster than the vehicle-treated mice (Figure 2(b)). Whereas
WGA immunoreactivity was not detected in some region
such as superior colliculus from 1 month to 8 months

in vehicle-treated mice after tFCI, a very strong WGA
immunoreactivity was observed in the statin-treated mice
in the intrabulbar part of the anterior commissure (aci) and
lateral habenular nucleus (LHb). These features indicated that
damaged NA circuits were partly reorganized over time in the
area of previous lesion.

MCAO in Vehicle- or Statin-Treated Mice. Physiological data

group). Presented in the magnetic resonance images (MRI),
the infarcted area after reperfusion from MCAO was gradually reduced, and significantly statin-treated mice showed
smaller infarct area than vehicle-treated mice (Figure 3).
After a longer period, the damaged brain region was naturally
ameliorated even in the vehicle-treated mice, but the recovery
showed earlier in statin-treated mice than vehicle-treated
mice. The differences in the recovery time determined the
behavioral improvement and related to NA neuron circuitry,
as shown in the result of the behavior test (Figure 5).
3.4. Neurogenesis after Ischemic Injury in Normal and Vehicleor Atorvastatin-Treated Mice. In postischemic brain injury,
neuronal cells derived from neural precursor cells are newly
born and the cells can be detected by bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU). The BrdU-immunopositive cells were observed in
the postischemic cortex, striatum, and subventricular zone
(SVZ) on the ipsilateral side of the ischemic infarct at 1
month and 6 months (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). The BrdUpositive cells were more frequently observed in the ipsilateral
side of the statin-treated mice than in the contralateral side.
Especially at 1 month after tFCI, many BrdU- and NeuNimmunopositive cells were detected in the lesioned cortex

and striatum at the direct site to ischemic damage by MCAO
(Figure 4(c)). It could be implicated that newborn cells have
arisen from the SVZ and migrated into striatum and even
into cortical area. Moreover, the proliferation of neural cells
is promoted by long-term statin treatment. At 6 months and 8
months after fFCI, the incidence of BrdU-positive cells in the
ipsilateral striatum and cortex was significantly diminished
compared to that of 1 month after fFCI (data not shown). The
BrdU-positive cells were not detected in either striatum or
cortex, but a few BrdU-positive cells were detected in SVZ
and corpus callosum.
3.5. Neurological Outcome and Physiological Parameters
according to NA Circuitry. The mean arterial blood pressure
(MABP) slightly increased until 4 months after fFCI and
then gradually returned to the initial level at 8 months
(Figure 5(a)). In contrast, statin treatment for a long period
sustained the constant MABP level overall duration after
tFCI. The body temperature and weight governed by NA
system were also monitored according to month, but they
just slightly oscillated with no significant changes. To evaluate
the NA system alteration after tFCI and effects of statin on
the NA system after tFCI, mice performed the light/dark

transition test and aggression-intruder test. In the light/dark
transition test, the number entering into the bright chamber
from the dark chamber was convalescent at 6 months onward
(Figure 5(b)). However, the duration of time spent in the
light chamber for vehicle-treated mice was longer, over two
times the normal, until 6 months and then it got back to
normal at 8 months. Whereas the vehicle-treated mice had
a fluctuation, the statin-treated mice were stable from the
initial to final stage. The duration of aggression swung in
the vehicle-treated mice; however, the duration in statintreated mice did not vacillate (Figure 5(c)). The tendency to
show aggression to new intruder was slightly higher in statintreated mice than vehicle-treated mice in later stages (i.e., at

8 months). In general, statin-treated mice presented peaceful
condition without upset through the observed duration.

4. Discussion
This study demonstrated that the NA neurons were transsynaptically labeled by the WGA-expressing adenoviral vector.
By simply injecting the virus into the unilateral LC, the NA
neural pathways were clearly visualized with great accuracy
and high reproducibility from the LC to its projection
areas of interest. The current study shows the following: (1)

by statin. (2) Eventually statin ameliorated the damaged
behavioral function of NAergic neuron during long-term
recovery period after stroke injury.
The WGA protein injection method had been used to
visualize optic pathways in monkeys [23], olfactory systems
in rodents [24], common afferent projections to the LC
in rat [25], and connections of the A5 noradrenergic cell
group in rat [26]. A genetic strategy employing cDNA for
WGA as a transgene under the control of specific promoter
elements was introduced in neural tracing study [27]. The
present method successfully and reliably detected strong
transsynaptically transferred WGA protein, which might be
related to efficient infection of the adenovirus to the NA
neurons, as well as the promoter elements (PRS promoter)
being used for robust expression of WGA. PRS has previously
been shown to be an NA-specific cis element binding to
paired-like homeodomain factor Phox2a/Phox2b [28]. It
has been confirmed that increasing copies of PRS cause
synergistic activation of reporter gene expression, reaching
maximal efficacy at eight copies [20], which is in agreement
with successful visualization of the NA system in a mouse
brain with a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing WGA
under the control of PRS promoter elements in this study
(Figure 1). NA is the neurotransmitter being implicated in
many of these disorders and has been found to affect social
behavior in both humans and animals [29, 30]. Therefore,
investigating alterations of the NA systems in stroke may
provide clues to the understanding of its symptomology,
clinical courses, and adequate management. NA alteration
may help to modulate the pathologically altered motor system
in stroke patients, which resulted in upregulated coupling
of damaged motor areas and consequently improved motor
function [15]. Actually d-Amphetamine has a role in multiple
brain transmitter systems, improved functional recovery after
stroke, and its effect has been attributed to its noradrenergic
systems [31]. Intense WGA immunoreactivity was initially
detected in the most contralateral side and the ipsilateral
nonlesioned areas, such as the thalamic nucleus, lateral
habenular nucleus, and amygdala. These findings suggest that
compensatory reinforcement of undamaged contralateral NA
circuits occurred shortly after the onset of tFCI and then
evolved into subsequent reorganization of NA circuitries
in severely damaged area. Moreover, this process can be
promoted by statin treatment. When NA synaptic activity
increased pharmacologically, symptoms derived by cortical
damage were recovered [32]. Synaptic activity also represents
the functional recovery after a stroke in human. After
focal cortical damage, circuitry reorganization is related to
functional recovery, which takes place at the primary cortical
level [33]. Therefore, investigating alterations of NA systems
in stroke may provide clues to understand its symptomology,
clinical courses, and adequate management. It has been
known that an acute stroke induced by MCAO induced
cellular proliferation or neurogenesis in the ipsilateral SVZ
and that a large number of immature neurons migrate from
the SVZ to ipsilateral infarcted areas at 2 weeks following
insults [34, 35]. Statins are well-known drug to reduce
cholesterol level. There are some reports that chronic statin
treatment promotes endogenous neuronal cell proliferation,

Neural Plasticity
neurogenesis, and new synapse formation, as well as protecting the neuron from cell death in acute stage [12, 14].
In a long-term stage, we assume that statins are involved in
facilitating long-term recovery after stroke by reconnecting
the NA circuit using the newly proliferated cells in SVZ
or subgranular zone (SGZ). BrdU immunohistochemistry, a
thymidine analogue, was used at 1 month and 6 months after
tFCI (Figure 4). It was also known that brain insults such as
cerebral ischemia, causing neuronal death, are accompanied
by increased neurogenesis in the SGZ and SVZ [36, 37].
BrdU-positive cells were observed in cortical and striatal
lesions, and increased numbers of BrdU-positive cells were
observed in SVZ and corpus callosum, which is consistent
with the process of initial neuronal proliferation in SVZ and
the subsequent migration into the ischemic lesions as a repair
mechanism.
To assess the relationship of the remodeling process with
functional recovery in the NA system, the alteration of blood
pressure was measured starting 1 month after tFCI (Figure 5).
Blood pressure and behavior change following acute ischemic
stroke were related with the anatomical reorganization from
6-months after tFCI. Besides blood pressure [38, 39], dysfunction of the NA system has been widely known to be
associated with body temperature [40, 41], body weight [42],
and anxiety [29, 43]. Previous experiments indicate that
blood pressure is significantly higher in mice having insular
infarction [38, 39]. The insular cortex is directly connected
with central nucleus of the amygdala and the posterior lateral
hypothalamus [44, 45] belonging to NA system. Our results
indicated that altered physiological dysfunction by acute
ischemic stroke injury gradually recovered with the reorganization of damaged processes in the mature NA systems
in those structures. The behavioral test using the light/dark
test and the aggression-intruder test showed a significant
difference between vehicle-treated mice and statin-treated
mice (Figure 5). For longer period of up to 8 months after
stroke attack, statin improved the malfunctioning anxiety and
aggression from an earlier period. Vehicle-treated mice had
altered anxiety-like behavior in a time-dependent manner
following tFCI, as displayed by a significant increase in the
time spent in the light chamber. In contrast to the fluctuating
pattern related to the NA system in vehicle-treated mice,
statin-treated mice were stable. Increase in NA signaling is
associated with higher anxiety and decreased NA signaling
with lower anxiety [46, 47]. It has been reported that oxidative
stress in the CNS is related to anxiety [48, 49], and aggressive
behavior is linked to oxidative stress, which is one of the
main pathologies of ischemic stroke [50]. Our results also
presented that after initial dysfunction of NA activities,
gradual recovery followed along with reorganization of NA
circuits in the infarcted structures.

5. Conclusion
Taken together, the present study visualized the NA circuitry
of mice by tracing with the PRS-WGA adenoviral system after
tFCI for a long duration. Our result showed the reorganization of damaged NA circuit after tFCI. In a chronic stage after
stroke, statins were involved in long-term recovery of the NA

circuitry and promoted the neurons to be proliferated and
migrate to the infarcted area. Statins could ameliorate the NArelated malfunction after stroke in a chronic period.
