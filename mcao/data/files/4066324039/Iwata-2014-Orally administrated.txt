Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is known to exacerbate cerebral ischemic injury. In the present
study, we investigated antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects of oral supplementation
of ascorbic acid (AA) on cerebral injury caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion and
reperfusion (MCAO/Re) in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. We also evaluated
the effects of AA on expression of sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2) and
glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) after MCAO/Re in the brain. The diabetic state markedly
aggravated MCAO/Re-induced cerebral damage, as assessed by infarct volume and edema.
Pretreatment with AA (100 mg/kg, p.o.) for two weeks significantly suppressed the
exacerbation of damage in the brain of diabetic rats. AA also suppressed the production of
superoxide radical, activation of caspase-3, and expression of proinflammatory cytokines
(tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β) in the ischemic penumbra. Immunohistochemical
staining revealed that expression of SVCT2 was upregulated primarily in neurons and
capillary endothelial cells after MCAO/Re in the nondiabetic cortex, accompanied by an
increase in total AA (AA + dehydroascorbic acid) in the tissue, and that these responses
were suppressed in the diabetic rats. AA supplementation to the diabetic rats restored these
responses to the levels of the nondiabetic rats. Furthermore, AA markedly upregulated the
basal expression of GLUT1 in endothelial cells of nondiabetic and diabetic cortex, which

did not affect total AA levels in the cortex. These results suggest that daily intake of AA
attenuates the exacerbation of cerebral ischemic injury in a diabetic state, which may be
attributed to anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects via the improvement of
augmented oxidative stress in the brain. AA supplementation may protect endothelial
function against the exacerbated ischemic oxidative injury in the diabetic state and improve
AA transport through SVCT2 in the cortex.

1. Introduction
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder associated with chronic hyperglycemia, which is known to
enhance systemic oxidative stress, predisposing to diabetic complications. Diabetes is a major risk
factor for atherosclerotic diseases such as acute brain ischemia [1,2]. Moreover, it increases the risks of
morbidity and mortality after stroke [3,4]. Oxidative stress plays an essential role in the pathogenesis
of transient cerebral ischemic injury [3–5]. In particular, reperfusion after a long period of vessel
occlusion triggers the explosive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide
radical (O2–), hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, etc., which causes apoptosis and delayed death of
cells through oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA in the ischemic penumbral region [6–9].
In addition to apoptotic cell death, inflammatory neurodegeneration is another crucial process contributing
to cerebral damage after ischemia and reperfusion [10]. ROS have been shown to activate nuclear
factor-κB, which enhances the transcription of the genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines such as
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), leading to inflammatory responses [11].
Myeloperoxidase (MPO) expressed by microglia, a histopathological marker of inflammation,
generates cytotoxic ROS and leads to further inflammatory damage in the ischemic tissue [12].
Accumulating evidence indicates that hyperglycemia in diabetes is associated with a decrease in the
antioxidant potential and an increase in ROS generation [13–15]. In addition, diabetes has been shown
to be a proinflammatory state that increases the risk of vascular complications [16,17]. Thus, the
enhanced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in the diabetic state may substantially contribute
to the aggravation of cerebral injury caused by transient ischemia and subsequent reperfusion.
L-ascorbic acid (AA) is an essential antioxidant for scavenging free radicals in the brain.
AA participates not only in sustaining the normal function of the central nervous system (CNS) but in
ameliorating the damage induced by pathological conditions that increase the generation of ROS [18].
The CNS maintains relatively high concentrations of AA, indicating a neuroprotective role for AA [19].
The transport of AA from the plasma to the CNS is mainly mediated by sodium-dependent vitamin C
transporter 2 (SVCT2). In addition, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is located in the endothelial cells of
the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and transports oxidized AA ([dehydroascorbic acid (DHA)) as another
source of AA to the brain. Upregulation of SVCT2 [20] and GLUT1 [21] expression has been
demonstrated in rats with cerebral ischemic injury, which suggests that AA is necessary for protection

Nutrients 2014, 6

1556

against oxidative neuronal injury. The concentration of AA is considered to reflect oxidative stress in
animal tissues sensitively [22]. Patients with ischemic stroke or diabetes have lower concentrations of
AA in the plasma, suggesting that a systemic decrease in AA is a consequence of enhanced
consumption of AA by elevated oxidative stress [23,24]. In a previous study, we demonstrated that
chronic supplementation with AA attenuates oxidative stress in both the plasma and the brain and
alleviates cerebral injury induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/Re) in
rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes [25]. We showed that the activity of antioxidant
enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) is decreased, and lipid
peroxidation is accelerated in the brain of diabetic rats; those detrimental oxidative processes are
inhibited by AA supplementation. These data suggest that the enhanced oxidative stress in the diabetic
state causes the functional impairment of antioxidant enzymes, and the resulting diminution in
antioxidative defense can cause further enhancement of the generation of ROS and subsequent
neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory neurodegeneration in the ischemic brain. Nonetheless, there is a
shortage of studies so far on the antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects of AA in cerebral
ischemia with diabetes.
In the present study, we evaluated the effects of chronic oral pretreatment with AA on the
production of O2– and on apoptosis in the brain after MCAO/Re in rats with STZ-induced diabetes. To
test whether AA suppresses inflammatory responses induced by MCAO/Re, we also examined the
effects of AA on the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and MPO in the brain. Although the transport of AA
to the CNS is an important factor for its neuroprotection, changes in expression of SVCT2 and GLUT1
proteins in response to AA supplementation and/or cerebral ischemia in diabetic state have not been
reported. Therefore, we investigated the effects of AA supplementation on the expression of SVCT2
and GLUT1 after MCAO/Re in the brain of diabetic rats.
2. Experimental Section
2.1. Experimental Animals
Animal care and surgical procedures were performed in accordance with guidelines approved by the
National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA) and the Josai University Animal Research
Committee. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (4 weeks old, weight 120–140 g) were purchased from Japan
SLC (Shizuoka, Japan) and were housed under standard conditions with a temperature-controlled
environment (23 °C ± 0.5 °C) and a 12 h light/dark cycle. The animals were allowed free access to
rodent chow (CE-2, CLEA Japan, Tokyo, Japan) and water. Type 1 diabetes was induced in the rats
(diabetic group) by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (50 mg/kg of body weight) dissolved in
0.1 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.5, while the normal control rats (nondiabetic group) were injected with
the buffer only [26]. Seven days after the injection of STZ, a blood sample was collected by tail vein
paracentesis, following which plasma glucose was measured using a glucose analyzer (Ascensia, Bayer
Yakuhin, Osaka, Japan). Diabetes was defined as a blood glucose level greater than 300 mg/dL. Then,
the diabetic and nondiabetic groups were divided into 2 groups and were housed for an additional
6 weeks until stroke was induced by MCAO/Re. AA (L-Ascorbic acid, Wako Pure Chemicals
Industries, Osaka, Japan) (100 mg/kg; nondiabetic and diabetic AA-supplemented groups) or distilled

Nutrients 2014, 6

1557

water (nondiabetic and diabetic control groups) was orally administered through nasogastric tube once
daily for the last 2 weeks. AA was stored at +4 °C, and dissolved in distilled water fresh each time just
before administration.
2.2. MCAO/Re
The experimental MCAO/Re rat model was prepared as described previously [25]. The rats were
anesthetized with halothane (4% for induction and 1.5% for maintenance) under spontaneous respiration.
After a midline incision on the neck, the right common carotid artery was isolated under an operating
microscope. All branches of the external carotid artery were ligated. The tip of a 4–0 surgical nylon
monofilament rounded by flame heating was inserted through the internal carotid artery and advanced
to occlude the origin of MCA. The rectal temperature was maintained at 37 °C with a heat lamp and a
heating pad during the operation. After 2 h of occlusion, the filament was withdrawn to enable
reperfusion. The distance from bifurcation of the common carotid artery to the tip of the suture was
approximately 20 mm in all rats. Cerebral blood flow was detected using a Laser Doppler flowmetry
(ATBF-LC1, Unique Medical, Tokyo, Japan), and approximately 50% reduction of its baseline
associated with MCAO was ascertained in the rats. Then, the rats were allowed to recover from
anesthesia at room temperature and were killed after 24 h of reperfusion. Sham operation involved the
same manipulations but insertion of the filament.
2.3. Infarct and Edema Assessment
After 24 h of reperfusion, the rats were subjected to general halothane anesthesia and decapitated.
The brain was immediately removed and placed in ice-cold saline. Each brain was then cut into 2 mm
coronal slices in a rat brain matrix. The brain slices were immediately immersed in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyl
tetrazolium chloride (TTC, Wako Pure Chemicals Industries, Osaka, Japan) at 37 °C for 15 min and
then in 4% formaldehyde [26,27]. Infarct areas were identified using an image analysis system (Scion
Image 1.62, Frederick, MD, USA) and were combined to obtain the infarct volumes per brain according
to the following formula: corrected infarct volume (%) = (left hemisphere volume − (right hemisphere
volume − the infarct volume)) × 100/left hemisphere volume. Edema in the ischemic hemisphere was
also calculated as follows: edema (%) = (right hemisphere volume − the infarct volume)/left
hemisphere volume × 100.
2.4. Neurological Evaluation
Postischemic neurological deficits were evaluated after 24 h of reperfusion on a 5-point scale as
follows: grade 0, no deficit; grade 1, failure to fully extend the right forepaw; grade 2, spontaneous
circling or walking to a contralateral side; grade 3, walking only when stimulated; grade 4, unresponsive
to stimulation and a depressed level of consciousness; and grade 5, death [25,27]. Before MCAO, the
neurological score was zero in all the rats. The rats that did not exhibit neurological deficits after
MCAO/Re were excluded from the study. Grades of the neurological score were evaluated by an
investigator blinded to the treatment protocol.

2.5. Detection of O2− Production in the Brain
Detection of intracellular O2− production in the ischemic penumbral region of the cortex after
MCAO/Re was performed by histochemical staining of freshly frozen brain sections (8 μm thick) with
the fluorescent probe dihydroethidium (DHE). The brain sections were immediately incubated with
DHE (10 μmol/L, Sigma-Aldrich Japan, Tokyo, Japan) in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min
at 37 °C [28,29]. To determine the fluorescence intensity of oxidized DHE, 3 visual fields within the
penumbral cortex regions of each hemisphere were photographed using a confocal laser scanning
microscope (Fluoview FV1000, OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan) with excitation at 510 nm and emission
at 580 nm. Fluorescence intensity of oxidized DHE was quantified using imaging software
(FV10-ASW 1.7, OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan). Analyses of immunohistochemistry were performed by
an investigator blinded to the treatment protocol.
2.6. Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining was performed as described previously [20,30,31]. The brain was
fixed with 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde. Coronal brain sections (8 μm thick) were
incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 40 min at room temperature to inhibit endogenous
peroxidase and then incubated with blocking buffer (4% Block Ace, Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma,
Osaka, Japan) for 2 h. Then, the slices were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-IL-1β antibody
(1:300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), polyclonal rabbit anti-TNF-α antibody (1:200,
Rabbit mAb, Hycult Biotech, Uden, The Netherlands), polyclonal rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3
antibody (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), or monoclonal mouse anti-MPO
(1:100, Hycult Biotech, Uden, The Netherlands), polyclonal rabbit anti-SVCT2 antibody (1:100, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), polyclonal rabbit anti-GLUT1 antibody (1:100, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) in 0.01 mol/L phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. In a
double-immunohistchemical study for determination of the cell types of expressing SVCT2 or GLUT1,
monoclonal mouse anti-neuronal nuclei (NeuN) antibody (1:300, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and
monoclonal mouse anti-rat endothelial cell antigen (RECA1) antibody (1:200, Abcom, Cambridge,
UK) were used. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the slices were incubated with either
Cy3- or FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) for 2 h at room
temperature. Finally, the sections were incubated with the nuclear stain TO-PRO-3 (1:10,000,
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature with
gentle agitation. Immunofluorescence was visualized using the laser scanning confocal microscope and
the intensity was measured using the imaging software. Three sections per rat and 3–4 rats per group
were used for the analyses.
2.7. Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Analysis
The expression levels of SVCT2 (Slc23a2) and GLUT1 (Slc2a1) mRNA were assessed by quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described previously [32]. The rats subjected to MCAO
were killed after 24 h of reperfusion, and total RNA samples were prepared from the ischemic
penumbral cortex of each rat. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden,

Nutrients 2014, 6

1559

Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA (500 pg) from each sample was
reverse-transcribed with oligo-dT and random hexamer primers using reverse transcriptase
(PrimeScript RT Enzyme Mix I; Takara RNA PCR Kit, Takara Biomedicals, Shiga, Japan). Real-time
PCR was performed with 10 ng of cDNA and a pair of gene-specific primers (Takara Biomedicals,
Shiga, Japan) that were added to the SYBR Premix EX Taq (Takara Biomedicals, Shiga, Japan) and
subjected to PCR amplification on the iCycler iQ Real-Time Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA, USA) (1 cycle at 95 °C for 10 s and 50 cycles at 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 34 s).
β-Actin expression was used to normalize the cDNA levels. The PCR products were analyzed using a
melting curve to ascertain specificity of the amplification. The data were expressed as mean ± SD
relative to the sham-operated nondiabetic group.
2.8. Measurement of Total AA Level
Total AA (AA + DHA) levels in the plasma and cortex have been determined by spectrophotometric
method using Vitamin C Assay kit (ROIK02, Shima Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan) which is based on
2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine method [33]. Briefly, plasma was mixed with an equal volume of 10%
metaphosphoric acid solution. Cortex tissue was mixed with 14 times volume of 5.4% metaphosphoric
acid solution and homogenized. After centrifugation of the solutions at 10,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C,
the supernatants were used to the assay.
2.9. Statistical Analysis
Two-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Tukey’s multiple-comparison test, was used for statistical
analysis. Neurological deficit scores were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by the
Mann-Whitney U test. In all cases, a p value of <0.05 was assumed to denote statistical significance.
3. Results
3.1. Blood Glucose and Body Weight
Body weight and blood glucose data from the experimental rats were obtained throughout the study
period (Table 1). Similar to our previous study [25], the diabetic control group of rats had a significantly
decreased body weight and an increased blood glucose level compared with the nondiabetic control
group. There were no significant differences in those parameters between the AA-supplemented
groups and their controls.

3.2. Ischemic Brain Injury and Neurological Deficits
Figure 1 shows MCAO/Re-induced brain injury in the nondiabetic control, nondiabetic + AA,
diabetic control, and diabetic + AA groups of rats. Examples of TTC staining in the coronal brain
sections at 24 h after MCAO/Re are shown in Figure 1A. The infarct developed in the corpus striatum
and cortex of the nondiabetic control rats. In the diabetic rats, the infarction zone was remarkably
enlarged and extended to a large part of the left striatum and cortex. In contrast, the infarcts in the
AA-supplemented groups were smaller than those in their respective controls. Quantitative assays
revealed that the infarct volume and edema in the diabetic control group were significantly increased
by approximately 2.5-fold and 2-fold, respectively, compared with those in the nondiabetic control
group (Figure 1B,C). AA supplementation in the nondiabetic group significantly decreased infarction
and edema. Furthermore, AA almost completely suppressed the exacerbation of brain damage by diabetes.

Consistent with the aforementioned results of the brain injury experiments, neurological deficits
were exacerbated in the diabetic control group of rats (Figure 2). Compared with the diabetic control
group, the diabetic + AA group showed significant alleviation of the neurological deficits.

3.3. O2– Production after Ischemia with Reperfusion
Figure 3 shows fluorescence intensity of DHE in the penumbral cortex, which depends on intracellular
O2 production. Representative histological images of DHE staining in the nondiabetic control,
nondiabetic + AA, diabetic control, and diabetic + AA groups are shown in Figure 3A. DHE-positive
cells with low fluorescence intensity were sparsely distributed in the cortex of sham-operated
nondiabetic rats. In contrast, sham-operated diabetic rats had an increased number of DHE-positive
cells with higher fluorescence intensity in the cortex, indicating basal augmentation of the generation
of ROS in the brain of the diabetic rats. The intensity of DHE fluorescence was remarkably increased
by MCAO/Re in the nondiabetic rats and was further augmented in the diabetic rats, suggesting that
the exacerbated injury can be attributed to enhanced generation of ROS in diabetes. AA supplementation
significantly reduced the fluorescence of DHE in the cortex of the nondiabetic and diabetic rats
compared with that in their respective controls.

3.4. Apoptosis Induced by Ischemia with Reperfusion
Activation of caspase-3, a key mediator of the execution phase of apoptosis, was determined by
immunostaining for cleaved caspase-3, which is an activated form of this enzyme, in the ischemic
penumbral cortex of the four experimental groups after MCAO/Re (Figure 4). Compared with the
nondiabetic control group, the number of cleaved caspase-3 positive cells was remarkably increased by
MCAO/Re in the diabetic control group. AA significantly attenuated the MCAO/Re-induced activation
of caspase-3 in the nondiabetic and diabetic groups.

3.5. Expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, and MPO in the Cortex
To assess the effects of AA supplementation on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, we
performed immunohistochemical staining for IL-1β and TNF-α. This experiment confirmed upregulation
of the protein level of these cytokines as a result of MCAO/Re and diabetes (Figures 5 and 6).
Quantification of the immunostaining data showed that the sham-operated diabetic control group had a
significant increase in IL-1β and TNF-α expression compared with the sham-operated nondiabetic
control group, suggesting basal augmentation of the inflammatory response in the diabetic brain.

Nutrients 2014, 6

1564

MCAO/Re significantly increased the expression levels of those proinflammatory cytokines in the
nondiabetic cortex. The ischemia-induced upregulation of those cytokines was markedly accelerated
by diabetes: the diabetic control group showed a 15.9- and 21.0-fold increase in IL-1β and TNF-α
expression, respectively, compared with the nondiabetic control group. AA supplementation significantly
suppressed the basal and ischemia-enhanced expression of these cytokines in diabetic rats.

MCAO/Re

In the nondiabetic rat cortex, the protein expression of MPO was markedly upregulated after
MCAO/Re (Figure 7). AA supplementation abrogated the ischemia-induced increase in MPO
expression. Compared with the nondiabetic rats, the basal level of MPO expression increased only
slightly in the diabetic rats. MCAO/Re upregulated the expression of MPO to the level similar to that
in the nondiabetic group. AA supplementation had no effect on the ischemia-induced increase in the
MPO level in the diabetic rats.

3.6. Expression of SVCT2 and GLUT1 in the Cortex
The expression and transport activity of SVCT2 as a specific transporter of AA in the CNS have
been reported to be enhanced after MCAO/Re in mice [20]. In addition, DHA is known to be transported
across the BBB via GLUT1 [19]; thus, we investigated effects of AA supplementation on changes in
the expression of SVCT2 and GLUT1 mRNA in diabetic animals with or without MCAO/Re
(Figure 8). There was no significant difference in the basal expression levels of SVCT2 mRNA
between the nondiabetic and diabetic groups or between each of them and their AA-supplemented

Nutrients 2014, 6

groups. In the nondiabetic and nondiabetic + AA groups, the expression level of SVCT2 mRNA was
equally upregulated at 24 h after MCAO/Re. In contrast, the upregulation of ischemia-induced
SVCT2 mRNA expression was not observed in the diabetic control group, whereas it was observed in
the diabetic + AA group. Compared with the nondiabetic control group, the diabetic state significantly
downregulated the expression of GLUT1 mRNA in the cortex. AA supplementation increased the
expression of GLUT1 in the nondiabetic and diabetic rats. In the nondiabetic and diabetic control
groups, MCAO/Re had a stimulating effect on the expression of GLUT1 mRNA that was similar to
the effect of AA supplementation. Further enhancement by ischemia was not detected in the
AA-supplemented groups.

MCAO/Re

To assess the effects of AA supplementation on the expression of SVCT2 protein after MCAO/Re
in detail, the localization and the expression levels of SVCT2 in the penumbral cortex were examined
by immunohistochemical staining (Figure 9A). Double immunofluorescence staining with antibodies
of anti-SVCT2 and anti-NeuN, a biomarker for neurons, revealed that majority of the cells exhibiting
SVCT2 expressed NeuN in the sham-operated nondiabetic and diabetic rat cortex (Figure 9A). In addition,
the cells exhibiting the endothelial cell maker RECA1 showed a low level of SVCT2-immunoreactivity
(Figure 9B). These expression levels in the neurons and capillary endothelial cells of SVCT2 were
upregulated by MCAO/Re in the nondiabetic rats, but not in the diabetic rats. In agreement with the
results from the mRNA measurement, quantification of the immunofluorescence revealed that the
expression levels of SVCT2 immunoreactivity were significantly increased in response to MCAO/Re
both in the nondiabetic control and AA-supplemented nondiabetic groups (Figure 9C). This reaction
against MCAO/Re was abrogated in the diabetic control group, whereas the AA-supplemented diabetic
rats showed an increased expression of SVCT2 in the cortex after MCAO/Re.

On the other hand, GLUT1 immunoreactivity was predominantly colocalized with RECA1
(Figure 9D). Some of the cells exhibiting NeuN showed a weak GLUT1-immunoreactivity (data not
shown). In the sham-operated nondiabetic and diabetic groups with AA supplementation, the expression
levels of GLUT1 in the capillary endothelial cells were remarkably upregulated. Additionally,
MCAO/Re showed a stimulating effect on the GLUT1 expression both in the nondiabetic and diabetic
cortex. Quantitative analyses of immunofluorescence in the sections revealed that the sham-operated
diabetic control rat cortex had a lower expression level of GLUT1 compared with the nondiabetic rat
cortex, and AA supplementation or MCAO/Re caused a significant increase in the expression of
GLUT1 (Figure 9E).

3.7. Total AA Levels in the Plasma and Cortex
To determine whether the changes in expression levels of SVCT2 and GLUT1 induced by AA
supplementation or by MCAO/Re affect the concentrations of AA in the cortex, we measured total AA
(AA + DHA) levels in the plasma and cortex of the experimental groups (Figure 10). It has been
indicated that reduction of DHA to AA or decomposition of DHA to 2,3-diketo-1-gulonic acid is rapid
in the plasma and brain, and that the concentrations of DHA in these tissues are 0%–2% of AA [19].
Therefore, total AA levels are considered to almost equal to the AA levels. The plasma of the
sham-operated diabetic control rats had a significant smaller amount of total AA levels compared with
the nondiabetic rats (Figure 10A). AA supplementation restored the decrement of the total AA levels
in the diabetic rats to almost the same levels as those in the nondiabetic control rats. MCAO/Re had
little effect on the total AA levels in the plasma of all groups. In contrast, neither diabetic state nor AA
supplementation affected the total AA levels in the cortex of sham-operated groups. MCAO/Re
significantly decreased the total AA levels both in the nondiabetic and diabetic cortex. AA
supplementation to the diabetic rats caused a significant increase in the total AA levels in the cortex in
response to MCAO/Re.

4. Discussion
The present study confirmed that the STZ-evoked diabetic state aggravates neuronal damage caused
by a transient cerebral ischemia and subsequent reperfusion in rats. We found that diabetes enhances
the production of O2−, activates caspase-3, and induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines
(TNF-α and IL-1β) in the brain. These detrimental effects are markedly potentiated by cerebral
ischemia and reperfusion, leading to greater infarct growth and aggravation of apoptosis and
inflammation. Our results show that chronic supplementation with AA inhibits the apoptotic changes
and proinflammatory responses, and attenuates the exacerbation of cerebral injury and neurological
deficits in the diabetic state. These beneficial effects of AA could be attributed to its antioxidant and

Nutrients 2014, 6

1571

anti-inflammatory properties. We observed that the expression level of SVCT2 increases in response to
MCAO/Re in the nondiabetic cortex, which is accompanied by an increase in the total AA (AA + DHA)
in the tissues, and that these responses are abolished in the diabetic rats. AA supplementation to the
diabetic rats restored these responses to the levels of the nondiabetic rats. Therefore, supplementation
with AA may enhance the transport of AA into neuronal cells, resulting in reinforcement of the
antioxidant defense and alleviation of oxidative ischemic injury in the brain of diabetic rats.
Because rats can synthesize their own AA, unlike humans, they seem to hardly suffer from low
levels of internal AA [19]. However, there is experimental evidence that STZ-induced type 1 diabetic
rats have low levels of AA in the plasma, liver, kidney, and other tissues [23,34,35]. It is conceivable
that the enhanced oxidative stress in diabetes consumes the circulating AA and that the resulting
diminution in the AA concentration leads to further enhancement of the reactions mediated by free
radicals. This study indicates that the diabetic rats have low levels of AA in the plasma, and that
chronic oral pretreatment with AA in diabetic rats decreases the cerebral O2− generation, apoptosis,
and infarction induced by MCAO/Re; all of these effects could be a result of improved antioxidant
status in the diabetic brain. Indeed, we observed that AA supplementation to the diabetic rats prevents
the diminution of the total AA levels in the cortex associated with ischemia-reperfusion. On the other
hand, we found that AA supplementation causes insufficient downregulation of proinflammatory
cytokines and has no effect on MPO expression in diabetic rats after MCAO/Re. The relative low dose
of AA (100 mg/kg) which we used in this study might not be efficacious against the severe
inflammatory responses induced by the combination of stroke and diabetes.
Concentrations of AA in plasma and peripheral extracellular fluid after ingestion are strictly
controlled by intestinal absorption, tissue transport, and renal excretion. Chen et al. [36] shows that
orally administrated AA at doses >200 mg/kg is declined to ≈60 μM in plasma and extracellular fluid
of femoral muscle in rats. In the brain, concentration of AA is relatively high compared with that in the
plasma [24]. Two mechanisms of AA recruitment into the brain are known: the transport of AA
through SVCT2, a specific transporter for AA, and the transport of DHA across the BBB through
GLUT1 with subsequent immediate reduction in the brain. The gradation of AA concentrations
between the plasma and the CNS is thought to be maintained by SVCT2, because AA is mainly
present in the reduced form in the plasma. On the other hand, the cerebroprotective effects of AA
supplementation remain controversial, whereas beneficial effects of DHA administration for neuronal
oxidative stress and inflammation seem to be well established [37–39]. Previous studies do not support
acute cerebroprotective effects of treatment with AA under normal conditions because AA is not
transported into the brain rapidly, owing to the high affinity and low ability for AA transport by
SVCT2. Ahn and colleagues [40] reported that chronic AA supplementation has little or no effect on
elevated oxidative stress in STZ-induced diabetic brain, whereas it is efficacious in the liver and
kidneys. This phenomenon can be attributed to a lack of SVCT2 expression in endothelial cells of the
BBB [41,42]. Recently, the evidence indicating that AA supplementation suppresses diabetes or
ischemia-induced oxidative damage in the hippocampus and cortex of experimental animals has been
accumulated [43–45]. These regions are not only vulnerable to oxidative stress but abundant in SVCT2
compared to other regions in the brain, namely, there may be some kinds of differences in sensitivity
for AA supplementation depending on brain regions. Therefore, it seems possible that previous

Nutrients 2014, 6

1572

experiments using whole-brain samples might have not been adequate to detect the cerebroprotective
effects of AA supplementation.
The system of DHA transport through GLUT1 in the BBB may not substantially contribute to total
brain AA concentrations under normal conditions, because DHA concentrations in the plasma are
usually only 0%–2% of AA concentrations [19,46]. Nonetheless, during oxidative stress in the CNS
such as stroke and/or treatment with DHA, this route could play a significant role in the recruitment of
AA [39,47]. Our study demonstrated that diabetes downregulates the expression of GLUT1 in the
cortex, in line with previous studies [21,25]. AA supplementation to the diabetic rats markedly
upregulated the basal expression of GLUT1; however, it exerted no significant increase in the total AA
levels in the cortex of the rats. Taken together, contribution of the DHA transport system through
GLUT1 to the cerebroprotection seems to be limited in the diabetic rats. The upregulation of GLUT1
expression by AA supplementation was observed also in the cortex of nondiabetic sham-operated
group, despite that there were little changes in the total AA levels in the plasma of the rats. These
results may indicate that orally supplemented AA has no direct enhancing effect on the expression of
GLUT1 in the nondiabetic rats. However, AA concentration in the plasma is considered to increase
within several hours after oral administration and decline to the basal level 24 h after the administration
by excretion of the excess of AA, at which we collected the plasma samples from the experimental
animals. Therefore, one possibility is that intermittent increases in AA concentration in the plasma
repeated for two weeks could stimulate expression of GLUT1 in the cortex. Future research needs to
be done with regard to the detailed mechanism underlying the upregulation of GLUT1 expression by
AA supplementation.
SVCT2 has been shown to be crucial for maintaining AA for protection against oxidative stress in
the CNS. It has been shown that cultured cells lacking this protein are vulnerable to oxidative
stress [18]. In the present study, diabetes itself caused no apparent changes in the expression of SVCT2
in the cortex. On the other hand, after MCAO/Re, the expression of SVCT2 in the penumbral cortex,
of which the majority seems to be localized in neurons, is upregulated in the nondiabetic rats. Gess and
colleagues [20] have demonstrated that SVCT2 is specifically expressed in brain capillary endothelial
cells and transports AA across the BBB during the subacute phase after MCAO/Re in mice. We also
observed that expression levels of SVCT2 in capillary endothelial cells are increased after MCAO/Re
in the nondiabetic rat cortex. This has been proposed as one of the mechanisms that protect the brain
against oxidative injury under pathological conditions such as stroke and neurodegeneration. In contrast,
we found that the upregulation of SVCT2 expression was abrogated in the diabetic rats, suggesting that
the cerebroprotective mechanism via AA recruitment may be disrupted in the diabetic state. The
abnormality of endothelial cell function in STZ-diabetic rats has been indicated to be related to the
ROS generation in microvascular walls [17]. Seno and coworkers [48] demonstrated that the inflammatory
cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β suppress the transport of AA through SVCT2 in human umbilical vein
endothelial cells. Indeed, we detected a robust increase in the expression these cytokines in the brain of
diabetic rats after MCAO/Re, which may reverse the upregulation of SVCT2 by MCAO/Re itself. AA
supplementation to the diabetic rats upregulated the expression of SVCT2 in the cortex and restored
the total AA levels to the nondiabetic levels. The antioxidative properties of AA may protect
endothelial functions including the transcriptional regulation of SVCT2 against the exacerbated
ischemic oxidative injury and the enhanced proinflammatory responses in the diabetic state, and may

Nutrients 2014, 6

1573

improve AA transport through SVCT2 in the BBB. Further experiments using radiolabeled tracers or
other rodent models such as SVCT2+/− mice are needed to elucidate these cerebroprotective
mechanisms of AA, including its effects on the specific transport of AA into the diabetic brain.
5. Conclusions
In the present study, we found that chronic AA supplementation inhibits the apoptotic and
proinflammatory changes and attenuates the exacerbation of cerebral injury and neurological deficits
in the diabetic state. These phenomena could be attributed to the antioxidant activity and
anti-inflammatory effects of AA. Diabetes repressed the enhancement of SVCT2 expression induced
by ischemia-reperfusion in the neurons and capillary endothelial cells, whereas the downregulated
expression of SVCT2 was restored to control levels by AA supplementation. Therefore, chronic AA
supplementation may enhance and normalize the transport of AA into the CNS and may thus reinforce
the antioxidant defense and alleviate oxidative ischemic injury in the brain of diabetic rats.
