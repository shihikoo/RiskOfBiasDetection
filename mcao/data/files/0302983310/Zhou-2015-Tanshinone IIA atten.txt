Stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide
and can also be a source of permanent disability in
survivors. Cerebral ischemic stroke accounts for
approximately 80% of all strokes (Feigin et al., 2003;
Donnan et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2012). The most
common cause of ischemic stroke is the occlusion of a
blood vessel by a thrombus, resulting in an immediate
loss of the normal supply of oxygen and glucose to cerebral tissue (Genoverse et al., 2011). A variety of therapeutic strategies are currently being considered as a means
of minimizing the neuronal damage resulting from
ischemia, leading to increasing study of the pathological
mechanisms underlying stroke.
The diterpenoid Tanshinone IIA (TSA) is an important
component of Chinese medicine, made from the dried
rhizome of danshen, Salvia miltiorrhiza. This herb is
traditionally used for the treatment of cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular diseases, including ischemic stroke
(Yang et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2009). TSA is a derivative
of phenanthrenequinone;1,6,6-trimethyl-8,9-dihydro-7Hnaphtho[8,7-g][1]benzoxole-10,11-dione (Fig. 1). Many
plant-derived terpenoids have been found to possess
anti-inﬂammatory and anti-neoplastic properties, and
TSA has been reported to modulate many kinds of biological activities, including the quenching of reactive oxygen
species, and antagonism of calcium-promoted events.
Such molecular changes may account for the ability of
TSA to promote microcirculatory function, inhibit neutrophil migration, and exert anti-tumor eﬀects (Han et al.,
2008). TSA is able to traverse the blood-brain barrier
although the brain content is limited to 30% of the plasma
concentration (Chen et al., 2007), and this could relate to
its eﬀects in reducing the volume of cerebral infarction
and maintenance of neuronal function (Lam et al.,
2003). TSA has been shown to have protective eﬀects
against focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in
animal models (Tang et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010) and
has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent in
heart disease, liver disease and cancer treatment (Dai
et al., 2012).
The present study was intended to evaluate the
potentially protective eﬀects of TSA in a stroke model
and illuminate on the mechanisms that could underlie
this. A suture-occlusion method was used to block the
middle cerebral artery, followed by release of the block
thus initiating reperfusion. Levels of the pro-inﬂammatory

Abstract—Tanshinone IIA (TSA) is a lipid soluble agent
derived from the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen). This
plant is a traditional Chinese herb, which has been used
widely in China especially for enhancing circulation. However
mechanisms underlying its eﬃcacy remain poorly understood. The present study was designed to illuminate events
that may underlie the apparently neuroprotective eﬀects of
TSA following ischemic insult. Adult Sprague–Dawley rats
were subjected to transient focal cerebral ischemia by use
of a middle cerebral artery occlusion model. They were then
randomly divided into a sham-operated control group, and
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion groups receiving a two-hour
occlusion. Further subsets of groups received the same durations of occlusion or were sham-operated but then received
daily i.p. injections of high or low doses of TSA, for seven
or 15 days. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed lesions
in the entorhinal cortex of both rats subject to ischemia and
to a lesser extent to those receiving TSA after surgery. Levels
of glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP), caspase-3 and caspase-8, were quantiﬁed by both immunohistochemistry and
Western blotting. TSA treatment after middle cerebral artery
occlusion, markedly reduced infarct size, and reduced the
expression of caspase-3 and caspase-8. These changes were
considered protective and were generally proportional to the
dose of TSA used. These results suggest that TSA may eﬀect
neuroprotection by way of reduction of the extent of
cell inﬂammation and death within aﬀected regions.

indicators such as glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
were increased after I/R together with levels of two
caspases associated with apoptosis; caspase-3 and
capsase-8. Treatment with TSA after the surgical
procedure partially reversed all of the changes caused
by I/R. This provides a mechanistic basis accounting for
the utility of TSA on the treatment of stroke.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Materials

37 °C throughout the whole surgical procedure. The operation of was carried out with all eﬀorts to minimize animal
suﬀering.
This transient medial carotid artery occlusion caused
measurable neurological deﬁcits. We used Longa and
Bederson’s 5-point scale within 24 h after recovery from
anesthetic to judge whether the surgery was successful.
The scoring system was as follows: 0, no deﬁcit; 1, ﬂexion
of the contralateral torso and forelimb when held by the
tail; 2, circling to aﬀected side; 3, leaning to aﬀected side;
4, no spontaneous locomotor activity or barrel rolling. Any
animal without deﬁcit in the intra-ischemic period was
excluded from the study (Li et al., 2010).

TSA was purchased from Jiangsu Carefree Pharmaceutical
Co., Ltd (Jiangsu, China). Male Sprague–Dawley rats
weighing 220–280 g were obtained from the Department
of Medical Experimental Animal Center of Xiang-ya
School of Medicine, Central South University. Rats were
housed in groups of eight each, with food and water
supplied ad libitum, and were maintained on a 12-h light/
dark cycle. The rats were kept under standardized
temperature, humidity and light conditions with free
access to food and water. All experimental protocols and
animal handling procedures were approved in advance by
the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Xiang-ya
School of Medicine (Central South University) and were
consistent with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Sixty-four rats were randomized into eight groups (n = 8
for each group): Sham (control) animals were subjected
to surgical procedures without artery occlusion shock
and treated with a daily i.p. injection of physiological
saline for seven or 15 days. I/R-operated rats were
subjected to artery occlusion for 2 h followed by
reperfusion. They then received daily i.p. injections of
saline for seven or 15 days respectively. I/R-operated
rats were subsequently treated with a low dose (4 mg/
kg/day i.p.) or a high dose of TSA (8 mg/kg/day).

The middle cerebral artery occlusion model

Brain sample preparations

Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion in the right hemisphere
(Genoverse et al., 2011). Rats were anesthetized with
10% chloral hydrate (350 ml/kg, administered i.p. in
0.3 ml saline). The surgery to occlude the medial carotid
artery consisted of the insertion of a 4–0 nylon ﬁlament
(Beijing Shadong Biology Company, Beijing, China; diameter 0.26 mm) precoated with a hardener with diameter
0.34 mm, via the external carotid artery into the internal
carotid artery to block the inﬂow of blood into the medial
carotid artery according to the procedure originally
described by Longa et al. (1989) and modiﬁed by Melani
et al. (1999). After 2 h of ischemia, the nylon ﬁlament
was carefully pulled out to establish reperfusion. Shamoperated (control) rats underwent the same surgical procedures without occlusion of the common carotid arteries.
Rectal temperature was recorded and maintained at

After the experiments were completed, rats were deeply
anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (350 ml/kg), and
the heart was exposed to perfuse transcardially with
cold 0.1 M phosphate-buﬀered saline PH 7.4 through
the left ventricle. After dissection one half of the brain
was immediately frozen at 80 °C in a refrigerator (for
Western blotting) and the other half ﬁxed in 4%
paraformaldehyde overnight (for immunohistochemistry
and hematoxylin-eosin staining). Thereafter, ﬁxed tissue
was transferred into PBS/0.02% Na azide at 4 °C until
use. Afterward, the ﬁxed brain tissues were further
processed by dehydration in graded ethanol prior to
paraﬃn embedding. Finally, the blocks were coronally
cut in serial 5-lm-thick sections and stored at 4 °C
before being stained.

Study design in animal models

Hematoxylin-eosin staining and
immunohistochemistry
After deparaﬃnization, sections were washed in double
distilled water for 10 min, and were incubated in
hematoxylin, then treated with 0.2% hydrochloric acid.
Subsequently, eosin red was used in a 2-min
incubation, and this was followed by ﬁxation in 95%
alcohol.
Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraﬃnembedded sections. After deparaﬃnization, sections
were permeabilized within antigen unmasking solution
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 20 min
with 80 °C. Endogenous peroxidase in issues was
quenched with hydrogen peroxide for 5 min. Non-speciﬁc
adsorption was minimized by incubating the sections in
2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) with 0.3% Triton X-100

107

for 40–60 min. Then sections were incubated with antiGFAP rabbit polyclonal antibody 1:500 in phosphate
buﬀered saline (PBS) (DAKO, Troy, MI, USA), anticaspase 3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA, 1:500 in PBS), anti-caspase 8
rabbit polyclonal antibody 1:50 in PBS (Abcam,)
overnight at 4 °C. Sections were then immersed in PBS
with 0.1% Triton-X and incubated with secondary
antibody (1:400, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA,
USA) for 2 h. In order to amplify the sensitivity and
speciﬁcity of biological response, an avidin–biotin
complex marked with enzyme (ABC), was used as a
secondary marker antibody. Reaction product was
detected with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride,
DAB (Vector). Sections were processed by dehydration
in graded ethanol, cleared with xylene, and then
coverslipped with distrene, plasticiser, xylene mountant
(DPX) (Biomedical Specialties, Miami Lakes, FL, USA).
Some sections were incubated with the primary antibody
alone or with the secondary antibody alone. In this
manner the immunoreaction in all experiments was
conﬁrmed to be speciﬁc to the target protein.
Western blotting
Samples of the cortex prepared from fresh frozen brain
tissue were homogenized in 10 volumes and extracted
with ice-cold tris-buﬀered saline (20 mM Tris–HCl buﬀer
PH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) (0.150 g tissue/2 ml buﬀer) with
0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride and a protease
inhibitor cocktail from Sigma. Homogenates were
centrifuged at 12,000g (10 min, 4 °C) so that the
supernatant was collected, and then the protein
concentration measured with BCA protein assay
(Novagen Inc., Madison, WI, USA). Samples (30–60 lg
protein/well) were separated in 10% SDS–PAGE gel and
transferred to a polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (Amersham
Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) membrane (300 mA
for 1.5 h). The membrane was incubated with 5% non-fat
dried milk (PM) for 40–60 min and subsequently probed
with GFAP (1:3000, DAKO, Troy, MI, USA), caspase-3,
1:1000 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), caspase-8
(1:200, Abcam), at 4 °C overnight. After washing, blots
were incubated with the corresponding HRP-labeled
secondary antibodies 1:3000 dilution (Jackson Labs, Bar
Harbor, ME, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. To
ascertain that blots were loaded with equal amounts of
protein lysates, they were incubated in the presence of
the antibody against b-actin 1:1000 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology,
Santa
Cruz
CA,
USA).
Chemiluminescence was detected with ECL Plus
substrate kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) by Image
Quant 350 (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK).
Image and statistical analysis
Immunostaining was quantiﬁed using a Nikon Eclipse 80i
microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and images acquired
with a Nikon DS high-resolution digital color camera
(1280  1024 pixel) using NIS-Elements AR 3.0 software.
Digital images were analyzed using Ver.3.00 analysis
program (Nikon). The percentage of immunostained area

(ﬁeld area of immunostaining/total image area  100)
was determined for all the markers studied by averaging
several images per section that cover all or most of the
region of study. Western blot bands were analyzed by
Image J software. All experiments were repeated at least
twice, with n = 6–8 animals per group per marker. All
quantitative comparisons were performed on sections
processed at the same time. Single ANOVA statistical
analysis was used to assess the signiﬁcance of the
diﬀerences in anti-GFAP, anti-caspase-3, anti-caspase-8,
among the animal groups. A two-tailed P-value of less
than 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. All statistical
analyses were carried out without knowledge of the
treatments (Impellizzeri et al., 2011).

RESULTS
The consequence of ischemic injury on a variety of
relevant parameters was studied together with the
outcome of daily treatment with TSA following surgery
for seven or 15 days. It was found that all values
obtained after TSA treatment following sham surgery,
did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the corresponding values
following sham surgery alone. Thus, in order to simplify
the ﬁgures these results are not shown.
Hematoxylin-eosin staining
The cerebral infarction caused by I/R was examined in
brain slices stained with hematoxylin-eosin (Fig. 2).
Sections from the control group had normally staining
brain tissue (Fig. 2A, E), whereas the I/R treatment
groups had a paler less stained region reﬂecting the
area of ischemic damage in the infarcted area (Fig. 2B, F).
Treatment with TSA resulted in an incomplete reversal
of the loss of staining in the infarcted area. The infarct
volume (white area) was attenuated in these groups.
This was marginal in the group receiving the lower dose
of TSA for 7 days (Fig. 2C), and especially pronounced
in the group receiving the higher dose of TSA for
15 days (Fig. 2H) suggesting a dose- and timeresponse restorative relationship.
Levels of GFAP in the cortex
Immunohistochemical staining for GFAP revealed that I/R
treatment led to a signiﬁcant and sustained increase in
GFAP levels in the injured cortex relative to controls
(Fig. 3A). GFAP and CD11b levels were quantitatively
conﬁrmed by densitometric analysis (Fig. 3B) and
conﬁrmed by Western blotting of homogenates
(Fig. 3C–F). The eﬀect of repeated treatment with TSA
after surgery led to a pronounced attenuation of GFAP
content. There was a clear dose–response relationship
in that the eﬀect of the higher dose of TSA was greater
than that of the low dose.
Caspase content
I/R groups exhibited higher expression of caspase-3 and
caspase-8 than sham groups as judged by
immunohistochemistry (Figs. 4 and 5A, B) and this was
conﬁrmed by parallel quantiﬁcation made with Western

control group; #P < 0.05 also diﬀers from the corresponding high-dose TSA-treated group.

blotting (Figs. 4 and 5C, D). The increase in caspase
levels caused by I/R was around 10-fold. The eﬀect of
TSA treatment on the content of caspases-3 and -8 was
to partially reverse the increase of both caspases
caused by I/R. This reduction was around 50% and was
apparent using either of the quantitative caspase
assays. A clear dose–response relation between high
and low amounts of TSA was only observed for
caspase-3 in the group treated with TSA for 15 days.

DISCUSSION
Middle cerebral artery occlusion is a generally accepted
model of cerebral ischemia (Hoﬀman et al., 2006). The
ﬁndings presented suggest that indices of apoptosis in
the rat brain induced by I/R can be considerably reduced
(but not totally prevented) by TSA.
The reduction of GFAP content after TSA treatment,
further indicated that TSA can mitigate the inﬂammation

and impairments in metabolism induced by I/R.
Astrocytes, the most abundant population of glial cells
that constitute the microenvironment of the central
nervous system (Liu et al., 2012), are intimately associ-

ated with the brain homeostasis and maintenance of brain
function. While astrocytes are signiﬁcant in eﬀects repair
processes in the CNS, excessive prolongation of their
activation is known to lead to undesirable inﬂammatory

110

outcomes (Sun et al., 2012). Since GFAP is a marker of
astrocytic reactivity our ﬁndings suggest that TSA may
owe some of its neuroprotective eﬀects in ischemic
regions by restoring the resting condition of astrocytes.
A substantial body of evidence suggests that
apoptosis after cerebral I/R injury is a major pathway
leading to cell death (Faruk et al., 2010). After
transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery
followed by reperfusion, the number of apoptotic cells
in the striatum and cortex of rats was directly
proportional to the duration of ischemia (Raﬀ et al.,
1993). The mechanism of apoptosis involves a signal
transduction process by which intracellular protein is
degraded by a family of cysteine-dependent aspartatedirected proteases (caspases). The caspases, central
regulators of apoptosis, have been demonstrated to
play a key role in ischemia-induced cytotoxicity in vivo
and in vitro (Lee et al., 2007; Bi et al., 2008;
Shimmyo et al., 2008). Based on their function, caspases are classiﬁed into two groups, initiator caspases
such as caspase-8, and eﬀector caspases such as caspase-3. Generally, the initiator caspases activate downstream eﬀector caspases by a proteolytic cascade,
resulting in the cleavage of a variety of cellular
substrates involved in apoptosis (Liu et al., 2011a).
Caspase-3 can be activated by upstream initiator caspases such as caspase-8 through two distinct pathways,
i.e., the death receptor-mediated extrinsic caspase-8
pathway or the mitochondria dependent-cytochrome
c/caspase-9 intrinsic pathway, respectively (Hu and
Kavanagh, 2003). Caspase-3 has been shown to be
up-regulated and activated in ischemic brain tissue
(Rami et al., 2003), and genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of caspase-3 leads to reduced neuronal
death in the ischemic brain (Le et al., 2002). The protective eﬀect of neuronal deletion of caspase-8 has also
been shown following impact injury to the brain. Such
deletion led to reductions in lesion size, the extent of
neuronal cell death and less activation of caspase-3.
Behaviorally impacted animals with deletion of the
caspase-8 gene had a lower neuropathological score,
better learning performance, superior retention of spatial
memory
and
improved
sensorimotor
function
(Krajewska et al., 2011). Caspase-3 activity increased
when myocardial cells were treated with angiotensin II
and TSA greatly inhibited this elevation (Hong et al.,
2010). Apoptosis of cultured myocardial cells has also
been reported to be blocked by TSA and this was attributed to inhibition of caspase-3 activity (Jin et al., 2013).
Our ﬁnding parallels these reports in that levels of caspases in the brain tissue were signiﬁcantly increased
when rats were subjected to I/R, and that TSA treatment greatly reduced the magnitude of this increase.
The results presented here show that TSA inhibited
ischemia-induced cell death in the entorhinal cortex.
This ﬁnding parallels that of a study using prostatic cancer cells, where TSA also had an anti-apoptic eﬀect
(Won et al., 2010). Since many neurodegenerative diseases involve cell death and inappropriately elevated
levels of immune activity, it is likely that an agent such
as TSA with anti-inﬂammatory and anti-apoptic proper-

ties, will also ﬁnd application in the treatment of a
broader range of age-related diseases of the nervous
system. For example, a protective eﬀect of TSA has
been reported in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease
(Yin et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2014).
In animals subjected to I/R and not treated with TSA,
the indices of damage were generally lower 15 days after
surgery than after 7 days. Thus the eﬀect of TSA may be
to improve or accelerate any intrinsic recovery possible
after a serious I/R insult.

CONCLUSIONS
The present study found that TSA protects nerve cells from
I/R-induced apoptosis. This neuroprotective eﬀect appears
to involve several processes, including suppression of
excess activation of glial cells, and inhibiting the activities
of caspase-3 and caspase-8. The initial cellular site of
TSA action, which can lead to a sequence of protective
events, remains to be determined. Furthermore other
properties of TSA such as its ability to inhibit platelet
aggregation (Liu et al., 2011b) may also contribute to its
reputed eﬀectiveness in stroke treatment.
It is noteworthy that, since TSA was eﬀective when
administered after the induced lesion, this allows its
consideration as a therapeutic drug. TSA seems to be
an appropriate candidate for the treatment of stroke or
other apoptosis-related brain diseases. Further studies
are needed in order to form a strong basis for human
clinical trials.
