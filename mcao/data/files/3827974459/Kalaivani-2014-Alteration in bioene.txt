The present study was undertaken to identify the time-dependent changes in bioenergetic regulators and oxidative stress markers levels and also to ascertain which
occurs early in focal cerebral ischemia. The status of bioenergetic regulators (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, Silent information regulator Transporter 1 (SirT1) and
Poly adenosine diphosphate - ribose polymerase 1 (Parp1)) and oxidative stress
markers’ (lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide) levels along with excitatory neurochemical glutamate, neuronal nuclei (NeuN), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),
and caspase 3 at various durations of reperfusion viz 0, 1, 6, 24, 72, and 166 hours
was investigated in rats subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion.
Six hours after reperfusion, a significant downregulation in SirT1 and upregulation
in Parp1 expressions were observed in striatal region of ischemic–reperfused rats
compared with ischemic rats. Peak elevation in glutamate content was recorded at
72 hours, and maximum level of lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide contents were
observed at 166 hours. A significant decrease in NeuN and increase in GFAPpositive cells were observed at 24 and 72 hours, respectively, in cortical, striatal,
and hippocampal regions. These data reveal that change in bioenergetic regulators
occurs earlier than excitotoxicity and oxidative stress in cerebral stroke. From the
data, it can also be inferred that appropriate therapeutic intervention, that is, bioenergetic modulators at early period and either glutamatergic and/or antioxidant therapy at delayed period may yield a better therapeutic outcome. Key Words: SirT1—
Parp1—bioenergetics—oxidative stress—focal cerebral ischemia.

Glucose and oxygen being the primary metabolic substrates of brain, focal impairment of blood flow restricts
the transport of these substrates, which leads to ionic imbalances and neuronal depolarization. Overactivation of
the glutamate receptors causes the release of Ca21 and
Na1 ions into the synapse leading to edema. Increased
adenosine triphosphate consumption in excitotoxicity
state results in depletion of intracellular nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD1) and SirT1.1-4 NAD1
depletion activates Parp1, which induces massive
poly(ADP-ribose) polyadenosine diphosphate ribose
polymer accumulation.5-7 In addition, increased
intracellular Ca21 promotes mitochondrial permeability,

which triggers the generation of free radicals and
apoptosis.8
Bioenergetic regulators such as SirT1 and Parp1 are
NAD1 dependent enzymes that play a vital role in many
cellular events; in particular, they act as decision makers
in oxidative stress-induced cell death.9 Increased Parp1 activities have been observed in ischemic (ISC) brains10 and
also in animal models of stroke.11,12 Studies have
demonstrated that imbalance in Parp1 expression in the
absence of SirT1 results in apoptotic neuronal death.13-15
These reports demonstrate a relation between bioenergetics, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress, which culminates to neurodegeneration in cerebral stroke. The
complex pathophysiology and unclear sequence of events
in stroke complicate the employment of appropriate therapeutic intervention. Hence, understanding the distinct
and sequential pathophysiologic events involved in neurodegeneration is mandatory for a better therapeutic
outcome. The present study was intended to identify
the time-dependent inflection in bioenergetic modulators
and oxidative stress and to determine the sequence of
events in focal cerebral ischemia in rat model.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Reagents
NAD1 was purchased from M/s. Sisco Research Laboratories, Mumbai, India. Nylon monofilament Ethicon
(4-0) was procured locally in Chennai. Butylated hydroxyl
toluene, N-(1-Naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride, thiobarbituric acid, and sulphanilamide were obtained from M/s. HiMedia laboratories, Mumbai, India.
Cresyl violet, chymostatin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and
phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride were procured from
Sigma, St Louis. MO. Primary antibodies such as SirT1,
Parp1, caspase 3, and b-actin were purchased from Santa
Cruz, CA. 5-bromo-4-choloro-3’- indolylphosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) substrate for alkaline
phosphatase kit was obtained from Genei, Bangalore,
India. Mouse anti–glial fibrillary acidic protein (antiGFAP) was procured from Cell signaling (Beverly,

fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antimouse
IgG, tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated
goat antimouse IgG, and QIA39 FragEL DNA Fragmentation Detection Kit were purchased from Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany). All other chemicals, reagents, and
solvents unless specified were of analytical grade.

Animals, Husbandry, and Ethics Approval
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (270-320 g birth weight)
were obtained from the Central Animal Facility, Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai. Animals were housed
individually in polypropylene cages in a well-ventilated
room (air cycle, 15 changes/hour; recycle ratio, 55:45) un-

der an ambient temperature of 22 6 3 C and 30%-70%
relative humidity, with an artificial photoperiod of 12
hours light/dark cycle. They were provided with standard rodent pellet diet (M/s. Provimi Animal Nutrition
Pvt Ltd, Bangalore, India) and purified water ad libitum
(RIOS, Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA). All the animals
were acclimatized for a period of 7 days to the laboratory
conditions before initiation of the study. Guidelines of
‘‘Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals’’
(Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Academic Press 1996; National Institutes of Health publication number #85-23, revised 1996) were strictly followed
throughout the study. Institutional Animal Ethical Committee (IAEC), Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, India approved the study (IAEC/XIX/SRU/145/2010).

Surgical Procedure
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral
artery occlusion procedure as described by Longa et al16
with minor modifications. Rats were anaesthetized with
chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), and right
common carotid artery was exposed to the level of external
and internal carotid artery bifurcation. Nylon monofilament (4-0) was used, and its tip was made round headed
by exposing it to flame. The filament was coated with
.01% poly-l-lysine and inserted into the external carotid artery and advanced to the internal carotid artery for a length
of about 20-21 mm until a slight resistance was felt. After occlusion, the filament was held in place with a ligature, and
skin was temporarily sutured. After 2 hours of ischemia,
the rats were anesthetized, suture was released, and the
filament was withdrawn to establish reperfusion that was
visually ensured. Throughout the surgical procedure,
body temperature was monitored by inserting a rectal thermometric probe and maintained at 37 6 1 C by a thermostatically controlled heating blanket. Animals were then
housed in a cage with heating lamp to maintain the temperature at 29 6 1 C for another 1 hour to counteract any
possible hypothermic effect. In the sham-operated group,
external carotid artery was surgically prepared for insertion of filament, but the filament was not inserted. Postoperative care was provided to all the experimental animals
following Centre for Toxicology and Developmental
Research standard operating procedures.

Experimental Design
The experimental animals were divided into 7 groups.
Group I: Sham operated.
Group II: 2 hours ISC 1 0 hours reperfusion.
Group III-VII: 2 hours ISC 1 1, 6, 24, 72, and 166 hours
of reperfusion, respectively.
All the rats were euthanized at the end of experimental
period, and the ipsilateral striatal region (it is the most
vulnerable structure compared with other brain structures based on our laboratory experience) was identified

ALTERATIONS IN SIRT1 AND PARP1 PRECEDES OXIDATIVE STRESS IN IR RATS

and excised out quickly over an ice-cold plate using Paxinos et al17 brain atlas as reference and stored at 280 C till
further biochemical analysis.

Assessment of Neurologic Deficit
An evaluator blinded to experimental design performed the procedure.18 Animals from group I, V, VI,
and VII were subjected to neurologic scoring: score 0—
no apparent neurologic deficits; score 1—contralateral
forelimb flexion; score 2—decreased resistance to lateral
push; score 3—spontaneous movement in all directions
and contralateral circling when pulled by tail; and score
4—spontaneous circling.

(14,000 g, 4 C, 5 minutes), supernatants were neutralized
with 1 N sodium hydroxide and stored at 280 C until
taken for analysis. NAD1 level in supernatants were quantified using a reversed phase high performance liquid
chromatography (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Reversed
phase high performance liquid chromatography determination was performed on a reversed phase Hypersil C18
(4.6 mm 3 250 mm, 5 m) column (Elite, Dalian, China)
attached to 2 LC-10ATvp pumps (Shimadzu, Kyoto,
Japan), equipped with UV/visible detector. The mobile
phase was 100 mM KH2PO4–K2HPO4 buffer solution
(pH 6.0), the flow rate was 1.2 mL/minute, the column
temperature was 25 C, and the detection wavelength
was 254 nm. Reference solution of NAD1 was used and
prepared for calibration (Sigma, St Louis, MO).

Western Blot Analysis
Ipsilateral striatal tissue was homogenized in lysis
buffer containing .1 M sodium chloride, .01 M Tris buffer,
and .1 mM ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid, and
the protease inhibitors such as chymostatin 2 mg/mL, leupeptin 2 mg/mL, pepstatin 2 mg/mL, and phenyl methyl
sulfonyl fluoride 100 mg/mL. Lysates were centrifuged at
14,000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4 C and boiled in loading
buffer for 3 minutes; 50 mg of protein samples were loaded
on a 12% sodium lauryl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel,
separated electrophoretically, and transferred to a Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp) using
Semi-Dry Transfer Unit (Hoefer, Holliston, MA). The
transferred membrane was incubated overnight in 5%
skimmed milk powder and then washed with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) with tween 20 for 3-5 times. A total
of 10 mL of the primary antibody against b-actin, SirT1,
Parp1, and caspase 3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc,
Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:500 dilution was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. After incubation,
it was washed 3 times in PBS containing .1% Tween 20,
the secondary antibody (NBT/BCIP; Biogenei, Bangalore,
India) was then added at 1:2000 dilution for 1 hour. The
blot was then washed in PBS containing .1% Tween 20
for 3 times over 25 minutes and then incubated in substrate buffer containing 4 M sodium chloride, 1 M magnesium chloride, and 1 M Tris buffer. After 10 minutes
incubation, the membrane was incubated in dark with
chromogen solution. The bands viewed were photographed and semiquantified by densitometry using Bio
ID software in gel documentation unit (Vilber Lourmat,
Marne-la-Vallee, France).

Bioenergetic NAD1 Analysis
Striatal tissue was homogenized with 10% KCl in
manual homogenizer and used for the estimation of
NAD1 level as described previously Zhan et al19 with
slight modifications. Aliquots of homogenates were sonicated immediately in ice cooled perchloric acid (.1 N) to
inactivate adenosine triphosphatases. After centrifugation

Neurochemical Glutamate Estimation
Striatal tissues were homogenized in .1 N hydrochloric
acid in 80% ethanol (for every 10 mg tissue/200 mL) in
manual homogenizer.20 Homogenates were transferred to
polypropylene tubes and centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 20 minutes. Glutamate content in the supernatant was estimated
using high performance thin-layer liquid chromatography
(HPTLC; CAMAG (Mumbai, India)–version 1.3.4).

Oxidative Stress Markers
Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances Content
Lipid peroxidation was measured in terms of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) content by Ohkawa
et al21 with minor modifications. The method involved
heating of .2 mL of 10% homogenate with .8 mL saline,
.5 mL butylated hydroxyl toluene, and 3.5 mL thiobarbituric acid reagent (.8%). The tubes were incubated at 60 C
for 90 minutes in a boiling water bath. After cooling, the
solution was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes,
and the precipitate obtained was removed. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 532 nm using
Thermo Scientific Multiscan Spectrum (Thermoscientific,
Vantaa, Finland) against a blank. TBARS content were expressed in mM of TBARS/mg protein.

Nitrate/Nitrite Content
Striatal tissues were homogenized in 10% ice-cold potassium chloride solution.22 A total of .2 mL of the homogenate was mixed with 1.8 mL of saline and .4 mL of
5-sulphosalicylic acid for protein precipitation. The precipitate was removed by centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes. To 1 mL of supernatant, 2 mL Griess reagent (1 g of
sulphanilamide dissolved in a small volume of distilled
water, 2 mL of orthophosphoric acid, and 100 mg of napthylethyldiamine were added, mixed well, and the volume
was made up to 100 mL with distilled water) was added.
The mixture was allowed to stand for 20 minutes under
dark condition. The color intensity of the chromogen

formed was read at 540 nm using Thermo Scientific Multiscan Spectrum. The values were expressed in nM/g tissue.

Total Protein
Total protein content in the striatal tissue was estimated
following Lowry et al23 method.

Double Immunofluorescence with TUNEL Staining
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine5’-triphosphate nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay was
performed using QIA39 FragEL DNA Fragmentation
Detection Kit. Rat brains were perfused transcardially
with normal saline, followed by perfusion and fixing in
10% neutral buffered formalin for a period of 48 hours.
A block, corresponding to coronal coordinates interaural
7.56-8.40 mm, bregma 21.44 to 2.60 mm Paxinos et al17
was excised for paraffin embedment. A total of 5 mm
paraffin sections were cut, processed, and nonspecific
binding was blocked by 1 hour incubation in 1.5% bovine
serum albumin. Sections were incubated with primary
antibodies for 1 hour and then subsequently incubated
with secondary antibodies for half an hour at room temperature. The double immunofluorescent technique was
a sequential procedure in which the first primary and first
secondary antibodies were incubated before second primary and second secondary antibodies. All sections
were rinsed twice between each step in .01 M PBS,
TUNEL-stained, and mounted. Mouse anti-GFAP (1:300)
was used as the first primary antibody, and mouse antiNeuN (1:100) was used as the second primary antibody.
FITC-conjugated goat antimouse IgG (1:40) was used as
the first secondary antibody, and TRITC-conjugated
goat antimouse IgG (1:20) was used as the second secondary antibody. Number of immunopositive cells was
scored using fluorescent research microscope (Optika
B600TiFL, Ponteranica, Italy).

logic scoring by Mann–Whitney U test using Graphpad
Prism 4.0 (San Diego, CA) software. Pearson correlation
analysis was performed using SYSTAT 11 (SPSS Inc,
Chicago, IL) to identify the correlation between bioenergetic modulators (SirT1 and Parp1 expressions) with
neurologic deficit, NAD1, glutamate, lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, caspase 3, GFAP, NeuN, and apoptotic
bodies (DAPI). P value less than .05 was fixed as the statistical significance criterion.

Results
Neurologic Deficits
Figure 1 shows the posture reflex score (neurologic
scoring) in experimental animals. Severe (P , .01) neurologic deficits were observed at 24, 72, and 166 hours in
IR rats compared with sham-operated rats. Correlation
analysis revealed SirT1 possesses a strong negative correlation (r 5 2.961), whereas Parp1 has a strong positive
correlation (r 5 .945) with neurologic deficit.

SirT1, Parp1, and Caspase 3
A significant decrease in SirT1 [F (6,14) 5 59.51, P ,.01]
and an increase in Parp1 [F (6,14) 5 249.0, P , .01], and
caspase 3 [F (6,14) 5 51.28, P , .01] expressions were
observed in ISC rats compared with sham-operated rats.
IR rats showed a significant and progressive decline in
SirT1 (P , .01) and an increase in Parp1 (P , .01) and caspase 3 (P , .01) expressions at 6 and through 24 and
72 hours compared with ISC rats. Correlation analysis
showed a strong negative correlation between Parp1
and caspase 3 with SirT1 (r 5 2.866 and 2.866, respectively), whereas Parp1 has a strong positive correlation
with Caspase 3 (r 5 1.000; Fig 2).

Histopathologic Examination
Coronal sections of the rat brains (5 mm thickness)
were cut and stained with cresyl violet for semiquantitative evaluation of neuronal degeneration and cell loss in
the ipsilateral hemispheres of cerebral cortex, CA1 region of hippocampus, and corpus striatum at 4003
magnification using Motic Images assisted light microscopy (Motic DMB1-2MP, Xiamen, China). The semiquantitative grading of cerebral ischemic–reperfused
(IR) injury was expressed as percentage of nisslpositive cells.24,25

Double Immunofluorescence with TUNEL Staining
NeuN, GFAP, and TUNEL-positive cells in striatal,
cortical, and hippocampal regions of experimental rat
brains are showed in Figure 3. A nonsignificant
decrease in NeuN and increase in GFAP and DAPI expressions were observed in ISC rat brains compared
with sham operated. A significant decrease in NeuN
(P , .01) and increase in DAPI (P , .01) were observed
in all the 3 regions of rats’ brain at 24 hours, which
was progressive through 166 hours after reperfusion,
whereas a significant increase in GFAP expression was
observed at 72 and 166 hours after reperfusion compared with ISC rat brains. Correlation analysis showed
a strong negative correlation between striatal SirT1 with
GFAP and DAPI (r 5 21.000 and 21.000, respectively)
and a strong positive correlation between SirT1 and
NeuN (r 5 1.000). Parp1 possess a strong positive correlation with GFAP and DAPI (r 5 1.000 and 1.000,
respectively) and a strong negative correlation with
NeuN (r 5 21.000).

Histopathology
Cresyl violet stained sections of cerebral cortex, CA1 region of hippocampus, and corpus striatum in the shamoperated group revealed normal density of neuronal cells
having characteristic round nuclei with the presence of
intracytoplasmic nissl substances, whereas in ISC and
IR at 1, 6, 24, 72, and 166 hours, the neuronal morphology
was strikingly transformed from a round, plump appearance to a stellate shape with characteristic blebbing, loss
of cytoplasmic nissl substances, presence of cytoplasmic
vacuolation, and nuclear condensation, respectively.
There were no neuronal loss observed up to 6 hours
in IR rats, but initiation of neurodegeneration (approximately 10%-30%) was observed as evidenced in cells
with loss of nissl substances, coarse chromatin clumping, and dense nuclear pyknosis compared with ISC
group (approximately 0%-10% of neuronal degeneration).
After 24 hours, a moderate neuronal degeneration
(approximately 40%-50% neurons) and complete loss of
nissl basophilia with cytoplasmic vacuolation in the CA1
region of hippocampus and corpus striatum, whereas
multifocal gliosis with perivascular cuffing and polymorphonuclear cell infiltrations were observed within the
infracted neutropil of cerebral cortex in IR group.
Neuronal degeneration characterized by stellate shaped neurons lacking a distinguishable nucleolus due to
early karyolysis or sometimes with fragmentation suggesting karyorrhexis and associated extensive delayed
neuronal loss with glial cell hypertrophy reached their
maximal levels in the cortical, hippocampal subfields
(CA1 and CA3), and striatal regions were observed at
72 hours (approximately 60%-75%) and 166 hours
(approximately 80%-95%), respectively, in IR rats com-

pared with the sham-operated group (Fig 4, A). Correlation analysis revealed a strong positive correlation
between striatal percentage of nissl-positive cells with
SirT1 (r 5 1.000), whereas a strong negative correlation
was observed with Parp1 (r 5 21.000) (Fig 4, B-E).

Discussion
Present study exposed that change in bioenergetic regulators level occurs earlier than oxidative stress in cerebral ischemia. This warns that early intervention with
drugs that restores/reverses these changes may exert better therapeutic outcome.
Maintenance of NAD1 level is critical to support
NAD1 dependent enzymes, SirT1 and Parp1, and also
to protect against excitotoxicity. Liu et al9 and Block
et al26 showed that exposure to glutamate/N-Methy-Daspartate, decreased NAD1, and SirT1 within 4 hours
and 2 hours, respectively, and an increased cytosolic
PAR polymer accumulation at 6 hours in cultured rat
neuronal cells. They also recorded approximately 60%
of cell death between 4 and 6 hours of glutamate/
NMDA exposure, a time point soon after the drop in
NAD1 levels, which suggests the involvement of NAD1
depletion in cell death process.
Further, Liu et al9 showed a significant decrease in
brain NAD1 levels at 6 hours following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. They also observed
an increased glucose transporter 3 messenger RNA
expression in the ipsilateral cortex at early time point
(3 hours), which reveals the existence of large density of
viable neurons during early post-stroke period. However,
GLUT3 levels was significantly reduced at 6 hours, which
further confirms, at in vivo level that NAD1 depletion is
involved in cell death.
In the present study, initiation of significant decrease in
NAD1 was recorded at early time point (1 hour) and a
severe plunge at 24 hours. In consistency with Liu et al9
findings, a significant decrease in SirT1 and increase in
Parp1 was observed at 6 hours after reperfusion, suggesting SirT1 and Parp1 are involved in early cellular events.
Decrease in NAD1 level at 6 hours through 166 hours
may be because of increased consumption,27 and this
could be the causative factor for initiation of neurodegenerative process as evidenced by increased loss of nissl
substances and dense nuclear pyknosis in histopathology.
Although SirT1 activity is not affected by NAD1 fluctuations within the physiological range,28 the present study
reveals that SirT1 levels were found to be influenced
(strong positive correlation) by cellular NAD1 levels but
in an excitotoxic environment.
We did not observe a significant increase in glutamate,
lipid peroxidation, or nitric oxide content at early time
points (up to 6 hours). But a highly significant increase
in glutamate content was observed at 24 hours, which
was found to be maximum at 72 hours. However, the

peak elevation in lipid peroxidation and nitric content
were recorded only at 166 hours. This suggests that
beyond the fall in NAD1 levels, the increase in glutamate
content was found to involve in triggering oxidative
stress. Buelow et al29 showed that Parp1 is required
for oxidative stress-induced transient receptor potential
protein 2 cation channels activation, in lymphocytes,
and downstream cellular events. The present study also
demonstrates that Parp1 (max expression at 72 hours)
has a role in glutamate activity and hence astrogliosis
since peak increase in GFAP was also observed at
72 hours.30-32
Immunofluorescence investigation revealed significant
change in NeuN and TUNEL-positive cells (DAPI) count
at 24 hours, whilst GFAP at 72 hours, but no change on
these protein levels at early time points (6 hours). Loss
of NeuN with increased TUNEL-positive cells shows
that the cell death is triggered at nuclear level, which
might be because of the increased PAR polymer accumulation in neuronal nucleus. On the other hand, severe fall
in NAD1 level at 24 hours with subsequent decrease in
NeuN count may be a cytosolic phenomenon viz, mitochondrial depolarization/permeability, bringing cellular
death at least partly by arrest of tricarboxylic acid cy-

(continued).

cle.33,34 It is interesting to note that increased GFAP
expression (recorded at 72 hours) after ischemia suggesting the increased synaptic glutamate content or
impaired astrocytic glutamate clearance as the triggering factor for oxidative stress.35 Despite severe loss
in NeuN count, we observed a substantial increase in
lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide content at 72 hours,
which suggest that these oxidative markers are astrocyte
derived. Various reports demonstrate the deleterious
role of NO in ischemia-induced neurodegeneration.
However, its temporal changes after ischemia or at
various time points during reperfusion is still controvert.
Although many reports by Zhang et al40 and Yong-Sheng
et al41 showed peak NO elevation at 24 hours after
ischemia, we observed peak elevation in NO level at
72 hours.
Niwa et al42 reported that neuronal nitric oxide synthase may be neurotoxic in ischemia in the early phase
(6 hours), like inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in
the late phase (72 hours). On the other hand, Cardenas
et al43 showed that NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor
is implicated in the mechanisms that lead to the expression of iNOS. In the present study, we record a significant
increase in NO level at 72 hours and also a strong positive

correlation with glutamate level. This clearly substantiates that the late phase increase in NO levels is because
of the massive increase in glutamate (via increased
iNOS expression).
SirT1 reduces cell death by decreasing the levels
of apoptotic markers such as caspase 3 and p53.36-38
Earlier report demonstrated that SirT1 deficiency results
in increased Parp1 expression leading to apoptotic.14 In
the present study, the decreased SirT1 with concomitant
increase in Parp1 and caspase 3 was observed as early
at 6 hours, suggesting that bioenergetic regulators have
the ability to trigger apoptotic proteins activity. Cresyl violet–stained histopathologic sections revealed no
neuronal loss but initiation of neurodegenerative pathologic signs at 6 hours, and the process of neurodegeneration remained continued through 166 hours in the order
of 24 , 72 , 166 hours. It gives the impression that all
these complex pathologic events contribute for the neurologic deficits and complete neurodegeneration in stroke.
In summary, the present study clearly reveals that
change in bioenergetic regulators (SirT1 and Parp1) occurs earlier to excitotoxicity and oxidative stress in cerebral stroke (Fig 5). Based on the onset time of stroke,
appropriate intervention, that is, bioenergetic modulators
at early period and either glutamatergic and/or antioxidant therapy at delayed period shall be studied in future
research so as to develop a better therapeutic outcome.
