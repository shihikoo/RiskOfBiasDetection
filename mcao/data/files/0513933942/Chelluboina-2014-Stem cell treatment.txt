Abstract Evidence suggests that apoptosis contributes
significantly to cell death after cerebral ischemia. Our
recent studies that utilized human umbilical cord bloodderived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCBSCs) demonstrated
the potential of hUCBSCs to inhibit neuronal apoptosis in a
rat model of CNS injury. Therefore, we hypothesize that
intravenous administration of hUCBSCs after focal cerebral ischemia would reduce brain damage by inhibiting
apoptosis and downregulating the upregulated apoptotic
pathway molecules. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were
obtained and randomly assigned to various groups. After
the animals reached a desired weight, they were subjected
to a 2 h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) procedure followed by 7 days of reperfusion. The hUCBSCs
were obtained, cultured, and intravenously injected
(0.25 9 106 cells or 1 9 106 cells) via the tail vein to

separate groups of animals 24 h post-MCAO procedure.
We performed various techniques including PCR microarray, hematoxylin and eosin, and TUNEL staining in
addition to immunoblot and immunofluorescence analysis
in order to investigate the effect of our treatment on regulation of apoptosis after focal cerebral ischemia. Most of
the apoptotic pathway molecules which were upregulated
after focal cerebral ischemia were downregulated after
hUCBSCs treatment. Further, the staining techniques
revealed a prominent reduction in brain damage and the
extent of apoptosis at even the lowest dose of hUCBSCs
tested in the present study. In conclusion, our treatment
with hUCBSCs after cerebral ischemia in the rodent
reduces brain damage by inhibiting apoptosis and downregulating the apoptotic pathway molecules.

Introduction
Despite advances in understanding the mechanisms of
acute ischemic stroke, the only FDA approved treatment is
still intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator.
There are no other effective options due to perhaps multifaceted mechanisms involved in neuronal damage after
brain ischemia [1]. Globally, fifteen million people suffer
from a stroke each year, and five million stroke patients die
with another five million left permanently disabled [2].
Recently, stem cell-based approaches have received much
hope as potential methods for therapeutic use. Clinical
trials that utilized stem cells in stroke thus far predominantly have targeted at subacute and chronic phases of
stroke [3]. The findings reported from preclinical and

123

1512

clinical studies demonstrate that stem cell-based therapies
have the potential to improve the clinical outcome in stroke
patients [4–6]. Stem cell transplantation offers a promising
new therapeutic strategy for stroke not only to prevent the
ongoing damage, which has been the focus of conventional
therapy, but also to actually repair the injured brain.
In addition to ethical and moral concerns, limited
availability of embryonic, fetal, and adult brain-derived
neural stem cells have prompted the search for other stem
cell sources. Bone marrow- and human umbilical cord
blood-derived stem cells have emerged as alternative stem
cell sources. Of these, human umbilical cord blood-derived
mesenchymal stem cells (hUCBSCs) possess several
advantages over other types of stem cells including those
derived from bone marrow [7]. To date, very few authors
have reported the use of human umbilical cord blood cells
in animal models of acute cerebral ischemia. A few have
reported that these cells survive, migrate and offer dosedependent behavioral improvement and neuronal sparing
after stoke [8–13]. However, none of these studies that
utilized hUCBSCs have thus far clearly delineated the
molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotection
after focal cerebral ischemia.
It is rather clear that apoptosis contributes significantly
to cell death subsequent to cerebral ischemia. Recently,
we demonstrated the inhibition of neuronal apoptosis in a
rat model of spinal cord injury after intraspinal implantation of hUCBSCs [14]. We hypothesize that ‘‘intravenous administration of hUCBSCs after focal cerebral
ischemia would reduce brain damage by inhibiting
apoptosis and downregulating the upregulated apoptotic
pathway molecules.’’ Considering the potential use of
hUCBSCs in acute brain ischemia, the molecular mechanisms responsible for their neuroprotection and effective
dose at which these cells offer neuroprotection need to be
further elucidated prior to their clinical application.
Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to investigate
the effective dose of hUCBSCs that can reduce the brain
damage and the effect of hUCBSCs treatment on the
modulation of gene expression of apoptotic pathway
molecules in a rat model of transient acute focal cerebral
ischemia. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has
been designed and conducted to explore the underlying
molecular mechanisms of hUCBSCs-mediated neuroprotection after ischemic stroke.

at Peoria approved all surgical interventions and postoperative animal care.
Antibodies
Anti-Fas, anti-TNFa, anti-XIAP and anti-Smac antibodies
were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA). Anti-apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and anti-cleaved
caspase-3 antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, MA). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody was obtained from
Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO).
Animals
In this study, we used male Sprague–Dawley rats. All
animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the
IACUC guidelines. Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats
weighing 230–250 g were procured from Harlan Laboratories (USA). Animals were housed in a 12 h light/dark
cycle with a controlled temperature and humidity and free
access to food and water. After the animals reached a
weight of 260 ± 5 g, they were randomly assigned to four
groups, and each group consisted of at least 12 animals.
Group 1 was used as sham controls. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were
subjected to the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
procedure. Group 2 animals were subjected to the MCAO
procedure without any further treatments. Group 3 and
Group 4 animals were intravenously injected with
0.25 9 106 and 1 9 106 hUCBSCs, respectively, suspended in 0.5 mL sterile saline via tail vein 24 h postMCAO procedure. All animals from the four groups were
sacrificed 7 days post-MCAO procedure. All procedures
that were performed on the animals were in compliance
with the approved IACUC protocol.
Stem Cells

Materials and Methods

Cryo-preserved hUCBSCs obtained from Vitro Biopharma
(Golden, CO) were used to establish cultures in MSC-GRO
low serum complete MSC medium according to the provided instructions. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO2 with a change
of culture medium twice a week. When the cell cultures
were about 80 % to 90 % confluent, cells were split and
subcultured. Cells were detached, washed twice with sterile
phosphate buffered saline (PBS), counted and suspended in
sterile saline prior to intravenous administration.

earlier [15]. Briefly, a ventral midline incision (*25 mm)
was made in the neck and the right common carotid,
internal carotid, and external carotid arteries were surgically exposed. The external carotid artery was permanently
ligated rostral with one ligature. A microaneurysm clip
was applied to the external carotid artery near its bifurcation with the internal carotid artery. A small puncture
opening was made in the external carotid artery. Monofilament was inserted through the opening, and the other
loose ligature was tightened around the lumen containing
the monofilament. The microaneurysm clip was removed
from the external carotid artery, and the monofilament was
then gently advanced from the lumen of the external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery for a distance of
*19–20 mm beyond the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. Skin on the neck incision was closed with
surgical wound clips. To restore the blood flow 2 h after
MCA occlusion, the surgical site was re-opened by
removing the wound clips. The microaneurysm clip was
removed, the knot was loosened, the monofilament was
withdrawn and the knot was re-tied to stop bleeding. The
skin was sutured to close the neck incision.
Group 3 and 4 animals were intravenously injected with
0.25 9 106 and 1 9 106 hUCBSCs respectively, via tail
vein, 24 h post-MCAO procedure. All animals subjected to
the MCAO procedure were treated with appropriate doses
of analgesics and antibiotics as mentioned in the approved
IACUC protocol. On the seventh day post-MCAO procedure, all animals were sacrificed. The brain tissues obtained
from these animals were utilized for various experimental
procedures.

instructions. Briefly, the paraffin-embedded tissue sections
were de-paraffinized, re-hydrated, treated with proteinase
K working solution, and permeabilized. Permeabilized
tissue sections were incubated with the TUNEL reaction
mixture in a humidified atmosphere for 60 min at 37 °C in
the dark. Sections were counterstained for nuclei with
DAPI (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), cover slipped using fluorescent mounting medium (Dako), and observed under a
fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX71).
Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining
Paraffin-embedded brain sections of various groups of
animals including sham controls were de-paraffinized, rehydrated and then subjected to hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) staining according to a standard protocol. H&E
stained sections were cover slipped and observed under a
light microscope.
RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) from the ischemic ipsilateral brain regions
of rats sacrificed on the seventh day post-MCAO procedure. Briefly, total RNA was extracted with TRIzol and
precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, washed in ethanol, and
resuspended in RNase-free water. One lg of total RNA
was reverse transcribed into first-strand cDNA using the
Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche,
Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNAs obtained from this process were used for
rat apoptosis RT2 Profiler PCR array.

Brain Tissue Fixation and Sectioning
Apoptosis PCR Array
On the seventh day post-MCAO procedure, animals from
all four groups were placed under deep anesthesia with
pentobarbital and perfused through the left ventricle with
70–100 mL of PBS, followed by 100–150 mL of 10 %
buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, NJ). The brains of the
animals from various treatment groups were then removed,
fixed in 10 % buffered formalin, and embedded in paraffin.
Serial coronal brain sections were cut at a thickness of
5–6 lm with a microtome.
Terminal Deoxy Nucleotidyl Transferase-Mediated
Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Assay
The extent of apoptosis in the ischemic core and the penumbra regions of paraffin-embedded coronal brain sections
of animals from all the groups were analyzed by TUNEL

We used the RT2 Profiler Rat Apoptosis PCR Array (SA
Biosciences). Each array contains a panel of 96 primer sets
of 84 relevant apoptosis pathway focused genes, plus five
housekeeping genes and three RNA and PCR quality
controls. The cDNAs obtained from the brain sections of
hUCBSCs-treated rats sacrificed on day seven post-MCAO
procedure were loaded onto microarray plates along with
Fast Start SYBR Green (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sample-loaded
microarray plate was subjected to real-time PCR analysis
in iCycler IQ (Multi Color Real-Time PCR Detection
System, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Real-time
PCR was carried out under the following conditions: one
cycle of 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s
and 60 °C for 1 min. We performed the PCR microarray
analysis on the samples obtained from three different animals per group.

Immunofluorescence Analysis
Immunofluorescence analysis was used to identify the
changes in the expression of cleaved-caspase-3 protein
upon treatment with various doses of hUCBSCs. Paraffinembedded brain sections of various groups of animals were
deparaffinized, subjected to antigen retrieval, permeabilized, processed with anti-cleaved-caspase-3 primary antibody followed by Alexa FluorÒ 488 (goat anti-rabbit IgG,
green) fluorescent-labeled secondary antibody, counterstained with DAPI, cover slipped, and observed using a
confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview). Negative controls (without primary antibody or using isotype specific
IgG) were maintained for all the samples. The results were
quantified by counting the number of cleaved-caspase-3positive cells in at least five different ischemic zones of
ipsilateral brain regions of the tissue sections obtained from
at least three animals per group.
Immunoblot Analysis
In order to study the expression of various proteins in tissue
lysates of untreated and hUCBSCs-treated ischemic brains
and the brain tissues of sham controls, immunoblot analysis
was performed as described earlier [15]. Briefly, appropriate portions of the brain tissues of sacrificed rats were
suspended in 0.2 mL of homogenization buffer, homogenized using a Tissue Tearor (Biospec Products, Inc.), and
followed by sonication. Tissue homogenate was centrifuged at 15,0009g for 30 min at 4 °C and the protein
levels in the supernatant were determined using the BCA
assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Samples [equal amount
(30–50 lg) of total protein/well] were subjected to
12–14 % SDS-PAGE based on the specifications of the
protein, and the protein bands on the gel were transferred
onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were
processed with primary antibodies followed by appropriate
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive
bands were visualized using chemiluminescence ECL
Western blotting detection reagents on Hyperfilm-MP
autoradiography film (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ).
Immunoblots were re-probed and processed with GAPDH
antibody to verify that similar amounts of protein were
loaded in all lanes.
Statistical Analysis
Apoptotic gene analysis data obtained in the form of Ct values
was analyzed by using web-based analysis software (http://
pcrdataanalysis.sabiosciences.com/pcr/arrayanalysis.php).
Changes in gene expression were shown as a fold increased
or decreased. The cut-off induction determining expression
was ±2.0 fold-changes, and the genes fitting these criteria

123

Neurochem Res (2014) 39:1511–1521

were considered to be upregulated or downregulated. Statistical comparisons for cleaved-caspase-3 immunofluorescence were performed using Graph Pad Prism software
(version 3.02). These data were evaluated for statistical
significance using one-way ANOVA. Bonferroni’s post hoc
test (multiple comparison tests) was used to compare any
statistical significance among the groups. Differences in the
values were considered significant at p \ 0.05.

Results
Stem Cell Treatment Reduces Brain Damage After
Acute Focal Cerebral Ischemia
Recently, we demonstrated that ischemia-induced apoptotic
cell death results in significant brain injury in the ipsilateral
hemisphere of rats after MCAO procedure followed by
reperfusion [15]. In the present study, TUNEL analysis of
the coronal brain sections of rats subjected to a 2 h MCAO
procedure followed by 7 days of reperfusion demonstrated a
prominent TUNEL staining in both the ischemic core and
the penumbra regions of cortex and striatum (Fig. 1).
Intravenous administration of hUCBSCs 24 h post-MCAO
procedure prominently reduced the intensity of TUNEL
staining and the number of TUNEL-positive cells in both the
ischemic and the penumbra regions (Fig. 1). The reduction
of apoptosis as evidenced by TUNEL staining after hUCBSCs treatment was not dose-dependent, i.e., the lowest
dose of hUCBSCs administered (0.25 9 106 cells) produced
a similar response to that offered by the highest dose of
hUCBSCs (1 9 106 cells) utilized in the present study.
TUNEL-positive cells were absent in the contralateral brain
regions of rats subjected to various treatment conditions.
Cells in the cortex and striatal regions of ipsilateral hemisphere of hUCBSCs-treated animals showed cleaved caspase-3 protein expression (Fig. 2a). The percent of cleaved
caspase-3 positive cells in the ipsilateral brain regions of
hUCBSCs-treated animals was significantly (p \ 0.05)
reduced compared to untreated animals (Fig. 2b). Similar to
what we noticed in TUNEL staining, there was no significant difference in the percent of cleaved caspase-3 positive
cells between the two doses of hUCBSCs tested in the
present study.
In addition, H&E staining performed on the paraffinembedded coronal brain sections from all groups of rats
revealed a prominent reduction in the structural brain
damage in the ipsilateral regions of hUCBSCs-treated
animals compared to untreated animals (Fig. 2c). Magnified images of the cortex and striatal regions of the ischemic core showed absence of interstitial edema and a very
few pyknotic nuclei in hUCBSCs-treated animals compared to untreated animals. The extent of interstitial edema

ischemia were corrected with the minimum dose of hUCBSCs tested in the present study (Tables 1, 2).
Immunoblot analysis of the key apoptotic molecules
such as Fas, TNFa, AIF and Smac and the anti-apoptotic
molecule XIAP revealed a prominent reduction in protein
expression after hUCBSCs treatment (Fig. 4). The protein
expression of all these molecules, except Smac, was
prominently reduced at the minimum dose of hUCBSCs
tested in the present study. Smac protein expression was
reduced at the highest dose of hUCBSCs (1 9 106 cells/
animal) tested in the study. The reduction in the expression
profile of these apoptotic pathway molecules at both
mRNA and protein levels was in agreement with the
reduction of the extent of apoptosis upon hUCBSCs
treatment described in the earlier section.

Regulation of Apoptotic Molecules After Stem Cell
Treatment
Our recent study clearly demonstrated the upregulation of
several apoptotic pathway molecules after focal cerebral
ischemia in rats [15]. In the present study, hUCBSCs
treatment 24 h post-MCAO procedure to rats reverted the
mRNA expression profile of a majority of the apoptotic
molecules to basal levels (Fig. 3). Even the minimum dose
of hUCBSCs utilized in the present study (0.25 9 106
cells/animal) was sufficient to revert the upregulated
apoptotic pathway molecules in response to focal cerebral
ischemia to basal levels. The mRNA expression profile of
various apoptotic pathway molecules in animals after hUCBSCs treatment at both of the dose levels tested in the
present study was comparable to sham-operated animals
(Fig. 3). Several fold downregulation of various genes
involved in the induction or inhibition of apoptosis in
animals after hUCBSCs treatment compared to untreated
MCAO-subjected animals is listed in Tables 1 and 2,
respectively. Similarly, the fold downregulation of genes
that can either induce or inhibit apoptosis upon hUCBSCs
treatment is listed in Table 2. Almost all of the apoptotic
pathway molecules that were affected after focal cerebral

Discussion
Compelling evidence suggests that regulating apoptosis in
both the ischemic core and the penumbra after cerebral
ischemia can provide an opportunity to reverse the cell
death and neurovascular integrity [16–18]. TUNEL staining performed in this study clearly demonstrated the
reduction of apoptotic cell death after intravenous hUCBSCs treatment in both the ischemic core and the penumbra. These results are in agreement with the earlier
reported data where authors demonstrated a significant

researchers recently reported that the intravenous administration of human umbilical cord blood cells did not
reduce caspase-dependent cell death in premorbid rats [11,

0.25 9 106 hUCBSCs/animal to normal Sprague–Dawley
rats significantly reduced the number of cleaved caspase-3
positive cells in the ipsilateral hemisphere (Fig. 2b). The

differences in animal strain, occlusion method, occlusion
time, reperfusion time and/or the type of cells utilized.
Intra-arterial administration of hUCBSCs (1 9 106 cells/
animal) to adult beagle dogs 1 day after occlusion of the
middle cerebral artery by injecting thrombus emboli
reduced the infarct volume [10]. Another group of

Fig. 4 Immunoblots depict the protein expression profile of apoptotic
and anti-apoptotic molecules. Focal cerebral ischemia increased

researchers also reported that intravenous administration of
human umbilical cord blood cells to rats 24 h after transient (2 h) MCAO improved functional recovery and
neuronal sparing [8, 9]. All of these authors reported that
the administered cells entered the brain, survived and
migrated and trans differentiated to various neuronal cells.
We could attribute a significant part of the neuroprotection
offered by stem cells in these studies and in the present
study to the inhibition of apoptosis. Other possible mechanisms of neuroprotection offered by hUCBSCs which
were reported earlier by our research team include trans
differentiation to neurons and oligodendrocyte, increased
expression of myelin basic protein, remyelination of the
demyelinated/hypomyelinated axons, altered mRNA and
protein expression of several matrix metalloproteinases and
other apoptotic pathway molecules, etc. [7, 19–21].
Both extrinsic and intrinsic (mitochondrial pathway)
apoptotic pathway molecules that were upregulated after
transient right MCAO in rats were reverted to normal
levels after hUCBSCs treatment (Fig. 3; Tables 1, 2). Bax,
Bad, and Bid which cause the release of cytochrome C, the
main trigger for mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis, were
downregulated at the lowest dose of hUCBSCs tested in the
present study (Table 1). As expected, caspase-3, the
downstream of cytochrome C, mRNA levels also reverted
to normal at the lowest dose of hUCBSCs tested. Similar to
cytochrome C, the mRNA levels of Smac/Diablo, an
apoptotic molecule released from the mitochondria, were
also reduced after treatment with hUCBSCs. Smac inhibits
XIAP, an anti-apoptotic molecule that inhibits caspase-3.
Although the mRNA levels of Smac were reverted to
normal at the lowest dose of hUCBSCs tested, the protein
expression of Smac was prominently reduced only at the

1519

highest dose of hUCBSCs tested in the present study
(Table 1; Fig. 4). The numbers of cleaved caspase-3
positive cells were also significantly reduced in the ipsilateral brain regions after hUCBSCs treatment (Fig. 2b).
Interestingly, the highest dose of hUCBSCs tested in the
present study further downregulated Bax, Bad, Bid, and
caspase-3 mRNA levels to below normal levels (Table 1).
In addition to caspase-3 mRNA levels, hUCBSCs treatment also downregulated other caspases including caspase1, caspase-2, caspase-3, caspase-4, caspase-6, caspase-7,
caspase-8, caspase-12, caspase-14, and caspase-8ap2,
many of which were upstream to caspase-3. Earlier
investigations that utilized caspase inhibitors such as
zVADfmk, BAF, zDEVDfmk, IETDfmk, and YVADcmk
have been demonstrated to reduce the number of apoptotic
cells or to be neuroprotective in animal models of focal and
global cerebral ischemia [22–27]. Similarly, recent investigations that utilized hUCBSCs in animal models of
cerebral ischemia have been reported to reduce the infarct
size and improve the neurological recovery [10, 12, 13].
Therefore, the present study that utilized hUCBSCs in a rat
model of focal cerebral ischemia and demonstrated the
inhibition of apoptosis and downregulation of various
apoptotic pathway molecules further strengthens these
earlier reports by providing possible mechanisms that
would have been responsible for the reported neuroprotection offered by hUCBSCs. In addition to caspases
downregulation, treatment with hUCBSCs prominently
reduced the elevated protein expression of AIF, the key
molecule involved the non-caspase-mediated induction of
apoptosis by intrinsic apoptotic pathway (Fig. 4).
In addition to affecting the intrinsic apoptotic pathway
molecules, hUCBSCs treatment in the present study also
regulated the Fas/TNF family death receptor-mediated
extrinsic apoptotic pathway molecules such as Fasl, Fas,
FADD, TNFa, TNFR1, TRADD, etc. All the extrinsic
apoptotic pathway molecules in addition to those listed
earlier were downregulated after treatment with hUCBSCs (Table 1). The protein expressions of Fas and
TNFa were also prominently reduced after hUCBSCs
treatment (Fig. 4). The death domains of FADD and
TRADD proteins interact with the death effector domains
of procaspase-8, cleaving it, and in turn, activating
downstream effector caspase and apoptosis [28, 29]. As
mentioned earlier, stem cell treatment downregulated
many of the elevated caspase and reduced the cleavedcaspase-3 protein expression irrespective of the involvement of either extrinsic or intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
The lowest dose of hUCBSCs utilized in the present study
was sufficient to revert these molecules to normal levels
from their elevated levels after focal cerebral ischemia
[15]. Contrary to our expectation, hUCBSCs treatment
downregulated the gene expression levels of various anti-

123

1520

apoptotic molecules including Annexin A5, Bcl2, cIAP1,
cIAP2, XIAP, Naip2, and survivin, among others, which
were upregulated in the ipsilateral brain regions after
focal cerebral ischemia (Table 2). The protein expression
of XIAP was also prominently reduced after hUCBSCs
treatment (Fig. 4). Downregulation of anti-apoptotic
molecules after hUCBSCs treatment in the present study
could be due to the effect of endogenous mechanisms in
response to reduced gene and protein expression of
apoptotic molecules. Because of the apoptotic cross-talk
among several pathways, inhibition of one apoptotic
pathway may augment an alternative one. Interestingly,
our treatment strategy that utilized hUCBSCs inhibited
apoptosis by regulating the expression of several molecules which could have been contributed to apoptosis
after cerebral ischemia.
In summary, the present study provided an in-depth
understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the
neuroprotective effects of mesenchymal stem cells derived
from human umbilical cord blood in a rat model of transient focal cerebral ischemia. Our study clearly demonstrated the potential of hUCBSCs to regulate various
molecules responsible for cell death after transient focal
cerebral ischemia followed by reperfusion. Based on these
results, it appears that administration of hUCBSCs after
ischemic stroke could offer a therapeutic advantage over
other treatment strategies that target one or two molecules/
mechanisms. The survival and transdifferentiation of these
hUCBSCs to various neuronal cells in the ischemic brain
regions after their administration to animals has already
been reported. However, we still need to investigate the
beneficial and toxic effects of single and multiple doses of
hUCBSCs by intravenous route administered at various
time points after focal cerebral ischemia on the long-term
neurological outcome.
