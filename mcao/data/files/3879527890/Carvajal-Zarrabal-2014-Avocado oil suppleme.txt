The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of avocado oil administration on biochemical markers of cardiovascular risk
profile in rats with metabolic changes induced by sucrose ingestion. Twenty-five rats were divided into five groups: a control group
(CG; basic diet), a sick group (MC; basic diet plus 30% sucrose solution), and three other groups (MCao, MCac, and MCas; basic
diet plus 30% sucrose solution plus olive oil and avocado oil extracted by centrifugation or using solvent, resp.). Glucose, total
cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, low- and high-density lipoproteins (LDL, HDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL),
lactic dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration were analyzed. Avocado oil reduces
TG, VLDL, and LDL levels, in the LDL case significantly so, without affecting HDL levels. An effect was exhibited by avocado oil
similar to olive oil, with no significant difference between avocado oil extracted either by centrifugation or solvent in myocardial
injury biochemical indicators. Avocado oil decreased hs-CRP levels, indicating that inflammatory processes were partially reversed.
These findings suggested that avocado oil supplementation has a positive health outcome because it reduces inflammatory events
and produces positive changes in the biochemical indicators studied, related to the development of metabolic syndrome.

1. Introduction
Food is a factor that plays a key role in life style, a determining
influence on health and quality of life. It is known that populations with a high consumption of meat, dairy foods, and sugar
have a higher mortality rate than those that feed mainly on
fruits, vegetables, fish, and unsaturated oils [1]. Undesirable
effects on health are associated with an excessive intake
of carbohydrates (sugars) and fats. Manifestations of health
disorders in people with metabolic implications are related
to the incidence and prevalence of chronic and degenerative

diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and
dyslipidemia (low HDL-cholesterol and high triglycerides),
among others [2, 3]. Although there are many factors that
contribute to its development, one of the main causes that
lead to these conditions is the diet that is consumed. A diet
containing a great amount of nutrients produces a strong
impact on structure, physiology, and cellular metabolism.
In recent years, the increase in these diseases has become a
global public health problem inspite of the increasing medical
knowledge for their prevention and treatment; consequently,
the nutritional aspect seems to remain vital.

2
Statistics from the Secretary of Health in Mexico indicate
that the incidence of cardiovascular diseases has increased
in recent years, so that now they are the leading cause of
death worldwide (WHO, 2007). On the other hand, reports
found in scientific literature about the health benefits of
the Mediterranean diet and olive oil have attracted interest
in research on the effects and consumption of oils rich in
monounsaturated fatty acids, particularly oleic acid, and its
relationship with metabolic syndrome, which predisposes the
individual to more serious complications, such as diabetes
and cardiovascular diseases [4‚Äì6].
Mexico is a major world producer of avocados; this
fruit is a rich potential source of oil (15‚Äì30 g/100 g of fruit),
mostly monounsaturated [7], and a good source of linoleic
acid [8]. It also contains high levels of antioxidants including
polyphenols, proanthocyanidins, tocopherols, and carotenoids which have shown positive health outcomes. It has also
been established that soluble components of avocado oil
confer these antioxidant properties. Studies in human and
animal models have shown that this oil helps to control
weight, reduces the risk of diabetes [9], normalizes blood
cholesterol levels [10], is involved in liver metabolism [11], and
helps in skin care [12]. Other studies reported the presence
of functional molecules such as glutathione [13], a molecule
related to decreased risk of cancer. On the other hand, the
unsaponifiable components, rich in antioxidant molecules
[14], have also shown beneficial effects on anti-inflammatory
processes related to the development of cancer [15].
In the relevant literature, the benefits generated by
including olive oil in the diet for cardiovascular disease risk
reduction are well documented. Due to similarities in lipid
composition between olive oil and avocado oil, it may be
assumed that the high concentration of monounsaturated
fatty acids in avocado oil could be as adequate as olive oil for
lowering blood lipid levels. In addition, the phytochemical
components of avocado oil are also related to the disease
manifestations associated with an altered metabolic profile;
so overall, it is expected that all the beneficial properties of
avocado oil will achieve positive health effects.

2. Material and Methods
2.1. Avocado Oil Extraction. There are different technologies
for extracting oil from the avocado and they can affect its
quality. The oil was obtained from Hass avocado purchased
from a local market in the Port of Veracruz, Mexico. When
edible maturity had been reached, the avocados were washed
and peeled and the seed was removed. Subsequently, the
pulp was homogenized by adding tert-butylhydroquinone
(TBHQ) at 0.001% (w/w).
2.1.1. Oil Extraction by Centrifugation. The avocado pulp was
mixed with water to achieve a 1 : 1 w/v and NaCl (7.5% w/w),
the pH was adjusted to 5.5 with ascorbic acid, and the mixture
was homogenized in a blender (Black & Decker Model MX
150) at 1,300 rpm for 1 hour at 35‚àò C. Subsequently, the oil
was removed by centrifugation at 27000 rpm in a tubular
continuous centrifuge (Cepa-Schnell, GLE Model NBS) fed
at 2.8 L/min.

Corn-canola in the basal diet (CG and MC groups); experimental diets
(MCao, MCac, and MCas resp.) were formulated with olive oil or avocado
oil, extracted either by centrifugation or solvent.

2.1.2. Avocado Oil Extraction by Solvent. A homogenate was
made with a portion of the avocado pulp and two parts
of a mixture of hexane-isopropanol (2 : 3 v/v) in separate
funnels, and the oil phase was collected. Subsequently, the
solvent was removed in a rotary evaporator (Buchi R-215,
Labortechnik AG, Switzerland) at 30‚àò C and 500 mmHg
pressure. The remaining solvent was removed by entrainment
with nitrogen gas and then the oil was exposed to high
vacuum in a freeze dryer for 24 h. Thereafter the oil was stored
in refrigeration and protected from light until use.
2.2. Experimental Animals and Diets. In this experiment 25
male Sprague-Dawley weaned rats (6 weeks old and weighing
240 ¬± 16 g) were purchased from Teklad, Co. (Mexico City),
and caged individually in stainless steel boxes in a room
with controlled temperature (25‚àò C) and a light-dark cycle
of 12 hours. The experimental protocol for the management
of experimental animals was approved by the animal ethics
committee, Biochemical and Nutrition Chemistry Area, University of Veracruz. The basal diet was prepared according
to the American Institute of Nutrition [16] as shown in
Table 1. A mixture of corn-canola oil (7.5 g/100 g diet) was
used as a source of dietary fat (Patrona from the local
market). The experimental diet was prepared based on the
composition of the basal diet plus oil (7.5% w/w): olive
oil (carbonell), avocado oil extracted by centrifugation or
solvent, respectively. Diets were prepared once a week and
kept in powder form at 4‚àò C until use. As part of this study, the
fatty acid composition of the oils used in preparing diets was
analyzed and it was found that all the oils had a rather similar
composition, mainly oleic and linoleic acids (Table 2).
2.3. Sucrose-Induced Metabolic Changes Model. The animals
were divided into two groups: a control group (CG, ùëõ = 5)
receiving a basal diet and a group with sucrose-induced
metabolic changes (MC, ùëõ = 20), which received the basal
diet plus 30% sucrose solution as drinking water to induce
this condition. The animals had free access to food and water
for 16 weeks and food intake was measured daily. At the end
of this period, the diet was withdrawn for at least 4 hours
and the manifestation of the metabolic characteristics was

checked by determining body weight; then serum glucose,
triglycerides, and cholesterol levels were determined and
obtained by cardiac puncture.
2.4. Animal Treatment
2.4.1. Experimental Diet Management. Once the sucroseinduced metabolic changes model had been obtained, the
MC animals were divided into four groups of five rats
each. One group was maintained on the basal diet (the
sick group, MC); three groups of rats designated, as MCao,
MCac, and MCas, respectively, received an experimental
diet containing 7.5% w/w oil (olive and avocado extracted by
centrifugation or extracted with solvent) as the sole source
of dietary fat. These four groups received the experimental
diets and water with 30% sucrose solution for 4 weeks. The
CG group continued to receive only the diet with corncanola oil and no sucrose in the drinking water. Diets were
prepared once a week and kept refrigerated until use. At
the end of the experiment the diet was withdrawn, and the
fasting animals were sacrificed through decapitation. Serum
glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid levels
were determined. All animals were sacrificed and the organs
were extracted for further analysis.
2.5. Biochemical Indicators. All biochemical indicator analyses were carried out on serum blood samples. Glucose
was determined with the glucose oxidase method. Total
cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), phospholipids (PL), lowand high-density lipoprotein (LDL, HDL), very low-density
lipoprotein (VLDL), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine
kinase (CK), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)
were determined by enzymatic colorimetric methods using
commercial kits obtained from Bayer and BioMerieux, using
an automated analyzer (RA 1000 XT, Bayer Technicon) and a
microplate reader to determine hs-CRP. The fatty acid profile
of vegetable oils was determined by gas chromatography
(Hewlett Packard 5890, Palo Alto, CA.) using pentadecanoic
acid as internal standard. All chemicals used were of analytical grade.
2.6. Statistical Analysis. The data are expressed as the mean ¬±
standard deviation (x ¬± SD). Statistical significance was
determined with analysis of variance procedures, with a post
hoc Tukey multiple-range test for comparison of means (ùëÉ <
0.05). Data were analysed using IBMc SPSSc Statistics Version
20, 2011.

3. Results
3.1. Metabolic Characteristics Evaluating Rats in the Control
Group and Rats with Sucrose-Induced Metabolic Changes.
Table 3 shows growth variables, food and caloric intake,
liquid consumption and the biochemical markers assessed
in rats of the control group (CG) and those with sucroseinduced metabolic changes (MC).
After 16 weeks, a significant increase (ùëÉ < 0.05) in
final body weight and body weight gain was observed in
the MC group as compared to the CG group, although the
food intake in rats in the CG group was significantly higher
(ùëÉ < 0.01) than in the MC group. Contrary to this, the MC
group showed a daily liquid intake significantly higher (ùëÉ <
0.05) as compared with the CG group. However, when the
daily liquid intake per 100 g in weight was compared between
CG and MC groups, this was not significant. The caloric
equivalent produced by liquid intake was 10.8 ¬± 1.7 kcal in
the MC group; the CG group did not have any energy intake,
because this group received only purified drinking water.
Triglyceride levels in the MC group were significantly greater
(ùëÉ < 0.01) than in the CG group; however, no significantly
different results were found in any group for either glucose or
cholesterol levels.
3.2. Effect of Dietary Oils on Metabolic Change Biochemical
Indicators. The effect of olive and avocado oils on biochemical indicators in rats with metabolic changes induced by
sucrose ingestion after the administration of experimental
diets for 4 weeks is shown in Table 4.
MC group triglyceride levels increased significantly (ùëÉ <
0.05), at least 3.7 times with respect to the CG group. On
the contrary, MCao, MCac, and MCas groups exhibited
reduced levels, although not significant compared to MC
and not reaching the lower CG levels. As for phospholipids,
the MC group showed significantly increased levels (ùëÉ <
0.05) compared to CG; however, in MCao, MCac, and MCas
groups, no significant change was observed when compared
to MC, but their results were significantly higher (ùëÉ < 0.05)

when compared to CG. LDL levels in MCao and MCac groups
did not show significant differences with respect to CG, but
there was a very significant increase (ùëÉ < 0.01) in the MC
group, much more than the increase (ùëÉ < 0.05) in the
MCas group. VLDL in the MC group increased 3.6 times in
comparison to CG levels and no significant decrease from
there was observed in MCao, MCac, and MCas groups, all
still significantly higher (ùëÉ < 0.05) than CG. Significantly
different results were not found for any group in the cases of
glucose, cholesterol, or high-density lipoproteins (HDL).
3.3. Effect of Dietary Oils on Myocardial Injury Indicators. The
effect of dietary olive and avocado oils on myocardial injury
indicators in rats with metabolic changes induced by sucrose
ingestion is shown in Table 5.
A highly significant increase (ùëÉ < 0.01) of hs-CRP serum
levels was observed in the MC group, almost double CG
values. The MCao group managed to revert the change in
these levels somewhat (ùëÉ < 0.05), while MCac and MCas
groups completely returned to CG values. Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) levels did not show any
significant differences for any study group compared to CG;
however, in MCao, MCac, and MCas groups, CK levels did
fall below CG values.

4. Discussion
Metabolic changes are associated with a number of diseases,
including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and

other abnormalities of importance related to their development. These are grouped into different profiles, such as liver,
pancreatic, and cardiovascular functions.
Within this framework, in the present study, significant
differences were found for MC groups as compared to the
CG group in final body weight and weight gain, which were
significantly higher (6 and 11%, resp.), although food intake
was significantly lower (54%). These results are consistent
with those reported in other studies where metabolic changes
were induced by the administration of a sucrose-rich diet
in addition to an experimental diet causing changes in the
biochemical indicators measured [17, 18]. In relation to serum
biochemical indicators associated with the development of
metabolic abnormality, it was found that glucose and cholesterol concentrations in MC group rats were similar to those
in the CG group and not significant. Reaven and Chang [19]
have suggested that this is due to hyperinsulinemia developed
in metabolic abnormalities which maintains normal levels
of blood glucose. TG levels were significantly higher (56%)
in MC group rats (a 2.3 fold increase). Other studies have
found similar results [20, 21]; Piatti et al. [22] reported the
association in healthy patients between sudden TG elevation
and insulin resistance and suggested that the increase in
blood TG in vivo inhibits glucose utilization and oxidation
stimulated by insulin action in the peripheral tissues. One
way to explain blood TG elevation might be to consider a
possible increase in the reesterification of fatty acids from the
liver as a result of fructose metabolism, as reported by Bezerra
et al. [20]; this monosaccharide stems from sucrose hydrolysis

Disease Markers
and in the liver, fatty acids are mainly used for the HDL and
TG synthesis, which in turn raise serum levels.
Few studies have evaluated the influence of avocado
oil as a dietary fat on the lipid profile and lipoprotein
metabolism, specifically in animal models with manifestations of metabolic disorders. This study found that the dietary
intake of olive oil and avocado oil extracted by centrifugation
or solvent exerted little or no effect on glucose, cholesterol,
and HDL levels, there being no significant changes in the
circulating levels of these indicators for any study group.
Among the most important effects observed in this
experiment is the significant elevation of TG levels in the
MC group, at least 3.8-fold compared with the CG group, a
phenomenon reversed with the subsequent administration of
olive oil or avocado extracted by centrifugation or solvent.
This effect is attributed to the ingestion of a high amount
of sucrose in the drinking water and is a feature of the
metabolic disorder [23], since several studies demonstrate
that high carbohydrate intake is associated with increased
TG levels [24]. On the other hand, the MCao, MCac, and
MCas groups were able to reduce TG levels significantly (20,
20, and 27%, resp.) compared to the MC group, although
without reaching the lower levels of the CG group. These
data are consistent with previous findings by Lerman-Garber
et al. [9], Carranza et al. [25], and LoÃÅpez Ledesma et al.
[26], who showed that a diet supplemented with avocado oil
for 30 days in diabetic subjects with induced dyslipidemia
decreased TG levels by 20, 41.3, and 28.9%, respectively.
In addition, the observations reported in this study add
support to those postulated by PoÃÅveda et al. [27], which
indicate that oils rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and
micronutrients may help lower TG levels and reduce the
unfavorable response in the lipid profile observed with
saturated fatty acids. Phospholipids maintained a similar
percentage increase (4, 2, and 0%) in the MCao, MCas, and
MCac groups, with respect to the SG group, and showed no
significant effect on this indicator; however, their levels were
all significantly higher, by 33, 30, and 28%, respectively, in
relation to the CG group. Other researchers have reported
that, although olive oil has a hypocholesterolemic effect on
the serum lipid profile [28], there is some evidence to suggest
that it does not significantly affect the profile of heart or
erythrocyte phospholipids [29]. On the other hand, it has
been found that avocado oil supplementation in rats increases
the phospholipid fraction in HDL as a surface component
[30]; the present study shows that avocado oil, while being
a crude oil high in micronutrients, also has a significant
percentage of monounsaturated fatty acids (18:1N9 oleic: 54‚Äì
59%), which could explain its effect to increase phospholipid
levels.
It has been established that the consumption of olive oil
reduces cholesterol bound to LDL (LDL-C) when replacing
a source of saturated fat or one high in carbohydrates [9,
31]. This effect has been demonstrated with oils rich in
monounsaturated fatty acids; however, it is not exclusive to
olive oil and is also produced by other oils rich in oleic acid,
such as avocado oil. This study confirmed that olive oil very
significantly decreased (28%) LDL levels in the MCao group
and that avocado oil extracted by centrifugation (MCac) or

5
solvent (MCas) reduced very significantly and significantly
these levels, by 26 and 23%, respectively, compared with MC
group levels.
It is well known that among the relevant mechanisms of
atherosclerosis pathogenesis are the oxidation of low-density
lipoproteins (LDL) in the artery walls, the proliferation of
smooth muscle cells, endothelial activation, and leucocyte
fixation.
Among the studies linked to these mechanisms and to
the presence of oleic acid are those which relate the type of
fatty acid present in the oils consumed to LDL susceptibility
to oxidation. Parthasarathy et al. [32] demonstrated that LDL
particles rich in oleic acid are markedly more resistant to
oxidative changes. This has been corroborated by Abbey et
al. [33] and Reaven et al. [34] where this same particle type
presented greater resistance to ex vitro oxidation than those
rich in linoleic acid. Moreover, Mata et al. [35] reported that
supplementation with monounsaturated fatty acids produces
a reduction in the synthesis of smooth muscle cells in
cell cultivations incubated with human serum. Studies with
endothelial cells showed that oleic acid inhibits endothelial
activation analysed through VCAM-1 expression (vascular
cell adhesion molecule-1) [36]. Carluccio et al. [37] suggested
that oleic acid contributes to atherosclerosis prevention by
replacing the saturated fatty acids of cell membrane phospholipids and by modulating the genetic expression of molecules
implicated in monocyte capture.
Based on all the above, it is possible to link the oleic acid
present in both olive and avocado oils used in this study to
the variety of mechanisms mentioned.
On the other hand, it is possible that part of the
hypocholesterolemic effect observed is due to changes in the
metabolism of LDL lipoproteins caused by the ingestion of
avocado oil in the diet, an effect related on the one hand
to the type of fat and, on the other, to the concentration
of biologically active microcomponents acting additively or
synergistically and not simply as isolated components [38].
Experimental data indicate that polyphenols from virgin
and extra virgin oils might additionally influence lipid
metabolism, thus reducing HMG-CoA reductase activity and
modifying lipid values [39].
The intake of olive oil (MCao) and avocado oil extracted
by centrifugation (MCac) or solvent (MCas) significantly
decreased (17, 19, and 22%, resp.) the VLDL levels when
compared to the SG group. On the other hand, supplementing
a diet with avocado oil not only lowers LDL but also TG
associated with VLDL. As it appears, in comparison with
olive oil, the crude avocado oil components may be the cause
of this metabolic effect in the liver, reducing triglyceriderich lipoproteins biosynthesis. These observations have been
confirmed in previous studies [40, 41].
Metabolic changes did not affect LDH levels; although
the levels of this enzyme decreased (9.8%) in the MC group,
their values were not significantly different compared to
those in the CG group. In the olive oil group (MCao),
LDH levels were reduced by 14% (3446 versus 2974 U/L),
whereas in the avocado oil groups extracted by centrifugation
(MCac) or solvent (MCas), LDH levels decreased by 77%
and increased by 4%, respectively, compared with the MC

group. Moreover, in all groups, the olive oil (MCao) and
avocado oil extracted by centrifugation (MCac) or solvent
(MCas) groups, LDH levels decreased by 22, 79, and 6.5%,
respectively, in comparison with CG group, but no significant
effect was observed because the values of this indicator
overlapped with those in the CG group (2974, 802, and 3573
versus 3820 U/L, resp.).
Regarding CK, it was observed that the metabolic abnormality did not significantly affect its levels. The SG group had
decreased CK levels (32%) as compared to the CG group;
the olive oil group (MCao) exhibited decreased enzyme levels
well below those in the CG and MC groups (55 and 35%, resp.)
and a decrease of 46 and 55%, respectively, when compared to
MCac and MCas data. It should be noted that although both
olive oil and avocado oil groups had decreased CK levels, no
significant effect was observed when compared with MC and
CG groups.
Serum levels of hs-CRP in the MC group showed a very
significant increase (1.76 times) compared to the CG group.
This is consistent with other studies in humans, since it has
been reported that hs-CRP levels are increased in subjects
with signs of health disorders from metabolic abnormality
[42]; this increase may also heighten the risk of cardiovascular disease [43]. Nevertheless, the olive oil group (MCao)
reversed hs-CRP levels, almost reaching CG group levels (1.8
versus 1.7 U/L) but still with a 5.5% significant difference.
Meanwhile, avocado oil extracted by centrifugation (MCac)
or solvent (MCas) groups reduced hs-CRP levels even more
than olive oil so as to attain levels statistically similar to
the CG group (1.5 and 1.5 versus 1.7 mg/dL, resp.). As can
be observed, both olive oil and avocado oil extracted by
centrifugation or solvent reversed the metabolic changes
induced by sucrose ingestion significantly and very significantly reducing hs-CRP levels by 40% in the MCao group
and by 50% in the MCac and MCas groups, respectively, as
compared with the MC group. It has been shown that oils rich
in monounsaturated fatty acids do not increase hs-CRP levels
[44]; instead, these are lowered in subjects who consume
a Mediterranean diet, where the main source of monounsaturated fatty acids is olive oil [45]. Other studies show
that elevated hs-CRP levels are directly related to infectious
processes, inflammatory response, steatosis, cardiovascular
disease, prevalence, and risk of arteriosclerotic ventricular
thrombosis [42, 46‚Äì48]; this is why the use of hs-CRP has
been proposed in prognostic stratification in subjects having
health disorders with metabolic abnormalities [49].
The inflammatory response and its relationship with
atherosclerosis-cardiovascular risk is well demonstrated;
however, it is still under discussion if the measurement
of increased levels of hs-CRP consistently and significantly
predict cardiovascular risk from a clinical point of view [50].
In the present case, one possible explanation of a decrease
in hs-CRP (an inflammation biomarker) in a diet with olive
or avocado oil (obtained by any method) could be related to
cytokine inhibition observed in diets with a high oleic acid
content [51], considering that interleukin 6 sets off hepatocyte
hs-CRP synthesis [52].
To the best of our knowledge, these markers have not been
evaluated in rat models where metabolic changes induced by

sucrose ingestion are associated with liver damage caused by
abnormalities in liver function. A concentration of normally
metabolized molecules occurs which can have a detrimental
effect on health, hence the importance of these findings in the
study of the effect of dietary oils such as from avocados.
In conclusion, the results suggest that avocado oil and its
antioxidant content place it as a potential oil to be used as
one of the preventive factors of metabolic syndrome since
it reduces TG, LDL, and VLDL levels, significantly so in
the case of LDL, without affecting HDL levels. Furthermore
the results indicate that avocado oil exerts effects similar to
olive oil, and that the type of extraction exerts an effect on
only one of the biochemical indicators analyzed. It has also
been found that avocado oil extracted by centrifugation or
solvent decreases hs-CRP levels, indicating that inflammatory processes have been at least partially reversed, probably
because the manifestation time of metabolic change was very
short. Further studies are needed to elucidate the effects on
cardiovascular risk profile and inflammatory markers and
establish the optimal time of avocado oil supplementation
in rats with sucrose-induced metabolic changes, as well as
the 18:1N9 specific action on human phospholipid fraction
biosynthesis in HDL as a surface component.
