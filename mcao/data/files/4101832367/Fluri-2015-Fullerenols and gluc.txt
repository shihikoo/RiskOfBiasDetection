Cerebral inﬂammation plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke and is involved in all stages
of the ischemic cascade. Fullerene derivatives, such as fullerenol (OH-F) are radical scavengers acting as neuroprotective agents while glucosamine (GlcN) attenuates cerebral inﬂammation after stroke. We created novel
glucosamine–fullerene conjugates (GlcN-F) to combine their protective effects and compared them to OH-F
regarding stroke-induced cerebral inﬂammation and cellular damage. Fullerene derivatives or vehicle was
administered intravenously in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats
(SHR) immediately after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Infarct size was determined at
day 5 and neurological outcome at days 1 and 5 after tMCAO. CD68- and NeuN-staining were performed to
determine immunoreactivity and neuronal survival respectively. Cytokine and toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4)
expression was assessed using quantitative real-time PCR. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a signiﬁcant
reduction of infarct volume in both, WKY and SHR that were treated with fullerene derivatives. Treated rats
showed an amelioration of neurological symptoms as both OH-F and GlcN-F prevented neuronal loss in the
perilesional area. Cerebral immunoreactivity was reduced in treated WKY and SHR. Expression of IL-1β and
TLR-4 was attenuated in OH-F-treated WKY rats. In conclusion, OH-F and GlcN-F lead to a reduction of cellular
damage and inﬂammation after stroke, rendering these compounds attractive therapeutics for stroke.

Inﬂammation has been recognized as a key contributor to the
pathophysiology of ischemic stroke (Moskowitz et al., 2010). There is
growing evidence that inﬂammatory processes are involved in all stages
of the ischemic cascade, from the early intravascular events after arterial
occlusion to the late regenerative alterations leading to brain damage
and tissue repair (Iadecola and Anrather, 2011). Immediately after
interruption of blood supply, reactive oxygen species (ROS) trigger the
coagulation cascade and lead to the activation of complement
(i.e., complement C3), platelet and endothelial cells (Eltzschig and
Carmeliet, 2011; Peerschke et al., 2010; Song et al., 2006). Proinﬂammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines are rapidly

F. Fluri et al. / Experimental Neurology 265 (2015) 142–151

generated (Iadecola and Anrather, 2011). As the ischemic cascade
progresses, cell death leads to a new phase of inﬂammatory response
(Iadecola and Anrather, 2011). Ischemic cell death leads to activation
of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) that in turn activates pathways linked to
the transcription of many pro-inﬂammatory gene encoding cytokines
such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).
Hence, modulation of inﬂammatory processes after stroke might exert
a protective effect on ischemic brain tissue and therefore might be a
promising new stroke therapy.
C60 fullerenes, comprised of 60 carbon atoms conﬁgured as a hollow
sphere, are candidate therapeutic agents because they exert multiple
effects on the ischemic cascade (Chiang et al., 1995; Jin et al., 2000)
and therefore, fullerene-derivatives might inﬂuence cerebral ischemia
(Lin et al., 2002). When appropriately modiﬁed, fullerenes can pass
the blood–brain barrier (Yamago et al., 1995). Fullerenols are hydroxylated fullerenes that are neuroprotective because they scavenge free
radicals (Fig. S1 in the online-only data supplement) (Chiang et al.,
1995). Furthermore, fullerenols inhibit glutamate channels resulting in
a reduction in glutamate-induced intracellular calcium (Jin et al.,
2000), preventing cell death. Another neuroprotective agent is glucosamine (GlcN) which reduces the immune response after ischemic
stroke by inhibiting nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) (Hwang et al., 2010).
Since the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR)
committee recommends investigating neuroprotective drugs in animals
with a cerebrovascular risk factor (Fisher et al., 2009) spontaneously
hypertensive rats (SHR) were considered as an appropriate rat strain
to investigate the effect of fullerene derivatives; additionally, this strain
allows for comparing drug effects to “healthy” i.e., normotensive
Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (Liu et al., 2009).
Here we show that intravenously administered polyhydroxylated
fullerene reduces infarct size and inhibits cerebral inﬂammation in
normotensive and hypertensive rats after ischemic stroke. In addition,
glucosamine–fullerene conjugates potentiate the neuroprotective effects of fullerene.
Methods
Animals
A total number of 43 male SHR and 24 male WKY rats (Charles River,
Sulzfeld, Germany), weighing 250 to 300 g, were used throughout this
study. Animal experimentation was approved by the Veterinäramt
Zürich (approval number 148/2009) and is adherent to the NIH Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Weight of each animal
was measured before surgery and decapitation (Table I in the onlineonly data supplement). Rats were anesthetized with 2.5% isoﬂurane in
70% N20/30% O2 during the surgery and were monitored for physiological parameters that could affect stroke outcome (Tables II and III in the
online-only data supplement).
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO)
Temporary focal cerebral ischemia was induced by a 60 min
occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery according to the method of
Longa et al. (1989). Thereafter, the animals were allowed to recover
from anesthesia. Rats were euthanized 5 days after tMCAO for histological analyses. Animals without infarction, detected 24 h after tMCAO,
were excluded from the study. We performed surgery and evaluation
of all readout parameters while being blinded to the experimental
groups.
Application of OH-F and GlcN-F in animals
OH-F 0.5 mg/kg was administered intravenously in WKY (n = 10)
and SHR (n = 10) immediately after reperfusion and compared
with controls of each strain. To achieve a greater reduction of

143

infarction in SHR, 1.0 mg/kg (n = 7) and 2.0 mg/kg (n = 7) were administered in animals of this strain. GlcN-F was injected in SHR at
doses of 0.5 mg/kg and 5.0 mg/kg.
Neurological score
Neurological evaluation was performed for all animals one day and
ﬁve days after tMCAO induction. Each animal was assigned only one
score, indicating the worst symptom even if the animal showed others,
i.e., less severe symptoms. All animals (untreated WKY rats: n = 10;
WKY rats treated with 0.5 mg/kg OH-F: n = 10; untreated SHR: n =
10; SHR treated with 0.5 mg/kg OH-F: n = 10; SHR treated with 5.0
mg/kg GlcN-F: n = 10) were scored as follows (Gerriets et al., 2004):
0 = no neurologic deﬁcits; 1 = contralateral forelimb ﬂexion; 2 = inconstant contralateral circling or contralateral circling after tail pull;
3 = spontaneously contralateral circling; 4 = falling to the right; and
5 = no spontaneous walking with depressed level of consciousness.
Cerebral MRI and measurement of infarct volume
Five days after tMCAO, MRI was conducted with a 4.7 T/16 cm
Bruker Pharma Scan tomograph (Bruker Bio Spin AG, Fällanden/
Switzerland). T2-weighted (T2w) spin-echo imaging was used to map
lesion and hemispheric volumes. Lesion size was determined on T2w
using ImageJ Analysis Software 1.45 s (National Institutes of Health,
USA; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).
Immunohistochemistry
Coronal cryosections (8 μm thick) were cut at 400 μm intervals using
a cryostat (Hyrax C60, Zeiss, Switzerland) and mounted on Superfrost
Plus slides (Menzel, Braunschweig/Germany). Sections were stained
with antibodies directed against NeuN (1:500, Millipore, Zug/
Switzerland), CD68 (1:250, Serotec Ltd, Düsseldorf/Germany) and
MAP-2 (1:2000 Abcam, ab32454, Abcam plc,Cabrindge/UK). CD68+
cell density was measured on ten ﬁelds of view in three consecutive
sections of the perilesional zone of the caudate putamen using an
Olympus microscope (Olympus, BX61, Volketswil/Switzerland).
NeuN+ cell count was quantiﬁed on ﬁve ﬁelds of view in three consecutive sections.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT PCR) was performed on an Applied
Biosystems Fast 7500 system (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies,
Zug/Switzerland). Using TaqMan gene expression assays, qRT-PCR of
interleukin 1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), complement
C3 and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) was performed according to the
manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Zug/
Switzerland).
Statistical analyses
We used multiple linear regression analysis to estimate associations
between infarct volume and both treatment with 0.5 mg/kg OH-F (yes/
no) and strain (SHR/WKY) as independent variables. A key question for
this study was whether treatment with 0.5 mg/kg OH-F confers a smaller reduction in infarct volume among SHR compared to WKY rats. To
address this question, we added to our model a covariate for the interaction between treatment with 0.5 mg/kg OH-F and strain. The estimate
for this interaction shows how the association between infarct volume
and treatment changes at higher blood pressure values. Prior to model
ﬁtting, we logarithm-transformed the infarct volume to achieve a
multiplicative model for infarct volume when transformed back to the
original units. Note that the geometric mean is found as the anti-log of

144

F. Fluri et al. / Experimental Neurology 265 (2015) 142–151

the mean of logarithm-transformed values. For our analysis, we report
estimated geometric mean ratios with 95% conﬁdence intervals.
The effect on infarct volume with the administration of higher doses
of OH-F (1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg, respectively) and of GlcN-F, as well as
comparisons between treatment groups in regard to neurological
deﬁcits, anti-inﬂammatory properties, immunoreactivity, neuronal
survival and cell proliferation were addressed with descriptive and
exploratory statistics.
For immunostaining, we calculated the mean of all cell counts/
area within one animal to obtain a single summary measure per animal.
P-values were calculated using the U-test. A level of P b 0.05 was
considered signiﬁcant.
We used R version 3.0.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria) and the R add-on package lattice version 0.20-21
(Sarkar, 2008) for our analyses and graphics, respectively.
Results
Infarct volume is reduced after OH-F and GlcN-F treatments in WKY rats
and SHR
Initial studies on neuroprotective agents in experimental stroke
should demonstrate positive effects in “healthy” animals (Fisher et al.,
2009). Therefore, we assessed the effect of fullerenol (OH-F) [C60(OH)
34-36] on infarct volume in WKY rats without additional comorbidities,

such as arterial hypertension. A total of 20 WKY rats underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) for 60 min. Thereafter,
0.5 mg/kg OH-F in 2.5 mL NaCl (0.9% in water) was administered to
10 WKY rats within 5 min after recirculation. Another 10 WKY rats received 2.5 mL NaCl (0.9% in water) within 5 min of recirculation after
tMCAO, and served as a control group. Infarct volume was quantiﬁed
non-invasively with T2w MRI ﬁve days after tMCAO. In control WKY
rats, infarction was detected in the left caudate putamen and partly in
the cortex, whereas in six of ten OH-F-treated WKY rats, infarction
was restricted to the left caudate putamen (Fig. 1). The median infarct
volume of control and OH-F-treated WKY rats was 104 mm3 (interquartile range [IQR] 95, 140) and 36 mm3 (IQR 26, 42) respectively (Figs. 1
and 2A).
Unlike this animal model, stroke patients suffer from different
comorbidities, of which arterial hypertension is the most important.
Therefore, we performed the same experiment in hypertensive rats,
i.e., SHR, treating the animals either with 0.5 mg/kg OH-F (n = 10)
or 0.9% NaCl (n = 10, one died during the tMCAO) within 5 min of
recirculation after tMCAO. Weight-matched SHR were chosen because
they are selectively bred from the WKY strain. In both the control and
OH-F-treated SHR, infarction was observed in the left caudate putamen
and the cortex using MRI (T2w) ﬁve days after tMCAO. The median
infarct volume of the control and OH-F-treated SHR was 267 mm3
(IQR 266, 284) and 213 mm3 (IQR 180, 220) respectively (Figs. 1
and 2B).

and treated SHR and untreated WKY rats, whereas in six of ten OH-F-treated WKY rats infarction was restricted to the left caudate putamen only. Infarct area was traced manually on 17
consecutive coronal brain sections (1 mm thick) using image analysis software (Image J 64, National Institutes of Health, USA) and infarct volume was calculated by summing up the areas
from all slices.

(n = 10), 1.0 mg/kg OH-F (n = 5) and 2.0 mg/kg OH-F (n = 4) as well as SHR treated with GlcN-F at doses of 0.5 mg/kg (n = 7) and 5.0 mg/kg (n = 8) respectively. The black dot indicates
the median infarct volume of one group.

As shown by multivariable analysis, SHR had an increased infarct
volume compared with WKY rats (geometric mean ratio of 2.46; 95%
conﬁdence interval [CI] 1.81, 3.34; P b 0.001). Treatment with 0.5
mg/kg OH-F had a smaller effect on infarct volume reduction in SHR
compared with WKY rats (geometric mean ratio for interaction 2.33;
95% CI 1.54, 3.53; P b 0.001). Relative to their untreated controls, treatment with 0.5 mg/kg OH-F was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction
in infarct volume for both WKY rats (geometric mean ratio of 0.32;
95% CI 0.23, 0.42; P b 0.001) and SHR (geometric mean ratio of 0.74;
95% CI 0.55, 0.98; P = 0.038). Treatment with 0.5 mg/kg OH-F led to a
reduction in infarct volume of 68% (95% CI 58%, 77%; P b 0.001) in
WKY rats and of 26% (95% CI 2%, 45%; P = 0.038) in SHR. Importantly,
untreated SHR had a 146% increase in infarct volume (95% CI 81%,
234%; P b 0.001) compared to untreated WKY rats, supporting the
notion that increased blood pressure has a negative impact on brain
damage after ischemic stroke (McCabe et al., 2009).
To investigate whether a further reduction of infarct volume in
the SHR model could be achieved by increasing the OH-F dose, two
additional doses of OH-F, namely 1.0 mg/kg (n = 7) and 2.0 mg/kg
(n = 7), were intravenously administered within 5 min after reperfusion and compared with the effect of 0.5 mg/kg OH-F on infarct volume
in SHR. Five days after tMCAO, median infarct volume in SHR treated
with 1.0 mg/kg (n = 5) and with 2.0 mg/kg (n = 5; exclusion of one
animal without detectable infarct) was 214 mm3 (IQR 163, 227) and
200 mm3 (IQR 173, 217) respectively (Fig. 2B). In summary, higher
OH-F doses had no impact on infarct volume. However, adverse
reactions such as nasal and periocular overproduction of porphyrine
and writhing and stretching of the trunk were more severe in the SHR
treated with either 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg OH-F than in animals receiving
the lower dose. Additionally, two SHR treated with 1.0 mg/kg and two
treated with 2.0 mg/kg died within 48 h, whereas all ten SHR treated
with 0.5 mg/kg survived. Based on these observations, all further experiments were conducted with 0.5 mg/kg OH-F.
Treatment with OH-F, known as a strong radical scavenger (Chiang
et al., 1995), had a limited effect on reducing the infarct volume in
SHR, suggesting that cerebral inﬂammation after ischemic stroke may
be crucial for infarct evolution. Anti-inﬂammatory properties have, so
far, not been associated with OH-F, therefore we conjugated fullerene
to glucosamine (GlcN), which exerts anti-inﬂammatory effects
(Hwang et al., 2010). Glucosamine–fullerene (GlcN-F) [C60(GlcN)12]

was intravenously administered at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg in SHR (n = 7)
within 5 min after a tMCAO of 60 min. However, 0.5 mg/kg GlcN
contains only about 10% of fullerene compared with the same dose of
OH-F and we hypothesized that fullerene may contribute to the overall
neuroprotective effect in combination with GlcN. Therefore, a second
series of experiments was conducted in SHR (n = 8) with 5.0 mg/kg
GlcN-F, which contains an equivalent amount of fullerene as 0.5
mg/kg, enabling a better comparison of the two molecules. In all SHR
treated with either 0.5 mg/kg or 5.0 mg/kg GlcN-F, infarction was
observed both in the left caudate putamen and partly in the cortex
(Fig. 1). Median infarct volume in SHR treated with 0.5 and 5.0 mg/kg
GlcN-F was 211 mm3 (IQR 207, 232) and 172 mm3 (IQR 160, 191)
respectively (Fig. 2B). Thus, GlcN-F-treatment resulted in greater
reduction of infarct volume than OH-F-treatment at the two different
doses we tested.
GlcN-F is detectable in the ischemic brain area
The ability of neuroprotective agents to cross the blood–brain
barrier (BBB), i.e., to reach the ischemic area where they should act is
crucial for successful neuroprotection. Passing the BBB depends on
hydrophilic and lipophilic properties of a molecule. NXY-059 for example did not pass the BBB easily probably because of its high solubility in
water (Kuroda et al., 1999) which might have contributed to the lack of
neuroprotection in the clinical trials. Therefore, we aimed to detect
GlcN-F in the ischemic area as early as 2 h after induction of cerebral
ischemia. One hour after tMCAO, GlcN-F was administered intravenously and 1 h later, brains were harvested and immediately frozen.
Coronal sections (10 μm thick) were cut and exposed against a phosphor image plate (Biostep, Jahnsdorf, Germany) overnight. We found
an accumulation of the 68Ga-labeled GlcN-F (68Ga-GlcN-F) in the
ischemic area of the brain, indicating that the compound has passed
the BBB (Fig. 3).
Neurological symptoms improve after treatment with OH-F and GlcN-F
Clinical trials judge drug efﬁcacy by using neurological and/or functional outcomes rather than infarct volume. Therefore, we assessed
therapeutic efﬁcacy by scoring the WKY rats treated with 0.5 mg/kg
OH-F, the corresponding control WKY rats, the SHR treated with either

0.5 mg/kg OH-F or 5.0 mg/kg GlcN-F, and the control SHR on days one
and ﬁve after recirculation (Fig. 4). A six-point scoring system (modiﬁed
according to Gerriets) was used (Gerriets et al., 2004). All rats received a
single score indicating the worst symptom.
For all untreated control WKY rats, infarction after tMCAO led to
impairment of motor function with a range of severity. Weak impairments were contralateral forelimb ﬂexion (score 1), and contralateral
circling after tail pull (score 2). More severe symptoms were spontaneously contralateral circling (score 3) and falling to the right side (score
4). These behaviors were observed in nearly all untreated WKY rats,
and in some cases, animals were no longer able to walk spontaneously
(score 5). Overall, WKY rats treated with 0.5 mg/kg OH-F developed
less severe neurological deﬁcits (score 0 and 1). After one day, only
two of the treated WKY rats exhibited impairment of motor function
(score: 1), and this was resolved after ﬁve days (score 0; Fig. 4A).
Initially, tMCAO in untreated control SHR had a similar outcome to
untreated WKY rats; all animals had a clinical score between 1 and 4
after the ﬁrst day. However, after ﬁve days spontaneous amelioration
of the neurological deﬁcits was observed. Previously, rodents have
been reported to spontaneously recover from motor dysfunction
(Reglodi et al., 2003), probably due to recruitment of the undamaged
hemisphere (Biernaskie et al., 2005). Treatment with 0.5 mg/kg OH-F
and with 5.0 mg/kg GlcN-F revealed a general improvement of motor
function in SHR with only residual motor deﬁcits after ﬁve days
(Fig. 4B). Therefore, in this animal model, OH-F and GlcN-F-treatments

lead to a positive outcome after ischemic stroke, indicated by reduced
lesion volume and amelioration of motor deﬁcits.

OH-F and GlcN-F ameliorate post-stroke cerebral inﬂammation
The cellular immune response in the infarcted area is characterized
by activated microglia and inﬁltrating macrophages. Both cell types
present CD68 and therefore can be visualized by anti-CD68immunostaining. To investigate the anti-inﬂammatory properties of
OH-F and GlcN-F, we measured the degree of CD68-immunoreactivity
in the affected caudate putamen of untreated and treated SHR and
WKY rats, using fresh frozen acetone-ﬁxed coronal brain sections
(8 μm thick). Since infarction was conﬁned to the caudate putamen in
all WKY rats, we did not assess CD68-immunoreactivity in the cortex.
CD68-immunoreactivity was expressed as the ratio of the area of
CD68-immunostained cells to the non-stained area per ﬁeld of view.
In OH-F-treated WKY rats, CD68-immunoreactivity was reduced by
44% compared to control animals (P = 0.030; Figs. 5A and C). Similarly,
SHR treated with 0.5 mg/kg OH-F displayed a reduction in CD68immunoreactivity of 24% compared with control animals (P = 0.15;
Figs. 5B and D). GlcN-F treatment of SHR, however, led to a strong and
signiﬁcant (40%) reduction in CD68-immunoreactivity (P = 0.008;
Figs. 5B and D), conﬁrming that this molecule is a more effective antiinﬂammatory agent.

Fig. 4. Neurological scores of WKY rats and SHR, treated with either OH-F or GlcN-F compared to controls at day 1 (A) and day 5 (B) after tMCAO. A 6-point score was used (modiﬁed
according to Gerriets): (Gerriets et al., 2004) 0 = no neurological deﬁcits, 1 = contralateral forelimb ﬂexion, 2 = contralateral circling after tail pull, 3 = spontaneously contralateral
circling, 4 = falling to the right; 5 = no spontaneous walking. % gradient indicates the % of the experimental group population graded with a score.

Effects of OH-F and GlcN-F on the expression of inﬂammatory
molecules following cerebral ischemia were measured using qRT PCR
to track changes in the expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, complement C3
and TLR-4. In WKY rats, treatment with OH-F resulted in a 49.2%
reduction in expression of IL-1β (P = 0.032; Fig. 6A, Table IV in the

online-only data supplement), and to a 31.8% decrease in expression
of TLR-4 (P = 0.035; Fig. 6B, Table IV in the online-only data supplement) as well as C3-expression (54.8%, P = 0.115; Fig. 6C, Table VI in
the online-only data supplement), both relative to controls. TNF-αexpression was unaffected (Fig. 6D, Table IV in the online-only data

supplement). In SHR, treatment with either 0.5 mg/kg OH-F or 5.0
mg/kg GlcN-F did not affect the expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, complement
C3 or TLR-4 (Figs. 6A–D).
OH-F-and GlcN-F-treatments result in enhanced neuronal survival
To determine whether OH-F and GlcN-F protect neurons from death
after ischemic stroke, the neuronal marker neuron-speciﬁc nuclear
protein (NeuN) was immunostained in samples of brain tissue. Speciﬁcally, three consecutive coronal brain tissue sections localized at the
stereotaxic level of the Bregma (i.e., where the caudate putamen is
also localized) were analyzed; in each of these three sections, ﬁve
regions of interest were selected. In OH-F-treated WKY rats, 47.6%
more NeuN+ cells were detected in the subcortical perilesional area
(i.e., penumbra) compared with control WKY rats (P = 0.002; Figs. 7A
and C). In SHR, GlcN-F-treatment resulted in 46.4% more NeuN+ cells
in the subcortical perilesional area than in control SHR (P = 0.008;
Figs. 7B and D). In control and OH-F treated SHR, no difference
concerning NeuN+ cells was observed (6.7%; P = 0.67; Figs. 7B and D).
Discussion
In the present study, the effects of hydroxylated and glucosamineconjugated fullerenes on cerebral infarction and on post-ischemic
cerebral inﬂammation have been investigated for the ﬁrst time in
normo- and hypertensive rats. Intravenously administered OH-F

signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume and attenuated cerebral inﬂammation by reducing the expression of IL-1β and TLR-4 in WKY rats
compared to controls. This anti-inﬂammatory effect of OH-F is a novel
ﬁnding and – together with its reported scavenging properties
(Chiang et al., 1995) – might contribute to the reduction of infarct
volume. In contrast, OH-F-treatment (0.5 mg/kg) in SHR reduced the
infarct volume less than in WKY rats even after increasing the dose of
OH-F to 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg. This ﬁnding is in line with studies where the
efﬁcacy in the context of comorbidity was also substantially lower
(Howells et al., 2010). The different responses of SHR and WKY rats to
OH-F may be the result of a more pronounced microglial response to
focal ischemia in hypertensive rats when compared to WKY rats
(Marks et al., 2001). Since GlcN suppresses microglia activation and
macrophage accumulation (Hwang et al., 2010) in the post-ischemic
brain, we synthesized a novel fullerene–glucosamine conjugate to
potentiate the effects of each component. In fact, GlcN-F (5.0 mg/kg)
reduced the infarct volume in SHR signiﬁcantly when compared to
control SHR. However, GlcN-F-treatment reduced the infarct volume
only slightly more than OH-F-treatment in SHR. Anatomical and
morphological differences between the cerebral vasculature of these
two strains may play key roles in the evolution of ischemic infarction
(Jiménez-Altayó et al., 2007). Furthermore, SHR reveal a smaller
penumbra when compared to normotensive rats (McCabe et al., 2009)
and thus, there is less salvageable ischemic tissue in SHR than in WKY
rats. Nevertheless, both OH-F and GlcN-F have a strong neuroprotective
effect in SHR when compared to the efﬁcacy of the well-studied

neuroprotective drug phenylbutynitrone (NXY-059) (Macleod et al.,
2008; Zhao et al., 2001). NXY-059 signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume
(48%) in normotensive rats but failed to reduce infarct volume signiﬁcantly in SHR (Macleod et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2001). This discrepancy
in the preclinical investigation may have been an early indicator of what
was found in the clinic: NXY-059 failed in the SAINT II trial (Shuaib et al.,
2007).
Clinical examination revealed an early amelioration of neurological
symptoms in OH-F- and GlcN-F-treated animals compared to controls.
Notably, the symptoms improved not only in normotensive but also in
hypertensive animals that were treated. This observation underscores
the strong therapeutic effect of OH-F and GlcN-F as potential treatments
for ischemic stroke and conﬁrms that functional improvement is not
necessarily associated with infarct size in animals (Corbett and Nurse,
1998; Kawamata et al., 1996).
Inﬂammatory processes are involved in the early post-ischemic
period and enhance secondary tissue damage (Iadecola and Anrather,
2011). We observed that OH-F exerted anti-inﬂammatory effects in
WKY rats as demonstrated by a reduction in CD68-immunoreactivity,
either due to activation of fewer microglia and/or less monocyte inﬁltration from the periphery. While OH-F exhibited no anti-inﬂammatory
effect following cerebral ischemia in SHR, GlcN-F signiﬁcantly reduced
the number of CD68-immunoreactive cells in SHR. Since hypertensive
rats typically have a greater degree of cerebral inﬂammation after
cerebral ischemia than normotensive animals (Marks et al., 2001), we
conclude that OH-F is a less-effective anti-inﬂammatory agent than

GlcN-F. The GlcN-moiety is likely the most effective anti-inﬂammatory
component of GlcN-F which supports the recent report that GlcN
administration suppressed microglial activation and macrophage
accumulation in cerebral ischemia of rats (Hwang et al., 2010).
Both, OH-F and GlcN-F suppressed activation of microglia and/or
inﬁltration of macrophages, but only OH-F reduced inﬂammatory
molecules in WKY rats. The reduction of IL-1β, TLR-4, and complement
C3 expression in WKY rats after OH-F treatment is likely a result of
reduced microglia activation in these animals. Both TLR-4 (Jack et al.,
2005) and IL-1β (Allan et al., 2005) are expressed in microglia. A recent
study demonstrated, that TLR-4 is involved in cerebral inﬂammation
and brain damage after stroke (Caso et al., 2007); TLR-4-deﬁcient
mice had minor infarction and a less inﬂammatory response after stroke
(Caso et al., 2007). In stroke patients, serum levels of TLR-4 were
associated to clinical outcome and proposed as a therapeutic target
(Brea et al., 2011). Complement C3, which is also synthesized by
microglia (Haga et al., 1993), is a critical effector of complementmediated ischemic neurotoxicity (Mocco et al., 2006). C3-knockout
mice showed reduced inﬁltrating granulocytes and decreased oxidant
stress levels (Mocco et al., 2006). Altogether, OH-F might affect different
aspects of cerebral inﬂammation.
Reduced cerebral inﬂammation after OH-F and GlcN-F administration may also effectively preserve neurons in the perilesional zone of
the caudate putamen. This observation corroborates a report showing
that functionalized fullerenes prevent neuronal death (Dugan et al.,
1996). Furthermore, our work indicates that OH-F and GlcN-F are not

neurotoxic, even during ischemia when cells are vulnerable. Highly
soluble derivatives of fullerene such as C60(OH)24 are reported to be
less toxic as its pristine form (Sayes et al., 2004).
In conclusion, we demonstrate the anti-inﬂammatory effects of
functionalized fullerenes administered following cerebral ischemia.
Inﬂammation constitutes an attractive target for therapeutic intervention as it plays a key role in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia
by exerting deleterious effects on the progression of tissue damage
(del Zoppo, 2009). However, functionalized fullerenes have been
shown to interfere in other processes of the ischemic cascade such as
oxidative stress and glutamate excitotoxicity rendering functionalized
fullerenes, with their multimodal properties, a promising candidate
for stroke treatment. It remains to be investigated whether simultaneous administration of OH-F and GlcN-F leads to a stronger infarct
reduction in SHR than each compound alone. Efforts to translate these
ﬁndings to humans will commence following further preclinical
evaluations.
