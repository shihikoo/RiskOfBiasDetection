Abstract Epidemiological studies have suggested a differential response, males versus female, in stroke incidence and
prognosis. These divergences in brain response after damage
are based mostly on hormonal differences. To date, estradiol
and progesterone administered independently have demonstrated neuroprotection after ischemia in animal models.
Nonetheless, contradictory results were revealed using a combined administration. In order to evaluate the effects of combinatorial treatment administered after ischemia induction, we
used two different approaches: in vivo and in vitro models.
Male rats which underwent permanent middle cerebral artery
occlusion were treated with a combination of estradiol/
progesterone at 6, 24 and 48 h after injury and sacrificed at
54 h post-ischemia. The rat brains were evaluated for reactive
gliosis, NeuN-positive neurons, levels of synapse-associated
proteins and activity levels of PI3K/Akt/GSK3/β-catenin survival pathway. Also, primary cortical neurons were subjected
to oxygen and glucose deprivation for 17 h and returned to a
normal environment in the presence of estradiol or estradiol/
progesterone. Cell viability was evaluated, and activity levels
of the PI3K/Akt/GSK3/β-catenin pathway. Our results

Introduction
Stroke, a complex neurodegenerative disease, is the leading
cause of disability and the second cause of death in humans
worldwide [1]. Brain injury following an ischemic insult
involves a complex succession of events that cause varying
degrees of cell damage depending, not only on the characteristics of the initial insult, but also on the duration of the
occlusion [2]. It has been accepted that the cell death in the
ischemic core, the most affected area, is triggered by necrosis,
whilst in the peri-infarct region (penumbra) is caused mainly
by apoptosis [3, 2, 4]. Until now, there is no pharmacological
therapy for this disorder except tissue plasminogen activator,
but its use is limited. The middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) is the in vivo model most commonly used to mimic
and analyze the ischemic stroke damage and also the potential
treatments [5]. Epidemiological studies suggest that the stroke
risk is lower and the prognosis of patients is better in premenopausal women than in men. Nonetheless, the incidence of
cerebrovascular diseases increases in women after menopause, being more elevated than in men [1]. On the other
hand, a gender-differential response after ischemic injury has
been demonstrated in animal models of stroke [6, 7].
17β-estradiol (E) and progesterone (P), the main female
sex hormones, play a role in a multitude of physiological
nervous processes acting both on neurons and in glial cells
[8, 9]. They can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 52:1690–1703

diffuse throughout the brain. However, they are considered as
neurosteroids because they can be synthesized by the nervous
system [10]. Nowadays, the neuroprotective effects of both
hormones in different neurodegenerative diseases are well
established [8, 9, 11]. Growing evidence strongly indicates
that estradiol protects against ischemic stroke damage. In fact,
estradiol administration before, during or after ischemia induction reduced the damage area in rodent models [12, 9].
Several mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in the
estradiol neuroprotection against ischemia-induced damage,
such as a reduction in pro-inflammatory events, glutamatemediated excitotoxicity, oxidative damage and apoptosis
[13–15]. However, only a few studies have examined the
potential neuroprotective effect of progesterone, probably because the majority of the studies have focused on estradiol as
the main source of neuroprotection seen in females. The
neuroprotective effect of progesterone against ischemic brain
damage includes decreasing infarct area, inflammation, BBB
permeability and edema in animal models [16].
The detailed molecular mechanisms involved in neuroprotection by estradiol and progesterone are not completely understood. It has been described that both hormones exert their
effects not only at the genomic level through the classical
nuclear receptors, ‘slow responses’, but also by modulating
cytosolic signalling cascades by interacting with membranelocalized and/or cytoplasmic receptors, ‘rapid response’ [11,
8]. These ‘cytoplasmic’ responses may play an important role
in neural cells, especially in neuroprotection.
Moreover, the role of estradiol and progesterone has been
described in synaptic plasticity [17], an important process in
the recovery of brain function after damage [18, 19]. It has
been reported that estradiol alters, through membrane receptors, the phosphorylation levels of synapsin I [20], a presynaptic protein that has a central role in neurotransmitter release,
synaptic formation and maturation [19]. In addition, recent
reports suggest an increase in postsynaptic density protein 95
(PSD95) expression, a postsynaptic protein located mainly at
the glutamatergic synapses, mediated by estradiol [21].
To date, limited studies using a combination of estradiol
and progesterone have been reported and the results obtained
have been contradictory. Some point to the antagonistic effects
between both hormones [22, 23, 17] whilst others report
enhanced effects [24, 25].
In this study, we have analyzed the effect of post-ischemia
estradiol and progesterone (E/P) treatment at physiological
doses 54 h after injury. We performed two different experimental approaches using both in vivo (permanent middle
cerebral artery occlusion, pMCAO) and in vitro (oxygenglucose deprivation (OGD) in cortical neuronal primary culture) models. We have analyzed the effect of E/P postischemic treatments on reactive gliosis and NeuN-positive
neurons. We have also evaluated the impact of this combined
hormone therapy on the PI3K/Akt/GSK3/β-catenin survival

1691

pathway and on specific proteins implicated in synaptic plasticity and functionality (synapsin I, PSD95 and α-N-catenin).
Our findings indicate that the addition of progesterone could
abolish some of the beneficial effects observed previously by
estradiol administration after pMCAO.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Adult male Wistar rats (8–12 weeks old, 250–310 g) obtained
from the vivarium at Centro de Biologia Molecular “Severo
Ochoa” (CBM-SO) were maintained under 12-h light/12-h
dark cycle and with access to food and water ad libitum. All
the animal care protocols were conformed to the appropriate
national legislations (RD 53/2013) and the guidelines of the
European Commission for the accommodation and care of
laboratory animals (revised in Appendix A of the Council of
Europe Convention ETS123). All procedures have the approval of the Bio-Ethical committee of CBM-SO.
Surgery and pMCAO Induction
pMCAO was performed by right middle cerebral artery occlusion using an intraluminal suture as we previously described [13]. Anaesthesia was induced by intraperitoneal injection (ip) of a mixture of medetomidine (250 μg/kg) and
ketamine (75 mg/kg), accompanied by a subcutaneous injection of atropine (100 μg/kg).
Hormonal Administration
A total of 32 male rats were randomly distributed into the
following experimental groups: sham-vehicle (SV, n=8),
ischemia-vehicle (IV, n= 8), sham-estradiol/progesterone
(SEP, n=8) and ischemia estradiol/progesterone (IEP, n=8).
The animals received three doses of 0.04 mg/kg β-estradiol
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA, ref E8875) as we previously
described [13], combined with 4 mg/kg progesterone (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA, ref P7556) [26, 27] in a total volume of
500 μl. Intraperitoneal injections were administrated at 6, 24
and 48 h after pMCAO induction. Groups IV and SV received
500 μl of vehicle (1 % ethanol in saline). All animals were
sacrificed 6 h after the last treatment.
Neurological Deficit Score
The neurological deficit score of each animal was measured
before surgery, and at 6, 24, 48, 54 h after pMCAO induction,
using the method described by Yrjänheikki [28]. A 7-point
scale of neuromotor function was ranked as follows: grade 0,
no spontaneous motion; grade 1, spontaneous circling towards

1692

the paretic side; grade 2, circling towards the paretic side when
pulled by the tail; grade 3, circling towards the paretic side
when pulled and lifted by the tail; grade 4, consistently reduced resistance to a lateral push towards the paretic side;
grade 5, consistent flexion of the forelimb contralateral to the
injured hemisphere; and grade 6, normal extension of both
forelimbs towards the floor when lifted. Other neurological
anomalies were also recorded, such as alterations in balance,
sensorial perception (acoustic, visual localization) and reflex
responses (corneal, palpebral, postural correction). In this
study, we have excluded all the ischemic rats that did not
reach an ischemic damage index (IDI) of 2–3 at 6 h postMCAO.
Western Blotting
Tissue samples were homogenized and analyzed by Western
blots as we previously described [13]. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies:
Akt (1:1000; Cell Signaling no. 9272), phospho-AktSer473
(1:500; Cell Signaling no. 9271), phospho-Akt Thr308
(1:1000; clone C31E5E, Cell Signaling no. 2965), β-catenin
(1:800; BD Transduction Laboratories no. 610,153), βtubulin (1:1000; clone TUB 2.1, Sigma no. T4026), β-actin
(1:1000; clone AC-15, Sigma no. A5441), GSK3 (1:1000;
Biosource no. 44–610), phospho-GSK3Ser21/9 (1:1000; Cell
Signaling no. 9331), synapsin (1:500; Cell Signaling no.
2312), phospho-synapsinSer9 (1:500; Cell Signaling no.
2311), PSD95 (1:1000; Cell Signaling no. 3450) and α-Ncatenin (1:1000; clone C12G4; Cell Signaling no. 2163).
Membranes were rinsed with PBS-Tween and incubated with
appropriate secondary antibodies: anti-rabbit or anti-mouse
IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The density of the
immunoreactive bands was analyzed using Quantity One
software (Bio-Rad; U-Max PowerLook 2100XL scanner)
and the values were normalized to β-tubulin or β-actin levels
detected in the same membrane and compared with control
values (SV). The graphs represent mean±standard error of
mean (±SEM) of 3–5 independent experiments.

48–72 h. Finally, cryoprotected brains were embedded in
Tissue-Tek medium (Sakura, Zoeterwoude, Netherlands).
Coronal cryostat sections (25-μm thick) were collected onto
Superfrost Ultra Plus slides (Thermo Scientific, Braunschweig, Germany), air dried and stored at −20 °C. Sections
located from +2 to −4 relative to bregma [29] were selected for
immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence.
Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence
Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses
were performed in a humidified chamber. The sections were
permeabilized in PBS −0.25 % Triton X-100. After the tissue
was incubated in blocking solution containing PBS −0.1 %
Triton X-100 with 1 % horse serum. The slices were incubated
overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody in
blocking solution: monoclonal mouse anti-glial fibrillar acidic
protein (GFAP) (1:1000; Clon 4A11; BD Pharmingen no.
55632); rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:500; Wako no. 019–19741);
monoclonal mouse anti-NeuN (1:100; Clon A60; Millipore
MAB377). The sections were then washed with PBS −0.1 %
Triton X-100 and incubated in PBS −1 % hydrogen peroxide.
The slices were subsequently incubated at room temperature
with the appropriate secondary antibody: biotinylated antimouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 in PBS −1 % horse serum
or goat serum, respectively). After, the sections were incubated for 30 min with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex from the
Vector ABC Elite kit (VECTASTAIN, Vector laboratories
Inc., Burligame, CA, USA), followed by 15-min incubation
with FAST 3 3 diaminobenzidine tablets (Sigma, D4168).
After dehydration, the sections were cleared with xylol and
mounted using Entellan New mounting medium (Electron
Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA).
For immunofluorescence experiments, following incubation with the primary antibody, the sections were incubated
with anti-mouse Alexa-555 (1:500; Invitrogen). The slices
were mounted using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech).
The immunostained slides were observed under an Olympus
BX61 microscope and images captured using an Olympus
DP50 camera.

Tissue Collection
Images Quantification
For immunoblotting analysis, animals were sacrificed by exposure to CO2 at 54 h after onset of pMCAO. The right
cerebral cortex and hippocampus was dissected out and frozen
at −80 °C for subsequent analysis.
For immunohistochemistry, the deeply anaesthetised animals using a mixture of medetomidine (375 μg/kg) and ketamine (112.5 mg/kg) ip, were transcardially perfused with icecold 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4 %
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4. After perfusion, the
brains were removed and post-fixed overnight at 4 °C followed by cryoprotection using 30 % sucrose in PBS at 4 °C for

The intensity of immunostaining was quantified using Fiji
image processing software [30]. For DAB-processed images
(stained with GFAP and Iba-1), ×4-magnification images was
used. After conversion of 16-bit, images was normalized
subtracting background (rolling=500 light). The threshold
was automatically selected (AutoThreshold) using the Moments method. To determine the size of the stained selected
area, we analyzed particles (selecting size=100–5000 and
circularity=0.10–1.00). The values were normalized to the
total area of the tissue including in the picture that was

Cortical Primary Neurons Culture and Oxygen-Glucose
Deprivation
Primary mouse neurons were prepared from 16-day-old Swiss
mice embryos. A pool of cerebral cortices were dissected and
enzymatically digested with 0.05 % trypsin-EDTA
(Invitrogen) and 10 mg/ml DNase (Roche Applied Science)
for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by trituration with fire-polished
glass pipettes. The cells were plated on 24-well plates for
viability and 6-well plates for Western blot analysis at a
density of 2.5×105 cells/ml. The plates were previously precoated with 0.5 mg/ml poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) in borate buffer. Neurons were cultured with neurobasal medium
(NB) supplemented with 2 % B27 and 2 mM glutamine
(Invitrogen), and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 95 %
air/5 % CO2 atmosphere incubator. Five-day-old cultures were
used for all experiments. The cultures contain almost 90–95 %
of neurons and were negative to GFAP by western blot.
For oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), culture neurons
were incubated in glucose-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) and in a near-anaerobic incubator containing an atmosphere of 0.2 % O2, 5 % CO2 and 94.8 % N2 at
37 °C. As control (non-OGD condition), DMEM media and
normal incubator were used. After 17-h OGD, the cultures
were returned to a normal environment; glucose-free media
was replaced with NB/B27 media and cultures were returned
to a 95 % air/5 % CO2 incubator. Experimental parameters
were assayed at 24 h following re-oxygenation/regeneration.
Neuronal cultures were treated after OGD with β-estradiol

reader spectrophotometer (Opsys MR, Dynex Technologies).
Results were expressed as percentages of the values obtained
from the controls (non-OGD condition).
Statistical Analyses
GraphPad Prism software was used for all statistical analyses
and all the data are presented as mean±standard error of mean
(SEM). Statistical significance was estimated using a twotailed Student’s t test to compare differences between groups
(SV vs IV; IV vs IEP). The neurological score was analyzed
by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with three groups
(sham, IV and IEP), followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for
group comparisons between groups (SV vs IVand IV vs IEP).
A value of p≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Post-ischemia Administration of Estradiol/Progesterone
Accelerates the Recovery of Neurological Status in Male Rats
After pMCAO Induction
To investigate the effect of a combined hormone therapy
administered after ischemic stroke, we treated pMCAOinduced rats at 6, 24 and 48 h with a mixture of estradiol/
progesterone and monitored the behavioural scores. As Fig. 1
shows, all the animals attained the maximal ischemic damage
index (IDI) before surgery was carried out. At 6 h postsurgery, immediately before the first treatment, the ischemic
rats (IV and IEP groups) showed a neurological score significantly lower than the sham-operated animals (2.8±0.374 vs
5.2 ± 0.374; ***p = 0.0002). This showed that pMCAO

representing the boundary between background and positive
staining was automatically selected by the software and then
applied to measure the area of positive staining in each image.
Prior to quantification, images was corrected using a variance
filter (radius=1 pixel). To determine whether the immunostaining area changed in any experimental group, we quantified the positive staining area in NeuN images and these
values were normalized to the total area of the photographed
sections.

induction had a significant and consistent effect on the neurological status of the rats. At 24 h, the ischemic rats treated with
the vehicle (IV) maintained significant lower values on IDI
(4.6±0.6; ***p=0.0002). However, a unique injection of E/P
induced a non-significant improvement on the neurological
scores (5.1±0.47). At 48-h post-pMCAO induction, the IV
group conserved a reduced IDI of 5±0.63 (*p=0.031) whilst
the IEP group recovered the maximum score index. Finally, all
the experimental groups achieved the maximum IDI before
sacrifice.
The Estradiol/Progesterone Treatment After pMCAO
Reduces the Reactive Gliosis Induced by Ischemia
After MCAO induction reactive gliosis has been reported [31,
13]. It is characterized by the activation and proliferation of
microglia and astrocytes especially in regions near to the
ischemic core and exerts both beneficial and detrimental effects on brain damage after injury. To further assess the effect
of E/P treatment on reactive gliosis after pMCAO, we examined this phenomenon in coronal sections immunostained
with astrocyte-specific and microglia-specific antibodies,
GFAP and Iba-1, respectively (Fig. 2). We focused on the
parietal and piriform cortex where we observed a larger proliferation of these cells after pMCAO induction.

As we have already described [13], the GFAP-positive
marked area in IV group was significantly higher than in the
same area of SV group (4.81±0.91 vs 1.67±0.27 %; p≤0.01;
Fig. 2a). Additionally, a similar pattern was found when we
examined the Iba1-positive stained area (10.62±1.40 vs 5.99
±1.17 %; p≤0.05; Fig. 2b). As expected, these findings indicate a marked accumulation of astrocytes and microglia in
particular, near to the damaged area 54 h after ischemia onset.
The administration of three doses of E/P after pMCAO induced a decrease in the percentage of GFAP-positive and
Iba1-positive areas in the ischemic territory (Fig. 2a, b; right
panels). The percentage of Iba1 marked surface decreased
significantly to basal levels (6.09±0.5 %; p≤0.05), but the
percentage of GFAP-marked surface decreased without
reaching the levels of SV group (2.38±0.8 %; p≤0.05). This
result suggests that post-pMCAO E/P treatment could reduce
the reactive gliosis triggered by ischemia with a slightly
greater effect on microglia than in astrocytes.
Estradiol/Progesterone Treatment Increases the Amount
of NeuN-Positive Cells in CA2-CA3 but Not in the Cortex
After cerebral blood flow deprivation, some neurons, especially those located in the ischemic core, initiate a detrimental
process that could induce cell death. The next step was to

neuronal cells after pMCAO induction. It was revealed that
the percentage of NeuN-positive marked area in IV group was
significantly lower compared with the SV group (12.66±0.24
vs 16.53±1.2 %; p≤0.05, Fig. 3) when the somatosensory
cortex (ischemic core) was analysed by immunofluorescence.
In addition, post-pMCAO treatments with a mixture of E/P
did not cause any effect on the percentage of NeuN-positive
marked area, since we detected similar levels in the IV group
(13.62±0.73).
NeuN staining in the hippocampus CA1, and CA2-CA3
region, showed non-significant differences between SV
(CA1 = 408 ± 47.3; CA2-CA3 = 451 ± 54) and IV groups
(CA1=360.7±16.8; CA2-CA3=314.6±82; Fig. 3). These
findings confirmed that the hippocampus did not suffer the
same degree of injury as the somatosensory cortex 54 h after

significant increase in the percentage of NeuN-staining area
in internal region around CA2-CA3 (584.5±9.9; p≤0.01) but
this effect was not found in CA1 region (482.2±56.9). This

family, PSD95; and a presynaptic protein (synapsin).
To demonstrate further the impact of E/P treatment on
neurons, the levels of these proteins were checked 54 h after
pMCAO induction (Fig. 4). The total levels of α-N-catenin
did not show any significant differences between the experimental groups neither in the cortex nor the hippocampus
(Fig. 4a, e). The PSD95 levels exhibited a slight increase in
IV group in the cerebral cortex but not in the hippocampus
(Fig. 4b, f). The administration of both hormones caused a
non-significant reduction of the pMCAO-increased level
(Fig. 4b, f). The total levels of synapsin were not altered after
ischemia induction (Fig. 4c, g) in both regions studied. However, after 54-h pMCAO, the p-synapsinSer9 levels were significantly increased in both the cortex and the hippocampus
when compared with the SV group, 130.12±19 and 117.8±
4.6 %, respectively. The E/P treatment induced a reduction in
these pMCAO-increased levels, but this was only statistically
significant in the hippocampus (Fig. 4d, h).

Although the detailed molecular mechanisms by which
both estradiol and progesterone enhance neuronal survival
are not clearly understood, it has been established that
both hormones activate multiple intracellular signalling
cascades. The PI3K/Akt/GSK3/β-catenin survival pathway is one of the well-described mechanisms, implicated
in the neuroprotection triggered by estradiol and progesterone [33, 34]. Recently, we reported that estradiol treatments reverted the pMCAO-induced downregulation of
the PI3K/Akt/GSK3/β-catenin pathway in the parietal
cortex, reflecting an important neuroprotective effect in
this ischemic area [13]. Therefore, in this study, we investigate whether the combination of estradiol and progesterone could modify the neuroprotective effect identified with estradiol.

The effect of E/P treatment on Akt and GSK3 activities was
examined by Western blotting using phospho-specific antibodies against the active/inactive forms of theses kinases. The
Akt activation was measured using pAktSer473 and pAktThr308
specific antibodies, the pGSK3Ser21/9 antibody can reflect the
degree of inactivation of GSK3. Activate Akt can phosphorylate GSK3 in Ser21/9 residues reducing its kinase activity.
We also checked the total amount of Akt and GSK3 using
specific antibodies against these proteins. The effect of E/P
treatment on β-catenin levels was analyzed using a specific
antibody.
Firstly, we checked the activation status of this pathway in
the parietal cortex. Unaltered levels of total Akt, GSK3 and βcatenin were found in all the experimental groups (Fig. 5)
indicating no effect of the treatment on the total levels of these
proteins. As we found in our previous study, the levels of
pAktSer473, pAktThr308 and pGSKSer21/9 decreased significantly in cortical areas at 54-h pMCAO induction; indicating a

downregulation of this survival pathway (Fig. 5b, c and e).
The degree of reduction in the pAkt epitopes was different,
with pAktSer473 affected more (40 ± 15 % of SV levels;
p≤0.01) than pAktThr308 (60±5.7 % of SV levels; p≤0.01).
The treatment using E/P did not significantly recover the
pAktSer473 levels, but enhanced the levels of pAktThr308 which
reached 85±5.3 % of the SV levels (p≤0.01; Fig. 5c). The
levels of pGSK3Ser21/9, showed a reduction of 59±9.7 % vs
SV levels (Fig. 5e; p≤0.05). In this case, E/P administration
was not able to recover the activity levels of this kinase.
On the other hand, analysis from the hippocampus samples
obtained from pMCAO-induced animals exhibited a different
response to the E/P treatments. As we observed in the parietal
cortex, the total levels of Akt, GSK3 and β-catenin did not
show any significant variation between the experimental
groups (Fig. 6a, d and f, respectively). A significant reduction
of Akt activity after pMCAO was inferred by the reduction of
pAktSer473 (37±4.3 % reduction vs SV levels; p≤0.01), and

various intervals (1 to 17 h) were carried out. The cells
were analysed 24 h after incubation with the regeneration
medium and the results indicated that a period of 17-h
OGD caused a substantial, 50 % reduction in neuronal
viability (data not shown). We analysed the effect of the
regeneration medium supplemented with estradiol and
estradiol/progesterone treatments after OGD (Fig. 7a).

few articles that use the combined treatment and point to the
beneficial effects preventing cell damage, improving behavioural recovery and reducing the oxidative stress [25, 24, 36].
The majority of these studies have been performed using
transient MCAO (tMCAO), where focal blood flow deprivation for a short time, from 30 min to 2 h, is followed by
reperfusion. Some researchers believe that permanent MCAO
(pMCAO), where reperfusion is not permitted, has a greater
clinical relevance than tMCAO [3]. In addition, most studies
have established the potential of sexual hormones as preventive agents, treating animals before ischemic insult [37, 25,
36]. However, exploring the effects of these hormones administered after ischemic injury is more relevant and poorly
investigated.
Our present data showed that the addition of progesterone
combined with estradiol avoided some of the protective effect
of estradiol both in vivo (pMCAO) and in vitro (OGD). In
fact, we previously described that the administration of three
injections of estradiol (0.04 mg/kg) after pMCAO, attenuated
the ischemic injury in neuronal and glial cells, especially in the
parietal cortex [13]. We evaluated whether progesterone combined with estradiol treatments modified the neuroprotective
effects observed using estradiol alone. Six hours after
pMCAO induction, a significant decrease in the IDI score

Discussion
At the current time, there are contradictory data in the literature regarding the neuroprotective effects of combined hormone administration compared with the treatment of estradiol
or progesterone alone. It has been described that progesterone
reduces the oestrogen-mediated neuroprotection against
excitotoxicity [35] and inhibits some beneficial effects of
estradiol in animal models [22]. However, epidemiological
data obtained from humans and evidence from animal models
of experimental stroke, suggest a neuroprotective effect of
endogenous ovarian hormones against the cerebral ischemic
damage [1, 6]. With regard to stroke models, there are only a

was found. Administration of E/P showed a trend towards
accelerating the recovery of maximum IDI. The maximum
neurological score in the IEP group was recovered earlier than
in the IV group, suggesting an improvement in sensory-motor
functions after the E/P treatment. These results are consistent
with those obtained by others 24 h after ischemia onset in a
tMCAO model [25, 38].
It has been well-established that astrocytes and microglia
activation after ischemia is an adaptive response to regulate
the neuronal death because they play a key role in repairs in
the CNS [34]. There is evidence that astrocytes express all
types of receptors for both steroid hormones [39, 40]. However, the expression of these receptors in microglia has not
been well characterized. Several studies have indicated the
presence of estradiol receptors in resting and activated microglia [41] but until now, the presence of classical progesterone receptors have not been detected in any physiological
state [34]. In this study, we found that after 54-h pMCAO
induction, the amount of astrocytes and microglia increased
significantly compared with the SV group. The administration
of three doses of E/P starting at 6 h post-ischemia decreased
reactive gliosis, measured by the expression of GFAP and Iba1. These data concur with our recently published work, using
estradiol alone [13]. An identical reduction in Iba-1 levels was
found with E/P treatment, indicating that it could mainly be
mediated by the direct action of estradiol, because classical
progesterone receptors have not been identified in microglia.
However, the reduction in GFAP levels after E/P therapy was
slightly lower than with estradiol alone [13]. This seems to
indicate that progesterone could be partially blocking some of
the effects of estradiol in astrocytes.
After blood flow deprivation, the neurons localized in the
area affected suffered detrimental processes which triggered
cell death. In the MCAO model, the striatum and the parietal
cortex are considered to be the ischemic core and the hippocampus a region that suffers secondary damage [5]. In order to
evaluate the degree of neuronal damage after pMCAO induction and the effect of E/P administration, we stained coronal
sections with a neuron-specific antibody, NeuN. Our results
revealed that the percentage of NeuN-positive labelled area in
the parietal cortex was significantly decreased after 54-h
pMCAO induction, but no significant variations were found
in the hippocampus (CA1 and CA2-CA3) compared with the
SV group. E/P treatments after an ischemic insult had no
impact on neuronal numbers in the parietal cortex. The effects
observed are somewhat similar to those obtained using an
in vitro OGD model with primary cortical neurons. Neuronal
cultures subjected to OGD conditions for 17 h decreased the
cell viability by 50 %. The treatment using E/P did not cause
any significant variation over the OGD group. Whilst the
presence of estradiol in the regeneration media improved the
cell viability to control levels (non-OGD). This suggests that,
in our paradigm, progesterone could be blocking some of the

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 52:1690–1703

neuroprotective effects of estradiol. These findings were consistent with previous results obtained by Jayarama and Pike
using cortical primary neurons [23]. They demonstrated the
inhibitory effects of progesterone on estradiol-mediated neuroprotective actions and suggested that this effect could be
mediated through downregulation of ERα and ERβ expression. However, it has been described that E/P administration
after reperfusion induces a reduction of approximately 70 %
of the infarction volume (measured by hematoxylin-eosin
staining or by NeuN immunohistochemistry) at 2 weeks after
insult, using a tMCAO model [38]. This apparent discrepancy
with our findings could be due to some factors that may
strongly affect the degeneration/regeneration of injured brain
areas: duration of artery occlusion; reperfusion vs nonreperfusion; hormonal doses and ratio used (E/P=0.025/10
vs 0.04/4 mg/kg); the time at which the first dose is administered (after reperfusion vs 6 h after the onset of ischemic
insult); and the time when the tissue was analyzed (2 weeks
vs 54 h after MCAO induction). It is well known that reperfusion, depending of damage period, help tissue regeneration.
In our model, reperfusion is not allowed and therefore, the
parietal cortex is more affected that in a tMCAO model. Also,
the timing of pharmacological intervention affect neuronal
rescue, an early intervention help to improve neuronal recovery. All these factors did not permit a straight comparison
between our model system and this reported by Ulbrich
et al. [38].
Nonetheless, treatments using E/P after pMCAO induced a
significant increase in the percentage of NeuN-positive labelled area in CA2-CA3, with respect to the control, mostly
in the stratum lucidum and radiatum. We also found that the
NeuN-positive neurons in these layers decreased after
pMCAO, whereas the quantity of neurons in the CA2-CA3
pyramidal layer (IV group) was similar to the SV group. The
presence of some interneurons in the stratum lucidum
implicated in the local circuits modulation has been described
[42]. These neurons could be particularly vulnerable to ischemia and their degeneration affects the CA3 pyramidal neurons. Consequently, it could cause a delayed degeneration of
the CA1 pyramidal cells [42]. We suggest that the increment
in NeuN-positive neurons on stratum lucidum induced by E/P
treatment could be due to an increase in NeuN expression in
pre-existing interneurons. Additional experiments will be required to further confirm this hypothesis and finally decipher
the E/P effect in the hippocampi.
It has been reported that the PI3K/Akt/GSK3/β-catenin
survival pathway is downregulated after an ischemic insult
[33, 13]. In this and in our previous work, we have shown that
ischemia induced a diminution of the Akt activity (determined
by levels of phosphorylated residues: Ser-473 and Thr-308)
which produces a reduction in pGSK3Ser21/9 levels, associated
with an activation of GSK3 activity. We previously reported
that estradiol, administered after pMCAO, recovered the Akt

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 52:1690–1703

activity predominantly in the cerebral cortex and to a lesser
extent in the hippocampus, which correlates with an increment
of GSK3 inhibition [13].
These results are in agreement with those obtained using
our in vitro OGD model. The addition of E after OGD induced
a recovery in Akt activity with the subsequent increase in
pGSK3Ser21/9 levels, which may mediate the recovery of
neuronal viability described above. Our in vivo and in vitro
results are fully in agreement and enable us to postulate an
important modulatory role of the estradiol-dependent
PI3K/Akt/GSK3 pathway after ischemia. Administration of
three doses of E/P after pMCAO slightly recovered the
pAktThr308 epitope but not pAktSer473 in the cerebral cortex.
This correlates with the effect observed in the pGSK3Ser21/9
levels and therefore maintained the GSK3 activity as seen in
the IV group. Moreover, in vitro experiments using cortical
neurons indicated that E/P treatment did recover either Akt
activity or the degree of viability in the cortical neurons. Thus,
both our present and previous work support the hypothesis
that the post-pMCAO administration of estradiol reduces
some of the negative effects of ischemic injury in the parietal
cortex, both in vivo and in vitro, acting as a recovery agent.
However, the presence of progesterone abolished some of the
beneficial effects observed.
In the hippocampus, E/P treatments induced a recovery
in the Akt activity levels, as demonstrated by the significant increase of pAktSer473 and pAktThr308 with respect to
IV. This correlates with a significant increase in the
pGSK3Ser21/9 levels and therefore an inhibition of GSK3
activity which can improve cell survival. In a previous
report, we described that post-pMCAO-estradiol treatments were unable to reduce the GSK3 activity in the
hippocampus [13]. The phosphorylation of both Aktresidues is necessary for the maximal Akt activity [43].
Different kinases are implicated in the phosphorylation of
each residue: PDK1 (Thr-408) and mTORC2 (Ser-473)
although the regulatory mechanisms, and physiological
importance of each phosphorylation site, are still not fully
understood [43]. According to our data, we hypothesize
that post-pMCAO E/P treatment modulated PDK1 in the
cortex and hippocampus, but mTORC2 only in the hippocampus through a mechanism that has not been unidentified. The results obtained in NeuN-positive cells suggests
that E/P induced upregulation of pAktThr308 which occurred in the cortex, probably mediated by PDK1, but
was not able to reach the Akt/GSK3 activity levels necessary for the recovery of the neurons in the ischemic core.
However the pAktThr308 and pAktSer473 upregulation in the
hippocampus (reflecting full activation) was able to
achieve the suitable activity levels of Akt/GSK3
preventing the pMCAO-induced neuronal loss.
Therefore, we suggest that the combined administration
of E/P reduces some of the beneficial effects triggered by

1701

estradiol, mediated in part by the survival pathway
PI3K/Akt/GSK3/β-catenin, in the cerebral cortex. By contrast, this survival pathway is upregulated by E/P in the
hippocampus, as shown by the increased levels of
pAktThr308, pAktSer473 and pGSK3 Ser21/9. The apparent
discrepancy in the E/P effects observed in the cortex and
hippocampus may be explained by variations in the ratio
between progesterone/estradiol receptors between both cerebral territories. In a non-pathological condition, cortical
and hippocampal neurons exhibits differences in expression of estradiol and progesterone receptors [44, 45]. These
differences could be exacerbated by an ischemic insult
because both territories are affected differently by pMCAO
and the underlying cause of damage is not the same. In
fact, after MCAO, the parietal cortex suffers a dramatic
reduction in the glucose and oxygen supply whereas hippocampus underwent damage mainly by deafferentation.
Nevertheless, further studies are required to reveal the
detailed mechanism of E/P interactions.
In summary, we have used two experimental approaches
and examined the effects of combined treatment using E/P
after pMCAO induction. We have found that E/P administration after pMCAO induction (1) accelerated the recovery of
neurological score in male rats; (2) reduced the degree of
reactive gliosis; (3) did not avoid the neuronal loss in cerebral
cortex, but induced an evident response of the neurons in the
stratum lucidum/radiatum of the hippocampus CA2-CA3 region; (4) caused a significant recovery in the PI3K/Akt/GSK3/
β-catenin pathway in the hippocampus but not in the cerebral
cortex. However, this hormonal treatment had no remarkable
impact on synapse-associated proteins at this time.
A complementary approach was performed in vitro exposing primary neurons to OGD. We found that estradiol treatments recovered neuronal viability and recuperated the
PI3K/Akt/GSK3 pathway downregulated by OGD. Moreover, the combination of progesterone and estradiol avoided
the protective effect of estradiol. In conclusion, we propose
that the post-ischemia administration of estradiol can reduce
some neurodegenerative processes associated with ischemic
damage in the cortex, both in vivo (pMCAO) and in vitro
(OGD). But the presence of progesterone abolished the beneficial effects in the cortex.
