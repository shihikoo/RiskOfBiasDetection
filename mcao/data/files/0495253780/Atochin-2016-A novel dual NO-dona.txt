The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) has been shown to be an important regulator of neuronal cell death.
Previously, we synthesized the sodium salt of 11H-indeno[1,2-b]quinoxalin-11-one (IQ-1S) and demonstrated that it was a high-afﬁnity inhibitor of the JNK family. In the present work, we found that IQ-1S
could release nitric oxide (NO) during its enzymatic metabolism by liver microsomes. Moreover, serum
nitrite/nitrate concentration in mice increased after intraperitoneal injection of IQ-1S. Because of these
dual actions as JNK inhibitor and NO-donor, the therapeutic potential of IQ-1S was evaluated in an animal
stroke model. We subjected wild-type C57BL6 mice to focal ischemia (30 min) with subsequent reperfusion (48 h). Mice were treated with IQ-1S (25 mg/kg) suspended in 10% solutol or with vehicle alone 30 min
before and 24 h after middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (MCAO). Using laser-Doppler ﬂowmetry, we
monitored cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) above the MCA during 30 min of MCAO provoked by a ﬁlament and
during the ﬁrst 30 min of subsequent reperfusion. In mice treated with IQ-1S, ischemic and reperfusion
values of CBF were not different from vehicle-treated mice. However, IQ-1S treated mice demonstrated
markedly reduced neurological deﬁcit and infarct volumes as compared with vehicle-treated mice after
48 h of reperfusion. Our results indicate that the novel JNK inhibitor releases NO during its oxidoreductive
bioconversion and improves stroke outcome in a mouse model of cerebral reperfusion. We conclude that
IQ-1S is a promising dual functional agent for the treatment of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury.

Reperfusion injury is a major clinical problem in several organs,
including heart, liver, kidney, and brain. The important role of
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) has been demonstrated in the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury and stroke [23,39].
C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a critical MAPK activated by various brain insults and is implicated in neuronal injury triggered
by reperfusion-induced oxidative stress [30]. Three distinct JNKs,

46

designated as JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3, have been identiﬁed, and at
least 10 different splicing isoforms exist in mammalian cells [17].
While JNK1 and JNK2 are ubiquitously expressed, JNK3 is found
almost exclusively in the brain [43], but it is not dominant, as JNK3
knockout results only in a weak attenuation of the total JNK pool
in brain tissue [5]. Increased JNK phosphorylation and JNK activity in the hippocampus have been reported after cerebral ischemia
and reperfusion injury [19,29]. Sustained JNK activation has been
shown to be associated with neuronal death and apoptosis following ischemic stroke, and in animal models of cerebral ischemia,
acute inhibition of JNK reduces infarction and improves outcomes
[13,31]. Because the inhibition of JNK isoforms has neuroprotective effects in animal models, it has been suggested that pan-JNK
inhibitors may represent promising therapeutic agents for treatment of stroke.
Increasing evidence suggests that the JNK signaling pathway is
tightly coupled with nitric oxide (NO) production during ischemia
and reperfusion [44]. The effects of NO on the ischemic brain are
thought to be dependent on the sources of its production and
the stage of the ischemic process [10,20]. The low concentration
of NO that is produced by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) confers protective effects during cerebral ischemia, whereas the high
concentrations of NO produced from neuronal NOS (nNOS) and
inducible NOS (iNOS) are detrimental to the ischemic brain [10,28].
Exogenous NO had a neuroprotective role in reperfusion-induced
brain injury [20,28]. Based on the coupling of NO and JNK pathways
and the protective role of exogenous NO, we hypothesized that
agents with dual functions as JNK inhibitors and NO donors could
have protective effects against cerebral reperfusion injury. To date,
some oxime derivatives have been demonstrated in vivo and ex vivo
as NO donors [11,22]. Recently, we described novel oxime-derived,
speciﬁc JNK inhibitors based on the 11H-indeno[1,2-b]quinoxalin11-one scaffold [35,36]. One of these compounds, IQ-1S, was found
to be active in vivo and had a higher afﬁnity toward JNK3 over
JNK1/JNK2 [35,36]. Because the neutral form of IQ-1S has an oxime
group, we suggest that, similar to other aryl oxime derivatives
[1,9,11], this compound could release NO during its oxidoreductive bioconversion and, together with JNK inhibition by the parent
molecule, will improve stroke outcome in a model of cerebral
reperfusion. Here, we show that indeed, the JNK inhibitor IQ-1S
releases NO during its enzymatic metabolism with liver microsomes, resulting in increased serum NO concentration in mice after
IQ-1S injection. Moreover, mice treated with IQ-1S demonstrated
markedly reduced infarct volume and neurological deﬁcit after 48 h
of reperfusion.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Compounds
Sodium salt of 11H-indeno[1,2-b]quinoxalin-11-one (IQ-1S)
was synthesized, as described [34], and the structure of the compound was conﬁrmed by NMR and mass spectroscopy [36]. For
in vitro experiments, IQ-1S was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) (EMD Chemicals, Darmstadt, Germany); for animal treatment, IQ-1S was suspended in 10% solutol HS15 (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO).
2.2. Determination of NO in microsomal suspension and serum
Pooled liver microsomes from male CD-1 mice were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich. IQ-1S was incubated for the indicated times
with the microsomal suspension (2 mg/ml) and NADPH (2 mM)
in potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4; 37 ◦ C). Control
samples contained DMSO (up to 2%). The incubation was ended

by heating the reaction for 5 min at 100 ◦ C, and the mixture was
centrifuged (10 min × 10,000 × g). Aliquots from the reaction were
directly mixed with Griess reagent (equal volumes of 1% sulfanilamide in 0.4 N HCl and 0.1% N-(1-naphtyl) ethylenediamine in 0.4 N
HCl) to determine NO2 − [9].
After single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of IQ-1S (50 mg/kg;
the dose was selected based on the total amount received during treatment in the ischemia model, see below), C57BL6/J mice
were bled, and sera were separated. NO production in serum was
determined by measuring levels of nitrite plus nitrate by the Griess
reaction after reduction of nitrate to nitrite by nitrate reductase
using a Nitrite/Nitrate Colorimetric Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical,
Ann Arbor, MI). Before the reaction, serum samples were ultraﬁltered using 30 kDa molecular weight cut-off ﬁlters (Amicon).
2.3. Cerebral reperfusion model
The transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (MCAO)
model was performed on 10–12 week old male C57BL6/J mice
under anesthesia (1.5% isoﬂurane in 30% O2 and 70% N2 O). A
ﬁberoptic probe was afﬁxed to the skull over the area supplied by
the MCA for relative CBF measurements by laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (LDF) before, during, and 30 min after MCAO. Body temperature
was monitored continuously, and temperature was maintained
at 36.5–37.5 ◦ C with a heating plate (FHC). MCAO was caused by
inserting a nylon ﬁlament covered by silicon (Doccol) into the internal carotid artery and advancing it to the origin of the MCA for
30 min of ischemia with subsequent reperfusion for 48 h [3]. All
procedures were performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the
National Institutes of Health and approved by the Massachusetts
General Hospital Subcommittee on Research and Animal Care.
2.4. Evaluation of neurological deﬁcit
Mice were examined after 48 h of reperfusion using a 4-point
scale, as described [3]. Normal motor function was scored as 0, ﬂexion of the contralateral torso and forearm on lifting the animal by
the tail as 1, circling to the contralateral side as 2, leaning to the
contralateral side at rest as 3, and no spontaneous motor activity
as 4.
2.5. Measurement of infarct volume
After measurements of neurological deﬁcit at 48 h of reperfusion, brains were cut into 2-mm-thick coronal sections and stained
with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) for 1 h at 37 ◦ C in
the dark [2]. The area of infarction in each section was expressed as a
fraction of the non-ischemic part of ipsilateral hemisphere (indirect
volume of infarct) [2].
2.6. IQ-1S treatment
Mice were treated intraperitoneally with IQ-1S (25 mg/kg) suspended in 10% solutol (100 ␮l) or with vehicle (10% solutol, 100 ␮l)
30 min before and 24 h after MCAO. This dosing of IQ-1S was
selected based on previously published studies that used this
compound to target JNK in mouse models in vivo [35,36]. This
dose regimen represents a combination of prophylactic (IQ-1S
administration before ischemia-reperfusion) and therapeutic (after
reperfusion) treatments. Because an acute (ﬁrst minutes after
stroke) and delayed treatment (5–7 days after stroke) with JNK
inhibitors could have different outcomes after cerebral ischemia
[38], 24 h after stroke was used for the second administration of
IQ-1S.

2.7. Molecular modeling
To evaluate the ability of IQ-1S to permeate the blood-brain
barrier (BBB), we calculated parameters important for this permeation [37] using the structure of the neutral form of IQ-1S, which
is the most abundant form at physiological pH [35]. The octanolwater partition coefﬁcient aLogP was calculated according to the
Ghose-Crippen additive scheme [14] with the use of HyperChem 7.0
software. Polar surface area (tPSA) was obtained by a summation
of atomic increments [12]. Number of rotatable bonds (Nrot ) was
counted directly in the structural formula of the molecule. Based
on calculated parameters (aLogP, tPSA, and Nrot ) the prediction of
BBB permeation for IQ-1S was obtained using previously reported
classiﬁcation trees [37].
2.8. Statistical analysis
All results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical analysis was
performed with t-test or Kruskal-Wallis 1-way analysis of variance on ranks (neurological deﬁcit). Differences of p < 0.05 were
considered signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. IQ-1S releases NO
Previous publications reported that aryl oximes could be metabolized by cytochrome P450 and NO synthase to release NO [1,9,40].
Because of the biological effects of NO during reperfusion, we studied whether the aryl oxime IQ-1S could act as a NO precursor
after an in situ oxidation catalyzed by endogenous enzymes under
physiological conditions (liver microsomes with NADPH and O2 ).
The results indicate that the NADPH-dependent metabolism of IQ1S by liver microsomes resulted in accumulation of NO2 − , which
was formed via oxidation of NO radical (Fig. 1A and B). NO2 − production increased linearly with increasing concentrations of IQ-1S
but not reaching saturation at 100 ␮M of the compound. In contrast, incubation of the control DMSO with microsomes did not
result in accumulation of NO2 − . Production of NO2 − was also not
observed in the absence of NADPH (Fig. 1B) or with heat-inactivated
microsomes (5 min at 100 ◦ C; data not shown), indicating that the
cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidase system was involved in
the oxidation IQ-1S, in accordance with the general mechanism
of other aryl oximes [1,9,40]. Likewise, single administration of
IQ-1S (50 mg/kg, i.p.) signiﬁcantly increased serum nitrite/nitrate
concentrations in vivo at 30–60 min after treatment (Fig. 1C).
3.2. IQ-1S decreased reperfusion injury
To ensure that comparable ischemic insults were reproducibly
induced, we used laser Doppler to monitor the decrease in cortical
perfusion and conﬁrmed no differences between mouse groups in
CBF during MCAO and the ﬁrst 30 min of reperfusion. Compared
to the control untreated and vehicle-treated mice, two injections
of IQ-1S administered 30 min before and 24 h after MCAO signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volumes measured at 48 h after reperfusion
(Fig. 2A). Moreover, mice treated with IQ-1S demonstrated less
severe neurological deﬁcit after 48 h of reperfusion, as compared to
control untreated and vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 2B). In the course
of these studies, 3 animals died in each of the control and vehicletreated groups of mice, whereas 2 animals died in the IQ-1S-treated
group. All deaths occurred during the ﬁrst night after stroke. These
animals were excluded from statistical evaluation of infarct volume
and neurological deﬁcit.

without or with 2 mM NADPH, and nitrite production was measured. Panel C. NO
production in serum after IQ-1S injection. IQ-1S was administrated i.p. (single dose
50 mg/kg), mice (n = 3) were sacriﬁced after indicated time, and serum was collected. Serum nitrite levels were evaluated as described. For Panels A and B, values
are the mean ± S.D. of triplicate samples from one experiment, which is representative of two independent experiments. Statistically signiﬁcance differences (*p < 0.05;
**p < 0.01) between IQ-1S- and DMSO-incubated microsomes are indicated. For
Panel C, the data are presented as means ± S.D. of triplicate samples from different
mice and are representative of two independent experiments. Statistically signiﬁcance differences (**p < 0.01) between animals treated with IQ-1S and vehicle are
indicated.

3.3. Computation of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of
IQ-1S
Although NO has a good permeability via the BBB, intact IQ-1S
is necessary for JNK inhibition in brain tissue. We used a modern
machine learning algorithm to predict the BBB permeabilitysurface area (PS) product (logPS) [33] from physical-chemical
descriptors [37]. The values of a LogP and tPSA were found to be

Fig. 2. IQ-1S treatment improved stroke outcome. Mice were treated with IQ-1S
(i.p., 25 mg/kg) or with vehicle control (10% solutol), 30 min before and 24 h after
MCAO or without any treatment (control).
Panel A. IQ-1S decreased infarct volume. After 48 h of reperfusion, the animals were

mice per group. *P < 0.05 vs. control and vehicle. Panel B. IQ-1S treatment decreases

2.91 and 57.31, respectively. Using these descriptors, together with
number of rotatable bonds (Nrot = 1) for this molecule and implementation of classiﬁcation and regression trees, we predict that
IQ-1S has strong (CNSp + ) BBB permeation.
4. Discussion
JNKs are involved in many neuropathological signaling events
and play key roles in regulation of brain tissue survival [26].
For example, increased activity of JNK signaling pathways was
observed after global and focal ischemia (for review [21]), including transient ischemia in rat and mouse brain [18]. A variety of
small-molecule JNK inhibitors have been reported [24], and some
have been shown to exhibit neuroprotective effects in animal models of stroke [8,13], suggesting that JNK inhibition could be a
relevant strategy in the therapy of ischemic insult. For example,
the most commonly used JNK inhibitor SP600125 demonstrated
neuroprotective potential in various models, including cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion injury after an acute stroke [13,16,31]. This
JNK inhibitor decreased neuronal apoptosis and stroke injury
[13,16,31]. However, SP600125 is relatively nonspeciﬁc, and 13 of
28 tested kinases were inhibited with similar or greater potency
as the JNKs [4]. In contrast, IQ-1S is one of most speciﬁc smallmolecule, non-peptide JNK inhibitors known and does not inhibit
other kinases [35] that play roles in ischemic brain pathological
events, including glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) [25], phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 K) [45], and cyclin-dependent kinase
(Cdk) [32].
Previously, we found that intraperitoneal administration of IQ1S led to a rapid rise in the serum concentration of this compound,
with an AUC0–12 h value of 7.4 ␮M × h−1 [36]. Here, we calculated
that IQ-1S likely has strong BBB permeation and showed that IQ1S could be enzymatically converted to NO by liver microsomes

(in vitro). Additionally, treatment with IQ-1S led to enhanced NO
production in vivo. Thus, we suggest that the beneﬁcial effects of IQ1S on stroke outcome could be a combined result of JNK inhibition
by the parent compound in brain tissue, as well as NO generation
during its bioconversion.
JNK exacerbates stroke injury by provoking pro-inﬂammatory
cellular signaling and ischemic cell death [29]. For example, high
expression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines was found in a model
of focal cerebral ischemia [15]. Because IQ-1S decreases levels of
these cytokines in cultures of monocytes and lymphoid cells and
inhibits transcriptional activity of NF-␬B/AP-1 [35,36], this compound could protect against brain reperfusion injury via inhibition
of pro-inﬂammatory pathways. Moreover, we recently found that
IQ-1S can inhibit expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)1 and -3 in cultured ﬁbroblast-like synoviocytes [35], and MMPs
are known to cause neurovascular damage during early times
after stroke [7]. Indeed, signiﬁcant increases in MMPs levels were
observed during the acute stage of reperfusion following transient
cerebral ischemia in mice [27]. Clearly, further work is important to
evaluate additional JNK-dependent mechanisms involved in therapeutic effects of IQ-1S after focal ischemia.
While IQ-1S is a speciﬁc JNK inhibitor, we found here that its
enzymatic bioconversion led to NO generation. There is a growing
body of evidence that synthetic NO donors have efﬁcacy in animal
models of cerebral ischemia. For example, intraperitoneal injection of NO donor Rut-bpy prior to ischemia/reperfusion reduced
brain infarct and improved viability of hippocampal neurons [6].
Although the exact mechanisms of NO-induced protection against
brain ischemic injuries are not yet clear, NO is known to inhibit
the NF-␬B pathway in endothelial cells [41]. Similarly, exogenous
NO donors attenuated the S-nitrosylation of mixed lineage kinase
3 (MLK3) induced by reperfusion and inhibited activation of the
JNK pathway [20]. It should be noted that NO donors could modulate BBB permeability [42], and many attempts have been made to
capitalize on this NO mechanism to enhance drug delivery across
the BBB [38]. Thus, we suggest that the dual functionality of IQ-1S
could thereby potentially enhance neuroprotective activity of this
compound during early times after ischemia and reperfusion.
In conclusion, we show here that IQ-1S protects against damage
in a mouse model of cerebral reperfusion injury when administered before and during the reperfusion period. We also show
that this compound exhibits NO donor activity, which together
with previously reported JNK inhibitory activity may contribute
to its protective effects. In addition, the known inhibitory effects
of IQ-1S on inﬂammatory cytokine and MMP expression may also
contribute to the beneﬁcial therapeutic effects of this compound.
Thus, future studies on the relative contributions of vascular and
inﬂammatory mechanisms to the protection by this compound are
warranted.
