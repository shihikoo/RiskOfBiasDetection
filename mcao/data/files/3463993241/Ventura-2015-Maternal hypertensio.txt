Abstract The maternal system is challenged with many
physiological changes throughout pregnancy to prepare the
body to meet the metabolic needs of the fetus and for
delivery. Many pregnancies, however, are faced with
pathological stressors or complications that significantly
impact maternal health. A shift in this paradigm is now
beginning to investigate the implication of pregnancy
complications on the fetus and their continued influence on
offspring disease risk into adulthood. In this investigation,
we sought to determine whether maternal hypertension
during pregnancy alters the cerebral response of adult
offspring to acute ischemic stroke. Atrial natriuretic peptide gene-disrupted (ANP-/-) mothers exhibit chronic
hypertension that escalates during pregnancy. Through
comparison of heterozygote offspring born from either
normotensive (ANP?/-WT) or hypertensive (ANP?/-KO)
mothers, we have demonstrated that offspring exposed to
maternal hypertension exhibit larger cerebral infarct

volumes following middle cerebral artery occlusion.
Observation of equal baseline cardiovascular measures,
cerebrovascular structure, and cerebral blood volumes
between heterozygote offspring suggests no added influences on offspring that would contribute to adverse cerebral response post-stroke. Cerebral mRNA expression of
endothelin and nitric oxide synthase vasoactive systems
demonstrated up-regulation of Et-1 and Nos3 in ANP?/-KO
mice and thus an enhanced acute vascular response compared to ANP?/-WT counterparts. Gene expression of Na?/
K? ATPase channel isoforms, Atp1a1, Atp1a3, and Atp1b1, displayed no significant differences. These investigations are the first to demonstrate a fetal programming
effect between maternal hypertension and adult offspring
stroke outcome. Further mechanistic studies are required to
complement epidemiological evidence of this phenomenon
in the literature.

Introduction
Adverse maternal influences during critical periods of
embryonic development have shown to have implications
on disease risk later in the adult life of the offspring. The
phenomenon that disease risk begins in utero is commonly
referred to as ‘‘The Barker Hypothesis,’’ which was coined
when the relationship between low birth weight and
increased adult cardiovascular disease risk was established
[1]. Due to the developmental plasticity of the embryo,
changes to the intrauterine environment may stimulate fetal
adaptations resulting in permanent alterations in fetal
physiology. Various pregnancy-specific pathologies, in
particular, hypertensive diseases of pregnancy such as preeclampsia, have been associated with both increased risk of
cardiovascular disease and stroke in adult offspring [2–5].
The natriuretic peptide (NP) system, a regulator of tissue
dynamics, is expressed within the heart and has known
implications to impede the development of cardiac hypertrophy (CH) [6]. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a peptide hormone of the NP system and produced primarily in
the atria of the heart [7]. ANP possesses its cardioprotective
roles through binding of the ligand to transmembrane
guanylyl cyclase (i.e., particulate guanylyl cyclase or pGC)linked receptors and the downstream production of cyclic
guanosine 30 -50 monophosphate (cGMP) [8–10]. Further
investigations with particular focus on allelic mutations
within the ANP gene (NPPA) in humans have revealed
correlations between increased circulating levels of ANP
and the risk of both hypertension and stroke [11–14].
In mice, disruption of the ANP gene has led to an animal
model that lacks the expression of ANP (ANP-/-). These
mice are chronically hypertensive, salt-sensitive, and
exhibit left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy independent of
arterial blood pressure [6, 15]. Previously, we have
demonstrated that chronically hypertensive female ANP
gene-disrupted or knockout (ANP-/-) mice display even
further significant increases in blood pressure during their
pregnancy as compared to wild-type (ANP?/?) controls
[16]. Additionally, the gestational hypertension exhibited
by female ANP-/- mice does not compromise pregnancy
success or offspring growth into adulthood [16]. Although
the absence of maternal ANP has no effect on heterozygous
ANP (ANP?/-) offspring blood pressure, we have previously demonstrated that heterozygote offspring born from
ANP-/- mothers display adverse phenotypes such as
increased CH, cardiac fibrosis, and diastolic dysfunction
when administered isoproterenol, a moderate cardiac
stressor targeting the sympathetic nervous system [17]. The
objective of the current investigation was to use this murine
model of gestational hypertension to determine whether
these adverse phenotypic responses in the heart translate in

the brain with respect to increased cerebral tissue damage
or outcome following induction of acute ischemic stroke.

Materials and methods
Animal model, parental crossing, and genotyping
Approval was received from the University Animal Care
Committee (UACC) of Queen’s University in accordance
with the guidelines of the Canadian Council of Animal
Care (CCAC) for all experimental protocols pertaining to
the use of mice in this investigation. All surgical procedures were performed under Euthanyl injection or isoflurane anesthesia and all efforts were made to minimize
animal suffering. All mice were housed (up to four animals
per cage), bred, and cared for in the Animal Care Facility at
Queen’s University. Mice were kept at room temperature
(21 ± 1 °C) on a 12 h light/dark cycle and fed rodent
chow and tap water ad libitum. To investigate the influence
of gestational hypertension on cerebral ischemia in adult
offspring, heterozygous (ANP?/-) mice were obtained
through specific parental crossing and compared as previously described [16, 17]. Briefly, normotensive, ANP?/?
(C57BJ/6) females were crossed with ANP-/- (C57BJ/
6 9 SV129 background) males to produce ANP?/-WT
offspring. Conversely, hypertensive, ANP-/- females were
crossed with ANP?/? males to produce ANP?/-KO offspring. Mice at 13–15 weeks of age were used for experimentation. Only male offspring were considered in this
study as previous literature has demonstrated sex-specific
responses to stroke, both incidence of stroke and stroke
outcome [18, 19]. Ear and tail tissue biopsies were collected for genotyping at weaning (21 days). The genotype
of each mouse was determined using an AccuStartTMII
mouse genotyping kit (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg,
MD, USA) and previously published PCR methods [20].
Induction of transient cerebral ischemia
Temporary occlusion of the proximal left middle cerebral
artery (MCA) using the intraluminal filament method previously described by Longa et al. [21] and Barber et al. [22]
was used to induce transient cerebral ischemia in
ANP?/-WT and ANP?/-KO mice. This method has been
validated by Ventura et al. [23]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3 % initial, 1–1.5 % maintenance), in oxygen to air ratio of 20:80 %. Core body
temperature was monitored and maintained at 36.5 °C
using a rectal probe with feedback to a heated surgical
stage. Changes to cerebral blood flow were measured
transcranially by laser Doppler flowmetry (Perimed,

Mol Cell Biochem (2015) 408:223–233

Periflux System 5010, North Royalton, Ohio, USA). To
induce ischemia, a reduction of 70 % or more in regional
MCA cerebral blood flow was achieved and maintained for
30 min after which the mice were re-perfused and allowed
to recover in a cage warmed to 34 °C by a circulating water
blanket for 24 h. Mice received 2 mg kg-1 of bupivacaine
subcutaneous (SQ), 0.5 mL of 0.9 % saline SQ, and 2 mg
kg-1 of meloxicam SQ for analgesia immediately following surgery. Sham mice were used as controls; all surgical
procedures were conducted with the exception of MCA
occlusion.
Tissue collection
Mice were anesthetized via an IP injection of Euthanyl
(100 mg kg-1 body weight) 24 h post-cerebral reperfusion.
The brain of each mouse (n = 6 each; ANP?/-WT and
ANP?/-KO, sham and MCAO) was removed from the cranium and sectioned into 1-mm coronal slices. Coronal slices
were stained in 0.5 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with the
exception of the fourth slice (Bregma ± 1 mm) that was
isolated and snap-frozen for molecular analysis. Infarct volumes were measured using ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.
nih.gov/ij/). To account for cerebral swelling post-stroke,
infarct volumes were calculated according to the methods of
Swanson et al. [24] using the following formulas:

blue dye through a left jugular vein injection. Successful
uptake of the dye was confirmed by a visible color change
in the face and paws of each mouse. Blood was drawn via a
right ventricular cardiac puncture two minutes following
injection. Blood plasma containing Evan’s blue dye was
isolated and frozen at -20 °C until analyzed. Plasma
sample absorbance was measured using a UV–Visible
spectrophotometer (SpectraMax Plus, Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale California, USA) at 625 nm, and the maximum
absorbance of Evan’s blue as was determined through
spectrophotometric analysis. Duplicate serum absorbance
measurements were normalized to background measured at
725 nm. Concentrations of Evan’s blue were calculated
from a standard curve of dilutions of Evan’s blue dye in
pooled serum samples.
The brain of each mouse was excised and both
hemispheres isolated. Cerebral hemisphere wet weights
were recorded and placed in formamide for 72 h at
room temperature to extract the dye from the tissue.
Cerebral Evan’s blue absorbance was measured by
spectrophotometry as indicated above. Concentrations of
Evan’s blue were calculated from a standard curve of
dilutions of Evan’s blue dye in formamide and normalized as indicated above.

To evaluate differences in cardiac size, the heart was
excised and dissected into individual chambers. Both
whole heart and individual cardiac chamber wet weights
were recorded. Cardiac tissue weights were normalized by
tibia length. Tibias were obtained by dissolving all soft
tissue in 0.2 M NaOH overnight at 60 °C and tibia length
was measured using digital calipers.
Serum and organ tissue Evan’s blue extraction
A subset of mice was used to assess systemic blood and
organ-specific vascular volumes between ANP?/-WT and
ANP?/-KO mice (n = 5 and n = 6, respectively). Mice
were anesthetized via an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of
Euthanyl (100 mg kg-1 body weight). Evan’s blue dye
(Fisher Scientific, Ottawa, Canada) was dissolved in normal saline (0.9 % NaCl). ANP?/-WT and ANP?/-KO mice
were administered 0.025 mg g-1 body weight of Evan’s

Mice were anesthetized by IP injection of Euthanyl as
described above. FITC–dextran (MW = 59,000–77,000,
Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) dissolved in saline and
25 mg kg-1 body weight was administered via a left
jugular injection. The brains of ANP?/-WT and
ANP?/-KO mice (n = 4 each) were removed two minutes
post-injection and the cortical surfaces visualized using a
Leica TCS SP2 multiphoton microscope (Heidelberg,
Germany). FITC was excited using a 488 nm argon laser
and the fluorescent emission was collected from 515 to
535 nm. Confocal images (Pinhole = 1 Airy disk) were
obtained at steps of one lm to a total tissue depth range
of 38–77 lm. MetaMorph Offline Version 7.7.0.0 image
analysis software (Molecular Devices LLC, USA) was
used to render four-dimensional (4D) stacks of the confocal images and measure the average intensity of vessels
within the chosen 4D section. With particular interest in
the smaller branching and micro-capillary networks, the
average intensity of vessels with a calibrated voxel volume between 10,000 and 10 lm3 as well as vessels with a
volume less than 10 lm3 was analyzed. Vessels with a
calibrated voxel volume greater than 10,000 lm3 were
excluded from all analyses.

Gene expression analysis
RNA isolation
Total RNA was isolated using a combination of Trizol (Tri
Reagent, Molecular Research Centre, Inc. Burlington, ON,
Canada) and a high pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Scientific Co., Laval, QC, Canada). Frozen brain slices were
homogenized in Trizol using a Polytron homogenizer (PT
10 20 3500, Brinkman Instruments, Rexdale, ON, Canada).
Chloroform was added and the aqueous phase, combined
with ethanol, was transferred to a silica column. All wash
and elution steps were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The quantity and purity of total
RNA was measured using Nano-Drop 2000 spectrometer
(Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). Eluted total
RNA was stored at -80 °C until assay.
Reverse transcription
Total RNA (1 lg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA
using a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit
(LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Protocol was
carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Samples were incubated for 1 h with oligo-dT18 and an
additional hour with random hexamers. The first strand
cDNA was stored at 4 °C.
Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR)
Oligonucleotide primers were designed using Primer Design
2.0 software (Scientific & Educational Software, Cary, NC,
USA) from published mRNA sequences from the NIH
GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank; National Center for Biotechnical Information, Bethesda, MD, USA).
Details of each primer set are outlined in Table 1. Primer
sets yielding standard curve efficiencies between 1.8 and 2.0
were deemed adequate. Levels of mRNA expression were
measured using a LightCyclerÒ 480 system II (Roche Scientific, Laval, QU, Canada), employing the standard curve
method for each gene. All samples were run in duplicates
and normalized using hypoxanthine–guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) as a reference control gene. Cycling
parameters consisted of denaturation at 95 °C for five min,
followed by touchdown from 68 to 62 °C (decreasing step
size of 0.5 °C per cycle) for 15 s and 72 °C for 15 s to ensure
precise hybridization. Melt curve analysis was completed to
evaluate the quality and specificity of qPCR products [23].
Data and statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 6.0
Software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).

123

Mol Cell Biochem (2015) 408:223–233

Statistical analyses utilized in this investigation involved
unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test for comparing cardiac
weights, Evan’s blue, confocal, and infarct volume measurements. In addition, target gene mRNA expression data
were compared by two-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons and Tukey’s post hoc test. In all cases, P B 0.05
was deemed statistically significant. Grubb’s test was used
to ensure no major outliers were present.

Results
ANP1/2KO mice exhibit larger cerebral infarcts
following induced stroke
Acute stroke was induced via temporary MCAO in a subset
of ANP?/-WT and ANP?/-KO mice (n = 6 each) with the
remaining mice undergoing sham surgical procedures
(n = 6 each) for comparison. Measurements of cerebral
infarction volumes by TTC indicated a significant increase
in cerebral tissue damage in ANP?/-KO mice following
reperfusion. The mean infarct volume observed in
ANP?/-KO mice was double that of ANP?/-WT mice
(Fig. 1, P = 0.0034).
These results suggest that offspring born from a hypertensive mother display increased cerebral tissue damage
when stressed by a cerebrovascular event such as stroke.
ANP1/2WT and ANP1/2KO mice do not differ
in cardiac size, cerebrovascular volume, or structure
at baseline
To ascertain whether ANP?/-WT and ANP?/-KO mice
exhibit any characteristics at baseline that would contribute
to dissimilar cerebral responses to stroke induction, we
investigated cardiac size and cerebrovascular structure and
volume. Physical measurement recordings for ANP?/-WT
and ANP?/-KO mice at 13–15 weeks of age included body
weight and cardiac mass normalized to the length of the
left tibia (Table 2). ANP?/-KO mice demonstrated a significant increase in body weight to tibia length ratio as
compared to ANP?/-WT mice (P = 0.018). Cardiac mass,
in particular, the mass of the left ventricle, is often used as
an indicator for hypertension or CH, both factors that
would modify the cerebral response to stroke or pose added
risk. Neither heart weight nor left ventricular weight to
tibia length ratios demonstrated any significant changes
between groups. Blood pressure was not measured in this
investigation as previous work by our laboratory has shown
no differences in the blood pressure of either set of
heterozygote offspring at baseline [16].
Cerebral blood volumes were estimated by use of
Evan’s blue dye tissue extraction. Evaluation of

hemispheric blood volume was of importance to ascertain
no local circulatory or vascular abnormalities between
ANP?/-WT and ANP?/-KO mice. As presented in Fig. 2,
equal volumes of circulating blood were found in both right
(Fig. 2a) and left (Fig. 2b) cerebral hemispheres of either
heterozygote genotype.
Cerebrovascular structure and vessel volumes were
observed through the use of confocal microscopy and fluorescent detection. The cerebrovascular capillary beds
were of particular interest as any differences in their vascular density and/or vascular size could modify the cellular
response of these mice following induction of a stroke. The
acquired confocal images and 3D stacks of the cerebrovasculature of ANP?/-WT and ANP?/-KO mice did not
show any obvious differences in vessel number, structure,
or size (Fig. 3a) (Please refer to supplemental figure S-1 for
3D images for the cerebrovasculature of ANP?/-WT and
ANP?/-KO mice). In addition, no significant differences in
average fluorescent intensity were observed between
ANP?/-WT and ANP?/-KO mice (Fig. 3, Bi). Isolation of

smaller branching cerebral vessels (Fig. 3, bii) and capillaries (Fig. 3, biii) also displayed no differences in fluorescence intensity.
Vasoactive systems implicated in the acute response
to ischemia following stroke are significantly
up-regulated in the ANP1/2KO brain
Being that the baseline characteristics between ANP?/-WT
and ANP?/-KO mice did not differ, we sought to determine
whether the cerebral response to an ischemic event varied
between heterozygote offspring by examining a variety of
target genes and their resultant cerebral mRNA expression.
Endothein-1 (ET-1), a peptide belonging to the endothelin
(ET) system as well as its specific receptor, endothelial
receptor A (ET-A), was analyzed in the left hemisphere of
ANP?/-WT and ANP?/-KO mice. Both MCAO and sham
groups were compared within genotypes and across genotypes (n = 6 each). Et-1 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated in stroke-induced ANP?/-KO mice

Analysis of Nos1 displayed no significant differences in

of Nos1 up-regulation in the stroke-induced group was seen
(Fig. 5a). On the contrary, Nos3 mRNA expression significantly increased in stroke-induced ANP?/-KO mice as
compared to their sham control (P = 0.032; Fig. 5b).
Although significance was not achieved, a trend of
increased Nos3 expression in stroke-induced ANP?/-WT
mice was seen compared to the sham control. NOS system
peptide-specific receptors, soluble guanylyl cyclase alpha-1
and beta-1 (sGCa1 and sGCb1, respectively), were also
analyzed. No significant modifications in gene expression
were observed in either receptor (Fig. 5c, d). No interaction

Discussion
Fetal programming, the idea that disease risk begins in
utero, has recently gained considerable attention. In
specific, themes of maternal and fetal nutrition [25], obesity [26, 27], diabetes [28], and cardiovascular risk [1, 2]

have been in the limelight with only a small number of
epidemiological studies correlating hypertensive diseases
of pregnancy and increased risk of stroke in adult offspring
[4, 5]. This epidemiological evidence, however, focuses
only on stroke risk with no current link to gestational
hypertension and stroke outcome to our knowledge. In the
current investigation, we have used a well-established
murine model of chronic hypertension, the ANP-/- mouse,
to demonstrate that maternal hypertension programs
increased cerebral tissue damage following stroke and thus
poor outcome. The purpose of this study was to develop
and establish an alternative method to further explore the
mechanisms by which fetal programming occurs in place
of sole epidemiological evidence.
This study sought to examine stroke outcome by evaluating the extent of neural damage following stroke
induction and 24 h reperfusion. We have observed that
adult heterozygote offspring born from a hypertensive
mother displayed significantly larger infarct volumes when
compared to their counterpart when subjected to ischemic
stroke. This set of data is suggestive of a fetal programming effect between maternal hypertension throughout
pregnancy and cerebral susceptibility to damage when
stressed by a cerebrovascular event such as stroke.
To ensure that either heterozygote group did not exhibit
any adverse physiological baseline characteristics that may
influence the cerebral response to stroke observed, both
cardiovascular and neural features were examined.

123

Hypertension, a primary risk factor for stroke [29], has
often be determined through examination of the size of the
heart, in particular, that of the left ventricle [30–32]. Previous investigations from our lab have shown no differences in the arterial blood pressure of ANP?/-WT and
ANP?/-KO mice [16]. To confirm our previous findings,
presently, we have demonstrated no differences in whole
heart or left ventricular weights between ANP?/-WT and
ANP?/-KO mice. Thus, we can confidently state that cardiac risk factors such as hypertension and/or CH have not
influenced the changes we see in response to stroke in
either heterozygote group.
Cerebral imaging techniques such as PET, MRI, and
diffusion-weighted imaging have been utilized to investigate whether variations in cerebral blood volume predict
abnormal cerebral hemodynamics ultimately affecting
patient risk or patient response to stroke [33]. Clinically, it
has been shown that patients with increased cerebral blood
volumes have a higher risk of ischemic stroke [34]. However, amongst the above-mentioned methods, Evan’s blue
dye has also been commonly used to measure blood volume, a method that is proven to highly correlate with
simultaneous blood volume measurements collected using
MRI [35]. Through the use of Evan’s blue dye and confirmation by confocal microscopy, we have successfully
assessed cerebrovascular structure and cerebral blood volume. ANP?/-WT and ANP?/-KO mice displayed no significant differences in blood volume measures at baseline

suggesting that the stroke-induced response of either
heterozygote group was also not influenced by irregularities in cerebrovascular circulation or altered hemodynamics. As a result of the baseline physical data collected in
this study and previous work from our laboratory regarding
heterozygote offspring, we chose to examine potential
variations in cerebral mRNA expression of vasoactive

231

target genes as a method of assessing cerebrovascular
response to stroke. In the acute phase of stroke, a variety of
factors and vasoactive systems work together to control
vascular tone and cerebrovascular blood flow [36]. It has
been widely explored that the ET system, in particular ET1, acts as a mediator of cerebral damage within the brain
alongside the production of oxygen radicals. In both clinical and animal model investigations, increased levels of
ET-1 can be found in both blood plasma and brain tissues
following stroke [37–39]. In addition, application of ET-1
locally was found to severely reduce cerebral blood flow
and has served as a model of inducing controlled focal
ischemia in mice and rats [40].
To achieve successful stroke outcome, one must exude
an optimal balance between ET and NOS system expression. Nitric oxide (NO) production specifically via the
NOS3 isoform exhibits opposing functions to ET-1 as it
works to endogenously protect the brain from neuronal
injury and promotes endothelial integrity [41]. Studies have
shown that mice lacking NOS3 expression exhibit larger
infarct volumes following stroke induction proving it to be
a target for stroke protection [42]. Contrary to this, however, NO production via the NOS1 isoform has demonstrated detrimental effects in the brain with respect to
increasing neurotoxicity in the brain [43]. The production
of NO in the brain has remained a topic of controversy
specifically with regard to its detrimental or advantageous
functions depending on the NOS isoform it is produced by.
Nonetheless, NO generated by either NOS isoform is able
to react strongly with superoxide, resulting from excess
oxygen radical production, to generate peroxynitrate [44,
45].The formation of peroxynitrate is damaging for the
brain [46, 47] and could be one potential mechanism by
which the increased Nos3 expression we have examined in
this study contributes to the excess tissue damage in
ANP?/-KO mice.
Na?/K?-ATPase channels found on the plasma membrane of neurons function to maintain resting-membrane
potentials and these channels play an important role in signal
transduction through their contributions to cellular ion
homeostasis [48]. Na?/K?-ATPase is a heterodimeric protein with alpha, beta, and tissue-dependent gamma subunits.
Additionally, each subunit possesses multiple isoforms. The
a1 and b1 isoforms are ubiquitously expressed where the a3
isoform is neuron specific [49, 50]. Under hypoxia or
ischemic conditions, a reduction in the activity of these
channels in addition to their expression has been previously
seen in the heart [51], kidney [52], and brain [53]. Therefore,
to understand whether neuron-specific diversity in the
expression of Na?/K?-ATPase channels could contribute to
the alternative phenotypes expressed by ANP?/-WT and
ANP?/-KO mice following stroke, Atp1a1, Atp1a3, and
Atp1b1 isoforms were examined using qPCR. Our results

123

232

have demonstrated no distinct differences in expression of
these isoforms implying that the altered stroke response
between offspring born from normotensive or hypertensive
mothers may not be a result of variations in neuronal
response but vascular instead.

Conclusion
In the present investigation, we sought to determine whether maternal hypertension during pregnancy could alter
the adult offspring’s response to stroke. Our results provide
evidence that hypertension during pregnancy programs
cerebral susceptibility to increased tissue damage following stroke using the heterozygous ANP?/- mice as a
model. To our knowledge, this is the first study to observe
these distinct phenotypic responses in the mouse and this
model serves as a platform to further explore the mechanisms by which this programming is occurring. Although
our set of data provides exciting novel evidence in the field
of fetal programming and stroke, we understand that the
present study is limited. We have not assessed the possibility that the altered phenotype we have observed is solely
of maternal origin and not due to paternal imprinting. It is
possible that the gene expression profiles seen in these two
experimental groups may differ in a parent-of-originspecific manner. With that being said, we strongly
hypothesize that the uterine environment of the ANP-/dam is a major player in producing the varied phenotypes
we have observed in this investigation and our previously
published work [16, 17]. Future investigations surrounding
enhanced mechanistic understanding and maternal
imprinting or epigenetic changes are required to better
determine how this information can be translated to the
human population.
