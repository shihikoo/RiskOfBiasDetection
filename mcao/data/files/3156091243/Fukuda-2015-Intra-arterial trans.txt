Abstract Cell transplantation therapy for cerebral
infarction has emerged as a promising treatment to reduce
brain damage and enhance functional recovery. We previously reported that intra-arterial delivery of bone marrow
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) enables superselective
cell administration to the infarct area and results in significant functional recovery after ischemic stroke in a rat
model. However, to reduce the risk of embolism caused by
the transplanted cells, an optimal cell number should be
determined. At 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion
and reperfusion, we administered human MSCs (low dose:
1 9 104 cells; high dose: 1 9 106 cells) and then assessed
functional recovery, inflammatory responses, cell distribution, and mortality. Rats treated with high- or low-dose
MSCs showed behavioral recovery. At day 8 post-stroke,
microglial activation was suppressed significantly, and
interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-12p70 were reduced in both
groups. Although high-dose MSCs were more widely distributed in the cortex and striatum of rats, the degree of
intravascular cell aggregation and mortality was significantly higher in the high-dose group. In conclusion,
selective intra-arterial transplantation of low-dose MSCs
has anti-inflammatory effects and reduces the adverse
effects of embolic complication, resulting in sufficient
functional recovery of the affected brain.

Introduction
The annual age-standardized mortality rate of ischemic
stroke is steadily decreasing with the advancement of
treatment strategies including endovascular treatment and
intravenous administration of tissue plasminogen activator.
Nevertheless, its morbidity is still a serious issue and the
resultant symptoms can have a negative effect on quality of
life. Recently, stem cell transplantation for stroke treatment
has shown promising results in small and large animal
models (Bliss et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2001; Eckert et al.
2013; Lindvall and Kokaia 2011; Misra et al. 2012; Stem
Cell Therapies as an Emerging Paradigm in Stroke 2009).
Many clinical trials are ongoing to establish this strategy in
a clinical setting (Rosado-de-Castro et al. 2013). However,
there are many variables that can affect the efficacy of cell
transplantation, including donor cells (cell type, safety, and
auto vs. allogeneic), recipients (patient age, stroke subtype,
and location), treatment strategy (acute, sub-acute, or
chronic, delivery route, and cell dose), and validation
(functional assessment and imaging) (Abe et al. 2012).
Intra-arterial administration of stem cells is a feasible
route for stem cell delivery to the stroke-affected brain with
the advantage of superselective delivery without loss
through filtering organs (Amar et al. 2003; Guzman et al.
2008a; Ishizaka et al. 2013). Animal studies have demonstrated higher rates of cell engraftment via intra-arterial
delivery and a higher concentration of cells in the target
ischemic lesion (Guzman et al. 2008b) and improved
functional recovery than when compared to intravenous
cell infusion (Kamiya et al. 2008; Yavagal et al. 2014).

However, the major issue of intra-arterial delivery is
embolic stroke due to aggregation of the cells in the blood
vessels (Chua et al. 2011). These results suggest that lowdose, intra-arterial cell administration could prevent
embolic complications and might induce functional
recovery, that have not been clarified.
In this study, we determined whether low-dose mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) administration has a therapeutic
effect, in terms of post-stroke functional recovery and the
host environment, and investigated embolic complications
in comparison with high-dose cell transplantation.

Methods
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion and Reperfusion
Model
All animal procedures were approved by the Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care of Nagasaki University. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (250–300 g) were
anesthetized with 5 % isoflurane and maintained under
anesthesia by 2 % isoflurane in 70 % N2O and 30 % O2
using a vaporizer during all surgical procedures. Transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed
for 75 min with a 4.0 nylon monofilament suture (Encarnacion et al. 2011). The rectal temperature was maintained
at 37 °C throughout the surgical procedure. Rats showing a
modified neurological severity score (mNSS) from 5 to 8
points at 24 h post-stroke were included in this study.
Cell Culture and Transplantation
MSCs were obtained by iliac crest aspiration from a
19-year-old healthy female volunteer (cells registered in
Lonza, Japan; Product Code: PT-2501). The cells were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM;
Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum,
3 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, and 2 % penicillin/
streptomycin.
Cells were delivered thorough a catheter inserted from
the stump of the distal external carotid artery to the internal
carotid artery via bifurcation. The cell suspension was
injected slowly (100 ll/min) along with the antegrade
blood flow from the common carotid artery. As previous
papers used 1 9 106 MSCs for intra-arterial administration
(Ishizaka et al. 2013; Mitkari et al. 2014; Walczak et al.
2008; Yavagal et al. 2014), we randomly divided the animals into three groups; low-dose MSC group: 1 9 104
cells/300 ll, high-dose MSC group: 1 9 106 cells/300 ll,
and control: 300 ll phosphate buffered saline. Cyclosporine A (10 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally every day
until euthanasia.

Neurobehavioral Tests
Neurological recovery was assessed by the cylinder test
and mNSS at day 0, 1, 2, 5, and 8 post-stroke. The cylinder
test is used to measure forelimb use during vertical
exploration (Horie et al. 2008). Rats were placed in a
Plexiglas cylinder, and the number of times each rat
reached and touched the cylinder in a weight-bearing
fashion with the left, right, or both forelimbs was counted.
Approximately 20 of these limb-use movements were
counted per trial. The behavior score was calculated using
the equation: (affected limb use ? both limb use)/(unaffected limb use ? both limb use), giving a ratio of affected
to unaffected limb use. The mNSS consisted of motor
(muscle status and abnormal movement), sensory (visual,
tactile, and proprioceptive), reflex, and balance tests (Chen
et al. 2001).

Histological and Immunohistochemical Analyses
All quantifications and analyses were performed in a
double-blinded manner. Animals were anesthetized and
perfused transcardially with 4 % paraformaldehyde at
8 days after MCAO. Brains were removed and prepared as
5-lm paraffin-embedded sections and 20-lm frozen coronal sections. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubation in target retrieval solution (pH 6.0; Dako, Carpinteria,
CA) for 2 h at room temperature. For immunohistochemical staining, the 20-lm sections were incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-Iba-1, 1:250, Wako
Chemicals, Osaka, Japan; mouse anti-ED1, 1:100,
ab31630, Abcam) at 4 °C overnight and then with secondary antibodies (biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit IgY,
1:500; Gallus, USA). The sections were then applied to an
avidin–biotin-peroxidase complex kit (ChemMate ENVISION kit/HRP; Dako, Japan). Labeled proteins were
visualized with 3,30-diaminobenzidine. The number of
Iba-1-positive and ED-1-positive cells was counted using
WinROOF software (Mitani, Tokyo, Japan). Peri-infarct, a
region of drastic reorganization and rewiring of surviving
circuits, was used as the region of analysis (Murphy and
Corbett 2009).
To evaluate the MSC distribution, sections were incubated with mouse anti-human vimentin (1:50; Millipore,
Tokyo, Japan) at 4 °C overnight and then with secondary
antibodies (TOPRO-3, 1:500; Molecular Probes, Tokyo,
Japan, or Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG, 1:1,000;
Molecular Probes) for 2 h at room temperature. The sections were analyzed using a confocal laser microscope
(LSM5 Pascal Ver 3.2; Zeiss). The mouse anti-human
vimentin antibody stains cells of human mesenchymal
origin.

Cell Mol Neurobiol (2015) 35:399–406

To evaluate cell aggregation, we used PKH26 (Sigma,
Japan), a red fluorescent cell linker. MSCs were harvested
and stained with PKH26 before cell transplantation as
described previously (Messina et al. 1992). Two days after
transplantation, the rats were anesthetized and perfused to
analyze the MSC distribution in the peri-infarct cortex and
striatum. To label endothelial cells, the sections were also
incubated with mouse anti-RECA-1 (1:500, Abcam,
Tokyo, Japan) at 4 °C overnight and then with secondary
antibodies (TOPRO-3, 1:500, or Alexa Fluor 488 donkey
anti-mouse IgG, 1:1,000) for 2 h at room temperature.
Luminex Assay
MILLIPLEX MAP kits (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA)
were used for microsphere-based multiplex immunoassays
to measure the concentrations of various proteins. The
following rat-specific cytokines and chemokines were
measured in rat brain tissue: interleukin (IL)-4, IL-1b, IL-6,
IL-10, IL-12p70, interferon gamma, IL-17, MCP-1, tumor
necrosis factor-a, epidermal growth factor, and vascular
endothelial growth factor. The system was set to analyze
100 ll of sample per well according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. At 5 days after MCAO, the rats were anesthetized
and euthanized. Rat brains were removed and small pieces
were cut from cerebral cortex while excluding the infarct
core. Then, the brains were homogenized in phosphate
buffered saline as a 10 % solution, and cytokine/chemokine levels were measured.
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. Data were tested
for normality and equal standard deviations in GraphPad
InStat (Ver 3.10; GraphPad Software, USA) to determine
the appropriate statistical test (parametric vs. nonparametric). The figure legends describe the statistical tests. Unless
stated otherwise, all tests were two-tailed. Differences were
considered statistically significant at P \ 0.05.

Results
MSC Transplantation Leads to Behavioral Recovery
at Both Low and High Doses
Behavioral scores were markedly lower at day 1 poststroke in all groups. However, the animals treated with
MSCs showed significant recovery in the cylinder test at
day 5 (control: 0.26 ± 0.1; low-dose MSCs: 0.71 ± 0.1;
high-dose MSCs: 0.54 ± 0.1, Fig. 1a) and the mNSS at
day 8 (control: 6.2 5 ± 0.9; low-dose MSCs: 4.0 ± 0.8,
high-dose MSCs: 4.5 ± 0.6, Fig. 1b). The animals with

401

low-dose MSCs showed better neurological recovery, but
there was no significant difference between low- and highdose MSCs. Body weight increases were also evident in the
animals treated with MSCs regardless of low or high doses
(Fig. 1c).
MSC Transplantation has an Anti-inflammatory Effect
at Both Low and High Doses
At 7 days post-transplantation (8 days post-stroke), many
Iba 1-positive microglia (19,457.6 ± 3,388.2 cells/mm2)
and ED1-positive activated microglia (14,036.0 ± 1,663.8
cells/mm2) had infiltrated into both the peri-infarct cortex
and striatum (Fig. 2). However, the animals that received
MSCs showed fewer Iba 1-positive cells (low-dose MSCs:
10,655.3 ± 1,985.3 cells/mm2; high-dose MSCs: 11,426.5 ±
1,763.7 cells/mm2) and ED1-positive cells (low-dose MSCs:
9,797.7 ± 969.8 cells/mm2; high-dose MSCs: 8,517.1 ±
1,327.2 cells/mm2) in the peri-infarct cortex and striatum.
Luminex assays showed significant reductions of IL-1b
(control: 327.1 ± 21.6 pg/ml; low-dose MSCs: 211.0 ±
21.4 pg/ml; high-dose MSCs: 237.8 ± 34.6 pg/ml) and IL12p70 (control: 53.3 ± 8.9 pg/ml; low-dose MSCs:
30.3 ± 6.4 pg/ml; high-dose MSCs: 32.3 ± 1.2 pg/ml) in
animals treated with MSCs (Fig. 3).
Differences in MSC Distribution and Overall Mortality
at Low and High Doses
MSCs were widely distributed throughout the cortex and
striatum of the ipsilateral hemisphere at 24 h after transplantation of high-dose MSCs (cortex: 546.3 ± 55.9/mm2;
striatum: 475.9 ± 79.9/mm2, Fig. 4), while few cells were
observed in the low-dose MSC group (cortex: 314.8 ±
57.5/mm2, P = 0.008; striatum: 88.9 ± 37.3/mm2, P \
0.001, Fig. 4). Interestingly, more PKH-positive aggregated cells were detected in the RECA-positive endothelial
lumen around the cortex and striatum in animals treated
with high-dose MSCs (low-dose MSCs: 0.21 ± 0.1/mm2;
high-dose MSCs: 0.003 ± 0.003/mm2, Fig. 5; P = 0.002).
No PKH-positive cells were identified in the control group.
Overall mortality was also high in the high-dose MSC
group compared with that in the low-dose MSC group at
8 days post-stroke (Table 1).

Discussion
In this study, accelerated functional recovery after stroke
was observed in model animals treated with MSCs at not
only a high dose (1 9 106 cells) but also a low dose
(1 9 104 cells). Anti-inflammatory effects were also evident by decreases in microglia infiltration and cytokine

induction, suggesting that enough cells had migrated into
the brain to prevent secondary damage after stroke.
Recent animal studies have shown the efficacy of stem
cell transplantation via the carotid arteries (Andres et al.
2011a; Byun et al. 2013; Gutierrez-Fernandez et al. 2011;
Janowski et al. 2013; Chua et al. 2011; Kamiya et al. 2008;
Li et al. 2001; Rosenblum et al. 2012; Walczak et al. 2008;
Yang et al. 2013; Yavagal et al. 2014). Intra-arterial
delivery of stem cells might be a novel therapeutic strategy
that addresses the main issue with intravenous delivery,
namely the dispersal of cells throughout the body, and
fewer transplantable cells are needed for engraftment in the
brain parenchyma (Guzman et al. 2008a; Liu et al. 2006).
Therefore, intra-arterial cell transplantation has the potential to maximize the effect of a smaller number of cells in
the selected vascular territory. This approach is particularly
advantageous for autologous transplantation because time
is needed to expand autologous cells for transplantation in
a clinical setting. However, the major issue of intra-arterial

123

delivery is embolic stroke due to aggregation of the cells in
the blood vessels (Chua et al. 2011). It has been reported
that intra-arterial transplantation has the risk of reducing
cerebral blood flow, which is associated with microembolic
stroke. However, intra-arterial cell delivery with maintained blood flow can be used to successfully deliver cells
into the cerebral vasculature without causing ischemic
changes, allowing transplanted cells to undergo targeted
migration to the damaged brain (Chua et al. 2011). Another
study demonstrated a clear risk of vascular occlusion and a
large increase in mortality (67 % for intra-arterial transplantation compared with 7 % in nontransplanted animals)
(Walczak et al. 2008). Therefore, the cell size, velocity of
injection (Janowski et al. 2013), and cell dose are major
determinants of the safety of intra-arterial cell transplantation. Some reports have investigated the superiority of
intra-arterial delivery in comparison with intravenous
delivery (Byun et al. 2013; Gutierrez-Fernandez et al.
2011; Pendharkar et al. 2010). However, few studies have

area after stroke (Andres et al. 2011b; Horie et al. 2011). In
this study, after intra-arterial administration of both low
and high doses of cells, we found significant suppression of
microglial activation and reductions in interleukin (IL)-1b
and IL-12p70 expression at 5 days post-stroke. A study of
modulation by human MSCs in vitro and in vivo revealed
that human MSCs decrease the expression of microglial
activation markers ED1 and Iba1 (McGuckin et al. 2013).
IL-1b is considered to be a neurotoxic mediator, because a
loss of IL-1b functions has been reported to reduce the
infarct size (Boutin et al. 2001). IL-12 is produced by
infiltrating macrophages in the ischemic brain (Shichita
et al. 2012). In our study, we found that the low-dose of
MSCs (1 9 104) still exerted anti-inflammatory effects and
reduced adverse effects of embolic complications, resulting
in sufficient functional recovery of the affected brain.
Several limitations of this study should be addressed.
First, we did not examine the dose dependency or optimal
cell dose. The cell source, injection velocity, and other
technical differences also affect the risk of embolic stroke
after intra-arterial transplantation. A cerebral blood flow
study or magnetic resonance imaging was not performed to
confirm embolic strokes. Nevertheless, we believe this is
the first study of low-dose MSCs to show efficacy for
functional recovery after intra-arterial transplantation.
These results should be translated to a clinical phase I/II
study using low-dose cells for intra-arterial transplantation
after stroke.

investigated the dose-dependent efficacy and safety of
intra-arterial delivery of stem cells (Yavagal et al. 2014).
Intra-arterial transplantation enables selective cell administration to the affected territory, thus, a lower cell dose is
required while preventing embolic strokes. Here, we found
that a low dose of MSCs (1 9 104) provides functional
recovery after stroke, but further assessment of the optimal
cell dose is required to evaluate the efficacy and adverse
effects.
Yavagal et al. (2014) showed that administration of
allogeneic intra-arterial MSCs at 24 h, but not 1 h, after
cerebral ischemia has a therapeutic effect. Rosenblum et al.
(2012) described that the hyperacute phase in post-ischemic brain tissue may be detrimental to administrated intraarterial cells, and that waiting for the inflammatory
response to diminish in the first days is advantageous. We
previously reported that motor function improves earlier
when MSCs are administrated at 24 h, and later at 4 days,
but not at 7 days (Ishizaka et al. 2013). In this study, we
transplanted the cells 24 h after stroke according to our
previous report (Ishizaka et al. 2013).
Previously, we reported that intraparenchymal cell
transplantation promotes endogenous repair processes,
such as angiogenesis, blood–brain barrier integrity, dendritic plasticity, and axonal sprouting in the peri-infarct

123

Conclusions
It may be possible to minimize the risk of embolic strokes
affecting morbidity and mortality by reducing the number
of MSCs administered via the intra-arterial route.

Cell Mol Neurobiol (2015) 35:399–406

Low-dose cell transplantation by intra-arterial delivery
may be sufficient for anti-inflammatory effects and functional recovery after stroke. Assessment of the optimal cell
dose is needed to establish such cell transplantation therapy
as a clinical strategy, especially using autologous bone
marrow stem cells at the very early stage of stroke.
