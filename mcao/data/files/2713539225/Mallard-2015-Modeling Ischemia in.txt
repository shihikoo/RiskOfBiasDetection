he maturational stage of the brain at the time of injury
plays a key role in the pattern of brain damage in humans,
including regional and cell-type–specific susceptibility. In this
minireview, we will summarize available models of preterm
and at-term ischemic brain injury in rodents and in larger species and discuss how maturation stage of the brain at the time
of an insult affects the underlying excitotoxic and inflammatory injury signatures. We will review pros and cons of animal
modeling for advancing the understanding of the mechanisms
of hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and stroke in
human infants.

Animal Models for Ischemia-Related
Preterm and Term Injury
Numerous models of hypoxia, hypoxia-ischemia (HI), intraventricular hemorrhage, and focal stroke have been developed
in rodents and in larger species to mimic the different types
of injuries seen in the human infant. Studies discussed in this
review focus on ischemic and HI animal models and are summarized in the Table.

Ischemia-Related Brain Damage
in Preterm and Term Infants

Large Animal Models
A unique model of birth asphyxia has recently been developed
in nonhuman primates by transiently occluding the umbilical
cord before birth. The animals develop severe asphyxia and
die or present with cerebral palsy-like motor abnormalities.8
However, the cost limits the number of study subjects in this
model. The most commonly used nonrodent large mammal
species to induce HI in the immature brain are sheep, rabbits,
and pigs, species that have a white/gray matter ratio similar to
the human brain.
Sheep are precocial, and thus studies are performed during pregnancy to correlate to relevant maturation stages in the
human. Cerebral ischemia models in fetal sheep, induced by
bilateral transient occlusion of the carotid arteries, were first
developed in the near-term fetus,9 and, later, during midgestation.11 The chronically instrumented fetal sheep umbilical cord
occlusion model is global and allows examination of intrauterine pathophysiology and the contribution of other organs on
the brain, without the influence of anesthesia. In these models,
the preterm fetuses are more prone to WMI and deep gray
matter injury, with an increased vulnerability of cortical gray
matter with advancing gestation12; neuropathology that correlates well with human pathology. However, fetal models are
complicated by maternal/placenta metabolism, which is not
present in the human situation of HIE.
Newborn pigs subjected to various combinations of
hypoxia and ischemia show changes in metabolism (magnetic

In preterm human babies (23–32 weeks of gestation), periventricular white matter injury (WMI) and its most severe form,
periventricular leukomalacia, as well as intracerebral hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage are the most common
types of ischemia-related injuries1,2 (Figure). Vulnerability of
oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, loss of subplate neurons,
and a weak germinal matrix are thought to contribute to the
pathology.
The pathophysiology of at-term brain damage is multifactorial, with the patterns of ischemic injury differing from
those in preterm newborns; injury is no longer diffuse and is
manifested focally in gray matter regions, most commonly
in the striatum, thalamus, and cortex3 (Figure). Infection and
inflammation have been shown as the major predisposing or
modulatory factors in ischemic injury in both preterm and atterm infants.4
Perinatal arterial ischemic stroke, defined as stroke that
occurs between 20 weeks of gestation and 28 days postnatal, happens in ≤1 in 2300 live infant births and produces
significant morbidity and severe long-term neurological and
cognitive deficits including cerebral palsy, epilepsy, neurodevelopmental disabilities, and impaired vision and language
function.5
Increasing evidence suggests that the placenta plays a significant role in HIE and perinatal stroke,6 and that the presence

resonance spectroscopy) and CBF similar to that observed in
human infants with HIE.14 In general, injury is characterized
by neuronal loss in the sensorimotor cortex and basal ganglia
and postnatal seizures. The HI models in newborn pigs,13 in
parallel with fetal sheep studies,10 have been instrumental
in development of therapeutic hypothermia for term infants
with HIE.
In rabbits, intrauterine ischemia is induced ≈22 days of
gestation as equivalent to the preterm, and at the end of gestation (at 29 days) to mimic at-term injury. HI in preterm rabbits
results in injury mainly in subcortical areas, such as basal ganglia and thalamus.15 Importantly, the preterm rabbit HI model
is one of few large animal set-ups, which has demonstrated
a correlation between abnormalities on magnetic resonance
imaging, neuropathology, and cerebral palsy-like hypertonic
motor deficits in the newborn pups.15

Rodent Models
Like in humans, in rats, and in mice much of brain development
occurs after birth and, like in humans, individual regions of the
rodent brain mature at a different pace, thus making it difficult
to adhere to a single postnatal day as a comprehensive representation of brain development in human. Cross-comparisons
of gross neuroanatomy, the timing of neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, gliogenesis, maturation, and myelination, as well as
age-dependent molecular and biochemical changes in rodents
and humans, have demonstrated that the rodent brain at postnatal day 1 (P1) to P5 corresponds to 23 to 32 weeks of gestation in the humans and is thus suitable for studies of preterm
injury, whereas the rodent brain at P7 to P10 corresponds to 36
to 40 weeks of gestation in humans, thus suitable for studying
brain injury at-term33 (Figure; Table).
Several models of WMI have been developed, including
HI in P1 to P3 rat, a model that consists of unilateral ligation

of the common carotid artery followed by a hypoxic episode,18,19 ibotenate injection in P5 rats,16 and prolonged lowgrade gestational hypoxia.17
The inception of the experimental HI model in P7 rat by
Rice et al20 and extension of the HI model to P7 to P9 mice
has allowed mimicking HIE in the at-term human infant and
obtain seminal information about the pathophysiology of the
disease, including CBF regulation and energy metabolism,20,24
inflammation,20,21,23,25 excitotoxic and oxidative injury,23 intracellular injury mechanisms and neuronal death,34 and mechanisms of brain repair.35 HI studies have also demonstrated that
genetic background36 and sex affect mechanisms of neuronal
cell death and injury severity.37 A limitation of this model is
animal-to-animal variability of injury.
Several models have been established to study the underlying mechanisms of perinatal arterial stroke, including models of permanent middle cerebral artery (MCA) ligation27 and
suture transient MCA occlusion (tMCAO) in P7 to P10 rats28,31
and P9 mice.32 Varying the length of tMCAO has allowed
induction of injuries of different severity.32 The demonstrated
presence of recirculation in the tMCAO model29 mimics
reperfusion, which frequently occurs in arterial stroke in term
infants.

Excitotoxicity and Oxidative Injury
Glutamate receptors are prevalent in the developing brain, and
glutamate-induced excitotoxicity is an important factor that
contributes to ischemic injury in both the preterm and the atterm brain.38 Maturation-dependent expression of different
glutamate receptors has been linked to specific injury patterns.
Thus, high expression of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) and
AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
acid) receptors on neurons in the deep gray matter and cortex is thought to play important roles in at-term brain injury,

The developing brain is sensitive to oxidative injury.23
Excitotoxicity and inflammation are major processes that lead
to generation of reactive oxidants, which can damage DNA

Maturation-Dependent Factors That Affect
the Inflammatory Signatures in Preterm Versus
At-Term Ischemic Brain Damage
Inflammatory Responses

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

Clinical data have demonstrated that proinflammatory cytokines are elevated in cerebrospinal fluid of asphyxiated term
infants, and that the levels of these cytokines reflect the degree
of HIE.39 Cytokines are also elevated in newborns with severe
intraventricular hemorrhage and in brains of neonates with
periventricular leukomalacia.26 There is a robust and continued inflammatory response in the developing brain after HI,
including reactive microglia and mast cells, as well as infiltration of neutrophils, monocytes and γ-delta T cells.26 Initially,
this response is predominantly characterized by production
and release of proinflammatory cytokines, but over the following days to weeks, an anti-inflammatory/restorative milieu
is established.
No single study has compared in detail how the maturation
stage of the brain at the time of an insult affects the inflammatory injury signatures. However, inflammation is evident
in rodents in both preterm HI40 and at-term4 injury models, as
well as in fetal sheep41 and in fetal rabbits.15 Developmentally
regulated inflammatory responses are important determinants
of outcome because several reports demonstrate that antiinflammatory interventions that are beneficial in the immature
brain are not so in the adult24 or vice versa.32 Furthermore,
innate immune factors (eg, stimulation of Toll-like receptors),
which modify the acute inflammatory response and adaptive
immunity and enhance susceptibility to neonatal HI,26 often
have the opposite effect (ie, preconditioning protection) in
adult stroke models.42
There is also growing evidence that the response to immune
therapy may be sex dependent, as was shown for protection of
female but not of male neonates against HI by an iNOS inhibitor, 2-iminobiotin, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase.37

Peripheral Leukocytes
Neutrophils are one of earliest leukocyte populations to
infiltrate and contribute to injury and blood–brain barrier
(BBB) disruption in adult transient cerebral ischemia models.43 Unlike in adults, neutrophil infiltration is limited during acute and subchronic time points after neonatal HI21 and
focal stroke29 in rats, likely contributing to better BBB integrity in injured neonates. The exact mechanisms that restrict
leukocyte infiltration in the ischemic neonatal brain are not
completely understood, and it remains unclear whether the
higher resistance of the neonatal BBB to stroke is a cause or
a consequence of reduced leukocyte transmigration. However,
there is a lack of detailed knowledge on leukocyte celltype–specific infiltration in models of neonatal brain injury.
Monocyte infiltration is relatively low after acute tMCAO in
neonatal rats. On the contrary, on-going studies in neonatal
mice show significant monocyte infiltration during the first
days after HI injury (L. Smith, et al, unpublished data, 2015).
Neither the possibility that peripheral leukocytes contribute to
injury without their infiltration nor the possibility that beneficial leukocyte populations enter injured brain via choroid
plexus have been sufficiently explored. There is evidence that

T cells infiltrate the neonatal brain during a prolonged period
over several months after HI, and a recent study suggests that
blocking lymphocyte trafficking is neuroprotective after lipopolysaccharide-sensitized HI injury.22

Microglia
Microglia populate the brain before birth and are distinct from
peripheral monocytes. Recent data show that microglial cells
play key roles in controlling synaptic pruning and the formation of precise synaptic circuits that occurs during the first 2
weeks of rodent life.44 Improper microglia–neuronal communications during this time and the resultant inappropriate synaptic connections could be the cause of neurodevelopmental
disorders.
Specific hot spots of amoeboid microglia are found in
the developing human brain and are also present in fetal
sheep at midgestation in the white matter, a region susceptible to injury. Because of their active-like state during this
developmental stage, microglial cells have been suggested
to specifically contribute to WMI in the preterm brain.
Furthermore, microglia can produce toxic reactive oxidants
and injure the immature brain, which has limited antioxidant defenses.23
However, there is mounting evidence that suggests a protective role for microglia. In the adult, microglial cells can
provide neuroprotective effects by producing growth factors although this has to date not been demonstrated in the
developing brain. Microglial cells serve as endogenous neuroprotectants in neonatal arterial stroke because microglial
depletion greatly enhances the excitotoxic and inflammatory
responses and injury.30 Distinct maturation-dependent microglial phenotypes and diversity of the microglial phenotypes at a
given time are being increasingly recognized.
The heterogeneity of the microglial pool, the timing of
activation, and the type of stimulus critically affect an array
of microglial effects. A better understanding of these events
in the developing brain is likely to benefit the development of
novel protective strategies.

BBB Integrity, Inflammation, and Angiogenesis
The presence of a leaky BBB in the immature brain has
been commonly assumed, but endothelial tight junctions are
already present during early embryonic development,45 specific BBB transporters are present in the brain endothelium
during midgestation, and no fenestrations are observed at
birth.46 Expression of endothelial BBB proteins undergoes
major changes from the embryonic period to adulthood, but
susceptibility of the BBB to injury does not decrease linearly
with age. In fact, comparison of albumin leakage after acute
tMCAO between neonatal and adult rats showed a marked
leakage in adults but not in neonates. Distinct expression patterns of the extracellular matrix proteins and tight junction
proteins, along with lower than in adults leukocyte infiltration
in neonates,29 are the likely contributors to BBB integrity after
neonatal stroke. In contrast, in P9 mice subjected to HI, BBB
permeability for large- and small-size tracers is transiently
increased during the first 24 hours, changes associated with
modified expression of BBB tight junction proteins.25 It is

3010  Stroke  October 2015
presently unknown whether differences in BBB leakage are
model or species related.
Neurovascular outgrowth (angiogenesis) continues during
the first 2 postnatal weeks in the rat brain,29 but after stroke
in P7 rats, only a subtle and delayed angiogenic response
is observed in the cortex during 2 weeks after injury.47 The
higher resistance of the neonatal BBB to ischemic injury
may negatively impact the angiogenic response and ultimate
endogenous neurogenesis after stroke, but the relationships
between the 2 processes are still poorly understood.

Immune Therapies and Cell-Based
Therapies to Enhance the Repair

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

Currently, hypothermia is used to treat neonatal HIE. However,
the therapy is only partially protective and can only be used
in term infants. Thus, there is a great need to find additional/
synergistic therapeutic strategies. A variety of drugs targeting
neuroinflammation tested in rodent models of ischemia-related
brain injury reported variable neuroprotection, depending on
the timing and type of intervention and on model and sex of
animals used.26 Considering that it is often unknown when
injury occurs in human infants, more recently emphasis has
shifted to cell therapies or molecules, like growth factors (for
example, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and erythropoietin), that can support and enhance the repair.35 Although some
cell therapies and growth factors have shown promising longterm effects and some are currently in clinical trial (melatonin
and erythropoietin), it remains unclear whether cells/agents
have direct effects or, which is likely, act via immune-mediated change in brain microenvironment.

The role of the systemic effects of neonatal stroke has not
been sufficiently addressed in animal models. Stroke is no
longer viewed as a disease only of the brain because it exerts a
rapid response in the blood and in peripheral organs, including
liver, heart, and spleen, and in the bone marrow.48 In addition,
studying the systemic effects of perinatal stroke are important
because injured newborns need intensive care including organ
support (ventilation, cardiovascular, and renal) and because
brain repair may stem from the periphery, but such studies are
rather sparse.

Conclusions
To summarize, ischemia-related injury to prenatal or early
postnatal brain impacts many key neurodevelopmental processes that undergo maturation changes during these time
frames, leading to differing structural–functional abnormalities later in life. There is no single animal model that completely recapitulates the complexity of the human condition,
but utilization of several ischemia-related age-specific models
in rodents, and in larger species, and of both sexes, enables
the enhanced understanding of brain pathology and development of novel therapies for the immature brain, as was demonstrated for hypothermia.

Pros and Cons of Different Ischemia-Related
Animal Models for Translation

Dr Vexler is a consultant for Omniox, Inc. Dr Mallard reports no
conflicts.

Large animal cerebral ischemia models would be most suitable in translational research considering that the brains are
gyrencephalic and that the white/gray matter ratio is similar
to the human brain. Among large nonprimate neonatal models, newborn pigs are appropriate because their general brain
and organ maturation at-term are similar to that of humans.
Different global models have been developed, where global
hypoxia and hypotension often is combined, which results in
permanent brain injury, organ failure, posthypoxic seizures,
and abnormal neurology, similar to humans on survival.
However, practical issues, the high cost of maintenance and
long-term neurorehabilitation have dramatically limited the
use of larger species over the past decade. New hypoxia models in immature ferrets,46 a species with brain gyrification,
may provide a potentially translatable model of preterm WMI.
Although parallels are often made between findings
in humans and rodents, it is important to realize the limitations and translatability of studies in rodents. Rodents are not
gyrencephalic species and their physiology, CBF regulation
and white/gray matter ratios are vastly different from those
in humans. Age-dependent regional vulnerability that may
stem from uncoordinated maturation of individual cells in the
parenchyma and in the vasculature should also be considered
while interpreting the results from HI or focal stroke studies
produced in immature rodents of different postnatal ages.
