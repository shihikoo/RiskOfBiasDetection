Abstract Evidence indicates that the adenosine A2A
receptor subtype is of critical importance in stroke. In
previous studies, in the model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo), the adenosine A2A receptor
antagonist, SCH58261, administered soon after ischemia,
proved protective against excessive glutamate outflow in
the first 4 h after ischemia and against neurological deficit
and tissue damage evaluated 24 h after pMCAo. In the
present work, we investigated if neuroprotective effect of
SCH58261 was maintained 7 days after transient MCAo
(tMCAo). SCH58261 (0.01 mg/kg, i.p.), administered
twice/day for 7 days, protected from neurological deficit
1 day after tMCAo, but no more after 5 and 7 days. Two
days after tMCAo, SCH58261 did not reduce blood cell
infiltration, evaluated as HIS-48 positive cells, into ischemic striatal and cortical tissue. Moreover, 7 days after
tMCAo, SCH58261 has not protected ischemic areas from
damage and has not ameliorated myelin organization into
the ischemic striatum. Protection by the A2A receptor

overwhelmed by a secondary damage due to blood cell

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is a complex pathology characterized by a
sequence of pathophysiological events that evolve over
time and space. Acute events of excitotoxicity and periinfarct depolarizations cause tissue damage soon after ischemia while in the hours and days after ischemia,
neuroinflammation and apoptosis are the cause of a secondary tissue injury [1]. In the first hours after focal ischemia experimentally induced in rodents, glutamate
extracellular concentration increases [2–5]. As well, extracellular adenosine concentration dramatically increases
[3, 6–9] reaching lM concentrations that are able to stimulate all four adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B,
A3).
Recent evidence indicates that the adenosine A2A receptor subtype is of critical importance in stroke [10–12].
Adenosine A2A receptors are expressed at significant levels
in neurons [13, 14] and glial cells: in microglia [15],
oligodendrocytes [16], astrocytes [15, 17] and in inflammatory cells (such as lymphocytes and granulocytes) [18,
19]. A definite overexpression of A2A receptors was found
in neurons and microglia of the striatum and cortex 24 h
after focal ischemia induced by permanent MCAo
(pMCAo) [20]. In the pMCAo model, it was repeatedly

demonstrated that the selective antagonist of the A2A receptor, SCH58261, administered i.p. starting from the early
minutes after ischemia induction, reduces ischemic brain
damage and neurological deficit 24 h thereafter [3, 21–23].
Protective effect of A2A receptor antagonists administered early after brain ischemia is attributable largely to
reduced excitotoxicity and ensuing excitotoxic cascade due
to stimulation of NMDA receptors [12]. Adenosine A2A
receptor in fact, by different mechanisms, stimulates glutamatergic transmission [12] and the antagonist of the A2A
receptor, SCH58261, administered in the early minutes
after ischemia induction, reduces the increase of the extracellular glutamate in the first 4 h after pMCAo [3]. In
agreement, A2A receptor KO mice are protected from both
an excess of striatal glutamate outflow in the 2 h of tMCAo
[2] and from brain damage up to 48 h after tMCAo in the
mouse [24].
All previous studies addressed the question if adenosine
A2A receptor antagonists or deletion are protective up to
48 h after ischemia. On the other hand, it is crucial to
determine whether treatment with the A2A receptor antagonists, started in the early hours after ischemia, retains
protection days after ischemia [12, 25, 26]. Therefore, the
aim of the present study was to investigate if SCH58261,
chronically administered (i.p., twice/day per 7 days),
maintains a protective effect 7 days after tMCAo.

Experimental procedure
Animals
Male Wistar rats (Harlan, Italy) weighing 270–290 g were
used. Animals were housed in groups of three with free
access to food and water and kept on a 12 h light/dark
cycle. The animals were kept under standardized temperature, humidity and light conditions with free access to
food and water. Animal care and use followed the directives of the Council of the European Community (86/609/
EC). All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering
and to reduce the number of animals used.
Surgery
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by transient intraluminal occlusion of right middle cerebral artery (tMCAo).
The surgical procedure to occlude the MCA consisted of
insertion of a 4-0 nylon monofilament (Doccol corporation,
USA), via the external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery to block the origin of the MCA according to the
procedure described by Melani et al. [27]. After 1 h of
occlusion, animals were re-anesthetized with isofluorane
and reperfused by withdrawing the filament. The sham

123

Neurol Sci (2015) 36:1441–1448

operation was conducted by inserting the filament into the
internal carotid artery and immediately withdrawing it.
Experimental groups and drug administration
Two groups of rats were used. A first one was killed 7 days
after tMCAo and a second one 2 days after tMCAo. The
selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist, 7-(2-phenylethyl)-5-amino-2-(2-furyl)-pyrazole-[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo
[1,5-c] pyrimidine (SCH58261) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
Missouri, USA), was dissolved by sonication in saline
with 1 % Tween 80.
The dose of SCH58261 administered (0.01 mg/kg, i.p.)
and the protocol of administration were chosen on the basis
of those found protective against brain ischemia in previous in vivo studies [3, 21–23]. SCH58261 was administered starting 5 min after tMCAo, twice/day after tMCAo,
up to the time of killing. Sham-operated rats did not receive
any treatment; vehicle-rats received saline with Tween 80
(1 %) administered (i.p.) starting 5 min after tMCAo, for
twice/day after tMCAo, up to the time of killing.
Neurological deficit
The modified neurological Severity Score (mNSS) described by Chen et al. [28] was used. The mNSS test is
composited of motor, sensory, reflex and balance tests.
mNSS test was performed prior to ischemia and 1, 5 and
7 days after tMCAo. In the severity scores of injury, 1
score point is awarded for the inability to perform the test
or for the lack of a tested reflex. The test is graded on a
scale from 0 to18 (normal score, 0; maximal deficit score,
18).
Body weight evaluation
The weight loss after 1, 5, and 7 days from MCAo of each
animal was evaluated respect to its own pre-ischemia
weight.
Ischemic brain damage
Seven days after tMCAo, rats were anesthetized with
chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg i.p., Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
Missouri, USA) and were perfused transcardially with an
ice-cold 4 % paraformaldehyde solution (in phosphate
buffer, pH 7.4). Brains were post-fixed overnight and
cryoprotected in an 18 % sucrose solution (in phosphate
buffer) for at least 48 h. Brains were cut with a cryostat and
coronal sections (30 lm) were collected at 450 lm intervals at 12 different levels through the striatum (from
?2.2 mm to -3.6 mm from Bregma corresponding to the
ischemic area, see [29]). Brain slices were stained by cresyl

Neurol Sci (2015) 36:1441–1448

violet (1 %) or by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). To
evaluate area and volume of ischemic damage, 12 cresyl
violet-stained brain sections per animal were placed directly on the scanning screen of a color flatbed scanner
(CanoScan LiDE 90; Canon). Following image acquisition,
the images were analyzed using ImageJ software. The
measurements of infarct areas in striatum and cortex were
obtained by manually outlining the margins of infarcted
areas. All measurements were performed in blind. Ischemic
cortical and striatal volumes were calculated by multiplying the infarcted area by the slice thickness and summing
the volume of the 12 slices. Histological analysis by cresyl
violet staining allows to clearly define the infarct area and
volume up to 1 week after ischemia [30].
MAG staining
Coronal sections (30 lm), stored at -20 °C in antifreeze
solution (30 % ethylene glycol, 30 % glycerol in phosphate
buffer) until assay, were mounted on gelatin-coated slides
and washed with phosphate buffer saline-0.3 % Triton
X-100 (PBS-TX) (for 3 times, 5 min each), blocked with
blocking buffer (5 mg/ml of Bovine Serum Albumin/PBSTX) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were stained
using the primary mouse monoclonal antibody, anti-myelin
associated glycoprotein (MAG, 1:250; Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA) and the secondary fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:400; Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA) antibody according to the procedure described by Melani et al. [23]. Sections were observed under an epifluorescent Olympus BX40 (Olympus,
Hamburg, Germany) microscope with excitation at 488 and
568 nm wavelength and photographed using a digital
camera (Olympus DP50). The images were assembled into
montages using Adobe Photoshop 6.1 (Adobe Systems,
Mountain view, CA, USA).
Blood cell infiltration
Brain coronal sections (30 lm), obtained from the group of
animals killed 2 days after tMCAo, and stored at -20 °C
in antifreeze solution until assay, were mounted on gelatincoated slides and washed with PBS-TX. Then they were
incubated for 15 min in PBS-TX containing 0.75 % H2O2,
rinsed in PBS-TX and incubated at RT in Blocking Buffer
for 60 min. The sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C
with mouse monoclonal antibody, anti-HIS48 (specific for
granulocytes) (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according
to the procedure described by Melani et al. [27]. Sections
were examined using an Olympus BX40 microscope
(Olympus, Milan, Italy) and photographed using a digital
camera (Olympus DP50). HIS48-positive cells were
counted within an optical field (1134 9 850 pixels)

1443

obtained at 409 magnification taken in ischemic cortical
and striatal ‘‘core’’ at seven different levels per animal
(AP = ±1.3 mm from the bregma). Data were averaged
and expressed as the mean ± SEM per optical field of ‘‘n’’
animals.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed statistically by one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by Newman-Keuls multiple
comparison test, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by Bonferroni post hoc test and by unpaired
Student’s t test as specified in text and in figure legends.
The statistical analysis was performed utilizing GraphPad
Prism 4. Differences at p \ 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Effect of SCH58261 on neurological deficit
Figure 1a shows that in the mNSS test, sham-operated rats
had a neurological score of 0.15–0.70 in the period from 1
to 7 days after tMCAo showing any neurological deficit.
Twenty-four hours after tMCAo, vehicle-treated rats had a
neurological score of 12.6 ± 0.5 (mean ± SEM) that defines a severe injury. Five days after tMCAo, the neurological score was reduced to 8.2 ± 0.7 and 7 days after
tMCAo, the neurological score was further reduced to
7.0 ± 0.6 that represents a moderate injury. The chronic
treatment with SCH58261 improved the neurological deficit only at 1 day after tMCAo. Two-way ANOVA, calculated for the two factors, treatment and time after
tMCAo, showed that treatment factor (F2,80 = 171.2;
p \ 0.0001), time factor (F3,80 = 106.6; p \ 0.0001) and
interaction between treatment and time (F6,80 = 24.66;
p \ 0.0001) were statistically significant. The Bonferroni
post hoc test indicated that sham-operated rats had a neurological score significantly different from vehicle- and
SCH58261-treated rats at each time point (1, 5, 7 days after
tMCAo, p \ 0.001). Moreover, the Bonferroni post hoc
test indicated that SCH58261, chronically administered,
improved significantly the neurological deficit at 1 day
(p \ 0.01) after tMCAo in respect to vehicle-treated rats.
Effect of SCH58261 on body weight loss
Twenty-four hours after operation, sham-operated rats were
not affected in weight; they increased in body weight as
evaluated up to 7 days after tMCAo. Vehicle-treated rats lost
36.00 ± 1.59 g 1 day after tMCAo, 62.37 ± 7.89 g 5 days
after tMCAo and 60.89 ± 10.99 g 7 days after tMCAo

(F2,60 = 103.5; p \ 0.0001), but not time factor
(F2,60 = 2.29; p \ 0.1), was statistically significant. The
interaction between treatment and time (F4,60 = 5.88;

Seven days after transient ischemia, the cytoarchitecture
characterized by H&E staining showed a remarkable decrease in staining intensity in both cortex and striatum of

vehicle-treated rats (Fig. 3c, d) compared to the sham-operated rats (Fig. 3a, b). The paleness was due to enlargement of the interstitial spaces consequent to edema; in the
parenchyma of ischemic cortex and striatum numerous
small and eterochromatic nuclei belonging to astrocytes
and microglia [27] were present. The typical cytoarchitecture of these two regions (for a description see [31]) was

123

lost. In the striatum, the white matter fascicula (f) was no

columnar organization was not appreciable. Figure 3e, f
show that chronic administration of SCH58261 did not

Myelin distribution studied by an antibody against MAG
showed to be well organized within the white matter fascicula of the caudate-putamen of sham-operated rats (Fig.
4a). The same distribution of MAG labeling appeared in
the contralateral non ischemic hemisphere (data not
shown). In the ischemic striatum of vehicle-treated rats,
MAG labeling was not characterized by the typical profile
of the white matter fascicula but appeared irregularly distributed into fascicula (Fig. 4b). The same irregular distribution of MAG is present in the ischemic striatum of rats
treated with SCH58261 (Fig. 4c).

infiltration 2 days after tMCAo
Table 1 shows that HIS48-positive cells (granulocytes)
were found in cortical and striatal ischemic core of vehicle
rats 2 days after tMCAo. No HIS48-positive cells were
detected into the cortical and striatal tissue of sham-operated rats. Treatment with SCH58261 did not modify the
number of HIS48-positive cells in cortical and striatal ischemic core.

Discussion
The present paper demonstrates that the selective A2A receptor antagonist, SCH58261, administered systemically
soon after tMCAo, protected from neurological deficit
1 day after tMCAo, but not after 5 and 7 days. Seven days
after tMCAo, it did not protect from brain ischemic damage and from the body weight loss. Moreover, SCH58261
did not modify the blood cell infiltration into ischemic
brain areas at 2 days from tMCAo.
These data confirm previous study results [3, 21–23] that
the adenosine A2A receptor antagonist SCH58261, administered soon after ischemia, is able to exert protection in the
first 24 h after ischemia but demonstrate that the A2A antagonist administered at the same dose and administration
route (0.01 mg/kg i.p) does not maintain protection over
time.
Protective effect of SCH58261, in the first 24 h, is accounted for antagonism of the early excessive glutamate
outflow that occurs after ischemia [12]. However, cerebral
ischemia is a complex pathology that rapidly evolves in
time. The early massive increase in extracellular glutamate
after ischemia primes an excitotoxic cascade which in turn

activates brain immune cells that produce mediators of
inflammation [1]. After transient (1 h) focal ischemia induced by MCAo, a definite microglial activation is present
after 12 h [32]. Activated immune cells produce proinflammatory cytokines that upregulate cell adhesion molecules [33, 34] and promote increased permeability of
blood–brain barrier (BBB). It is now accepted that a
massive leukocyte infiltration into ischemic areas, by a

Neurol Sci (2015) 36:1441–1448

disrupted BBB, amplifies the primary ischemic damage
[35, 36]. This is consistent with the view of a neurovascular
unit where any cell type of the brain together with peripheral immune cells dynamically interacts in the pathobiology of stroke [37, 38]. By anti-HIS-48 antibody, we
showed numerous infiltrated granulocytes in ischemic
striatal and cortical areas 2 days after tMCAo. This is in
agreement with observation that after tMCAo, a peak of
neutrophil infiltration occurs at 6 and 48 h thereafter [39].
Three days after tMCAo the majority of immune cells were
described to be neutrophils and at less extent lymphocytes
[32]. Two days after tMCAo, chronic treatment with
SCH58261 did not reduce HIS-48 positive cell infiltration
into ischemic tissue. Thus, explanation of the lack of protection by the A2A receptor antagonist 7 days after ischemia likely lies in the fact that the early protective effect
is overwhelmed by subsequent damage brought about by
massive cell infiltration and neuroinflammation [27, 32,
39]. Neuroinflammation is now recognized as a predominant mechanism of secondary progression of brain
injury after ischemia.
Clarification of the time limit in which A2A receptor
antagonism is protective after brain ischemia might let to
devise a correct therapeutic strategy with A2A receptor
antagonists. At the moment we cannot exclude that the
protection from excitotoxicity by early treatment with A2A
receptor antagonists can be enhanced by a subsequent
treatment performed in a wider therapeutic time-window
with the purpose of limiting the infiltration.
