Biochanin A, an O-methylated natural isoﬂavonoid classiﬁed as phytoestrogen, has been reported to show antitumorigenesis, anti-oxidation, and anti-inﬂammatory properties. However, little is known about the effects of
biochanin A on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. In this study, the neuroprotective and anti-inﬂammatory effects
of biochanin A against ischemia/reperfusion injury, as well as the related molecular mechanisms, were investigated in rat models. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for
2 h, followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Then neurological deﬁcits, infarct volume and brain edema were evaluated.
The MPO activity and TNF-α and IL-1β levels in ischemic boundary zone were determined by a spectrophotometer and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β, and phosphorylation
of p38 were measured by RT-PCR or Western blotting. Consequently, our ﬁndings showed that biochanin A treatment for 14 days had signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume and brain edema, and improved neurological deﬁcits in
focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rats. The MPO activity and TNF-α and IL-1β levels were greatly increased
after ischemia/reperfusion injury, while treatment with biochanin A dramatically suppressed these inﬂammatory
processes. Furthermore, biochanin A attenuated the increase in p-p38 level in the ischemia/reperfusion brain tissue.
Taken together, biochanin A has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, and
the mechanisms may correlate with inhibiting inﬂammatory response, as well as the inactivation of p38 signaling
pathway.

1. Introduction
The most common cause of stroke is the sudden occlusion of a cerebral
artery by a thrombus, resulting in a local depletion of oxygen and glucose
to the brain. Effective stroke therapies require recanalization and neuroprotection [1]. Nowadays, thrombolytic agents and intravascular
techniques have markedly decreased functional deﬁcits. However,
restoration of blood ﬂow and reoxygenation is frequently associated
with an exacerbation of cerebral tissue injury and a profound inﬂammatory response [2]. In other words, cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)
can cause neurovascular injury, leading to cerebral edema, brain
hemorrhage, and neuronal death. Various mechanisms are involved in
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), such as energy failure, elevation
of intracellular Ca2+ level, release of excitatory neurotransmitters, production of oxygen free radicals, inﬂammation, and apoptosis [3]. Over
the past decade, the inﬂammatory response on the damage of cerebral
tissues after ischemia had become a focus. Recently data from many
investigations supported the idea that ischemic/reperfusion injury

triggered inﬂammatory cascades in the brain which may further amplify tissue damage [4,5]. Within minutes of occlusion, there occurs upregulation of proinﬂammatory genes. Thus, effective prevention and
controlling of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury is of great clinical
value.
Nowadays, evidence of the beneﬁcial effects of phytoestrogens in a
variety of neurodegenerative disorders such as acute ischemic stroke
is accumulating [6–8]. Due to the similarity in chemical structure to
the mammalian estrogen, phytoestrogens can selectively bind estrogen
receptors (ERs) to regulate gene expression mediated by estrogen
response elements, and produce estrogenic or/and anti-estrogenic
effects [9,10]. Biochanin A (BCA, C16H12O5, Fig. 1A), isolated from red clover, chickpea or other legumes, is an O-methylated natural isoﬂavonoid
classiﬁed as phytoestrogen. Recently, a number of reports had shown
that biochanin A could exhibit various pharmacological properties,
including anti-tumorigenesis, anti-oxidation, anti-inﬂammatory and
hypoglycemic effects [11–15]. However, little is known about the effects
of BCA on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. Therefore, in the current
study, an effort has been made to estimate the potential beneﬁts of
BCA on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rat, along with the underlying
mechanisms.

2. Materials and methods

2.4. Measurement of infarct volume and brain edema

2.1. Drug and animals

The 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was used to
check the brain infarction size [17]. The rats were anesthetized and
sacriﬁced after the neurological examination. Then the brains were
carefully removed from the skull and kept at −20 °C for 10 min. Frozen
brains were sliced into consecutive 2 mm coronal sections and immersed in a 2% TTC solution for 30 min at 37 °C. The infarct areas
were photographed using a digital camera with a high resolution.
Image analysis software (NIH Image, National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, Version 1.63) was applied to the measurement of the infarcted
area.
Brain water content was measured by the standard wet–dry method.
After 24 h of reperfusion, rats were decapitated and brains were immediately removed. The two hemispheres were weighed (wet weight), separately. Then the tissues were dried at 100 °C for 24 h to determine the dry
weight. The degree of brain edema was calculated by the following equation: water content = (wet weight − dry weight) / wet weight × 100%.

Biochanin A (molecular weight = 284.27, purity N 98%, veriﬁed by
high performance liquid chromatography; purchased from Phytomarker,
China) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to make a 200 mM
stock solution and stored at 4 °C for further use. Male Sprague–Dawley
rats (Grade II, No. 140211) of uniform age, weighing 225 to 285 g, were
obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of Guilin Medical University. All the experimental procedures were performed according to the
National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals. The protocol was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of
Guilin Medical University.
2.2. Focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion model
Rats were randomly assigned to one of the following experimental
groups: sham-operated group, I/R group, and high-, medium- and
low-dose of biochanin A groups (10, 20 and 40 mg·kg·d−1 respectively).
The biochanin A groups were injected intraperitoneally with drugs for
14 days. After 1 h of the last administration, all rats were anesthetized
with 10% chloral hydrate. Then the focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion
rat model was induced using the method of intraluminal vascular occlusion as previously reported with slight modiﬁcation. In brief, a 4-0 nylon
monoﬁlament with a rounded tip was inserted into the right common
external carotid artery, and advanced into the internal carotid until it
blocked the origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). After 2 h of occlusion, reperfusion was achieved by a careful ﬁlament withdrawal to
restore blood ﬂow. For sham-operated rats, the carotid arteries were exposed but no ﬁlament was inserted. The cerebral ischemic/reperfusion
injury model was developed with 2 h of MCA occlusion followed by
24 h reperfusion. During the whole surgical procedure, the rectal temperature was monitored and maintained at 37–38 °C with a heating
pad. The room temperature was controlled in the range of 25–27 °C.
2.3. Neurological deﬁcit evaluation
After 24 h of reperfusion, neurological deﬁcit was scored according
to the 5-point scoring system described by Longa et al. [16]. The scoring
system was used as follows: (1) a score of 0: normal walk or no neurologic deﬁcit; (2) a score of 1: failure to extend opposite forepaw fully or a
mild focal neurologic deﬁcit; (3) a score of 2: circling to the contralateral
side or a moderate focal neurologic deﬁcit; (4) a score of 3: falling to the
contralateral side or a severe focal neurologic deﬁcit; and (5) a score of
4: no spontaneous walking with depressed consciousness level. The
neurological evaluation was performed by an investigator who was
blinded to the study protocol.

2.5. Determination of MPO activity and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)
and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels
After reperfusion for 24 h, rats were decapitated. Brain samples of
the ischemic hemisphere were taken from the cortex of the middle
cerebral artery (MCA) area and the caudate putamen on ice and
stored at − 80 °C for later analysis. The spectrophotometer method
and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method were applied to determine myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Boster, Wuhan, China), respectively.
2.6. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Total RNA from ischemic regions of the right cerebral cortices was
extracted with Trizol reagent kit (Gibco-BRL, USA). The tissues were
collected and were quickly frozen. Then the tissues were transferred
into Trizol in a 1.5 mL tube for 15 min. Chloroform was added into the
tube, shaken vigorously and then incubated for 10 min. The reaction
tube was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. The upper portion
was transferred into another tube. An equal volume of isopropyl alcohol
was added, shaken and incubated for 10 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The RNA pellet was washed with
ice-cold 75% ethanol, and centrifuged at 7500 g for 5 min at 4 °C. The
RNA pellet was air-dried, then dissolved into RNase-free dH2O. RNA
was stored at −80 °C for further use. Total RNA was reverse transcribed
with the RevertAid™, First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, USA)
following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were separated

W. Wang et al. / Journal of the Neurological Sciences 348 (2015) 121–125

on 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and observed under
ultraviolet light. The β-actin served as an internal control, to the level
of which the amount of target mRNA was normalized.
2.7. Western blot analysis
The ischemic regions of cerebral cortices (n = 5 per group) were
prepared in an ice-cold lysis buffer. The lysates were centrifuged at
12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations in the
resulting supernatants were determined by Bio-Rad assay kit. Equal
amounts of protein (40 μg/lane) were separated by sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electropheresis (SDS-PAGE) and blotted
onto 0.22 μm polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad
laboratories, USA). The membranes were blocked by TBST (Tris-buffered
solution, pH 7.6, plus 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dried milk.
Membranes were further incubated sequentially with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. After three washes, the blots were subsequently incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies coupled to
horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 1 h, and then developed in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) Western blot detection reagents (Beyotime, China). The density of each band was quantiﬁed by
using image analysis software (Image J). The phosphor-p38 protein
levels were normalized to total p38.
2.8. Statistics
Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. The Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 13.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was
used for statistical analyses including one-way ANOVA and Student's
t-test. A probability (p)-value b 0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Biochanin A improved the neurological deﬁcits and decreased ischemic
infarcted area and brain edema
Neurological deﬁcit was evaluated after 24 h of reperfusion following
2 h of MCA occlusion. Consequently, obvious neurological deﬁcit was observed in the ischemia/reperfusion group (Fig. 1B), while the rats in the
sham-operated group presented no neurologic deﬁcit, suggesting that
the cerebral ischemia–reperfusion model was successfully constructed.
The neurologic scores of the groups treated with 20 mg∙kg− 1 and
40 mg∙kg− 1 biochanin A were signiﬁcantly lower than those of the

123

ischemia/reperfusion group, indicating that biochanin A ameliorated
the brain function.
Infarct tissues were visualized as an area of unstained part in the
ischemia/reperfusion group, in contrast to the viable tissue, which
stained red, while there were no infract part in the sham-operated
group. As shown in Fig. 2, after the treatment with biochanin A, the infarcted volume and the brain water content were signiﬁcantly reduced
as compared with the ischemia/reperfusion group (p b 0.01).
3.2. Biochanin A inhibited inﬂammatory reaction in cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion
To investigate the effects of biochanin A on inﬂammatory reaction in
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, we determined the MPO activity and
TNF-α and IL-1β levels by spectrophotometer and ELISA methods. As
depicted in Fig. 3, the MPO activity and the TNF-α and IL-1β levels
were signiﬁcantly higher in the I/R group than those of the sham group.
Compared with the I/R group, treatment of biochanin A has shown
obvious signs of alleviating the increase of inﬂammatory mediators in a
dose-dependent manner (p b 0.01 or p b 0.05).
3.3. Biochanin A down-regulated the mRNA expression of IL-1β and TNF-α
in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rats
To further analyze biochanin A-induced anti-inﬂammatory effects,
we also examined the mRNA levels of IL-1β and TNF-α using RT-PCR.
The results suggested that relative mRNA expression of above two cytokines was signiﬁcantly elevated in the I/R group. Treatments with
biochanin A markedly attenuated the increase in mRNA expression
levels of IL-1β and TNF-α in a dose-dependent manner (p b 0.01 or
p b 0.05), indicating that biochanin A exhibited anti-inﬂammatory effects
that were cytoprotective against ischemic/reperfusion brain injury
(Fig. 4).
3.4. Biochanin A down-regulated the phosphorylation of p38 expression in
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rats
P38 is one of the key mediators in the processes of inﬂammation and
cell differentiation. P38 signaling can be activated by inﬂammatory
cytokines, growth factors, as well as by environmental stresses. Therefore, we examined the changes in phosphorylation of p38 (p-p38) expression in the infarct area of the ischemic cerebral cortex. As shown
in Fig. 5, the protein levels of p-p38 remarkably increased in the I/R
model vs the sham-operated rats. Biochanin A attenuated the increase
in p-p38 levels in the ischemic/reperfusion brain tissue (p b 0.01)
(Fig. 5).

4. Discussion
Currently, it is too limited to effectively prevent and treat cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion injury in clinical application. Reassuringly, the
neuroprotective effects of estradiol and phytoestrogen have drawn
great attention in cerebral focal and global ischemia [18,19]. However,
the mechanisms underlying these protective effects are still under investigation. In the present study, biochanin A, a typical phytoestrogen,
exhibited anti-inﬂammatory effects and a downregulation of p-p38,
subsequently improving the brain function and reducing the injured
area in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rats.
One commonly held view is that inﬂammation has been implicated
as a secondary injury mechanism following ischemia stroke [20–22].
Some studies have shown that the inﬂammation in cerebral I/R was developed as an outcome of the two processes: the activation of microglia
and resident perivascular/parenchymal macrophages, and the mobilization and inﬁltration of peripheral inﬂammatory cells into the brain [23].
Pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),
interleukin1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β),
produced by a variety of activated cell types, including endothelial
cells, platelets, leukocytes, and ﬁbroblasts, drive the inﬂammatory process and contribute to irreversible cerebral infarction after the onset of
ischemia stroke. It has been reported that inhibition of TNF-α activity
reduced the size of the cerebral infarct [24,25]. Furthermore, inactivation of IL-1β activity also showed similar results [26]. MPO is a marker

enzyme for the inﬂammatory cells, primarily neutrophil derived. MPO
activity reﬂects neutrophil inﬁltration and correlates well with movement into brain tissues [27]. By measuring its activity, accumulation
and inﬁltration of neutrophils after stroke can be estimated. In our results, TNF-α, IL-1β, and the MPO activities were greatly increased after
24 h of reperfusion following 2 h of MCAO, while treatment with
biochanin A signiﬁcantly suppressed the MPO activity and the levels of
TNF-α and IL-1β. Therefore the anti-inﬂammatory effects of biochanin
A may play neuroprotective effects against ischemia/reperfusion injury
by decreasing neutrophils inﬁltration or pro-inﬂammatory cytokines.
As one of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family
members, p38 has been shown to be involved in the response to various
physiological processes, including cell differentiation, cell cycle and inﬂammation [28]. The p38 signaling pathway can positively regulate the
transcription of pro-inﬂammatory molecules, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and
COX2, and further potentiates the brain tissue injury [29,30]. Inhibition
of MAPK, especially p38 and JNKs, also leads to a decrease in proinﬂammatory mediators after an ischemic injury [31,32]. In the present
study, we observed that p38 MAPK was activated in cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion rats, whereas biochanin A treatment potently restrained
its activation.
In conclusion, our data indicate that biochanin A produces neuroprotective effects via inhibiting inﬂammatory response in cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion rats. The mechanisms underlying the protection
exhibited by biochanin A seem to involve the suppression of p38 signaling

pathways. These results suggested that biochanin A might serve as one of
the promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
However, additional researches are needed to determine the detail
molecular targets mediating the neuroprotective action of biochanin A.
