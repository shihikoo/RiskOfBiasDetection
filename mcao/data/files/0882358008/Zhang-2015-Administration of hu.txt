Introduction

Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in
adults worldwide. So far, the only speciﬁc treatment of acute
ischemic stroke is recanalization of the occluded blood
vessels with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator
(rt-PA). Due to the limitations of available neuroprotective
agents, the early treatment of stroke is of high research
emphasis.
Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a biomaterial rich in cytokines
and growth factors (GFs), which can be manufactured in an
autologous manner and is effective in various models of
sports medicine (Intini, 2009; Moraes et al., 2013), plastic
surgery (Willemsen et al., 2013), myocardial infarction
(Cheng et al., 2012), and peripheral nerve injury (Yu et al.,
2011). However, the potential utility of PRP in ischemic stroke
has yet to be tested. Our hypothesis that PRP may ameliorate
brain function after ischemic stroke was based on the
following reasoning: 1) our former work using local infusion
of human albumin solution in ischemic rats proved to be safe
and effective (Chen et al., 2013), and PRP is composed mainly
of human serum albumin (HSA), thus providing us a rationale
to test the feasibility to administer PRP through intra-arterial
infusion; and 2) unlike HSA, PRP can provide biological
support by secreting various neuroprotective and neurotrophic GFs including platelet derived growth factor (PDGF),
transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (bFGF),
epithelial growth factor (EGF) (Boswell et al., 2012). There are
three major biological processes implicated in neural repair,
namely angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity
which have been documented to occur in adult rat brains in
response to injury, but also could be stimulated through cellbased therapies (Font et al., 2010). To this end, platelet
derived GFs may enhance neurogenesis, modulate synaptic
plasticity, positively affect neurite growth, branching and
elimination, altogether may confer superior efﬁcacy than
HSA in affording functional recovery following ischemic
injury. In the present study, we investigated the potential
beneﬁt of intra-arterial infusion of PRP lysate in a rat model of
ischemic stroke.

Results

2.1.

Growth factor production in PRP lysate

A centrifuge spin of 200 g for 6 min achieved platelet enrichment from whole blood by 185%, from 234.6710.3 to
432.0714.9 (platelets  10\widehat9/L peripheral blood)
(Table 1). The ﬁnal platelet concentration of our plasma
production met the Red Cross deﬁnition of PRP (4200  10
\widehat9 platelets/L) (Boswell et al., 2012).

It has been demonstrated that GFs are released from platelets in native (rather than recombinant) form and presumably in
a biologically relevant ratio (Foster et al., 2009). PDGF-BB and
TGF-β1 were chosen as representative GFs because of their
demonstrated close association with PRP. Accordingly, GF levels
of each PRP lysate sample from ﬁve donors were determined by
ELISA. The mean levels of PDGF-BB and TGF-β1 were
10.7070.995 (ng/mL) and 48.3272.79 (ng/mL), respectively, while
the same growth factors in HSA were -0.5570.001 (ng/mL) and
1.8570.696 (ng/mL) (Fig. 1).

2.2.

Physiological parameters

There were no signiﬁcant differences with respect to blood
pH, PCO2, and mean arterial pressure among the local treatment groups (Table 2). Local PRP lysate treatment signiﬁcantly elevated PO2 levels compared with stroke without
treatment (Po0.05). As for the blood glucose levels, since
the rats were non-fasting, the notable individual differences
were expected, and the signiﬁcant increase seen in both the
local saline group and the local HSA group after MCA occlusion held no practical implications. Body temperature was
maintained at E37 1C.

2.3.

Infarct volume and neurological deﬁcit

At 24 h after reperfusion, brain infarct volume was detected.
ANOVA revealed signiﬁcant treatment effect (Po0.01). Infarct
volume in the stroke without treatment group was 49.771.8%
(n ¼9). The local saline group (40.171.7%, n ¼10), local HSA
group (37.472.1%, n ¼10) and systemic PRP lysate group
(39.973.0%, n ¼9), which did not signiﬁcantly differ among
themselves, but were signiﬁcantly reduced compared with
stroke animals that received no treatment (Po0.01). The local
PRP lysate group showed the greatest decrease in infarct
volume (31.072.7%, n¼ 10), which was signiﬁcantly reduced
compared to no treatment group, but even when compared
with local saline group, local HSA group or systemic PRP
lysate group (Po0.05) (Fig. 2).
At 30 min after reperfusion, ischemic animals demonstrated apparent neurological deﬁcits with no signiﬁcant
difference between groups (score of 3.970.3, and 4.070.3,
and 3.770.3, and 3.970.2, and 3.870.2) (Fig. 3). At 24 h after
reperfusion, stroke rats in the no treatment group maintained a high neurological deﬁcit score (3.770.2). All of the
treatment groups including local saline group (2.670.2), local
HSA group (2.270.3), local PRP lysate group (1.670.2), and
systemic PRP lysate group (2.870.1) displayed signiﬁcantly
reduced neurological deﬁcits compared to those stroke animals with no treatment (Po0.01). Interestingly, stroke rats in
the local PRP lysate group showed a much further reduction
of neurological deﬁcits when compared with the other treatment groups (Po0.05) (Fig. 3).

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report to
demonstrate that administration of human PRP lysate
attenuates infarct volume and neurological deﬁcits in experimental ischemic stroke.
Our previous study suggested that local pre-reperfusion
saline infusion offered neuroprotection by reducing inﬂammatory reaction (Ding et al., 2002). In our current study,
infarct volume decreases and motor function improvements
in all local intra-artery treatment groups further conﬁrmed
the beneﬁts of the procedure of pre-reperfusion ﬂushing into
ischemic territory. However, the local PRP lysate group
achieved the maximal neuroprotection, suggesting an additional therapeutic mechanism.

Platelets may produce a number of growth factors including
PDGF, TGF-β, VEGF, bFGF, and EGF (Boswell et al., 2012), which, in
turn, provide additional neuroprotection. TGF-βs were reported
to possess neuroprotective actions against hypoxic events in
experimental models of ischemia (Zhu et al., 2002; Gross et al.,
1993; Prehn et al., 1993), while antagonizing the inﬂuence of TGFβ1 with an injection of a soluble TGF-β type II receptor, which
binds TGF-β1 and prevents its biological actions, resulted in a
dramatic increase in infarct area (Ruocco et al., 1999). The PDGFB/PDGF receptor (PDGFR)-β system was not only shown to
contribute to neuroprotection, but also to support angiogenesis
and vascular remodeling by mediating interactions of endothelial cells with pericytes after cerebral ischemia (Renner et al.,
2003; Krupinski et al., 1997; Shen et al., 2012). bFGF has been
reported to be involved in the pathophysiological changes
following cerebral infarction (Osterhout et al., 1997; Issa et al.,

Fig. 2 – PRP lysate infusion reduces infarct volume. (a) Representative brain slices stained by TTC 24 h after reperfusion in

lysate infusion group signiﬁcantly reduces infarct volume when compared to stroke without treatment group (nnPo0.01), and
exhibits a further reduction when compared with the other treatment groups (#Po0.05).

Fig. 3 – PRP lysate infusion improves motor function.
Neurological scores are comparable during early reperfusion
(30 min). At 24 h after reperfusion, all the treatment groups
reduce neurological deﬁcits compared to stroke without
treatment (nnPo0.01), and there is a further neurological
improvement in the local PRP lysate group than the other
treatment groups (#Po0.05).
2005), and the level of serum bFGF could be of value to estimate
the infarction size and clinical prognosis (Guo et al., 2006).

Animal data suggested that bFGF protected against ischemic
injury in the brains of both young adult (Ay et al., 1999; Li,
Stephenson, 2002) and aged adult (Won et al., 2006) rodents.
VEGF, a potent mitogen of vascular endothelial cells, was
implicated as another promising cytoprotective agent for
ischemic stroke, in that elevated serum VEGF levels correlated
with smaller infarct volumes and improved long-term prognoses
in acute ischemic stroke patients (Lee et al., 2010). However,
studies in rodent models of acute stroke have shown both
positive (Hayashi et al., 1998; Harrigan et al., 2003; Sun et al.,
2003) and negative (Zhang et al., 2000) effects of VEGF treatment,
suggesting that the acute neuroprotective effects of VEGF appear
to depend on the dose administered, as well as the route of
administration. Altogether, accumulating data from pre-clinical
and clinical studies provide evidence that GFs, in particular, TGFβ, PDGF, bFGF, and VEGF can improve stroke outcome by
reducing stroke damage through their anti-apoptotic and antiinﬂammatory effects, and by promoting angiogenesis and neurogenesis (Ren, Finklestein, 2005). Here, we quantiﬁed two
identiﬁed growth factors present in PRP, the PDGF and TGF-β.
Our data showed signiﬁcantly higher amounts of cytokines in
PRP lysate compared with HSA. The present PRP lysate cocktail,
administrated in locally or systemically, reduced brain infarct
volume and neurological deﬁcit induced by experimental
ischemic stroke. The results were consistent with our primary

brain research 1594 (2015) 267–273

hypothesis of taking advantage of the acute neuroprotective
effects of GFs. Nonetheless, further analysis is needed to understand the cellular responses within the ischemic stroke brain, to
determine which speciﬁc GFs mediate the observed therapeutic
effects, and to investigate the long-term neurotrophic roles of
these agents.
It appears that systemically administered GFs can cross
the BBB to exert pharmacological effects, especially following
stroke (Fisher et al., 1995). However, dose-associated toxicity
has aborted a North American Trial of bFGF (5 or 10 mg,
intravenously) (Clark et al., 2000), and the optimal delivery
route is still undetermined. Recent studies have shown that
intra-arterial drug infusion results in high local drug concentration and reduced systemic side effects (Woitzik, Schilling,
2007). In our present study, when directly infused into the
ischemic cerebral area, the PRP lysate exerted superior
neuroprotection than systemic infusion of an equal dose in
infarct volume (31.0% vs 39.9%, Po0.05) and neurological
deﬁcits (score of 1.6 vs 2.8, Po0.0 5). Here, although the PRP
lysate was locally administrated, no macroscopic thromboembolic phenomenon was found during histological examination. To avoid intra-arterial infusion-induced thromboembolic complications, we controlled the aggregation capacity of the platelet in the following aspects. First, our method
to release growth factors from PRP involved physical lyses of
the platelets by freezing to disrupt cell membrane, rather
than activation of the platelets by thrombin or calcium. In
addition, before treatment infusion, we employed centrifugation and collected the supernatant to produce PRP lysate,
while the platelet pellet was discarded. Thus, the ﬁnal
product consisted mainly of growth factors buffered with
plasma. Second, the gentle centrifugation approach (200 g for
6 min) to enrich platelets here was reported to effectively
avoid premature platelet activation, thus avoiding the production of coagulation signaling elements such as TXA2 or
ADP to activate nearby platelets (Gonshor, 2002). Finally, the
venous blood samples were collected using vacutainer tubes
containing ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) (K2), thus
the PRP lysate agent was EDTA pretreated, which reduced the
possibility of intra-arterial thrombosis.
Compared to other commercially available neurotrophic
agents, PRP may hold superior beneﬁts. The autologous
potential of PRP would guarantee the low or null risk of
infection or immune reactions. Another advantage of PRP
over a single exogenous neurotrophic agents/GFs is that GFs
are released from platelets in native form and presumably in
a biologically relevant ratio (Foster et al., 2009). Thus a
balanced, complementary set of bioactive GFs found in PRP
may give synergistic effect rather than speciﬁc neurotrophic
agents. Furthermore, PRP is also much less expensive and
subject to fewer regulatory restrictions than a recombinant
neurotrophic agent (Boswell et al., 2012).
A previous study indicates that the prior presence of a TIA in
humans is associated with an early good outcome in nonlacunar
ischemic strokes, thus suggesting a neuroprotective effect of TIA
possibly by inducing a phenomenon of ischemic tolerance
(Arboix et al., 2004). It may be possible that TIA or other ischemic
conditioning affects PRP and thus contributed to the resulting
neuroprotection. In our future study, we will determine how TIA/
ischemic conditioning affect alteration in PRP.

271

We are cognizant of the numerous neuroprotective strategies that failed in human clinical trials (e.g., citicoline,
Dávalos et al., 2012). The present study opens new encouraging perspectives for the protection of the brain from the
ischemic injury. A prospective randomized trial of intraarterial infusion of PRP lysate may be justiﬁed in humans,
but we are cautious of laboratory-to-clinic translation of
experimental treatments.

Experimental procedures

4.1.

Generation of platelet-rich plasma lysate

We adopted a simpliﬁed platelet lysate preparation method
(Centeno et al., 2010). Five healthy adult male volunteers
2771.2 (mean7SEM), not on any medications were fasted
overnight. Venous blood samples were collected in 10- mL
vacutainer tubes containing ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid
(EDTA) (K2) solution (Becton, Dickinson, and Company). An
aliquot was removed to determine the platelet count. Then
the whole blood was separated into PRP and erythrocytes by
centrifugation at 200 g for 6 min; PRP was drawn off and
stored at -80 1C; Before use, frozen PRP was thawed in a
water-bath (37 1C) within several minutes; Platelet bodies
were centrifuged at 1500 g for 6 min, and the supernatant
drawn off to produce PRP lysate; Finally, pooled samples
prepared from PRP lysate obtained from ﬁve different donors
were used to minimize variations between donors. The
informed consents have been obtained from the volunteers
and all protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board
(IRB) of Xuanwu Hospital of the Capital Medical University.

4.2.

In vitro cytokine assay

The levels of PDGF-BB and TGF-β1 generated by platelet lysis
were assayed by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) (R&D
Systems, Inc).

4.3.

Animal experimental protocol

Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study
(280–320 g, Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co Ltd,
China). Blood PCO2 and PO2, mean arterial pressure, as well as
rectal temperature were measured throughout the procedure.
A circulating heating pad and a heating lamp were used to
maintain rectal temperature at 36.5 1C to 37.5 1C. Animal care
was in compliance with guidelines approved by the Capital
Medical University.
Focal cerebral ischemia was generated as previously
described (Ren et al., 2011). Anesthesia was induced and
maintained with 1.5–3.5% enﬂuane in 70% nitrous oxide and
30% oxygen (Bickford veterinary anesthesia equipment model
no. 61010; AM Bickford Inc., Wales Center, NY, USA). A 90minute right middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion was
induced using an intraluminal ﬁlament. Before reperfusion,
0.9% saline, human Alb solution (HUALAN Biological Engineering, Inc., 10% Solution), or human PRP lysate were
infused. All agents were at room temperature during infusion. Animals were randomly divided into 5 groups: (1)

272

brain research 1594 (2015) 267–273

nontreatment group (n ¼9): 90- min right MCA occlusion
followed by 24 h of reperfusion; (2) local saline infusion group
(5 mL/kg body weight, 0.9% saline, n¼ 10); (3) local HSA
infusion group (5 mL/kg body weight, 10% HSA, n¼ 10); (4)
local human PRP lysate infusion group (5 mL/kg body weight,
10% total protein, n¼ 10); (5) systemic human PRP lysate
infusion group (5 mL/kg body weight, 10% total protein,
intra-femoral vein injection, n¼ 9). All studies were performed in a blinded and randomized manner.

4.4.

Neurological examination

Neurological deﬁcits in rats were examined before surgery
and after reperfusion (at 30 min and 24 h). The deﬁcits were
scored based on the modiﬁed scoring system proposed by
Ding et al. (Ding et al., 2002), as follows: 0, no deﬁcits; 1,
difﬁculty in fully extending the contralateral forelimb; 2,
unable to extend the contralateral forelimb; 3, mild circling
to the contralateral side; 4, severe circling; and 5, falling to the
contralateral side. Greater scores indicate a more severe
deﬁcit.

4.5.

Cerebral infarct volume

Infarct volume was measured according to methods as
described previously (Chen et al., 2013). Twenty-four hours
after reperfusion, rats were anesthetized with 1% chloral
hydrate. Coronal brain sections with a 2-mm thickness were
removed, and stained with 2% solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium-chloride (Sigma, USA). To minimize error introduced by edema, infarct volume of the ischemic region was
normalized to the non-ischemic region and expressed as a
percentage of contralateral brain volume.

4.6.

Statistical analysis

All data were described as mean7SEM. Statistical analysis
was performed with SPSS for Windows, version 17.0 (SPSS
Inc.). The differences among groups were assessed using oneway ANOVA, followed by posthoc tests with signiﬁcance level
set at Po0.05.
