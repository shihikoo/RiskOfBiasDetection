Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is the major
complication in intravenous thrombolytic therapy (Group,
1997; Tanahashi, 2009; Calleja et al., 2013; Jickling
et al., 2014), which is considered to be the most eﬃcacious treatment for acute ischemic stroke (Fisher and
Brott, 2003; Chapman et al., 2014). The narrow therapeutic window (up to 4.5 h after symptom onset) for thrombolytic treatment and the absence of drugs aﬀecting the
coagulation status limit the use of thrombolytic therapy
in some ischemic stroke patients. Moreover, recombinant
tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) treatment increases
the risk of HT especially when administered too late.
Several cellular mechanisms of HT have been illustrated
by previous studies, including oxidative stress (Chen
et al., 2010; Llombart et al., 2014), inﬂammatory reaction
(Rosell et al., 2008) (Liu et al., 2014) and disruption of the
blood–brain barrier (BBB) due to the tight junction
reduction (Scalzo et al., 2013; Jha et al., 2014;
Ozkul-Wermester et al., 2014).
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3), the precursor
of neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), is an essential omega-3fatty acid concentrated in the central nervous system.
After being systematically administrated, free DHA is
transmitted through the blood stream and concentrated
in synapses and cellular membranes in the brain and
retina. Under oxidative stress like ischemia, DHA is
converted to NPD1 through 15-lipoxygenase-1 in the
nervous system and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE)
cells and released from the cell membranes (Calandria
et al., 2009). Rats treated with low (3.5 or 7 mg/kg) and
medium (16 or 35 mg/kg) doses of DHA after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) onset showed signiﬁcantly
reduced infarct volumes (Belayev et al., 2009). Similar
neuroprotective eﬀect of DHA complex to albumin
(DHA-Alb) was observed in permanent MCAO (Eady
et al., 2012). Moreover, Hong et al. (2015) showed that
DHA protected ischemia-induced BBB disruption. Since
BBB disruption is closely related to HT, we hypothesize
that DHA may decrease the risk of HT transformation
after stroke. As hyperglycemia, BBB leakage and inﬂammation are closely related with HT transformation, we
therefore assessed the eﬀects of DHA on the integrity of
BBB, hyperglycemia-enhanced HT and the associated

Abstract—Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is a feared complication of cerebral ischemic infarction, especially following the use of thrombolytic therapy. In this study, we
examined whether docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3),
an omega-3 essential fatty acid family member, can protect
the brain from injury and whether DHA can decrease the risk
of HT enhanced by hyperglycemia after focal ischemic
injury. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were injected with 50%
dextrose (6 ml/kg intraperitoneally) to induce hyperglycemia
10 min before 1.5 h of ﬁlament middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed. Treatment with DHA (10 mg/kg)
5 min before reperfusion reduced HT and further improved
the 7-day neurological outcome. It also reduced infarct volume, which is consistent with the restricted DWI and T2WI
hyperintensive area. Reduced Evans Blue extravasation
and increased expression of collagen IV indicated the
improved integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) in
DHA-treated rats. Moreover, DHA reduced the expression
of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in the
ischemic injured brain. Therefore, we conclude that DHA
attenuated hyperglycemia-enhanced HT and improved neurological function by preserving the integrity of BBB and
reducing inﬂammation. Ó 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

inﬂammatory response after transient focal ischemia in
rats.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Surgical preparation and procedure
All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the Zhejiang University
(ZJU201312-1-02-092). Male Sprague–Dawley rats
weighing 280–350 g were fasted overnight but allowed
free access to water before the ﬁlament MCAO was
performed. The rats were anesthetized using 4% chloral
hydrate (400 mg/kg, i.p). Laser-Doppler ﬂowmetry
(Periﬂux system 5000; Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden)
was used to monitor regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF)
before, during and after the surgery with the probe
positioned 2 mm posterior and 5 mm lateral from the
Bregma. CBF values were recorded every 10 min. The
ﬁlament MCAO procedure was performed as previously
described (Bederson et al., 1986). Brieﬂy, a 3-0 nylon
suture (Sunbio Biotech Ltd., Beijing) was inserted into
the right common carotid artery through the internal carotid artery to cause an occlusion at the MCA. At 1.5 h after
occlusion, the ﬁlament was carefully removed. Animals
that did not show a signiﬁcant reduction in rCBF during
MCAO or rapid restoration of the laser-Doppler signal during reperfusion were excluded from the experiment. All
rats were intraperitoneally injected with 50% dextrose
(6 ml/kg) 5 min before MCAO to induce acute hyperglycemia according to Lou et al. (2007). The right femoral
artery was catheterized to obtain blood samples for blood
gas analysis before and after surgery. However, blood
was obtained from the tail vein for glucose-level analysis
before and after the administration of dextrose. Rectal
temperature was maintained between 36 °C and 37 °C
during the surgical procedures.
DHA administration
Previous studies suggest that large doses of DHA
(70 mg/kg) had no protective eﬀects, while low (3.5 or
7 mg/kg) and medium (16 or 35 mg/kg) doses
decreased infarction (Belayev et al., 2009). In our preliminary studies, we tested multiple dosages of DHA
(5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) based on data from
other reports, and found that 10 mg/kg was more eﬀective
against HT than 5 mg/kg, while the eﬀect of the 20 mg/kg
dose was similar to 10 mg/kg (data not shown).
Therefore, the dosage of 10 mg/kg was chosen for the formal experiment. DHA (10 mg/kg) was dissolved in saline
and administered intravenously at a constant rate over
3 min using an infusion pump 5 min before reperfusion
according to the methods described by Belayev et al.
(2009). Control rats received an intravenous infusion of
a comparable volume of 0.1 mol/L phosphate-buﬀered
solution (PBS). Four experiments were performed and
rats were randomly assigned to the DHA-treated group
and control group. In the ﬁrst experiment (n = 15 per
group), rats were sacriﬁced 24 h after MCAO and brain
slices were used for HT evaluation, TTC staining and
spectrophotometric assay of intracerebral hemorrhage in

order. In the second experiment (n = 10 per group), rats
were used for BBB permeability measurements. In the
third experiment (n = 5 per group), arterial gases were
measured perioperatively and MR scans were performed
24 h after reperfusion followed by immunohistochemistry.
In the fourth experiment (n = 10 per group), neurological
scores were evaluated at 24 h, 3 days and 7 days after
MCAO.
Neurological scores
The neurological scores were evaluated by an observer
blinded to the treatment groups at 24 h, and 3 and
7 days after MCAO using the Garcia scoring system
reported with modiﬁcations (Garcia et al., 1995). The neurologic evaluation described by Garcia and colleagues
(1995) consists of the following six tests: 1, spontaneous
activity; 2, symmetry in the movement of four limbs; 3,
forepaw outstretching; 4, climbing; 5, body proprioception;
and 6, response to vibrissae touch. Severe impairments
in each of the tests were graded 0 or 1, and no observable
deﬁcits were graded 3. The minimum neurologic score is
3, and the maximum is 18 (i.e., in intact rats).
2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium Chloride (TTC) staining
and evaluation of infarct volume
Rats were anesthetized with 4% chloral hydrate, perfused
transcardially with 0.1 mol/L PBS and sacriﬁced 24 h
post-stroke. The brains were rapidly removed and sliced
into 2-mm-thick coronal sections. We ﬁrst took pictures
of the whole and sliced brain to observe if HT was
present. Then brain slices were immersed in 2% TTC
(Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark (Yin et al.,
2003). The infarction and hemisphere area of each section were traced and measured using an Image J analysis
system. The possible interference of brain edema with
infarct volume was corrected by standard methods (whole
contralateral hemisphere volume-non ischemic ipsilateral
hemisphere volume) and the infract volume was
expressed as a percentage of the whole contralateral
hemisphere (Gao et al., 2006).
MR scans
MR T2-weighed images (T2WI) and diﬀusion-weighted
imaging (DWI) were chosen to assess infarct volume
and reperfusion injury. Rats were re-anesthetized 24 h
after reperfusion and coronal scans were obtained using
a GE Signa HD 3.0 T scanner (TR 2000 ms, TE 90 ms,
ﬁeld of view read 50 mm, thick 1.5 mm, 8 slices, scan
time 5 min for T2WI; thick 2 mm, interval 0 mm, ﬁeld of
view 240 * 240 m2, matrix 256 * 256, b value 1000, scan
time 32 s for DWI).
Evaluation of HT
The subtype of HT in the coronal slice was classiﬁed
according to the criteria described by Aronowski et al.
(2003): hemorrhagic infarction 1 (HI-1): with scattered,
heterogeneous petechiae along the margins of the infarction; hemorrhagic infarction 2 (HI-2): that is more conﬂuent, but heterogeneous petechiae are still present within

473

the infarcted area; parenchymal hemorrhage 1 (PH-1):
with a homogeneous hematoma covering < 30% of the
infarcted area and only a mild space-occupying eﬀect;
parenchymal hemorrhage 2 (PH-2): with a dense hematoma > 30% of the lesion volume and a signiﬁcant
space-occupying eﬀect.
Spectrophotometric assay of intracerebral
hemorrhage
Cerebral hemorrhage was quantiﬁed with a previously
described spectrophotometric assay (Choudhri et al.,
1997) with some modiﬁcation. Initially, a standard curve
was obtained using a ‘‘virtual’’ hemorrhage model.
Hemispheric brain tissue was obtained from naive rats
subjected to complete transcardial perfusion to remove
intravascular blood. Incremental volumes of homologous
blood (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 ll) were added to each brain tissue sample with PBS to reach a total volume of 3 ml, followed by homogenization for 30 s, sonication on ice for
1 min, and centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min.
Drabkin’s reagent (1.6 ml, Sigma, Saint Louis, Missouri,
USA) was added to 0.4 ml supernatant aliquots and
allowed to stand for 15 min at room temperature. Optical
density was measured and recorded at 540 nm (Sun
et al., 2010) with a spectrophotometer (Tu-1901,
Persee, Beijing, China). These procedures yielded a linear relationship between measured hemoglobin concentrations in perfused brain and the volume of added
blood. Hemorrhage measurements were performed on
brains already stained with TTC for infarct quantitation.
It has been shown that TTC staining did not alter the
spectrophotometric hemoglobin assay (Choudhri et al.,
1997).
Measurement of BBB permeability
BBB permeability was assessed by measuring the Evans
Blue extravasated in the brain. Brieﬂy, Evans Blue (4%,
1 ml/kg) was injected 24 h after reperfusion via the left
femoral vein. One hour after the Evans Blue injection,
animals were perfused with heparinized saline solution.
After decapitation, brains were removed, weighed, and
homogenized in 1.0 ml of 0.1 mol/L phosphate-buﬀered
saline, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. Then
0.6 ml of the resultant supernatant was added to an
equal volume of trichloroacetic acid. After overnight
incubation at 4 °C and centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for
30 min, the supernatant was measured at 615 nm for
absorbance using a spectrophotometer (Tu-1901,
Persee, Beijing, China). The tissue content of Evans
Blue was quantiﬁed from a linear standard curve and
was expressed as micrograms per gram of brain tissue
(Belayev et al., 1996).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunostaining was performed on coronal sections
obtained from rats that were killed 24 h after MCAO.
The tissues were embedded in paraﬃn and coronally
sectioned at 5-lm thickness. To examine the integrity of
the cerebral microvessels, a mouse anti-rat type IV

collagen (Abcam, USA) was used at a titer of 1:500. To
examine the cerebral inﬂammatory responses, a
monoclonal anti-rat intercellular adhesion molecule-1
(ICAM-1) anti-body (Sigma, USA) was used at a titer of
1:100. For quantitative measurement of collagen IV and
ICAM-1 expression, ﬁve non-overlapping ﬁelds of view
in the ischemic boundary zone were analyzed. Images
were recorded by a microscope using a 20 objective
and stored in tagged image ﬁle format. Images were
then analyzed with the Image-Pro Plus 6 software. The
area of IV-C immunoreactive vessels was calculated
and presented as a percentage of the scan area.
Statistical analysis
Data were presented as mean ± SD. Statistical
signiﬁcance was analyzed by a two-tailed Student t test
for continuous variables and by v2 test for the rate of
HT and mortality. A probability value of <0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

RESULTS
Mortality rate and blood data
The total mortality rate was 23.5% versus 16.7% (control
versus DHA) by 24 h, and 46.7% versus 20% (control
versus DHA) by 7 days. Blood glucose levels reached
its crest 1.5 h after administration in both groups and
were maintained above baseline levels until 4.5 h. No
perceptible diﬀerences were made by DHA on the blood
glucose levels (Fig. 1A). No signiﬁcant diﬀerence of
rCBF was observed between the DHA and control group
(Fig. 1B).
DHA protected against infarct injury
In animals receiving DHA, percentage of infarct volume
was signiﬁcantly reduced compared to the saline group
24 h after MCAO (control versus DHA, 24.07 ± 6.73%
versus 15.62 ± 4.38%, n = 13, P < 0.01; Fig. 2A, B).
Treatment with DHA also triggered better neurological
outcomes throughout the study interval, evaluated at
24 h (control versus DHA, 8.39 ± 0.43 versus
11.77 ± 0.64, P < 0.01), 72 h (9.09 ± 0.46 versus
12.58 ± 0.47, P < 0.01) and 7 days (10.67 ± 0.33
versus 12.82 ± 0.48, P < 0.01).
DHA attenuated both DWI and T2WI hyperintensive
volume
MR scans were performed at 24 h. Saline-treated rats
showed extensive DWI lesions in the cortical and
subcortical area, while rats treated with DHA exhibited
less extensive lesion areas, mostly in the subcortical
area (DHA versus control, 0.87 ± 0.26 versus
1.19 ± 0.23 cm3, n = 5, P < 0.01) (Fig. 3A, B). T2weighed images also showed decreased lesion volumes
in the DHA-treated group (DHA versus control,
0.69 ± 0.19 versus 1.03 ± 0.28 cm3, n = 5, P < 0.01)
(Fig. 3C, D).

DHA reduced HT after reperfusion
To examine whether DHA treatment would attenuate
hemorrhagic injury, hemorrhagic severity was graded.
Macroscopic hemorrhage was signiﬁcantly reduced by
the administration of DHA (4/15 versus 11/15) (Fig. 4).
Parenchymal hemorrhage (PH) was observed in ﬁve
rats in the control group, while in the DHA group, there
was only one, indicating that DHA treatment was
associated with reduced PH. PH-1 occurred in 2/15 rats
in the control group and 1/15 in the DHA group, and the
appearance of PH-2 was 3/15 and 0/15 correspondingly.
Furthermore, spectrophotometric assay also indicated
smaller blood volume in DHA-treated rats (control
versus DHA, 10.37 ± 2.05 versus 2.17 ± 1.76 ll,
n = 10, P < 0.01) (Fig. 5A).

DHA protected the microvascular basal membrane
and inhibited inﬂammation
Immunohistochemistry results showed that the number of
microvessels expressing collagen type IV, a major basal
membrane structural protein, was higher in the DHA
group than control. Quantitative measurements of the
microvessel area favored the same result (DHA versus
control, 4.28 ± 0.58 versus 2.97 ± 0.43%, P < 0.01)
(Fig. 6A, B). The expression of ICAM-1, a cell surface
glycoprotein in endothelial cells and immune cells, was
reduced in the DHA-treated group (DHA versus control,
2.91 ± 0.98
versus
6.47 ± 1.27%,
P < 0.01),
compared with the control (Fig. 6C, D).

DISCUSSION
DHA reduced BBB permeability
Evans Blue extravasation was detected quantitatively to
evaluate the structural integrity of BBB. DHA treatment
signiﬁcantly
decreased
the
post-ischemic
BBB
permeability after MCA occlusion (control versus DHA,
16.07 ± 2.33
versus
10.82 ± 2.48 lg/g
brain,
P < 0.01) (Fig. 5B).

We showed that the administration of DHA right before
reperfusion attenuated HT, decreased infarct volume,
and improved neurological outcome in the ischemic
stroke rat model with hyperglycemia. In addition, we
found that DHA inhibited the inﬂammatory reaction
mediated by ICAM-1 and stabilized the BBB due to
inhibited collagen IV degradation.

Fig. 4. DHA inhibited hemorrhagic transformation. Hemorrhages of each brain were assessed and classiﬁed into ﬁve indicated types above: (1) no
hemorrhage (white); (2) HI-1 (blue); (3) HI-2 (yellow); (4) PH-1 (red); (5) PH-2 (black). Data were expressed in numbers of animals in two groups.
DHA reduced macroscopic hemorrhage (4 HT in the DHA group versus 11 in the control group) and severity of HT (two PH in DHA group versus ﬁve
in control group). (n = 15, arrow indicated hemorrhage). (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to

In this current study, we investigated the protective
eﬀects of DHA rather than NPD1, because 1, NPD1 is a
well-studied neuroprotectant against brain injury,
including stroke. It promotes cell survival and inhibits
apoptosis, as well as attenuates leukocyte inﬁltration
and inﬂammatory gene expression (Marcheselli et al.,
2003; Bazan et al., 2010). 2, NPD1 is a DHA derivative.
Both endogenous and administrated DHA will be synthesized into NPD1. 3, DHA is one of the major long-chain
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the human diet,
which is easily obtainable, while NPD1 is an endogenous
derivative, making it less available. Therefore, it was more
meaningful to study the protective eﬀects of DHA against
HT.
A pre-ischemic hyperglycemic experimental model
was chosen to induce a larger ischemic infarct size and
more severe hemorrhage, which resembles an ischemic
stroke of a large brain region (Belayev et al., 2003;
Huang et al., 2013). This model was widely used in experimental ischemic stroke to assess the drug eﬀects on HT
(Hu et al., 2011; Soejima et al., 2013). We have previously conﬁrmed the validity and feasibility of this model
(Zhang et al., 2013).
Previous studies on the neuroprotective eﬀects of
DHA emphasized its eﬀect to attenuate the infarct area
and improve neurological scores. Both chronic dietary
intake and a single injection of DHA before stroke onset
were proved to be neuroprotective (Pan et al., 2009) (de
Wilde et al., 2002; Cao et al., 2004). In addition, a direct
infusion of DHA into the third ventricle of a mouse brain
after MCAO also improved neurobiological recovery and
reduced brain damage (Marcheselli et al., 2003).
Furthermore, administration of DHA 3 h after MCA occlusion onset reduced the total infarct volume by 40%
(Belayev et al., 2011). This eﬀect can be explained by

the elevated NPD1 synthesis after DHA administration
in the penumbra area in the acute ischemic stroke model
(Belayev et al., 2011). NPD1 exhibited its neuroprotective
eﬀects by reducing leukocyte inﬁltration, inhibiting inﬂammatory factor expressions (Marcheselli et al., 2003) and
attenuating oxidative stress induced apoptosis (Pan
et al., 2009). We further conﬁrmed this beneﬁcial eﬀect
in the hyperglycemic ischemic stroke model. Infarct volume was reduced to approximately 60% of the control
and neurological scores were improved up to day 7 after
stroke onset in the DHA-treated group, which is consistent with the inhibited lesion area measured with DWI
and T2WI.
BBB disruption is one of the most common alterations
in the early stage of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, which
leads to secondary brain injury. Electron microscopy and
lectin staining indicated that structural alterations in the
endothelium were the predominant cause of BBB
disruption in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (Krueger
et al., 2015). One recent study showed that EB extravasation in the ischemic hemisphere was decreased by 30%
(6 h after MCAO), 48% (24 h) and 38% (72 h) by DHA
administration (Hong et al., 2015). Therefore, we hypothesized that DHA might attenuate HT by stabilizing BBB.
We have reported that attenuated HT was found in
DHA-treated rats. Our results indicate that DHA attenuated brain injury by both reducing the severity of HT and
decreasing blood volume. Attenuated HT can be
explained by the decreased permeability of the BBB,
which is consistent with a previous study by Pan et al.
(2009). Our results showed that DHA increased the
expression of collagen IV, which is the main component
of capillary endothelial cells. Type IV collagen chains
could represent the integrity of BBB to a large extent
(Hawkins and Davis, 2005; Pardridge, 2007). Thus, we

477

Y. Lin et al. / Neuroscience 301 (2015) 471–479

posit that the increased integrity of BBB by DHA is related
with the increased expression of collagen IV on the basal
lamina. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility
that the eﬀects of DHA treatment on collagen IV and
ICAM-1 at 24 h after stroke are solely due to the results
of the reduction in brain lesion in the DHA-treated rats.
It is likely that DHA protects against HT by inhibiting
the inﬂammatory response, as our results showed that
DHA inhibited ICAM-1 expression and maintained BBB
integrity. ICAM-1 is a transmembrane protein in
endothelial cells, which is important in facilitating
leukocyte transmigration and adhesion. Previous studies
showed that a blockage of the inﬂammatory pathway,
including ICAM-1, attenuated focal ischemic injury (Funk
et al., 2013) and, drug-induced inhibition of ICAM-1 had
a neuroprotective eﬀect against ischemia (Cheng et al.,
2006). Moreover, DHA inhibited the expression of
ICAM-1 in an in vitro model and attenuated the adhesion
of monocytes to human aortic endothelial cells (Huang
et al., 2015). In our study, immunohistochemistry showed
that DHA inhibited ICAM-1 expression in the lesion area,
which is consistent with other studies showing that DHA
inhibited the production of proinﬂammatory cytokines
including the IL-12 cytokine family (including IL-12, IL-23
and IL-27) (Kong et al., 2010), IL-1b, COX2 (LalancetteHebert et al., 2011), TNF-a and CRP (Ellulu et al.,
2015). Since the activation of the inﬂammation reaction
is the major cause of HT (Rodriguez-Yanez and Castillo,
2008; Lakhan et al., 2009), we speculate that DHA inhibited HT transformation by inhibiting neuroinﬂammation.
This hypothesis is further proved by the result that DHA
inhibited BBB leakage which promoted neuroinﬂammation. Nevertheless, one limitation in our current study is
that pro- and anti-inﬂammatory cytokines and other
inﬂammatory cells were not investigated, future studies
are required to further clarify the underlying inﬂammatory
mechanisms.
In clinical practice, alteplase has been recommended
to be used in early stroke onset due to its proved
reperfusion eﬃcacy. However, HT and reperfusion injury
are its two major complications especially when used
too late, which partly limits its clinical application (del
Zoppo et al., 1992; Hacke et al., 2008). A combined application of neuroprotective agents and alteplase might provide a way to minimize the pathologic injury. Recently, the
combination of tPA and APT102, a type of human
apyrase/ADPase, was proved to decrease HT and
improve stroke outcome (Tan et al., 2014). For DHA, animal studies have proved its neuroprotective eﬀects in
extensive applications, including chronic dietary administration, pre-ischemic and post-ischemic injection, even up
to 5 h after ischemia onset (Belayev et al., 2011).
Therefore, our ﬁndings showing that DHA treatment
attenuated HT and decreased infarct volume may provide
valuable new insights into the combination of DHA treatment with alteplase to minimize the occurrence of HT
and improve stroke outcome. However, the administration
of neuroprotective agents should never deprive patients
of timely recanalization therapy.
There are some limitations in this study. Although
Evans Blue is the classic method used to address BBB

integrity, it might be more appropriate to analyze BBB
integrity in stroke-aﬀected areas because ischemic
stroke naturally aﬀects distinct brain regions. Further
studies are needed, especially with co-administration of
DHA and r-tPA mimetic situation in clinical practice.

CONCLUSION
Post-ischemic
DHA
treatment
is
a
potential
neuroprotective intervention, which eﬀectively decreases
infarction
and
attenuates
HT
enhanced
by
hyperglycemia, probably due to the increased integrity
of BBB and inhibited expression of ICAM-1. A combined
treatment of thrombolysis with DHA may be a promising
alternative to increase the safety and eﬀectiveness of
reperfusion therapy in future.
