Although the role of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and aquaporin-1 (AQP1) channels in ischemia-induced brain
edema has been previously reported, nitric oxide (NO) modulation of these channels has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the NO modulation of AQPs gene expression after brain
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in rats. The experiment was performed in three groups of rats: sham, control
ischemic and l-NAME pretreated (1 mg/kg). Brain ischemia was induced by 60 min middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) under continuous recording of regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) followed by 12 h
reperfusion. Brain edema was assessed by dry/wet method, and Quantitative RT-PCR was used for assessment of mRNA levels of AQPs. There was 80% reduction in rCBF during MCAO. Brain cerebral ischemia
elevated the brain water content from 78.66 ± 0.17% to 81.93 ± 0.60%, and inhibition of NO production
by l-NAME signiﬁcantly reduced this elevation (79.74 ± 0.79%). The mRNA expression of AQP1 increased,
but AQP4 decreased in response to I/R. l-NAME pretreatment signiﬁcantly decreased AQP1 mRNA and
prevented the reduction of AQP4 mRNA. The ﬁndings of this study indicated that brain I/R injury provokes
brain edema by alterations of AQPs expression, and the NO is the main signaling factor that modulates
gene expression of these channels.

Introduction
Brain edema is noted in several brain pathologies, such as traumatic brain injury, brain tumors and ischemic stroke [1–3]. It is
an excessive accumulation of water in the brain parenchyma and
the commonest byproduct of brain ischemia, which exacerbates
the side effects of ischemic stroke [2,4]. There are two types of
brain edema (cytotoxic and vasogenic edema) that take place during brain ischemia. Cytotoxic edema is the movement of water
from interstitial space into the intracellular compartment, which
occurred at the early phase of hypoxia or ischemia [4,5]. Vasogenic edema is the excess accumulation of water into the interstitial
space because of blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption and plasma
proteins accumulation in the brain parenchyma [6], which take
place in the late phase of hypoxia or ischemia [7,8]. Although the
intensity of brain edema has been widely studied in various models of cerebral ischemia, the information regarding its molecular
mechanism is limited.

Previous studies have demonstrated that aquaporins (AQPs)
have participated in the pathogenesis of cerebral edema after
ischemic stroke [2,9]. The AQPs are the selective water-channel
proteins that mediate water movements through phospholipids
bilayer of cell membrane [10]. These channels mediate water movement between different parts of brain, such as the intracellular,
interstitial, vascular, and ventricular compartments, which are
under the strict control of osmotic and hydrostatic pressure gradients [2,10,11]. In the normal brain, AQP4 protein is located mainly
in the foot processes of astrocytes [11]. The distribution of this
protein at the borders between the brain parenchyma and major
ﬂuid compartment, such as cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) or blood, suggests that AQP4-regulated water ﬂuxes into or out of the brain
parenchyma [2,10]. Experiments using AQP4-null mice demonstrated a protective role for AQP4 water channel against cytotoxic
edema after brain ischemia, while AQP4 deletion aggravated vasogenic brain edema [12]. AQP1 is the main water channel of the
epithelial cells of the choroid plexus, but is also expressed in the
endothelial cells of BBB at low level [13]. The low level of AQP1
expression in BBB endothelial cells seems to be preserved by the
astrocytes [14]. Under hypoxic conditions, the levels of AQP1 gene
expression signiﬁcantly increased in cultured endothelial cells of
retinal microvessels, so that recent studies suggested a reverse

relation between the barrier property of BBB and AQP1 expression [15]. Although the function of AQPs channels in the edema
formation has been widely studied in various models of cerebral
ischemia, information regarding the nitric oxide (NO) modulation
of these channels after ischemia is limited.
We have previously demonstrated that the increased
endogenous level of NO intensiﬁed the deleterious actions of
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in a normal and acute hypertensive animal model [7,16]. Since the AQPs channels are the main
routes of brain swelling that participate in brain edema formation
after ischemic stroke, the aim of this study was to evaluate the
role of NO modulation of these channels after animal model of I/R
injury.

Materials and methods

Experimental protocol and groups
Sham (n = 15), the rats underwent surgery at the neck region and
received a single i.p. injection of the vehicle (1 mL/kg normal saline)
without being exposed to MCAO. Control ischemia/reperfusion:
I/R (n = 15) surgery was performed in the neck region same as in
the sham group. Rats received a single i.p. injection of the vehicle
(1 mL/kg normal saline) at 20 min before MCAO. After 10 min rest,
brain ischemia was achieved by 60 min MCAO followed by 12 h
reperfusion. Ischemic treatment: I/R + l-NAME (n = 15), the rats of
this group received a single i.p. injection of 1 mg/kg l-NAME (in
1 mL normal saline, Fluka Chemicals) 20 min before induction of
MCAO. Other procedures followed the same scheme.
The number of animals presented for each group is the number
of rats that survived during 12 h reperfusion period. The collected
data of the animals that died during 12 h reperfusion period were
excluded.

Animals
Neurological assessment
Male normal Sprague Dawley rats (280–320 g) were obtained
from central animal house facility of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. All protocols of the study were approved by the
institutional animal ethics committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, which follows the NIH Guidelines for care and use
of animals (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised in 1996). Animals
were housed in standard cages in a room with controlled temperature (22–24 ◦ C), humidity (40–60%) and light period (07:00–19:00),
while having access to rat chow and water ad libitum.

Induction of transient focal cerebral ischemia
Animals had been fasted overnight prior to use without deprivation of water. Anesthesia was conducted with intraperitoneal (i.p.)
injection of 400 mg/kg chloral hydrate. The animals were breathing room air mixed with 3–5% extra oxygen during surgery and the
experimental period. Core temperature was continuously recorded
by a rectal probe connected to a thermistor and maintained at
37 ± 1 ◦ C with a heating pad and lamp.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) of the right cerebral hemisphere was carried out by an intraluminal ﬁlament
method described by Longa et al. [17]. Brieﬂy, the right common carotid artery was exposed through a midline neck incision,
and then, via external carotid artery, a 4-cm poly-l-lysine-coated
nylon thread (3-0) was inserted into the internal carotid artery
and gently advanced up until feeling a resistance and seeing a
sharp decline in the blood ﬂow trace. MCAO was maintained for
60 min, and then the thread was gently taken out to re-establish
blood ﬂow to the ischemic region. Finally, all the incisions were
sutured, the animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia, and
returned to a warm cage for recuperation during the reperfusion
period.
Regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) for the area of the right
hemisphere that was nourished by the right middle cerebral artery
(MCA) was recorded using a laser Doppler ﬂowmeter (AD Instrument, model: ML191, Australia) [18]. Brieﬂy, the right temporalis
muscle was dissected at the middle distance between the eye and
the ear. After debridement of soft tissues, the probe of laser Doppler
was placed on the temporal bone within the area of the ischemic
core, about 1–2 mm from the origin of the MCA. After placement
of the probe, continuous recording was performed 15 min before
occluding MCA until 15 min following the start of reperfusion.
There was a 75–85% reduction in rCBF in both control ischemia and
l-NAME (N␻-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester) ischemia during MCA
occlusion. This reduction returned swiftly back to its pre-occluded
level during the ﬁrst 15 min of the reperfusion period [7].

Neurologic functions were quantiﬁed at 12 h of reperfusion (just
prior to sacriﬁce) in rats that survived the ischemic trauma and at
equivalent time periods in the sham group. A ﬁve-point grading
scale of neurological deﬁcit scores (NDS) was used [19], in which
rats with normal motor function or no observable neurological
deﬁcits were assigned as grade 1. Grade 2 was given to rats that
showed ﬂexion of contralateral torso or forelimb upon lifting by
their tail, or failure to extend their forepaw when suspended vertically, forelimb ﬂexion and shoulder adduction. Grade 3 was for
circling to the contralateral side of the MCA-occluded hemisphere
when the animal is held by the tail on a ﬂat surface, but with normal
posture at rest. Grade 4 was assigned to loss of righting reﬂex and
decreased resistance to lateral push, and ﬁnally, grade 5 was for no
spontaneous motor activity.
Evaluation of cerebral lesions
Cerebral infarction volume was measured according to the
method of Swanson et al. [20]. Brieﬂy, after induction of deep anesthesia with sodium thiopental, the animals were slaughtered. Then,
their brain was removed, cleaned, and solidiﬁed by immersing
in pre-cooled normal saline (4 ◦ C) and keeping in the refrigerator for 5 min. The prepared slices were stained with 2% 2, 3,
5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma) and ﬁxed in 10%
buffered formalin solution. After staining, the color of the ischemic
areas was red, and that of the non-ischemic areas was white. The
slice images were digitized by using a Cannon camera. Images of the
stained sections were taken. Grossly visible infarction zones were
quantiﬁed using image analysis software (NIH Image Analyzer),
and ﬁnally cerebral infarction volume was calculated as described
previously [20].
Measurements of brain water content of ischemic hemisphere
The wet/dry technique was used to directly measure the
absolute brain water content (ABWC) of ipsilateral ischemic hemispheres [21]. Using this method, the rats were killed under deep
anesthesia and quickly decapitated. Then, their removed brain
was placed in the brain matrix to separate the cerebellum and
olfactory bulb. Thereafter, through a midline sagittal incision, the
brain was divided into right and left hemispheres in the sham
group or lesioned (right) and non-lesioned (left) hemispheres in
the ischemic groups. Right hemisphere was placed in separate preweighed container to measure its wet weight (WW). Then, the
containers and their tissues were placed in an oven at 110 ◦ C for 24 h
to evaporate their water, in order to obtain their dry tissue weight

Evaluation of gene expression for AQP1 and 4
The gene expressions of AQP1 and 4 isoforms were assessed by
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The
determined area of the cerebral cortex and striatum was removed
after deep anesthesia. The total RNA was extracted from 25 mg of
brain tissue using the RNA extraction kit (Invitek, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quantity and quality of the
extracted RNA samples were estimated by spectrophotometry at
260 and 280 nm. RNA was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen–Gibco,
Paisley, UK) before cDNA synthesis to avoid DNA contamination.
Complementary DNA was synthesized from 5 ␮g of total RNA using
the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentase, Vilnius,
Lithuania).
qRT-PCR: The abundance of AQP1 and 4 gene transcripts were
assessed by qRT-PCR using Bio-Rad Chromo 4 Real-time PCR Detector system (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) with SYBER Green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) in triplicate. Expression of a ␤-actin
housekeeping gene was used as a reference for the level of target
gene expression. Table 1 shows the sequences of primer pairs for
each gene. PCR reactions were performed in a ﬁnal volume of 25 ␮L
and contained 0.5 ␮g of the cDNA product, 4.0 pmol of each primer,
and 1X reaction mix consisting of Fast Start DNA polymerase reaction buffer, dNTPs, and SYBR green I (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA).
Thermal cycling for all genes was initiated with a denaturation step
at 95 ◦ C for 10 min, followed by 30 cycles (denaturation at 95 ◦ C for
15 s, annealing at 60 ◦ C for 30 s, and elongation at 60 ◦ C for 34 s,
when ﬂuorescence appeared). The qRT-PCR ampliﬁcation products
were assessed by melting curve analysis and by electrophoresis on
1% agarose gel (data not shown). The expressions of target genes
were measured and were normalized to ␤-actin, as an internal control. Gene expression was calculated using a 2−ct method as
previously described [22].

to its pre-occluded level during the ﬁrst 15-min of reperfusion
period. The rCBF traces of I/R and I/R treated groups indicated that
the pre-treatments of ischemic rats with l-NAME did not statically
alter the blood ﬂow of the ischemic regions during ischemia or the
ﬁrst 15-min reperfusion period.
Neurological outcome
Fig. 2 represents the neurological disabilities in ischemic rats
exposed to 60 min MCA occlusion after 12 h reperfusion. Data of
this ﬁgure are indicating that there were severe motor disabilities
in control ischemia (NDS = 3.66 ± 0.33). Pretreatment with l-NAME
before induction of ischemia (I/R + l-NAME) signiﬁcantly improved
neurological disabilities (NDS = 1.71 ± 0.35) such that it became
insigniﬁcant from sham.
Cerebral infarction
Qualitative assessment of infarction is carried out by the preparation of brain coronal sections stained with TTC (Fig. 3A). The
uniform dark red color of the slices of right and left hemispheres of
the sham group indicated that anesthesia and neck surgery did not
provoke brain injury. The appearance of white color intermingled

with dark red color areas in the right hemispheres of I/R and I/Rtreated rats indicated that 60 min right MCA occlusion has induced
different magnitudes of cerebral infarctions without affecting the
left hemispheres. Qualitative comparisons of the white color areas
of lesioned hemisphere of ischemic rats are indicating that l-NAME
has attenuated the infarct size. Quantities of the ischemic areas of
lesioned hemisphere conﬁrmed that l-NAME signiﬁcantly attenuated the brain infarction after I/R injuries (Fig. 3B).

Brain water content
The ABWC of right hemisphere of the sham operated group was
78.64 ± 0.20%. I/R induction elevated the ABWC of right ischemic
hemispheres of I/R and I/R treated rats to the 81.96 ± 0.58% and
79.46 ± 0.70%, respectively. However, the comparisons of ABWC
data of ischemic hemispheres of I/R treated rats with I/R group
indicated that l-NAME reduced this elevation (Fig. 4).

AQP1 mRNA expression
The AQP1 mRNA was feebly expressed in the cortex (A) and striatum (B) of the right hemispheres of sham operated rats (Fig. 5).
MCA occlusion caused a similar enhancement of AQP1 mRNA
expression in the cortex and striatum of ischemic hemisphere
(I/R group). However, following l-NAME treatment before I/R, the
expression of AQP1 mRNA was signiﬁcantly decreased in the cortex
and striatum of lesioned hemisphere of ischemically treated rats.
These results indicated that administration of l-NAME reduced the
transcription of this protein in ischemic region following the I/R
injuries.
AQP4 mRNA expression
The expression of AQP4 mRNA was separately assessed in the
cortex (A) and striatum (B) of ischemic right hemisphere in three
groups of our experiment (Fig. 6). MCA occlusion caused a similar
reduction in AQP4 mRNA expression in the cortex and striatum of
ischemic hemisphere (I/R group). NO inhibition, by administration
of l-NAME (I/R + l-NAME group), only prevented reduction of AQP4
mRNA expression in the striatum of lesioned hemisphere.
Discussion
Brain edema is one of the consequences of ischemic stroke that
causes a rise in intracranial pressure and neuronal cell death [23].
The role of AQPs channels in ischemic stroke-induced brain edema
has been previously reported [2,5], while NO modulation of brain
AQPs to ameliorate brain edema has not been investigated in detail.
Here, using a transient rat MCA occlusion, we demonstrated a relationship between increased brain edema and mRNA levels of brain
AQPs channels. Also, we found a relation between mRNA levels of
AQPs channels and NO production using inhibition of NOS activity during I/R injuries. Our data possibly supports this concept that
brain edema after ischemic stroke is mediated through the AQPs
channels, and NO is part of the molecular signaling cascade regulating the gene expression of AQPs channels after I/R injuries.
In the ﬁeld of brain ischemia/reperfusion injury, NO production by endothelial NOS (eNOS) has only neuroprotective functions
through vasodilatation of ischemic regions, while it intensiﬁes
BBB damage and edema formation through peroxynitrite production [7,26]. NO inhibition by low dosage of l-NAME (1 mg/kg)

has neuroprotective effects because l-NAME in this dosage did
not affect systemic blood pressure (Table 2) and the cerebral
blood ﬂow of ischemic regions (Fig. 1). NO inhibition in high
dosage administration of l-NAME does not lead to neuroprotection because of decreased blood ﬂow in the ischemic region caused

by vasoconstriction effects. The compression of the rCBF graph of
control ischemic and l-NAME-treated groups indicated that pretreatment of ischemic rats with l-NAME (1 mg/kg) did not alter
the blood ﬂow of the ischemic regions during ischemia or the ﬁrst
15-min reperfusion period (Fig. 1). Therefore, our results indicate

that low dosage of l-NAME (1 mg/kg) has neuroprotection effects
without any alterations in ischemic rCBF or systemic blood pressure.
The position of NO in the development of brain infarction
and edema formation following ischemia has been widely studied [24–26]. The results of our study showed that reduction of NO
production before ischemia by l-NAME, non-speciﬁc NO synthase
(NOS) inhibitor, decreased infarct size (Fig. 3). These results are
supported by some previous studies in which NO might have participated in neuronal damage by a deleterious role during brain I/R
injuries [27–29]. Inside brain infarction, the role of NO in microvascular damage taking place after brain ischemia is another talk
demonstrating a different mechanism [30,31]. Our study showed
NO inhibition before ischemia decreased brain edema (Fig. 4). These
results are in accordance with previous ﬁndings that nonselective
NOS inhibitors attenuated BBB permeability and brain edema formation [7,26,32]. These protective effects of NOS inhibition suggest
that NO has a deleterious action in brain microvascular damage and
brain edema after brain I/R injuries.
In this study, we showed that AQP1 gene expression is upregulated in the brain tissue after ischemia insult (Fig. 5). Our results
are in agreement with some previous ﬁndings that the levels of
AQP1 mRNA and protein expression are signiﬁcantly increased in
cultured retinal microvessel endothelial cells under hypoxic condition [14,33]. AQP1 is a water channel of endothelial cells of brain
microvessels but is expressed in the low level [10,11]. The low level
of AQP1 expression in the endothelial cells of brain microvessels
seems to be preserved by the existence of astrocytes because the
expression of AQP1 in the endothelial cells of peripheral microvessels is higher than endothelial cells of brain microvessels [14,33].
However, an induction of AQP1 mRNA was found in pathological brain endothelium when BBB permeability was increased [34].
Based on previous studies, there is a negative correlation between
barrier property and AQP1 expression [14]. These studies suggested
this concept that AQP1 expression in the brain endothelial cells is
associated with compromised barrier properties of brain microvessels. Several factors, including oxygen radicals, as well as vasoactive
factors, such as NO and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
play important roles in the regulation of brain microvascular structure and edema formation [35,36]. Based on our previous study, it
can be noted that the increased NO production occurring after brain
ischemia intensiﬁes edema formation [7]. Therefore, the robust evidence demonstrate that NO participate in ischemia-induced brain
edema, but there are little understood data on the NO regulation of AQP1 channel gene expression after brain ischemia. In the
present study, we tried to answer this question: is there any relation between NO enhancement and AQP1 mRNA expression after
ischemia? We showed that inhibition of NO production using NOS
inhibitor (l-NAME) during brain ischemia decreased brain edema

and mRNA expression of AQP1 water channels (Figs. 3 and 4).
A previous study has demonstrated that NOS mRNA and protein enhanced after I/R injuries, leading to BBB disruption and
brain edema [30]. Therefore, based on our results and previous
studies, NO is one of the important signaling molecules of AQP1
mRNA expression in cerebral microvessels and edema formation
after brain ischemia. In particular, recently performed studies have
reported that AQPs channels facilitated NO diffusion across cell
membranes faster than free diffusion. Therefore, this faster transport leads to more NO accumulation in the endothelial cells of BBB
and induces further brain damage [37]. This ﬁnding is conﬁrmed
by the results of our study that NOS inhibition after brain ischemia
decreased AQP1 mRNA expression with edema formation.
In the present study, we also indicated that AQP4 gene expression is down-regulated in the brain tissue after I/R injury (Fig. 6).
AQP4 protein is the main water-channel of brain cells that
is expressed predominantly in astrocyte foot processes at the
borders between the brain parenchyma and major ﬂuid compartments [2,38]. Based on the previous studies, AQP4 deletion
aggravated vasogenic brain edema, and AQP4-null mice had more
brain swelling as compared with wild-type mice after cortical
freeze injury [12]. Also, another study has demonstrated that
AQP4-mediated transcellular water movement is crucial for ﬂuid
clearance in vasogenic brain edema, and AQP4 activation or upregulation is an excellent therapeutic option in vasogenic brain
edema [39]. In our study, NOS inhibition by l-NAME avoided
the decrease in the expression of AQP4 mRNA at least in striatum and then decreased edema formation after brain ischemia
(Figs. 4 and 6), while NO inhibition could not prevent AQP4 mRNA
reduction. Possibly, it reduced striatal infarction more remarkably
than cortex (Fig. 3). NO is possibly one of the signaling molecules
that modulated AQP4 mRNA expression during brain edema formation after I/R injury.
In summary, the results of our investigation demonstrated that
brain I/R injury provoked brain edema, and NO is one of the most
important regulators of AQP1 and 4 genes expression after I/R
injury. Since the alterations of AQP1 and AQP4 gene expression
occurred during I/R injury, this alteration possibly interfered the
brain edema following brain ischemia. These results also reconﬁrmed the deleterious actions of NO production on the brain edema
after ischemic stroke, and NO inhibition can protect ischemic brain
from further damage.
