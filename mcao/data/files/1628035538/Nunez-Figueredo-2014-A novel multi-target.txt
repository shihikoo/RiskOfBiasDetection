We previously showed that JM-20, a novel 1,5-benzodiazepine fused to a dihydropyridine moiety,
possessed an anxiolytic proﬁle similar to diazepam and strong neuroprotective activity in different cell
models relevant to cerebral ischemia. Here, we investigated whether JM-20 protects against ischemic
neuronal damage in vitro and in vivo. The effects of JM-20 were evaluated on hippocampal slices subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). For in vivo studies, Wistar rats were subjected 90 min of
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and oral administration of JM-20 at 2, 4 and 8 mg/kg 1 h
following reperfusion. Twenty-four hours after cerebral blood ﬂow restoration, neurological deﬁcits were
scored, and the infarct volume, histopathological changes in cortex, number of hippocampal and striatal
neurons, and glutamate/aspartate concentrations in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid were measured. Susceptibility to brain mitochondrial swelling, membrane potential dissipation, H2O2 generation, cytochrome c
release, Ca2þ accumulation, and morphological changes in the organelles were assessed 24 h postischemia. In vitro, JM-20 (1 and 10 mM) administered during reperfusion signiﬁcantly reduced cell
death in hippocampal slices subjected to OGD. In vivo, JM-20 treatment (4 and 8 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly
decreased neurological deﬁcit scores, edema formation, total infarct volumes and histological alterations
in different brain regions. JM-20 treatment also protected brain mitochondria from ischemic damage,
most likely by preventing Ca2þ accumulation in organelles. Moreover, an 8-mg/kg JM-20 dose reduced
glutamate and aspartate concentrations in cerebrospinal ﬂuid and the deleterious effects of MCAo even
when delivered 8 h after blood ﬂow restoration. These results suggest that in rats, JM-20 is a robust
neuroprotective agent against ischemia/reperfusion injury with a wide therapeutic window. Our ﬁndings
support the further examination of potential clinical JM-20 use to treat acute ischemic stroke.

1. Introduction
Cerebrovascular disease is the leading cause of disability and the
third leading cause of death in industrialized countries. The frequency of worldwide cerebrovascular diseases is increasing, and
approximately 5.7 million deaths per year are the result of acute
ischemia (Howells and Donnan, 2010). Recurrent stroke risk after
cerebrovascular diseases ranges from 5 to 20% per year (Balucani
et al., 2010). At present, the European Medicines Agency and the
US Food and Drug Administration have only approved intravenous
recombinant tissue plasminogen activator for acute ischemic stroke
during the 3-h time window after symptom onset. In daily clinical
practice, it is only used in approximately 5% of patients because of
various contraindications (Xing et al., 2012; Broussalis et al., 2012).
The principal strategy for the development and evaluation of
neuroprotective drugs has been to search for a molecule that impedes a feature of the ischemic cascade, such as calcium- and
glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, free radical-mediated injury,
mitochondrial damage or inﬂammatory mechanisms (Fisher, 2011).
Unfortunately, the evidence of neuroprotection obtained in preclinical models has not been successfully translated into clinical
trials, possibly because a highly selective ligand for a given target
does not always result in a clinically efﬁcacious drug.
Due to the multiplicity of mechanisms involved in causing
neuronal damage during ischemia, an emerging paradigm in the
development of novel therapeutics advocates the deliberate search
for agents acting as multiple ligands or multifunctional drugs. Such
drugs may target an array of pathological pathways, each of which
is believed to contribute to the cascades that ultimately lead to
neuronal cell death, and could be superior in therapeutic effect,
possibly reducing unwanted effects in contrast to conventional
therapy with monospeciﬁc drugs or polypharmaceutic combinations of different agents (Van der Schyf, 2011; Youdim, 2013;
Geldenhuys et al., 2011; Cavalli et al., 2008).
In this context, and based on a multimodal drug design paradigm, our group has developed a new family of 1,5 benzodiazepines, structurally different from currently available 1,5benzodiazepines by the presence of a 1,4 dihydropyridine moiety
fused to the benzodiazepine ring. JM-20 (3-ethoxycarbonyl-2methyl-4-(2-nitrophenyl)-4,11-dihydro-1H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,5]
benzodiazepine) is one of the member of this family of compounds
currently under research by our group. This molecule could have
high probability to succeed in the treatment of neurodegenerative
diseases since it could target at the same time both calcium (due to
dihydropyridine moiety) and g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (benzodiazepine system), well-known mediators of
neuronal cell death in ischemia (Ginsberg, 2008).
Previously, we showed that JM-20 has a similar anxiolytic proﬁle of diazepam and that its dihydropyridine ring did not seem to
interfere with the molecule's GABA-ergic activity (Figueredo et al.,
2013). This effect was observed with an apparent lack of toxicity,
since the exposure of mice to a single oral dose of 2000 mg/kg only
involved the sedation and somnolence in two animals (Figueredo
et al., 2013). We also previously demonstrated that JM-20
possessed cytoprotective activity in different cerebral ischemia
in vitro models at very low micromolar concentrations, which most
likely resulted from the protection of mitochondria from Ca2þinduced impairment and the preservation of cell energy balance
~ ez-Figueredo et al., 2014). This molecule reached its maximal
(Nun
protective effect at 0.1 mM, a concentration that was approximately
100 times lower than the concentrations of its structural precursors
(diazepam and nifedipine), that were required to see a similar effect
~ ez-Figueredo et al., 2014).
(Nun
In this context, we evaluated the neuroprotective effects of JM20 using in vitro and in vivo experimental ischemia models. Rat

organotypic hippocampal cultures were exposed to oxygen and
glucose deprivation (OGD) and rats subjected to middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAo) injury were chosen as experimental
ischemia models. Here, we provide evidence for the in vitro and
in vivo neuroprotective properties of JM-20. When evaluating its
neuroprotective properties in ischemic rats, we demonstrated that
JM-20 protected brain mitochondria from MCAo-induced damage
and reduced the cerebrospinal ﬂuid levels of glutamate and
aspartate.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Synthesis and chemical characterization of JM-20
JM-20 was synthesized, puriﬁed and characterized as previously reported
(Figueredo et al., 2013).
2.2. Chemicals
Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium (DMEM), minimum essential medium
(MEM), Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), horse serum, Fungizone®, penicillin/
streptomycin and 0.25% trypsin/EDTA solution were obtained from Gibco (Gibco
BRL, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Fetal bovine serum was obtained from Cultilab (Cultilab,
Campinas, SP, Brazil). Gentamicin was obtained from Schering do Brazil (Rio de
Janeiro, RJ, Brazil). Propidium iodide (PI) and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, USA). All other chemicals and solvents
used were of analytical or pharmaceutical grade.
2.3. Animals
Male Wistar rats (275e300 g) were obtained from CENPALAB (Havana, Cuba)
and for acclimation, housed in the animal care facility for 1 week prior to in vivo
experiments. Rats were housed in a temperature-controlled environment
(22e24  C) with a 12-h light/dark cycle and had access to food and water ad libitum.
Six to eight day old male Wistar rats were obtained from rat colonies at the
Departamento de Bioquímica, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto
Alegre, RS, Brazil and were used for in vitro experiments. Animal housing and care
and all experimental procedures were in accordance with institutional guidelines
under approved animal protocols (Animal Care Committee of UFRGS, Porto Alegre,
Brazil and CIDEM, Havana, Cuba).
2.4. Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures
Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were prepared as previously reported
by Stoppini et al. (1991) with some modiﬁcations (Bernardi et al., 2008). Brieﬂy,
400 mm thick hippocampal slices were prepared from 6 to 8-day-old male Wistar
rats (n ¼ 9) using a McIlwain tissue chopper and transferred to an ice-cold HBSS. Six
hippocampal slices were placed on each Millicell culture insert in 6-well culture
plates together with 1 ml of culture medium per well. Culture medium (pH 7.3)
consisted of 50% MEM, 25% horse serum and 25% HBSS supplemented with 36 mM
glucose, 25 mM HEPES, 4 mM NaHCO3, 1% Fungizone and 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin.
Cultures were incubated at 37  C in a 5% CO2/95% O2 atmosphere for 14 days in vitro
prior to use. The medium was changed every 3 days.
2.4.1. OGD and JM-20 treatment
The induction of OGD was based on the method previously described by Strasser
and Fischer (1995), with some modiﬁcations (Bernardi et al., 2008). After 14 days
in vitro, the culture inserts were transferred to a sterilized 6-well plate and incubated with 1 ml of OGD medium (1.26 mM CaCl2, 5.36 mM KCl, 136.9 mM NaCl,
0.34 mM H2PO4, 0.49 mM MgCl2, 0.44 mM MgSO4, and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) for
15 min to deplete glucose from intracellular stores and the extracellular space. Next,
the medium was exchanged for OGD medium previously bubbled with N2/CO2 (95%/
5%) for 10 min. The slice cultures were then transferred to an anaerobic chamber at
37  C with an N2-enriched atmosphere for 60 min. During OGD, control slices were
maintained in an incubator with a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37  C. After the OGD period,
the slice cultures were carefully washed twice with HBSS and then incubated for
24 h in culture medium in the presence or absence of JM-20 (0.1, 1 and 10 mM) at
37  C and 5% CO2/95% O2 atmosphere, which corresponded to the recovery period.
Respective controls were performed without exposure to OGD. For this assay, JM-20
was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and added to the culture medium at 1/
1000 (v/v) dilutions.
2.4.2. Assessment of OGD-induced cell death
Cell damage was assessed after 24 h (the recovery period) by ﬂuorescent image
analysis of PI uptake (Noraberg et al., 1993), which indicated signiﬁcant membrane
injury (Macklis and Madison, 1990). PI is excluded from healthy cells, but following
the loss of cell membrane integrity, it enters into the cells, binds to DNA and becomes highly ﬂuorescent. Two hours before the end of the recovery period, PI (5 mM)
was added to the culture medium. Cultures were observed with an inverted

~ ez-Figueredo et al. / Neuropharmacology 85 (2014) 517e527
Y. Nun
microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE 300) using a standard rhodamine ﬁlter set. Images
were captured and analyzed using the Scion Image software (http://www.scioncorp.
com). The area where PI ﬂuorescence was detected above background levels was
determined using the “density slice” option of the Scion Image software and
compared to the total slice area to obtain the percentage of damage.
2.5. MCAo-induced focal cerebral ischemia
MCAo and reperfusion were performed as previously described, using an
intraluminal ﬁlament model (Longa et al., 1989). Brieﬂy, anesthesia was induced
with Ketamine (75 mg/kg) and Xylazine (8 mg/kg). The right carotid region was
exposed, and the external and common carotid arteries were ligated with a 3-0 silk
suture. A 25 mm length 4-0 nylon monoﬁlament (Somerville, Brazil), whose tip had
been rounded and coated with poly-L-lysine (Zhao et al., 2008; Lourbopoulos et al.,
2008), was introduced (18e20 mm) through the internal carotid artery, thereby
occluding the middle cerebral artery origin. After 90 min of MCAo, reperfusion was
permitted by gentle withdrawal of the suture (under the same anesthetic conditions
as surgery). During MCAo procedures, the body temperature was maintained within
the normal range (from 36.5  C to 37.5  C) with a heating pad. One hour after
reperfusion, rats received a single oral dose of JM-20 (2, 4 or 8 mg/kg) or vehicle.
Control (sham) rats received all surgical procedures except the suture insertion and
were administered with vehicle or JM-20 (8 mg/kg). Twenty four hours after
reperfusion, neurological deﬁcits were evaluated, and animals were euthanized for
TTC staining (to measure the infarct size), histological, mitochondrial or biochemical
analyses. The maximal effective dose of JM-20 (8 mg/kg) was also studied when
administration was delayed for 1e23 h after reperfusion (n ¼ 8 animals per group).
Vehicle-treated animals (administered 1 h after reperfusion), which received transient MCAo, were also included (n ¼ 8 animals per group). The infarct volume and
neurological deﬁcits were measured at 24 h post-ischemia.
2.5.1. Experimental groups
Animals were randomly divided into 5 experimental groups (n ¼ 8 animals per
group): (1) control ischemic-reperfusion (I/R) group with vehicle treatment, (2) I/R
with JM-20 treatment (2 mg/kg), (3) I/R with JM-20 treatment (4 mg/kg), (4) I/R with
JM-20 treatment (8 mg/kg), and (5) sham-operated group. All parameters were
measured after the 24-h recovery period. Vehicle and JM-20 were administered by
oral gastric gavage 1 h after reperfusion, and the variability in the dosing volumes
was mitigated by adjusting the concentration to ensure a constant volume (10 ml/
kg). Immediately before use, JM-20 was suspended in a 0.05% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) solution (vehicle) and administered as a single dose (2, 4 or 8 mg/
kg). The dose range was selected based on previous experience with this compound
(Figueredo et al., 2013). Behavioral evaluations and cerebral infarct volume measurements were obtained from the same animals.
2.5.2. Measurement of infarct size
At 24 h post-reperfusion, brains (n ¼ 8 for each group) were removed, sliced into
2-mm thick coronal slices and incubated in a 2% TTC solution at 37  C for 30 min.
After ﬁxation in a 4% phosphate-buffered formalin solution, each stained section was
digitally scanned, and the brain areas were measured with ImageJ 1.41 (National
Institutes of Health, USA) (Bederson et al., 1986a,b). Infarct volume (mm3) was
determined using the following formula: infarct volume ¼ 2 mm (thickness of the
section)  [sum of the infarction area in all brain section (mm2)]. To minimize artifacts from postischemic edema in the infarct area, an edema index was calculated
by dividing the total volume of the hemisphere ipsilateral to MCAo by the total
volume of the contralateral hemisphere. The actual infarct volume adjusted for
edema was calculated by dividing the infarct volume by the edema index (Belayev
et al., 2008; Candelario-Jalil et al., 2005). Ischemic volumes were expressed as a
percentage of the contralateral side.
2.5.3. Neurological deﬁcit scoring
Behavioral tests were performed 24 h after MCAo just prior to euthanasia.
Neurological deﬁcits were assessed according to a six-point scale: 0 ¼ no observable
neurological deﬁcit; 1 ¼ failure to extend left forepaw fully; 2 ¼ circling to the left if
pulled by tail; 3 ¼ spontaneously circling to the left; 4 ¼ no spontaneous activity
with a depressed level of consciousness; and 5 ¼ death (Zhao et al., 2008; Yuzawa
et al., 2008; Schmid-Elsaesser et al., 1998).
2.5.4. Excitatory amino acid (EAA) quantiﬁcation
2.5.4.1. Cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) sampling. After 90 min of MCAo and 24 h of
reperfusion, rats (n ¼ 6 for each group) were anesthetized, placed in a stereotaxic
apparatus, and CSF samples (40e60 mL per rat) were obtained through a direct
puncture of the cisterna magna with an insulin syringe (27 gauge  1/2 in length)
(Portela et al., 2002). To obtain cell-free supernatants, all samples were centrifuged
at 10,000  g in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 5 min and stored (70  C) until use for
quantiﬁcation of glutamate and aspartate levels by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
2.5.4.2. HPLC. HPLC was used to quantify the glutamate and aspartate levels in CSF
cell-free supernatant aliquots (Joseph and Marsden, 1986). Brieﬂy, samples were

519

derivatized with o-phthaldehyde and separated on a reverse phase column
(Supelcosil LC-18, 250 mm  4.6 mm, Supelco) using a Shimadzu Instruments liquid
chromatograph (50 mL loop valve injection). The mobile phase ﬂowed at a rate of
1.4 mL/min, and the column temperature was 24  C. Buffer compositions were as
follows: A, 0.04 M NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 5.5, 20% methanol; and B, 0.01 mol/L NaH2PO4
H2O buffer, pH 5.5, 80% methanol. The gradient proﬁle was modiﬁed according to the
content of buffer B in the mobile phase; 0% at 0.00 min, 25% at 13.75 min, 100% at
15.00e20.00 min, and 0% at 20.01e25.00 min. The absorbance values were obtained
at 360 nm and 455 nm for excitation and emission, respectively, in a Shimadzu
ﬂuorescence detector. Samples of 50 mL were used, and the concentration was
expressed in mM (Schmidt et al., 2009).
2.5.5. Histopathology
Animals (n ¼ 8 for each group) were anesthetized and transcardially perfused
with ice-cold 0.9% saline for 10 min and then for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde
in 0.1 mmol/L phosphate buffer. Animals were decapitated, and the brains were
allowed to post-ﬁx overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were embedded in
parafﬁn, sliced in 5 mm thick coronal sections of different cerebral regions and
processed for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) (hippocampus and cortex) or Luxol fast
blue staining (corpus striatum) (Sch€
abitz et al., 2000). In the hemisphere ipsilateral to
MCAo insult, a light microscope BR044 (Carl Zeiss) with an immersion objective lens
(40  ) and a large-ﬁeld ocular lens (8) was used to measure the CA1 hippocampal
normal and damaged neurons from sham-operated, vehicle- or JM-20-treated
brains. A rat brain atlas with anatomical explanations of the terminology adopted
by Paxinos and Watson (Paxinos and Watson, 2005) was used to identify the CA1
region. Pyramidal cells showing atrophy, shrinkage, nuclear pyknosis, dark cytoplasmic coloration or ambient empty spaces all indicated cell degeneration (Bian
et al., 2007). To assess neuronal damage, the average number of viable neurons in
the ﬁxed lateral CA1 areas (150  320 mm) was counted from using ImageJ 1.41
(National Institutes of Health, USA). Cell counts were expressed as a percentage of
the sham group (Plahta et al., 2004).
As in the hippocampus, an ocular grid with a square side of 130 mm in the 20
ocular lens with a 40 objective was used to count the total numbers of normal and
pathological neurons in each ﬁxed cortical region.
In the corpus striatum, white matter lesions were evaluated. The myelin in 3
sections per animal and both hemispheres of the selected areas were stained with
Luxol fast blue. The severity of white matter lesions was graded as 0 (normal), 1
(disarrangement of nerve ﬁbers), 2 (formation of marked vacuoles), and 3 (disappearance of myelinated ﬁbers), according to a previously described grading system
(Wakita et al., 2002).
2.6. Isolation of brain mitochondria
Mitochondria were isolated from sham-operated rats brains and the ipsilateral
cerebral hemispheres from rats treated with vehicle or JM-20 (2, 4 and 8 mg/kg) 1 h
after reperfusion (n ¼ 5 for each group) as described by Mirandola et al. (2010), with
minor modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, after 90 min of MCAo and 24 h reperfusion, rats were
sacriﬁced by decapitation, and their brains were rapidly removed (within 1 min) and
placed into 10 mL of ice-cold ‘‘isolation buffer’’ containing 225 mM mannitol,
75 mM sucrose, 1 mM K-EGTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, fatty-acid free), and
10 mM K-HEPES (pH 7.2). The cerebellum and underlying structures were removed,
and the remaining tissue, which was considered the forebrain, was used to isolate
brain mitochondria. The forebrains were cut into small pieces using surgical scissors
and extensively washed in isolation buffer. The tissue was then manually homogenized in a glass Dounce homogenizer with both a loose-ﬁtting and a tight-ﬁtting
pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged for 3 min at 2000  g in a Hettich centrifuge (Germany), Rotanta 460R. After centrifugation, the supernatant was centrifuged for 8 min at 12,000  g. The pellet was resuspended in 10 mL isolation buffer
containing 20 mL of 10% digitonin, which was used to release synaptosomal mitochondria, and recentrifuged for 10 min at 12,000  g. The supernatant and the upper
light layer of the pellet were discarded, and the dark pellet was resuspended in
isolation buffer devoid of EGTA. This homogenate was then centrifuged for 10 min at
12,000  g. The supernatant was discarded, and the ﬁnal pellet gently washed and
resuspended in isolation buffer devoid of EGTA, at an approximate protein concentration of 30e40 mg/mL. The entire procedure was carried out at 4  C. The
respiratory control ratio (state 3/state 4 respiratory rate) was greater than 4,
measured using 5 mM succinate as a substrate.
To determine total mitochondrial calcium, the isolation buffers also contained
ruthenium red (1 mM) to prevent Ca2þ inﬂux via calcium uniporters, oligomycin
(1 mM) to inhibit the F1FO ATP synthase to preserve organelle membrane potentials,
and Cyclosporine A (1 mM) to prevent any outﬂow of calcium via mitochondrial
permeability transition pore. A mitochondrial suspension (2 mg/mL) was subjected
to a hypo-osmotic shock with ultrapure water and to 3 consecutive ultrasound cycles of 5 min to release total intra-mitochondrial calcium.
2.6.1. Continuous-monitoring mitochondrial assays
Mitochondrial respiration was monitored polarographically by an oxygraph
equipped with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Hansatech instruments, Oxytherm
electrode unit, UK), and the mitochondrial membrane potential (DJm) was

determined spectroﬂuorimetrically using 10 mM safranine O as a probe (Zanotti and
Azzone, 1980; Pardo-Andreu et al., 2011) in a POLARstar Omega ﬂuorescence
spectrophotometer (Germany) at 495/586 nm excitation/emission wavelengths;
these assays were performed in the presence of 0.1 mM EGTA and 2 mM K2HPO4.
Mitochondrial swelling was estimated spectrophotometrically from the decrease in
apparent absorbance at 540 nm using a Model U-2910 Hitachi spectrophotometer
(Japan). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were monitored spectroﬂuorimetrically using 1 mM Amplex red (Molecular Probes, OR, USA) and 1 UI/mL horseradish peroxidase at 563/587 nm excitation/emission wavelengths (Pardo-Andreu et al., 2011;
Votyakova and Reynolds, 2001). Variations in free medium and mitochondrial calcium concentrations were examined by measuring changes in the absorbance
spectrum of Arsenazo III, at 675e685 nm wavelengths (Bento et al., 2007). For all
assays, mitochondria were energized with 5 mM potassium succinate (plus 2.5 mM
rotenone) in a standard medium consisting of 125 mM sucrose, 65 mM KCl and
10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, at 30  C.

2.6.2. Mitochondrial ultrastructural analysis
Ultrastructural changes on brain mitochondria were evaluated by transmission
electron microscopy. Mitochondrial suspension (2 mg/mL) was ﬁxed in 2.5%
glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 h
at 4  C. After three washes in cacodylate buffer, the tissues were postﬁxed with 1%
osmium tetroxide plus 0.8% potassium ferricyanide and 5 mM CaCl2 in the same
buffer for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with cacodylate buffer.
The pellet were then dehydrated in an acetone series and embedded in Polybed
resin. Ultrathin sections were obtained with an ultramicrotome (UltraCut-UCT,
Leica, Austria) and stained with 2% uranyl acetate (15 min) and lead citrate (5 min)
and observed under a Zeiss EM109 (Carl Zeiss. Inc., Thornwood, NY, USA) transmission electron microscopy (Silva et al., 2013).

2.6.3. Cytochrome c release from rat brain mitochondria
Isolated rat brain mitochondria (2 mg/ml) were incubated (10 min) in standard
medium supplemented with succinate (5 mM), rotenone (2.5 mM) and PI (2 mM).
Mitochondria were sedimented by high-speed centrifugation, and the differential
absorption spectra (reduced with dithionite/oxidized) of the supernatants were
recorded in a 96-well plate (l ¼ 1 cm). The cytochrome c absorption extinction coefﬁcient (A550  A540 nm) was assumed to be 19.1 mM1 cm1 (Kruglov et al., 2008).

2.7. Statistical analysis
The GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., USA) was used for
statistical analyses. The data are expressed as the means ± SEM. Comparisons among
different groups were performed by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the NewmaneKeuls multiple comparison post hoc test. Differences were
considered statistically signiﬁcant at p < 0.05. All analysis was conducted by one
experimenter who was blinded to the experimental group designations.

3. Results
3.1. Protective effects of JM-20 from OGD-induced cell death in rat
organotypic hippocampal slice cultures
Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures are an in vitro model
used to examine the mechanisms of neuronal injury where the
basic hippocampal architecture and composition are relatively
preserved (Stoppini et al., 1991). This culture method is frequently
used to examine excitotoxic and hypoxic injury to hippocampal
pyramidal neurons and to search for novel neuroprotective strategies. Here, organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were subjected to OGD for 60 min and 24 h of reperfusion in the presence or
absence of JM-20. In undamaged controls lacking OGD exposure, PI
ﬂuorescence was barely detectable (Fig. 1A), whereas OGD exposure caused prominent cell death, as assessed by PI incorporation.
In OGD-exposed slices, JM-20 at concentrations of 0.1, 1 and 10 mM
decreased cell death by 29%, 45% and 73, respectively, compared
with the untreated OGD slices (Fig. 1AeB). Importantly, this
molecule elicited its strong neuroprotective effects after OGD, i.e.,
at the 24 h recovery/reperfusion period with a therapeutic-like
mode of action.

3.2. JM-20 reduced ischemic injury and improved neurological
deﬁcits after transient MCAo in rats
The neuroprotective and multifunctional mechanism of action
~ ez-Figueredo et al., 2014) prompted us to extend our
of JM-20 (Nun
research to an in vivo study. We evaluated the neuroprotective effects of JM-20 on rats subjected to MCAo, a reliable and reproducible rodent model of cerebral ischemia that results in widely
described sensorimotor and cognitive deﬁcits (Bederson et al.,
1986a,b). JM-20 was orally administered at doses of 2, 4, and
8 mg/kg, 1 h after reperfusion. TTC staining of consecutive brain
sections demonstrated that JM-20 greatly reduced the infarct size
(Fig. 2A) without any sign of tissue damage when administered
under basal-non ischemic condition. Computer-assisted quantitative analysis revealed that the total infarct volume in MCAo rats

521

treated with 4 or 8 mg/kg JM-20 was signiﬁcantly reduced
(p < 0.05) when compared with the vehicle-treated group (from
43% in the vehicle-treated group to 5.2% and 0.7%, respectively)
(Fig. 2B). The overall reduction in these infarct volumes by JM-20
could be attributed to a signiﬁcant reduction (p < 0.05) of cortical
(no visible infarct at 4 and 8 mg/kg versus 33.11% in the vehicletreated group; Fig. 2B) and subcortical lesion sizes (a 4.97% and
0.65% reduction at 4 and 8 mg/kg, respectively, versus 10.13% in the
vehicle-treated group; Fig. 2B). The edema index was also signiﬁcantly reduced (p < 0.05) by JM-20 treatment at doses of 4 and
8 mg/kg when compared with the vehicle-treated group (from 1.09
in the vehicle-treated group to 1.04 and 1.00 in the 4 and 8 mg/kg
groups, respectively) (Fig. 2C). Neurological scores were also
assessed after 90 min of MCAo and 24 h of reperfusion. No significant neurological deﬁcits in the sham group were observed (results not shown), but severe neurological deﬁcits were detected in
the vehicle-treated MCAo group. The rats in this group consistently
showed circling movements, severe paw ﬂexion, or decreased
spontaneous movements. JM-20 treatments (4 and 8 mg/kg) 1 h
after reperfusion signiﬁcantly improved (p < 0.05) the neurological
deﬁcits and decreased the neurological scores (Fig. 2D). In both
groups, fewer movement abnormalities in posture and circling
movements were observed compared with the vehicle-treated
group, suggesting that acute JM-20 treatment improved the functional outcome after stroke.

3.3. JM-20 reduced MCAo/reperfusion-induced histopathological
damage
Following 24 h of reperfusion, H&E staining showed histological
changes in hippocampal (CA1) and cortical regions of injured brains
(vehicle-treated rats) with the following characteristics: shrunken
cells with condensed and triangulated-pyknotic nuclei surrounded
by swollen cellular process and cytoplasmic eosinophilia (Fig. 3A).
Luxol fast blue staining (LFB) also showed a loss of LFB in subcortical areas, which denote spongiform changes with a loss of ﬁber
structure and a severe myelin loss. In contrast, normal tissue patterns were observed in brain sections from sham animals (Fig. 3A).
JM-20 (4 and 8 mg/kg) inhibited (p < 0.05) the MCAo/reperfusioninduced damage in all brain regions examined (Fig. 3A). The most
important histological signs of neuroprotection elicited by JM-20
treatment were the preservation of hippocampal and cortical
neurons, with the disappearance of vacuoles and protection from
demyelination in subcortical ﬁbers. To quantitate the neuroprotective effects of JM-20, the percentage of damaged hippocampal and cortical cells was calculated. Fig. 3B and C shows a
signiﬁcant decrease (p < 0.05) in injured hippocampal and cortical
neurons when animals were treated with 4 and 8 mg/kg JM-20
compared with the vehicle group. Similar patterns of protection
were observed in the corpus striatum where the protective effects of
JM-20 against myelin loss was estimated (Fig. 3D).

3.4. JM-20 reduced cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) concentrations of
glutamate and aspartate
Because an increase in glutamate and aspartate levels in the
extracellular ﬂuid is associated with cerebral ischemia brain injuries (Benveniste, 2009), we sought to examine the effects of JM20 treatment on CSF levels of these EAA. As expected, 90 min of
MCAo followed by 24 h of reperfusion caused a signiﬁcant increase
(p < 0.05) in extracellular glutamate and aspartate concentrations
compared with sham-operated rats (13.8 ± 3.48 mM versus
4.8 ± 0.41 mM for glutamate and 5.70 ± 1.35 mM versus
1.95 ± 0.27 mM for aspartate; Fig. 4). JM-20 administered 1 h after
reperfusion at the neuroprotective dose of 8 mg/kg signiﬁcantly
reduced (p < 0.05) the MCAo-induced increase in EAA concentrations compared with vehicle-treated rats (5.5 ± 1.55 and
1.61 ± 0.26 mM for glutamate and aspartate, respectively). Such a
reduction re-established normal EAA levels, as no differences were
observed when compared to the sham-operated group.
3.5. Therapeutic window for JM-20 administration in rats subjected
to transient focal cerebral ischemia
Given the potent neuroprotection observed with 8 mg/kg JM-20,
we sought to deﬁne the therapeutic and protective window for JM20 administration after transient ischemia. Signiﬁcant total infarct
volume reductions (p < 0.05) were observed when JM-20 was
administered at 1 (98e99%), 2 (83e87%), 4 (74e77%), 6 (68e72%)
and 8 h (61e66%) after reperfusion, but not when the JM-20
administration was delayed by 16e23 h (Fig. 5A and B). This protection included cortical and subcortical regions, with the former
mainly contributing to the overall neuroprotection observed in rats
receiving JM-20 during a delayed therapeutic window. A similar
proﬁle of neuroprotection was observed when neurological deﬁcits
were evaluated (Fig. 5C); a signiﬁcant improvement (p < 0.05) in
neurological scores was detected when JM-20 treatment was
administered from 1 to 8 h after reperfusion. However, these
neuroprotective effects were lost when JM-20 administration was
delayed more than 16 h after the ischemic episode.
3.6. In vivo post-ischemic JM-20 treatment prevented MCAoinduced mitochondrial dysfunction and the accumulation of
organellar Ca2þ
Many mechanisms involved in ischemic cell death have been
associated with mitochondrial dysfunction (Sanderson et al., 2013).

523

To conﬁrm that mitochondria are direct JM-20 targets in the brain
and to further probe its mechanism of action, we evaluated the
effects of JM-20 on isolated brain mitochondria from animals
subjected to 90 min MCAo and 24 h reperfusion. Fig. 6 shows that
brain mitochondria isolated from vehicle-treated rats exposed to
MCAo were more susceptible to spontaneous swelling, membrane
potential dissipation and reactive oxygen species generation when
compared with mitochondria from sham-operated rats (trace ‘b’
versus trace ‘a’ in Fig. 6AeC). This ischemic intervention also
increased the total Ca2þ concentration in the organelles (Fig. 6D).
The ultrastuctural analysis revealed a normal morphology in
mitochondria isolated from the sham operated rats, contrasting
with the presence of abnormal-irregularly shaped organelles with
shortening and disintegrating cristae in vehicle treated ischemic
brains (Fig. 6E). Post-ischemic JM-20 treatment dose-dependently
improved mitochondrial function, as evidenced by decreased
spontaneous organellar swelling, a preservation of membrane potential, and a reduction in reactive oxygen species generation (trace
‘b’ versus traces ‘c’, ‘d’, and ‘e’ in Fig. 6AeC). The morphological
examination also supported such functional improvement, evidenced by the presence of regularly-rounded mitochondria
showing increased number of elongated cristae, particularly at a
dose of 8 mg/kg (Fig. 6E). Remarkably, JM-20 treatment also
reduced the total Ca2þ levels in mitochondria isolated from
ischemic rat brains (Fig. 6D), an effect that could explain the in vivo
mitoprotective effects elicited by JM-20 from ischemic rats brains.
Mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation, reactive oxygen
species generation, and permeability transition pores from Ca2þ
accumulation in mitochondria are all events implicated in neuronal
cell death mediated by the intrinsic pathways involved in ischemic/
reperfusion brain damage (Fujimura et al., 1998; Borutaite et al.,
2013; Javadov and Kuznetsov, 2013). In this case, cytochrome c
release from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm is a potent
physiological stimulus for caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation
(Green and Reed, 1998). Therefore, the inhibition of cytochrome c
release might be a primary target of the in vivo neuroprotective
effects of JM-20 in brain ischemia. We observed that at 8 mg/kg,
this novel molecule inhibited cytochrome c release from mitochondria when administered 1 h after rat brain MCAo ischemia/
reperfusion (Fig. 7). Considering the critical role of mitochondria in
apoptotic pathways, the relationship between JM-20 mitoprotection and the inhibition of cytochrome c release is most likely an
important clue to one of its primary/direct mechanisms of therapeutic action (Green and Reed, 1998).
4. Discussion

Fig. 4. Effects of JM-20 on the MCAo-induced increase of EAA concentrations in rat
brains 24 h after reperfusion. JM-20 (8 mg/kg) or vehicle (CMC 0.05%) was orally
administered 1 h after reperfusion. Cerebrospinal ﬂuid was collected 24 h after
reperfusion and analyzed by HPLC to determine glutamate (white bars) and aspartate
(black bars) concentrations. Bars represent mean values ± SEM (n ¼ 6). Different letters: p < 0.05, by ANOVA and post hoc NewmaneKeuls tests.

The main ﬁnding in this present study is that JM-20 treatment
reduced the cerebral damage caused by MCAo in rats, which was
accompanied by mitochondrial stabilization and a decrease of EAA
release. JM-20 treatment produced neuroprotective actions even
when treatment was delayed up to 8 h after reperfusion and
without any apparent toxic effects on brain tissues under basal-non
ischemic conditions.
Cerebral stroke leads to a diminished brain blood supply that
consequently results in substantial tissue damage. Reperfusion also
contributes to the post-ischemic deleterious outcomes, in part,
because of the exacerbation of oxidative stress, a process that involves mitochondria disorder (Li et al., 2012). Abnormal mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting from energetic
impairments after ischemic events, is a known condition involved
in increased ROS generation following reperfusion, causing structural and functional mitochondrial damage and eventually
neuronal death (Sanderson et al., 2013). Our results support this
mechanism because brain mitochondria isolated from ischemic rats

(vehicle-treated group) spontaneously lost their DJm, generated
higher ROS levels, and were more prone to membrane permeabilization/swelling when compared with the sham group. Such
events were associated with higher intramitochondrial Ca2þ levels
and increased release of the pro-apoptotic cytochrome c, which

was prevented by ADP plus oligomycin (result not shown), well
known inhibitors of mitochondrial permeability transition pores
(Saito and Castilho, 2010). It is widely described that excessive
mitochondrial calcium uptake can cause non-selective permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane, also known as

after reperfusion. Rat brain mitochondria were isolated 24 h after reperfusion and assessed for mitochondria swelling (A), mitochondria membrane potential (B), H2O2 generation

described in Materials and methods. Experimental conditions were rat brain mitochondria (RBM) isolated from sham (trace a), vehicle-treated (trace b), and JM-20 treated rats (2, 4
and 8 mg/kg traces c, d, and e, respectively). In Panel B (trace f), the incubation medium was supplemented with the classic protonophore, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl
hydrazone (CCCP 1 mM). In Panel E the arrow shows a mitochondrion with shortened and disintegrating cristae. Scale bars ¼ 500 nm. Panels AeE are representative of 3 different

mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pores (Crompton,
1993; Kowaltowski et al., 2001), that could also contribute to
mitochondrial swelling and DJm dissipation from massive proton
leakage (Crompton, 1993; Kowaltowski et al., 2001).
Calcium-induced cytochrome c release, which occurs in neurons
during stroke and ischemia, involves the rupture of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) and can be blocked by inhibitors
of mitochondrial permeability transition pores. Thus, inhibitors of
MPT have shown efﬁcacy in animal models of ischemia (Jemmerson
et al., 2005). In this regard, JM-20 most likely prevented MPTinduced mitochondrial alterations through the inhibition of calcium inﬂux into the organelles because mitochondria isolated from
in vivo-treated rats exhibited lower calcium levels, a slower DJm
dissipation rate, reduced ROS generation, increased swelling
resistance and lower levels of cytochrome c released into the medium when compared with the mitochondria obtained from the
brains of vehicle-treated rats. These results are in agreement with
our previous report showing the in vitro mitoprotective effects of
JM-20 in isolated rat liver mitochondria, where JM-20 exerted
similar protection to the protective effects elicited by the classic
MPT inhibitor CsA against calcium plus Pi-mediated mitochondrial
~ ez-Figueredo et al., 2014). Moreover, in this recent
impairment (Nun
study, JM-20 also inhibited Ca2þ-mediated cytochrome c release, a
process critically involved in apoptosis and often associated with
MPT (Kim et al., 2003; Jemmerson et al., 2005).
The precise mechanisms underlying the JM-20-induced reduction in total mitochondrial calcium levels observed here are
currently not fully known. We recently reported that this molecule
prevented the in vitro Ca2þ uptake in energized rat liver mito~ ez-Figueredo et al., 2014). This effect could explain
chondria (Nun
the lower intramitochondrial Ca2þ levels after in vivo JM-20 treatment. However, the reduction of calcium entry into neurons
through the suppressed activation of L-subtype voltage-gated calcium channels after ischemic depolarization by the dihydropyridine moiety of JM-20 is another plausible mechanism. The
inhibition of Ca2þ entry at both the neuronal and mitochondrial
levels by nimodipine and ruthenium red, respectively, have been
reported as neuroprotective in rats subjected to MCAo and

reperfusion (Zhao et al., 2013; Babu and Ramanathan, 2011). Thus,
the former, latter or both mechanisms may partly explain JM-20's
neuroprotective effects.
We also observed that CSF glutamate and aspartate levels were
augmented as result of the ischemic event 24 h after reperfusion
onset. This observation was not surprising because excitotoxicity is
one of the major mechanisms associated with neuronal damage in
stroke, which is triggered by an exacerbated increase in extracellular excitatory transmitter levels (Benveniste, 2009). In fact,
mitochondrial Ca2þ overload and dysfunction, from the excitotoxic
activation of glutamate receptors, is a crucial early event that follows ischemic or traumatic brain injury (Nicholls et al., 2007).
Treatment with JM-20 (8 mg/kg) markedly reduced the CSF levels
of these EAA, which could contribute to the overall neuroprotection
elicited by JM-20. The lowering of CSF EAA levels observed after
in vivo JM-20 treatment could reﬂect the preservation of neuronal
cell integrity and mitochondrial functionality, which may restore
energy balance and consequently the function of the neuronal
membrane ATP-dependent ionic pumps. Accordingly, we recently
reported that JM-20 has the ability to inhibit the hydrolytic activity
of the mitochondrial F1FO ATP synthase in submitochondrial par~ ez-Figueredo et al.,
ticles and intact rat liver mitochondria (Nun
2014). Therefore, our results suggest that JM-20 may prevent
neuronal cell death during ischemia by also maintaining cell energy
balance, which in turn could drive neuronal recovery processes.
Neuroprotection from ischemic stroke is deﬁned as any strategy
that antagonizes, interrupts, or slows the sequence of injurious
biochemical and molecular events that, if left unchecked, would
end in irreversible ischemic brain injury (Ginsberg, 2008). In this
sense, neuroprotective approaches predict that ischemic brain
damage can be prevented, in part, from evolving into infarctions
through any intervention that modulates key aspects of the
ischemic cascade. Great effort has been invested to decipher
ischemic mechanisms and elucidate neuroprotective therapies.
Among the numerous identiﬁed steps, excessive activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors, intracellular calcium accumulation,
overproduction of free radicals, neuroinﬂammation, and initiation
of apoptotic signaling are believed to play critical roles in ischemic

Fig. 7. Effects of JM-20 on MCAo-induced cytochrome c release from rat brain mitochondria isolated 24 h after reperfusion onset. JM-20 (8 mg/kg) or vehicle (CMC 0.05%)
was orally administered 1 h after reperfusion. Incubation conditions are described in
the Materials and Methods. Rat brain mitochondria (2 mg/ml) were sedimented after a
standard incubation period. The data are presented as the means ± SEM of 3 independent experiments. Different letters: p < 0.05, by ANOVA and post hoc NewmaneKeuls tests.

damage (Fisher, 1997). It is predicted that the interruption of these
steps could protect brain tissue. Additionally, it is crucial that
effective neuroprotective approaches include either a combination
of strategies directed toward multiple cell death pathways or the
use of a single compound that may affect more than one cell death
mechanism. Mitochondria are directly or indirectly linked to most
of the above-mentioned mediators of ischemic damage; thus, targeting these organelles may allow the simultaneous modulation of
various mechanisms relevant to a brain ischemic event. In this regard, “mitochondrial therapeutics” may hold promise for preventing cell injuries related to ischemic brain injury (Christophe
and Nicolas, 2006).
Here we observed that in vivo post-ischemic JM-20 treatment
most likely targets rat brain mitochondria, as it prevents several
mitochondrial events linked to ischemic neuronal damage, such as
intramitochondrial Ca2þ overload, the opening of permeability
transition pores, membrane potential dissipation and cytochrome c
release. We propose that these events may contribute to the strong
neuroprotective effects elicited by this novel molecule. At the same
time, its ability to reduce CSF glutamate and aspartate levels of
ischemic rats may be associated with other extramitochondrial
sites of action, such as neuronal GABA receptors. We recently
demonstrated that JM-20 had a similar anxiolytic and sedative
proﬁle to diazepam, which was most likely mediated by its in vivo
GABAergic effects (Figueredo et al., 2013). On the other hand, we
have previously suggested that the cytoprotective effects exerted
by JM-20 on primary cerebellar granule neuron cultures exposed to
toxic concentrations of glutamate possibly involved functional
GABAergic enhancements due to its benzodiazepine-like structure
~ ez-Figueredo et al., 2014). Potentiation of endogenous GABA
(Nun
activity could counteract the excitotoxic cascade by reducing
postsynaptic hyperexcitability and presynaptic glutamate release
from nerve terminals (Green et al., 2000). Because it has been
demonstrated that GABA receptor agonists are neuroprotective (Xu
et al., 2008), the participation of GABA and NMDA receptors in the
neuroprotection elicited by JM-20 may be interesting to assess. To
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that a multi-target drug
candidate that has anti-excitotoxic and mitoprotective effects has
been preclinically evaluated in experimental brain ischemia
models. The combination of several anti-ischemic effects into one
small molecule endows it with a high potential translation from the
bench to bedside as a neuroprotective agent against ischemic
stroke.
Notably, the effects of JM-20 on both cerebral infarct volume and
neurological performance manifested even when JM-20

administration was delayed up to 8 h after reperfusion, indicating a
wide therapeutic time window for JM-20 administration in a rat
stroke model. As previously suggested (Li and Stephenson, 2002),
preclinical studies demonstrating neurological function preservation in addition to a reduction in infarct size may improve the
predictive value of animal models for clinical efﬁcacy of novel
neuroprotective agents.
Our results showed the beneﬁcial effects of JM-20 against cerebral ischemia and paved the way for a potential therapeutic
clinical application. In particular, this present study strongly suggests the ability of JM-20 to simultaneously target several critical
aspects of the ischemic cascade, i.e., excitotoxicity and mitochondrial impairment. JM-20's mitoprotective effects may also provide
other potential therapeutic applications in other CNS neurodegenerative disorders associated to mitochondrial alterations, such
as Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases.
