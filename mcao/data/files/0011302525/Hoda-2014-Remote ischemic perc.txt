Abstract Remote ischemic conditioning is neuroprotective
in young male rodents after experimental stroke. However, it
has never been tested in females whom remain at higher risk
of stroke injury after menopause. We tested remote ischemic
perconditioning therapy (RIPerC) at 2 h after embolic stroke
in ovariectomized (OVX) female mice with and without intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) treatment.
We assessed cerebral blood flow (CBF), neurobehavioral

outcomes, infarction, hemorrhage, edema, and survival.
RIPerC therapy with and without IV-tPA improved the CBF
and neurobehavioral outcomes and reduced the infarction,
hemorrhage, and edema significantly. Late IV-tPA alone at
4 h post-stroke neither improved the neurobehavior nor reduced the infarction but aggravated hemorrhage and mortality
in OVX mice. RIPerC therapy prevented the increased mortality during late IV-tPA. Our study demonstrates for the first
time that RIPerC therapy is effective in OVX females.

Introduction
While neuroprotective agents in acute stroke clinical trials
have failed, a promising therapeutic approach is the modulation of endogenous protective mechanisms by remote ischemic per- and post- conditioning (RIPerC and RIPostC), a safe,
inexpensive and feasible therapy for stroke. RIPerC and
RIPostC are effective in reducing infarct size and improving
functional outcomes in different rodent models of stroke [1].
However, all these preclinical studies to date have been done
in young male rodents. Despite some promising clinical trials
of limb conditioning in cardiac patients, there are still no
preclinical studies in females. The progression of post-stroke
pathophysiology primarily depends upon the dynamics of
cerebral blood flow (CBF) and may be sexually dimorphic
[2–4]. A therapy that works in males after stroke may not be
effective in females [2, 4–6]. Moreover, there is an increasing
interest in therapies that can reduce reperfusion injury.
Therefore, the Stroke Academic Industry Roundtable
(STAIR) recommends preclinical studies in both sexes of
animals in clinically relevant models and therapies that can
reduce reperfusion injury [7].

Transl. Stroke Res. (2014) 5:484–490

An embolic model of stroke in animals better approximates the dynamics of CBF changes, infarct progression,
and maturation as it occurs in humans and also allows
combination studies with intravenous tissue plasminogen
activator (IV-tPA) [2, 3, 8], the only FDA approved reperfusion therapy. We reported that RIPerC therapy after
embolic stroke in young male mice increases ‘early’ CBF,
subsequently leading to neurobehavioral benefits and neuroprotection with and without IV-tPA [9]. However, the
therapeutic potential of RIPerC therapy has never been
tested in female rodents. Such preclinical data is necessary
before RIPerC can be translated into humans and before
clinical trials of RIPerC and RIPostC can be initiated in
acute stroke.
In this work, we tested RIPerC therapy at 2 h after embolic
stroke in ovariectomized female (OVX) mice with and without ‘late’ IV-tPA at 4 h, that is, near the end of the ‘clinical
time window’. OVX mice are frequently used as a model of
post-menopausal women whom remain at higher risk of stroke
and poor outcomes [5]. We reported that non-OVX young
females are comparatively resistant to embolic stroke injury,
which is lost after ovariectomy [10]. Such OVX mice are also
inclined to hemorrhagic transformations (HT) after embolic
stroke. In this study, we used OVX mice 2-month postovariectomy and at the age of ∼6 months. We hypothesized
that RIPerC alone will remain effective in OVX mice as in
males due to early CBF improvement and will reduce the
detrimental effects of late IV-tPA.

neurobehavioral tests as discussed below and injury size estimation were performed on all the surviving animals of this
cohort. In Experiment II, six surviving animals of each group
were assigned each for hemorrhagic transformation and edema quantitation.
The grouping, sample size estimation, randomization, and
blinding strategies including all other animal procedures and
treatments were similar to as reported earlier by us [9–11] and
in the related supplementary information. The survival and
mortality from both the above experiments was pooled and
summarized in Table 1. All the animals were sacrificed 24-h
post-stroke. Because of higher death rate in OVX mice [10]
and anticipated further increase in the mortality due to late IVtPA treatment and HT, we reduced the size of the clot and used
a 7.0±0.5-mm long clot.

Remote Ischemic Perconditioning (RIPerC) Therapy
The noninvasive RIPerC procedures in anesthetized animals have been reported earlier as well as recently and
were found effective [12, 13]. At 2-h post-stroke, RIPerC
sham procedure in non-conditioned groups (eMCAO+Veh
and eMCAO+tPA groups) or RIPerC therapy in the conditioned groups (eMCAO+RIPerC and eMCAO+RIPerC+
tPA groups; 250±10 mm Hg×4 cycles, 10 min each×
10 min interval between cycles) were performed noninvasively under mild isofluorane anesthesia using an exclusive
programmable cuff-based conditioner and (Hatteras
Instruments, NC, USA).

Neurobehavioral Assessments

The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Georgia
Regents University (GRU) approved all animal procedures
prior to the start of the experiments as per the National
Institute of Health guidelines. A total of 140 C57BL/6 J wild
type OVX mice (20±2 weeks old; 8±1 weeks post-OVX;
Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine) housed in GRU's
AAALAC accredited facility were used in the following experiments. As reported earlier by us [9] and based on two
RIPerC (no vs. yes) by two tPA (no vs. yes) design, the
following two experiments were performed in four groups,
eMCAO + Veh, eMCAO + RIPerC, eMCAO + tPA, and
eMCAO + RIPerC +tPA. In Experiment I, early relative
CBF changes out to 6 h were performed on six animals per
group using laser Doppler flowmeter (LDF; PeriFlux 5001,
PeriMed Inc., Sweden) as reported earlier and in the related
supplementary information [9]. Representative images were
also obtained from each group using PIM3 laser Doppler
scanner (PeriMed), and the cerebral perfusion of the two
h e m i s p h e r e s w e r e c o m p a r e d [ 9 – 11 ] . D i f f e r e n t

Adhesive tape test to detect sensorimotor deficit was performed at 18–20-h post-stroke with slight modification [14,
15]. Briefly, naïve mice were acclimatized for 3 days prior to
surgery. Within maximum time duration of 180 s, the tape
removal time was recorded as the function of sensorimotor
outcome. Mice were scored 180 s if they failed to remove the
tape. Neurological deficit score (NDS) was assessed at 24-h
post-stroke and before sacrifice.

Spectrophotometric Assay of Intracerebral Hemorrhage
Hemoglobin (Hb) content (n=6 per group) in the brain was
estimated as reported [16]. Briefly, 20 uL of supernatant
obtained from the ipsilateral tissue homogenate (n=6 per
group) was mixed with 80 uL of Drabkin's reagent (Sigma
Chemical Co.). The 96-well plate was read at 540 nm after
15 min. Hb-content in the brain samples was calculated from
the standard curve.
Estimation of Edema
Brain water content (n=6 per group) was determined as an
indicator of edema, as described by Hoda et al [17].
Statistical Analyses
All the data are expressed as mean±SD, statistical analyses
were performed as reported earlier using SAS 9.3 (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Briefly, a rank transformation
was used prior to analysis where needed to stabilize variance
across groups. A two RIPerC (no vs. yes) by two tPA (no vs.
yes) ANOVA with interaction was used to analyze ‘within
time CBF’, neurobehavioral outcomes, stroke injury, Hbcontent, and edema in experiments I and II. In the absence
of a significant interaction, the main effects are considered to
be additive when combined. The effect of groups on survival
mortality was determined using chi-square tests. Statistical
significance was determined at p<0.05.

Results
RIPerC After Embolic Stroke Improved CBF With
and Without IV-tPA
The immediate post-stroke CBF relative to the pre-ischemic
value in the ipsilateral hemisphere, as measured by the LDF,
was not significantly different between the groups (Fig. 1a,
Experiment I). RIPerC therapy 6 h post-stroke in eMCAO+
RIPerC group improved the CBF as compared with RIPerC
sham-operated eMCAO + Veh group (RIPerC effect p=
0.0040 at 6 h post-stroke). Late IV-tPA therapy also improved
the CBF significantly in eMCAO+tPA group (tPA effect
p<0.0001 at 6 h post-stroke). RIPerC showed an additive
effect in combination with IV-tPA therapy in further improving the CBF since there was no significant interaction between
the two treatments (interaction effect, p=0.39 at 6 h posteMCAO). Moreover, cerebral perfusion imaging by PIM3
laser scanner in the representative animals 6 h after stroke
confirmed these changes (Fig. 1b).

RIPerC After Embolic Stroke Conferred Neurobehavioral
Benefits and Neuroprotection With and Without IV-tPA
We tested the surviving animals from Experiment I for two
different behavioral outcomes at 18–24 h post-stroke
(Fig. 2a,b). The main effects of RIPerC on both sensorimotor
and NDS outcomes were significant (p=0.0004 and p=
0.0003, respectively). There was neither a significant effect
of IV-tPA nor a significant interaction between the treatments. RIPerC significantly improved the sensorimotor function in eMCAO+RIPerC group as compared with eMCAO+
Veh (101.7±35.2 vs. 156.4±21.9; p=0.014). IV-tPA treatment alone in eMCAO+tPA group did not improve the
sensorimotor function significantly as compared with
eMCAO+Veh (163.2±22.3 vs. 156.4±21.9; p=0.98). The
sensorimotor function of the eMCAO+RIPerC group was
significantly better than the eMCAO+tPA group (p=0.0051).
On the other hand, combination therapy in eMCAO +
RIPerC+tPA group significantly improved the sensorimotor
function as compared with eMCAO+tPA (120.0±39.9 vs.
163.2±22.3; p=0.046) but not significantly when compared
with eMCAO+Veh (p=0.11). RIPerC significantly improved
the neurologic outcome in eMCAO+RIPerC group as compared with eMCAO+Veh (2.25±0.89 vs. 3.43±0.53; p=
0.047). IV-tPA therapy alone in eMCAO+tPA group did
not improve the neurologic outcome significantly as compared with eMCAO+Veh (3.43±0.79 vs. 3.43±0.53; p=1.0).
The neurologic outcome of the eMCAO+RIPerC group was
significantly better than the eMCAO+tPA group (p=0.042).
On the other hand, combination therapy in eMCAO +
RIPerC+tPA group significantly improved the neurologic
outcome as compared with eMCAO+Veh (2.28±0.90 vs.
3.43±0.53; p=0.030) and eMCAO+tPA (p=0.030).
Figure 2c,d (Experiment I) shows the representative
images of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)stained coronal sections and infarct volumes, respectively. The analysis of effects on the infarct volume
reduction indicates that the main effect of RIPerC was
significant (p< 0.0001), but the effect of IV-tPA and
their interaction were not significant (p= 0.51 and p=
0.70, respectively). RIPerC therapy alone in eMCAO +
RIPerC group significantly reduced the injury size as
compared with eMCAO +Veh (31.1± 4.6 vs. 45.6 ±6.2;
p= 0.0035). IV-tPA treatment alone in eMCAO + tPA
group did not reduce the injury size as compared with
the eMCAO + Veh (46.3 ± 10.5 vs. 45.6 ± 6.2; p= 0.99).
Combination therapy in eMCAO + RIPerC + tPA group
significantly reduced the infarct size when compared
with the eMCAO +tPA group (33.8 ±7.2 vs. 46.3 ±6.2;
p=0.0075) and also as compared with the eMCAO +
Veh group (p= 0.013), but it was not significantly different when compared with the eMCAO +RIPerC group
(p= 0.85).

Moreover, RIPerC reduced the edema while it was increased
due to late IV-tPA therapy. The main effects of RIPerC (p=

Edema in the eMCAO+RIPerC group was significantly lower
as compared with the eMCAO+Veh group (p=0.048) and the
eMCAO+tPA group (p=0.0011). Edema was increased due to
late IV-tPA therapy but it was not significantly different as
compared with the eMCAO+Veh (p=0.35), possibly due to
higher mortality after IV-tPA alone treatment and resulting
survival selection bias in the group. There was a significant
decrease in the edema volume in eMCAO+RIPerC+tPA
group when compared with eMCAO+tPA (p=0.015).
Combined RIPerC Treatment with IV-tPA Provided Survival
Benefits
The survival mortality recorded from experiments I and II had
been pooled and presented in Table 1. There was a significant
group effect on survival (p= 0.0017). RIPerC alone in
eMCAO+RIPerC group did not show any significant survival
benefits (∼10 % improvement) as compared with the
eMCAO+Veh group (76.7 % vs. 66.7 %; p=0.22). Mortality
was increased with late IV-tPA alone in the eMCAO+tPA
group by ∼20 % as compared with the eMCAO+Veh group
(47.5 % vs. 66.7 %; p=0.024). RIPerC therapy prior to IV-tPA
increased survival by ∼22 % in eMCAO+RIPerC+tPA group

as compared with eMCAO+tPA (70.0 % vs. 47.5 %; p=
0.0038) but not in comparison with eMCAO+Veh (p=0.67).

Discussion
RIPerC therapy after embolic stroke in OVX mice conferred
neurobehavioral and neuroprotective benefits. Of clinical importance, RIPerC therapy prior to late IV-tPA treatment reduced the mortality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first preclinical report in which RIPerC had been tested in
OVX females.
In agreement with our previous report in male mice [9], we
found that the RIPerC therapy remains effective in improving
early CBF and outcomes (Figs. 1 and 2). RIPerC but ‘not’ late
IV-tPA alone improved the functional outcomes and reduced
the injury size. Contrary to our findings in males [9], IV-tPA
therapy alone failed to reduce the injury size in OVX mice,
which is in agreement with a previous report [18]. This indicates that OVX mice might have increased risk of early
neurovascular stress due to compromised vascular patency
and blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity due to surgical ovariectomy [19, 20], which can further limit benefits of IV-tPA
treatment. Prior RIPerC therapy reduced the detrimental effects and preserved the benefits of IV-tPA, when combined.
Recanalization by thrombolysis and intra-arterial
thrombectomy may not necessarily reperfuse microvessels.

Recent preclinical and clinical reports conclude that the improvement in microvascular perfusion is more critical for
better post-stroke outcomes [21–23]. As evident from
Figs. 1 and 2, only RIPerC but not late IV-tPA-mediated
increase in cerebral perfusion reduced the infarct size and
improved behavioral outcomes. Recent clinical trial evidence
also demonstrates that remote limb conditioning improves
cerebral perfusion, improves recovery from stroke, and decreases risk of stroke in patients with intracranial arterial
stenosis [24].
Preclinical studies show that gender difference exists after
stroke [4, 5]. Stroke is less frequent in pre-menopausal women, but menopause abolishes this advantage and increases the
risk of stroke injury. While some preclinical studies used
OVX mice 10 days post-ovariectomy [4, 25], we used mice

489

2-months post-ovariectomy and at 6 months of age. In agreement with the previous reports [26], we noted that 2 months of
further aging after ovariectomy eventually brings phenotypic
changes in the OVX mice due to significant change in their
body weight. Since gain in the body weight after ovariectomy
is a very common ovariectomy-associated problem in women
[26–28], we assume that 2-months post-OVX mice better
models ‘surgical menopause’ than earlier time points. As
evident from Fig. 3 and Table 1, RIPerC treatment alone not
only attenuated the brain Hb-content as well as edema progression in OVX mice but also reduced the mortality. Late IVtPA treatment alone resulted in the highest mortality (Table 1)
possibly because of higher HT and edema formation.
However, edema and injury size in the IV-tPA alone group
were not significantly different from the untreated stroke
control group, most likely due to survival selection bias.
RIPerC when combined with late IV-tPA decreased both Hbcontent in the brain as well as edema and reduced the mortality
associated with late IV-tPA.
In view of our previous report in male mice [9] and the
present communication, RIPerC seems to have a sex independent therapeutic potential for the treatment of stroke.
However, the preclinical package still has certain limitations.
First, we did not use aged mice of both sexes simultaneously,
which better represent the majority of stroke sufferers. We
have ongoing work in this direction, which will not only bring
further age and sex dependent preclinical information but also
the short- and long-term treatment benefits of remote ischemic
conditioning. Second, as per the STAIR recommendations,
therapeutic potential of RIPerC should be tested in the animals
with comorbid conditions like hypertension and diabetes,
which further worsen post-stroke outcomes. Third, we detected CBF changes by laser Doppler that mostly measures blood
flow close to the brain's surface [21] but not deeper into the
brain. It is necessary to further study the effect of RIPerC on
CBF after stroke using sensitive techniques and in animals
with comorbidities. Collectively, these are caveats in our
preclinical package to date and require further attention in
future studies.
Despite these limitations, we provide the first evidence that
RIPerC is safe and effective in OVX females, a necessary
milestone before this therapy can be considered for translation
into human stroke and prior to the initiation of clinical trials in
acute ischemic stroke.
