Background and Purpose—New-definition transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are frequent but difficult to diagnose because
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-negative by definition. However, hidden underlying cell damage might be present
and account for the reported long-lasting cognitive impairment after TIAs. Most prior rodent models of true TIA targeted
the striatum or have not been fully characterized. Here we present the MRI, behavioral, and quantitative cell changes
characterizing a new rodent model of true TIA targeting the more behaviorally relevant cerebral cortex.
Methods—Fifteen-minute distal middle cerebral artery occlusion was performed in 29 spontaneously hypertensive rats
allowed to survive for 7 to 60 days. Behavior was assessed serially using both global neurological and fine sensorimotor
tests. Diffusion- and T2-weighted MRI was obtained 20 min postreperfusion and again 7 to 60 days later, and then
changes in neurons and microglia were quantified across the middle cerebral artery territory using immunohistochemistry.
Results—No MRI changes or pan-necrosis were observed at any time point, but patchy cortical selective neuronal loss
affected 28/29 rats, regardless of survival interval, together with topographically congruent microglial activation
that gradually declined over time. The Neuroscore was unchanged, but there was marked contralateral sensorimotor
impairment, still recovering by day 28.
Conclusions—Our new rodent model mimicking true cortical TIA is characterized by normal MRI, but consistent cortical
selective neuronal loss and microglial activation and long-lasting sensorimotor deficits. By causing selective neuronal
loss, TIAs and silent microemboli might affect neuronal reserve, thereby increasing long-term cognitive impairment risk.
Selective neuronal loss and microglial activation might represent novel therapeutic targets that could be detectable in vivo
after TIAs using appropriate imaging tracers.   (Stroke. 2015;46:1084-1092. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.007581.)

ost transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are secondary to
transient arterial occlusion from upstream blood clot.
According to their new tissue-based definition, TIAs are characterized both clinically by focal neurological symptoms of
ischemic origin lasting <24 hours and radiologically by a lack
of topographically congruent changes on diffusion-weighted
imaging (DWI) or FLAIR magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
performed within 2 weeks of the clinical event.1 Normal imaging in true TIAs, which account for 20% to 50% of all clinically diagnosed TIAs,2 makes them difficult to differentiate
from nonischemic transient focal neurological events; hence,
their diagnosis rests entirely on clinical skills. Up to 45% of
all DWI-negative transient focal neurological events are eventually not classified as genuine TIAs.2
The lack of detectable changes on structural MRI in TIAs
does not, however, rule out the presence of microscopic

damage, such as selective neuronal loss (SNL) and microglial activation (MA). Recently, impairment in subtle cognitive
tests after TIAs, despite normal neurological examination,
has been repeatedly reported,3–5 suggesting underlying tissue
damage. Interestingly, positron emission tomography imaging using appropriate tracers is able to detect SNL and MA
in vivo.6,7 It is therefore of translational importance to develop
rodent models of MRI-negative TIAs to investigate whether
these histopathologic changes effectively occur and, if so,
characterize their behavioral counterparts.
Previous work using brief proximal middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAo) in rats has documented the occurrence of
SNL and MA, despite normal MRI.8,9 However, this model
primarily targets the striatum, whereas in the clinical setting,
TIAs tend to preferentially affect the cortex.10,11 Furthermore,
cortical damage is more likely to result in long-lasting

behavioral changes.12 Three previous studies using brief (<1
hour) distal temporary MCAo (tMCAo) targeting the cortex
all reported pure SNL.13–15 However, none documented pure
SNL as a consistent outcome nor addressed its behavioral
correlates. Furthermore, they all used relatively early time
points for histopathologic assessment, which may be suboptimal given the possibility of slow infarct maturation.16
Here we validated and characterized a novel rodent model of
cortical TIA using distal tMCAo in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) by means of (i) MRI performed both soon
after reperfusion and after several days; (ii) serial behavioral
assessment; and (iii) quantitative assessment of SNL and
MA throughout the MCA territory after survival delays ≤60
days.

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

This study was performed in accordance with the legislation of UK
Animals Scientific Procedures Act 1986 and after approval by the
Cambridge University Ethical Review Panel. This included the requirement to keep the number of animals to a minimum, yet sufficient
to obtain meaningful results.

Overall Study Design
SHRs were elected because this strain is best representative of the
clinical stroke population and because among rat strains it shows
both the largest and least variable infarct size after MCAo, including
with the distal clip model.17–20 We chose a 15-min distal MCAo duration based on previous literature and own previous work (Methods
in the online-only Data Supplement). Two successive series of experiments were performed, involving altogether 29 young adult (3–6
months old) male SHRs (≈300 g; Charles River, UK). In the first
(Part 1), we documented consistent cortical SNL without MRI or
histopathologic evidence of infarction up to day 60, and in the second (Part 2), we replicated this outcome and characterized its behavioral correlates.
Part 1 used 23 consecutive rats, including 7 left to survive 28 days
for the main study; 3 rats each to 45 or 60 days to ensure lack of
delayed infarct maturation; and 5 rats each to 7 and 14 days as to
examine early presence of SNL. NeuN, OX42, and GFAP immunohistochemistry was performed to assess changes in neurons, microglia,
and astrocytes, respectively. In Part 2, 6 consecutive SHRs were used;
behavior was assessed serially until killing at 28 days; and immunofluorescence using NeuN and IB4 was performed to assess SNL and
MA, respectively.

Common Procedures
Anesthesia
Experiments were performed in freely breathing animals under 2%
isoflurane and 1:3 O2/N2O mix.14 Body temperature was monitored
with a rectal probe and strictly maintained at 37.0°C ausing a heated
pad throughout all procedures. SaO2 and heart beat were continuously
monitored using a pulse-oximeter and were within physiological limits throughout.

MCAo
Distal microclip left tMCAo was performed as detailed previously.14,15 The clip was removed after 15 mins and the wound closed.
Reperfusion was visually confirmed on clip removal15 and by MRI angiography in a subset of rats (see below). We have previously reported
consistent recanalization on time of flight-MRI angiography using this
model.14 To avoid additional procedural complications that may affect
tissue outcome, including blood loss from femoral cannulation, arterial blood pressure was not measured here and is known to be already
significantly elevated (>170 mm Hg) by 3 months of age in SHRs.21,22

MRI
MRI was performed at day 0, ≈20 min postreperfusion, and again
immediately before perfusion-fixation in Series 1 and at 14 days
in Series 2 subjects. The protocol included T2-weighted and DWI
scans in all rats and MRI angiography in a subset of Part 1 rats. MRI
data analysis was visual, although an ancillary analysis of MRI signal looking for potential subtle markers of SNL was also performed
(Methods in the online-only Data Supplement).

Histopathology
On the final experimental day, perfusion-fixation was performed
and the brain cryosectioned as detailed previously14,15 and in
Methods in the online-only Data Supplement. Ischemic lesions
were classified into 3 main subtypes,14 namely pan-necrosis,
partial infarction, or SNL (Methods in the online-only Data
Supplement).

Part 1: Specific Procedures
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry for NeuN, OX42, and GFAP and standard
Cresyl Violet staining were performed as previously detailed.14,15

Quantitative Assessment of Ischemic Changes
In animals allowed to survive 28, 45, or 60 days post MCAo, formal cell counting was performed as described elsewhere23 in whole
regions-of-interest (ROIs) spanning the MCA territory on both sides,
using a template of 44 prespecified symmetrical ROIs (derived from
Paxinos’ anatomic atlas24) belonging to 8 predetermined coronal sections, as described in detail elsewhere.15 See Methods in the onlineonly Data Supplement for details.
For each ROI, changes in neuron and activated microglia density
were expressed as percentage relative to the contralateral side. In
addition, for each rat, a whole hemisphere average neuronal loss or
MA, to be referred to as CellDens_Total below, was calculated as
the weighted mean percentage change (normalized by the area of the
ROI) across all 44 ROIs for NeuN and OX42, respectively.

Part 2: Specific Procedures
Behavior
Behavioral effects were assessed with both Garcia’s Neuroscore,25
performed the day before surgery and at postoperative days 1, 7,
14, 21, and 28, and the more sensitive modified sticky label test
(mSLT),26 performed the day before surgery and at postoperative days
1, 3, 7, 11, 14, 18, 21, 25, and 28. See Methods in the online-only
Data Supplement for details.

Histopathology
Immunofluorescence was implemented using NeuN and IB4 antibodies to map neuronal loss and MA, respectively (Methods in the online-only Data Supplement). Quantitative assessment was performed
on the same set of 8 coronal sections described earlier, according to
procedures detailed in Methods in the online-only Data Supplement.
Briefly, on whole-brain immunofluorescence sections of the 6 rats
presented in random order and without knowledge of the affected
side, 2 experienced raters independently delineated using computer
mouse any areas with lack of NeuN immunoreactivity or increased
IB4 staining, and total lesion volume across the whole hemisphere,
to be referred to as Vol_total below, was computed for each side
separately.

Results
There was no instance of micro- or macro-infarcts, hemorrhage, SNL, or MA in the unaffected hemisphere in any subject of any group.

Part 1
Histopathology
28 Days Survival Group
There was no evidence of pan-necrosis or partial infarction in
the occluded hemisphere in any subject. However, patchy or
layer-wise cortical SNL was present at both low and high resolution in all 7 rats, not consistently involving a specific cortical layer. Typical for recent SNL,27 MA consistently matched
the areas of SNL, together with more diffuse astrocytosis on
GFAP (Figure 1).

These findings were confirmed by cell counting showing
similar regional pattern of SNL and MA involving the cortical
MCA territory and reaching statistical significance in several
ROIs (Figure IA and IB in the online-only Data Supplement).
Accordingly, there was a significant (P<0.01) negative correlation between NeuN and OX42 density changes across the
44 ROIs (Figure IC in the online-only Data Supplement). The
CellDens_Total values for NeuN and OX42 across the sample
(Figure 2A) were significantly reduced and increased, respectively, relative to the control side (P<0.0001 for both).

increased OX42 binding 28 days after 15 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). B and C, Same results for the 45 days and 60
days survival groups, respectively (n=3 per group), showing statistically significant NeuN loss and increased OX42 binding at both time
points. Note the essentially stable NeuN value relative to the markedly declining OX42 value over time.

Figure 3. Representative NeuN and OX42 ×10 sections, and 50× magnification of the dotted line boxes, from the same coronal level of
2 rats survived 45 (A) and 60 days (B) after 15 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). A corresponding 50× magnification GFAP
image is also shown on the right hand side. This figure illustrates the presence of selective neuronal loss (SNL) at both post-MCAo timepoints, hardly detectable at low magnification but evident at high magnification (stars). Microglial activation (MA) is even fainter at 45 days
but visible at high magnification within the SNL areas, together with mild astrocytosis. At 60 days, neither definite MA nor astrocytosis
were detectable even at high magnification.

45 and 60 Days Survival Groups
No instance of infarction was found in any rat. At 45 days, no
definite SNL, MA, or astrocytosis were identified at low magnification, though consistently present at high magnification.
In no rat survived 60 days could definite MA or astrocytosis
be identified even at high magnification, despite the presence
of a few small SNL patches in each rat (Figure 3).
Cell counting showed roughly similar NeuN reductions at
both 45 and 60 days, both ≈2-fold less prominent than at day
28, whereas OX42 values showed a sharp ≈6-fold decline from
day 28 to day 60 (Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement).
Accordingly, NeuN CellDens_Total values on the affected side
were highly significantly reduced at both time points (Figure 2B
and 2C). The corresponding OX42 values were also significantly increased at both time points, but marginally so for the
day 60 value. This is also illustrated in the scatterplots of NeuN
versus MA cell counts, showing as compared with day 28 a flattening of the OX42 values as opposed to persistently reduced
NeuN values over time, with their correlation losing statistical
significance (Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement).

Part 2

Seven and 14 Days Survival Group
Definite SNL and MA were present in all subjects for both
time points, adopting a regional distribution similar to that
observed in the day 28 group (see Figure IV in the online-only
Data Supplement for illustration). Because the aim of studying these earlier time points was to ensure that definite SNL
was already present, cell counting was not performed.

Behavioral Data
Garcia Neuroscore
No neurological deficit was present at any time point in any rat.

MRI
MRI angiography, obtained in 3 animals from the 28 days
group, consistently showed full recanalization. No DWI or
T2-weighted changes were visible either acutely or at followup in any subject (Figure 4). Quantitative data are presented in
the Table in the online-only Data Supplement.

Overall Assessment
Patchy or layer-wise NeuN staining loss was present on visual
inspection of the immunofluorescence sections in 5/6 rats, consistently matched by IB4 staining increases (Figure 5A and 5B).
No visually detectable MRI changes were present in any
subject either acutely or on day 14 (Figure 5C). Quantitative
data are presented in the Table in the online-only Data
Supplement.
Immunofluorescence Lesion Delineation
No rater delineated any lesion on the unaffected side. There
was an excellent agreement in lesion volumes between the 2
raters (kappa=0.57 and 0.667 for NeuN and IB4, respectively;
intraclass correlation coefficient P<0.0001).
Affected-hemisphere Vol_Total values for NeuN and IB4
(1.4±1.8 mm3 and 1.3±1.7 mm3 s, respectively) were significantly higher than on the unaffected side (P<0.05; Figure 6A)
and strongly intercorrelated (r=0.89, P<0.0001; data not
shown).

mSLT
As expected,26 at baseline, all animals spent almost the entire
observation period attending to the stimulus. After MCAo,
there was a marked and highly significant deficit (P<0.0001,
ANOVA), which on post hoc tests was significant for each
time point relative to baseline, but showed significant recovery
at last assessment (P=0.033; day 28 versus day 21; Figure 6B).
There was no significant correlation between peak deficit or
any time point mSLT data and either NeuN or IB4 Vol_Total
values across the 6 rats.

Illustrative MRI findings of the same coronal section in 1 rat from each survival group (ie, D7, D14, D28, D45, and D60), depicting diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) obtained at day 0 (A; ≈20min postrecanalization) and T2-weighted obtained just before perfusionfixation (B), showing no evident abnormalities. The slightly brighter signal on the right hand side of images is caused by slight field
inhomogeneity of the magnet used.

Discussion
Fifteen-minute distal MCAo in SHRs resulted in cortical SNL in 28/29 subjects, with no evidence of associated
infarction in any subject either on MRI or at postmortem performed as late as day 60. Because pure SNL was
already present at day 7, it does not represent a delayed
phenomenon; however, longitudinal studies would be
worth performing to determine the precise time course of
postischemic SNL. Consistent with the histopathologic
literature on SHR,21,22 there was no evidence in this study
of SNL or microinfarcts, nor of any MRI changes, in the
contralesional hemisphere, so the observed changes can
be confidently ascribed to the MCAo. However, SHRs are
known to develop brain vasculature changes secondary to
chronic hypertension that make them particularly susceptible to ischemic injury.17,18,21,22
Our model mimics true TIA not only as no MRI changes
were detected at any postreperfusion time point, but also
because neurological examination was normal throughout.
However, finer behavioral tests disclosed significant sensorimotor dysfunction still incompletely recovered at 4 weeks.
Finally, MA was consistently associated with SNL, although
declined over time, and represents another salient consequence of brief focal ischemia.

Rodent TIA Model
Striatal SNL after proximal tMCAo has been extensively
reported.27 Across studies, striatal SNL—occasionally
associated with mild cortical SNL—regularly follows
≤20 min MCAo in the rat, whereas longer occlusions

consistently cause striatal infarcts.27 Two previous articles
only have been published as rodent models of TIA.28,29 In
one,29 striatal and occasional cortical microinfarcts were
present 24–72 hours after 5 to 10 minutes proximal MCAo
in Sprague–Dawley rats, but the definition used for microinfarcts is questionable because key criteria to distinguish
pan-necrosis from SNL, such as coagulation necrosis, astrocytosis, and MA, may not develop that early. Additionally,
this outcome was present in 9/32 subjects only, and neither
MRI nor behavior were assessed. In the other study,28 mice
subjected to proximal MCAo lasting 5 to 12.5 mins consistently exhibited cortical selective neuronal necrosis on
H&E performed at 24–72 hours together with normal MRI
and Neuroscore. However, postmortem assessment was
again too early, whereas neither quantitative immunohistochemistry nor finer behavioral tests were performed. The
latter have to date been reported in a single study where rats
subjected to 20 min proximal MCAo showed impaired SLT
performance followed by full recovery occurring between
days 7 and 21, associated with normal MRI but striatal
selective neuronal necrosis and milder cortical selective
neuronal necrosis at postmortem.8
Although the above reports are useful as models of TIAs
resulting from proximal MCA occlusion, they do not model
cortical TIAs, and more generally, cortical SNL is never
extensive following proximal MCAo unless striatal infarction
also occurs.27 Using 45 min distal MCAo in SHRs, isolated
cortical SNL was present in a subset of rats but the majority showed clear infarcts,14,15 indicating this duration is inadequate for a consistent outcome. Brief distal MCAo was
previously assessed in a study on Wistar rats focusing on

(MCA) territory, assessed 28 days after 15 min distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) using multicolor fluorescence microscopy

images on the right hand side image in B). The images in C are similar-level diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI; day 0; left) and T2-weighted

recurrent ischemic insults.13 A single 40 min MCAo episode
caused mild selective neuronal necrosis on H&E and normal
MRI on day 7, but without significant SNL or MA on immunohistochemistry. In addition, outcome consistency was not
reported, nor behavior assessed.
In the present study, visual identification of SNL was
increasingly difficult as time elapsed, paralleled by an ≈2fold smaller cell loss at 60 as compared with 28 days. Chance
finding as a result of small samples rather than delayed tissue
collapse likely explains this observation because cell counting was performed in whole symmetrical ROIs. However,
even though neuronal repopulation is elusive after cortical
infarcts,30 migrating neuroblasts might have penetrated SNL
patches given the sparse glial scar.

Behavioral Effects
The unaltered Neuroscore in our study is consistent with
the absence of infarction, which induces clear Neuroscore
deficits in SHRs,31 whereas the markedly impaired mSLT
matches SNL predominantly involving S1/2. Deficits on
SLT are thought to reflect a mix of hemi-sensory neglect

and extinction, forepaw motor deficit, and impaired somatosensory integration (Methods in the online-only Data
Supplement). Among several tests, only the SLT was affected
in mice subjected to permanent distal MCAo.32 Sensorimotor
deficits after proximal MCAo more specifically reflect cortical relative to striatal damage.12 This differential effect probably explains why in Sicard’s 20 min proximal MCAo study,8
where only marginal cortical SNL was present, impaired SLT
had fully recovered before day 21, as compared with still
recovering at day 28 here.
Although a sham group was not included, young adult
SHRs are not known to develop sensorimotor impairment over time,33,34 whereas longitudinally assessed mSLT
performance does not show habituation in sham rats.26
Furthermore, the time course of changes does not fit with
an MCAo-unrelated spontaneous decline as the day 28 score
showed significant recovery relative to previous time point.
Nevertheless, SHRs do develop histopathologic and behavioral stigmata of accelerated brain aging over time,21,35 which
could have contributed to the behavioral effects of MCAo by
reducing the brain reserve.

1090  Stroke  April 2015
injury, might exacerbate SNL.36 However, intervention studies to date have been largely inconclusive, which may be as a
result of the confounding prorepair effects of MA.36 Detailed
longitudinal studies in our model might help clarify these
complex inter-relationships.

MRI Correlates

Consistent with all previous reports,8,9,13,14,37 SNL and MA
were not associated with any visually detectable DWI
lesions or infarct-type T2-weighted hyperintense lesions
on early postreperfusion and follow-up MRI, respectively.
Ancillary analysis confirmed the lack of significant acute
DWI or follow-up T2 signal changes; interestingly, however,
there was a small (≈5%) but significant acute-stage apparent diffusion coefficient reduction (Table in the online-only
Data Supplement), probably as a residual of the preceding
severe cortical ischemia. Our model therefore effectively
mimics true TIA, which is defined by lack of corresponding
lesion on early and delayed standard diffusion and FLAIR
sequences.2 As we designed our study to match these criteria, we cannot exclude that cortical SNL might be detectable on specific MRI sequences or as transient changes
on standard sequences. For instance, in one study, striatal
T2 hypersignal was present 24 hours and 1 and 2 weeks
after 60 min proximal MCAo in Wistar rats, but had vanished at week 10,37 though reflected severe, near complete
SNL as opposed to mild cortical SNL here. Of note, the
T2-weighted sequence used here has been previously shown
to clearly depict pathologically proven cortical infarcts.14

Clinical Implications

the summed volume of all manually contoured regions-of-interest
[ROIs] across the 8 selected coronal sections, see Methods) for

higher than on the unaffected side (paired t test, P<0.05 for
both). B, Modified sticky label test (mSLT) contralateral forepaw
performance (mean and SEM, n=6 rats). mSLT performance was
expressed as a ratio of the time attending to the tape within the
observation period/30 s. Accordingly, a higher ratio indicates better performance. Fifteen-minutes middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAo) induced a marked sensorimotor deficit that tended to
recover over time but was still significant at the 28-day time point
(Time effect: F(4,20)=11.4, P<0.0001, 1-way repeated measures
analysis of variance; post hoc tests for each time point relative to
baseline: P=0.023, 0.006, 0.005, 0.004 for weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4,
respectively).

Inflammation
Using OX42, a monoclonal antibody to CD11b strongly
expressed by activated microglia/macrophages, inflammation was found to be consistently associated and topographically congruent with SNL, though declined over time and was
barely detectable at day 60, consistent with literature.27 That
MA is consistently associated with SNL is well established.
Strong topographical congruence and quantitative correlation
between SNL and MA have been previously reported on both
days 14 and 28 after distal tMCAo in SHRs.14,15 It is therefore
plausible that MA, which is initially triggered by neuronal

Our findings have clinical relevance. First, that DWI-negative
TIAs may involve hidden cortical damage points to potential
long-term, equally hidden consequences on brain functions,
especially in case of multiple TIAs. Thus, similar to our findings, subtle cognitive impairment not apparent with standard
neurological scales and lasting days to weeks have been
documented after TIAs.3–5 The high frequency of both multiple silent DWI lesions38 and equally silent microemboli39 in
this population might lead to extensive cortical SNL, even in
case of single clinical TIA, in turn affecting the brain’s plastic
reserve and potentially contributing to worse deficits/recovery in case of stroke, as well as vascular cognitive impairment
and old-age dementia in association with Alzheimer pathology.27 Accordingly, TIAs are known to be associated with an
increased long-term risk of cognitive decline and dementia.3,4
Independent from or in addition to this classic diminished
reserve mechanism, neuronal death might also directly trigger
aβ deposition and facilitate Alzheimer pathology,40,41 an effect
possibly enhanced in SHRs given their naturally occurring
accelerated brain aging. Thus, SNL and MA might represent
therapeutic targets in patients with TIAs. Second, given the
neuronal damage, the original TIA symptoms might resurface under psychological or pharmacological stress disrupting
local reorganization.42 Finally, relevant to both diagnosis and
research, both cortical SNL and MA could be readily detectable after clinically unclear transient focal neurological event
using specific positron emission tomography ligands.6,7

1. Supplemental Methods
1. 1. Procedures common to Parts 1 and 2
tMCAo duration
Although the optimal distal MCAo duration to reliably obtain pure cortical SNL in
SHRs is unknown, the available literature using proximal MCAo in Sprague-Dawley rats
indicates that occlusion times between 15 and 30 minutes regularly induce striatal SNL, with
cortical SNL occasionally present as well (see Baron et al1 for review). In two previous studies,
45min distal tMCAo in SHRs induced pure cortical SNL in less than half the subjects, and
infarcts in the rest2, 3. Considering the above data and following preliminary experiments using
30 and 22min MCAo, we finally elected a 15min occlusion time.
MRI
Part 1: MRI was acquired whenever feasible immediately following reperfusion
(~20min after clip removal; minimum time required to clean and seal the wound then position
the animal inside the bore), and again systematically several days later. Anesthesia used 1.5%
isoflurane in 0.3 l/min O2 and 0.7 l/min N2O mix. Body temperature was kept at 37 ± 1°C with
an integrated heating system, and a pressure probe to monitor the respiration. Images were
acquired using a 4.7T Bruker BioSpec 47/40 system (Bruker, BioSpin GmbH, Ettlingen,
Germany) with a 2cm surface coil used for signal reception. Structural imaging was performed
with a T2-weighted RARE sequence (TR/TE 3500/36ms, ETL 8, slice thickness 1mm, in plane
resolution 0.156mm). Diffusion weighted images (DWI) were acquired using an EPI sequence
(TR/TE 3000/35ms, 35 directions b = 1000s/mm2, slice thickness 1.5mm, in plane resolution
0.312mm). In addition, standard MRA of the circle of Willis was performed in a subset of rats
to confirm consistency of MCA recanalization with this model. It was performed with a fast
low-angle shot sequence with flow compensation (TR/TE 12/3ms using two averages covering
a field of view of 40mm with a matrix of 256 yielding a planar resolution of 156µm in 64 slices
of 0.7mm with an overlap of 0.15mm between consecutive slices).
In Part 2, MRI was systematically acquired both ~20min following reperfusion and just
before killing at 14 days. The same sequences as in Part 1 were acquired, save for MRA.
MRI data analysis
The aim of our study was to model the clinical situation of ‘true’ TIA where standard
clinical MR images are read visually. Accordingly, hyperintense lesions were assessed visually
on the immediate post-reperfusion DWI images as markers of severe ischemia, and more
importantly hyperintense lesions on the follow-up T2-weighted images were sought as markers
of infarction. We have previously reported using exactly the same acquisition parameters that
our T2-weighted sequence is highly sensitive to histopathological infarcts following distal
MCAo in SHRs2. For the sake of completeness, and even though looking for MR markers of
SNL and MA was outside the aim of this study and MR data acquisition was not optimized for
quantitative assessment, we additionally obtained quantitative data for acute DWI and followup T2-weighted images. Given the patchy nature of SNL and MA as identified on very thin
brain sections as compared to the spatial resolution of MRI, and the lack of validated software
to co-register these two image modalities in 3D, we opted for a systematic assessment of the
MR data within identical cortical areas across all subjects. To this end, we used the DARTEL
image registration tool of SPM8 (Wellcome Trust Institute for Neurology, UCL, London)
adapted with the SPMMouse toolbox4. Default values calculated for the rat brain by the toolbox
1

were used for the image segmentation required for DARTEL and correction for receiver coil
inhomogeneity. The primary and secondary somatosensory cortex are the areas most targeted
by our distal MCAo model3, and were mapped on the mean template image produced by
DARTEL based on our previously published cytoarchitectonic ROI template3, and used to
extract signal values from acute DWI and follow up T2 on both sides of the brain. A paired ttest on the left-right percent signal difference was then used to assess statistical significance.
For completeness, the same ROI analysis method was applied on the apparent diffusion
coefficient (ADC) images obtained acutely.
Perfusion-fixation and brain cryosectioning
The experimental protocol was terminated by intraperitoneal injection (30mg/100g) of
sodium pentobarbitone, as detailed previously2, 3. Brains were post fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde overnight (4°C) and then immersed into 30% sucrose solution (0.1 M PB,
pH 7.4) for at least 3–4 days for cryoprotection. Cryosectining was carried out across the MCA
territory, from the level of the forceps minor to the superior colliculi (Bregma 3.7 to -6.80mm)
as detailed previously.
Visual assessment of ischemic lesions
Ischemic lesions were classified into three main subtypes2, namely: i) pan-necrosis
(tissue necrosis with absence of neurons, microglia and astrocytes; dissolved extracellular
matrix; presence of cavitations and tissue loss); ii) partial infarction (same as pan-necrosis but
only mild volume loss, relatively preserved extracellular matrix, no or few small cavitations,
presence of dense activated microglia and elongated astrocytes); and iii) SNL (patchy loss of
neurons with preserved tissue structure and presence of activated microglia (i.e., adopting
spherical morphology) and elongated astrocytes matching SNL).
1.2. Part 1 specific procedures
Quantitative assessment of ischemic changes
For each animal, eight coronal stained sections spanning the MCA territory (bregma:
+2.70, +1.00, -0.26, -0.92, -2.12, -3.14, -4.52, and -6.04 mm) were selected and were digitized
as described previously2, 3, 5. Quantitative data describing the regional distribution and severity
of IHC changes were obtained in a set of pre-specified symmetrical cytoarchitectonic ROIs
derived from Paxinos and Watson’s stereotaxic atlas of the rat brain6 applied to each captured
section, as described previously3. This ROI template covered the MCA territory and comprised
44 cytoarchitectonically-defined ROIs, including 39 cortical, 4 caudate/putamen and one
thalamus ROIs. The resulting digitized maps (x1.6) of individual animals at corresponding
coronal levels were mapped onto this template using Adobe Photoshop as detailed previously2,
3, 5
.
The precise methodology used for cell counting has been described elsewhere7. Briefly,
using Photoshop CS software (Adobe, CA, USA) each ROI was contrast-enhanced using the
Auto Contrast command and background noise was reduced using Unsharp-Mask, Despeckle,
and High-Pass filters. ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA) batch
processing was used to create binary images based on threshold values determined with the
Auto Threshold command. Finally, the ImageJ Watershed algorithm was applied to separate
overlapping cells, and cell numbers for each ROI were quantified based on average (± 1SD)
values for size and circularity using the Particle Analysis command for neuronal and microglial
cells, respectively.

2

For descriptive purposes, statistical significance for each ROI was tested by paired t-test
comparing cell numbers on the affected vs unaffected side across the sample of rats. In addition,
for each rat a whole hemisphere average neuronal loss or microglial activation, to be referred
to as CellDens_Total, was calculated as the weighted mean percentage (normalized by the area
of the ROI) across all 44 ROIs for NeuN and OX42, respectively. Again, statistical significance
within each group was tested by paired t-test. Two-tailed p<0.05 was considered significant.
1.3.Part 2 specific procedures
Behavioral assessment
Animals were single-housed on a 12-hour light/dark cycle and had free access to water
and standard rodent chow. Training/testing was performed in the light phase and animals were
left in their housing cages during sessions. Animals received daily handling for at least 4 days
before baseline testing to ensure accurate behavioural results. The modified sticky label test
(mSLT) was performed one day before surgery and postoperatively animals were tested at
days 1, 3, 7, 11, 14, 18, 21, 25, and 28. Neurological examination was carried out the day
before surgery and at postoperative days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 using Garcia’s Neuroscore.
Garcia’s Neuroscore consists of motor, sensory, reflex, and observational tests to
evaluate neurological deﬁcits following MCAo in rats8. It is scored on a scale from 3 to 18
(normal: 18; maximal deficit: 3), i.e. the lower the score the worse the deficit.
mSLT: Subtle sensorimotor dysfunction following MCAo was assessed using the mSLT
as previously described9, 10. This test is consistently sensitive to subtle ischemic damage even
when the Neuroscore is normal11, 12 and, contrary to the standard version, uses a non-removable
tape. As a result, non-stroked rats spend most of the 30s sessions trying to remove it, with no
habituation effect over time9, 10. A small patch of paper tape (2.5cm long, 1.0 cm wide) was
wrapped around the animal’s wrist contralateral to the ischemic insult such that the tape sticks
to itself and that the fingers protrude from the sleeve formed. The rat is placed into its home
cage and the time spent attending to the stimulus be it using the teeth or contralateral paw is
recorded. Animals are given five sessions per day, each observation period lasting for a
maximum of 30s. After each trial the tape is removed and animals are given a resting time of
≥3mins. mSLT performance is calculated by dividing the time attending to the stimulus by 30s,
expressing the fraction of the observation period that the animal spends attending to the tape.
The best two ratios on each day are averaged. In order to reduce noise, all daily time-points for
each week were collapsed into a single value. The results of the final day of pre-surgery training
served as baseline for assessment of post-MCAo performance. Following stroke, sensorimotor
deficits make the rat spend less time attending to the tape than normally11. Deficits on the SLT
are thought to reflect a mix of subtle sensorimotor impairments including hemi-sensory neglect
and extinction, forepaw motor deficit and impaired somatosensory integration9, 11, 13, 14.
Using SPSS (version 15, SPSS Inc.), the mSLT data were assessed for a main effect of
Time (within-subject factor) using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). If
applicable, post-hoc multiple comparisons were then conducted using Holm-Bonferroni
corrected t-tests to determine differences between performance at each post-stroke time-point
and baseline. Results were considered to be statistically significant if 2-tailed p < 0.05.
Immunofluorescence (IF)
IF was implemented using anti-NeuN and anti-IB4 antibodies to map neuronal loss and
microglial activation, respectively. Free-floating sections were incubated for 2hrs at room
temperature in PBS plus 5% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100. Sections were
incubated with anti-NeuN antibody (Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents, 1:500) and
Alexa Fluor 488-labeled isolectin-B4 (Sigma, 1:500) overnight, 4°C, washed, and incubated
3

with goat anti-mouse-Cy3 antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:150) for 2 hrs at room
temperature. Sections were washed, mounted on gelatine-coated slides, dried for 15 minutes on
a heating block (40°C) and coverslipped using FluorSave reagent (Calbiochem).
Quantitative assessment of ischemic lesions
Assessment of ischemic changes was carried out on the same set of eight coronal
sections spanning the MCA territory detailed above. Stained sections were captured via wholeslide scanning on an Ariol SL-50 automated scan station (Applied Imaging, Santa Clara, USA)
using an Olympus BX61 microscope at 20x magniﬁcation. Composite images depicting whole
brain sections were stitched automatically from individual frames and digitized. Then, without
knowledge of the affected side, two experienced raters (SE and JCB) independently delineated
using the computer mouse any area with lack of NeuN immunoreactivity or increased IB4
staining. The whole-brain scans of the six rats were presented in random order on a highresolution monitor screen. The cross-sectional surface area encompassed within the traced
regions on each section was then measured using ImageJ software. Whole lesion volume across
adjacent sections was estimated using the planimetric Cavalieri method (area of region of
interest x 1/2 x mean slice thickness or area of region of interest x mean slice thickness for one
or more than one neighbouring sections affected by immunohistochemical changes,
respectively)15. For each rat, the total volume across all ROIs, to be referred to as Vol_total,
was then calculated.
Cohen’s kappa was used to determine inter-rater reliability of manual lesion contouring.
Then, differences in Vol_Total between ipsi- and contralesional sides were assessed using
Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Pearson’s linear correlation was used to assess the relationships
between NeuN and IB4 volumes, while the relationship between peak behavioral deficit and
Vol_Total was assessed using Kendall’s Tau correlation. 2-tailed p < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

coronal sections used for the quantification (see3, 16 for details). (C): Relationship between NeuN and OX42
relative cell density changes across the 44 ROIs, demonstrating a significant negative correlation (Kendall tau= 0.338, p < 0.01), such that greater MA was associated with increasing SNL.

Supplemental Figure II: Mean (± SEM) NeuN and OX42 relative cell density values for
each of the 44 ROIs, for the rats survived 45 days (A and B) and 60 days (C and D)(n = 3 per
group). Same layout and codes as in Supplemental Figure I. This figure illustrates the
persistently reduced NeuN densities at these two late time-points, although overall to a lesser
degree than at day 28 (Fig. 2), while the OX42 changes markedly decreased over time from
28 to 45 to 60 days. As a consequence, the topographical matching of NeuN and OX42
disappeared over time.

Supplemental Figure III: Relationship between NeuN and OX42 relative cell density changes
across the 44 ROIs, plotted for the 45 days (A) and 60 days (B) survival groups, demonstrating
a gradual loss of the relationship between SNL and MA over time largely due to OX42 values
markedly decreasing over time, as compared to Day 28 (Suppl. Fig. 2). Neither of these two
correlations was statistically significant.

two rats allowed to survive 7 days (top row) and 14 days (bottom row) following 15min distal
MCAo. For each immunostain, the images on the left are x10 magnification, and the higher
magnification of the boxes at x50 magnification. Topographically congruent cortical SNL
(stars) and MA (arrows) were present in both subjects. The red arrowheads point to the surgical
area.
