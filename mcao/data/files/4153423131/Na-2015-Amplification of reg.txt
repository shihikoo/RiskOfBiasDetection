Background and Purpose—Neuroinflammation plays an important role in ischemic brain injury. Regulatory T cells
(Treg) are important endogenous immune modulators. We tested the hypothesis that Treg amplification with a CD28
superagonistic monoclonal antibody (CD28SA) reduces brain damage in murine cerebral ischemia.
Methods—Cerebral ischemia was induced by coagulation of the distal middle cerebral artery or by 60 minutes filament
occlusion of the proximal middle cerebral artery in C57BL6 mice. 150 μg CD28SA was injected intraperitoneally 3 or
6 hours after ischemia onset. Outcome was determined by infarct volumetry and behavioral testing. Brain-infiltrating
leukocyte subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry 3 and 7 days after middle cerebral
artery occlusion.
Results—CD28SA reduced infarct size in both models and attenuated functional deficit 7 days after stroke induction. Mice
treated with CD28SA increased numbers of Treg in spleen and brain. Tregs were functionally active and migrated into the
brain where they accumulated and proliferated in the peri-infarct area. More than 60% of brain infiltrating Treg produced
interleukin-10 in CD28SA compared with 30% in control.
Conclusions—In vivo expansion and amplification of Treg by CD28SA attenuates the inflammatory response and improves
outcome after experimental stroke.   (Stroke. 2015;46:212-220. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.007756.)

regulatory T cells

Treg cells consistently worsens outcome in models of moderate cerebral ischemia, suggesting an endogenous neuroprotective mechanism of Treg.7 In contrast, we and others
found no effect of Treg if cerebral infarction was extensive,8,9 and 1 study even reported an early deleterious effect
of Treg.6
In view of the protective role of endogenous Treg in cerebral
ischemia, amplification of this cell population and its effector mechanisms may be a promising therapeutic approach.
Compared with direct adoptive Treg cell transfer, which is
technically demanding and time consuming,10,11 pharmacological amplification of endogenous Treg may be more feasible in acute stroke.11,12 The superagonistic CD28 monoclonal
antibody (CD28SA) activates T cells without T cell receptor
engagement.13,14 Application of CD28SA in vivo effectively
expands and potently activates polyclonal Treg.13 In a variety of disease models, CD28SA reduced autoimmune reactions,15–17 graft rejection,18 and inflammation.19

ost-ischemic neuroinflammation is viewed as a promising
target in ischemic stroke because inflammatory mechanisms contribute substantially to secondary brain damage.1–3
The postischemic inflammatory response includes mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity.1 Innate immune cells,
such as microglia and macrophages, are activated and secrete
proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1 and
tumor necrosis factor-α.1 Moreover, a prominent deleterious
role of proinflammatory T lymphocytes and other adaptive
immune cells has been identified.2,4
An overshooting inflammatory response is contained by
regulatory mechanisms after brain ischemia. Regulatory T
cells (Treg) play an important role in suppressing inflammatory responses and maintaining immune homeostasis in
health and disease.5 Their main effector mechanism is the
secretion of IL-10, transforming growth factor-β, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4. However, the role of Treg in
stroke is controversial.6–8 We have shown that depletion of

Animals

Experimental Stroke Models

All experiments were performed according to national guidelines and
to the ARRIVE guidelines20 and were approved by the governmental authorities (Regierungspraesidium Karlsruhe, Germany). Agematched 8- to 12-weeks-old male mice (C57BL/6J; Charles River
Laboratories) were used for the experiments. IL-10 knockout mice
were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice were kept in the
pathogen-free animal facility of the University of Heidelberg. Two
mice died after filament middle cerebral artery occlusion (fMCAO)
and 4 mice died after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
(pMCAO) from CD28SA- and IgG control antibody–treated group.

Leukocyte Isolation From Brain and Flow
Cytometry Analysis
Mice were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with saline. Brain
hemispheres were mechanically homogenized. The cell suspension
was incubated in dissociation buffer (180 U collagenase IV and
250 U DNase in PBS) and overlaid on percoll gradients of 1.03 and
1.088 g/mL density. A single layer of leukocytes was collected from
the interphase and analyzed by flow cytometry (online-only Data

Immunohistochemical staining was performed on 12 μm-thick coronal cryosections taken at the level of the bregma. Slides were fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde. Sections were incubated with anti-Foxp3
(FJK-16s) followed by antirat IgG-biotinylated secondary antibody
(Vector). Immunoreactivity was visualized by the avidin–biotin complex method (Vector), and sections were developed in diaminobenzidine (Vector) and mounted on coverslips. We captured images on a
Zeiss Axiovert 200 mol/L microscope.

Statistical Analysis
Analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad
Software). Bar graphs are represented as mean± SD. Numbers of animals (n=9) to detect infarct size were determined via a priori calculation (effect size ƒ [by ANOVA] of 0.6 with α<0.05 and a power of
0.80) according to previous results.7

Differences between groups were determined using a 2-tailed
Student’s t tests and ANOVA for multiple comparisons with post hoc
Tukey’s test after validating the normal distribution of these data sets
by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Corner and cylinder test results were
analyzed using 2-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test. A P value <0.05 was
regarded statistically significant.

Results
CD28SA Treatment Causes Treg Expansion After
Cerebral Ischemia
First, we examined whether CD28SA expands Treg after cerebral ischemia. CD28SA was injected 3 hours after pMCAO,
and splenocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry 7 days later.
CD28SA antibody increased Treg in spleen by 4-fold compared with control. Because polyclonal Treg expansion after
CD28SA induces homing markers and migration to inflamed
sites,23 we also analyzed the expression of the tissue homing marker CD10324,25 in splenic Treg. We observed a 3-fold
increase of the percentage of CD103 expressing Treg compared with control mice (Figure 1A and 1B). Kinetic analysis
revealed that expansion of Treg was present already 3 days
after CD28SA administration (Figure 1C).
Sera from isotype control or different doses (50, 150, and
300 μg) of CD28SA-treated mice were analyzed for the
presence of circulating IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and
IL-10 at 1, 3, and 7 days after pMCAO (Figure 1D). One day
after treatment, we could hardly detect any cytokine expression after CD28SA treatment. At 3 days after pMCAO, we

detected a significant upregulation of IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α
in the 300 μg CD28SA group. However, the mean amount of
IL6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α (15, 7, and 18 pg/mL, respectively)
found in the serum was rather low. In our present study, circulating IL-10 serum levels were significantly increased in the
150 and 300 μg CD28SA groups, which presumably resulted
from expansion of Treg cells. At day 7 after CD28SA treatment, the expression of cytokines had returned to baseline
compared with control.

CD28SA Reduces Infarct Size

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

Administration of CD28SA 3 hours after pMCAO significantly reduced infarct volume at day 7 compared with isotype control–treated mice (Figure 2A). CD28SA treatment
also improved behavioral outcome compared with the control
group 7 days after pMCAO as determined by the corner test
and the cylinder test (Figure 2B). CD28SA did not affect mortality in this model (2 mice in CD28SA and 2 mice in IgG).
To describe the kinetics of the effect of CD28SA in more
detail, infarct volumes were measured at 1, 3, and 7 days after
pMCAO in separate experiments with different doses (50,
150, 300 μg) of CD28SA. Infarct volumes did not differ at 1
day after pMCAO (data not shown), whereas CD28SA-treated
mice had a significantly smaller infarct size in 150 g- and
300 μg-treated mice 3 days (Figure 2C, left) and 7 days after
pMCAO (Figure 2C, right).
To examine a potentially longer therapeutic time window, CD28SA was injected 6 hours after pMCAO treatment. CD28SA still reduced infarct size 7 days after pMCAO
(Figure 2D).
To validate the beneficial effect of CD28SA in another
experimental model of cerebral ischemia, transient MCAO
was induced for 60 minutes using an endovascular filament.
The mortality in this model was 5% in both groups. In accordance with previous reports,26 we observed a significantly
decreased absolute cell number of total CD4+CD3+ T cells in
the spleen in both CD28SA- and isotype-treated control mice
3 days after MCAO in this stroke model, which causes substantially larger infarcts (Figure 3A and 3B). However, after
CD28SA treatment, absolute Foxp3+ Treg splenic cell counts
as well as their percentage within the CD4+ T cell population
were significantly increased compared with the control group
(Figure 3A and 3B). Infarct volume was significantly reduced
in CD28SA-treated mice compared with control 3 days after
fMCAO (Figure 3C).

Tregs in the Peri-Infarct Area Are Increased by
CD28SA
To determine the effect of CD28SA on brain-infiltration of
Foxp3+ Treg after stroke, mice were treated with CD28SA
or isotype antibody, and 7 days after pMCAO, leukocytes
were isolated from the brain and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were gated as CD45high to distinguish infiltrating
leukocytes from microglia.9 T-lymphocytes were subdivided
into CD3+CD4+ subsets, and Treg cells were identified by
expression of Foxp3 (Figure 4A and 4B). Although the
absolute cell number of CD3+ T cells was not affected in
both groups, the number of Treg was significantly higher

in brains of CD28SA-treated mice compared with controls
(Figure 4C). The proliferation of Treg cells was specified
by expression of Ki-67 (Figure 4A). In isotype-treated
mice, Foxp3+ Treg cells represented 23%±7.4% of CD4+
T cells, and 72%±8.3% of Treg cells were proliferating. In
CD28SA-treated mice, 60%±2.3% of CD4+ T cells in the
brain were Foxp3+. Moreover, 92%±2.4% of Foxp3+ Treg
were Ki-67+, indicating that the vast majority of Treg in
the ischemic brain was proliferating and thereby supporting Treg activation on CD28SA stimulation (Figure 4B). To
investigate the topographical distribution of Foxp3+ Treg
in the ischemic brain, cryosections of brain from CD28SA
and control mice were stained for Foxp3. Treg were
located mainly in the peri-infarct area of ischemic brains
in both groups. The number of Foxp3+ Treg was substantially higher in CD28SA-treated mice (69±8/section; n=4;
P<0.05, t test) compared with control mice (24±4.7/section;
n=4; Figure 4D).

cells after ischemia, we analyzed the activation state
of brain infiltrating macrophages by flow cytometry

7 days after pMCAO. Similar to previous publications,9,27
we used the expression of CD45 to distinguish between
CD11b+ microglia, expressing only a low level of CD45,
and CD11b+ macrophages/dendritic cells, expressing high
levels of CD45 after ischemic stroke. To exclude dendritic
cells, CD11b+CD11c− cells were gated and the activation of macrophages was determined by the expression of
MHCII (Figure 5A). The expression of MHCII on macrophages was reduced in CD28SA-treated mice compared with
control mice (Figure 5B, left). In contrast, MHCII expression on CD45low microglial cells was similar in both groups
(Figure 5B, right). Additionally, we also analyzed the infiltration and activation of granulocytes using Ly6G as marker
and observed that the percentage of Ly6G and also mean
fluorescence intensity of the activation marker CD11b was
not altered by CD28SA treatment (Figure 5C).

Brain Invading Treg Produce More Interleukin-10
After CD28SA Treatment
To investigate the functional activity of brain infiltrating
Treg, isolated leukocytes from pMCAO mice were stained
for IL-10 expression and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Consistent with previous reports showing that CD28SA
induces IL-10 production in Treg in the periphery, 23 we
observed a significant increase of the proportion of IL-10
producing Treg in the brain after pMCAO (Figure 6A).
The main source of IL-10-producing cells within the
CD4+ T cells in the brain was Foxp3+Treg (Figure 6A).
After CD28 treatment, 61%±2.7% of Foxp3+ Treg produced IL-10 compared with 33%±4% in control, suggesting that Treg in the brain were functional and highly
activated (Figure 6A). We also analyzed IFN-γ and TNF-α
expression in brain infiltrating cells. In CD28SA-treated
mice, the expression of IFN-γ was reduced significantly
in CD4 cells compared with control mice. TNF-α experession was lower in CD4 T cells and infiltrating macropages
(Figure 6B and 6C).
To further investigate the effect of IL-10 in CD28SA treatment, IL-10 knockout mice were treated with isotype antibody or CD28SA following pMCAO. Although Treg cells
expanded in IL-10 knockout mice after CD28SA (Figure 6D,
left), infarct size did not differ (Figure 6D, right). Clearly, this
supports an essential role of IL-10 for the effect of CD28SA
in this model.

Discussion
The present study yields 5 new findings: (1) injection of
CD28SA induces a strong expansion of Treg in the periphery
after cerebral ischemia; (2) treatment with CD28SA within 6
hours after ischemia onset improves outcome and (3) leads to
increased brain immigration of Treg after cerebral ischemia;
(4) CD28SA treatment increases IL-10 production by Treg;
and (5) in mice treated with CD28SA, macrophages in the
brain seem to be less activated.
Previous work from our group suggested that endogenous
Treg suppress postischemic neuroinflammation and thereby
prevent delayed brain infarct growth. This finding was originally made in an experimental paradigm using depletion of
Treg cells by CD25 antibody as well as in adoptive lymphocyte transfer without Treg into lymphocyte-deficient Rag2
knockout mice.7 More recently, we also depleted Treg in transgenic mice expressing the diphtheria toxin receptor under the
FoxP3 promoter using diphtheria toxin, confirming our previous findings.11 The increase of infarct volume in Treg-depleted
mice was attributed to an exacerbation of the neuroinflammatory response, which was recently confirmed.12 These findings
were made in models causing moderately extensive infarcts
(ie, 30 fMCAO or distal pMCAO). On the other hand, although
we and other investigators did not find a negative effect of
Treg depletion after extensive cerebral ischemia, Kleinschnitz

and coworkers reported a deleterious effect of Treg after prolonged fMCAO.6–8 The reason for the discrepancy of the Treg
effects among models is not resolved,6,7 but may be related
to the different intensity of the inflammatory response in the
brain in different ischemia models.28
The putatively protective effect of endogenous Treg in
experimental stroke has prompted the exploration of the question whether therapeutic augmentation of Tregs may represent a promising strategy to protect the ischemic brain. Hu
and coworkers reported that adoptive transfer of CD4CD25+
Treg improved infarct volume and long-term behavioral outcome.10 However, adoptive cell transfer of autologous Treg is
hardly a viable strategy for patients in the hyperacute stroke
phase. Alternatively, pharmacological amplification of Treg
may be more feasible from a translational perspective. Using
a paradigm of Treg amplification with histone decarboxylase
inhibitors introduced by Hancock and colleagues,29 we found
a beneficial effect of boosting endogenous Treg.11 However,
treatment had to be initiated before ischemia onset to be effective. In the present study, we tested a more powerful and less
pleiotropic approach of boosting Treg compared with histone
deacetylase inhibition–stimulation with the CD28SA. Similar
to previous studies in healthy mice13 and various disease
models,15–19 CD28SA substantially increased the number
of Treg in the periphery as well as in the brain. CD28SA

treatment had a protective effect as measured by infarct size
as well as by sensory-motor deficit. Moreover, the time window of ≥3 to 6 hours after ischemia onset supports potential
therapeutic relevance, whereas histone deacetylase inhibition
in our previous study had to be administered before ischemia
onset to be effective.11 Importantly, the protective effect of
CD28SA was robust across 2 experimental models of cerebral
ischemia in our present study. Similar to several earlier studies
addressing adaptive immunologic mechanisms,2,7 the effect of
CD28SA was not evident 24 hours after MCAO, but became
apparent 3 to 7 days after ischemia onset, suggesting interference with delayed mechanisms of brain damage.
The present findings are consistent with previously identified mechanisms of action of Treg in cerebral ischemia. Treg

invade the brain and accumulate in the infarct border zone
where they proliferate.7,9 This accumulation of Treg was augmented by CD28SA. Moreover, 90% of Treg expressed Ki-67,
indicating that most Treg cells were activated and proliferating. CD28SA also boosted the in vivo and in vitro production
of IL-10, a key mediator of Treg in various conditions, including brain ischemia.7,11,23 After CD28SA treatment in the present study, Treg cells were strongly activated and represented an
impressive proportion of all IL-10-producing suppressor cells.
This is in accordance with observations in other inflammatory
disease models where CD28SA treatment boosted the number
of IL-10-producing Treg that migrate into inflamed skin tissue
to limit the inflammatory milieu.23 Indeed, we found a drastic
increase of IL-10-producing Treg not only in the peripheral

Na et al   CD28SA Treatment in Ischemic Stroke    219

immune system but even more pronounced in the ischemic
hemisphere. About 30% of brain-infiltrating Treg produced
IL-10 in isotype-treated ischemic animals, which exceeds the
percentage of IL-10-producing splenic Treg in the periphery.
We also observed less activated macrophages in the brain after
CD28SA, which corresponds to our previous finding that Treg
affect neuroinflammation even before invading the brain.7
The primary aim of our study using CD28SA was to provide a proof of principle that augmentation of Treg is beneficial in experimental ischemic stroke. Any consideration of
translation to the treatment of stroke patients must take previous severe adverse effects of a human CD28SA antibody
in healthy subjects into account as human CD28SA induced
a massive cytokine release syndrome in a phase I clinical
trial.30,31 This serious adverse effect was probably caused by
the stimulation of effector memory CD4 T-cells.32 We only
found a mild increase of serum cytokine in the highest dose
of CDSA28 in the present study. However, from a safety perspective, the translation of our findings in mice to patients has
to take into account the differences between species that have
been specifically elucidated in the context of CD28SA33 subsequent to the disastrous cytokine release syndrome observed
in a phase 1 study.30
Interestingly, recent data suggest that CD28SA-activated
and -expanded human Treg are very potent suppressors of
inflammatory cytokine release in PBMC cultures from patients
with rheumatoid arthritis.34 The same study also showed that
slow infusion of much lower doses (≤7 μg/kg) than used in
the ill-fated HV trial of 2006 (bolus injection of 100 μg/kg)
is well tolerated and leads to systemic release of IL-10 but
not of proinflammatory cytokines. Further studies in different
indications are needed to determine whether transient polyclonal Treg activation could be a safe and effective approach
for stroke and other indications.
Inflammation after stroke encompasses immunosuppression
and resulting increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. A
limitation of our study is that we did not examine potential
microbiological complications of CD28SA. Although Treg
are rather conceived as immune modulators than as immunosuppressors,35 the effect of polyclonal activated Treg on longterm immunologic outcome requires further investigation.
In conclusion, our study suggests that CD28SA expands the
number of Treg cells that produce IL-10 and thereby protects
against brain damage in experimental murine stroke.

Amplification of regulatory T cells using a CD28 superagonist reduces brain damage
after ischemic stroke in mice

Supplemental Methods

Experimental stroke models
In most experiments, experimental brain ischemia was induced by permanent transcranial
coagulation of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) distal from the lenticulostriatal arteries as
described previously1. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 1.0–2.0% isofluran in O2/N2O.
After a 1cm long skin incision between the left eye and ear, a burr hole was drilled, the dura
mater was removed and the MCA was occluded permanently (pMCAO) using a bipolar
electrocoagulation forceps (ERBOTOM, ERBE). For transient focal ischemia, mice were
anesthetized with 1.0–2.0% isofluran in O2/N2O. After neck dissection an incision was made
into the external carotid artery between 2 ligations, and a silicon-covered 8–0 nylon
monofilament (Doccol Corperation) was advanced via the internal carotid artery until a
resistance was felt. Successful occlusion was verified by laser doppler flowmetry. Only
animals with a reduction of relative cerebral blood flow to < 25% of baseline were included in
the study. 60 minutes after filament insertion, mice were anesthetized again and the filament
was removed.
Allocation of animals to treatment groups was randomized. Surgeons were blinded to
treatment assignment. We excluded animals in which surgery lasted for more than 25min, or
in which mice lost more than 25% of their body weight during the 7d observation period.

Measurement of Infarct Volume

Mice were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of Ketamin/Xylazin (100mg/kg and 10mg/kg,
respectively) and transcardially perfused with saline. Brains were removed, immediately
frozen and 20µm thick coronal cryosections were cut every 400µm. Stained sections were
scanned at 300dpi and the infarct area was analyzed using a public domain image analysis
program (ImageJ) program. The total infarct volume was obtained by multiplying measured
areas and distance between sections. Correction for brain edema was applied by subtraction of
the ipsilateral minus contralateral hemisphere volume from the directly measured infarct
volume. Evaluators were blinded to treatment assignment.

Functional outcome test
Mice were placed between two boards each with a dimension of 30 x 20 x 1cm set at a 30°
angle with a small opening along the joint to encourage the mouse entering the corner. Left
and right turns with rearing movement were counted. We scored 12 turns for each test and
calculated the ratio of right turns of all turns and normalized on the performance prior surgery
of each individual mouse. For the cylinder test, mice were placed in a glass cylinder (8 cm in
diameter) and recorded for 10 min. We scored contact of the cylinder wall with one forelimb
during a full rear and landing with one forelimb at the cylinder bottom. At least 20
independent contacts were counted for one forelimb. 	  
	  
Flow cytometry analysis
Cells were stained for FACS using the following antibodies: CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5, CD4 Alexa
647, MHCII-FITC, CD45.2-APC, CD11c-PE, CD3-PE-Cy7, CD8a-APC, CD69-PerCPCy5.5, IL-10-PE, CD11b-APC-Cy7, Ly6G-FITC (BD Biosciences) and Foxp3-PE or FITC,
IFN-γ-PE, TNF-α-PE, Ki-67 Alexa 700 from eBioscience. For intracellular staining, cells
were restimulated with 100ng/mL phorbol myristate acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 600ng/mL
ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of protein transport inhibitor (BD GolgiStop or

GolgiPlug, BD Biosciences) in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum for 4 hours and stained
with CD3, CD45, CD4, IL-10, CD11b, IFN-γ-PE, TNF-α and Foxp3 according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (eBioscience). Data were collected on a LSRII flow cytometer
(Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) and analyzed by FlowJo software (Tree Star,
Ashland, OR).
