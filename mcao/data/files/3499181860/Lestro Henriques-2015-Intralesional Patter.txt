Abstract
Background: After acute ischemia, the tissue that is at risk
of infarction can be detected by perfusion-weighted imaging/diffusion-weighted imaging (PWI/DWI) mismatch but
the time that is needed to process PWI limits its use. As DWI
is highly sensitive to acute ischemic tissue damage, we hypothesized that different ADC patterns represent areas with
a different potential for recovery. Methods: In a model of
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO),
Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly distributed to sham
surgery and pMCAO. We further separated the pMCAO
group according to intralesional ADC pattern (homogeneous or heterogeneous). At 24 h after ischemia induction,
we analyzed lesion size, functional outcome, cell death expression, and brain protection markers including ROS enzyme NOX-4. MRI included DWI (ADC maps), DTI (tractography), and PWI (CBF, CBV and MTT). Results: The lesion size
was similar in pMCAO rats. Animals with a heterogeneous

pattern in ADC maps showed better functional outcome in
Rotarod test (p = 0.032), less expression of cell death (p =
0.014) and NOX-4 (p = 0.0063), higher intralesional CBF (p =
0.0026) and larger PWI/DWI mismatch (p = 0.007). Conclusions: In a rodent model for ischemic stroke, intralesional
heterogeneity in ADC maps was related to better functional
outcome in lesions of similar size and interval after pMCAO.
DWI ADC maps may assist in the early identification of ischemic tissue with an increased potential for recovery as higher expression of acute protection markers, lower expression
of cell death, increased PWI/DWI mismatch, and higher intralesional CBF were present in animals with a heterogeneous
ADC pattern.

the time that is needed to process PWI limits its use in the
acute clinical setting. However, acute ischemic stroke can
produce different types of intralesional patterns in DWI
[1]. In ADC maps, those patterns can be either homogeneous or patchy and heterogeneous. Since DWI is highly
sensitive to tissue damage, we hypothesized that these two
patterns in ADC maps represent ischemic areas with a different potential for recovery after acute ischemia and consequently predict functional outcome after acute ischemia.
In this study, we evaluated the correlation between different intralesional patterns in MRI ADC maps, functional outcome, and immunohistochemical markers of tissue
damage to further confirm that different patterns are associated to brain tissue preservation despite the same infarct size and interval after permanent middle cerebral
artery occlusion (pMCAO).

both groups. Three rats were excluded from the study because of
incomplete ischemia in the MCA territory.
We defined ADC patterns according to qualitative visual criteria:
heterogeneous pattern if more than 2/3 of the ischemic area was
heterogeneous (patchy) and homogeneous pattern for the remaining. Later on, in order to confirm this point, we designed a quantitative method based on a histogram analysis categorization. Briefly, we
delineated the lesion zone on each slice of ADC maps. Then, we adjusted the levels from 0 to 3,000 μm2/s (standard values of ADC maps
from rat brain). All images visually considered homogeneous
showed differences in ADC values (between minimum to maximum) below 300 μm2/s. All heterogeneous images showed differences above 300 μm2/s. This value was determinated as cut-off for
this study using the pMCAO experimental model. Quantitative assessment using the apparent diffusion coefficient showed that there
were no heterogeneous patterns with an ADC value below 630.
Experimental Procedures
A surgical model of pMCAO was used as previously described
elsewhere [2] and physiological parameters were recorded
throughout the procedure (online suppl. material; for all online
suppl. material, see www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000381727).

Material and Methods
Ethical Committee, Animal Rights
Procedures were carried out at the Cerebrovascular and Neuroscience Research Laboratory at La Paz University Hospital, and
at the Animal Imaging Department (SIERMAC®), Universidad
Autónoma de Madrid, Spain. Experiments were performed in
compliance with the Ethical Committee for the Care and Use of
Animals in Research rules following the International Guidelines
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Royal Decree
(RD)1201/2005 and European Directive 2010/63/UE). The experiments were designed to use the smallest number of animals possible and to minimize their suffering in accordance with the ethical
standards of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. We included postsurgery analgesia for all groups. All rats (sham and pMCAO) had
a right cranial suture of the same dimension. Group allocation
codes were used to keep observation blinded to group allocation
while collecting functional data and performing molecular and
histological procedures.
Subject Selection Criteria and Data Collection Tools
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, 10 to 12 weeks old, with an
average body weight of 250 to 320 g (Charles River® S.L., Barcelona, Spain), were housed with free access to standard rat chow
and water. Room temperature was maintained at 21 ± 2 ° C, with
a relative humidity of 45 ± 15% and a light/dark cycle of 12/12 h
(7:00–19:00 h/19:00–7:00 h). Rats were randomly assigned to the
following groups: sham surgery (craniotomy) and permanent
middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). After 24 h, T2-weighted MRI was performed in order to confirm complete MCAO and
equal infarct size in animals submitted to pMCAO. Rats submitted
to pMCAO were then further divided into 2 groups according to
the result of the DWI MRI ADC maps: group 1 if heterogeneities
were present inside the ischemic lesion in more than 2/3 of the
ADC maps (subgroup ‘heterogeneous’), and group 2 if DWI
showed a homogenous lesion in ADC maps (subgroup ‘homogeneous’). The number of rats submitted to surgery was progressively increased until a minimum of 12 animals was reached in

Magnetic Resonance Imaging
The extension of the ischemic lesions was analyzed using T2weighted MRI. We used diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps and tractography, as well as perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) with determination of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV),
and mean transient time (MTT). Relative ADC values were calculated in comparison with the corresponding contralateral region
(online suppl. material).
Statistical Analysis
Functional evaluation scores, lesion size, cell death, and protein
levels are described as the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM)
and presented as box and whisker plots. Data were analyzed using
the Student’s t-test or the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test if data
followed a non-normal distribution in the Shapiro-Wilk test. Values
of p < 0.05 were considered significant at a 95% confidence level.

 

Results

Physiological Parameters
Glycemia was assessed immediately after starting the
procedure and during surgery and it was found to have
similar values in all groups. Rectal temperature was significantly lower after induction of anesthesia in all groups
(p < 0.05) and maintained at 37 ± 0.5 ° C. Mean PaCO2 and
PaO2 were not significantly different before and after surgical proceedings.

Pattern
At 24 h after pMCAO, the lesion size measured by T2weighted MRI did not differ between groups (heterogeneous vs. homogeneous: 28.99 ± 2.27 vs. 29.55 ± 2.72, p =
0.418). Sham animals showed no ischemic lesion (fig. 1a, b).

Functional assessment was performed before the procedure and at 24 h. At baseline, Rogers modified scale was
zero for all animals and the latency to fall in the Rotarod
test was >120 s. Sham-operated animals did not show any

Less Cell Death Expression after pMCAO in
Heterogeneous ADC Pattern
Animals with a heterogeneous ADC pattern expressed
significantly less TUNEL positive cells at 24 h, when compared to animals showing homogeneous ADC pattern
(56.25 ± 13.75 vs. 170.5 ± 61.0, p = 0.014) (fig. 2a). Shamoperated rats did not show TUNEL positive cells.
Brain Protection Associated Markers: Homogeneous
versus Heterogeneous ADC Pattern
NOX-4 showed a significantly lower expression in animals with a heterogeneous intralesional ADC pattern
when compared to homogeneous pattern (2.1 ± 0.367 vs.
4.693 ± 1.31, p = 0.0063) (fig. 2b, c). The levels of SOD2
at 24 h were significantly higher in animals with a heterogeneous intralesional ADC type when compared to animals with a homogeneous pattern (4.84 ± 1.049 vs. 2.906 ±
0.368, p = 0.0039) (fig. 2b middle, c). At 24 h, the group
with a heterogeneous intralesional ADC pattern showed
a decreased expression of GFAP when compared to animals with a homogeneous pattern; however, the difference was not significant (2.52 ± 0.53 vs. 4.04 ± 0.71, p =
0.068) (fig. 2b below, c).
Apparent Diffusion Coefficients and Tractographies:
Homogeneous versus Heterogeneous ADC Pattern
Apparent diffusion coefficients differed significantly
between the two ADC patterns and animals with a heterogeneous pattern showed higher values (844.87 ±
155.402 vs. 537.33 ± 61.15, p = 0.0013). Furthermore, the
lowest coefficient was observed in a homogeneous lesion
and the highest value in a heterogeneous lesion. No heterogeneous lesion type was observed below 630. Additionally, the SEM of apparently diffusion coefficients was
much larger in heterogeneous lesions (155.4 vs. 61.15)
(fig. 3a ). DWI tractographies showed also a more consistent preservation in the fiber reconstruction model of
ischemic areas in the heterogeneous lesion type (fig. 3b).
Higher Intralesional Cerebral Blood Flow in
Heterogeneous ADC Pattern
CBF inside ischemic lesions differed between the two
patterns. Animals with a heterogeneous pattern showed
296

the higher values for CBF if compared to animals with
homogeneous ADC patterns (79.66 ± 32.2 vs. 55.43 ±
16.0, p = 0.0026). The lowest value was observed in a homogeneous lesion (14 ml/100 g/min) and the highest in a
heterogeneous lesion (218 ml/100 g/min) (fig. 3c).
Larger PWI/DWI Mismatch in Heterogeneous ADC
Pattern
We calculated the PWI/DWI mismatch using the standard volumetric model (mismatch = %PWI – %DWI volume) measured in each slice that showed the lesion and
selected the slice that had the largest lesion size. The observed mismatch was higher in the heterogeneous pattern
when compared to animals with homogeneous lesions
(7.72 ± 1.94 vs. 2.35 ± 1.45, p = 0.007) (fig. 3d).

Discussion

We used a rodent model of pMCAO and identified
distinct intralesional patterns in MRI ADC maps that
were associated with different functional outcome in lesions of similar size and the same ischemic duration. Animals with heterogeneous patterns in ADC maps showed
a better outcome after acute ischemic infarction when
compared to animals with the homogeneous type. Intralesional heterogeneity was also related to less expression
of cell death and markers of brain tissue protection. When
assessing PWI/DWI mismatch, heterogeneous lesions
showed a larger mismatch, purportedly related to a higher probability of recovery of ischemic penumbra and
without progression to definitive infarction [4–6].
Clinical studies demonstrated inconsistency regarding
prognosis in patients with lesions of the same size, arterial territory and time after symptoms onset including
complete MCA occlusion [7–9]. Several explanations for
this diversity in functional outcome have been brought
forward and include individual variability in collateral
circulation, preconditioning, and microcirculation response after ischemic insult [10, 11]. However, the relation between heterogeneous patterns in ADC maps and
functional outcome has not yet been addressed in the
clinical setting. In our experimental model, rats with the
same lesion size, territory, and time after ischemic induction, showed also that kind of diversity, with the heterogeneous pattern of ADC maps presenting a better functional outcome. Consequently, patterns of ADC maps indicated different functional prognoses. As MRI DWI
sequences better reflect anatomical tissue structure [12],
they can be considered a bridge between basic science and

pattern when compared to animals with a homogeneous
pattern regarding the latency to fall in the Rotarod test
(110.37 ± 31.43 vs. 51.25 ± 30.87, p = 0.032). No significant differences were observed in the Rogers test (3.43 ±
0.48 vs. 3.57 ± 0.41, p = 0.158) (fig. 1c).

terns and observed significantly reduced expression of
NOX-4 in the heterogeneous pattern. We also found a
higher expression of SOD2, a major scavenger of mitochondrial superoxide, in the group with a heterogeneous
ADC pattern. SOD2 is synthesized after brain infarction
and tissue levels are generally related to lesion size. However, since we compare lesions with equal size, higher expression of SOD2, together with less expression of ROS
producing enzyme NOX-4, is indicative of less use of
SOD2 for neutralization of mitochondrial superoxide
[22] and, consequently, less oxidative stress and definite
brain lesion in the heterogeneous type. Additionally, we
observed a smaller expression of GFAP in the group with
a heterogeneous pattern, albeit not significant. Since after
an acute brain lesion, astrocytes occupy the empty space
left by phagocytosis in order to maintain tissue structure,
reactive gliosis is part of the healing process being massive
gliosis related to worse outcome [23]. Consequently, the
reduced expression of GFAP in animals with the heterogeneous pattern may indicate a reduced ischemic injury.
Although not addressing early reperfusion directly, we
observed a DWI MRI pattern that distinguishes functional outcome. We observed increased PWI/DWI mismatch
in ischemic MCA lesions with a heterogeneous pattern
indicating a higher potential for reversibility in these animals. On the other hand, in animals with a homogeneous
pattern, CBF was reduced and eventually it reached a value as low as 6–15 ml/100 g/min. Despite the variability in
CBF thresholds in different brain locations or age groups,
levels as low as 6–15 ml/100 g/min correspond to thresholds of biochemical biomarkers of protein synthesis inhibition, preference for aerobic glycolysis, neurotransmitter release, impaired energy metabolism and terminal depolarization with potassium influx. We also observed
coherence in our data concerning functional outcome
and biochemical markers (with less expression of cell
death and less expression of ROS markers) favoring the
group with a heterogeneous pattern. Possibly, the homogeneous ADC pattern indicates irreversible brain damage
where reperfusion might be futile or even dangerous.
However, research in the clinical setting is necessary to
confirm our experimental data and validate the usefulness of intralesional ADC patterns to predict outcome
and identify patients that may benefit from reperfusion.
Finally, it would be desirable to identify a quantitative
threshold that easily distinguishes heterogeneous from
homogeneous patterns and consequently subjects with a
high potential for recovery from subjects with an increased risk for irreversible infarction. In our study, no
heterogeneous samples were observed below 630 and

clinical assessment through high resolution anatomical
delineation of disease at an ionic and molecular level [13].
As our findings support improved preservation of the intralesional region when ADC maps show a heterogeneous pattern in lesions of MCA territory and higher diffusion coefficients that represent a surrogate measure of
better anatomical tissue preservation, a reduced risk of
definite infarction can be assumed.
The introduction of mismatch measurement as inclusion criteria for reperfusion in clinical trials included significant differences in the definition of mismatch and a
rather arbitrary volumetric difference of 20% between
PWI and DWI that still lacks validation as a threshold for
stratifying patients or as a surrogate measure of penumbra [5, 13]. PWI also requires contrast administration and
time-consuming processing, losing valuable time before
reperfusion [14, 15]. In this study, we were able to show
that the interpretation of distinct intralesional MRI DWI
ADC patterns in lesions of the same size might offer similar pretreatment information.
We also observed that animals with heterogeneous intralesional ADC patterns showed higher CBF with larger
variations inside the ischemic lesion, along with enhanced
functional outcome. Additionally, tractographies showed
better fiber preservation in the heterogeneous type. In the
clinical setting, tractography has also been used to show
structural integrity of the corticospinal tract and was related to recovery [16, 17].
As outlined earlier, DWI is the MRI sequence that
more consistently reflects ionic and molecular tissue
changes since the effect in the Brownian movement of
water molecules is changed in the presence of abnormal
anatomical features [18]. In previous studies, our group
described gene expression associated with trophic factors
and CNS development within the lesion core at 24 h after
pMCAO, suggesting the existence of surviving areas inside the ischemic core [19]. Our findings support the argument that the central region of the ischemic territory is
not inexorably dead or irreversibly damaged. In this
study, we could show differences in the expression of cell
death related to different patterns in ADC maps with significantly less expression in the group with a heterogeneous pattern. The present data further emphasize our
previous findings and show additionally a relation between ADC patterns and tissue preservation that requires
further exploration.
Oxidative stress causes tissue damage after acute brain
ischemia with overexpression of ROS above physiological
levels [20, 21]. We analyzed the expression of major ROS
producing enzyme NOX-4 in both groups of ADC pat-

only a single homogeneous sample showed an ADC value
above this threshold (643). If confirmed in the clinical
context, the determination of a similar threshold may
prove useful in identifying patients with irreversible ischemia without indication for thrombolysis. In this context,
the results of this study represent a promising tool in pretreatment decisions in the acute stroke setting.
Study Limitations and Potential Bias
As shown by our experimental data in a pMCAO model of ischemic stroke, the heterogeneity in the coefficients
of apparent diffusion inside the ischemic lesion represents
areas with a different potential for recovery. Nevertheless,
there is significant variability in ADC values depending on
MRI apparatus, coil systems, imagers, or employed field
strengths that should be taken into account when analyzing data from different MRI equipment. We used relative
ADC values because they are more suitable for evaluating
diffusion abnormalities than absolute values.
We used a model of permanent MCAO with high reproducibility confirmed by equal lesion size in both the
heterogeneous and homogeneous groups and interval after stroke onset was controlled for. However, our experimental model did not include vascular risk factors, older
age, or the female gender. Also, variability in preconditioning, individual variability in collateral circulation, or
intracranial pressure variations that may interfere with
microcirculation are difficult to assess in an experimental
model and may have impact on results.

Conclusions

Intralesional patterns of MRI ADC maps in an experimental model of ischemic stroke can be categorized in
heterogeneous and homogeneous patterns. Animals with
the same infarct size and interval after ischemia but a heterogeneous intralesional ADC pattern showed better
functional outcome, higher expression of brain protection markers, and less expression of cell death. Animals
with a homogeneous pattern showed a smaller PWI/DWI
mismatch, indicating a reduced potential for recovery
from ischemic penumbra and an increased risk for progression to definitive infarction. Applied to the clinical
setting, early identification of tissue fate after ischemic
stroke through DWI ADC map patterns may assist in
acute therapeutic decisions.
