Abstract Punicalagin (PG) is a hydrolysable tannin compound found in Punica granatum L. The purpose of the
present work is to explore the neuroprotective mechanism of
PG against ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury in rat model of
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Rats were randomly divided into sham, MCAO, and PG-treated groups. PG
(15 and 30 mg/kg), the vehicle was administered orally for
7 days prior to MCAO. Rats were anesthetised with ketamine
(100 mg/kg/im), xylazine (10 mg/kg/im) and subjected to 2 h
occlusion and 22 h reperfusion. The effects of PG on behavioral deficit and infarct volume, the levels of glutamate and
calcium as well as the levels of inflammatory cytokines tumor
necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-1b (IL-1b), interleukin-6 (IL-6) were evaluated. Moreover, the expressions of
caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax were detected by Western blotting.
As compared with MCAO group, PG-treated rats showed
dose-dependent reduction in infarct volume and substantial
improvement in behavioral deficit. The levels of glutamate,
calcium, TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 were restored significantly.
The Western blotting results revealed that the expression of
Bcl-2 was up-regulated and that of caspase-3, Bax were downregulated when exposed to PG. From our results, it can be
concluded that PG showed an ameliorative effect against
cerebral I/R injury in rats through its anti-inflammatory,
antioxidant actions besides it inhibits excitotoxicity. It also
suppresses apoptosis through regulating, Bcl-2, caspase-3,
and Bax protein expressions, perhaps another mechanism by
which PG employs its neuroprotective action.

Introduction
Stroke is one of the contributing causes of death worldwide, of
which ischemic stroke is the predominant one [1]. Experimental evidence suggested that ischemic stroke is linked up
with multiple pathological events of energy failure, excitotoxicity [2, 3], oxidative and nitrosative stress [4], inflammation [5], apoptosis [6], and ultimately all these issues
contribute to neuronal damage [7]. Tissue plasminogen activator is the only Food and Drug Administration approved drug
of choice for stroke patients, but its therapeutic application is
limited to patients within 3 h of stroke [8]. Due to its limited
therapeutic application, an ample of research has been riveted
along the evolution of traditional medicinal plants, nutraceuticals, and phytocompounds for stroke [9, 10]. One such nutraceutical is Punica granatum L. (Pomegranate). The
standardized pomegranate fruit extract showed protective
effect against ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury through its
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activities [11]. Punicalagin
(PG), a hydrolysable tannin found rich in pomegranate,
responsible for most of the pomegranate health benefits. It is
considerably recognized for its biological properties like
antiproliferative, antioxidant, antihypertensive, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, antiatherosclerotic, and antiplatelet
activities [12]. It has all the attributes of an anti-ischemic
agent. Our previous studies reported that PG showed neuroprotective function against cerebral I/R injury via anti-oxidative function [13]. The present work is guaranteed to further
look into the possible mechanism of the neuroprotective
function against I/R-induced neuronal damage.

Materials and methods

Neurobehavioral studies: neurological score

Chemicals

A neurological examination is blindly performed at 22 h after
reperfusion (before killing) according to the method described
by Longa et al. [14]. The neurological findings were scored
using a five-point scale. No neurologic deficit = score 0,
failure to extend forepaw fully = score 1, circling to the
left = score 2, falling to the left or no spontaneous motor
activity = score 3, and do not walk spontaneously and
experience a lowered stage of consciousness = score 4.

PG is obtained from Natural Remedies, Bangalore. 2,3,5Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), tumor necrosis factora (TNF-a), interleukin-1b (IL-1b), interleukin-6 (IL-6)
ELISA kits were purchased from Ray Biotech, Inc., USA.
Antibodies of caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, and biotinylated antirabbit were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.,
USA. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit
antibody was procured from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.,
USA. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade.
Animals
Male rats of Wistar strain weighing 280–300 g were used
for the study. The rats were maintained under conditions of
12 h light/dark cycle and had free access to food and water.
All experimental procedures were carried out after
obtaining approval from the Institutional Animal Ethical
Committee (No. 1677/PO/a/12/CPCSEA/4).

Grip strength
Grip strength was done according to the method of Moran
et al. [15]. The apparatus with a string of 50 cm length,
pulled out between two vertical supports at height 1 m and
evaluated according to the following scale: 0, fall off; 1,
hangs onto the string by two forepaws; 2, as for 1 but
attempts to climb on the string; 3, hangs onto the string by
two forepaws plus one or both hind limbs; 4, hangs onto the
string by forepaws plus tail wrapped around string; and 5,
escape. The highest reading of three successive trials was
recorded for each animal.

Experimental design
Adhesive removal test
After acclimation, the rats were randomly separated into
four groups; each group consisted of 18 rats, treated with
drug or vehicle orally by gavage once daily for 7 days prior
to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The first group
attended to as sham control and received 2 % Tween 80
orally. The second group attended to as a MCAO model
group and received 2 % Tween 80 orally. The third and
fourth groups were treated with PG 15 and 30 mg/kg/p.o.,
respectively, for 7 days. After 7 days of pretreatment, rats
were subjected to 2 h right MCAO via the intraluminal filament technique and 22 h reperfusion under the anesthesia
of ketamine (100 mg/kg/im) and xylazine (10 mg/kg/im).
Briefly, the right common carotid artery was exposed at the
level of the external and internal carotid artery bifurcation. A
4-0 nylon suture with a blunted tip was inserted into the
internal carotid artery and advanced into the anterior cerebral artery to block the MCA. After closing up the MCA for
2 h, nylon suture was removed carefully to restore blood
flow and then the skin was sutured. The animals were then
returned to their cages and closely monitored for 22 h. The
body temperature was maintained at 37 °C with a thermostatically controlled infrared lamp. In sham-operated group,
the external carotid artery was surgically prepared for
insertion of the filament, but the filament was not inserted.
After 22 h of reperfusion, a battery of tests was employed to
measure the neurobehavioral severity. Then the animals
were sacrificed by cervical decapitation to obtain brain
samples for further studies.

123

The adhesive removal test was performed by the method of
Schallert et al. [16]. For the adhesive removal somatosensory
test, animals were tested 22 h after MCAO [17]. Two small
adhesive-back paper dots each 8-mm diameter were placed
on each forepaws to cover the hairless part of the forepaws.
The animal was placed in a box (40 cm 9 30 cm) and the
time required by the animal to remove the pieces of tape from
the ipsilateral and contralateral paws was recorded. The
animals were given a maximum of 180 s to sense the tapes
and remove them and were scored as 180 s if they did not
succeed. The highest reading of three successive trials was
recorded for each animal.
Determination of cerebral infarct volume by TTC staining
After reperfusion for 22 h, rats were decapitated under
anesthesia with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/
kg), and the brains were kept at -20 °C for 40 min. Frozen
brain was sliced into uniform coronal sections of about
2 mm thickness each. Brain slices were incubated with 2 %
TTC in 0.2 mol/l phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for
30 min and fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin for
overnight. The unstained areas of the fixed brain sections
were defined as infarcted. After 24 h of fixation, the slices
are photographed. The infarct volume was calculated by
measuring the unstained and stained areas in each slice,
multiplying this by the slice thickness (2 mm).

Mol Cell Biochem (2015) 402:141–148

Biochemical analysis: brain tissue preparation
The animals in all groups (six from each) were sacrificed
by cervical decapitation under anesthesia and brains were
quickly dissected out, homogenized in 50 mM phosphate
buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.1 mM EDTA to yield 5 % (w/
v) homogenate. The homogenate was centrifuged at
10,000 rpm for 10 min at 0 °C in cold centrifuge, the
resulting supernatant was used for further studies.
Determination of protein content
Protein was determined according to the method of Lowry
et al. [18] using bovine serum albumin as standard protein.
Measurement of glutamate levels
Glutamate levels were measured according to the method
described by Bernt and Bergmeyer [19] with minor modifications. To 1 ml of supernatant, 2 ml of perchloric acid
was added and the pH was adjusted to 9.0 with phosphate
buffer. The resulting mixture was subjected to centrifugation at 1,5009g for 15 min and was allowed to stand for
10 min in an ice bath and then filtered through fluted filter
paper. Absorbance was measured at 340 nm. The glutamate levels are expressed as lmol/g tissue.

143

Proteins were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS) sample buffer and epitopes were exposed by boiling
the protein samples at 100 °C for 5 min. A 50 lg of proteins was loaded and separated by electrophoresis on 12 %
(w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and proteins
were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was carried out by incubating the membrane in
blocking solution [5 % dry milk in Tris–buffered saline–
Tween 20 (TBST) buffer for 1 h] and then with specific
polyclonal antibodies, i.e., caspase-3, Bcl-2, Bax (1:100,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA) for 12 h at 4 °C.
Membranes were washed three times with TBST buffer and
incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
(1:5,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA) for 1 h at
room temperature followed by washing three times with
TBST buffer. Bands were visualized on the Odyssey
infrared scanner (Biosciences, USA) and quantitatively
analyzed by densitometry with Quantity one software (BioRad).
Statistical analysis
All values were expressed as mean ± standard error of
mean (SEM). Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of
variance with a post-hoc test of Dunnett’s test using
Graphpad Prism software (Version 5.0). A value of
p \ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

Measurement of total calcium levels
The total calcium levels were measured according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using commercially available
kits (Span Diagnostics Ltd., India).

Results

Determination of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1b
and IL-6)

The animals were scored for neurologic deficit after 22 h of
reperfusion using a five-point scale. The MCAO model
group showed significantly increased (p \ 0.001) neurologic scores as compared to the sham group. PG pretreated
animals showed significant improvement in neurologic
deficit score (p \ 0.001) as compared with model group
(Table 1). The tape removal test is a technique that
assesses sensory and motor impairments in forepaw function. After 2 h MCAO/22 h reperfusion, an increase in the
time needed to remove adhesive tape from the contralateral
forepaw was observed in the MCAO group as compared
with sham group rats (Table 1). Interestingly, PG pretreated animals showed significant shortened time to
remove the adhesive tapes from the forepaws compared
with a MCAO group (p \ 0.001). The grip strength was
found to be significantly decreased (p \ 0.001) in the
MCAO group as compared to the sham group. Whereas
significantly (p \ 0.001) improved grip strength was
observed in PG pretreated group as compared to MCAO
group (Table 1).

Inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 in tissue
homogenate were measured on an ELISA reader according
to manufacturer’s instructions (Ray Biotech, Inc., USA).
Detection of caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax expression
by Western blotting
Cerebral tissue from each experimental group was minced
and homogenized in ice cold lysis buffer. Homogenates
were centrifuged at 4,0009g for 10 min to remove cellular
debris. The cytosolic fractions of the proteins were
obtained by collecting the supernatant and centrifuged at
16,0009g for 30 min at 4 °C to maximize protein extraction. The membrane fraction was obtained by treating the
pellet with lysis buffer supplemented with 1 % Triton-X
followed by centrifugation at 16,0009g. Protein concentrations were determined using modified Lowry method.

Effect of PG on infarct area
The cerebral infarct area was measured 24 h after I/R by TTC
staining. Figure 1a showed typical pictographs of TTC stained
coronal sections of sham, MCAO, and PG pretreated rats. TTC
stained coronal sections of MCAO group revealed extensive
pale area representing increased infarction as compared to
coronal sections of sham group. Appreciable reduction in pale
area was observed in PG pretreated group as compared with
MCAO group. The extent of pale area is measured in terms of
percentage of infarction (Fig. 1b). MCAO group showed
significant increase in infarct area as compared with sham
group. PG pre-treatment afforded a significant reduction in the
infarct area as compared with MCAO group.
Effect of PG on glutamate and calcium levels
Increased glutamate and calcium levels are the markers for
excitotoxicity of a cell that may lead to damage. A significant elevation (p \ 0.001) of glutamate and calcium
levels was observed in MCAO groups as compared to the
sham group (Table 2). The PG pretreated group offered
significant (p \ 0.001) restoration of glutamate and calcium levels in comparison to MCAO group.
Effect of PG on proinflammatory cytokines
I/R results in increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines
(IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a) at the site of injury. MCAO group
animals showed elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines of IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a (p \ 0.001) significantly as
compared to sham group (Table 2). The PG pretreated group
showed a significant restoration in the levels of inflammatory cytokines in comparison to MCAO group (p \ 0.001).
Effect of PG on the expressions of caspase-3, Bcl-2,
and Bax
The expressions of execution protein caspase-3, antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, and pro-apoptotic protein Bax
were evaluated to gather insights into apoptotic signaling.

I/R injury led to a substantial reduction in Bcl-2 expression
compared with the sham operated group, while treatment of
PG markedly improved Bcl-2 reduction as compared with a
MCAO group (Fig. 2). In contrast, Bax content and caspase-3 content in rats subjected to I/R showed a significant
increase as compared with the sham operated group. And
this increase in Bax content and caspase-3 content was
significantly (p \ 0.001) ameliorated by PG (Fig. 2).

Discussion
The present study investigated the mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of PG against cerebral I/R-induced brain
trauma. Ischemic stroke results from hypoxia and is linked
up with multifaceted pathological events such as decreased
adenosine tri phosphate (ATP) upshots in diminished
energy supply, excitotoxicity, edema, oxidative and nitrosative stress, inflammation and apoptosis ultimately leads
to brain injury [20]. Reperfusion of blood flow is necessary
for survival, but reperfusion exacerbates the brain injury
rather than restored to normal function [21]. Over a decade,
an ample of research has been manifested in the development of drugs from traditional herbal origin for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders including stroke.
Research studies reported that cerebral ischemia results
in neurological dysfunction due to motor function deterioration [22–24]. Neurologic findings are the symptomatic
indicator of I/R-induced brain damage. Adhesive removal
test, neurologic score, and grip strength were evaluated to
measure the extent of impairment of motor functions. Dose
dependently, PG ameliorated the neuropathological cascade after I/R, indicating its therapeutic potential.
During ischemia, diminished sodium potassium ATPase
activity recruits Na? ions along with H? ions into the cell
and results in edema [25, 26]. Moreover, the extracellular
calcium (Ca2?) increases and stimulates glutamate to further activates NMDA and AMPA receptors to a vicious
cycle of release of further glutamate and calcium leads to
excitotoxicity, which is one of the pathological event in I/R
injury. The elevated calcium and glutamate levels were

significantly ameliorated by PG, which assigns to the
protective mechanism of PG in reperfusion injury.
Diminished energy supply, excitotoxicity eventually leads
to disruption of blood–brain barrier, paves the way to
recruit circulating leucocytes, to advance the accumulation
of neutrophils, macrophages and to activate microglia for
the liberation of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6,
and TNF-a. All these eventually lead to neuroapoptosis and
thereby exacerbating the neuronal damage after ischemia
following reperfusion. Accumulating evidence reported
that the levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6
and TNF-a were elevated after I/R indicating that inflammation plays a vital function in ischemic injury followed
by reperfusion [27–30]. In consistent with the earlier neuroprotective study of pomegranate extract against I/R [11],
our study clearly demonstrated that prior administration of
PG to MCAO followed by reperfusion significantly ameliorated the elevated levels of IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a,

p \ 0.001 versus MCAO group

which supports the neuro anti-inflammatory potential of PG
against I/R injury.
Existing evidence suggested that increased calcium
levels attributes to mitochondrial dysfunction, caspasedependent apoptosis, over activates lipases, and proteases
and thereby triggers cell death. The mitochondrial cytochrome C activates caspase-9, which then activates effector
caspase-3 and thus, leads to apoptosis [31–34]. Caspases
are cysteine proteases that are specifically activated during
apoptotic stimuli [35]. Several previous studies reported
that caspase-3 functions as a central mediator of apoptosis
in ischemic stroke [36]. Our results demonstrated that
activated caspase-3 is highly expressed in rat brain after I/R
injury. PG administration prior to MCAO significantly
down-regulated the relative expression of caspase-3 activity and inhibited the apoptotic cell death. The Bcl-2 family
of proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bax regulate programmed cell death. Experimental studies have indicated

that over-expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 can
reduce ischemic brain injury in animal models of stroke
[37, 38]. Activated Bax promotes cell death [39]. Nevertheless, these two molecules can move independently to
exert their effects on cell death [6]. In congruence with
earlier studies, we observed down-regulation of Bcl-2 and
up-regulation of Bax in rats subjected to 2 h MCAO and
22 h reperfusion. PG-treated rats have showed up-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and down-regulation of
proapoptotic protein Bax in rats after I/R as well. Nevertheless, these observations clearly demonstrated that PG
offered a significant protection against I/R injury, possibly
due to its anti-apoptotic potential.
In conclusion, targeting inflammation, apoptotic cascade
and preventing the consequences after I/R seems to be
promising therapeutic interventions for ischemic stroke.

Taking this into consideration, our study was designed and
demonstrated the neuroprotective intervention with PG in
MCAO rat model. Our results clearly indicated that PG
rendered a remarkable protection by down-regulating proinflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, apoptotic
mediators caspase-3, Bax proteins and excitotoxicity
mediators, up-regulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein,
thereby decreasing neurological severity, cerebral infarction and prevented associated neuronal damage in rats after
I/R.
