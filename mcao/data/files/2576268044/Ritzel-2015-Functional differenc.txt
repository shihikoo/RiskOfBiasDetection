Abstract
Background: The brain’s initial innate response to stroke is primarily mediated by microglia, the resident
macrophage of the CNS. However, as early as 4 h after stroke, the blood–brain barrier is compromised and
monocyte infiltration occurs. The lack of discriminating markers between these two myeloid populations has led
many studies to generate conclusions based on the grouping of these two populations. A growing body of
evidence now supports the distinct roles played by microglia and monocytes in many disease models.
Methods: Using a flow cytometry approach, combined with ex-vivo functional assays, we were able to distinguish
microglia from monocytes using the relative expression of CD45 and assess the function of each cell type following
stroke over the course of 7 days.
Results: We found that at 72 h after a 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), microglia populations decrease
whereas monocytes significantly increase in the stroke brain compared to sham. After stroke, BRDU incorporation into
monocytes in the bone marrow increased. After recruitment to the ischemic brain, these monocytes accounted for
nearly all BRDU-positive macrophages. Inflammatory activity peaked at 72 h. Microglia produced relatively higher reactive
oxygen species and TNF, whereas monocytes were the predominant IL-1β producer. Although microglia showed
enhanced phagocytic activity after stroke, monocytes had significantly higher phagocytic capacity at 72 h. Interestingly,
we found a positive correlation between TNF expression levels and phagocytic activity of microglia after stroke.
Conclusions: In summary, the resident microglia population is vulnerable to the effects of severe ischemia, show
compromised cell cycle progression, and adopt a largely pro-inflammatory phenotype after stroke. Infiltrating monocytes
are primarily involved with early debris clearance of dying cells. These findings suggest that the early wave of infiltrating
monocytes may be beneficial to stroke repair and future therapies aimed at mitigating microglia cell death may prove
more effective than attempting to elicit targeted anti-inflammatory responses from damaged cells.

Introduction
Inflammation is a key component of stroke-induced
injury and elevated levels of inflammatory markers are
associated with poor outcome in stroke patients [1–4].
Inflammation in the brain is generally mediated by
microglia, the resident macrophage of the CNS [5]. In
the protected confines of the blood–brain barrier, microglia maintain healthy brain function by clearing debris,
pruning synapses, and producing growth/repair factors

[6]. These cells stand poised to respond to injuries in the
CNS such as ischemic stroke. Numerous experimental
studies have shown that microglia become activated
following stroke, notably shifting their morphology from
a thin, ramified state to a large, amoeboid structure [7].
This change is generally thought to be accompanied by
an increase in proliferation and production of inflammatory mediators. Yet despite the evidence for widespread
recruitment of bone marrow-derived monocytes (and
their derivatives) to injured brain regions and a lack of
discriminate cell markers, little is known regarding the
functional differences between these two myeloid populations in ischemic stroke. Given the high degree of

macrophage heterogeneity that comprises our innate immune system, the functional role of these populations is
likely distinct and of translational importance [8–11].
CNS-resident microglia are the first responders to ischemia; these cells likely serve a unique role in injury repair
relative to monocytes, which have a finite lifespan and
are recruited in higher numbers during the postreperfusion phase from the periphery. These differences
have been made evident in recent studies that utilize
transgenic bone marrow chimeras to distinguish between local and circulating myeloid populations [12].
These potentially disparate roles suggest that drugs
designed to modulate microglia function may adversely
impact that of the infiltrating monocyte population.
In this study, we investigated functional differences
between brain-resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes in acute ischemic injury to better understand the
contribution of each population to the recovery phase of
stroke. Using flow cytometry to discriminate between
these two populations, we applied ex-vivo functional assays to ascertain their functional roles during stroke and
early recovery. By identifying the distinct function of
microglia and monocytes early after ischemic stroke, the
potential for targeting these specific cell populations will
allow for the development of more effective therapeutic
interventions.

Materials and methods
Mice/animals

Young adult C57BL/6 J male mice (10–12 weeks) of age
were pair-housed on sawdust bedding in a pathogen free
facility (light cycle 12/12 h light/dark). All animals had
access to chow and water ad libitum. All procedures
were performed in accordance with NIH guidelines for
the care and use of laboratory animals and approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
University of Connecticut Health Center. All analyses
were performed blinded to surgical conditions.
Ischemic stroke model

Cerebral ischemia was induced by 90 min of reversible
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO, 20–25 gm
mice) under isoflurane anesthesia as previously described
[13]. Rectal temperatures were maintained at approximately 37 °C during surgery and ischemia with an automated temperature control feedback system. A midline
ventral neck incision was made, and unilateral MCAO
was performed by inserting a 6.0 Doccol monofilament
(Doccol Corp, Redlands, CA, USA) into the right internal
carotid artery 6 mm from the internal carotid/pterygopalatine artery bifurcation via an external carotid artery
stump. Following reperfusion mice were sacrificed at 24
and 72 h and 7 days. Sham-operated animals underwent

Page 2 of 12

the same surgical procedure, but the suture was not
advanced into the internal carotid artery.
Tissue harvesting

Mice were euthanized, transcardially perfused with
60 mL cold, sterile PBS, and the brains were harvested.
The brainstem, cerebellum, and olfactory bulbs were removed. The brain was then divided along the interhemispheric fissure into two hemispheres and subsequently
rinsed with PBS to remove contaminant cells.
Flow cytometry

Brains were placed in complete Roswell Park Memorial
Institute (RPMI) 1640 (Lonza) medium and mechanically and enzymatically digested in collagenase/dispase
(1 mg/mL) and DNAse (10 mg/mL; both Roche Diagnostics) for 1 h at 37 °C. The cell suspension was filtered
through a 70 um filter. Leukocytes were harvested from
the interphase of a 70 %/30 % Percoll gradient. Cells were
washed and blocked with mouse Fc Block (eBioscience)
prior to staining with primary antibody-conjugated flourophores: CD45-eF450, CD11b-APCeF780, Ly6C-PerCPCy5.5, Ly6G-PE, and SIRPα-APC. All antibodies were
commercially purchased from eBioscience. For live/dead
discrimination, a fixable viability dye, carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester (CASE-AF350, Invitrogen), was diluted at
1:300 from a working stock of 0.3 mg/mL. Cells were
briefly fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde (PFA). Data were acquired on a LSRII using FACSDiva 6.0 (BD Biosciences)
and analyzed using FlowJo (Treestar Inc.). No less than
100,000 events were recorded for each sample. Resident
microglia were identified as the CD45int CD11b+Ly6C−
population, whereas bone marrow-derived leukocytes
were identified as CD45hiCD11b+Ly6C+Ly6G−. Cell typematched fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls were
used to determine the positivity of each antibody. Prior to
assessment on the cytometer, isolated cells were briefly
probed to determine phagocytosis activity, oxidative stress
level, cell proliferation status, and cytokine production as
described below.
Phagocytosis bead assay

To study the phagocytic activity of microglia, fluorescent latex beads (Fluoresbrite Yellow Green (YG) carboxylate microspheres; 1um diameter; Polysciences)
were added to sorted microglia in a final dilution of
1:100 as described [14]. After 1-h incubation at 37 °C,
the cells were washed three times with FACS buffer, resuspended in FACS buffer, stained for surface markers,
and fixed in PFA (N = 6/group). Mean fluorescence was
determined from the YG bead + microglia population
and used to measure the amount of beads per phagocytosing cell [15].

Reactive oxygen species measurement

For detection of reactive oxygen species, microglial cells
were incubated with redox-sensitive DHR (5uM; Ex/Em:
495/520) fluorogenic cell-permeant dye (Life Technologies,
Invitrogen). Cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C,
washed three times with FACS buffer (without NaAz), and
then stained for surface markers including CASE (N = 5/
group). After loading cells with DHR, each sample was
separated into two tubes, one kept on ice and one at 37 °C.
BRDU labeling and analysis

For cell proliferation studies, 50 mg/kg of BRDU (Sigma)
was injected interperitoneally starting at 12 h after reperfusion and again at 24 and 48 h. BRDU staining was
assessed using a BRDU Flow Kit (BD Biosciences). In
brief, cells were permeabilized with detergent and treated
with DNAse prior to the addition of both anti-BRDUFITC antibody and Ki67-PE (eBioscience).
Intracellular cytokine production

For intracellular cytokine staining, an in vivo brefeldin A
(BFA) protocol was followed. Briefly, 10 mL/kg of BFA
(Sigma, 0.5 mg/mL in DMSO) was injected via tail vein.
Ten hours later, animals were sacrificed and tissue was
harvested as noted above. Prior to staining, 1 ul of GolgiPlug containing brefeldin A (BD Biosciences) was added to
800 ul complete RPMI and cells were incubated for 2 h at
37 °C (5 % CO2). Afterward, cells were re-suspended in Fc
Block, stained for surface antigens and washed in 100 ul of
fixation/permeabilization solution (BD Biosciences) for
20 min. Microglia were then washed twice in 300 ul
permeabilization/wash buffer (BD Biosciences), resuspended in an intracellular antibody cocktail containing
TNF-PE-Cy7 (eBioscience) and IL-1β-FITC (eBioscience)
and subsequently fixed (N = 5-7/group).
Bone marrow chimera generation

Wildtype C57BL/6 J mice (8 weeks old) were lethally irradiated (two doses of 5–6 Gy) in a Gammacell 40 research
irradiator, and 5 × 105 nucleated GFP-expressing donor
bone marrow cells were injected retro-orbitally [16].
Chimeras were maintained on sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim antibiotics in their drinking water 1 day prior and
2 weeks following irradiation. Chimeras were used for
experiments 10 weeks following transplantation.
Statistical analyses

Data from individual experiments are presented as
mean ± SEM and assessed by Student’s t test or one-way
ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test for multiple comparisons (GraphPad Prism Software Inc, San Diego, CA,
USA). For two-way ANOVA, significant differences between paired comparisons were conducted with the
Holm-Sidak test. The Spearman’s rank correlation test

Page 3 of 12

was used to ascertain the correlation between cytokine
production and phagocytic activity. Significance was set
at p < 0.05.

Results
Ischemic stroke induces microglial death, bone marrow
production of monocytes, and recruitment of monocytes
to the injured brain

We confirmed the ability to reliably distinguish CD45int
microglia from CD45hi monocyte populations in the ischemic brain by generating GFP bone marrow chimeras,
in which all bone marrow-derived cells were GFP-positive
(Additional file 1: Figure S1A). We demonstrated that the
two populations did not significantly overlap after stroke,
validating this approach. Absolute leukocyte counts were obtained by flow cytometry at 24 and 72 h after MCAO in
non-irradiated, intact wild type mice using the gating strategy
shown in Fig. 1a, b. A significant reduction in the number of
microglia (CD45intCD11b+Ly6C−) after stroke was found
after 24 h (p < 0.05; Fig. 1c). Conversely, we found a dramatic
increase in monocyte (CD45hiCD11b+Ly6C+Ly6G−) counts
in the stroke hemisphere compared to sham brain (Fig. 1d).
At 72 h, microglia expressed increased levels of Ki67, a
marker of actively cycling cells (p = 0.017; Fig. 2a, b). DNA
synthesis, an indicator of cell proliferation, was then measured by BRDU incorporation. Following repeated BRDU injections starting at 12 h, microglia showed little BRDU
incorporation by 72 h, whereas ~90 % of monocytes in the
ischemic brain were BRDU-positive (Fig. 2c, d). Stroke is
known to stimulate bone marrow production of myeloid
cells that are subsequently recruited to the brain [17]. We
found a significant increase in the percentage of BRDU+
monocytes in the bone marrow following stroke (p = 0.016;
Fig. 2e, f). These data suggest that after 90-min tMCAO,
there is a significant loss of resident microglia, impaired cell
cycle progression, and an increased number of newly produced, bone marrow-derived monocytes.
Differential oxidative stress and cytokine production by
microglia and monocytes after stroke

Reactive oxygen species production drives the oxidative
stress response to stroke and is critical to injury progression [18]. We examined free radical formation in microglia and monocytes after stroke. Resident microglia
expressed significantly more ROS relative to the infiltrating monocytes (p < 0.01), as evidenced by increased
DHR123 staining intensity (Fig. 3a, b). Because oxidative
stress precipitates cytokine production, we next evaluated
pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in these cells. Newly recruited monocytes expressed higher levels of TNF at 24 h;
however, microglia expressed significantly greater levels by
72 h (Fig. 3c, d). Infiltrating monocytes expressed relatively higher levels of IL-1β at all time points (p < 0.001;
Fig. 3e, f). The number of microglia expressing TNF

gating strategy used to identify both brain-resident microglia and Ly6C+ monocytes at 72 h after 90-min MCAO (a, b). Absolute cell counts of
microglia (c) and monocytes (d) were quantified at 0, 24, and 72 h after stroke. For all experiments, N = 9/group. Error bars show mean SEM.

remained elevated above sham levels at 7 days, whereas
those expressing IL-1β did not differ. Neither microglia
nor brain-recruited monocytes expressed detectable levels
of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 after
stroke (data not shown). These results suggest that microglia play a critical role in oxidative injury and that these
two cell types may mediate cell death via distinct signaling
pathways.
Monocytes are the predominant phagocytes in the brain
at 72 h after stroke

Microglia in the ischemic hemisphere were significantly
more activated based on side scatter (granularity) properties compared to sham, suggesting enhanced uptake of
dying cells and debris (Fig. 4a, b). Phagocytosis is important in debris clearance and injury repair. Using a
bead assay, we measured phagocytic activity of microglia
and monocytes (Fig. 4c). After stroke, the percentage of
microglia that phagocytosed beads significantly increased
at 24 h (p < 0.001) and peaked at a near four-fold increase by 72 h (p < 0.01; Fig. 4d). The phagocytic activity
of microglia is restored back to baseline levels by 7 days.
Compared to microglia, however, infiltrating monocytes
exhibited far greater capacity for phagocytosis. Significantly more monocytes were bead-positive as were the
number of beads phagocytosed per cell as evidenced by
MFI (p < 0.001; Fig. 4e). Monocytes at 72 h also expressed

significantly higher levels of the phagocytic marker SIRPα
than did microglia (p = 0.005; Fig. 4f, g). Interestingly,
phagocytic microglia were more likely to express TNF and
at higher levels than non-phagocytic microglia, indicating
that pro-inflammatory (M1) markers may overlap with
anti-inflammatory (M2) function (Fig. 5a, b). Moreover, a
positive correlation was found between the level of TNF
production and the number of beads phagocytosed by
microglia after stroke (p = 0.0167; Fig. 5c). Taken together,
these data imply that microglia do increase phagocytic activity following stroke stimulus, albeit at significantly
lower levels than recruited monocytes.

Discussion
We demonstrate for the first time that the increase in
macrophage proliferation in the brain following severe
tMCAO is a result of stimulus-driven bone marrow production of migrant monocytes rather than proliferation
of microglia. Resident microglia, as bystanders to ischemia, are similarly vulnerable to its detrimental effects.
We found that after a 90-min MCA occlusion, the number of microglia is significantly less than that seen in
sham brain. Traditionally, the use of standard immunohistochemistry could not make this distinction; possibly
overestimating the microglial response leads to the concept that microglia are highly proliferative, even after severe ischemic injuries. Indeed, the microglia population

microglia at 72 h after stroke (a). The percentages of Ki67+ microglia were quantified (b). BRDU incorporation of myeloid cells was assessed in the
brain using flow cytometry. A representative dot plot illustrates that resident microglia had not undergone DNA synthesis by 72 h in the ischemic
brain (c). Quantification of BRDU+ cells revealed that nearly all monocytes had entered S phase of proliferation (d). Analysis of bone marrow
revealed that stroke-induced production of monocytes likely account for BRDU+ monocytes in the brain (e, f). For all experiments, N = 5/group.

in general appears to be severely compromised after
stroke. It is not known whether the microglial population replenishes itself during recovery or if invading
monocytes establish permanent residence and take over
the microglial niche [19, 20].
Although microglia and monocytes exhibit several features of pro-inflammatory activation after stroke, several
studies suggest a supportive and even beneficial role for
each in stroke outcome [21–27]. These outcomes are
likely influenced by the degree of ischemic severity and
the ischemic setting/conditions. Distinguishing brain-

resident microglia from monocyte populations in ischemic brains that have high numbers of infiltrating leukocytes can be challenging. Due to the lack of available
microglia-specific markers, the absolute identification of
microglia can be hampered by up-regulation of CD45
expression on activated microglia after injury, which can
cause overlap with bone marrow-derived macrophage
populations [28–30]. Bone marrow chimeras allowed us
to differentiate between all fluorescently tagged bone
marrow-derived leukocytes from resident microglia, definitively confirming that microglial expression of CD45

is relatively stable after stroke. However, to further ensure the purity of our microglial gating strategy, we selected out any contaminating monocytes using Ly6C
antibody, which is not expressed on adult microglia.
These findings enabled us to provide a reliable functional assessment of resident microglia and recruited
monocyte populations by ex-vivo flow cytometry.
Recent work from the Merad laboratory has elegantly
demonstrated that there is little bone marrow or systemic
contribution to the resident microglia pool under normal
conditions [31, 32]. These observations were made using
donor-tagged bone marrow chimeras and parabiotic mice.
Consistent with these findings, our group has also found
that as far out as 1 year following radiation, uninjured
chimeras had less than 5 % “microglia-like” monocytes
as evidenced by their CD45intCD11b+GFP+Ly6C+ phenotype, reminiscent of the resident CD45intCD11b+GFP−

microglia population (data not shown). Although these
findings imply there is a low frequency of monocyte mixing in the resident CD45int microglia population of irradiated chimeras, these bone marrow-derived GFP+ cells can
still be distinguished by the expression of Ly6C. Although
useful, chimera development and parabiotic manipulation
have limitations, including the potential for radiation injury and immune activation from the invasive surgical
stress, respectively. Importantly, other studies have found
that following an injury to the CNS, recruited monocytes
can down-regulate Ly6C expression and establish permanent residence, thereby replenishing the attenuated microglia pool [19, 33]. The acute time points described in our
study are unlikely to be affected by the down-regulation of
Ly6C on monocytes as earlier studies have shown that this
does not occur until after 7 days post-injury. While the
genotoxic elimination of the microglia in mice appears to

increase in side scatter (granularity) properties of microglia at 72 h after stroke (red) compared to sham (blue; a). Mean side scatter intensity of
microglia was quantified at different time points after MCAO (N = 5/group; b). Phagocytic activity after stroke was measured by bead assay using
flow cytometry (c). The percentages and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of bead+ cells were quantified at 0, 24, and 72 h and 7 days (N = 6/

be non-deleterious in the short-term, the long-term consequences of microglia removal are likely detrimental to
CNS homeostasis as evidenced in several neurodegenerative models [34–37]. The long-term consequences of
microglia elimination in necrotic regions following ischemic stroke warrants further investigation.
We show that microglia numbers are decreased at
72 h after a 90-min tMCAO and noted an inverse correlation between microglia and infiltrating monocyte
counts. This is in contrast to several reports that have
shown significant increases in microglia proliferation
[38–40]. However, it is likely that the severity of the
ischemic injury plays a major role in the microglial
response as other work has shown reduced microglial
populations with more severe injury (e.g., longer

occlusion times) [41]. Previous work has shown that the
morphological changes that accompany glial cell activation after stroke are not dependent on or coincident
with neuronal death but rather the duration of ischemia
[42]. Microglia are more ischemia-resistant than neurons
and oligodendrocytes, but clearly, they are also vulnerable
to severe ischemia [43–45]. The inability to distinguish
microglia from infiltrating monocytes, which increase in
number with injury severity using histological methods,
may further obfuscate this issue. Flow cytometry may provide a more sensitive means of identification of cell type
based on the well-accepted relative surface expression of
CD45. Depending on the compensation setup, overlapping
of these cell populations may also occur with flow cytometry. However, we have shown that it is extremely useful to

Fig. 5 Relationship between TNF production and phagocytic activity of microglia after stroke. A representative dot plot shows the relationship
between microglial TNF production and phagocytic activity at 24 h (a). The percentage of TNF+ microglia is significantly higher in the phagocytic
subset of microglia compared to the non-phagocytic subset (N = 5/group; b). A positive correlation was found between the MFI of TNF expression in
microglia and number of beads they phagocytosed after stroke (c). Cell-specific FMO controls were used to determine positive gating. Error bars show
mean SEM. Abbreviation: SEM standard error of the mean, SSC side scatter, MFI mean fluorescence intensity, a.u.i. arbitrary units of intensity. *p < 0.05

use Ly6C as a monocyte marker to achieve maximal separation of these two populations, as infiltrating monocytes
may down-regulate CD45 and MHCII levels over time,
adopting a microglia-like phenotype (CD45intCD11b+) [33].
Increased production of bone marrow-derived myeloid
cells after stroke has been described [17]. We found that
BRDU is incorporated into many newly produced monocytes in the bone marrow, which are subsequently recruited into the brain. This is consistent with recent
work showing ischemic stroke activates hematopoietic
stem cells in the bone marrow, resulting in a myeloid
bias and greater output of monocytes [46]. The number
of BRDU-positive myeloid cells in the brain reaches its
peak by 72 h [38, 41]. This parallels the time course of
leukocyte infiltration into the brain, which also peaks at
72 h. Although microglia did not enter S phase in our
study, many were Ki67+, indicating that they were actively cycling at 72 h. Ki67 expression in activated
microglia after stroke has also been documented [47].
The failure of most cells to progress through later stages
of the cell cycle may also be due to altered length of G1
and/or cellular stress [48]. Based on this earlier work
and given the differential effects of ischemia on microglia populations located throughout the hemisphere, we
hypothesized that some of these cells would enter the S

phase of cell cycle to begin dividing prior to 72 h. Surprisingly, we did not observe this trend. An earlier study
using GFP bone marrow chimeras revealed that the vast
majority of macrophages in the infarct area after a
30-min tMCAO were derived from local microglia [49].
Despite the smaller injuries and altered leukocyte kinetics that result from shorter occlusion times, the ability
to assess microglia numbers after stroke in an unbiased
fashion using immunohistochemistry can be challenging
due to the subtle difficulty of identifying microglia in
their ramified state relative to those with amoeboid
morphology and given the rapid migration of activated
microglia into the penumbral region often present in the
field of view. As such, shifts in population densities due
to migration towards injury sites could be misinterpreted
as local microglia proliferation. It should be noted,
however, that our data do not exclude the possibility that
microglia proliferation occurs beyond 72 h in the
90-min tMCAO model.
A recent study of microglia proliferation after stroke was
elegantly approached by implementing the parabiosis
model using wild type and CX3CR1GFP/− mice [50]. The
authors concluded that microglia proliferation accounted
for the majority of microgliosis observed after stroke, rather
than monocyte infiltration. However, there are several

Ritzel et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2015) 12:106

possible explanations for the disparate results. The
CX3CR1-GFP signal in these reporter mice is not specific
only to microglia, especially following an injury stimulus, as
it has been shown that Ly6Clo monocytes also express GFP
[30, 51, 52]. As histological analyses would not be able to
distinguish GFP+ microglia from GFP+ monocytes (or vice
versa in non-GFP WT mice), these cells largely go undetected as they typically begin migrating to the brain
within 12–24 h of injury. In addition, this study used a
smaller, more localized injury induced photothrombosis,
resulting in a milder inflammatory response. The stimulusdriven production of monocytes in bone marrow in this
milder injury would likely be less and further diluted following egress into the blood due to the ~50 % equilibrium
of circulating cells in parabiotic (GFP-WT) mice. These
studies provide valuable information in the context of both
the specific model of stroke being employed, the severity of
ischemia, and the time points being investigated. Taken together, these authors nicely demonstrate that microglia
proliferation occurs early after stroke under mild or modest ischemic conditions, whereas our data implies this
function is likely compromised after severe ischemic injury.
Oxidative stress and cytokine-induced cell death are
key components of ischemic injury. Reperfusion after
ischemia produces a burst in ROS formation [53].
Oxidative stress increases within the first hour after reperfusion and delivers signals that promote necrosis and
apoptosis. The generation of ROS burst activity results
from impaired mitochondrial respiratory chain function
and activation of cytoplasmic oxidases. As a result, oxidative stress contributes directly to necrosis and apoptosis through a number of pathways in ischemic tissue.
Although neurons and endothelial cells are important
sources of ROS, all cells subject to ischemic injury are
vulnerable to ROS-mediated cell death signaling [54].
The massive influx of ROS producing infiltrating leukocytes adds considerably to the overall ROS levels in the
brain after stroke. Using bone marrow chimeras, a
recent study demonstrated that NADPH oxidase
(NOX2)-mediated ROS production in circulating leukocytes contributed to exacerbated infarct volumes compared to that produced by resident microglia after stroke
[55]. Although we found that ROS levels were higher in
microglia after stroke, we did not evaluate the other
subsets of infiltrating myeloid cells, namely neutrophils.
Instead, we show that on cell-to-cell basis, monocytes
produce significantly less ROS after stroke than resident
microglia. This may reflect the severely compromised
state of microglia following ischemic reperfusion.
Injury-driven production of ROS can further amplify
the inflammatory response by driving cytokine production. TNF and IL-1β are produced by both microglia and
monocytes after stroke. Numerous studies using transgenic
mice and pharmacological agents have demonstrated a

neurotoxic role for each of these pro-inflammatory cytokines in ischemic injury [56, 57]. Our finding that microglia
produced higher levels of ROS and TNF after stroke than
monocytes suggest that the resident cells may be the more
detrimental macrophage early after injury. Excessive insult
to resident microglia may impair their primary function to
maintain brain homeostasis during recovery. These findings build on previous work which described the expression of these cytokines in different subsets of microglia and
macrophages 24 h after permanent MCAO using a bone
marrow chimera approach combined with immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry [58]. The authors reported
that a greater number of CD11b+ CD45hi macrophages/
granulocytes expressed TNF and IL-1β at 24 h compared
to CD11b+ CD45dim microglia. While innovative in its design, the use of GR-1 to distinguish between and identify
monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils is not as accurate
as Ly6C/Ly6G markers [51]. Despite this discrepancy, we
found similar expression profiles in these two populations
at 24 h, whereas microglia became the predominant TNF
producers by peak leukocyte infiltration at 72 h. The importance of TNF signaling to ischemic injury was recently
evaluated [59]. Using bone marrow chimeras, it was found
that TLR2- and TLR4-mediated injury is primarily driven
by infiltrating leukocytes rather than resident microglia.
However, TNF is also produced by microglia early after ischemia prior to monocyte infiltration, and TNF-directed
therapies at these early time points are neuroprotective
[60, 61]. However, it must also be noted that infiltrating
monocytes expressed higher levels of IL-1β, a cytokine
associated with inflammasome signaling [62, 63]. This
implies that inflammatory signaling in macrophage populations is incredibly robust and complex. Further understanding of these differences between these two cell
subtypes and their inflammatory function after stroke may
provide better insight on the targeted effects of known
drug treatments, allowing for the development of more
effective, cell-specific drugs.
Following ischemia, injured areas of the brain undergo
apoptosis. Dead and dying cells generate a vast amount
of debris that requires clearance for regenerative processes to ensue. As the ischemic/reperfusion injury core
evolves after 24 h, amoeboid microglia migrate from the
core to the transition zone of the penumbral area following reperfusion and adopt an M1 phenotype [64, 65].
The importance of debris clearance by phagocytes is
evident in rodents and humans lacking the scavenger
receptor gene CD36, resulting in exacerbated injury and
hematoma absorption in models of ICH [66, 67]. MRI
imaging has demonstrated that USPIO particles can be
tracked and localized to ED1+ microglia/macrophages
with the highest signal intensities found in striatal and
cortical penumbral regions at day 2 after 30 min tMCAO
in rats [68]. Using GFP bone marrow chimeras, an earlier

Ritzel et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2015) 12:106

study had shown that activated microglia phagocytose
neuronal material as early as 24 h and are the predominant phagocyte by day 7 [69]. While an early preponderance of phagocytic microglia would be expected given the
delayed recruitment of monocytes, their use of a less
severe, 30-min tMCA occlusion resulted in attenuated
numbers of infiltrating monocytes. In another study, rats
that had undergone a 3-hr tMCAO exhibited poor microglial phagocytosis of caspase-3-expressing neurons at 24 h
[24]. Moreover, the number of apoptotic neurons was not
increased following liposome-mediated ablation of microglia, indicating a limited contribution to debris clearance
in environments that are significantly impacted by ischemia. Injury-related defects in migration and increased
cytokine repulsion signals may halt microglia phagocytic
activity under increasing ischemic stress.
We provide the first functional evidence that microglia increase capacity for phagocytosis in acute ischemic stroke.
The number of phagocytic microglia initially increased at
24 h, peaked at 72 h, and returned to baseline by 7 days.
These data paralleled the increase in microglia side scatter
properties (granularity) in separate experiments, further indication of phagocytic uptake. Interestingly, however, infiltrating monocytes were significantly more efficient at
phagocytosing material during the peak response at 72 h.
Following tissue entry, monocytes may further mature into
macrophage or dendritic cell subsets with tissue-specialized
functions. Monocyte-derivatives retain the expression of
lineage markers and have enhanced phagocytic ability [70].
Our findings indicate that while these tissue phagocytes exhibit many classical pro-inflammatory features deemed destructive, they appear to play a critical role in debris
clearance and post-stroke recovery. It may be that in
addition to being injured, many resident microglia had
already exhausted their capacity to phagocytize surplus debris prior to ex-vivo phagocytosis assessment. However, by
7 days after stroke, when monocytes diminish in the ischemic brain, resident microglia again become the predominant phagocyte, highlighting the importance of microglia in
the long-term recovery and repair process. Unpublished results from our laboratory suggest that circulating phagocyte
populations are generally more efficient than microglia at
phagocytizing material under non-stimulated conditions.
Recent work demonstrating the importance of monocytes
to hemorrhage clearance in a model of intracerebral
hemorrhage highlights their ability to significantly improve
long-term outcomes through phagocytic function early after
stroke [71]. This may relate in part to the degree of adaptive
functionality associated with their different life-spans, as
monocyte function may be more robust given their “boom
and bust” half-life, whereas the phagocytic activity of
microglia likely endures at a steady rate throughout life.
It is important to note that monocyte-targeted therapies aimed at inhibiting the function of these cells may

Page 10 of 12

inadvertently affect their phagocytic activity. Moreover,
strategies to exploit this capacity should be considered,
especially during the early stages of injury when the
blood–brain barrier is susceptible to monocyte entry.
Finally, we showed a positive correlation between TNF
expression levels and the level of phagocytic activity of
microglia after injury. ROS and pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling is thought to hamper phagocytic activity
and debris clearance [72, 73]. Our finding suggests that dichotomizing function into M1/M2 polarization, in which
cells are polarized to become either pro-inflammatory/
detrimental (M1) or anti-inflammatory/injury resolving
(M2) may be too simplistic [74]. This concept more aptly
applies to microglia in vitro and its polarization may be
better appreciated as a continuum of activation in vivo
due to the combination of factors and diverse cell types
present in intact tissue. Indeed, the polarization dynamics
of microglia and monocytes during stroke appear to be
mixed and complex. As mentioned, anti-inflammatory
markers such as IL-4 and IL-10 were not expressed by either myeloid cell at any time point in this study. However,
we acknowledge that transitioning between M1 and M2
phases may occur weeks after injury as has been reported
by others [5, 65]. Whether there is a requirement for proinflammatory signaling to induce or enhance phagocytic
activity and debris clearance is currently not known.
These findings point to a possible side effect of microglia/
macrophage inhibition that could hamper the removal of
dead cells and slow recovery.
In conclusion, we have identified distinct functional
roles for brain-resident and infiltrating macrophages
after stroke. To better both the interpretation of failed
clinical trials and the development of more efficacious
drugs to treat sterile inflammation in the CNS requires a
better understanding of potential cellular targets. We
believe that functional assessment of immune cells after
stroke ex-vivo could be a powerful tool in screening and
validating the targeted cellular effects of drugs and
various therapeutic interventions.

microglia at 72 hrs after stroke. Bone marrow chimeras were generated
using GFP+ donors and wildtype recipient mice. Microglial CD45
expression level was evaluated to determine if their CD45-intermediate
expression level is increased after stroke, potentially overlapping with the
CD45-high expressing bone marrow-derived myeloid population. A
representative dot plot of the ischemic brain at 72 hrs illustrates that
GFP− (wildtype) microglia do not substantially increase CD45 expression
to CD45-high levels associated with GFP+ bone marrow-derived populations
(98 % GFP reconstitution in this wildtype host; S1A). Cell-specific FMO
controls were used to determine positive gating.
