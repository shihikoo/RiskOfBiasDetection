Abstract Inflammatory damage plays a pivotal, mainly
detrimental role in cerebral ischemic pathogenesis and may
represent a promising target for treatment. Naringenin
(NG) has gained growing appreciation for its beneficial
biological effects through its anti-inflammatory property.
Whether this protective effect applies to cerebral ischemic
injury, we therefore investigate the potential neuroprotective role of NG and the underlying mechanisms. Focal
cerebral ischemia in male Sprague–Dawley rats was
induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
(pMCAO) and NG was pre-administered intragastrically
once daily for four consecutive days before surgery. Neurological deficit, brain water content and infarct volume
were measured at 24 h after stroke. Immunohistochemistry,
Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to explore the antiinflammatory potential of NG in the regulation of NOD2,
RIP2 and NF-jB in ischemic cerebral cortex. Additionally,
the activities of MMP-9 and claudin-5 were analyzed to
detect NG’s influence on blood–brain barrier. Compared
with pMCAO and Vehicle groups, NG noticeably
improved neurological deficit, decreased infarct volume

and edema at 24 h after ischemic insult. Consistent with
these results, our data also indicated that NG significantly
downregulated the expression of NOD2, RIP2, NF-jB and
MMP-9, and upregulated the expression of claudin-5
(P \ 0.05). The results provided a neuroprotective profile
of NG in cerebral ischemia, this effect was likely exerted
by down-regulated NOD2, RIP2, NF-jB, MMP-9 and upregulated claudin-5 expression.

Introduction
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and the most
common cause of permanent disability in adult population
[1]. Mounting evidence has advocated that cerebral ischemia is accompanied by a significant inflammatory cascade
which is reinforced by the interaction of diversified
inflammatory mediators and supposed to exacerbate the
dimension of the ischemic injury [2–5]. The striking correlation between inflammatory injury and ischemic stroke
has initiated considerable interest in seeking anti-inflammatory therapies to combat ischemia-induced damage.
The nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptors 2
(NOD2) is characterized as an intracytoplasmic pattern
recognition receptor (PRR) which has been identified as a
key detector of intracellular microbes and possibly danger
signals. Ligation of NOD2 by its ligand has been shown to
signal its downstream adaptor proteins, receptor-interacting
protein 2 (RIP2) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-jB) [6].
Recently, studies have highlighted a significant role for
NOD2 in both renal ischemia–reperfusion injury and
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury [7, 8]. Moreover, the

importance of NOD2 is underlined by the activation of
RIP2 which subsequently results in potentiating the ubiquitinylation of IKKc/NF-jB essential modifier (NEMO)
linking to the activation of NF-jB and culminating in NFjB gene expression [9]. Particularly in the brain, NF-jB
regulates a wide array of pro-inflammatory genes, such as
cyclooxygenase-2, tumor necrosis factor-a, inducible nitric
oxide synthase and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9),
all of which play a crucial role in cerebral ischemic damage
[10]. Thus, abrogation the NOD2/RIP2/NF-jB signaling
cascade may hold therapeutic potential to attenuate
inflammation-mediated brain injury after ischemic stroke.
Naringenin (5,7,4-trihydroxyflavanone, NG) (Fig. 1), a
naturally occurring flavanone in grapefruits and tomatoes,
has been demonstrated to elicit a wide range of pharmacological and biological activities, including anti-inflammatory [11], anti-oxidative [12] and anti-apoptotic [13].
Especially, a large volume of literature has interpreted its
anti-inflammatory property in various ailments [14–16].
Importantly, its lipophilic character favors a good blood–
brain barrier (BBB)-permeability [17, 18]. The protective
effects of NG on the central nervous system have been well
documented in Parkinson’s disease [19] and Alzheimer’s
disease [20]. Recently, Raza et al. [21] reported NG could
also alleviate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, suggesting its neuroprotective potential in ischemic damage.
Hitherto, however, the exact role and underlying mechanism of NG in permanent cerebral ischemia is not clear.
Based on the previously mentioned data, we undertook
the present study to decipher whether NG had the neuroprotective effect on permanent ischemic damage and if so
what were the potential molecular mechanisms?

Methods and Materials

Male Sprague–Dawley rats, weighted 230–280 g, were
supplied by the Laboratory Animal Centre of Hebei Medical University. The experimental protocol was approved
by the institutional animal care and use committee and the
local experimental ethics committee and conformed to
internationally accept ethical standards. All rats were
housed under diurnal lighting condition (12/12 h light/dark
cycle with humidity of 60 ± 5 %, 22 ± 3 °C) and allowed
food and water adlibitum. All efforts were made to alleviate animal suffering, to minimize the number of animals
used, and to utilize alternatives to in vivo techniques, if
permitted. One hundred and fifty rats were randomly
divided into five groups (30 rats in each group): Sham
group that received equal volume carboxymethylcellulose
(Sham); permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
(pMCAO) group that received equal volume 0.9 % NaCl
and pMCAO (pMCAO); Vehicle group that received equal
volume sodium carboxymethylcellulose and pMCAO
(Vehicle); low dose group that received NG at 50 mg/kg
before pMCAO (NG-L) and high dose group that received
NG at 100 mg/kg before pMCAO (NG-H).
Rat Model of Permanent Focal Cerebral Ischemia
A standard model of pMCAO was used to make permanent
focal ischemia as previously described [22, 23]. Briefly,
rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg). In anesthetized rats, the
right side of common carotid artery was exposed and isolated. MCA was occluded by inserting a monofilament
nylon suture with a heat-rounded tip into the internal carotid artery, which was advanced further until it closed the
origin of the MCA. During the experiments, MCA blood
flow was monitored using a blood flow monitor (moorVMS-LDF, Moor Instruments Ltd, UK) with a fiber optic
probe, adhered onto the skull surface of core area supplied
by the MCA (6 mm lateral and 2 mm posterior from the
bregma) before and after clamping the right MCA. Rats
that showed a decrease in percentage of MCA blood flow
\70–80 % of the initial value were excluded. Rectal
temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C by means of a
heating blanket and heating lamp throughout the surgery.
Sham-operated control rats received the same surgical
procedure without inserting a filament.

Ethical Approval
Drug Administration
All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering. All
experimental procedures were carried out in strict accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and were approved by
the institutional care of experimental animals committee.

Immunohistochemical Staining

Evaluation of Neurological Deficit
Neurological deficit scores were evaluated by an examiner
blinded to the experimental groups at 24 h after pMCAO
following a modified scoring system based on that developed from Longa et al. [22] and Ding et al. [24], as follows:
0, no deficits; 1, difficulty in fully extending the contralateral forelimb; 2, unable to extend the contralateral
forelimb; 3, mild circling to the contralateral side; 4, severe
circling; and 5, falling to the contralateral side. The higher
the neurological deficit score, the more severe impairment
of motor motion injury. The rats were from groups of brain
water content, infarct volume, western blot and real-time
reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (n = 24).
Measurement of Brain Water Content
Brain water content was measured using the standard wetdry method. Six rats in each group were anesthetized with
pentobarbital sodium and killed by decapitation at 24 h
after pMCAO. The brains were quickly removed and
placed on a frozen surface. After dissecting free 4 mm of
frontal pole, a coronal brain slice (about 3 mm thick) was
cut and the slice was divided into the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. The two hemisphere slices packaged with pre-weighed tin foil were immediately weighed
on an electronic balance to obtain the wet weight, dried for
8 h in an oven at 120 °C, and then reweighed to obtain the
dry weight. Brain water content was calculated with the
equation as follows: Brain water content (%) = (wet
weight-dry weight)/wet weight 9 100 %.
Measurement of Infarct Volume
Infarct volume was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) at 24 h after pMCAO (n = 6 per group).
Animals were euthanized and the brains were quickly collected. Then the brain tissue was sliced into five coronal
sections (3 mm thick each) and stained with 2 % solution of
TTC at 37 °C for 20 min, followed by fixation with 4 %
paraformaldehyde. The normal tissue was stained deep red,
while the infarct area was stained a pale gray color. TTCstained sections were photographed and the digital images
were analyzed using image analysis software (Image-Pro
Plus 5.1). The lesion volume was calculated by multiplying
the area by the thickness of slices. To compensate for the
effect of brain edema, the percentage hemisphere lesion
volume was calculated by the following formula [25]:
%HLV = {[total infarct volume - (the volume of intact

The rats (n = 6 per group) were deep anesthetized and brains
were removed and immersed in 4 % paraformaldehyde over
24 h. Coronal brain slices containing third ventricle and basal
ganglia about 5 mm thick were cut after dissecting free 7 mm
frontal pole and embedded in paraffin. Standard histological
processing was performed for paraffin-embedded sections.
The slices were incubated with 3 % H2O2, 3 % normal goat
serum and incubated with interest primary antibodies respectively in 0.01 mol/l phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C overnight. Rabbit anti-rat NOD2 antibody (1:100, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), rabbit anti-rat RIP2 antibody (1:100, Enzo
Life Sciences, Inc), rabbit anti-rat NF-jB antibody (1:200,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to detect the expressions. Immunohistochemistry was performed via the avidin–
biotin technique, and then hematoxylin staining was selected
as counterstaining. The secondary antibodies, secondary biotinylated conjugates and diaminobenzidine were from the SP
rabbit kit (Cowin Biology Technology Company, China). An
examiner blinded to the experimental groups counted the cells
labeled with NOD2, RIP2, and NF-jB under a 4009 light
microscope. For each sample, three consecutive slices were
observed. First, the positive cells of each slice were counted in
five random visual fields of ischemic cortex around the infarct
core. The average positive cells of each slice were obtained by
divided the sum of the numbers counted from each field by
five, then the average positive cells of each sample were
obtained by calculating the average of the three slices. At last,
the average of each sample was used for statistical analysis.
Western Blot
The total protein and nuclear protein were extracted
respectively from rat ischemic and control cortex following
the manufacturer’s protocols (Applygen Technologies Inc.,
Beijing, China) at 24 h after pMCAO (n = 6 per group).
Protein concentration of the supernatant was determined
using a BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) with bovine serum albumin as the standard.
An equivalent amount of 50 lg total protein samples, as
well as 30 lg nuclear protein samples, was separated
respectively by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gels prior and transferred 2 h on to PVDF membranes
(Millipore Corporation, USA). After blocking 1 h with 5 %
non-fat dry milk in phosphate buffered saline (PBS),
membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit
polyclonal antibody anti-NOD2 antibody (1:500, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), anti-RIP2 antibody (1:500, Enzo Life
Sciences, Inc), anti-NF-jB antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz

Biotechnology), anti-MMP-9 antibody (1:800, Abcam),
anti-claudin-5 antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
and mouse polyclonal antibody anti-b-actin (1:500, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) antibody. The second day, membranes were washed with PBS containing 0.1 % Tween-20
(TPBS) (10 min 9 3) each time, and then incubated with
fluorescent labeling second antibodies (IRDyeÒ 800-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, or anti-mouse 1:8000 dilution,
Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) for 1 h at room temperature.
Membranes were then again washed with TPBS
(10 min 9 3) and the relative density of bands was analyzed on an Odyssey infrared scanner (LI-COR Bioscience,
USA). The densitometric values were normalized with
respect to the values of b-actin immunoreactivity to correct
for any loading and transfer differences between samples.
Real-Time Reverse Transcription-Quantitative PCR
(RT-qPCR)
Total mRNA was extracted by using the Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and was reverse-transcribed
into cDNA using RevertAid first Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Fermentas International Inc, Burlington, Canada) for Quantitative PCR (MX 3005P, USA) in the presence of a fluorescent dye (SYBR Green I, Cwbio). Relative abundance of
mRNA was calculated after normalization to GAPDH ribosomal RNA. RT-qPCR was used to analyze the levels of
NOD2, NF-jB, MMP-9 and claudin-5 mRNA at 24 h after
pMCAO (n = 6 per group). The primers are as follows:
NOD2: F: ACTTACGATGGGTCGGAGAAT, R: GTGGGT

Statistical Analysis
All statistical results were expressed as mean ± SEM. Neurological deficit assessment was tested with One-way
ANOVA–Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Other data were
analyzed with ANOVA and followed by Student–Newman–
Keuls test. The significance level was set at P \ 0.05.

Results
NG Attenuated the Neurological Deficit
Neurological deficit was examined and scored on a sixpoint scale at 24 h after pMCAO (Fig. 2a). Compared with

123

Neurochem Res (2014) 39:1405–1415

pMCAO and Vehicle groups, the neurological deficit
scores were significantly reduced in NG-H group (pMCAO
group vs. NG-H group: 3.38 ± 0.16 vs. 2.67 ± 0.20,
P \ 0.05; Vehicle group vs. NG-H group: 3.42 ± 0.13 vs.
2.67 ± 0.20, P \ 0.05), but there was no significant effect
in NG-L group compared with pMCAO and Vehicle
groups at 24 h (pMCAO group vs. NG-L group:
3.38 ± 0.16 ± vs. 3.04 ± 0.13, P [ 0.05; Vehicle group
vs. NG-H group: 3.42 ± 0.13 vs. 3.04 ± 0.13, P [ 0.05).
NG Reduced Brain Edema
Brain water content at 24 h after ischemia was shown in
Fig. 2b. In the Sham group, the brain water content was
78.95 ± 0.35 %. Compared with pMCAO and Vehicle
groups, the brain water content of the ischemic hemisphere
showed a significant decline in NG-H group (pMCAO
group vs. NG-H group: 85.46 ± 0.40 vs. 83.17 ± 0.55 %,
P \ 0.05; Vehicle group vs. NG-H group: 85.15 ± 0.32
vs. 83.17 ± 0.55 %, P \ 0.05), but there was no significant effect in NG-L group compared with pMCAO and
Vehicle groups at 24 h (pMCAO group vs. NG-L group:
85.46 ± 0.40 vs. 84.36 ± 0.38 %, P [ 0.05; Vehicle
group vs. NG-H group: 85.15 ± 0.32 vs. 84.36 ± 0.38 %,
P [ 0.05).
NG Decreased Brain Infarct Volume
No infarction was observed in Sham group. In pMCAO and
Vehicle groups, an extensive lesion was found in both
striatum and lateral cortex (Fig. 2c, d). Compared with
pMCAO and Vehicle groups, the infarct volume was significantly decreased in NG-H group (pMCAO group vs.
NG-H group: 44.35 ± 2.23 vs. 34.44 ± 1.65 %, P \ 0.05;
Vehicle group vs. NG-H group: 44.42 ± 1.53 vs.
34.44 ± 1.65 %, P \ 0.05), but there was no significant
effect in NG-L group compared with pMCAO and Vehicle
groups at 24 h (pMCAO group vs. NG-L group:
44.35 ± 2.23 vs. 38.99 ± 2.54 %, P [ 0.05; Vehicle
group vs. NG-H group: 44.42 ± 1.53 vs. 38.99 ± 2.54 %,
P [ 0.05).
NG Down-Regulated the Expression of NOD2, RIP2
and NF-jB
Previous studies have demonstrated that NOD2, RIP2 and
NF-jB are important pro-inflammatory mediators involved
in ischemic brain injury. Then we sought to investigate
whether NG treatment influenced the expression of proinflammatory mediator in ischemic brain after pMCAO.
NOD2, RIP2 and NF-jB were examined respectively with
immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RT-qPCR at 24 h
after stroke. The result of immunohistochemistry showed

that few cells in the cortex of Sham group were reactive
with primary antibodies of NOD2, RIP2 and NF-jB.
However, the number of positive cells of NOD2, RIP2 and
NF-jB were significantly increased in pMCAO and Vehicle groups. Compared with pMCAO and Vehicle groups,
100 mg/kg naringenin but not 50 mg/kg significantly
decreased the number of positive cells of NOD2, RIP2 and
NF-jB in ischemic cortex at 24 h after pMCAO (P \ 0.05;
Figs. 3, 4a).
Consistent with the results of immunohistochemistry,
western blot analysis also showed that the protein levels of
NOD2, RIP2 and NF-jB were up-regulated in pMCAO and
Vehicle groups, compared with that in Sham group. High
dose NG significantly decreased the expressions of NOD2,
RIP2 and NF-jB at the protein level (P \ 0.05, Fig. 5).
However, there was no significant effect in NG-L group
compared with pMCAO and Vehicle groups (P [ 0.05).

RT-qPCR analysis was further performed to evaluate the
effect of NG on the expression of NOD2 and NF-jB at the
mRNA level in ischemic cortex (Fig. 4b, c). Cerebral
ischemia triggered the up-regulation of NOD2 and NF-jB
at the gene level. The mRNA expressions of NOD2 and
NF-jB were significantly weakened by pre-treatment with
high doses of NG (P \ 0.05), but low doses of NG did not
display this effect. (P [ 0.05).
NG Decreased the Expression of MMP-9 and Increased
the Expression of Claudin-5
MMP-9 and claudin-5 are supposed to be significant
functional indicators of BBB. Western blot (Fig. 6a–d) and
RT-qPCR (Fig. 6e, f) analysis were used to detect the
expression of MMP-9 and claudin-5 at 24 h after stroke. In
pMCAO and Vehicle groups, there was a significant

increase in the expression of MMP-9. The over-expressed
MMP-9 induced by ischemic injury in ischemic cortex was
significantly decreased in NG-H group when it was
examined with Western blot and RT-qPCR at 24 h after
stroke. In addition, pre-treatment with naringenin had a
beneficial role in the expression of tight junction protein
claudin-5 after ischemia. In consistent with previous study,
ischemic injury induced a greatly decreased expression of
claudin-5 which suggested the presence of disruption of
BBB integrity and function after ischemic stroke. In this
study, the expression of claudin-5 was significantly
increased in NG-H group at protein and gene levels at 24 h
(P \ 0.05) after ischemia. Although low dose of naringenin displayed some effects on inhibiting MMP-9 expression and preserving claudin-5 expression in ischemic brain,
no statistically significant differences were observed in
NG-L group compared with pMCAO and Vehicle groups
(P [ 0.05).

Discussion
pMCAO is a well-characterized and classical model to
study the mechanisms of cerebral ischemic damage [22,
23]. Within minutes after the onset of cerebral ischemia,
proinflammatory responses occur and exacerbate the progression of brain damage [26, 27]. Therefore, inhibition of
inflammatory responses at the early stage of cerebral
ischemia provides a potential therapeutic strategy [3, 5, 28–
30]. In current study, we found that pretreatment with NG
(100 mg/kg) improved neurological deficit, ameliorated
brain swelling and reduced infarct volume at 24 h after
ischemia. The underlying mechanisms may be involved in
down-regulating NOD2, RIP2, NF-jB, MMP-9 and upregulating claudin-5 expression.
Ischemic episode triggers a broad inflammatory reaction
in the brain, including activation of the innate immune
system. As innate immune system and inflammation are

relevant, recognition receptors in innate immunity were
extensive studied, especially the intracellular NOD2 which
has been supposed as a central regulator of immunity and
inflammation with demonstrated relevance to several diseases. Intracytoplasmic NOD2 is a member of intracytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors which originally is
characterized by detecting invading pathogens and activating innate immune responses for host defense [31].
Recent years, emerging evidence indicates that NOD2 has
evolved the capacity to sense danger signals perhaps
independently of a microbial trigger and can also be activated by a variety of endogenous molecules derived from
tissue injuries and elicit sterile inflammation [32]. When
cells become injured, danger associated molecular patterns
(DAMPs) from injured or necrosis cells can induce normally inactive NOD2 self-oligomerizated and activate
downstream signaling molecules, thus initiating a proinflammatory signaling cascade [33]. Former study has
demonstrated elevated expression of NOD2 during liver
injury and mice lacking NOD2 were protected from ConAinduced hepatitis [34]. What’ more, recent studies have

indicated NOD2 is also involved in the pathogenesis of
acute ischemic injury, and it has been gaining recognition
as a key contributor to the inflammatory response to neuronal injury in vitro and in vivo. Li et al. [8] reported that
NOD2 was highly expressed in microglia and neuron
during the oxygen-glucose deprivation in vitro and as such
was in cerebral ischemia–reperfusion in vivo, which may
indicate that NOD2 is a critical therapeutic target in
ischemic injury. Activation of NOD2 initiates a proinflammatory signaling cascade dependent on the recruitment
of their common adaptor protein RIP2 [6]. RIP2 is a
member of the RIP kinase family that has been shown to be
crucially involved in inflammation and immune responses
[35, 36]. Recent study has shown that RIP2 plays a pivotal
role in ischemic injury. Deficiency in RIP2 could protect
newborn mice against hypoxic-ischemic brain injury [37].
RIP2-deficiency can reduce the activation of NF-jB, JNK,
ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(p38MAPK) upon treatment with lipopolysaccharide in
macrophages [36, 40]. Excessive expression of RIP2 leads
to activation of the transcription factor NF-jB and the

c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) [35, 38, 39]. Furthermore, the
regulation of RIP2 involves a novel feed-forward regulatory mechanism: RIP2 could positively regulates NF-jB
activity, meanwhile inflammatory cytokines that activate
the NF-jB pathway induce increased RIP2 expression.
These studies thus suggest the therapeutic potential of
inhibiting RIP2 to inhibit inflammation and thus protect
against the development of ischemic insult. Activated
NOD2 and RIP2 then transfer signals to NF-jB, which is a
critical effecter and regulator of inflammation and immune
response [41]. The elevated NF-jB is thought to be
involved in ischemia-evoked neuron injury via proinflammation mechanism in permanent cerebral ischemia
[3, 42, 43]. Blocking NF-jB activation by pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamate or knockout p50 subunit of NF-jB is
protective and shrinks the size of the infarct [42]. In
agreement with previous studies, our data showed that the
expression of NOD2, RIP2 and nuclear accumulation of
NF-jB were increased at 24 h after ischemia, we hypothesized that after endogenous activators were identified by
NOD2, the signal transduction pathway was switched on.
This may led to recruitment of RIP2, activation of NF-jB
and the subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines,
resulting in tissue injury. Our study showed that pretreatment of 100 mg/kg NG was sufficient to provide significant
neuroprotection against neurological injury induced by
pMCAO: the neurologic deficit scores were ameliorated,
brain edema and infarct size were diminished at 24 h in a
rat focal cerebral ischemic model; Moreover, compared
with pMCAO and Vehicle groups, pretreatment with NG
significantly lessened the levels of NOD2, RIP2 and NF-jB
in ischemic brain tissue. Hence, we speculated that through
weakening NOD2/RIP2 signal pathway, NG decreased the
release of NF-jB, consequently protecting the injured
neurons. In our next experiment stage, some specific
inhibitors will be applied to further validating the NG’s
neuroprotective effect. As for the mechanism how NG
regulates the NOD2/RIP2 signal pathway requires further
research.
BBB existing at brain microvessel endothelial cells acts
as an interface separating the brain parenchyma from the
systemic circulation. Focal cerebral ischemia induces BBB
disruption, which facilitates the infiltration of intravascular
proteins and fluid into the cerebral parenchymal extracellular space, thereby incurring vasogenic edema and further
brain injury. Not only deleterious effects of MMP-9 in
inflammatory insult, abnormal up-regulation of MMP-9 has
been linked to ischemia-induced brain injury and BBB
disruption by degrading the extracellular matrix, basal
lamina proteins, and tight junctions around the BBB [44,
45]. Tight junctions are important structural components of
the BBB and well developed between adjacent endothelial

1413

cells of blood vessels in the central nervous system [46].
Among tight junction proteins, the transmembrane protein
claudin-5 is critically involved in sealing the tight junctions
and maintaining the integrity of BBB [47]. Ischemic injury
can induce a significant shrinkage of claudin-5 [5, 48, 49].
In view of the pivotal role of MMP-9 and claudin-5 in
affecting BBB permeability, we assessed whether NG exert
an impact on MMP-9 and claudin-5. Our result showed that
NG reduced the level of MMP-9 and preserved the
expression of claudin-5 at protein and mRNA levels, which
may explain NG0 s reduction effect on brain edema.
Finally, there are limitations of the present study.
Firstly, the gene sequence of RIP2 was discontinued in
GenBank, we fail to evaluate the expression of RIP2 by
RT-qPCR. Secondly, we only studied the expression of
NOD2, RIP2, NF-jB, MMP-9 and claudin-5 at 24 h after
ischemia, the longitudinal expression at different time
points needs further investigation.
In summary, the present results provide some reasonable
evidence for supporting a hypothesis that NG could offer
neuroprotective effect on permanent ischemic damage.
Specifically, the beneficial effect of NG against ischemic
injury was likely exerted by down-regulated NOD2, RIP2,
NF-jB, MMP-9 and up-regulated claudin-5 expression.
With regard to potential therapeutic applications, NG
appeared to offer an attractive new pharmacological
direction for the future treatment of stroke.
