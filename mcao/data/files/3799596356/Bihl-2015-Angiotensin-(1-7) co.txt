a b s t r a c t
Angiotensin (Ang)-(1–7) is a potential vasoprotective peptide. In the present study, we investigated its counteractive effects to Ang II on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke (ICH)
through inﬂammatory mechanism. In in vitro experiments, human brain VSMCs (HBVSMCs) were treated with
vehicle, Ang II, Ang II + Ang-(1–7), Ang II + A-779 or Ang II + Ang-(1–7) + A-779 (Mas receptor antagonist).
HBVSMC proliferation, migration and apoptosis were determined by methyl thiazolyltetrazolium, wound healing
assay and ﬂow cytometry, respectively. In in vivo experiments, C57BL/6 mice were divided into vehicle, Ang II,
Ang II + Ang-(1–7), Ang II + A-779 or Ang II + Ang-(1–7) + A-779 groups before they were subjected to
collagenase-induced ICH or sham surgery. Hemorrhage volume and middle cerebral artery (MCA) remodeling
were determined by histological analyses. Levels of NFκB, inhibitor of κBα (IκBα), tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and interleukin (IL-8) were measured by western blot
or ELISA. We found that 1) Ang II increased HBVSMC migration, proliferation and apoptosis, and increased the
blood pressure (BP), neurological deﬁcit score, MCA remodeling and hemorrhage volume in ICH mice. 2) Ang(1–7) counteracted these effects of Ang II, which was independent of BP, with the down-regulation of NFκB,
up-regulation of IκBα, and decreased levels of TNF-α, MCP-1 and IL-8. 3) The beneﬁcial effects of Ang-(1–7)
could be abolished by A-779. In conclusion, Ang-(1–7) counteracts the effects of Ang II on ICH via modulating
NFκB inﬂammation pathway in HBVSMCs and cerebral microvessels.

1. Introduction
Intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke (ICH) is a serious cerebrovascular
complication related to arteriosclerosis and hypertension. The role of
angiotensin (Ang) II/AT1 pathway of renin angiotensin system (RAS)
has been well documented in the pathophysiology of hypertension
and vascular diseases. Ang-(1–7)/Mas is a newly discovered pathway
of the RAS, which counteracts the effects of Ang II/AT1 pathway [1]

and have protective effects on stroke [2]. An earlier study showed that
intracerebral administration of Ang-(1–7) has beneﬁcial effects on
endothelin-1-induced ischemic stroke, which can be reversed by A779, a Mas receptor antagonist [3]. Centrally administered Ang-(1–7)
increases the survival of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive
(SHRSP) rats [4]. Our recent study demonstrated that neuron angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) over-expression, which catalyzes
Ang II into Ang-(1–7), protects brain from ischemic stroke injury
[5]. However, it is unknown whether Ang-(1–7) might provide vascular protective effects on ICH by counteracting the deleterious effects
of Ang II and ultimately possess great potential for the prevention and
treatment of ICH.
Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are the main components
of vascular parenchyma and play an important role in vascular pathology
changes [6,7]. Evolving evidence demonstrates that phenotypic changes
of VSMCs have a signiﬁcant impact on cerebral aneurysm formation
and rupture [8]. Ang II has been shown to induce VSMC proliferation/
migration and hypertrophic response [9]. Moreover, Ang II-induced
vascular inﬂammation involves in vascular dysfunction/injury, cerebral

116

aneurysm formation and rupture and subsequential ICH [10]. Tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is a key proinﬂammatory factor that has
been implicated in ICH pathophysiology. This may occur through TNFα-mediated VSMC phenotypic modulation, release of chemotactic cytokines, and ultimately cellular apoptosis [11]. Ang II induces VSMC dysfunction/inﬂammation via TNF-α dependent nuclear factor-KappaB
(NFκB) pathway [12]. Inhibition of the Ang II signaling could prevent
VSMC inﬂammation related vascular remodeling [13,14]. Therefore,
investigating whether Ang-(1–7) protects VSMCs from Ang II-induced
injury via regulating the NFκB inﬂammatory pathway will provide
rationale for protective effects of Ang-(1–7) on vascular remodeling
and ICH.
In this study, we determined the role of Ang-(1–7) in protecting
human brain VSMCs (HBVSMCs) from Ang II-induced apoptosis and
activation, and in attenuating middle cerebral artery (MCA) remodeling
and brain injury in ICH by counteracting the effects of Ang II. The NFκB
inﬂammatory pathways were investigated to explore the underlying
mechanisms.

2.3. Flow cytometric analysis of cell apoptosis
The apoptosis of HBVSMCs was assessed by using apoptosis assay
kits (Invitrogen, NY) as our previous study [15]. The HBVSMCs were
suspended in 100 μl annexin-binding buffer, and incubated with 5 μl
of annexin V-FITC and 5 μl of propidium iodide (PI) at RT in the dark
for 15 min. The apoptotic rate was measured by a ﬂow cytometer (BD
Accuri C6, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
2.4. Cell proliferation assay
Methyl thiazolyltetrazolium (MTT) assay kit (Invitrogen, NY) was
used to determine the cell proliferation [15]. The cell culture medium
was replaced with 100 μl of fresh culture medium with 10 μl of
12 mM MTT solution and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Then, 100 μl of
DMSO was added to each well (96-well plate) and incubated at 37 °C
for 10 min. The absorbance of samples was measured at 490 nm
(OD490) by using a multi-well plate reader (Synergy H1, BioTek Inc.,
Winooski, VT, USA).

2. Methods
2.1. Cell culture and treatments
HBVSMCs (Sciencell Research Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were
cultured in 75-mm2 ﬂasks in SMC medium, supplemented with 2% fetal
bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 100 U/ml cell
growth supplement (Sciencell Research Laboratories) in a 37 °C incubator with humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. After reaching conﬂuence, cells were randomly subjected to different treatments for 24 h
(Fig. 1): vehicle, Ang II, Ang II + Ang-(1–7), Ang II + A-779, and Ang
II + Ang-(1–7) + A-779. The concentration of Ang II (10−6 M, SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO) was chosen according to our previous study
[15]. The dose of Ang-(1–7) (10− 7 M, Bachem AG) was determined
based on the concentration–response study (Fig. 2A). A-779 (Mas receptor antagonist, 1 μM, Bachem AG, Torrance, CA, USA) was preincubated with cells for 30 min [16].

2.2. Concentration–response study of Ang-(1–7) on Ang II-induced cell
apoptosis
To determine the effective dose of Ang-(1–7) for protecting
HBVSMCs from Ang II-induced apoptosis, cells were treated with Ang
II (10−6 M) and different doses (0, 10−9, 10−8, 10−7 and 10−6 M) of
Ang-(1–7). After 24 h, HBVSMCs were harvested for apoptosis analysis.

2.5. Cell migration assay
The migration ability of HBVSMCs was measured by wound healing
assays [17]. Cells were grown to conﬂuence on 6-well culture plates. A
straight scratch injury was made using a sterile 1 ml pipette tip on
6-well plates. Cells were then subjected to different treatment groups
as shown in Fig. 1. Photographs of the scratch area were taken immediately (0 h time point) and 6 h after making to check the invasion of cells
into the wounded area.
2.6. Animals and in vivo experimental design
2.6.1. Animals
Total of 128 adult (8–10 weeks of age, weight ranges from 25 g to
32 g) C57BL/6 mice were used for this study. Mice were maintained in
a 22 °C room with a 12-h light/dark cycle and fed with standard chow
and drinking water ad libitum. 8 mice died of surgery intervention,
and the rest of 120 were used for the experiments. The group sizes
were kept to 20/group by adding the corresponding number of animals
that died of surgery in each group. All experimental procedures were
approved by the Wright State University Laboratory Animal Care and
Use Committee and were in accordance with the Guide of the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals issued by the National Institutes of
Health (NIH).

2.6.2. Experimental design
As showing in Fig. 1, mice were implanted with telemetric probe for
recording arterial blood pressure (BP). After 7 days, mice were randomly divided into four treatment groups (n = 12/group): sham, vehicle,
Ang II, Ang II + Ang-(1–7), Ang II + A-779, and Ang II + Ang-(1–
7) + A-779. After 4 weeks, mice were subjected to induce ICH stroke
by injecting collagenase into the brain. After 24 h, mice were euthanized
under an overdose of pentobarbital (150 mg/kg i.p.). The doses used for
Ang II (42 μg/kg/h), Ang-(1–7) (24 μg/kg/h) and A-779 (200 ng/kg/min)
were based on previous studies [5,18,19].

2.7. BP recording
A radiotelemetry system (TA11PA-C10, Data Science International)
was used for recording arterial BP under anesthesia by inhaling 2.5%
isoﬂurane as we reported previously [5]. The telemetric probes were
implanted in the left carotid artery. BP was recorded for 24 h before
minipump infusion and continued for 27 days after Ang II infusion.
We recorded BP for 10 min (sample rate 500 Hz) once a hour for 24 h
to calculate the mean arterial pressure (MAP) for each day. The BP
was started to record at the same time for each mouse.

2.9. Microinjection of collagenase to induce ICH model
The collagenase injection surgery was conducted using a mouse
stereotaxic frame under anesthesia (ketamine:xylazine mixture,
100:8 mg/kg, 20–30 μl, i.p.). A 1.0-mm burr hole was made on the
skull by using a dental drill-trephine. The bacterial collagenase (type
VII-S; 0.075 U/0.5 μl) was injected into the caudate putamen by
injection cannula (a glass micro-needle, 30 μm in diameter) at a rate
of 0.5 μl/min [20]. The cannula was localized using stereotaxic coordinates related to the bregma (0.5 mm anterior to the bregma, 3.0 mm
right lateral to the midline, 4.0 mm in depth) [21].
2.10. Behavior test
Animals began to exhibit neurological signs of an ICH within 60 min.
At 24 h after ICH induction, neurological deﬁcit score (NDS) was determined by using a 24-point scoring system [22,23], including body symmetry, gait, climbing, circling behavior, front limb symmetry, and
compulsory circling. Each test was graded from 0 to 4, establishing a
maximum deﬁcit score of 24. All behavioral tests were conducted in a
quiet and low light room by observers who were blind to the treatment
condition.

2.8. Minipump implantation

2.11. Histological analyses of MCA remodeling and hemorrhage volume

The osmotic minipumps (Alzet, Model #1004, 4 weeks) were loaded
with Ang II, Ang-(1–7) and/or A-779 according to the grouping and then
placed in a sterile isotonic saline solution for 48 h at 37 °C to initiate
their operation at a constant pumping rate and to minimize the possibility of clot formation in the catheter. Intraperitoneally implantation of
minipumps was performed in a stereotaxic apparatus under anesthesia
(ketamine:xylazine mixture, 100:8 mg/kg, i.p.).

Brain tissues were ﬁxed in 4% formaldehyde overnight, and in 4%
formaldehyde plus 30% sucrose for three days. The brains were sequentially cut into coronal sections (20 μm for MCA remodeling or 1 mm for
hemorrhage volume).
The MCA was analyzed from both ipsilateral and contralateral sides.
To keep the sections from the similar level in each animal, the brain sections (20 μm) were sequentially put into six separate wells of a 6-well

118

J.C. Bihl et al. / Vascular Pharmacology 73 (2015) 115–123

plate containing 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline as we reported
before [5,24]. In total, three slices (sequentially from each well) of
each brain were used for HE staining to present the data of MCA remodeling for each brain.
MCA remodeling (wall-to-lumen ratio, W/L) and hemorrhage
volume were quantiﬁed with ImageJ from NIH. W/L was calculated as
follows: W/L = (De0Ca − Di0Ca) / 2Di0Ca, where De0Ca and Di0Ca
are the external and internal diameters of MCA [25]. Hemorrhage volume was estimated from the sum of all values calculated from the formula: [(area of hemorrhage region in each section) × 1] (mm3) [26].
The MCA remodeling and hemorrhage volume were calculated by an investigator who was blind to animal grouping.
2.12. Isolation of cerebral microvessels
The cerebral microvessels were isolated from the ipsilateral hemisphere of ICH mice after different treatments [5]. Brieﬂy, the brains
were removed free of meninges, dissected into small pieces and homogenized in 0.4 M sucrose solution containing 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.4 mM MES
buffer, 0.1 mM ATP, 1% BSA, and 20,000 IU sodium heparin at 4 °C. The
protease inhibitors (0.5 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mg/ml leupeptin, and
0.7 mg/ml pepstatin) and 0.1 mM EDTA were added. The homogenate
was subsequently passed through nylon mesh sieves (125 μm). After
centrifuging at 200 ×g for 5 min, the pellet was resuspended in 18%
Detran solution and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The pellet
was then resuspended in Ca2+–Mg2+ free Hank balance salt solution
(HBSS) and passed through nylon mesh ﬁlters (75 μm). The vessels on
the ﬁlter were obtained by rinsing the ﬁlter with HBSS. The microvessel
fraction consisted predominantly of capillaries and venules with infrequent contamination from small arterioles, and no observable contamination by intact parenchymal cells, as determined by light microscopic
examination.

were expressed as median (range). The neurological deﬁcit scores
among different groups were compared by the Kruskal–Wallis test.
When the Kruskal–Wallis test showed a signiﬁcant difference, the
Mann–Whitney U-tests were applied. For the rest measurements, comparisons between groups were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed
by a Turkey post-hoc test (SPSS version 16.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
For all tests, a P-value b 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Ang-(1–7) protects HBVSMCs from Ang II-induced apoptosis
In Fig. 2A, we found that Ang-(1–7) signiﬁcantly decreased Ang-II
induced cell apoptosis at the dose of 10−7 M (22,817 ± 523 and
13,720 ± 586 cells, P b 0.01, 10−7 M vs. 0 M) and 10−6 M (22,817 ±
523 and 12,285 ± 330 cells, P b 0.01, 10−6 M vs. 0 M). Based on these
data, we chose 10− 7 M of Ang-(1–7) for the following in vitro
experiments.
3.2. Ang-(1–7) decreases Ang II-induced proliferation and migration of
HBVSMCs
Ang II signiﬁcantly increased proliferation and migration in
HBVSMCs. Ang-(1–7) inhibited Ang II-induced HBVSMC proliferation
by 20% (P b 0.01; Fig. 2B) and migration ability by about 50%
(P b 0.01; Fig. 2C and D). These effects of Ang-(1–7) were abolished
by Ang-(1–7) antagonist (A-779) (P b 0.05 for proliferation, P b 0.01
for migration). The effects of endogenous Ang-(1–7) were investigated
by incubating cells with Ang II and A-779. Results showed that there
were no signiﬁcant differences between Ang II and Ang II + A-779
groups in HBVSMC proliferation and migration.

2.13. ELISA assays

3.3. Ang-(1–7) inhibits Ang II-induced activation of NFκB pathway in
HBVSMCs

The plasma levels of Ang II and Ang-(1–7) were determined by commercial kits (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) [5]. A volume of 0.5–
1 ml of peripheral blood was taken from the left ventricle of the heart
into a syringe containing 1% volume of heparin (1000 U/ml; Sigma, Fairfax, VA). The levels of TNF-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1
(MCP-1) and interleukin (IL)-8 in the cell culture condition medium
and cerebral microvessels were determined by commercial ELISA kits
(R&D System, Minneapolis, MN).

Ang II up-regulated the protein expression of NFκB by about 200%
and down-regulated the expression of IκBα by 70% in HBVSMCs. Ang(1–7) co-incubation with Ang II decreased NFκB expression by 50%
and increased IκBα expression by about 300% in HBVSMCs when compared with Ang II incubation group. A-779 blocked those effects of
Ang-(1–7) on HBVSMCs (P b 0.01; Fig. 3A and B). There were no significant differences between Ang II and Ang II + A-779 groups in NFκB and
IκBα expressions in HBVSMCs.

2.14. Western blot analysis

3.4. Ang-(1–7) decreases Ang II-induced secretion of inﬂammatory cytokines from HBVSMCs

Proteins from cells and cerebral microvessels were obtained with
lysis buffer (Thermo Scientiﬁc, FL) containing protease inhibitors. The
proteins were subjected to electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked by incubating
with 5% dry milk for 1 h, and then incubated with primary antibodies:
against NFκB (1:1000; Cell signaling, Danvers, MA) and inhibitor of
κBα (IκBα) (1:1000; Cell signaling, Danvers, MA), at 4 °C overnight.
After being washed thoroughly, membranes were incubated with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated IgG (1:40,000; Jackson
ImmunoResearch Labs, Inc. PA) for 1 h at RT. β-Actin (1:4000; SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO) was used to normalize protein loading.

Ang II increased the release of proinﬂammatory cytokines (TNF-α,
MCP-1 and IL-8) from HBVSMCs. Ang-(1–7) co-incubation with Ang II
decreased the levels of TNF-α, MCP-1 and IL-8 in the HBVSMC culture
condition medium (P b 0.01; Fig. 3D–E) compared with Ang II incubation group. This effect can be abolished by Ang-(1–7) antagonist
(A-779) (P b 0.01). There were no signiﬁcant differences between Ang
II and Ang II + A-779 groups in inﬂammatory cytokine levels in
HBVSMCs.
3.5. Infusion of Ang-(1–7) decreases Ang II-induced MCA remodeling
without Affecting MAP

2.15. Statistical analysis
Appropriate sample size was determined by a statistical power analysis with the type I and type II error rates at 0.05 and 0.20, respectively.
An estimate of the error variance was obtained from data in previous
studies. The results of the power analysis indicated that a sample size
of 10 animals per group is sufﬁcient. All data, excepting neurologic deficit scores, are presented as mean ± SE. The neurologic deﬁcit scores

After minipump infusion, the Ang II and Ang-(1–7) levels were
increased in the circulation (Table 1). Ang II infusion increased the
MAP (P b 0.01; Fig. 4A), while infusion of Ang-(1–7) did not affect the
level of MAP. Moreover, infusion of Ang II increased the MCA remodeling by 50% compared to the vehicle group (P b 0.01; Fig. 4B and C). Infusion of Ang-(1–7) attenuated the MCA remodeling induced by Ang II
(P b 0.01; Fig. 4C). Infusion of A-779 totally blocked the effect of Ang-

Fig. 3. The effects of Ang-(1–7) on regulating gene expressions and cytokine release of HBVSMCs. Ang II induced the up-regulation of NFкB (A) and down-regulation of IκBα (B) in
HBVSMCs. In addition, Ang II induced the release of TNF-α (C), MCP-1 (D) and IL-8 (E) from HBVSMCs. Ang-(1–7) counteracted these effects of Ang II, which could be aborted by
A-779. **P b 0.01 vs. Veh; ++P b 0.01 vs. Ang II, ##P b 0.01 vs. Ang II + Ang-(1-7), n = 6/group. TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor; MCP-1: monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; IL-8:

(1–7) (P b 0.01), which further demonstrated the protective effect of
Ang-(1–7) on MCA remodeling. These data suggest that Ang-(1–7)
has a protective effect on vascular remodeling by counteracting the
effect of Ang II via a BP-independent manner. There was no signiﬁcant
difference between Ang II and Ang II + A-779 groups in MAP.
3.6. Infusion of Ang-(1–7) decreases Ang II-enlarged hemorrhage volume
and improved neurological function after ICH
Fig. 5A shows the representative images of hemorrhage volume in
each group. Infusion of Ang II increased the hemorrhage volume when
compared to vehicle group (P b 0.01; Fig. 5B). Moreover, Ang II infusion
exacerbated the neurological function after ICH. Chronic infusion of
Ang-(1–7) could decreased the enlarged hemorrhage volume and increased neurological deﬁcit scores induced by Ang II (P b 0.01). Infusion
of A-779 abolished the effect of Ang-(1–7) (P b 0.01), which further
demonstrated the protective effect of Ang-(1–7) on brain injury and
functional improvement in an ICH mouse model. These data suggest
that Ang-(1–7) plays a role in protecting brain from hemorrhagic injury
and improving neurological function by counteracting the effect of Ang
II. There were no signiﬁcant differences between Ang II and Ang II + A779 groups in hemorrhage volume and neurological deﬁcit scores, suggesting that the endogenous Ang-(1–7) did not have signiﬁcant effects
on enlarged hemorrhage volume and increased neurological deﬁcit
scores induced by Ang II.
3.7. Infusion of Ang-(1–7) inhibits Ang II-induced activation of NFκB
pathway in cerebral microvessels
Ang II infusion increased the expression of NFκB and decreased the
expression of IκBα in cerebral microvessels (P b 0.01; Fig. 6A and B).
Infusion of Ang-(1–7) and Ang II decreased NFκB expression and
increased IκBα expression when compared with Ang II infusion group
(P b 0.01). Infusion of A-779 abolished the effects of Ang-(1–7) on
regulating NFκB and IκBα expressions (P b 0.01), suggesting that Ang(1–7) exerts counteractive effects to Ang II probably via regulating

NFκB pathway. There were no signiﬁcant differences between Ang II
and Ang II + A-779 groups in NFκB and IκBα expressions in cerebral
microvessels.
3.8. Infusion of Ang-(1–7) decreases Ang II-induced up-regulation of
inﬂammatory cytokines in cerebral microvessels
The levels of inﬂammatory cytokines (TNF-α, MCP-1 and IL-8) in the
cerebral microvessels were increased by Ang II infusion (P b 0.01;
Fig. 6D–E). Infusion of Ang-(1–7) decreased the levels of TNF-α, MCP1 and IL-8 which were increased by Ang II (P b 0.01). Infusion of A779 abolished the effects of Ang-(1–7) on regulating the inﬂammatory
cytokine levels (P b 0.01). There were no signiﬁcant differences between
Ang II and Ang II + A-779 groups in inﬂammatory cytokine levels in
cerebral microvessels. These data suggest that Ang-(1–7) exerts counteractive effects to Ang II probably via regulating NFκB related inﬂammatory pathway.
4. Discussion
Primary ICH is caused by small arteriole ruptures which stem from
vascular pathology changes [27]. Though hypertension is a usual inducer of vascular ruptures, vascular dysfunction is the key initiator for vascular pathology changes [28]. VSMCs are the main components of
vascular parenchyma and maintain signiﬁcant vascular plasticity [6,7].
Emerging evidence demonstrates that VSMC function and phenotypic
modulation play signiﬁcant roles in cerebral aneurysm formation and
rupture [8]. Therefore, protection of VSMCs should facilitate the prevention and treatment of ICH.
Ang II has been reported to induce aortic VSMC proliferation/
migration and apoptosis [14,19]. In the current study, we further
demonstrated that Ang II induces human brain VSMC proliferation/
migration and apoptosis. Previous studies also showed that the
inhibition of Ang II/AT1 pathway has protective effects on VSMCs
[13,14]. As the counteractive pathway of Ang II/AT1, Ang-(1–7)/Mas
pathway has been reported to inhibit Ang II-induced mouse aortic

counteracting the effects of Ang II. Besides the proliferation and
migration abilities, we also determined the protective effects of Ang(1–7) on Ang II-induced HBVSMC apoptosis (Fig. 2). We performed
dose–response experiments to determine the effective dose of Ang(1–7) in protecting HBVSMCs from Ang II-induced apoptosis, which
are 10−7 M and 10−6 M. So we chose the lower concentration of Ang(1–7) for the in vitro experiments. Moreover, we used Ang-(1–7)/Mas
pathway inhibitor (A-779) to further conﬁrm the protective effects of
Ang-(1–7) pathway on HBVSMCs.
To further explore the protective effects of Ang-(1–7) on ICH, we
conducted experiments to determine the counteractive effects of Ang(1–7) to Ang II in a collagenase-induced ICH mouse model. Ang II and
Ang-(1–7) infusions led to a signiﬁcant increase in plasma Ang II
and Ang-(1–7) levels, which indicate the success of minipump infusions
(Table 1). Ang II infusion led to a signiﬁcant increase in both plasma Ang
II and Ang-(1–7) levels. We propose that increased Ang II level activates
ACE2, which catalyzes Ang II into Ang-(1–7) and subsequentially increases the plasma Ang-(1–7) level. Vaibhav et al. showed that Ang II infusion in wild-type mice results in increased plasma ACE2 activity [30].
Moreover, the intracerebral hemorrhage itself might have independent
effects on the levels of RAS components. The Ang-(1–7)–Mas axis has
been shown to undergo dynamic changes in ischemic stroke [31]. Levels
of Ang II are increased after ischemic stroke in the ventral cortex [32].
In the present study, we have a sham group and we measured the Ang
II/Ang-(1–7) levels in the sham group. Results (Table 1) showed that
ICH itself did increase the Ang II and Ang-(1–7) levels, however there

are no signiﬁcant differences. The reason could be that the animal
model we used is the collagenase-induced ICH model which is different
from the ischemic stroke model used in previous studies [31,32]. Also,
the angiotensin levels we measured are the plasma levels, while the
levels tested in previous reports are the local brain levels.
As expected, Ang II infusion signiﬁcantly increased the MAP in
C57BL/6 mice. However, the infusion of Ang-(1–7) had no effect on
MAP (Fig. 4). The lack of effect of Ang-(1–7) on MAP in the present
study may be due to the dose and the duration of Ang-(1–7) used,
and the animal model. The dose of Ang-(1–7) we used was 24 μg/kg/h
which is based on a previous study showed that only a high dose
(24 μg/kg/h) of Ang-(1–7) is able to attenuate the aortic lesions in
ApoE−/− mice with chronic angiotensin II infusion and fed with highfat diet [19]. They also reported that the chronic infusion (4 weeks) of
Ang-(1–7) had no effects on BP in an atherosclerosis mouse model,
which is the same infusion duration as our study. Therefore, the effects
of Ang-(1–7) on BP appear to be more dependent on the model of
hypertension than on the dose of Ang-(1–7) used. Recent studies
found that Ang-(1–7) lowered BP only when it was used in normotensive Sprague–Dawley rats treated with losartan [33], in spontaneous
hypertensive rats (SHR) treated with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor
N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester [34], and in Wistar–Kyoto rats and SHR
treated with the AT1 receptor antagonist candesartan [35].
Ang II has been reported to induce vascular injury [10] and cardiac
remodeling [36]. In the present study, we demonstrated for the ﬁrst
time that chronic infusion of Ang II could induce MCA remodeling,
enlarge hemorrhage volume and exaggerate neurological deﬁcits in
ICH. Interestingly, and we also found that infusion of Ang-(1–7)
decreases Ang II-induced MCA remodeling (Fig. 4). This provides new
information to previous studies showing that Ang-(1–7) attenuates
neointimal formation in the abdominal aorta after angioplasty [37] or
stent implantation [38] in rats. A previous study showed that Ang(1–7) treatment is able to counteract Ang II-induced atherosclerosis
by targeting VSMCs [19]. Our study indicates that Ang-(1–7) decreases
Ang II-induced MCA remodeling probably by targeting brain VSMCs, because Ang-(1–7) could decrease Ang II-induced brain VSMC proliferation and migration which are important processes in the formation of
atherosclerotic plaques and in the development of vascular remodeling
[39,40]. More recently, a paper reported that Ang-(1–7) reduces mortality and rupture of intracranial aneurysms in mice [41]. In the present

study, we further demonstrated that Ang-(1–7) decreases hemorrhage
volume and NDS in an ICH mouse model by counteracting the effects
of Ang II (Fig. 5). Taken together, we demonstrated that infusion
of Ang-(1–7) can counteract the detrimental effects of Ang II by attenuating the MCA remodeling and hemorrhage volume. It is the ﬁrst time
we show the protective effects of Ang-(1–7) on small cerebral vessels
and ICH. Since the infusion of Ang-(1–7) did not change the BP, we propose that there is a BP-independent mechanism underlying the protective effects of Ang-(1–7) on vascular remodeling and ICH.
Vascular inﬂammation, as well as some cytokine stimulation could
affect the function of VSMCs [42] and has been suggested as a major
mechanism involved in cerebral aneurysm formation and rupture and
subsequential ICH [11]. Extensive researches have been reported the
role of Ang II in promoting inﬂammation by up-regulating various proinﬂammatory signals, such as TNF-α, NFκB, and MCP-1 in VSMCs [12,43,
44]. A previous study showed that NFκB activation is a mechanism for
Ang II-induced proliferation and migration of VSMCs [44]. Our ﬁndings
provide further information that Ang II activates the NFκB inﬂammatory
pathway by up-regulating NFκB expression and down-regulating IκBα
expression in both HBVSMCs and cerebral microvessels. IκBα is the
inhibitor of degradation of the cytosolic NFκB. Activation of the NFκB
is initiated by the signal-induced degradation of IκB proteins. Interestingly, Ang-(1–7) decreased the up-regulation of NFκB and increased the down-regulation of IκBα in both HBVSMCs and cerebral
microvessels (Figs. 3 and 6). Ang II-induced proinﬂammatory cytokine
secretion could also be the mechanism for vascular inﬂammation and
injury, which includes TNF-α, MCP-1, IL-8 and IL-1β [45,46]. Our
research provides more evidence by showing that Ang II increases the

release of TNF-α, MCP-1, and IL-8 from HBVSMCs and increases their
levels in cerebral microvessels. More importantly, co-incubation or infusion of Ang-(1–7) decreased the inﬂammatory cytokine levels. This
is consistent with a previous study showed that Ang-(1–7) induced an
attenuation of the NFκB pathway in renal tissue in SHRSP together
with a down-regulation of the expression of several proinﬂammatory
cytokine genes, including IL-6 and TNF-a [47]. The mechanisms for the
counteractive beneﬁcial actions of Ang-(1–7) probably include
inhibiting Ang II-stimulated NFκB signaling pathways through kinase
inhibition and a potential inhibitory effect on the signaling cascades
leading to the synthesis/production of inﬂammatory cytokines. In addition, the role of Ang-(1–7) in activating phosphatases was reported in
rat primary astrocytes subjected to radiation-induced inﬂammation
[48].
Moreover, the effect of endogenous Ang-(1–7) was investigated by
including Ang II + A-779 group in in vitro and in vivo. The results
suggest that endogenous Ang-(1–7) might have a biologically relevant
effect, however, there are no signiﬁcant differences found among Ang
II, Ang II + A-779 and Ang II + Ang-(1–7) + A-779 groups in our
study. The reason might be the model we used. Since the main objective
of the present study is to determine the protective role of Ang-(1–7) in
ICH by counteracting the effects of Ang II, we used the Ang II incubation
to induce HBVSMC dysfunction and apoptosis, and Ang II infusion to induce hypertension and high level of plasma Ang II in animal model. The
effects of infused high dose of Ang II and Ang-(1–7) might cover up the
effects of endogenous Ang-(1–7).
In summary, Ang-(1–7) protects VSMCs from Ang II-induced
activation and apoptosis by inhibiting the NFκB inﬂammatory pathway.

Fig. 6. The effects of Ang-(1–7) on regulating gene expressions and cytokine levels in cerebral microvessels. The protein expression of NFкB (A) in cerebral microvessels was up-regulated
by Ang II infusion, while the expression of IκBα (B) was down-regulated. The levels of TNF-α (C), MCP-1 (D) and IL-8 (E) in the cerebral microvessels were increased by Ang II infusion.
Ang-(1–7) blocked all these effects of Ang II. A-779 treatment reversed the effects of Ang-(1–7). &P b 0.05, &&P b 0.01 vs. sham; ⁎⁎P b 0.01 vs. Veh; +P b 0.05, ++P b 0.01 vs. Ang II, ##P b 0.01

In a mouse model of ICH, Ang-(1–7) alleviates MCA remodeling and
brain injury by counteracting the effects of Ang II via inhibiting the
NFκB inﬂammatory pathway in cerebral microvessels, independent of
BP. Our data suggest that Ang-(1–7) may be protective in vascular
remodeling and ICH.
