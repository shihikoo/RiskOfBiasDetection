Abstract
Background: Stroke is accompanied by a distinguished inflammatory reaction that is initiated by the infiltration of
immunocytes, expression of cytokines, and other inflammatory mediators. As natural killer cells (NK cells) are a type
of cytotoxic lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system, we investigated the mechanism of NK cells-induced
brain injuries after cerebral ischemia and the chemotactic effect of IP-10 simultaneously.
Methods: NK cells infiltration, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and IP-10 expression were detected by immunohistochemistry,
immunofluorescence, PCR and flow cytometry in human and C57/BL6 wild type mouse ischemic brain tissues.
The ischemia area was detected via 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. CXCR3 mean fluorescence intensity of
isolated NK cells was measured by flow cytometry. The neuronal injury made by NK cells was examined via apoptosis
experiment. The chemotactic of IP-10 was detected by migration and permeability assays.
Results: In human ischemic brain tissue, infiltrations of NK cells were observed and reached a peak at 2 to 5 days. In a
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) model, infiltration of NK cells into the ischemic infarct
region reached their highest levels 12 hours after ischemia. IFN-γ-positive NK cells and levels of the chemokine
IP-10 were also detected within the ischemic region, from 6 hours up to 4 days after pMCAO was performed,
and IFN-γ levels decreased after NK cells depletion in vivo. Co-culture experiments of neural cells with NK cells
also showed that neural necrosis was induced via IFN-γ. In parallel experiments with IP-10, the presence of CXCR3
indicates that NK cells were affected by IP-10 via CXCR3, and the effect was dose-dependent. After IP-10 depletion
in vivo, NK cells decreased. In migration assays and permeability experiments, disintegration of the blood–brain barrier
(BBB) was observed following the addition of NK cells. Moreover, in the presence of IP-10 this injury was aggravated.
Conclusions: All findings support the hypothesis that NK cells participate in cerebral ischemia and promote neural cells
necrosis via IFN-γ. Moreover, IP-10 intensifies injury to the BBB by NK cells via CXCR3.

as well as the infiltration of circulating immune cells, respectively. A stroke is hypothesized to be a multiphasic
process [5] and, in most cases, the cause of death results
from inflammation without exogenous infection. Thus, a
secondary component of ischemic brain injury may involve the effects of a significant inflammatory response.
In the first hours following stroke, rapid activation of
resident microglia and production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines occurs [6]. In addition, neutrophils and monocytes and/or macrophage infiltrate and accumulate in
microvessels and in the ischemic cerebral parenchyma [7].
Accumulating evidence further suggests that the resulting

inflammation response is responsible for inducing cerebral
injury that is secondary to the hypoxia and ischemia that
predominantly characterize a stroke event [8]. However, it
is important to note that the action of the immune system
is not uniform, and activation of immune cells may play
different roles at different times.
Natural killer (NK) cells are a type of cytotoxic lymphocytes that play an important role in the innate immune
system. For example, NK cells mediate a response to
virally infected cells within three days of infection, and
respond to tumor formation. The term ‘natural killers’, was
coined based on the initial notion that these lymphocytes
do not need to be activated to kill cells [9]. NK cells are
key components of the innate immune system since they
are able to rapidly produce an abundance of cytokines,
mainly IFN-γ, and are able to lyse target cells without
prior sensitization [10,11]. The role of NK cells in the
development of adaptive immune responses has also
recently been shown [12].
Numerous observations have suggested that NK cells
play a role in the adaptive immune response associated
with autoimmune diseases. For example, the expansion
of blood NK cells has been found to correlate with the
suppression of disease activity, and NK cells isolated
from patients during treatment were found to be highly
activated [13-15].
While stroke is a disease that directly affects the neural
system, it is also a type of autoimmune disease involving
non-infection induced inflammation. Peterfalvi et al. [16]
proved that NK cells and its fundamental cytokines
decrease after stoke in human peripheral circulation.
As cerebral ischemia is a kind of focal disease, focusing
on changes in central system becomes necessary. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the
possible role of NK cells in stroke, including the timing
of their infiltration into the brain, whether they mediate
beneficial or harmful effects, what kind of role they may
have in cerebral ischemia, and what kind of changes NK
cells undergo during this process. Accordingly, functional
alterations in cytokine and chemokine production by NK
cells in both human and mouse models during the acute
phase of ischemic stroke were examined.

artery occlusion (pMCAO) mouse model was established
using the intraluminal filament method (6–0 nylon) as
previously described [17]. In the sham group arteries were
blunt dissected, yet not ligated. Following surgery, each
mouse was assessed on a scale from 0 to 5 upon awakening, and only mice receiving a score of > 1 were included
in this study [18].
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining
for NKp46, IP-10, CXCR3 and IFN-γ

Human samples were provided by the Department of
Neurosurgery, The First Clinical College of Harbin Medical
University and were used for our research which was
approved by the Harbin Medical University ethics committee. Patient deaths were identified as due to cerebral
ischemic infarction and were diagnosed using computerized tomography. Tissue samples were taken from an
area adjacent to the infarct site, and also from a similar
area on the normal contralateral hemisphere, from each
human brain sample. Tissues were embedded in paraffin
and sectioned (10 μm). Frozen CNS material from mouse
models were obtained after autopsy. Briefly, after being
fixed in cold acetone for 20 minutes, tissues were blocked
in 5% horse serum for 1 hour at room temprature, and
were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma,
St. Louis, USA) for 30 minutes. Primary antibodies used
included: goat anti-mouse/human NKp46 (1/150, Santa
Cruz, Dallas, USA), goat anti-mouse/human IP-10 (1/150,
Santa Cruz, Dallas, USA), rabbit anti-mouse CXCR3 (1/
150, Santa Cruz, Dallas, USA), and rat anti-mouse IFN-γ
(1/150, Biolegend, San Diego, USA). Tissues were incubated with antibodies overnight at 4°C. After several
washes with phosphate buffing saline (PBS), the appropriate secondary antibodies were applied (1:200, Zhongshan
Goldenbridge Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Beijing, People’s
Republic of China). Nuclei were co-stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Control stainings included
the omission of primary antibody. The human tissue
section areas were measured by image analysis software
(Image Pro Plus 5.0, Media Cybernetics, Warrendale, USA).
The numbers of stained cells per mm2 of tissue area were
calculated.

Methods
Animal experiments

2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining

Adult male C57/BL6 mice (weighing 20 to 25 g) were
obtained from Peking Vital River Laboratory Animal Ltd
(Beijing, People’s Republic of China). All mice were bred
and maintained in accordance with the guidelines of
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by
the China National Institute of Health. Furthermore, all
experiments were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines and were approved by Harbin Medical
University ethics committee. A permanent middle cerebral

Mice were euthanized 12 hours after pMCAO under deep
anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg body
weight). Brains were rapidly removed after intracardial
infusion of PBS. The brains were then cut on the coronal
suture into five slices, using a brain slicer. Brain slices were
immediately incubated in 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution (2% solution in PBS) for 30 minutes at
37°C. Areas not stained red with TTC were considered to
be damaged.

Primary cultures of neural cells

Neural cell cultures were prepared from newborn C57/
BL6 mice. Soon after discarding the meninges, the mesencephalon, cerebellum, and brain stem, cortexes were blunt
isolated from the cerebrum and then gently pipetted to
achieve a single cell suspension in 10% DMEM (supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml
streptomycin). Cell suspensions were passed through a
150 μm nylon filter, then were seeded in 24-well plates
(5 × 104 cells/well) or 25 mm2 flasks (105/ml) coated with
D-polylysine (PDL), and were cultured for at least 7 days.
Flow cytometry

Mice were euthanized and perfused with PBS. Hemispheres were divided to isolate non-ischemic (ipsilesional)
and ischemic (contralesional) tissue samples. Three to four
hemispheres were pooled for each treatment group, and
the resulting homogenates were pressed through 150 μm
and 75 μm filters. Next, cells were separated from myelin
and debris using 70% and 30% Percoll (GE Healthcare,
Pittsburgh, USA) gradients, respectively, followed by centrifugation. Samples were then incubated with anti-mouse
NKp46 antibody (Santa Cruz, Dallas, USA) for 30 minutes
at RT in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) buffer
(0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.01% sodium azide in
PBS). After the cells were washed twice with wash buffer
(0.1% BSA/PBS), FITC-conjugated anti-goat secondary
antibodies (Biolegend, San Diego, USA) were applied for
30 minutes at RT. Finally, the cells were fixed with 2%
paraformaldehyde at 4°C, and were then analyzed by
blinded evaluators using a FacsCalibur (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, USA) and FlowJo software (ThreeStar Inc.,
Ashland, USA) Three independent experiments were
performed for all time points, and 3 to 4 mice were used
per experiment.
Neural cells for apoptosis detection were prepared
from newborn C57/BL6 mice as previously described,
and were cultured in 10% DMEM until they covered the
bottom of a 25 mm2 flask. Cells were then treated with
NK cells (105) harvested from C57/BL6 12 weeks mice’
spleens with a MagCellect Mouse NK Cell Isolation Kit
(R&D, Minneapolis, USA) and murine IFN-γ neutralizing
antibody (10 ng/ml, R&D, Minneapolis, USA) in 10%
DMEM, then stained with a PI/Annexin kit (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, USA). Stained cells were detected by
evaluators who have no relationship with this experiment
using a FacsCalibur (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, USA)
and FlowJo software. Three independent experiments were
performed.
NK cells harvested from 12-week old C57/BL6 mice
spleens with a MagCellect Mouse NK Cell Isolation
Kit (R&D, Minneapolis, USA) were treated with murine IP-10 (10 ng/ml, 50 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml) accompanied by 6 hour oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) in

Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Ca-Mg-free, glucose 1 g/L). Mean fluorescence of CXCR3 (PE) which NK
cells presented were blinded evaluators using a FacsCalibur (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, USA) and FlowJo
software. Three independent experiments were performed.
Non-OGD groups were cultured in a cell incubator (5%
CO2) in HBSS (Ca-Mg-free, 1 g/L glucose). Three independent experiments were performed.
Reverse transcription PCR

Total RNA from the whole cortex, which had been sorted
in pMCAO mice, was obtained at different time points
using a Trizol extraction method recommended by Invitrogen. Reverse transcription was performed using an RT-PCR
kit from TaKaRa (Kusatsu, Japan). PCR amplification of IP10,IFN-γ, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) (endogenous control) were achieved using Taq
polymerase and the following primers: IP-10 sense 5′-GCC
GTC ATT TTC TGC CTC AT-3′ and anti-sense 5′-GCT
TCC CTA TGG CCC TCA TT-3′, IFN-γ sense 5′-AGC
GGC TGA CTG AAC TCA GAT TGT-3′ and anti-sense
5′-GTC ACA GTT TTC AGC TGT ATA GGG-3′, and
GAPDH sense 5′-AAT GCA TCC TGC ACC AA-3′ and
anti-sense 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′. A
total of 40, 40 and 32 cycles were performed for IP-10,
IFN-γ and GAPDH, respectively. Three independent experiments were performed.

Migration assays

Neural cells (5 × 104 cells) prepared from newborn C57/
BL6 mice as previously described were seeded in the
bottom of 24-well transwell plates. After culturing the
cells for at least 7 days, mouse brain endothelial cells
(bEnd3, ADCC) (1 × 104) were plated on top of 2% gelatincoated 3 μm pore size upper transwell chambers with 10%
DMEM media. After the ECs formed a confluent monolayer, 20 ng/ml murine IP-10 neutralization antibody (R&D,
Minneapolis, USA) was added to the lower chambers
when appropriate. Simultaneously, a suspension of NK
cells (1 × 106/ml; 100 μl) prepared from 12-week old
C57/BL6 mice spleens with a MagCellect Mouse NK
Cell Isolation Kit (R&D, Minneapolis, USA) were added
to the upper chamber. The ability of NK cells to cross
the monolayer was evaluated by counting the absolute
number of cells that migrated to the lower chamber
after OGD conditions were applied for 6 hours in HBSS
(Ca-Mg-free, 1 g/L glucose). Furthermore, the cells in the
upper chamber were indirectly labeled with NKp46-FITC,
cell counts were performed using FACS, and three independent experiments were performed. Non-OGD groups
were cultured in a cell incubator (5%CO2) in HBSS (CaMg-free, 1 g/L glucose).

Permeability assays

Permeability assays were conducted as previously described
[19]. Soon after 6 hours OGD in HBSS (Ca-Mg-free, 1 g/L
glucose), 50 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled BSA
(FITC-BSA, Sigma, St. Louis, USA) was added to the upper
chamber of transwells. Samples (both 50 μl) were then
obtained from the upper and lower chambers of each
well and the fluorescence intensity of these samples was
measured using a FL600 microplate fluorescent reader
(Biotek, Vermont, USA). The diffusion rate, representing
the permeability of blood brain barrier (BBB) endothelial
cells (ECs), was expressed as a percentage and was calculated as follows: (BSA lower chamber) × 100 / (BSA upper
chamber). Non-OGD groups were cultured in a cell incubator (5%CO2) in HBSS (Ca-Mg-free, 1 g/L glucose).Three
independent experiments were performed.
In vivo NK depletion assay

Depletion of NK cells in vivo in mice was induced by
intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of a depleting anti-NK1.1
mAb (clone PK136, Biolegend, San Diego, USA). The
depleting antibody was given at 0.5 mg i.p. 1 day before
the pMCAO mouse model (12 hours) was established as
previously described. The lymphocytes infiltration assay
was then performed via FACS, and IFN-γ expression
level was detected by RT-PCR as previously described.

ischemic hemispheres was found to be significantly greater
than those in the non-ischemic hemispheres (P< 2 days <
0.05, P2 to 5 days < 0.01, P>5 days < 0.05). Furthermore, the
highest numbers of NK cells were observed in the 2 to
5 days tissues (Figure 1C).
Next, the infiltration of NK cells was examined in a
C57/BL6 pMCAO model. NK cells were detected in
ischemic brain tissues, and these cells were consistently observed in proximity of the ischemic penumbra
(Figure 1D,E). To monitor NK cells during ischemia,
infiltrating cells were isolated from the cerebrum at
various timepoints and were analyzed by flow cytometry. Based on the FACS data obtained, the infiltration
of NK cells peaked 12 hours after ischemia, and the number of NK cells in the ischemic hemisphere was significantly greater than that of the non-ischemic hemisphere
12, 24, 48, and 96 hours after ischemia (P12 hours < 0.01,
P24 hours < 0.001, P48 hours < 0.05, P96 hours < 0.05)
(Figure 1F). Moreover, the percentage of NK cells among
the infiltrating cells recovered was highest 12 hours after
ischemia, and decreased at the subsequent timepoints
(Figure 1G). After NK cells depletion, NK cells infiltration
notably decrease in ischemic mouse brain at 12 hours
(Figure 1H, P < 0.001), and the ischemia area diminished
with TTC staining (Figure 1I).
NK cells negatively affect neural cells via IFN-γ

In vivo IP-10 depletion assay

To block IP-10 in vivo, mice were injected intravenously
with 3 mg/100 g body weight anti-mouse IP-10 (R&D
Systems) for two days to neutralize the IP-10 secretion
before the pMCAO mouse model was established as previously described, and the lymphocytes infiltration assay
was then performed via FACS.
Statistical analysis

Results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation
(SD). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used to
compare multiple quantitative variables. Statistical analysis
was performed using one-way ANOVA analysis of variance followed by Student’s t-test. Statistical significance
was considered to be P < 0.05.

Results
NK cells participate in cerebral ischemia

Paraffin-embedded human brain tissues affected by cerebral ischemic infarction, as well as contralateral tissues,
were divided into three groups according to the period of
time that elapsed between the onset of stroke and death.
These groups included: <2 days, 2 to 5 days, and >5 days,
with 5, 11, and 4 sets of patient tissues included in each
group, respectively (Table 1, 1–20). Immunohistochemistry staining of NK cells was performed for each tissue
set (Figure 1A,B), and the number of NK cells in the

IFN-γ is one of the main cytokines secreted by NK cells.
Using immunofluorescence assays and FACS, IFN-γpositive NK cells present in ischemic tissues were analyzed
12, 24, 48, and 96 hours after ischemia (Figure 2A,B). The
highest levels of IFN-γ-positive NK cells were detected 12
and 72 hours after ischemia (P12 hours < 0.01, P72 hours <
0.01) (Figure 2C).
Staining for apoptosis and necrosis, we found levels
of necrosis of neural cells significantly increased after
adding NK cells, compared with the control group (only
neural cells), meanwhile levels of apoptosis were quite low
(P < 0.001). However, after treatment with IFN-γ blockade,
levels of apoptosis significantly increased and levels of
necrosis became lower in the NK + IFN-γ blockade group,
compared to the NK co-culture group (PN < 0.01, PA <
0.001), while levels of necrosis and apoptosis did not differ
from the control group (Figure 2D,E). After NK cells
depletion, the level of IFN-γ mRNA expression decreased
at 12 hours (Figure 2F).
Chemotactic effect of IP-10 on NK cells via CXCR3 during
cerebral ischemia

A second set of human brain tissue samples were obtained, and these derived from patients that died <7 days,
between 7 and 14 days, or >14 days after experiencing
an ischemic event. There were four, five, and four tissue
sets for each group, respectively (Table 1, 21–33).

were very high, and the IP-10-positive cells in the ischemic
hemisphere tissues of the 7 to 14 days group were present
at lower levels compared to the >14 day group (Figure 3C,
P<7day < 0.01, P7 to 14 day < 0.05, P15 to 21 day < 0.01).
Immunofluorescence assays were also performed for
ischemic brain sections of pMCAO C57/BL6 mice. In
these studies, IP-10 expressing cells were observed to
localize to the ischemic penumbra, as well as to the
sagittal suture, at different time points (Figure 3D,G).
PCR assays demonstrated that levels of IP-10 mRNA
were highest 12 hours after ischemia, especially in the
ischemic hemisphere tissues (Figure 3H). Furthermore,
the number of NK cells present in the ischemic and
contralateral hemispheres of pMCAO mouse tissues was
also detected by FACS, and a similar observation was

made, with a greater number of NK cells detected in ischemic tissues than contralateral tissues. Taken together, the
relationship between IP-10 levels and NK levels was found
to be significant (Figure 3I, P < 0.001). Then we blocked
IP-10 in vivo at the 12 hour time point, the number of NK
cells present in the ischemic hemispheres of pMCAO
mouse tissues were significantly low (P < 0.001) which were
detected by FACS(Figure 3J, P < 0.001).
In our laboratory, IP-10 has been found to be produced
by local cells (glial cells and endothelial cells) in an inflammatory lesion and cells culture supernatants (data not
shown). Therefore, expression of the receptor for IP-10,
CXCR3, was assayed using immunohistochemistry. In
mouse pMCAO brain tissue, CXCR3-positive infiltrating
NK cells were detected (Figure 4A). NK cells were then

treated with various concentrations of murine IP-10 (such
as 10 ng/ml, 50 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml, Peprotech, USA) and
subjected to 6 hour OGD conditions. Detection of the
mean fluorescence value for CXCR3 indicated that CXCR3
expression in 100 ng/ml group significantly increased when
compared with 50 ng/ml group (P < 0.001), and as the
concentration of IP-10 increased, the mean fluorescence
value of CXCR3 got higher. Furthermore, this number

was enhanced when NK cells were deprived of oxygen
(Figure 4B).

changed to Ca-Mg-free HBSS (1 g/L glucose), and NK cells
were added to the upper chamber. Cells were then subjected to OGD conditions. Using permeability assays, brain
microvascular endothelial cells were found to be affected by
the presence of NK cells after OGD (Figure 5A, P < 0.01),
suggesting that NK cells not only negatively affect neural
cells, but may also affect the BBB during ischemia.
To investigate the effect of IP-10 on NK cells, IP-10
antibody was added to the lower chamber of the BBB
model to neutralize the IP-10 secreted by neural cells
(results not shown). The permeability rate of this model
subsequently decreased according to the BSA diffusion
assay performed (Figure 5A, P < 0.05). FACS of neural
cells in the lower chamber also detected a lower percentage of NK cells, thereby suggesting that the IP-10 blockade
can inhibit the migration of NK cells through the BBB
(Figure 5B, P < 0.05).

Discussion
Peterfalvi et al. [16] previously demonstrated that NK
cells are active during the acute phase of stroke. In
addition, when NK cells were isolated from the peripheral
circulation during the early phases of stroke, deficient
IFN-γ production and cytotoxicity were observed, similar
to that observed in animal models [20]. Additional reports
have shown that while numbers of NK cells remain
unchanged following stroke, numbers of adaptive T
lymphocyte subsets decrease [21-23]. The objective of
this study was to examine the role of NK cells in brain
tissue affected by ischemia. During the early phases of
stroke, a peak in the infiltration of NK cells was
observed, concomitant with increased expression of
IFN-γ (Figure 1A-C; Figure 2A-C). Based on these results,
we hypothesized that NK cells play an important role
during the onset of cerebral ischemia. In studies by
Gelderblom et al. [24], NK cells were not found to significantly affect ischemia in a mouse brain 1 hour after

Page 11 of 13

the ischemic event and reperfusion. In the present study,
numbers of infiltrating NK cells reached their highest
levels in the ischemic hemisphere 12 hours after the
ischemic event (P < 0.01) (Figure 1F) according to FACS
analysis. Furthermore, IFN-γ-positive NK cells exhibited a
similar profile (Figure 2C). The analysis of NK cells as a
percentage of infiltrating lymphocytes further confirmed
that NK cells have a predominant role during the onset of
stroke (Figure 1G). After we depleted NK cells in vivo, NK
infiltration in ischemic brain got notably lower (Figure 1H)
as did the level of IFN-γ mRNA (Figure 2F), and the ischemia area diminished, which strengthens the importance of
NK cells participation in the onset of cerebral ischemia.
Interestingly, when neural cells were exposed to activated
NK cells, an increase in the number of dead cells and
very low levels of apoptosis were observed. In contrast, a
significant increase in the levels of apoptosis was detected
following neutralization of IFN-γ secreted by NK cells
(Figure 2D,E). Apoptosis is currently recognized as a
necessary process during the development of the nervous
system [25]. Moreover, the apoptosis of neural cells is
anticipated to stabilize a microenvironment more so
than the presence of dead neural cells. Therefore, we
hypothesize that NK cells promote the necrosis of
neural cells via IFN-γ during the early stages of stroke,
and the fragments of these dead cells negatively affect
the ischemic region. Accordingly, neutralization of IFN-γ
in the brain should be further investigated in clinical trials.
The detection of NK cells in ischemic brain tissue
illustrates that NK cells have a role in cerebral ischemia,
and the section of IFN-γ by NK cells has the potential to
affect neural cells. However, previous studies have not
demonstrated how NK cells are able to access ischemic
tissues. Since blood flow is blocked following an ischemic
event, access via circulation is not a possibility. IP-10 is
a chemoattractant secreted by several cell types in response to IFN-γ, and these cell types include monocytes,

endothelial cells, and fibroblasts [26]. Furthermore, IP-10
has been identified as a chemoattractant for monocytes
and macrophages, T cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells
[27]. IP-10 has been proven to increase in focal stroke
[28-30]. In our study, we focused on probing the relationship between IP-10 and NK cells accumulation after
stroke. IP-10 was detected in human ischemic brain tissue
(Figure 3A,B), and was present at high levels during the
early stages of stroke (Figure 3C). Similarly, IP-10 was
detected in ischemic cerebral tissue of the mouse model
examined (Figure 3D,G), with the highest levels detected
12 hours after ischemia using RT-PCR. These results are
consistent with the rat model of ischemia characterized by
Wang et al. [31] (Figure 3H), and the decrease of NK cells
infiltration in ischemic brain after IP-10 depletion in vivo
prompt us to compare relationship between IP-10 and NK
cells when stroke occurs, suggesting that IP-10 expression
induces NK cell infiltration following cerebral ischemia
(Figure 3I,J).
CXCR3 regulates leukocyte trafficking, and binding of
chemokines such as IP-10 can induce various cellular
responses [32]. Most notably, these changes can include
integrin activation, cytoskeletal changes, and chemotactic migration. However, these responses are restored
following the dephosphorylation of intracellular receptors
and their subsequent recycling to the cell surface. In the
present study, detection of mean fluorescence intensity
was used to evaluate the action of IP-10 on NK cells. As a
result, IP-10 was found to activate CXCR3 expression by
NK cells (Figure 4A), and this effect was dose-dependent
(Figure 4B). However, IFN-γ-mediated cytoxicity associated with IP-10-induced activation of NK cells was not
observed (data not shown). Therefore, it appears that
IP-10 is only a chemotactic cytokine for NK cells following
cerebral ischemia.
NK cells respond to several chemotactic factors, including MIP-1 and Mig [33]. However, IP-10 is the primary
chemotactic factor for NK cells in the brain. In the present
study, IP-10 was found to be primarily secreted by neural
cells rather than brain microvascular endothelial cells
under OGD conditions (data not shown). In the brain, the
stability of the microenvironment is maintained by BBB
permeability [34]. Correspondingly, damage to the BBB
can promote secondary inflammation injury following
stroke [35]. By co-culturing neural cells and cerebral
microvascular endothelial cells under OGD conditions
as an analogue of ischemia and the BBB, an increase in
permeability was observed following the addition of NK
cells (Figure 5A). Furthermore, this increase in permeability, as well as the migration of NK cells, was reduced
following neutralization of IP-10 (Figure 5B). These results
strongly suggest that NK cells negatively affect the BBB
during stroke, and IP-10 enhances the infiltration of NK
cells through the BBB following cerebral ischemia.

Conclusions
In summary, NK cells were found to participate in the
early stages of stroke and to induce the necrosis of neural
cells via IFN-γ. Based on these results, the capacity to
neutralize IFN-γ represents an opportunity to stabilize the
microenvironment associated with cerebral ischemia.
In addition, NK cells were found to damage the BBB in
response to IP-10 as a chemoattractant. These results
suggest that the damage mediated by NK cells following
stroke may be attenuated by neutralizing IP-10 and other
factors that are attractive to NK cells, thereby preventing
the release of cytotoxic cytokines. It is anticipated that
further studies of these mechanisms may improve the
indications of clinical therapy for brain ischemia. Furthermore, future studies will need to focus on NK cells present
in ischemic tissue and their interactions with other immune
cells during different phases of stroke, particularly interactions that lead to damage of the BBB.
