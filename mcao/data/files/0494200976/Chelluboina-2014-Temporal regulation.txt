Abstract A tremendous effort has been expended to elucidate
the role of apoptotic molecules in ischemia. However, many
agents that target apoptosis, despite their proven efficacy in
animal models, have failed to translate that efficacy and specificity in clinical settings. Therefore, comprehensive knowledge
of apoptotic mechanisms involving key apoptotic regulatory
molecules and the temporal expression profiles of various
apoptotic molecules after cerebral ischemia may provide insight
for the development of better therapeutic strategies aimed at
cerebral ischemia. The present study investigates the extent of
apoptosis and the regulation of apoptotic molecules both at
mRNA and protein levels at various time points after focal
cerebral ischemia in a rat model of middle cerebral artery
occlusion. In this study, we performed various techniques, such
as TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride), H&E (hematoxylin and eosin), and TUNEL (terminal deoxy nucleotidyl
transferase-mediated nick-end labeling) staining, along with
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) microarray, antibody microarray, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, immunofluorescence,
and immunoblot analyses. Our research provided a large list
of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic molecules and their temporal expression profiles both at the mRNA and protein levels.
This information could be very useful for designing future
stroke therapies and aid in targeting the right molecules at
critical time to obtain maximum therapeutic benefit.

Introduction
Despite decades of work, no clinically effective therapies
exist to facilitate recovery from stroke. Globally, of the
15 million people who suffer a stroke each year, more
than 5 million die and a further 5 million are left permanently disabled [1]. Emotional and behavioral changes
after stroke can be distressing to survivors and family
members alike. Current treatment options offer only
modest benefits, creating a pressing need for new and
effective treatments.
There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that both
necrosis and apoptosis contribute significantly to cell death
subsequent to cerebral ischemia. After focal cerebral ischemia, most of the cells in the ischemic core undergo necrosis
and the cell death in the ischemic penumbra is considered an
active process that leads to apoptosis [2]. In the early stages
of cerebral infarction, neurons in the ischemic core display
several characteristics of early apoptosis, which include cytoplasmic and nuclear condensations and activation-specific
caspase-cascades [3].
Although there is a clear indication of initiation of the
apoptotic pathway in the ischemic core, the complete morphological changes of apoptosis are not observed at the end
stages of infarction. Termination of the apoptotic process in
the ischemic core could be due to severe energy level impairment that may cause a shift from apoptosis toward secondary necrosis [4]. The activated caspases or calpains eventually cleave ion pumps, such as plasma membrane Ca2+
pump and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, which results in the disruption of calcium homeostasis that can finally switch apoptotic
signaling to necrosis [5, 6]. Necrosis is a more complex
phenomenon that, while linked to apoptosis, has a separate,

Mol Neurobiol (2014) 49:50–65

significant role in cerebral ischemia. In contrast, in the ischemic penumbra, energy-dependent caspase-activation cascades
have been observed where apoptosis can fully develop because of the residual blood supply.
Therapies targeting cell death in the ischemic core likely
will be less successful than those targeting cell deaths in the
penumbra. This could be the major reason for the clinical
failure of many drugs that are aimed at excitotoxicity and
oxidative stress. Targeting apoptosis, which plays a key role
both in the ischemic core and in the penumbra, could offer a
significant therapeutic benefit. Both extrinsic and intrinsic
apoptotic pathways play vital roles, and upon initiation these
pathways recruit downstream apoptotic molecules to execute
cell death cascades. Each of these pathways contains both
caspase-dependent and caspase-independent components.
A tremendous effort has been made to elucidate the role of
apoptotic molecules after cerebral ischemia. Several agents
targeting caspases and Bcl-2 family members demonstrated efficacy in animal models of cerebral ischemia [7–14]. IDN-6556
is a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor and when administered
to humans during liver transplantation, offered local therapeutic protection against cold ischemia/warm reperfusionmediated apoptosis and injury [15]. Any approach targeting
a single molecule/mechanism may not provide the desired
therapeutic benefit due to the complex pathology of ischemic
stroke. Moreover, because of the apoptotic cross-talk among
several pathways, inhibition of one apoptotic pathway may
augment an alternative one.
It is vital that optimal neuroprotective approaches to treat
cerebral ischemia include combination treatment strategies.
Therefore, comprehensive knowledge of apoptotic mechanisms involving key apoptotic regulatory molecules and the
temporal expression profile of various apoptotic molecules
after cerebral ischemia may provide insight for the development of better therapeutic strategies aiming at cerebral ischemia. Hence, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the
extent of apoptosis and the regulation of apoptotic molecules
both at the mRNA and protein levels at various time points
after focal cerebral ischemia in a rat model of middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO).

Methods
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of
the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria approved
all surgical interventions and post-operative animal care.
Animals
In this study, we used male Sprague–Dawley rats. All animal
experiments were conducted in accordance with the IACUC
guidelines. Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 230–

51

250 g were procured from Harlan Laboratories (USA). Animals were housed in a 12-h light/dark cycle at a controlled
temperature and humidity with free access to food and water.
Animals were randomly assigned to groups, and each group
consisted of at least 20 animals. After the animals reached a
weight of 260±5 g, they were subjected to an MCAO procedure followed by their sacrifice at various time points.
Study design, group description, and the number of animals
used for various experiments are included in Table 1. All the
procedures that were performed on the animals were in
compliance with the approved IACUC protocol.
Antibodies
Anti-Fas, anti-TNFR1, anti-TNFR2, anti-ERK1, anti-phosphoERK, anti-caspase-3, anti-XIAP, anti-cytochrome c, anti-Smac,
anti-Bcl2, and anti-bax antibodies were obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Akt, anti-Bad,
anti-AIF, and anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibodies were obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Anti-NeuN
antibody was obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA).
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody was obtained from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO).
Experimental MCAO Model
After the animal reached a weight of 260±5 g, it was
subjected to MCAO procedure. Anesthesia was induced and
maintained during the surgical procedure with isoflurane (0.5–
3 %). A heating pad and a heating lamp were used to maintain
the rectal temperature between 37±5°C. A ventral midline
incision (~25 mm) was made in the neck and the right common carotid, internal carotid and external carotid arteries were
surgically exposed. Two loose ligatures (5–0 silk suture) were
then placed around the external carotid artery. The external
carotid artery was permanently ligated rostral with one ligature. A microaneurysm clip was applied to the external carotid
artery near its bifurcation with the internal carotid artery. A
small puncture opening was made in the external carotid
artery. The pre-determined optimal inserted length on the
bare surface of the intraluminal suture (monofilament) material of appropriate size to the weight range of animals
used (Doccol Corporation, California) was marked. Monofilament was inserted through the opening and the other
loose ligature was tightened around the lumen containing
the monofilament. The knot should be readily undone, yet
tight enough to stop bleeding. The microaneurysm clip was
removed from the external carotid artery and the monofilament was then gently advanced from the lumen of the
external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery for a
distance of ~19 to 20 mm beyond the bifurcation of the
common carotid artery. Skin on the neck incision was
closed with surgical wound clips. Animals were maintained

in this state (induction of cerebral ischemia) for 1 or 2 h. To
restore the blood flow 1 or 2 h after MCA occlusion, the surgical
site was re-opened by removing the wound clips. The
microaneurysm clip was removed, the knot was loosened, the
monofilament was withdrawn and the knot was re-tied to stop
bleeding. This procedure initiated reperfusion. The skin was
sutured to close the neck incision and the rats were allowed
to recover. Animals subjected to the MCAO procedure were
treated with appropriate doses of analgesics and antibiotics as
mentioned in the IACUC protocol. Post-MCAO procedure,
the animals were sacrificed at various time points (postsurgery day 1 [PSD1], PSD3, PSD5, or PSD7). The brain
tissues obtained from these animals were utilized for various
experimental procedures.
TTC Staining and Measurement of Infarct Size
At various time points after the MCAO procedure (PSD1,
PSD3, PSD5 or PSD7), animals from various groups allocated
for 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma) staining
procedure were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital and
then decapitated. Brains were then removed rapidly and
placed in an adult rat brain matrix (Kent Scientific Corporation) that was pre-chilled. Matrix containing the brain tissue
was then placed in a freezer at −70 °C for 5–8 min and sliced
into 2-mm-thick coronal sections. These slices were stained in
2 % TTC for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. The infarction area
and hemisphere area of each section was traced and measured
using Image J analysis software (NIH). The infarct size was
quantified by using the formula, infarct volume={(volume of
contralateral hemisphere)−(volume of non-ischemic ipsilateral hemisphere)}/volume of contralateral hemisphere. This

formula accounts for the possible interference of brain edema
on infarct volume.
Brain Tissue Fixation and Sectioning
Under deep anesthesia with pentobarbital, rats were sacrificed at
various intervals post-MCAO procedure (PSD1, PSD3, PSD5 or
PSD7) for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, terminal
deoxy nucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick labeling (TUNEL)
assay, and immunofluorescence analysis. Briefly, animals were
perfused through the left ventricle with 70–100 ml of phosphate
buffered saline (PBS), followed by 100–150 ml of 10 % buffered
formalin phosphate (Fisher Scientific, New Jersey). The brains of
the animals from various treatment groups and sham controls
were then removed, fixed in 10 % buffered formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Serial coronal brain sections were cut at a
thickness of 5 μm with a microtome.
Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining
Paraffin-embedded brain sections of various groups of animals
including sham controls were de-paraffinized, rehydrated and
then subjected to H&E staining according to a standard protocol.
H&E-stained sections were coverslipped and observed under a
light microscope. All the slides were evaluated by a neuropathologist blinded to the treatments.

by TUNEL assay using In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit
(Roche, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, the paraffin-embedded tissue sections
were de-paraffinized, rehydrated, treated with proteinase K
working solution, and permeabilized. Permeabilized tissue
sections were incubated with the TUNEL reaction mixture in
a humidified atmosphere for 60 min at 37 °C in the dark.
Sections were counterstained for nuclei with DAPI (Dako,
Carpinteria, CA), coverslipped using fluorescent mounting
medium (Dako), and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX71). The results were quantified by
counting the number of TUNEL-positive cells in at least five
different ischemic zones of ipsilateral brain region and nonischemic contralateral brain regions of the tissue sections
obtained from at least three animals per group.
Immunofluorescence Analysis
This technique was used to identify the changes in the expression of caspase-3 protein in rat brains in response to right
MCAO. Paraffin-embedded brain sections of various groups
of animals were de-paraffinized, subjected to antigen retrieval,

permeabilized, processed with anti-caspase-3 primary antibody followed by Alexa Fluor® 488 (goat anti-rabbit IgG,
green) fluorescent-labeled secondary antibody, counterstained
with DAPI, coverslipped, and observed using a confocal
microscope (Olympus Fluoview). Negative controls (without
primary antibody or using isotype specific IgG) were
maintained for all the samples. All the slides were evaluated
by a neuropathologist blinded to the treatments. The results
were quantified by counting the number of caspase-3-positive
cells in at least five different ischemic zones of ipsilateral brain
region and non-ischemic contralateral brain regions of the
tissue sections obtained from at least three animals per group.
To evaluate neuronal apoptosis, another set of paraffinembedded brain sections from MCAO-subjected rats that
were sacrificed 7 days post-MCAO (PSD7) were subjected
to co-localization analysis with caspase-3 and NeuN antibodies followed by appropriate Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies.
RNA Extraction and cDNA Synthesis
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) from the ischemic ipsilateral brain regions of

rats sacrificed at various time points after the MCAO procedure (PSD1, PSD3, PSD5, or PSD7) and sham controls.
Briefly, total RNA was extracted with TRIzol and precipitated
with isopropyl alcohol, washed in ethanol, and resuspended in
RNase-free water. Then, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse
transcribed into first-strand cDNA using the Transcriptor First
Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNAs thus obtained were used
for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
analysis and rat apoptosis RT2 Profiler PCR array.

Apoptosis PCR Array
We used the RT2 Profiler Rat Apoptosis PCR Array (Catalog
# PARN-012ZD; SA Biosciences) because of the advantages
of RT-PCR performance combined with the ability of microarrays to detect the expression of many genes simultaneously. Each array contains a panel of 96 primer sets of 84
relevant apoptosis pathway focused genes, plus five housekeeping genes, and three RNA and PCR quality controls.
The cDNAs obtained from the brain sections of sham

controls and the ischemic ipsilateral brain sections of MCAOsubjected rats sacrificed on day 1 and day 7 post-MCAO
procedure were loaded onto microarray plates along with
FastStart SYBR Green (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The sample-loaded microarray plate was
subjected to real-time PCR analysis in iCycler IQ (Multi
Color Real-Time PCR Detection System; Bio-Rad Laboratories, California). Real-time PCR was carried out under the
following conditions: one cycle of 95 °C for 10 min, and 40
cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Data obtained in
the form of Ct values was analyzed by using web-based
analysis software (http://pcrdataanalysis.sabiosciences.com/
pcr/arrayanalysis.php). Changes in gene expression were
shown as a fold increased or decreased. The cut-off induction
determining expression was ±2.0-fold changes, and the genes
fitting these criteria were considered to be up-regulated or downregulated, respectively. We performed the PCR microarray

analysis on the samples obtained from three different animals
per group.

Laboratories) using the following PCR cycle: (95 °C for
5 min [95 °C for 30 s, 58–62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for
30 s] × 40 cycles, and 72 °C for 10 min). The RT-PCR end
product was resolved on a 1.6 % agarose gel, visualized, and
photographed under UV light. The housekeeping gene βactin was used to verify that similar amounts of cDNA were
loaded in all the lanes.

followed by appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using
chemiluminescence ECL Western blotting detection reagents on Hyperfilm-MP autoradiography film (Amersham,
Piscataway, NJ). Immunoblots were reprobed and
processed with GAPDH antibody to verify that similar
amounts of protein were loaded in all lanes.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical comparisons were performed using Graph Pad
Prism software (version 3.02). Quantitative data from TTC
staining, TUNEL assay, and caspase-3 immunofluorescence
were evaluated for statistical significance using one-way
ANOVA. Bonferroni’s post hoc test (multiple comparison
tests) was used to compare any statistical significance among
the groups. Differences in the values were considered significant at p<0.05.

Apoptosis Antibody Array
Cell lysates obtained from the brain tissue of sham control
rats and the ipsilateral ischemic brain tissue of rats that were
sacrificed 7 days post-MCAO procedure were subjected to
human apoptosis antibody array (Ray Biotech, Norcross,
GA). Based on the manufacturer’s inputs, several of these
antibodies used in the preparation of the human apoptosis
antibody array have cross reactivity with rat apoptotic proteins. The array membranes obtained were processed as per
the manufacturer’s instructions. Data were analyzed using
ImageJ analysis software.
Immunoblot Analysis
Immunoblot analysis was performed to check the expression
of various proteins in tissue lysates of untreated and treated
ischemic brains and the respective brain tissues of sham
controls. After sacrificing the animals at the end of the study,
their brains were rapidly removed and frozen at −70 °C.
Appropriate portions of the tissue were resuspended in
0.2 ml of homogenization buffer (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM
HEPES, 10 mM Tris–HCl, 10 mM KCl, 1 % NP-40, 1 mM
NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM
PMSF plus protease inhibitors [1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml
leupeptin and 10 μg/ml aprotinin]; pH 7.4), homogenized
using a Tissue Tearor (Biospec Products, Inc.), and followed
by sonication. Tissue homogenate was centrifuged at
15,000×g for 30 min at 4 °C and the protein levels in the
supernatant were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce,
Rockford, IL). Samples [equal amount (30–80 μg) of total
protein/well] were subjected to 10–14 % SDS-PAGE based
on the specifications of the protein, and the protein bands on
the gel were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The
membranes were processed with primary antibodies

Results
Brain Damage After Focal Cerebral Ischemia
TTC staining performed to evaluate the infarct size in animals subjected to either 1 or 2 h MCAO, which were
sacrificed on either day 1 or day 7 post-MCAO procedure,
revealed a prominent and comparable infarct size in rats
subjected to 2 h MCAO procedure and sacrificed on day 1
or day 7 post-MCAO (Fig. 1a). Infarct size was significantly
less in animals subjected to 1 h MCAO compared to those
subjected to 2 h MCAO (Fig. 1b). Although there was a
slight reduction in infarct size in animals subjected to 2 h
MCAO and 7 days reperfusion as compared with those
subjected to 2 h MCAO and 1 day reperfusion, the difference
was not statistically significant. As expected, no infarction
was noticed in the coronal brain sections of sham-operated
animals and in the contralateral regions of MCAO-subjected
rat brains. Based on these results, it was decided to induce
ischemia for a period of 2 h in subsequent experiments
designed to evaluate apoptosis.
In addition, the H&E staining on sham-operated and
2 h MCAO-subjected animals sacrificed at various time
points after reperfusion (PSD1, PSD3, PSD5 and PSD7)
revealed prominent structural brain damage in the ischemic regions with increasing intensity from PSD1 through
PSD7 (Fig. 2). Respective magnified images of the cortex
and striatal regions of the ischemic core showed interstitial
edema and pyknotic nuclei that were absent in controls. In
contrast to TTC staining results, H&E staining of MCAOsubjected rats clearly demonstrated the extent of structural
damage in the ischemic brain regions, which prominently
increased with the increase in reperfusion time.

TUNEL-positive/apoptotic cells were identified in the ischemic
brain regions of all groups of animals subjected to MCAO
followed by various periods of reperfusion (Fig. 3a). A minimum of 60 % of TUNEL-positive cells were present in the
ipsilateral brain regions of all animals, irrespective of the reperfusion time (Fig. 3b). The highest number of TUNEL-positive
cells was noticed in ischemic brain sections of animals that
were reperfused for 7 days after MCAO. The absence of
TUNEL-positive cells in the respective contralateral brain regions indicated that the apoptosis was specific to ischemic brain
regions.

Apoptosis was also demonstrated by immunofluorescence analysis which revealed prominent protein expression
of caspase-3 in all the groups of animals subjected to MCAO
followed by various periods of reperfusion (Fig. 3c). As
expected, caspase-3 protein expression is absent in the respective contralateral regions. Caspase-dependent apoptosis
was significantly greater in animals subjected a minimum of

Finally, neuronal apoptosis was indicated by prominent colocalization of caspase-3 protein expression with NeuN in

it had previously been shown that necrosis occurs in

Finally, we also conducted immunoblot analysis on tissue
samples obtained from sham-operated and 2-h MCAOsubjected animals that were reperfused for several time periods.
Immunoblot analysis revealed an interesting protein expression
profile of various apoptotic molecules that varies across the

Regulation of Apoptotic Molecules After Focal Cerebral
Ischemia
Rat apoptotic PCR microarray analysis results indicated upregulation of relatively few apoptotic genes in the samples
obtained from animals subjected to 1 day reperfusion after
MCAO. Conversely, animals subjected to 7 days reperfusion
after MCAO demonstrated an up-regulation of 90 % of the
apoptotic genes (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, we also noticed
increased gene expression of inhibitors of apoptosis, such
as Birc2, Birc3, XIAP, survivin, Naip2, AnnexinA5, and
Bcl2, in animals subjected to 7 days reperfusion after
MCAO. The increased gene expression of anti-apoptotic
molecules could be attributed to the activation of the body’s
defense mechanism to fight against increased apoptosis.
Folds up- or down-regulation of various apoptotic and
anti-apoptotic molecules at mRNA level are presented in
Tables 3, 4, and 5. Increased mRNA expression of certain
apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes (FasL, Fas, TNFR1,
TNFR2, bad, bax, bid, smac, cidea, caspase-14, caspase-3,
XIAP, survivin, bcl-2, p53 and NFkb1) appears to have been
initiated on day 1 post-MCAO with increasing expression
through 7 days post-MCAO (Fig. 5). However, prominent
mRNA expression of certain molecules such as Trail, cad,
cideb, caspase-8 and naip2 was noticed only in three days
post-MCAO samples, and then the expression of these molecules remained elevated for 7 days.
To further evaluate these results, we conducted an
apoptosis antibody array with the cell lysates obtained
from the brain tissue of sham control rats and the ipsilateral ischemic brain tissue of rats subjected to 7 days
reperfusion. Brain tissues of sham-operated animals were
used as controls instead of contralateral brain tissues of
MCAO-induced animals because the induction of ischemia in a whole animal may lead to induction/inhibition of
the expression of certain proteins in other regions of the
brain. Therefore, the protein expression profile in the
contralateral brain region may not exactly represent the
normal brain and may lead to false interpretations.
As expected, MCAO animals status post 7 day reperfusion, but not sham animals, demonstrated prominent protein
expression of several apoptotic and anti-apoptotic molecules
(bad, bax, bcl-2, bcl-w, bid, bim, caspase-3, caspase-8, IAP2, cytochrome c, Fas, FasL, HSP27, HSP60, HSP70, HTRA,
p21, p27, p53, smac, survivin, TNFR1, TNFR2, TNF-alpha,
and XIAP) (Fig. 6a).

XIAP expression was prominent also in animals subjected to 5

prominent in MCAO-subjected animals compared to shamoperated animals, and the expression gradually increased from
day 1 through day 7 reperfusion times. Expression of cleaved
caspase-3 was seen in samples of animals subjected to 3, 5 and
7 days reperfusion.

Discussion
Cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury triggers multiple
and distinct but overlapping cell signaling pathways, which
may lead to cell damage or cell survival. There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that in addition to necrosis,
apoptosis contributes significantly to cell death both in the
ischemic core and in the surrounding penumbra region subsequent to cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. The ischemic
penumbra will have intermediate perfusion, where cells depolarize intermittently [16–18]. Without treatment, the penumbra often progresses to infarction.

Mol Neurobiol (2014) 49:50–65

Many susceptible neurons, particularly in the penumbra
region, undergo apoptosis, although the mechanisms of this
process are not fully understood [19, 20]. Both extrinsic and
intrinsic (also known as the mitochondrial pathway) apoptotic pathways play vital roles, and upon initiation, these
pathways recruit downstream apoptotic molecules to trigger
cell death [21]. Each of these pathways contains both
caspase-dependent and caspase-independent components.
Apoptotic PCR and antibody arrays performed in the current
study clearly demonstrated the expression profiles of various
apoptotic molecules at various stages after focal cerebral
ischemia both at mRNA and protein levels.
The brain also activates neuroprotective mechanisms in an
attempt to counteract the damaging effects after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. This was confirmed in this study wherein
increased expression of the anti-apoptotic molecules, such as
Akt, ERK1/2, Phospho-ERK, Bcl2, IAP, XIAP, Naip2,
survivin, livin, HSP27, HSP60, and HSP70, was demonstrated. Although there was an up-regulation of Akt at mRNA
levels 7 days after reperfusion compared to its mRNA level on
1 day after reperfusion, the protein expressions of Akt and
phospho-Akt were prominently decreased 5 days after reperfusion (Table 5; Fig. 6b). Similarly, the protein expression of
phospho-ERK was more prominent on 1 day after reperfusion
than at any other time point (Fig. 6b). Interestingly, the activation of ERK1/2 also has been shown to contribute to cell
death in animal models of ischemia-induced brain injury [22,
23]. This would suggest that ERK1/2 is associated with both
brain injury and anti-apoptosis.
Earlier investigations revealed that liposome-mediated,
site-specific delivery of a plasmid encoding human Bcl-2
protein significantly reduced the number of apoptotic cells in
the infarct and the penumbra area after MCAO in rats [24]. A
well-recognized property of the highly conserved inhibitor
of apoptosis protein (IAP) gene family is the ability to
prevent apoptosis. So far, in humans, the members of the
IAP family include cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP, NAIP (neuronal
apoptosis inhibitory protein), survivin, and livin. In the present study, the expression of the above-listed members of the
IAP family increased prominently following focal cerebral
ischemia. We noticed several fold up-regulation of XIAP,
survivin, Naip2, cIAP1 and cIAP2 mRNA levels 7 days after
reperfusion compared to their levels 1 day after reperfusion
(Table 4). Similar to their mRNA levels, the protein expressions of these molecules were also prominent 7 days after
reperfusion compared to their expression in sham-operated
animals (Fig. 6a). Unlike Naip2, the mRNA expressions of
XIAP and survivin 1 day after reperfusion were prominent
compared to their mRNA expressions in sham-operated animals (Fig. 5). XIAP protein expression was increased 1 day
after reperfusion compared to sham-operated animals, and
the increased expression was maintained 5 and 7 days after
reperfusion (Fig. 6b). Adenovirus-mediated overexpression

63

of XIAP inhibits cell death in the substantia nigra and cerebellar granules [25, 26].
Overexpression of HSP70 sequesters apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and protects the neonatal brain subjected to hypoxia–
ischemic brain injury [27]. Although we are not yet clear about
the mechanisms underlying AIF-induced apoptosis after focal
cerebral ischemia, AIF protein expression was prominent in the
samples subjected to MCAO, and its expression levels were
maintained from day 1 through day 7 of reperfusion (Fig. 6b).
The increased expression of both pro-apoptotic and antiapoptotic molecules after focal cerebral ischemia in the present study is in agreement with earlier reports [7, 21, 28]. The
current study also details the temporal distribution of the
mRNA and protein expression of these molecules at various
stages of reperfusion after ischemia.
Bax, Bad, and Bid form channels allowing the release of
cytochrome c from the mitochondrial inter-membrane space.
Release of cytochrome c is the main trigger for mitochondrialassociated apoptosis [29–31]. Cytochrome c induces oligomerization of APAF-1, subsequent binding with pro-caspase-9,
activation of caspase-9, and finally binding and activation of
caspase-3, which cleaves PARP and initiates apoptosis [12, 30].
In the present study, we noticed an increased mRNA and
protein expression levels of Bax, Bad, Bid, and caspase-3
within 24 h following reperfusion (Figs. 5 and 6b). We also
noticed a prominent increase in the expression of cytochrome c
within the same time period, and the expression remained
elevated until 72 h post reperfusion (Fig. 6b). Unlike the mRNA
expressions of Bax and Bad which remained elevated until
7 days post-reperfusion, their protein expressions were prominently decreased 3 days post-reperfusion compared to their
expressions 1 day post-reperfusion (Figs. 5 and 6b). Caspase
3 protein expression increased from day 1 through day 7 postreperfusion (Fig. 6b). Cleaved caspase-3 expression noticed
after 72 h of reperfusion in the current study clearly indicated
the presence of caspase-dependent component of the intrinsic
(mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway.
Earlier investigations using broad-spectrum caspase inhibitors, like zVADfmk, BAF, or zDEVDfmk, have demonstrated
these to be neuroprotective in animal models of focal and
global cerebral ischemia, and neonatal hypoxic–ischemic
brain injury [8–11, 32]. A cocktail of caspase inhibitors
(e.g., YVADcmk, DEVDfmk, and IETDfmk) has been shown
to reduce the number of apoptotic cells after MCAO in rats
[12]. In addition, IDN-6556 is a broad-spectrum caspase
inhibitor and when administered during phase II clinical
trials, offered local therapeutic protection against cold
ischemia/warm reperfusion-mediated apoptosis and injury
[15]. Non-caspase-mediated induction of apoptosis by the
intrinsic apoptotic pathway after stroke, which involves mitochondrial release of AIF and subsequent DNA fragmentation,
has also been described, but the exact mechanisms have yet to
be defined [33, 34].

64

Release of TNF-α by neurons and glia [35–37] and upregulation of Fas mRNA and protein levels have been observed in the vulnerable areas after hypoxic ischemic injury.
Released pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL1, activate a number of intracellular signaling pathways, which
results in neuronal apoptosis. Caspase-dependent neuronal
apoptosis in the ischemic core regions and the penumbra was
clearly demonstrated in the current study (Fig. 4a). TNF-α
activates TNF-receptor-associated death domain (TRADD),
while Fas ligand, which is secreted by the action of matrix
metalloproteinases, associates with Fas-associated death domain (FADD). Subsequently, the death domains of these proteins interact with the death effector domains of procaspase-8,
cleaving it, and in turn, activating downstream effector
caspases and apoptosis [38, 39]. Furthermore, a marked increase in the Fas-L expression was found in the penumbral
region during early reperfusion after MCAO [31]. The current
study supports this assertion, as we found prominent increases
in the mRNA and protein expression of TNF-α, FasL, Fas,
TNFR1 and TNFR2 within 24 h after reperfusion (Figs. 5 and
6b). The increased mRNA expression of FasL, Fas, TNFR1
and TNFR2 remained elevated or further increased until 7 days
post-reperfusion. Similar to mRNA expression, the increased
protein expression of TNFR1 remained elevated until 7 days
after reperfusion. However, the increased protein expression of
Fas and TNFR2 remained elevated until 3 days postreperfusion and decreased thereafter. In addition, we also noticed an increase in mRNA levels of FADD and TRADD
within 24 h after reperfusion, and this increase was statistically
significant in samples that were analyzed 7 days after reperfusion (Table 3). Furthermore, BH3-only death-promoting factor,
Bid, is involved in TNF/Fas family death receptor-mediated
extrinsic pathway. Activated caspase-8 leads to the cleavage of
Bid to activated form, tBid. Then, tBid targets the mitochondrial membrane, and through conformational changes in Bax,
it triggers cytochrome c release that may finally lead to activation of caspase-3 [40, 41]. In the present study, mRNA expression of Bid increased within 24 h after reperfusion, and this
increased expression was sustained until 7 days after reperfusion (Fig. 5; Table 3). Similar to mRNA expression/level,
protein expression of Bid was also prominent 7 days postreperfusion compared to its expression in sham-operated animals (Fig. 6a).
In summary, our study provides a broad survey of proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic molecules and their temporal
expression profiles both at the transcriptional and translational levels. This data is very important for designing future
stroke therapies, particularly those that target apoptosis. The
main strategies in stroke treatment targeting apoptosis should
include either silencing key apoptotic molecules or
overexpression of anti-apoptotic molecules. Several of the
reported anti-apoptotic therapies to date targeted only the
molecules of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Furthermore,

Mol Neurobiol (2014) 49:50–65

these studies targeted a single molecule/mechanism, which
may not provide the desired therapeutic benefit due to the
complex pathology of the ischemic stroke. Because of the
apoptotic cross-talk among several pathways, inhibition of
one apoptotic pathway may augment an alternative one. It is
crucial that neuroprotective approaches to treat cerebral ischemia should include combination treatment strategies for
optimal clinical outcomes. Furthermore, to succeed in clinical settings, future stroke treatments should consider the
specificity, timing, and frequency of the treatment and
should also target the appropriate key molecules or pathways. We strongly believe that our study provides invaluable
data for investigators working in this area to design effective
stroke therapies in the future.
