Abstract
Epigenetic transcriptional regulation by histone acetylation depends on the balance between histone acetyltransferase
(HAT) and deacetylase activities (HDAC). Inhibition of HDAC activity provides neuroprotection, indicating that the outcome
of cerebral ischemia depends crucially on the acetylation status of histones. In the present study, we characterized the
changes in histone acetylation levels in ischemia models of focal cerebral ischemia and identified cAMP-response element
binding protein (CREB)–binding protein (CBP) as a crucial factor in the susceptibility of neurons to ischemic stress. Both
neuron-specific RNA interference and neurons derived from CBP heterozygous knockout mice showed increased damage
after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ischemic preconditioning by a short
(5 min) subthreshold occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), followed 24 h afterwards by a 30 min occlusion of the
MCA, increased histone acetylation levels in vivo. Ischemic preconditioning enhanced CBP recruitment and histone
acetylation at the promoter of the neuroprotective gene gelsolin leading to increased gelsolin expression in neurons.
Inhibition of CBP’s HAT activity attenuated neuronal ischemic preconditioning. Taken together, our findings suggest that
the levels of CBP and histone acetylation determine stroke outcome and are crucially associated with the induction of an
ischemia-resistant state in neurons.

contrast to several chronic neurodegenerative disease models
[16,17,18,19], the role of CBP and histone acetylation in
acute neurological diseases like cerebral ischemia are poorly
understood.
We have previously shown that the HDAC inhibitor
Trichostatin A provides robust neuroprotection against in vitro
and in vivo models of cerebral ischemia, suggesting a role for
histone acetylation in ischemic brain injury [7,11]. Endogenous neuroprotection by ischemic preconditioning, i.e. a
sublethal ischemic stimulus which confers increased resistance
to a severe ischemic insult, depends on de novo expression of
neuroprotective genes mediated by transcription factors like
HIF-1, CREB or NF-kB [20]. Whether histone acetylation
and/or CBP activity play a role for the acquisition of ischemiatolerant state in neurons, however, is currently unknown. Here
we demonstrate that CBP-mediated histone acetylation is
crucial for neuronal survival. Further, we tested whether
endogenous neuroprotection by ischemic preconditioning is
linked to changes in histone acetylation, CBP recruitment and

Introduction
Histone acetylation is an important epigenetic mechanism for
transcriptional control and its levels are regulated by the activities
of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs).
The HAT–HDAC system is also involved in the modulation of
other chromatin-associated processes such as replication, sitespecific recombination and DNA repair [1]. Aberrant histone
acetylation and/or impaired function of the histone acetylation
machinery have been linked to pathogenic progression in
numerous neurological conditions including neurodegeneration
[2,3,4]. HDAC inhibitors have been used consistently and
successfully in an array of neurological disease models including
poly-glutamine toxicity, spinal muscular atrophy, intracerebral
hemorrhage and cerebral ischemia [5,6,7,8,9,10,11]. CBP is a
transcriptional co-activator with HAT activity that was shown to
be important for long-term memory processes, which depend on
de novo gene expression [12,13,14]. Mutations in its gene (Crebbp)
underlie most cases of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, a rare
neurodevelopmental disorder with mental retardation [15]. In

essential for the acquisition of an ischemia-tolerant state in
neurons.

Construction, production, and in vitro knockdown
efficiency of lentivirus-expressing CBP embedded
microRNAs (miR-shRNA)

Materials and Methods

Third generation lentivirus was generated as described previously [24,25]. Briefly, small microRNA-embedded hairpin RNA
(miR-shRNA) constructs were generated in pcDNA6.2-GW/
EmGFP-miR (Invitrogen) along with an EGFP reporter and
driven by a neuron-specific synapsin promoter [24]. A nontargeting control microRNA embedded shRNA served as a
control designated ‘scrambled’. Three different targeting regions
were tested within the open reading frame of murine CREB
binding protein (Crebbp, NM_001025432) i.e. AGGCAGCAGCCAGCATTGATA (CBP-miR-shRNA-1), TGTGCCCATGCTGGAAATGAA (CBP-miR-shRNA-2) or CTGCCTCAACATCAAACATAA (CBP-miR-shRNA-3). Neuronal cultures were
transduced on DIV 3. After 96 h, transduction efficiencies
(.95% of neurons) and multiplicity of infection (approximately
5 MOI) were determined and calculated from serial dilutions in
neuronal cultures using enhanced green fluorescent protein
(EGFP) fluorescence as a reporter.

Animals
In vivo ischemic injury and preconditioning experiments were
performed on male C57BL/6N mice (18–22 g, 8–12 weeks old,
Charles River, Germany). Animals were maintained on a 12 h
light/dark cycle and given food and water ad libitum. They were
acclimatized for at least 1 week before surgery. Animals were kept
under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions and regularly
screened for infections according to FELASA protocols. All efforts
were made to minimize the number and suffering of animals used.
The generation of CBP+/2 mice has been described previously
[21]. The experiments with CBP+/2 mice were performed on a
DBA and C57BL/6J mixed background, since these mutants are
not viable on a pure C57BL/6J background [12]. All experimental
procedures were approved by the respective official committees
and carried out in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act, the
European Communities Council Directive of November 24, 1986
(86/609/EEC) and the ARRIVE (Animals in Research: Reporting
In Vivo Experiments) guidelines [22].

Evaluation of cell survival of transduced cultures
Epifluorescence microscopic images were taken on DIV 9 and
10 using EGFP as a reporter for lentiviral gene delivery and miRshRNA expression as described [24]. In all, 8 regions of interest
(ROIs) were preselected per well and repeatedly analyzed over
time, maintaining identical settings for all experiments. Enhanced
green fluorescent protein-positive cells were counted in a blinded
manner and ratios calculated to compare the effects of CBP miRshRNA expression on survival after OGD-induced cell loss. Each
ROI initially contained ,85610 cells on DIV 9. In total, an
average of 85686463 = 8,160 cells per condition (ROI6miRshRNAs6OGD durations) were analyzed before and after OGD
for each independent experiment. For visual display of neuronal
survival in a particular ROI, emitted fluorescence was pseudocolored green (just before OGD) and red (24 h after OGD) and
images were merged. The resulting yellow was indicative of
surviving neurons.

Antibodies
The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting,
immunocytochemistry or chromatin immunoprecipitation: rabbit
anti-acetylated histone-H3 and -H4 from Millipore (Schwalbach/
Ts., Germany); rabbit anti-CBP (A-22), goat anti-actin, and rabbit
anti-GFP from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

Primary neuronal cell cultures
Primary neuronal cultures of cerebral cortex were obtained
from embryos (E16–E18) of Wistar rats or from embryos (E15–
E16) of C57BL/6N or CBP+/2 mice. Cultures were prepared and
maintained in neurobasal medium with B27 supplement as
previously described [23].

Combined oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD); Curcumin
treatment

Immunoblots

In all in vitro experiments, serum-free primary neuronal
cultures were used after DIV 9. OGD experiments were
conducted as previously described [23]. Briefly, culture
medium was removed from cells and preserved. Cells were
rinsed twice with warmed PBS, placed in OGD chamber (a
humidified, temperature-controlled chamber (3660.5uC) at
PO2,2 mmHg). PBS was replaced by a balanced salt solution
(BSS0). OGD was terminated by taking the culture plates out
of the OGD chamber and replacing BSS 0 by conditioned
medium (of 50% fresh cultivating medium and 50% preserved
cell culture medium). At various time points after OGD,
aliquots of the medium were saved for the analysis of cellular
death/viability and determined morphologically by phase
contrast microscopy. For ischemic preconditioning, the duration of OGD was 30 min, whereas OGD duration for injurious
ischemia ranged from 75 min to 150 min. The time interval
between ischemic preconditioning stimulus and injurious OGD
was 24 h. Curcumin was dissolved in DMSO to give a 10 mM
stock solution, diluted in medium to final concentrations of 1–
16 mM. In ischemic preconditioning experiments, Curcumin
was applied to cortical neuronal cell cultures following
preconditioning OGD i.e. 24 h before injurious OGD.
Vehicle-treated cultures received 0.01% DMSO in medium.

GAPDH expression was calculated using the Delta-Cp approach
based on the expression 1.88 – Delta- Cp. The following sequencespecific primers (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany) were used:
GAPDH forward, 59-AGATTGTCAGCAATGCATCCTGC39;
GAPDH reverse, 59-CCTTCTTGATGTCATCATACTTGG39;
Gelsolin forward, 59- CAGCCTCTGACTTCATCTCCAAG39;
Gelsolin reverse, 59-CACGTTGGCAATGTGGCTGGAG-39.

Immunocytochemistry
Primary cortical cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
in PBS as described [23] and incubated with primary antibody
raised against CBP (diluted 1:250, Santa Cruz, secondary antibody
conjugated with Rhodamine X) and DNA counterstaining with
Sytox Green (Invitrogen). Cover slips were mounted using
ImmunoFluor Mounting Medium (ICN Biochemicals, Costa
Mesa, CA, USA). Images were acquired using a Leica fluorescence
microscope and a digital camera.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay for assessment of
cellular injury

ChIP assay was performed using a kit purchased from Upstate
(Lake Placid, NY, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
procedures and modifications described previously [7]. In short,
proteins were formaldehyde cross-linked to chromatin in neurons
and cells were harvested, lysed, and the nuclei were sonicated
(Bandelin, Sonorex Super 10P, Bandelin Electronic, Berlin,
Germany) to shear DNA in lengths between 200 and 1000 base
pairs. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted in
ChIP dilution buffer and pre-cleared using protein A sepharose
slurry containing salmon sperm DNA. Subsequently, the chromatin solution was incubated overnight at 4uC with anti-acetyl
histone H4 and CBP antibodies (see above), along with a nonspecific rabbit IgG immunoprecipitation. Immune complexes were
collected with protein A sepharose, cross-links were reversed for
4 h at 65uC and chromatin-associated proteins were digested by
proteinase K. DNA was then extracted with phenol–chloroform,
precipitated in ethanol and assayed by quantitative real-time PCR
(LightCycler). Thermal cycling started with 10 min at 95uC,
followed by 30 cycles of 95uC for 15 s, 68uC for 10 s and 72uC
for15 s (amplification product data acquisition at 86uC). For
amplification and detection, we used LightCycler Relative
Quantification Software (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). We
performed a calibration of PCR by a serial dilution of a gelsolin
promoter fragment in the range in which we measured the
precipitated genomic DNA. In this range, the PCR efficiency (E)
for gelsolin promoter genomic DNA was 1.83. For normalization
and control, PCR experiments were performed with total (input)
DNA and DNA isolated after the precipitation procedure with
non-specific rabbit IgG. For quantification, we used the input
DNA fraction for normalization and calculated according to the
Delta-Cp approach using the expression 1.83– Delta-Cp. The
following sequence-specific primers (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg,
Germany) were used: Gelsolin promoter forward, 59-GAACCCAGATGTCTCAGAGAT-39; Gelsolin promoter reverse, 59CCGCGCCTCAGACACCCGAC-39.

Neuronal injury after OGD was assessed by the measurement of
LDH in culture medium in a kinetic photometric assay (at
340 nm) at 24 h after the injury paradigm as described [23].

Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) as ischemic
injury and preconditioning paradigms in vivo
Animal experiments were performed according to institutional
and international guidelines. Mice were anesthetized for induction
with 1.5% isofluorane and maintained in 1.0% isoflurane in 70%
N2O and 30% O2 using a vaporizer. Ischemia experiments were
essentially performed as described [27,28]. In brief, brain ischemia
was induced with an 8.0 nylon monofilament coated with a
silicone resin/hardener mixture (Xantopren M Mucosa and
Activator NF Optosil Xantopren, Haereus Kulzer, Germany).
The filament was introduced into the left internal carotid artery up
to the anterior cerebral artery. Thereby, the middle cerebral artery
and anterior choroidal arteries were occluded. Filaments were
withdrawn after 30 min to allow reperfusion. Regional cerebral
blood flow (rCBF) measured using laser-Doppler-flowmetry
(Perimed, Jarfälla, Sweden) fell to less than 20% during ischemia
and returned to approximately 100% within 5 min after
reperfusion in either group (P.0.05). Core temperature during
the experiment was maintained at 36.5uC60.5uC with a feed-back
temperature control unit. As a control, sham-operated mice
underwent identical surgery but did not have the filament inserted.
For ischemic preconditioning, all the surgical procedures were the
same except for the duration of occlusion, which was 5 min. The
time interval between preconditioning occlusion and injurious
occlusion was 24 h.

Determination of brain lesion size
Animals were sacrificed at 24 h after brain ischemia. Brains
were snap-frozen in isopentane for cryostat sectioning. Ischemic
lesion size was measured by computer-assisted volumetry of serial
20 mm-thick hematoxylin stained coronal brain sections (2 mm
apart) as described in detail previously [29]. Lesion volume was
determined by summing up the volumes of each section directly or
indirectly using the following formula: contralateral hemisphere
(mm3) 2 undamaged ipsilateral hemisphere (mm3). The difference
between direct and indirect lesion volumes is likely attributable to
brain swelling.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total cellular RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent and
followed by complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis. The expression of each sample was normalized for RNA preparation and RT
reaction on the basis of its glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA content [26]. For detection of the
amplification products in GAPDH and gelsolin RT-PCR, we used
a LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I Kit (Roche
Molecular Biochemicals, Penzberg, Germany). Thermal cycling
started with 10 min at 95uC, followed by 30 cycles of 95uC for
15 s, 68uC for 10 s and 72uC for 15 s (amplification product data
acquisition at 86uC). For amplification and detection, we used
LightCycler Relative Quantification Software (Roche Molecular
Biochemicals). To determine the RT-PCR efficiency (E), we
analyzed a serial dilution of a GAPDH and gelsolin cDNA over
the range in which we measured cDNA. In this range, the PCR
efficiency (E) for both genes was 1.88. The relative gelsolin to

extracted protein lysates from CBP+/2 and wild-type primary
cortical cultures and carried out Western immunoblotting using
antibodies against acetyl-histone H4 and acetyl-histone H3.
Figure 2B and 2C show a significant reduction in acetylation
levels of both histone H4 and histone H3 in CBP+/2 primary
cortical neurons. These results suggest a causal relationship
between reduced CBP and histone acetylation levels, and
enhanced neuronal vulnerability to ischemic cell death.

Results
Histone acetylation levels are reduced in cortical neurons
after injurious ischemia
To investigate whether acetylation of histones in neurons is
affected by ischemia, we exploited an established in vitro model of
ischemic cell death. In this assay, rat primary cortical neurons
were exposed to injurious oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for
150 min on in vitro day 9 in culture (DIV 9). At 0, 1, 12 and 24 h
after the termination of OGD, proteins were extracted and
analyzed by western blotting. The release of lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) into the culture medium was measured 24 h after OGD as
an indirect marker of cellular disruption. Figure 1 shows that
150 min OGD, which caused significant damage to neurons as
measured by increase in LDH levels (Figure 1A), decreased
acetylation levels of both histone H4 and histone H3 throughout
all the time points examined reaching statistical significance
particularly at 12 and 24 h after OGD (Figure 1B and 1C). In
OGD control cultures, histone acetylation levels did not change.
This result shows that injurious ischemia causes a reduction in bulk
acetylation levels of histone -H4 and -H3 in neurons.

Knock-down of CBP expression enhances neuronal
sensitivity to ischemic injury
In order to pinpoint CBP’s role for neuronal survival, excluding
its other possible effects, e.g. on neuronal development, we
generated miR-shRNAs specifically directed against CBP mRNA
in a lentiviral knockdown system [24]. Three CBP-specific miRshRNAs, each of which target CBP transcript at a different
position, and a nontargeting control miR-shRNA were delivered
into mouse primary cortical cultures at DIV 3 by lentiviral
transduction. Pre-OGD photomicrography on DIV 9 demonstrated high GFP expression in neurons from all four conditions,
ensuring the high efficiency of lentiviral infections (Figure 3A). To
validate knockdown of CBP expression by miR-shRNAs, proteins
were extracted at DIV 9 and western immunoblotting was carried
out using antibodies against CBP, and actin. Figure 3B and 3C
show reduced CBP expression in neurons by all target specific
miR-shRNAs yet CBP-miR-shRNA-3 seemed to be the most
effective miR-shRNA candidate in reducing CBP protein levels.
To characterize the functional consequences of RNA interference
directed against CBP transcript for neurons after ischemic injury,
we exposed mouse primary cortical cultures to 75 or 115 min
OGD on DIV 9, i.e. six days after infection with lentiviruses
expressing miR-shRNAs. After 24 h OGD, neuronal injury was
assessed by GFP-positive cell counts and LDH assay. When
compared to infection with lentivirus-expressing nontargeting
miR-shRNA or non-infected naı̈ve neurons (data not shown),
infection with lentivirus-expressing CBP-specific miR-shRNAs did
not affect basal neuronal viability before OGD or under OGD
control conditions. However, CBP-specific miR-shRNAs sensitized cortical neurons to ischemia-induced cell death, as the
number of GFP-positive living neurons was decreased by all three
miR-shRNAs, in particular by CBP-miR-shRNA-2 and CBPmiR-shRNA-3, at 24 h after injurious OGD for 115 min
(Figure 3D). This finding was further reinforced by LDH
measurements demonstrating that neuronal death was exacerbated by CBP-specific miR-shRNAs and that miR-shRNA-2 and
miR-shRNA-3 enhanced the ischemic damage significantly when
assessed 24 h after severe OGD (Figure 3E). In summary, these
results confirm the causal link between the reduction in CBP
expression levels and increased neuronal sensitivity to ischemic
injury.

CREB-binding protein (CBP) level is reduced in cortical
neurons after injurious ischemia
Next, we tested whether protein levels of CBP, a pivotal histone
acetyltransferase in neurons, were altered in cortical neurons after
an ischemic insult. Again, rat primary cortical cultures were
subjected to OGD for 150 min at DIV, and subsequently proteins
were extracted particularly at early time points, 0, 3, 6, and 24 h
after the termination of OGD. Western immunoblotting using an
antibody against CBP revealed that, compared to control cultures,
CBP protein levels were significantly decreased in neurons at all
the time points examined after injurious OGD (Figure 1D and 1E).
To gain a more detailed insight into CBP reduction after ischemia,
we conducted immunocytochemical staining for CBP using rat
primary cortical cultures immediately after their 150 min exposure
to injurious OGD. We found that CBP protein signal was
decreased in neurons already at the termination of injurious OGD,
i.e 0 h after OGD (Figure 1F). This result demonstrates that
injurious ischemia leads to rapid decrease in CBP protein levels in
neurons.

CBP+/2 neurons are highly sensitive to ischemic injury
To determine CBP’s importance for neuronal survival after
injurious ischemia, we conducted OGD experiments using
cortical neurons from CBP heterozygous knockout (CBP+/2)
mice. CBP+/2 mice are an established model for RubinsteinTaybi syndrome [21] and a useful tool for studies of CBP and
histone acetylation in learning and memory processes [12]. Here,
we exposed primary cortical cultures isolated from CBP+/2, as
well as neurons isolated from wild-type littermate mice, to
injurious OGD for different durations ranging from 75 min to
115 min at DIV 9. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release into the
culture medium was measured 24 h after OGD as an indirect
measurement of cell death. Figure 2A demonstrates that neuronal
damage increased with longer durations of OGD, as expected.
Yet it was further exacerbated in the CBP+/2 cultures,
reaching statistical significance particularly after the longest
OGD durations of 95 min and 115 min. Similar basal LDH
levels in CBP+/2 and wild-type cultures in the OGD control
condition indicated that cell viability under normal culture
conditions did not differ significantly between neurons of the two
genotypes. To study whether histone acetylation levels were
altered in the CBP+/2 neurons under normal conditions, we

Ischemic preconditioning alters neuronal histone
acetylation levels in vitro
We have demonstrated that CBP expression is crucial for the
outcome after injurious OGD and that it determines the threshold
for neuronal survival after ischemic injury in vitro. To test the
hypothesis that histone acetylation status and CBP protein
expression is linked to mechanisms of endogenous neuroprotection, we applied an in vitro model for ischemic preconditioning: Rat
primary cortical cultures were subjected to a short (30 min)
episode of OGD that is not injurious for neurons as a
preconditioning stimulus. After an interval of 24 h, preconditioned
as well as non-preconditioned control cultures were exposed to

histone H4 as well as histone H3 was determined by western
immunoblotting. Figure 4B and 4C suggests a dynamic alteration
of histone H4 and histone H3 acetylation levels in neurons after
their exposure to the 30 min preconditioning OGD. Histone H4
acetylation was significantly increased at 1 h and 24 h, whereas
enhanced histone H3 acetylation was detected already at the
initiation of re-oxygenation (0 h) as well as at 1 h and 24 h after

The injury was significantly reduced in those cultures that had
previously undergone preconditioning OGD. Ischemic preconditioning by itself did not increase LDH release as measured prior to
injurious OGD. To assess whether histone acetylation was altered

a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5A and 5B). We then tested
curcumin’s effects on ischemic preconditioning and exposed
rat primary cortical cultures to 30 min preconditioning OGD.
We directly treated the cultures with 1 mM curcumin until they
were exposed to injurious OGD 24 h afterwards. Measurement
of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release into the culture
medium was carried out to assess cell death 24 h after the
injurious OGD (Figure 5C). Curcumin treatment, although
applied only during the interval between preconditioning
OGD and injurious OGD, partially prevented the reduction of
LDH release by ischemic preconditioning, i.e. curcumin
significantly attenuated the induction of ischemia-tolerant
state in neurons (Figure 5D). This finding suggests that CBP’s
HAT activity, at least in part, plays an important role in
induction of the ischemia-tolerant state in neurons.

Curcumin, a CBP HAT activity inhibitor, attenuates
ischemic preconditioning in primary cortical cultures
Having demonstrated the concurrence of increased acetylation status with an increased resistance of neurons to ischemic
stress after ischemic preconditioning, we wanted to test
whether pharmacological inhibition of HAT activity interferes
with the epigenetic reprogramming necessary to restore
neuron resilience after ischemic preconditioning. For this
purpose, we utilized curcumin, an inhibitor of CBP’s HAT
activity [30]. Firstly, to demonstrate that curcumin has indeed
the expected effect on histone acetylation levels, we treated rat
primary cortical cultures with curcumin at doses of 1, 4 and
16 mM for 24 h, extracted nuclear proteins and carried out
western immunoblotting using antibodies against acetylhistone H4 and acetyl-histone H3. Curcumin reduced acetylation levels of both histone H4 in particular and histone H3 in

contrast, preconditioning did not impact the acetylation status of
histone H4. The specific increase of H3 acetylation early after

promoter gelsolin followed by gelsolin upregulation in vitro. In
summary, our study provides novel insights into the role of CBP
and histone acetylation in conferring neuronal resilience to
ischemia and in endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms underlying ischemic preconditioning. CBP appears to be a promising
target for neuroprotective strategies.

delayed protection afforded by ischemic preconditioning in the
brain depends on the reprogramming of the transcription of genes.
Recent studies have shown a plethora of transcriptional and nontranscriptional mechanisms of endogenous neuroprotection [20].
Here, we focused on epigenetic mechanisms and decided to
investigate the promoter region of gelsolin, a neuroprotective gene
with well-characterized anti-apoptotic and anti-excitotoxic properties [23,27]. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we
studied CBP recruitment and histone acetylation levels at the
gelsolin promoter region in neurons after ischemic preconditioning. Our western immunoblotting results showed an increase in
histone acetylation levels at 1 h after the preconditioning stimuli in
neurons and mouse brain (Figure 4B, 4C, 6D and 6E).
Accordingly, we isolated chromatin from rat cortical neurons at
1 h after the 30 min preconditioning OGD and conducted ChIP
assay using anti-CBP and anti-acetyl-histone H4 antibodies.
Resulting immunoprecipitated DNA served as template for
quantitative real-time PCR experiments with primers encompassing the gelsolin promoter region (position -153 to 150 into the first
exon). CBP recruitment and acetylated histone H4 levels were
significantly increased at the gelsolin promoter region in neurons
after their exposure to ischemic preconditioning, by more than
three-fold and two-fold, respectively (Figure 7A). As CBP
recruitment and increase in histone acetylation at regulatory
genomic loci are expected to activate transcription, we next
measured gelsolin mRNA levels in neurons after ischemic
preconditioning. As shown in Figure 7B, quantitative real-time
RT-PCR demonstrated that gelsolin mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in rat primary cultures 18 h after the 30 min
preconditioning OGD. Although a slight induction of gelsolin
mRNA was observed in control cultures, significant upregulation
was specifically detected in cultures that underwent ischemic
preconditioning. These results suggest that CBP and histone
acetylation are likely parts of neuroprotective mechanisms that are
induced by ischemic preconditioning in neurons.

Ischemic injury leads to reduced histone acetylation and
CBP protein levels in neurons
CBP loss of function was reported to play a critical role in the
pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative conditions including
polyglutamine diseases [31,32], spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 [33],
and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy [34]. In an apoptotic
model of primary neurons, CBP was degraded by apoptotic
caspases decreasing histone acetylation levels [35]. In primary
neuronal cultures transfected with mutant Huntingtin gene, cell
toxicity was accompanied by CBP depletion and histone hypoacetylation [32]. Here, we demonstrate reduced histone acetylation and lower CBP protein levels in neurons after ischemic injury
(Figure 1 and 2). It is currently unknown whether and to what
extent caspases or proteasomal degradation impact on the loss of
CBP after OGD. Our data is consistent with previous reports
showing reduction in histone acetylation levels in mouse brain
after ischemic brain injury and in a global ischemia model [2,8].
Involvement of any HAT or HDAC enzyme was not investigated
in these studies. Although we lack direct evidence for linking
reduction of histone acetylation to loss of CBP, the coordinated
changes in the levels of acetylated histones and CBP in our
experiments suggest that these two events are likely associated. In
keeping with this, reports from various cbp knockout mouse models
demonstrate decreased neuronal histone acetylation in these mice,
underscoring CBP’s importance for acetylating histones in neurons
[12,13,14,36]. Together with our immunocytochemistry result
showing that CBP expression is barely detectable in neurons after
OGD (Figure 1F), these findings suggest a strong link between loss
of CBP, reduction in histone acetylation and neuronal death after
ischemic injury.

Discussion

Reduction of CBP expression exacerbates neuronal
vulnerability to ischemic injury

Impaired histone acetylation and CBP function have been
implicated in cell death in neurodegenerative diseases [18]. Yet,
little is known about their involvement in neuronal survival after
ischemic injury, and no study to date has examined the role of
histone acetylation in ischemic preconditioning in the brain. Our
study rendered the following four major findings: i) CBP protein
loss and decrease of histone acetylation levels occur coordinately
after ischemia and determine the threshold of neuron vulnerability
to ischemic injury; ii) Histone acetylation is involved in endogenous neuroprotection both in vitro and in vivo; iii) Inhibition of
CBP’s HAT activity attenuates ischemic preconditioning in
neurons, and iv) Ischemic preconditioning i.e. endogenous
neuroprotection is linked to epigenetic trans-activation via CBP
recruitment and histone acetylation at the neuroprotective gene

Next, we explored the role of reduced histone acetylation and
CBP levels in neuronal death after ischemia. Various mouse
models have so far been developed and used to study the functions
of CBP in the normal brain [12,13,21,36]. For our purpose, we
used a CBP heterozygous mutant mouse (CBP+/2). Our results
from primary neuronal cultures from the heterozygous mice
showed a clear loss of histone acetylation levels under normal
conditions, and upon exposure to ischemic stress they displayed
increased vulnerability, compared to cultures of wildtype littermates. Interestingly, CBP gene dose reduction did not decrease
neuronal survival at baseline in our in vitro system pointing to a
specific role of CBP in disease related ischemic stress. Congruently,

neuronal culture system, with less than 10% astroglial contamination, indicated that neuroprotection achieved in our model was
probably due to intrinsic neuronal properties. On the other hand,
in our in vivo model histone acetylation levels were strikingly
increased in both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres after
the preconditioning MCAo, implying that systemic mechanisms
are operative in our in vivo model. In support of this notion,
bilateral ischemia tolerance against global brain ischemia was
achieved in rats in a unilateral forebrain ischemic preconditioning
model [37]. Addressing this intriguing phenomenon in our in vivo
model remains a challenge for further investigations.
In vitro, the minimum interval of 24 h required for the
acquisition of ischemia-tolerant state underpins the de novo gene
expression-dependent, delayed pattern of neuronal ischemic
preconditioning in our model. At the level of transcriptional
regulation, evidence has strongly suggested that transcription
factors such as hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), cAMP response
element binding protein (CREB) and nuclear factor kB (NF-kB)
were driving the expression of neuroprotective genes for the
acquisition of ischemic tolerance [38,39]. Interestingly, genomewide approaches showed preconditioning-induced fundamental
reprogramming of the transcriptional response to ischemic injury,
ultimately conferring a neuroprotective phenotype [40,41]. Our
present work provides strong evidence for involvement of histone
acetylation and CBP in brain ischemic preconditioning. While
involvement of histone acetylation in brain ischemic preconditioning was not reported previously, CBP was demonstrated to be
associated with the promoter region of a neuroprotective gene, i.e.
bcl-2 in neurons after preconditioning: [42] Strikingly, it was not
the binding of CREB, but of CBP to the bcl-2 CRE site that
increased after preconditioning ischemia, and blocking CBP
binding to the bcl-2 CRE with U0126 (a kinase inhibitor) reduced
bcl-2 expression and abrogated ischemic tolerance. Here, we
demonstrate that CBP is recruited to the promoter of gelsolin after
ischemic preconditioning, a gene product which has potent
neuroprotective properties [23,27]. This presence correlates with

several recent publications reported a lack of neuronal death in
various CBP loss-of-function mouse models as confirmed by the
absence of neurodegeneration in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome
patients [13,14]. Our findings indicate that although CBP might
not be required for neuronal survival under normal conditions, it is
essential in preserving cell viability after OGD. Partial elimination
of CBP decreased the resistance of neurons to ischemic stress but
did not affect their viability at normal conditions. This notion has
been also reported in another system related to ischemia: The
posttranslational modification system with small ubiquitin-like
modifier protein SUMO2/3 was not essential in the physiological
state of neurons, but its loss of function, if reduced by RNA
interference, significantly exacerbated neuronal vulnerability upon
ischemia-like stress [24]. Moreover, in an effort to exclude possible
compensatory changes in neuronal cultures of heterozygous CBP
mice, we developed a second approach namely by creating/
inducing RNA interference against CBP in neurons. Results from
these experiments further reinforced the causal link between the
reduced CBP protein levels and the increased susceptibility of
neurons to ischemic stress after RNA interference with CBP
compared to control miR-shRNA expressing cultures. Altogether,
our findings indicate a critical role for CBP in neuronal survival
after ischemic injury.

Ischemic preconditioning enhances bulk histone
acetylation levels, induces CBP recruitment and histone
acetylation at gelsolin promoter followed by gelsolin
upregulation and is attenuated by inhibition of CBP’s
HAT activity
Many different mechanisms have been reported to be involved
in the development of brain ischemic preconditioning, including
induction of neuroprotective gene expression [20]. Little is known,
however, about the role of epigenetic changes in preconditioninginduced neuroprotection. We found that bulk levels of acetylated
histones are subject to dynamic changes in two different models of
ischemic preconditioning, in vitro and in vivo. Our near-pure

enhanced levels of acetylated histone H4 at gelsolin promoter. We
then found gelsolin mRNA to be upregulated in neurons after
ischemic preconditioning. Moreover, Curcumin, a CBP’s HAT
activity inhibitor, attenuated ischemic preconditioning-induced
ischemia-tolerant state in neurons. Collectively, our findings
suggest that histone acetylation enhancement at specific neuroprotective gene promoters together with increased CBP recruitment are likely crucial components of the endogenous neuroprotective mechanism of ischemic preconditioning in brain.
