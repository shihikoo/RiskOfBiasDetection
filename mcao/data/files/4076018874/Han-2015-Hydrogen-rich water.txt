Introduction

Brain ischemia can induce serious neuron damage and lead to a
loss of neuronal function. Brain ischemia induces neuron death
through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
increased intracellular Ca2þ, which leads to neurodegeneration
(Shepherd, 2001; Lyden et al., 2006). Previous studies have shown
crosstalk and reciprocal interactions between Ca2þ and ROS, and
there is considerable evidence that ROS and the reduction–
oxidation state can signiﬁcantly modulate Ca2þ signaling
(Feissner et al., 2009; Peng and Jou, 2010).
Ohsawa et al. (2007) have reported that molecular hydrogen
acts as a novel antioxidant and can selectively reduce ∙OH and
ONOO– without affecting physiological ROS. Other previous
studies have shown that hydrogen-rich water (HRW) can attenuate the overproduction of ROS and protect neuron against
oxidative stress (Fu et al., 2009; Gu et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010;
Hou et al., 2012). Hydrogen-rich water also shows a neuroprotective effect during focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury
induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and
decreases excitotoxic agent-induced damage (Liu et al., 2011).
Subsequent studies have conﬁrmed that the consumption of
hydrogen reduces oxidative stress in a diverse range of disorders
and organ systems including the digestive (Chen et al., 2011;
Zheng et al., 2009), cardiovascular (Hayashida et al., 2008; Nakao
et al., 2010) and respiratory systems (Mao et al., 2009). These
studies strongly suggest the potential for molecular hydrogen to
be an effective therapeutic and preventive antioxidant.
Rosenthal et al. (1987) have shown that an increase in the
inﬂux of intracellular Ca2þ can induce neuron death, whereas
the blockade of Ca2þ preserves neurons against ischemic injury.
The regulation of intracellular Ca2þ is key to determining the fate
of neuronal cells (Heizmann and Hunziker, 1991; Baimbridge
et al., 1992), and calcium-binding proteins play important roles in
physiological processes, including cell cycle regulation, the
organization of microtubules, and muscle contraction
(Heizmann and Hunziker, 1991; Baimbridge et al., 1992). Parvalbumin is one type of calcium-buffering protein and is structurally related to trophonin C and calmodulin (Cates et al., 2002;
Heizmann and Berchtold, 1987). Hippocalcin, which is also
involved in calcium signaling, is a critical member of the
neuronal calcium sensor family and has four separate calciumbinding sites (Lindholm et al., 2002). Parvalbumin and hippocalcin can bind to Ca2þ released into the cytoplasm via high afﬁnity
Ca2þ-binding domains. Parvalbumin and hippocalcin play important roles in the maintenance of Ca2þ homeostasis under
physiological and pathological conditions; thus, these proteins
are regard as Ca2þ buffer proteins (Cates et al., 2002; Heizmann
and Berchtold, 1987; Lindholm et al., 2002). Calcium overloading
can induce neuron damage, and an increase in intracellular Ca2þ
levels is a feature of several brain disorders (Bleakman et al.,

1993; Manev et al., 1989). Taking into consideration the crosstalk
and reciprocal interactions between Ca2þ and ROS, we hypothesized that there could be a relationship between the neuroprotective effects of HRW against ischemic brain injury and the
regulation of the expression of calcium buffering proteins.
However, little is known about the effects of hydrogen-rich water
on parvalbumin and hippocalcin expression in the brain and in
neurons following ischemic injury. Thus, we investigated the
neuroprotective effects of HRW and the expression of calcium
buffering proteins in the presence of hydrogen-rich water during
MCAO-induced ischemic brain injury and during glutamate
toxicity-induced neuron damage.

Results

2.1.
HRW treatment reduces infarct volume and improves
neurological score
To conﬁrm the neuroprotective effects of HRW against ischemic
cerebral injury, we analyzed the infarct volume at 1 d following
ischemic brain injury. HRW treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the
infarct volume compared with that of the H2O-treated animals in
the MCAO groups (Fig. 1A). The ischemic lesion volume was
99.1578.45 mm3 and 60.2277.27 mm3 in the MCAOþH2O and
MCAOþHRW animals, respectively (Fig. 1B). The neurological
scores of rats receiving MCAO improved following HRW treatment. The neurological scores were signiﬁcantly reduced in the
MCAOþH2O group (po0.05 vs. sham), and HRW treatment at 1, 7
and 14 d after brain injury signiﬁcantly improved neurological
function (po0.01 vs. MCAOþH2O group), although neurological
dysfunction was still observed (po0.05 vs. sham group) (Fig. 1C).

2.2.
HRW prevented the injury-induced decrease of
parvalbumin and hippocalcin expression after ischemic brain
injury in vivo
Changes in parvalbumin and hippocalcin levels in the H2O- and
HRW-treated animals were analyzed by Western blot and immunohistochemical methods. From our Western blot analysis, at 1, 7
and 14 d following ischemic brain injury, the expression levels of
parvalbumin in the cerebral cortices of the H2O-treated animals
were lower than the HRW-treated animals (Fig. 2A). At the same
time point, the hippocalcin protein expression levels in the
hipocampus of the H2O-treated animals were also lower than
the HRW-treated animals (Fig. 2B). In addition, immunohistochemical staining showed that the numbers of parvalbumin- and
hippocalcin-positive cells were signiﬁcantly decreased in the
cerebral cortices of the MCAOþH2O animals compared to those
in the shamþH2O group. HRW treatment prevented the injuryinduced decrease in the numbers of parvalbumin- and

hippocalcin-positive cells at all time points (Fig. 3A and B). The
numbers of parvalbumin-positive cells at 1, 7 and 14 d after brain
injury in MCAOþH2O group were lower than MCAOþHRW group.
At the same time points, the numbers of hippocalcin-positive
cells in MCAOþH2O group were also lower than MCAOþHRW
group (Fig. 3C and D). All the differences above were statistically
signiﬁcant (po0.05). These data indicate that HRW could signiﬁcantly prevent the injury-induced decrease in parvalbumin
and hippocalcin expression following ischemic brain injury.

2.3.
HRW exerts a dose-dependent neuroprotective effect
against cellular oxidative damage and reduced the elevated
intracellular Ca2þ levels caused by glutamate in neuronal cells
To examine the protective effects of HRW against cellular
oxidative damage caused by glutamate, we measured the
viability of the cells by PI/DAPI double-staining. As shown in
Fig. 4A, glutamate exposure resulted in signiﬁcant cellular death.
HRW had a dose-dependent neuroprotective effect on
glutamate-treated primary rat cerebral cortical neuronal cells

related to the number of apoptotic cells. Compared to the
viability of cells exposed to only glutamate, the number of
apoptotic cells decreased in the groups treated with 0.625%,
1.25% and 2.5% HRW following glutamate exposure (Fig. 4B). The
concentration of intracellular Ca2þ is important for determining
the neuroprotective effects of HRW; thus, we measured Ca2þ
levels in primary rat cerebral cortical neuronal cells. Glutamate
treatment signiﬁcantly increased the concentration of intracellular Ca2þ in primary rat cerebral cortical neuronal cells, whereas
HRW treatment following glutamate exposure decreased intracellular Ca2þ levels compared to the levels in the glutamatetreated group (Fig. 4C). Moreover, HRW also exerts a dosedependent effect in the regulation of intracellular Ca2þ levels.

HRW treatment prevents the decrease in parvalbumin
and hippocalcin levels caused by glutamate in a dosedependent manner in vitro

cells were decreased dramatically in glutamate-exposed cells,
whereas treatment with HRW prevented this decrease in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). The expression levels of
parvalbumin and hippocalcin in the glutamate-exposed
group were all lower than cells treated with 0.625%, 1.25%,
and 2.5% HRW, and all the differences above were statistically
signiﬁcant (po0.05).

Discussion

Over the past few years, studies on hydrogen therapy have
attracted the attention of scientists and physicians (Hong
et al., 2010). Hydrogen has been shown to act as an important
physiological regulatory factor with anti-oxidant, antiinﬂammatory, anti-apoptotic and other protective effects in
cells and organs that could be applied in the treatment of
various diseases (Grynkyewicz et al., 1985). Several intake
methods of hydrogen, including inhalation, drinking HRW
and injection of hydrogen-rich saline, have been developed
and shown to be valid and reliable (Ohsawa et al., 2007).
Hydrogen inhalation, however, is not considered to be convenient and may be not safe because hydrogen is inﬂammable and explosive if the concentration in the air is greater

than 4% (Liu et al., 2011). Compared to hydrogen gas,
hydrogen-rich saline and HRW are safe, economical and
easily available. Injection with hydrogen-rich saline might
be more convenient for short-term treatments following
acute injury, but daily injections over a long period of time
could become overly stressful (Xin et al., 2014). Moreover, our
previous study showed that long-term intraperitoneal injections can easily cause intestinal obstruction from accidental
injections into the intestine. In contrast, the oral intake of
HRW is an effective and convenient way to deliver molecular
hydrogen and is more suitable for therapeutic applications
(Noda et al., 2012; Cardinal et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012). In
addition, the oral intake of HRW to deliver the hydrogen
molecule is similar to physiological drinking behavior. Therefore, we chose the oral intake of HRW as the route of
administration for this study.
Ischemic brain injury dramatically induces neuronal death
via the production of ROS and an increase in intracellular
Ca2þ. The cerebral is especially vulnerable to oxidative injury
and Ca2þ overload because of the overabundance of polyunsaturated fatty acids in brain tissues (Hall and Braughler,
1993). Moreover, oxidative stress itself can also produce free
radicals then leads to an excessive increase in Ca2þ activity
(Koh, 2012). Elevated intracellular calcium can activate

calpain and induce its translocation from the cytosol to the
membrane. There, it cleaves procaspase-12 resulting in
caspase-12 activation, which in turn activates caspase-3 leading to cellular apoptosis, which is an important mechanism
responsible for the pathological changes that occur in neurodegenerative diseases (Suzuki et al., 1987; Hitomi et al., 2004).
Cai has reported that the application of hydrogen could reduce
the activities of caspase-12 and caspase-3 by quenching ROS
and Ca2þ changes in ischemia-induced neuronal injury, thus
preventing neuronal damage (Cai et al., 2008). Parvalbumin
and hippocalcin, both calcium buffering proteins, can reduce
intracellular calcium levels and exert protective effects against
excitotoxicity- and calcium-induced cell damage through the
inhibition of caspase-3 (Tome et al., 2006; Van Den Bosch et al.,
2002; Masuo et al., 2007; Korhonen et al., 2005). This caspase
could be a key point linking hydrogen with parvalbumin and
hippocalcin. Our measurements of infarct volume and neurological scores in three time points veriﬁed the in vivo neuroprotective effects of hydrogen-rich water against ischemic
brain injury. Furthermore, our Western blot and immunohistochemical clearly conﬁrm that ischemic cerebral injury
decreases parvalbumin and hippocalcin levels. Hydrogen-rich
water prevented this ischemic brain injury-induced decrease
in the expression of both proteins in all three time points and
it showed an improved neuroprotective effect tendency as the
continuation of the HRW treatment. The decrease in parvalbumin and hippocalcin during ischemia-induced injury is
likely to result in an increase in intracellular Ca2þ levels,
thereby causing neuron injury. Therefore, the maintenance
of parvalbumin and hippocalcin is a signiﬁcant factor in the
survival of neurons during ischemic brain injury. Our research
demonstrates that hydrogen-rich water can protect against
ischemic cerebral injury by regulating the expression of
calcium buffering proteins, speciﬁcally parvalbumin and hippocalcin, in ischemic cerebral injury and consequently can
contribute to the homeostasis of intracellular Ca2þ levels.
Maher has reported that glutamate treatment could lead to
neuron death via the induction of oxidative stress (Maher and
Davis, 1996). Our current research shows that glutamate
exposure can induce neuronal apoptosis and decrease parvalbumin and hippocalcin expression levels in primary rat
cerebral cortical neurons, whereas hydrogen-rich water treatment reduced neuronal apoptosis and attenuated the decrease
of parvalbumin and hippocalcin in a dose-dependent manner.
The inactivation of those calcium buffering proteins could
disturb Ca2þ regulation and might result in neuron death.
Thus, the maintenance of calcium-buffering protein levels is
of great importance. Moreover, our research clearly shows that
glutamate treatment signiﬁcantly increases intracellular Ca2þ
levels, and hydrogen-rich water could prevent this increase in
Ca2þ levels. Both in vitro and in vivo researches consistently
show that hydrogen-rich water can modulate parvalbumin
and hippocalcin expression and exert a neuroprotective effect
following ischemic neuronal damage.
Most previous studies have focused on the anti-oxidant or
anti-inﬂammatory effects of hydrogen-rich water during ischemic
brain injury, but our research suggests that there might be a side
effect of hydrogen in terms of oxidative stress. In other words,
hydrogen could also regulate the expression of calcium buffering
proteins and prevent the ischemic injury-induced decrease in

135

parvalbumin and hippocalcin, therefore reducing calcium overload and leading to the survival of neurons. This study is the
ﬁrst to demonstrate this function of hydrogen. One potential
limitation of our research is that the cognitive effect of HRW
during ischemic brain injury was not investigated, and further
researches are required to expound the complex relationship
between hydrogen-rich water and calcium buffering proteins
during ischemic cerebral injury. Taken together, our results
support the hypothesis that hydrogen-rich water exerts a
neuroprotective effect by modulating the expression of parvalbumin and hippocalcin during ischemic cerebral injury.

Experimental procedures

4.1.
Experimental animals and preparation of Hydrogenrich water (HRW)
The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of the Tongji Medical
College of Huazhong Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.
The study was conducted using male Sprague–Dawley rats
(240–260 g) (Animal Feeding Center of Tongji Medical College
of Huazhong University of Science and Technology). All rats
were housed (5 per cage) in clear, pathogen-free polycarbonate cages in the animal care facility and were fed a standard
animal diet and water ad libitum under controlled temperature with a 12-h light-dark cycle. The study was approved by
the Animal Research Committee of Tongji Medical College of
Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The animals received care according to the criteria outlined in the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Before
initiating the experiments, the animals were adapted to the
laboratory conditions. HRW was produced by Beijing Huoli
Qingyuan Co., Ltd. (China) and was stored under atmospheric
pressure at 4 1C in an aluminum bag without dead volume.
Gas chromatography was used to conﬁrm the content of
hydrogen by the method described by Ohsawa et al. (2007).
The hydrogen concentration of the HRW used in this study
was 0.63–0.82 mmol/L.

4.2.

Study design

The animals were randomly divided into four groups,
shamþdistilled water, shamþHRW, MCAOþdistilled water,
and MCAOþHRW (n¼ 10 for each group). Distilled water or
HRW (6 ml/kg per rat) was orally administered everyday by
gavage (daily at 10:00 AM) for 7 days prior to and following
surgery (Zhang et al., 2014). On the 8th day, MCAO surgery was
performed, and rates were sacriﬁced on the 9th, 15th, and
22nd days to collect brain tissue samples.

4.3.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)

MCAO was surgically performed using a previously described
method (Longa et al., 1989). The animals were anesthetized
with sodium pentobarbital (32 mg/kg). First, we exposed the
right common carotid artery and cut the external carotid
artery, then a 4/0 nylon monoﬁlament with a rounded tip was
thrusted into the exposed right external carotid artery and

136

brain research 1615 (2015) 129–138

advanced into the internal carotid artery. Twenty-four hours
after the onset of occlusion, the nylon monoﬁlament was
removed and brain tissue samples were collected at different
time points. We used a self-regulating heating blanket to
maintain animals' rectal temperature at 37.0 1C throughout
surgery. After MCAO surgery, mice were singly housed and
temperature was monitored for 24 h (1 d group) or 48 h (7 d
group and 14 d group) to maintain a core temperature of
434 1C as described previously (Barber et al., 2004).

4.4.

Neurological scores

Neurological function was assessed 1, 7 and 14 days after
MCAO using a standard scoring system (Menzies et al., 1992):
0¼ no apparent deﬁcits, 1 ¼contralateral forelimb ﬂexion,
2¼ decreased grip of contralateral forelimb, 3 ¼contralateral
circling if pulled by tail, 4 ¼spontaneous contralateral circling.

4.5.

Measurement of infarct volume

To conﬁrm the neuroprotective effects of HRW, brains were
sectioned into 2-mm coronal slices by a brain matrix, and the
infarct volume was determined by 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC, Sigma) staining as previously described (Lee
et al., 2005). The stained slices were photographed by a digital
camera and the ischemic lesion was measured by an image
analysis system (Image J software). We used the Cavalieri
formula [Volume¼ΣS  t  ISF] to calculate total infarcted
volume, S means sum of the corrected infarcted area surfaces
(mm2), t means section thickness (1.5 mm) and ISF means
inverse of the sampling fraction (sampling fraction 1/7)
(Quintard et al., 2014).

4.6.

Western blot analysis

Western blot analysis of parvalbumin expression levels in the
cerebral cortices and hippocalcin expression levels in the
hippocampus was performed in our study. Tissues were
dissolved in buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1%
Triton X-100) containing 10 μM leupeptin and 200 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride using a homogenizer. After centrifuging at 12,000g for 20 min at 4 1C, the supernatants were
collected. The protein concentration was determined using a
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit. Boiled samples underwent electrophoresis in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.
The membranes were then incubated with anti-parvalbumin
and anti-hippocalcin (diluted 1:1000; Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA) for 1 h at room temperature and visualized using the
Odyssey infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).

4.7.

Immunohistochemical staining

We used ﬁve animals from each group for immunohistochemical staining. 8 μm-thick samples were ﬁxed in 10% formalin
solution and embedded in parafﬁn. Then the sections were
incubated with anti-parvalbumin and anti-hippocalcin (diluted
1:200; Abcam) overnight at 4 1C, following with goat anti-rabbit
IgG for one hour. Slides were then observed under a microscope, counting positive cells and photographed. We selected

the cortical region close to infarct cortical area and CA3 area of
hippocampus for the positive cell counting. Four view ﬁelds per
brain slice were assessed and the average number of positive
cells was obtained.

4.8.

Cell culture and treatment

Our study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals of the National Research Council. Fetal SD rats of 16–
18 days gestation were obtained from the Animal Feeding
Center of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of
Science and Technology. Primary rat brain cortical neurons
were cultured from fetal SD rats as described (Yan et al.,
2012). Cells were seeded at a density of 1  106 cells/well in 12well plates The cells were grown in a humid incubator, and
the media was replaced every 3 days. We used these cells
after 14 days of culture. During the cell culture period, the cell
density was monitored to maintain at 70% or less confluence
(Feng and Zhang, 2004). Glutamate was added to a ﬁnal
concentration of 5 mM in the culture medium, and the cells
were incubated for 24 h. Hydrogen-rich water was added to
ﬁnal concentrations of 0.625%, 1.25% or 2.5% (5 μl, 10 μl or
20 μl HRW added to 800 μl culture medium) 30 min before and
6 h, 12 h and 18 h after glutamate treatment.

4.9.

DAPI/PI doubles staining

Cell death was measured using propidium iodide (PI) and 4,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) double-staining. Cells were
stained with PI and DAPI and then manually counted under a
ﬂuorescent microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) 24 h following
glutamate treatment. All cells were stained blue with DAPI
under UV ﬂuorescence, and apoptotic cells were stained red
with PI under green ﬂuorescence. The analysis was conducted in a blind manner, i.e., the observer had no knowledge
of the identity of the samples.

4.10.

Measurement of intracellular Ca2þ concentration

The concentration of intracellular Ca2þ was measured by the
calcium indicator acetoxymethylester fura-2 AM as previously
described (Malgaroli et al., 1987). First, the cells were incubated
in DMEM containing 10 μM fura-2 at 37 1C for 1 h. The emitted
fura-2 AM ﬂuorescence was recorded from neurons on coverslips in a perfusion chamber of epiﬂuorescence microscope
following excitation at 340710 and 380710 nm, corresponding
to the Ca2þ-bound and Ca2þ-free forms of the indicator,
respectively, using a xenon short-arc lamp. A spectroﬂuorometer (PTI Deltascan) was used to collect and measure the
emitted fura-2 ﬂuorescence. Autoﬂuorescence from unloaded
neurons was generally o5% of that of the fura-2-loaded
neurons and was subtracted automatically from the fura-2ﬂuorescence recordings. We made the mean ratio value after a
3 min recording taken at the beginning of the experiment as
our baseline mean ratio value (R mean). Calcium oscillations
were expressed as the R[340]/R[380] mean and were deﬁned as
variations within 10% of the R mean occurring synchronously
in several cells of the ﬁeld. Ratio method as previously
described was used to determine the intracellular calcium

concentration (Grynkyewicz et al., 1985). [Ca2þ]i¼Kd(R Rmin)/
(RmaxR)Sf2/Sb2. Kd is the dissociation constant of fura-2 for
Ca2þ and R is the ﬂuorescence ratio at 340 and 380 nm. Rmin is
the ratio with zero Ca2þ while Rmax is the ratio with saturating Ca2þ. Sf2/ Sb2 is ﬂuorescence at 380 nm in the absence of
Ca2þ/ saturating Ca2þ (Koh, 2012).

Statistical analysis

The data in our study are expressed as the mean7S.E.M. The
intensity analysis of the Western blot experiments was
carried out using Odyssey infrared Imaging System (LI-COR
Biosciences). Each group results were compared by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Scheffe's post-hoc
test as applicable using SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
A po0.05 was considered to represent statistical signiﬁcance.
