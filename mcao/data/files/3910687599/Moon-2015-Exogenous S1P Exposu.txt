Initial and recurrent stroke produces central nervous system (CNS) damage, involving neuroinflammation. Receptor-mediated
S1P signaling can influence neuroinflammation and has been implicated in cerebral ischemia through effects on the immune
system. However, S1P-mediated events also occur within the brain itself where its roles during stroke have been less well studied.
Here we investigated the involvement of S1P signaling in initial and recurrent stroke by using a transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion/reperfusion (M/R) model combined with analyses of S1P signaling. Gene expression for S1P receptors and involved
enzymes was altered during M/R, supporting changes in S1P signaling. Direct S1P microinjection into the normal CNS induced
neuroglial activation, implicating S1P-initiated neuroinflammatory responses that resembled CNS changes seen during initial M/R
challenge. Moreover, S1P microinjection combined with M/R potentiated brain damage, approximating a model for recurrent stroke
dependent on S1P and suggesting that reduction in S1P signaling could ameliorate stroke damage. Delivery of FTY720 that removes
S1P signaling with chronic exposure reduced damage in both initial and S1P-potentiated M/R-challenged brain, while reducing
stroke markers like TNF-ùõº. These results implicate direct S1P CNS signaling in the etiology of initial and recurrent stroke that can
be therapeutically accessed by S1P modulators acting within the brain.

1. Introduction
Cerebral ischemia produced during stroke is triggered by
sudden lack of blood flow and subsequent reperfusion of
the ischemic area. Within a few minutes of onset, neurons
in the ischemic core are irreversibly injured, which in part
determines the fate of brain tissue in the penumbra areas after
stroke [1]. Brain damage results from a cascade of cellular
and molecular events, including energy failure, excitotoxicity,
oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation [2], the latter of
which is characterized by CNS infiltration of immune cells
and activation of neuroglia such as microglia and astrocytes; neuroinflammation also results in the production of a
variety of neurotoxic molecules, including proinflammatory
cytokines, all of which produce brain damage [1, 3, 4].

Recurrent stroke, which is a common sequel to an initial
stroke, leads to worsened patient outcomes and is thought to
be a major cause of morbidity and mortality among initial
stroke survivors. Neuroinflammation has been associated
with an increased risk of recurrent stroke following transient
ischemic attack and may contribute to more severe damage
[5‚Äì10]. Several proinflammatory factors have been reported
to be active in recurrent stroke, including IL-6, TNF-ùõº,
lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 , C-reactive protein,
and fibrinogen [9, 11‚Äì14].
Another molecule implicated in neuroinflammation is
the lysophospholipid known as sphingosine 1-phosphate
(S1P), produced by the phosphorylation of sphingosine by
two kinases, sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 (SPHK1 and SPHK2)
[15], which acts predominantly as an extracellular signaling

2
molecule through 5, cognate G protein-coupled receptors
[16]. This lipid signaling system has been extensively studied
in neuroinflammatory processes associated with multiple
sclerosis (MS) [17‚Äì20] through actions on both immune and
CNS cells, where reductions in signaling promote therapeutic
efficacy [21‚Äì26]. In addition to MS, S1P signaling has also
been implicated in other CNS pathologies including Sandhoff disease and demyelination [21, 26‚Äì30]. Prior reports
implicated S1P signaling in cerebral ischemia where it was
presumed to act through effects on immune cells, including
elevated S1P levels [31] and that the nonselective S1P receptor
modulator, FTY720 (fingolimod), a current therapy for MS
[17‚Äì20], reduces brain damage in cerebral ischemia [32‚Äì
36]. Intriguingly, fingolimod improved outcomes in a proofof-concept clinical trial of 23 patients with intracerebral
hemorrhage at both acute (days) and chronic (months) time
points [37], consistent with S1P signaling effects in human
stroke.
In this study, we have assessed the possibility of direct
CNS S1P receptor signaling in M/R models of stroke and
focusing on changes occurring within the brain. We report
that local increases in S1P within the brain potentiate damage
produced by transient focal cerebral ischemia (M/R), which
may represent a new model for recurrent stroke, particularly
in view of the effects on markers like TNF-ùõº. Importantly,
we report that S1P receptor modulation using FTY720 can
reduce stroke damage in both primary and recurrent stroke
models.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Animals. All animal experiments were conducted in
accordance with the Center of Animal Care and Use (CACU)
guidelines of Lee Gil Ya Cancer and Diabetes Institute (LCDI)
at Gachon University (numbers of approved animal protocols: LCDI-2012-0075 and LCDI-2014-0016). Adult male ICR
mice (28‚Äì32 g, 7 weeks old) were purchased from the Orient
Co., Ltd. (Korea), and were housed under controlled temperature (22 ¬± 2‚àò C), constant humidity, and a 12 h light/dark cycle
(light on 07:00‚Äì19:00), with food and water made available
ad libitum. After S1P microinjection or middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) and reperfusion (M/R) surgery (Figure 1,
experimental scheme), mice were housed 4 per cage with
moist food and soft bedding materials to reduce suffering
until they were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation or used for
sampling.
2.2. Materials. S1P [D-erythro-sphingosine-1-phosphate]
was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipid (Alabaster, AL).
FTY720 [2-amino-2-[2-(octyl-phenyl) ethyl]-1,3-propanediol hydrochloride] was kindly provided by Novartis AG
(Basel). 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium (TTC), 3,3Û∏Ä† -diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB), fatty-acid-free BSA (FAFBSA), mouse monoclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) antibody, anti-ùõΩ-actin antibody, cresyl violet acetate,
and protease inhibitor cocktail were purchased from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO). Silicon (Variotime) and Zoletil
50 were obtained from Heraeus Kulzer GmbH (Germany)

and Virbac (Carros, France), respectively. Goat polyclonal
anti-Iba1 and rabbit polyclonal anti-TNF-ùõº antibodies were
purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Avidin-biotinperoxidase complex (ABC) kit and Vectashield were purchased from Vector Laboratories, Inc. (Burlingame, CA).
Fluoro-Jade B was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula,
CA).
2.3. Microinjection of S1P at Corpus Callosum (CC). S1P
was dissolved in DMSO with 1 N HCL (95 : 5 v/v, 20 mM)
and diluted in 10% FAF-BSA to make a stock (2 mM;
1 nmole/0.5ùúáL). S1P (1 nmol/0.5 ùúáL dissolved in 10% FAFBSA) was injected at 0.1 ùúáL/min into the right CC of mice
anesthetized with the mixture of Zoletil 50 (10 mg/kg, i.m.)
and Rompun (3 mg/kg, i.m.). Stereotaxic coordinates were as
follows: AP (anteroposterior) = +0.9 mm anterior to bregma,
ML (mediolateral) = ¬±1.0 mm, and DV (dorsoventral) =
‚àí2.15 mm. For control mice, 10% FAF-BSA solution containing the same amount of DMSO and HCl was used as vehicle
instead of S1P. These mice were used for additional experiments 24 h after microinjection, including M/R challenge
(60 min of MCAO) and histological analysis.
2.4. Induction of Transient Focal Cerebral Ischemia. M/Rinduced focal ischemia was produced by an intraluminal
suture method as reported [38, 39]. Briefly, mice were
anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in N2 O and O2 (70 : 30)
and maintained on 1.5% isoflurane. MCAO was induced
by inserting a 9 mm long 5-0 nylon monofilament coated
with silicon from the bifurcation to the MCA. In general,

Mediators of Inflammation
blood flow was restored 90 or 60 min after MCAO by
carefully withdrawing the monofilament to allow complete
reperfusion of the ischemic area under anesthesia. The latter
condition (60 min of MCAO) was used to determine damage
in recurrent stroke-mimicking situations. Sham-operated
animals underwent the same surgical procedure without
insertion of nylon monofilament. During the surgery, body
temperature was maintained at 37 ¬± 0.5‚àò C using a heating pad
(Biomed S.L., Spain).
2.5. FTY720 Administration. FTY720 was dissolved in saline
(0.15 M NaCl) and intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered into
mice at 3 mg/kg 30 min before S1P microinjection or MCAO
surgery to determine its effect on neuroinflammation via
S1P exposure or on brain damage by S1P + M/R challenge.
Alternatively, FTY720 was administered to mice immediately
after reperfusion to determine its therapeutic effect in 90 min
M/R-challenged mice. For the control group, an equal volume
of saline was administered.
2.6. Measurement of Functional Neurological Deficit Score
and Infarct Volume. Twenty-two hours after reperfusion,
the neurological functions of mice were assessed, including
motor function, sensory function, reflex, and balance, using
a well-known modified neurological severity score (mNSS),
as described previously [39, 40].
Brains obtained 22 h after reperfusion were used to
measure infarct volume by staining brain sections (2 mm
thickness) with 2% TTC in saline for 30 min. TTC-stained
sections were photographed and analyzed using an image
J software (National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda,
MD). The infarct volume (%) was calculated for each mouse
brain by dividing the lesion volume with the total volume.
2.7. Histology. Mice were anesthetized with the mixture
of Zoletil 50 (10 mg/kg, i.m.) and Rompun (3 mg/kg,
i.m.) and perfused transcardially with ice-cold 50 mM
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde. The brains were removed, postfixed in
4% paraformaldehyde containing 30% sucrose solution (in
50 mM PBS), and frozen with OCT solution. Cryostat sections (20 ùúám) were used for staining or immunohistochemistry.
For the determination of cell survival or death, cryostat
sections were processed for Nissl or Fluoro-Jade B staining as
in our previous report [39].
Tissue sections were also used for immunohistochemistry
as follows. Tissue sections were treated with 1% hydrogen
peroxide in PBS for 15 min, blocked with 5% normal serum
containing 0.3% Triton-100, and labeled with primary antibodies, such as goat anti-Iba1 (1 : 500), mouse anti-GFAP
(1 : 500), or rabbit anti-TNF-ùõº (1 : 100) antibody. The sections
were labeled with appropriate biotinylated antibodies (1 : 200)
followed by incubation with ABC solution (1 : 100) and then
developed with a solution containing 0.02% DAB and 0.01%
H2 O 2 .
Images were taken from each section using a brightfield or fluorescent microscope equipped with a DP72

3
camera (Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan). For quantification
of immunopositive cells, brain sections of 3‚àº5 mice were
analyzed: the number for a mouse brain section was taken
after calculating a mean value from 3 images (20x) of each
section.
2.8. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Semiquantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted using RNAiso Plus
(Takara) from mouse brain hemisphere subjected to surgical
procedure after perfusion with ice-cold PBS and cDNA was
synthesized according to the manufacturer‚Äôs protocols (AffinityScript reverse transcription). qRT-PCR was performed
using a Stratagene Mx3005p (Agilent Technologies, Inc.,
USA) and SYBR Green PCR master mix (Agilent Technologies). Gene expression was quantified using the comparative
threshold method and data were calculated as fold changes
relative to each gene of sham group after normalization to a
reference gene, ùõΩ-actin. Alternatively, 2x master mix (Takara,
Japan) was used to conduct semiquantitative RT-PCR. The
sequences of all primer sets are listed in Table 1.
2.9. Statistical Analysis. All data are presented as mean ¬±
SEM and statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad
Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA)
as specified. Differences among the groups were analyzed
by one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test for
multiple comparisons. Comparisons between the two groups
were performed using paired Student‚Äôs ùë°-test. The statistical
significance was set at ùëÉ < 0.05.

3. Results
3.1. Expression Levels of S1P Signaling-Related Genes Are
Altered in M/R-Challenged Mouse Brain. We examined
whether transient cerebral ischemia influences gene expression levels of S1P receptors (S1P1‚Äì5 ) and S1P-producing
enzymes (sphingosine kinase 1/2, SPHK1/2) within the brain.
Temporal changes in S1P receptors and SPHK1/2 gene expression were assessed by qRT-PCR or semiquantitative RTPCR, 22 h after M/R reperfusion, as compared to ùõΩ-actin
controls. In the normal mouse brain, 4 of 5 S1P receptors
were expressed, including S1P1 , S1P2 , S1P3 , and S1P5 , with
particularly high expression of S1P1 (Figure 2(a)). In M/Rchallenged brains, mRNA expression of S1P3 and SPHK1
was significantly upregulated compared with sham-operated
brains, with differences 3- to 4-fold higher (Figure 2(b)).
In contrast, S1P1 was downregulated in the M/R group
(Figure 2(b)). When semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis was
employed, S1P1 downregulation was confirmed as observed
in data from qRT-PCR analysis. Interestingly, the lowered
expression level of S1P1 was still higher than the upregulated
S1P3 in M/R-challenged brains (Figure 2(c)). These results
indicate that S1P receptor expression is altered by cerebral
ischemia.

ischemia in view of changes to S1P signaling molecules. To
determine whether direct activation of S1P receptors induces
changes in activation of microglia and astrocytes, immunohistochemistry was used to assess the microglia/macrophagespecific marker Iba1 or the astrocyte-specific marker GFAP.
S1P microinjection was used to localize S1P at the level of
the corpus callosum via defined stereotaxic coordinates (see
Section 2) to produce uniform and reproducible exposure.
Immunohistochemistry of normal, injected brains revealed
increased Iba1-immunopositive cell numbers as compared
with vehicle-injected controls (18.50 ¬± 11.36 to 67.80 ¬± 11.41:
370%) (Figure 3(a)). In addition, S1P microinjection induced
an increase in GFAP-immunopositive cells (116.4 ¬± 14.91 to
244.4 ¬± 59.45: 210%) (Figure 3(b)). These neuroinflammatory
outcomes were reduced by pretreatment of FTY720 (3 mg/kg,
i.p.; Figure 3), a nonselective S1P receptor modulator that acts
as a functional antagonist of, at least, S1P1 [17, 36]. These
results indicate that activation of S1P receptors induces neuroinflammatory changes for neuroglia that can be prevented
by pharmacological modulation of S1P receptor activities.
3.3. FTY720 Reduces M/R-Induced Brain Infarction and Neuroglial Activation. To determine the role of S1P receptor
signaling in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia, mice were
challenged by M/R (90 min of occlusion) and compared to
the same challenge except that animals were exposed to
FTY720 (3 mg/kg, i.p.) immediately after reperfusion. Brain
damage as a percentage of total brain was then assessed
by TTC staining of sampled serial sections from the entire
brain taken 22 h later (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). M/R induced
brain infarction by 28.08 ¬± 2.347%, which was reduced
by FTY720 administration to 22.00 ¬± 1.586% (Figure 4(b)).
Brain damage was also determined 22 h after reperfusion
based on neurological score, showing that FTY720 exposure recovered damaged neurological functions in cerebral
ischemia (Figure 4(c)). Neuroglial activation was assessed in

M/R groups treated with saline (M/R + sal) or FTY720 (M/R
+ FTY720) (Figures 4(d) and 4(e)). M/R-challenged mice
displayed microglial activation (Iba1-immunopositive cells,
Figure 4(d)) and astrogliosis (GFAP-immunopositive cells,
Figure 4(e)), which were both markedly decreased in M/R
+ FTY720 group compared with saline-treated M/R group
controls. These data demonstrate that FTY720 significantly
decreases brain damage in M/R-challenged mice that is
associated with reduced astrocyte and microglial activation,
supporting S1P receptor signaling in the brain as a pathological mediator of cerebral ischemia that can be altered to reduce
neuroinflammatory changes and brain damage produced by
M/R.
3.4. Brain Damage Is Augmented by S1P Microinjection. Neuroinflammation during initial cerebral ischemia is strongly
correlated with recurrent cerebral ischemia, in which more
severe brain damage occurs [7‚Äì10]. Based on findings that
S1P receptors are involved in neuroglial activation and M/Rinduced damage, S1P microinjection was used to activate
local neuroglia followed by M/R challenge followed by
assessments of brain damage. To determine the augmentation
clearly, mice were challenged by a shorter M/R (60 min of
occlusion and reperfusion) 24 hours after S1P microinjection.
S1P microinjection followed by M/R (S1P + M/R) significantly
increased damage compared to M/R after vehicle injection
(veh + M/R) (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). Cerebral infarct volume
in veh + M/R group was 18.40 ¬± 3.638% whereas the
S1P + M/R group was 29.57 ¬± 4.867% (Figure 5(b)). This
secondary, augmented brain damage produced by initial
S1P microinjection was reduced by FTY720 administration
prior to M/R challenge (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). Infarct
volume in the S1P + FTY + M/R group was 16.73 ¬± 2.493
(Figure 5(b)). These results were confirmed by assessments of
neurological deficit (Figure 5(c)) and neural cell death using
Fluoro-Jade B staining (Figure 5(d)). These data showed

that the increased brain damage in S1P + M/R group was
blocked by FTY720 administration and indicated that S1P
receptor signaling that activates neuroglia‚Äîastrocytes and
microglia‚Äîexacerbates M/R-induced brain damage, possibly
representing a model for increased damage observed in
recurrent cerebral ischemia.

The activation was then assessed in animals that had received

(Figure 6).

M/R damage, indicating that CNS S1P receptor signaling
potentiates damage produced by ischemic insult. To determine whether local neuroglial activation was also occurring in S1P-primed damage, activated microglia and astrocytes were examined using immunohistochemical markers
from animals challenged under various M/R conditions
as compared to sham controls. Immunohistochemically
observed microglial activation (Iba1-immunopositive cells,

3.6. S1P Microinjection Induces TNF-ùõº Expression. The priming of M/R damage by S1P microinjection into the brain
was suggestive of changes seen in recurrent stroke, raising
the question of whether markers for recurrent stroke might
be expressed in the S1P-primed model. Increased TNF-ùõº
expression is associated with a risk of recurrent stroke [13].
TNF-ùõº immunolabeling in the cortex identified significant
increases in the number of cells expressing TNF-ùõº after
S1P microinjection alone (S1P) or M/R alone (veh + M/R)

reduction in TNF-ùõº expression following FTY720 exposure
(FTY + S1P and S1P + FTY + M/R) (Figure 7). These data
indicate that S1P receptor-mediated changes can produce
pathological changes consistent with recurrent stroke, which
can be reduced by modulation of S1P signaling by FTY720
exposure.

4. Discussion
The present study has identified activation of S1P receptor signaling within the brain as a factor in transient focal cerebral
ischemic (M/R) brain damage, particularly involving activation of astrocytes and microglia. In particular, local brain
delivery of S1P‚Äîwhich is independent of M/R, produced
astrocyte, and microglial activation‚Äîwas found to potentiate
ischemic brain damage, supporting direct CNS activities of
S1P signaling in stroke. FTY720 reduced neuroglial activation
and ischemic brain damage and this neuroprotective effect
was associated with neuroinflammation [41, 42] wherein

neuroglia, such as astrocytes and microglia, are activated
by immune cells within the CNS. These data implicate
modulation of S1P receptors in forms of stroke, including
recurrent stroke, which can be therapeutically accessed by S1P
receptor modulation.
Receptor-mediated S1P signaling has previously been
suggested to play a role in cerebral ischemia based upon
protective effects of the S1P receptor modulator, FTY720.
In rodent models of cerebral ischemia, FTY720 reduced
ischemic brain damage [32‚Äì36], with consistent results
observed in a proof-of-concept clinical trial that reported
improved neurological endpoints with FTY720 (fingolimod)
treatment of brain hemorrhagic stroke patients [37]. The proposed mechanism of FTY720 efficacy in stroke models [36]
was similar to that initially proposed for multiple sclerosis
(MS) wherein a reduction of pathogenic lymphocytes entering the brain occurs, produced by S1P-dependent alterations
of lymphocyte trafficking [18]. This effect is consistent with
reported lymphocyte involvement in cerebral ischemia [35].
In addition, evidence for nonimmunological S1P signaling mechanisms occurring within the brain itself has

emerged as an explanation for FTY720 efficacy in MS [21,
26‚Äì30], which might also be relevant to stroke. Notably,
selective removal of the S1P receptor subtype S1P1 from
astrocytes was found to reduce astrogliosis, disease severity,
and FTY720 efficacy in EAE (experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis), an animal model of MS [26], despite the
maintenance of S1P1 in the immune system. Reductions in
astrogliosis observed here during FTY720 exposure support
the operation of a similar protective mechanism involving
astrocyte reductions in S1P1 signaling. These observations
support a direct effect of S1P receptor signaling on the
severity of damage produced during stroke, which may
involve nonimmunological mechanisms relevant to neuroprotection or repair. Consistent with this possibility, a
proof-of-concept clinical trial examining FTY720 effects on
hemorrhagic stroke patients reported not only short-term
effects that might be immunologically driven, but also longerterm neurological improvement (3 months after event) [37].

Future identification of specific S1P receptor subtypes beyond
S1P1 and the involved CNS cell types, such as microglia,
will assist in elucidating the precise mechanisms of FTY720
efficacy in cerebral ischemia models, which also appears
to be relevant to the recurrent stroke model accessed by
S1P pretreatment within the brain in view of both damage
potentiation by S1P and the increased presence of recurrent
stroke markers like TNF-ùõº.
Additional support for the importance of S1P signaling
mechanisms relevant to stroke may come from studies on
S1P itself and its biosynthetic enzymes, SPHK1 and SPHK2.
In cerebral ischemia, S1P levels are increased [31] and S1Pproducing enzymes may be upregulated in lesion sites [43,
44] even with a contrasting report for the latter [34]. In the
normal brain, SPHK2 is more abundantly expressed than
SPHK1 [45] and is thought to play a protective role [46].
SPHK2 upregulation in the ischemic or hypoxic brain has
been reported [43, 44] but requires further study in view of

a contrasting report that SPHK2 was not upregulated [34] and
our finding that SPHK1 rather than SPHK2 was upregulated
in the ischemic brain. Although this study suggests the
importance of SPHK1 in cerebral ischemia based on its
mRNA upregulation, a functional role of SPHK1 needs to
be clarified. In addition to upregulation of ligand-producing
enzyme, our data indicate altered mRNA expression levels
of S1P receptors, including S1P3 upregulation and S1P1
downregulation. It is of note that basal mRNA expression
of S1P1 is much higher than S1P3 both in normal and M/R
stroke conditions and that the reduced expression level of
S1P1 mRNA is still higher than the upregulated level of S1P3
in M/R. In fact, there is a report that S1P1 is downregulated
in the infarcted area 24 h following M/R challenge (2 h MCAo
followed by 24 h of reperfusion) in rats possibly through the
decreased cerebral blood flow along with ATP depletion in
the ipsilateral hemisphere (dead cell regions) [47]. Another
study reported the downregulation of S1P1 in the kidney
24 h after ischemia/reperfusion [48]. These two independent
reports are consistent with our observation that S1P1 is
downregulated by ischemic challenge. However, the exact
mechanism regarding the S1P1 downregulation following
M/R is still unclear and could be pursued as another study.
In addition, it is unclear why FTY720 that is supposed to
downregulate S1P1 has a protective effect in cerebral ischemia
where S1P1 is downregulated. Of note, S1P1 was also reported
to be downregulated at the gene level in rat spinal cords
of EAE [49] consistent with overactivation by increased
S1P levels, while EAE symptoms were reduced by genetic
deletion of S1P1 or its functional antagonism by FTY720,
consistent with a critical role for the receptor in MS-like
disease [26]. These independent results from studies of MS
are consistent with our data in M/R stroke models, which also
showed astrocyte activation, S1P1 downregulation, and the
protective effect of FTY720. However, it still remains unclear
that S1P receptors with altered expression levels in ischemic
brain actually function as pathogenetic factors, which may be
tempting to be pursued as a further study.
It is clear that S1P signaling is important for the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. This study suggests a possible
downregulation of S1P signaling by FTY720, but it is unclear
that FTY720 indeed reduces the signaling. It is presumed
that the functional antagonism of FTY720 on S1P1 may be
involved in this neuroprotection. In addition, a recent report
demonstrates that FTY720 also causes the downregulation
of S1P3 [50], as it does for S1P1 . In this study, S1P3 was
downregulated at mRNA level in the ischemic brain, so it may
be possible that FTY720-mediated functional antagonism
on S1P3 may contribute to neuroprotection. Therefore, it
would be tempting to find pathogenetic role of S1P1 or S1P3
in cerebral ischemia employing genetic or pharmacological
tools to study loss of function in the future.
Neuroinflammation that is featured by the activation of
neuroglia, such as microglia or astrocytes, in the brain is an
important event contributing to brain damage in both initial
and recurrent stroke [1, 3‚Äì10]. There are several reports on the
anti-inflammatory role of FTY720 in microglial cells [29, 51]
through as yet unidentified receptor subtype(s). In activated
microglia exposed to lipopolysaccharide, FTY720 reduced

Mediators of Inflammation
activation of inflammation-associated signaling molecules
[51] and production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as
IL-1ùõΩ, IL-6, and TNF-ùõº [29]. In activated astrocytes, FTY720
reduced TNF-ùõº-induced ceramide formation [52] even with
contrasting results that it did not affect IL-6 production in
normal or activated human fetal astrocytes [53]. In this study,
FTY720 also reduced neuroglial activation in the ischemic
brain. It still remains to elucidate the specific receptor subtypes involved in neuroglial activation. Neuroinflammation
is closely linked to blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption and,
moreover, S1P signaling has important roles in regulating
the BBB, possibly via 2 subtypes of S1P receptors (S1P1
and S1P2 ) [54]. It has been reported that S1P signaling
modulates BBB integrity, with contrasting roles depending
on receptor subtypes: activation of S1P1 is linked to enhanced
BBB integrity [55‚Äì57] while S1P2 is linked to increased BBB
permeability [58‚Äì60]. Moreover, FTY720 was reported to
have protective effects on BBB damage through the activation
of S1P1 [61]. Therefore, the neuroprotective effect of FTY720
observed in this study may be due to its function on the BBB
through S1P1 because BBB disruption is also pathogenic in
the ischemic brain. However, it is of note that S1P-stimulated
responses, including S1P microinjection-induced glial cell
activation and potentiated brain damage in the ischemic
brain, are attenuated by FTY720 exposure. These results
suggest that FTY720 might reduce S1P signaling rather than
enhance it, but the exact role of S1P receptors, especially S1P1 ,
in the ischemic brain still remains unclear.

5. Conclusions
Results from the study of both MS and stroke support S1P
receptor-mediated signaling as relevant to these diseases
through effects not only on neuroinflammation but also
through direct CNS effects involving neuroglial activity, with
particular relevance to recurrent stroke through the ability of
locally microinjected S1P to potentiate M/R stroke damage.
Our data are consistent with the primary effects on S1P1
and astrocytes; however the role of other S1P receptors
and involved cell types in cerebral ischemia awaits future
clarification. These data support the actions of S1P receptor
modulators for the treatment of stroke, in both the immune
system and within the CNS itself, which has therapeutic and
mechanistic relevance through targeting these components
by brain nonpenetrant versus penetrant compounds.
