Background and Purpose—We and others have shown that soluble amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy
(CAA) cause significant cerebrovascular dysfunction in mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) mice, and that these
deficits are greater in aged APP mice having CAA compared with young APP mice lacking CAA. Amyloid β-peptide in
young APP mice also increases infarction after focal cerebral ischemia, but the impact of CAA on ischemic brain injury
is unknown.
Methods—To determine this, we assessed cerebrovascular reactivity, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and extent of infarction
and neurological deficits after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in aged APP mice having extensive CAA versus
young APP mice lacking CAA (and aged-matched littermate controls).
Results—We found that aged APP mice have more severe cerebrovascular dysfunction that is CAA dependent, have greater
CBF compromise during and immediately after middle cerebral artery occlusion, and develop larger infarctions after
middle cerebral artery occlusion.
Conclusions—These data indicate CAA induces a more severe form of cerebrovascular dysfunction than amyloid β-peptide
alone, leading to intra- and postischemic CBF deficits that ultimately exacerbate cerebral infarction. Our results shed
mechanistic light on human studies identifying CAA as an independent risk factor for ischemic brain injury.   (Stroke.

lzheimer disease and vascular dementia are the 2 most
common forms of cognitive impairment in the elderly.
For decades, each was considered a distinct disorder; recent
results, however, show that they share many characteristics,
including risk factors, neuropathology, and hemodynamics.1 This has led to a new conception that Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia are at the extremes of a spectrum
of pathologies in which vascular and nonvascular factors
coexist to varying degrees,2 a shift in thinking that has led
to prioritization of investigating vascular contributors to
dementia by the American Heart Association and American
Stroke Association3 as well as by the National Institute on
Neurological Disorders and Stroke.4 In vascular dementia,
cerebrovascular dysfunction and ischemic brain injury drive
cognitive impairment5; multiple lines of evidence indicate
that these 2 factors also contribute to Alzheimer disease.2
One common link between these 3 entities, cerebrovascular

dysfunction, ischemic brain injury, and Alzheimer disease, is
cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).
CAA is characterized by cerebrovascular accumulation
of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in a fibrillar form. Common in
the elderly (≈30% in those >60 years),6 it is also almost universally found in patients with Alzheimer.7,8 Experimental
evidence in animals9–13 and humans14,15 shows that CAA
significantly perturbs cerebral arteriole function and cerebral blood flow (CBF). In human autopsy studies, CAA is a
strong and independent risk factor for both ischemic infarction16–18 and cognitive impairment.19,20 Taken together, these
results have led many to postulate that CAA contributes to
Alzheimer disease by compromising cerebral hemodynamics and promoting infarctions throughout the cerebral hemispheres.17,21 Yet, experimental evidence that CAA contributes
to ischemic infarction is currently lacking, as is underlying
mechanism.

Milner et al   CAA Increases Susceptibility to Infarction    3065
Previously, 2 groups showed that amyloid precursor protein
(APP) mice having elevated Aβ (but no CAA) develop larger
infarcts after focal cerebral ischemia compared with littermate
controls. One study implicated Aβ-induced cerebrovascular
function,22 whereas the other linked it to Aβ-induced inflammation.23 Neither examined the effect of CAA on cerebral
infarction, as both examined APP mice at ages where CAA is
not present. In the current study, we sought to determine the
effect of CAA on cerebral ischemia by examining pre-CAA
and post-CAA APP mice. We also examined whether CAAinduced alterations in cerebrovascular function and CBF
might underlie the observed effect.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

All experiments were approved by the Animal Studies Committee
at Washington University. All data were collected by experimenters
blinded to age and genotype. Tg2576 mice, originally a generous gift
from Dr K. Ashe (University of Minnesota, MN), were bred to B6/
SJL wild-type (WT) mice (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY) and
genotyped as described.9,24 Male Tg2576 mice were used at 6 months
(having elevated Aβ but no CAA) and at 15 months (having elevated
Aβ and extensive CAA); WT littermates served as controls.

Cerebrovascular Reactivity
Cerebrovascular reactivity was assessed as previously described.9
Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and a 4-mm right parietal cranial window was made. After 15 hours of recovery, mice
were reanesthetized and ventilated with a rodent ventilator (Harvard
Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Core body temperature was maintained at
37±0.1°C by a thermoregulated heating pad. Arterial blood pressure
and gases were assessed via femoral catheterization. Leptomeningeal
arterioles were visualized using Nikon Eclipse ME600 microscope
(Nikon Instruments Inc, Melville, NY) and MetaMorph Image
Analysis (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The endotheliumdependent vasodilator acetylcholine (100 μmol/L) and the endothelium-independent vasodilator S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine
(SNAP; 500 μmol/L) were infused, followed by artificial CSF until
baseline vessel diameter returned. Vessel diameters were quantified
via Diamtrak (Tim Neild, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia).

Transient Focal Cerebral Ischemia Model
Focal ischemia was performed as described.22 Briefly, after anesthesia
with isoflurane (4% induction, 1.5% maintenance), burr holes were
made to allow placement of laser Doppler flow probes. A 6-0 nylon
filament was advanced from the left external carotid through the internal carotid to the middle cerebral artery (MCA). After 45 minutes
of MCA occlusion (MCAO), the filament was removed to allow reperfusion. Temperature was maintained as above.

Measurement of CBF
CBF was monitored before, during, and after MCAO via laser
Doppler flow as described.22 Probes were placed through burr holes
over the ischemic core (3.5 mm lateral, 1 mm caudal to bregma) and
penumbra (1.5 mm lateral, 1.7 mm rostral to lambda). Data are presented as a percentage of the preocclusion value.

Infarct Volume Quantification
Infarction was assessed via 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)
staining 72 hours post MCAO as previously described.25 Briefly, mice
were transcardially perfused with heparinized PBS. Brains were sectioned coronally using a 1.5-mm matrix and stained in 2% TTC; after fixation in 10% formalin, imaging was performed with a desktop
scanner. Infarct area was assessed using ImageJ (National Institutes

of Health, Bethesda, MD) and used to calculate infarct volume via
the indirect method.

Neurobehavioral Tests
Neurobehavioral outcome was assessed daily using 8-point sensorimotor scoring as previously described.26

CAA and Neuritic Plaque Quantification
In animals undergoing cerebrovascular reactivity assessment, CAA
was quantified as previously described.9 Briefly, mice were administered the Congo red derivative methoxy-X04 (10 mg/kg IP) at installation of the cranial window. Percent CAA coverage was determined
for eight 25-μm segments per animal using MetaMorph. In a subset of
aged Tg2576 mice (n=4), CAA and neuritic plaque load were quantified postmortem as per our established protocol.27 Briefly, mice were
euthanized 72 hours post MCAO, followed by brain extraction, fixation (4% paraformaldehyde), equilibration (30% sucrose), and coronal sectioning (50 μm). Brain sections were stained with 1 μmol/L
resorufin (which selectively stains CAA) and 2 μmol/L methoxyX34 (which stains both CAA and neuritic plaques). Fluorescent
staining was visualized using Nikon Eclipse ME600 microscope and
MetaMorph. CAA and neuritic plaque load were assessed as percent
coverage of MCA-territory parietal cortex, contra- and ipsilateral to
MCAO, using ImageJ.

Statistical Analyses
Data are expressed as mean±SEM. After determination of normality, comparisons between 2 groups were performed with a Student
t test; among multiple groups, with a 1-way omnibus ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison method or with a omnibus
repeated measures ANOVA followed by Newman–Keuls method.
STATISTICA (StatSoft, Inc, Tulsa, OK) was used. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05.

Results
Aged Tg2576 Mice Develop Extensive CAA and
More Severe Cerebrovascular Dysfunction
Young Tg2576 mice had no CAA, whereas aged Tg2576 mice
had extensive CAA covering most leptomeningeal arterioles
without interruption (Figure 1A). In young mice, no significant
difference in baseline vessel diameter was noted. In aged mice,
baseline vessel diameter was significantly greater in Tg2576
mice (Figure 1C; P<0.05, Student t test), which is consistent
with our9,28 and others’10,29 past results. This difference is consistent with a hypocontractile vascular phenotype, likely the result
of CAA-induced smooth muscle cell dysfunction and death. In
young Tg2576 mice, responses to acetylcholine and SNAP were
not significantly different. In aged Tg2576 mice, responses to
acetylcholine and SNAP were severely impaired (Figure 1B;
P<0.05, omnibus ANOVA). These deficits were CAA dependent, as acetylcholine-induced dilation was normal in vessel
segments from aged WT controls, moderately reduced in vessel
segments from aged Tg2576 mice having mild CAA (<20%),
and absent in vessel segments from aged Tg2576 mice having
extensive CAA (>20%; Figure 1D; P<0.05, omnibus ANOVA).

Deficits During and Immediately After

(Figure 2A; P>0.05; omnibus repeated measures ANOVA). In
aged Tg2576 mice, no significant difference in core CBF was
noted during MCAO; however, 15 minutes post reperfusion it
was significantly lower (Figure 2B; P<0.05; omnibus repeated
measures ANOVA). Even greater deficits were noted in the

ischemic penumbra of aged Tg2576 mice: CBF was lower
both during and 15 minutes after MCAO (Figure 2B; P<0.05;
omnibus repeated measures ANOVA).

Aged Tg2576 Mice Have Increased Susceptibility to
Focal Cerebral Ischemia
Young Tg2576 mice had infarct volumes that were 46% larger
than littermate controls’ (Tg2576: 62±9 mm3 versus control: 42±7
mm3), whereas aged Tg2576 mice had infarct volumes that were
84% larger than littermate controls (Tg2576: 85±9 mm3 versus
control: 46±9 mm3; P<0.05; omnibus ANOVA). The difference in
infarct volumes was statistically significant in aged versus young
Tg2576 mice, but not in WT mice (Figure 3A and 3B).

controls, whereas a small but significant difference was noted
between aged Tg2576 and littermate controls (Figure 3D;
P<0.05; Student t test). After MCAO, deficits were greater in
Tg2576 mice (Figure 3C and 3D; P<0.05; omnibus repeated
measures ANOVA); however, no significant age-related difference was noted.

Focal Cerebral Ischemia Does Not Affect CAA or
Neuritic Plaque Load
In aged Tg2576 mice, no significant differences in CAA load
(0.50±0.16% versus 0.48±0.13%) or neuritic plaque load
(1.37±0.15% versus 1.24±0.09%; both P>0.05, Student t test)
were noted between ischemic and nonischemic motor cortex 3
days after MCAO (Figure 4).

Discussion
Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

The main findings of our study are (1) aged Tg2576 mice
develop more severe cerebrovascular dysfunction than young
Tg2576 mice, and that this is because of the presence of CAA;
(2) aged Tg2576 mice develop more severe CBF deficits than

Figure 4. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) has no effect
on cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and neuritic plaque load.
Fifteen-month-old Tg2576 (n=4) were euthanized 3 days after
MCAO and subjected to staining with the CAA-selective dye

young Tg2576 mice during and immediately after focal cerebral ischemia; and (3) infarct volumes (but not neurological
deficits) are exacerbated to a greater degree in aged versus
young Tg2576 mice. In combination, these findings implicate
CAA, via its deleterious effects on cerebrovascular function
and CBF, in the heightened susceptibility to cerebral infarction observed in aged Tg2576 mice. They also corroborate
numerous human studies identifying CAA as a strong and
independent risk factor for ischemic infarction16–18 and lend
mechanistic insight into the pathophysiological underpinnings.
Two previous studies have examined the susceptibility
of APP mice to ischemic brain injury. The first used 3- to
4-month-old Tg2576 mice, which have elevated Aβ but no
CAA or neuritic plaques. They found that young Tg2576 mice
have reduced CBF in the ischemic penumbra immediately
after MCAO and develop infarct volumes 32% larger than
littermate controls.22 The second used 8- and 20-month-old
APP751 transgenic mice, which also have elevated Aβ but
no CAA or neuritic plaques. They found that APP751 mice
develop infarct volumes 34% to 41% larger than littermate
controls.23 Both studies causally linked Aβ to the increased
infarct volume noted in APP mice, although the former implicated the deleterious effect of Aβ on cerebrovascular function
and the latter its impact on inflammation. Neither, however,
ruled out the potential effect of APP overexpression (as
opposed to Aβ) as the underlying cause, and neither examined the potential effect of CAA on ischemic brain injury. Our
study used 2 distinct ages of Tg2576 mice, 1 with elevated Aβ
alone and 1 where elevated Aβ is accompanied by extensive
CAA, to examine this potential CAA effect.
First, we confirmed what we9 and others10,11,30 have reported
that Tg2576 mice develop age-dependent cerebrovascular dysfunction, with the most severe deficits noted in aged Tg2576
mice having extensive CAA. We also found that the severity
of cerebrovascular impairment in aged Tg2576 mice depends
on the extent of CAA, consistent with our and others’ results
that CAA is toxic to vascular smooth muscle cells, causing
dysfunction and eventually death in a dose-dependent fashion,9,31 a process that contributes to the impairment of microvascular function. Second, we found that postischemia CBF
was modestly but significantly compromised in the ischemic
core of aged Tg2576 mice as compared with young Tg2576
mice and littermate controls. We also found that intraischemic and postischemic CBF were significantly reduced in the
ischemic penumbra of aged Tg2576 mice as compared with
young Tg2576 mice and littermate controls. These results are
consistent with previous studies in AD mice documenting
neurovascular uncoupling: astrocyte endfeet swell and retract
from CAA-laden vessels (but not from CAA-free vessels) in
ArcAβ mice,32 and greater disruption is seen after cerebral
ischemia in 3xTg mice than in age-matched WT controls.33
Third, we documented that CAA and neuritic plaque load in
aged Tg2576 mice were not acutely altered by MCAO. Taken
together, these data strongly indicate that CAA’s pathological
effect on cerebrovascular function produced worse CBF deficits during and immediately after MCAO, which likely relates
to the inability of nearby CAA-laden cerebral arterioles to
provide collateral CBF through autoregulatory vasodilation.

Next, we examined what effect CAA-induced cerebrovascular dysfunction has on infarct volume and neurological outcome after MCAO. Consistent with past reports,22,23 we found
that young Tg2576 mice develop larger infarct volumes and
worse neurological deficits compared with littermate controls.
In addition, we found that aged Tg2576 mice also develop
greater infarct volumes and more severe neurological deficits compared with controls, but found that infarct volumes
were significantly larger in aged versus young Tg2576 mice.
No age-dependent effect on sensorimotor scoring was noted,
likely because of baseline neurological deficits associated
with aged Tg2576 mice, a floor effect in the postischemic
deficits seen in this model, or both. Taken together, these data
strongly suggest that the heightened vulnerability to ischemic
brain injury observed in aged versus young Tg2576 mice is
the direct result of CAA and its deleterious effect on cerebrovascular function and CBF.
Our data have several important implications. First, they
provide the first experimental support for multiple observational human studies identifying a role for CAA in inducing
and exacerbating ischemic brain injury. Second, they provide an advanced experimental foundation for future studies
designed to examine the efficacy of a growing number of novel
CAA-directed therapeutics (eg, anti-Aβ immunotherapy,
β-secretase inhibitors). Specifically, study end points could
comprise not only CAA load and CAA-induced microhemorrhage but also cerebrovascular function, CBF, and ischemic
brain injury. Third, they provide an opportunity to examine
whether an entirely new therapeutic approach, targeting vessel
function (rather than CAA itself), may reduce the deleterious
effect of CAA on ischemic infarction.
Other interpretations of our results exist. One possibility
is that elevated Aβ (rather than CAA) underlies the heightened susceptibility to ischemic brain injury seen in aged versus young Tg2576 mice. This would be substantiated if Aβ
levels were higher in aged versus young Tg2576 mice; however, evidence using the most sophisticated techniques for
specifically measuring Aβ strongly argues against this. Initial
studies examining this issue noted greater levels of biochemically extractable Aβ with increasing age and greater amyloid
pathology in APP mice.34–36 The extraction technique used,
however, is confounded by its potential to liberate Aβ from
amyloid deposits with tissue homogenization, and therefore it
likely overestimates the true level of Aβ present in the extracellular space. To address this concern, several groups turned
to in vivo microdialysis of APP mice to directly assess Aβ
in the interstitial fluid. Using this assay, we and others show
that, in fact, absolute levels of Aβ decrease with age in several APP mouse models of Alzheimer disease and CAA.37–39
Similar decreases in Aβ are seen in CSF of aged APP mice,37,40
patients with Alzheimer,41 and patients with CAA.42 Based on
these results, it is therefore highly unlikely that differences
in extracellular Aβ in aged versus young APP mice account
for the observed heightened susceptibility to ischemic brain
injury.
Another possibility is that greater ischemic brain injury
is seen in aged Tg2576 mice because of increased neuronal vulnerability that is CAA independent. It could be that

overproduction of mutant human APP and exposure to elevated Aβ throughout the lives of Tg2576 mice render the
aging brain less capable of coping with ischemic injury, leading to increased infarction. The fact that extracellular levels
of Aβ are actually lower in aged versus young Tg2576 mice,
however, argues against this. Finally, the enhanced vulnerability to ischemia could also relate to the presence of neuritic
plaque pathology in aged Tg2576 mice. But our observation
that aged Tg2576 mice have significant intra- and postischemic CBF deficits that appear CAA induced argues strongly
that vascular, not parenchymal, pathology is the primary
underlying driver of the heightened susceptibility. To completely exclude this possibility, however, additional experiments would be required, likely using APPDutch mice that
exclusively develop CAA, albeit at an extremely advanced age
(22–25 months).43
In summary, our work corroborates past results that APP
mice having elevated Aβ (but no CAA) have increased vulnerability to ischemic brain injury. In addition, we are the first to
show that aged APP mice having extensive CAA and severe
CAA-induced cerebrovascular dysfunction develop marked
intra- and postischemic CBF deficits and greater infarct volumes after MCAO. These data strongly implicate CAA as a
key contributor to ischemic brain injury, which substantiates
the growing notion that CAA, and its attendant cerebrovascular and CBF deficits, is a key contributor to the ischemic
infarcts and cognitive dysfunction found in Alzheimer disease
and vascular dementia. Whether restoration of vasoreactivity
via CAA-directed or vessel function–directed therapeutics
ultimately improves CBF, reduces ischemic brain injury, and
enhances cognitive function will require further investigation.
