doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00001.2015.—Ischemia impairs blood supply to
the brain, and reperfusion is important to restore cerebral blood flow
(CBF) and rescue neurons from cell death. However, reperfusion can
induce CBF values exceeding the basal values before ischemia. This
hyperemic effect has been associated with a worse ischemic brain
damage, albeit the mechanisms that contribute to infarct expansion are
not clear. In this study, we investigated the influence of early postischemic hyperemia on brain damage and middle cerebral artery
(MCA) properties and the effect of treatment with the endogenous
antioxidant uric acid (UA). The MCA was occluded for 90 min
followed by 24 h reperfusion in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats.
Cortical CBF increases at reperfusion beyond 20% of basal values
were taken as indicative of hyperemia. UA (16 mg/kg) or vehicle
(Locke’s buffer) was administered intravenously 135 min after MCA
occlusion. Hyperemic compared with nonhyperemic rats showed
MCA wall thickening (sham: 22.4 ⫾ 0.8 ␮m; nonhyperemic: 23.1 ⫾

stress, and interleukin-18, and more severe brain damage. Thus MCA
remodeling after ischemia-reperfusion takes place under vascular
oxidative and inflammatory stress conditions linked to hyperemia. UA
administration attenuated MCA wall thickening, induced passive
lumen expansion, and reduced brain damage in hyperemic rats,
although it did not increase brain UA concentration. We conclude that
hyperemia at reperfusion following brain ischemia induces vascular
damage that can be attenuated by administration of the endogenous
antioxidant UA.

REPERFUSION AFTER BRAIN ISCHEMIA is important to restore the
blood supply to the brain tissue. Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is currently the only
approved treatment for ischemic stroke but carries some risks
such as hemorrhagic transformation (38). Reperfusion injury is
a complex phenomenon attributed to multiple damaging pro-

cesses, and it could be an important target in stroke therapy.
Following experimental brain ischemia, reperfusion can induce
cerebral blood flow (CBF) increases above basal levels (33, 34,
35), a process called reactive hyperemia. Reactive hyperemia is
not restricted to animals, since there is evidence that some
patients can develop hyperperfusion shortly after thrombolysis
with rtPA (16). Hyperemia at reperfusion was associated with
the worst brain injury in pioneer studies of experimental brain
ischemia (33). In a more recent study, rats that developed
cortical hyperemia immediately after reperfusion showed
larger cortical infarcts and worse neurological deficits than rats
not showing hyperemia (23). Therefore, it is suggested that
reactive hyperemia at early reperfusion could be a sign of
reperfusion injury and also a potential target for therapeutic
intervention.
During cerebral ischemia, and particularly at reperfusion, there
is a surge of oxidative stress in the brain (29). Certain antioxidants
have shown protective effects in preclinical studies of ischemiareperfusion (I/R), indicating a key role for oxidative stress in brain
injury after I/R (27). NO can react with superoxide anion (O2·⫺)
generated at reperfusion to form the potentially harmful molecule
peroxynitrite (ONOO⫺), leading to tissue damage (4). Hyperemic
rats show comparatively more brain protein nitrotyrosination that
may contribute to the worse outcome (23).
Uric acid (UA) is a powerful endogenous antioxidant that
has shown protective effects against ischemic brain damage
(1). Several studies provided evidence that exogenously administered UA is neuroprotective in animal models of transient
focal brain ischemia (18, 28, 39). The observed neuroprotective effects of UA have led to a multicentric Phase III clinical
trial (URICO-ICTUS) to analyze if UA administration increases the clinical benefits of rtPA (1, 5). However, the
mechanisms underlying UA-induced neuroprotection are still
not completely understood. To date, the mechanisms known to
be associated with UA actions following cerebral I/R involve
suppression of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and lipid peroxidation in the brain (39). Nevertheless, the
potential impact of UA effects on the cerebral vasculature after
stroke has not been investigated.
Large cerebral arteries, like the middle cerebral artery
(MCA), have a strong contribution to total cerebrovascular
resistance (10). CBF is tightly controlled by myogenic mechanisms to maintain cerebral perfusion (20). A decrease in MCA
myogenic response has been consistently reported after transient MCA occlusion and may contribute to the impaired brain

URIC ACID PROTECTS AGAINST HYPEREMIC VESSEL INJURY

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals. Seventy-seven adult male Sprague-Dawley rats obtained
from Harlan (Barcelona, Spain) were housed under a 12:12-h lightdark cycle, controlled environmental conditions of temperature and
humidity, and provided with access to food and water ad libitum. All
of the experiments were carried out under the Guidelines established
by the Spanish legislation (RD 1201/2005) and according to the Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, published by the United
States National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication 85-23, revised
1996). Experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and were carried out in compliance with the European legislation.
Experimental cerebral ischemia. The surgical procedure for induction of focal cerebral ischemia was previously described (23). Rats
were anesthetized with isoflurane (2.5–3%) vaporized in O2 and N2O
(30:70). Mean femoral arterial blood pressure was monitored, and
body temperature was maintained between 37.0 and 37.5°C during
surgery. Briefly, the common and external carotid arteries were
exposed, and the pterygopalatine artery was ligated. A filament (nylon
monofilament 4/0; Suturas Aragó, Barcelona, Spain) heat rounded at
the tip was introduced (21 mm) through the internal carotid artery
to the level where the MCA branches out, and a ligature was placed
on the internal carotid artery. The filament was cautiously removed to
allow reperfusion following 90 min of occlusion. Sham-operated
animals were also carried out by performing the full surgical procedure and by introducing the filament through the MCA for ⬍1 min. A
simple neurological test on a nine-point scale (0 ⫽ no deficit to 9 ⫽
highest handicap) was performed before killing the animals, as reported (23). At 24 h, rats were killed under deep isoflurane anesthesia,
and the brain was removed and placed in cold Krebs-Henseleit
solution (KHS) (14, 15). Evaluation of infarct volume was performed
with the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) technique, as described (23).

Measurement of CBF. Changes in cortical CBF were measured
with a laser-Doppler system (Perimed, Järfalla, Sweden), as reported
(23). CBF was continuously monitored for 30 min before ischemia,
during the ischemia period, and during the first hour after reperfusion.
Values of cortical CBF after reperfusion (during the first 15 min) that
recovered to their corresponding baseline values (before occlusion)
(ⱕ20%) were considered normoperfused (nonhyperemic), whereas
increases of cortical CBF above 20% of basal values were considered
hyperperfused and a sign of reactive hyperemia (23). Subarachnoid
hemorrhage (n ⫽ 5) or unsuccessful blood flow measurements because of technical surgical problems (n ⫽ 6) were used as criteria to
exclude animals from the study.
Treatment. One hundred and thirty-five minutes after the onset of
ischemia (i.e., after 45 min of reperfusion), rats were treated with
either UA (16 mg/kg) or vehicle (Locke’s buffer) intravenously
infused during 20 min. The dose used was previously shown to protect
against damage induced by transient focal ischemic brain injury (18,
28, 39).
Animals were randomly assigned to sham operation or ischemia.
Ischemic animals were divided into two groups depending on whether
they developed hyperemia at reperfusion. Finally, sham-operated,
nonhyperemic-ischemic, and hyperemic-ischemic groups received
either UA or vehicle as follows: sham-operated vehicle (sham ⫹
VEH, n ⫽ 13); ischemic nonhyperemic vehicle (I/NH ⫹ VEH, n ⫽
11); ischemic hyperemic vehicle (I/H ⫹ VEH, n ⫽ 12); shamoperated treated with UA (sham ⫹ UA, n ⫽ 5); ischemic nonhyperemic UA (I/NH ⫹ UA, n ⫽ 8); and ischemic hyperemic UA
(I/H ⫹ UA, n ⫽ 12).
Tissue preparation. The MCA from the right (ipsilateral to
ischemia) and left (contralateral to ischemia) hemisphere was
dissected under a surgical microscope and kept in cold KHS. The
proximal segment of the ipsilateral MCA was immediately used for
pressure myography and processed for nuclei distribution microscopic fluorescence studies (15). Distal ipsilateral MCA segments
were used for evaluation of O2·⫺ production, immunofluorescence,
and mRNA levels (14). Coronal brain sections for immunofluorescence studies were processed as described (23). Plasma (500 ␮l)
was collected intracardially just before rats were killed and was
kept at ⫺70°C until the day of nitrite level and multiple ELISA
studies. A separate group of rats was used for the analysis of UA
levels in plasma and brain by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Parallel artificial membrane permeation assay for blood-brain
barrier. To evaluate the predictive penetration of UA by passive
transport to the brain, parallel artificial membrane permeation assay
for blood-brain barrier (PAMPA-BBB) was used following the
method described by Di et al. (9). The in vitro permeability (Pe) of 14
commercial drugs through lipid extract of porcine brain membrane
together with the test compounds was determined (3 different experiments in triplicate). A lineal correlation between experimental and
reported (9) permeability of selected commercial drugs using the
PAMPA assay was evaluated (y ⫽ 1.566x ⫺ 1.089; R2 ⫽ 0.9303) to
validate the assay. From this equation and taking into account the
limits established by Di et al. (9) for BBB permeation, we established
the ranges of permeability as compounds of high BBB permeation
[central nervous system (CNS)⫹]: Pe (10⫺6 cm/s) ⬎5.175; compounds of low BBB permeation (CNS⫺): Pe (10⫺6 cm/s) ⬍2.043; and
compounds of uncertain BBB permeation (CNS⫹/⫺): 5.175 ⬎ Pe
(10⫺6 cm/s) ⬎ 2.043.
Determination of UA levels in plasma and brain. The concentration
of UA in plasma and brain tissue was evaluated by HPLC with
ultraviolet detection. Blood samples were obtained from vehicle- and
UA-treated animals at different time points (ranging from 10 min to
24 h) under isoflurane anesthesia. Animals were anesthetized and
perfused through the heart with saline to remove blood from brain
vessels. The brain was obtained 10 and 30 min after UA administration. The method used for UA extraction was adapted from a method

autoregulation (22). Structural alterations of cerebral arteries
may also participate in the development of brain injury (24).
Thus, these changes might affect regional CBF regulation and
lead to distal capillary destabilization and organ damage. For
instance, hypertension, which is a leading cause of stroke,
induces remodeling of cerebral arteries causing larger infarcts
(15, 24). Several lines of evidence suggest that transient MCA
occlusion in rats induces MCA wall thickening (7, 14, 15).
Increased oxidative stress seems to be involved in such arterial
remodeling since antioxidant treatment at reperfusion rescues
MCA from remodeling and reduces infarct volume (14). After
cerebral I/R, the inflammatory response is accompanied by an
increase in macrophage infiltration (32). In addition, recent
reports showed that perivascular macrophage-mediated inflammation could be involved in hypertensive cerebrovascular
remodeling (25, 26). Remarkably, the factors underlying MCA
remodeling after transient cerebral ischemia are not fully identified.
The present study aims to explore the mechanisms underlying why hyperemia at reperfusion is associated with a worse
brain injury after ischemic stroke and the potential beneficial
effects of UA antioxidant treatment. We provide the first
evidence that postischemic hyperemia is accompanied with a
profound vascular oxidative and inflammatory response that
contributes to the development of structural alterations in
cerebral arteries. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cerebrovascular remodeling is a target of UA treatment, unveiling a
potential new mechanism underlying the protective effects of
this compound.

URIC ACID PROTECTS AGAINST HYPEREMIC VESSEL INJURY

Analysis software (Molecular Devices) as reported (14). In brain,
a similar subcortical area from the ipsilateral hemisphere was
selected for each experimental condition (coinciding with the
infarcted area in ischemic groups), and the complete image field
fluorescence (750 ⫻ 750 ␮m) was analyzed. The results were
expressed as arbitrary units.
Nuclei distribution by confocal microscopy. Pressure (70 mmHg)fixed intact MCA was stained with the nuclear dye Hoechst 33342 (10
␮g/ml) for 30 min (15). After washing was completed, arteries were
mounted on slides with a well made of silicon spacers to avoid artery
deformation. They were visualized with a Leica TCS SP2 (Heidelberg, Germany) confocal system. Stacks of serial optical slices (0.5
␮m thick) were captured from the adventitia to the lumen of each
artery. The different MCA layers stained with Hoechst 33342 were
clearly distinguished with confocal microscopy according to the shape
and/or orientation of the cell nuclei (2). At least, two stacks of images
of several regions were captured in each arterial segment. MetaMorph
Image Analysis software (Molecular Devices) was used for quantification. The nuclei number was counted in the z-axis, as previously
described (15).
Multiple ELISA. Plasma samples were prepared for analysis in a
96-well plate using a custom 27-cytokine Milliplex MAP Rat Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel (RECYMAG65K27PMX;
Millipore) following the kit-specific protocols. Analytes were quantified using a Magpix analytical test instrument that uses xMAP
technology (Luminex, Austin, TX) and xPONENT 4.2 software (Luminex).
Quantitative real-time PCR. mRNA expression was quantified by
Syber green-based quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) as previously described (21). The expression of mRNA for GAPDH of
18S ribosomal RNA was used as an internal control. qRT-PCR
reactions were set following the manufacturer’s conditions. Ct
values obtained for each gene were referenced to GAPDH 18S
(⌬⌬Ct) and converted to the linear form using the term 2⫺⌬⌬Ct as
a value directly proportional to the copy number of cDNA and
initial quantity of mRNA (21).
Statistics. Results were expressed as means ⫾ SE of the number
(n) of rats indicated in the legends for Figs. 1–9. The difference
between nonhyperemic or hyperemic rats and the effect of UA
treatment were assessed by a two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s
posttest to compare groups. Data analysis was carried out using
GraphPad Prism version 4 software. A value of P ⬍ 0.05 was
considered significant.
RESULTS

Body weight, mean arterial blood pressure, and body temperature during surgery did not vary between groups (Table 1).
None of the rats died in either group before the end of the
study. The incidence of reactive hyperemia was 56%. The
reduction of CBF during ischemia was similar in all the groups,
and the extent of CBF increase at reperfusion in the hyperemic
groups that later received either UA or vehicle was not different (Table 2).
UA treatment is neuroprotective in animals showing reactive
hyperemia. Larger infarct volumes in cortical and subcortical
regions were observed in rats showing reactive hyperemia at
reperfusion compared with those that did not develop hyperemia (Fig. 1A). Single-dose administration of UA at 135
min after the onset of ischemia reduced (P ⬍ 0.05) infarct
volume in hyperemic, but not in nonhyperemic, rats (Fig.
1A). Likewise, the neurological score was worse (P ⬍
0.001) in hyperemic than in nonhyperemic animals (Fig.
1B). Treatment with UA ameliorated (P ⬍ 0.01) the neuro-

previously described (17). Briefly, plasma (100 ␮l) and brain tissue
(700 mg) were deproteinized with 10% TCA (20 ␮l plasma/150 ␮l
brain). Samples were sonicated for 20 s and centrifuged (5 min;
12,000 g). Afterwards, 10 ␮l supernatant were injected into the HPLC
system (PerkinElmer, Madrid, Spain) made of a 200 Pump, a 717 plus
Auto sampler, and a 2487 Dual ␭ absorbance detector. A reversephase ODS2 (4.6·200 mm, 5-␮m particle size; Waters, Barcelona,
Spain) was used. The mobile phase was methanol-5 mM ammonium
acetate-acetonitrile (1:96:3 vol/vol/vol), which was run with an isocratic regular low flow rate of 1.2 ml/min, and the wavelength
ultraviolet detector was set at 292 nm. Quantification was performed
by external calibration. The UA peak in plasma and brain was
confirmed by mass spectrometry.
Nitrite levels. NO production was determined by measuring the
plasma nitrite contents with the Griess reagent (11). The absorbance
at 540 nm was measured, and the nitrite concentration was determined
by using a calibration curve of standard sodium nitrite concentrations
vs. absorbance.
Pressure myography. The structural, mechanical, and myogenic
properties of the MCA were studied with a pressure myograph
(Danish Myo Tech model P100; J.P. Trading, Aarhus, Denmark),
as described previously (14, 15). In brief, the vessel was placed on
two glass microcannulas and secured with surgical nylon suture.
Intraluminal pressure was reduced to 3 mmHg, and a pressurediameter curve (3–120 mmHg) was obtained in gassed KHS
(37°C). Internal and external diameters (DiCa, DeCa) were measured for 3 min at each intraluminal pressure. The artery was then
set to 70 mmHg and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at 37°C in
gassed calcium-free KHS (0 Ca2⫹: omitting calcium and adding 10
mM EGTA). A second pressure-diameter curve was obtained in 0
Ca2⫹ KHS, and Di0Ca and De0Ca were measured. Structural, mechanical, and myogenic parameters were analyzed as previously
described (14, 15).
Measurement of O2·⫺ production. The oxidative fluorescent dye
dihydroethidium was used to evaluate production of MCA O2·⫺ in
situ, as described previously (14). The specificity of the signal for
O2·⫺ was evaluated by incubation with the O2·⫺ scavenger Mn(III)tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin (0.1434 mg/ml, 30 min,
37°C) (Sigma-Aldrich). Under the latter condition, no hydroethidine
(HE) fluorescence was observed in the tissue in any experimental
situation. Quantitative analysis of HE fluorescence was performed
with MetaMorph Image Analysis software (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA), as reported (14, 23).
Immunofluorescence. Frozen transverse sections (14 ␮m thick) of
MCA or coronal brain sections (50 ␮m thick) were incubated (1 h)
with a mouse monoclonal antibody against eNOS (1:100; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68,
1:75; AbD Serotec, Kidlington, Oxford, UK); a rabbit polyclonal
antibody against interleukin (IL)-18 (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA), nitrotyrosine (1:100; Merck Millipore, Billerica,
MA), iNOS (1:50; Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL), and nNOS
(1:100; Life Technologies, Alcobendas, Spain); a rabbit monoclonal
antibody against phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase
1/2 (pERK1/2, 1:100; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); or
a goat polyclonal antibody against vascular cell adhesion molecule-1
(VCAM-1; 1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After being washed,
sections were incubated (45 min) with the secondary antibodies
(1:200), a donkey anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-goat IgG conjugated
to Cyanine 3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove,
PA) or Alexa Fluor 568 (Life Technologies) at 37°C. Sections were
processed for immunofluorescence staining essentially as previously
described (14, 23). The specificity of the immunostaining was verified
by omission of the primary antibody and processed as above,
which abolished the fluorescence signal. Quantification of CD68positive cells (CD68⫹) was performed in a systematic manner, and
the count average per ring was calculated for each rat. Quantitative
analysis of fluorescence was performed with MetaMorph Image

(Fig. 3B) and the ␤-values of the stress-strain relationship were

the vessel stiffness was not significantly altered by I/R or
treatment.
Ischemia-induced MCA myogenic alterations are not related
to reactive hyperemia and are unaffected by UA treatment.
Lumen diameter in active conditions (2.5 mM Ca2⫹-KHS) was
significantly enlarged (P ⬍ 0.05) over the pressure range after
I/R, irrespective of the presence or absence of hyperemia, and
UA did not modify it (Fig. 3C). Internal diameter reductions in
active relative to passive (0 Ca2⫹-KHS) conditions reveal the
extent of the constrictor tone and reflect the myogenic response
as a function of pressure (Fig. 3D). Ischemia, regardless of
hyperemia, decreased (P ⬍ 0.05) the myogenic response, and
UA was not able to prevent this response (Fig. 3D). However,
analysis of slopes of the myogenic response-pressure curves
(myogenic reactivity) showed that this parameter was not
modified either by I/R (sham ⫹ VEH: 0.05 ⫾ 0.05, n ⫽ 13;
I/NH ⫹ VEH: ⫺0.01 ⫾ 0.03, n ⫽ 11; I/H ⫹ VEH: 0.05 ⫾

I/NH ⫹ UA: 0.01 ⫾ 0.05, n ⫽ 8; I/H ⫹ UA: 0.01 ⫾ 0.03,
n ⫽ 12).
UA suppresses the hyperemia-induced increase in both adventitial volume and AC proliferation. Nuclei distribution measurements by confocal microscopy from intact and pressurized
MCA are reported in Fig. 4A. The development of hyperemia
was associated with an enlargement of wall and adventitial
volume in relation to sham-operated rats, coupled with a higher
number of both ACs and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the
MCA wall with no changes in media volume. This effect was
not observed in ischemic rats that did not develop hyperemia.
UA treatment prevented the increased wall and adventitial
volume and the augmented number of ACs, but not SMCs, in
the hyperemic group. Cell proliferation in the MCA wall was
further supported by the increased expression of pERK1/2, a
key intracellular signal for stimuli-induced cell proliferation,
along the MCA wall of hyperemic rats, which was reduced by
UA treatment (Fig. 4B).
Increased cerebrovascular oxidative stress is reduced by UA
treatment. We evaluated HE fluorescence along the arterial
wall to assess for O2·⫺ production. HE fluorescence along the
ipsilateral MCA wall was increased (P ⬍ 0.05) in both non-

logical score in hyperemic rats without modifying it in
nonhyperemic rats (Fig. 1B).
MCA structural alterations are associated with reactive
hyperemia and are prevented by UA treatment. Arterial diameters were measured over the pressure range from 3 to 120
mmHg under fully relaxed conditions (0 Ca2⫹-KHS), and the
influence of hyperemia and in vivo UA treatment on the MCA
structural properties was studied. Twenty four hours following
I/R, the MCA from rats not manifesting reactive hyperemia
(nonhyperemic) did not display alterations in external and
lumen diameters compared with the MCA of sham-operated
rats (Fig. 2, A and B). Conversely, hyperemia was associated
with enlarged (P ⬍ 0.05) external diameters compared with
sham-operated rats (Fig. 2A). Administration of UA did not
significantly alter external diameters but caused a lumen diameter increase (P ⬍ 0.05) in hyperemic rats and a trend to
increase (P ⫽ 0.06) in nonhyperemic rats compared with the
sham group (Fig. 2, A and B). After I/R, the MCA wall of
nonhyperemic rats was not structurally different from that of
sham-operated rats (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, enlarged wall
thickness (Fig. 2C) and cross-sectional area (Fig. 2D), but not
wall/lumen (results not shown), were found in hyperemic rats
compared with the sham group. Of note, the vehicle (Locke’s
buffer) had no effect on MCA structure, since nontreated
hyperemic rats displayed the same remodeling observed in
hyperemic rats that received the vehicle (data not shown).
Notably, UA treatment prevented all hyperemia-induced MCA
structural alterations and did not affect MCA structure in sham
rats (Fig. 2, C and D).
Analysis of the passive mechanical properties showed that
hyperemia decreased wall stress (P ⬍ 0.05), and UA treatment
prevented this effect (Fig. 3A). The stress-strain relationship

hyperemic and hyperemic rats compared with sham-operated
rats (Fig. 5A). Conversely, the contralateral MCA did not
display elevated HE fluorescence after I/R (results not shown).
UA treatment slightly diminished the enhanced HE fluorescence in nonhyperemic rats and reduced (P ⬍ 0.001) it in
hyperemic rats (Fig. 5A). Quantitative analysis of mRNA
levels of NAD(P)H oxidase subunits (major source of vascular
O2·⫺) showed augmented (P ⬍ 0.05) gp91phox and p22phox
mRNA expression in hyperemic compared with sham-operated
rats, and this effect was attenuated (P ⬍ 0.05) by UA (Fig. 5A).
However, UA treatment increased p22phox mRNA levels in
nonhyperemic rats.
Hyperemia is associated with enhanced protein nitrotyrosination, and UA reduces this effect. The reaction of O2·⫺ and
NO can lead to ONOO⫺ formation, which can induce irreversible protein nitrotyrosination. Only the MCA from hyperemic

rats showed an increase (P ⬍ 0.05) in nitrotyrosine immunofluorescence vs. that of sham-operated rats, and this effect was
particularly prominent in the adventitia (Fig. 5B). Similarly,
only hyperemic rats showed increased (P ⬍ 0.01) nitrotyrosine
fluorescence in brain tissue (Fig. 6). UA treatment reduced
(P ⬍ 0.05) nitrotyrosine immunofluorescence in both the MCA
and the brain tissue of hyperemic rats (Figs. 5B and 6).
Expression of eNOS, iNOS, and nNOS in the MCA, as assessed by immunofluorescence, was unaltered by I/R compared
with sham operation (results not shown). However, plasma

Elevated levels of circulating IL-1␤ and IL-18 are a signature of hyperemia and are reduced by UA treatment. To
identify potential specific pathways responsible for vascular
remodeling in hyperemic animals, we first compared cytokine/
chemokine profiling in plasma of sham-operated and I/R rats at
24 h after reperfusion. Among 27 cytokines/chemokines, IL-1␤
(Fig. 7A) and IL-18 (Fig. 7B) were the only cytokines showing
a statistically significant increased concentration in hyperemic
compared with sham-operated rats, whereas they were unchanged in nonhyperemic rats. UA treatment normalized hyperemia-induced increases in both IL-1␤ and IL-18 circulating
levels.
Hyperemia is linked to increased monocyte/macrophage
recruitment irrespective of UA treatment. Although we did not
detect significant changes in VCAM-1 mRNA expression in
the MCA 24 h after I/R, VCAM-1 protein expression along
the MCA wall increased, predominantly in the adventitia,
regardless of hyperemia or UA treatment (Fig. 8A). CD68⫹
cells were detected in the endothelium and adventitia of the
MCA, although they were especially abundant in the latter
(Fig. 8B). Hyperemic rats showed an increased CD68⫹ cell
count in the MCA wall that was not modified by UA
treatment (Fig. 8B).

MCA IL-18 levels increase after hyperemia and are reduced
by UA treatment. Local IL-18 protein expression in the MCA
wall (Fig. 8B) was increased (P ⬍ 0.01) in hyperemic animals,
particularly in the endothelium and adventitia. This effect
was prevented by UA treatment (P ⬍ 0.05). Quantitative
analysis of IL-18 mRNA levels showed that hyperemia was
associated with an increase (P ⬍ 0.05) in IL-18 mRNA
expression in the MCA that again was reduced by UA. Of
note, IL-18 mRNA levels were diminished (P ⬍ 0.05) in
nonhyperemic animals compared with sham-operated animals, and increased (P ⬍ 0.05) after UA treatment. Neither
the endogenous neutralizer of IL-18, IL-18-binding protein,
nor IL-1␤ mRNA levels were significantly altered by hyperemia or UA (results not shown).
UA does not penetrate to the brain parenchyma. Table 3
shows permeability results from different commercial compounds and UA using the PAMPA-BBB assay. The assay
showed that problem compounds displayed similar experimental permeability values as those reported in the literature, and some of them manifested positive predictive penetration into the CNS. However, UA permeability was poor,
which suggests that it does not cross the BBB by passive
transport. Plasma and brain UA levels are shown in Fig. 9.

In either plasma (Fig. 9B) or brain (Fig. 9C), levels of
endogenous UA were similar in both sham and ischemic
rats. UA plasma levels increased 10 min after intravenous
UA administration and returned to baseline from 10 min
onwards (Fig. 9B). In contrast, UA levels in brain tissue
were unaffected by UA infusion (Fig. 9C).
DISCUSSION

UA is a potent endogenous antioxidant with encouraging
protective effects in ischemic stroke after exogenous administration (5, 18, 28, 39). To date, only one study reported
reduction in infarct volume and improved neurological scores
after UA treatment administered in a clinically relevant timeframe (180 min after MCA occlusion) (39). In previous studies,
development of hyperemia at reperfusion following an episode
of brain ischemia was associated with larger infarcts and worse
neurological deficits (23). In the present study, we also found
that hyperemic rats show larger infarctions and document that
UA, administered 135 min after MCA occlusion, decreases
infarct volume and improves the neurological score in rats
manifesting hyperemia. Therefore, the results of the current

study support that exogenously administered UA is effective in
the rats showing signs of reactive hyperemia at reperfusion and
further identify the cerebral vasculature as a target of UA
protection.
Several reports documented hypertrophy of the MCA after
transient MCA occlusion (7, 14, 15), and one study (7) suggested that structural alterations may take place after reperfusion. The results of the present study extend those observations
and demonstrate for the first time that only those animals that
showed hyperemia at early reperfusion displayed arterial wall
hypertrophy, which in turn was associated with larger infarct
volumes. Based on those observations, we suggest that MCA
wall thickening after I/R can be considered a sign of reperfusion injury. UA prevented the hypertrophic response in the
MCA induced by hyperemia, suggesting that protection of
cerebrovascular structure is a potential mechanism underlying
the beneficial effects of UA. Of note, we found that UA
displayed low predictive penetration in the CNS and endogenous brain levels of UA were not modified after UA intravenous infusion, suggesting that the target of this compound
could be the brain vasculature.

The reduction of CBF during ischemia was similar in all the
groups, indicating that hyperemia was not attributable to a
more severe CBF drop during ischemia, in agreement with a
previous study (23). However, we cannot exclude that hyperemia might be related to higher reductions of CBF in the core
of the infarction during ischemia, since our laser Doppler CBF
measurement was taken from a superficial cortical area. Previous studies have proposed that hyperemia is linked to an
increase in NO production (12, 13). In the present study we did
not find changes in MCA NOS protein expression among
groups. However, we cannot exclude an increase in MCA NOS
activity in hyperemic animals, since circulating nitrite levels
were higher in hyperemic rats, suggesting a surge of NO
production. In addition to producing relaxation, NO exerts its
protective action by scavenging O2·⫺. However, the product of
this reaction yields the highly reactive molecule ONOO⫺ that
generates protein oxidation and nitrotyrosination (4). The

marked protein nitrotyrosination along the MCA wall detected
in hyperemic rats extends our previous findings of exacerbated
brain protein nitrotyrosination in hyperemic animals (23) and
suggests that major nitrotyrosination of the MCA after I/R (8,
14, 19, 22) is associated with reactive hyperemia.
A decrease in the myogenic response is considered an
important factor involved in the functional dysregulation of
CBF after I/R (22). Previous studies reported a threshold of
MCA occlusion for myogenic responses in the rat MCA (6).
Consistently, here we show that myogenic alterations do not
depend on the degree of blood flow increase at early reperfusion, since both nonhyperemic and hyperemic rats displayed
similar myogenic response impairment compared with shamoperated rats. It has been proposed that one of the mechanisms
associated with loss of MCA myogenic response is the
ONOO⫺-induced nitrotyrosination and subsequent loss of filamentous actin (8, 19, 22). In our study, the myogenic response

was impaired in the MCA regardless of the status of protein
nitrotyrosination 24 h after I/R, and UA treatment reduced
protein nitrotyrosination without restoring the myogenic response in hyperemic rats. However, the myogenic tone of the
MCA might suffer a long-lasting or irreversible impairment
due to an early production of ONOO⫺ as already suggested
(14), which might not be restored by treatments administered
later than 2 h after the onset of ischemia. Accordingly, a recent
study demonstrated successful recovery of the myogenic response by ONOO⫺ scavenging at reperfusion after shorter
periods of ischemia (8).
Improving brain perfusion is essential to prevent neuronal
death after ischemic stroke. UA infusion was associated with a
passive lumen diameter expansion at 24 h. It has been described that nitrotyrosination of UA by ONOO⫺ can form a

product that can release NO (30). Even though circulating
nitrite levels at 24 h after reperfusion in UA-treated hyperemic
rats were low, we cannot exclude that a potential blood flow
increase due, at least in part, to a UA-derived nitration/nitrosation product during reperfusion might contribute to the flow
(shear stress)-induced outward remodeling (36). It is possible
that the UA-induced luminal expansion of the MCA prevents
the secondary hypoperfusion described to take place after
reactive hyperemia (34).
In response to stress stimuli, such as overdistension or
hypoxia, vascular adventitial cells (ACs) exhibit, among others, increases in adhesion proteins, secretion of chemokines
and cytokines, and cell proliferation (31). Our group previously
reported an increase in MCA AC number (AC hyperplasia) in
rats after I/R, contributing to explain the increased external

Fig. 8. Influence of uric acid treatment on inflammatory response induced by ischemia-reperfusion in rat middle cerebral arteries. Representative photomicrographs and quantification of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1; red) immunofluorescence (A) or IL-18 (red) and cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68;
green) double immunofluorescence (B) of confocal microscopic artery sections. Natural autofluorescence of elastin (green or gray) and nuclear staining (blue)
are shown. Representative examples of CD68-positive cells are indicated with arrows. Comparative analysis of mRNA levels of VCAM-1 (A) and IL-18 (B) are
also shown. mRNA levels are expressed as 2⫺⌬⌬Ct using 18S as the internal control. Results are means ⫾ SE from sham (vehicle: n ⫽ 4 –7; uric acid: n ⫽ 4 –5),

similar ischemia-induced increases in O2·⫺ formation, the
MCA from hyperemic rats showed increased NAD(P)H oxidase subunit mRNA levels and augmented protein nitrotyrosination compared with nonhyperemic rats, suggesting that hyperemia is associated with exacerbated oxidative stress. UA
antioxidant treatment diminished both oxidative stress and
ERK1/2 activation and reduced AC proliferation, indicating a
key role of oxidative stress in AC hyperplasia. ROS production
by adventitial fibroblasts can promote the recruitment of inflammatory cells (25, 31), which in turn generate more ROS,
magnifying the impact of oxidative stress (31). Hyperemia was
associated with an increased presence of monocytes/macrophages (CD68⫹ cells), mainly in the MCA adventitia, suggesting that increased adventitial oxidative stress in hyperemic
animals could be involved in adventitial monocyte/macrophage recruitment.
Cerebral I/R triggers an inflammatory response that contributes to exacerbate brain damage. Initiation of the inflammatory
response can involve the multiprotein complexes termed “in-

flammasomes” leading to release of proinflammatory cytokines
(37). We detected increased levels of circulating IL-1␤ and
IL-18 at 24 h in hyperemic compared with sham animals that
were normalized by UA treatment. IL-18 expression was
also increased in the MCA wall of hyperemic rats at 24 h,
and this effect was prevented by UA treatment. Therefore,
these results relate hyperemia with an oxidative stressdependent cerebrovascular IL-18 accumulation, pointing to
a role of IL-18 in early stage inflammation of the cerebral
vasculature.
In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that MCA
structural, but not myogenic, alterations observed after I/R are
restricted to rats that manifest reactive hyperemia at early
reperfusion. The underlying mechanism involves prominent
oxidative stress, increased macrophage recruitment, and IL-18
accumulation in the MCA of hyperemic rats. This altered
environment might favor AC proliferation contributing to
MCA remodeling. We also show that exogenously administered UA exerts a more potent brain protective action in

against I/R-induced brain injury. The current data support the
concept that UA exerts short-term vascular protection in young
male rats. It will be necessary to validate these findings in
female rats and in animals with comorbidities and to examine
whether the potential UA benefits are sustained in the long
term.
