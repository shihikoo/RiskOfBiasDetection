To determine whether reactive astrocytes stimulated by brain injury can transdifferentiate into functional new neurons, we
labeled these cells by injecting a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) targeted enhanced green fluorescence protein plasmid
(pGfa2-eGFP plasmid) into the striatum of adult rats immediately following a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) and performed immunolabeling with specific neuronal markers to trace the neural fates of eGFP-expressing (GFP1)
reactive astrocytes. The results showed that a portion of striatal GFP1 astrocytes could transdifferentiate into immature neurons at 1 week after MCAO and mature neurons at 2 weeks as determined by double staining GFP-expressing cells with bIIItubulin (GFP1-Tuj-11) and microtubule associated protein-2 (GFP1-MAP-21), respectively. GFP1 neurons further expressed
choline acetyltransferase, glutamic acid decarboxylase, dopamine receptor D2-like family proteins, and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit R2, indicating that astrocyte-derived neurons could develop into cholinergic or GABAergic neurons and
express dopamine and glutamate receptors on their membranes. Electron microscopy analysis indicated that GFP1 neurons
could form synapses with other neurons at 13 weeks after MCAO. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that action potentials and active postsynaptic currents could be recorded in the neuron-like GFP1 cells but not in the astrocyte-like GFP1 cells,
demonstrating that new GFP1 neurons possessed the capacity to fire action potentials and receive synaptic inputs. These
results demonstrated that striatal astrocyte-derived new neurons participate in the rebuilding of functional neural networks, a
fundamental basis for brain repair after injury. These results may lead to new therapeutic strategies for enhancing brain repair
after ischemic stroke.

troke activates endogenous neural repair in response to
neuronal damage caused by various signaling pathways
(Graham and Chen, 2001; Lipton, 1999) to avoid further
brain damage (Dirnagl et al., 2003). Theoretically, improving
this endogenous protective/repair capacity could be a valuable
therapeutic approach for stroke treatment. Ischemic stroke
induced neurogenesis (Arvidsson et al., 2002), an endogenous
form of neural repair, has shown that newly generated neurons migrate to the damaged brain region (Arvidsson et al.,

2002; Li et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2007; Yamashita et al.,
2006) and integrate into local (Hou et al., 2008) and distal
neural networks (Guo et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2012; Zhang
et al., 2013) in the non-neurogenic regions. These findings
indicate that newly generated neurons play important roles in
the morphological and functional reconstructive repair of the
brain after injury. The origin of new neurons in the striatum,
one of the most damaged non-neurogenic regions following
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), is still debated,
although at least a portion of neurons migrate from the

subventricular zone (SVZ), a major neurogenic region
(Arvidsson et al., 2002).
It has been demonstrated that GFAP-expressing astroglia
in the SVZ act as neural stem cells in adult mammalian brains
(Alvarez-Buylla et al., 2000). Mature astrocytes in nonneurogenic regions can be reactivated and proliferated in
response to cerebral ischemic stroke or traumatic injury, which
is characterized by the increased expression of GFAP (Liu
et al., 2002; Pekny and Nilsson, 2005) and re-expression of
nestin/vimentin (Buffo et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2002; Liu et al.,
2003), which is referred to as astrogliosis. In vitro and in vivo
studies have demonstrated the transdifferentiation potential of
astrocytes. For example, cultured astroglial cells from the early
postnatal cerebral cortex can be directed toward a neuronal lineage by overexpressing neurogenin-2 (Ngn2) or mammalian
achaete-scute homolog 1 (Mash1) (Berninger et al., 2007).
Interestingly, Dr. Zhangâ€™s laboratory found that a single transcription factor, Sox2, was sufficient to reprogram resident
astrocytes into proliferative neuroblasts in the intact brain of
adult mice (Niu et al., 2013). Additionally, Kronenberg et al.
reported that resident Pax6-expressing astrocytes developed a
neurogenic potential (Kronenberg et al., 2010). More interestingly, recent findings have indicated that cerebral middle artery
ischemic stroke causes striatal neurogenesis in endogenous
astrocytes, which could be upregulated by inhibition of notch1 signaling (Qin et al., 2014). However, it is still unknown
whether resident reactive astrocytes in non-neurogenic regions
of adult ischemically injured brains can transdifferentiate into
functional mature neurons, which is of fundamental clinical
importance for brain repair after damage.
In this study, we successfully labeled local reactive astrocytes by injecting pGfa2-eGFP plasmids driven by human
GFAP promoter into the ipsilateral striatum of adult rats
immediately following a transient MCAO. We combined
GFP-labeling with immunostaining for neuronal lineage
markers to determine whether ischemia could cause GFP1
reactive astrocytes to transdifferentiate into neurons. Electron
microscopy and electrophysiological recordings were used to
study the synaptic formation and functional synaptic transmission of astrocyte-derived neurons. We found that subsets
of striatal astrocytes were capable of transdifferentiating into
new mature neurons and functionally integrating into neuronal networks. These results provide important evidence that
striatal reactive astrocytes are a subpopulation of endogenous
neural precursors for post-stroke neurogenesis and thus play a
beneficial role in neuronal repair after injury.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (220â€“250 g) from the Shanghai Experimental Animal Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences were

September 2015

used for this study. This study was conducted in accordance with the
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the protocols were approved by the Medical
Experimental Animal Administrative Committee of Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University. All efforts were made to minimize
animal suffering and reduce the number of animals used.

Transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO)
Rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (360 mg/kg, i.p.).
Arterial blood samples obtained via a femoral catheter were collected
to measure the pO2, pCO2, and pH using an AVL 990 Blood Gas
Analyzer (AVL List GmbH, Graz, Austria). The rectal temperature was
maintained at 37 6 0.5 C via a temperature-regulated heating lamp
(Wang et al., 2007). Rats with physiological variables within normal
ranges were subjected to transient focal cerebral ischemia induced by a
left MCAO as described previously (Longa et al., 1989; Zhang et al.,
2006). In brief, a 4-0 nylon monofilament with a rounded tip was
introduced into the left external carotid artery lumen and gently
advanced into the internal carotid artery until slight resistance was felt.
The filament was left in place for 30 min and then withdrawn.

Administration of 5â€™-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)
To detect whether reactive astrocytes were dividing, rats were intraperitoneally injected with freshly prepared BrdU (50 mg/kg body
weight; Roche, Mannheim, Germany) 3 days after a MCAO and
sacrificed 2 h later.

Administration of pGfa2-eGFP Plasmids
The pGfa2-eGFP plasmid, which expressed the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter gene driven by a 2.2 kb human
GFAP promoter, was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Brenner
through the Alabama Neuroscience Blueprint Core (NIH grants
NS39055 and NS057098) (Nolte et al., 2001; Su et al., 2004).
Within 15 min of reperfusion after a MCAO, stereotaxic injection
of the plasmid was performed in deeply anesthetized rats placed in a
stereotaxic frame (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). A 3 lL volume of the
plasmid mixture (1 lL of 5 lg/lL plasmids, 1 lL of sterile saline,
and 1 lL of Lipofectamine 2000 at 1:1:1 volume/volume) was stereotaxically delivered into the ipsilateral striatum (coordinates from
the Bregma: AP, 1.0 mm; ML, 2.5 mm; DV, 24.0 mm dorsoventral). The injection rate was 0.2 lL/min, and the glass pipette was
left in the place for an additional 10 min before being withdrawn at
a rate of 1 mm/min. The animals were scarified at 3 days (n = 8), 1
week (n = 6), 2 weeks (n = 11), and 4 weeks (n = 7) following a
30-min MCAO for immunostaining analysis and at 13 to 16 weeks
for immunoelectron microscopy (n = 10) and electrophysiology
recordings (n = 7).

Brain Section Preparation
Rats were deeply anesthetized and quickly transcardially perfused
with 0.9% saline solution followed by 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate-buffer (pH 7.4). The brains were
removed, fixed for 6 h in 4% paraformaldehyde, and cryoprotected
in buffered 30% sucrose until they sank. A freezing microtome
(Jung Histocut, Model 820-II, Leica, Germany) was used to cut 30

1661

lm thick coronal sections at levels 1.60 mm to 24.8 mm from
Bregma. Sections were stored at 220 C in a cryoprotectant solution
for further histological analysis.

Fluorescence Immunolabeling and Confocal
Microscopy
For triple-labeling of BrdU-GFAP-nestin/Pax6, brain sections were
obtained from rats sacrificed 3 days after MCAO. The sections were
first incubated with a mouse anti-BrdU antibody (1:200, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) or rabbit polyclonal anti-BrdU antibody (1:200, Megabase, Brussels, Belgium) at 4 C overnight and then an anti-mouse/
rabbit IgG-rhodamine (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA) secondary antibody. Then, the sections were incubated in a rabbit
polyclonal anti-Pax6 (1:200, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or a mouse
monoclonal anti-nestin (1:1,000, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) antibody at 4 C overnight followed by an anti-rabbit/mouse IgG-Cy5
(1:200, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) secondary antibody. Finally, the sections were incubated in a goat polyclonal anti-GFAP (1:200, Abcam,
Cambridge, UK) antibody at 4 C overnight followed by an anti-goat
IgG-FITC (1:500, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) secondary antibody.
To trace the transdifferentiation process of GFP-expressing
astrocytes, the double-labeling of GFP and stage-specific neuronal
markers was performed as follows. First, brain sections at levels
1.20 mm to 0.2 mm from Bregma (based on the region of GFP
expression) were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-GFP
(1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or goat polyclonal anti-GFP (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) antibody at 4 C
overnight and then with anti-mouse IgG-FITC (1:50, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-goat IgG-FITC secondary
antibodies, respectively. The sections were then incubated in one of
following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-nestin
(1:1,000, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), mouse anti- bIIItubulin (Tuj1, 1:100, Chemicon, Temecula, CA), a rabbit antibody
against microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) (1:200, Millipore,
Billerica, MA), rabbit anti-NeuN (1:200, Millipore, Billerica, MA),
a rabbit polyclonal antibody against glutamic acid decarboxylase
(GAD67, 1:2,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA),
mouse monoclonal anti-choline acetyltransferase (ChAT, 1:200,
Chemicon, Temecula, CA), rabbit polyclonal anti-dopamine receptor
D2-like family (D2L, 1:200, Chemicon, Temecula, CA), or rabbit
polyclonal anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit R2 (NR2,
1:100, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) overnight at 4 C. The sections
were then labeled with an anti-mouse/rabbit IgG-rhodamine secondary antibody (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).
After washing, the sections were mounted on glass slides and coverslipped using fluorescence mounting media. Fluorescent signals were
detected using a confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS SP5,
Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) at excitation and emission wavelengths
of 535 and 565 nm (rhodamine), 488 and 525 nm (FITC), or 561
and 633 nm (Cy5), respectively.

Immunohistochemical Staining of GFP
To observe the morphology of GFP1 cells, 50 lm thick sections (the
same slices were used in immunoelectron microscope experiments)
were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (1:500, Santa Cruz

1662

Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 48 h at 4 C followed by 4 to 6 h
of blocking in 10% bovine serum. Then, the sections were incubated
with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Vector Laboratories Inc.,
Burlingame, CA) at 37 C for 4 to 6 h and an avidinâ€“biotinâ€“peroxidase complex (1:200, Vector) at 37 C for 4 to 6 h. Immunoreactivity
was visualized by 0.05% diaminobenzidine (DAB). Negative controls
received identical treatment, except for the omission of primary antibodies, and showed no specific staining.

Immunoelectron Microscopy
Rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in 0.1 M
phosphate-buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.25% glutaraldehyde after 13
to 16 weeks of reperfusion after a 30-min MCAO. The pGfa2-eGFP
plasmids were injected into the striatum after MCAO. Coronal sections were cut at 50-lm thickness using a vibratome and subjected to
GFP immunostaining as described above. Then, GFP1 cells were cut
under microscopic observation and embedded with Epon812 resin.
The embedded samples were cut at 70-nm thickness with an ultramicrotome (LKB2088). The GFP1 signals on the ultrasections were
visualized with lead acetate and uranyl staining, observed, and photographed with an electron microscope (JEM1200).

Electrophysiological Recording
Thirteen to 16 weeks after the surgical procedure, rats were anaesthetized with chloral hydrate (360 mg/kg, i.p.) and decapitated. The
brains were quickly removed and placed in an ice-cold oxygenated
slicing solution containing (in mM): 112.0 choline chloride, 2.5
KCl, 1.3 NaH2PO4, 26.0 NaHCO3, 0.5 CaCl2, 7.0 MgCl2, 25.0
dextrose, and 1.5 sodium ascorbate. Vibratome-cut slices (200â€“250
lm thick) were transferred into a slice storage chamber filled with
artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) composed of the following (in
mM): 124.0 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 26.0 NaHCO3, 2
CaCl2, 1.3 MgCl2, and 10 glucose. The slices were continuously
oxygenated with 95% O225% CO2 (pH 7.4) and maintained at 22
to 24 C for 1 h. Microelectrodes (3â€“4 MX) were filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM, pH7.25): 135 KCl, 2
MgSO4â€¢7H2O2, 0.1 CaCl2, 1.1 EGTA, 2 K2ATP 2, 0.1 Na3GTP,
and 10 HEPES. Lucifer yellow (1 mM) was included in the intracellular solution for visual identification of the recorded cells.
Cells showing neuronal morphology in the striatal slices were
selected for electrophysiological recordings. Whole-cell recordings
were performed at room temperature with an Axopatch 700B amplifier, digitized with a Digidata 1322A (Molecular Devices) and
acquired onto a PC using Clampex 9.0 software (Axon Instruments).
In all recordings, the series resistance (typically 15â€“30 MX) and
membrane capacitance were observed but not compensated. After
the formation of a gigaseal, the whole-cell mode was established
with gentle negative suction. The resting membrane potential and
membrane capacitance were measured immediately after rupture of
the patch membrane. The input resistance was calculated from the
steady-state voltage response evoked by a small hyperpolarizing DC
current pulse (22 mV, 50 ms) from a holding potential of 270
mV. The inverse of the inter-spike interval between the first two
spikes of the train was calculated as the firing rate. Action potentials
were recorded in the current clamp configuration from 2400 to

1150 pA with 50 pA steps and a 2 s duration per pulse. Spontaneous postsynaptic currents were recorded at a holding potential of
270 mV. Inward and outward currents were elicited in the voltage
clamp configuration from 270 mV to 150 mV at 20 mV steps
with a duration of 300 ms per pulse.
After recording, slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at
4 C overnight, followed by incubation with a mouse monoclonal
anti-GFP (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) primary antibody and then an anti-mouse IgG-rhodamine (1:50, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) secondary antibody. GFPnegative neurons were recorded as controls. Fluorescent signals were
detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy at excitation and
emission wavelengths of 535 and 565 nm (rhodamine) and 488 and
525 nm (Lucifer yellow), respectively.

Data Analysis
All data are expressed as the means 6 SEM and were analyzed using
unpaired Student t-tests for two-group comparisons and one-way
analysis of variance with a post hoc least significant difference and
Tukeyâ€™s test for multiple comparisons. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Cerebral Ischemia Induces Pax6 Expression in
Reactive Astrocytes After MCAO
As expected, cerebral ischemic injury could cause activation of
astrocytes in injured brain regions. We observed that reactive
astrocytes in the ischemic penumbra of the ipsilateral striatum
showed hypertrophic cell somata and processes along with high
levels of GFAP (GFAP1) expression 3 days after MCAO.
Reactive astrocytes also proliferated following injury as demonstrated by double-staining of GFAP and BrdU (GFAP1BrdU1). We found that these proliferating astrocytes also
expressed nestin (GFAP1-BrdU1-Nestin1) or Pax6 (GFAP1BrdU1-Pax61), a marker of neural stem/progenitor cells and a
transcription factor of neuronal fate determinant, respectively
(Fig. 1Aâ€“D). To determine the number of astrocytes that
expressed Pax6, we used immunohistochemical methods to
double-stain GFAP and Pax6 (GFAP1-Pax61) as shown in
Fig. 1E. We found that ischemic injury significantly increased
the number of GFAP1-Pax61 cells (Fig. 1F). These results
provide additional support for the idea that striatal reactive
astrocytes possess the potential to re-enter the cell division cycle
and transdifferentiate into neural stem/progenitor cells following ischemic injury. We next asked whether these resident
astrocytes could be transdifferentiated in vivo into mature and
functional neurons in the ischemically injured striatum.
pGfa2-eGFP Injection Traces Transdifferentiation
of Resident Reactive Astrocytes into Neural Stem/
Progenitor Cells
We injected pGfa2-eGFP plasmids that express eGFP (GFP)
driven by the human GFAP promoter into the striatum
September 2015

ipsilateral to a MCAO to label resident reactive astrocytes
based on the protocols (Fig. 2A,B). We also performed single
immunostaining of rat brain sections from different time
points after MCAO to further enhance the GFP signals and
scanned the fluorescent signals under a confocal laser microscope. As shown in Fig. 2C, 3 days after plasmid injection,
GFP positive (GFP1) signals were detected in the ipsilateral
striatum along the needle tract. We also observed that the
GFP1 signals spread 640.14 6 96 lm away from the injection site in brain sections at levels 1.20 mm to 0.2 mm from
Bregma. The GFP1 cells showed mostly glial-like cell morphology 3 days after the injection. More interestingly, some
GFP1 cells gradually showed neuron-like morphology in the
ischemically injured brain from 7 days after MCAO. The
GFP1 signals could still be detected even at 13 weeks,
although the density of the signals was reduced (Fig. 2C).
Double immunostaining showed that 86% of the GFP1 cells
(509 GFP1 cells) that bordered the ischemic core were costained with a GFAP (GFP1-GFAP1), and 47% were costained with nestin (GFP1-Nestin1) at 3 days postinjection
(Figs. 2D,E and 3A-b,I). We also found that some of the
GFP1 cells were co-stained with the stem cell markers Sox2
(GFP1-Sox21) and Pax6 (GFP1-Pax61), as shown in Fig.
2F,G. These results suggest that striatal injection of pGfa2eGFP can be used to trace the transdifferentiation of resident
reactive astrocytes into neural stem/progenitor cells.
Striatal Resident GFP1 Astrocytes Express Neural
Lineage Markers After MCAO
To determine whether striatal GFP1 astrocytes could become
new neurons, we performed triple staining of GFAP, NeuN
and GFP in brain sections at 3 days and 2 weeks after
MCAO. We found that, at 3 days, GFP was mostly expressed
in the astrocytes because GFP1 signals were only observed in
GFAP1 cells and not in NeuN1 cells (Fig. 2Hâ€“J). At 2
weeks after MCAO, some of GFP1 signals could still be
detected in the GFAP1 astrocytes. However, other signals
were detected in the NeuN1 neurons (Fig. 2Kâ€“M). Meanwhile, we observed that no cell showed triple staining of
GFAP, NeuN and GFP as shown in Fig. 2Hâ€“M. Therefore,
in the following study, we performed double-staining for
GFP and either nestin, Tuj1, MAP-2, or NeuN to trace the
neural fate of reactive astrocytes. Taking into account the
pGfa2-eGFP plasmids expression time and the timing of
astrogliosis and neurogenesis after brain injury (Jin et al.,
2001; Robel et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2007), we collected
brains sections at 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after MCAO as indicated in the experimental protocols (Fig. 2A). We found that
resident GFP1 cells in the ischemically injured striatum
showed time-dependent morphological changes along with
expression of proteins specific for neuronal lineage. At 3 days

shown by the white triple arrowheads. (B, D) Higher power fields with an orthogonal view of a confocal z-stack illustrate the triplelabeling of GFAP1-Nestin1-BrdU1 (B) or GFAP1-Pax61-BrdU1 (D) from A and C, respectively. (E, F) The change in the number of

after MCAO, we detected that 47% of GFP1 cells were costained with nestin, as mentioned above. Interestingly, starting
from 7 days after stroke, we found that some GFP1 cells
showed neuron-like morphology. Multiple immunostaining
results showed that 6-8.5% of GFP1 cells co-stained with
Tuj1 (GFP1-Tuj-11), an immature neuronal marker (Fig.
3C,D). Four weeks (28 days) after MCAO, GFP1-Tuj-11
cells could still be detected, but the number of these cells was
reduced (Fig. 3I). Meanwhile, we found that some GFP1
cells showed double-staining with NeuN (GFP1-NeuN1) or
MAP-2 (GFP1-MAP-21), markers of mature neurons, at 2
and 4 weeks after MCAO (Fig. 3Eâ€“H). Statistical analysis
indicated that 12 to 14% of GFP1 cells showed MAP-21.
These results indicated that striatal resident reactive astrocytes
1664

could transdifferentiate into mature neurons in vivo in
response to cerebral ischemic injury.
Astrocyte-Derived Neurons Morphologically
Integrate with Other Neurons
The next question we sought to answer was whether resident
astrocyte-derived neurons could differentiate into morphologically mature and functional neurons. Therefore, we collected
brain sections for detection of neurotransmitter synthetic
enzymes and receptors. At this time point, we found expression
of the ChAT, GAD67, D2L, and NR2 proteins in the GFP1
cells (Fig. 4Aâ€“D). These results suggest that GFP1 neurons can
develop into either cholinergic or GABAergic neurons, and their
membranes can express dopamine and glutamate receptors.

Then, we performed immunohistochemical staining
with sections from rats at 13 weeks after MCAO to reveal the
dendritic process of GFP1 cells (Fig. 4Eâ€“H). We observed
different GFP1 cell morphologies under microscopic observation (Fig. 4E). Some GFP1 cells retained an astroglial-like
morphology (Fig. 4F), but others showed very typical
neuron-like morphology with neural polarity, indicated by a
rounded large cell body with neurites and dendritic branches
(Fig. 4G,H). We also noticed that a few GFP1 cells had
small cell bodies without processes and did not look like
astroglial cells or neurons (Fig. 4Eâ€“G).
September 2015

We next used electron microscopy to analyze the ultrastructure of the transdifferentiated GFP1 cells. The ultrastructural images showed GFP1 neuronal cell bodies (Fig.
5D), GFP1 neural dendrites (Fig. 5A,B), and typical synaptic
structures (Fig. 5C,E). We also noticed both symmetric and
asymmetric GFP1 synapses, which connected with preexisting (Fig. 5E) and newly formed neurons (Fig. 5C). These
results indicated that newly generated neurons derived from
reactive astrocytes following ischemic injury could form new
synapses. The present results provided a morphological basis
for the re-establishment of neural networks. Thus we next

asked whether these GFP1 neurons were electrophysiologically functional.
Striatal Astrocyte-Derived New Neurons
Functionally Integrate into Local Neural Networks
We next assessed whether these newly generated neurons
could become functionally integrated into neural networks.
To test this, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings
from GFP1/2 neuron-like cells in freshly prepared striatal slices from rat brains between 13 and 16 weeks after MCAO.
1666

To confirm that the recorded neurons were newly generated,
we filled them with Lucifer yellow dye while recording and
performed immunostaining after recording to distinguish
GFP florescence from the Lucifer yellow dye. One hundred
and one cells were patched for electrophysiological recordings
in acute striatal slices. We classified the recorded cells as
GFP1 (n = 27) and GFP- neurons (n = 74) based on GFP
immunostaining. During the recording, we also found that
depolarizing current pulses could not elicit action potentials
(AP) in nine of the recorded GFP1 cells. Therefore, we further classified the GFP1 cells as AP1-GFP1 (n = 18) and
APâ€“GFP1 (n = 9) cells.
In the example shown in Fig. 6, cell-a (AP1-GFP1)
and cell-b (APâ€“GFP1) were newly generated cells as indicated
by double-labeling with Lucifer yellow and GFP (Fig. 6A,B),
whereas cell-c (GFP-) was a pre-existing neuron as it was only
labeled with Lucifer yellow (Fig. 6A). Figures 6Câ€“E and 6Fâ€“
H show representative electrophysiological activities corresponding to cell-a and cell-b in Fig. 6A,B, respectively. Under
voltage clamp at a holding potential of 270 mV, both cell-a
and cell-c exhibited active and sharp spontaneous postsynaptic
currents (sPSCs) with rapid onsets (less than 1 ms) and slow
exponential decays, indicating typical fast postsynaptic
responses to fast neurotransmitters (Fig. 6C). However, cell-b
showed constant spontaneous currents, and the amplitude of
the currents did not change significantly during the recording
(Fig. 6F). In the current clamp configuration, while stepping
from 2400 pA to 150 pA with 50 pA steps, we found that
suprathreshold depolarizing current pulses elicited repetitive
action potentials, whereas negative current pulses produced
hyperpolarized membrane potentials in both cell-a (Fig. 6D)
and cell-c (pre-existing neuron, data not shown). However,
neither the same current stimulation nor even higher depolarizing currents could induce action potentials in cell-b, which
only showed a steady linear currentâ€“voltage relationship (Fig.
6G). Membrane currents were recorded in the voltage clamp
configuration in 20 mV steps from 270 mV to 50 mV. We
recorded fast and large inward (24.213 nA) and outward
currents in cell-a (Fig. 6E). However, we could only record
very small and slow inward and outward currents in cell-b
(Fig. 6H). The electrophysiological parameters of the
recorded cells for the three cell groups showed lower input
resistances and higher membrane potentials for the cell-b type
neurons than for the cell-a and cell-c type neurons (summarized in Table 1).
After recording, we immunostained neurons with a secondary antibody conjugated with rhodamine to distinguish
GFP signals from the Lucifer yellow dye and observed the
fluorescent signals of GFP (Rhodamine, red color) and Lucifer yellow (green color) using a confocal microscope. We
observed that the cell-b type cells mostly showed many highly

Additionally, our evidence further suggests that a portion of
these reactive astrocytes transform into neural stem-like cells
with multipotent and proliferative characteristics because

Discussion
This study provides the first evidence that striatal resident
reactive astrocytes can transdifferentiate into functional
mature neurons in adult mammalian brains in vivo in
response to ischemic injury. These astrocyte-derived new neurons form GABAergic and cholinergic neurons, express glutamate and dopamine receptors, form neural polarity, and
make synapsesâ€”the morphological basis for receiving synaptic inputs from surrounding neurons. Electrophysiological
recordings combined with histological confirmation in acute
brain slices indicate that these striatal resident astrocytederived neurons can also fire action potentials and display
spontaneous postsynaptic currents. Thus, these new neurons
can form synapses with pre-existing neurons and functionally
integrate into local neural networks. The results of this study
expand our knowledge of how reactive astrocytes play important roles in brain repair in the adult mammalian brain in
response to ischemic injury. They also help us to understand
the cellular mechanisms of adult neurogenesis.
Consistent with previous results (Liu et al., 2002; Pekny
and Nilsson, 2005), the present study indicates that astrocytes

some GFAP1-BrdU1 cells were co-labeled for nestin, a
marker of neural stem/progenitor cells (Fig. 1A,B). Pax6, a
transcription factor of neuronal fate determinant (Hack et al.,
2005; Heins et al., 2002; Jang and Goldman, 2011; Kronenberg et al., 2010), is expressed in radial glia on the ventricular
surface (Englund et al., 2005)and astroglial cells in the adult
1668

SVZ, which is a neurogenic region (Jang and Goldman,
2011), as well as in immature or mature astrocytes (Sakurai
and Osumi, 2008). Exogenous overexpression of Pax6 in the
glial cells evokes transdifferentiation of astrocytes into neuroblasts (Kronenberg et al., 2010). We found that endogenous
Pax6, which is highly expressed in striatal reactive astrocytes,
could be significantly enhanced by ischemic injury (Fig.
1E,F). Taken together, our data further suggest that these
endogenous reactive astrocytes possess the potential to transdifferentiate into neuroprogenitors. When we microinjected
GFAP promoter-controlled eGFP (pGfa2-eGFP plasmids)
into the striatum ipsilateral to a MCAO and traced the neural
fate of reactive astrocytes in response to ischemic stroke, we
found that the GFP1 astrocytes could further transdifferentiate into neurons after stroke as indicated by double GFP1Tuj-11, GFP1-NeuN1, and GFP1-MAP-21 stained cells
(Fig. 3Câ€“H). The present results clearly demonstrate that
striatal endogenous reactive astrocytes can transdifferentiate
into new neurons in response to ischemic injury, which is
consistent with recent findings (Magnusson et al., 2014).
For these newly generated neurons to participate in
brain repair after injury, they have to be functional. In the
present study, we found several pieces of evidence supporting
the idea that astrocyte-derived neurons could also become
functional neurons. First, astrocyte-derived neurons expressed
neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzymes, such as choline acetyltransferase and glutamic acid decarboxylase, as indicated by
the GFP1-GAD671 and GFP1-ChAT1 cells in Fig. 4A,B.
This result suggested that these astrocyte-derived neurons
could become regionally appropriate GABAergic and cholinergic neurons. Second, astrocyte-derived neurons expressed
the D2L dopamine receptor and the NR2 glutamate receptor
on their membranes (Fig. 4C,D), which provides the ability
to receive presynaptic inputs. Third, single immunostaining
and electron microscopy analysis indicated that GFP1 neurons developed neurites with several branches (Fig. 4Eâ€“H)
and formed dendrites and synapses (Fig. 5). Fourth,
astrocyte-derived neurons showed electrophysiological characteristics of mature neurons as indicated in Table 1 and Fig. 6,
cell-a. For example, GFP1 neuron-like cells (cell-a in Fig.
6A,Câ€“E) could fire action potentials under current clamp
conditions and had active spontaneous postsynaptic currents
at a holding potential of 270 mV, indicating that cell-a type
cells are functional neurons that possess the ability to fire
action potentials and response to synaptic inputs. However,
GFP1 astrocyte-like cells (cell-b in Fig. 6B,Fâ€“H) showed relatively passive spontaneous postsynaptic currents and could
not be elicited to fire action potentials; these properties are
similar to the typical electrophysiological activity detected in
cultured mature astrocytes, as previously reported (Berninger
et al., 2007). Collectively, the findings of the present study

Experiments on GFP cells (n = 27) were conducted 13 weeks after MCAO. The pre-existing cells (GFP , n = 74) were analyzed as a control group. Input resistance was calculated by measuring the steady-state passive current evoked with a hyperpolarizing pulse with an amplitude of 2 mV and a duration of 5 ms from a holding potential of 270 mV in the voltage clamp mode. The spike threshold was measured
as the voltage difference between the resting membrane potential and spike onset. The spike frequency was calculated as the inverse of the
inter-spike interval between the first two spikes of the train in response to a 150 pA depolarizing current step during recording. The data are
reported as the means 6 SEM.

reveal that resident astrocyte-derived neurons in the ischemically injured striatum can develop into morphological and
functional mature neurons and further participate in the
reconstruction of regional neural networks.
We noted several contradictory results, including that
endogenous astrocytes themselves have no capability to differentiate into neurons in the non-neurogenic regions of adult
brains, even in cells have become neuroblasts (Buffo et al.,
2008; Niu et al., 2013). This contrasting phenomenon might
be caused by several factors. (1). Different experimental models or brain regions might have specific intrinsic mechanisms
that control the transdifferentiation of astrocytes. We used the
same cerebral ischemic injury model and examined identical
brain regions to those reported by Magnusson et al. (2014),
which were different from the experimental protocols
reported by Buffo, who traced fate mapping of astrocytes
using viral injection of glutamate aspartate transporter
(GLAST) promoter-targeted b-galactosidase (b-gal) into cortical regions in a stab wound model (Buffo et al., 2008). (2).
Cerebral injury could stimulate the activation of endogenous
neurogenic transcription factors in the brain to direct reactive
astrocytes to transdifferentiate into neurons, which does not
occur in intact adult brains. For example, we found that
ischemic injury could induce astrocytes to increase expression
of Pax6, a neural transcription factor (Fig. 1). Moreover, inhibition of notch-1 signaling could further increase the capability of neural transdifferentiation of astrocytes in ischemically
injured brains (Magnusson et al., 2014). In contrast, striatal
September 2015

astrocytes in intact adult brains normally do not undergo
neural transdifferentiation. However, neural transdifferentiation from astrocytes could be observed in brains after exogenous overexpression of neural transcription factors
(Kronenberg et al., 2010; Niu et al., 2013). The results suggest that ischemically injured, but not intact, brains can activate endogenous mechanisms to redirect astrocyte
transdifferentiation into neurons.
Nevertheless, we also noticed that only approximately
12 to 14% of reactive astrocytes could become new mature
neurons (Fig. 3), which was constant with the previous
reports (Kronenberg et al., 2010; Magnusson et al., 2014;
Niu et al., 2013). Most cells underwent astrogliosis. Based
on present knowledge, the function of astroglial cells in the
damaged brain is very complex and includes beneficial and
detrimental effects on brain repair (Buffo et al., 2010).
Astrocytes synthesize and release several growth factors to
enhance neurogenesis (Bath et al., 2012; Matsuoka et al.,
2003; Wang et al., 2007, 2009). However, they also express
several inhibitory factors that block or reduce adult neurogenesis and accelerate the formation of glial scars in the
injured brain (Boda and Buffo, 2010). Therefore, it is a reasonable goal to determine a method to enhance brain repair
by increasing the capacity of astrocytes to be transdifferentiated into new neurons. In the future, exogenous protein
manipulation could improve the neurogenesis capacity of
reactive astrocytes, which could in turn greatly benefit brain
repair after stroke.
