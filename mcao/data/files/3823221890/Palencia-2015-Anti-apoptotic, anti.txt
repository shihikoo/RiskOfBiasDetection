Thalidomide has shown protective effects in different models of ischemia/reperfusion damage. To elucidate the
mechanisms of such protection, this study assessed the effects of thalidomide on the oxidative stress and inﬂammatory response induced by ischemia/reperfusion episodes in rats. Rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 hours. All animals were sacriﬁced after different reperfusion times. Rats were administered
either DMSO or thalidomide (20 mg/kg (i.p.)) at different times before or during reperfusion: 1) 1 h before reperfusion; the infarct area was measured 2 h after reperfusion. 2) 10 min before reperfusion and 80 min after reperfusion; the infarct area was measured 24 h after reperfusion; and 3) 10 min before reperfusion and 1 h, 24 h, 48 h,
and 68 h after reperfusion; the infarct area was measured 72 h after reperfusion. Thalidomide reduced the infarct
area 24 h and 72 h after MCAO, and decreased the neurological deﬁcit in all groups with respect to controls. Thalidomide also lowered signiﬁcantly the number of TUNEL-positive cells, levels of Bax, caspase-3, lipoperoxidation,
and pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, and increased the levels of SOD1, Bcl-2 and pAkt. These results show that thalidomide has neuroprotective effects, apparently due to its anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidant, and anti-inﬂammatory
effects.

1. Introduction
Thalidomide (TM) was originally developed as a sedative but it was
withdrawn from market after its teratogenic effects [34]. In spite of its
teratogenicity, further research showed that thalidomide possesses
immune-modulatory, anti-inﬂammatory, and anti-angiogenic properties that are potentially useful in several diseases [16,50]. This clinical
efﬁcacy is based on its ability of inhibiting the transcription of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) [60] and IL-6 [61]. TM lowered the expression of
TNF, thus reducing the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) damage in a spinal injury model [28]. Also, TM reduced the expression levels of TNF-α and
VEGF, such as edema, in a retinal I/R model [57]. Additionally, TM
protected from intestinal I/R damage by decreasing TNF production
and lipid peroxidation [2]. Furthermore, TM reduced the production of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cerebral ischemia, thus reducing neuronal damage [18].
The mechanisms underlying ischemic cerebral damage are
complex, some studies suggesting the participation of ROS and neuroinﬂammation mediators. ROS may cause damage after the

stroke by inducing peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in
plasma membranes, enzyme oxidation, protein carbonylation and
polymerization, polysaccharide depolymerization, and purine and
pyrimidine hydroxylation, causing a deregulation of signaling mechanisms and gene expression. While ROS production and lipid peroxidation are induced in cerebral ischemia, the overexpression of
antioxidant enzymes provides protection against cerebral ischemia
[8]. The critical role of neuroinﬂammation in ischemic brain injury
has been demonstrated as well. TNF and interleukin-1β (IL-1 β)
transcripts have been found up-regulated within a few hours after ischemia [17]. Furthermore, the transcription and translation of IL-1β
and TNF are induced both in the core of the event and in the ischemic
penumbra following cerebral I/R [62,58]. In addition, IL-1β and TNF
have been reported as inducing VEGF gene activation [39]. VEGF,
also known as vascular permeability factor, is increased in the ischemic brain, and this suggests that VEGF could partake in the response
to ischemic damage. VEGF expression in endothelial cells, astrocytes,
and neurons is induced in a period of time ranging from hours to days
in the ischemic zone [5,15,29].
This study is aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efﬁcacy of TM on
focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats. The size of the infarct
zone and the neurological deﬁcit were measured in TM-treated rats and
compared with non-treated controls. In addition, the possible action

mechanisms of TM were explored by assessing its anti-oxidant, antiinﬂammatory, and anti-apoptotic functions.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Male Wistar rats were kept and handled in accordance to the NIH
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals according to NOM062-ZOO-2001. All experiments were reviewed and approved (Protocol
Number: 28/12) by the Research and Experimental Animal Care
Committees off the Instituto Nacional de Neurología y Neurocirugía de
México. Animals were allowed standard commercial rat chow and
water ad libitum, and were maintained in a 12 h light–dark cycle at a
constant temperature.

respectively has been reported that 20 mg/kg of TM, administered
intraperitoneally induce a neuroprotective effect [18].
2.3. Behavioral testing
Neurological deﬁcit was determined by measuring spontaneous motility, forelimb ﬂexion, grasping reﬂex, horizontal bar test, and contralateral turning. Neurological ﬁndings were scored on a 0-4 scale: zero, no
neurological deﬁcit (normal test results); 1, mild neurological deﬁcit
(failure to lift the forepaw completely); 2, moderate neurological deﬁcit
(left circling); 3, severe neurological deﬁcit (falling to the left side); and
4, very severe neurological deﬁcit (failure to walk, depressed consciousness). The sum of the scores on individual tests was used to measure the
degree of the neurological deﬁcit [30]. Evaluations were performed
30 min before rats were killed.
2.4. Measuring infarct area

2.2. Experimental design
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by occluding the middle cerebral artery (MCAO), as reported by [30]. After animals were anesthetized with halothane, which was administered with 2.5-3% of oxygen
in a precision vaporizer (Ohmeda Fluotec-3), a nylon ﬁlament (40 mm
total length and 0.24 mm diameter) was inserted in the lumen of the
external and the internal carotid artery. Two hours later, the ﬁlament
was removed to commence reperfusion. Animals were distributed
into groups, which were intraperitoneally administered either with
dimethysulfoxide (0.726 g /kg DMSO) or TM (20 mg/kg) as follows:
1) 1 h before reperfusion; the infarct area was measured 2 h after reperfusion. 2) 1 h and 10 min before reperfusion and 1 and 20 h after reperfusion; the infarct area was measured 24 h after reperfusion. 3) 1 h and
10 min before reperfusion and 1 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 68 h after reperfusion;
the infarct area was measured 72 h after reperfusion (Fig. 1). In a sham
group, the external carotid artery was dissected, but the ﬁlament was
not introduced. The samples were collected for biochemical and molecular evaluations after 2 h of ischemia, 24 and 72 h after MCAO,

To determine the infarct area, the rats were euthanized employing
sodium pentobarbital. The size of the infarct area was determined in
2-mm brain slices, incubated in 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) [25]. When mitochondrial activity is normal, TCC is reduced
(feasible areas are shown in red); in contrast, TCC is oxidized when
mitochondrial activity is decreased (infarct areas are white). The size
of infarct areas was measured by using the Image J software and it
was calculated as reported by [14]. Results are expressed as percent of
infarction area.
2.5. TUNEL staining
Cell death rate was determined by ﬂuorescence with the In Situ Cell
Death Detection Kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Slices were incubated
with the enzyme terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TdT) at
37 °C for 1 h, and subsequently washed with PBS. A Zeiss LSM 510
inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany) was used to observe apoptotic cells.

2.6. TNF, IL-1β, and VEGF immunoassays

3. Results

The infarct area was homogenized in PBS with protease inhibitors
(Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO, USA) and centrifuged. Supernatants
were preserved at − 80 °C until used. TNF, IL-1β, and VEGF levels
were measured by ELISA according to the manufacturer directions
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis. MN, USA).

3.1. Effect of thalidomide treatment on infarction

2.7. Lipid hydroperoxide assay
Lipid hydroperoxide (LPO) levels were determined in the infarct
area with the LPO assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA)
as a measure of lipoperoxidation. Results are given as μM of lipid hydroperoxide per milligram of protein.

Lesions caused by 2-h ischemia (2I), 2-h ischemia and 24-h reperfusion (2I/24R), and 2-h ischemia and 72-h reperfusion (2I/72R) showed
an infarct area of 7.5 ± 3 mm2, 23 ± 3 mm2, and 25 ± 3 mm2. These
values were not signiﬁcantly different with respect to DMSO-treated
controls (2I, 2I/24R, and 2I/72R groups). No infarction was observed in
sham animals (data not shown). TM administration (20 mg/kg) 1 h
before reperfusion (2I TM group) caused a decrease in the size of infarct
area with respect to the untreated control group (2I group). Moreover,
TM administration 10 min before reperfusion and 1 and 20 h after
reperfusion (2I/24R TM group), as well as 10 min before reperfusion
and 1 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 68 h after reperfusion (2I/72R TM group) caused
a signiﬁcant decrease in the size of infarct areas with respect to the
control group (Fig. 2).

2.8. Western blot assay
Proteins from infracted areas were resolved in SDS-PAGE and then
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked
with 3% skim milk in PBS IX and incubated with the respective primary
antibody (Akt, pAkt, SOD1, SOD 2, catalase, Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3 and
β-actin) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for 24 h at
4 °C. Then, membranes were incubated with the respective horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA USA) and measured with the ECL kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA USA).

2.9. Statistical analysis
Data are given as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.). Comparisons
between experimental and control groups were performed by oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey test. Differences
were considered signiﬁcant when p b 0.05.

3.2. Effect of thalidomide treatment on neurological impairment
No animal in the sham groups showed signs of neurological deﬁcit.
However, neurological deﬁcit scores of 4 ± 0.5, 3.5 ± 0.6, and 3.2 ±
0.4 were observed in the groups 2I, 2I/24R, and 2I/72R. In contrast, TM
administration decreased signiﬁcantly the neurological deﬁcit scores
in all treated groups (2I TM, 2I/24R TM, and 2I/72R TM groups)
(Table 1). The observed improvement in the neurological outcome
suggests that TM treatment prevented brain damage. Hence, some
pathogenic mechanisms triggered by ischemia and/or reperfusion
(e.g. free radical production, inactivation of antioxidant enzymes,
inﬂammation, and cell death) are likely reduced by thalidomide.
3.3. Effect of thalidomide treatment on cell death
Cell death increased signiﬁcantly in the infarction area of 2I, 2I/24R,
and 2I/72R groups (Fig. 3). Conversely, the TUNEL-positive staining

3.5. Effect of thalidomide treatment on Akt activation
Akt is a Ser/Thr protein kinase, which is activated by
phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase. Akt promotes cell survival and prevents
apoptosis both by inactivating pro-apoptotic-proteins and by activating
anti-apoptotic proteins [24]. To evaluate the effect of TM on Akt activity
induced by MCAO, Akt phosphorylation was measured by Western blot.
Fig. 5 shows that TM induced Akt phosphorylation in the 2I TM, 2I/24R
TM, and 2I/72R TM groups with respect to control groups (2I R, 2I/24R,
2I/72R). These results point out that thalidomide induces Akt activation.
3.6. Effect of thalidomide treatment on MCAO-induced oxidative stress

was signiﬁcantly reduced in TM-treated groups (2I TM, 2I/24R TM, and
2I/72R TM), suggesting that thalidomide decreased the rate of cell
death.

3.4. Effect of thalidomide treatment on apoptosis
To assess the effect of TM on MCAO-induced apoptosis, the expression of the Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic protein was determined by Western
blot, as well as of the Bax pro-apoptotic protein and caspase-3
(Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B shows that Bcl-2 protein levels increased, while Bax
and caspase-3 levels decreased in the groups 2I TM, 2I/24R TM, and
2I/72R TM with respect to control groups (2I R, 2I/24R, 2I/72R). The
Bcl-2/Bax relation was increased in the groups 2I TM, 2I/24R TM, and
2I/72R TM respectively (data no shown). These results show that thalidomide inhibits the apoptosis induced by MCAO.

Several evidences suggest that oxidative stress is a key factor in the
onset and progression of ischemic brain damage (Chen et al., 201;
[22]). To assess the effect of thalidomide against MCAO-induced oxidative stress, the lipid hydroperoxide produced by lipoperoxidation in infarct areas was quantiﬁed with the LPO assay. Fig. 6 shows that TM
administration decreases signiﬁcantly the hydroperoxide levels in the
groups 2I TM, 2I/24R TM, and 21/72R TM (17.5 ± 0.7 (**p ≤ 0.01),
5 ± 2.8 (**p ≤ 0.01), and 1.7 ± 0.6 (**p ≤ 0.01)) with respect to control
groups (μM/mg protein: 22 ± 0.7, 22 ± 4, and 9.22 ± 3). Antioxidant
activity might be a relevant factor in preventing the neurological damage caused by ischemia-related oxidative stress [4]; therefore, the levels
of Sod1, Sod2, and catalase were determined by Western blot. Fig. 7
shows that TM administration did not modify the SOD1 expression
levels induced by MCAO in the groups 2I TM, 2I/24R TM, and 21/72R
TM. However, SOD2 expression levels were decreased in the groups

oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, which then are scavenged by CAT.

3.7. Effect of thalidomide treatment on MCAO-induced inﬂammation
To evaluate the effect of TM on MCAO-induced inﬂammation, the
concentration of the pro-inﬂammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF was
determined by ELISA. TM administration decreased signiﬁcantly the
concentration of TNF (pg/ml: 7.6 ± 1.3 vs. 3.7 ± 0.9 (°°p ≤ 0.01), 7 ±
1 vs. 3.4 ± 0.4 (°°p ≤ 0.01), and 1.9 ± 0.7 vs. 0.6 ± 0.2 (°p ≤ 0.05)), as
well as IL-1β (pg/ml: 334 ± 33 vs. 237 ± 50 (°p ≤ 0.05), 450 ± 30 vs.
208 ± 49 (°°p ≤ 0.01), and 183 ± 19 vs. 54 ± 14 (°°p ≤ 0.01)) in the
groups 2I TM, 2I/24R TM, and 2I/72R TM with respect to the control
groups (21, 2I/24R and 2I/72R) (Fig. 8).

3.8. Effect of thalidomide treatment on angiogenesis
In ischemia episodes, the growth of new blood vessels could be a
natural mechanism of defense in restoring the nutrient supply to brain
tissues [59]. However it has been reported that early VEGF administration induces brain edema, whereas late administration seems to have
the desired protective effect in the brain [63,33,42]). To assess the effect
of TM on MCAO-induced VEGF levels in the 2I, 2I/24R, and 21/72R
groups, VEGF concentration was determined in infarct areas by ELISA.
Fig. 9 shows that TM decreased VEGF levels in the 2I/24R TM group
with respect to 2I/24R (pg/ml: 95 ± 1 vs. 116 ± 2 (°p ≤ 0.05)). On
the other hand, no signiﬁcant differences were observed in the groups
2ITM and 2I/72R TM with respect to sham groups.

4. Discussion
Our results showed that thalidomide exerts a major protective effect
against cerebral injury by ischemia/reperfusion in rats, as estimated by
several molecular parameters. Speciﬁcally, we found that TM reduced
neurological deﬁcit scores and apoptosis, increasing the expression
level of the Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic protein; it reduced the number of
TUNEL-positive cells, as well as Bax and caspase-3 levels. Caspase-3 has
been reported as a key mediator of apoptosis during ischemic events.
While up-regulation of caspase-3 mRNA has been observed in rat brain
1 h after the onset of focal ischemia, caspase-3 activity as well as its cleavage products was detected in brain during early reperfusion 2 h after
MCAO [27]. Furthermore, a signiﬁcant increase in the caspase-3 activity
from day 1 through day 3 of MCAO has been reported [24].
In agreement to previously reported studies on mouse models of
focal cerebral ischemia, our ﬁndings show that thalidomide reduces
cellular apoptosis at doses of 20 mg/kg [18]. Furthermore, TM decreases
the number of TUNEL-positive cells and caspase-3 activity. It also enhances Bcl-2 expression in vitro on hypoxic ischemic cortical neurons,
by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway [56]. Akt has been proved to
promote cell survival and to prevent apoptosis by inactivating several
pro-apoptotic proteins. Akt phosphorylates BAD to inactivate its inhibitory effects on the Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL anti-apoptotic proteins [52].
Also, Akt induces the phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of
caspase-9. Caspase-9 leads to apoptosis via the mitochondrial death
pathway [3]. Akt phosphorylation has been found increased 1 h and
4 h after reperfusion in models of cerebral ischemia, but it decreases
signiﬁcantly 24 h after reperfusion [21,46]. Our study shows that TM
signiﬁcantly increases Akt phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression levels
in the 2I TM, 2I/24R TM, and 2I/72R TM groups. Our data suggest that
thalidomide exerts neuroprotective effects through Akt activation and
by inhibiting apoptosis.

Several mechanisms may contribute to inducing irreversible brain
damage during ischemia and reperfusion; such mechanisms include
the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, calcium deregulation, and
mitochondrial injury leading to ROS generation [38]. Overproduced
free radicals (superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, and
hydroxyl radicals) can induce functional and structural damage in
neurons due to their ability of reacting with lipids, proteins, and nucleic
acids, and even of inducing cell death [4,40].
ROS generation and an increased lipid peroxidation have been
detected both at early and late times after I/R damage, while an overexpression of antioxidant enzymes provides protection against cerebral

ischemia [8,19]. In addition, high SOD1 levels decreased the extent of
oxidative stress, attenuating the mitochondrial release of cyt c and the
activation of caspases 9 and 3, resulting in less apoptotic neuron death
after transient focal cerebral ischemia [10]. Our data show that hydroperoxide levels, an index of lipid peroxidation, were increased in the
control groups. The levels of SOD-1 and SOD-2 proteins were also increased in these groups, reﬂecting that antioxidant mechanisms in the
brain are activated to cope with the excess of ROS [1,9]. After TM treatment, the levels of hydroperoxides decreased signiﬁcantly in TM groups
with respect to control groups, while SOD1 expression levels induced by
MCAO in control groups were not modiﬁed by TM. However, SOD2

levels were decreased in the 2I/24R TM and 21/72R TM groups with respect to the 2I/24R and 21/72R groups, the latter not showing signiﬁcant
differences with regard to sham groups. These data suggest that TM reduced oxidative stress without affecting the high levels of the SOD1 protein induced by MCAO. Hyakkoku et al. suggest that the inhibitory
action of thalidomide against oxidative stress may underlie in part its
protective effects against ischemic neuronal damage in mice; thalidomide lowered the number of TUNEL-positive cells at the ischemic core
and also at penumbra areas. Also it was observed that thalidomide did
not alter physiological parameters as blood pressure, heart rate, arterial
pCO2, arterial pCO2 and regional cerebral blood ﬂow. Furthermore,
thalidomide prevented lipid peroxidation in vitro and decreased the
production of hydrogen peroxide and oxygen radicals [18]. It has
been suggested that TM metabolites (4-OH-TM, 3-OH-TM, 3′-OH-TM,
4′-OH-TM and/or 5′-OH-TM) could partake in its antioxidant effects
[18]. This same research team found that TM increased SOD activity
and signiﬁcantly decreased lipoperoxidation levels. The authors suggest
that thalidomide might inhibit oxidative stress by down-regulating
the NF- B signaling pathway [31]. Other studies have demonstrated
that NF- B regulates the expression of NADPH oxidase, a pro-oxidant enzyme [11]. In addition, TM inhibits the activity of nitric oxide synthase
(NOS), thus decreasing the production of nitric oxide (NO) [48]. NO induces the generation of free radicals by forming peroxynitrite anions,
which in turn produce the hydroxyl radical and the superoxide anion
[26]. NOS up-regulation after brain ischemia/reperfusion injury leads
to an overproduction of NO, disrupting the cerebral microvascular
integrity and inducing edema [46]. Simultaneously, the induced cyclooxygenase and protease enzymes enhance the production of IL-1β and
TNF [32,51]. Altogether, these ﬁndings indicate that TM might reduce
ROS generation by different mechanisms.

A disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) takes place during
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion events, leading to edema. This results in
the activated immune cells releasing pro-inﬂammatory cytokines,
mainly TNF and IL-1β, in the ischemic region; in turn, this triggers
additional inﬂammatory processes after pro-inﬂammatory genes
like cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), NOS, and NF- B are activated ([43];
[64]). The expression of these molecules recruits more circulating leukocytes and promotes the accumulation of neutrophils, macrophages,
and activated microglia, which inﬁltrate the ischemic region and lead
to further loss of neuronal cells and damage of the brain tissue, thus
enlarging the infarct area [35,50]. Yoon et al. demonstrated that
thalidomide analog (3,6-dithiothalidomide) reduced infarct volume,
neural death and neurological deﬁcit, by down-regulation of the
levels of TNF, IL-1 β, iNOS, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and
metalloproteinase-9 and preservation of occludin protein. They suggest
that the down-regulation TNF is sufﬁcient for suppressing microglia/
macrophage activation, BBB disruption and leukocyte inﬂammation
during focal ischemic stroke in mouse, thereby limiting brain damage
and improving functional outcome [54]. Herein we demonstrated that
the increased induction of TNF- and IL-1β was restored to normal levels
in TM-treated groups, similar to those observed in sham groups. TM has
been reported to reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury in rabbit spinal
cord by reducing TNF expression [28]. In other reports, TM treatment
decreased leukocyte inﬁltration and retinal edema, as well as VEGF
and TNF synthesis following retinal I/R injury [57]. Moreover, TM is
able to protect intestine, lungs, and liver against intestinal I/R injury
by inhibiting TNF expression and lipid peroxidation [2]. TM also blocks
the increase in IL-1β levels [45]. It has been proposed that TM could inhibit TNF production by promoting the degradation of TNF mRNA [37].
This reduction of TNF levels might also be related to the ability of TM

to inhibit I Bα phosphorylation by altering the activity of IKK, thus
blocking NF- B activation; this could imply that NF- B is a molecular target for TM action [23]. Yuan et al. demonstrated that inhibiting NF- B activity in focal cerebral I/R injury in rats induced a signiﬁcant decrease in
TNF and IL-1β levels and the suppression of neuronal apoptosis [55]. Recent research works showed that NF- B participates in the pathogenesis
of post-ischemic injury by inducing the expression of pro-apoptotic
molecules [20]. However, it has been reported that TM suppresses
the NF- B activation induced by TNF and IL-1β [36]. These studies
suggest that TM inhibits the levels of TNF and IL-1β in several models
of ischemia/reperfusion injury, thus reducing inﬂammation and
tissue damage.
On the other side, BBB disruption increases abnormal vascular
permeability and aggravates brain edema [6,53]. Vascular permeability
further increases after reperfusion, reaching a peak on day 1 before

gradually returning to normal values. VEGF levels rise in parallel to the
increase of vascular permeability in the initial period after reperfusion.
In our study, TM signiﬁcantly decreased VEGF levels; thus, TM might
prevent a possible hemorrhage secondary to revascularization. It has
been suggested that TM has anti-angiogenic properties without prejudice to its neuroprotective effect on focal cerebral ischemia in mice
[18]. This angiogenesis inhibition may be due to a down-regulation of
VEGF expression [36].
It has been reported that DMSO might cause some central effects (as
antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory and as anti-apoptotic) or vice versa. Per
se, these effects may be due to differences in the model used as well as
the concentration of DMSO administrated [7,13,41,47,55]. Our results
demonstrated that the groups (2I, 2I/24R, and 2I/72R) treated with
DMSO did not show any reduction in oxidative stress, inﬂammation,
and cell death induced by MCAO with respect to thalidomide-treated.

Then, we can conclude that all neuroprotector effect is given by thalidomide. Also, it has been reported the neuroprotector effect of a thalidomide analog on neuronal damage induced by ischemic stroke [54].
Ghoneim et al. demonstrated that curcumine dissolved in DMSO, significantly reduced neuronal damage following CNS injury compared to
DMSO groups [12].
Our study is consistent with the reported by Hyakkoku et al. They
concluded that TM (dissolved in 0.968 g/kg of DMSO) reduces ischemic
brain injury in mice subjected to permanent MCAO through decrease in
oxidative stress. In addition, we demonstrated that TM reduced the
neuronal loss and improved the functional outcome in a rat model of
focal ischemic stroke by down-regulating the pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (TNF and IL-1β) and pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Caspase-3),
and increasing the Akt and Bcl-2 activity, besides of a reduction in the
oxidative stress. These results suggest that thalidomide exerts its
neuro-protective effect by its anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidant, and antiinﬂammatory activities.
5. Conclusion
Oxidative stress, inﬂammation, and apoptosis contribute decisively
to neuronal damage induced by ischemic injury. Herein we demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that thalidomide exhibits protective effects against
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by reducing both oxidative stress
and the elicited inﬂammatory response. Our results indicate that thalidomide has a potential to ameliorate the cellular dysfunction induced by
cerebral ischemia, thereby sparing vulnerable neurons from cell death,
inhibiting oxidative stress and the expression of pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines (TNF and IL-1β), decreasing VEGF levels, increasing Akt
and Bcl-2 activity, and promoting the down-regulation of apoptotic
markers. Our results suggest that thalidomide exerts neuroprotective
effects by interfering in several steps of tissular injury along the ischemia/reperfusion cascade. Further experimental studies are required to
establish the potential use of thalidomide in patients with ischemic
stroke.
