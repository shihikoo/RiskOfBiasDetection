tory system in CNS, Kþ-Cl--co-transporter 2 (KCC2), a Cl- extruder, plays a critical role in
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory effect in mature central neurons. However,
the effect of propofol postconditioning on the expression of KCC2 in GABAergic interneurons is unclear. Therefore, in this article we describe the role of KCC2 in GABAergic
interneurons in the ipsilateral hippocampal CA1 region of adult rats and the effects of
propofol postconditioning on this region. Herein we demonstrate that propofol postconditioning (20 mg/kg/h, 2 h) improved rats' neurobehavioral abilities, increased the number of
survival neurons, and up-regulated neuronal KCC2 expression in glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) expressing GABAergic interneurons in hippocampal CA1 region at 24 h
after I/R. In contrast, when rats were injected with the KCC2 antagonist, [(dihydroindenyl)
oxy] alkanoic acid (DIOA), the neuroprotective effects induced by propofol postconditioning
were reversed. Our study indicated that propofol postconditioning increased the expression of KCC2 in inhibitory GABAergic interneurons, thus providing acute neuroprotection
to rats who had undergone cerebral I/R injury.

Introduction

Acute ischemia stroke (AIS) is a common perioperative
complication for patients undergoing major noncardiac surgeries, cardiac surgeries, and major vascular surgeries
(Bateman et al., 2009; Selim, 2007). In addition, approximately
33% of patients with cerebral ischemia experienced cognitive
dysfunction (Hachinski et al., 2010). Therefore, it is very
important for anesthetists to take effective management to
eliminate and to prevent perioperative AIS. Our previous
study showed that cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury
resulted in neurons impairment by down-regulating neuron
membrane expression of the GluR2 subunit of glutamate
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic
acid
(AMPA) and by inhibiting AMPA-upstream phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) signal pathway in vivo (Wang
et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013). Research has
demonstrated that it is very important to sustain the equilibrium of excitatory and inhibitory signaling in the central
nervous system (CNS) in order to protect the brain and to
alleviate I/R injury (Pozo et al., 2010). The “excitotoxicity”
caused by over-activation of excitatory nervous systems and/
or the excessive suppression of inhibitory nervous systems
have been regarded as the primary mechanisms of cerebral
impairment after cerebral stroke (Pozo et al. 2010).
Kþ-Cl--co-transporter 2 (KCC2), as a neuron Cl- extruder,
plays a critical role in producing inhibitory effect (Viitanen
2010). It can transport intracellular Cl- to the synaptic cleft
and contribute to higher [Cl-] in the synaptic cleft, which is a
signiﬁcant physiological foundation of GABA showing inhibitory effect for mature neurons. Thus, it is an important
regulator that keeps inhibitory function of GABAA receptor
(Blaesse et al., 2009; Medina et al., 2014; Payne et al., 2003;
Rivera et al., 1999). GABAA receptor is the primary subtype in
GABAergic inhibitory CNS, and propofol is GABAA receptor
agonist (Wakita et al., 2013). Glutamic acid decarboxylase 67
(GAD67) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the decarboxylation
of glutamate to GABA (Martin et al., 1991) and it is also
regarded as a reliable marker of inhibitory interneurons
presence (Esclapez et al., 1994; Fukuda et al., 1998). However,
the role of inhibitory interneurons in propofol-induced postconditioning is still unclear. This study examines the effects
of propofol postconditioning on the expression of KCC2 in
GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampal CA1 area of rats
with cerebral I/R injury in vivo and may provide a new
treatment target for clinical research.

ranged from 0 to 18. A score of 0 was equivalent to no
damage. A higher score equated to more severe nerve
damage. The results of mNSS from six groups are shown in

of the DIOAþPro group was statistically signiﬁcantly reduced
(10.8370.54 vs. 13.1770.48, P¼ 0.002). Compared with groups
without DIOA, the scores in groups with DIOA were statistically signiﬁcantly higher (Po0.05), respectively (Fig. 1B).

2.2.
Propofol postconditioning played a neuroprotective
role by increasing the number of surviving neurons in CA1
area of ipsilateral hippocampus and by decreasing the density
of dendritic spines on injured neurons, while cerebral I/R
injury and KCC2 antagonist DIOA showed the opposite role,
and worsened neuron impairment
2.2.1.

Nissl staining

At 24 h after I/R, the surviving neurons of hippocampal CA1
area are shown in Fig. 2A and B. A lower number of neurons
are shown to have survived in the I/R group than that in the
sham group (180.077.8 vs. 215.878.6, P¼ 0.020). There were
statistically signiﬁcantly more surviving neurons in the Pro
group than in the I/R group (215.078.5 vs. 180.077.8,
P¼ 0.025). The same trend was seen in the DIOAþPro group
than in the DIOAþI/R group (174.276.4 vs. 141.774.0,
P¼ 0.047) (Fig. 2C). Compared with groups without DIOA, the

number of surviving neurons in the DIOA groups was statistically signiﬁcantly lower (Po0.05) respectively (Fig. 2D).

Golgi staining

The images of dendrites and proximal dendritic spines in
hippocampal CA1 area are shown in Fig. 3A and B. Alterations
in the total number of proximal dendrites spines are shown
in Fig. 3C. The number of spines in the I/R group was more
than that in the sham group (16.0070.68 vs. 10.5070.89,
P ¼0.12). The density of spines in the Pro group was statistically signiﬁcantly decreased compared with density of spines
in the I/R group (11.8770.83 vs. 16.0070.68, p¼ 0.039). Compared with the DIOAþI/R group, the number of spines in the
DIOAþPro group was also statistically signiﬁcantly lower
(16.00 70.63 vs. 20.8371.91, P¼ 0.038) (Fig. 4C). Compared

2.3.
Cerebral I/R injury and KCC2 antagonist DIOA downregulated hippocampal KCC2 expression in GABAergic
interneurons, whereas propofol postconditioning reversed the
effect of I/R and DIOA
Double-immunoﬂuorescence staining was performed to
measure changes of KCC2 expression in GAD67-expressing
GABAergic interneurons of ipsilateral hippocampus and
images were shown in Fig. 4A. Propofol postconditioning
signiﬁcantly up-regulated the KCC2 expression in GABAergic
interneurons as compared with I/R group (94.8371.64 vs.

84.6771.75, P¼ 0.040). The same trend was seen in the
DIOAþPro group compared with the DIOAþI/R group
(56.3372.97 vs. 44.3371.52, P¼ 0.003) (Fig. 4B). Compared with
groups without DIOA, the expression of KCC2 in GABAergic
interneurons in hippocampal CA1 area with DIOA was signiﬁcantly down-regulated (Po0.01), respectively (Fig. 4C).
The immunoblotting of hippocampal total KCC2 in hippocampal area was shown in Fig. 5A. Propofol postconditioning
also signiﬁcantly up-regulated the KCC2 expression, as compared
with the I/R group (94.3371.41 vs. 84.6772.49, P¼ 0.008). The
same trend was seen in the DIOA þPro group and the DIOAþI/R
group (50.8372.51 vs. 42.6771.09, P¼ 0.039) (Fig. 5B). Compared
with groups without DIOA, the expression of KCC2 in hippocampal area with DIOA was signiﬁcantly down-regulated
(Po0.001), respectively (Fig. 5C).

Discussion

In our current study, intravenous propofol (20 mg/kg/h, 2 h)
signiﬁcantly decreased mNSS scores, elevated the number of
surviving neurons in CA1 area of ipsilateral region, decreased
the density of dendritic spines, up-regulated neuronal KCC2
expression in GAD67-expressing inhibitory interneurons, and
eventually alleviated acute cerebral injury induced by I/R in
the rats; however, KCC2 antagonist DIOA (Kurbannazarova
et al., 2011) contributed to the opposite effects and reversed
propofol postconditioning neuroprotection. The mNSS, Nissl
staining, and Golgi staining were used to assess the extent of
neural impairment. The mNSS was used to evaluate neurobehavioral varieties (Bonilla et al., 2012). The Nissl staining
and Golgi staining were used to demonstrate the degree of
neuronal damage. Nissl staining is a method that examines
the extent of cerebral damage. The number of nissl-stained

cells (Nissl bodies) represents the number of surviving neurons (Liu et al., 2011; Xia et al., 2012). In addition, we studied
the extent of neuron damage by surveying spines density
using the most widely used Golgi staining (Diamond et al.,
2006; Restivo et al., 2006; Ruan, et al., 2009; Shors, et al., 2001,)
and high density of spines is a hallmark of neuron injury at
24 h after cerebral ischemia (Ruan et al., 2009). Dendritic
spines are quite stable in mature brains but highly dynamic
during neuron development (Li et al., 2008), and they are
closely related to learning and memory (Chang et al., 2014).
The increase in dendritic spines of hippocampal neurons is
thought to be a structural basis for the cognitive impairments
because of their critical roles in synaptic transmission and in
plasticity (Calabrese et al., 2006; Scheuss and Bonhoeffer,
2014; Wan et al., 2014). Ischemia-mediated Ca2þ inﬂux has
been demonstrated to have correlation with alteration of

spine density. Higher intracellular [Ca2þ] is a cause of
increasing spine density (Hoskison et al., 2007).
In our research, the hippocampal CA1 area was selected as
a major study site because of its higher sensitivity to
ischemia. Neurons in this area are called ‘selectively vulnerable neurons' (Bernaudin et al., 1998). After cerebral ischemic
injury sustains seven minutes, the hippocampal CA1 region
will show signiﬁcant changes (Bernaudin et al., 1998). In
addition, CA1 region impairment can lead to cognitive dysfunction in spatial memory and in learning by affecting the
modulation of timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (Kondo
et al., 2013).
Our previous studies have showed that propofol postconditioning could produce neuroprotective function by inhibiting internalization of the GluR2 subunit of AMPA receptors
and by increasing the activity of the PI3K/Akt signal pathway
in vivo (Wang et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013).
Therefore, our previous studies focused on the effect of
propofol postconditioning on the excitatory nervous system.
In the adult CNS, there exists a homeostatic mechanism of
excitatory and inhibitory CNS maintaining the normal state
of brain functions (Pozo et al. 2010). This study concentrated
on the inhibitory GABAergic nervous system.
In the mature vertebrate inhibitory CNS, GABA, as a major
inhibitory transmitter, can bind GABA receptors to mediate
inhibitory responses (Krnjević, 2010). Among GABA receptor
system, the most important part is the GABAA receptor, which

is Cl--selective ligand-gated ion channel and is also known as the
ionotropic receptor (Richard et al., 2008, Sieghart and Sperk,
2002). The physiological basis of the inhibitory function of the
GABAA receptor is higher synaptic cleft [Cl-]. The physiological
function of GABAA receptor is related to equilibrium potential of
Cl- of neuronal membrane (Kahle et al., 2008). The activation of
GABAA receptor can cause Cl- channel opening in the postsynaptic membrane. The inﬂux of Cl- leads to hyper-polarization of
the postsynaptic membrane and produces an inhibitory effect
(Belelli and Lambert, 2005; Jonsson Fagerlund et al., 2010). KCC2,
which is a Cl- extruder, can maintain a relatively higher [Cl-] of
synaptic cleft and create a Cl- equilibrium potential negative to
the resting membrane voltage (Fuchs et al., 2010; Viemari et al.,
2011; Viitanen et al., 2010). Thus, it is a prerequisite for hyperpolarization mediated by GABAA receptor, and can produce an
inhibitory effect (Fuchs et al., 2010; Medina et al., 2014; Viemari
et al., 2011). According to research from Jaenisch (Jaenisch et al.,
2010), 30 min and 120 min focal brain ischemia inhibited the
synthesis of ischemic hemisphere KCC2 mRNA and reduced the
expression of KCC2 protein. A study by Papp et al. (Papp et al.,
2008) also demonstrated that 15 min of brain ischemia led to a
decrease in KCC2 expression before degenerative change to
hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and all the surviving
neurons were KCC2-positive. Also, KCC2 plays a critical role in
neuronal development and synaptic plasticity (Kaila et al., 2014).
According to research, at the ﬁrst postnatal week, neuronal KCC2
shows low expression, the concentration of chloride inside of

216

brain research 1597 (2015) 210–219

neurons is higher than that in synaptic cleft. When GABA binds
it's A receptors, chloride efﬂux happens and leads to depolarization and eventually produces excitatory effect, which has intimate relationship to neuronal development for immature
mammals (Rivera et al., 2005). Interestingly, for adult mammals,
GABA signaling depolarization induced by knockdown of KCC2
produces GABA excitatory effect (Chamma et al., 2012). “Excitotoxicity” produced by depolarization of GABA signaling results in
neuron loss (Pozo and Goda, 2010). Additionally, high intracellular Cl- concentration mediated by KCC2 down-regulation is
regarded as another signiﬁcant factor of neuronal impairment
(Pellegrino et al., 2011). Neuronal damage and loss produced by
KCC2 down-regulation can promote neurogenesis and accelerate
dendritic growth in adult CNS (Kim et al., 2012). DIOA is KCC2speciﬁc antagonist. Some studies showed that knockdown of
KCC2 through DIOA decreased hippocampal neuronal survival
(Pellegrino et al., 2011) and led to locomotor deﬁciency (Yang
et al., 2013). Therefore, adult rats injected with DIOA can
demonstrate behavioral dysfunction, neuron loss, dendritic
development and down-regulation of KCC2 compared with
sham group.
Propofol plays anesthetic and sedative functions by activating central GABAA receptors. It binds postsynaptic GABAA
receptors and leads to an increased Cl- inﬂux, generating
inhibitory postsynaptic currents and forming an inhibitory
effect (Wakita et al., 2013). According to a previous study,
propofol impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) by sustaining
KCC2 expression and by decreasing excitability of CNS in vitro
(Wang et al., 2006), which gives us some hints that propofol
postconditioning may play a neuroprotection for cerebral I/R
rats through up-regulating KCC2 expression in GABAergic
interneurons in vivo. Our study showed that propofol postconditioning signiﬁcantly lowered mNSS scores, ipsilaterally elevated the number of surviving neurons, and reduced the
density of spines. These results revealed that propofol postconditioning reduced the extent of neuronal damage ipsilaterally at 24 h postoperative. However, KCC2 antagonist DIOA
contributed to the opposite effects and exacerbated cerebral
impairment. Our results from double-immunoﬂuorescence and
Western blotting in vivo showed that a signiﬁcantly downregulated hippocampal KCC2 expression in GAD67-expressing
GABAergic interneurons had occurred at acute stage in the I/R
group compared with the sham group. Propofol postconditioning signiﬁcantly elevated KCC2 expression. However, the
increase in KCC2 expression induced by propofol postconditioning was reversed by the KCC2 antagonist DIOA. These results
demonstrated that propofol postconditioning inhibits excitotoxicity by up-regulating the KCC2 expression in GABAergic
interneurons at 24 h after cerebral I/R injury.
In total, our present study demonstrates that upregulating KCC2 expression in GABAergic interneurons in
the cerebral I/R rat model is a cause of acute (24 h after I/R)
neuroprotection-induced by propofol postconditioning
(20 mg/kg/h infused at the onset of reperfusion for 2 h).

Experimental Procedures

The committee of experimental animals of Tianjin Medical
University approved all the surgical procedures. Adult male

Sprague-Dawley rats, aged 7–8 weeks, weighing 250–280 g,
were selected for the experiment. All the rats were cared for
according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (The National Research Council, 2011). Rats were
anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of Inactin (thiobutabarbital, 100 mg/kg; RBI, Natick, MA), and ventilated with
oxygen (35%) with air mixture (Wang et al., 2011).

4.1.

Stroke model and grouping

Rats were divided randomly into six groups: Sham (n ¼36),
focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) (n¼34), Propofol (Pro)
(n ¼35) and KCC2 antagonist DIOA (Sigama) (Kurbannazarova,
et al., 2011) þSham, (n¼ 35) DIOAþI/R (n ¼33), DIOAþPro
(n ¼34). The rats in the groups with inhibitor were injected
intravenously with DIOA 30 μg, 15 min before surgery. The
right side middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was
performed as Longa introduction (Longa et al., 1989). One
hour after MCAO, the suture was pulled out 10 mm to allow
for reperfusion. Regional CBF was monitored by laser-Doppler
ﬂowmeter (Periﬂux system 5000; Perimed Inc., Jarfalla, Sweden). The exclusion criteria were less than 70% of cerebral
blood ﬂow reduction after suture had been implanted (Xing
et al., 2008). A suture was implanted into the right internal
carotid artery 1 cm for the Sham group. (1) Regarding group
Pro, at the onset of reperfusion, propofol was infused intravenously at a speed of 20 mg/kg/h by a syringe pump for 2 h
duration (Wang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2011). (2) Group I/R
was treated with vehicle (saline) at the same speed and
timing as the propofol group. (3) The rats were subjected to
sham without treatment. Polyethylene catheters were
inserted into the right femoral artery to monitor blood
pressure and blood gases, and into the right femoral vein to
administer medicine. Vital signs (mean arterial blood pressure, temperature, arterial blood gases) were measured at
30 min before ischemia, at the onset of ischemia, and at
30 min after reperfusion. Body temperature of the rats was
maintained at 3770.5 1C by lamp irradiation.
All experiments were performed at 24 h after cerebral
reperfusion. Rats were decapitated under the anesthesia by
intraperitoneal injection of Inactin. Those rats that underwent neurobehavioral testing were not decapitated.

4.2.

Neurobehavioral test

mNSS (Suppl.1) was performed to evaluate neurobehavioral
changes in the rats (n ¼7–8/group) (Bonilla et al., 2012). The
experiment included four scores: movement, sensation,
reﬂexes, and balance. On this mNSS scale, the lowest score
is 0, and the highest is 18. On the mNSS test, a score of 0 is
equivalent to no damage. Increasingly higher scores are
indicative of greater nerve damage. One point is awarded
for the inability to perform a task or for the lack of tested
reﬂex; scores ranging from 1–6 indicate mild injury; scores
ranging from 7–12 indicate moderate injury; and scores
ranging from 13–18 indicate severe injury.

4.3.

Nissl staining

Parafﬁned coronal hippocampal slices (10 μm thickness)
(n¼ 5–6/group) from each group were prepared for nissl stain
at 24 h after reperfusion. All slices were heated at 60 1C for 2 h
in an incubator in order to melt the parafﬁn; then, slices were
dewaxed in Xylene for 5–10 min, three times. The series of
steps were performed and included bathing in anhydrous
ethanol for 5 min, 90% ethanol for 2 min, 70% ethanol for
2 min, distilled water for 2 min, and cresyl violet for 10 min.
Then, slices were washed with distilled water for 2 min  2
times and dehydrated in 95% ethanol for 5 min  2 times.
To assess hippocampal injury, the number of neurons in
the pyramidal layer of ﬁve continuous random ﬁelds (400  )
of CA1 region (6 slides/group) was selected and the number of
survival neurons was counted under BX-51 ﬂuorescence
microscope (Olympus Corporation, Japan) in a blinded manner according to the method described by Tian et al. (Tian
et al., 2013). The analysis of data was performed through
Image Pro Plus 6.0 software.

Golgi staining

Rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of Inactin
and perfused with 0.9% saline containing heparin. The rat brains
(n¼5–6/ group) were removed to evaluate the density of hippocampal dendritic spines in the ipsilateral area according to a
previous protocol (by Golgi staining) (Chakraborti et al., 2012). Rat
brains were placed in Golgi solution and stored in the dark for 14
days at routine temperature, and then transferred into a sucrosebased solution and stored at 4 1C for three days. Transverse
sections (150 μm) were prepared with an oscillating tissue slicer
(Leica, VT1000, Wetzlar, Germany) and mounted on gelatincoated slides. All the slices were rinsed in distilled water and
placed in a solution containing silver nitrate for 10 min after
being dried at room temperature. Next, slides were rinsed again
in distilled water and dehydrated in absolute alcohol, cleared
with xylene, mounted on slides, and covered with nonacidic
synthetic balsam and coverslips.
The criteria for selecting dendrites of CA1 pyramidal
neurons: (1) neurons were located in the sections with typical
hippocampal CA1 formation; (2) tertiary dendrites were chosen; (3) the dendritic segments and spines were completely
ﬁlled; and (4) the dendritic segments for spine counting were
almost in the same focal plane (Ruan et al., 2009).
The analysis of spine density was performed according to
the method introduced by Ruan et al. (Ruan et al., 2009). Five
dendritic arbors were made on proximal area. The procedure
was as follows. First, dendrites were selected under a 100 
oil-immersion lens, which captured the images (1000  ) of
these dendrites by an optical microscope (NIKON ECLIPSE-80i,
Nikon, Japan). A dendrite measuring 40–60 μm in length was
ﬁrst drawn by Neurolucida, version 6.0 (bright ﬁeld). Then,
spines were added to these dendrites. The data of spine
density were output through the NeuroExplore.

Double-immunoﬂuorescence

Frozen coronal hippocampal slices (5 μm thickness) were
prepared at 24 h after reperfusion. Sections (n¼ 5–6/group)

217

with immunoﬂuorescence staining used to observe the varieties of KCC2 in GAD67-expressing interneurons. Slices were
incubated with both of KCC2 and GAD67 primary antibody
(KCC2: 1:400, Rabbit polyclonal antibody, Abcam; GAD67:
1:400, Mouse monoclonal antibody, Abcam) under 4 1C overnight. The secondary antibodies (KCC2: 1:1000, Goat antirabbit, Abcam; GAD67: 1:1000, Goat anti-mouse, Abcam) were
incubated under the temperature of 37 1C for 1 h.
To assess KCC2 varieties, the mean number of KCC2
positive cells of ﬁve random ﬁelds (200  ) in GAD67expressing GABAergic interneurons of the CA1 region were
counted under a BX-51 ﬂuorescence microscope (Olympus
Corporation, Japan). The ratio of KCC2 positive cells in the
ipsilateral CA1 in group I/R, Pro, DIOAþsham, DIOAþI/R and
DIOAþPro to sham group was recorded respectively. Image
Pro Plus 6.0 software was used to analyze data.

4.6.

Western blotting

At 24 h after reperfusion, ﬁve to six hippocampal samples
from each group were homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mmol/
L Tris–HCL pH 6.8, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% NP-40 and protease inhibitor
cocktail) and centrifuged (2000 g, 10 min, 4 1C). Aliquots of
the supernatant containing 50 μg of protein were separated
by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and then immunoblotted onto polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes. The residual binding
sites on the membrane were blocked by incubation with notfat milk powder for 1 h, followed by incubation with the
rabbit anti-KCC2 antibodies (1:1,000; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) overnight. The blots were incubated with the
secondary antibody anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h after being washed
in TBST (20 mMTris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) 5 min  5
times. After an additional TBST washing, the membrane was
treated with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit
(Millipore). Quantitative analysis of the band densities was
performed using Image J software 1.42 (National Institutes of
Health, USA) in a blinded fashion. We normalized the relative
band expression by using the band expression of β-actin as
reference (1:2000, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom).

Statistical analyses

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS
Science, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data are presented as
mean7SEM, one-way ANOVA was used for statistical analyses and followed by post hoc LSD test was used. P o0.05
was considered of statistical signiﬁcance.
