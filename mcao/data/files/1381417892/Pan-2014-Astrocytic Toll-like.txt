Abstract
Background: Cerebral ischemic preconditioning (IPC) protects brain against ischemic injury. Activation of Toll-like receptor 3
(TLR3) signaling can induce neuroprotective mediators, but whether astrocytic TLR3 signaling is involved in IPC-induced
ischemic tolerance is not known.
Methods: IPC was modeled in mice with three brief episodes of bilateral carotid occlusion. In vitro, IPC was modeled in
astrocytes by 1-h oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Injury and components of the TLR3 signaling pathway were measured
after a subsequent protracted ischemic event. A neutralizing antibody against TLR3 was used to evaluate the role of TLR3
signaling in ischemic tolerance.
Results: IPC in vivo reduced brain damage from permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice and increased
expression of TLR3 in cortical astrocytes. IPC also reduced damage in isolated astrocytes after 12-h OGD. In astrocytes, IPC or
12-h OGD alone increased TLR3 expression, and 12-h OGD alone increased expression of phosphorylated NFkB (pNFkB).
However, IPC or 12-h OGD alone did not alter the expression of Toll/interleukin receptor domain-containing adaptorinducing IFNb (TRIF) or phosphorylated interferon regulatory factor 3 (pIRF3). Exposure to IPC before OGD increased TRIF
and pIRF3 expression but decreased pNFkB expression. Analysis of cytokines showed that 12-h OGD alone increased IFNb
and IL-6 secretion; 12-h OGD preceded by IPC further increased IFNb secretion but decreased IL-6 secretion. Preconditioning
with TLR3 ligand Poly I:C increased pIRF3 expression and protected astrocytes against ischemic injury; however, cells treated
with a neutralizing antibody against TLR3 lacked the IPC- and Poly I:C-induced ischemic protection and augmentation of
IFNb.
Conclusions: The results suggest that IPC-induced ischemic tolerance is mediated by astrocytic TLR3 signaling. This
reprogramming of TLR3 signaling by IPC in astrocytes may play an important role in suppression of the post-ischemic
inflammatory response and thereby protect against ischemic damage. The mechanism may be via activation of the TLR3/
TRIF/IRF3 signaling pathway.

mammals and play an important role in the brain’s repair and
inflammatory responses by producing various cytokines and
growth factors [3,4,5]. They are essential to preserving neural
tissue and restricting inflammation after brain injury. Neurons
cannot survive in the brain if adjacent astrocytes are damaged
during ischemia or other brain insults [6,7]. Nonetheless, it
remains unknown whether IPC affects astrocyte cell death
outcomes after simulated ischemia.

Introduction
Cerebral ischemic preconditioning (IPC) refers to a transient,
sublethal ischemic event that results in tolerance to subsequent
lethal cerebral ischemia. IPC is believed to trigger an intrinsic
neuroprotective mechanism [1,2]. Most studies of brain ischemic
preconditioning in vivo and in vitro have been limited to neurons.
However, astrocytes comprise the majority of brain cells in

Ischemia Preconditioning Activates TLR3 Signaling in Astrocytes

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a critical role in initiating the
inflammatory response during cerebral injury [8,9,10,11]. TLRs
are a family of evolutionarily conserved molecules that directly
detect and defend against pathogen invasion. Upon activation by
specific ligands, TLR signaling is initiated by two cytoplasmic
adaptor proteins: myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and
Toll/interleukin receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing
IFNb (TRIF) [12]. Each of the 10 currently known TLR family
members, with the exception of TLR3, signals through the
MyD88-dependent pathway, which activates transcription factors
NF-kB and AP-1 and leads to generation of pro-inflammatory
cytokines IL-6 and TNF-a. TLR3 signals through the MyD88independent pathway (initiated by the adaptor protein TRIF) that
activates transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 and generates antiinflammatory molecules such as IFNb and IL-10, which have been
associated with neuroprotection [13,14,15]. Of the TLRs, only
TLR4 can utilize either of these pathways [12].
TLR4 activation in response to cerebral ischemia leads to an
excessive inflammatory response that plays a deleterious role in
cerebral ischemic injury [16,17,18,19]. However, evidence
suggests that TLR4 might also be involved in IPC-induced
ischemic tolerance [12,20,21]. Studies suggest that preconditioning with TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide enhances TLR4
signaling through the MyD88-independent pathway, thereby
suppressing the ischemia-induced inflammatory response [22].
Unlike TLR4, TLR3 signals exclusively through the MyD88independent pathway. Interestingly, deletion of TLR3 in mice did
not alter infarction volume after stroke compared with that in
wild-type mice [18]. Additionally, Bsibsi et al. reported that
medium from human astrocytes conditioned with TLR3 ligand
polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) improved neuronal
survival in human brain slice cultures [23] and that Poly I:C
freshly added to control medium promoted neuronal survival
equally well. It was also reported that acute treatment of primary
mouse cortical cells with Poly I:C protects against oxygen-glucose
deprivation (OGD)-induced cell death [24]. Moreover, Poly I:C
induces protracted resistance of human astrocytes to H2O2 toxicity
[25], whereas TLR3 contributes to ischemic injury in the gut [26].
In the central nervous system (CNS), astrocytes express robust
TLR-3. When activated by cytokines, TLR agonists, or oxidative
stress, astrocytes produce TLR3 more strongly than any other
TLR [23,27]. To determine whether astrocytic TLR3 signaling
contributes to IPC-induced ischemic tolerance, we established in
vivo and in vitro models of IPC and analyzed expression and
function of TLR3 in astrocytes. Furthermore, we examined the
potential neuroprotection by preconditioning with TLR3 ligand
Poly I:C.

For the recovery after surgery, the animals were returned to cages
with highly absorbent soft bedding. The mice were housed in
pairs, and the ambient temperature was maintained at 20–23uC.

Induction of preconditioning and permanent focal
ischemia
During the procedures to induce IPC and focal ischemia, mice
were placed under anesthesia with ketamine (100 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally. For IPC, both common carotid arteries
were exposed and ligated with 6-0 silk sutures three times for
1 min each. Between each ligation, the arteries were reopened for
5 min [28]. Sham-operated mice underwent the same procedure
without ligation. Permanent focal ischemia was produced by
intraluminal middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (MCAO) for
24 h with a 6-0 nylon monofilament (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ,
USA). Successful occlusion of the MCA was verified and recorded
by laser-Doppler flowmetry (Moor VMS-LDF, Devon, UK).
Groups of 9 mice underwent MCAO 24 h after preconditioning
or the sham operation.

Evaluation of neurologic deficit score and determination
of infarct size
An investigator blinded to treatment group evaluated the
neurologic deficits of each mouse (n = 6 per group) at 24 h after
MCAO using the Zea-Longa method as described previously
[29,30]. Mice were then killed with an overdose of pentobarbital.
The brains were sectioned into five 1-mm-thick coronal slices and
incubated in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride monohydrate
(TTC) at 37uC for 15 min, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
overnight. The brain slices were photographed and the area of
ischemic damage was measured by an image analysis system [31]
(Image J software, a public domain image analysis program
developed at the National Institutes of Health).

Immunofluorescence staining
Immunofluorescence was carried out as described previously
[32,33]. The cellular localization of TLR3 was measured in brain
sections from a cohort of mice (n = 3 per group) killed at 24 h after
preconditioning; sham-operated mice served as controls. The mice
were perfused transcardially with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brain region –1.0 mm from the optic chiasm was
then cut into 30-mm coronal sections by a cryostat (SM2000R,
LEICA, Berlin, Germany). For double staining of TLR3 and glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the sections were incubated
together with goat anti-TLR3 antibody (1:50; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and mouse anti-GFAP
antibody (1:200; Epitomics, Cambridge, UK) overnight at 4–8uC,
and then incubated sequentially with fluorescein-labeled secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, images in the
brain cortex were observed with a fluorescence microscope
(Olympus BX-51; Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan).

Materials and Methods
Animals
All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at the Huazhong University of Science
and Technology and conformed to the National Institutes of
Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Oneday-old Sprague-Dawley rats and adult male Kunming mice were
obtained from the Center for Experimental Animals, Huazhong
University of Science and Technology, China. Thirty newborn rat
pups were decapitated after being anesthetized by ether inhalation.
We removed the cortex from each rat for astrocyte cultures under
sterile conditions. Cerebral ischemia was induced in 24 adult male
mice that were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injections of
ketamine (100 mg/kg). The mice were placed on a heating pad
during surgery to maintain a normal body temperature of 37uC.

Astrocyte culture
Astrocyte cultures were prepared from neonatal rat cortical
cultures as described previously [34]. Briefly, mixed cortical
neurons and glia were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks at a concentration
of 26106 cells/mL in DMEM/F-12 containing 20% fetal bovine
serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. On
day 14 of culture, flasks were shaken at 200 rpm for 5 h to detach
microglia and oligodendrocytes from the layer of astrocytes, which
are more adherent. Astrocytes remaining in the flask were
harvested with 0.125% trypsin, and the suspension was centrifuged
at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended and cultured

in flasks at a concentration of 26106 cells/mL. On day 19 of
culture, the flasks were shaken again to exclude microglial
contamination [35], and astrocytes remaining in the flasks were
harvested. The pellet was resuspended to a concentration of 1–
26105 cells/mL with culture medium containing 20% fetal bovine
serum. Cells were plated to achieve a confluent monolayer on 96well culture plates or 35-mm dishes coated with poly-D-lysine
(100 mg/mL). Anti-GFAP antibodies were used to tag microfibers
in the cytoplasm of astrocytes. To identify astrocytes, we analyzed
cultures by immunofluorescent staining with goat anti-GFAP
antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and counterstained with DAPI to stain nuclei. All experiments were performed
on day 22 of culture.

serum albumin as a standard. Equal amounts of the protein
samples were loaded onto 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gels, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred onto a
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were incubated
with rabbit anti-TLR3 polyclonal antibody (1:1000; Abcam,
Cambridge, UK), rabbit anti-TRIF polyclonal antibody (1:600;
Abcam), rabbit anti-pIRF3 (1:500; Anbo, San Francisco, CA,
USA), rabbit anti-p-NFkB p65 polyclonal antibody (1:500; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), or goat anti-actin (1:500; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) at 4uC overnight. Membranes were then incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for
1 h at room temperature. The positive bands were revealed with
enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents and autoradiography film. Optical densities of the bands were scanned and
quantified with Image J software. Actin served as an internal
control.

Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)
The cultures were incubated in glucose-free DMEM in an
airtight box that was continuously filled with 95% N2 and 5%
CO2 to induce OGD as described by Liu et al. [36]. Cultures
subjected to transient 1-h OGD and then reoxygenated for 24 h to
induce OGD resistance were designated as the IPC group based
on our trial experiment. Cultures subjected to 12-h OGD (lethal)
were designated as the OGD group. Cultures that were exposed to
1-h OGD 1 day before being subjected to 12-h OGD were
designated as the IPC+OGD group. To evaluate the role of TLR3
signaling in simulated ischemic injury, we treated a portion of the
astrocytes with 50 ng/mL neutralizing antibody against TLR3
(Ab-TLR3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit non-immune IgG
2 h before OGD. We also evaluated the protective effect of TLR3
ligand Poly I:C in astrocytes. The cells were treated with 5 or
10 mg/mL Poly I:C or Poly I:C plus 50 ng/mL Ab-TLR3 24 h
before being subjected to 12-h OGD. Cultures exposed to
normoxia served as controls.

Immunofluorescence staining of TLR3
For immunofluorescence staining, cells on coverslips were fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1%
Triton X-100 for 60 min, and then incubated with rabbit antiTLR3 polyclonal antibody (1:200; Abcam) for 2 h at room
temperature. After being washed thoroughly, the cells were
incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody for 1.5 h
at room temperature. The coverslips were washed again and
mounted onto glass microscope slides with mounting medium.
Cell staining was viewed under the fluorescence microscope
(Olympus BX-51; Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan).

ELISA assay for cytokine release
IFNb and IL-6 secreted into the culture medium were measured
with commercially available ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Absorbance at 450 nm was determined on a microplate reader.

Cell viability assay
The ability of cells to convert MTT into formazan is an
indication of mitochondrial integrity and activity, which acts as a
surrogate for cell viability [37]. Briefly, MTT was added to cells at
a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. After 4-h incubation at 37uC,
the blue reaction product, formazan, was dissolved by 100 mL of
DMSO. The absorbance value at 570 nm was determined with a
microplate reader. Results are expressed as percentages of control
values. Cell viability was measured in triplicate for each
experimental condition.

Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as mean 6 SD. The statistical analyses
were carried out by one-way ANOVA with SPSS for Windows
(Version 18.0). Ranked data of neurologic deficit were analyzed by
the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test. Differences were considered significant at p,0.05.

Results

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay

IPC attenuates MCAO-induced infarct volume and
reduces neurologic deficits in mice

Cytotoxicity after OGD was determined by measuring LDH
released into the culture medium with a Cytotoxicity Detection
Kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) as described previously [38].
Absorbance at 492 nm was determined on a microplate reader.
LDH values were normalized to the mean maximal LDH value in
sister cultures continuously exposed to 0.1% Triton X-100, which
produces near-complete glial cell death (100%) [39]. LDH release
was measured in triplicate for each experimental condition.

IPC alone caused no brain infarct injury and no signs of
neurologic deficit (data not shown). Compared with mice that did
not undergo IPC, those that underwent IPC before MCAO had
smaller infarct volumes in the ipsilateral hemisphere (Figure 1A,
B). Mice that received IPC also had lower neurologic deficit scores
than did those that did not undergo preconditioning before
MCAO (p,0.05; Fig.1C).

Protein extraction and Western blot analysis for TLR3,
TRIF, phosphorylated IRF3 (pIRF3), and phosphorylatedNFkB p65 (p-NFkB p65)

Expression of TLR3 after IPC
Expression levels of TLR3 and GFAP in preconditioned mice
were upregulated at 12 and 24 h after IPC compared with those in
sham-operated animals (Figure 2A, B). Additionally, TLR3
immunoreactivity colocalized with GFAP-positive astrocytes
(Figure 2C-H). In the brain cortex, TLR3 expression was
significantly elevated in GFAP-positive astrocytes at 24 h after
IPC compared with that after the sham procedure.

Astrocyte cultures were washed with ice-cold phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), and the proteins were extracted with
80 mL of lysis buffer. For pIRF3 and p-NFkB p65 protein
extraction, the lysis buffer contained a mix of protease and
phosphorylated protease inhibitors. Protein concentration in each
sample was determined according to the Bradford method, with

alone significantly increased TLR3 expression compared with that
of the normoxia group. TLR3 expression was elevated even more
after 12-h OGD, regardless of preconditioning. Although IPC
significantly increased the expression of TLR3, it did not alter the
expression of TRIF or pIRF3 compared with that in the normoxia
group (Figure 4C, D). Twelve hours of OGD had no effect on
TRIF and caused a slight, but non-significant, decrease in pIRF3.
However, the IPC+OGD group exhibited significant increases in
TRIF and pIRF3 expression compared with that in the OGD-only
group (Figure 4C, D). These data indicate that TLR3 expression is
induced quickly by IPC and that IPC prior to OGD can promote
TRIF and pIRF3 expression during subsequent OGD injury.

IPC protects cultured astrocytes against OGD-induced
injury
Cell cultures were composed of more than 95% astrocytes, as
identified by a comparison of GFAP-positive and DAPI-positive
cells (Figure 3A). Sublethal 1-h OGD (IPC) followed by 24 h of
reperfusion had no effect on cell viability as determined by MTT
assay (IPC: 92.468.7%, control: 98.468.2%; p.0.05; Figure 3B).
However, exposure of astrocytes to 12-h OGD significantly
decreased viability compared with that of the normoxia group
(61.665.1%, p,0.05). Subjecting cultured astrocytes to IPC 24 h
before 12-h OGD resulted in a significant increase in cell viability
compared with that in the OGD group (89.3611.3%, p,0.05;
Figure 3B). LDH release, another indicator of cell toxicity,
confirmed the protective effect of IPC. Sublethal 1-h OGD
followed by 24 h of reperfusion had no effect on LDH release
compared with that in the normoxia group (23.464.0% vs.
21.363.0%, respectively, p.0.05; Figure 3C). In contrast, 12-h
OGD significantly increased LDH release to 50.062.5% (p,0.05
vs. control). Subjecting cultured astrocytes to IPC 24 h before 12-h
OGD significantly reduced LDH release compared with that in
the OGD group (28.162.2%, p,0.05). These results suggest that
IPC protects astrocytes against OGD-induced cell injury.

IPC prevents upregulation of p-NFkB p65 protein
expression in cultured astrocytes after simulated
ischemia
Activation of NFkB protein is associated with pro-inflammatory
responses. Using Western blots, we examined p-NFkB p65 protein
levels in the different groups (Figure 4E). IPC alone did not alter pNFkB p65 expression compared with that of the normoxia group,
but 12-h OGD significantly increased p-NFkB p65 expression in
astrocytes. Exposure of astrocytes to IPC prevented the OGDinduced increase in p-NFkB p65 expression.

alone and lethal OGD exposure each dramatically enhanced
TLR3 expression in astrocytes, suggesting that TLR3 signaling is
activated during IPC and that pre-activation of TLR3 in
astrocytes may contribute to neuroprotection induced by IPC.
Despite upregulation of TLR3 protein, expression of neither TRIF
nor pIRF3 was changed after IPC alone or lethal OGD alone. In
contrast, both proteins were increased in the IPC+OGD group,
suggesting that transient ischemia primes the pathway for a later
upregulation of TRIF and pIRF3 during a lethal ischemic insult.
This mobilized adaptation of TLR3 prior to ischemia may activate
TRIF and pIRF3 signaling and then increase IFNb release during
subsequent ischemia. Indeed, Marsh et al. [24] reported that mice
lacking TRIF/IRF3 were not protected by exogenous lipopolysaccharide preconditioning in an in vivo stroke model.
It has been demonstrated that NF-kB activation plays a critical
role in the response to cerebral ischemic injury [16,17]. Activation
of NF-kB produces pro-inflammatory factors and aggravates
neurologic impairments [8] Thus, inhibition of NF-kB strongly
protects against cerebral ischemia. Our results revealed downregulation of TLR4 downstream signaling molecule pNF-kB and
decreased levels of IL-6 when IPC preceded 12-h OGD,
suggesting that the protective effects of IPC in ischemic astrocytes
are also mediated by downregulation of the NF-kB signaling
pathway. Relatively high expression of TLR3 may ensure that IPC
induces protection in astrocytes by enhancing signaling via the
TRIF/IRF3 pathway and thus suppressing signaling via the NFkB pathway. It has been shown that sublethal preconditioning
induces expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b,
TNF-a, and IL-6 [44], which can significantly induce TLR3
expression in astrocytes [23]. In our study, we observed a slight
increase in IL-6 after IPC in astrocytes. The release of small
amounts of cytokines from cells may partly contribute to TLR3
signal activation during preconditioning and then induce expression of a range of neuroprotective mediators. It has been reported
previously that several downstream products of IRF3, such as
TRIM30-a, negatively regulate the NF-kB signaling pathway [45].
However, the exact molecular mechanisms by which TRIF and
IRF3 mediate downregulation of the NF-kB pathway require
further study.
Poly I:C activation of TLR3, which signals through a TRIFdependent pathway, induces expression of various neuroprotective
mediators and anti-inflammatory cytokines in human astrocytes
[23]. Borysiewicz et al. [25] reported that TLR3 ligation with Poly
I:C up to 2 mg/mL protects astrocytes against oxidative stress.
Another study reported that acute Poly I:C treatment up
to100 mg/mL significantly reduced OGD–mediated cell death in
mixed cortical cultures from mice [24]. We and others have shown
that Poly I:C preconditioning provides neuroprotection against
cerebral ischemia in vivo [46,47,48]. Here, we show that Poly I:C
also induces ischemic resistance in astrocytes. Preconditioning with
5 or 10 mg/mL Poly I:C significantly reduced OGD-induced cell
death and LDH release, increased TRIF and pIRF3 protein
expression, enhanced IFNb release, and decreased IL-6 release.
Poly I:C activation of astrocytes triggered a 2.9-fold increase in
interferon regulatory factor-1 expression [23], and Poly I:C
activation of monocytes triggered a 100-fold increase in IFNb
production [49]. We found that IFNb increased approximately
twofold over the control level after Poly I:C treatment. These
discrepancies may be the result of species specificity or differences
in sensitivity of detection methods. Because Poly I:C activates not
only TLR3 but also at least two other cytosolic receptors, MDA-5
and Rig-I [50], we confirmed involvement of TLR3 signaling in
Poly I:C-induced ischemic tolerance by using TLR3 neutralizing
antibody. Poly I:C preconditioning-induced protection may be

Poly I:C-mediated TRIF/IRF3 signaling protects against
OGD in vitro
Increased levels of TLR3, TRIF, pIRF3, and IFNb in response
to IPC followed by OGD support a possible protective mechanism
of astrocytic TLR3 signaling. This signaling may result in a TRIF/
pIRF3-mediated anti-inflammatory response. We used TLR3
ligand Poly I:C to determine whether TLR3 activation induces
protection.
At both doses tested, Poly I:C treatment 24 h before OGD
significantly reduced OGD-induced astrocyte injury as measured
by MTT and LDH assay (Figure 5A, B). Poly I: C pretreatment
significantly increased TRIF and pIRF3 expression (Figure 5C, D)
and promoted IFNb release (Figure 5E) but attenuated IL-6
secretion in ischemic astrocytes (Figure 5F). These data suggest
that TLR3 signaling may mediate protection in astrocytes.

TLR3 is required for IPC- or Poly I:C preconditioninginduced protection against simulated ischemia in
astrocytes
Increased expression of TRIF, pIRF3, and IFNb after simulated
ischemia in IPC- or Poly I:C-preconditioned astrocytes suggests
pivotal participation of TLR3 signaling in the preconditioning. To
further confirm this hypothesis, we pretreated the preconditioned
cells with anti-TLR3 neutralizing antibody. Without preconditioning, cells pretreated with anti-TLR3 neutralizing antibody and
nonspecific IgG showed similar degrees of cell injury after OGD,
as measured by MTT and LDH assay. Notably, however,
blockade of TLR3 signaling with the neutralizing antibody
reversed IPC- and Poly I:C-induced ischemic protection and
augmentation of IFNb; use of nonspecific antibody had no effect
(Figure 6A–F). These results confirm that TLR3 signaling is
involved in IPC- and Poly I:C-induced protection of astrocytes
during ischemic conditions.

Discussion
In our study, we examined the protective potential of IPC in vivo
and in vitro to clarify the role of astrocytes in IPC-induced cerebral
ischemia tolerance. Our results showed that IPC in vivo with three
brief episodes of bilateral carotid artery occlusion reduced brain
damage in a permanent focal cerebral ischemia model and that
IPC in vitro with transient 1-h OGD reduced post-injurious OGDinduced damage to astrocytes. We observed increases in astrocytic
TLR3 expression after IPC both in vivo and in vitro. Astrocyte
function is thought to be required for neuronal survival and
functional recovery after cerebral ischemia [40]. IPC-induced
protection against ischemia may be associated with preserving
astrocyte function during the post-ischemic period.
TLR3 is expressed throughout the brain, mostly on astrocytes
[12]. It is the only TLR that signals exclusively through the
MyD88-independent pathway, which activates TRIF and IRF3
and results in production of anti-inflammatory mediators such as
IFNb, IL-10, TGFb, and RANTES [41]. Most downstream
products of the MyD88-independent pathway have been shown to
protect neurons from ischemic damage. For example, direct
administration of IFNb reduced ischemic brain damage in rat and
rabbit models of ischemic stroke [13,14,42]. IFNb has already
been approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis in humans [43].
The protective effects of IFNb are associated with reduced
neutrophil infiltration and attenuated blood–brain barrier damage
[14]. To explore whether IPC-induced neuroprotection is related
to astrocytic TLR3 signaling, we examined TLR3, TRIF, and
pIRF3 protein expression in cultured ischemic astrocytes, as well
as IFNb levels in the culture medium. We found that transient IPC

Ischemia Preconditioning Activates TLR3 Signaling in Astrocytes

Figure 5. Poly I:C pretreatment reduces oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)–induced astrocyte injury. Astrocyte cultures were treated
with 5 mg/mL or 10 mg/mL Poly I:C 24 h before OGD. (A and B) Poly I:C pretreatment reduced OGD-induced astrocyte injury as measured by MTT
assay (A) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release (B). (C and D) Western blot analysis showed that Poly I:C pretreatment increased the expression of
TRIF protein (C) and pIRF3 protein (D) in astrocytes subjected to 12-h OGD. (E) ELISA showed that OGD alone significantly increased IFNb release and
that Poly I:C pretreatment increased IFNb release further. (F) ELISA showed that OGD alone significantly increased IL-6 release but that Poly I:C
pretreatment inhibited the increase in IL-6 release. Values are expressed as mean 6 SD of three independent experiments, each carried out in
triplicate; *p,0.05, **p,0.01.

Ischemia Preconditioning Activates TLR3 Signaling in Astrocytes

Figure 6. TLR3 signaling is required for ischemic preconditioning (IPC)- or Poly I:C preconditioning-induced protection in
astrocytes. (A–C) Astrocyte cultures were treated with 10 mg/mL Poly I:C plus non-immune IgG or 50 ng/mL anti-TLR3 antibody (Ab-TLR3) 24 h
before being subjected to 12-h oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). (D–F) Astrocyte cultures were exposed to IPC and treated with non-immune IgG
or 50 ng/mL Ab-TLR3 24 h before being subjected to 12-h OGD. Pretreatment of astrocyte cultures with the neutralizing antibody against TLR3
reversed IPC- and Poly I:C-induced ischemic protection and the increase in IFNb. Values are expressed as mean 6 SD of three independent
experiments, each carried out in triplicate; *p,0.05, **p,0.01, NS = not significant; LDH = lactate dehydrogenase.

related to activation of TRIF-pIRF3 signaling via TLR3 in
astrocytes, which, in turn, would enhance production of antiinflammatory cytokines in the ischemic astrocytes. Additionally,
Gesuete et al. [46] indicated that Poly I:C preconditioning might
attenuate blood–brain barrier dysfunction through induction of
IFNb.
IPC in the brain is a natural phenomenon that likely protects
against ischemic brain injury by preventing inflammation. Our
results indicate that activation of the TLR-TRIF-pIRF3 signaling
pathway in astrocytes by IPC or Poly I:C preconditioning could
contribute to the mechanism by which the post-ischemic
inflammatory response is suppressed. To the best of our
knowledge, our study is the first to show that IPC can protect

astrocytes against simulated ischemia in vitro and that the
mechanism may be related to the activation of the TLR3-TRIFIRF3 signaling pathway.
