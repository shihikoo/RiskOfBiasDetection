Background and Purpose—Loss of muscle mass and function is a severe complication in patients with stroke that contributes
to promoting physical inactivity and disability. The deleterious consequences of skeletal muscle mass loss underline the
necessity to identity the molecular mechanisms involved in skeletal muscle atrophy after cerebral ischemia.
Methods—Transient focal cerebral ischemia (60 minutes) was induced by occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery in
C57BL/6J male mice. Skeletal muscles were removed 3 days later and analyzed for the regulation of critical determinants
of muscle mass homeostasis (Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, myostatin-Smad2/3 and bone morphogenetic
protein-Smad1/5/8 signaling pathways, ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome proteolytic pathways).
Results—Cerebral ischemia induced severe sensorimotor deficits associated with muscle mass loss of the paretic limbs.
Mechanistically, cerebral ischemia repressed Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and increased expression of
key players of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (MuRF1 [muscle RING finger-1], MAFbx [muscle atrophy F-box], Musa1
[muscle ubiquitin ligase of SCF complex in atrophy-1]), together with a marked increase in myostatin expression, in both
paretic and nonparetic skeletal muscles. The Smad1/5/8 pathway was also activated.
Conclusions—Our data fit with a model in which a repression of Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and an
increase in the expression of key players of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway are critically involved in skeletal muscle
atrophy after cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia also caused an activation of bone morphogenetic protein-Smad1/5/8
signaling pathway, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms are also concomitantly activated to limit the extent of
skeletal muscle atrophy.   (Stroke. 2015;46:1673-1680. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.008574.)

L

oss of skeletal muscle mass and function is a severe complication in patients with stroke. Skeletal muscle atrophy occurs
primarily in the paretic limb, but also to a lesser extent in the nonparetic limb.1 Accordingly, cross-sectional area of type II muscle
fibers2,3 or both type I and type II muscle fibers4,5 is reduced in
patients with stroke. One major consequence of skeletal muscle
atrophy is a decrease in muscle strength and a critical deterioration of muscle function.6–8 All these factors promote physical
inactivity and disability after stroke, leading to prolonged hospitalization, prolonged weakness, and less efficient rehabilitation.
Evidence from clinical trials indicate that loss of skeletal muscle mass after stroke is because of the brain lesion and the subsequent alterations in nerve impulse from upper to lower motor
neurons.9,10 However, muscle atrophy is also attributable to nutritional deficits, commonly observed in patients with stroke,11 and
disuse atrophy because of extended phase of bed rest.12 Moreover,
a systemic inflammatory response is observed after stroke,13 as

well as the production of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α and
myostatin) by skeletal muscle,14,15 indicating that both systemic
and local inflammatory responses could also contribute to altering muscle homeostasis and promoting disability after stroke.
The harmful consequences of skeletal muscle loss after
cerebral ischemia in patients with stroke underline the necessity to identify the intracellular mechanisms triggered by cerebral ischemia in skeletal muscle. We therefore determined the
molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of skeletal
muscle mass in paretic and nonparetic limbs of mice.

1674  Stroke  June 2015
Caen University (France). Under isoflurane (1.5% in N2O/O2) anesthesia, transient focal cerebral ischemia (60 minutes) was induced
by intraluminal right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)16 in
13-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (n=8; Janvier, Le Genest SaintIsle, France). Sham C57BL/6J male mice (n=8) were subjected to
the same procedure, but the occlusive monofilament was immediately
withdrawn. Shortly after surgery and daily, the animals received 1 mL
of physiological saline to avoid dehydration. All experiments were
performed randomly and analyzed in a blind manner.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging Analyses and
Behavioral Tests

T2-weighted brain magnetic resonance images were acquired (echo
time/repetition time, 46 ms/5000 ms; number of excitation, 6; field
of view, 20 mm2; matrix, 256×192; 15 slices; thickness, 0.75 mm)
2 days after MCAO using a 7-T Pharmascan (Bruker, Ettlingen,
Germany). The delineated lesion areas were summed and multiplied
by the slice thickness to determine the infarct volume.
Hind-paw footprints were analyzed before and 2 days after surgery.
Coordination was analyzed (Rotarod test) before, 2 and 3 days after
MCAO. The maximal peak force of both forelimb and hindlimb was
assessed (grip test) before and 3 days after surgery.

Tissue Removal
Three days after the occlusion, animals were anesthetized (ketamine/
xylazine, 90 mg/kg/10 mg/kg, IP) and extensor digitorum longus, soleus, and quadriceps muscles were removed, weighted, and stored at
−80°C. Tibialis anterior muscle was also removed, weighted, mounted in embedding medium and frozen in thawing isopentane.

Immunohistomorphometry
Tibialis anterior muscles were cut (12 μm) in a cryostat (Leica CM
1950). Transverse sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and
incubated with antilaminin (1:200; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin
Fallavier, France). Fluorescent muscle fibers were visualized with a
Leica TCS-SP2 confocal scanning laser inverted microscope (LeicaMicrosystem, Heidelberg, Germany). Nuclei were counterstained
with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Approximately 200 muscle fibers per mouse were randomly selected and used for the quantification
of cross-sectional area (Image J software, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).

RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis, and Real-Time
Polymerase Chain Reaction
Total RNA extraction, synthesis of cDNA, and real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction was performed as previously described.17
The selected forward and reverse primer sequences are listed in Table
I in the online-only Data Supplement. Peptidylprolyl isomerase A and
hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase were used as reference genes.18

Protein Extraction and Immunoblotting
Protein extraction from quadriceps muscles and immunoblot analysis
were performed as previously described.17 Primary antibodies are listed in Table II in the online-only Data Supplement. α-Tubulin immunoblots were used to check for equal protein loading between samples.

Statistical Analysis
All values are expressed as mean±SEM. Statistical analyses were
performed using GraphPad PRISM 5.0 (GraphPad Software). Data
were tested for normal distribution using Shapiro–Wilk test. Data
with normal distribution were analyzed with ANOVA followed
by Tukey test. Data without normal distribution were analyzed by
Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn tests. Behavioral tests were analyzed by
repeated measures ANOVA. All remaining variables were compared
using Mann–Whitney and Wilcoxon tests. The α-level of significance
was set at 0.05.

Results
Cerebral Ischemia Induces Atrophy of Paretic
Skeletal Muscles
MCAO induced a brain lesion that affected the lateral striatum
and parietal cortex (Figure 1A). The whole brain lesion averaged 111±27 mm3 3 days after cerebral ischemia. Mice subjected to MCAO could hardly move (Figure 1B). Accordingly,
neurobehavioral scores (Figure I in the online-only Data
Supplement), motor coordination (Figure 1C), and muscle
strength (Figure 1D) were significantly impaired.
Surgery led to a decrease in body weight of Sham and
MCAO animals (Figure 2A). Cerebral ischemia induced atrophy of quadriceps, soleus, and tibialis anterior muscles of the
paretic side (Figure 2B; Figure IIA in the online-only Data
Supplement), whereas weight of nonparetic muscles remained
unchanged. Accordingly, tibialis anterior muscle fiber crosssectional area was only significantly decreased in paretic muscles (Figure 2C and 2D; Figure IIB in the online-only Data
Supplement).

Cerebral Ischemia Inhibits Akt/Mammalian Target
of Rapamycin Pathway and Increases Expression of
Critical Players of Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathways
in Paretic and Nonparetic Muscles
Muscle atrophy may originate from a decrease in protein
synthesis and increase in protein degradation. As shown in
Figure 3, cerebral ischemia downregulated the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, a crucial regulator of
skeletal muscle hypertrophy,19 as evidenced by the decrease
in phosphorylation level of AktSer473, rpS6Ser236/325, and
4E-BP1Thr37/46 (Figure 3A and 3B), in both paretic and nonparetic muscles. Total protein level of Akt, rpS6, and 4E-BP1
remained unchanged.
Expression of muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases, muscle
RING finger-1 (MuRF) and Atrogin1/muscle atrophy F-box
(MAFbx),20,21 TRAF6 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6),22 and muscle ubiquitin ligase of SCF complex in atrophy-1 (Musa1)23 were all significantly increased in
paretic and nonparetic muscles of MCAO mice (Figure 3C).
Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) is a critical determinant of
neurogenic atrophy that upregulates the expression of MuRF1
and MAFbx/atrogin-1 through an increased expression and
transcriptional activity of myogenin.24 Histone deacetylase 4
protein level remained unchanged, whereas myogenin mRNA
level was dramatically decreased in both paretic and nonparetic muscles (Figure 3D).
Autophagy plays a critical role for myofiber maintenance.25,26 Phosphorylation of Ulk1Ser757, the target residue
of mammalian target of rapamycin that prevents Ulk1 activation,27 was markedly decreased after cerebral ischemia
(Figure 4A). The increase in the mRNA level of autophagyrelated genes, Ulk1, LC3, and cathepsin L, in paretic and
nonparetic limbs, did not match a corresponding increase in
protein content (Figure 4B and 4C; Figure III in the onlineonly Data Supplement). Atg5, Atg4b, and cathepsin B mRNA
level, as well as the protein content of Atg13 and Atg5–Atg12
protein complex, remained unchanged (Figure 4B and 4C and
Figure IIIA in the online-only Data Supplement).

Expression of Neuromuscular Junction Proteins
After Cerebral Ischemia
To further delineate the mechanisms potentially involved in
the atrophy of paretic muscles, we hypothesized that cerebral ischemia could alter the expression of neuromuscular
junction proteins. However, mRNA levels of α- (Chrna1)

and δ-subunits (Chrnd) of acetylcholine receptor remained
unchanged after cerebral ischemia (Figure 5A). Similarly,
MusK mRNA level and rapsyn protein content, required for
the maintenance of synaptic structure and aggregation of
postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors, respectively,28 remained
unchanged (Figure 5A and 5B).

Cerebral Ischemia Increases Myostatin mRNA
Level and Upregulates BMP Signaling Pathway
A local inflammatory response could promote atrophy of paretic
skeletal muscle. The analysis of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6,
interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α protein content in skeletal muscle did not show any significant change after cerebral ischemia (Figure IVA in the online-only Data Supplement). However,
we cannot exclude the possibility that the inherent variance of such
measurements may have masked some minor changes. Serum
tumor necrosis factor-α concentration also remained unchanged
(Figure IVB in the online-only Data Supplement).
Myostatin is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass29,30
that signals through the activin type 2 receptors (Acvr2a

and Acvr2b) and activin type 1 receptors (Acvr1b/Alk4 and
Tgfbr1/Alk5) to phosphorylate Smad2 and Smad3 proteins.31
Although transcript levels of Acvr2b and Alk5 remained
unchanged, myostatin and Alk4 mRNA levels were markedly
increased in both paretic and nonparetic muscles (Figure 6A).
Surprisingly, Smad2/3 phosphorylation was decreased in skeletal muscles of MCAO mice (Figure 6B).
BMP-Smad1/5/8 signaling pathway is an important positive regulator of skeletal muscle mass23,32 that counteracts the
myostatin-Smad2/3 pathway. BMPs bind to dedicated BMP
receptors (Alk3, Alk6) that in turn phosphorylate Smad1/5/8
proteins. Although cerebral ischemia did not alter the expression of BMP1 and BMP receptors (Bmpr2 and Bmpr1a;

Discussion
Skeletal muscle atrophy was observed 3 days after cerebral
ischemia in paretic limb, whereas muscle mass remained
unchanged in nonparetic limb. Previous studies indicate that
muscle atrophy is consistently observed both in paretic and
nonparetic limbs later after cerebral ischemia (7 days).33–35
Therefore, atrophy of paretic skeletal muscles could be an
early event that will be followed by the atrophy of nonparetic
muscles. Importantly, muscle mass is restored within 21 days
in mouse models of stroke,36–38 which indicates that muscle
atrophy is also a transient event that is rapidly followed by
the stimulation of recovery processes. This markedly contrasts with reports in human studies where muscle mass loss is
observed several months after the onset of stroke (>6 months).1
Mechanistically, skeletal muscle atrophy involved a downregulation of Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway and
an increase in the expression of E3-ubiquitin ligases MuRF1,
MAFbx/Atrogin1, and Musa1. Importantly, these molecular adaptations were also observed in the nonparetic muscle.
Whether these molecular events in nonparetic muscles will
trigger atrophy later is currently unknown, but this is strongly
suggested by the observation that muscle atrophy of both limbs
is consistently found 7 days after cerebral ischemia.33–35
Autophagy plays a critical role for myofiber maintenance
and its activation is necessary to avoid the accumulation
of dysfunctional organelles and toxic proteins that would
lead to muscle atrophy and weakness.25,26 von Walden et al8
recently reported that cerebral ischemia was associated with
a decreased expression of several autophagy-related genes in
human, suggesting that a defect in autophagy could impair
muscle fiber maintenance. Although we cannot preclude that

the reported increase in mRNA level will be sustained later
by an increase in protein level, our data do not provide any
conclusive evidence of an alteration in autophagy-lysosome
pathway 3 days after cerebral ischemia.
The observation that muscle mass loss is only found in
paretic muscles strongly suggests the existence of specific
mechanisms that may accelerate the onset of atrophy in
paretic muscles. Atrophy of paretic skeletal muscles could
thus be attributed to the alteration in nerve impulse from
upper to lower motor neurons.2,39 Furthermore, muscle denervation is well known to induce skeletal muscle atrophy40,41 and
to alter the expression of neuromuscular junction proteins.42
However, our data showed no change in the expression of neuromuscular junction proteins. Similarly, expression of histone
deacetylase 4 and myogenin, critical determinants of neurogenic atrophy,24,43 remained unchanged (histone deacetylase 4)
or even decreased (myogenin) after cerebral ischemia. Further
studies are essential to determine the molecular mechanisms
involved in the alteration of nerve impulse transmission in the
acute phase of stroke.
Other factors may also contribute to trigger molecular
adaptations in skeletal muscle including disuse, malnutrition,
and inflammation. Springer et al34 recently assayed locomotor activity in response to cerebral ischemia and reported a

significant increase in locomotor movement 3 days after
MCAO, suggesting that disuse may not be a major factor
involved in skeletal muscle atrophy. In the same study, a transient decrease in food intake was also reported, whereas Sham
animals did not experience malnutrition. Therefore, strokeassociated malnutrition could contribute to muscle loss.
However, Choe et al35 reported that MCAO induced a greater
muscle mass loss compared with Sham pair-fed rats, indicating that cerebral ischemia exerts hypophagia-independent
effect on muscle mass loss.
Myostatin is a master negative regulator of skeletal muscle
mass.44 In agreement with studies in mouse34 and human,15
mRNA level of myostatin and Acvr1b (Alk4) were increased
by ≈2-fold in skeletal muscles of both paretic and nonparetic
limbs, clearly identifying myostatin as a critical regulator of
skeletal muscle mass after stroke and a potential target for a
therapeutic intervention aimed at limiting muscle mass loss
after stroke. Surprisingly, Smad2/3 phosphorylation was also
markedly decreased in both paretic and nonparetic muscles.
However, extensive activation of myostatin signaling has
been shown to trigger the expression of Smad7,45 which in
turn represses Smad2/3 phosphorylation.46 Such a mechanism
could thus limit the extent of skeletal muscle atrophy and
increase the recovery process after cerebral ischemia.

Activation of BMP signaling prevents excessive muscle mass loss in response to denervation and fasting.23,32
Accordingly, this pathway was activated in response to cerebral ischemia. The activation of BMP signaling pathway as a
compensatory mechanism to limit the extent of muscle mass
loss is also in agreement with the observation that complete
recovery of skeletal muscle mass is observed 21 days after
cerebral ischemia.36 The molecular mechanism underlying the
antiatrophic action of the BMP signaling pathway involves
the downregulation of Musa1 expression31 and the inhibition
of myogenin transcriptional activity on MuRF1 and Atrogin1/
MAFbx promoters.32 In the present study, our data clearly
indicate that other regulatory influences may counteract BMP
signaling to increase the expression of MuRF1, Atrogin1/
MAFbx, and Musa1.
In conclusion, our study identified for the first time that
Akt/ mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, Smad signaling pathways, as well as ubiquitin-proteasome dependent
proteolysis are critical determinants of the regulation of skeletal muscle mass after cerebral ischemia. Preventing muscle
atrophy after stroke through targeted therapeutic interventions is an important outcome to restore physical capacity and
mobility, thus ultimately improving poststroke recovery and
patients’ life quality.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
Supplemental methods
Behavioral tests
Irwin screen. The evaluation of neurobehavioral and physiological state of mice
(consciousness, alertness, muscle tone, posture and gait, motor control and coordination,
seeking behavior, ptosis and stereotypies including head movements, chewing, and sniffing)
was assessed according to the Irwin screen1 before surgery and every day after surgery.

Enzyme assay
Cathepsin B+L activities were fluorometrically measured (λexc=380 nm and λem=460 nm)
by following the hydrolysis of specific fluorogenic substrates. The assay was started by the
addition of 10 mM Z-Phe-Arg-AMC (Bachem, I-1160).
Luminex analysis
Interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-6, Interferon-γ and TNF-α were assessed on serum samples and
skeletal muscle using a multiplex-assay (Luminex IS 100 system) as described by the
manufacturer (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France).
