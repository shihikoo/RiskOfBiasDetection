High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an endogenous danger signal molecule. In the postischemic brain,
HMGB1 is massively released during acute damaging process and triggers inﬂammatory processes. Moreover, it has been reported HMGB1 augments the proinﬂammatory effect of LPS by direct interaction. In
previous studies, the authors showed intranasally delivered a HMGB1 binding heptamer peptide (HBHP;
HMSKPVQ) has robust neuroprotective effects in the ischemic brain after middle cerebral artery occlusion and that it exerts an anti-inﬂammatory effect. In the present study, the authors investigated whether
HBHP suppresses the augmentation of the proinﬂammatory effect of LPS by HMGB1. In primary microglial
cultures, low doses of LPS (5 ng/ml) and recombinant HMGB1 (rHMGB1, 20 ng/ml) synergistically activated microglial cells, and HMGB1–LPS binding was detected. In addition, synergistic NO accumulation
along with direct HMGB1–LPS binding was also observed when primary microglial cultures were treated
with LPS (5 ng/ml) and HMGB1 accumulated in NMDA-conditioned medium (NCM). Co-treatment of
microglial cells with HBHP and LPS or rHMGB1 (NCM), or treatment with rHMGB1 or NCM and LPS after
pre-incubating rHMGB1 (or NCM) with HBHP markedly suppressed their synergistic activation. Furthermore, interactions between rHMGB1 and LPS or between HMGB1 in NCM and LPS were suppressed
dose-dependently by HBHP, indicating that HBHP suppressed the synergism between HMGB1 and LPS
and the underlying mechanism involved inhibition of HMGB1–LPS binding. Together these results show
HBHP has anti-inﬂammatory effects, and that it inhibits synergism caused by the binding of HMGB1 and
LPS.

1. Introduction
High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an endogenous danger
signal molecule and an inducer of inﬂammation, and is released by
necrotic cells or actively secreted by macrophages and monocytes
into the extracellular milieu [1,2]. When released extracellularly,

HMGB1 upregulates inﬂammatory cytokines, such as, IL-1␤, IL-6,
and TNF-␣, which lead to the activations of various immune-related
cells, including microglia in brain [2–4]. In accordance with these
observations, high plasma levels of HMGB1 have been reported to
be correlated with disease severity in various pathological conditions, including sepsis [5], pancreatitis [6], and stroke [4].
It has been reported HMGB1 interacts with various molecules,
including LPS [7,8], IL-1␤ [9,10], ssDNA [11], CpG-ODN [12], and
peptidoglycan [7] and that the resulting complexes augment
inﬂammatory response by binding with appropriate receptors. For
example, complexes containing HMGB1 and IL-1␤ induce the productions of proinﬂammatory cytokines, such as, TNF␣, IL-6, and

as described previously [4]. Dissociated cortical cells were plated
at a density of ﬁve hemispheres per 24-well plate (4 × 105 cells
per well), plates were coated beforehand with poly-D-lysine
(100 ␮g/ml)- and laminin (100 ␮g/ml). Cultures were maintained
without antibiotics in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 5% horse serum. At 6 days
in vitro (DIV), when astrocytes had reached conﬂuence underneath
neurons, cytosine arabinofuranoside (ara-C) was added to a ﬁnal
concentration of 10 ␮M and cultures were maintained for a further
2 days to halt microglial growth. FBS and glutamine were not supplemented from DIV 6 and media were changed twice weekly after
DIV 8. Cultures were used at DIV 13–15.
2.2. NMDA-conditioned media (NCM) preparation
Primary cortical cells were treated with serum-free MEM containing 150 ␮M of NMDA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min and
cultured in fresh medium for 24 h, Medium was then collected
and concentrated to 40 ␮l using a Centricon 10 (Pall Life Sciences,
Port Washington, NY). This concentration is referred to as NMDAconditioned medium (NCM, x1).
2.3. Primary microglia culture

Fig. 1. HBHP inhibited synergy between HMGB1 and LPS.
(A) LPS (1, 2, or 5 ng/ml) was pre-incubated with 10 or 20 ng/ml of recombinant
HMGB1 (rHMGB1) for 16 h at 4 ◦ C, and primary microglia cultures were treated with
the complex so formed. (B) LPS (5 ng/ml) was pre-incubated with 10 or 20 ng/ml of
rHMGB1 in the presence or absence of HBHP (10, 50, or 100 ng/ml) or of scrambled
HBHP (HBHP-sc) for 16 h at 4 ◦ C, and primary microglia cultures were treated with
this complex for 24 h. (C) Primary microglia cultures were co-treated with HBHP (50
or 100 ng/ml) and LPS (5 ng/ml), HBHP (50 or 100 ng/ml) and rHMGB1 (20 ng/ml), or
HBHP (50 or 100 ng/ml), LPS (5 ng/ml), and rHMGB1 (20 ng/ml) for 24 h. (A–C) NO
production was measured using a Griess assay. Data are presented as means ± SEMs
(n = 5∼6). † p < 0.05, ‡ p < 0.01 versus the LPS-only-treated control and **p < 0.01 versus

IL-8, and the production of MMP-3 via IL-1R in synovial ﬁbroblasts [10]. Furthermore, it has been reported that LPS and HMGB1
synergistically induce the production of NO in mouse peritoneal
macrophages [7] and HMGB1 transfers LPS to CD14 and activates
MAPKs (JNK and p38) and NF-kB signaling through TLR4 and RAGE
ligand [7,8].
A number of heptamer peptides that binds to HMGB1 A box
were identiﬁed in a ligand screening study using a phage-displayed
heptapeptide library [13]. In a previous study, we found that
a HMGB1-binding heptamer peptide (HBHP) with the sequence
HMSKPVQ directly bound to HMGB1 under cell free conditions and
in N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-conditioned media (NCM), and
exerted a neuroprotective effect in the postischemic rat brain, that
is, it suppressed infarct formation in the rat brain after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and ameliorated neurological deﬁcits
[14]. Subsequently, HBHP was found to confer anti-inﬂammatory
effects in primary microglia cultures [15]. In the present study, we
investigated whether HBHP suppresses the synergism shown by
HMGB1 and LPS and what is the mechanism involved.

Cells dissociated from the cerebral hemispheres of 1 day old
postnatal rat brains (Sprague–Dawley strain) were seeded at a density of 1.2 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium
(DMEM; Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan,
UT) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) in a T-75 ﬂask (SPL
Life Sciences, Pocheon, Korea). Two weeks later, microglia were
detached by mild shaking and ﬁltered through a cell strainer (BD
Falcon, Bedford, MA) to remove astrocytes. After centrifugation
(1000 × g) for 5 min, cells were resuspended in fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and plated at a ﬁnal
density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well on a 24 multi-well culture plate. After
2 h, the medium was changed for DMEM containing 5% FBS and
500 ␮M B27 supplement (Gibco).
2.4. NO assay
Primary microglia cells (1.5 × 105 ) were seeded in 24-well plates
and 1 day later treated with LPS, recombinant HMGB1 (rHMGB1),
or NCM. To measure the amount of NO produced, 50 ␮l of culture
medium was mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent (0.5%
sulfanilamide, 0.05% N-naphthylene-diamine-H-chloride, and 2.5%
H3 PO4 ) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Absorbances
of mixture were measured at 550 nm using a microplate reader.
NaNO2 standards were used to calculate NO2 − concentrations.
2.5. siRNA Transfection

2. Materials and methods

Cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells per well in
24-well plates. All transfections were performed using oligofectamine (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as a carrier. SMART pool siRNA,
speciﬁcally targeting HMGB1 (ON-TARGET plus SMART pool siRNA
L-114889, accession no. NM 001109373; Dharmacon, Lafayette,
CO), and non-speciﬁc siRNA (on-TARGET plus Non-targeting pool
D-001810, Dharmacon) were used. Transient transfections were
carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. siRNA and
lipid complexes were added to the wells of 96-well culture plates
to ﬁnal concentration of 40 pM siRNA and 1.8 ␮l oligofectamine.

Fig. 2. Synergistic NO induction in primary microglial cultures by LPS and HMGB1 in NCM.
(A) NMDA-conditioned media (NCM) was collected from primary cortical cultures at 24 h after NMDA treatment (150 ␮M, 30 min). Primary microglia cultures were treated
with NCM for 24 h in the presence of 1, 2, or 5 ng/ml LPS. (B) Primary microglia cultures were incubated with NCM for 24 h in the presence of 5 ng/ml of LPS, which had been
pre-incubated with HMGB1 A box, HMGB1 B box, or anti-HMGB1 antibody for 6 h. (C) HMGB1 levels were determined in whole cell lysates and in culture media of primary
cortical cultures 24 h after transfection with HMGB1 siRNA (HMGB1− ) or nonspeciﬁc (NS− ) siRNA (40 pM) by immunoblotting. (D) NCM was collected from primary cortical
cultures transfected with HMGB1 siRNA or non-speciﬁc siRNA and added to primary microglial cultures for 24 h in the presence of 2 ng/ml LPS. (A,B,D) NO production was
measured using a Griess assay. Data are presented as means ± SEMs. **p < 0.01.

with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h, membranes were incubated with
primary antibodies diluted 1:1000 for anti-HMGB1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-␣-tubulin (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-CD14
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-LPS (Abcam)
overnight at 4 ◦ C. The next day, membranes were detected using
a chemiluminescence kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) using antirabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology).
2.7. Immunoprecipitation-linked immunoblotting
Total lysates containing 500–1000 ␮g of protein or conditioned culture medium were immunoprecipitated with 1 ␮g of
anti-HMGB1 polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 4 ◦ C
overnight. Pre-equilibrated protein G PLUS-Agarose beads (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were then added and incubated
for 2 h at 4 ◦ C on a rotating wheel. Bead-bound complexes were
pelleted, washed several times with lysis buffer, boiled at 99 ◦ C in
SDS sample buffer for 5 min, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western
blotted.
2.8. Biotinylated pull-down assay
To investigate LPS to HMGB1 binding, a pull-down assay was
performed using 20 ␮l of streptavidin agarose beads (50% slurry)
(Pierce, Rockford, IL) and pull-down complexes were separated by
14% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Biotin-tagged LPS
(1 or 5 ␮g/ml) was incubated with recombinant HMGB1 (HMGbiotech, Milano, Italy) in the presence or absence of HBHP (1 or
5 ␮g/ml) at 4 ◦ C for 6 h with rotation, and the biotin complexes
obtained were incubated with streptavidin beads for 1 h at 4 ◦ C with
rotation, centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 1 min, and Western blotted.
2.9. Statistical analysis
Two-sample comparisons were performed using the Student’s
t test, and multiple comparisons were made by one-way or two-

way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc testing to
compare selected pairs of data.
3. Results
3.1. HBHP inhibited synergistic NO induction by rHMGB1 and LPS
in primary microglial cultures
To examine the synergism between LPS and rHMGB1, primary
microglia cultures were treated with low dose LPS (1, 2, or 5 ng/ml)
which had been pre-incubated with 10 or 20 ng/ml of rHMGB1 for
16 h at 4 ◦ C. NO induction was negligible when primary microglia
cultures were treated with 10 or 20 ng/ml of rHMGB1 (Fig. 1A).
However, when they were co-treated with LPS, NO induction was
enhanced in a rHMGB1 dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). When
HBHP (10, 50, or 100 ng/ml) was co-treated with LPS (5 ng/ml)
and rHMGB1 (10 or 20 ng/ml), NO induction by rHMGB1/LPS was
signiﬁcantly suppressed by 10 ng/ml of HBHP and to be further
suppressed by 100 ng/ml of HBHP (Fig. 1B). However, it was not suppressed by HBHP-sc (PMQSKHV) containing a scrambled sequence
of the amino acids in HBHP (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, HBHP has
no effect on LPS-only- or rHMGB1-only-induced NO induction
(Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that HBHP suppressed the synergistic activation of primary microglia cultures by rHMGB1 and
LPS.
3.2. Synergistic NO induction by HMGB1 in NMDA-conditioned
media (NCM) and LPS in primary microglial cultures
To conﬁrm that endogenous HMGB1, released after NMDAinduced neuronal death [14,16], is capable of synergistically
enhancing LPS-induced inﬂammation, we examined NO production
after treating primary microglia cultures with LPS and NMDAconditioned medium (NCM). NCM-alone was unable to induce
NO production, but NO production was markedly increased by
adding LPS (Fig. 2A). In particular, with 2 ng/ml of LPS, NO production was increased to 1.7 fold by co-treating NCM (Fig. 2A).
Moreover, when concentrated NCM collected from 2 plates (x2)

Fig. 3. HBHP inhibited the synergistic NO induction in primary microglial cultures
by LPS and HMGB1 in NCM.
(A) Primary microglia cultures were incubated with 5 ng/ml LPS and NCM preincubated with HBHP (50, 100, or 200 ng/ml) or with HBHP-sc (200 ng/ml) for 6 h. (B)
Primary microglia cultures were incubated with 5 ng/ml LPS and NCM pre-incubated
with Hpep1 (100 or 500 ng/ml), Hpep6 (100 or 500 ng/ml), or Hpep3 (500 ng/ml) for
6 h. NO production was measured 24 h later using a Griess assay (A,B). (C) Primary
microglial cultures (1.5 × 105 cells/well) were incubated with biotinylated LPS (btLPS; 1 ␮g/ml) and NCM for 6 h in the presence of HBHP (1 or 5 ␮g/ml) or HBHP-sc
(5 ␮g/ml). Culture media were collected at indicated times and HMGB1–LPS complex was precipitated using streptavidin beads and analyzed by immunoblotting
using anti-HMGB1 and anti-LPS antibodies. Results are representative of three independent experiments. Data are presented as means ± SEMs. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

was used, NO production increased to 2.4 fold (Fig. 2A). However, synergistic NO induction by NCM plus LPS was abrogated by
treating NCM after pre-incubating it with HMGB1 A box or antiHMGB1 antibody (Fig. 2B), indicating that the HMGB1 in NCM
participated in the synergistic NO induction by LPS and NCM. In
addition, this synergism was not detected when NCM collected
from HMGB1 siRNA-transfected primary cortical cultures was used
but was detected when NCM from non-speciﬁc siRNA-transfected
cultures was used (Figs. 2C and D). These results show that HMGB1,
released from neurons after excitotoxic damage, synergistically
enhanced LPS-mediated microglial activation.
HBHP suppressed synergistic NO induction by HMGB1 in NCM
and LPS in primary microglial cultures via inhibiting HMGB1–LPS
binding
Synergistic activation of microglia by LPS and HMGB1 (in NCM)
was also signiﬁcantly suppressed by pre-incubating cells with
HBHP (100 or 200 ng/ml) to 80.4 ± 5.8% and 66.4 ± 12.2 (n = 3,
p < 0.01), respectively, however, HBHP-sc failed to suppressed NO
induction (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, HMGB1 peptide 1 or 6 (Hpep1
or -6), which have been shown to bind LPS [17], suppressed this
synergistic induction of NO (Fig. 3B). To determine whether HBHP
inhibits binding between HMGB1 and LPS, pull-down assay was
conducted by using biotin-tagged LPS (bt-LPS). Immunoblotting
using anti-HMGB1 antibody showed that HMGB1/LPS bindings

Fig. 4. HBHP inhibited the interaction between HMGB1 and LPS
(A,B) Primary microglial cultures (1.5 × 105 cells/well) were incubated with LPS
(100 ng/ml) for 6, 12, or 24 h. Culture media were collected at indicated times and
incubated with anti-HMGB1 antibody at 4 ◦ C overnight. HMGB1–LPS complex was
precipitated using protein-G agarose beads and analyzed by immunoblotting using
anti-HMGB1 and anti-LPS antibodies (A). Levels of HMGB1 in cell lysate and culture
medium were determined by immunoblotting (B). (C) Primary microglial cultures
(1.5 × 105 cells/well) were incubated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 24 h in the presence
or absence of HBHP (100 or 500 ng/ml) or HBHP-sc (500 ng/ml). HMGB1–LPS interaction and levels of HMGB1 in culture medium were determined by co-ip assay and
immunoblotting, respectively.

were signiﬁcantly inhibited dose-dependently by HBHP but not by
HBHP-sc (Fig. 3C). These ﬁndings indicate that HBHP inhibits the
synergistic effects of HMGB1 and LPS on microglia activation and
inhibition of LPS–HMGB1 binding might be an underlying mechanism.
3.3. HBHP inhibited HMGB1–LPS binding in LPS-treated primary
microglia cultures
To further conﬁrm the inhibition of HMGB1–LPS binding by
HBHP in more physiological context, we examined HMGB1–LPS
interaction in the culture media of LPS-treated primary microglia. In
a previous study, we showed that HMGB1 was accumulated in the
culture media of LPS-treated primary microglia [18]. We found that
HMGB1 secreted in LPS-treated culture media made a complex with
LPS remained in culture media (Fig. 4A). Binding between HMGB1
and LPS, as evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation, was detected as
early as 6 h after LPS (100 ng/ml) treatment and gradually increased
to peak at 24 h after LPS treatment (Fig. 4A), which parallels with
the levels of HMGB1 secreted and accumulated in culture media
(Fig. 4B). HMGB1 levels in LPS-treated microglia culture media
gradually increased up to 24 h but HMGB1 levels in cell lysates
gradually decreased (Fig. 4B). As was expected, the HMGB1 to LPS
binding was suppressed by co-treating LPS with HBHP but not with
HBHP-sc (Fig. 4C). These results further conﬁrm that HBHP exerts
its anti-inﬂammatory effects by inhibiting HMGB1/LPS binding.
4. Discussion
It has been reported that HMGB1 has two LPS-binding motifs.
One is BBXB (B: any basic aa, X: any hydrophobic aa) which are
located in two HMG domains, A box (sequences 7–10) and B box
(sequences 86–90). The B box domain harbors another LPS-binding

44

motif (BZB motif; B: any basic aa, Z: aromatic ring-containing aa)
at sequences 86–90 [17]. Youn et al. (2011) [17] synthesized 12
peptides (Hpeps) from the HMGB1 and showed that Hpep1 and
Hpep6 bind to LPS and thus inhibit HMGB1 to LPS binding. In
a previous study, we showed that HBHP interacts with HMGB1,
especially HMGB1 A box [15]. Here, we demonstrate that HBHP
inhibits HMGB to LPS binding and occluding the LPS binding site on
HMGB1 A box might be an underlying mechanism. Although further study is needed to elucidate the exact contact point between
HMGB1 and HBHP, it might be localized near Hpep1 [17], which
harbors amino acids 3–15 in HMGB1 A box. However, we do not
exclude the possibility that different sites are also involved in
HBHP-HMGB1 binding or that speciﬁc interactions depend on cell
and/or activating stimulus type. Furthermore, since relationship
between differential modiﬁcations of HMGB1 and its functions
have been reported [19,20], these modiﬁcations might affect the
interaction between HMGB1 and HBHP.
In the present study, we showed that rHMGB1 and HMGB1
in NCM binds to LPS and that these complexes augmented
LPS-induced microglia activation in primary microglia cultures.
Furthermore we also demonstrated that LPS interacts with HMGB1
secreted in LPS-treated microglia culture media. Together all these
observations support the relevance of the HMGB1–LPS interaction
in various pathological conditions. It is interesting to note here
that a massive HMGB1 release (secretion) and subsequent infection can be observed in various disease conditions. For example, in
the postischemic brain, HMGB1 is massively released by acute damage, and it then exacerbates neuronal damage by triggering delayed
inﬂammatory processes [4]. HBHP not only confers a robust neuroprotective effect in the postischemic brain as it had been reported
[14] but it might also be able to ameliorate subsequent damage
in the case of post-stroke infection by suppressing HMGB1–LPS
binding. Post-traumatic, post-epileptic, and even chronic inﬂammation represents similar conditions, and thus, a HBHP-mediated
LPS-neutralization strategy could be possibly used to treat these
pathological conditions.
Considering that HMGB1 is known to interact with numerous
proinﬂammatory ligands, such as, CpG-ODN, peptidoglycan (PGN),
Pam3CSK4, Beclin 1, and IL-1␤, it is possible HBHP also affects interactions between HMGB1 and these molecules. These interactions
could occur in extracellular space as for PGN [7], or in cytoplasm
in the cases of CpG-ODN [12] and Beclin 1 [21]. Although HBHP
might interact mainly with extracellular HMGB1, it is possible that
HBHP penetrates the cell membrane and interacts with intracellular HMGB1. However, different modiﬁcations of HMGB1 in different
subcellular localizations might affect its interactions with HBHP. All
these possibilities need further study.
In conclusion, HBHP was found to exert its anti-inﬂammatory
effects by inhibiting binding between HMGB1 and LPS. Furthermore, HBHP also conferred neuroprotective effects by direct
binding to extracellular HMGB1, which is released from damaged
neuron and augments LPS-induced microglia activation. Further
studies are needed to identify the HBHP binding site of HMGB1.
