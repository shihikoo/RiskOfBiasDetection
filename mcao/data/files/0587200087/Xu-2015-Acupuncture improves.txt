Stroke is the major cause of long-term disability among adults. Recent studies have found that GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission plays a vital role in ameliorate locomotor damage after ischemic injury.
Acupuncture has been widely used to improve locomotor function. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The present study is designed to investigate whether GABA and GABA receptors
are involved in the mechanism underlying acupuncture treatment in rats with middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO). One week after acupuncture at JiaJi acupoint, the locomotor function and infarct volumes were tested. Then level of GABA and the expressions of GABAA ␥2 and GABAB R2 were assessed
by high-performance liquid chromatography, immunoﬂuorescence and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Compared with normal group, GABAA ␥2 and GABAB R2 expressions were decreased in striatum and
spinal cord of the MCAO group. After acupuncture, the expressions of the two receptors were increased,
but levels of GABA and trafﬁcking protein, kinesin binding 1 (TRAK1), which plays a role in the intracellular transport of GABA receptors, were unchanged. The present study suggests that acupuncture could
reverse locomotor function by modulating the expressions of GABA receptors in MCAO rats.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the major cause of long-term disability among adults
[1], and more than 50% of survivors have residual sensorimotor
deﬁcits [2]. According to statistics performed by World Health
Organization (WHO), 30.7 million people experienced stroke [3].
Recent studies have revealed that the enhancement of GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission could ameliorate ischemic brain
damage [4,5]. It is well known that ␥-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is

a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system,
and its physiological roles in both the dorsal and ventral horn of the
spinal cord (SP) are well documented [6]. Furthermore, drugs that
modulate GABA have been found to exert neuroprotective effect
in the striatum following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
[7].
Acupuncture is one of the leading modalities of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Throughout the history of China, acupuncture
has been widely used to ameliorate a variety of conditions, including stroke and other neurological disorders [8]. As recorded in
ancient literature, Huang Di Nei Jing, the clinical application of
acupuncture for stroke could be traced back over 3000 years. Moreover, acupuncture is now recommended by the WHO as one of
the alternative and complementary strategies for stroke treatment.

acupuncture faces a big challenge to be accepted by mainstream
medicine. It is that there is no scientiﬁcally accepted mechanism
for how this treatment works. Researches in rodents have now provided some biochemical explanations that some experts are ﬁnding
more persuasive [9]. Furthermore, study in rats has proven that
there is low skin resistance points (LSRP) located on the governor
vessel (GV) and the conception vessel (CV), so that rodents have
meridian phenomenon [10]. In this study, we examined whether
GABA and GABA receptors are involved in mechanism underlying the effect of acupuncture on locomotor function in the SP and
striatum (STR) of MCAO rats.

2.4. Corner test
This test was performed one day prior to surgery and on days
1, 3, 6 and 9 after surgery. The details of surgical procedure have
been described in our previous studies [12]. Each rat was allowed to
proceed into a corner, the angle of which was 30 degrees. To exit the
corner, the rat could turn either to the left or to the right, and this
choice was recorded. This procedure was repeated 20 times with at
least 30 s between trials, and the percentage of right turns was calculated. Only turns that involved full rearing along either wall were
included. The rats were not picked up immediately after each turn
to ensure that they did not develop an aversion to their prepotent
turning response. The ipsilateral turn score (TS) was calculated as
follows:
TS =

ipsilateral turns
× 100%
total turns

2. Methods

2.5. Cylinder test

2.1. Animals

The forelimb used during exploratory activity was analyzed in a
transparent cylinder (20 cm in diameter and 30 cm in height, RWD
Life Science Co., Ltd., China) based on 20 movements over 10 min.
To prevent habituation to the cylinder, the number of explorative
movements recorded in any one trial was limited to 16. After the
rat was placed in the cylinder, the forelimb used in the ﬁrst contact with the wall after rearing and during lateral exploration was
recorded according to the criteria detailed in a previous study [12].
The wall contacts were classiﬁed as contacting by the contralateral
forelimb (CF), ipsilateral forelimb (IF), or both forelimbs (BF). The
asymmetry score (AS) was calculated as follows:

Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 270–300 g were purchased from Vital River Laboratories (Beijing, China) and housed
in cages with food and water available ad libitum. The animals
were maintained at a temperature of 23 ± 1 ◦ C on a 12 h light–dark
cycle. All of the experiments were performed in accordance with
the guidelines for the care and use of mammals in neuroscience and
behavioral research and were approved by the local Committee of
Ethics on animal experiments. The rats were randomly divided into
three experimental groups (n = 30/group): a normal group (Gn), an
impaired group (Gi, model only), and an acupuncture group (Ga,
model with acupuncture treatment).

2.2. Animal surgery
2.6. Infarct assessment
In brief, after making a ventral cervical midline incision, a
12-mm silicon-coated nylon ﬁlament was introduced over the
right common carotid artery and the internal carotid artery
into the circle of Willis to block the origin of the middle
cerebral artery. The body temperature was controlled throughout the entire procedure, and 3.5% chloral hydrate (1 ml/100 g)
was used for anesthesia. The neurologic ﬁndings were scored
on a ﬁve-point scale [11]. Excluding the rats that did not
meet the criteria, we counted 60 rats with neurologic deﬁcits.
%infarct = 100

After the behavioral tests, six rats from each group were decapitated, and their brains were rapidly removed. The infarct volumes
were measured by staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Amresco, USA). The brains were cut into 2-mm-thick
coronal sections, and ﬁve slices were stained with 2% TTC solution
for 30 min at 37 ◦ C and then immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde
overnight. The volumes of the infarcts were computed according
to the following formula:

[area of contralateral cortex − (area of ipsilateral cortex − area of infarct cortex)]
area of contralateral cortex
2.7. Radioimmunoassay (RIA)

Rats that were subjected to surgery were then randomized into the
Gi and Ga groups with 30 rats in each.
2.3. Acupuncture treatment
The locations of the acupoints are shown in Table 1. Treatments
A and B were used alternately over seven days. One-off sterile
13 mm long acupuncture needles (Huatuo, Suzhou Medical Instruments Factory, China) with a diameter of 0.14 mm were used in
this experiment. After sterilization with iodine, the needles were
inserted horizontally 2–3 mm into JiaJi (EX-B2) and rotated clockwise two to three times per second for 30 s. The remaining two

The concentration of ␤-endorphin was measured using
commercially available radioimmunoassay kits following the manufacturer’s instructions (Beijing Huaying Biotechnology Research
Institute). Fifty microliters of perfusate were added to plastic tubes
containing 100 mg of silic acid (70–325 Mesh, Merck) and incubated for 20 min at 4 ◦ C with vortexing every 5 min. The suspension
was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was
decanted. The detection limit was 6 pg/100 ␮l. The recovery of
immunoreactivity calculated based on extraction using 125 I added
to the samples was 85–87%. The intra- and inter- assay coefﬁcients
of variation were 11% and 16%, respectively.

2.8. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
The STR and SP were separated, weighed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. HPLC was used to determine the GABA level. The
apparatus used was a Agilent 1200 LC (Santa Clara, USA) HPLC
instrument, equipped with a 5 ␮m ZORBAX Eclipse AAA column
(4.6 mm × 150 mm, Agilent, USA). The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with
phosphate. The velocity of ﬂow was 0.8 mL/min and the column
temperature was 40 ◦ C.

2.9. Histological analyses
The rats were deeply anesthetized with chloral hydrate and
intracardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS
(USB, Afﬁmetrix, Santa Clara, CA) at a rate of 25 ml/min. Organs
were removed, postﬁxed overnight at 4 ◦ C in PFA, equilibrated in
30% sucrose at 4 ◦ C and shock-frozen at −80 ◦ C. The brain and STR
were serially sectioned at 40 and 35 ␮m on a freezing microtome
(SAKURA, 4583), respectively. The slides were then incubated with
GABABR2 antibody (1:150, Millipore, AB5394) in 0.3% PBST and

3% serum overnight at 4 ◦ C. Slides were rinsed with PBS and incubated with the biotinylated secondary antibody against mouse IgG
(1:500, Jackson Immuno-Research, 99499) for 3 h at room temperature. 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma, Germany) was used
as chromogen. The regions of interest were photographed under
brightﬁeld optics using an Olympus BX51 microscope.
For immunoﬂuorescence, slides were washed with PBS and
incubated with GABAA ␥2 antibody (1:150, Proteintech, 14104-1AP) in 0.3% PBST and 3% serum overnight at 4 ◦ C. Slides of the brain
and SP were then incubated with Daylight 488-conjugated goat
antibody to rabbit IgG (1:100 and 1:80, Beijing Kangwei, CW0164)
in 0.3% PBST and 3% serum for 2 h at room temperature. After washing three times in PBS, the slides were mounted with OLYMPUS
DP72 and analyzed with the image pro plus (IPP) software.

2.10. Western blot
Western blot was performed as previously described [13] with
minor modiﬁcations. The protein concentration was determined
using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method. Primary antibodies for

in Fig. 1, infarct volumes in the MCAO group were 35.44% ± 5.83%.
In contrast, administration of acupuncture signiﬁcantly reduced
infarct volume to 15.11% ± 4.2% (P < 0.05).

2.11. Statistical analyses
All of the data were presented as the means ± standard errors
(SE). The behavioral data were analyzed through t-test. The other
data were analyzed using one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA)
(SPSS 13.0), and the differences between groups were assessed with
least signiﬁcant difference (LSD) post-hoc tests. The data were considered statistically signiﬁcant when the P value was below 0.05.

3.2. Effect of acupuncture on ˇ-endorphin concentration
As shown in Fig. 2, RIA analysis revealed that MCAO induced
an increase concentration of activated ␤-endorphin in STR compared with Gn group (P < 0.01). However, there was no signiﬁcant
difference in SP between Gn and Gi groups. Acupuncture increased
␤-endorphin concentrations in STR and SP compared with those in
Gn and Gi group (P < 0.01).

3.3. Effect of acupuncture on GABA receptor expression
We found that GABA level was signiﬁcantly decreased following
MCAO. However, there was no signiﬁcant difference between Gi
and Ga groups (Fig. 2). As shown in Figs. 3 and 4 , GABAA ␥2 and
GABAB R2 expressions in STR and SP were signiﬁcantly reduced in

of these two GABA receptors were signiﬁcantly increased (P < 0.01).

3.4. Effect of acupuncture on TRAK1 expression
Western blot analysis revealed that there were no signiﬁcant
differences in TRAK1 expression following MCAO surgery and that
acupuncture treatment also failed to alter the expression of this
protein (Fig. 5).

4. Discussion
Our previous study have indicated that MCAO rats showed a
behavior deﬁcit compare to normal rats in corner test and cylinder test, and showed increased peripheral muscle resistance on
day 9 after MCAO [12]. The infarcts assessment and behavioral
tests revealed that acupuncture had positive effect on ischemic
injuries, especially on day 6 and 9 after surgery. Thus, we selected
9 days after the induction of permanent MCAO as the time point to
study mechanism of acupuncture on locomotor function during the

subacute stage of stroke. Our results suggest that acupuncture
alters the expressions of ␤-endorphin, GABAA ␥2 and GABAB R2 in
STR and SP of MCAO rats; however, the GABA level exhibited no
change.
It has been reported that the dynamic balance between neuronal
excitation and inhibition in brain is critical for the maintenance
of normal brain function. A considerable body of evidence from
both in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the excessive
release of excitatory amino acids is one of the principal pathological mechanisms of ischemic brain damage [14,15]. Recent
reports have demonstrated that increasing GABAergic synaptic
transmission may exert neuroprotective effect in brain ischemia
by counteracting the toxicity of excitatory amino acids [16,17].
Opioid receptors also disinhibited globus pallidus by decreasing
GABA level [18]. Accordingly,  and ı receptor agonists stimulated
locomotion when injected into STR [19]. GABA and endorphins are
both released from the same subset of neurons in the striatum
but appear to play opposite roles in the maintenance of locomotor output. In our study, we found that the concentration of
␤-endorphin increased and that the GABA level deceased significantly in STR after MCAO. Furthermore, acupuncture increased
␤-endorphin concentration but did not decrease GABA level. This
result may be due to the fact that dopamine (DA) release in the STR
could evoke the release of both GABA and endorphins primarily
through dopamine D1 receptors that are presumably located on the
presynaptic terminals of striatopallidal neurons [20]. Additionally,
endorphins participate in signaling by inhibiting GABA and disinhibiting DA in the STR to sustain locomotion [21]. Because DA plays
an important role in the regulation of the GABA and endorphin
systems, the role of the DA-GABA-endorphin relationship in the
effect of acupuncture on the control of locomotor function requires
further research.
Inhibition in the brain is predominantly mediated by GABA
through the activation of GABAA receptors and GABAB receptors. In

2003, Jolkkonen et al. found that the GABA receptor binding densities were decreased in ischemic rats and that there were a number
of correlations between behavior and receptor binding densities in
ischemic rats [22]. Indeed, GABA agonists can have neuroprotective effect against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity via enhancing
GABA receptors [23]. GABA could regulate the excitability of spinal
motor neurons through GABAA and GABAB receptors [24]. It has
been reported that TRAK1 mutations disrupted GABAA receptor
homeostasis in hypertonic mice [25]. The present study found that
acupuncture treatment reversed the changes in the expressions of
GABAA ␥2 and GABAB R2. However, the TRAK1 expression exhibited no signiﬁcant changes following MCAO surgery or acupuncture
treatment. These results suggest that GABA receptor activation is at
least partially involved in the mechanism through which acupuncture treatment affects the locomotor functions of MCAO rats.
In conclusion, we found that acupuncture treatment, which is
a non-pharmacologic modality with minimal side effects, mitigates the motor deﬁcits that follow ischemic injury. Furthermore,
acupuncture treatment was found to exert a brain-protective effect
via the activation of GABA receptor expression. Further studies are
need to be focus on the speciﬁc effects of acupuncture for motor
deﬁcit after stroke.
