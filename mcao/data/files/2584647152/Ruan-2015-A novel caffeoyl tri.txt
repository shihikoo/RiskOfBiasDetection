Abstract
Despite the intense efforts in searching for stroke therapies, an
urgent need still exists to explore novel neuroprotective agents
for ischemic stroke that have high efﬁcacy and wide
therapeutic time-window. Here, we provide the ﬁrst demonstration that 28-O-caffeoyl betulin (B-CA), a novel derivative of
naturally occurring caffeoyl triterpene, could signiﬁcantly alleviate brain infarction and neurological deﬁcit when given as
late as 6 h after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in
the rat. Moreover, post-ischemia B-CA administration exhibited long-term (14 days post stroke) protective effects on both
brain infarction and functional (i.e., motor and sensory)
deﬁcits. Protective B-CA effects correlated with decreased
inﬂammatory responses as indicated by inhibition of microglia
and astrocyte activation [stained with ionized calcium-binding

adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1) and glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) antibody, respectively], as well as suppression of
tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-1b, and cyclooxygenase-2
overproduction in the ipsilateral cortex of ischemic rat. B-CA
administration caused signiﬁcant hypothermia in the focal
cerebral ischemic rat, which may contribute to its ameliorative
effects on brain damage and inﬂammation. In view of its
potency in wide therapeutic time-window, robust anti-inﬂammatory and hypothermic effects, this novel caffeoyl triterpene
derivative may lead toward the development of effective
therapeutic strategies for the treatment of ischemic stroke.

Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and
mortality in the world (Go et al. 2014). Currently, the only
US Food and Drug Administration-approved acute intervention for ischemic stroke is thrombolytic therapy using
recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA). Although
rt-PA treatment can provide acute recanalization and
improves functional outcome post stroke, it has a narrow
therapeutic time window of < 4.5 h post stroke with risk of

hemorrhage and may exacerbate the cerebral injury (Fonarow
et al. 2011). While on the other hand, the neuroprotective
approach has gained increasing attention and considered as a
promising alternative treatment for ischemic stroke (Schmidt

et al. 2013; Moretti et al. 2015), which may potentially offer
beneﬁt to ischemic stroke-induced injuries without causing
hemorrhage. However, few pharmacological agents have
been successfully translated to the treatment for human acute
ischemic injury, even though many neuroprotective agents
have initially appear promising in preclinical animal studies.
Therefore, it is still urgent to explore novel effective
neuroprotective agents to provide better clinical outcome
for ischemic stroke patients.
Ischemia triggers a series of pathological events in the
brain, leading to neuronal loss by apoptosis and other
mechanisms of cellular injury. Although multiple hypotheses
are currently prevalent about the complex etiology of
ischemic stroke, the inﬂammatory cascade hypothesis has
been attracting more and more attention. Increasing evidences have demonstrated the detrimental role of inﬂammation on the drastic changes after cerebral ischemia, including
the immediate damage in the infarcted brain area and longterm damage in the ischemic penumbra (Drake et al. 2011).
The early molecular cues triggered by cerebral ischemia
promote inﬂammatory signaling and aggravate brain damage,
which is characterized by an orderly sequence of events
involving the activation of glia, release of vasoactive
mediators, as well as release of proinﬂammatory cytokines
by macrophages activation (Thiel and Heiss 2011; Lambertsen et al. 2012). Moreover, recent pre-clinical studies
suggest that suppression of inﬂammation offers multiple
advantages: First, many anti-inﬂammatory agents have an
extended therapeutic window and are effective when
administered up to 6 h after ischemia insult (del Zoppo,
2010; Hawkins et al. 2014); Second, considering that
inﬂammation is particularly deleterious in ischemia associated with reperfusion (Prestigiacomo et al. 1999), suppression of inﬂammation would be a ﬁtting complement to
reperfusion therapy using thrombolytic agents. Thus, the fact
that inﬂammation is central to the pathophysiology of stroke
has raised the prospect of new anti-inﬂammation approaches
to counteract ischemic stroke.
Natural products and/or natural product structures have
been playing important roles in drug discovery and development (Harvey 2008; Newman 2008), and can sometimes
bring surprising new treatments to the pre-clinical and
clinical areas (Newman and Cragg 2012). Screening of
natural products isolated from traditional Chinese medicines
that were used for the treatment of neurological diseases
enabled identiﬁcation of certain caffeoyl triterpenoids as
potential neuroprotective agents. To investigate the structureactivity relationship and to supply enough amount of sample
for further in vivo pharmacological evaluation, a series of
caffeoyl triterpenoid derivatives were synthesized (data not
shown). Among them 28-O-caffeoyl betulin (B-CA) (Fig. 1)
has the best biological activity on oxygen–glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells and primary
cortical neurons (in vitro ischemia models) (Figure S1),

suggesting that B-CA might be an attractive therapeutic
candidate for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
Acute intervention of ischemic stroke has been hampered
by the lack of drugs with a long post-stroke therapeutic time
window for efﬁcacious intervention and the lack of drugs
with potent ameliorating effects on ischemic injury beyond
the acute phase. Moreover, assessing the therapeutic time
window and long-term efﬁcacy of drug candidate has been
included in the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) criteria for anti-ischemia drug evaluation, with
the aim of improving the quality of drug development data
and the careful progression of compounds from preclinical
evaluation to the clinic (Fisher et al., 2009). Therefore, the
following experiments were performed to evaluate: (i) shortterm and long-term neuroprotective efﬁcacy against focal
ischemic injury in the rat, (ii) the therapeutic time window
(i.e., time of efﬁcacious post-stroke intervention), and (iii)
the potential beneﬁts of B-CA on focal ischemia-induced
inﬂammatory responses and the underlying mechanisms, to
provide important information on a novel synthetic caffeoyl
triterpene derivative as a potential therapeutic agent for acute
intervention in ischemic stroke.

Material and methods
Animals
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 230–300 g were
obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center, Chinese Academy
of Sciences (Shanghai, China). All experimental procedures used in
this study followed the National Institutes of Health Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, as well as the guidelines of the
Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai Institute of Materia
Medica. The animals were housed under 12-h light–12-h dark
conditions with free access to food and water for 1 week before
pharmacological or surgery. All the animal experiments were
performed in a randomized and blinded design.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by occlusion of intraluminal
middle cerebral artery (MCAO) as described previously (Longa
et al. 1989) with minor modiﬁcation. In brief, under chloral
hydrate anesthesia (400 mg/kg, i.p.), a 4-0 surgical nylon monoﬁlament nylon suture (Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co. Ltd, Beijing,

China) was introduced into the left internal carotid artery through
the external carotid stump, advanced approximately 20 mm past
the carotid bifurcation up the internal carotid and to the Circle of
Willis until a slight resistance was felt. At this place of resistance,
the intraluminal suture blocks the origin of the middle cerebral
artery (MCA), and all sources of its blood ﬂow. The suture was left
in the place for 2 h and then was withdrawn resulting in
reperfusion of the MCA. Regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF)
was monitored by laser-Doppler ﬂowmeter (moorVMS-LDF; Moor
Instruments Limited, Axminster, UK) with the use of a ﬂexible
probe over the skull. After obtaining a baseline of pre-ischemic
rCBF, the MCA was occluded and rCBF was monitored continuously during ischemia with a criterion of < 25% of baseline blood
ﬂow remaining after MCA occlusion. Sham-operated rats were
manipulated in the same way, but the MCA was not occluded. The
body temperature of each rat was maintained at 37  0.5°C with a
heating pad throughout the surgical procedure. The rats were then
returned to their home cages after the surgery (room temperature
was constantly maintained on 24–26°C). A total of 245 rats were
included in the study. Data are reported on 169 rats, while 76 rats
were excluded from the study due to death or failing to meet the
criteria of rCBF decline induced by MCA occlusion. Equal
numbers of rats were randomly assigned to vehicle-treated group
and B-CA-treated groups after MCAO surgery.
B-CA drug treatment
B-CA (Fig. 1) was provided by Prof. Wei Min Zhao in the
chemistry department at Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica,
Chinese Academy of Sciences. B-CA was dissolved in a solvent
with dimethylsulfoxide (1%, v/v), Cremaphor EL (5%, v/v, SigmaAldrich) and diluted with saline, then administered intraperitoneally.
In our preliminary study, B-CA treatment showed a good dose–
effect relationship on MCAO model, with 10 and 30 mg/kg doses
resulted in better outcome as compared with lower doses (1 and
3 mg/kg) (data not shown). Therefore, this study was ﬁrst designed
to verify the neuroprotective effect of B-CA at both doses (10 and
30 mg/kg). Then, 30 mg/kg dose was administered in the rest
experiments in this study according to the stronger and longer
hypothermic effect (Figure S2). Vehicle-treated rats were always
used for comparisons. In the short-term efﬁcacy evaluations, MCAO
was performed at day 1 (D1) and rats received a single B-CA
injection at 1, 2, 4, or 7 h after reperfusion (i.e., 3, 4, 6, and 9 h after
focal ischemia onset). In long-term efﬁcacy evaluation, B-CA was
delivered at 3 h after focal ischemia in rat, and then brain injury was
assessed at 14 days post stroke (D14). The body temperature of rats
was recorded prior to and immediately after ischemia surgery hourly
for 12 h in all groups, using a rectal temperature probe.
Assessment of neurological function
Neurological deﬁcit was evaluated by the modiﬁed neurological
severity score (mNSS). The mNSS was used to grade neurologic
deﬁcits including motor, visual and tactile responses, proprioception, performance on a balance beam, reﬂex responses, and
abnormal movements (scale: 0–18; normal score, 0; maximal deﬁcit
score, 18); thus, the composite score reﬂects combined motor,
sensory, and reﬂex functions (Chen et al. 2001). At 24 h after the
onset of reperfusion, rats were evaluated according to the guideline
of mNSS.

Measurement of cerebral infarct volume by triphenyltetrazolium
chloride staining
After the assessment of neurological function, rats were decapitated
and the brains were rapidly removed. Each brain was cut into six
coronal sections equably (2 mm thick per section) and then stained
with 2% triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sinophar Chemical
Reagent Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China) for 15 min quickly in a 37°C
chamber away from light. Sections were ﬁxed in paraformaldehyde
solution (4%) for 24 h before digital images were taken. The infarct
volume was determined as the slice thickness times the sum of
infarct area in all brain slices. The formula used to calculate the
area of
infarct area was as follows: (area of normal hemisphere
non-infarcted ischemic hemisphere)/area of normal hemisphere 9 100%.
Nissl staining
Rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate as above and perfused
transcardially with isotonic saline followed by 4% phosphatebuffered paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and post-ﬁxed in
the same solution at 4°C overnight and then immersed in 30%
sucrose solution overnight. Frozen brain sections (40 lm thick)
were made by a cryostat (SM2000R; LEICA, Nussloch, Germany).
The serial coronal sections were immersed for 5 min in each of the
following solutions: 100% xylene, 100% xylene, 100% ethanol,
100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, and 70% ethanol. The sections were
dipped in distilled water and stained in 0.5% cresyl violet for
30 min. Then, they were differentiated in water for 5 min,
dehydrated through 70% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 100% ethanol, and
100% ethanol, cleared in xylene, and then mounted. The infarct
volume was estimated by the same formula as TTC staining.
Immunofluorescence staining
Coronal sections at the level of bregma approximating 1.8 to
0.36 mm were used for immunoﬂuorescence staining. Freeﬂoating sections (20 lm) were incubated at 4°C overnight with
primary antibodies: Iba-1 (1 : 200; Wako Pure Chemical Industries
Ltd, Osaka, Japan), GFAP (1 : 200; Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA), or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (1 : 50; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Sections were washed with
tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (T-TBS) and then
processed using anti-mouse or anti-goat ﬂuorescent secondary
antibody (1 : 500; Jackson Immuno-Research, West Grove, PA,
USA) for 1 h at 24–26°C. The sections were viewed and
photographed using a laser confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan). During image acquisition, the threshold and gain on the
confocal laser microscope were set using the control.
Measurement of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6)
For inﬂammatory cytokines measurement, cortexes were homogenized using a ultrasound sonicator in an ice-cold Radio-Immunoprecipitation Assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40,
0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mM
sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM sodium ﬂuoride, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, P8340, pH 7.4). The tissue homogenates
were centrifuged with 14 000 g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatants
were then collected and stored at 80°C until further analysis.

(BMS625; eBioscience) protein levels were assessed by ELISA
kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cytokine
amounts were normalized to protein content, which was measured
by bicinchoninic acid Protein Assay Kit (23225; Thermo Scientiﬁc,
Rockford, IL, USA).
Western blot analysis
Cortexes were homogenized using an ultrasound sonicator (Vibra
Cell; Sonics & Materials Inc., Danbury, CT, USA) on ice. The
supernatants were collected and followed by protein concentration
determination using bicinchoninic acid Protein Assay Kit (23225;
Thermo Scientiﬁc). Protein extracts were separated by 10% sodium
dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Maidstone, Kent, UK). The
membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in T-TBS and
incubated with speciﬁc antibodies for COX-2 (1 : 1000; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). The membranes were washed with T-TBS and then
processed using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody (1 : 5000; Kangchen Biotechnology, Shanghai, China),
then the membranes were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA)
according to the instructions of manufacture and visualized with
autoradiography ﬁlm. The intensity of each band was quantiﬁed
with Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).

B-CA protects against acute ischemia-induced brain
infarction and functional deficits
We examined whether post-treatment with B-CA could
inﬂuence neurological functional outcome after ischemic
injury. B-CA was administered intraperitoneally at 3 h after
the onset of ischemia when the monoﬁlament was already
removed to allow reperfusion for 1 h. Infarction was
determined by the appearance of a white region after TTC
staining at 24 h of reperfusion (Fig. 2a). Remarkably, B-CA
treatment reduced the infarct volume by 30.5% (p < 0.01)
and 31.9% (p < 0.001) at 10 and 30 mg/kg doses, respectively (Fig. 2b). Consistent with protection from infarct area,
rats post treated with B-CA at 10 and 30 mg/kg showed a
signiﬁcant improvement in the neurological scores at 24 h
after reperfusion (Fig. 2c, p < 0.01, p < 0.001 vs vehicletreated MCAO group, respectively).
Prolonged therapeutic time window of B-CA in transient
focal ischemia
To evaluate the therapeutic time window of B-CA, a single
dose of B-CA was administered at increasing time intervals
after transient ischemic insult (Fig. 3a). Protective effect of

B-CA was signiﬁcant up to 6 h post-stroke onset in the
transient ischemia rat model, showing the similar reduction
trends in infarct volume. B-CA post-administration effectively reduced the infarct volume to 21.9% (p < 0.05 vs
vehicle-treated MCAO group) and 21.4% (p < 0.05 vs
vehicle-treated MCAO group) for 4 and 6 h post treatment
after acute ischemic insult, respectively (Fig. 3b). However,
when B-CA was administered at 9 h after the onset of
ischemia, no signiﬁcant beneﬁt was observed as compared
with vehicle-treated MCAO group (Fig. 3b). Similar significant ameliorative effects of B-CA at either 4 or 6 h post
treatment after stroke were also demonstrated on neurological dysfunction (Fig. 3c, p < 0.001 and p < 0.05 vs vehicletreated MCAO groups, for 4 and 6 h post treatment,
respectively).
Long-term benefit of B-CA post-ischemia treatment in
transient focal ischemia
The neuroprotective effects of B-CA were apparent even at
14 days after MCAO onset. Rats received vehicle or B-CA
(30 mg/kg, i.p.) at 3 h after the onset of ischemia. Histological brain damage was evaluated by Nissl staining at 14 days
post ischemia. The brain sections from vehicle-treated
MCAO rats exhibited a consistent necrotic lesion both in
cortical and subcortical regions of the ipsilateral hemisphere
(Fig. 4a). Infarct volumes were signiﬁcantly decreased by BCA treatment (Fig. 4b, p < 0.05 vs vehicle-treated MCAO
group), and the deﬁcit of neurological function was ameliorated at all the post-ischemia time points observed (for 14day duration), with 1-day, 3-day, and 14-day time points
showed statistical differences (Fig. 4c, p < 0.05 vs vehicletreated MCAO group). In addition, the survival rate of BCA-treated MCAO group was about 30% higher than that of
vehicle-treated MCAO group at the end point in this study
(Figure S3). These results suggest that B-CA post treatment
has a long-term beneﬁcial effect on reducing brain infarct
volume and improving behavioral outcome of the ischemic
rats.

considered as resident immunocompetent and phagocytic
cells in the central nervous system, which are also rapidly
occurring cellular response to cerebral ischemia. To evaluate
whether B-CA post treatment could inﬂuence MCAOinduced glial activation, we immunolabeled the glial cells
with the microglia and astrocyte marker – Iba-1 and GFAP,
and counted ﬂuorescent intensities of positive cells in the
penumbra area of the ischemic brain cortex (Fig. 5a). The
ﬂuorescent intensities of microglia and astrocyte cells that
positively reacted to Iba-1 and GFAP were markedly
increased in the ipsilateral cortex of MCAO rats (Fig. 5b).
As compared to that in vehicle-treated MCAO rats, decrease
of Iba-1 (Fig. 5c, p < 0.05 vs vehicle-treated MCAO group)
and GFAP (Fig. 5c, p < 0.05 vs vehicle-treated MCAO
group) immunoreactivity was found in the ipsilateral cortex
of B-CA-treated MCAO rats, while the contralateral side in
B-CA-treated MCAO rats showed the similar ﬂuorescent
signal following ischemic injury as compared with vehicletreated MCAO rats (Fig. 5b and c). These results suggest that
B-CA could inhibit the activation of both microglia and
astrocyte induced by cerebral ischemia.

B-CA inhibited overproduction of TNF-a, IL-1b, and COX-2
in the post-ischemic brain
Activated glia would synthesize and release inﬂammatory
mediators and cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-1b (Lai and
Todd 2006). In this study, we detected the changes of above
inﬂammatory cytokines in the rat cortex by ELISA kits.
MCAO caused a prominent increase of TNF-a (Fig. 6a,
p < 0.01 vs sham group) and IL-1b (Fig. 6b, p < 0.001 vs
sham group) in the ipsilateral cortex at 24 h of reperfusion,
while B-CA treatment greatly reduced the levels of TNF-a
(Fig. 6a, p < 0.05) and IL-1b (Fig. 6b, p < 0.05) as compared with the vehicle-treated MCAO rats. Although a
similar trend in reduction was found in the level of IL-6, no
statistical differences were found after B-CA administration
(Fig. 6c). The unilateral up-regulation of COX-2, an enzyme
implicated in post-ischemic inﬂammation through the production of toxic prostanoids and superoxide, is induced
during inﬂammation and participates in inﬂammationmediated cytotoxicity (Nogawa, et al, 1997). In accordance
with above inﬂammatory responses, the protein expression of
COX-2 was signiﬁcantly increased after MCAO (Fig. 6d and

markedly suppressed the over-expression of COX-2 in the
ipsilateral cortex of MCAO rats (Fig. 6d and e, p < 0.05 vs
vehicle-treated MCAO group). In contrast, there was no
signiﬁcantly inﬂammatory process in the contralateral cortex
(Fig. 6d).
Hypothermic effects of B-CA in the rats subjected to MCAO
An increasing number of experimental and clinical studies
have demonstrated the association between body temperature, inﬂammation, and stroke outcome (Reith et al. 1996;
Hemmen and Lyden 2007; Wang et al., 2002). Accumulating pre-clinical and clinical evidences also suggest that
hypothermia possesses signiﬁcant neuroprotective effects
against a variety of brain injuries including ischemic stroke.
In this study, rats usually waked from anesthesia approximately 2 h after the surgical procedures terminated. Interestingly, as compared with vehicle-treated MCAO rats, post
treatment with B-CA at 3 h (Fig. 7a,i), 4 h (Fig. 7a,ii), and
6 h (Fig. 7a,iii) after ischemia resulted in signiﬁcant lowered
body temperatures of MCAO rats. The body temperatures

dropped quickly at about 1 h after B-CA administration in all
three post-treatment groups (Fig. 7a), and then this hypothermic effect would last for nearly 4 h and then gradually
returned to the baseline temperature. Moreover, the body
temperature of rats of the vehicle-treated MCAO groups rose
up to a level of hyperthermia (above 38°C) (Fig. 7a). The
average body temperatures before MCAO surgery and at the
onset of reperfusion were about 36°C (Fig. 7b,i) and 34°C
(Fig. 7b,ii), respectively. No signiﬁcant differences were
found between vehicle-treated and B-CA-treated MCAO
groups at both time points (Fig. 7b).

Discussion
One of the signiﬁcant ﬁndings in this study is the potential
wide and clinically useful therapeutic time window of a
novel caffeoyl triterpene, B-CA. As one of the major
problems in ischemic stroke treatment is the delayed patient
presentation, promising therapeutic strategy will be expected
to possess potent efﬁcacies by post-intervention. We found
that B-CA was highly efﬁcacious in protecting against brain

ischemic damage when administered as late as 6 h after the
onset of brain focal ischemia in rat (Fig. 3). Moreover, longterm efﬁcacy of B-CA on brain ischemic injuries was also
demonstrated as an add-on and promising proﬁle (Fig. 4).
Given that many neuroprotective agents failed in clinical
trials because of a narrow therapeutic time window after
stroke onset, the promising therapeutic time window and
long-term neuroprotection demonstrated in our study suggest
that B-CA is a promising neuroprotective candidate for acute
intervention in ischemic stroke.
Besides the beneﬁcial effects on neurological scores and
brain infarction, B-CA at 30 mg/kg showed protective
effects on neuronal numbers and synaptic protein postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) expression in MCAO rats. As
compared to that in vehicle-treated MCAO rats, increase of
Nissl staining was found in the ipsilateral cortex of B-CAtreated MCAO rats (Figure S4a). Similarly, the ipsilateral
side of vehicle-treated MCAO rats showed signiﬁcant downregulation of PSD-95 expression at 24 h after reperfusion,
while B-CA administration could restore this decrease
signiﬁcantly (Figure S4b). Taken together the reduced
mortality of B-CA-treated MCAO group (Figure S3), above
ﬁndings on neuronal damage may further strengthen the
beneﬁcial role of B-CA on ischemia. However, further

assessments will be needed to comprehensively determine
the inﬂuence of B-CA on neuronal function.
Activation of inﬂammatory cells results in inﬂammation
in the necrotic tissue, which are important in promoting
brain inﬂammation by producing and secreting inﬂammatory mediators such as cytokines and clearing away dead
tissue after cerebral ischemia. Such inﬂammatory factors are
accumulated up to dozens folds, exacerbating neuronal
damage and neurovascular injury during stroke (Lambertsen
et al. 2012). Furthermore, inﬂammatory cytokines may not
only contribute to neuronal death but also might inﬂuence
the therapeutic window for systemic thrombolysis and act
on symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage during thrombolysis (Tobinick et al. 2012). Therefore, combating inﬂammation is a promising strategy for treatment of ischemic
stroke associated with severe neuroinﬂammation. In agreement with previous ﬁndings, we demonstrated the significant microglia activation and astrocyte proliferation, as
well as the over-production of proinﬂammatory cytokines
during the subacute stage after brain ischemia. Interestingly,
above inﬂammatory responses were markedly inhibited by
post-ischemia administration of B-CA, these strong inhibition effects on inﬂammatory reactions may effectively
contribute to the ameliorative effect of B-CA on brain

Anti-inflammatory and hypothermic effects of B-CA

infarction and neurological functional deﬁcits in the MCAO
rats.
Although there is currently no promising pharmacotherapy
for ischemic stroke aside from rt-PA treatment, therapeutic
hypothermia has been shown to improve neurological
outcome in animal models of both focal and global ischemia
for decades (Yanamoto et al. 1999; Meloni et al. 2009), and
is one of the most extensively studied and powerful
neuroprotective strategies for the treatment of acute ischemic
stroke (Chang and Marshall 2012; Yenari and Han 2012; Wu
and Grotta 2013). Moreover, recent studies show that
therapeutic hypothermia also has strong effects on the
inﬂammatory response (Kawamura et al. 2006; Gu et al.
2014). Besides the potent anti-inﬂammatory effects of B-CA,
another exciting ﬁnding in our study is that B-CA administration can induce a moderate hypothermia (Fig. 7) in the
MCAO rats. This hypothermic effect of B-CA seems not to
be only limited to the MCAO rats, as B-CA administration
could also induce similar effect on lowering body temperature of normal rats (Figure S2). In this study, the B-CAinduced hypothermia happened concurrently with the ameliorated effects on brain damage and neurological dysfunction. It will be therefore of great interesting to clarify the
relationship between the fact of B-CA in reducing the body
temperature and the signiﬁcant pharmacological effect of BCA in rat ischemic lesion, as well as the molecular
mechanisms contribute to the hypothermic effect of B-CA.
Previous studies have indicated that many receptors
(Zhang et al. 2013) or ion channels (Wetsel 2011) may
possess thermoregulatory effect, among them TRPV1 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member
1) channel is attracting increasing attention. TRPV1 plays a
thermoregulatory role and expresses mainly on a subset of
sensory neurons in the peripheral and central nervous system,
and TRPV1 activation might induce hypothermia (Gavva
2008) and ameliorate the injuries induced by ischemic insult
(Khatibi et al. 2011; Muzzi et al. 2012; Cao et al. 2014).
Interestingly, our preliminary in vivo experiment observed
that the reduction in the infarct area resulting from B-CA
treatment was nearly reversed when the hypothermic effect
was effectively inhibited by TRPV1 antagonist AMG517
(data not shown). Moreover, we have also assessed the
inﬂuence of B-CA on extracellular regulated protein kinases
(ERK) signaling and matrix metallopeptidase 9, two important signaling pathways involved in the detrimental effect of
cerebral ischemic insult (Wu et al. 2000; Kelly et al. 2008;
Maddahi and Edvinsson 2010; Chaturvedi and Kaczmarek
2014). Our preliminary study indicated that MCAO-induced
up-regulation of ERK phosphorylation and matrix metallopeptidase 9 may be ameliorated by B-CA post treatment,
which was similar to the inﬂuence of hypothermia treatment
(Horstmann et al. 2003, 2009; Hamann et al. 2004). Above
results provide important clues for the association between
hypothermic effect of B-CA and its protective effect against

101

brain infarction, and also suggest that TRPV1 signaling may
be involved in the B-CA induced hypothermic effect.
Considerable studies have demonstrated that hypothermia
results in reduced inﬂammatory cell inﬁltrate, less microglia
activation, and reduction of a variety of inﬂammatory
mediators, inﬂammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, and
arachidonic acid metabolites (Leon 2004; Yenari and Han
2006; Kasdorf and Perlman 2013). Moreover, studies have
also indicated that inhibiting various aspects of this immune
response by brain cooling can have beneﬁcial effects on
neurological outcome following ischemic injury (Deng et al.
2003; Gu et al. 2014). In addition, hypothermia has been
reported to suppress inﬂammatory responses through ERK
inactivation in the brain (Schmitt et al. 2007; Whittington
et al. 2013), while B-CA treatment may effectively inhibit
the ERK over-phosphorylation in the MCAO rats. Taken
together, the hypothermic effect induced by B-CA may
contribute to its suppression of the ischemia stimulated
inﬂammatory responses in the rats. However, further research
will be necessary for shedding light on the molecular
mechanisms behind B-CA-induced hypothermia and antiinﬂammatory effect in the cerebral ischemic injury, and it is
also worthy to explore the neuroprotective effects of B-CA
independent of its hypothermic effect.
In this study, B-CA at administered doses (10 and 30 mg/
kg) did not cause signiﬁcant side effects except hypothermic
effect, which was detected systematically and disappeared
6 h after B-CA administration. Moreover, the contralateral
side in B-CA-treated MCAO rats showed the same Nissl
staining signal as compared with vehicle-treated MCAO rats
(Figure S4), which indicates that B-CA administration at
30 mg/kg may not exert harmful effect on neuronal numbers
under normal situation. Above results indicate that B-CA at
30 mg/kg did not cause signiﬁcant harmful effects on the
rats; however, further studies will be needed to systematically judge the safety of B-CA. As a conclusion, we
documented for the ﬁrst time that B-CA, a novel caffeoyl
triterpene, confers signiﬁcant neuroprotection with a wide
and clinically useful therapeutic time window against
ischemic stroke, correlating with the anti-inﬂammatory and
hypothermic effects. Thus, this novel caffeoyl triterpene
derivative may provide new clues for the development of
novel effective strategies for the treatment of ischemic
stroke.
