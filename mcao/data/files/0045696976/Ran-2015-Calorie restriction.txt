showed the neurological function score of CR group was higher and the brain infarct
volume was markedly reduced in CR group compared to AL group at 24 h after reperfusion
(po0.05). CR increased the synthesis of SIRT1 signiﬁcantly (po0.05), and ameliorated the
down regulation of SIRT1 expression at 6 and 12 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion
(po0.05, po0.01, respectively). Knockdown of SIRT1 by siRNA in vivo reversed the
neuroprotective effect of CR. From this study, we deduce that CR induces brain ischemic

Introduction

Caloric restriction (CR) is deﬁned as approximately 30%
reduction in caloric intake, without compromising the maintenance of all essential nutrients (Redman et al., 2007). It has
been associated with increased lifespan and protection
against metabolic diseases. Earlier reports have demonstrated that a period of CR can protect the cortical and striatal
neurons from focal ischemic injury (Duan et al., 2001).
However, the mechanism of caloric restriction-induced neuroprotection is still not very clear.
Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD)-dependent deacetylase whose functions have been shown
to correlate with metabolism, gene transcription, cell division,
and cellular stress response and increased lifespan (Bordone and
Guarente, 2005). Recent studies have shown that SIRT1 is also
associated with genomic stability, energy metabolism, neurodegenerative diseases and anti-vascular endothelial cell senescence (Kumar et al., 2013; Roth and Polotsky., 2012). Ectopic
expression of SIRT1 was found to improve neuronal survival in a
mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (Tsai., 2009) and increased
SIRT1 activity was found to share its mechanism of protection
against ischemic injury with ischemic preconditioning and
resveratrol (Morris et al., 2011). These ﬁndings suggest that SIRT1
may play an important role in the neuroprotection.
The beneﬁcial effects of caloric restriction-mediated SIRT1
activation have been shown in a variety of neurodegenerative
disorders and ischemic injury (Ingram et al., 2007; Cohen
et al., 2004). Recently, CR was shown to protect against
ischemic injury in the brain and heart (Roberge et al., 2008;
Yamamoto et al., 2014). Nevertheless, there is no direct
evidence proving that SIRT1 expression changes are related
to the neuroprotection induced by CR. The purpose of this
study is to verify the protective effect of CR on focal cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion injury is mediated by SIRT1 regulation
in CR rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).

Results

Effect of CR on body weights and blood glucose level

Initial body weight before caloric restriction (0 w) was
191.3713.4 g in CR group, which had no signiﬁcant difference
from AL groups. After 2 weeks of caloric restriction, the body
weight of the rats in CR group were signiﬁcantly lower than
that in AL group (221714.3 g vs 258712.8 g mean7SE,
po0.05) and this difference kept until the end of caloric
restriction (295716.1 g vs. 337713.5 g at 28 days, po0.05)
(Table 1). The levels of blood glucose (measured 10 min before
ischemia) in AL group is 5.59370.08 and 5.48770.08 in CR
group (p ¼0.163, Fig. 1). It can eliminate the possibility role of
blood glucose in caloric restriction-induced neuroprotection.

(MCAO) for 90 min. Results showed that caloric restriction
signiﬁcantly improved neurobehavioral outcome and reduced
infarct volume after 24 h’s reperfusion. The neurological deﬁcit
score in the CR rats was signiﬁcantly higher than that in AL
group (Fig. 2C, po0.05). Moreover, the brain infarct volume in
CR rats were signiﬁcantly decreased (Fig. 2B and D) (po0.05).
The caloric restriction still could protect the brain from
ischemia/reperfusion after 7 days assessment. The neurological deﬁcit score in the CR rats was signiﬁcantly higher than
that in AL group (Fig. 3C, po0.05), and the brain infarct volume
outcomes in CR rats were smaller (Fig. 3B and D, po0.05).

Caloric restriction attenuated the reduction of SIRT1
after ischemia/reperfusion in rats
The SIRT1 protein levels in the cortex of rats were assessed by
Western blot analysis at the pre-ischemia, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h
after reperfusion in both groups. SIRT1 protein was expressed in
the brains of the rats in AL group before ischemia, while the
expression of SIRT1 in CR group was signiﬁcantly higher than
that in AL group (increased 81%). After ischemia and reperfusion,
the expressions of SIRT1 in AL group were gradually decreased
except at the ﬁrst 3 h time point (Fig. 4A and B). Although SIRT1
expressions in the CR group were also decreased after MCAO in
all time points examined, its expressions, except at 3 h after
reperfusion, were signiﬁcantly higher than that in AL group at
6 h (po0.05), 12 h (po0.01), and 24 h (po0.05) (Fig. 4A and B). The
results of double immunoﬂuorescence staining showed that the

SIRT1 protein was expressed in neurons but not in astrocytes, as
demonstrated by its co-localization with the neuronal marker
NeuN (Fig. 4C).

2.4.
Down-regulation of SIRT1 by siRNA attenuated
caloric restriction-induced neuroprotection
Intra-cerebroventricular injection of siRNA-SIRT1 was used to
knock down the SIRT1 expression to verify the role of SIRT1 in
caloric restriction-induced neuroprotective effect. Firstly the efﬁciency of gene knock down was conﬁrmed by western blot. The
protein level of SIRT1 was signiﬁcantly down-expressed by
siRNA-SIRT1, compared to either CR or CRþ scr RNA group
(po0.05 versus AL group, po0.05 versus CR group) (Fig. 5A).
Neurological function scores were assessed and infarct volumes
were measured at 24 h after reperfusion. Down regulation of
SIRT1 expression was found to reverse caloric restriction-induced
neuro-protection. The sizes of infarct volume were signiﬁcantly
lower in CRþ siRNA group than those in CRþ scr RNA as well as
CR groups (po0.05 versus AL group, po0.05 versus CR group)
(Fig. 5B), and the same for neurobehavioral score (po0.05, po0.01
versus AL group, po0.01 versus CR group, Fig. 5C).

Discussion

In current study, we studied the role of SIRT1 in the protective effect of CR on focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury

in rats. Our results showed that CR could improve the
neurobehavioral function and decrease the infarct volume
after MCAO treatment and SIRT1 expressions in CR group was
signiﬁcantly higher than that in AL group before and after
ischemia–reperfusion. The neuroprotective effect of CR was
reversed by knock down of the SIRT1 before ischemia,
suggesting that SIRT1 plays an important role in caloric
restriction-induced neuroprotection.
According to previous reports, CR improves glucose regulation, increases insulin sensitivity (Gresl et al., 2003; Roth
et al., 1995, 1999), and produces favorable changes in blood
triglyceride and lipid proﬁle (Edwards et al., 1998). Recently, it
was found that CR slows age-related alterations in the brain,
and reduces the incidence of age-associated cardiovascular
and neurodegenerative diseases (Tu et al., 2012; Mattson,
2005). A number of studies have showed that CR can protect
against ischemic injury in the heart and brain in rats. Rats
subjected to CR after chronic myocardial ischemia showed
reduction of infarct size and increase in survival (Yamamoto
et al., 2014). Short-term food restriction (40% less food over a
3-month period) was found to attenuate ischemia-induced
neuronal degeneration and improve recovery of functional
impairments following global ischemia (Roberge et al., 2008).
Our results also suggest that CR signiﬁcantly improves
behavioral outcome and reduces infarct volume 24 h after
focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion. These ﬁndings indicate
that CR can induce tolerance against brain and heart
ischemic injury. CR is believed to induce mild stress which

increases the resistance to subsequent stress response and
thus confer neuroprotection (de Cabo et al., 2003; Heydari
et al., 1996). It has been found that CR affects energy
metabolism, stress signaling pathways, and reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production (Anderson and Weindruch, 2010).
We found that there were no signiﬁcant differences in blood
glucose levels between CR group and AL group immediately
prior to MCAO, which ruled out the possibility of hyperglycemia induced neuroprotective effect.
As revealed by western blot, the decrease of SIRT1 protein
expression in CR group appeared earlier in CR group compared to
AL, but exhibited a trend of increase after 6 h after reperfusion.
As shown in Fig. 4, CR induced a nearly 2-fold expression of SIRTI
compared to AL at pre-ischemia. Although endured a greater
drop at 3 h after I/R injury, the amount of SIRT1 protein was
maintained in a higher level in later time points compared to AL
group. We speculated that SIRT1 protein is consumed more
quickly in CR group than that in AL group because animals with
CR are more used to and more sensitive in reacting to energy
deprivation (ischemia) so as to regulate transcription modiﬁcation and protein–protein interaction and promote glucose and
lipid metabolism to provide energy for the survival of neural
tissue. These results showed that although the consumption of
SIRT1 protein appears to be quicker in CR group, the production
rate was even higher. And the ischemic injury in the brain was
lessened in CR group. Albeit no statistic difference was detected
between protein expression of SIRT1 at 3 h after reperfusion and
latter time points in CR group, PCR results revealed that gene
transcription of SIRT1 was than enhanced since 6 h after

reperfusion in CR group which maintained a positive production/degradation balance in CR group that kept SIRT1 level higher
in CR group compared to AL group. Thus we postulated that the
neuroprotective effect of SIRT1 in CR group is not affected by its
decrease rate after ischemia/reperfusion, but relied on its protein
concentration in the ischemic penumbra. These results were in
accordance with previous report that higher expression of SIRTI
is protective against oxidative stress in neurons and reduced
apoptosis (Pﬁster et al., 2008; Alcendor et al., 2007).
Previous studies have shown that SIRT1 is a highly conserved enzyme whose activity is NAD-dependent. It has been
demonstrated that NADþ plays a signiﬁcant role in the positive
regulation of SIRT1 activity. The ratio of NADþ/NADH is
increased during calorie restriction, and the relatively high level
of NADþ can increase the activity of SIRT1 (Vaziri et al., 2001).
Over expression of SIRT1 was reported to improve motor
function, and reduces brain atrophy in Huntington’s disease
mice (Jiang et al., 2012). SIRT1 activation reduces ischemic
neuronal injury and down regulation of the mitochondrial
uncoupling protein 2 may be the possible mechanism (DellaMorte et al., 2009). Despite these evidences, the protective effect
of SIRT1 remains controversial. In a study using SIRT1 transgenic mice, no neuroprotection was observed against stroke
(Kakefuda et al., 2009). This could be because sustained high
levels of SIRT1 may even deplete NADþ, which could aggravate
neuronal injury (Kakefuda et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2009). Nevertheless, the up- and down-stream signaling pathways related to
SIRT1 up regulation after CR are still need to be elucidated in
future studies.

ischemia–reperfusion. Rodgers et al. reported that in liverremoved mice, absence of NADþ decreased caloric restrictioninduced SIRT1 deacetylase activity. And increased NADþ
availability induced by caloric restriction-mediated changes
in redox potential might be a major factor that stimulates
SIRT1 activity (Rodgers et al., 2005). Previous review showed
that an increase in the NADþ ratio could up-regulate SIRT1
expression and protect the heart and brain against ischemic
damage in CR animals (Morris et al., 2011). Transgenic mice
overexpressing SIRT1 displayed a number of phenotypic markers of CR mice, such as increased metabolic activity, glucose
tolerance, and reduced insulin (Bordone et al., 2007), all of
which could be regulated by SIRT1. The ﬁndings about involvement of SIRT1 in caloric restriction-induced protection in
the heart indicate that CR can improve the ischemia consequence (Yamamoto et al., 2014). From our study we further
provide evidences that CR is also effective in reducing cerebral
ischemic injury. More importantly, we demonstrated that Sirt1
plays an important role in caloric restriction-induced neuroprotection, as inhibition of SIRT1 by RNA interference after CR
abolished its neuroprotective effect. Further study is needed to
explore the downstream signaling pathway of SIRT1 in mediation of caloric restriction-induced neuroprotective effect.

Experimental procedure

4.1.

Animals and grouping

Male Sprague-Dawley rats, aged 6 weeks and weighing 180 to
200 g, were provided by the Experimental Animal Center of the
Fourth Military Medical University, China. Rats were kept in
individual cages under controlled conditions of temperature
and light (20–23 1C, 12 h light/12 h dark cycle). Rats were
randomly divided into two groups and were either given food
ad libitum (AL group) with free access to food and water, or
provided with only 60–70% food but free access to water for 4
weeks (CR group). The level of blood glucose was detected
before the focal cerebral ischemia. To elucidate the role of SIRT1
in caloric restriction-induced neuroprotection, rats were randomly assigned to the AL, CR, CRþ scrambled control RNA (scr
RNA), and CRþ siRNA groups. The experimental protocol used
in this research was approved by the Ethics Committee for the
Animal Experimentation and was conducted according to the
Guidelines for the Animal Experimentation of our institute.

4.2.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)

The rats were allowed free access to water but were fasted for
12 h before surgery. Animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal administration of 40 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium.
The right femoral artery was cannulated for sampling blood
for measurement of blood glucose concentrations. Body temperature was kept between 37.0 1C and 37.5 1C by a heating pad
during the procedure. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by
MCAO which was applied in our previous studies (Xiong et al.,
2007). Brieﬂy, the right common carotid artery and the external
carotid artery were revealed through a ventral midline neck
incision and ligated proximally. A 3-0 rounded-tip nylon
monoﬁlament suture (Ethicon nylon suture; Ethicon Inc.,

Japan) was directed into the internal carotid artery to a point
approximately 17–18 mm distal to the carotid bifurcation until
regional cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) was reduced to o16% of the
baseline level. Reperfusion was accomplished by withdrawing
the suture after 120 min of ischemia and the blood ﬂow was
restored toZ75% of baseline (Figs. 2A, 3A, 5D). The MCAO,

PaO2 and PaCO2 were maintained at physiological levels. The
CBF was monitored using laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (PeriFlux
System 5000, Perimed AB, Jarfalla, Sweden) in the ipsilateral
cortex (2 mm posterior and 5 mm lateral to bregma). Considering the possibility that the diameter of the middle cerebral
artery was smaller in the lower weight rats in CR groups, a

brain research 1610 (2015) 61–68

smaller diameter of thread tip was produced to perform MCAO
in CR group.

4.3.

Intracerebroventricular injection and siRNA treatment

Rats were placed on a stereotaxic apparatus (Narishige, Tokyo,
Japan) under the anesthesia with 10% chloral hydrate
(350 mg/kg) and the bregma point was exposed. A burr hole
was drilled into the bone of the right hemisphere, located
1.5 mm lateral and 0.8 mm posterior to the bregma. Then we
ﬁxed a 25-μl Hamilton syringe (80630, Hamilton Co., Reno, NV,
USA) on the stereotaxic apparatus, and vertically through this
point to a depth of 4.0 mm beneath the dural surface. A 10 μl
volume of 1 μg/μl SIRT1 siRNA or scr RNA of the diluted
mixture was delivered into lateral ventricle at a rate of 1 μl/
min according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
sequence of the siRNA primer was designed and synthesized
by QIAGEN (QIAGEN Strasse 1, 40724, Hilden, German). The
protein expression was evaluated 24 h later by Western
blotting.

blocked with 3% normal goat serum containing 0.3% Triton
X-100 for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 1C with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against SIRT1
(1:200, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and a mouse anti-rat neuronal
nuclei (NeuN), a neuronal marker (1:2000, Millipore, Bedford,
MA). Subsequently the sections were washed with PBS three
times and incubated with donkey anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with red-ﬂuorescent Alexa Fluor 488 (1:800; Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and green-ﬂuorescent Alexa Fluor 594 (1:400;
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as secondary antibodies at room
temperature for 2 h. Fluorescent signals were detected with a
confocal laser scanning microscope (FV1000, Olympus, Japan).

4.7.

Western blotting

The neurological behavior of the rats was estimated with an
18-point scoring system that was previously reported by
Garcia et al. (1995) consisting of six tests. These included
spontaneous activity, symmetry of movements, climbing wall
of the wire cage, symmetry of forelimbs, reaction to touch on
either side of trunk, and response to vibrissae touch. The
score range was from 3–18. The neurological tests were
determined at 24 h after reperfusion by an observer who
was blinded to the grouping.

The ischemic penumbra of cerebral cortex was dissected
rapidly and was frozen at 80 1C. The sample was centrifuged
at 12,000  g at 4 1C for 15 min using a BCA protein assay kit
(Beyotime, Haimen, China). Equal amount of protein samples
(40 g/lane) were separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gels electrophoresis and transferred onto a
nitrocellulose ﬁlter membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The
membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk and was incubated
with a rabbit polyclonal anti-SIRT1 (1:1000, Santa Cruz, CA, USA)
primary antibody at 4 1C overnight, then with a horseradishperoxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:5000;
Sigma, St Louis, Missouri) at room temperature for 1 h. Anti-rat
β-actin antibody (1:500; Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co. Ltd.,
China) was used as an internal control. The antigen–antibody
complexes were observed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo, San Jose, CA, USA). The result of
western blot was quantiﬁed using the Gelpro32 software.

Neurological tests

Infarction assessment

For evaluation of infarct volume, rat were anesthetized and
decapitated at 24 h after reperfusion. The brains were rapidly
removed and cooled in ice saline for 20 min. Six 2-mm-thick
coronal sections were cut with the aid of a brain matrix. Sections
were immersed in 1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) at 37 1C for 10 min and transferred
to 4% paraformaldehyde. The brain slices were photographed
with a digital camera 24 h after ﬁxation. Unstained areas were
deﬁned as infarcts and were measured using image analysis
software (Adobe Photoshop CS4, Adobe Systems Incorporated,
San Jose, CA). To exclude the effect of cerebral edema induced
by ischemia on the infarct size, infarct volume of each rat was
calculated by the following formula: (total contralateral hemispheric volume total ipsilateral hemispheric stained volume)/
total contralateral hemispheric volume  100.

Double immunoﬂuorescence staining

To access the localization of SIRT1 protein after CR, anesthetized animals were transcardially perfused with cold physiological saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH
7.4). Brains were postﬁxed 4 h in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 1C
and then immersed in 20% and 30% sucrose solutions. Coronal
sections (10 mm) were cut on a freezing microtome (CM1850,
Leica, Germany) and mounted onto slides. The sections were

Quantitative real time PCR

Total RNA was extracted from ischemic penumbra of cerebral
cortex using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). RNA
quality was assessed by gel electrophoresis as well as OD260/
280 nm ratios. Ten ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed
into single stranded cDNA with PrimeScript™ RT reagent Kit
(DRR037S, TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Ampliﬁcation and quantiﬁcation was carried out
using SYBRs Premix Ex Taq™ II (DRR081A, TaKaRa, Shiga,
Japan) and MJ Research real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad, USA).
Cycling conditions for ampliﬁcation were as follows: 4 min
denaturation step at 94 1C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at
94 1C, 1 min at 55 1C, and 10 s at 72 1C. The primers used in
quantitative real-time PCR were SIRT1(forward 50 -TCA TTC
TGA CTG TGA TGA CGA-30 and reverse 50 -CTG CCA CAG TGT
CAT ATC CAA-30 ), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, forward 50 -GGC ACA GTC AAG GCT GAG AAT
G-30 and reverse 50 -ATG GTG GTG AAG ACG CCA GTA-30 ).
GAPDH was used as endogenous control.
