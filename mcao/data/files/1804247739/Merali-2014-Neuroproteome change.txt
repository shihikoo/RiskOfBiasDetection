Abstract
The thrombolytic, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is the only approved therapy for acute ischemic stroke
(AIS). When administered after AIS, rt-PA has many adverse pleiotropic actions, which are currently poorly understood. The
identification of proteins showing differential expression after rt-PA administration may provide insight into these
pleiotropic actions. In this study we used a 2D-LC MS/MS iTRAQ proteomic analysis, western blotting, and pathway analysis
to analyze changes in protein expression 24-hours after rt-PA administration in the cortical brain tissue of 36 rats that
underwent a sham or transient middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery. After rt-PA administration we reported alterations
in the expressions of 18 proteins, many of which were involved in excitatory neurotransmitter function or cytoskeletal
structure. The expression changes of GAD2 and EAAT1 were validated with western blot. The interactions between the
identified proteins were analyzed with the IPA pathway analysis tool and three proteins: DPYSL2, RTN4, and the NF-kB
complex, were found to have characteristics of being key proteins in the network. The differential protein expressions we
observed may reflect pleiotropic actions of rt-PA after experimental stroke, and shine light on the mechanisms of rt-PA’s
adverse effects. This may have important implications in clinical settings where thrombolytic therapy is used to treat AIS.

receptor’s role in the complex pathophysiology of stroke [7]. More
broadly, it demonstrated the tendency to overemphasize the role
of a single pathway in mediating a complex disease state. To
achieve an understanding of how rt-PA contributes to the
pathophysiology of AIS, it may not be sufficient to utilize a
traditional biochemical approach, in which pathways are investigated in isolation [8–10].
With recent advances in proteomics technology, the overall
protein expression of various samples can be compared within a
single experiment. Analysis of these results with bioinformatics
tools can generate a more comprehensive understanding of the
involved pathways [11]. Neuroproteomic studies of AIS have
varied in their methods, with many published before 2010 making
use of the 2D-gel-based approach (2D-GE MS/MS) [12–15]. A
small number of more recent studies have made use of LC MS/
MS-based multi dimensional protein identification [9,10]. When
combined with the multiplex isobaric tag for relative and absolute
quantification (iTRAQ) method, the LC MS/MS approach can
simultaneously quantify proteins in 4 or 8 samples [16]. A number
of studies have successfully utilized neuroproteomic methods to
analyze differentially expressed proteins after ischemic stroke, and
these results have deepened our understanding of stroke pathophysiology. However, although rt-PA administration alters the
pathophysiology of stroke in a clinically significant way, no study

Introduction
A thrombolytic agent, rt-PA (recombinant tissue plasminogen
activator) is the only therapeutic used in the treatment of acute
ischemic stroke (AIS) [1]. Numerous exclusion criteria, such as a
narrow therapeutic window of 4.5 hrs, limit the number of
patients receiving rt-PA. Even amongst eligible patients, rt-PA is
substantially underused, with only 3% to 8.5% of potentially
eligible patients receiving the drug [2]. The association of rt-PA
with severe adverse effects has contributed to reluctance amongst
emergency physicians to utilize the drug [3].
rt-PA is capable of both beneficial reperfusion due to its
interaction with plasminogen, and neurotoxicity due to its
pleiotropic effects on other brain tissue substrates [4]. While
many of the pleiotropic effects are poorly characterized, the
interaction between the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
and rt-PA has received substantial experimental attention. In the
presence of rt-PA, NMDA receptor signaling is potentiated, and
the ensuing dysregulation of intracellular calcium levels contributes to neuron and glia death after stroke [5]. NMDA receptor
antagonists were seen as promising neuroprotective agents for
their ability to disrupt this process and perhaps mediate the
harmful effects of rt-PA in an animal model [6]. The ultimate
failure, however, of the NMDA receptor antagonists in clinical
trials was demonstrative of the simplification of the NMDA

four groups with a computerized random number generator (five
per group). These groups were: a Sham group - rats receiving a
sham surgery followed by IV sterile water infusion 4 hours after
occlusion; Sham+rt-PA Group - rats receiving a sham surgery
followed by a 10 minute intravenous infusion of 6 mg/kg rt-PA 4
hours after occlusion; tMCAo Group - rats receiving a 1 hr
tMCAo followed by an IV sterile water infusion 4 hours after
occlusion; and tMCAo+rt-PA Group, rats receiving a 1 hr tMCAo
followed by a 10 minute intravenous infusion of 6 mg/kg rt-PA 4
hours after occlusion. An endpoint of 24-hours was chosen
because in the tMCAo rodent model the risks of hemorrhage and
neuronal death reach a peak at this time-point. In addition, this
choice of end-point allowed for maximum comparability with
previous results, as previous neuroproteomic studies have
predominantly chosen an end-point of 24-hours. All rats were
euthanized with an IP euthanyl injection. For the 2D LC-MS/MS
iTRAQ analysis 5 biologic replicates for each experimental group
and 1 injection was performed.

mechanisms underlying rt-PA’s adverse effects. We sought to apply
2D-LC MS/MS and iTRAQ proteomics directly to cortical brain
tissue to analyze how rt-PA administration altered the proteome in
a transient rodent stroke model. A further aim of this study was to
probe the source of this protein regulation with a pathway analysis
tool.

supernatants were isolated and protein content was measured
using the Bio-Rad DC assay, having diluted 10 mL of sample into
1 mL of assay reagent buffer to reduce TCEP concentration to
below acceptable assay thresholds. Once the concentrations of
each sample were determined, 60 mg from each animal in the
same treatment were pooled to a total of 300 mg. Following this,
Nanosep 10 kDa filters (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI, USA)
were rinsed with 100 mL deionized, distilled water, and spun
through the filter. Then, the filters were rinsed with 100 mL of
fresh urea buffer (8 M urea in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5), which
was also spun through and discarded. 200 mg of sample was
loaded onto each filter and spun through for 15 min at 14000 g.
Following this, 100 mL of 50 mM iodoacetamide in urea buffer
was applied to the filters and mixed for 1 min at 600 rpm. The
filters were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and the
buffer was removed by centrifugation at 14000 g for 15 min. The
filters were then rinsed with 100 mL of urea buffer and then rinsed
with 100 mL of 0.5 M TEAB removing buffer by centrifugation
after each rinse. 40 uL of 1 mg Trypsin in 0.5 M TEAB was added
and the filters were incubated at 37 C for 18 h. The digested
samples were isolated by centrifugation, spinning through another
40 mL of 0.5 M TEAB to improve tryptic peptide yield. Peptide
concentration was determined using a Nanospec (Nanolytik,
Germany).

temperature was monitored continuously and kept constant at
37uC. Rats were given 0.03 mg/kg buprenorphine for postsurgical pain relief. At 5-hours after occlusion rats were given
2 mL of subcutaneous fluids. During the surgery heart rate, and
breathing rate were monitored periodically.

Tissue Extraction
At 24-hours after euthanasia brains were quickly removed and
sectioned into 2 mm slices over ice. The right hemisphere from a
slice 0.3 mm anterior of bregma was carefully dissected under
magnification over ice to isolate the cortical tissue. The cortical
tissue was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 280uC until
proteomic analysis. The slices anterior and posterior to this slice
were stained with Tetrazolium Chloride (TTC). Images of TTC
stained sections were imported into the Image J software (NIH).
The infarcted areas were manually traced, as were the total
hemispheric areas. Rats with infarct sizes less than 40% crosssectional area of the sampled right hemisphere sections were
excluded from the proteomic analysis.

Proteomics Sample Preparation
The protocol used was the Filter Aided Sample Preparation
(FASP) method originally developed by Matthial Mann [18].
FASP is able to reduce SDS and contaminant levels, and increase
the yield of membrane bound and nuclear proteins. Cortical tissue
was weighed and dissolved into 800 uL of lysis buffer (3% SDS,
5 mM TCEP, 0.1 M Tris-HCl at pH 7.6). After sonication the
samples were heated at 95 C for 5 min. The samples were then
centrifuged at 14000 g in a microcentrifuge for 10 minutes. The

chosen as the reference database. From the output report
aggregate functional and sub-cellular location information was
extracted. This was compared with the aggregate data from the
entire Rattus norvegicus genome of 20966 proteins.

value of the expression change was calculated from the standard
deviation in logspace.
We imposed a strict set of criteria to reduce false positive
expression changes. For a protein to be accepted as having a
differential expression between treatment groups we used the
following criteria: The protein must have been identified in all 5
iTRAQ preparations. Only proteins that were identified with at
least 2 peptides with greater than 95% confidence were
considered. Proteins with 10% increase or decrease in expression
(iTRAQ ratios 114:113, 116:115, or 113:115 greater than 1.1 or
less than 21.1) and a significant p-value (p,0.05), were
considered to be differentially expressed.
The densitometry results of the western blot experiments were
analyzed in the Excel program (Microsoft, 2013) with a two-tailed
student’s T-test and p,0.05 was taken as being significant.
Degree centrality data from the IPA analysis was also analyzed
with the Excel program. Degree centrality data was taken to have
a normal distribution and proteins with high levels of degree
centrality were identified by calculating the standard deviation
within the distribution.

Pathway and Centrality Analysis
The Uniprot ID of the 403 proteins identified by 2D LC-MS/
MS iTRAQ with an FDR,0.01 were uploaded to the Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA) version 7.5 (Redwood City, CA) software.
IPA allows for the identification of protein-protein interactions and
network interactions based on a database of manually curated
published protein interactions. We utilized a p-value cut-off at 0.05
and no fold change cut-off. Each Uniprot ID meeting this cut-off
was mapped to the corresponding gene object in the Ingenuity
pathway knowledge base. These genes are referred to as focus
genes, and were overlaid onto the curated global molecular
networks contained within the Ingenuity knowledge base. Next,
networks of the focus genes were generated based on proteinprotein interactions and each network was scored based on a
Fisher test. The network score represented the relevance of the
network to the input Uniprot IDs. The highest scoring network
was chosen and was represented as a graph that indicated the
interactions (direct or indirect) between proteins. The relative
expression data from the tMCAo+rt-PA comparison was overlaid
onto this network. Each node indicated a single protein, and the
green or red color indicated up- or down- regulation as seen in the
2D LC-MS/MS iTRAQ analysis.
Lastly, the degree centrality for each protein in the network was
calculated as previously described using the IPA software [11].
Briefly, the degree centrality is the simplest measure of centrality
and represents the number of connections (direct or indirect) made
by each protein in the network regardless of the direction of the
connection. To determine the proteins that had the highest levels
of centrality we used the standard cut-off of 5% [21]. Thus, the
proteins with degree centrality measures in the top 5% of the
distribution were identified as having high degree centrality.

Results
In total 44 rats underwent tMCAo or sham surgery and tissue
extraction. Six rats died before the experimental end-point and
were excluded from further analysis. Two rats had an insufficient
stroke size (,40% hemispheric area) upon TTC staining and were
also excluded from further analysis. This left 36 rats to undergo
tissue analysis. Twenty of these rats underwent 2D LC-MS/MS
iTRAQ analysis with 5 rats per experimental group. The
remaining sixteen rats underwent western blotting experiments
with 4 rats per experimental group.
Physiologic parameters and core body temperature did not
differ between groups (data not shown). All rats that underwent
further analysis had large strokes through the basal ganglia and
cortical regions (Figure 2) occupying at least 40% of the
hemispheric cross-sectional area.

Protein Identification and Relative Expression

Confirmation of Differentially Expressed Proteins by
Western Blot

Overall our analysis identified 1143 distinct proteins, of which
403 had an estimated global False Discovery Rate (FDR),0.01
(Table S1). As an assessment of quality we compared the
distributions of biologic functions of these 403 proteins (209
identified with 2 or more peptides and 113 identified by 1 peptide)
with the entire Rattus norvegicus genome of 20966 proteins
(Figure 3A). 12 functional categories were defined utilizing the
PANTHER gene ontology database. Proteins identified with 2 or
more peptides are comparable in distribution to the overall
genome. Proteins identified with 1 peptide are over-represented in
the metabolic process category.
We next compared the distribution based on sub-cellular
location (Figure 3B). We have identified higher percentages of
proteins from the cytoplasm, and lower percentages of proteins
from the plasma membrane, extra cellular region, and nucleus.
We chose to consider only proteins identified by 2 or more
peptides in our comparative analysis, as there is higher reliability
amongst these identifications 20. The 115 and 113 labels in our 2D
LC-MS/MS iTRAQ analysis are similar to a previous neuroproteomic study by Datta et al., which compared protein expression
in rat brain 24-hours after tMCAo surgery with a sham group.
Comparison of the 115 and 113 labelled proteins from our
analysis, with the Datta et al study, revealed a 74% overlap
between the two lists of identified proteins [10].

Separate animals were used for the western blot analysis (4 per
group). At 24-hours after occlusion rats were euthanized with an
IP euthanyl injection and the cortical tissue was extracted
following the same procedure as for iTRAQ sample preparation.
Whole-cell protein extracts were prepared from the cortical tissue.
Primary antibodies used were: GAD2 (5834P, Cell Signalling),
EAAT1 (5684P, Cell Signalling), and Vinculin (4650P, Cell
Signalling). Infrared conjugated secondary antibodies (LI-COR)
were used and luminescence was quantified using an Odyssey
infrared imaging system.

Statistical Analysis
For data processing the ProteinPilot software v.3.0 (AB SCIEX,
Framingham, USA) was used. The false discovery rate (FDR) for
each protein was estimated using a concatenated target-decoy
database as described by Elias and Gygi. [22] This generated a
probability measure for each protein. To determine iTRAQ
protein quantification the Pro Group algorithm within ProteinPilot was used to calculate a p-value of each relative expression
change. Quantitation data for each protein was based on the
underlying peptides that were determined to be unique by Pro
Group. Within Pro Group, the null-hypothesis was taken as a

Proteome Changes after rt-PA Administration

differential expression after rt-PA administration to either sham
rats or rats that underwent tMCAo. Many of these proteins were
associated with either excitatory neurotransmitter function or
cytoskeletal structure. By applying a pathway analysis tool to the
results of the 2D LC-MS/MS iTRAQ analysis we identified 3
proteins: DPYSL2, RTN4, and the NF-kB complex as having
characteristics of being key proteins in the interaction network.
These results may provide insight into the potential mechanisms
underlying the adverse effects of rt-PA use after AIS.
In this study, the rat tMCAo model and the iTRAQ MS
analysis are potential sources of variation [15]. We utilized sample
pooling, replicates, internal controls, and bioinformatic analyses to
address these concerns, and assess their influence on the data, as
these strategies have been validated [13,25,26]. The group of 209
proteins identified with 2 or more peptides showed similar
functional and sub-cellular distributions to the entire Rattus
norvegicus genome. The under-representation of nuclear and
membrane bound proteins is an expected artifact, and our yield
from these two compartments is comparable to another study
utilizing the FASP protocol and exceeds that of studies which did
not utilize FASP [27]. The comparable spacial and functional
distributions yielded, as well as a high overlap between our results
and the study by Datta et al. lend support to the reliability of our
sample collection and analysis.
Excitatory neurotransmitter function is thought to become
deregulated after stroke, leading to excitotoxic cell death through
excessive activation of NMDA and AMPA type receptors [5,28].
Previous work has shown that after stroke, rt-PA potentiates
glutamate activity at NMDA receptors by proteolytically cleaving
the NR-2 subunit [29]. In addition, excitatory amino acid
transporters can reverse transport direction under ischemic
conditions, leading to a further increase in synaptic glutamate
levels. [30] Our results indicated that after sham and tMCAo
surgery, rt-PA had caused down-regulation of the EAAT1 and
GAD2 proteins, both of which are responsible for reducing the
levels of synaptic glutamate and other excitatory neurotransmitters. GAD2 is an enzyme that converts synaptic glutamate into the
inhibitory GABA [31]. In an animal model, GAD2 was
neuroprotective against excitotoxic damage by reducing levels of
available glutamate in pre-synaptic neurons [32]. EAAT1 is the
predominant transporter responsible for removing glutamate and
aspartate from the synapse [33]. Like GAD2, EAAT1 activity is
neuroprotective by reducing synaptic glutamate levels [34–36]. In
addition, our results showed alterations in the expressions of
synaptic vesicle proteins RAB10, SYN2, and SYT2. RAB10 is a
key regulator of intra-cellular membrane trafficking, and may be
responsible for recycling AMPA receptors from intracellular
compartments to the synapse [37]. SYN2 and SYT2 are both
involved in facilitating neurotransmitter release into the synapse.
Previous studies have indicated that dysfunctions in the expression
levels of the SYN and SYT families can markedly affect the extent
of ischemic brain injury [38,39]. Our results also indicated that rtPA had caused a change in the expression of the CaMK2d, a
protein responsible for sensing the rise in intracellular calcium
levels due to excitatory neurotransmitter stimulation at the NMDA
receptors [40]. Our results demonstrated that a number of
proteins involved in excitatory neurotransmitter function were
differentially expressed after rt-PA administration to sham and
tMCAo rats. Many of these proteins have been previously
implicated in neuronal damage after ischemic injury, and the
observed differential expressions may reflect adverse pleiotropic
effects of rt-PA administration.
Cytoskeletal structure is necessary for neurovascular integrity
[41,42]. Alterations of cytoskeletal function and composition occur

(Table 1) summarizes the expressions changes (fold changes) of
protein pairs identified in the experimental groups. (Figure 4)
illustrates the distribution of fold changes amongst the identified
proteins. The main expression changes were seen in the tMCAo+
rt-PA comparison (Figure 4B), where 13 proteins were significantly
up- or down-regulated. The same number of significant expression
changes were seen in the tMCAo/sham comparison. Four proteins
which were over-expressed after tMCAo were significantly downregulated with tMCAo+rt-PA. These were glutamate decarboxylase 2 (GAD2), proteasome subunit alpha (PSMA2), Ras-related
protein Rab-10 (RAB10), and Synapsin-2 (SYN2). Both the
Myelin basic protein (MBP) and the Neurofilament heavy
polypeptide (NEFH) were significantly down-regulated after
tMCAo and significantly up-regulated after rt-PA administration
following tMCAo.
Six proteins that were unaffected after tMCAo alone had their
expressions significantly altered when rt-PA was administered after
the tMCAO. These included 3 cytoskeletal proteins: (INA, MAPT,
NEFL), a nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CNP1), and two dehydrogenases (GLDH1, NDUFV2).
Surprisingly there were four proteins affected by rt-PA
administration in the sham group, which were unaffected by
tMCAo, and rt-PA administration after tMCAo. These were the
cytoskeletal proteins (ARP2, NEF3, TUBA8) and the phosphatase
subunit PPP1CB. Only 2 proteins (GAD2 and RAB10) had their
expressions significantly affected in the same direction when rt-PA
was administered to the sham group as when rt-PA was
administered to the tMCAo group. There were two cytoskeletal
proteins (NEFH and NEFL) that showed opposite expression
changes when rt-PA was given to the sham group compared to
when it was given to the tMCAo group.

Pathway Analysis
(Figure 5) represents the output of the IPA analysis with relative
expression information overlaid. In this network Dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DPYSL2), reticulon 4 (RTN4), and the
nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) complex had degree centralities in
the upper 5% of the distribution. Both DPYSL2 and RTN4
connected to 11 identified proteins, the majority of which were
related to cytoskeleton structure/maintenance. The NF-kB interacted with 10 identified proteins, many of which were related to
excitatory neurotransmitter function.

Western Blot Validation
In order to confirm the results from the 2D LC-MS/MS
experiment western blots were used to quantify the expression of
GAD2 and EAAT1 (Figure 6). GAD2 and EAAT1 were chosen,
as these are proteins that have previously been implicated in
exacerbating cell death after AIS and may represent adverse
pleiotropic actions of rt-PA. The western blot analysis of GAD2
and EAAT1 confirmed the iTRAQ data.

Discussion
Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is the only medical
agent used in the acute treatment of AIS, but because of its
pleiotropic actions it is associated with severe adverse effects
[23,24]. Since the extent of rt-PA’s pleiotropic interactions are
unknown, the identification of proteins that show differential
expression after rt-PA administration may shed light on the
molecular mechanisms underlying rt-PA’s adverse effects. In this
study we used a 2D LC-MS/MS iTRAQ proteomics approach to
characterize the brain protein changes that result 24 hrs after rtPA administration. We have identified 18 proteins showing

after ischemic stroke [43]. Our results indicated differential
expression of cytoskeletal and cytoskeleton regulatory proteins
after rt-PA administration to both sham and tMCAo rats. The
family of neurofilament proteins is a major element of the
neuronal cytoskeleton, regulating axonal structure and diameter.
The increase in neurofilament proteins we observed with rt-PA
administration in tMCAo rats may indicate increased axonal
growth [44]. In addition, our observations indicated that the
expression of cytoskeletal proteins such as ARP2, INA, MAPT,
and TUBA8 may be highly sensitive to rt-PA administration after
tMCAo, leading to alterations in cytoskeletal structure and
function.
Pathway analysis has become a standard method to gain insight
into the underlying biology of differentially expressed proteins
identified by proteomic analyses [45]. We generated an interaction
network from the results of our 2D LC-MS/MS iTRAQ
experiment and used the IPA software to perform a centrality
analysis on this network. In a previous study, proteins with high
centrality were 3 times more likely to be biologically essential [46].
It therefore appears that DPYSL2, RTN4, and NF-kB complex,
which all showed high centrality in our protein-protein interaction
network, may serve important functions in this network. DPYSL2
is involved in neuronal regeneration and multiple studies have
identified changes in DPYSL2 expression and function shortly
after ischemic brain injury [47]. RTN4 is also involved in neuronal
regeneration, and has been proposed as a potential therapeutic
target because of its role in exacerbating damage after experimental stroke [48]. The NF-kB complex regulates the expression
of many proteins and its activation is known to exacerbate
ischemic brain injury while inhibition of the NF-kB complex is
neuroprotective [49]. The NF-kB complex can be activated by rtPA through a pathway involving annexin A2/CD11b and
integrin-linked kinase [50]. In our model the activated NF-kB
may go on to cause a subset of the protein expression changes
noticed in the 2D LC-MS/MS iTRAQ analysis. It is important to
note that our pathway analysis is limited to simply suggesting that

DPYSL2, RTN4, or the NF-kB complex may be relevant to rtPA’s pleiotropic actions. Pathway analyses are limited in part by
low-resolution knowledge databases, missing condition-specific
interactions, and incomplete annotations. Despite this, however,
these results may prompt further research into rt-PA’s pleiotropic
effects on the cortex. For example, we are currently examining the
effect of rt-PA on various proteins under the control of the NF-kB
complex after experimental stroke.
In conclusion, a 2D LC-MS/MS iTRAQ analysis identified 18
proteins with differential expression 24-hours after rt-PA administration to rats that underwent sham or tMCAo surgery. Many of
the identified proteins have been previously implicated in ischemic
brain injury. The differential protein expressions we observed may
reflect pleiotropic actions of rt-PA on the cortex of rats. Although
further focused work is required to investigate these protein
regulations in isolation, the general overview of protein regulation
presented in our study provides insight into the potential
mechanisms of rt-PA’s adverse pleiotropic actions. This work
may guide future work and may have implications in clinical
settings where rt-PA is used to treat AIS.
