Abstract Minocycline and candesartan have both shown
promise as candidate therapeutics in ischemic stroke, with
multiple, and somewhat contrasting, molecular mechanisms.
Minocycline is an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and
anti-apoptotic agent and a known inhibitor of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs). Yet, minocycline exerts
antiangiogenic effects both in vivo and in vitro. Candesartan
promotes angiogenesis and activates MMPs. Aligning these
therapies with the dynamic processes of injury and repair after
ischemia is likely to improve success of treatment. In this
study, we hypothesize that opposing actions of minocycline
and candesartan on angiogenesis, when administered simultaneously, will reduce the benefit of candesartan treatment.
Therefore, we propose a sequential combination treatment
regimen to yield a better outcome and preserve the
proangiogenic potential of candesartan. In vitro angiogenesis
was assessed using human brain endothelial cells. In vivo,
Wistar rats subjected to 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were randomized into four groups: saline,
candesartan, minocycline, and sequential combination of
minocycline and candesartan. Neurobehavioral tests were performed 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after stroke. Brain tissue was
collected on day 14 for assessment of infarct size and vascular
density. Minocycline, when added simultaneously, decreased

the proangiogenic effect of candesartan treatment in vitro.
Sequential treatment, however, preserved the proangiogenic
potential of candesartan both in vivo and in vitro, improved
neurobehavioral outcome, and reduced infarct size. Sequential
combination therapy with minocycline and candesartan improves long-term recovery and maintains candesartan’s
proangiogenic potential.

Introduction
Stroke is one of the most common and undertreated conditions
worldwide. Each year, more than 700,000 stroke cases occur
in the USA, resulting in significant disability and mortality as
well as an estimated cost of $36 billion [1]. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) remains the only FDA-approved
pharmacologic/biologic treatment option [2]. With only 2–
3 % of patients receiving tPA nationwide [3], there is an urgent
need to develop new therapies for acute ischemic stroke.
Cerebral ischemia promotes an angiogenic response in the
brain [4] that is considered to be a key component of recovery
[5, 6]. Angiogenic genes are upregulated within minutes of the
incidence of an ischemic insult. Endothelial cell proliferation
starts as early as 12 hours and continues for several weeks in a

310

mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia [7]. In humans, evidence of active angiogenesis was detected 3–4 days after
stroke [8, 9]. The role played by angiogenesis in mediating
recovery goes beyond creating a shunt to reperfuse ischemic
tissues [10]. Newly formed vessels help clean up the ischemic
site in preparation for neurovascular remodeling [11]. In
addition, blood vessels upregulate neuron guidance cues
to recruit neural stem cells to the site of injury [12].
Due to the tight relationship between angiogenesis and
neurogenesis in addition to the dramatic failure of
neuroprotectants in stroke clinical trials, therapies that
aim at promoting angiogenesis are now being attempted
in experimental models of focal cerebral ischemia
[13–15].
Decades of preclinical research have led to improved understanding of the timing and molecular mediators of injury
and repair after ischemic brain insult [16, 17]. It has been
acknowledged that the mediators of initial injury (e.g., matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) and vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF)) contribute to the repair and remodeling process in the long term [17]. Sequential therapy, although extensively studied in oncology [18] and gastroenterology [19], has
been understudied in stroke.
Minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic with anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, and MMP-inhibitory effects,
has shown promising results in stroke preclinical studies. Our
group, as well as others, has reported reduced infarct size and
intracerebral hemorrhage, together with improved neurobehavioral outcome in response to minocycline treatment
[reviewed in [20]]. Minocycline treatment, however, suppressed in vivo and in vitro angiogenesis via MMPdependent and MMP-independent mechanisms [21–25].
Therefore, combining the benefits of minocycline with a
proangiogenic approach represents an attractive therapeutic
option.
Candesartan, an angiotensin II type-1 receptor blocker, has
long been studied in experimental stroke settings. Candesartan
treatment improved neurobehavioral outcome, reduced infarct
size [26–29], and increased cerebrovascular density, an effect
that was associated with enhanced MMP activity, especially
MMP-2 [29]. Clinical utility is, however, complicated by
candesartan’s blood pressure lowering effect. Recent
studies have shown a lack of benefit, if not a deleterious effect, of blood pressure lowering in the acute
phase after ischemic stroke [25, 30] and current guidelines advise against blood pressure lowering within the
first 24 h [31]. In this study, we propose a combination
of early minocycline treatment followed by 7-day lowdose candesartan treatment to improve functional recovery after focal cerebral ischemia. Due to opposite actions of
minocycline and candesartan on angiogenesis, we employ a
sequential approach designed to preserve candesartan’s
proangiogenic effect.

Materials and Methods
All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Veterans
Affairs Medical Center.

In Vitro Experiments
Oxygen and Glucose Deprivation and Treatments To
mimic oxygen and glucose deprivation conditions that occur
during stroke, human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells
(hCMECs) were incubated in a hypoxia chamber (Bioshperix
Proox Model C21, Lacona, NY) at 0.1 % O2 and 5 % CO2 at
37 °C and switched to glucose-free Neurobasal-A medium
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). After 2 h, cells were
returned to normoxic conditions and switched to serum-free
medium with or without different treatments. To study the
dose-response relationship of individual and simultaneous
treatments, cells were treated with either minocycline
(6 μg/ml) or candesartan (0.1, 1, and 10 μg/ml) alone or in
combination. To compare the effect of simultaneous and sequential treatments on in vitro angiogenesis, cells were treated
with minocycline (6 μg/ml) for 12 h, followed by 24-h treatment with candesartan (10 μg/ml) for the sequential treatment
group. Cells were washed twice with warm PBS between the
treatments to avoid physical interaction between the two
agents. The simultaneous treatment group was exposed to
serum-free medium in the first 12 h, followed by 24-h treatment with both minocycline and candesartan. The tested concentration of minocycline (6 μg/ml) is the peak serum concentration achieved in humans after intravenous administration of the FDA-approved dose of 200 mg [32]. Candesartan
concentrations have been shown to exert an angiogenic
effect in vitro on human brain microvascular endothelial
cells [33].
Angiogenic Assays We conducted cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation assays to mimic the different steps of
angiogenesis.
Cell Proliferation In vitro, endothelial cell proliferation was
assessed by BrdU colorimetric assay kit (Roche Applied
Science, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Cells were plated in density of 5,000 cells/well in
96-well plate and kept overnight in complete medium. The
cells were serum starved, exposed to 2-h oxygen and glucose
deprivation (OGD). Upon reoxygenation, cells were treated
with candesartan (0.1, 1, or 10 μg/ml), minocycline
(6 μg/ml), or the combination of minocycline and different
concentrations of candesartan. The BrdU labeling solution
was then added. At 24 h, absorbance was measured
colorimetrically at 450 nm.

Cell Migration Cell migration was assessed by the in vitro
wound healing assay as described previously [33]. Cells were
seeded at high density in six-well plates. Confluent cells were
serum starved overnight and two perpendicular scratches were
made using a 1,000-μl tip (Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA). Treatments or serum-free medium were added and 5×
micrographs were taken at 0, 18, and 24 h using phase contrast
microscopy on an inverted microscope. Width of the scratch
was measured at 20 points (5 points/arm) and the average
width was calculated for each well using the formula:
Percent migration=[(average width at 0 h−average width
at×hours)/average width at 0 h]×100.
Tube Formation The ability of cells to form tubes was measured by Matrigel tube formation assay (Castellon et al. 2001).
Confluent cells were serum starved overnight. Cells were subjected to serum-free medium with or without treatment for
24 h. Cells were then harvested and resuspended in serumfree medium: matrigel (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ)
in a ratio of 70:30. The mixture was quickly transferred to 96well plate (100 μl/well) and matrigel was allowed to solidify.
Approximately 3×104 cells in 100 μl were seeded into each
quadruplicate well. At 24 h, 10× micrographs were taken from
the center of each well and tube-like structures were quantified
in a blinded fashion.
Lactate Dehydrogenase Release Lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) released into the cell supernatant was used as a marker
of cell death. LDH concentration was measured using the
cytotoxicity detection (LDH) kit (Roche Applied Science,
Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Cells were serum starved overnight and exposed to OGD conditions for 2 h followed by 24-h reoxygenation and treatment
with either minocycline alone or in combination with 10×
increments of candesartan concentration. Culture medium
was then collected and cell-free supernatant was used for this
assay by centrifugation of the samples at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C
for 10 min. A volume of 100 μl was then transferred in quadruplicates to a 96-well plate from each test group. Reaction
mixture was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions and a volume of 100 μl was added to each well. LDH
released from dead cells converts the tetrazolium INT salt into
a colored formazan that was measured at 500 nm using an
ELISA plate reader. Results were represented as foldincrease relative to the control group.
In Vivo Experiments
Experimental Cerebral Ischemia and Treatments Adult
(9–10 weeks old) male Wistar rats (Charles River Breeding
Company, Wilmington, MA, USA), weighing between 280–
300 g, were subjected to 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using intraluminal suture model as described

311

previously [28]. Briefly, animals were anesthetized using 2–
5 % isoflurane inhalation. Temporary MCAO was achieved
using 4–0 silicon-coated nylon suture (Doccol, Sharon, MA),
advanced into the internal carotid artery to block the origin of
the middle cerebral artery. After 90 min, animals were reanaesthetized and sutures were removed to allow reperfusion
of ischemic brain areas. Animals were randomly assigned into
four treatment groups by a blinded researcher: saline,
minocycline only (Mino), candesartan only (Cand), and the
sequential combination of minocycline and candesartan
(Sequential Comb), and received treatments as shown in
Table 1. The dose of minocycline (20 mg/kg) was shown to
exert neuroprotective effects in vivo [34] and the dose of
candesartan (0.3 mg/kg) was determined to be subhypotensive
in our previous experiments [35]. The timing of intervention
was controlled such that, in all treatment groups, the protective
therapy was initiated at reperfusion as an intravenous (i.v.)
dose to achieve rapid drug delivery. Subsequent treatments
were given intraperitoneally (i.p.) to achieve longer-lasting
drug levels in blood. Candesartan was a kind gift from
AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals (Wilmington, DE).
Minocycline was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). All animals were singly housed before and after surgery,
with free access to food and water.
Neurobehavioral Testing Neurobehavioral assessment was
done 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after the onset of MCAO in a blinded
fashion using modified Bederson score, beam walk, rotarod
performance, and grip strength tests.
Modified Bederson Score Animals were assigned a score
from 0 to 3, with lower scores indicating better performance.
The animal was given one point for each of the following:
forelimb flexion; diminished resistance to lateral push; and
contralateral circling [36].
Beam Walk Animals were placed on a beam (60 cm long and
4.5 cm wide) for 60 s and assigned a score from 0 to 6 as
follows: balances on the beam with a steady posture = 0;
grasps side of the beam = 1; hugs the beam with one limb
falling = 2; hugs the beam with two limbs falling = 3; falls off
the beam within 40 to 60 s = 4; falls off the beam within 20 to
40 s = 5; falls off the beam in less than 20 s = 6 [37].
Rotarod Test Three days prior to MCAO, animals were
trained to stay on the accelerating rod as follows: on day 1,
animals were habituated to stay on the rod rotating at a fixed
speed of 2 rpm for 5 min. On day 2, animals perform
three 5-min running sessions and allowed to rest for
10 min between sessions. Animals run at a basal speed of
2 rpm that was accelerated by 1 rpm every 10 s to a final speed
of 15 rpm. On day 3, animals follow the same training schedule as day 2 but reaching a final speed of 30 rpm. Baseline

performance was recorded before MCAO surgery. Animals
were then tested 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after MCAO.
Maximum speed reached before the animal falls off the rod
was recorded for the three sessions and averaged. Rotarod
performance was calculated as percentage of baseline performance [38].
Grip Strength Grip Strength Meter (Columbus instruments,
Columbus, OH) was used to measure baseline and post-stroke
neuromuscular function. Animals were suspended by the tail
and allowed to hold to a sensor bar. The animals were then
pulled by the tail away from the sensor bar till they release
their grip. An electronic digital force gauge was used to measure the peak pulling force exerted by the animal on the sensor
bar. Three readings were recorded for each animal and averaged. Results were expressed as percentage of baseline grip
strength.
Assessment of Infarct Size and Immunohistochemistry On
day 14 post-stroke, animals were deeply anaesthetized
with ketamine/xylazine mixture (85 and 15 %, respectively) and transcardially perfused with ice cold PBS
followed by 10 % formalin (Thermofisher Scientific,
Waltham, CA). Animals were then decapitated and their
brain tissue collected and stored in 10 % formalin overnight. The brains were then embedded in OCT blocks
and cryosectioned coronally into 12-μm-thick slices

starting from the frontal pole at 2 mm intervals.
Sections were stained with 1 % cresyl violet.
Infarction areas, defined as areas showing reduced staining under light microscopy, were measured blindly
using Image J software, corrected for edema, and
expressed as percentage of the contralateral hemisphere
using the formula: 100 × [contralateral − (ipsilateral − infarct)]/contralateral.
Frozen 10 μm sections were immunostained for laminin
(Dakocytomation, Carpinteria, CA). Briefly, brain sections
were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C at
the dilution of 1/50, followed by 2-h incubation with 1/300
fluorescent secondary antibody. Slides were then coverslipped
with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA) and viewed using Zeiss Axio Observer Z1
fluorescent microscope. Micrographs were taken at magnification ×20 from four different fields in the ischemic cortex,
ischemic border zone, and contralateral hemisphere.
Micrographs were quantified in a blinded fashion using
ImageJ software (NIH).
MMP Zymography MMP gelatinolytic activity was measured using zymography, as described previously [39].
Briefly, brains were collected at day 14 post stroke and sliced
coronally into seven sections (A–G); a volume containing
100 μg total protein (from slices D and E) was loaded into
10 % zymogram gel and electrophoretically separated under

Transl. Stroke Res. (2015) 6:309–322

non-reducing conditions. The gel was then incubated for 48 h
with Zymogram Development Buffer at 37 °C. Zymogram gel
was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA) and destained with Destain Solution (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). The gelatinolytic bands were analyzed with ImageJ software (NIH).
Human Cerebral Microvascular Endothelial Cell
Line Cells were provided by Dr. Jason Zastre (University of
Georgia, Athens, GA). The cells were grown in MCDB-131
complete medium (VEC technologies, Rensselaer, NY).
Before treatments, endothelial cells were serum-starved overnight in serum-free EMEM (ATCC, Manassas, VA). This clinically relevant cell line was chosen for our experiments since
we have previously shown and established the proangiogenic
response of candesartan using these cells [33, 40]. Therefore,
we studied whether minocycline will abolish this
proangiogenic effect upon simultaneous versus sequential
treatment with candesartan using the same cell type.
Western Blotting Brain tissue was collected from a separate
set of animals 14 days after the onset of MCAO. From each
hemisphere, slices B–E were collected and snap frozen. Brain
tissue was then homogenized and protein expression was measured as described previously [28]. Non-specific binding was
blocked by incubating the membranes in 5 % milk in TBST
for 60 min prior to overnight incubation with primary antibody against VEGF (Millipore, Billerica, MA). β-Actin
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was used as an endogenous
loading control. Densitometric measurements were done
using ImageJ software (NIH).
Statistical Analysis All statistics were carried out using
NCSS2007 software. Results are expressed as mean±standard
error of the mean (±SEM). Data were statistically analyzed
using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison post-hoc test. Tests of
interaction were done using two-way ANOVA. A value of
P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Simultaneous but Not Sequential Minocycline
and Candesartan Treatment Abolishes
Candesartan-Induced Proangiogenic State In Vitro
We have previously demonstrated enhanced angiogenic steps
in human brain endothelial cells in response to candesartan
treatment in vitro [33]. Here, we sought to optimize the combination timing to preserve candesartan-induced
proangiogenic state. To assess the functional outcome of simultaneous treatment, we quantified different angiogenic

313

steps in vitro in response to different candesartan concentrations with or without simultaneous minocycline treatment.
Endothelial cell proliferation was reduced by 36 % in response
to minocycline treatment (Fig. 1a). Candesartan treatment
(0.1, 1, and 10 μg/ml) enhanced cell proliferation by 37, 59,
and 47 %, respectively. Simultaneous minocycline treatment
resulted in a decreased proliferative potential, as compared to
their respective candesartan only treatment groups. To assess
whether the reduced BrdU incorporation observed with
minocycline treatment was due to an anti-proliferative or a
direct cytotoxic effect of the tested minocycline concentration,
we measured LDH release in the cell culture media. LDH
concentration did not increase with minocycline treatment either alone or in combination with different concentrations of
candesartan (Fig. 1b). Endothelial cell migration followed the
same pattern as cell proliferation. Minocycline treatment reduced migration by 27 and 41 % at 18 and 24 h, respectively,
as compared to the control group (Fig. 1c, d). Candesartan
treatment, on the other hand, exerted a pro-migratory effect.
At 18 h, candesartan, at different concentrations, enhanced
endothelial cell migration by about 40 %. At 24 h, candesartan
treatment displayed a dose-dependent pro-migratory response,
resulting in 41, 59, and 74 % increase in endothelial cell migration in response to treatment with 0.1, 1, and 10 μg/ml of
candesartan, respectively. Simultaneous treatment with
minocycline significantly reduced candesartan-induced promigratory effects as compared to their respective candesartan
only treatment groups. Although there was a trend of decreasing endothelial cell alignment into tube-like structures with
minocycline treatment, this effect did not reach significance
at the tested sample size (Fig. 1e). Candesartan treatment induced a profound dose-dependent increase in the number of
tube-like structures at 24 h. Simultaneous minocycline treatment, however, abolished endothelial cell response to
candesartan treatment. Further, we tested whether sequential
treatment preserves candesartan-induced proangiogenic effect. As shown in Fig. 2a, endothelial cell migration was only
slightly increased by simultaneous treatment. Sequential treatment, however, enhanced cell migration by more than twofold. Similarly, endothelial cell alignment into tube-like structures 24 h after simultaneous treatment was comparable in the
untreated control group (Fig. 2b). Sequential treatment enhanced endothelial cell alignment into tubular structures by
almost fivefold.
Sequential Treatment Preserves Candesartan-Induced
VEGF Upregulation and Induction of a Prolonged
Proangiogenic State In Vivo
We have previously shown an enhanced VEGF expression
and a proangiogenic response in vivo after candesartan treatment [28, 29, 33]. The proangiogenic response was accompanied by MMP activation, especially MMP-2 (Kozak et al.

2009). In this study, we tested whether the proangiogenic effect of candesartan was maintained in a low-dose treatment
regimen and whether early minocycline treatment affected
such a response. There was ∼30 % increase in MMP-2 activity
in both the candesartan only and the sequential treatment
groups that did not reach significance (Fig. 3a). Minocycline
treatment alone or in combination with candesartan did not
decrease MMP-2 or MMP-9 at 14 days (Fig. 3a, b). VEGF
expression in the sequential combination group measured at
14 days was comparable to that of the candesartan only group
(Fig. 3c). Both treatment regimens resulted in significantly

higher VEGF levels as compared to the saline treatment.
Further, we tested whether VEGF upregulation led to increased vascular density. Laminin staining showed ∼2-, 3-,
and 2.3-fold increase in the cortex, ischemic border zone,
and contralateral hemisphere, respectively, with candesartan
treatment as compared to saline-treated group (Fig. 3d–f).
Sequential combination treatment enhanced vascular density by 1.8-, 3.8-, and 2.8-fold relative to saline treatment in
the respective brain regions. Of note, a single dose of
minocycline enhanced vascular density at the cortex region
by ∼90 %.

Similar to grip strength test, rotarod performance showed an
early and significant improvement starting day 1 in all treatment groups, as compared to saline treatment (Fig. 5d).
Nevertheless, improvement plateaued early in the individual
treatment groups. Only the sequential combination treatment
was significantly improved as compared to saline treatment on
days 7 and 14 after stroke.

Discussion
The objective of this study is to test the combination of
minocycline and candesartan on stroke outcome and on inherent reparative mechanisms after stroke. We sought to optimize
treatment timing in order to harness the benefits and decrease
the likelihood of interaction between the two agents. Our
in vitro findings include the abrogation of candesartaninduced proangiogenic state by concomitant minocycline administration. Spacing of minocycline and candesartan treatments preserved the angiogenic potential of candesartan treatment both in vitro and in vivo. This was accompanied by
reduced infarct size and enhanced neurobehavioral recovery
14 days after experimental focal cerebral ischemia.
Minocycline displays MMP inhibitory characteristics as
well as antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects, among other non-antibiotic properties [reviewed by
[41]]. Minocycline treatment reduced infarct volume in suture
and embolic MCAO models [42, 43] and was effective at
reducing brain edema and neurological deficit in an experimental intracerebral hemorrhage model [44]. Furthermore,
minocycline has shown promising neuroprotective effects in
several non-stroke brain injury models, including
Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury [41]. Due to its welldocumented non-antibiotic properties, supported by evidence
of neuroprotection in different brain injury models, we
attempted early minocycline treatment after focal cerebral
ischemia.
Chronic angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockade has
been shown to increase cerebrovascular density in the presence or absence of an ischemic insult [45, 46]. Furthermore, in
an animal model of focal cerebral ischemia, administration of
a single candesartan dose at reperfusion induced a prolonged
VEGF upregulation [33] and increased vascular density at
7 days [29]. In human brain endothelial cells, candesartan
treatment induced a proangiogenic response mediated by
VEGF, among other factors [33, 40]. Of note, we have previously reported enhanced MMP activity, especially MMP-2,
24 h after treatment with 1 mg/kg of candesartan, which could
explain VEGF upregulation and the proangiogenic state since
MMPs and VEGF are interrelated [47–50]. The benefits of
candesartan treatment, however, could be masked by its blood
pressure lowering effect. Current guidelines advise against

319

blood pressure reduction in the first 24 h after stroke [31].
We, therefore, attempted a combination of minocycline at reperfusion followed by low-dose candesartan treatment starting
24 h after MCAO in our in vivo studies.
While several studies demonstrated the detrimental consequences of MMP activation early after stroke [51], caution
against late MMP inhibition emerged when the latter approach
was accompanied with reduced markers of neurovascular remodeling [52]. The dual Bdestructive-protective^ nature of
MMPs, depending on the timing, calls for fine-tuning of the
enzymatic activity in order to improve long-term
neurovascular recovery after stroke. In our treatment regimen,
early minocycline administration at reperfusion, either alone
or in the combination treatment group, preserved MMP activity 14 days after MCAO, allowing for neurovascular recovery.
Minocycline treatment preserved vascular structure in the ischemic hemisphere, as evident by enhanced laminin staining.
Vascular density was ∼90 and 40 % higher in the ischemic
cortex and the ischemic border zone, respectively, in
minocycline-treated animals as compared to their saline counterparts. However, this effect was not accompanied by enhanced vascular density in the contralateral hemisphere or
increased cell proliferation, suggesting a vascular protective
rather than a neovascularization effect of minocycline treatment. Minocycline actions as an MMP inhibitor, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and antioxidant drug could all explain
the vascular protective effect observed 14 days after a single
minocycline treatment. Nonetheless, a recent report demonstrated increased neovessel formation and expression of tight
junction proteins in the ischemic border zone 4 weeks after
MCAO in response to a single minocycline treatment.
Neovascularization was attributed to reduced tissue loss with
the treatment. This is not in discord with our results, since
tissue and vascular preservation at 14 days, demonstrated in
our current study, could possibly lead to enhanced angiogenesis at later time points [53].
We have previously shown that candesartan (1 mg/kg)
treatment enhances MMP-2 activity 24 h after the induction
of focal cerebral ischemia. In this study, the 7-day, low-dose
candesartan treatment induced a modest increase in MMP-2
activity that did not reach significance at 14 days. Candesartan
alone or in sequential combination with minocycline induced
a prolonged increase in VEGF expression that was accompanied by enhanced vascular density in both hemispheres.
Interestingly, early minocycline treatment did not affect
MMP activity or VEGF levels at 14 days, further supporting
our treatment regimen. Therefore, early minocycline treatment
at reperfusion preserved the proangiogenic response to the
subsequent candesartan administration. Our data points to
the importance of fine-tuning MMP activity by optimizing
treatment timing in order to harness the benefits of both
agents. Due to the multiple pharmacological effects induced
by both agents as well as the complexity of the stroke

320

pathophysiology, we do not exclude the involvement of other
mechanisms and pathways leading to enhanced neurobehavioral recovery after stroke. This effect could be attributed to
the interplay of several non-antibiotic properties of
minocycline as well as AT1-dependent and AT1-independent
effects of candesartan treatment.
Although there is a consistent trend of further enhancement
in neurobehavioral recovery with the combination treatment at
14 days compared to individual treatments, some of the tests
did not reach significance. This could be attributed to the
limitation of the test, the test settings, or the selected time
point. Bederson and beam walk tests use a subjective 0–3
and 0–6 scale, respectively, to assess functional recovery.
The challenge of 30 rpm in the rotarod performance test did
not allow for further improvement to show. Infarct size was
measured 14 days after stroke. At this time point, inherent
reparative mechanisms in the brain, especially when accelerated with individual treatments, could mitigate the significance of the combination treatment. Nevertheless, replacing
candesartan in the first 24 h by minocycline treatment enhances the translational potential of this study by following
the current guidelines that recommend against early blood
pressure lowering.
With the continuous failure of stroke therapeutics in the
clinical setting, there is an urgent need to develop new strategies that augment the brain’s reparative capacity. This study
suggests a novel, sequential therapy with two safe and welltolerated FDA-approved drugs as a possible tactic to enhance
recovery after cerebral ischemia.
