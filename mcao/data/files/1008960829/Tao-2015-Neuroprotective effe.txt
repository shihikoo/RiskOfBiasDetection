MicroRNA-99a (miR-99a) has been reported to function as a tumor suppressor through regulating cell cycle and
apoptosis. But its clinical signiﬁcance in ischemic stroke and its function in cerebral ischemia–reperfusion (I/R)
injury remained unknown. Herein transient middle cerebral artery occlusion was built on C57BL/6 mice, followed
by intracerebroventricular injection of miR-99a agomir or antagomir before reperfusion for 24 h. Our clinical
analysis indicates that plasma miR-99a level was signiﬁcantly decreased in ischemic stroke patients as compared
to healthy subjects, and a signiﬁcant correlation was observed between miR-99a and clinical parameters. And
miR-99a overexpression mitigated I/R injury in mice, as evidenced by reduced brain infarct volume and neural
apoptosis, whereas miR-99a downregulation aggravates brain injury. In vitro, miR-99a protected neuro-2a
cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress injury, by improving cell viability, suppressing LDH
release and cell apoptosis. In addition, miR-99a overexpression inhibited H2O2 induced G1/S phase transition
in neuro-2a cells, accompanied by a signiﬁcant decrease in cyclin D1 level and a tendency of down-regulation
of CDK6. It was further proved in mice that miR-99a inhibited cyclin D1 and CDK6 expressions following cerebral
I/R injury. These ﬁndings indicate that miR-99a reduces neuronal damage following cerebral I/R through regulating cell cycle progression and preventing apoptosis, suggesting that miR-99a could be used as a new therapeutic
agent targeting neuronal cell cycle re-entry following stroke.

1. Introduction
The treatment options for stroke are limited, and to date tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only approved therapeutic agent for
acute ischemic stroke by Food and Drug Administration. MicroRNAs
(miRs) are short, endogenous, non-coding RNAs that modulate several
physiological and pathophysiologic processes including proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis—via post-transcriptional regulation of
target gene expression [1–3]. During the past ten years, most miRs
have been proved to contribute to tumor suppression by induction of
cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis [4]. Cell cycle re-activation also can be
induced in neural cells by cerebral ischemia–reperfusion (I/R), and
constitutes a critical step in the neuronal death and neuroglial cell
proliferation [5–7]. However, the internal and external factors involved

in the regulation of cerebral I/R-induced neural cell cycle re-entry
remain to be elucidated.
Some miRs have been proved to be involved in neural cell cycle reentry in central nervous system degenerative disorders. MiR-26b,
upregulated in Alzheimer's disease, activates cell cycle entry, tau phosphorylation, and apoptosis in postmitotic neurons [8]. MiRs also participate in regulating neural progenitor proliferation and differentiation,
miR-1290 favors mitotic exit and differentiation of human neural progenitors through altering the cell cycle proteins [9], and miR-15b promotes neurogenesis and inhibits neural progenitor proliferation by
directly repressing ten–eleven translocation 3 during early neocortical
development [10]. For stroke, miR-424 overexpression lessened the ischemic brain injury through suppressing microglia activation by translational depression of key activators of G1/S transition [11].
In our previous miR expression proﬁle of circulating lymphocytes
from ischemic stroke patients by Agilent Human miRNA array, we
found that 70 miRs were downregulated and 35 miRs were upregulated
(data not shown). Among the top ﬁve downregulated miRs, the miR99a level in the plasma of acute stroke patients was further conﬁrmed
to be signiﬁcantly decreased by real-time RT-PCR, which attracted our

its role in a mouse model of focal cerebral I/R, as well as in oxidative
stress-induced cell cycle activation and neuronal apoptosis in neuro2a cells.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Quantitation of plasma miR-99a expression by real-time PCR

subjects (n = 7) were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and normalized to the

attention. MiR-99a has been proved to suppress tumorigenicity [12–18],
and mTOR pathway has been linked to miR-99a-induced G1 arrest
[16–18]. In addition, miR-99a exerts pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic
effects respectively in tumor cells and ischemic cardiomyocytes [19,
20]. However, the clinical signiﬁcance and function of miR-99a in ischemic stroke and neural cell cycle activation are unknown. Given the relationship between cell cycle re-activation and subsequent neuronal
apoptosis, as well as that miR-99a could induce G1 arrest, this study investigated the clinical relevance of miR-99a in acute stroke patients, and

Plasma from stroke patients (N = 11) and health control subjects
(N = 7) was isolated as previously described [11]. Quantitative realtime PCR was performed to measure miR-99a level in the plasma.
Total RNA was extracted from plasma using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using the
Superscript III reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
The cDNA was ampliﬁed by PCR using SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix
(Fermentas, Burlington, Canada) on a StepOne sequence detection
system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with the following
primers: has-miR-99a, 5′-CATTACTAAACCCGTAGATCCGAT-3′ (forward)
and 5′-TATGGTTGTTCTCGTCTCCTTCTC-3′ (reverse); miR-99a level was
normalized and expressed as fold change relative to that of U6.
2.2. Mouse model of focal cerebral I/R
All procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Capital Medical University and were
performed according to the principles outlined in the National Institutes

of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Male C57BL/
6J mice weighing 21–23 g were randomly assigned to one of four groups
(N = 9 each group): sham + control miRNA, middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) + control miRNA, MCAO + miR-99a agomir, and
MCAO + miR-99a antagomir. Focal ischemia was induced in mice by
MCAO for 1 h as previously described [21], followed by 24 h of reperfusion. All animals were housed in a temperature-controlled room at
25 ± 1 °C after recovery from anesthesia. Regional cerebral blood ﬂow
and blood pressure were monitored to ensure the occurrence of
ischemia. Rectal temperature was controlled at 37.0 °C ± 0.5 °C during
and after surgery with a temperature-regulated heating pad (CMA 150;
Carnegie Medicin, Stockholm, Sweden).

2.4. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
staining
Neural apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL staining. Brieﬂy, mice brain
tissues from different groups were cut to 20 μm continuous frozen
coronal sections and then detected using In Situ Cell Death Detection
Kit-POD (Roche, San Francisco, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI). Sections were observed under the ﬂuorescence microscope
(Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).

2.5. Immunoﬂuorescence staining
2.3. Intracerebroventricular injection of miRNA
Double-stranded miR-99a agomir, single-stranded miR-99a
antagomir and a nonsense control were purchased from GenePharma
(Shanghai, China). The sequences were as follows: miR-99a agomir:
5′-AACCCGUAGAUCCGAUCUUGUG-3′ (forward), 5′-CAAGAUCGGAUC
UACGGGUUU-3′ (reverse); miR-99a antagomir: 5′-CACAAGAUCGGA
UCUACGGGUU-3′. A mixture of 6 μl miRNA (100 μM) and 2 μl Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
were mixed gently and incubated at room temperature for 20 min according to the manufacturers' protocols. Then 8 μl of the mixture was
administered via right intracerebroventricular injection and the needle
was kept in place for 10 min immediately after MCAO. After 1 hour ischemia/24 hour reperfusion, the brain tissues were removed; ﬁve
2 mm-thick coronal sections were cut at 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 mm posterior
of the olfactory bulb. Infarct volume was assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining as previously described [22].

The expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) in mice brains
was assessed by immunoﬂuorescence staining as previously described
[11]. Frozen sections of cerebral cortex were incubated with the primary
antibody against CDK6 (1:50; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) at 4 °C
overnight, followed by incubation with the ﬂuorescent-labeled secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA).

2.6. Cell culture, miRNA transfection, and H2O2 treatment
Mouse neuroblastoma neuro-2a cells maintained in our laboratory
were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium with 10% (v/v)
fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin
at 37 °C and 5% CO2. When the cells reached 60%–80% conﬂuence,
miR-99a agomir, miR-99a antagomir and the negative control were
transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection
Reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. To recreate ischemic

conditions, neuro-2a cells were stimulated with 200 μM H2O2 48 h after
the transfection, and then incubated for 24 h.
2.7. Cell viability and LDH leakage assays
Neuro-2a cells were seeded on 96-well plates with eight replicates
per group. A 10-μl volume of Counting Kit 8 solution (Dojindo,
Kumamoto, Japan) was added to each well and cells were incubated
for 2 h at 37 °C. The absorbance was measured at an optical density of
450 nm. Cell viability in the control group was set as 100%. LDH leakage
in the cell culture supernatant was evaluated with the LDH Cytotoxicity
Assay Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's
protocol.

3.2. MiR-99a alleviates ischemia injury in MCAO mice
To evaluate the role of miR-99a in cerebral I/R injury, miR-99a
agomir and antagomir were respectively injected into the lateral ventricle of mice following MCAO. The infarct volume was reduced by approximately 20% in MCAO mice treated with miR-99a agomir as compared to
untreated MCAO mice. On the contrary, miR-99a antagomir aggravated
ischemic injury of MCAO mice with an increasing infarct volume
(P b 0.05; Fig. 3A). In situ TUNEL staining showed that miR-99a agomir
also mitigated neural apoptosis in MCAO mice by 26%, whereas mice
treated with miR-99a antagomir plus MCAO presented 35% more
apoptotic cells than MCAO group (P b 0.05; Fig. 3B). These results
demonstrated the effective protection of miR-99a against ischemia
injury in MCAO mice.

2.8. Cell cycle analysis by ﬂow cytometry
Neuro-2a cells were ﬁxed with 70% ethanol for N24 h at 4 °C, then
washed with cold PBS and resuspended. After a 1-h incubation with
RNase A (20 μg/ml) at 37 °C, cells were stained with propidium iodide
(50 μg/ml). DNA content was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry on a
FACSCalibur Instrument (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The
cell cycle fraction was calculated using CellFit software (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
2.9. Western blotting
Lysates from cells or brain tissues were prepared with lysis buffer
and processed for western blotting as previously described [23].
Primary antibodies against pro-caspase-3, activated caspase-3 (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK), cyclin D1, CDK6 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA, USA), and β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA) were used at 1:1000 dilution. Primary antibody was detected
using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) for 60 min at room temperature and an
enhanced luminescence kit (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany).
Protein expression level was quantiﬁed using a digital imaging system
(UVitec, Cambridge, UK).

3.3. MiR-99a reduces hydrogen peroxide-induced injury in neuro-2a cells
To investigate the protective effects of miR-99a against ischemic injury in greater detail, neuro-2a cells were subjected to oxidative stress
injury induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). A 24 h-exposure caused
a 8% decrease in cell viability, which was mitigated by pretreatment
with miR-99a agomir (P b 0.05; Fig. 4A). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
leakage, which reﬂects the degree of cellular damage, was markedly increased by H2O2 exposure; this lesion was reversed by miR-99a overexpression in neuro-2a cells (P b 0.05; Fig. 4B). To further verify the
protection of miR-99a, neuro-2a cells were treated with miR-99a
antagomir plus H2O2 and showed signiﬁcantly worse injury than cells

2.10. Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 11.0) and are presented as mean ± SD. Mean differences were evaluated by two-way
analysis of variance and the Newman–Keuls test. Correlations were
determined with the Pearson correlation test. Mean differences were
considered statistically signiﬁcant at P b 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Plasma miR-99a is decreased in stroke patients and is correlated with
clinical parameters
MiR-99a level was observed decreasing in circulating lymphocytes
of ischemic stroke patients relative to normal subjects, according to
our previous miRNA expression proﬁle. Then a remarkable decrease of
miR-99a in plasma was further conﬁrmed by real-time PCR (P b 0.05;
Fig. 1). The correlation between miR-99a level and clinical parameters
was analyzed from blood samples (Fig. 2). A positive correlation existed
between the levels of miR-99a and the anti-atherogenic factor high density lipoprotein or its component apolipoprotein A (P b 0.05; Fig. 2A).
The miR-99a level was also positively correlated with platelet aggregation and erythrocyte sedimentation rate—two important diagnostic and
prognostic parameters of stroke (P b 0.05; Fig. 2B), and was negatively
correlated with serum albumin but not globin concentration (P b 0.05;
Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate that the miR-99a level is clinically
signiﬁcant in the context of stroke.

solely exposed to H2O2, roughly 11% decrease in cell viability and 7%
increase in LDH leakage.
To determine whether miR-99a protects neurons from apoptosis,
pro-caspase-3 and activated caspase-3 levels in neuro-2a cells were
evaluated by western blotting. It was conﬁrmed that miR-99a agomir
could effectively suppress the elevation of both pro-caspase-3 and activated caspase-3 levels induced by H2O2 (P b 0.05; Fig. 4C), while the
miR-99a antagomir did not further increasing the activated caspase-3
levels. These results conﬁrm that miR-99a protects neurons against
oxidative stress-induced injury by blocking apoptosis.

Given that cell cycle checkpoints are primarily controlled by the activity of cyclins and the interactions with their cognate CDKs, the protein levels of cyclin D1 and CDK6 were assessed by western blotting.
Exposure to H2O2 caused an upregulation of cyclin D1 expression in
neuro-2a cells; however, miR-99a agomir treatment reversed the
increase of cyclin D1 (P b 0.05; Fig. 5C). The level of CDK6 was also
decreased by miR-99a overexpression, although the difference relative
to H2O2-exposed cells was not statistically signiﬁcant (Fig. 5D). These
results suggest that miR-99a blocks oxidative stress-induced cell cycle
re-entry by suppressing cyclin D1 and CDK6 expressions.

3.4. MiR-99a inhibits hydrogen peroxide-induced S phase arrest in
neuro-2a cells by decreasing cyclin D1 and CDK6 expressions

3.5. MiR-99a inhibits cyclin D1 and CDK6 expressions in MCAO mice

To determine whether the anti-apoptotic effects of miR-99a are
exerted through modulation of cell cycle progression, neuro-2a cells
were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. H2O2 treatment prompted neuro-2a
cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase and arrested at S phase; however, this effect was eliminated by miR-99a overexpression (P b 0.001;
Fig. 5A, B).

To further verify the blockage of cell cycle progression by miR-99a in
MCAO mice, changes of cyclin D1 and CDK6 expression were detected
by western blotting. It was demonstrated that ischemia/reperfusioninduced increase of cyclin D1 and CDK6 levels were remarkably
inhibited by miR-99a agomir (P b 0.05; Fig. 6A, B). And miR-99a
antagomir promoted extra producing of CDK6 compared with MCAO
mice, which was also presented by in situ staining (P b 0.05; Fig. 6B,

C). These results further conﬁrmed the downregulation of cyclin D1 and
CDK6 by miR-99a in mice suffering cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.
4. Discussion and conclusion
This is the ﬁrst report describing the clinical signiﬁcance and
the function of miR-99a in cerebral I/R injury. We demonstrate that
miR-99a is signiﬁcantly down-regulated in the plasma of acute stroke
patients, and miR-99a level is correlated with clinical parameters that
are associated with stroke diagnosis and prognosis. Thus, miR-99a is
likely a critical factor in stroke prevention and treatment.
In order to clarify the role of miR-99a in cerebral I/R injury, miR-99a
agomir and antagomir were administered via intracerebroventricular
injection to mice subjected to transient MCAO. The neuroprotective
effect of miR-99a was demonstrated by a reduced brain infarct volume
and neural apoptosis. In vitro, miR-99a mitigated H2O2-induced oxidative injury in neuro-2a cells, evidenced by reduced LDH leakage and
increased cell viability. These results indicate that miR-99a can alleviate
oxidative stress-induced brain injury and promote neural survival
following stroke.
It has been reported that in neuronal development in Drosophila,
aberrant regulation of G1 phase regulation causes S phase entering
and lead to apoptotic induction [24]. Moreover, increasing evidence
suggests a correlation between cell cycle re-entry and neuronal apoptosis after cerebral I/R injury [5,6,25]. To determine whether the antiapoptotic effects of miR-99a are exerted through modulation of cell
cycle progression, the cell cycle of neuro-2a after miR-99a treatment

was detected by ﬂow cytometry. We found that H2O2-induced aberrant
S phase re-entry and arrested cells in S phase, and this effect was abrogated in cells miR-99a overexpression.
Since cell cycle is governed by the action of cyclin-CDK complexes,
and cyclin D-CDK4/6 participate in the regulation of G1-S phase transition, cyclin D1 level was detected to increase following cerebral ischemia, especially strong exhibit in glial cells [26]. In this study, MiR-99a
was proved to block the transition from G1 to S phase by suppressed cyclin D1 and CDK6 expressions, consistent with previous reports [12–18].
In addition, the inhibition was much more obvious in MCAO mice than
in cultured neuro-2a cells for the possible reason that the major changes
of cyclin D1 and CDK6 existed in glial cells rather than neurons.
Previous studies have shown that miR-99a exerts both pro-apoptotic
and anti-apoptotic effects in many different cell types. In head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma, miR-99a induces apoptosis and thereby suppresses tumorigenesis [27]. MiR-99a showed anti-apoptotic effects
in cardiomyocytes during heart ischemia by decreasing activated
caspase-3 expression [19]. A similar observation was made in the
present study that miR-99a suppressed both pro-caspase-3 and activated caspase-3 expressions as well as prevent neural apoptosis. However,
whether this effect was exerted through inhibition of cell cycle reactivation or by direct inhibition of caspase-3 expression requires
further investigation.
In conclusion, we found a decreased plasma level of miR-99a in
acute stroke patients, and demonstrated that miR-99a blocks aberrant
S phase re-entry and suppresses neuronal apoptosis under oxidative
stress conditions to protect neurons against cerebral I/R injury.

Additional studies are warranted to elucidate the targets of miR-99a and
establish the mechanisms underlying its neuroprotective effects, and to
explore the clinical potential of miR-99a for stroke treatment.
