Edaravone, an electron spin trapper with radical scavenging activity, has been shown to be effective in
reducing infarct volume in humans following ischemic stroke. However, concerns of edaravone-induced
renal toxicity have limited its clinical adoption. Previous work has demonstrated that edaravone produced
signiﬁcant neuroprotection when injected prior to a period of ischemia and/or reperfusion. The current
investigation was designed to determine if a newly synthesized co-drug consisting of lipoic acid and
edaravone, named UPEI-300, could produce neuroprotection in in vitro and/or an in vivo rodent model of
stroke. UPEI-300 produced dose-dependent neuroprotection in vitro and was subsequently tested in vivo.
Male rats were anaesthetized and the middle cerebral artery was occluded for 30 min followed by 5.5 h
of reperfusion (ischemia/reperfusion; I/R). Pre-administration of UPEI-300 dose-dependently decreased
infarct volume. Signiﬁcant neuroprotection was also observed when UPEI-300 (1.0 mg/kg) was injected
during the 30 min period of ischemia as well as up to 60 min following the start of reperfusion. These
results indicate that a co-drug consisting of edaravone and lipoic acid is a potent neuroprotectant, and
clinically, the use of such a novel co-drug following an ischemic stroke might maintain neuroprotection
while potentially decreasing edaravone associated renal toxicity.

1. Introduction
Worldwide mortality and disability rates due to cerebral
ischemia (stroke) remain signiﬁcant and therapeutic options continue to be limited. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other free
radicals generated during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) are
critical mediators of neuronal death [1]. Over the last decade
since the introduction of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) for thrombolytic therapy, research into antioxidants for

prevention of reperfusion injury to extend the window of opportunity for increased patient eligibility has increased dramatically.
The most potent free radical scavengers seem to be those
that incorporate electron spin trapping as a mechanism of radical
scavenging. Of these, edaravone (3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin5-one) developed by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation
(Osaka, Japan), has been shown to have tremendous potential
in preclinical trials and progressed to phase IIb clinical trials
in humans [2]. The protective effects of edaravone on cerebral
ischemia have been evaluated using rodent models of both global
and focal ischemia [3,4]. Edaravone has been demonstrated to have
anti-apoptotic and anti-necrotic effects as well [5]. In addition,
our laboratory has demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of
edaravone using a rodent model of ischemia/reperfusion [6]. Unfortunately, the success of edaravone in preclinical studies did not

translate clinically as acute kidney injury was noted as a possible
side effect associated with the use of edaravone [7]. In Japan, edaravone is still being prescribed to stroke patients and has been used
since 2001. In this population of patients, edaravone treatment has
been shown to decrease neuronal damage in patients who have
suffered an acute ischemic stroke [5,8]. Due to the possibility of
edaravone-induced renal complications, the international acceptance of edaravone as a therapeutic strategy in patients with acute
ischemic stroke has been limited.
In order to address the off-target effects of promising drugs
in development, a novel strategy has emerged whereby two or
more drugs are combined at low doses to provide therapeutic efﬁcacy while potentially limiting toxicity. Lipoic acid (LA) is a safe
(non-toxic) antioxidant with strong free radical scavenging abilities
[11], and many researchers have demonstrated the neuroprotective
properties of LA administration in several different animal models of stroke including I/R [12,13]. Further, the co-administration
of LA with other compounds has been shown to have a greater
protective effect compared to either drug alone when tested in several different animal models of pathology [14–18]. In addition, the
development and administration of co-drugs containing lipoic acid
(LA) covalently linked to another therapeutic drug, has been shown
to have a greater overall positive effect compared to the injection of
a solution containing a mixture of the two drugs [9,10]. To the best
of our knowledge, our laboratory has the only published results
demonstrating the neuroprotective properties of co-drug administration following I/R injury [19] where LA was covalently bound to
apocynin. The hypothesis is that the successful therapeutic use of
a co-drug would allow for decreased amount of each component
individually, thereby decreasing the likelihood of drug associated
side-effects. This study seeks to develop a new co-drug that is
a covalent conjugate between LA and edaravone (named UPEI300). It is our intention to determine if UPEI-300 can produce an
equivalent level of neuroprotection as we have previously reported
following the administration of edaravone alone (10 mg/kg; [6]),
but at lower doses, thereby potentially decreasing the likelihood of
edaravone-associated side effects.

2. Materials and methods
All in vivo and in vitro experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care
and were approved by the University of Prince Edward Island Animal Care Committee.

2.1. UPEI-300 synthesis
To a stirred solution of 1.5 mM edaravone (Sigma–Aldrich;
St. Louis, MO, USA) in 20 ml acetonitrile, was added 10% mmol
dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and 0.5 mmol lipoic acid (LA;
Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide
(DCC) was added to the reaction mixture at 0 ◦ C under nitrogen (N2 )
which was then stirred for 5 min at 0 ◦ C and 5 h at 20 ◦ C. Precipitated
urea was then ﬁltered off and the ﬁltrate evaporated down in vacuo.
The residue was taken up in methyl chloride (CH2 Cl2 ) and, if necessary, ﬁltered free of any further precipitated urea. The solvent
was removed by evaporation and the crude compound was puriﬁed by collecting ﬁrst fraction on a silica column chromatography
(Rf :0.87). The eluent used was hexanes:ethylacetate (3:7):yellow
oil. The yield was 43%. The NMR coupling constants are as follows:
1 H NMR (300 MHz, acetone) ı 7.64–7.57 (2H, m), 7.53–7.45 (2H, m),
7.38–7.31 (1H, m), 3.58 (1H, dq, J = 8.6, 6.3 Hz, 1H), 3.25–306 (2H,
m), 2.65 (2H, t, J = 7.3 Hz,), 2.55–2.39 (1H, m), 2.24 (3H, s), 1.96–1.81
(1H, m), 1.80–1.55 (4H, m), 1.51–1.39 (2H, m).

2.2. In vitro cell culture
Mixed neocortical cultures, containing both neurons and glia,
were prepared from fetal rats at 17–18 days gestation. Brieﬂy,
embryonic tissue was extracted from untimed pregnant SpragueDawley rats by cesarean section and transferred to ice-cold Hanks
balanced salt solution (HBSS; Invitrogen, Burlington, ON). Cortical
brain tissue was carefully isolated by ﬁne dissection using aseptic techniques. Cortices were minced in cold HBSS using a sterile
razor blade prior to digestion with 0.0125% trypsin. Dissociated
cells were plated in poly-l-lysine (1 mg/ml) coated 96 well plates at
a seeding density of 45,000 cells/well in warm Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed
Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON) containing 10% ironsupplemented bovine calf serum (HyClone, Ottawa, ON) and 1%
antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON). Cultures were
allowed to adhere overnight in a humidiﬁed 37 ◦ C incubator having
5% CO2 and atmospheric oxygen. The following day, the media was
replaced with warmed Neurobasal A medium containing 0.5 mM
l-glutamine (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON) and supplemented with
1% B27, N2 and antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON).
Half-volume media changes were made every 4 days thereafter
with experiments being carried out on 14–16 day old cultures.
2.3. Oxygen–glucose-deprivation (OGD)
After 14 days in culture, the medium was replaced with deoxygenated unsupplemented glucose-free Neurobasal A containing
UPEI-300 (25, 50, 100, 250, 500 ␮M). Control wells contained
glucose-free medium plus vehicle (0.1% EtOH). Cultures were transferred to a humidiﬁed 37 ◦ C incubator having 5% CO2 , 1.1% O2 and
balanced N2 for a period of 24 h. Following OGD, culture media
was replaced with normal supplemented Neurobasal A containing identical drug concentrations and maintained in routine culture
conditions (5% CO2 and atmospheric oxygen) for an additional 24 h.
Control cultures were prepared in separate plates having supplemented Neurobasal A and maintained in 5% CO2 and atmospheric
oxygen for the duration of the experiment. Control plates underwent media changes as described above to control for handling
effects on cell viability.
2.4. Cytotoxicity assay
At the end of the experiment, cell injury was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released from damaged cells
into the culture medium (Cytoscan assay, G Biosciences). LDH measurements represent the average of 4–5 replicate treatments/plate
in 6 separate experiments. The effect of OGD and drug treatments
on LDH was expressed as a percent of LDH release compared to
OGD and vehicle groups. Treatments were compared using a oneway ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc analysis. Differences
were considered signiﬁcant if p < 0.05.
2.5. General in vivo surgical procedures
All experiments were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats
(250–350 g; Charles River; Montreal, PQ, CAN). For all animals, food
and tap water were available ad libitum. Rats were anesthetized
with sodium thiobutabarbital (Inactin; Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA; 100 mg/kg; ip) which provided a stable plane of anesthesia for the full duration of the experiment. For intravenous
administration of drugs, a polyethylene catheter (PE-10; Clay
Adams, Parsippany, NJ, USA) was inserted into the right femoral
vein. An endotracheal tube was inserted to facilitate breathing.
Body temperature was monitored and maintained at 37 ± 1 ◦ C using
a feedback system (Physitemp Instruments, Clifton, NJ, USA).

2.6. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
We have previously published the detailed methodology for
transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery [6]. Brieﬂy, animals were placed in a David Kopf stereotaxic frame (Tujunga,
CA, USA) and the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) approached
through a rostro-caudal incision of the skin and frontalis muscle
at the approximate level of bregma. Blood ﬂow through the MCA
was impeded for 30 min by the placement of surgical suture behind
the MCA at 3 designated positions along the exposed vessel. The
sutures were positioned so that the middle of each suture applied
pressure to the underside of the MCA and impeded blood ﬂow
(ischemia) as previously conﬁrmed using laser Doppler ﬂowmetry
(OxyFlo, Oxford-Optronix, Oxford, UK [6]). This 3-point placement
of surgical sutures produced a highly reproducible and consistent
focal ischemic lesion restricted to the prefrontal cerebral cortex.
Blood ﬂow was allowed to return to the area (reperfusion) for an
additional 5.5 h following the removal of the sutures.

vehicle-treated controls and expressed as a percent cytotoxicity. Each bar represents
the mean ± S.E.M. for 6 separate experiments with 4–5 replicate treatments/plate.
Asterisk denotes signiﬁcant difference from vehicle-treated OGD group (p ≤ 0.05).

2.7. Drug preparation
UPEI-300 stock solutions (10 mg/ml) were prepared in 100%
ethanol. Physiological saline (0.9% sodium chloride) was used for
all further dilutions of UPEI-300. All dilutions used in the in vivo
studies contained a ﬁnal concentration of 50% ethanol, and thus we
used a 50% v/v ethanol solution as our vehicle control.
2.8. Effect of UPEI-300 on ischemia/reperfusion-induced infarct
volume
UPEI-300 (0.001 (n = 5), 0.01 (n = 6), 0.1 (n = 6), 1.0 (n = 6) all in
mg/kg in1 ml/kg; i.v.) or vehicle (50% ethanol and 50% physiological
saline); (1 ml/kg; i.v.; n = 5) was administered 30 min prior to the
onset of MCAO. The sutures were left in place for 30 min, followed
by 5.5 h of reperfusion (I/R).
To determine if UPEI-300 was neuroprotective when administered during the 30 min period of occlusion, injections of UPEI-300
at a dose which produced optimal neuroprotection based on the
dose–response-curve described above (1.0 mg/kg; i.v.; n = 4) was
injected 15 min following the onset of MCAO. After a further 15 min,
the sutures were removed to allow for an additional 5.5 h of reperfusion.
To examine the effect of UPEI-300 when administered during
reperfusion, injections of the optimal dose of UPEI-300 used above
(1.0 mg/kg; i.v.; n = 4) were made at the end of the 30 min of MCAO
(immediately prior to suture removal). In other groups, injections of
UPEI-300 were made 30 min (n = 5), 60 min (n = 5) or 90 min (n = 5)
following suture removal. In all cases, the experiments were terminated following 5.5 h of reperfusion.
2.9. Effect of UPEI-300 on 6 h ischemia-induced infarct volume
To determine if UPEI-300 was neuroprotective on ischemiainduced cell death only (no reperfusion), injections of UPEI-300
(1.0 mg/kg; n = 5) or vehicle (50% ethanol; 1 ml/kg; i.v.; n = 5) were
made 30 min prior to MCAO. The experiments were terminated at
the end of 6 h of occlusion (pMCAO).
2.10. Histological procedures
At the end of each experiment, in which infarct volume was
measured, animals were transcardially perfused with phosphate
buffered saline (0.1 M; 200 mL), the brains removed and sliced into
1 mm coronal sections using a rat brain matrix (Harvard Apparatus; Holliston, MA, USA). Sections were incubated in a 2% solution of
2,3,5-triphenol tetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis,

MO, USA) for 5 min. Infarct volumes were calculated with the use
of scanned digital images of each brain section. The infarct area for
both sides of each brain section was calculated using a computerassisted imaging system (Scion Corporation; Frederick, MD, USA).
The infarct areas for each side for each individual section were averaged and multiplied by the width of each section (1 mm) to give
the infarct volume for each section. The sum total of all individual
infarct volumes in slices provided the infarct volume for each rat.
2.11. Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using a statistical software package (SigmaStat and SigmaPlot; Jandel Scientiﬁc, Tujunga, CA). All data are
presented as a mean ± standard error of the mean (S.E.M). Differences were considered statistically signiﬁcant if p ≤ 0.05 by an
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Bonferroni post hoc
analysis. When only two groups were being compared, the Student’s t-test was used.
3. Results
3.1. Effect of UPEI-300 in vitro
The ﬁrst experiment undertaken following the synthesis of
UPEI-300 was to test the compound in vitro. UPEI-300 was tested
in mixed neocortical cultures in an OGD paradigm involving 24 h
of OGD followed by 24 h of normoxic culture. LDH release was signiﬁcantly decreased when cells were cultured in the presence of
50 (22 ± 4%), 100 (20 ± 3%), 250 (25 ± 3%) and 500 (35 ± 3%) mmol
UPEI-300 (p ≤ 0.05; Fig. 1) throughout the OGD regimen.
3.2. Effect of UPEI-300 on infarct volume
With the success of the in vitro experiments, UPEI-300 was
then tested in a rodent model of I/R-induced injury. In this
study, we determined that UPEI-300 produced dose-dependent
neuroprotection against neuronal cell death in a rodent model
of ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury. The pre-administration of
UPEI-300, 30 min prior to a 30 min period of MCAO produced a
dose-dependent relationship between the dose of UPEI-300 and
infarct volume (Fig. 2A). Of the four doses tested, 1.0 mg/kg resulted
in signiﬁcant neuroprotection compared to vehicle (p ≤ 0.05;
Fig. 2A). However, UPEI-300 did not produce neuroprotection when
administered prior to a 6 h permanent occlusive stroke (no reperfusion; p ≥ 0.05; Fig. 2B).

signiﬁcant difference (p ≤ 0.05) from the vehicle control group.

The optimal dose of UPEI-300 from Fig. 2A (1.0 mg/kg) was
administered either during the 30 min of MCAO occlusion or following the return of blood ﬂow (reperfusion). Administration of
UPEI-300 (1.0 mg/kg) 15 min following the onset of MCAO (15 min
prior to the start of reperfusion) resulted in signiﬁcant neuroprotection when compared to the administration of vehicle (p ≤ 0.05;
Fig. 2C). Administration of UPEI-300 (1.0 mg/kg) at time 0 (start
of reperfusion), 30 and 60 min following the start of reperfusion
resulted in signiﬁcant decreases in infarct volume compared to
vehicle administration (p ≤ 0.05 at each time point; Fig. 2C). Administration of UPEI-300 90 min following suture removal did not result
in a signiﬁcant difference in infarct volume compared to the administration of vehicle (p ≥ 0.05; Fig. 2C).
4. Discussion
Oxidative stress associated with excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a fundamental mechanism of brain
damage in reperfusion injury following ischemic stroke [1,21]. The
multiplicity of mechanisms involved in ischemia- and reperfusioninduced neuronal damage following an occlusive stroke remains
an obstacle in providing treatment in clinical settings [22]. Drugs
targeting more than one mechanism of action could potentially
overcome this dilemma. The synthesis and development of codrugs using biologically relevant molecules as building blocks
provides the ability to simultaneously target multiple pathways
involved in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, speciﬁcally,
pathways involved in the initiation of oxidative stress-induced

neuronal damage following reperfusion. In addition, the use of codrugs might potentially decrease the chance of single drug induced
side effects as lower doses of the individual drug constituents
would be necessary.
The protective effect of edaravone on brain ischemia has been
measured using several different models of focal ischemia in
rodents with or without reperfusion. Using the same model of
focal I/R-damage as presented in this publication, our laboratory
has previously demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of edaravone [6]. Other studies have also demonstrated, using a global
or hemispheric ischemia model, that edaravone facilitated the
recovery of electrocorticograms and attenuated hemispheric cerebral edema [3,4]. Further, following transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion in rats, post-ischemic administration of edaravone
decreased reperfusion-induced cerebral edema [23] by suppressing
reperfusion-induced oxidative neuronal damage [3,24].
Edaravone, used on its own, has been shown to decrease
ischemic neuronal damage in humans who have suffered from
acute ischemic stroke [5,8] but because of potential edaravone associated acute kidney injury [7], its therapeutic use has been limited.
Some recent evidence has indicated that acute kidney injury may in
fact not be due to edaravone administration but may be due to the
age and general physical health of the patients, and, edaravone may
even decrease the risk of acute kidney injury irrespective of baseline renal malfunctions [25]. In any case, the use of a co-drug such as
UPEI-300 at low doses may produce the same level of neuroprotection with less potential of acute kidney injury. In the present study,
UPEI-300 tested in vitro in mixed neocortical cultures exposed to

B.J. Connell et al. / Neuroscience Letters 561 (2014) 151–155

OGD and in vivo in a rodent model of cerebral I/R-induced injury
produced signiﬁcant neuronal protection. Further, the dose of UPEI300 required to produce signiﬁcant neuroprotection (1.0 mg/kg)
was 5 fold less compared to the doses required of either edaravone or lipoic acid on their own when examined in the same
rodent model of I/R [6,12]. Interestingly, UPEI-300 did not produce neuroprotection when administered prior to a 6 h permanent
occlusive stroke. This result supports the suggestion that UPEI-300
produced neuroprotection against reperfusion injury alone, perhaps via decreasing ROS production, as ROS-induced growth of
infarct volume due to reperfusion injury has been demonstrated
by many labs (see review [20]).
In order to more closely mimic the clinical situation where a
patient would present to a hospital during a stroke, the optimal
dose of UPEI-300 from the initial dose–response-curve (1.0 mg/kg)
was administered either during the 30 min of MCAO or following
the return of blood ﬂow (reperfusion). Neuroprotection observed
when a therapeutic dose is administered during the cerebral occlusion or following the return of blood ﬂow is of critical importance,
as such results indicate a potential expansion of the therapeutic
window of eligibility for a patient to receive rTPA therapy.
Chemical combinations of LA with other compounds have been
demonstrated to provide neuroprotective effects greater than the
two compounds administered on their own. Covalent linkage of
LA with ibuprofen has been demonstrated to be neuroprotective
in rodent models of Alzheimer’s disease where administration of
the co-drug decreased the oxidative damage due to the infusion
of A␤ (1–40) [22]. In addition, a co-drug produced by chemically
linking LA with l-dopa or dopamine decreased neuronal oxidative
damage associated with the administration of l-dopa or dopamine
on their own [26]. In addition, our lab has presented results which
have demonstrated that LA covalently bound to apocynin attenuated neuronal damage due to oxidative stress in a rodent model
of ischemia/reperfusion [26]. The addition of edaravone into the
library of compounds which have been covalently linked to lipoic
acid and which have been demonstrated to have beneﬁcial effects
in animal models of neuronal damage may provide further evidence
that co-drug therapy might gain acceptance for clinical use.
In conclusion, despite the development of over 1000 compounds
for the treatment of stroke, many proving effective in animal models, none have proven effective in the multitude of clinical trials
conducted [27]. The need to develop an effective, acute treatment
for stroke without the threat of potentially fatal side effects remains
paramount. Providing effective pharmacological treatment immediately following an acute stroke to lessen the cerebral damage
remains an elusive goal. Therefore, novel co-drugs such as UPEI-300
may present strong therapeutic opportunities to protect against the
negative sequelae of stroke.
