Abstract We aimed to evaluate whether adipose-derived
mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) that were transplanted
via internal carotid can improve the neurological function
after acute ischemic stroke and explore the underlying
mechanisms. Total 40 adult Sprague–Dawley rats were
subjected to transient (1.5 h) middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAo) to induce ischemia/reperfusion injury.
These rats were randomly divided into two groups with 20
ones in each group, which were intracarotid-injected with
autologous ADMSCs (2.0 9 106) and saline (control) at
day 3 after MCAo, respectively. Behavioral tests (adhesive-removal and modified neurological severity score)
were performed before and after MCAo. Histology was
used to evaluate the ischemia lesion volume and pathological changes. The apoptosis and astroglial reactivity
were determined by TUNEL and glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP) staining, respectively. Besides, we applied
immunofluorescence to identify the distribution of ADMSCs and the neural makers (NeuN and GFAP) expressed
by them under confocal microscope. Significant improvement of neurological deficits was observed in rats transplanted with ADMSCs when compared to controls. But
there was no obvious difference on ischemia lesion volume
between these two groups. The injected ADMSCs migrated
to the brain infarct region and mainly localized in the
ischemic core and boundary zone of the lesion, which can
express NeuN and GFAP in the brain. In addition, autologous transplantation of ADMSCs significantly attenuated

astroglial reactivity, inhibited cellular apoptosis and promoted cellular proliferation. Our data indicated that intracarotid transplantation of autologous ADMSCs had the
potential therapeutic application for ischemic stroke.

1 Introduction
Ischemic stroke (IS) occurs when an artery to the brain is
blocked, resulting in a permanent neurological damage. It
is the third leading cause of mortality in the majority of
developed countries and is a leading health burden in all
developed countries [1]. At present time, thrombolysis with
recombinant tissue plasminogen-activator inhibitor (t-PA)
is the only approved treatment for IS [2]. However, the
value of t-PA is limited to time that it is useful only within
3 h after acute IS onset [3]. Besides, the IS patients resulted
by hemorrhage must first be excluded. Even among
patients fortunate enough to receive thrombolytic therapy,
60 % show little or no improvement in outcome. Consequently, only few patients (about 1–2 %) benefit from this
intervention [4, 5]. Therefore, it is urgently needed to
develop an effective therapeutic method for patients
with IS.
Cytotherapy has recently emerged as an attractive and
promising new therapeutic option for the treatment of
various ischemia-related disorders, such as cardiovascular
disease and stroke [6, 7]. Although neural embryonic stem
cells transplantation is a promising treatment for brain
injury and brain ischemia, its clinical use is restricted due
to the major logistic and ethical barriers. So, mesenchymal
stem cells from bone marrow (BMSCs), containing pluripotent precursor cells that are capable to differentiate into
neural cells, can be a considerable source for cytotherapy
[8]. In fact, BMSCs transplantation effectively prevented

123

1358

the progression of neurological signs and symptoms in
some functional studies [9–11]. However, they may only be
obtained by bone marrow biopsy, a potentially painful
procedure yielding low number of cells. It is hypothesized
that similar multipotent stromal cells exist in tissue sites
outside the bone marrow microenvironment.
Adipose tissue, like bone marrow, is derived from the
embryonic mesoderm and contains a heterogeneous stromal
cell population [12]. The stem cell populations can be harvested from adipose tissue, named adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs). Previous studies indicated that
stem and progenitor cells from adult adipose stromal tissue
retain the capacity to differentiate into neuron-like cells
expressing neuronal markers [13, 14]. Moreover, Kang et al.
[15] reported that ADMSCs migrated to various parts of the
brain after directly transplanted into the lateral ventricle of the
IS rats induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo),
and significantly improved functional deficits. Intra-venous
transplantation of ADMSCs also relieved the neurological
deficit in rats subjected to MCAo [16]. However, intracarotid
autologous administration of ADMSCs has seldom been
discussed, even if some studies on intracarotid transplantation of BMSCs for stroke have been reported [17–19].
In the present study, we investigated whether the
autologous ADMSCs intracarotid-transplanted in IS rats
which were induced by MCAo can survive, migrate and
differentiate into neuron-like cells in the brain to ameliorate neurological deficit after stroke. Meanwhile we
explored the possible mechanisms contributing to neurologic functional recovery.

2 Materials and methods
2.1 Animals
Total 40 pathogen-free, adult male Sprague–Dawley (SD)
rats weighing 300–350 g (Experimental Animal Centre,
General Hospital of Shenyang Military Region) were
applied in this study. They were kept under standard laboratory conditions with free access to food and water. All
animal procedures were approved by the animal ethics
committee of the General Hospital of Shenyang Military
Region.
2.2 ADMSCs isolation and characterization
We isolated the ADMSCs before the induction of middle
cerebral artery occlusion according to the previous method
[20] with some modifications. Briefly, adipose tissue surrounding the epididymis was carefully dissected and excised
which was then digested by collagenase type I (0.1 %, Sigma)
for 60 min at 37 °C with intermittent shaking. The floating

123

J Mater Sci: Mater Med (2014) 25:1357–1366

adipocytes were separated from the stromal-vascular fraction
by centrifuging at 600 g for 5 min and re-suspended with
DMEM (dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium). Foreign
matter was removed by filtering through 100 lm nylon. The
pre-adipocytes were plated in tissue culture dishes (BD falcon) at 8000-10,000 cells/cm2 in DMEM supplemented with
10 % fetal calf serum. After cultivated for 24 h at 37 °C in
5 % CO2, the unattached cells were removed and the adherent
cells were expanded by serial passage. Cells were collected at
the fifth passage and analyzed by flow cytometry for murine
specific monoclonal antibodies against CD31, CD34, CD29,
CD44, CD90, and CD45 (Becton–Dickinson Biosciences,
San Diego, CA, USA).
2.3 ADMSCs labeling before autologous
transplantation for in vivo tracking
One day prior to ADMSCs transplantation, CM-Dil (CellTrackerTM CM-DiI; C7001, 50 lg/vial), which was
homogenized into CM-solutions at concentration of 4 lg/ml,
was added into the culture medium. The labeled cells were
analyzed using fluorescence microscope.
2.4 Animal model of middle cerebral artery occlusion
All 40 SD rats were subjected to transient (1.5 h) MCAo and
divided randomly into two groups: (1) Intracarotid artery
transplantation of saline after MCAo (n = 20); (2) Intracarotid transplantation of ADMSCs after MCAo (n = 20).
The transient MCAo was performed by using the intraluminal suture technique as described previously [21] with
several modifications. Briefly, rats were initially anesthetized with chloral hydrate intraperitoneally (350 mg/kg body
weight). The rectal temperature was controlled at 37 °C with
a feedback regulated water heating system. Then the common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA) and
internal carotid artery (ICA) on the left side were carefully
exposed via a midline cervical incision under an operating
microscope. The ECA was ligated with a 4-0 silk suture
(10 mm from the bifurcation) and the CCA was temporarily
clamped with a microsurgical clip. A silicon rubber-coated
round-tip nylon surgical thread was inserted into the ICA
(approximately 18 mm from the bifurcation) via a small
puncture in the ECA to occlude the origin of the middle
cerebral artery. A silk suture around the ECA was tightened
to prevent bleeding from the puncture site, and the clip was
removed. After 90 min, reperfusion was performed by
withdrawing the suture.
2.5 ADMSCs transplantation
Intracarotid injection of ADMSCs was carried out 3 days
after induction of MCAo. A modified polyethylene catheter

J Mater Sci: Mater Med (2014) 25:1357–1366

1359

(PE-50, Becton–Dickinson, Sparks, MD, US) was inserted
into the ECA through the puncture with its tip placed at the
level of the bifurcation. Immediately after inserting of the
catheter, approximately 2 9 106 ADMSCs suspended in
1 ml saline were slowly transplanted through the catheter
over a period of 10 min (ADMSCs group). The rats in
saline group underwent the same procedure but were
infused with 1 ml saline alone. All rats were killed at
28 days after induction of MCAo.

2.6.1 Modified neurologic severity scores (mNSS)
Table 1 shows a set of modified neurologic severity scores
used to grade neurologic function [22]. The neurologic
severity score is consisted of motor (muscle status,
abnormal movement), sensory (visual, tactile, and proprioceptive), balance and reflex tests. In the severity scores of
injury, one point is awarded for the inability to perform the
tasks correctly or for the lack of a tested reflex. The higher
the score the more severe the injury is.

2.6 Behavioral test
2.6.2 Adhesive-removal somatosensory test
A series of behavioral tests were performed for every rat to
evaluate the neurological function before MCAo and at 1,
7, 14, 21 and 28 days after MCAo by an investigator who
was blinded to the grouping.

Somatosensory test was performed both before and after
MCAo [23]. Two small pieces of adhesive-backed paper
dots (113.1 mm2) were used as bilateral tactile stimuli
occupying the distal-radial region on the wrist of each
forelimb. Then the rat was returned to its home-cage. The
time to remove each stimulus from the limb was recorded
at five trials per day. Individual trials were separated by at
least 5 min. Once the rats were able to remove the dots
within 10 s, they were subjected to MCAo.
2.7 Histological assessment
The brains were fixed by 4 % paraformaldehyde and
embedded in paraffin, which were then sectioned into seven
equally spaced (2 mm) coronal sections. A series of adjacent
5-lm thickness sections were cut from each section in the
coronal plane and stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E). The sections were traced using the Global Lab Image
analysis system (Data Translation, Malboro, MA, USA).
Each H&E stained section was evaluated at 2.59 magnification. The area of infarction and the area of both hemispheres (mm2) were calculated by tracing the area on the
computer screen. The indirect lesion area, in which the intact
area of the ipsilateral hemisphere was subtracted from the
area of the contralateral hemisphere, was calculated as [24].
The infarct volume was presented as the percentage of the
lesion volume in the contralateral hemisphere. The H&E
staining sections were observed by light microscopy to
identify the histopathology changes in the brain of rats.
2.8 Immunohistochemical assessment
The paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinated and then
incubated with polyclonal antibody against glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP) (DAKO, 1:2000) or monoclonal antibody (1:200 dilution) against 5-Bromo-2-DeoxyUridine
(BrdU) (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. HRP conjugated antimouse IgG were used as the secondary antibody. Finally, diaminobenzidine was used as a chromogen for light microscopy. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.

123

1360

For detection of cell proliferation, BrdU (50 mg/kg, iv.,
Sigma-Aldrich) was injected every second day immediately after transplantation for a total of 12 days.
2.9 Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nickend labeling (TUNEL) staining
TUNEL staining was performed in the paraffin-embedded
sections using an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, POD (Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells displaying brown staining
within the nucleus were counted as TUNEL-positive cells.

J Mater Sci: Mater Med (2014) 25:1357–1366

behavioral test, repeated-measures ANOVA analysis was
used to determine the difference between groups. The
analysis began with testing for the group-time interaction at
the 0.05 level followed by testing the group effect at each
time point. Differences in infarct volume, TUNEL, immunohistochemistry and expression of neurotropic factors
were analyzed by student’s-test. P value less than 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

3 Results
3.1 Characterization of ADMSCs

2.10 Immunofluorescence assessment
Sections were treated with anti-neuronal nuclear (NeuN,
Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and anti-glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP, Sigma) antibodies. After being rinsed in
PBS, the sections were incubated with a fluorescent second
antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H?L),
A11001) for 1 h at room temperature and observed under
fluorescent microscope (Olympus, BH-2). The primary
sections were stained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) (dilution 1/500) (Sigma) to identify the number and
distribution of CM-labeled ADMSCs.
Colocalization of CM-DiI with neuronal marker or
DAPI was performed by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Green (FITC for NeuN or GFAP) and red (CM-Dil)
fluorochromes on the sections were excited by a laser beam
at 488 and 553 nm and subsequently emissions were
acquired with 2 separate photomultiplier tubes through 519
and 570 nm emission filters, respectively.
2.11 Quantification
To determine the number of positive cells, five discontinuous sections were analyzed from every specimen. The
number of positive cells inside or around the ischemic areas
was analyzed at eight random high-power fields in each
section and those data were averaged. CM-positive cells
were counted within a rectangular region (800 9 600 lm2)
placed on the estimated ischemic core and peri-infarct area
of the cortex and striatum in the ischemic and contralateral
hemispheres in a fixed manner for each rat. A total of 500
CM-Dil positive cells per animal from multiple sections
were counted to obtain the percentage of CM-Dil cells
colocalized with cell-type-specific markers (NeuN and
GFAP) by double staining.

Within 2–3 passages after the primary culture, ADMSCs
appeared as a monolayer of large, flat cells (25–30 lm in
diameter). As the cells approached confluence, they
assumed a more spindle-shaped, fibroblastic morphology.
Flow cytometry analysis of the ADMSCs at passages 3–5
showed that they were positive for surface antigens CD29,
CD44, and CD90 while negative for CD31 and CD34 and
CD45 (Fig. 1).
3.2 Functional outcomes and infarct volume
All rats subjected to MCAo showed obvious behavioral
deficit over time to 28 days after surgery. The rats treated
with ADMSCs displayed markedly lower adhesiveremoval times and NSS scores at each time point from day
14 to day 28 after MCAo when compared to the rats treated
with saline (Fig. 2a, b).
The infarct volume of rats treated with ADMSCs and
saline at 28 days after MCAo was 35.5 ± 11.9 % and
36.9 ± 9.1 %, respectively. There was no significant difference on infarct volume between these two groups
(Fig. 2c).
3.3 Effect of ADMSCs on histological changes
The changes of histopathology in the ischemic regions
were investigated by H&E staining. Under photomicroscope, the rats in saline group showed obvious damages,
such as loss of neuronal cell and pyknosis of nucleus,
whereas, these damages were markedly reduced in rats
treated with ADMSCs (Fig. 3).

saline group (Fig. 4), which suggested the reduction of
gliosis resulted by cerebral ischemia after treatment by
ADMSCs. We also examined the neuronal apoptosis in the
ischemic regions by TUNEL staining. Data demonstrated
that ADMSCs treatment remarkably decreased the number

of apoptotic cells (Fig. 5). IHC staining also revealed a
clearly increased number of BrdU-positive cells in ADMSCs group compared to saline group (Fig. 6), implying
an increased cellular proliferation after treatment by
ADMSCs.

the ischemic core and boundary zone, while relatively few cells
were observed in the contralateral hemisphere (Fig. 7a).
3.6 Transplanted ADMSCs express neural makers
To detect whether the transplanted ADMSCs expressed
neural makers, cerebral sections were immunostained with
GFAP and NeuN and then analyzed by laser-scanning
confocal microscope. The number of CM-labeled cells in
ipsilateral hemisphere (21,853 ± 3,225) was larger than
that in contralateral hemisphere (119 ± 28, P \ 0.05) at
28 days after MCAo. Confocal micrograph showed that
approximately 3.3 ± 1.6 % of CM-labeled cells expressed
GFAP (astrocytes) and 1.5 ± 0.8 % expressed NeuN
(neurons) (Fig. 7b, c).

21 and 28 days after MCAo. c Infarct volume (%) was analyzed at
day 28 after MCAo. Data are expressed as mean ± SD

3.5 Identification of ADMSCs in recipients
ADMSCs were distributed throughout the ischemic regions in
the MCA territory and occurred in multiple areas of the ipsilateral
hemisphere at the level of bregma (-1, ?1) of the cortices, as
well as the rostral-caudal axis of the striatum of the ipsilateral
hemisphere. Most (*90 %) CM-labeled cells were localized in

123

This study demonstrated that ADMSCs could survive and
migrate in the brain after intracarotid administration, a
small number of which differentiated into neuron-like cells.
Meanwhile ADMSCs exerted anti-gliosis, anti-apoptosis
and pro-proliferate effects in the region of cerebral ischemia that significantly improved the behavioral performance
of IS rats.
The mNSS and adhesive-removal somatosensory test
revealed that ADMSCs could significantly improve neurological deficits in rats after acute IS. Progressive
improvement in neurological function was observed from
day 3 and became significant on day 14 between ADMSCs
group and saline group. Confocal microscope data showed
that ADMSCs migrated primarily to the ischemic core and
boundary zone of the lesion. A higher proportion of ADMSCs was observed in injured cortex than in intact cortex,
which was consistent with the results from intra-arterial
injection of bone marrow cells into rats subjected to cerebral ischemia [17]. Specific molecular signals, such as
stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCR4), adhesion
molecules (selectins and integrins) and proteases have been
reported to be involved in the interaction of MSCs to reach,
recognize, and function in cerebral ischemic tissue [25, 26].
Therefore, we inferred that ischemia-induced chemotactic
factors may also be one of the reasons behind the selective
migration of ADMSCs into the lesion region in present
study.
An obviously increased number of BrdU-positive cells
were observed in rats treated with ADMSCs, indicating an
increased cellular proliferation after ADMSCs therapy.
Similarly, Leu et al. [16] also demonstrated that intravenous-injected ADMSCs could promote cellular proliferation after acute IS. However, more than 80 % of newly
formed neurons were reported to die while they migrated

Fig. 7 Immunofluorescence assessment. a Identification of ADMSCs
in the brain of recipient rats by CM-Dil and DAPI double positive
cells (409). Confocal micrographs show that CM-labeled ADMSCs

express neuronal antigenic marker NeuN (a) and astrocytic antigenic
marker GFAP (409)

toward the ischemic parenchyma, most likely due to the
unfavorable conditions including lack of trophic support
and exposure to by-products of damaged tissue, and ultimately only 0.2 % of nonviable ischemic neurons were
replaced through neurogenesis. Thus, it is unlikely that
ischemic injury can be entirely repaired by single neurogenesis but most likely by an orchestrated set of events.
Astroglial activity in the peri-ischemic area is also an
interesting and potential mechanism for therapeutic purposes. Gliosis is an impediment to neurite outgrowth and

formation after neural injury [27]. Inhibition of astroglial
reactivity may aid in plasticity of axonal regeneration,
formation of neural circuitry and recovery of neurologic
function. Pavlichenko et al. [28] observed the widest glial
scar in control group and moderate glial scar in the BMSC
therapy groups after stroke. In current study, we found a
significant decrease of GFAP expression, the principal
intermediate filament of mature astrocytes, in ADMSCs
group compared to saline group, implying the reduction of
astroglial reactivity resulted by ADMSCs treatment.

123

J Mater Sci: Mater Med (2014) 25:1357–1366

The cells within the boundary zone of ischemic lesions
were highly vulnerable to apoptosis [29] and previous
study suggested that apoptosis was a major mechanism
associated with the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injuryinduced neuronal damages [30]. Our study demonstrated
that treatment of stroke with ADMSCs remarkably reduced
the number of TUNEL-positive cells within the lesion area,
which corroborated the previous results that ADMSCs
therapy could inhibit cell apoptosis [16, 31].
In addition, among the ADMSCs migrated into the brain,
partial ones expressed neurons specific marks such as NeuN
and GFAP in vivo, which was in accordance with the previous reports that ADMSCs can form neurospheres and
differentiate into neural or glial cells in vitro [13, 14].
However, expression of phenotypic brain cell markers by
the injected ADMSCs did not indicate true differentiation of
them into neuronal or glial-cell, as we did not determine the
electrophysiological properties of the engrafted cells.
Although the replacement of damaged brain tissue is a
prominent goal of transplantation therapy, the benefit provided by stem cells seems to far outreach the capability to
differentiate into parenchymal tissue [17, 18]. Supporting
this hypothesis, a previous study reported the total failure of
transplanted bone marrow cells to differentiate into neural
cells whatever they were transplanted into injured or uninjured mice [32]. And within such a short period, the transplanted cells are nearly impossible to integrate into tissue
and form complex connections with it. The possible reason
for functional recovery may be that the injected ADMSCs
can activate the redundant neurons in brain.
Compared with intracerebral and intravenous injection,
intra-arterial injection has some its own advantages. Direct
intracerebral injection of cells requires craniotomy with
high traumatic injury, whereas intra-arterial injection poses
low risk to the patient. Intravenous transplantation method
minimizes the tissue damage, but has some limitations in
that it allows the injected stem cells to diffuse into other
systemic organs, and consequently it is less efficient at
delivering cells directly to the brain, though this can be
overcome by repeated intravenous injections. Accordingly,
MSC injected into the carotid artery appear to be distributed efficiently to the ischemic core. It has been reported
that the intra-arterial route results in a larger number of
BMMCs in the brain compared to the intravenous route in
rats subjected to 90 min of MCAo [19].
There were some limitations in present study. Firstly, we
only detected the treatment effect of ADMSCs when
2 9 106 cells were injected but didn’t explore whether
different amount of cells would result in different results.
Secondly, single injection of ADMSCs was conducted for
each rat but whether multiple injections would improve the
treatment effect. Additionally, the time of injection should
be evaluated in further research.

1365

In conclusion, we found that the intra-arterial-injected
ADMSCs could improve the neuronal damages in rats with
ischemia/reperfusion brain injury. The possible mechanisms may be that ADMSCs can attenuate astroglial
reactivity, inhibit cellular apoptosis, and promote cellular
proliferation. Thus, ADMSCs provide a potential therapeutic method for IS. However, clinical utility of ADMSCs
still faces some problems, such as the appropriate therapeutic window, the appropriate dosage and so on, which
are remained to be further investigated.
