Inﬂammation plays a crucial role in acute ischemic stroke pathogenesis. Macrophage-derived Maresin 1
(MaR1) is a newly uncovered mediator with potent anti-inﬂammatory abilities. Here, we investigated the
effect of MaR1 on acute inﬂammation and neuroprotection in a mouse brain ischemia reperfusion (I/R)
model. Male C57 mice were subjected to 1-h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and reperfusion.
By the methods of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, haematoxylin and eosin or Fluoro-Jade B staining,
neurological deﬁcits scoring, ELISA detection, immunoﬂuorescence assay and western blot analysis, we
found that intracerebroventricular injection of MaR1 signiﬁcantly reduced the infarct volume and
neurological defects, essentially protected the brain tissue and neurons from injury, alleviated proinﬂammatory reactions and NF-kB p65 activation and nuclear translocation. Taken together, our results suggest that MaR1 signiﬁcantly protects against I/R injury probably by inhibiting pro-inﬂammatory
reactions.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke is one of the most important leading causes of
morbidity and mortality in the adult population [1]. The pathogenesis is complex and involves a myriad of distinct molecular
pathways. Inﬂammation has been implicated as a prominent injury
mechanism. Blocking various aspects of the inﬂammatory cascade

has been demonstrated to mitigate ischemic injury [2,3].
Pro-resolving mediators that act as “stop signals” for inﬂammation are endogenously biosynthesized [4] and pivotal for the
maintenance of homeostasis. Among these protective mediators,
maresins are the most recently identiﬁed macrophage-derived proresolving mediators [5]. It is DHA derived and synthesized in
macrophages, resulting in biosynthesis of potent mediators such as
7R,14S-dihydroxy-4Z,8E,10E,12Z,16Z,19Z-DHA (denoted Maresin 1
or MaR1) [5,6]. In our previous studies, treatment of a rat cerebral I/
R model with lipoxins or the lipoxin A4 receptor agonist afforded
pro-resolution effects and protected the brain from ischemic injuries [2,7,8]. MaR1 was shown to reduce neuropathic pain [9], and
reduce pro-inﬂammatory cytokine release in acute lung injury [10].
Furthermore, MaR1 inhibited the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition and attenuated bleomycin-induced lung ﬁbrosis [11].
Nevertheless, the effect of MaR1 on ischemic stroke is unknown.
Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the antiinﬂammatory and pro-resolving effects of MaR1 and to elucidate

the underlying mechanism in the experimental cerebral I/R model.

24 h to obtain the dry weight. The brain water content was calculated as follows: (wet weight  dried weight)/wet weight  100%.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals

2.4. Haematoxylin and Eosin(H&E), Fluoro-Jade B(FJ), and terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) assay

Male C57BL/6 mice (8e10weeks) weighing 23e27 g were purchased from the experimental animal centre of Wuhan University,
Wuhan, China (Laboratory Animal Certiﬁcate: SCXK 2014-0004)
and housed under standard conditions of temperature and humidity and a 12 h of light/dark cycle (lights on at 08:00) with free
access to food and water. Adequate measures were taken to minimize pain or discomfort during surgeries. All animal experiments
were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals of Tongji Medical College. All usages and
procedures were approved by the committee of experimental animals of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science
and Technology.

H&E staining was used to estimate overall brain tissue pathologic changes. For neuronal degeneration evaluation, FJ staining
was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany). Cell death was detected by TUNEL
assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Inc, Mannheim, Germany). Slices were incubated
in the TUNEL reaction mixture for 1 h at 37  C. Next, DAPI was
added to identify the nuclei. Images were captured with an
Olympus ﬂuorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) by an
investigator who was blinded to the studies.
2.5. Immunoﬂuorescence assay

2.2. Mouse MCAO model and drug administration
Mice were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) with
80 mg/kg of 2% sodium pentobarbital. Focal cerebral ischemia was
introduced by intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO). Brieﬂy, a 7-0 silicon rubber-coated nylon monoﬁlament
was inserted from the right external carotid artery to the internal
carotid artery and advanced 9e11 mm past the carotid bifurcation
until a slight resistance was felt. Occlusion was conﬁrmed by a brain
blood ﬂow reduction of more than 75% of the baseline. One hour
after MCAO, the monoﬁlament was withdrawn for reperfusion.
Throughout the surgery, the rectal temperature was maintained at
37 ± 0.5  C with a homeothermic blanket. Sham-operated mice
underwent the same procedure but did not receive the occlusion.
MaR1 (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was freshly
diluted with normal saline (NS). After reperfusion, MaR1 was
intracerebroventricular injected (i.c.v.) on the left side at a dose of
0.1, 1, or 10 ng per mouse (2.5 ml) within 10 min. The MCAO group
received same volume of NS. The location of each injection was
0.3 mm posterior to the bregma, 1.0 mm lateral to the midline, and
2.5 mm below the skull surface. The microsyringe needle was kept
in position for another 3 min in case of reﬂuxing.
2.3. Measurement of neurological score, infarct volume and brain
water content were provided in supplementary materials
The neurological score was evaluated with a 5-point scale after
48 h or 72 h of reperfusion. 0, no obvious deﬁcit (normal); 1,
contralateral torso ﬂexion or forelimb retraction when lifted by the
tail (mild); 2, spontaneous circling to the contralateral side but
normal posture at rest (moderate); 3, leaning/falling to the
contralateral side (severe); 4, no spontaneous movement
(extremely severe); and 5, death.
The cerebral infarct volume was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) staining.
The slices were placed in 2% TTC at 37  C for 20 min, the infarct area
was demarcated and analyzed using the Image J software. The
corrected infarct volume was calculated to eliminate oedema error:
Corrected infarct area ¼ Measured infarct area  {1  [(Ipsilateral
hemisphere area  Contralateral hemisphere area)/Contralateral
hemisphere]}. The infarct size was quantiﬁed by the ratio of the
corrected infarcted volume to the whole brain volume.
For brain water content measurement, brain samples were
separated into ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres after 24 h
reperfusion, and weighed on an electronic balance to obtain the
wet weight. Then, hemispheres were dried in an oven at 100  C for

After 24 h reperfusion, parafﬁn-embedded 5 mm brain tissue
sections were permeabilized with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100
for 10 min, blocked with 10% normal goat serum for 1 h, and then
incubated overnight at 4  C with a primary antibody as follows:
rabbit-anti-Iba1 (1:200, Wako, Japan), rabbit-anti-NeuN (1:300,
Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), or rabbit-anti-GFAP
(1:300, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Following 3 washes with
PBS, the sections were incubated with IFKine Green AfﬁniPure
Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (1:200, Abbkine, California, USA), and FITClabeled anti-neutrophil monoclonal antibody (1:100, Abcam Cambridge, MA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. Images were
captured with an Olympus ﬂuorescence microscope (Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan) by an investigator who was blinded to the studies.
2.6. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and myeloperoxidase
measurement
For ELISA detection, tissue samples were collected from the
ischemic cortex 24 h after reperfusion. The tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-1b, and monocyte chemoattractant protein
(MCP)-1 contents were quantiﬁed using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Boster Biological Technology, Wuhan,
China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples
were measured in duplicate. Readings from each sample were
normalized to the protein concentration.
2.7. Western blot analysis
The ischemic cortices were homogenized with radioimmune
precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer for total proteins or the NE-PER
Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) for nuclear proteins supplemented with a
protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche
Molecular Biochemicals, Inc., Mannheim, Germany). Proteins were
separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) before transfer to PVDF membranes. The membranes were
blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBST and immune-probed with
primary antibodies against postsynaptic density protein 95
(PSD95), synapsin 1, NF-kB p65, p-p65 (1:1000, all from Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA), b-actin and lamin B (1:1,000, both from
Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany) at 4  C overnight. Then, the
membranes were incubated with the respective secondary antibodies for 1 h. The proteins were detected with ECL (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA) and b-actin was used as a loading control.
The intensity of the protein bands was ultimately analyzed using

the Image J software (version 1.45s; NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).
2.8. Data analysis
Data were expressed as the mean ± SEM. Group comparisons
were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by the StudenteNewmaneKeuls test. Statistical analyses were performed
using GraphPad Prism 5.0. Signiﬁcant differences were deﬁned as
P < 0.05.

staining (Fig. 2A), FJ (Fig. 2B) and TUNEL staining (Fig. 2C),
respectively. As shown in Fig. 2A, the sham group had a normal
brain parenchyma with fewer monocytes. In MCAO group, the
neurocytes exhibited vacuolar degeneration, chromatin condensation and nucleic fragmentation. With an optimal dose of 1 ng, MaR1
attenuated the overall brain tissue damage, decreased neuronal
degeneration and cell death. Subsequently, synaptic-associated
PSD95 (Fig. 2D) and synapsin 1 (Fig. 2E) were detected by western blotting. Reperfusion after MCAO signiﬁcantly reduced their
expression (P < 0.05). Treatment with 1 ng of MaR1 signiﬁcantly
protected these proteins from degradation (P < 0.01), while treatment with 0.1 ng offered slight protection and 10 ng had no effect.

3.1. MaR1 reduced the infarct volume, neurological deﬁcits and
brain oedema after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion

3.3. MaR1 inhibited glia activation and neutrophil inﬁltration

First, we tested whether MaR1 could reduce the infarct volume,
neurological deﬁcits and brain oedema. As shown in Fig. 1A (top
panel), the non-ischemic area was stained red and the infarct area
was pale. The neurological scores were provided in Fig. 1B, and the
brain oedema was shown in Fig. 1C. Interestingly, MaR1 at an
optimal dose of 1 ng effectively reduced the infarct volume (Fig. 1A
bottom panel), mitigated the neurological deﬁcits especially at 72 h
after reperfusion, and reduced brain oedema compared with MCAO
group (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, and P < 0.01, respectively). In contrast,
treatment with 0.1 ng of MaR1 resulted in a slight alleviation and
treatment with 10 ng had no effect.

Resting glia become activated following brain damage and
generate a stereotypic cellular response known as gliosis [12]. Iba1
and GFAP were used as markers for microglia and astrocytes
(Fig. 3A, B). Neutrophil inﬁltration aggravates ischemic brain injury,
so we used a FITC-conjugated antibody to detect inﬁltrated
neutrophil in the ischemic cortex (Fig. 3C). In the sham group, very
few positive cells were detected. Conversely, many Iba1-/GFAPpositive cells and neutrophil arose in the MCAO group following
ischemic injury, which were largely reduced by treatment with 1 ng
of MaR1, with a mild decrease following 0.1 ng of MaR1 and no
effect of treatment with 10 ng of MaR1.

3.2. MaR1 alleviated brain tissue damage and prevented injury to
neurocytes and synaptic-associated proteins

3.4. MaR1 down-regulated pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and
chemokines and suppressed nuclear factor-kВ (NF-kВ) activation

Reperfusion after MCAO triggered brain tissue damage and
neuronal degeneration or death, they were detected by H&E

Pro-inﬂammatory cytokines have long been suggested to
contribute to ischemic damage due to their roles in neutrophil

recruitment and inﬂammatory response propagation [13]. In the
present study, the ELISA results showed a signiﬁcant increase in
TNF-a, IL-1b and MCP-1 expression in the ischemic cortex after 24 h
of reperfusion (Fig. 4A, P < 0.001 and P < 0.01), which were
signiﬁcantly down-regulated by 0.1 ng or 1 ng of MaR1 (P < 0.05),
but not 10 ng of MaR1. Immunoﬂuorescence and western blotting
were performed to detect NF-kB activity. After 24 h of reperfusion,
NF-kB p65 translocated to the nuclei (Fig. 4B left) in a manner that
was suppressed by MaR1 treatment. Western blotting also showed
that the nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio of p65 was signiﬁcantly reduced
by MaR1 treatment (Fig. 4B top right, P < 0.001). However, p65
nuclear translocation in the 10 ng MaR1 group was still signiﬁcantly
higher compared to the 0.1 and 1 ng groups (P < 0.001). P65
phosphorylation at Ser 536 was increased after reperfusion
(P < 0.001) but was signiﬁcantly suppressed by 0.1 ng and 1 ng
MaR1 administration (Fig. 4B bottom right, P < 0.01 and P < 0.001,
respectively).

4. Discussion
In the current study, we showed that MaR1 reduced acute brain
I/R injury in a mouse model of MCAO. The protection probably
relied on the anti-inﬂammatory and pro-resolving capabilities
because MaR1 signiﬁcantly inhibited glia activation, neutrophil
inﬁltration and pro-inﬂammatory factor generation. Furthermore,
MaR1 suppressed nuclear factor NF-kB activation.
Acute inﬂammatory responses contribute to cerebral I/R injury

[14]. Therefore, an anti-inﬂammatory or pro-resolving treatment
would represent a promising therapeutic option. Maresins are
newly uncovered class of lipid mediators that are synthesized with
DHA in macrophages. It shifts macrophage phenotypes [15], promotes the resolution of acute lung injury by overcoming suppression of neutrophil apoptosis [16]. In zymosan-initiated acute
peritonitis, MaR1 can reduce neutrophil inﬁltration at doses of as
low as 0.1 ng per mouse. Also, MaR1 enhanced macrophage efferocytosis, which showed it to be more potent than resolvin D1 [9]. In
these previous studies, MaR1 exhibited anti-inﬂammatory or proresolving effects in various types of models. Similarly, the current
data showed that MaR1 attenuated pro-inﬂammatory response in
ischemic brain, thereby protecting the mouse brain from I/R injury.
The dose and effect of MaR1 conformed to the bell-shaped
curve; the optimal dose was 1 ng per mouse, which was consistent with previous mouse models such as zymosan-initiated acute
peritonitis [9], allergen-triggered inﬂammation [17] and acute lung
injury [10]. The use of a higher dose resulted in abolishment of the
anti-inﬂammatory effect or loss of protective actions that is characteristic of the bell shaped dose response displayed by specialized
pro-resolving mediators (SPM), which may be attributed to drug
intoxication or merely a biphasic response. Therefore, determining
the optimal dose of MaR1 for clinical applications requires special
attention.
Spine damage occurred very early after reperfusion in a mouse
model of ischemic stroke [18]. In our study, damage of synapticrelated proteins was detected after I/R in the ischemic cortex.

Fig. 3. MaR1 inhibited glial activation and suppressed neutrophil inﬁltration. Representative immunoﬂuorescent staining of (A) Iba1 to detect activated microglia and (B) GFAP as a
marker of astrocytes and (C) inﬁltrated neutrophil in the ischemic cortex of the sham-operation, MCAO-operation and MCAO þ MaR1-treated groups. Scale bars indicated 20 mm.
Treatment with 1 ng of MaR1 obviously inhibited their expression, activation or inﬁltration. Experiments were repeated three times with similar results.

However, MaR1 treatment signiﬁcantly protected the proteins from
destruction. This effect might have partially occurred by suppressing the activation of microglia, because microglia not only has
direct and physical contact but also participates in paracrine signalling to the synapse. Furthermore, activated microglia has been
reported to contribute to early spine loss and synaptic dysfunction
[19,20]. On the other hand, in dorsal root ganglion neurons, MaR1
selectively inhibits inﬂammatory pain and neuropathic pain
partially through G proteinecoupled receptors (GPCRs), which is
similar to other SPMs [9]. We may speculate MaR1 interacts with
neurons. However, the substantial mechanisms underlying these
effects require further study.
Microglia represent the ﬁrst line of defense against brain injury,
and astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the central nervous
system and provide structural and nutritive support of neurons.
However, in the early stage of brain I/R, activated microglia and
astrocytes could express a variety of cytokines, chemokines and
ROS in the injured area. Previous studies have reported that early
activation of glia contributes to a larger infarct size due to neuronaleglial interaction. Therefore, suppression of early glia activation
is neuroprotective [21]. Taken into account mechanisms of action,
other SPMs such as lipoxins or resolvin D1 bind and signal through
GPCRs in microglia, to some extend MaR1 may act in a similar way,
but the underlying mechanisms still need further study. In addition,
blood-derived leukocytes and neutrophils inﬁltrate into the
ischemic brain within 24 h. Activated neutrophil releases numerous
inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines, thereby exacerbating the
ischemic injury [22]. Therapies that prevent neutrophil inﬁltration
in the acute phase of ischemia have been shown to be neuroprotective. In the current study, inﬁltrated neutrophil was sharply
reduced by MaR1 treatment.

Large numbers of inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines, such
as IL-1b and TNF-a, are rapidly up-regulated within a few minutes
or hours after reperfusion [23]. Previous studies revealed that the
administration of exogenous IL-1b exacerbated brain ischemic
injury [24]. TNF-a is one of the most extensively studied cytokines,
and administration of a neutralizing antibody to TNF can attenuate
acute ischemic injury. MCP-1 is expressed in the ischemic cortex
and striatum after MCAO and emerges as early as 12 h after a stroke.
Up-regulation of MCP-1 in the ischemic brain signiﬁcantly aggravates stroke injury and results in the recruitment of more inﬂammatory cells [25]. Reciprocally, these factors contribute to
neutrophil inﬁltration and glia activation [26]. Hence, downregulation of them would be neuroprotective. In the current
study, MaR1 administration signiﬁcantly reduced their expression.
The involvement of NF-kB in I/R injury is well recognized [27],
NF-kB P65 phosphorylation coincides with the promotion of IkB
degradation and subsequent p65 activation [28]. Activated NF-kB
p65 translocates into the nucleus, where it combines with its target
genes (i.e., TNF-a, IL-1, and IL-6). Additionally, NF-kB causes
microglia activation [29]. Reciprocally, NF-kB can be activated by
proinﬂammatory cytokines. In our mouse model of MCAO, MaR1
signiﬁcantly reduced NF-kB nuclear translocation and phosphorylation, which indicated that NF-kB supression was one protective
mechanism of MaR1 against experimental stroke. This effect may
occur indirectly through the suppression of TNF-a. However, the
underlying molecular mechanism needs further study.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that MaR1 mitigated
acute cerebral I/R injury, possibly through an anti-inﬂammatory
action involving the suppression of the NF-kB signalling pathway.
Further study of the role of MaR1 in brain I/R injury, such as blood
brain barrier damage and microglia phenotype transformation, and
