Abstract: Buyang Huanwu decoction (BYHWD), a traditional Chinese herbal prescription, has been widely used
clinically to treat stroke in China for hundreds of years; however, the mechanisms of this drug for stroke treatment are
still unclear. This study aims to observe the cerebral angiogenesis effects of BYHWD on chronic brain injury after focal
cerebral ischemia in rats and to explore its possible mechanisms. The ischemia was induced by occlusion of the right
middle cerebral artery for 90 min. BYHWD (12.5 and 25.0 g/(kg·d), equivalent to the dry weight of the raw materials)
was orally administered twice a day beginning 2 h after surgery. BYHWD significantly attenuated the neurological
dysfunction, infarct volume, and brain atrophy after ischemia. There was a significant increase in the microvessel
density, as assessed by immunofluorescence CD31, and a significant increase in angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) in the penumbra areas of the rats was shown by immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. The results indicate that
the neurorestorative effects of BYHWD are associated with angiogenesis and the enhancement of the expressions of
Ang-1 on chronic brain injury after focal cerebral ischemia.

1 Introduction
It is a well-known fact that stroke-evoked angiogenesis is likely to take place after brain ischemia,
especially in the chronic phase (Wei et al., 2001;
Bramlett and Dietrich, 2004). Angiogenesis, primarily in the ischemic boundary zone, enhances the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the affected tissue.
Additionally, the generation of new blood vessels

facilitates highly coupled neurorestorative processes,
including neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, which in
turn lead to improved functional recovery (Chen and
Chopp, 2006; Beck and Plate, 2009). Studies from
human and experimental stroke studies provide evidence for the therapeutic role of angiogenesis after
focal cerebral ischemia.
Two angiogenic signal systems, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/Flk and angiopoietins/
Tie-2 receptor, play key roles in the formation of
new blood vessels. The VEGF/Flk system appears to
be involved in blood vessel production in the acute
stage of brain ischemia. The angiopoietins/Tie-2

Shen et al. / J Zhejiang Univ-Sci B (Biomed & Biotechnol) 2014 15(3):272-280

receptor system functions to maintain vascular networks in the later stages of brain ischemia (Suri et al.,
1996). Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) signaling promotes
angiogenesis and remodeling of blood vessels through
its receptor tyrosine kinase Tie-2, which is contained
in blood vessel endothelial cells. Transgenic overexpression of Ang-1 increases vascular stabilization
(Suri et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2012), and Ang-1 and
VEGF in combination induce a synergistic angiogenic effect and promote the formation of mature
neovessels without the side effects on blood-brain
barrier (BBB) permeability (Valable et al., 2005).
Buyang Huanwu decoction (BYHWD), a traditional Chinese herbal prescription, has been employed clinically to treat stroke in China for hundreds
of years. A number of studies demonstrate that
BYHWD improves the outcome of ischemic stroke in
clinical trials (Hao et al., 2012). However, the
mechanisms of this drug for stroke treatment are still
unclear. Recent investigations showed its neuroprotective effects and mechanisms against cerebral
ischaemia-reperfusion injury (Cai et al., 2007; Wang
et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2012). However, few studies
have been performed to promote angiogenesis with
BYHWD treatment, and the mechanisms of this drug
for angiogenesis are unknown. In the present study,
we investigate neurorestorative angiogenesis and the
expressions of Ang-1 on chronic brain injury after
focal cerebral ischemia.

2 Materials and methods
2.1 Composition and preparation of BYHWD
BYHWD was prepared as follows (Cai et al.,
2007). BYHWD is composed of Radix Astragali,
Radix Angelicae Sinensis, Radix Paeoniae Rubra,
Rhizoma Chuanxiong, Semen Persicae, Flos Carthami, and Lumbricus, which were mixed at the ratio
of 120:10:10:10:10:10:4.5 (dry weight). The decoction was made by boiling the mixture three times in
distilled water at 100 °C for 30 min. The drug solution
was then vacuum-cooled and dried to form a powder,
which was dissolved in distilled water at a final concentration of 2 g/ml (equivalent to the dry weight of
the raw materials). All materials were purchased from
the East China Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd.,
Zhejiang Province, China.

273

2.2 Animals and drug administration
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 250–
280 g, were purchased from the Animals Laboratory
Centre, Academy of Medical Sciences (Zhejiang,
China) and all experiments were approved by the
Animal Research Ethics Committee, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China. The rats were
randomly divided into four groups: the sham-operated
group (sham), the vehicle-treated middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) group (vehicle), and MCAO
groups treated with 12.5 and 25.0 g/(kg·d) BYHWD.
The BYHWD was administrated orally twice a day
starting 2 h after surgery. The vehicle and sham
groups received an equal amount of distilled water for
the same duration.
2.3 Transient focal cerebra ischaemia-reperfusion
model
Focal cerebral ischemic rat models were induced
by MCAO as previously reported (Cai et al., 2007;
Xiong et al., 2013). In brief, the rats were anesthetized with 400 mg/kg of chloral hydrate i.p. The rats’
rectal temperatures were maintained at 37 °C by
placing the animals on a heating bed. The right carotid
bifurcation was exposed, and the external carotid
artery was coagulated distal to the bifurcation. A
silicone-coated 4-0 suture was then inserted through
the stump of the external cerebral artery and gently
advanced (17.0 mm) to occlude the middle cerebral
artery. After 90 min of occlusion, the filament was
gently withdrawn, and the incision was closed. In the
sham-operated rats, the common carotid was exposed
without ligation.
2.4 Neurological deficit
The neurological behavior status was carefully
evaluated once a week after surgery according to the
method of Bederson et al. (1986). In brief, the neurological status was classified as follows: 0=no observable deficit; 1=forelimb flexion; 2=forelimb
flexion plus decreased resistance to lateral push;
3=unidirectional circling; and 4=unidirectional circling plus decreased level of consciousness.
2.5 Quantification of atrophy and infarct volume
For evaluation of infarct volume, 2,3,5-triphenyl
tetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma, St. Louis, MO,

274

Shen et al. / J Zhejiang Univ-Sci B (Biomed & Biotechnol) 2014 15(3):272-280

USA) staining was performed as previously described
(Gu et al., 2013). Seven days after surgery, the rats
were sacrificed under anesthesia, and their brains
were immediately isolated and sliced rostrocaudally
into serial 2-mm-thick slices. The sections of each
brain were stained with 0.1% TTC solution and photographed. To correct for swelling due to cerebral
edema, the infarct volume was normalized and expressed as a percentage of the ipsilateral hemispheric
volume (Gu et al., 2013). For evaluation of the atrophy volume, the brains were removed and dehydrated
four weeks after surgery, then cut into coronal slices
of 2 mm thickness as described above. The atrophic
area was calculated by subtracting out the area of the
ipsilateral hemisphere from the area of the contralateral hemisphere and was expressed as a percentage of
the ipsilateral hemispheric volume (Pang et al., 2001).
The data were analyzed in a blinded manner using
Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics,
Silver Spring, MD, USA).
2.6 Immunofluorescence staining
Frozen sections of 20-µm thickness were prepared and blocked with a 10% normal serum blocking
solution, with a species the same as the secondary antibody containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA),
0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.05% Tween-20 2 h at room
temperature in order to avoid unspecific staining.
Then, the sections were incubated with primary rabbit
anti-CD31 (1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) overnight at 4 °C, followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated by tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC) (1:200,
Jackson, PA, USA) for 2 h at 37 °C. Sections were
covered with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI;
Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 10 min at 30 °C.
The stained sections were examined with confocal
laser scanning microscopy (Olympus, FV1000, Tokyo,
Japan).
2.7 Immunohistochemical staining
Sections (10-μm) were dewaxed and rehydrated
using 100%, 95%, and 70% of graded alcohol for
5 min. The sections were then incubated for 2 h with
5% goat serum to block nonspecific immune reactions after the microwave antigen retrieval procedure
(citrate buffer, pH 6.0). Anti-Ang-1 (1:50, Santa Cruz,
CA, USA) was used as the primary antibody and
incubated overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation
with rabbit anti-goat IgG conjugated by horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) (1:300, Cell Signaling, MA,

USA). Slides were then developed using a DAB
(3,3'-diaminobenzidine) chromogen kit. The positive
areas were measured using five randomly chosen
fields. The intensity of positive staining in tissue sections was analyzed using the Image-Pro Plus 6.0
software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD,
USA) and SigmaPlot 4.0 (SPSS, Point Richmond, CA,
USA).
2.8 Measurement of the proteins in rat ischemic
cortex by Western blotting
The ischemic penumbra was homogenized in a
radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer
in the presence of a protease inhibitor. The supernatant was collected after the tissue was centrifuged at
12 000×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The bicinchoninic acid
protein assay (BCA; KeyGEN, Nanjing, China) was
used to quantify the protein. In each lane, 40 µg of
sample was loaded to a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by using 12% Ready
Gel. Proteins were transferred into polyvinylidene
fluoride membranes for 90 min. The membrane was
blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween-20 for 2 h
and incubated with primary goat anti-Ang-1 (1:200,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA) or rabbit anti-GAPDH
(glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; 1:1000,
Abcam, Cambridge, UK) overnight at 4 °C, and then
followed by 2 h of incubation with rabbit anti-goat or
goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated by HRP (1:3000, Cell
Signaling, MA, USA). Then, the membranes were
developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence
ECL reagent (Millipore, MA, USA). The image was
scanned, and band intensity was quantified using the
Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software.
2.9 Statistical analysis
Statistical data were represented as mean±standard
deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was performed by
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
a Student’s t-test. A difference with P<0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
3 Results
3.1 BYHWD reduced the infarct and atrophy
volumes
To investigate the protection of BYHWD against
the local cerebral ischemia, this study assessed the

Shen et al. / J Zhejiang Univ-Sci B (Biomed & Biotechnol) 2014 15(3):272-280

infarct volume of the injured cerebrum. The obvious
infarct difference was indicated at the end of one
week (Fig. 1a). As is shown in Table 1, after being
treated with BYHWD for one week, the infarct volume
was reduced from (27.27±2.28)% (vehicle-treated
group) to (20.17±2.17)% (12.5 g/(kg·d), P<0.01) and
(15.02±1.74)% (25.0 g/(kg·d), P<0.01), respectively.
To evaluate the degree of atrophy in the injured cerebrum, this study assessed the atrophy volume from
two to four weeks, and there was a significantly decreased atrophy volume at the end of four weeks
(Fig. 1b). As is shown in Table 1, after treatment with
BYHWD, the atrophy volume was reduced from
(11.16±1.35)% (vehicle-treated group) to (9.77±1.05)%
(12.5 g/(kg·d), P<0.01) and (7.50±1.53)% (25.0 g/(kg·d),
P<0.01), respectively.

3.2 BYHWD reduced neurological deficit
To evaluate the neurological function, Bederson’s
score was used as the criteria for evaluation of the
neurological deficit grading system which was carried
out after MCAO. As is shown in Table 1, after treatment
with BYHWD for one week, the neurological deficit
improved from 2.2±0.63 to 1.40±0.70 (12.5 g/(kg·d),
P<0.05) and 1.10±0.74 (25.0 g/(kg·d), P<0.01). After
two weeks, the deficit improved from 2.30±0.67 to
1.30±0.67 (P<0.01) and 0.90±0.73 (P<0.01), and
after three weeks, it improved from 2.00±0.47 to
1.00±0.67 (P<0.01) and 0.80±0.63 (P<0.01). After
four weeks of treatment, the deficit improved from
1.80±0.63 to 0.80±0.63 (P<0.01) and 0.50±0.53
(P<0.01), respectively. These results are in agreement
with the results of the infarct volume variation.
3.3 BYHWD increased microvessel density (MVD)
The MVD, assessed by immunoreactive CD31,
was performed as follows (Weidner, 2008). The immunostained sections were scanned at low magnification (40×) and the area with the highest density of
distinctly highlighted microvessels (“hot spot”) was
selected. The MVD was then determined in the hot
spot by counting all vessels at a total magnification of
200×. A score of 1 was given for each individual
CD31-positive microvessel or single endothelial cell
if they were clearly separated from the adjacent microvessels. Any vessel, even if incomplete, projecting
into the field of view was scored. Ischemia-induced
angiogenesis gradually increased in the penumbra
area from two to four weeks, and BYHWD treatment
further increased angiogenesis at four weeks after
MCAO. As is shown in Fig. 2, the MVD was evidently increased in the vehicle-treated group from
17.73±5.98 to 34.80±5.76 (P<0.01), when compared
with the sham-operated group at the end of four weeks.
In the treatment groups with BYHWD, MVD markedly

77.00±11.27 (25.0 g/(kg·d), P<0.01), respectively, in
comparison to the vehicle-treated group.
3.4 BYHWD increased protein expression of
Ang-1 by immunohistochemical staining
Our data demonstrated that the stroke-induced
ischemic brain simultaneously and gradually increased
the expression of Ang-1 beginning two weeks after
MCAO, and treatment with BYHWD further increased
and maintained the expression of Ang-1 from three
weeks after MCAO. As is shown in Fig. 3, there was
little Ang-1 positive staining in the sham-operated

group. After ischemia at four weeks in the penumbra
area, the positive Ang-1 staining remarkably increased
in the vehicle-treated group (7022.30±2549.58, P<0.01),
when compared with the sham-operated group. In the
BYHWD treatment groups, there was an evident
increase in the positive Ang-1 staining to 11 204.00±
5898.38 (12.5 g/(kg·d), P<0.01) and 16 179.00±6402
(25.0 g/(kg·d), P<0.01), when compared with the
vehicle-treated group. Furthermore, in the BYHWD
treatment groups, Ang-1 protein was expressed not
only in nerve tissue of the penumbra area but also in
the brain microvascular endothelial cells constructing
the vascular structures.

3.5 BYHWD increased protein expression of
Ang-1 by Western blotting
To further investigate the difference of the protein expression of Ang-1 in the penumbra area at four
weeks, we utilized Western blotting. As is shown in
Fig. 4, the level of Ang-1 protein in the vehicletreated group (0.096±0.108, P<0.05) was higher than
that in the sham-operated group, and after treatment
with BYHWD for four weeks, the level of Ang-1
protein was dramatically increased to 0.134±0.014
(12.5 g/(kg·d), P<0.01) and 0.163±0.010 (25.0 g/(kg·d),
P<0.01), when compared with the vehicle-treated
group. These results are in agreement with the results

4 Discussion
For several decades, most attempts to treat stroke
focused on neuroprotection (Fan and Yang, 2007).

277

However, only one Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved drug for the treatment of clinical
ischemic stroke, a recombinant tissue plasminogen
activator, shows therapeutic effects on the restoration
of blood flow when given very early in carefully
selected patients (Weintraub, 2006). Recent research
has suggested that an alternative approach for restoring blood flow is to promote angiogenesis in regions surrounding the ischemic brain beyond the
hyperacute phase of the stroke. The time window for
therapies improving stroke recovery, so called neurorestorative therapies, is likely to be far longer than
that for acute neuroprotection (Chen and Chopp, 2006;
Beck and Plate, 2009). Neurorestorative events include neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and angiogenesis, for which the generation of new blood vessels as a neurorestorative event in the chronic stage
after stroke, could be interpreted as a natural defense
mechanism helping to restore the supply of nutrients
to the affected brain tissue. Additionally, angiogenic
vessels facilitate highly coupled neurorestorative
processes, including neurogenesis and synaptogenesis,
which in turn lead to improved functional recovery
(Beck and Plate, 2009). These studies suggest that
targeting brain vascular remodeling for drug discovery is necessary for the treatment of stroke and ischemia disease.
Many investigations showed the neuroprotective
effects of BYHWD against cerebral ischaemiareperfusion injury (Cai et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2011;
Zhao et al., 2012). The neuroprotection of BYHWD
may involve different mechanisms, including increased nerve proliferation (Cai et al., 2007), improved nerve regeneration (Li et al., 2003), reduced
inflammatory cytokine and neuronal apoptosis (Chen
et al., 2001). These mechanisms are greatly associated with the pathophysiological process and clinical
outcome in the acute and subacute phases. To date,
only two studies demonstrated the mechanisms of
angiogenesis by the expressions of VEGF and Flk at
the acute stage of ischaemic brains (Cai et al., 2007;
Cai and Liu, 2010). The present study showed that
ischemia-induced Ang-1 expression was not enough
for vascular remodeling, and that BYHWD treatment
improved neurological behavior performance and
reduced the infarct and atrophy volumes. Furthermore,
it increased microvessel formation and the secretion
of endogenous Ang-1 surrounding the ischemic tissue

278

Shen et al. / J Zhejiang Univ-Sci B (Biomed & Biotechnol) 2014 15(3):272-280

in the chronic stage. Our findings thus provide new
insights into the possible regulatory mechanisms of
BYHWD for neurorestorative therapy.
The Ang-1/Tie-2 receptor system, as one of the
most potent angiogenic factors, was expressed during
the later stages of stroke. Lin et al. (2000) demonstrated that Ang-1 mRNA slightly increased shortly
after ischemia and found an eightfold increase 7–14 d
after the insult, and that Tie-2 mRNA levels were
observed to remain at approximately the fourfold
level for up to two weeks. Zhang et al. (1999) reported an increase of Ang-1 mRNA at 24 h postischemia, which persisted up to 28 d. Our data also
showed that Ang-1 proteins were up-regulated to a
high level at the end of two weeks and decreased
gradually until four weeks after focal cerebral ischemia in the vehicle-treated group. However,
BYHWD treatment increased and maintained the
expression of endogenous Ang-1 until three weeks.
Moreover, the Ang-1/Tie-2 receptor system exerts its
functions on vascular remodeling and neurorestorative processes at chronic stages, i.e., when the microvascular beds was stabilized by the remodeling
and maturation of arterioles, capillaries and venules
into a complex hierarchical network. Ang-1 promotes
the survival and migration of endothelial cells and
blood-vessel maturation and exerts a vessel-sealing
effect (Suri et al., 1996; Thurston et al., 2000). It
appears to have recruited precursors into the wall of
developing vessels, in which the cells are transformed
into pericytes and smooth muscle cells. Ang-1 and
VEGF in combination induce a synergistic angiogenic effect, and promote the formation of mature
neovessels without the side effects on BBB permeability after 7 d (Valable et al., 2005). The coexpression of Ang-1 with VEGF increases the structural
integrity of the BBB and reduces atrophy volume at
three weeks (Shen et al., 2011). Our data further
showed that vascularization surrounding the ischemic
tissue was formed and the atrophy volume was reduced in the chronic phages at four weeks after
BYHWD treatment.
In addition to its angiogenic functions, Ang-1/
Tie-2 receptor system is also involved in neurogenesis, which along with angiogenesis might be directly
linked by Ang-1/Tie-2. In our study, Ang-1

protein was concentrated not only in brain microvascular endothelial cells constructing the vascular
structures, but also in the nerve tissue of the penumbra
area, which may indirectly indicate that the Ang-1/
Tie-2 signal has a combinative role in the neurorestorative process. Reports also suggest that the expression of Ang-1 was found in neurons and neural
stem cells, and that exogenous Ang-1 promotes the
survival of neurons and neural progenitor cells after
exposure to serum deprivation or hypoxia (Valable et
al., 2003; Bai et al., 2009). Ang-1 also elicits neuronal
differentiation and neurite outgrowth in mouse
embryonic cortical and dorsal root ganglion cells
(Kosacka et al., 2005; Bai et al., 2009). After cortical
and striatal stroke, ischemia elicits an up-regulation of
Ang-1 and the migration of the doublecortin (DCX)positive neuroblasts from the subventricular zone to
the peri-infarct area (Yamashita et al., 2006; Shin et
al., 2008). Moreover, neuroblasts have been found to
be concentrated around blood vessels following
stroke (Yamashita et al., 2006).
In conclusion, the results of the present study
show that BYHWD modulates angiogenesis in the
boundary ischemic region and increases the expressions of Ang-1, which may be the mechanism by
which BYHWD ameliorates chronic brain injury after
focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Taken together, the
results suggest that BYHWD may improve collateral
circulation and provide certain impacts for stroke
patients through new blood vessel formation. Future
research may elucidate the specific signaling pathways through which BYHWD increases angiogenesis.
