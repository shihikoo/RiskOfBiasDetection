The therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in tissue repair/regeneration is substantially
dampened by the loss of primitive properties and poor engraftment to target organs. In this study, the
multipotency and cell sizes of human MSCs, which had been expanded in monolayer culture for several
passages, were dramatically restored after an episode of three-dimensional (3D) spheroid culture. Unlike
MSCs derived from monolayer, which caused embolism and blindness, MSCs derived from 3D spheroids did
not cause vascular obstructions, after intra-carotid artery infusion in rats. Importantly, intra-carotid infusion
of 1 million 3D spheroid MSCs in rats 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion resulted in
engraftment of the cells into the lesion and significant (over 70%) reduction of infarct size along with
restoration of neurologic function. Moreover, the enhanced effect of spheroid MSCs was coincided with
significantly increased differentiation of the MSCs into neurons and markedly increased number of endogenous glial fibrillary acidic protein–positive neural progenitors in the peri-infarct boundary zone. However,
the similarly administered monolayer MSCs resulted in a modest functional improvement. Our results suggest
that 3D MSCs, in combination with intra-carotid delivery, may represent a novel therapeutic approach of
MSCs for stroke.

Introduction

S

troke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality
worldwide. Thrombolytic therapy requires timing administration of alteplase. This makes the majority of patients
unable to receive the treatment. Even with the treatment,
most patients heal with neurological deficits [1,2]. Therefore,
novel therapies to enhance neurogenesis and reduce neurological deficits are required.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are self-renewing and
expandable [3,4]. They are capable of differentiating into
mesoderm- and nonmesoderm-derived tissues [3,5]. Residing in various tissues, MSCs likely participate in the
maintenance of stem cell niches and tissue homeostasis
[6,7]. Increasing evidence has suggested a profound therapeutic potential of MSCs for a variety of diseases, such as
myocardial infarction and strokes [8–10]. Moreover, MSCs
show low immunogenicity and transplantation of allogeneic
MSCs appear not to cause immune rejections [11]. For these
reasons, MSCs are emerging as an extremely promising

therapeutic agent and numerous clinical trials for variety of
diseases are underway [8].
Recent studies indicate that current expansion methods of
MSCs in adherent culture lead to a loss of critical features of
the cells [12] and thereby affect their therapeutic effects.
MSCs appear as a rare cell population in the bone marrow
and other tissues [13]. Therefore, culture expansion of MSCs
is an essential procedure to obtain sufficient amounts of cells
for clinical therapies and tissue engineering. MSCs are
commonly cultured as a two-dimensional monolayer, which
facilitates adequate amplification, but is unable to retain the
primitive properties of the cells. The cells age quickly, resulting in reduction of valuable abilities such as homing and
production of paracrine factors important for tissue repair/
regeneration [12]. Increasing evidence suggests that alterations of MSCs in culture are caused by epigenetic changes
that are potentially reversible. Recently, MSCs cultured in
three-dimensional (3D) spheroids have been found to express
much higher levels of several cytokines than monolayercultured MSCs, such as vascular endothelial growth factor

(VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and angiogenin [14], which are critically involved in tissue repair.
Previous studies indicate that the therapeutic effect of
MSCs in tissue repair/regeneration is positively correlated
with the number of MSCs engrafted into the injured tissues
[10,15]. Extremely low numbers of culture-expanded MSCs
could arrive in injured tissues after intravenous infusion due
to severe lung vascular entrapment and rapid cell death
[16,17]. Though MSCs may release some cytokines to the
blood before death, which effectively affect the remote
target organ [16], the therapeutic potential of MSCs in tissue
regeneration is obviously dampened. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the quality and engraftment of MSCs to
achieve maximal therapeutic effect of the cells.
In this study, we found that intra-carotid artery infusion of
human MSCs (hMSCs) derived from spheroid culture that
significantly reduced the size of hMSCs by 40% resulted in
engraftment of hMSCs into the lesion and restored neurologic function after stroke in association with significantly
enhanced reduction of infarct volume (by 70%) in rats with
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), compare with
hMSCs cultured in monolayer, which caused embolism. In
accordance, rats receiving spheroid hMSCs showed profoundly enhanced differentiation of MSCs in the lesion and
significantly increased numbers of endogenous glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)–positive neural progenitor
cells. Our results indicate a markedly improved therapeutic
effect of 3D spheroid hMSCs in neurogenesis and restoration of cerebral function after ischemic stroke.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
hMSCs were isolated from human placenta as described
previously [12] (for details, see Supplementary Materials
and Methods; Supplementary Data are available online at
www.liebertpub.com/scd). Cells were culture expanded in a
growth medium consisting of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM; Gibco-Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Gibco-Invitrogen), and antibiotics. To form
spheroids, passage 5–7 hMSCs were cultured by a hangingdrop method as described previously [18] with modifications. Briefly, 3,000 hMSCs in 35 mL growth medium per
drop were plated in hanging drops and incubated for 36 h to
form spheroids. Then, the spheroids were transferred to a
suspension culture with fresh growth medium and incubated
for 24 h. To obtain single cells from spheroids, spheroids
were incubated with 0.25% trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid for 6–10 min (depending on size of spheroids)
with gentle pipetting every 2–3 min.

Measurement of cell size
The size of hMSCs derived from adherent monolayers
(mono) or from dissociated spheroids (3D) was determined
by microscopy and flow cytometry. For microscopic analysis, single cells from monolayer or 3D spheroids were
transferred into chambers of a hemocytometer, respectively,
and were observed using ordinary optical microscope.
Images were captured using a Ds-Fi1 camera (Nikon). In
addition, monolayer hMSCs were labeled with retroviralenhanced green fluorescent protein, and the cells from 3D

979

culture were labeled with lipophilic fluorochrome 1,1¢dioctadecyl-3,3,3¢,3¢-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI; Sigma-Aldrich). Then, the cells were mixed in
equal numbers and the diameter was measured under confocal laser scanning microscope (FV1000; Olympus). For
flow cytometric analysis of cell size, 2 · 105 hMSCs were
stained with an Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) apoptosis detection kit (Invitrogen) according to the
supplier’s instructions. Cell sizes were estimated from the
viable population (Annexin V- /PI -) by comparing forward
scatter properties of the cells.

Rat MCAO model
Female Sprague–Dawley rats (250–270 g) underwent
MCAO. After anesthesia, rats were subjected to transient
focal ischemia for 120 min by the intraluminal suture technique as described previously [19], and reperfusion was
achieved by withdrawing the suture (for details, see Supplementary Materials and Methods).

Cell transplantation
One day after MCAO, rats were randomly divided into three
groups, which received intra-carotid injection of spheroid
hMSCs, monolayer hMSCs, or equal volume of phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), respectively. Briefly, anesthesia was
reinstituted. A 30G microinjection needle (Hamilton) was inserted through a small puncture in the left common carotid
artery into the internal carotid artery after ligation of the pterygopalatine artery with a 6-0 silk suture. hMSCs in monolayer
or spheroids were trypsinized and filtered through a cell strainer
with 40-mm pores to generate single-cell suspensions immediately before transplantation. Cell sizes were measured by
calculating the average diameter of 100 cells in microscopic
images and by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis.
About 1 · 106 monolayer or 3D spheroid hMSCs in 100 mL
PBS (n = 20 for each group) or equal volume of PBS (n = 15)
were injected via the needle in no less than 5 min.

5-bromo-2 ¢-deoxyuridine injection
Rats received intraperitoneal injection of 5-bromo-2¢deoxyuridine (BrdU; Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.9% NaCl at
50 mg/kg body weight daily from the day of surgery until
the day before sacrifice. For brain tissue collection, rats were
deeply anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate and underwent intracardial perfusion first with PBS, followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS.

Behavioral tests
Each rat was subjected to a series of behavioral tests
[9,20] to evaluate neurologic functions before MCAO and 1,
3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 14 days after MCAO. Modified neurologic
severity score (mNSS) test was performed according to a
method reported previously [20] (for details, see Supplementary Materials and Methods).

Adhesive-removal somatosensory test
Somatosensory deficit was conducted both before and
after MCAO by adhesive-removal somatosensory test

980

[20]. Two small pieces of adhesive-backed paper dots
(113.1 mm2) were used as bilateral tactile stimuli occupying
the distal-radial region on the wrist of each forelimb. The rat
was then returned to its cage. The time to remove each
stimulus from the limb was recorded during five trials per
day for every other day. Individual trials were separated by
at least 5 min.

2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride assay
Fourteen days after MCAO, rats were anesthetized and
decapitated. Their brains were removed and coronally sectioned into six 2-mm coronal slices, incubated for 30 min in a
1% solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC;
Sigma-Aldrich) at 37C, and fixed with 4% PFA in PBS.
Infarct areas were measured by using software Image J and
infarct volumes were calculated, which was presented as infarct volume per volume of the entire cerebral hemisphere.

and s100. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed to
determine the protein expression of microtubule-associated
protein (MAP)-2.

Real-time PCR and immunofluorescence stain
Real-time PCR and immunofluorescence stain were performed with standard protocols (for details, see Supplementary Materials and Methods), and primers are listed in
Supplementary Table S1.

Statistical analyses
Values were expressed as mean – standard deviation. Results
were analyzed using one-way or repeated-measure analysis of
variance with independent variables of treatment groups and
days of testing, followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test for multiple comparisons between treatment groups at each time point.
A probability (P) value < 0.05 was considered significant.

Magnetic resonance imaging
Lesion development was assessed on days 1, 7, and 14
after MCAO using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, a
clinical 3.0 T MR system, Magnetom TIM Trio; Siemens)
with a custom rat coil. Rats were anesthetized using the described method in MCAO model. T2-weighted sequences
(T2-TSE) were performed at each MRI session consisting
of 23 transverse slices (repetition time: 4,000 ms, time to
echo: 82 ms, field of view: 42 · 60 mm2; slice thickness:
1 mm). All sequences were measured with a multicontrastspin echo (se-mc) sequence. For further processing, MRI
sequences were exported as DICOM sequences. Volumes of
ischemic lesion as well as ipsilateral and contralateral side
ventricles were determined by a blinded investigator using
software Image J. Subsequently, each calculated volume was
displayed as the percentage of the infarct volume on day 1.

Whole mount of retina
hMSCs in monolayer or spheroids were tryspinized to
generate single-cell suspensions and labeled with DiI [5].
Cell viability analysis was performed using Annexin-VFITC and showed that the DiI staining did not increase cell
death. Single-cell suspensions of MSCs were filtered
through a cell strainer with 40-mm pores to remove cell
aggregates. About 1 · 106 hMSCs derived from monolayer
or spheroids in 100 mL PBS (n = 5 for each) were injected
into the left internal carotid artery. After 24 h, rats were
sacrificed and the left retina was carefully removed,
mounted on glass slides, fixed with 4% PFA [21], and visualized under fluorescence microscope (Leica).

Results
3D spheroid culture reduces the size of hMSCs
and prevent embolism
After 60 h of culture in 3D spheroids, the average diameter of hMSCs decreased by 40% from 25.4 – 5.3 mm to
15.2 – 3.1 mm (Fig. 1A–D). After being re-seeded in plates,
cells became smaller and more 3D. Of 20 rats receiving
intra-internal carotid artery injection of monolayer hMSCs,
11 rats developed some degrees of abnormality with their
left eyes (the same side with cell injection). Within minutes
following the cell injection, the pupil of the eye became
dark and unclear. In many of them, the eye quickly became
cloudy (Fig. 1E). Meanwhile, the eye lost pupillary reflex, a
sign of vision loss. Of 20 rats receiving injection of spheroid
hMSCs, none of them showed abnormality with their eyes.
Since the eye artery that supplies the retina is a branch of the
internal carotid artery in rats [22], we examined whether
intra-carotid artery injection of hMSCs led to obstructions of
the small arteries in the retina. Twenty-four hours after injection of DiI-labeled single hMSCs prepared from monolayer or spheroids (n = 5), whole-mount preparations of the
retina were examined under fluorescence microscope for
DiI-positive cells in the retina. Surprisingly, we found substantial amounts of DiI-positive hMSCs in the blood vessels of
various sizes (probably small to microarteries and -capillaries),
whereas only few DiI-positive cells were detected in the
retina of rats receiving injection of equal numbers of
spheroid hMSCs (Fig. 1E). Meanwhile, we observed a
transient worsening of neurologic function in some rats with
MCAO shortly following injection of monolayer hMSCs.

Neuronal differentiation
To induce neurogenic differentiation, the cells were
grown in DMEM-HG containing 1% FBS, 1% penicillinstreptomycin, and 100 ng/mL bFGF (R&D) for 24 h, followed by supplementing 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor
(Peptech), 20 ng/mL bFGF, 25 ng/mL nerve growth factor
(R&D), 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 mM dbcAMP (Sigma-Aldrich) for another 7
days. Total RNA was extracted for real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) analysis for the expression of nestin

Spheroid hMSCs reduce infarct volume
MRI was applied to analyze the volume of cerebral infarct on days 1 (prior to hMSC transplantation), 7, and 14
post-MCAO. Before MSC transplantation, there were no
significant differences in infarct volume among the three
groups (Fig. 2A, B; P > 0.05, n = 6). On day 7, rats treated
with 3D spheroid hMSCs showed a 55% decrease in infarct
volume relative to the infarct volume at day 1 (considered as
100%), compared with 27.5% reduction in rats treated with

developed blindness with the left

hMSCs did not cause visible abnormalities in the eyes (upper right

presence of DiI-positive cells 24 h
after intra-carotid injection of 1 million DiI-labeled hMSCs. In rats injected with monolayer hMSCs, a

cells was found in blood vessels of

PBS (Fig. 2A, B; P < 0.01, 3D hMSC group vs. monolayer
hMSC group or PBS group; P > 0.05, monolayer hMSC
group vs. PBS group). On day 14, the remaining infarct
volume in 3D hMSC group was reduced to 27.1% (n = 6,
P < 0.01, the infarct volume at day 1 was considered as
100%); however, modest reductions were found in the
monolayer hMSC group (remaining infarct volume 57.41%,

n = 6) and in the PBS group (remaining infarct volume
61.21%, n = 5, P > 0.05 between monolayer and PBS groups)
(Fig. 2A, B). Moreover, we measured infarct areas in coronal slices of the brain with TTC stain 14 days post-MCAO.
There was a significant reduction in infarct size in rats
treated with 3D spheroid hMSCs, compared with rats treated
with monolayer hMSCs (n = 6, P < 0.01) or PBS (n = 5,
P < 0.01) (Fig. 2C, D).

Representative images of brain sections at 14 days post-MCAO were shown. Infarcts are shown as pale (unstained) regions

MSC groups, n = 5 in PBS group, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01]. Color images available online at www.liebertpub.com/scd

Meanwhile, we assessed the number of hMSCs engrafted
into the lesion site at 3, 7, and 14 days after cell transplantation. There were significantly more M1281-positive
cells in the lesion of rats that received spheroid hMSCs
compared with rats that received monolayer hMSCs at 3
days (44.75 – 4.21 vs. 28.41 – 0.53, n = 5, P < 0.05). Although the numbers of hMSCs in the lesion declined in both
animal groups, there were significantly more spheroid
hMSCs remaining at 7 (37.85 – 3.73 vs. 23.17 – 1.17, n = 5,
P < 0.05) and 14 days (25.37 – 2.31 vs. 17.33 – 1.82, n = 5,
P < 0.05) than monolayer hMSCs (Fig. 3A, B). Moreover,
there were much fewer cells positive for caspase-3 in the
infarct border zone in rats treated with spheroid hMSCs,
compared with rats treated with PBS or monolayer hMSCs
(Fig. 3C).

Spheroid hMSCs restore neurologic functions
To examine whether spheroid hMSCs led to enhanced
recovery of neurologic functions of the brain after stroke, a
battery of functional tests were performed. Functional response was measured for each animal on 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,
and 14 days following MCAO. Prior to MCAO, there was
no neurological defect in all rats. One day after MCAO and

before MSC transplantation, no significant differences were
found in neurologic functional defect among three groups.
Rats receiving 3D spheroid hMSCs exhibited significantly
improved performance in mNSS (Fig. 4A, n = 8) and adhesive removal test (Fig. 4B, n = 8; Fig. 2C, n = 8) from 3 to
14 days after MCAO, compared with monolayer-hMSCtreated rats (P < 0.05) and PBS-treated rats (P < 0.05) (Fig.
3). There were no significant differences in adhesiveremoval test between monolayer-hMSC-treated rats and
PBS-treated rats (P > 0.05). However, monolayer-hMSCtreated rats (n = 8) significantly ameliorated the neurological severity in MCAO rats at 14 days, compared with
PBS-treated rats (P < 0.05).

Spheroid hMSCs exhibit enhanced capacity
of neuronal differentiation
To examine the capability of neuronal differentiation of
hMSCs derived from spheroids or monolayers, we first
cultured the cells in neurogenic induction medium. Realtime PCR analysis revealed that spheroid hMSCs expressed
higher mRNA levels of neural-specific genes Nestin, MAP2, and GFAP, upon neurogenic induction for 3 and 7 days
(Supplementary Fig. S1B, C), compared with monolayer

hMSCs. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that, before
the induction, MAP-2-expressing hMSCs were barely detected and nestin expression was found in a small fraction of
hMSCs; however, after the induction for 3 days, the number
of hMSCs positive for MAP-2 or nestin dramatically increased, and a much higher proportion of nestin- or MAP-2positive cells were detected in hMSC spheroids than in
monolayer cultures (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S1A).

To further examine whether spheroid hMSCs exhibited
enhanced neuronal differentiation in vivo, tissue sections of
the brain were costained with antibodies against neuronspecific protein MAP-2 (or astrocyte-specific protein GFAP)
and the human-specific nuclear protein (antibody M1281).
We found that a significantly increased proportion of
spheroid hMSCs expressed MAP-2, compared with monolayer hMSCs (5.48 – 8.9% vs. 1.87 – 0.9%, n = 5, P < 0.01)

of MAP-2-positive hMSCs in
spheroid hMSCs compared

(Fig. 5B, C), in the lesion of 7 days. Meanwhile, the proportion of GFAP + /M1281 + cells increased slightly in
spheroid hMSCs than in monolayer hMSCs in the tissue
(n = 5, P < 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. S2A, B).

Spheroid hMSCs increase angiogenesis
in the infarcted brain
Angiogenesis in the ischemic boundary zone of the brain
with MACO was determined on days 3 and 7 post-hMSC
transplantation. Immunofluorescence staining with antibodies against Von Willebrand factor (vWF) or a-smooth
muscle actin (a-SMA) showed that there was a significant
increase in the density of blood vessels in spheroid-hMSCtreated rats at days 3 and 7, compared with monolayerhMSC-treated animals or PBS-treated animals (Fig. 6A–C,
n = 5, P < 0.01). A modest but significant increase in blood
vessel density was also found in monolayer-hMSC-treated
animals than in PBS-treated animals at both 3 and 7 (n = 5,
P < 0.05) days following hMSC transplantation. Moreover,
double stain for BrdU + /vWF + or BrdU + /a-SMA + showed
that the new blood vessels were largely colocalized in the
ischemic boundary zone (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Since paracrine factors secreted by MSCs may contribute
to angiogenesis, we tested the expression levels of antiinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-11,
and IL-13] and growth factors [VEGF, bFGF, neurotrophin3 (NT3), and glial derived neurotrophic factor cell (GDNF)]
in monolayer and spheroid hMSCs. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the mRNA levels of IL-10, IL-11, IL-13,
VEGF, NT3, and GDNF were significantly higher in spheroid hMSCs than in monolayer hMSCs (Supplementary
Fig. S4A, B). Moreover, enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay analysis of the conditioned media indicated that 3D
hMSCs secreted greater amounts of VEGF and bFGF
(Supplementary Fig. S4C, D).

Spheroid hMSCs enhance proliferation
of GFAP-expressing progenitors
To determine whether markedly enhanced reduction of
infarct volume and restoration of neurologic functions in
spheroid-hMSC-treated rats were associated with increased
structural restoration, we examined neurogenesis in the
lesion site after MCAO. Immunofluorescence stain of coronal sections of the brain 3 days after cell transplantation

showed substantially increased numbers of GFAP-positive
cells in the infarct border zone in rats treated with spheroid
hMSCs, which were in higher density and formed a broader
band around the infarct, compared with rats treated with
monolayer hMSCs or PBS (Fig. 7A, B, n = 5, P < 0.01).
Since both mature astrocytes and neural stem cells express
GFAP, we examined whether the GFAP + cells in the
boundary zone expressed stem cell markers. Immunofluorescence staining of the tissue sections with a neural
stem cell marker nestin and a pluripotent marker Sox2
showed that the highest amount of GFAP + /nestin + cells
were localized to the front of the migrating GFAP + cells
immediately adjacent to the infarct in the boundary zone,
whereas in the remote zone, further apart from the infarct
area, almost no GFAP + /nestin + cells were found (Fig. 7A).
The GFAP + /nestin + band around the infarct in rats treated
with spheroid hMSCs was much thicker compared with rats
treated with PBS (320.59 – 9.58 mm vs. 76.12 – 4.67 mm, n = 5,
P < 0.01) or monolayer hMSCs (100.34 – 7.24 mm, n = 5,
P < 0.01) (Fig. 7A, B). Moreover, we found that in rats treated
with spheroid hMSCs, 73.2% of GFAP + cells expressed
Sox2, compared with 54.27 – 2.81% in rats treated with
monolayer hMSCs (n = 5, P < 0.01) and 56.15 – 6.69% in rats
treated with PBS (n = 5, P < 0.01) (Supplementary Fig. S5).
To understand whether the GFAP + cells in the infarct border
zone were proliferating, BrdU was injected into rats. Brain

tissue sections were immunostained with antibodies against
BrdU and GFAP. We found significantly higher levels of
GFAP + /BrdU + proliferating cells in rats that received spheroid hMSCs, compared with rats that received PBS (n = 5,
P < 0.01) or monolayer hMSCs (n = 5, P < 0.01) at 3 days (Fig.
7C, D). In morphology, the GFAP + /BrdU + cells in the infarct
predominantly had no processes, the cells adjacent to the infarct
were largely unipolar with a process directing to the infarct, and
the cells further away from the infarct showed more processes.

Discussion
The therapeutic effect of MSCs in tissue repair/regeneration is significantly affected by their repair capacity and the
number of cells engrafted into the target tissue [10,15]. Inappropriate culture expansion impairs the properties of
MSCs critical for tissue repair and regeneration. Previous
studies indicate that the homing efficiency of cultureexpanded MSCs is poor. Upon intravenous infusion, over
80% of MSCs are entrapped in lungs, where most of them
die in 24 h, and only < 1% of MSCs are detected in the
ischemic heart or brain [16,17]. Though a beneficial effect
of intravenously administered MSCs in improving functional recovery of stroke has been observed [9,23], controversial results have been reported with the reduction of
infarct size [24]. Low levels of engraftment of MSCs in the

986

injured cerebral tissue particularly limit their regenerative
potential through differentiation into neural cells. Therefore,
to achieve maximal effect of MSCs in tissue regeneration,
both the culture condition and the administration approach
have to be improved. Previous studies have shown that
MSCs cultured in 3D spheroids exhibit upregulated ex-

pression of paracrine factors important for tissue regeneration, but unaffected engraftment into the infarcted
myocardium after intravenous infusion [14,16,18]. To increase engraftment, we injected the cells through the internal carotid artery. This led to a substantial engraftment of
the cells into the injured cerebral tissue. We found more

hMSCs derived from spheroids in the lesion than hMSCs
derived from monolayer culture. This is probably due to
improved response of spheroid hMSCs to chemokines in the
ischemic cerebral tissue due to increased expression of
chemokine receptors on the surface of spheroid MSCs such
as CXCR4 [18,25].
Neurogenesis is an ideal therapeutic strategy to restore the
lost structure and function of the cerebrum after stroke.
MSCs have been shown to acquire phenotypes of neural
lineage cells in vitro upon chemical inductions in numerous
studies [26]; however, low frequency of neuronal differentiation of MSCs has been found in vivo [27]. We proposed
that this might be largely due to reduced neurogenic dif-

(Continued)
ferentiation ability of MSCs after culture expansion. MSCs
expanded in monolayer culture undergo spontaneous differentiation toward osteoblasts [12]. Recent studies suggest
that 3D spheroid culture increases the multipotency of
MSCs [18,28]. In this study, we found that spheroid hMSCs
had increased capacity of neurogenic differentiation in vitro
and in vivo. Notably, over 5% of spheroid hMSCs engrafted
into the injured cerebrum expressed MAP-2, a neuronspecific gene. In consideration of significantly increased
abundance of spheroid MSCs in the lesion, neurons derived
from MSCs may account for a part in neurogenesis.
We found that spheroid hMSCs significantly increased the
number of GFAP-expressing neural progenitors in the

988

ischemic lesion. They were predominantly localized to the
ischemic boundary zone after MCAO, expressed nestin and
Sox2, features of neural stem cells [29–31], and were actively
proliferating. Several lines of evidence indicate that GFAPexpressing astrocyte-like cells in the brain are the principal
source of constitutive neurogenesis in rodents and humans
[29,32], which are capable of differentiating into neurons,
oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes [31,32]. Neurogenesis following stroke has been observed in many studies [33].
However, this appears not to change the outcome of stroke.
Increasing evidence indicates that while stroke injury is necessary to activate quiescent endogenous neural stem cells,
local non-permissive cues, the inflammatory response and
poor blood supply affect the survival and maturation of the
newly formed neurons [31,33]. In this study, we observed a
substantial enhancement in GFAP-positive progenitor cells 3
and 14 days following transplantation of spheroid MSCs,
along with a remarkable reduction in infarct size and functional restoration. This may largely attribute to the enhancement of anti-inflammatory effect of spheroid MSCs. Previous
studies indicate that 3D spheroid culture profoundly upregulates the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as
tumor necrosis factor-a stimulated gene/protein-6 (TSG-6) but
not influence the expression of proinflammatory cytokines
such as IL-6 [14,16,18]. These results suggest that besides
generating new neurons, MSCs in the lesion release paracrine
factors that provide a favorable niche for neurogenesis.
We observed a modest effect of monolayer MSCs in improving functional recovery of stroke, which were substantially
less effective than spheroid MSCs. Monolayer MSCs significantly improved angiogenesis at 3 and 7 days and mNSS after the
first week, but failed to reduce the infarct size. This is in agreement with several previous studies, where modest benefit of
monolayer-cultured MSCs in improving functional outcomes
but not the infarct size of stroke has been observed [20,24]. On
the other hand, it has been suggested that repeated intravenous
injections of monolayer MSCs or injection of non-culture-passaged primary MSCs may reduce the infarct size [34,35]. In our
study, the benefit of monolayer MSCs was likely dampened by
their side effect in vascular obstruction. Intra-arterial injection of
monolayer MSCs likely caused embolism and microinfarction.
We noticed a transient worsening of neurologic function and
severe obstruction of retinal arteries and blindness in some animals following intra-carotid injection of monolayer MSCs (average diameter 25 mm). This is in agreement with previous
studies where intracoronary delivery of MSCs (average diameter
20 mm) expanded in monolayer culture caused acute myocardial
infarction in dogs and reduction of coronary blood flow in pigs
[36,37]. It has been recognized that MSCs become substantially
enlarged upon monolayer culture expansion [18,36]. In consistence with previous findings [18], we found that 3D spheroid
culture significantly reduced the size of MSCs *40% (from
average diameter 25 mm to average dimmer 15 mm). Cell size has
been suggested as a critical parameter of vascular obstructions in
a recent study [38]. Our results indicate that 3D-spheroid-cultured MSCs are safer and more effective than conventionally
monolayer-cultured MSCs for intra-artery administration.
We used MSCs derived from human placenta. Placentaderived MSCs exhibit typical features of MSCs, such as cell
morphology, the expression of surface antigens, and differentiation capacities into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and
osteoblasts [12]. In addition, we found that placenta MSCs

GUO ET AL.

demonstrated similar alterations in 3D spheroids in cell size
and in the expression of cytokines to bone-marrow-derived
MSCs [14,18]. Therefore, the benefit of spheroid culture
found in placenta MSCs is likely to apply to MSCs derived
from other tissue sources.
In conclusion, unlike MSCs grown in monolayer culture,
MSCs cultured in 3D spheroids did not cause vascular obstructions after intra-carotid infusion, and resulted in substantial engraftment into the ischemic cerebral lesion in rats.
Spheroid MSCs, but not monolayer MSCs, profoundly reduced
infarct size and restored neurologic function after stroke. In
addition, a significantly increased number of spheroid MSCs in
the lesion differentiated into MAP-2-expressing neuron-like
cells. Moreover, transplantation of spheroid MSCs markedly
increased number of GFAP-positive progenitor cells in the
infarct boundary zone. Our results indicate that spheroid MSCs
are superior to monolayer MSCs in safety and therapeutic efficacy, and suggest that spheroid MSCs, in combination with
intra-carotid administration, may represent a novel therapeutic
method of MSCs for stroke.
