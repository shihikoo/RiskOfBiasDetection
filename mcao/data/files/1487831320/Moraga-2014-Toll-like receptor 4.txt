Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mediates
brain damage after stroke. Now our objective is to
determine TLR4 involvement in stroke-induced neurogenesis. Stroke was induced by permanent middle
cerebral artery occlusion in wild-type and TLR4-deficient mice. Stereological and densitometric analysis of
immunofluorescence-labeled brain sections and FACS
analysis of cell suspensions were performed. Our results show that subventricular zone (SVZ) cell proliferation after stroke depends on infarct size. Second,
when comparing brains with similar lesions, TLR4
attenuated SVZ proliferation, as shown by a decrease in
prominin-1ⴙ/EGFRⴙ/nestinⴚ cells (type-C cells) at 1–2
d, and in BrdUⴙ cells at 7 d, in TLR4ⴙ/ⴙ vs. TLR4ⴚ/ⴚ
mice. Interestingly, 7 d after the infarct, neuroblasts in
TLR4ⴙ/ⴙ mice migrated farther distances, reaching
areas closer to the lesion than those in TLR4-deficient
mice. However, at 14 d, TLR4-deficient mice presented
a higher number of neuroblasts in all migratory zones
than the TLR4ⴙ/ⴙ counterparts, which suggests that
TLR4 deficiency delays neuroblast migration. Consistently, TLR4ⴙ/ⴙ mice showed an increased number of
interneurons (NeuNⴙ/BrdUⴙ/GAD67ⴙ cells) in periinfarct cortex 14 –28 d after stroke. Our data indicate that,
despite a negative effect on SVZ cell proliferation, TLR4
plays an important role in stroke-induced neurogenesis by
promoting neuroblasts migration and increasing the number of new cortical neurons after stroke.—Moraga, A.,

Ischemic stroke is a devastating illness and the
second cause of death and disability worldwide after
cardiac ischemia. Currently, thrombolysis with tissue
plasminogen activator (t-PA) is the only effective therapy for the acute-phase of stroke, however, owing to the
narrow therapeutic window of ⬍4.5 h and safety concerns,
fewer than 5% of stroke patients receive this treatment,
reaching an effective reperfusion in ⬃50% of them. In
contrast, a broader window exists to promote repair in
late phases and to decrease stroke-associated disability.
Therefore, stroke remains an enormous therapeutic
challenge. Therapies based on immunomodulation,
although promising, require a better understanding of
the reciprocal interaction between the brain and the
immune system.
Innate immunity, promoting inflammatory response,
participates in the brain damage produced by ischemia.
Indeed, we and others demonstrated the implication of
toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a receptor with a fundamental role in the activation of the innate immunity, in
the acute cerebral damage and in the inflammatory
response elicited by an ischemic injury (1– 4). In addition, TLR4 appears to play an important role in adult
neurogenesis. In this context, Schwartz et al. (5) showed
the implication of TLR4 in the modulation of the
hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult rat under physiological conditions. Both in vitro and in vivo studies
demonstrated that TLR4 induces an inhibition of neuronal proliferation and differentiation. Nevertheless,
the role of TLR4 and the mechanisms that regulate
neurogenesis in pathological situations such as stroke
are still unknown.
Therefore, this study aims to determine the role of
TLR4 on neurogenesis in pathological conditions by
studying proliferation, migration, and differentiation
processes after experimental stroke induced by an
occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in
TLR4-deficient mice (C57BL/10ScNJ) and animals
that express TLR4 normally.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Adult male C57BL/10ScNJ and C57BL/10J mice (2–3 mo)
were used (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA). The
murine strain C57BL/10ScNJ does not express TLR4 because
of a naturally total deletion of the TLR4 gene (6). C57BL/10J
substrain does not express the mutation, and it is considered
as the wild-type group (TLR4⫹/⫹ group). All experimental
protocols adhered to the guidelines of the Animal Welfare
Committee of the Universidad Complutense (EU directives
86/609/CEE and 2003/65/CE). Mice were housed under
standard conditions of temperature and humidity and a 12-h
light-dark cycle (lights on at 08:00) with free access to food
and water.
Induction of permanent focal ischemia
All groups were performed and quantified in a randomized
fashion (coin toss) by investigators blinded to each specific
treatment. Surgery leading to focal cerebral ischemia was
conducted under anesthesia with isoflurane in a mix of O2
and N2O (0.2/0.8 L/min). During surgery, body temperature
was maintained at 37.0 ⫾ 0.5°C using a servo-controlled rectal
probe– heating pad. Mice were subjected to a permanent
MCA occlusion (pMCAO) described by Chen et al. (7). A
small craniotomy was made over the trunk of the left MCA
and above the rhinal fissure. The pMCAO was done by
ligature of the trunk just before its bifurcation between the
frontal and parietal branches with a 9 – 0 suture (proximal
occlusion). To obtain smaller infarct volumes and thus to
avoid the bias due to different infarct sizes on the end points
of the study, we included an additional group in which the
occlusion was performed in the same way but more distally, at
a posterior branch of the MCA of TLR4⫹/⫹ mice (distal
occlusion). The resulting infarcted areas were similar, and
the quantifications were carried out in the central regions,
where the differences are not significant. Complete interruption of blood flow was confirmed under an operating microscope. Sham surgery animals, considered as control group,
were subjected to anesthesia and to the surgical procedure,
but the occlusion of the arteries was omitted.
Physiological parameters (rectal temperature, mean arterial pressure, pO2, pCO2, pH) were not significantly different
between all studied groups (data not shown). No spontaneous mortality was found after MCAO with this model, and this
was unaffected by the different experimental groups. 5-Bromo-2=-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 50 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally once daily from d 5 to 6 after ischemia. Cell proliferation was quantified at 7, 14, and 28 d after ischemia by
immunohistochemical studies.
Infarct size determination
For infarct size determination 2 d after MCAO, magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) examination was performed using
a BioSpec BMT 47/40 (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany). Infarct
volume was calculated using ImageJ 1.44l (U.S. National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) from the T2weighted images.
In addition, infarct volume was determined by Nissl staining at later times: Animals subjected to pMCAO were killed at
7, 14, and 28 d after surgery and subjected to perfusion
fixation with 4% p-formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4); brains were then frozen, serially sectioned at 40 ␮m,
and stained with conventional histological Nissl (0.1% cresyl
violet) staining. With the observer masked to the experimen-

tal conditions, the areas of the infarcted tissue (AInf), the
whole ipsilesional hemisphere (AIps), and the whole contralesional hemisphere (AContr) were delineated for each slice.
Then, infarct volume (VInf), expressed as percentage of the
hemisphere that is infarcted (%HInf), was calculated as described previously (8) using the formula %HInf⫽ VInf/VContr ⴱ
100, where VInf ⫽ 冱 AInf_i/SIi, SI is swelling index, VContr ⫽
冱 AContr_i, and SIi ⫽ AIps_i/AContr_i.
Immunofluorescence staining
Animals (n⫽6 –7/group) were killed at 7, 14, or 28 d after
MCAO by pentobarbital overdose followed by transcardiac
perfusion through the left ventricle with 0.1 M phosphate
buffer as a vascular rinse, followed by a fixing solution
containing 4% p-formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4). Brains were removed, postfixed overnight, and
placed in 30% sucrose for 48 h. Coronal series sections (40
␮m) were cut on a freezing microtome (Leica SM2000R;
Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) and stored in
cryoprotective solution. Double-label immunofluorescence was
performed on free-floating sections and incubated overnight at
4°C with the primary antibodies rat anti-BrdU (1:100; ABD
Serotec, Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules CA, USA), mouse
anti-TLR4 (1:20; Abcam plc, Cambridge, UK), anti-doublecortin
(DCX; 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany),
anti-neuronal nuclei (NeuN; 1:200; MAB 377; Millipore, Billerica MA, USA), and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 67
(GAD67; 1:200; Abcam). After incubating with the primary
antibody, sections were washed and incubated with the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibody: goat anti-rabbit
biotin and horse anti-goat biotin (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK) in combination with Alexa488 streptavidin
(Molecular Probes; Life Techologies, Madrid, Spain), Alexa647 (Invitrogen SA, Barcelona, Spain), and donkey Cy3
anti-rat/anti-mouse (Jackson Immunoresearch, Suffolk, UK).
Controls performed in parallel without primary antibodies
showed very low levels of nonspecific staining.
Cell and optical density quantification on confocal images
For the study of neuroblasts (DCX⫹ cells), immunofluorescence images were obtained in a blinded manner from 4
correlative slices of each brain. Stacks at ⫻20 of the subventricular zone (SVZ; Z1) were obtained. In addition, two
adjacent images (Z2 and Z3) along the corpus callosum were
also obtained. With the ImageJ 1.44l software, each image was
converted into a binary image, and the integrated density
(DInt) was calculated. DInt is a calculus of the mean stained
area times the intensity of stain in each pixel in the area and
indicates the total amount of staining material in that area.
For neuronal differentiation (BrdU⫹/NeuN⫹ cells), immunofluorescence images were taken from 5 correlated
sections beginning at 1.70 mm from bregma (until 0.02 mm).
The images were taken at ⫻40, spaced 400 ␮m from each
other. The entire top of the cortex was traced and 800 ␮m
below the stroke, using as boundaries the corpus callosum
and the end of the cortex, by analyzing a total of ⬃16 –18
images per hemisphere and section.
Unbiased stereology
The total volume of the dorsolateral striatal extension of the
SVZ was estimated by the application of the Cavalieri principle on 7 serial sections per brain (40 ␮m thickness, 0.32 mm
apart; bregma 1.70 to ⫺0.54 mm). The morphological criteria
used for the consistent delineation of the SVZ are described
elsewhere (9). Stereological estimation of the total number of

BrdU⫹ cells in the dorsolateral extension of the SVZ was
performed using the optical fractionator method (10). The
specific parameters used for stereological sampling and quantification of BrdU⫹ cells are summarized in Table 1.
Brain dissociation and cell suspensions analysis
by flow cytometry
Brain cell suspensions were prepared as described previously
(11, 12). Briefly, at 1 and 2 d after MCAO, mice brain is
rapidly removed. SVZs were dissected with a scalpel, placed
into 15 ml of ice-cold PBS and dissociated in a single cell
suspension using a gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec,
Madrid, Spain) with mechanical and enzymatic digestion
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell suspension
was filtered on 40 ␮m nylon mesh strainers and centrifuged at
300 g for 10 min at room temperature. Pellets were resuspended on 200 ␮l of 5% BSA in PBS with Fc block reagent.
Cell suspensions were colabeled with antibodies for TLR4/
MD2 complex (PE/Cy7 anti-TLR4/MD2 and its PE/Cy7
isotype control; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), neural
stem cell marker [anti-prominin1/CD133 (APC); Miltenyi
Biotec], a major marker of primitive neural stem cell (PE
anti-nestin; R&D Biolegend, London, UK) and a marker for
proliferative progenitors [epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), FITC anti-EGFR; Invitrogen; Life Technologies). For
labeling the cytoplasmic protein nestin, suspensions were
mixed with permeabilization solution (BD Cytofix/Cytoperm
Kit; BD Biosciences, Madrid, Spain) for 20 min at 4°C.
Stained cells from cortex and SVZs were washed and resuspended in 300 ␮l of FACS Flow (BD Pharmingen, San Jose,
CA, USA), and the whole suspension was acquired using a
FACSCalibur flow cytometer with CellQuest software (BD
Pharmingen). Isotype controls (Miltenyi Biotec) were used in
parallel.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as means ⫾ sd. Comparisons between
groups were performed using unpaired Student=s t test or 1-way
ANOVA with the Student-Newman Keuls post hoc test for multiple comparisons. Comparisons of semiquantitative scores were
analyzed with nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. Linear
association between 2 variables was determined by the Pearson correlation coefficient. Differences were considered significant at P ⬍ 0.05.

RESULTS
Effect of TLR4 on SVZ cell proliferation
TLR4 has been reported to inhibit cell proliferation
under physiological conditions (5). However, we could

not find any differences in the number of BrdU⫹ cells
7 and 14 d after stroke when TLR4⫹/⫹ and TLR4⫺/⫺
mice were compared (TLR4⫹/⫹ vs. TLR4⫺/⫺, P⬎0.05;
Fig. 1A).
Notably, and in agreement with our previous data
(1), TLR4⫹/⫹ mice presented significantly higher infarct volumes than TLR4-deficient mice (Fig. 1B,
P⬍0.05), a finding that might be involved in lack of
effect of TLR4 on SVZ cell proliferation. To ascertain
this issue, we studied whether infarct size was affecting
SVZ cell proliferation after stroke. For that, two groups
of normal mice were established: a first group in which
MCAO was performed on the trunk of the artery
(proximal occlusion) and a second group in which the
occlusion was made on the posterior branch of the
MCA (distal occlusion). As expected, the group with
the distal occlusion had significantly smaller infarct
volumes after the ischemic injury than the proximal
occlusion group (Fig. 2A; P⬍0.05). Interestingly, those
mice exposed to MCA proximal occlusion presented
higher numbers of BrdU⫹ cells at the SVZ at 7d than
the group with a distal occlusion (Fig. 2B; proximal
MCAO vs. distal MCAO; P⬍0.05). A strong positive
correlation was found between infarct size and cell
proliferation (BrdU⫹ cells) determined at the ipsilateral SVZ 7d after injury (Fig. 2C; r⫽0.812, n⫽10,
P⬍0.05). Furthermore, this correlation became negative when SVZ proliferation was measured 14 d after the
injury (r⫽⫺0.909, n⫽10, P⬍0.05), a time at which a
large proportion of newly proliferated cells may have
migrated to other areas.
Therefore, to study the effect of TLR4 on SVZ cell
proliferation without the influence of lesion size, a distal
occlusion in TLR4⫹/⫹ and a proximal occlusion in
TLR4⫺/⫺, which induce similar infarct volumes (Fig. 3A;
n⫽8, P⬎0.05), were compared for subsequent studies.
Our data demonstrate that the presence of TLR4
inhibits SVZ cell proliferation after MCAO, as demonstrated by a decreased number of BrdU⫹ cells in the
ipsilateral SVZ, determined 7 d after the ischemic
insult, when compared with the TLR4⫺/⫺ group with
similar infarct size (Fig. 3B, TLR4⫹/⫹ MCAO vs.
TLR4⫺/⫺ MCAO, P⬍0.05). Regarding sham surgery
TLR4⫹/⫹ mice, values of BrdU⫹ cells in the SVZ were
higher than those present in the MCAO group (Fig.
3B), which suggests an increased migration after
MCAO. However, no differences were found between
sham-operated and MCAO in the TLR4-deficient group
(Fig. 3B). Naive values were similar to those of shamoperated animals (data not shown).

To confirm this finding and to establish the nature of
the cells present in the SVZ, we also characterized by
flow cytometry the different cell types present in this
area at earlier times, 1 and 2 d after MCAO. First, our
results show the presence of two major cell populations:
a prominin-1⫹/EGFR⫹/nestin⫹ cell subset, corresponding to the primary neural stem cells (astrocyte-like type B
cells), and a prominin-1⫹/EGFR⫹/nestin⫺ cell subset,
consistent with the transit-amplifying cells (type C cells).
Notably, whereas in the prominin-1⫹/EGFR⫹/nestin⫹
population no differences were found between groups
(Fig. 3C), TLR4⫹/⫹ mice showed a smaller number of

prominin-1⫹/EGFR⫹/nestin⫺ cells than the TLR4⫺/⫺
mice after MCAO (Fig. 3C; TLR4⫹/⫹ MCAO vs.
TLR4⫺/⫺ MCAO; P⬍0.05), and also than its own sham
surgery condition (P⬍0.05; Fig. 3C), which suggests an
inhibitory role of TLR4 in the proliferation of type C
cells after stroke.

which ranged from the SVZ (Z1) through the corpus
callosum (Z2) toward the damaged area (Z3), 7 and
14 d after the ischemic insult. We found that the
density of neuroblasts (DCX⫹ cells) in Z3, but not in
Z1 and Z2, was higher in TLR4⫹/⫹ when compared
with TLR4-deficient mice 7 d after MCAO, consistent
with a faster migration process in TLR4⫹/⫹ animals.
Notably, 14 d after MCAO, the density of DCX⫹ cells
in all the migratory zones studied decreased in
TLR4⫹/⫹ when compared with TLR4-deficient mice
(Fig. 4; TLR4⫹/⫹ MCAO vs. TLR4⫺/⫺ MCAO, P⬍
0.05). These results suggest that, in TLR4⫹/⫹ mouse
brain, neuroblasts migrate faster toward the injured
area, whereas a hampered migration is found in
TLR4-deficient animals. In sham surgery mice, neuroblasts density was smaller than that present after
MCAO in both groups of mice (Table 2). Naive
values were similar to those of sham surgery animals.
We did not find any significant correlation between SVZ
cell proliferation and neuroblast migration (data not
shown).

Expression of TLR4 on type A, B, and C cells
We have studied the expression of TLR4 on type A cells
by immunofluorescence staining in brain sections. We
have found that neuroblasts (DCX⫹ cells) do not
express TLR4 in the SVZ, 7 d after the ischemic insult
(Fig. 5A). In addition, using flow cytometry, we show
that most type B cells (prominin-1⫹/EGFR⫹/nestin⫹
cells) express TLR4 1 d after MCAO, whereas only a
42% of type C cells (Prominin-1⫹/EGFR⫹/nestin⫺
cells) do (Fig. 5B).
Effect of TLR4 on the number of new neurons in the
peri-infarct cortex
Finally, we have studied the number of adult differentiated neurons (BrdU⫹/NeuN⫹ cells) in the ipsilesional cortex at 14 and 28 d after the ischemic insult.
Interestingly, we found that the presence of TLR4
increased the number of BrdU⫹/NeuN⫹ cells, at both
14 and 28 d, when compared with the group of TLR4⫺/⫺

mice (Fig. 6A; TLR4⫹/⫹ MCAO vs. TLR4⫺/⫺ MCAO,
P⬍0.05). We have also characterized the new neurons by
using an interneuron marker (GAD67). Thus, we found
that most BrdU⫹/NeuN⫹ cells in the peri-infarct cortex
14 d after ischemic injury were interneurons, as shown
by its staining with anti-GAD67 (Fig. 6B). These results
demonstrate that, despite reduced SVZ cell proliferation, the number of new interneurons in the periinfarct cortex is increased in TLR4⫹/⫹ mice. No new
neurons (BrdU⫹/NeuN⫹) were found in the cortex of
naive/sham surgery mice (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have explored the role of TLR4 on
neurogenesis after stroke by using a permanent model
of focal ischemia in mice expressing or not expressing

TLR4. Our data show that cell proliferation (BrdU⫹
cells) at the SVZ is dependent on infarct size after
stroke; TLR4 inhibits SVZ cell proliferation, as shown
by a decreased number of prominin-1⫹/EGFR⫹/nestin⫺ cells (transit-amplifying or type C cells) 1 and 2 d
and of BrdU⫹ cells 7 d after stroke; TLR4 promotes the
migration of neuroblasts, as shown by the fact that they
can reach a farther distance at earlier times after stroke
(7 d) in TLR4⫹/⫹ mice, whereas they accumulate in all
the migratory zones studied at late times (14 d) in
TLR4-deficient mice, and consistently, TLR4⫹/⫹ mice
present a higher number of mature neurons, which show
a GABAergic phenotype (NeuN⫹/BrdU⫹/GAD67⫹ cells)
consistent with interneurons, in the peri-infarct cortical
area at 14 and 28 d after stroke.
To our knowledge, we report for the first time that
SVZ cell proliferation, under ischemic conditions, depends on infarct size, as shown by the strong positive

correlation found between infarct size and cell proliferation determined at the ipsilateral SVZ 7 d after the
injury. It has been reported that large striatal ischemic
lesions are accompanied by an increased proliferation
at the SVZ in rats (13–15); however, the effect of
cortical lesions in mice and its direct relationship with
the size of the damaged area had not been described.
Interestingly, the correlation was negative when determined 14 d after the lesion. This finding can be
explained by the BrdU labeling protocol used, which
underestimates the proliferating population in the SVZ

after stroke, due to the fact that labeled cells are only
those proliferating when the BrdU pulse is applied,
corresponding to d 5– 6 after MCAO and, more important, that stroke not only affects SVZ cell proliferation
but also enhances the migration process of the new
cells toward the site of damage (15–18), decreasing the
number of proliferating cells at the SVZ and resulting
in no apparent changes when compared between different time points. Therefore, the number of proliferating cells at a certain time point in the SVZ results
from the balance between proliferation and migration.

In this context, our data obtained in sham surgery
animals showing higher values to those present in the
ischemic group, despite the positive correlation with
lesion size at 7 d, also support this affirmation and are
consistent with the proliferating population (15–21%)
described in postnatal animals (19, 20). However, no
correlation was found between SVZ cell proliferation
and neuroblast migration, suggesting that the number
of BrdU⫹ cells at the SVZ at the times studied is not
only affected by migration but also by modulation of
proliferation.
Second, and in line with our previous suggestion, our
data show that the presence of TLR4 inhibits SVZ cell
proliferation, as demonstrated by a decreased number
of prominin-1⫹/EGFR⫹/nestin⫺ cells at 1 and 2 d
(flow cytometry analysis), and of BrdU⫹ cells at 7 d
after the ischemic insult in the ipsilateral SVZ when
compared with the group of TLR4⫺/⫺ mice with a
similar infarct size. Specifically, our results show that
the presence of TLR4 inhibits the proliferation of the
population of prominin-1⫹/EGFR⫹/nestin⫺ cells,
which likely correspond to transit-amplifying cells (type
C cells), as described for the subgranular zone (transitamplifying type 3 cells; ref. 21) and which are cells in a
stage prior to becoming neuroblasts (type A cells) but
still maintaining their proliferative potential (EGFR⫹).
In contrast, astrocyte-like type B cells and proliferative
type C cells (2a and 2b; prominin-1⫹/EGFR⫹/nestin⫹)
do not seem to be affected by TLR4. Thus, our present
data are the first demonstration of the inhibitory role of
TLR4 on SVZ neural cell proliferation after an ischemic
insult. In agreement with our data, it has been shown
that TLR4 inhibits proliferation in the SVZ (5) in
physiological conditions, but the cell type involved or
the effect under pathological conditions remained unexplored. Of note, we have found that type B and 42%
of type C but not type A cells express TLR4. This is in
apparent controversy with our functional findings,
since the population with a majority expression of
TLR4 (type B cells) was not affected by the lack of this
receptor, whereas the cell subset with a heterogeneous
TLR4 expression was. A possible explanation is that
TLR4 affects cell proliferation only in some cell subsets,
as is the case with the proliferative subset of type C cells
that we have described. In addition, the effect of TLR4
on cell proliferation might be indirect, in such a way
that other cells, such as “surveillant” microglial cells in
charge of the elimination of newborn cells by phagocytosis (22), could be the direct effectors of TLR4 activation by regulating cell number of a “departing” target
type B population. Further studies are required to
elucidate this issue.
Third, we have shown that deficiency of TLR4 delays
the neuroblast migration process from the SVZ toward
the damaged area. In our study, we examined the
neuroblast population (type A cells; DCX⫹) in 3 migratory zones ranging from the SVZ (Z1) through the
corpus callosum (Z2) toward the damaged area (Z3), at
two different times, 7 and 14 d after the ischemic insult.
One week after the infarct, more neuroblasts in
TLR4⫹/⫹ mice could migrate a farther distance and to
reach areas closer to the injured region (Z3) than those
present in sections from TLR4-deficient mice. In con-

trast, at 14 d, whereas neuroblasts density in the three
areas decreased in TLR4⫹/⫹ mice when compared with
data from 7 d, consistent with their migration toward
the injured area, densities in Z1–Z3 of TLR4-deficient
mice were similar to values at 7 d, strongly suggesting
that TLR4 is crucial for neuroblast migration to damaged areas. A very interesting observation is that MCAO
clearly increases neuroblast migration when compared
with the respective sham surgery groups, as opposed to
the apparent lack of effect or even decrease in proliferation that, as discussed above, is likely due to migration. This finding strongly suggests that the major effect
of stroke on the neurogenesis process is exerted at the
level of migration, likely driven by intrinsic cues induced by the ischemic injury.
In line with the previous issue and as commented
above, stroke can promote the migration of neuroblasts
toward the site of damage (15–18), but the mechanisms
involved remain to be fully understood. Our studies are
the first to indicate that TLR4 is involved in this process.
Several studies have demonstrated that up-regulation of
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and stromal cell-derived factor 1␣ (SDF1␣) in damaged brain
provides the chemokine signals that attract neuroblasts
(23–25). In this context, previous data demonstrating
that MCP-1 expression is lower in TLR4-deficient mice
(26 –28) might explain—at least in part—the defective
migration in TLR4 deficiency. Furthermore, matrix
metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) is also required for neuroblast migration, as inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases has been demonstrated to significantly suppress the movement of neuroblasts from the SVZ to the
damaged tissue (29). Our previous results showing a
lower expression of MMP9 in TLR4-deficient mice after
stroke (1) might also explain the impaired migration
process that we have now described.
Finally, we have found the presence of new neurons
(NeuN⫹/BrdU⫹ cells) with a GABAergic, interneuron
(GAD67⫹ cells) phenotype in the cortical area at 14
and 28 d after stroke. Notably, TLR4-deficient mice
have a lesser number of new neurons, in accordance
with the suppression of the migratory process found.
Although the number found appears relatively low, it is
likely to be remarkably underestimated, as the figures
reported only represent the fraction of cells that reach
the infarct and differentiate into neurons among those
that proliferated at d 5– 6 after the injury, when the
BrdU pulse was applied.

CONCLUSIONS
Our present data indicate that, despite a negative effect
on SVZ cell proliferation, TLR4 plays an important role
in stroke-induced neurogenesis by promoting neuroblast migration and increasing the number of new
cortical interneurons in the chronic phase of stroke. An
interesting possibility is that, in a concerted action,
TLR4 curbs a likely excessive neural cell proliferation
while at the same time promotes an organized neuroblast migration toward the peri-infarct for an efficient
replacement of dead cells in the damaged area after
stroke.

To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that TLR4 regulates neurogenesis not only under
physiological conditions but also in a pathological
setting such as stroke. Despite the evidence showing a
deleterious role of TLR4 in the initiation of inflammation and subsequent brain damage in the acute-phase,
our present results unravel a new function in this
setting, which may be necessary for brain repair, by
promoting migration and neurogenesis during the
chronic phase of stroke.
