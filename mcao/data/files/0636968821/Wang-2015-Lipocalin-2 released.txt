Abstract
Thrombolysis remains the only effective therapy to reverse acute ischaemic stroke. However, delayed treatment may cause serious complications
including hemorrhagic transformation and reperfusion injury. The level of lipocalin-2 (LCN2) is elevated in the plasma of ischaemic stroke patients,
but its role in stroke is unknown. Here, we show that LCN2 was acutely induced in mice after ischaemic stroke and is an important mediator of
reperfusion injury. Increased levels of LCN2 were observed in mouse serum as early as 1 hr after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(tMCAO), reaching peak levels at 23 hrs. LCN2 was also detected in neutrophils infiltrating into the ipsilateral hemisphere, as well as a subset of
astrocytes after tMCAO, but not in neurons and microglia. Stroke injury, neurological deficits and infiltration of immune cells were markedly diminished in LCN2 null mice after tMCAO, but not after permanent MCAO (pMCAO). In vitro, recombinant LCN2 protein induced apoptosis in primary
cultured neurons in a dose-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that LCN2 is a neurotoxic factor secreted rapidly in response to cerebral
ischaemia, suggesting its potential usage as an early stroke biomarker and a novel therapeutic target to reduce stroke-reperfusion injury.

Introduction
Ischaemic stroke is the most common neurological disease in the
United States [1]. Although ischaemia per se is responsible for the
initiation of neuronal damage during stroke, reperfusion injury resulting from partial or complete recanalization may promote secondary
infarct growth and worsen functional outcome [2]. Reperfusion of
oxygenated blood is followed by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a series of inflammatory events including activation
and infiltration of circulating neutrophils, macrophages, and T-cells
into infarcted brain tissue. Post-ischaemic inflammation is necessary
for repair, but may have deleterious effects [3]. Thus, identifying neuroprotective and neurotoxic components of post-ischaemic inflammation is central to developing effective and balanced therapeutic
approaches to limit stroke-reperfusion injury.
Lipocalin-2 (LCN2), also known as 24p3 or neutrophil gelatinaseassociated lipocalin (NGAL), was originally identified as a 25 kD pro-

tein secreted by activated neutrophils [4]. Elevated plasma levels of
LCN2 have been detected in patients suffering from ischaemic stroke
[5, 6]. However, the role of LCN2 in stroke has not been defined. Molecular and cellular studies suggest that LCN2 is able to induce apoptosis
in the mouse pro-B lymphocytic cell line FL5.12 [7]. LCN2 is internalized by its putative cell surface receptor, brain type organic cation
transporter (BOCT). The internalized LCN2 chelates intracellular iron,
thereby reducing intracellular iron concentrations and mediating apoptosis. On the basis of this mechanism, it has been suggested that LCN2
may induce neuronal apoptosis during stroke-reperfusion injury. Here,
we report that LCN2 increases rapidly in response to cerebral ischaemia and promotes reperfusion injury in murine stroke. These results
support the hypothesis that early detection and inhibition of LCN2 may
prove useful in diagnosis and treatment of stroke-reperfusion injury.

ischaemia was induced by transient occlusion of the right MCA for 1 hr
with a silicon-coated monofilament suture (Doccol, Sharon, MA, USA)
[9]. Twenty-three hours after the tMCAO, we determined oedema-corrected infarct volumes and brain swelling from coronal brain slices
stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA). All procedures were conducted in accordance with
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee policies.

Regional cerebral blood flow
During focal cerebral ischaemia, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)
was continuously monitored by Laser Doppler Flowmetry (Perimed, Ardmore, PA, USA). Mice were excluded from further studies if sufficient
occlusion (<30% of the baseline) and reperfusion (>80% of the baseline) was not achieved, if excessive bleeding occurred during surgery,
or if haemorrhage was found in the brain slices or at the base of the
circle of Willis during post-mortem examination.

Neurological deficit scores and corner tests
Twenty-three hours after the initiation of ischaemic stroke, mice were
evaluated for neurological deficits using a four-tiered grading system
[9]. For the corner test, mice were placed between two vertical boards
[10]. The number of right (ipsilateral) turns when the mouse reached
the wedge of the corner was recorded in ten trials.

Collection of mouse serum and ELISA
At different time-points after ischaemic stroke, blood serum was collected for western blotting and ELISA. The level of LCN2 protein was
quantified following the manufacturerâ€™s protocol for mouse lipocalin-2/
NGAL Quantikine ELISA kit (R&D, Minneapolis, MN, USA).

Primary neuronal culture, oxygen glucose
deprivation and MTT assays
Primary mixed neuronal-glial cultures were prepared from the cerebral
cortex of post-natal day 1 (P1) to P3 mice as previously described
[11]. The culture was subjected to 1 hr of oxygen glucose deprivation
(OGD) and 23 hrs of reoxygenation [12]. The viability of cells after
treatments was analysed by MTT assays according to the protocols for
the Vybrant MTT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Molecular Probes, Grand
Island, NY, USA).

Western blot analysis
Ipsilateral (I, right) and contralateral (C, left) hemispheres were isolated
and homogenized using a Teflon-glass homogenizer as described [11].
Neutrophils were isolated from mouse bone marrow by Percoll density
gradient centrifugation [9]. Proteins within brain homogenates, cell
lysates and blood sera were separated by Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY, USA), and analysed by western blotting. Immunoreac-

1638

tive bands were detected using enhanced ECL (Pierce, Rockford, IL,
USA), imaged using a Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS-3000 (Fujifilm,
Edison, NJ, USA), and quantified by NIH ImageJ.

Immunofluorescence microscopy
Primary cultured neurons and brain sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained as described [11]. The images were
acquired using an Olympus (Center Valley, PA, USA) FV500/IX81 confocal microscope.

Statistical analysis
Quantitative data were expressed as mean  SEM and analysed using
Prism 5.0 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA). One or two-tailed unpaired ttests or one-way ANOVA with Newmanâ€“Keuls post hoc tests were
employed to determine statistical significance between means. The values of P < 0.05 in all tests were considered to be statistically significant.
The methods are described in detail in the Data S1.

Results
Acute induction of LCN2 in mouse serum after
ischaemic stroke
We first assessed the expression of LCN2 and its putative receptor
BOCT in neutrophils and neurons under non-ischaemic conditions.
LCN2 protein was enriched in neutrophils, but undetectable in neuronal cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast, BOCT protein was detected in cultured
neurons and brain tissues, but not neutrophils. Immunofluorescence
staining revealed a dense, punctate pattern of BOCT expression in
microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)-positive cultured neurons
(Fig. 1B) as well as neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN)-positive neurons
in cerebral cortex (Fig. 1C).
Previous studies demonstrated elevated levels of LCN2 in human
plasma 1â€“3 days after ischaemic stroke [5, 6]. To assess the time
course of LCN2 induction after ischaemic stroke, we occluded the
MCA for 1 hr and collected sera of wild-type (WT) and Lcn2 / mice
at 23 hrs after reperfusion [9]. A major immunoreactive band of
LCN2 (~25 kD) was detected in the sera of WT, but not Lcn2 / mice
(Fig. 2A). The expression of LCN2 was barely detectable in the control
sera of WT mice not subjected to tMCAO. To more carefully examine
the temporal profile of LCN2 induction, we analysed sera at different
intervals after tMCAO (Fig. 2B). Increased LCN2 levels were observed
1 hr after tMCAO, continued to rise between 4 and 23 hrs, and were
diminished by 48â€“72 hrs. The level of LCN2 protein was
133.1  18.3 ng/ml (6.4 nmol/L) in control mouse sera, comparable
with previous studies [8], but increased 41-fold to
5509  539.5 ng/ml (263.904 nmol/L) 23 hrs after tMCAO
(Fig. 2C).

Detection of LCN2 in the infiltrated neutrophils
and astrocytes
To determine whether LCN2 is induced in brain tissues after ischaemic stroke, we analysed brain homogenates of WT and Lcn2 / mice
before and after tMCAO (Fig. 3A). LCN2 protein was undetectable in
the uninjured brains of WT and Lcn2 / mice, but elevated in the ipsilateral (I), and faintly in the contralateral (C) hemispheres 23 hrs after
tMCAO (Fig. 3A). The LCN2 level measured by ELISA was
3.9  1.3 pmol/g (picomoles per gram of brain proteins) in the control brain tissues and reached 307.3  81.7 pmol/g in the ipsilateral
brain tissues 23 hrs after tMCAO (Fig. 3B), representing an 80-fold
increase in expression. The expression level of BOCT receptor in brain
homogenates was unchanged after tMCAO, and in the absence of
LCN2 (Fig. 3A).

We next assessed the cellular localization of LCN2 in the ipsilateral
hemispheres. Brain sections isolated 23 hrs after tMCAO were stained
with antibodies recognizing LCN2 and specific markers for neutrophils
(7/4), neurons (NeuN), microglia (Iba1) or astrocytes (GFAP). LCN2
was present in the 7/4-positive, blood-derived neutrophils surrounding striatal lesions (peri-infarct or penumbra area) in the ipsilateral
hemisphere (Fig. 3C). LCN2 expression was also detected in a subset
of GFAP-positive astrocytes in the ipsilateral hemisphere (Fig. 3D),
but not in NeuN-positive neurons or Iba1-positive microglia (data not
shown). To confirm the cellular distribution of LCN2, we subjected
primary mixed neuronal-glial cultures to OGD, an in vitro model of ischaemic stroke. After 1 hr of OGD and 23 hrs of reoxygenation, LCN2
was present in a subset of the GFAP-positive astrocytes, but absent in
MAP2-positive neurons and Iba1-positive microglia (Fig. 4). Some of
the LCN2-positive astrocytes displayed morphological characteristics

Reduced brain injury in LCN2 null mice after
transient, but not permanent, MCAO
To assess the effect of stroke-induced LCN2 in vivo, we subjected WT
and Lcn2 / mice to tMCAO with 1 hr of ischaemia followed by
23 hrs of reperfusion (Fig. 5). Infarct volume was reduced by ~56%
in Lcn2 / mice compared with WT mice (62.05  7.88 mm3 for
1640

WT versus 27.47  10.29 mm3 for Lcn2 / ; P < 0.05; Fig. 5A).
Likewise, brain swelling in the ipsilateral hemispheres was reduced
by ~60% in Lcn2 / mice (6.2%  1.4% for WT versus
2.5%  0.8% for Lcn2 / ; P < 0.05; Fig. 5B). Reduction in cerebral
infarct size and oedema in Lcn2 / mice was reflected in their functional outcome. Lcn2 / mice showed improved neurological outcome (P < 0.05; Fig. 5C) and reduced sensorimotor asymmetry in
corner tests (P < 0.05; Fig. 5D) compared to WT controls.
At baseline, Lcn2 / mice display normal motor and sensory
function and coordination [8, 14], and comparison of brains from WT
and Lcn2 / mice showed no gross differences in size or anatomy

(Fig. S1). To determine whether the attenuated brain damage in
Lcn2 / mice was because of changes in cerebral vasculature, we
examined the distribution of cerebral vessels by ink perfusion. No difference was observed in the origins of the MCA or other major blood
vessels of the circle of Willis (Fig. S1A), the degree of posterior communicating artery (PcomA) patency (Fig. S1A and B), and the size of
MCA territory (Fig. S1C and D). In addition, the rCBF in the MCA area
monitored by Laser Doppler Flowmetry (Fig. S1E) was similar
between WT and Lcn2 / mice before and during ischaemia, and
after reperfusion (Fig. S1F).
Since LCN2 was induced in both blood and brain tissues after
tMCAO, we evaluated the contribution of LCN2 from ischaemic brain
by minimizing the input of circulating blood using a permanent MCAO
(pMCAO) model in which the MCA was occluded for 24 hrs without
reperfusion (Fig. S2) [2, 15]. Infarct volume (55.58  9.69 mm3 for
WT versus 66.95  13.06 mm3 for Lcn2 / ; P > 0.05; Fig. S2A and

for WT versus 7.56%  1.99% for Lcn2 / ; P > 0.05; Fig. S2C)
was marginally increased in Lcn2 / mice after pMCAO. The neurological scores after pMCAO were slightly worse in Lcn2 / mice
(P > 0.05; Fig. S2D). The reduced stroke injury in LCN2 null mice
observed in the tMCAO, but not in the pMCAO model, suggests that
LCN2 is an essential factor mediating reperfusion injury after ischaemic stroke.

LCN2 mediated immune cell recruitment and
neuronal apoptosis
Peripheral immune cells infiltrate ischaemic brain tissue during reperfusion and exacerbate brain injury [2, 9]. Since LCN2 was detected
in infiltrating neutrophils after tMCAO (Fig. 3C), we determined
whether LCN2 deficiency affects the infiltration of circulating
immune cells. The presence of infiltrating immune cells in brain homogenates of WT and Lcn2 / mice were detected by western blotting using anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody. MPO is a key

enzyme expressed in blood-borne neutrophils, macrophages and
monocytes, and has been used as a marker for inflammation after
stroke [16]. Significantly increased amounts of MPO were present
after tMCAO in the ipsilateral hemispheres of WT, but not Lcn2 /
mice (Fig. 6A), demonstrating that LCN2 deficiency limited the infiltration of immune cells into ischaemic brain. The stroke-induced
MPO (Fig. 6B) and LCN2 (Fig. 6C) was minimally detected in the
pMCAO model and significantly lower than the tMCAO model, showing that the infiltration of immune cells in pMCAO was not as pronounced as in tMCAO.

collected at 23 hrs after 1 hr of tMCAO. The brain homogenates were prepared and analysed by western blotting using antibodies against MPO. bActin served as a loading control. Representative Western blots show the expression of MPO heavy chain (~55 kD) in brain homogenates. MPO
immunoreactivity normalized to b-Actin (MPO/Actin) was compared between means using one-way ANOVA with Newmanâ€“Keuls post hoc tests. There
was a significant induction of MPO after tMCAO (***P < 0.0001) compared with controls, and a significant reduction in MPO induction in the ipsilateral hemispheres of Lcn2 / mice (**P < 0.01). Immune cell infiltration (B) and LCN2 induction (C) in brains after tMCAO and pMCAO were analysed by western blotting using antibodies against MPO and LCN2, respectively. MPO or LCN2 immunoreactivity normalized to b-Actin (MPO/Actin
or LCN2/Actin) was compared between means using one-way ANOVA with Newmanâ€“Keuls post hoc tests. There was a significant reduction in MPO

Fig. 7 A proposed model for the sequence of LCN2 induction and its effect on neurons. (1) LCN2 is induced and released from astrocytes in
response to stroke-reperfusion injury. (2) The released LCN2 may cause the induction and release of LCN2 from cerebral endothelial cells and neutrophils, and stimulate the infiltration of circulating neutrophils. (3) LCN2 released from astrocytes and neutrophils may cause additional neuronal
cell death and (4) recruit circulating macrophages.

Infiltrating immune cells (e.g. neutrophils) release free radicals
and proteins that aggravate brain injury after reperfusion [2, 9]. LCN2
was originally identified as a secreted protein from neutrophils [4],
thus it is possible that LCN2 promotes neuronal injury in the tMCAO
model. To determine whether LCN2 directly mediates neuronal cell
death, we treated cultured neurons with increasing concentrations of
recombinant LCN2. Addition of LCN2 reduced cell viability (Fig. 6D)
and induced apoptotic cell death (Fig. 6E) in a concentration-dependent manner.

Discussion
Our results identify LCN2 as an acute-phase protein that mediates
reperfusion injury after ischaemic stroke in mice. The elevated level
of LCN2 after stroke may exacerbate cerebral infarction and contribute to poor neurological outcome by enhancing inflammatory
cell infiltration and promoting neuronal apoptosis. We detected the
induction of LCN2 in mouse serum within 1 hr after tMCAO
(Fig. 2), suggesting the possibility of using LCN2 as an early blood
biomarker of stroke. Nearly 95% of stroke patients are unable to
benefit from thrombolytic therapy because they are diagnosed
beyond a critical 4.5-hr time period following the onset of symptoms [17]. Development of rapid diagnostic assays using LCN2
may facilitate early diagnosis, reduce the risk of cerebral haemorrhage and increase the overall efficacy of thrombolytic therapy
[18].

Expression of LCN2 after stroke was increased not only in sera
but also in brain, where it was localized to infiltrating neutrophils and
a subset of astrocytes (Fig. 3 and 4). A recent study confirmed the
induction of LCN2 in astrocytes as well as cerebral endothelium after
tMCAO [19]. Minutes after ischaemic stroke, resident brain cells
including astrocytes release ROS, proinflammatory cytokines and
chemokines, thus inducing the expression of adhesion molecules on
cerebral endothelium and promoting transendothelial migration of circulating neutrophils [2]. Infiltrating neutrophils release ROS as well
as cytokines and chemokines that further amplify the brain-inflammatory response. It is likely that LCN2 from astrocytes initiates the neuroinflammatory event, causing release of LCN2 from cerebral
endothelium and circulating neutrophils (Fig. 7). The astrocyte-endothelial interactions have been well documented in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [20]. Several factors secreted by astrocytes such as
transforming growth factor-beta, src-suppressed C-kinase substrate,
and glial-derived neurotrophic factor affect the gene expression of
endothelial cells and the functions of BBB [21â€“23]. LCN2 expression
can be up-regulated by ROS [24], thus ROS released by reactive astrocytes and infiltrating neutrophils may also contribute to the induction of LCN2 in endothelium. Moreover, LCN2 released from
astrocytes and infiltrating neutrophils may cause additional neuronal
damage after ischaemic stroke (Fig. 7). A recent study [25] supports
our finding that recombinant LCN2 induced cell death in primary neurons (Fig. 6), but not in astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes.
These results suggest that LCN2 is selectively toxic to neurons, but
not neuroglia.

Our finding that the infiltration of MPO-positive immune cells is
reduced in LCN2 null mice after tMCAO is consistent with recent
reports focused on LCN2 function in other models. For example,
immune cell recruitment to the site of injury in LCN2 null mice is
diminished in mouse models of spinal cord injury [14] and heterotopic heart transplantation [26]. Neutrophils isolated from LCN2 null
mice display defective chemotaxis in vitro [27]. Moreover, recombinant LCN2 stimulates migration of neutrophils in vitro and in vivo
[28]. These results suggest that LCN2 is a paracrine chemoattractant
for immune cells during ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Similar proneuroinflammatory effects have been observed for S100A8 and
S100A9, two members in the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins
[29]. S100A8 and S100A9, also known as myeloid-related proteins 8
and 14, are abundantly expressed in neutrophils and stored in the
secondary granules where LCN2 is detected [4]. These two S100 proteins have been characterized as endogenous ligands of toll-like
receptor 4 [30], and stimulate neutrophil chemotaxis and transmigration [31]. S100A8 and S100A9 are induced in ischaemic hemispheres
after tMCAO and deficiency of these proteins reduces the accumulation of inflammatory cells as well as cerebral swelling and infarction
in post-ischaemic brain [32].
The plasma concentration of LCN2 is increased in patients after
ischaemic stroke [5, 6]. During a 4-year follow-up, stroke patients
with higher levels of LCN2 had higher cardiovascular mortality [6].
These results together with the findings in this report suggest that
LCN2 has detrimental effects following stroke. This raises the intriguing possibility that LCN2 inhibitors or anti-LCN2 antibodies could be
important therapeutic candidates to modulate post-ischaemic inflammation in patients with ischaemic stroke.
