Background and Purpose—This study aimed to assess the risk and benefit of tissue-type plasminogen activator treatment
after oral anticoagulation with rivaroxaban or apixaban compared with warfarin or placebo.
Methods—Pretreatment with warfarin (0.2 mg/kg per day), rivaroxaban (2 mg/kg per day), apixaban (10 mg/kg per day),
or vehicle (0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt) was performed for 7 days. Transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion was then induced for 120 minutes, followed by reperfusion with tissue-type plasminogen activator (10 mg/
kg per 10 mL). Clinical parameters, including cerebral infarction volume, hemorrhagic volume, and blood coagulation,
were examined. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, markers for the neurovascular unit at the peri-ischemic lesion were
immunohistochemically examined in brain sections, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity was measured by zymography.
Results—The paraparesis score was significantly improved in the rivaroxaban-pretreated group compared with the warfarinpretreated group. Intracerebral hemorrhage was observed in the warfarin-pretreated group, and this was reduced in the
rivaroxaban and apixaban-pretreated groups compared with the vehicle group. Marked dissociation of astrocyte foot
processes and the basal lamina or pericytes was observed in the warfarin-pretreated group, and this was improved in
the rivaroxaban and apixaban-pretreated groups. Furthermore, activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in the ipsilateral
warfarin-pretreated brain was greatly reduced in rivaroxaban- and apixaban-pretreated rats.
Conclusions—This study shows a lower risk of intracerebral hemorrhage after tissue-type plasminogen activator treatment
in rats with ischemic stroke that are pretreated with rivaroxaban and apixaban compared with pretreatment with warfarin.
Reducing neurovascular dissociation by rivaroxaban and apixaban compared with warfarin could partly explain a
reduction in hemorrhagic complications reported in clinical studies.   (Stroke. 2014;45:2404-2410.)

ardiogenic cerebral embolic stroke is the major cause of
stroke among elderly people in most developed countries.
The number of patients with atrial fibrillation has increased
according to the growing proportion of elderly individuals.
Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist, which greatly reduces the
risk of stroke. However, the major disadvantages of warfarin
are a narrow therapeutic range, drug and food interactions,
monitoring requirement, and a risk of bleeding. New oral anticoagulants (NOACs), such as rivaroxaban and apixaban, are
direct Xa inhibitors. These NOACs are considered as a major
breakthrough for the prevention of stroke in patients with
atrial fibrillation because they are noninferior or even superior
to warfarin for prevention of stroke and are superior for bleeding side effects without troublesome blood monitoring.1,2

A recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA),
alteplase, has achieved a great outcome for patients with
acute ischemic stroke, especially for cardiogenic embolism
because of atrial fibrillation. However, tPA is contraindicated
in patients on treatment with warfarin with a prothrombin
time (PT)–international normalized ratio >1.7 because of an
increased risk of bleeding. However, warfarin-treated patients
have a higher incidence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage after tPA treatment, despite a PT–international normalized ratio <1.7, compared with those not taking warfarin.3,4 In
contrast, warfarin use is not associated with secondary intracerebral hemorrhage after tPA treatment in patients with acute
ischemic stroke with a PT–international normalized ratio

Study,8 3.5% of patients showed symptomatic intracranial
hemorrhage.
However, there are only limited data on the safety of tPA
in warfarin-pretreated patients. Additionally, no guideline
is available whether tPA can be used for patients pretreated
with rivaroxaban or apixaban <4.5 hours of acute ischemic
stroke. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the risk and benefit of tPA treatment under NOACs compared with warfarin
or placebo.

Materials and Methods
Experimental Model

Male Wistar rats (SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) that were 11 weeks old
(body weight, 240–270 g) were divided into 4 groups: vehicletreated group (0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salt; V+tPA;
n=12), warfarin-treated group (0.2 mg/kg per day; W+tPA; n=13),
rivaroxaban-treated group (2 mg/kg per day; R+tPA; n=9), and apixaban-treated group (10 mg/kg per day; A+tPA; n=10; Figure I in the
online-only Data Supplement). For each drug, the dose and interval
between the last intake of drug and the induction of cerebral ischemia
were determined to inhibit clot formation by 70% in the rat venous
thromboembolism model.9–12 Each drug was administered orally for
7 days, starting from when rats were 11 weeks old. Warfarin and
rivaroxaban were administered once a day, and apixaban was administered twice a day. Body weight and blood pressure were measured
twice before the first and the last administrations. Blood (0.9 mL)
was drawn from the left femoral vein before and 1 hour after the
last administration of each drug. PT, activated PT (aPTT), and the
thrombin-antithrombin complex were measured. To measure glucose
levels, blood samples were also drawn before transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and immediately after reperfusion.
After 7 days of administration of the vehicle (12 weeks of age),
warfarin, rivaroxaban, or apixaban, the rats were anesthetized with
a mixture of nitrous oxide/oxygen/isoflurane (69%:30%:1%) during surgical preparation with an inhalation mask. Body temperature was monitored and maintained at 37±0.3°C by using a heating
pad during the surgical procedure. The right MCA was occluded by inserting a 4-0 surgical nylon thread with silicon coating
through the common carotid artery as described previously.13 After
120 minutes of tMCAO, the nylon thread was gently removed to
restore blood flow in the MCA territory, and the rats were treated
with tPA (Grtpa; Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, Osaka,
Japan; intravenous bolus, 10 mg/kg per 10 mL). To confirm the
effects of tMCAO, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the
right frontoparietal cortex region was measured under general anesthesia before, during tMCAO, and at reperfusion through a burr
hole using a laser blood flowmeter (Flo-C1; Omegawave, Tokyo,
Japan) as described previously.14 Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, blood pressure was measured and behavior was analyzed.
For histological examinations, after euthanization, the rats were
transcardially perfused with heparinized saline followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2). The
whole brain was removed and immersed in the same fixation for 12
hours at 4°C. After washing with PBS, the tissues were transferred
into 10%, 20%, and 30% (wt/vol) sucrose gradients and then embedded in powdered dry ice and stored at −80°C. Coronal brain sections,

which were 20 μm thick, were prepared using a cryostat at −18°C and
mounted on silane-coated glass slides.
For Western blot analyses and gelatin zymography, a different set
of rats (each group; n=5) was treated as above. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, the rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection
of pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with chilled
heparin (5 U/mL in PBS; pH 7.2). Brains were removed quickly and
divided into ipsilateral–peri-ischemic and contralateral–nonischemic
hemispheres. Each hemispheric brain was frozen immediately in dry
ice and stored at −80°C until use.
All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal
Committee of the Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry,
Okayama University (OKU-2013243).

Behavioral Analysis
Before cerebral ischemia and at 24 hours after reperfusion, the rats
were tested for behavioral activity and scored according to our previous report.15

Histology and Immunohistochemistry
To determine the area of ischemic lesions, sections were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin and examined under a light microscope
(Olympus SZX-12; Olympus Optical Co). Sections were cut at 2, 0,
−2, −4, and −6 mm from the bregma. The infarct area was measured
at these 5 sections by counting pixels using Photoshop CS5, and the
infarct volume was calculated by multiplying the infarct area by 2
mm of thickness.16 To analyze brain hemorrhage, iron staining was
performed using an enhanced Perl reaction. Brain sections were incubated with Perl solution (5% potassium ferrocyanide and 5% HCl;
1:1) for 45 minutes, washed in distilled water, and incubated again in
0.5% diamine benzidine tetrahydrochloride with nickel for 60 minutes as described previously.17
For immunohistochemistry, the following primary antibodies were
used: rabbit anti-collagen IV antibody (1:200; Novotec), mouse anti–
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody (1:1000; Chemicon),
and rabbit anti–platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRβ)
antibody (1:500; Abcam). To detect vascular endothelial cells,
N-acetylglucosamine oligomer (NAGO) was used as a specific endothelial cell marker.18 Brain sections were washed with PBS and then
incubated in 0.3% hydrogen peroxidase/methanol for 10 minutes to
block endogenous peroxidase activity. Sections were then incubated
with bovine serum albumin for 1 hour. They were incubated overnight at 4°C with mouse anti-GFAP antibody and rabbit anti-collagen
IV antibody or rabbit anti-PDGFRβ antibody, and with biotinylated
Lycopersicon esculentum lectin (1:500; Vector Laboratories), which
binds NAGO and rabbit anti-PDGFRβ antibody. The next day, the slices were washed in PBS and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature
with fluorochrome-coupled secondary antibody (1:500; Alexa Fluor;
Molecular Probes; A21424, A21429, and A11034). The sections
were then rinsed 3× in PBS and mounted with Vectashield mounting
medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories;
H1200). A confocal microscope equipped with argon and HeNe1 lasers (Zeiss; LSM 510) was used to capture fluorescent images.

or from pericytes in the GFAP/PDGFRβ double-labeled sections,
as well as the detachment of pericytes from vascular endothelial cells as assessed by PDGFRβ/NAGO. This assessment was
achieved by randomly choosing 3 levels of the caudate putamen
(1.2, 0.7, and 0.2 mm rostral to the bregma)19 in each rat, and 4 areas in the ipsilateral peri-infarcted cortex in each section. Sections
were viewed at ×100 magnification with a confocal laser microscope. We confirmed the border between the ischemic core and
peri-infarct lesion using cresyl violet staining of adjacent sections
according to a previous method.20 We measured the area between
astrocyte endfeet and the basement membrane of each blood vessel, as well as the length of each blood vessel. The area-to-length
ratio was then calculated as the vascular dissociation index.21 In
the same manner, the area between astrocyte endfeet and pericytes
as well as the area between pericytes and vascular endothelial
cells were measured, and the area-to-length ratio was calculated
in each blood vessel.

Gelatin Zymography
Gelatin zymography was performed using frozen brain tissue from
the cerebral cortex. Frozen brain samples were homogenized in
10× volume lysis buffer (150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, and 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl; pH 7.4) containing protease
inhibitors. After centrifugation at 9000g for 15 minutes at 4°C, the
supernatant was collected. The total protein concentration of each supernatant was spectrophotometrically determined using the Bradford
assay (Ultrospec 3100 Pro; GE Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan). The activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in each sample was
measured using a gelatin-zymography kit (Primary Cell, Sapporo,
Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, each
sample containing 20 μg protein was diluted with the homogenizing
buffer in the kit, mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer, and
loaded for electrophoresis for 2 hours. The gels were washed and
incubated for 24 hours in incubation buffer at 37°C and then stained
with Coomassie blue and scanned. Quantitative densitometric analysis was performed by Image J software.
Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the expression of
MMP-9. The online-only Data Supplement provides further details of
the method of Western blotting.

Statistical Analysis
All data are presented as mean±SD. Statistical analyses were performed using 1-factor ANOVA followed by Tukey–Kramer postcomparison test. Differences with a probability value of P<0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

Results
Clinical Scores
Mean body weight and systolic and diastolic blood pressure
were not significantly different among the 4 groups (Table
I in the online-only Data Supplement). rCBF immediately
declined to <40% of basal levels during tMCAO. After reperfusion, rCBF quickly recovered almost to basal levels in all of
the groups. There was no significant difference in rCBF before
tMCAO, during tMCAO, or at reperfusion among the 4 groups
(Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement). Although
40.9% of the W+tPA group died, only 25.0% of the R+tPA
group and 28.6% of the A+tPA group died by 24 hours after
reperfusion (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). The
paraparesis score was significantly improved in the R+tPA
group compared with the W+tPA group (2.6±4.6 versus
6.6±1.7; P<0.05; Figure 1A). Infarct volume was not different among the 4 groups (Figure 1B). Intracerebral hemorrhage was observed in the W+tPA group in coronal sections
(Figure 2), and this was greatly reduced in the R+tPA and
A+tPA groups compared with the V+tPA group (Figure 2).
Quantitative intracerebral hemorrhage volume was significantly larger in the W+tPA group than in the V+tPA group
(P<0.05). However, the R+tPA and A+tPA groups showed a
large reduction in hemorrhage volume (Figure 1C; P<0.05).

Blood Analysis
PT, aPTT, and thrombin–antithrombin complex at baseline
were not different among the groups (Figure 3A–3C). One
hour after the last administration of each drug, PT was significantly prolonged in the W+tPA and A+tPA groups compared with the V+tPA group (both P<0.01; Figure 3A). The
aPTT was not different among the 4 groups (Figure 3B).
Thrombin–antithrombin complex was significantly reduced in
the W+tPA (P<0.05), R+tPA (P<0.01), and A+tPA (P<0.01)
groups compared with the V+tPA group, but there was no difference among the W+tPA, R+tPA, and A+tPA groups. This
indicates that the antithrombotic effect was similar in the
W+tPA, R+tPA, and A+tPA groups.

groups (B). Thrombin–antithrombin complex (TAT) was significantly reduced in the W+tPA, rivaroxaban-treated (R+tPA), and A+tPA
groups compared with the V+tPA group, but there was no difference among the W+tPA, R+tPA, and A+tPA groups (C). *P<0.05; **P<0.01

Blood glucose levels were not different among the 4 groups
before tMCAO and immediately after reperfusion (Table II in

Neurovascular Unit
In the V+tPA group, little dissociation of the neurovascular
unit was found in peri-ischemic lesions (Figure 4A(a)). In
contrast, a marked dissociation of the basal lamina (collagen
IV) and astrocyte foot processes (GFAP) was observed in
peri-ischemic lesions of the W+tPA group (Figure 4A(a) and
4A(b); P<0.01 compared with V+tPA, R+tPA, and A+tPA
groups), and this was dramatically improved in the R+tPA
and A+tPA groups (Figure 4A(a) and 4A(b); P<0.01 compared with V+tPA, R+tPA, and A+tPA groups). Dissociation
of pericytes (PDGFRβ) and astrocyte foot processes (GFAP)
was significantly larger in the W+tPA group than in the
V+tPA, R+tPA, and A+tPA groups (Figure 4B(a); P<0.01).

MMP-9 expression in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex tended to
be higher compared with that of the contralateral side. There
was no difference in MMP-9 expression among the 4 groups

Zymography
Gelatin zymography showed that there was no activation and
no difference in MMP-9 activity in the contralateral cerebral
cortex among the 4 groups (Figure 6A and 6B). In contrast,
the ipsilateral cerebral cortex showed significant activation of
MMP-9 in the V+tPA and W+tPA groups compared with the
contralateral sides (Figure 6B; P<0.01). This ipsilateral activation in the W+tPA group was greatly reduced in the R+tPA

Discussion
In the present study, pretreatment with rivaroxaban and apixaban greatly improved the clinical score (Figure 1A) and
intracerebral hemorrhage (Figures 1C and 2) compared with
warfarin-pretreated rats after thrombolytic therapy with tPA.
In the Rivaroxaban Once daily oral direct factor Xa Inhibition
Compared with vitamin K antagonism for prevention of stroke
and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET-AF)
study, rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin in the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism.2 Additionally, there was
no significant between-group difference in the risk of major
bleeding, although intracranial and fatal bleeding occurred
less frequently in the rivaroxaban group than in the warfarin
group.2 In the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other
Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE)
trial, apixaban was superior to warfarin in preventing stroke
or systemic embolism, caused less bleeding, and resulted in
lower mortality.1
There is only 1 case report of rivaroxaban plus tPA combination therapy in patients with acute stroke.22 In that
case, the last dose of rivaroxaban was administered 22
hours before admission, when coagulation tests were normal, including PT, and the patient was discharged without
any considerable disability or hemorrhagic complications.
Rivaroxaban inhibits factor Xa activity and prolongs PT in a
dose-dependent manner. However, changes observed in PT
can be small, with a minimal effect at 24 hours after administration because the peak plasma concentration of rivaroxaban is 1 to 4 hours after administration and the plasma
half-life is 12 hours. Therefore, a patient with a long time
interval from administration of rivaroxaban to tPA and with
a normal PT may able to be safely treated with tPA, similar
to this previously reported case.22 There are no reports on
patients with acute stroke undergoing thrombolysis while
taking apixaban.
Which anticoagulant drugs have a high risk of intracerebral hemorrhage in combination with tPA administration is

difficult to determine because there is no common marker
to compare antithrombotic effects between warfarin and
NOACs. A PT assay was developed for monitoring inhibition
of the intrinsic pathway and is sensitive to warfarin. In contrast, direct factor Xa inhibitor only affects 1 enzyme in the
coagulation cascade. Rivaroxaban and apixaban have shown
a concentration-dependent prolongation of aPTT and PT in
previous reports.23,24 In the present study, significant prolongation of PT was observed in the W+tPA and A+tPA groups
(Figure 3A), but aPTT was not different among the 4 groups
(Figure 3B). Thrombin–antithrombin complex was significantly reduced in the W+tPA, R+tPA, and A+tPA groups
compared with the V+tPA group (Figure 3C). This finding indicated a similar antithrombotic effect in the W+tPA,
R+tPA, and A+tPA groups with each dose for obtaining 70%
inhibition of clot formation in the rat venous thromboembolism model.9–12
Various proinflammatory mediators, such as MMPs,
thrombin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and bradykinin, are increased in the ischemic brain,25–28 accompanied
by brain edema, endothelial cell death,29 disruption of tight
junctions, and loss of the basal lamina/extracellular matrix
(collagen IV, laminin-1, and fibronectin). These changes
could be involved in intracerebral hemorrhage associated
with tPA therapy.21,30 Several experiments have demonstrated that early inhibition of MMP-9 significantly reduces
brain infarct size.31–34 We recently reported that MMP-9
activation by warfarin plus tPA was improved in dabigatran-pretreated rats.15 We also observed a similar finding
in rivaroxaban- and apixaban-pretreated rats in the present
study (Figure 6).
In the present study, we also focused on pericytes, which
encircle endothelial cells and are important for the maturation and stabilization of capillaries during angiogenesis.
Interplay between pericytes and astrocytes through neurotrophins in the neurovascular unit may play an important role in neuronal survival under hypoxic conditions.
Ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury of pericytes may
impair microcirculatory reflow and negatively affect survival by limiting substrate and drug delivery to tissue
already under metabolic stress, despite recanalization of
an occluded artery.35 Pericytes also have erythrophagocytic
function, which prevents the exit of erythrocytes.36 We
previously reported a marked dissociation between astrocyte foot processes and pericytes in peri-ischemic lesions
of warfarin-pretreated rats, and this was dramatically
improved in dabigatran-pretreated rats.15 We also observed
a similar finding in rivaroxaban- and apixaban-pretreated
rats in the present study (Figure 4B). Dissociation between
astrocyte foot processes and pericytes could allow development of a neurovascular unit in intracerebral hemorrhage (Figures 1C, 2, 4 and 5).
In the present study, the reduction in rCBF during tMCAO
was mild. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that
the effects of warfarin, rivaroxaban, and apixaban on tPAinduced hemorrhagic transformation observed in this study
may have been influenced by the severity of stroke. We chose
the suture model in this study because satisfying the same

Kono et al   Reducing Hemorrhage by Rivaroxaban and Apixaban    2409
conditions of reperfusion in each group to evaluate neurovascular protection of NOACs was important. However, this
model is imperfect, and future studies using a clot approach
are warranted.
In summary, the present data suggest a lower risk of
intracerebral hemorrhage after tPA treatment in rats with
ischemic stroke that are pretreated with rivaroxaban and
apixaban compared with warfarin pretreatment. Activation
of MMP-9 with warfarin causes a marked dissociation of the
neurovascular unit, including pericytes, raising the risk of
intracerebral hemorrhage after tPA. This neurovascular dissociation is greatly ameliorated by replacing warfarin with
rivaroxaban and apixaban. This finding could partly explain
the mechanism of reducing hemorrhagic complications by
rivaroxaban and apixaban reported in the ROCKET-AF and
ARISTOTLE trials.

Supplemental Methods
Western blot analysis
For western blot analysis, the same samples as those for zymography were used. To
evaluate MMP-9 levels, 8 μg of total protein extract was loaded onto an 8%
polyacrylamide gel, and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. The gel was then transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane
(Millipore). The membrane was incubated in 5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline
with 0.2% Tween 20 at room temperature for 2 h, and then probed with primary
antibodies overnight at 4°C. The dilution of the primary antibody rabbit anti-MMP-9
was 1:2000 (Abcam). After being washed with PBS, the membranes were probed with
an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham
Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) for 1 h at room temperature.
Immunodetection was performed with an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce,
Rockford, IL). After electrochemiluminescence detection, the membranes were
incubated in stripping buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 0.7%
beta-mercaptoethanol) at 50°C for 15 min and then reprobed with a monoclonal
anti-β-tubulin antibody (1:20000; Sigma) as a loading control for protein quantification.
The signals were quantified with a Lumino image analyzer (LAS 1000-Mini; Fuji Film,
Tokyo, Japan), and quantitative densitometric analysis was performed by Image J. This
study aimed to assess the risk and benefit of tPA treatment under oral anticoagulation
with rivaroxaban or apixaban compared with warfarin or a placebo control.

Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of the right frontoparietal cortex region was measured
under general anesthesia before tMCAO, during tMCAO, and at reperfusion through a burr
hole using a laser blood flowmeter. In the tMCAO experiments, there was no significant
difference in rCBF among the 4 groups at any of the time points.
