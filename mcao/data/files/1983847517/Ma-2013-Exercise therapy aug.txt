Abstract: The induction of angiogenesis will stimulate endogenous recovery mechanisms,
which are involved in the long-term repair and restoration process of the brain after an
ischemic event. Here, we tested whether exercise influences the pro-angiogenic factors and
outcomes after cerebral infarction in rats. Wistar rats were exposed to two hours of
middle-cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion. Different durations of treadmill training
were performed on the rats. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-related genes and proteins were higher over
time post-ischemia, and exercise enhanced their expression. Sixteen days post-ischemia,
the regional cerebral blood flow in the ischemic striatum was significantly increased in the
running group over the sedentary. Although no difference was seen in infarct size between
the running and sedentary groups, running evidently improved the neurobehavioral score.
The effects of running on MMP2 expression, regional cerebral blood flow and outcome
were abolished when animals were treated with bevacizumab (BEV), a VEGF-targeting
antibody. Exercise therapy improves long-term stroke outcome by MMP2-VEGF-dependent
mechanisms related to improved cerebral blood flow.

1. Introduction
Exercise therapy is a well-known component of stroke rehabilitation programs [1–3]. After stroke,
the newborn neuroblasts migrate along peri-vascular routes [4], and promotion of angiogenesis
stimulates endogenous recovery mechanisms [5–8]. Exercise preconditioning enhances cerebrovascular
integrity [9] and improves angiogenesis and cerebral blood flow [10] in ischemic rats. Hence,
clarifying the molecular mechanisms by which exercise exerts its functions in neurovascular
remodeling may offer a potential breakthrough for the development of new methods that improve
long-term outcome after stroke.
Many studies have shown that the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression was
induced in experimental brain ischemia [11–16]. It has become clear that VEGF is important in the
hypoxic initiation of endothelial cell proliferation and migration that are required for angiogenesis to
occur [17]. When VEGF signaling was blocked with a receptor inhibitor, recruitment of new neurons
was impaired [18]. To accommodate the migration of the proliferating cells, a finely regulated
degradation of the basement membrane and surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) must occur.
Clearance of the basement membrane prior to release and migration requires the production of
ECM-degrading proteinases. One family of such enzymes is the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),
which are zinc proteases that cleave components of the ECM. The MMPs include three major types:
the collagenases, the stromelysins and the gelatinases [19]. They protracted pathophysiological cellular
remodeling that is triggered by ischemia [20]. An ischemic episode elicits upregulation of matrix
metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), MMP3, MMP7, MMP9 and MMP14 by endothelial cells, pericytes,
leukocytes and other components of the neurovascular epithelium [21]. Several MMPs are believed to
be important in angiogenesis, but particular interest has been focused on the MMP2 and MMP9, since
they preferentially degrade basement membrane components, such as type IV collagen [22]. Although
collagen is not a dominant feature of the extracellular matrix in the brain and is only found around the
cerebrovasculature. Cell culture assays demonstrate that myelin-associated glycoprotein can be cleaved
by MMP2, releasing bioactive fragments that inhibit axonal outgrowth from dorsal root ganglion
neurons [23,24]. Inhibition of VEGF downregulated visfatin-induced MMP2 induction and endothelial
angiogenesis, as evidence for the relationship of these two pro-angiogenic factors [25]. Exercise
increases MMP2 expression in skeletal muscles and the ECM of the muscle [26,27].
With the aforementioned, this study was designed to test the hypothesis that regular exercise
therapy augments regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), thereby improving long-term recovery in a
well-characterized rat model of mild stroke. In order to further clarify the molecular background to this
condition, we evaluated dynamic changes in the key pro-angiogenic factors VEGF and MMP2, and
examined the role of VEGF in regulating the levels of MMP2.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Neurobehavioral Scores
Running conferred sensory-motor deficit scores, there was significant improvement in running
compared with sedentary rats (Figure 1A). Bevacizumab (BEV) significantly weakened the protective
effect of physical activity (Figure 1A). Average blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were not

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2013, 14

8572

different in 16-days running (diastolic BP, 93 ± 14 mm Hg; mean arterial BP, 105 ± 13 mm Hg;
systolic BP, 117 ± 29 mm Hg; HR, 439 ± 48 bpm) compared with sedentary (diastolic BP,
92 ± 11 mm Hg; mean arterial BP, 103 ± 14 mm Hg; systolic BP, 125 ± 35 mm Hg;
HR, 485 ± 57 bpm; p > 0.05; n = 5 per group). Physiological parameters did not differ significantly
between running versus sedentary animals (pH, 7.30 ± 0.05 versus 7.28 ± 0.03; PCO2, 53 ± 2
versus 48 ± 4 mm Hg; PO2, 85 ± 8 versus 89 ± 5 mm Hg in sedentary versus running; p > 0.05; n = 5
per group).

photograph shows a representative cerebral infarct of the brain slices in the sham, running
and sedentary groups at 16 days. The pale region is the infarct brain tissue and the red
region is normal tissue. The infarct volume of five rats in the sham group was zero
(not shown). There was no statistically significant difference between the indicated running
group and sedentary group.

2.2. Infarct Volume
Temporary MCAo/R produced histological damage in the cortex and striatum in the MCAo/R
groups, with no significant difference between the sedentary group (45.6% ± 2.3%) and running group
(43.7% ± 3.8%) after two weeks of treadmill training (Figure 1B).
2.3. Running Enhances MMP2 and VEGF mRNA Levels
The angiogenic potential is greatly enhanced by the degradation of the ECM, where gelatinase
MMP2 and VEGF play a vital role. A more intense expression of the gene for VEGF was indicated in
MCAo/R sedentary group than in sham control as early as five days post-stroke and then declined
thereafter. Enhanced MMP2 mRNA was observed at nine days, later than VEGF. At five days, running
induced a significant increase in mRNA expressions of VEGF, and at nine days, MMP2 mRNA was
also higher in running group than sedentary (Figure 2A,B, p < 0.01).

2.4. Effect of Running on MMP2 and VEGF Protein Expressions and the Effect of BEV
To further quantify and confirm the effect of running on the levels of VEGF and MMP2, protein
expression was assayed by Western blot analysis. Examination of concentrations of VEGF and MMP2
in the running and sedentary groups confirmed the RT-PCR observation (Figure 3A,B, p < 0.01). The
expression of MMP2 reached a peak later than VEGF. We infer that VEGF may have some effect on
the ischemic-induced expression of MMP2 and the running-induced augmentation. BEV treatment
blunted the MMP2 stimulation observed after MCAo/R both in the running and sedentary group
(Figure 4A,B).

nine-day group; 5, sedentary nine-day group; 6, running 16-day group; 7, sedentary 16-day
group; M, marker. The data (n = 5) are the mean ± S.E.M.

2.5. Running Increases rCBF
Absolute rCBF was significantly lower in the ischemic striatum compared with contralateral side in
sedentary rats at three weeks (Figure 5). In runners, the rCBF was significantly higher both in the
ischemic and contralateral striatum compared with sedentary animals, an effect that was significantly
weakened after BEV co-treatment (Figure 5). In sham-operated rats, we detected no significant
CBF alterations (data not shown). In addition, the results also showed that BEV can potentially
cross the BBB in the stroke area, and the CBF was hampered in contralateral hemisphere by
BEV administration.

two weeks of voluntary running or a sedentary life-style or running co-treated with BEV.
At 16 days after MCAo/r, absolute cerebral blood flow (CBF) was determined in the
striatum of contralateral and ischemic hemispheres using the 14C-iodoantipyrine tissue
equilibration technique. Representative pseudocolored autoradiographic images of coronal
brain sections are shown. The data (n = 5) are the mean ± S.E.M.* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01
compared to the sedentary group. No significant CBF changes were detected in sham-operated
animals (n = 5).

2.6. Discussion
It is now appreciated that angiogenesis will stimulate endogenous recovery mechanisms following
brain ischemia, including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and neuronal and synaptic plasticity.
Dysregulated angiogenesis involves the VEGF-MMP system [28]. Although inhibition of endogenous
growth factors seems beneficial in certain ophthalmic conditions, atherosclerotic plaques, tumor and so
on, extending diametrically opposed therapeutic advancements is necessary in inducing angiogenesis
for improving vascular insufficiency [29–31]. Therefore, the study of VEGF-MMP system assumes
crucial importance. In this study, we have linked the beneficial effects of regular physical activity on
VEGF-MMP and absolute rCBF to long-term recovery following brain ischemia.
In the present study, we conducted a well-characterized mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia and
found that brain ischemia upregulated VEGF and MMP2 expression, which is further enhanced by
treadmill training. In addition, we reported that running significantly augmented absolute rCBF in the
ischemic lesion 16 days after stoke. The proangiogenic effects of running are associated with improved
outcome, as evidenced by better sensory-motor deficit scores. There were no apparent changes in any

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2013, 14

8576

physiological parameter that could explain these effects. More importantly, we demonstrated the role
of VEGF signaling in exercise-induced MMP2 upregulation and increased absolute rCBF, a role that
appeared to mediate the protective effects of regular physical activity. As it was revealed that when
animals were co-treated with BEV, the running effects on MMP2 upregulation, rCBF and outcome
were apparently weakened, a finding indicated that increased VEGF bioavailability may stimulate
MMP2 expression. Previous literature demonstrated that when animals were trained only after ischemia,
there was a nonsignificant trend toward smaller lesions [32], and our results confirmed this notion.
The MMPs are increasingly being recognized as having beneficial roles following nervous system
injury. They are involved in endogenous mechanisms of neurogenic migration as the brain seeks to
heal itself after ischemic injury [33,34]. The MMP proteolysis of ECM molecules may perform a
permissive or inductive role in fiber remodeling and synaptogenesis initiated by deafferentation [35].
The MMP-mediated breakdown of the brain blood barrier (BBB), which occurs over the course of
24–48 h, can trigger neuronal apoptosis and synapse loss. After this protracted destructive phase,
further MMP expression can contribute to subsequent reparative processes of cell replacement,
remyelination and reestablishment of connectivity and neurovascular integrity [20,21,36,37]. In this
study, brain ischemia induced a significantly higher expression of MMP2 at nine days post-ischemia, a
little different from some previous studies, which demonstrated that MMP2 activity was maximum at
five days after MCAo around the ischemic core [38–40]. Furthermore, treadmill training significantly
augmented the expression of MMP2 after training for seven days and 14 days, and rCBF was elevated
in the running group 16 days after MCAo/R. However, for the 16-days sedentary rats, this angiogenic
response was apparently abortive. It was speculated that the later expression of MMP2 by
macrophages may aid in their migration into the ischemic lesion and contribute to the clearing of
cellular debris during the later wound-healing/resolution phase after focal stroke [39]. We have shown
the effect of running on the VEGF expression in the ischemic brain tissue besides MMP2. The
proangiogenic effects of running are associated with improved outcome. Collectively, our findings
would tentatively support that the time of appearance of MMP2, as well as its augmentation by
running, may be involved in tissue repair [38] and contribute to the remodeling of the white matter
myelin and microvascular beds in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion [40]. Exercise therapy after cerebral
ischemia stroke increases the expression of MMP2 and VEGF, which play a positive role in
neurological recovery. It is conjectured that, through promoting angiogenesis and nerve regeneration,
both VEGF and MMP2 can increase ischemic brain tissue oxygen supply and promote brain
remodeling, so as to promote the recovery of neural function.
A feature of early vascular remodeling is enhanced production of MMPs, in particular, MMP2 [41–44].
The MMPs are regulated by a number of cytokines and growth factors [45]. Several previous studies
have reported that VEGF can induce reduction of infarct size [46–48], promote ischemia-induced
neurogenesis and stimulate angiogenesis in the ischemic rat brain [49,50]. Lamoreaux suggested that
VEGF may modulate endothelial cell-derived MMP activity by increasing the abundance of MMP2
and disinhibiting MMP2 by decreasing the abundance of an endogenous MMP inhibitor, a tissue
inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) [51]. These actions could contribute to the ability of VEGF
to promote endothelial cell invasion of new territory. In this experiment, the expression of VEGF
increased for peak at five days after cerebral ischemia. Moreover, we provided novel evidence that
running-induced MMP2 expression were significantly reduced when co-treated with BEV, a VEGF

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2013, 14

8577

targeting antibody. This observation was further extended to running-induced higher rCBF and better
functional outcome, both weakened by BEV. In fact, MMP2 activity is increased in several types of
endothelial cells treated with VEGF or exposed to hypoxia [52]. It is therefore likely that an increase in
MMP2 activity is necessary for endothelial cell release from the basement membrane, as well as for
invasion into new territories during angiogenesis. One of the roles of VEGF following its release
would be to modulate the activities of MMP2, which would presumably allow the endothelial cells to
obtain a path by which to migrate, eventually forming a capillary sprout, vessel cord and, finally, a
capillary network. Because of the instructive effects of angiogenesis during neurological recovery after
stroke, the regulation of VEGF and MMP2 activity offers a means of stimulating the angiogenic
response and could therefore be a target of pharmacological activation of angiogenesis. It should be
emphasized that the rCBF, as an indicator for tissue perfusion, reflect both microvessel density and
caliber. The substances that improve vasodilation, for example nitric oxide, can alter the results.
3. Experimental Section
3.1. Animals and Treatment
All experimental procedures that were performed on laboratory animals conformed to the
Guidelines for Animal Experimentation of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of China
Medical University. Ninety adult male Wister rats (250–350 g, clean animals, Animal Department of
China Medical University) were housed with free access to food and water and placed on a 12/12 h
light/dark cycle. Rats were first familiarized with the treadmill and then randomly assigned to ten
groups (Table 1). The treadmill training-treated animals were exercised on a four-lane treadmill
(JX-240 treadmill, Xuzhou Fitness Equipment Company, Xuzhou, China) at 3 days after MCAo/R at a
speed of 12 m/min for 30 min each day. The rats were trained for 3 days, 7 days and 14 days,
respectively, in the 5-days, 9-days and 16-days after MCAo/R running groups. The BEV co-treated
animals received bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech/Roche, San Francisco, CA, USA), 45 mg/kg i.v.,
immediately after reperfusion.

3.2. Cerebral Ischemia and Measurement of Physiological Parameters
The MCAo/R-treated rats were anesthetized with 1 vol% isoflurane in 69% N2O and 30% O2 and
subjected to right MCAo for 2 h followed by reperfusion, as described [9]. The sham-operated rats
underwent the same surgical procedure, except that the polyester thread was advanced into the internal
carotid artery (ICA) for 9 mm. Core temperature was maintained at 36.5 ± 0.5 °C. The neurological
deficits were scored using a modified scoring system based on the system developed by Longa et al. [53]:
0, no deficits; 1, difficulty in fully extending the contralateral forelimb; 2, unable to extend the
contralateral forelimb; 3, mild circling to the contralateral side; 4, severe circling; and 5, falling to the
contralateral side. Three animals died after MCAo/R, and the same number of animals was
supplemented. The rats with a score of 2–4 were included in the experimental group. In five rats from
16-days MCAo/R running group and five from 16-days MCAo/R sedentary, the left femoral artery was
cannulated. Arterial blood samples were analyzed for blood gases, as described [54]. In addition, for
telemetric recording, a telemetry probe (TA11PA-C-20, Data Sciences International, St. Paul, MN,
USA) was inserted and secured in the right common carotid artery, and the transmitter was placed
subcutaneously. After a 10-day recovery period, blood pressure, heart rate and physical activity were
continuously measured for 72 h (all parameters plus waveform files were recorded for 1 min every
10 min). The data were analyzed with the A.R.T.2.1 software (Data Sciences International).
3.3. Neurobehavioral Tests
The tapered/ledged beam tests selected for the study are sensitive for the detection of long-term
impairment in sensory-motor functions [55]. The animals were tested before MCAo and on
post-MCAo/R days 5, 9 and 16 before sacrifice. All behavioral analyses were performed in a blinded
manner. The rats were pre-trained for 3 days to traverse the beam before ischemia induction. The
beam-walking apparatus consisted of a tapered beam with under-hanging ledges on each side to permit
foot faults without falling. The end of the beam was connected to a black box (20.5 × 25 × 25 cm3)
with a platform at the starting point. A bright light was placed above the start point to motivate
the rats to traverse the beam. Each rat’s performance was videotaped and then analyzed by
calculating the slip ratio of the impaired (contralateral to lesion) hind limb: more slips indicated
a greater degree of impairment. Steps onto the ledge were scored as a full slip, and a half slip
was scored if the limb touched the side of the beam. The slip ratio was calculated as follows:
[(number of full slips + 0.5 × number of half slips)/(number of total steps)] × 100%. The mean of three
trials was used for the statistical analysis.
3.4. Measurement of Cerebral Infarction Volume
Five rats from the MCAo/R control group, five from the 16-days running and five from the 16-days
sedentary were euthanized after neurobehavioral tests with chloral hydrate, and the brains were
collected quickly and placed at −20 °C for 30 min. The brain tissue was cut into 5 coronal sections
3 mm thick and stained with a 2% solution of triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) in PBS at a
temperature of 37 °C for 20 min, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde buffer for fixation. The stained
sections were photographed, and the digital images were analyzed using imaging software

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2013, 14

8579

(Adobe Photoshop 7.0) (the pink area was normal brain tissue, and the pale area indicated infarction).
The total infarction volume was calculated as the sum of the area of the brain infarction multiplied by
the thickness of each section (3 mm). The lesion volumes were calculated by the following formula:
{[total infarct volume − (the volume of the intact ipsilateral hemisphere − the volume of the intact
contralateral hemisphere)]/contralateral hemisphere volume} × 100%. This indirect measure corrects
for edema in the total infarct volume.
3.5. Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction
Immediately after the tapered/ledged beam tests, the rats were sacrificed by decapitation, and right
brain tissues between the anterior and posterior fontanel were dissected and frozen. The brain tissues
were equally divided into 2 parts; the anterior parts were used for extracting RNA and the posterior for
Western blot analysis.
The Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was used to determine
the expression of genes encoding MMP2 and VEGF. Total RNA was isolated using a reverse
transcription kit (RNAiso™ PLUS, Takara, Otsu, Japan). We obtained cDNA by reverse transcription,
which was performed using a reverse transcription kit (Takara, Otsu, Japan), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The amplification was performed as follows: for MMP2, VEGF and β-actin,
35 cycles of predenaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 58 °C for
30 s and elongation at 72 °C for 30 s. The PCR primers were as follows: MMP2 (496 bp),
5'-GCAACCACAACCAACTACGAT-3' (forward) and 5'-CATTCCCTGCGAAGAACACA-3'
(reverse); VEGF (147 bp), 5'-GGACATCTTCCAGGAGTACC-3' (forward) and 5'-CGCATGATCTG
CCATAGTGCA-3' (reverse); β-actin (357 bp), 5'-TAAAGACCTCTATGCCAACAC-3' (forward) and
5'-TAAAGCCATGCCTAATGTCTC-3' (reverse). The amplified samples were subjected to
electrophoresis through 2% agarose gels. The fluorescence intensity of each band was scanned and
quantified using NIH-image software. The levels of MMP2 and VEGF were normalized against those
of β-actin mRNA.
3.6. Western Blot Analysis
The total protein of the frozen specimens was extracted by a commercial protein extraction reagent
(Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) at a ratio of 1 g of tissue to 10 mL reagent, according to the product
manual. The supernatants were used as whole-tissue lysates, and protein concentrations were measured
using the BCA protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), according to the instructions provided by
the manufacturer. Equal amounts of protein from brain tissue in the middle cerebral artery-supplied
region were separated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels for 35 min at 200 V and
transferred onto a 0.2 μm PVDF membrane (Thermo Scientific, Hudson, NH, USA) at 70 V for 2 h.
The membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 5% skim milk and washed 3 times with
Tris-buffered saline-Tween buffer for 10 min each time. The membranes were then incubated with the
primary goat anti-MMP-2 and VEGF (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA, 1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. The
membranes were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline-Tween buffer, incubated for 2 h with
rabbit anti-rat HRP (1:5000; Zhongshanjinqiao, Beijing, China) and washed three times with
PBS-Tween. The immunoreactive bands were visualized with the ECL system (Baoxin Biotec,

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2013, 14

8580

Shenyang, China), and a microplate reader was used to measure the optical density at 540 nm and
generate a standard curve. GAPDH was used as a loading control to confirm the equality of total
added protein.
3.7. CBF Measurements
CBF measurements were performed using the 14C-iodoantipyrine technique under etomidate
anesthesia (0.03 mg/kg body weight per minute). Rats were infused with 14C-iodoantipyrine (125 Ci/kg
body weight in 100 μL saline) through the left femoral vein during a 1 min period via a pump at a
progressively increasing rate. During the infusion, arterial blood samples, which were freely flowing
from the catheterized femoral artery, were collected onto preweighed filter paper disks and
subsequently were measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Two minutes later, animals were
decapitated, and the brains were removed and snap-frozen in isopentane on dry ice. Sections of 20 mm
were prepared, thaw-mounted on glass coverslips, immediately dried on a hot plate and exposed to
X-ray films with a set of calibrated 14C-polymer standards. In the coronal brain sections corresponding
to interaural +5.34 mm regions of interest were selected corresponding to somato-sensory cortex, jaw
region. CBF was measured by a computerized image analyzer using an ellipsoid cursor (0.25 ± 2 mm)
(MCID Elite, Imaging Research, St. Catharines, ON, Canada). Tissue-blood partition coefficient was
defined as 0.7. The software converted the optical density to radioactive content and to CBF using the
radioactive standards and the 14C-iodoantipyrine blood curve.
3.8. Statistical Analysis
SPSS software (Version 20.0) was used for all statistical analyses. The data are presented as
mean ± S.E.M. The level of statistical significance was at least p < 0.05 throughout this study.
Comparisons were made by 1- or 2-way ANOVA or repeated-measures ANOVA, followed by
Tukey’s test.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated the effects of running on MMP2 upregulation and VEGF
production in rats’ ischemia brain tissue. Our findings suggested a functional interplay between
running and these proangiogenic molecules and rCBF. The protective effects of regular exercise on
brain function are well recognized. Clearly, physical activity exerts pleiotropic protective effects far
beyond purely vascular mechanisms. Both nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) have been implicated as downstream mediators. This can, at least in part, be explained
by the fact that MMPs facilitates conversion of pro-NGF to NGF and of pro-BDNF to BDNF in the
brain, which potentially alter the capacity of neurons and axons to regenerate after nervous system
injury [56,57], and MMPs were partially regulated by VEGF, as we have shown.
