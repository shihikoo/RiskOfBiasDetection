The most effective way to contain cerebral ischemic injury is reperfusion; however, reperfusion itself may result in tissue injury,
for which inflammatory damage is one of the main causative factors. NALP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex. It consists
of NALP3, ASC, and caspase-1, whose function is to switch on the inflammatory process. Chrysophanol is an extract from plants
of Rheum genus and it possesses many pharmacological effects including its anti-inflammation activity. In this study, the effects
of chrysophanol in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion and the potential mechanisms were investigated. Male CD1 mice were subject
to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). The NALP3 inflammasome activation status and its dynamic expression
during the natural inflammatory response induced by tMCAO were first profiled. The neuroprotective effects of chrysophanol were
then assessed and the potential mechanisms mediating the observed neuroprotection were then explored. Physical parameters
including neurological deficit, infarct size, brain edema, and BBB permeability were measured at 24 h after tMCAO. Confocal
microscopy, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and qRT-PCR techniques were utilized to analyze the expression of NALP3
inflammasome and IL-1𝛽. Our results indicated that the brain tissue damage during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion is accompanied
by NALP3 inflammasome activation. Chrysophanol could inhibit the activation of NALP3 inflammasome and protect cerebral
ischemic stroke.

1. Introduction
Stroke constitutes one of the major causes leading to disability
and death worldwide [1]. Inflammatory response has been
confirmed to play a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury [2]. The relationship between inflammation and cerebral I/R outcome has
assured the considerable and continued interest in the development of anti-inflammation oriented therapies to mitigate
I/R-induced brain damage.
The inflammatory process involves activation and interaction of a broad spectrum of immune factors pioneered
by the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. These
cytokines, including members of the interleukin (IL)-1 family
such as IL-1𝛽, are detected in the infarct area and their

imbalance is associated with brain tissue damage. A previous
study has demonstrated that mice deficient in IL-1𝛽 show
improved survival, reduced the infarct volume, and improved
neurological functions as compared with wild-type mice after
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) [3].
Recent evidence suggested that the downstream processing of IL-1𝛽 is regulated by some cytosolic factors such as
inflammasomes, a family of protein complexes that were
recently identified as the cellular machinery responsible
for recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns and
reacting to these through activation of inflammatory processes [4]. Among different types of inflammasomes is the
NALP3 inflammasome, which has been well characterized
in a variety of mammalian cells. It is characterized as
a proteolytic complex mainly composed of the NACHT

2
domain-, leucine-rich repeat-, and pyrin domain (PYD)containing protein 3 (NALP3), the adaptor protein apoptosisassociated speck-like protein (ASC), and caspase-1 [5]. The
NALP3 inflammasome can be activated by bacterial toxins [6] or pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as
muramyldipeptide, and other stimuli. NALP3 can also detect
and respond to endogenous stress-associated danger signals,
such as ATP [7], ROS [8], monosodium urate crystals [9],
low intracellular potassium concentrations, sodium overload
[10], or 𝛽-amyloid by activating caspase-1, and active caspase1 subsequently matures the proinflammatory IL-1𝛽 family
cytokines by cleaving their proforms into biologically active
cytokines in turn [11, 12]. Active IL-1𝛽 then triggers the IL1𝛽 receptors on surrounding tissues [13, 14], leading to the
activation of multiple cytokines involved in the inflammation
cascade, including IL-8, TNF, and IL-17 [15, 16] (Figure 1).
However, the role of NALP3 inflammasome in cerebral I/R
inflammatory disorders has not been well explored [17, 18].
Chrysophanol (CHR), a member of the anthraquinone
family, was originally extracted from plants of Rheum genus
(Figure 2). CHR has been shown to have multiple pharmacological effects, including its anti-inflammation activity, for
which the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated.
Previous studies have shown that CHR inhibits caspase-1 and
its downstream cytokines expression in colitis [19]. However,
little is known on the relationship between CHR and NALP3
inflammasome during cerebral I/R.
Using mouse transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(tMCAO) model, this study was designed to examine the cellular distribution and dynamic expression of NALP3 inflammasome during cerebral I/R and investigate whether CHR
has any neuroprotective effect and what are the underlying
mechanisms mediating this protection if it does have.

Mediators of Inflammation
middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded by inserting
a heparin-dampened monofilament nylon suture (Beijing
Sunbio Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) into the ICA,
which was moved forward until the flow of right MCA was
reduced to 20%∼30% of basal flow, which was monitored by
a blood flow monitor (moor VMS-LDF, Moor Instruments
Ltd., UK). One hour later, the filament was gently withdrawn
for the reperfusion. Sham-operated mice underwent the same
procedures except inserting a filament. The animals’ body
temperature was also monitored and maintained at 36.5∘ C to
37.5∘ C during experiment [22–24].
2.3. Experimental Groups and Treatments. All animals were
divided into two groups: the control group and the drug
treatment group. For the control group, a total of 63 mice were
randomly divided into 7 subgroups, 9 mice each, including
the Sham controls and untreated controls for six time points
after tMCAO (3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h). For the
treatment group, 162 mice were randomly divided into 6
groups: (1) the Sham group: animals received Sham operation
and equal volume of 0.9% NaCl; (2) tMCAO group: animals
received tMCAO and equal volume of 0.9% NaCl; (3) Vehicle
group: animals underwent tMCAO and equal volume of 1%
DMSO and 1% Tween-80 prepared with 0.9% NaCl; and (4)
three CHR groups: animals underwent tMCAO and were
treated with a high dose of CHR, (10 mg/kg, CHR-H) or
middle dose of CHR (1 mg/kg, CHR-M) and low dose of CHR
(0.1 mg/kg, CHR-L). Mice were reanesthetized and sacrificed
at 24 h after tMCAO. The CHR product (Nanjing Zelang
Medical Technological Co., Ltd., Jiangsu, China) with purity
of more than 98% was first dissolved in 0.9% NaCl including
1% DMSO and 1% Tween-80 prior to the treatments. Drug
or solvent was injected intraperitoneally 30 minutes prior to
tMCAO operation.

2. Methods
2.1. Experimental Animals. Male CD1 mice (25∼30 g) were
purchased from the Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China. All mice were given at least 2
days to acclimatize ahead of any experimentation. During this
period, all mice have free access to food and water. Animal
houses were maintained in a 12/12 h light/dark cycle with
humidity of 60% ± 5% and ambient temperature of 22∘ C ±
3∘ C. The experimental procedures were approved by the local
experimental ethics committee as well as the institutional
animal care and use committee.

2.4. Neurological Deficit Score. The infarct volume, brain edema, and blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability were determined by an examiner blinded to the experimental grouping
at 24 h post-tMCAO for the mice from the drug treatment
group. Meanwhile, a neurological test was administered on
these animals following a scoring system adapted from the
one developed by Longa et al. [20] as follows: 0, no deficits;
1, difficulty in fully extending the contralateral forelimb; 2,
unable to extend the contralateral forelimb; 3, mild circling
to the contralateral side; 4, severe circling; and 5, falling to
the contralateral side.

2.2. Animal Surgery for tMCAO. The mouse tMACO model
was established by following the surgical procedures as previously described [20, 21]. In brief, animals were anesthetized
with chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Loss of
righting reflex was affirmed before performing midline skin
incision. The right common carotid artery (CCA), external
carotid artery (ECA), and internal carotid artery (ICA) were
then exposed through blunt separation. Branches of ECA
were then cauterized and the ECA was ligated and cut off
at the distance of 2 mm from bifurcation of CCA, while

2.5. Brain Infarct Volume. Infarct volume of brain was measured at 24 h after tMCAO. After the brains (𝑛 = 6 in each
group) were dissected, each brain sample was cut into five
slices with 2 mm thickness, incubated by a 2% solution of 2,
3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) at 37∘ C for 15 min,
followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. With TTC
staining, all normal tissue was stained in dark red, while the
infarct area was stained in a pale gray color. All TTC-stained
slices were then photographed and analyzed using Image-Pro
Plus 5.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Bethesda,USA),

Figure 1: Model of danger signals activation of the NALP3 inflammasome. Tissue injury leads to the formation and release of danger signals
such as ATP or uric acid crystals that are recognized by the innate immune system. A number of these signals mediate a potassium efflux
or other secondary intracellular danger signals that are required for NALP3 inflammasome activation [51, 52]. NALP3 inflammasome then
oligomerizes to recruit the adaptor ASC and caspase-1 [53]. Activation of caspase-1 results in the processing and maturation of pro IL-1𝛽
into its biologically active form, active IL-1𝛽 [12, 54]. Active IL-1𝛽 will then trigger the IL-1𝛽 receptor, leading to the activation of multiple
cytokines involved in the inflammation cascade [55].

and the infarct volumes were calculated as follows [25]: percentage hemisphere lesion volume (%HLV) = {[total infarct
volume − (volume of intact ipsilateral hemisphere − volume
of intact contralateral hemisphere)]/contralateral hemisphere
volume} × 100%.
2.6. Brain Water Content. Brain water content was determined using the standard wet-dry method [26]. Mice (𝑛 =
6 in each group) were decapitated under deep anesthesia
at 24 h post-tMCAO, while the cerebrum was removed and
placed on a preprepared dry tray as quickly as possible.
The frontal pole with 2 mm thickness and cerebellum were
removed; only coronal slices with approximately 4 mm in
thickness were left. The slices were divided into ischemic
and nonischemic hemispheres. At the same time, the two
hemisphere slices were packaged, respectively, with tin foil,
and their wet weights were evaluated with electronic balance
and then dried for 24 h at 100∘ C to get dry weights. Brain
water content (BW) was calculated as follows: BW = (wet
weight − dry weight)/wet weight × 100%.
2.7. Evans Blue Extravasation. At 2 h before the mice were
anesthetized, 4 mL/kg of 2% Evans blue (Sigma) prepared
with 0.9% NaCl was administered by tail vein injection.
Then, they were perfused into heart with 0.9% NaCl. For
quantitative measurement of Evans blue extravasation, the
ischemic and nonischemic hemispheres were removed and
homogenized in 1 mL of trichloroacetic acid and then centrifuged at 21,000 g for 20 minutes. Evans blue concentration
was quantitatively determined by measuring the absorbance
of the supernatant at 610 nm using spectrometer (infinite
m200 pro, TECAN, Austria) [27].
2.8. Confocal Microscopy. Representative coronal brain sections of mice were obtained at 24 h after Sham operation or
tMCAO (𝑛 = 3 for each group). Mice were perfused with
0.9% NaCl quickly followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS.
Fixed frozen cerebral sections (30 𝜇m thick) were blocked
with 10% goat serum for 1 h and then incubated overnight
at 4∘ C with primary antibodies from Abcam including antiNALP3 antibody (1 : 100); anti-ASC antibody (1 : 100); anticaspase-1 antibody (1 : 100); and anti-IL-1𝛽 antibody (1 : 100),
together with anti-NeuN (1 : 200, Sternberger Monoclonal
Incorporation, Lutherville, MD, USA). After 3 washes with
PBS, they were incubated with secondary antibodies (1 : 100,
Zhongshan Biology Technology Company, China) at 37∘ C for
2 h. Immunofluorescence was visualized using a Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (Olympus FV10-ASW, Japan).
2.9. Western Blotting. All proteins were obtained from the
cortex of the ischemic hemisphere using a total protein
extraction kit from Applygen Technologies Inc., (Beijing,
China) following the manufacturer’s protocols. The protein
concentrations of the extracts were determined using a BCA
Protein Assay reagent kit (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA),
while 50 𝜇g of proteins (𝑛 = 3 per group per time point)
was separated by SDS/PAGE electrophoresis and transferred
to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5%

Mediators of Inflammation
nonfat milk in 0.01 M PBS at room temperature for 1 h and
then incubated overnight at 4∘ C with the primary antibodies obtained from Abcam, including anti-NALP3 antibody
(1 : 1000), anti-ASC antibody (1 : 1000), anti-caspase-1 antibody (1 : 500), and anti-IL-1𝛽 antibody (1 : 1000). Polyclonal
rabbit anti-beta actin antibody (1 : 500) from Zhongshan
Biotechnology was used for internal control. After three
washes with TPBS, all membranes were incubated with
IRDye 800-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. An imaging
densitometer (LI-COR Bioscience) was used to analyze the
relative density of each band.
2.10. Immunohistochemistry. For immunohistochemical
staining, brain tissues were removed and immediately
immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde with PBS for 24 h at 4∘ C.
Brain sections (5 𝜇m thick) were blocked in 3% H2 O2 , 3%
normal goat serum, and then incubated overnight with antimouse NALP3, ASC and IL-1𝛽 rabbit polyclonal antibodies
(1 : 100, Abcam Biotechnology), and anti-mouse caspase-1
rabbit polyclonal antibody (1 : 100, Sigma Biotechnology). The
secondary antibodies, secondary biotinylated conjugates, and
diaminobenzidine were from the Vect ABC kit (Zhongshan
Biology Technology Company, China). In the end, 20
cross sections were taken from each mouse brain for
immunostaining. The cause is four factors will be observed
altogether with each bearing 5 sections. Meanwhile, five
visual fields of ischemic region from the infarct area were
selected and the immunoreactive cells were counted under a
400x light microscope (𝑛 = 3 per group per time point).
2.11. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRTPCR). Total RNA from ischemic region cortex was isolated
using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and
was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Revert Aid first
Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Fermentas International Inc.,
Burlington, Canada) for Quantitative PCR (MX 3005P, USA)
in the presence of a fluorescent dye (SYBR Green I; Cwbio).
Relative abundance of mRNA from the perspective target
genes was calculated after normalization to 𝛽-actin RNA and
was calculated by the 2−ΔΔCt method. Real-time PCR was
used to analyze the levels of NALP3, ASC, caspase-1, and IL1𝛽 mRNA at 24 h after tMCAO. All primer sequences are
provided in Table 1.
2.12. Statistical Analysis. All data were analyzed using proper
tools from SPSS 13.0 package, while all quantitative data
were expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical comparisons were
conducted using one-way ANOVA followed by SNK and LSD
tests for intergroup comparisons. For neurological deficit,
Mann-Whitney 𝑈 test was applied for comparisons between
groups.

Sections were triple-stained for NALP3, ASC, caspase-1 and IL-1𝛽 (red), NeuN (green), and nucleus (blue). In tMCAO group, the neuronal
karyopyknosis and chromatin margination could be observed and there was a small amount of neutrophils in marginal zone of infarction.
In the normal brain (Sham), caspase-1 and NALP3 were mainly present in the nucleus of neurons whereas IL-1𝛽 was mainly localized in the
cytoplasm. ASC was present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. After tMCAO, NALP3 and caspase-1 were redistributed predominantly to
the cytoplasm, while ASC and IL-1𝛽 location remained unchanged.

the cellular distribution of NALP3 inflammasome components as well as IL-1𝛽 in the ischemic penumbra zone of the
cerebral cortex. The neuronal karyopyknosis and chromatin
margination could be observed and there was a small amount
of neutrophils in the marginal zone of infarction. In the
normal brain (Sham), caspase-1 and NALP3 were mainly
localized in the nucleus of neurons, whereas IL-1𝛽 was mainly
present in the cytoplasm. ASC was present in both the nucleus
and cytoplasm. However, after tMCAO, NALP3 and caspase1 were redistributed predominantly to the cytoplasm, while
ASC and IL-1𝛽 locations remained unchanged (Figure 3).
3.1.1. NALP3, ASC, Caspase-1, and IL-1𝛽 Were Upregulated
during Cerebral I/R. Immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, and
Western blotting were used to examine expression of NALP3,
ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1𝛽 in brain tissue after tMCAO.

The results showed that NALP3 and active caspase-1 were
both upregulated as compared with Sham group (𝑃 < 0.05),
beginning at 12 h and peaking at 24 h (Figures 4(a), 4(b), 4(d),
4(e), and 4(f)). In contrast, active IL-1𝛽 was also shown to
be upregulated but with an earlier onset at 6 h post-tMCAO.
ASC remained unchanged until 72 h after tMCAO (Figures
4(c), 4(d), 4(e), and 4(f)). Therefore, we took the time point
of 24 h after tMCAO to observe the effects of CHR, so as to
demonstrate the protective effects of CHR on acute cerebral
I/R.
3.1.2. CHR Reduced Neurological Deficits. Neurological
deficit was examined and scored on a 6-point scale at
24 h after tMCAO and Mann-Whitney 𝑈 test analysis was
conducted. As depicted in Figure 5(a), mice in Sham group
showed a neurological score as zero while the mice from
the tMCAO and Vehicle groups showed expected higher
neurological deficit scores after the surgery as compared
with Sham group (𝑃 < 0.05). No significant difference was
observed between the animals from tMCAO and Vehicle
groups (𝑃 > 0.05). Remarkably, mice from the CHR-H and
CHR-M groups showed significantly improved neurological
function scores as compared with tMCAO and Vehicle
groups after tMCAO (𝑃 < 0.05). By contrast, there was no
significant effect in CHR-L group compared with tMCAO
and Vehicle groups (𝑃 > 0.05).
3.1.3. CHR Reduced the Infarct Volume. Infarct volume of
each group was measured by TTC at 24 h after tMCAO

(Figure 5(b)). Normal tissue was stained in dark red, while the
infarct area appeared pale gray. No infarction was observed in
Sham group. An extensive lesion was found in both cortex

(𝑃 < 0.05 versus Sham group). Nonetheless, there were no
significant differences between tMCAO and Vehicle groups
(49.87% ± 1.99% versus 51.31% ± 1.57%, 𝑃 > 0.05). The
neuroprotective effects of CHR at different doses were clearly

observed by both TTC staining (Figure 5(b)) and examining
the infarct volume at 24 h (Figure 5(c)). A significant protective effect from CHR was observed as the infarct volumes
from animals in the CHR-H and CHR-M groups but not
the CHR-L group are significantly different from the tMCAO
and Vehicle groups (Figure 5(c)). There was a significant
reduction in infarct volume in CHR-H (29.80% ± 1.15% versus
49.87% ± 1.99% and 51.31% ± 1.57%, 𝑃 < 0.05) and CHR-M

used as index to measure brain edema [26]. The measurements of the brain water content of the normal

and the ischemic hemispheres of all experimental groups
were shown in Figure 5(d). It was demonstrated that there
was no change in brain edema in the Sham group but rather
a significant increase in brain water content in the ischemic

groups (83.75% ± 0.48% versus 83.72% ± 0.35% 𝑃 > 0.05).
Following CHR treatment, as compared with tMCAO and
Vehicle groups, there were significant reductions in brain
water content in the CHR-H group (80.60% ± 0.58% versus
83.75% ± 0.48% and 83.72% ± 0.35%, 𝑃 < 0.05) and the
CHR-M group (82.15% ± 0.68% versus 83.75% ± 0.48% and
83.72% ± 0.35%, 𝑃 < 0.05). Again, no significant difference
was observed between the CHR-L group and the tMCAO
and Vehicle groups (83.88% ± 0.31% versus 83.75% ± 0.48%
and 83.72% ± 0.35%, 𝑃 > 0.05).
3.1.5. The Amelioration of BBB Permeability. To evaluate BBB
permeability at 24 h after tMCAO, BBB leakage was measured
using Evans blue extravasation (Figures 5(e) and 5(f)). The
blue area shows the extravagated Evans blue, indicating BBB
disruption. As expected, an extensive BBB disruption was
found in animals from the tMCAO and Vehicle groups
(𝑃 < 0.05 versus Sham group), whereas no significant
difference was observed between the tMCAO and Vehicle
groups (𝑃 > 0.05) (Figure 5(f)). The protective effects of
CHR with different doses were also observed by examination
of Evans blue content at 24 h and, as compared with the
tMCAO and Vehicle groups, significantly lower Evans blue
extravasation was observed in the CHR-H and CHR-M
groups (𝑃 < 0.05 versus tMCAO and Vehicle) (Figure 5(f)).

In agreement with neurological deficit, infarct volume, and
brain edema measurement, the CHR-L group did not show
a significant difference in comparison with the tMCAO and
Vehicle groups (𝑃 > 0.05).
3.1.6. CHR Suppressed the Expression of NALP3, Caspase1, and IL-1𝛽. To further investigate the impact of CHR on
the endogenous expression of NALP3 inflammasome and
IL-1𝛽 in ischemic hemisphere, the expression of NALP3,
ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1𝛽 was also investigated in situ
by immunohistochemical staining of tissue slices from the
brain tissue slices from all experimental groups. The positively stained cells for the examined proteins were counted
manually and intergroup comparisons were performed. The
immunohistochemical staining of NALP3, ASC, caspase-1,
and IL-1𝛽 of each group at 24 h after operation was shown in
Figure 6. Few cells were expressing NALP3, caspase-1, or IL1𝛽 in the cortex in Sham group indicating a low baseline of
NALP3, caspase-1, and IL-1𝛽 expressions in the nonischemic
cortex. In contrast, tissues from the tMCAO group showed
an augmented expression of all three examined proteins. The
number of cells expressing NALP3, caspase-1, or IL-1𝛽 in the
ischemic cortex of tMCAO mice was significantly increased
as compared with Sham group (𝑃 < 0.05). Similar results
were also obtained from the Vehicle group and no significant

difference was observed between the tMCAO and Vehicle

groups, the number of positive cells for NALP3, caspase1, or IL-1𝛽 was significantly lower than the tMCAO and
Vehicle groups (𝑃 < 0.05) (Figure 7(e)). Then we further
analyzed the protein expression of NALP3, ASC (Figure 7(a)),
caspase-1 (Figure 7(b)), and IL-1𝛽 (Figure 7(c)) with Western
blotting. It was found that the expressions of NALP3, caspase1, and IL-1𝛽 at protein level were upregulated in tMCAO

and Vehicle groups compared with Sham group (𝑃 < 0.05).
High dose and middle dose CHR significantly decreased the
NALP3, caspase-1, and IL-1𝛽 protein expression compared
with tMCAO and Vehicle groups (𝑃 < 0.05) (Figure 7(d)).
In agreement with the results of immunohistochemistry and
Western blotting, the mRNA expression of NALP3, caspase1, and IL-1𝛽 was upregulated in tMCAO and Vehicle groups
compared with Sham group (𝑃 < 0.05). The overexpression of those factors was significantly decreased in CHR-H

and CHR-M groups compared with tMCAO and Vehicle

4. Discussion
Although several treatments have been claimed to promote
neuronal survival, reduce infarct volumes, and improve
behavioral responses after experimental cerebral ischemia,
the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is the
only FDA-approved drug for treatment of ischemic stroke
clinically [28–30]. However, rtPA has a narrow window of
efficacy of 3 h after the onset of stroke, which limits the use
of this medicine only to a small portion of stroke patients.
Since reperfusion after prolonged ischemia exaggerates tissue
injury, in which inflammatory damage plays a critical role,
anti-inflammatory oriented treatments may have the potential to mitigate the I/R-induced, inflammation-mediated
secondary damage and improve the treatment outcome in
stroke patients [31–35]. In this study, we have investigated
the role of the NALP3 inflammasome in the inflammatory
response induced by I/R using mouse tMCAO model, the
most matured animal model that mimics human stroke [21].
Meanwhile, we examined the anti-inflammation and neuroprotective effects of CHR, a member of the anthraquinone
family [36], in the mice who underwent tMCAO.
Previous pharmaceutical studies have shown that derivatives of anthraquinones exert multiple biological effects,
including anticancer [37, 38], hepatoprotection [39], and
antimicrobials [40]. A number of studies have also implied
that extracts [41–43] containing CHR have a wide range
of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammation,
antidyslipidemia, and antioxidant activities. It has been
proved that CHR inhibits the nitric oxide production and
activation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-𝛼, interleukin (IL)-6, NF-𝜅B, and
caspase-1 in vivo and vitro [41]. Our results further confirmed
the association between NALP3 inflammasome and the I/R
induced brain damage. Furthermore, we firstly demonstrated
that CHR could significantly suppress the inflammatory
response after ischemic stroke, which is consistent with the
previous studies reporting the effects of CHR on dextran
sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in mouse peritoneal
macrophages [19].
NALP3 inflammasome is pivotal in the processing of
active caspase-1 and downstream maturation of IL-1𝛽 [11]. IL1𝛽 can then promote the increase of endothelial permeability
and the expression of a number of adhesion molecules
[32, 44]. These effects further result in the recruitment of
inflammatory cells into the brain parenchyma, amplifying the
inflammatory reaction within the ischemic brain. Our work
focused on NALP3 since it is “apical” in the inflammation
cascade and potentially an ideal target for anti-inflammation
oriented therapies. A previous study has confirmed that
NALP3 signaling is involved in liver I/R and silencing NALP3
can protect the liver from I/R injury [45]. The same results
were observed during inflammation and immune responses
in renal I/R as well [46]. Furthermore, NALP3 expression was

Mediators of Inflammation
elevated in the spinal cords during experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE), and NALP3 (−/−) mice had a
dramatically delayed course and reduced severity of disease
[47].
In our study, we detected NALP3 inflammasome in both
normal and ischemic brain tissues while the expression
of NALP3 inflammasome was activated after cerebral I/R.
We observed that NALP3, caspase-1, and IL-1𝛽 were all
upregulated starting at an early stage after tMCAO and
could remain at a high level for at least 72 h. For ASC, the
adapter protein in the NALP3 inflammasome, its activation
was relatively lagging behind and its expression would not be
upregulated significantly until 72 h post-tMCAO. This somewhat unexpected discovery coincides with that of Abulafia
et al. [48], Lindauer et al. [49], and Bostanci et al. [50], however,the causes need to be further researched. Furthermore,
we demonstrated that systemic administration of CHR was
effective in containing neurological impairment and tissue
injury during cerebral I/R in a dose-dependent manner. We
have shown that the neurological deficits, infarct volume,
brain edema, and BBB disruption could all be significantly
improved while the upregulation of NALP3, caspase-1, and
IL-1𝛽 was significantly suppressed. All these are suggestive that the neuroprotective effect of CHR might involve
inhibition of NALP3 inflammasome activation. Although
it is still premature to conclude that inhibition of NALP3
inflammasome is the sole or foremost mechanism mediating
the observed protective effects of CHR, our findings support
the therapeutic effect of CHR in the acute phase of ischemic
stroke.
