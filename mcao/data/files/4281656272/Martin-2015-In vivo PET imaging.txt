PET imaging of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) could become an effective tool for the diagnosis and therapy evaluation of
neurologic diseases. Despite this, the role of nAChRs ␣4␤2 receptors after brain diseases such as cerebral ischemia and its involvement
in inflammatory reaction is still largely unknown. To investigate this, we performed in parallel in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
and positron emission tomography (PET) with 2[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380 and [ 11C]PK11195 at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 d after middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. In the ischemic territory, PET with 2[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380 and [ 11C]PK11195 showed a progressive
binding increase from days 3–7, followed by a progressive decrease from days 14 –28 after cerebral ischemia onset. Ex vivo immunohistochemistry for the nicotinic ␣4␤2 receptor and the mitochondrial translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) confirmed the PET findings and
demonstrated the overexpression of ␣4␤2 receptors in both microglia/macrophages and astrocytes from days 7–28 after experimental
ischemic stroke. Likewise, the role played by ␣4␤2 receptors on neuroinflammation was supported by the increase of [ 11C]PK11195
binding in ischemic rats treated with the ␣4␤2 antagonist dihydro-␤-erythroidine hydrobromide (DHBE) at day 7 after MCAO. Finally,
both functional and behavioral testing showed major impaired outcome at day 1 after ischemia onset, followed by a recovery of the
sensorimotor function and dexterity from days 21–28 after experimental stroke. Together, these results suggest that the nicotinic ␣4␤2
receptor could have a key role in the inflammatory reaction underlying cerebral ischemia in rats.

Introduction
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ion-gated channels composed of five subunits (␣2–␣10 and ␤2–␤4) that are
widely expressed in the skeletal neuromuscular junction and
throughout both the peripheral nervous system and the CNS
(Hogg et al., 2003). The most abundant subtypes of nAChRs in
mammalian brain are heteromeric receptors containing ␣4 and
␤2 subunits and homomeric ␣7 (Mukhin et al., 2000). The nicotinic acetylcholine system plays a crucial role in the mediation of
memory learning, drug addiction, and control of pain (Gotti et
al., 1997). Furthermore, nAChRs play important roles in neuroReceived Sept. 3, 2014; revised March 9, 2015; accepted March 10, 2015.

degenerative diseases (O’Neill et al., 2002). Postmortem brains
from patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Burghaus et al.,
2000) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Guan et al., 2002) showed a
decrease of the density of nAChRs. Likewise, the stimulation of
nAChRs protects neurons from insults associated with neurodegenerative disorders (Mudo et al., 2007), ischemic damage (Shimohama et al., 1998), and intracerebral hemorrhage (Hijioka
et al., 2011). This physiological mechanism responds to the cholinergic modulation of macrophage/microglia activation by
nAChRs receptors and its activation has been ultimately related
to the suppression of the inflammation (Wang et al., 2003, Shytle
et al., 2004, Nizri et al., 2008). Therefore, the in vivo imaging of
nAChRs with PET might be crucial to further understanding
the role of these receptors on inflammation underlying brain
diseases (Kimes et al., 2003). Such promising PET radiotracers as
the 2- 18F-fluoro-3-[2(S)-2-azetidinylmethoxy]pyridine (2[ 18F]fluoro-A85380) have appeared for the study of central nAChR
(Bottlaender et al., 2003, Kimes et al., 2003, Ding et al., 2004,
Zanotti-Fregonara et al., 2012). 2[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380 is a radioligand with high affinity to the ␣4␤2 receptor that has shown a
binding decrease in human brain sections of AD (Schmaljohann
et al., 2004) and PD (Schmaljohann et al., 2006). Therefore, PET

2[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380 has been suggested as a promising radiotracer with which to evaluate the loss of nicotinic neurons in
neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, although nAChRs are
also expressed in microglia (Furukawa et al., 2013), the use of
2[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380 to image brain inflammation has been little explored to date. The purpose of the present study was to
investigate changes in the levels of ␣4␤2 nAChRs in the rat brain
after cerebral ischemia using PET with 2[18F]-fluoro-A85380 and
immnuhistochemistry. In particular, we were interested in clarifying the relationship of the nAChRs expression with the activation of glial cells after cerebral ischemia in rats. Ischemic rats were
subjected to PET studies with [ 11C]PK11195, a specific radioligand for the translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO), to image
brain inflammation (Rojas et al., 2007). Likewise, [ 11C]PK11195
binding was used to evaluate the effect of a selective antagonist for
␣4␤2 receptors [dihydro-␤-erythroidine hydrobromide (DH␤E)]
on the neuroinflammatory reaction after ischemic stroke in rats. The
results reported here may have a significant practical importance
because they can provide novel information about the role of
nAChRs on the inflammatory reaction after cerebral ischemia and
might ultimately contribute to a better design of anti-inflammatory
strategies for the treatment of ischemic stroke.

Materials and Methods
Cerebral ischemia and treatment. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (300 g
body weight; Janvier) (n ⫽ 35) were used. Animal studies were approved
by the animal ethics committee of Center for Cooperative Research in
Biomaterials CIC biomaGUNE and local authorities and were conducted
in accordance with the Directives of the European Union on animal
ethics and welfare. Transient focal ischemia was produced by a 2 h intraluminal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) followed by
reperfusion as described previously (Justicia et al., 2001). Briefly, rats
were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in 100% O2 and a 2.6 cm length of
4-0 monofilament nylon suture was introduced into the right external
carotid artery up to the level where the MCA branches out. Animals were
sutured and placed in their cages with free access to water and food. After
2 h, the animals were reanesthetized and the filament was removed to
allow reperfusion. Six rats were repeatedly examined before (day 0) and
at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 d after ischemia to evaluate the temporal PET
binding of both ␣4␤2 and TSPO. The animals studied at day 0 were
considered the baseline control group.
A group of six rats were inoculated daily for a total of 7 d from 1 h afater
MCAO with 0.5 ml of DH␤E (3 mg/kg, i.p.). A control ischemic group of
eight rats received daily the same volume of vehicle (normal saline). At
day 7, treated and control rats were imaged with PET to determine the
effect of DH␤E on the TSPO expression. Finally, a total of 15 rats were
used to perform ex vivo studies (immnuhistochemistry) at 0, 7, and 28 d
after cerebral ischemia. Therefore, MCAO was induced to 30 rats.
MRI. T2-weighting (T2W) MRI scans were performed in ischemic
animals at 24 h after reperfusion to select the rats (n ⫽ 6) presenting
corticostriatal lesions to be included in the PET studies. Before the scans,
anesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane and maintained by 2–2.5% of
isofluorane in 100% O2 during the scan. Animals were placed into a rat
holder compatible with MRI acquisition systems and maintained normothermic using a water-based heating blanket at 37°C. Measurements
were performed using an 11.7 T Bruker Biospec system with a 72 mm
volumetric quadrature coil for excitation and a 20 mm surface coil for
reception. Acquisition parameters for the T2-weighted spin echo images
were as follows: TR/TE ⫽ 3300/30 ms, FOV ⫽ 1.8 ⫻ 1.8 cm 2, matrix ⫽
200 ⫻ 200, number of excitations ⫽ 3, slice thickness ⫽ 0.8 mm. Contiguous slices covering all the infarcted volume were acquired and fat
suppression was used.
MRI analysis. MRI (T2W) images were used to calculate the lesion
volume. ROIs were defined manually using open source 3D Slicer image
analysis software (version 3.6.3; www.slicer.org) for each rat on the region of increased signal in the ipsilateral hemisphere. The total lesion

J. Neurosci., April 15, 2015 • 35(15):5998 – 6009 • 5999

volume was calculated by summing the area of the infarcted regions of all
slices affected by the lesion.
Radiochemistry. For the production of [ 11C]PK11195, [ 11C]CH4 was
directly generated in an IBA Cyclone 18/9 cyclotron and transferred to a
TRACERlab FXC Pro synthesis module (GE Healthcare), where
[ 11C]CH3I was generated. At the end of the process, [ 11C]CH3I was
distilled under continuous helium flow (20 ml/min) and introduced in a
2 ml stainless steel reaction loop, precharged with a solution of
N-methyl-2-(2-amino-4-cyanophenylthio)-benzylamine (MASB, 1 mg;
ABX) in dimethylsulfoxide (80 ␮l). The reaction mixture was purified
with HPLC. The collected fraction was reformulated by dilution with
water (20 ml), retention on a C-18 cartridge (Sep-Pak Light; Waters) and
elution with ethanol (1 ml) and saline (9 ml). Filtration through a 0.22
␮m sterile filter yielded the final solution. Typical radiochemical yields
and specific activities were 33 ⫾ 5% (end of bombardment) and 135 ⫾ 18
GBq/␮mol (end of synthesis), respectively. Radiochemical purity was
⬎98% in all cases.
2-[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380 was produced using a TRACERlab FXFN synthesis module (GE Healthcare). Briefly, the [ 18F]F ⫺ was trapped in a
preconditioned QMA cartridge and transferred to the reactor by sequential elution with a solution of K2CO3 (3.5 mg) in water (0.5 ml) and a
solution of Kryptofix K2.2.2 (15 mg) in acetonitrile (1 ml). After evaporation to dryness, a solution containing 3 mg of nitro-AP (ABX) in 1 ml
of dry acetonitrile was added. The reaction was performed at 85°C for 15
min. The reactor was then cooled at room temperature and dichloromethane (0.5 ml), trifluoroacetic acid (0.5 ml), and purified water (2.5
ml) were sequentially added. After stirring for 15 s, the mixture was
injected into a semipreparative HPLC system. A mixture of 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid in water/methanol/acetonitrile (85/4/11) was used as mobile phase and a Nucleosil 100 –7 250 mm column (Macherey Nagel) was
used as a stationary phase. The collected fraction was formulated by
dilution with sodium hydroxide aqueous solution (30 ml of water ⫹ 2 ml
of 0.5 M NaOH), retention on a C-18 cartridge (Sep-Pak Plus; Waters)
and elution with ethanol (2 ml) and phosphate buffer solution. Filtration
through 0.22 ␮m sterile filters yielded the final 2-[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380
solution. Average radiochemical yield was 7.8 ⫾ 1.2% (end of synthesis)
and the radiochemical purity was ⬎ 98% in all cases. The specific activity
of 2-[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380 was 150 ⫾ 30 GBq/␮mol and the mass dose
was 0.0665 ⫾ 0.011 ␮g.
PET scans and data acquisition. PET scans were repeatedly performed
before (day 0) and at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 d after reperfusion using a
General Electric eXplore Vista CT camera. Scans were performed in rats
anesthetized with 4% isofluorane and maintained by 2–2.5% of isofluorane in 100% O2.The tail vein was catheterized with a 24-gauge catheter
for intravenous administration of the radiotracer. Animals were placed
into a rat holder compatible with PET acquisition system and maintained
normothermic using a water-based heating blanket. Animals were subjected to two PET scans to assess TSPO binding ([ 11C]PK11195) and
␣4␤2 receptor binding (2-[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380) at every time point before and after ischemia onset. First, ⬃30 MBq of [ 11C]PK11195 were
injected concomitantly with the start of the PET acquisition. Brain dynamic images were acquired (34 frames: 6 ⫻ 5, 6 ⫻ 15, 6 ⫻ 60, 8 ⫻ 120,
and 8 ⫻ 300 s) in the 400 –700 keV energetic window, with a total acquisition time of 64 min, providing a 175 ⫻ 175 matrix with a pixel size of
0.887 mm and 61 slices. Second, after at least 180 min (⬃9 half-lives of
11
C), animals were reanesthetized and placed on the PET camera and
⬃30 MBq of 2-[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380 was injected concomitantly with the
start of the PET acquisition. The acquisition protocol was the same as for
[ 11C]PK11195. After each PET scan, CT acquisitions were also performed (140 ␮A intensity, 40 kV voltage), providing anatomical information of each animal as well as the attenuation map for the later image
reconstruction. Dynamic acquisitions were reconstructed (decay and
CT-based attenuation corrected) with filtered back projection using a
Ramp filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.5 mm ⫺1.
PET image analysis. PET images were analyzed using PMOD image
analysis software version 3.506 (PMOD Technologies). To verify the
anatomical location of the signal, PET images were coregistered to the
anatomical data of a MRI rat brain template. Two types of volumes of
interest (VOIs) were established as follows. A first set of VOIs was defined

Martín et al. • Imaging of Nicotinic Receptor after Stroke

6000 • J. Neurosci., April 15, 2015 • 35(15):5998 – 6009

to study the whole brain [ 11C]PK11195 and 2-[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380
binding potential nondisplaceable (PBND). Whole-brain VOIs were
manually drawn in both the entire ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres containing the territory irrigated by the middle cerebral artery on
slices of a MRI (T2W) rat brain template from the PMOD software. A
second set of VOIs was automatically generated in cortex, striatum, and
thalamus using the regions proposed by the PMOD rat brain template to
study the evolution of BPND of the radiotracers to the specific regions in
both ipsilateral and contralateral cerebral hemispheres. The simplified
reference tissue model (Lammertsma and Hume, 1996) from the PMOD
software was used to assess BPND. This model relies on a two-tissue
reversible compartment for a reference region (cerebellum).
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed at day 0 (control) and days 7 and 28 after reperfusion. Animals
were terminally anesthetized and killed by decapitation. The brain was
removed, frozen, and cut in 5-␮m-thick sections in a cryostat. Sections
were fixed in acetone (⫺20°C) for 2 minutes, washed with PBS, saturated
with a solution of 5% BSA/0.5% Tween in PBS for 15 minutes at room
temperature, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary
antibodies BSA (5%)/Tween (0.5%) in PBS. The first set of sections were
stained for ␣4␤2 with rabbit anti-rat ␣4␤2 (1:500; Abcam), for CD11b
with mouse anti-rat CD11b (1:300; Serotec), and for the glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP) with chicken anti-rat GFAP (1:500; Abcam). The
second set of sections was stained for TSPO with a rabbit anti-rat TSPO
(NP155, 1:1000), for CD11b, and for GFAP. Sections were washed (3 ⫻
10 minutes) in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with
secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 350 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor
594 goat anti-mouse IgG, and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-chicken IgG
(Invitrogen, 1:1000) in 5% BSA/0.5% Tween in PBS, washed again (3 ⫻
10 minutes) in PBS, and mounted with a prolong antifade kit in slices
(Invitrogen, Madrid). Standardized images acquisition was performed
with an Axio Observer Z1 (Zeiss) equipped with a motorized stage.
Cell counts and immunoreactivity quantification. The number of ␣4␤2/
CD11b and ␣4␤2/GFAP-immunopositive cells and microglial/astrocytic
immunoreactivity for ␣4␤2 receptors within the ischemic area was assessed at 0, 7, and 28 d after ischemia. Cells were counted in 10 different
fields at 40⫻ magnification. Representative images of areas showing the
highest staining density were acquired and cells were counted manually.
Immunoreactivity was analyzed using ImageJ version 1.48 software. Microglial/␣4␤2 receptor immunoreactivity was calculated using the mean
intensity value of ␣4␤2 receptor-immunostained pixels in the CD11b
staining-positive area. For that, the CD11b-staining-positive ROIs were
defined by thresholding and converting into a binary mask (Jo et al.,
2014). Then, the CD11b-positive ROIs were analyzed for ␣4␤2 receptor
intensity and the mean intensity value of pixels was used to define microglial/␣4␤2 immunoreactivity. Data represent the mean value of 150
ROIs obtained from four animals, two slides per animal, and five different fields per slide. The mean intensity value of astrocytic ␣4␤2-positive
pixels was measured similarly in GFAP-positive areas.
Neurological and behavioral testing. Two main neurological tests were
used to assess neurological and behavioral deficits after cerebral ischemia
in rats. The assessment of neurological outcome induced by cerebral
ischemia was based on a previously reported 9-neuroscore test (Menzies
et al., 1992). Four consecutive tests were performed on every ischemic
animal before (day 0) and at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 d after MCAO as
follows: (1) spontaneous activity (moving and exploring ⫽ 0, moving
without exploring ⫽ 1, no moving ⫽ 2); (2) left drifting during displacement (none ⫽ 0, drifting only when elevated by the tail and pushed or
pulled ⫽ 1, spontaneous drifting ⫽ 2, circling without displacement or
spinning ⫽ 3); (3) parachute reflex (symmetrical ⫽ 0, asymmetrical ⫽ 1,
contralateral forelimb retracted ⫽ 2); and (4) resistance to left forepaw
stretching (stretching not allowed ⫽ 0, stretching allowed after some
attempts ⫽ 1, no resistance ⫽ 2). Total score could range from 0 (normal) to a 9 (highest handicap) point-scale.
The adhesion/removal tape test was performed as described previously
(Bouet et al., 2009) to evaluate the deficits and behavioral recovery on
every ischemic animal before (day 0) and at 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 d after
MCAO. In brief, it consists of applying adhesive tape on each forepaw of
the animal and measuring the time to contact (the time until contact with

the mouth) and the time to remove them up to a maximum of 2 minutes.
Animals were trained in this task 7 d before ischemia. This behavior
implies correct paw and mouth sensitivity (time to contact) and correct
dexterity (time to remove).
Statistical analyses. For PET binding values, the statistical analysis was
performed as follows: BPND values for each animal, brain region (whole
brain, cortex, striatum and thalamus), and brain hemisphere (ipsilateral
and contralateral) were calculated at each time point. Binding values
within each region, time point, and hemisphere were averaged and compared with the averaged baseline control values (before MCAO) using
one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple-comparison tests for
post hoc analysis. Likewise, cellular expression and immunoreactivity of
both microglial/␣4␤2 and astrocytic/␣4␤2 receptors at days 7 and 28
after ischemia were compared with control values (day 0) using the same
statistical analysis as for PET imaging. The effect of DH␤E in ischemic
rats was compared with control infarcted rats using an unpaired t test.
Neurological outcome comparisons were performed as follows: animals
were subjected to the 9-neuroscore test before MCAO and at 1, 3, 7, 14,
21, and 28 d after cerebral ischemia. The results within each time point
were averaged and compared with baseline average values using Mann–
Whitney U tests. Behavioral outcome comparisons by forepaw (ipsilateral and contralateral) were then performed. Animals were subjected to
the adhesion/removal tape test before MCAO and at different time points
after cerebral ischemia. The results within each time point and forepaw
(ipsilateral and contralateral) were averaged and compared with baseline
values using Mann–Whitney U tests. To assess the differences between
forepaws (ipsilateral vs contralateral), behavioral outcome averaged values at each time point and forepaw were compared using two-way
ANOVA. The level of significance was regularly set at p ⬍ 0.05. Statistical
analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism version 4.02 software.

Results
The levels and distribution of nicotinic ␣4␤2 and TSPO receptors
were explored by PET imaging after a 2 h MCAO and 1–28 d reperfusion in rats. All images were quantified in standard units; that is,
BPND for both 2-[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380 and [ 11C]PK11195. The images with normalized color scale illustrate the evolution of the PET
signals at control and at 1, 7, 14, and 28 d after reperfusion (Fig. 1).
The extent of brain damage after cerebral ischemia was assessed using T2W MRI at 1 d after ischemia onset. Hyperintensities of T2W
images showed similar infarct extents as well as locations affected. All
ischemic rats subjected to nuclear studies showed cortical and striatal MRI alterations (mean ⫾ SD ⫽ 306.16 ⫾ 37.78 mm 3, n ⫽ 6).
2-[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380 PET after cerebral ischemia
The time course of nicotinic receptor ␣4␤2 was evaluated using
2-[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380 in both the ipsilateral and contralateral
cerebral cortex, striatum, thalamus, and whole brain at day 0
(control) and 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 d after MCAO (Fig. 2, n ⫽ 6).
All studied regions showed a similar 2-[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380binding evolution after long-term focal cerebral ischemia. In the
ipsilateral whole brain (cerebrum), the binding values for
2-[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380 presented a slight nonsignificant decrease
at day 1, followed by a progressive PET signal increase later on. In
fact, the highest binding value was reached at 7 d after reperfusion
compared with day 0 (control) values (F(6,41) ⫽ 3.42, p ⬍ 0.05;
Fig. 2A). Subsequently, the PET signal showed a progressive decrease from days 14 –28 compared with day 7. In the contralateral
whole brain, 2-[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380 PET binding reached
pseudocontrol values during the first 3 d, followed by a nonstatistically mild increase at day 7 compared with control values. This
was followed by a progressive decline on days 14 –28 after cerebral ischemia (Fig. 2B). The cerebral cortex in the ipsilateral
hemisphere showed a statistically increase of 2-[ 18F]-fluoroA85380 PET signal at day 7 in relation to control, followed by a

progressive decrease from day 14 on (F(6,41) ⫽ 4.30, p ⬍ 0.05; Fig.
2C). In contrast, nonstatistically significant differences were observed in the contralateral hemisphere despite the weak increase
of PET signal observed from day 7 to day 14 after reperfusion
(Fig. 2D). In the ipsilateral (occluded MCA) striatum, PETbinding levels found from day 7 to day 21 after reperfusion were
higher than those observed in the cerebral cortex, showing an
increase of nicotinic receptor expression under this neuropathologic situation (F(6,41) ⫽ 12.54, p ⬍ 0.01; p ⬍ 0.05 with respect to
control animals; Fig. 2E). In addition, contralateral striatum exhibited lower 2-[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380 PET-binding levels than
that observed in the cerebral cortex and thalamus, showing a
lower density of nicotinic ␣4␤2 receptors in the nonischemic
striatum in relation to other brain regions (Fig. 2F ). Likewise,
thalamus at day 0 (control) showed the highest 2-[ 18F]-fluoro-

A85380-binding potential values (Fig. 2G,H ) compared with
other rat brain regions evaluated at the same time point (F(6,41) ⫽
2.30, p ⬍ 0.001; p ⬍ 0.01 with respect to striatum and cortex, data
not shown). These findings are consistent with the following rank
order: thalamus ⬎ cortex ⬎ striatum of the nicotinic ␣4␤2 receptors distribution in rodent brain (Nirogi et al., 2012). Moreover, the nicotinic PET values increased in both ipsilateral
(F(6,41) ⫽ 2.30, p ⬍ 0.05, with respect to day 0; Fig. 2G) and
contralateral (F(6,41) ⫽ 1.74, p ⬍ 0.05, with respect to day 0; Fig.
2H ) thalamus after reperfusion, which is consistent with the
other cerebral regions evaluated in the present study.

striatum, thalamus, and whole brain at day 0 (control) and 1, 3, 7,
14, 21, and 28 d after MCAO (Fig. 3, n ⫽ 6). All studied regions
exhibited a similar [ 11C]PK11195-binding evolution after longterm focal cerebral ischemia. The intact or noninflamed cerebral
tissue shows a very low TSPO receptor expression, followed by a
dramatic upregulation due to the inflammatory reaction, suggesting its usefulness in imaging neuroinflammatory processes
(Chen and Guilarte, 2008). This fact has been supported by the
very low [ 11C]PK11195-binding level observed at control and at
day 1 after cerebral ischemia. Likewise, all studied brain regions
have exhibited a similar TSPO overexpression after cerebral ischemia (Fig. 3). The ischemic whole-brain hemisphere presented a
dramatic increase of PET [ 11C]PK11195 values at day 3, followed
by the highest increase at day 7 and a subsequently progressive
decrease from days 14 –28 after MCAO (F(6,41) ⫽ 20.07, p ⬍ 0.05;
p ⬍ 0.01with respect to the control animals; Fig. 3A). In the
contralateral hemisphere, the PET signal showed a nonstatistically significant increase the first and second week after reperfusion (Fig. 3B). Cerebral cortex showed a very similar binding
uptake as that observed in the whole brain over the following
month after cerebral ischemia (F(6,41) ⫽ 15.40, p ⬍ 0.05; p ⬍
0.01with respect to the control animals; Figs. 3C,D). In the ipsilateral striatum, BPND increased sharply from day 0 –3, peaking at
day 7 and followed by a progressive decrease from day 14 –28 after
stroke (F(6,41) ⫽ 24.86, p ⬍ 0.05; p ⬍ 0.01 vs control values; Fig.
3E). Likewise, striatum experienced the highest [ 11C]PK11195binding uptake with respect to the other cerebral regions evaluated, showing a greater increase of TSPO expression in this region
after MCAO in rats. The nonischemic striatum showed a weak
nonstatistically significant increase from days 7–14 compared
with values at day 0 (Fig. 3F ). Thalamic regions also suffered an
increase of inflammatory reaction underlying cerebral ischemia.
The ipsilateral thalamic region showed a significant increase of
the PET signal in the ipsilateral thalamus at days 7, 14, and 21 in
relation to the control animals (F(6,41) ⫽ 7.40, p ⬍ 0.01, p ⬍ 0.05;
Fig. 3G). Despite this, a lower increase of the PET [ 11C]PK11195
signal was observed in the ipsilateral thalamus in relation to areas
irrigated by the middle cerebral artery, such as as cortex and
striatum. Likewise, PET with [ 11C]PK11195 displayed a nonsignificant increase of the inflammatory process in the contralateral
thalamus at days 7 and 14 after ischemia (Fig. 3H ).
Expression of ␣4␤2 and TSPO after ischemia
Immunofluorescence staining exhibited ␣4␤2 and TSPO expression in two glial subpopulations, microglia and astrocytes after
ischemia (Fig. 4, n ⫽ 3 (1 rat per time point considered)). At day
7, cells with the morphology of amoeboid-reactive microglia/
macrophages showed intense CD11b immunoreactivity in the
lesion (Fig. 4 B, H, green), followed by a decrease at day 28 (Fig.
4C,I, green). The overreactivity of microglia colocalized with the
cellular expression of both nicotinic ␣4␤2 (Fig. 4 B, C, blue and
green) and TSPO (Fig. 4 H, I, red and green) at days 7 and 28 after
ischemia. Likewise, astrocytes displayed an increase of the GFAP

(Pappata et al., 2000, Gerhard et al., 2005,
Price et al., 2006) after cerebral ischemia.
In addition, [ 11C]PK11195 has been used
extensively to study such neurodegenerative diseases as multiple sclerosis (Banati
et al., 2000), AD (Cagnin et al., 2001), and
PD (Bartels and Leenders, 2007). Recently, an impressive number of selective
radioligands for TSPO have been generated (Damont et al., 2013), limiting research on neuroinflammation by PET
imaging almost exclusively to the study of
this receptor. Therefore, the identification
of new upregulated receptors in reactive
glial cells as nAChRs is of great interest to
the in vivo imaging research on neuroinflammation. Because of this, we have assessed in parallel the in vivo expression of
both nAChRs (␣4␤2) and TSPO in
reactive glial cells using PET-imaging
procedures in combination with immunochemistry and neurofunctional evaluation after long-term transient MCAO in
rats.

quence of the ischemic process (Fig. 2). This decrease was followed by a parallel increase of 2[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380 and
[ 11C]PK11195 binding from day 3 in the different brain regions
considered, which peaked at day 7 in the ipsilateral hemisphere
and showed a progressive decline to pseudocontrol values from
day 14 to day 28 after ischemia onset (Fig. 2; 3). These results are
in agreement with Martín et al. (2010), who showed, after monitoring the in vivo postischemic TSPO receptor expression by
PET, a gradual increase of TSPO receptor availability from days
4 –7, which peaked at day 11 and was followed by a slight decline
afterward. In our study, the same ROIs used to calculate the PET
signal in the ipsilateral hemisphere were used to study PET binding in the nonischemic side. PET binding for both radiotracers in
the contralateral hemisphere showed a nonsignificant increase
over the following week after MCAO onset. A similar increase of
TSPO expression has been observed at day 11 after cerebral ischemia with [ 18F]DPA-714-PET in rats (Martín et al., 2010).
Therefore, in vivo PET imaging has showed a large concordance
between [ 11C]PK11195 and 2[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380 binding uptake profiles, showing an overexpression of ␣4␤2 receptors in the
inflammatory brain regions after long-term cerebral ischemia in
rats. (Figs. 1, 2, 3).
To confirm these findings, both ␣4␤2 and TSPO expression
were characterized by ex vivo immunohistochemistry at days 1, 7,
and 28 after reperfusion (Fig. 4). These results verified the expression of ␣4␤2 receptors in both microglia/macrophages and astrocytes after cerebral ischemia that ran in parallel with the
expression pattern showed by TSPO. In addition, immunohistochemistry showed an overall increase of ␣4␤2 ⫹/CD11b ⫹ cells
and microglial/␣4␤2 receptors immunoreactivity at day 7, followed by a dramatic decrease at day 28 after cerebral ischemia.

Likewise, both ␣4␤2 ⫹/GFAP ⫹ cells and astrocytic/␣4␤2 receptors signal intensity experienced a progressive increase of reactive
atrocytic cells from day 7 on (Fig. 5). Therefore, the present results support the previous PET imaging results obtained with
2[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380, showing that the ␣4␤2 receptor overexpression observed at day 7 after MCAO was promoted by the
␣4␤2 receptor expression increase by microglial and astrocytic
cells. Despite these findings, little is known concerning the role of
nicotinic receptors on inflammation underlying experimental
ischemic stroke.
Modulation of the neuroinflammatory response using DH␤E
The expression of nAChR ␣7 has been found in microglia/macrophages and its presence is required for acetylcholine inhibition
of macrophage TNF release, becoming an essential key for the
regulation of inflammation (Wang et al., 2003, Shytle et al.,
2004). In addition, the stimulation of ␣4␤2 receptors by nicotine
has promoted inhibition of ␤-amyloid toxicity to cortical neurons and its activity has been reversed by the specific ␣4␤2 nicotinic receptor antagonist DH␤E (Kihara et al., 1998). For this
reason, a daily treatment after cerebral ischemia with DH␤E
was performed to explore the effect of ␣4␤2 receptors on the
neuroinflammatory reaction using [ 11C]PK11195 PET (Fig.
6). DH␤E-treated ischemic rats showed a significant increase
of [ 11C]PK11195 PET binding in the ischemic hemisphere in
relation to control ischemic rats, confirming the role exerted by
␣4␤2 on inflammatory reaction after experimental ischemic
stroke (Fig. 6). Likewise, these results stand in agreement with the
anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activity effects performed by such nicotinic receptor activators as nicotine and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in animal models of cerebral

et al., 2011), and neurodegeneration (Nizri et al., 2006, Park et al.,
2007, Nizri et al., 2008).
Neurofunctional outcome after cerebral ischemia
The peak of the inflammatory reaction observed by PET imaging from day 7 to day 14 was consistent with the functional
recovery observed in the ischemic rats. Both neurological and
behavioral tests performed in the present study showed similar results during the first week after ischemia, followed by a
gradual recovery of neurologic handicap and a faster improvement of contact/removal patch test from the second to the
third week after reperfusion (Fig. 7). Therefore, animals experienced a quasi-recovery of functional outcome 1 month after
stroke. Likewise, such capacity to undergo motor and cognitive recovery has been monitored in adult human brain after
stroke (Rossini et al., 2003).
Summary and conclusions
We report here the PET imaging of 2[ 18F]-fluoro-A85380 to assess ␣4␤2 bioavailability and its relationship with the neuroinflammatory response after long-term focal cerebral ischemia in
rats. These results confirmed a binding increase of 2[ 18F]-fluoro-

cerebral ischemia, followed by a progressive PET-binding decrease later on. These results are consistent with the binding profile of the radiotracer for neuroinflammation [ 11C]PK11195 after
experimental stroke in rats. In addition, ex vivo immunohistochemistry showed for the first time an overexpression of the ␣4␤2
in both microglia/macrophages and astrocytes, and treatment
with DHBE was able to promote an increase of inflammatory
reaction after MCAO. Therefore, these results provide novel information about the role of the ␣4␤2 receptor on the inflammatory reaction underlying cerebral ischemia in rats. Finally, these
findings might contribute to the discovery of novel biomarkers
that might guide the synthesis of new imaging contrast agents and
open new avenues into the diagnosis, evaluation, and therapy of
all spectra of neurologic diseases.
