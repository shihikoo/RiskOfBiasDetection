Abstract
Background/Aims: Prior studies demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs) including
IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α contribute to regulation of epilepsy-associated pathophysiological
processes in the specific brain regions, namely the parietal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala.
Moreover, GABA transporter type 1 and 3 (GAT-1 and GAT-3) modulating extracellular GABA
levels are engaged in the role played by PICs in epileptogenesis. Note that brain ischemic
injury also elevates cerebral PICs. Thus, in this report we examined the effects of nefiracetam
(NEF), a pyrrolidone derivative, on the levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, and expression of GAT1 and GAT-3 in the parietal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala using a rat model of postischemic nonconvulsive seizure (NCS). Methods: NCS was evoked by the middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO). ELISA and Western Blot analysis were employed to determine the
levels of PICs and GAT-1/GAT-3, respectively. Results: MCAO significantly increased IL-1β, IL-6
and TNF-α in the parietal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala as compared with sham control
animals (P<0.05 vs. control rats). Also, in these specific brain regions expression of GAT-1 and
GAT-3 was amplified; and the levels of GABA were decreased in rats following MCAO (P<0.05
vs. control rats). Systemic administration of NEF significantly attenuated the elevated PICs,
amplified GAT-1 and GAT-3 as well as impaired GABA. NEF also attenuated the number of NCS
events following MCAO. Conclusion: our data demonstrate that NEF improves post-ischemia
evoked-NCS by altering PICs, GABA transporters thereby alleviating GABA in the parietal
cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. This support a role for PICs and GABA in engagement of
the adaptive responses associated with epileptic activity, but also suggests that NEF has antiepileptic effects via PICs-GABA mechanisms, having pharmacological implications to target
the specific PICs for neuronal dysfunction and vulnerability related to post-ischemic seizures
and cognitive impairment.

Fu et al.: Proinflammatory Cytokines and Post-Ischemic Seizure

Introduction

Ischemic brain injury is one of the high risk factors for development of seizures; however,
the underlying mechanisms responsible for provoked seizures remain to be determined.
In general, it is believed that imbalanced excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory (GABA)
synaptic neurotransmissions coupled with altered functions of ion channels play a major
role in regulating post-ischemic seizures [1-4].
It has been reported that the two main subtypes of GABA transport (GAT) responsible
for the regulation of extracellular GABA levels in the central nervous system are GAT-1 and
GAT-3 [5, 6]. Throughout the brain these transporters are widely expressed in neuronal cell
(mainly GAT-1) and glial cells (mainly GAT-3), and published work has shown the role played
by GATs in regulating GABAa receptor-mediated postsynaptic tonic and phasic inhibition
in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus etc. [5, 6]. In light of the key role of GABAergic
transmission within the brain regions related to epileptic activity [7, 8], in this study, we
examined expression of GAT-1 and GAT-3 in the parietal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala
in a rat model of post-ischemic nonconvulsive seizure (NCS) evoked by the middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO).
Proinflammatory cytokines (PICs) such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in plasma and
cerebrospinal fluid and cells immunoreactive to those PICs in neuronal tissues are increased
in patients during epileptic development [9, 10]. This is consistent with the role for PICs
in engagement of the pathophysiology of epilepsy and/or brain damage following seizure.
Moreover, a recent report has demonstrated that the protein levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α
in the parietal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala are significantly increased during epilepsy
induced by cerebral injection of kainic acid [11]. Results of this study further suggest that
upregulation of GAT-1 and GAT-3 is caused by epilepsy-increased IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in
those specific brain regions [11]. Thus, in the current report, we speculated that the increases
of GAT-1 and GAT-3 would be accompanied with the greater levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in
the parietal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala of NCS rats.
Nefiracetam (NEF) is one of pyrrolidone derivatives used to improve impaired cognitive
functions often observed in patients with brain ischemic injury (i.e., stroke). It has recently
been reported that NEF also attenuates seizure activities by increasing threshold of seizure
evoked by amygdala-kindling and chemically induced seizures [12, 13]. Thus, NEF appears
to be an important drug candidate to apply for both seizure prophylaxis and neuroprotection
for patients suffering stroke who are more susceptible to developing post-ischemic seizures
and cognitive dysfunctions. As a result, we examined the effects of NEF on the levels of
IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, and expression of GAT-1 and GAT-3 as well as the levels of GABA
in the parietal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala of rats after induction of MCAO. We
hypothesized that NEF attenuates MCAO-activated PICs and upregulated GABA transporters
and thereby stabilizing GABA in the parietal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. Through
GABA mechanisms NEF is likely to improve NCS following MCAO.
All the animal procedures of this study and their care were conducted in conformity with the
institutional guidelines that are in compliance with the Guideline for the Care and Use of laboratory Animals
of the U.S. National Health Institute. Fifty-five male Sprague–Dawley rats (250–300 g) were used in our
experiments and all animals were maintained under 12 hours light/dark-cycle with free access to food and
water in a temperature- and humidity- controlled room.
The MCAO was performed to evoke NCS. Briefly, the rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital
(45 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) and then the right common carotid artery was exposed at the level of external
and internal carotid artery bifurcation. The external carotid artery and its branches were closed and cut
at the lingual and maxillary artery branches. A piece of 3-0 monofilament nylon suture was inserted into

the internal carotid artery via the stump of the external carotid artery. The filament was advanced for ~20
mm into the anterior cerebral artery. During this surgical procedure, cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF)
was continuously monitored with a laser-doppler flowmeter. Once a stable drop in blood flow signal was
obtained ipsilateral to the occlusion, the filament was secured to the vessel by ligation. In general, the
animals that show a decrease in CBF of >70% are considered ischemia and only those rats were included
into data analysis in this study. In sham control rats, the surgical procedures were performed without
arterial occlusion.
EEG recordings were performed and observed during 24 hours after induction of MCAO as described
previously [14]. Briefly, four electrodes were implanted on the rat skull symmetrically through burr holes
over bilateral frontal and parietal regions of the cortex (1 mm anterior and 4 mm posterior to bregma, 3.5
mm lateral to midline). A reference electrode was placed posterior to lambda over the transverse sinus. The
electrodes were soldered to a multi-pin connector. A computerized EEG recording was obtained via a Grass
polygraph amplifier and digitizing system (Grass Lab). The NCSs were detected via stainless steel electrodes
implanted on the rat skull. The off-line EEG traces were analyzed using the NCS criteria defined previously
[14]. The frequency of NCS was considered as the number of NCS events detected in each animal.
NEF (Sigma Co.) was dissolved in a saline solution at a final concentration of 15 mg/ml and given by
intraperitoneal injection (i.p., 30mg/kg, twice). Note that the first dose was injected at the end of MACO
surgery and the second one was injected 12 hours after the surgery. Control rats received the same volume
of i.p. injection of saline. Rats’ brains were removed 24 hours after the end of the MCAO surgery. Accordingly,
the rats were divided into sham control group (n=15) and MCAO group (n=20) with saline injection and
MCAO group with NEF injection (n=20).
The levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α were determined using a two-site immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA,
Promega Corp. Madison, WI) according to the provided description and modification. Briefly, polystyrene 96well microtiter immunoplates were coated with affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti- IL-1β, anti-IL-6 and
anti-TNF-α antibody. Parallel wells were coated with purified rabbit/mouse IgG for evaluation of nonspecific
signal. After overnight incubation at room temperature and 2 hours of incubation with the coating buffer,
plates were washed. The diluted samples and the each PIC standard solutions were distributed in each plate
and left at room temperature overnight. The plates were washed and incubated with anti- IL-1β, anti-IL-6
and anti-TNF-α galactosidase per well. Then, the plates were washed and incubated with substrate solution.
After an incubation of 2 hours at 37°C, the optical density was measured using an ELISA reader. In the
similar way, GABA levels were determined by the ELISA methods (LDN Diagnostics, Inc. Colorado Spring,
CO).
To examine expression of GAT-1 and GAT-3, the brain tissues were processed using a standard
western blot procedure. Briefly, total protein was extracted by homogenizing samples of the parietal cortex,
hippocampus and amygdala in ice-cold buffer. The buffer solution contains 25mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM
NaCl, 1% Nonidet (N) P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with protease
inhibitor cocktail kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The lysates were centrifuged and the supernatants
were collected for measurements of protein concentrations. Protein concentrations of the samples were
determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay reagent kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) with bovine
serum albumin as standard. After being denatured in buffer, the supernatant samples containing 20 μg of
protein were loaded onto 4-20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX gels and electrically transferred to a polyvinylidene
fluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat milk and was incubated overnight with
primary antibodies [mouse anti-GAT-3 (sc-376001) 1:200/rabbit anti-GAT-1 (sc-135679) at 1:200, Santa
Cruz products]. Next, the membranes were washed and incubated with an alkaline phosphatase conjugated
anti-mouse/ant-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1000). The immunoreactive proteins were detected by
enhanced chemiluminescence. The bands recognized by the primary antibody were visualized by exposure
of the membrane onto an x-ray film. The membrane was stripped and incubated with mouse anti-β-actin to
show equal loading of the protein. Then, the film was scanned and the optical density of GAT-1/GAT-3 and
β-actin bands was analyzed using the Scion Image software.
All data were presented as mean ± standard error (SEM). One-way repeated-measures analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was employed for comparison, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test as appropriate.
All statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS for Windows (version 13, SPSS). For all analyses,
statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

NCS. MCAO led to a less number of NCS in rats with NEF treatment as compared with rats
that received vehicle (P<0.05, NEF vs. vehicle in MCAO rats, n=20 in each group).
In general, PICs have been reported to be engaged alterations of neuronal damage and
electronic encephalography related to epileptic activity and significant increases in IL-1β,
IL-6 and TNF-α in hippocampus were observed following induction of seizure [15]. Using a
rat model of epilepsy, a recent study further demonstrated that the levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and
TNF-α in the specific brain regions such as the parietal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala
were increased during seizure [11]. Moreover, results of this prior study showed that
GABA transporters, namely GAT-1 and GAT-3 are upregulated during seizure via receptor
mechanisms of IL-1β and TNF-α [11]. Accordingly, we examined the effects of NCS evoked
by MCAO on IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α activity as well as expression of GAT-1 and GAT-3 in those
brain regions. We further if injection of NEF improved the levels of cytokines and GAT-1
and GAT-3 and resultant GABA. Our data provided the first evidence that systemic injection
of NEF plays a role in reinstating impaired GABA in the parietal cortex, hippocampus and
amygdala likely via attenuating enhancement of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α as well as GAT-1 and
GAT-3.
Elevated levels of PICs in the brain are associated with increased seizure vulnerability
and seizure-related pathological changes such as neuronal death [16-18], suggesting that
inflammation has been implicated in epileptogenesis. In a rat model of epilepsy, neural
injuries in the brain occur and this is accompanied by upregulation of PICs including IL-1β,
IL-6 and TNF-α in glial cells [15, 19]. Furthermore, neuronal degeneration is observed likely
due to increases of PICs [20, 21]. For example, IL-1β can increase seizure susceptibility in
rat brains [22]. Intracerebral injection of a high dosage of IL-1β results in limbic seizures in
wild type mice, but not in transgenic mice with deficient IL-1β receptors [23]. In addition,
antiepileptic activity is observed after using thalidomide to decrease the levels of TNF-α [24].
With respect to the role played by central IL-6 in regulating epileptic activity, it should
be acknowledged that prior studies demonstrate that IL-6 can stimulate the synthesis
of corticotrophin and glucocorticoids, and initiate an anti-inflammatory feedback loop,
suggesting a neuroprotective role played by IL-6 [25, 26]. A recent study showed that blocking
receptors of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α had different effects on expression of GAT-1 and GAT-3
[11]. It was suggested that activation of IL-1β and TNF-α receptors, but not IL-6 receptor
plays a role in regulating GAT-1 and GAT-3. It is assumed that this discrepancy is likely due
to intracellular signaling mechanisms for PICs to play a role. A great deal of evidence has
demonstrated that IL-1β and TNF-α play a role mainly via p38 MAPK, ERK and JNK signaling
transduction pathways, but IL-6 plays a role via JAK-STAT pathways [27-29]. After activation
of those signaling pathways, gene transcription occurs [30-32]. What different mechanisms
by which those signaling transduction pathways are responsible for regulating expression
of GAT-1 and GAT-3 via PIC receptors needs to be determined. Nevertheless, it is crucial to
determine neural substrates to play a role in the initiation of neuronal excitability responsible
for NCS.
GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nerve system in control of
neuronal excitability. After GABA release from presynaptic terminals, GATs play a key role
in regulating a rapid removal of extracellular GABA [1, 3], which thereby leads to ending
of inhibitory synaptic transmission. Thus, this mechanism is also responsible for GABA
spillover to neighboring synapses [1, 2] and GABA homeostasis and then excessive tonic
activation of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA receptors are prevented [1, 4]. In contrast,
under certain pathological and physiological conditions the GATs functions are impaired and
this is likely to result in the exaggerated GABA release [33, 34]. Results of our current study
demonstrated that the levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly increased in the
specific brain regions such as parietal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala after induction of

MCAO (Fig. 1). Also, our data further showed that protein expression of both GAT1 and GAT3
were greater in those brain regions of MCAO-animals than them in those regions of control
animals (Fig. 2). Consistent with this line of results, our data demonstrated that GABA levels
were lower in those specific regions of MCAO rats than them in control rats (Fig. 3). Important
findings from the current study are that injection of NEF attenuated increases in IL-1β, IL-6
and TNF-α as well as augmented GAT1 and GAT3 expression and thereby restored the levels
of GABA in those brain regions (Fig. 1-3). Moreover, NEF significantly decreased the number
of NCS events following induction of MCAO (Fig. 4).
Overall, our data suggest that MCAO amplifies the levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in
in the parietal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. Our data also suggest that MCAO leads
to upregulation of GAT-1 and GAT-3 likely via stimulation of IL-1β and TNF-α receptors
and downregulation of GABA. As a result, GABA-mediated inhibitory effects on neuronal
activities in those specific brain regions are impaired and this is likely to cause neurological
deficits induced by MCAO. Since GAT-1 is widely expressed in neuronal cells and GAT-3 is
mainly present in glial cells throughout the brain [1, 5], results of the current study suggest
that PICs are likely to play a role in regulating a GABA inhibitory system in the neuronal
and glial cells after induction of NCS. NEF plays a beneficial role in regulating NCS via GABA
pathways following MCAO.
A few issues need to be acknowledged. First, data of our current study did not determine
what cellular mechanism to drive cytokine expression. Second, we did not determine
whether neuronal cells and/or glial cells secrete cytokines. In this study, we used ELISA
method to examine the levels of cytokines in a quantitative manner and this provided us a
better opportunity making comparison of cytokines among groups. In contrast, it should
be noted that immunohistochemical method is a better method to examine localization of
cytokines, which possibly identifies cytokine positive staining in neurons and/or glial cells.
It is speculated that both neuronal cells and glial cells are likely engaged in increases of
cytokines in the specific brain regions examined since MCAO leads to a global brain injuries.
Conclusion

We have provided evidence that cerebral ischemia induced- NCS and this amplifies
the levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in the parietal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala.
Ischemia further leads to upregulation of GABA transporter subtypes GAT-1 and GAT-3
thereby decreases the levels of GABA in those brain regions. These abnormalities are likely
to contribute to the enhanced neuronal excitability in those brain regions of animals with
NCS. Of note, systemic administration of NEF improves enhancement of cytokines as well as
amplified GAT-1 and GAT-3 expression and restores impaired GABA. This further improves
cerebral ischemia evoked-NCS. Our results may offer promising clues for the development
of new therapeutic strategies for managing intractable symptoms observed in patients with
epilepsy after cerebral ischemia.
