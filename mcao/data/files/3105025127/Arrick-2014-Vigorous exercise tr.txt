ABSTRACT
Objective: Our objective was to examine whether vigorous exercise
training (VExT) could influence nitric oxide synthase (NOS)dependent vasodilation and transient focal ischemia-induced brain
injury. Rats were divided into sedentary (SED) or VExT groups.
Materials and Methods: Exercise was carried out 5 days/week for a
period of 8–10 weeks. First, we measured responses of pial arterioles
to an eNOS-dependent (ADP), an nNOS-dependent (NMDA) and a
NOS-independent (nitroglycerin) agonist in SED and VExT rats.
Second, we measured infarct volume in SED and VExT rats
following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Third, we
measured superoxide levels in brain tissue of SED and VExT rats
under basal and stimulated conditions.
Results: We found that eNOS- and nNOS-dependent, but not
NOS-independent vasodilation, was increased in VExT compared to
SED rats, and this could be inhibited with L-NMMA in both groups.

In addition, we found that VExT reduced infarct volume following
MCAO when compared to SED rats. Further, superoxide levels were
similar in brain tissue from SED and VExT rats under basal and
stimulated conditions.
Conclusions: We suggest that VExT potentiates NOS-dependent
vascular reactivity and reduces infarct volume following MCAO via
a mechanism that appears to be independent of oxidative stress, but
presumably related to an increase in the contribution of nitric oxide.

INTRODUCTION
Exercise training has been shown to have beneficial effects on
the health of large and small blood vessels presumably via an
influence on endothelial function. Studies have shown that
moderate exercise training enhances eNOS-dependent reactivity of large and small peripheral blood vessels (skeletal
muscle, heart, and skin) in animal models and human
subjects [4, 13, 14, 16, 17, 42, 47]. Mechanisms by which
exercise training potentiates eNOS-dependent vascular
responses are likely to be related to increase the synthesis/
release of nitric oxide [18, 36, 37, 45], an increase in the
activity of antioxidant enzymes [15, 19, 21, 26, 35, 38], and/
or via an enhancement of multiple vasodilator pathways [4].
In recent studies, we examined the influence of moderate
exercise training on NOS-dependent (eNOS and nNOS)

516

responses of cerebral arterioles and on brain injury following
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in nondiabetic and diabetic
rats [1,30,32]. We found that moderate exercise training
restored impaired eNOS- and nNOS-dependent responses of
cerebral arterioles in diabetic rats toward that observed in
nondiabetic rats and prevented the elevated level of brain
injury observed in diabetic rats to that seen in nondiabetic
rats [1,30]. Surprisingly, however, we did not observe a
significant influence of moderate exercise training on eNOSor nNOS-dependent reactivity of cerebral arterioles or brain
injury following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in nondiabetic
(control) rats [1,30]. Thus, although a moderate level of
exercise training was beneficial in diabetic rats, it was not
sufficient to provide a beneficial effect in control rats. We
reasoned that this finding in control rats might be related to
the intensity of exercise training. Therefore, the first goal of

the present study was to examine the effects of VExT on
eNOS- and nNOS-dependent responses of cerebral (pial)
resistance arterioles. Our second goal was to examine the
influence of VExT on brain injury following MCAO. Finally,
in an attempt to determine mechanisms for an effect of VExT
on the brain, our third goal was to determine the role of
nitric oxide in vascular reactivity during VExT and determine
the influence of VExT on superoxide levels in brain tissue.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Exercise Training
All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Louisiana
State University Health Sciences Center-Shreveport. The
experiments were carried out in accordance with the Code of
Ethics for the use of animals in research. Male SpragueDawley rats (180–200 g body wt; two to three months of age)
were randomly divided into a SED or VExT groups. All rats
had access to food and water ad libitum. Rats were exercised
using standard techniques similar to that which we have
described previously [1,30]. Treadmill exercise was carried
out five days/week until the day before the experiment.
Experiments were conducted 8–10 weeks after starting
treadmill exercise. The length of time on the treadmill was
initially 10 min/day for the first five days at 0% grade at a
speed of 20 M/min. Over the next five days, the speed was
increased to 25 M/min, the time was increased by 10 minutes each day to reach a duration of 60 minutes on the
treadmill and the incline remained at 0% grade. Over the
next three days on the treadmill, the speed (25 M/min) and
duration (60 minutes) remained the same, but the incline
was increased to a 5% grade. Finally, during the next two
days and continuing for the remainder of the experimental
protocol, the speed (25 M/min) and duration (60 minutes)
remained the same, but the incline was increase to 10%.
Thus, it took 15 days to reach the maximum training
regimen and this continued for the duration of the experimental period. Rats were not exercised one day prior to
experiments.

Reactivity of Pial Arterioles
SED (n = 9) and VExT (n = 17) rats were prepared for in
vivo examination of reactivity of cerebral arterioles. Rats were
anesthetized (thiobutabarbital (Inactin); 100 mg/kg i.p.) and
a tracheotomy was performed. The animals were ventilated
mechanically with room air and supplemental oxygen. A
catheter was inserted into a femoral vein for injection of
supplemental anesthesia (10–30 mg/kg). A femoral artery
was cannulated for measurement of arterial pressure. After
placement of all catheters, the animal was placed in a head
holder and a craniotomy was made over the left parietal
cortex to expose the pial microcirculation [31]. The cranial

ª 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

window was suffused with artificial cerebral spinal fluid
bubbled with 95% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide. Temperature of the suffusate was maintained at 37  1°C. The
cranial window was connected via a three-way valve to an
infusion pump, which allowed for infusion of agonists into
the suffusate. Arterial blood gases were monitored and
maintained within normal limits. After an equilibration
period of 30–45 minutes, we examined dilation of pial
arterioles in SED and VExT to an eNOS-dependent agonist
(ADP; 10 and 100 lM), an nNOS-dependent agonist
(NMDA; 100 and 300 lM), and a NOS-independent
agonist (nitroglycerin; 0.1 and 1.0 lM). Agonists were mixed
in artificial cerebral spinal fluid and superfused over the
cranial window preparation. The diameter of pial arterioles
was measured immediately before the application of agonists
and every minute for five minutes during application of the
agonists. Steady-state responses were reached within two to
three minutes after application, and the diameter of pial
arterioles returned to baseline within five minutes after
application of the agonists was stopped. After this initial test
of vascular reactivity, we then started a continuous suffusion
of L-NMMA (100 lM) over the cranial window preparation.
Thirty minutes after starting this superfusion, we again
measured responses of pial arterioles in SED and VExT rats
to ADP, NMDA, and nitroglycerin.

Assessment of Brain Injury Following MCAO
Transient focal cerebral ischemia was performed using
methods we have described previously [44,49,50]. On the
day of the experiment, SED (n = 15) and VExT (n = 16) rats
were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100/15 mg/kg i.p.,
respectively). A laser Doppler flow probe (PeriFlux System
5000, Jarfalla, Sweden) was attached to the right side of the
dorsal surface of the skull (2 mm caudal and 6 mm lateral to
the bregma) to observe the decrease in cerebral blood flow
during MCAO. A 4-0 monofilament nylon suture was
prepared by rounding its tip by heating and coating with
silicon. The right common and external carotid arteries were
exposed and ligated. The MCA was occluded by inserting the
filament from the basal area of the external carotid artery,
and advancing it cranially into the internal carotid artery to
the point where the MCA branched from the internal carotid
artery. Onset of MCAO was determined by a rapid drop in
cerebral blood flow, as measured by the laser Doppler. After
occluding the MCA for two hours, reperfusion was initiated
by removing the suture. Following 24 hours of reperfusion,
the SED and VExT rats were euthanized, the brains were
quickly removed and placed in ice-cold saline for five
minutes. The brains were then cut into six 2-mm-thick
coronal sections. The sections were stained with 2% TTC
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 15 minutes at
37°C. Slice images were digitalized and the infarct lesion was
evaluated using Kodak Molecular Imaging Software. Com-

plete lack of staining with TTC was defined as the infarct
lesion. The infarct volume was expressed as percentage of the
contralateral hemisphere. We measured the total infarct
volume, cortical infarct volume, and subcortical infarct
volume in SED and VExT, as described previously [44,49].

Superoxide Levels
Superoxide levels were measured by lucigenin-enhanced
chemiluminescence as described previously [6,7,33]. In SED
(n = 19) and VExT (n = 23) rats, the brains were removed
and placed in a Krebs/HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) with the
following composition (in mmol/L): 118 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2
KH2PO4, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.3 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 25 NaHCO3, and
5 glucose. Samples of cortex tissue, cut from brains of SED
and VExT rats, were placed in polypropylene tubes containing 5 lM lucigenin. The tubes were then read in a Sirius/
FB15 luminometer (Berthold Detections Systems, Pforzheim,
Germany), which reports RLU emitted over a 30-second
interval for five minutes. Levels of superoxide reported are
the value of tissue plus lucigenin-containing buffer minus
background (lucigenin-containing buffer without tissue) and
are normalized for tissue weight (RLU/min/mg tissue). We
measured basal levels of superoxide and levels of superoxide
in response to NADPH, a substrate for NADPH oxidase [6].

Citrate Synthase Activity
To determine the level of exercise training in the VExT rats,
we obtained a sample of the soleus muscle from SED (n = 6)
and VExT (n = 13) rats. Citrate synthase activity was
measured using a standard kit (CS0720; Sigma-Aldrich).
Citrate synthase activity was determined based on the
formation of 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid and measured at a
wavelength of 412 nm with the aid of spectrophotometer.
The background absorbance was measured, then the reaction
was initiated by the addition of oxaloacetic acid and the
change in absorbance was measured.

pial arterioles, mean arterial pressure, and body weight were
similar in SED and VExT rats. However, blood glucose
concentration was less in VExT rats when compared with
SED rats and citrate synthase activity was significantly
elevated in VExT rats when compared with SED rats.

Responses of Pial Arterioles
We examined functional responses of pial arterioles to
eNOS- and nNOS-dependent agonists (ADP and NMDA,
respectively), and a NOS-independent agonist (nitroglycerin)
in SED and VExT rats. We found that ADP- and NMDAinduced dilation of pial arterioles was significantly greater in
VExT rats when compared with SED rats (Figures 1 and 2,
respectively). In contrast to that observed with ADP and
NMDA, nitroglycerin produced similar dose-related dilation
of pial arterioles in SED and VExT rats (Figure 3). Thus, it
does not appear that the effect of VExT on ADP- and

Statistical Analysis
Unpaired t-tests were used to compare differences in
reactivity of cerebral arterioles to the agonists, superoxide
anion levels, infarct volumes and levels of citrate synthase in
SED and VExT rats. A paired t-test was used to compare
differences in reactivity of cerebral arterioles before and
following application of L-NMMA. A p value of 0.05 or less
was considered significant.

NMDA-induced vasodilation is related to a nonspecific effect
of VExT on vascular function.
Next, we determined whether the contribution of nitric
oxide to vasodilation in response to ADP and NMDA might
be altered in VExT rats. We found that topical application of
L-NMMA produced a similar decrease in baseline diameter of
cerebral arterioles in SED (6  2%) and VExT (7  2%)
rats. In addition, L-NMMA significantly decreased responses
of cerebral arterioles to ADP and NMDA in both SED and
VExT rats (Figures 4 and 5, respectively). Thus, it appears
that the increase in vasodilation observed in the VExT rats in
response to ADP and NMDA is related to the synthesis/
release of nitric oxide.

Superoxide Production
We measured superoxide levels in cortex tissue in SED and
VExT rats under basal conditions and during stimulation
with NADPH, a substrate for NADPH oxidase. We found
that the levels of superoxide in cortex tissue were similar in
SED and VExT rats under basal and stimulated states
(Figure 6). Thus, it appears that VExT does not influence the
basal production of superoxide or the ability to produce
superoxide under stimulated states.

MCAO-Induced Brain Injury
We measured infarct volumes in SED and VExT rats
following MCAO. We found that total infarct volume
produced by a two-hour MCAO followed by 24 hours of
reperfusion was greater in SED than in VExT rats (Figure 7).
Identification of the location of the infarct revealed that
VExT significantly decreased cortical infarct volume, with
subcortical infarct volume being similar in SED and VExT
rats (Figure 7).

DISCUSSION
There are four major new findings of the present study. First,
we found that VExT increased responses of cerebral arterioles

to eNOS- and nNOS-dependent agonists. This effect of VExT
was specific since nitroglycerin produced similar dilation of
cerebral arterioles in SED and VExT rats. Second, the
increase in NOS-dependent reactivity of cerebral arterioles
during VExT appeared to be related to the synthesis/release
of nitric oxide as there was a significant reduction in
responsiveness following application of L-NMMA. Third,
VExT did not have a significant effect on either basal levels or
agonist-induced levels of superoxide. Thus, we suggest that
the effects of VExT on vascular function and brain injury
following MCAO are not related to an influence of VExT on
superoxide. Fourth, we found a significant protective effect of
VExT on infarct volume following MCAO. Based upon these
findings, we speculate that VExT may have an important
therapeutic potential for reducing brain damage subsequent
to a cerebral ischemic event, presumably by a mechanism
that appears to involve the ability of nitric oxide to potentiate
vascular function, and possibly cerebral blood flow.

Consideration of Methods
In the present study, we used ADP and NMDA to examine
eNOS- and nNOS-dependent responses of cerebral arterioles,
respectively. Previous studies have suggested that ADP dilates

520

cerebral arterioles via activation of NOS, presumably eNOS
[2,9,29], whereas others [28,48] have suggested that relaxation of the rat MCA to purines is related, in part, to nitric
oxide and an EDHF. In the present study, we found that LNMMA decreased responses of cerebral arterioles to ADP (10
and 100 lM) by about 85% and 76%, respectively, in SED
rats, and by 80% and 74%, respectively, in VExT rats. Thus,
it appears that nitric oxide plays a similar role in responses of
cerebral arterioles to ADP in both SED and VExT rats.
Regarding responses to NMDA, we and others have shown
that NMDA dilates cerebral arterioles via the activation of
nNOS and the subsequent synthesis/release of nitric oxide
[10–12,43]. The findings from the present study support this
conclusion. In addition, we found that L-NMMA decreased
responses of cerebral arterioles to NMDA (100 and 300 lM)
by about 70% and 60%, respectively, in SED rats and by
about 75% and 76%, respectively, in VExT rats. Thus, it
appears that nitric oxide plays a similar significant role in
responses of cerebral arterioles to NMDA in SED and VExT
rats.
We reasoned that an increase in vascular responsiveness to
NOS-dependent agonists might be related to an influence of
VExT on superoxide levels, i.e., antioxidant enzyme systems

VExT

Although we qualitatively examined changes in cerebral
blood flow during MCAO in the SED and VExT rats, we
did not quantify these changes. Thus, it is conceivable that
the protective effect of VExT on brain infarct volume
following MCAO might be related to differences in the
relative level of ischemia produced in the two groups of rats
by MCAO.

as has been shown by others [15, 19, 21, 26, 35, 38]. We
thought that if basal levels of superoxide were decreased by
VExT, then this might influence the bioavailability of nitric
oxide, and hence influence vascular reactivity to NOSdependent agonists. However, we found that basal levels of
superoxide were similar in SED and VExT rats. This finding
is similar to that which we have reported previously for
moderate ExT [30], and suggests that increased responses of
cerebral arterioles to NOS-dependent agonists in VExT rats
are probably not related to an effect of superoxide on nitric
oxide bioavailability. In addition, we found that agonistinduced stimulation of superoxide with NADPH was similar
in SED and VExT rats, suggesting that the ability to produce
superoxide is not altered by VExT. Thus, we suggest that
levels of superoxide may not be the limiting factor in
enhanced vascular responsiveness and protection against
brain damage following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion by
VExT.

Many have examined the effects of exercise on NOSdependent reactivity in animals and human subjects [17,
22, 24, 25, 41, 42]. For the most part, these studies have
suggested that exercise enhances NOS-dependent dilation/
relaxation of skeletal and peripheral blood arteries and
arterioles. The precise mechanism(s) by which exercise
potentiates NOS-dependent responses are not clear, but
have been suggested to be related to an increase in eNOS [36,
41]. In previous studies, we have reported that moderate
exercise training produced a small, but significant increase in
eNOS and nNOS proteins in cerebral blood vessels and brain
tissue from nondiabetic (control) rats [30, 32]. However, this
increase in eNOS and nNOS proteins did not equate with an
increase in reactivity of large (basilar artery) and small (pial
arterioles) cerebral vessels to eNOS- or nNOS-dependent
agonists [1, 30, 32]. The mechanisms by which exercise
training produces an increase in eNOS protein may be
related to changes in shear stress across endothelium [3, 18].
While we and others have shown that exercise training
produces an increase in nNOS protein in the brain and other
organ systems, the mechanism for this effect of exercise
training on nNOS remains elusive [30, 34, 46, 51]. In the
present study, we used a more vigorous level of exercise
training (increased speed, greater incline, and longer duration) to determine whether this regimen might influence
cerebrovascular function. We found that VExT produced a
significant increase in NOS-dependent reactivity and protected the brain from ischemia/reperfusion injury following
MCAO. Thus, we suggest that although a moderate level of
ExT may be beneficial during disease states, a more vigorous
level of ExT may be required to influence cerebrovascular
function and brain injury in animals devoid of disease.
However, as we increased the duration as well as the intensity
of exercise training in the present study when compared with
our previous study [1, 30], we cannot rule out that a longer
duration of exercise training (at a similar level of intensity)
would be beneficial on vascular function and brain injury
following MCAO. Future studies could examine the relationship between duration and/or intensity on the protective
effects of exercise training.
Epidemiological studies examining the impact of preexercise training on the risk of ischemic stroke have met with
mixed results. Some have reported that pre-exercise training
was associated with improved functional outcome after a

521

D.M. Arrick et al.

stroke, a less severe level of stroke, and/or a decrease in the
actual occurrence of an ischemic stroke [5, 20, 23, 27, 39, 40].
Others have examined the influence of pre-exercise training
on the pathogenesis of stroke using animal models. Endres
et al. [8] found that three weeks of exercise training prior to
induction of MCAO could protect against cerebral ischemic
damage in eNOS wild-type mice, but not in eNOS knockout
mice, suggesting that the protective effect of pre-exercise
training was related to eNOS activity. The findings from the
present study are in agreement and extend the findings of
this previous study. We found that VExT could potentiate
eNOS- and nNOS-dependent responses of cerebral arterioles
and could protect the brain from cerebral ischemic damage
following MCAO via a mechanism that is presumably related
an increase in nitric oxide synthesis/release and not related to
an influence of VExT on oxidative stress.
In summary, we examined the effects of VExT on eNOSand nNOS-dependent reactivity of cerebral resistance arterioles and on brain injury following cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion. We found that VExT potentiated eNOS- and
nNOS-dependent dilation of cerebral arterioles. In addition,
we found that VExT alleviated brain injury following MCAO.
Furthermore, basal and agonist-induced levels of superoxide
were not influenced by VExT. Based upon these findings, we
suggest that ExT can restore impaired eNOS- and nNOS-

PERSPECTIVE
We report that VExT potentiated eNOS- and nNOSdependent dilation of cerebral arterioles and alleviated brain
injury following MCAO. In addition, basal and agonistinduced levels of superoxide were not influenced by VExT.
Based upon these findings, we suggest that VExT can restore
impaired cerebrovascular function via mechanisms that may
regulate the balance between oxidative stress and nitric oxide
synthesis/release. We speculate that VExT may have an
important therapeutic potential for reducing brain damage
subsequent to a cerebral ischemic event presumably by a
mechanism that appears to involve the ability of nitric oxide
to potentiate vascular function, and possibly cerebral blood
flow.
