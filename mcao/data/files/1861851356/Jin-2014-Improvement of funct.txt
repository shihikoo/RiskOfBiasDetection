Acute AMPK activation exacerbates ischemic brain damage experimentally. Paradoxically, the clinical use
of an AMPK activator metformin reduces the incidence of stroke. We investigated whether post-stroke
chronic metformin treatment promotes functional recovery and tissue repair via an M2-polarization
mechanism following experimental stroke. Mice were randomly divided to receive metformin or vehicle
daily beginning at 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Neurological deﬁcits were
monitored for 30 days following MCAO. To characterize the polarization of the microglia and inﬁltrating
macrophages, the expression of the M1 and M2 signature genes was analyzed with qPCR, ELISA and
immunohistochemistry. Post-MCAO angiogenesis and neurogenesis were examined immunohistochemically. An in vitro angiogenesis model was employed to examine whether metformin promoted angiogenesis in a M2 polarization-dependent manner. Post-stroke chronic metformin treatment had no impact on
acute infarction but enhanced cerebral AMPK activation, promoted functional recovery and skewed the
microglia/macrophages toward an M2 phenotype following MCAO. Metformin also signiﬁcantly
increased angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the ischemic brain. Consistently, metformin-induced M2
polarization of BV2 microglial cells depended on AMPK activation in vitro. Furthermore, treatment of
brain endothelial cells with conditioned media collected from metformin-polarized BV2 cells promoted
angiogenesis in vitro. In conclusion, post-stroke chronic metformin treatment improved functional
recovery following MCAO via AMPK-dependent M2 polarization. Modulation of microglia/macrophage
polarization represents a novel therapeutic strategy for stroke.

1. Introduction
Metformin is a drug that is widely used for the treatment of
type 2 diabetes and is well-recognized as an activator of adenosine
50 -monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Zhou et al.,
2001). AMPK serves as a sensor of energy balance and is activated
in response to low energy supply (Hardie, 2011a,b). AMPK
expression is abundant in the brain, and cerebral AMPK is rapidly

activated in response to cerebral ischemia (McCullough et al.,
2005). Both pharmacological inhibitors and genetic deletion of
AMPK have been shown to confer acute neuroprotection following
experimental stroke (McCullough et al., 2005; Li et al., 2007; Li and
McCullough, 2010). These ﬁndings seem to indicate that AMPK
activation has a deleterious role in stroke pathogenesis. However,
epidemiological studies have shown that chronic metformin
treatment for diabetes is associated with reductions in stroke risk
and severity and that these effects are independent of the drug’s
glucose-lowering effects (Selvin and Hirsch, 2008; Anon., 1998).
Additionally, the effects of metformin following experimental
stroke remain controversial. It has been reported that acute
administration of metformin prior to ischemia exacerbates acute

132

infarct damage, whereas post-ischemic chronic metformin administration reduces brain atrophy after experimental stroke (Li et al.,
2010). However, the underlying mechanisms of these effects are
largely unknown.
Currently, the effects of AMPK activation on stroke outcomes
are almost exclusively attributed to a neuronal mechanism (Li
and McCullough, 2010; Manwani and McCullough, 2013). It has
been suggested that AMPK activation leads to progressive acidosis
following cerebral ischemia and thus ampliﬁes ischemic neuronal
death (Li and McCullough, 2010; Li et al., 2010; Manwani and
McCullough, 2013). However, it is well accepted that stroke
outcomes, particularly long-term functional recovery, are not
solely determined by acute neuronal loss (Saver, 2010a,b). Thus,
whether other mechanisms account for the beneﬁcial effects of
chronic metformin treatment of stroke outcomes remains to be
investigated.
In addition to serving as a sensor of energy balance, AMPK is a
regulator of the functional phenotypes of microglia/macrophages
(Sag et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2010). In response to microenvironment
signals, microglia/macrophages are highly plastic and assume different functional phenotypes that critically inﬂuence the damage
and tissue repair that occurs following injury (O’Neill and Hardie,
2013; Mantovani et al., 2013; David and Kroner, 2011). For example, the brain-resident microglia and peripheral macrophages that
inﬁltrate the ischemic brain following cerebral ischemia transiently assume M2 phenotype and subsequently assume long-term
M1 phenotype (Hu et al., 2012). M1 polarized microglia exacerbate
neuronal death, while M2 polarized microglia protect neurons
against in vitro ischemia (Hu et al., 2012). Moreover, the available
evidence suggests that M1 macrophages/microglia are deleterious
to tissue recovery following injury, while mounting evidence suggests that M2 macrophages/microglia enhance post-injury tissue
repair (Mantovani et al., 2013; Kigerl et al., 2009). Although metformin is well recognized as an AMPK-activator that promotes
the M2 polarization of macrophages (Kato et al., 2010; Nath
et al., 2009; Tsoyi et al., 2011), whether metformin beneﬁcially
affects long-term stroke outcomes via an M2 polarization mechanism remains unclear.

2. Methods
2.1. Experimental stroke
All animal experiments and surgical procedures were approved
by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Soochow University.
Male CD-1 mice weighing 25–30 g were purchased from SLAC Laboratory Animals (Shanghai, China). The mice were housed under in
a controlled-temperature environment under a 12-h light/dark cycle and allowed free access to food and water. Cerebral ischemia
was induced by reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) via an intraluminal suture technique as described in previous publications (Mao et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2010). Brieﬂy, the
mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane, and their body temperatures were maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5 °C with warming pads. A laser
Doppler probe was afﬁxed to the skull to monitor cortical perfusion
to verify the occlusion and reperfusion. A skin incision was made to
expose right common carotid and external and internal carotid
arteries. A silicon-coated nylon monoﬁlament with a heat-blunted
tip (diameter 0.22 ± 0.02 mm) was inserted into the right internal
carotid artery via the external carotid artery until the tip of the ﬁlament reached the origin of the middle cerebral artery as indicated
by an abrupt drop in cortical perfusion as measured by laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (<30% of the baseline). After securing the ﬁlament,
the surgical site was closed, and the mice were returned to a clean
cage. Sixty minutes after occlusion, the ﬁlament was withdrawn to

allow for reperfusion. Sham-operated mice received identical surgeries with the exception that the ﬁlament was not inserted.
2.2. Animal groups
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, mice were randomly divided
into two groups that received either intraperitoneal (IP) injections
of metformin (50 mg/kg/day) or injections of equal volumes of saline (NS) until sacriﬁce. The mice were sacriﬁced at 3, 7, 14 and
30 days after MCAO for the in vivo experiments as speciﬁcally indicated. To investigate the effects of metformin on neurogenesis
in vivo, another cohort of mice received metformin (50 mg/kg/day)
or saline daily starting 24 h after MCAO and were further treated
with 5-bromo-20 -deoxyuridine-50 -monophosphate (BrdU) to label
dividing cells. BrdU (50 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally
twice daily for 7 days beginning at 24 h after MCAO. The BrdUinjected mice were sacriﬁced 14 days after MCAO, and their
brains were collected to assess neurogenesis. The mortality rates
of metformin- and saline-treated mice over the 30-day and
14-day schedules are shown in Supplemental Fig. 1.
2.3. Behavioral testing
Modiﬁed neurological severity scores (mNSSs) were assessed to
evaluate neurological deﬁcits over the 30 days after MCAO as described in our previous publication (Mao et al., 2013). Brieﬂy,
mNSSs were graded on a scale of 0–18, and the scores were
awarded when mice were unable to perform the tests or lacked
the tested reﬂexes as described in detail in Supplemental Table 1.
The higher the scores, the more severe the injury was.
The Corner test was used to assess MCAO-induced sensorimotor
abnormalities as described previously (Zhang et al., 2002). Brieﬂy, a
corner was made with an angle of 30° using two cardboard pieces
each with dimensions of 30  20  1 cm3. The mice were forced to
enter the corner. When the mice entered deep into the corner, both
sides of the vibrissae were stimulated. This caused the mice to rear
and turn back to the open end. Non-ischemic mice turned either
left or right, but the MCAO mice preferentially turned toward the
non-impaired (right) side. The numbers of left and right over ten
trials were recorded.
The rotarod test was used to examine balance and coordination
deﬁcits in the MCAO mice as previously described (Lee et al., 2004).
The mice were placed onto the rungs of the accelerating rotarod.
The speed was increased slowly from 5 to 40 rpm. The time that
mice remained on the rotarod was measured. A trial ended when
the animal fell or jumped off the rod. The animals were trained
for 3 days prior to MCAO to obtain stable baselines. The animals
were allowed to recover in their home cages for at least 15 min before a new trial was started. The mean duration (in seconds) over
three individual trials was recorded.
2.4. Histological assessment of brain damage following MCAO
We evaluated acute infarct volumes 4 days after MCAO using
triphenyl-2,3,4-tetrazolium-chloride (TTC) histology. The mice
were treated with metformin or saline daily beginning 24 h after
MCAO. The brains were collected 4 days after MCAO and cut into
four 2-mm-thick slices. The slices were incubated in saline containing 1% TTC (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 37 °C for 5 min for each
side. Next, the slices were ﬁxed in PB buffer containing 10% formaldehyde for 24 h. The slices were photographed, and infarct sizes
were analyzed across all slices using digital image analysis software (SigmaScan Pro, Jandel, San Rafael, CA).
To assess the histological damage 30 days after MCAO, we
examined the degree of cortical cavitation. The mice were treated
with metformin or saline daily beginning 24 h after MCAO. Thirty

Q. Jin et al. / Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 40 (2014) 131–142

days after MCAO, the brains were collected to assess of the degree
of cortical cavitation using ‘cortical width index’ as described previously (Taguchi et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2006). Brieﬂy, whole-brain
images were captured. The distance from the edge of cortical cavitation to the midline on the ischemic hemisphere and the distance
from the lateral edge to the midline on the contralateral side were
measured. All measurements were performed at the midpoint of
the forebrain. The cortical width index was calculated by dividing
the edge-to-midline distance on the ischemic side by that on the
contralateral side.
2.5. Real-time PCR
Real-time PCR was performed to examine the mRNA expression
of the M1 and M2 signature genes in the ischemic brain. Because
the ipsilateral striatum is the region in which repair is thought to
occur following MCAO, we harvested tissue from the ipsilateral
and contralateral striatum at 3, 7, 14 and 30 days after MCAO as
we have previously reported (Mao et al., 2013). Tissue samples
were snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 °C until
use. Total RNA was isolated from the tissue samples using Trizol
reagent (Takara, Shiga, Japan) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. First strand cDNAs were reverse transcribed from
1 lg total RNA with a High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). qPCR reactions were performed in triplicate on an ABI Prism 7500 sequence detection system using 50 ng
cDNA. The parameters for qPCR were as follows: incubation at
50 °C for 2 min, denaturing at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. The sequences of the PCR
primers for each gene were as follows: CD32 (forward primer:
50 -AATCCTGCCGTTCCTACTGATC-30 ; reverse primer: 50 -GTGTCACCGT
GTCTTCCTTGAG-30 ); IL-1b (forward primer: 50 -CAGGCTCCGAGATG
AACAAC-30 ; reverse primer: 50 -GGTGGAGAGCTTTCAGCTCATA-30 );
CD206 (forward primer: 50 -TCTTTGCCTTTCCCAGTCTCC-30 ; reverse
primer: 50 -TGACACCCAGCGGAATTTC-30 ); and arginase 1 (forward
primer: 50 -GAACACGGCAGTGGCTTTAAC-30 ; reverse primer: 50 -TG
CTTAGCTCTGTCTGCTTTGC-30 ). We also assayed the 18S RNA from
each sample using 5 ng of total cDNA. The ﬁnal results were
normalized to 18S RNA and are expressed as the ratios of the target
genes to 18S.
2.6. Immunohistochemistry
At 3 and 14 days after MCAO, the mice were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with saline, followed by ﬁxation
with buffered paraformaldehyde (4%). The brains were collected,
post-ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde and further treated with 30%
sucrose solution overnight. The brain blocks that surrounded the
ischemic lesion (+1.18 to 0.10 mm from bregma) were cut into
15-lm-thick coronal sections with a cryostat for single or double
immunoﬂuorescent staining. The sections were blocked with PBS
containing 3% BSA, 10% goat serum and 0.3% Triton-X100. Next,
the sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following
primary antibodies: rat-anti-CD16/32 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen,
CA, USA), goat-anti-CD206 (R&D Systems, MN, USA), rat-anti-CD31
(BD Biosciences Pharmingen, CA, USA), rabbit-anti-P-AMPK (Santa
Cruz, CA, USA), and goat anti-Iba1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). The
expressions of CD16/32, CD206, P-AMPK and Iba1 were ﬁnally detected with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For CD31 immunostaining, after probing
with the primary antibodies, the sections were incubated with a
biotin-labeled secondary donkey-anti-rat IgG antibody followed
by incubation with Cy2-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA, USA). To assess microvessel density, we also used lectin to stain the vascular structures
as previously described (Jiang et al., 2011). Brieﬂy, the sections

133

were directly incubated with ﬂuorescein-conjugated lectin (1:
200; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) overnight and then washed.
Quantiﬁcation of the immunostaining was performed as described in detail in our previous publication with slight modiﬁcations (Mao et al., 2013). Brieﬂy, 15-lm coronal sections were cut
from the brain blocks that were centered on the ischemic lesion
(+1.18 to 0.10 mm from bregma). Every 10th section was collected for quantiﬁcation, which resulted in a total of 6 sections.
Each section contained four pre-assigned ﬁelds in the striatal
penumbra that were adjacent to the ischemic core. The images
were digitized (Olympus IX51, Japan) using a CCD-color video system interfaced with the imaging analysis system (Image-Pro plus
6.0, Media Cybernetics, USA). The data are expressed as the
number of positive cells per unit area of analyzed tissue; i.e.,
cells/0.16 mm2.
2.7. Measurement of IL-10 and IL-4 with Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
To measure IL-4 and IL-10 in the ischemic brains, tissue samples
were collected from the ipsilateral and contralateral striatum and
the striatum of the sham-operated mice. Each tissue sample was
homogenized in 1 mL of RIPA buffer supplemented with a protease
inhibitor mixture (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The homogenates
were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. The protein concentrations of the supernatants were measured using a commercial BCA protein assay kit
(Tiangen, Beijing, China). IL-4 and IL-10 were measured with commercial ELISA kits (Boster Biosciences Co., Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Analyses were performed
using a Microplate Reader (Inﬁnite M200 PRO, Tecan, Switzerland).
2.8. Assessment of neurogenesis following MCAO
Neurogenesis was assessed by counting the newborn neurons
14 days after MCAO. To label the newborn neurons, metformin or
saline-treated mice received intraperitoneal injections of the thymidine analog BrdU (50 mg/kg) twice daily for 7 days beginning
24 h after MCAO. Fourteen days after MCAO, the mice were deeply
anesthetized and transcardially perfused ﬁrst with saline then with
by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were cut into 20-lm coronal
sections. For immunohistochemical assessment of the cells that
were double-labeled for BrdU and doublecortin (DCX, a speciﬁc
marker of newborn neurons), the sections were incubated with
1 N HCl for 30 min at 45 °C as an antigen retrieval step. Next, the
sections were sequentially blocked and probed with primary antibodies against BrdU (1:50; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and DCX
(1:300; Santa Cruz, CA, USA) followed by incubation with the corresponding secondary antibodies using the protocols described
above. For quantiﬁcation, the newborn neurons in the subventricular zones (SVZs) of six brain slices per animal were evaluated in a
blinded fashion (SVZ: +1.18 to 0.10 mm from bregma; the ﬁrst
slice was randomly selected). The cryostat sections were imaged
with a confocal microscope (Nikon TE2000, Tokyo, Japan). The cells
that were positive for BrdU+ and DCX+ (i.e., newborn neuroblasts)
were counted in the dorsolateral subventricular zone and the
lateral ventricle wall. The results are expressed as the number
of BrdU+ DCX+ cells per unit area of analyzed tissue; i.e., cells/
0.16 mm2.
2.9. Western blot
Western blot was performed to examine effects of metformin
on AMPK activation in the ischemic brains and in the LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. Brain tissue samples were harvested
from the ipsilateral and contralateral striatum at 3 and 14 days

134

Q. Jin et al. / Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 40 (2014) 131–142

after MCAO as previously described (Mao et al., 2013). The tissue
samples were snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at
80 °C until use. Each tissue sample was homogenized in 1 ml of
RIPA buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and a phosphatase inhibitor mixture
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The homogenates obtained from the
tissues were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the
supernatants were collected. The protein concentrations were
measured with a BCA protein assay kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China).
The protein samples (30 lg) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS gels
after denaturation and then transferred onto 0.45-lm nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk
in TBS and then probed with primary antibodies against AMPK
(1:1000) and phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK, 1:1000), which were
purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA, USA). After overnight
incubation at 4 °C, the membranes were washed three times with
PBS and probed with the following appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature: anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked antibody (1:2000), or anti-mouse IgG HRP-linked antibody (1:2000).
The protein bands were visualized with a Kodak imaging system
using a SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence kit (Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA). b-actin was used as a loading control. The optical densities of the protein bands were semi-quantiﬁed with Image
J software, and the ﬁnal results are expressed as the ratios of the
phosphorylated proteins to the total proteins.
2.10. BV2 cell culture and characterization of microglial polarization
in vitro
Murine microglial BV2 cells were used to characterize the
in vitro effects of metformin on microglial AMPK activation and
polarization. Additionally, we collected conditioned media from
the BV-2 cells and used a medium transfer approach to investigate
whether metformin promoted angiogenesis in a M2 polarizationdependent manner in vitro. The BV2 cells were cultured in DMEM
containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing air supplemented with 5% CO2. Conﬂuent cells were trypsinized and passaged twice a week. The effects of metformin on
AMPK activation in the BV2 cells were analyzed using western blot.
In brief, the BV2 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates overnight and
then treated with LPS (100 ng/ml) plus metformin (1 mM) or saline. At 0.5, 1, 2, 4, or 8 h after treatment, the BV2 cells were homogenized with RIPA buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor
mixture and a phosphatase inhibitor mixture. Western blot was
then performed as described earlier.
The polarization of the BV2 cells was characterized by assessing
the production of the M1 mediator nitric oxide (NO) and the M2
mediator IL-10. Microglial production of the M1 mediator NO, as
indicated by the accumulation of nitrite released into the culture
media, was measured 24 h after treatment with LPS (100 ng/mL,
Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) in the presence or absence of metformin
(1 mM). The culture supernatants were collected for nitrite measurement as previously described (Hu et al., 2007). Brieﬂy,
100 lL Griess reagent was mixed with 50 lL cell culture medium
in 96-well plates. Absorbance was measured at 520 nm with a
microplate reader (Inﬁnite M200 PRO, Tecan, Switzerland). Nitrite
concentrations were calculated from a standard curve.
To measure the IL-10 production of the BV2 cells, the culture
media were collected from the BV2 cells that were treated with
LPS (100 ng/ml) plus metformin (1 mM) or saline in the presence
or absence of the AMPK inhibitor compound C (5 lM) at 24 h after
LPS treatment. The same ELISA kit described above was used to
measure the IL-10 concentrations in the culture media. Because
LPS induced the proliferation of the BV2 cells, and this proliferation
was inhibited by metformin, we used 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to assess the

relative densities of the viable cells from each group. The ﬁnal
IL-10 concentrations in the culture media were normalized to the
densities of the viable cells as assessed with MTT.
2.11. In vitro angiogenesis
Microglial conditioned medium (DM) was collected from BV2
cells that were treated with LPS plus metformin or saline 24 h after
treatment. The media were also collected from the BV2 cells that
were not treated as control media. The pro-angiogenic effects of
the DMs were assayed as previously described (Zhang et al.,
2006). Brieﬂy, the brain microvascular endothelial bEend3 cells
(26,000 cells/well) were suspended in the above-mentioned DMs
and plated into 96-well plates that were pre-coated with Matrigel
(BD Biosciences Pharmingen, CA, USA). After 24 h of incubation, the
total numbers of the pro-angiogenic tube structures were quantiﬁed. The ﬁnal results are presented as the total number of proangiogenic structures/well.
2.12. Statistical analysis
The data are presented as the means ± the standard deviation
(SDs) with the exception of the neurological scores and the corner
test data, which are expressed as the medians ± the ranges.
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS16.0. Comparisons
between two groups were performed using Student’s t-tests.
Statistical comparisons between multiple groups were performed
using one-way ANOVAs with Tukey’s post hoc tests. The neurological scores and the corner test data were analyzed with
Mann–Whitney rank sum tests. The other behavioral data and
blood glucose levels were analyzed with repeated-measures
ANOVA. P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Post-stroke chronic metformin treatment improved functional
recovery following MCAO
Although acute metformin administration prior to stroke increases acute infarct damage (Li et al., 2010), the effects of poststroke chronic metformin treatment on the long-term functional
outcomes following stroke have not been investigated. To minimize the deleterious effects of metformin on acute infarct damage
and to mimic the clinically relevant therapeutic windows, we
administered metformin daily beginning 24 h after MCAO. We
found that delayed metformin treatment did not reduce acute
infarction 4 days after MCAO compared to saline treatment
(Fig. 1A). However, we observed that the cavitation of the infarcted
cortex was signiﬁcantly reduced in the metformin-treated mice
compared to the saline-treated mice 30 days after MCAO (Fig. 1B,
p < 0.05). We also monitored blood glucose levels over the 14 days
following MCAO. No signiﬁcant differences in blood glucose levels
between the metformin- and saline-treated mice were detected
(Supplemental Fig. 2).
Next, we investigated whether metformin promoted functional
recovery following stroke. mNSSs were assessed, and the corner
and rota-rod tests were performed to monitor the neurological deficits of the MCAO mice over a period of 30 days following MCAO.
The mNSS results revealed that the neurological deﬁcits of the
metformin- and saline-groups were equivalent at the initiation of
metformin treatment 24 h after MCAO (Fig. 1C). At 13, 27 and
29 days after MCAO, the metformin-treated mice displayed significantly lower mNSSs than did the saline-treated MCAO mice. The
corner test was performed to monitor post-MCAO sensorimotor
and postural asymmetries. Prior to MCAO, the mice performed

per group). (D) Metformin improved sensorimotor asymmetric abnormalities of MCAO mice in the corner test from 13 days after MCAO (n = 12 per group). (E) From 14 days
after MCAO, the time that metformin-treated mice remained on the rotarod was signiﬁcantly longer than the time that saline-treated mice did on the rotarod (n = 12 per
group). ⁄p < 0.05 compared to the saline (NS)-treated group.

approximately the same number of turns to either side. After
MCAO, the saline-treated mice exhibited a signiﬁcant increase in
the number of right turns during the experimental periods that
were conducted over the 30 days that followed MCAO. Compared
to saline, metformin signiﬁcantly improved the behavioral asymmetries of the MCAO mice in the corner test beginning 13 days
after MCAO (Fig. 1D). The metformin-treated mice also performed
better than the vehicle-treated mice in the rotarod test beginning
14 days after MCAO (Fig. 1E). Collectively, the behavioral data suggested that post-stroke chronic treatment with metformin signiﬁcantly promoted functional recovery.
3.2. Metformin treatment promoted the polarization of the microglia/
macrophages toward the M2 phenotype in the ischemic brain
The M1 or M2 polarizations of microglia/macrophages are commonly characterized by the expression of the signature genes that
are associated with the M1 or M2 phenotype. It has been reported
that MCAO signiﬁcantly increases the expression of M1 signature
genes in the ischemic brain beginning 3 days after MCAO and that
this increase lasts over 14 days after MCAO (Hu et al., 2012). Consistently, using the real-time PCR approach, we found that the
expression of the mRNAs of the M1 signature genes CD32 and
IL-1b was signiﬁcantly elevated in the ischemic striatum of the

saline-treated mice at 3, 7, 14 and 30 days after MCAO (Fig. 2A
and B). As shown in Fig. 2, compared to saline treatment, chronic
metformin treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the MCAO-induced
expression of CD32 and IL-1b mRNA over the 30 days following
MCAO (with the exception of IL-1b 30 days after MCAO). The M1
marker CD32 has been shown to be dominantly expressed by
microglia/macrophages in the ischemic brain following MCAO
(Hu et al., 2012). Using double immunoﬂuorescent staining, we
conﬁrmed these published results; regardless of the treatment,
the expression of CD16/32 was predominantly co-localized with the
microglial marker Iba1, and very few non-Iba1+ cells that expressed
CD16/32 were present in the ischemic striatum (Fig. 2F). Using
immunohistochemistry, we further showed that the ischemiainduced increase in CD16/32 protein expression was signiﬁcantly
attenuated by metformin treatment (Fig. 2D and E).
We further assessed the effects of metformin on the expression
of M2 signature genes. In the ischemic striatum of the saline (NS)treated mice, the mRNAs of the M2 genes CD206 and arginase 1
were most robustly but transiently inducted 3 days after MCAO
relative to the mRNA levels of these two genes at 7, 14 and 30 days
after MCAO (Fig. 3A and B, p < 0.05). These results suggest an early
and transient induction of the M2 phenotype in the ischemic brain,
which is consistent with a previous publication (Hu et al., 2012). In
the metformin-treated mice, we also observed robust and transient

increases in arginase 1 and CD 206 mRNAs at 3 days compared to 7,
14 and 30 days following MCAO (p < 0.05). Remarkably, the expressions of CD206 and arginase 1 were persistently elevated in the
metformin-treated mice compared to the saline-treated mice over
the 30 days following MCAO.
Because the M2 marker CD206 has been shown to be predominantly expressed by microglia/macrophages in the ischemic
brains following cerebral ischemia (Hu et al., 2012), we further performed immunohistochemistry and conﬁrmed that metformin enhanced the expression of CD206 protein in the ischemic brain
compared to saline at both 3 and 14 days after MCAO (Fig. 3C).
IL-4 and IL-10 are additional M2 markers that are considered to
be important mediators of the M2 polarization of microglia/

macrophages. Similar to results obtained for CD206 and arginase
1, chronic metformin treatment signiﬁcantly increased the production of IL-4 14 days after MCAO and increased IL-10 production at 3
and 14 days after MCAO in the ischemic brains (Fig. 3D). Collectively, these results suggest that post-stroke chronic metformin
treatment promoted and sustained the M2 polarization of the
microglia/macrophages of the ischemic brains.
3.3. Metformin increased microglial AMPK activation following MCAO
Because AMPK activation has been suggested to be an
important signaling pathway in the promotion of microglia/macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype (Sag et al., 2008), we

138

Q. Jin et al. / Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 40 (2014) 131–142

examined whether metformin activated microglial AMPK in the
ischemic brain. Western blot results revealed that cerebral AMPK
activation was signiﬁcantly elevated by metformin following
MCAO as evidenced by the enhanced levels of phosphorylated
(Thr-172) AMPKa in the metformin-treated brains compared to
the saline-treated brains at 3 and 14 days following MCAO
(Fig. 4A and B). Immunoﬂuorescent double staining further conﬁrmed that the co-localization of phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK)
with the speciﬁc marker (Iba1) of microglia/macrophages was increased in the ischemic striatum of the metformin-treated mice
compared to those of the saline-treated mice 4 days after MCAO
(Fig. 4C). Additionally, we found that a large proportion of the
CD206+ cells also co-localized with p-AMPK in the ischemic striatum
of the metformin-treated mice (Supplemental Fig. 3). Collectively, the
results suggest that chronic metformin treatment increased AMPK
activation in microglia/macrophages in the ischemic brains.

3.4. Post-stroke chronic metformin treatment enhanced angiogenesis
and neurogenesis in the ischemic brain
Because M2-polarized microglia/macrophages promote tissue
repair following injury, we investigated whether metformin treatment enhanced post-MCAO angiogenesis. Vessel densities were assessed indirectly by quantifying the numbers of cells expressing
the endothelial marker CD31 in the ischemic striatum. A signiﬁcant

increase in CD31+ cells was detected in the metformin-treated
mice compared to the vehicle-treated mice 14 days after MCAO
(Fig. 5A). We also used lectin to stain the vascular structures. Consistent with the CD31 immunostaining results, there was also a signiﬁcant increase in lectin-stained vascular structures in the
metformin-treated mice compared to the saline-treated mice
(Fig. 5B). Taken together, these results suggest that metformin enhanced vascular density during the recovery phase following
stroke.
We further assessed post-ischemic neurogenesis within the
subventricular zone (SVZ) and the lateral ventricular wall. Compared to the saline-treated mice, the metformin-treated mice displayed signiﬁcantly greater numbers of BrdU-positive cells that
co-expressed the immature neuronal marker DCX in the ischemic
SVZ and the lateral ventricle wall 14 days after MCAO (Fig. 6),
which suggests that post-stroke chronic metformin treatment enhanced neurogenesis following MCAO.

3.5. Metformin promoted angiogenesis in vitro in an M2 polarizationdependent manner
Finally, we used an in vitro approach to test the hypothesis that
metformin promotes angiogenesis in an M2 polarization-dependent manner. Metformin dose-dependently suppressed the
LPS-stimulated production of the pro-inﬂammatory mediator NO

from the BV2 microglial cells (Fig. 7A). The LPS-induced inhibition
of AMPK activation (i.e., phosphorylation) is a major mechanism
underlying the LPS-induced M1 polarization of macrophages (Sag
et al., 2008). As expected, we found that LPS decreased AMPK phosphorylation (activation) in the BV2 microglial cells. Metformin at
1 mM abolished the LPS-induced reduction in AMPK activation
and signiﬁcantly enhanced the production of the M2 mediator IL10 in the LPS-treated BV2 cells. The enhancement of the production
of IL-10 by metformin was markedly attenuated by the speciﬁc
AMPK inhibitor compound C (Fig. 7C). Taken together, these results
suggest that metformin acted through AMPK activation to promote
microglial M2 polarization. Furthermore, the in vitro angiogenesis
assay revealed that the conditioned media collected from BV2 cells
that were co-treated with metformin and LPS promoted the formation of pro-angiogenic structures in the bEend 3 cells. In contrast,
the conditioned media collected from the BV2 cells that were treated with LPS or metformin alone and the control media collected
from the non-treated BV2 cells did not promote tube formation
in the bEnd3 cells in vitro; the direct addition of metformin to
the control media also failed to promote tube formation (Fig. 7D
and E). These results suggest that metformin promoted angiogenesis through the microglia in an M2 polarization-dependent
manner.

4. Discussion
The present study demonstrated that post-stroke chronic treatment with metformin, a well-known AMPK activator and a widely
used anti-diabetic drug, promoted functional recovery following
experimental stroke. We further provided evidence suggesting that
metformin-enhanced M2 polarization of microglia/macrophages
and tissue repair may contribute to the beneﬁcial effects of metformin therapy on stroke outcomes. Our data also indicate that, rather
than globally suppressing the activation of microglia/macrophages,
the modulation of the polarization of the microglia/macrophages
may be an attractive novel strategy for stroke treatment.
Metformin is widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
Clinically, chronic treatment with metformin for diabetes is
associated with a reduced risk of stroke and reduced stroke
severity, and these effects are independent of the glucose-lowering
effect of metformin (Selvin and Hirsch, 2008; Anon., 1998). However,

the available studies of experimental stroke indicate that metformin
treatment is either deleterious or beneﬁcial seemingly dependent on
when metformin treatment is initiated and the duration of metformin administration (Li et al., 2010; Manwani and McCullough,
2013). Obviously, there is a lack of support from experimental studies
for these clinical observations.
To mimic the delayed treatment timeframe that is clinically relevant to stroke therapies, we administered metformin daily beginning 24 h after MCAO. Using this paradigm of delayed
administration, we found that metformin had no impact on infarct
volumes during the acute phase but signiﬁcantly improved the
functional outcomes during the recovery phase following MCAO.
The improved behavioral outcomes of the metformin-treated mice
during the recovery phase were associated with improved histological outcomes 30 days after MCAO as evidenced by reduced cavitation of the infarcted cortices. Enhanced tissue repair, including
angiogenesis, has been shown to be responsible for reduced cortical cavitation during the recovery phase following stroke (Zhao
et al., 2006). Indeed, we also observed that metformin enhanced
angiogenesis and neurogenesis during the recovery phase following MCAO. Taken together, our results indicate that the beneﬁcial
effects of metformin on long-term stroke outcomes can be attributed, at least in part, to enhanced tissue repair.
AMPK is expressed in several types of brain cells, including neurons, astrocytes and microglia (Manwani and McCullough, 2013).
Speciﬁcally, AMPK activation has been shown to be a key molecular switch that promotes the alternative activation (M2) of microglia/macrophages (Sag et al., 2008; O’Neill and Hardie, 2013).
Accumulating evidence suggests that M2-polarized microglia/macrophages resolve the over-activation of inﬂammation and promote
tissue repair following peripheral or CNS injuries (Mantovani et al.,
2013; Kigerl et al., 2009). However, whether metformin exerts beneﬁcial effects on stroke outcomes through an M2 polarizationdependent mechanism has not been investigated. We investigated
whether post-stroke chronic metformin treatment promoted the
M2 polarization of microglia/macrophages in the ischemic brain.
We assessed the cerebral polarization of the microglia/macrophages by analyzing the expression of signature genes associated
with M1 or M2 polarization in the ischemic brain as previously reported (Hu et al., 2012; Kigerl et al., 2009). In agreement with a recent report (Hu et al., 2012), we observed a transient increase in
M2 gene expression and a persistent increase in M1 signature gene

expression in the ischemic brain. Consistent with our hypothesis,
post-stroke metformin treatment resulted in long-term elevation
of M2 and suppression of M1 signature gene expression. Our data
clearly indicated that post-stroke chronic metformin treatment
promoted the M2 polarization of microglia/macrophages in the
ischemic brain. Furthermore, metformin-enhanced M2 polarization of microglia/macrophages was associated with the activation
of AMPK in the ischemic brain. Notably, pre-stroke chronic metformin treatment has been reported to decrease AMPK activation (Li
et al., 2010). The mechanisms underlying the differential effects
of metformin on AMPK activation remain to be investigated.
M2 polarized microglia/macrophages not only reduce the acute
neuronal death induced by ischemic insults (Hu et al., 2012) but
also promote neural repair (Kigerl et al., 2009). We found that metformin improved long-term functional recovery in post-stroke
mice. Moreover, post-stroke metformin treatment remarkably increased angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the ischemic brain. Thus,
it is likely that metformin improved long-term stroke outcomes via
a microglia/macrophage polarization mechanism. To further
establish a causal link between the metformin-enhanced M2

polarization of microglia and tissue repair, we used an in vitro
angiogenesis model to investigate whether metformin promoted
angiogenesis in an M2-dependent manner because it is difﬁcult
to perform such studies in vivo. The transfer of conditioned media
from the metformin-polarized microglia to the brain endothelial
cells resulted in a remarkable promotion of angiogenesis, while directly treating endothelial cells with metformin did not induce
angiogenesis. These data suggest that polarizing the microglia/
macrophages to the M2 phenotype was critical to metformin’s effects of promoting angiogenesis, which, in turn, contributed to the
functional recovery conferred by metformin.
Mounting evidence suggests a dual role of microglia/macrophages in post-ischemic injury and recovery that is related to the
functional phenotypes of the microglia/macrophages (LalancetteHebert et al., 2007; Faustino et al., 2011; Ekdahl et al., 2003). Broad
inhibition of microglia/macrophages might block the protective
and recovery-promoting functions of M2-polarized microglia/macrophages in the brain. Our study provides the ﬁrst piece of evidence that the modulation of microglia/macrophage polarization,
as opposed to the broad suppression of microglia/macrophages,

may represent a novel strategy for stroke therapy. Because such an
M2–M1 shift has also been reported for other CNS disease
models, such as spinal cord injury (Kigerl et al., 2009), we speculate
that the modulation of microglia/macrophage polarization by
metformin may be of therapeutic signiﬁcance following various
CNS injuries.
In this study, the mortality rate of the saline-treated mice was
after the 30 days following MCAO was 48%, which is comparable
to the published results (Prass et al., 2003). Metformin increased
survival rates at 14 and 30 days following MCAO, but this tread
was not statistically signiﬁcant (Supplemental Fig. 1). Furthermore
and consistent with the published results, most of the mice,
regardless of treatment, died between 3 and 7 days after MCAO.
Notably, the major cause of mouse death following MCAO during
this period was bacterial infection of the lungs and not brain
damage (Prass et al., 2003). Moreover, we showed that metformin
treatment had no effect on acute infarction 4 days after
MCAO. Based on these ﬁndings, we believe that survival bias did
not compromise our conclusion that metformin beneﬁcially
effected long-term stroke outcomes by promoting post-stroke
tissue repair.
This study has a major limitation. To prove the concept that M2polarized microglia promoted angiogenesis in vitro, we used the
BV2 microglial cell line. Additionally, LPS rather than oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) was used to induce M1 polarization of
the microglia because the stimulation of BV2 cells with LPS is a
well-deﬁned M1 polarization model for microglial cells (Zhang
et al., 2013). Although we recognize that it would have been better
to perform this proof-of-concept study using OGD-treated primary
microglia, OGD has not been clearly acknowledged as a stimulus
that induces the M1 polarization of microglia, although
in vivo ischemic insults have been shown to induce transient M2

polarization followed by long-term M1 polarization of microglia/
macrophages in the ischemic brain (Hu et al., 2012). Thus, further
work is needed to characterize the effects of OGD on the polarization of primary microglia, these experiments should be repeated
using OGD-treated primary microglia.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that post-ischemic chronic
metformin treatment enhanced the post-ischemic M2 polarization
of microglia/macrophages in the ischemic brain and improved
long-term functional recovery following MCAO. Our results suggest that pushing the functional phenotypes of microglia/macrophages to skew toward M2 polarization via post-stroke AMPK
activation is a novel therapeutic strategy for stroke.
