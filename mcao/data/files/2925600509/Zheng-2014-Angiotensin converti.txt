SUMMARY
Background: The angiotensin (Ang) converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor pathway is an important component of the renin–angiotensin system and has been suggested to exert beneficial effects in ischemic stroke. Aims: This study explored whether the
ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway has a protective effect on cerebral ischemic injury and
whether this effect is affected by age. Methods: We used three-month and eight-month
transgenic mice with neural over-expression of ACE2 (SA) and their age-matched nontransgenic (NT) controls. Neurological deficits and ischemic stroke volume were determined
following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In oxygen and glucose deprivation
(OGD) experiments on brain slices, the effects of the Mas receptor agonist (Ang1-7) or
antagonist (A779) on tissue swelling, Nox2/Nox4 expression reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production and cell death were measured. Results: (1) Middle cerebral artery occlusion
-induced ischemic injury and neurological deficit were reduced in SA mice, especially in
eight-month animals; (2) OGD-induced tissue swelling and cell death were decreased in SA
mice with a greater reduction seen in eight-month mice; (3) Ang-(1–7) and A779 had opposite effects on OGD-induced responses, which correlated with changes in Nox2/Nox4
expression and ROS production. Conclusions: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2/Ang(1-7)/Mas axis protects brain from ischemic injury via the Nox/ROS signaling pathway,
with a greater effect in older animals.

Introduction
Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death, and the number one
cause of disability in the world. Its prevention and treatment
remains one of the most challenging public health problems Clinical and experimental studies suggest that the angiotensin (Ang)
converting enzyme (ACE)/Ang II/AT1 receptor (AT1R) pathway
of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) participates in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke [1]. In addition, aging is well known
as one of the risk factors for stroke [2,3]. There is emerging
evidence to suggest that the Ang II/AT1R pathway plays an important role in age-related vascular dysfunction [4]. The ACE2/Ang-

(1-7)/Mas axis, a component of the RAS first described [5–7] is
widely distributed in the brain including cells of the cerebral vasculature, neurons, and glia and exerts its protective effect by
counteracting the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis [8]. Accumulating evidence indicates that both of these RAS signaling pathways participate in the regulation of cerebrovascular blood flow, blood
pressure, and neuroendocrine function [9,10]. Furthermore, a
recent report showed that intracerebroventricular injection of
Ang-(1–7) had beneficial effects on ischemic stroke [11].
Although the role of the ACE/Ang II/AT1 axis has been well
detailed, the complex role of brain ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway
in ischemic stroke remains poorly understood.

Transgenic and knockout mouse models have been developed
for exploring the role of the RAS in controlling cerebrovascular
function [5,8,12,13]. It has also been shown by others [14] and us
[15] that ischemia-induced brain damage is exaggerated in human
renin and angiotensinogen double-transgenic mice. Using an
ACE2 knockout mouse model, a recent study reported that ACE2
deficiency impairs endothelium-dependent dilatory function in
cerebral arteries and augments age-related endothelial dysfunction via oxidative stress [16].
Oxidative stress is a condition of increased production of
reactive oxygen species (ROS). The NOX family of NADPH oxidases has been shown to induce ROS production in cells of
the brain including microglia, neurons, astrocytes, and the
various cellular components of the neurovascular system [17].
Recent evidence demonstrates that NOX2 and Nox4 appear to
be major sources of pathological oxidative stress in the brain
such as stroke [14]. It has been well established that AngII
stimulates NADPH oxidases-mediated ROS production in the
brain [18]. We hypothesized that by transforming Ang II into
Ang-(1-7). ACE2 might reduce AngII-mediated oxidative stress
in the brain and protect brain from ischemic injury. However,
the role and mechanism of brain ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway during ischemic injury also deserves more in-depth investigation.
In this study, three-month and eight-month-old transgenic
mice were used. We examined the role of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)
pathway on brain ischemic injury and its relation with age
in these transgenic animals. First, we determined the pathological and behavioral severity of focal ischemic damage induced
by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice with
neuronal over-expression of ACE2 (SA) and their age-match
controls (NT). Next, to exclude the effects of hemodynamic
factors, we conducted studies on brain slices exposed to oxygenglucose deprivation (OGD) coupled with pharmacological
activation or blockade of Mas receptors. The underlying
mechanism was explored by analyzing Nox expression and ROS
production.

Effect of ACE2/Ang-(1-7) on Ischemic Stroke Injury

Animals
All animal procedures were approved by the Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee of Wright State University and
conformed to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Transgenic mice with
ACE2 over-expression in neurons (SA) and their controls (NT)
were bred in our laboratory using founders provided by
Dr. Eric Lazartigues (Louisiana State University, New Orleans,
LA, USA) [15]. Animals were maintained on a 12 h light/dark
cycle and provided access to food and water ad libitum.
Three-month and eight-month-old mice (male and female)
were used for the study.

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Surgery,
Evaluation of Neurological Deficits and Infarct
Volume
Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery
was performed in mice anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane
inhalation, as previously described [19]. Evaluation of neurological deficits was carried out 24 h after MCAO surgery
according to a previously described five-level scoring method
[15]. The scores ranged from 0 to 4 with the following definitions: 0, no observable neurological deficits; 1, failure to
extend right forepaw; 2, circling to the right; 3, falling to the
right; and 4, cannot walk spontaneously. The extent of ischemic infarction was evaluated 48 h after MCAO by staining
brain sections with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(Sigma), followed by analysis with NIH Image J software. The
area of infarction was measured in each section by subtracting
the stained area on the lesioned ipsilateral hemisphere from
the total area of the nonlesioned contralateral hemisphere. The
volume of infarction was calculated by summing the area of
infarct [mm2] 9 thickness [1 mm] over all sections [15]. The
person performing the neurological deficit evaluation and measurement of infarct volume was unaware of animal group
information.

Oxygen and Glucose Deprivation on Brain Slices
OGD experiments on brain slices were performed as previously
described [15]. Brains were rapidly dissected from the cranium,
mounted on a block of agar with cyanoacrylate cement, and
sectioned in a coronal plane into 400 lm-thick slices using a
Vibratome Section System (Series 1000). Brain slices were
incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) bubbled with
95% O2 plus 5% CO2 at room temperature for 1–2 h. After
incubation, slices were transferred to an interface-type recording stage (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA) and initially
perfused for baseline recording with aCSF at 35°C for 30 min
under the same atmosphere. Then, the slices were exposed to
control or OGD treatment for 30 min. In experiments that
evaluated the role of the Ang-(1–7)/Mas pathway, the Mas
agonist Ang-(1–7) (10 lM) or the Mas antagonist A779 (10 lM)
was added into the perfusing solution at the start of OGD
exposure [20,21].

Assessment of Brain Swelling
As we previously described [15], tissue swelling was determined
indirectly by measuring the intrinsic optical signal (IOS). Regions
of interest were defined in stratum radiatum of the hippocampal
CA1 area and in an equivalent area in the center of the adjacent
cerebral cortex. The average light intensities in these areas were
calculated and normalized to the average intensity measured in
the same region immediately prior to the start of OGD exposure.
IOS is expressed as the percent change in light intensity relative to
this initial measurement.

superior to this area were captured under epifluorescence illumination (Leica, HBO 100). Three regions of interest were defined at
the level of CA1 and cortex in each coronal section (n = 7/group).
The intensity of red fluorescence was semiquantitatively analyzed
using NIH ImageJ software, and the average intensity in these
areas was calculated. The values measured in slices exposed to
OGD then were normalized to the average intensity measured in
the same region in control slices and the data for slices exposed to
OGD expressed as the percent difference in red fluorescence
intensity relative to these control measurement.

Data Analysis
Evaluation of Cell Death
Cell death in brain slices was determined using propidium iodide
(PI) staining [15]. Following the 30-min treatment with control or
OGD, slices were incubated in aCSF with 20 lg/mL PI at room
temperature for 15 min and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. PI-positive cells were visualized using a laser confocal
microscope (TCS SP2; Leica, Exton, PA, USA).

Western Blot Analysis
Following the 30-min treatment with control or OGD, slices
were quickly removed from the perfusion chamber and homogenized on ice in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and
EDTA. Total protein content of the solution was determined
using the Bradford protein assay. Equal amounts (50 lg) of protein were re-loaded into lanes of a 12% precast gel, separated
by electrophoresis and then electrotransferred onto a PVDF
membrane. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry
milk and were probed with primary monoclonal mouse antimouse b-actin (1:4000), polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse Nox2
(1:1000), or polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse Nox4 (1:500) overnight at 4°C. Membranes then were washed and incubated with
HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:40,000). Blots were
probed using enhanced chemiluminescence and visualized using
a Fuji film image analyzer (Molecular Dynamics Image Quant,
Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Nox2, and Nox4 bands were visualized
at an apparent molecular weight of 65 kDa and 67 kDa,
respectively.

Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species
Production
Dihydroethidium (DHE) was used to evaluate the generation of
ROS products in slices exposed to control conditions or OGD. After
the initial 30 min perfusion with control aCSF at 35°C, slices were
perfused with 10 lM DHE for 30 min in control conditions or during OGD. During DHE treatment, the light source illuminating the
slice and other room lights were turned off. After this treatment,
slices were fixed for at least 1 h with 4% paraformaldehyde in
staining buffer consisting of 137 mM NaCl plus 10 mM Na2HPO4
(pH 7.4). They then were washed for 20 min with staining buffer
and mounted on glass slides under coverslips using Fluoro-Gel
aqueous mounting medium (Electron Microscopy Services, Hatfield, PA, USA). Photographs of the pyramidal cell layer in the
middle of the CA1 region and cerebral cortex immediately

Continuous data are shown as the mean  SEM. Data were analyzed using one- or two-way ANOVA, as appropriate. For comparison between experimental groups, Student’s paired or unpaired
t-test was used. Changes in neurological deficit scores were
expressed as median (range) and analyzed using the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-test. For all tests, P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Results
Neuronal Over-expression of ACE2 Reduces
MCAO-induced Cerebral Injury with a Greater
Effect in Eight-month-Old Mice
Using MCAO surgery to induce focal ischemic stroke in both NT
and SA mice, we found that SA mice had lower neurological deficit scores measured at 24 h and less ischemic stroke volume 48 h
after surgery (Figure 1A–C). The protective effect of ACE2 on
ischemic stroke volume was greater in eight-month-old mice
(Figure 1A,B).

Neuronal Over-expression of ACE2 Reduces
OGD-induced Brain Tissue Swelling with a
Greater Effect in Eight-month-Old Mice
To determine blood flow- and pressure-independent effects of
ACE2 on cerebral ischemic injury, in vitro OGD experiments on
brain slices were conducted. Figure 2A illustrates IOS in cerebral
cortex and hippocampal areas as an index of OGD-induced tissue
swelling [15]. We found that the IOS of brain slices from SA mice
was significantly lower in both three-month-old and eightmonth-old mice (Figure 2B). In addition, for slices from SA mice,
but not NT mice, the IOS values in CA1 and cortex areas of were
less at eight-months of age compared with those measured in
three-month-old mice (Figure 2B).

IOS in slices from NT mice at both three-months and eightmonths of age, the change due to Ang-(1–7) treatment was
greater in the eight-month-old group (Figure 2C). For SA mice,
blockade of Mas receptors by A779 increased the magnitude of
IOS response in both three-month-old and eight-month-old mice
(Figure 2D).

The ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas Pathway Reduces OGDinduced Cell Death in the Brains of SA mice with
a Greater Effect in Eight-month-Old Animals
OGD-induced cell death both in cerebral cortex and the CA1
region of the hippocampus. OGD-induced cell death was much

reduced in SA mice compared with that observed in NT mice. We
found that the difference between SA mice and NT mice was more
pronounced in eight-month-old mice than that was observed in
three-month-old mice (Figure 3A,B).
Ang-(1–7) treatment during OGD significantly decreased the
number of PI-positive cells in both brain regions of threemonth-old and eight-month-old NT animals. As with ACE2
over-expression, the effect of Ang-(1–7) was more apparent in
eight-month-old, as compared with three-month-old mice
(Figure 3C). In addition, blockade of Ang-(1-7)/Mas signaling
by A779 in SA mice increased the numbers of PI-positive cells
in both brain regions of three-month-old and eight-month-old
animals (Figure 3D).

The ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas Pathway Inhibits the
Up-regulation of Brain Nox2 and Nox4
expression following OGD with Greater Effects
seen in Eight-month-Old Mice
Neuronal over-expression of ACE2 in SA mice did not change the
basal expression of Nox2 and Nox4. In addition, for both animal
genotypes, OGD caused an up-regulation of Nox2 and Nox4
expression in brain tissue of both three-month-old and eightmonth-old mice. However, levels of Nox2 and Nox4 expression in
slices from SA mice following OGD exposure were significantly

lower for both three-month-old and eight-month-old animals.
This difference in Nox expression between NT and SA animals was
greater in eight-month-old mice (Figure 4A–C).
In separate experiments, Ang-(1–7) was added to brain slices
from NT animals during OGD exposure. With Ang-(1–7) treatment during OGD, the increase in expression of Nox2 and Nox4
was smaller at both three-months and eight-months of age. A
greater effect of Ang-(1–7) was seen in eight-month-old NT mice
compared with three-month-old animals (Figure 5). In contrast,
when the Mas receptor antagonist A779 was applied to brain slices
from SA animals during OGD expose, the increase in both Nox2

and Nox4 expression was greater than that observed in the
absence of added drug. This effect of A779 was significantly greater
in eight-month-old SA mice compared with three-month-old animals (Figure 5). These data suggest that the control of Ang-(1–7)/

important in the middle-aged animals than that in young animals.

ROS production was measured by DHE staining. The DHE fluorescence intensity was greater following OGD treatment for both animal genotypes. This increase was smaller in slices from SA animals
than in slices from NT animals. In addition, the difference in DHE
fluorescence intensity between SA and NT animals was greater for
eight-month-old animals compared with three-month-old animals (Figure 6A–C). For SA mice, A779 increased the magnitude
of ROS production in both brain regions of three-month-old and
eight-month-old animals. This effect of A779 in slices from SA
mice was greater in eight-month-old mice (Figure 6D).

Discussion
The ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas axis has been demonstrated to be a
functional arm of the RAS that can counteract deleterious effects
of the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis [8,22]. Mas receptor activation has
various physiological functions such as regulating blood pressure
[23], attenuating the progress of atherosclerosis through inhibiting vascular smooth muscle-cell proliferation and restoring
endothelial function [8,24]. The protective role of the ACE2/Ang(1–7)/Mas axis in cardiovascular [25,26] and cerebrovascular
[11,27] diseases has gained much attention in recent years. Activation of Ang-(1–7)/Mas signaling attenuates the development of
hypertension [28] and the pathologic progress of atherosclerosis
[29]. However, there is limited information on the role of brain
ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis in ischemic stroke.
In this study, we found that neuronal over-expression of ACE2
protects the brain from ischemic injury. This is evidenced by lower
neurological deficit scores and smaller stroke volumes following
MCAO-induced stroke in SA mice. Our results are supported by
recent studies showing that intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion
of Ang-(1–7) or an ACE2 activatorreduces ischemic injury in rats
mediated by a reduction in cerebral blood flow [11,27]. Central
administration of Ang-(1–7) was shown to exert a neuroprotective
effect on ischemic injury by inhibiting the NF-kappaB inflammation pathway [27]. To address blood pressure/flow-independent
effects of the brain ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway on ischemic
stroke, we measured OGD-induced swelling and cell death in
brain tissue by using methods we previously established [15]. We
found that brain tissue from SA mice displayed less swelling and
cell death in response to OGD. We further observed that application of Ang-(1–7) reduces OGD-induced tissue swelling and cell
death in NT mice. In contrast, blockade of Mas receptor in SA mice
with A779 has opposite impacts. Thus, our data provide the first
evidence that activation of ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas pathway can
exert a direct neuroprotective action by alleviating ischemiainduced cell swelling and cell death.
Aging is known as one of the risk factors for cerebrovascular diseases associated with cerebrovascular dysregulation [2–4,30,31].
It is suggested that the Ang II/AT1R pathway contributes to dysfunction [4], However, the age-dependent role and mechanism of
the brain ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway for stroke is unclear.
Unexpectedly, our in vivo and in vitro data did not show significant
differences in MCAO-induced or OGD-induced brain injury
between three-month and eight-month NT mice. These results are
different from previous reports showing acute functional outcomes are worse with aging [32–34]. Those studies showed that
advanced-age (15–24 month) increases the inflammatory

response [32] and oxidative damage [33] and exacerbates cerebromicrovascular injury and autoregulatory dysfunction [34].
Although our eight-month-old NT animals had similar infarction
volumes and neurological deficits as the three-month-old mice,
the SA littermates at both ages showed reduced brain injury. We
found that the protective effect of ACE2 in the SA mice is greater
for the eight-month-old animals. This is evidenced by reduced
infarct volume following MCAO surgery, and reduced brain slice
swelling and cell death following OGD-induced injury in eightmonth-old SA mice compared with three-month-old SA mice.
Our observations seem to be in accord with a recent report showing that ACE2 deficiency augments endothelial dysfunction during aging despite no significant change of ACE2 expression in
aged brain [16]. Using mice with ages comparable to ours, Miyamoto et al. [35] recently showed an age-related decline in cyclic
AMP response element-binding protein mediated oligodendrogenesis. Our conclusions are also indirectly supported by recent
reports showing that Ang II-induced cerebromicrovascular injury
and neuroinflammation are exacerbated by aging [33] and that
the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway is critical for vasodepressor
activity in aorta of aged rats [36]. A study also showed that ACE2
deficiency is associated with the age-dependent increase in BP
and autonomic dysfunction [18].
To explore the possible mechanisms underlying the protective effect of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas pathway on ischemic
stroke and the influence of aging, we measured NADPH oxidase expression and ROS production. Nox2 and Nox4 were significantly up-regulated in response to OGD. However, these
responses were reduced in SA mice. In addition, application of
Ang-(1–7) to NT animals or A779 to SA animals for activation
or blockade respectively of the Mas receptor had reciprocal
effects on Nox2 and Nox4 expression. These data suggest the
ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas pathway is involved in the control of
NADPH oxidase expression. Furthermore, the Nox expression
data were well correlated with levels of ROS production. These
findings are in agreement with previous studies showing ACE2
over-expression prevents an Ang II-induced increase in ROS
production and NADPH oxidase expression in endothelia [24].
In addition, ACE2 inhibition enhances Ang II-stimulated ROS
formation [37]. We also found that neuronal ACE2 overexpression reduced Nox2/Nox4 expression and ROS production
to a greater extent in eight-month-old mice compared with
that seen in three-month-old mice. The presence of this mechanism is also indirectly supported by previous reports showing
that aging impairs eNOS-dependent reactivity of cerebral arterioles via an increase in superoxide produced by activation of
NADPH oxidase [2,3].
In addition to Nox2 and Nox4, eNOS may play a role in the
RAS-induced oxidative stress seen during exposure to ODG. A
previous study indicates that Ang-(1–7) stimulates NO release and
upregulates eNOS expression in ischemic tissues following stroke
in rats [38]. A recent report showed that the cerebroprotective
properties of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas axis [11]. Nox4-derived
hydrogen peroxide enhances eNOS activity and NO signaling
[39]. On the other hand, Nox4 may act as a potent stimulus for
eNOS-derived superoxide production which initiates eNOS dysfunction and decrease in NO levels in cells treated with Ang II
[39]. Nox1 and Nox2 have been linked to eNOS uncoupling in vas-

cular pathology [40,41]. Whether the changes of Nox2 and Nox4
in this study might be related to NO and eNOS deserves further
investigation.
In summary, this study provides the first evidence that activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis produces a direct protective
effect during cerebral ischemic injury by alleviating cell swelling
and cell death via decreased Nox expression and resulting lower
ROS production. In addition, the protective effect of Ang-(1-7)/
Mas activation on ischemic injury in the brain shows an agedependent trend. Therefore, the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis holds
a great potential for the development of new targets in the
management of ischemic stroke.
