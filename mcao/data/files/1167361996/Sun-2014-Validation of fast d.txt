imaging acute ischemia in a rodent model of
stroke

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) captures ischemic tissue that is likely to infarct, and has become one of the most
widely used acute stroke imaging techniques. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) has lately been postulated as a
complementary MRI method to stratify the heterogeneously damaged DWI lesion. However, the conventional DKI
acquisition time is relatively long, limiting its use in the acute stroke setting. Recently, a fast kurtosis mapping method
has been demonstrated in ﬁxed brains and control subjects. The fast DKI approach provides mean diffusion and kurtosis
measurements under substantially reduced scan time, making it amenable to acute stroke imaging. Because it is not
practical to obtain and compare different means of DKI to test whether the fast DKI method can reliably detect diffusion
and kurtosis lesions in acute stroke patients, our study investigated its diagnostic value using an animal model of acute
stroke, a critical step before fast DKI acquisition can be routinely applied in the acute stroke setting. We found signiﬁcant correlation, per voxel, between the diffusion and kurtosis coefﬁcients measured using the fast and conventional
DKI protocols. In acute stroke rats, the two DKI methods yielded diffusion and kurtosis lesions that were in good
agreement. Importantly, substantial kurtosis–diffusion lesion mismatch was observed using the conventional
(26 ± 13%, P < 0.01) and fast DKI methods (23 ± 8%, P < 0.01). In addition, regression analysis showed that the
kurtosis–diffusion lesion mismatches obtained using conventional and fast DKI methods were substantially
correlated (R2 = 0.57, P = 0.02). Our results conﬁrmed that the recently proposed fast DKI method is capable of capturing
heterogeneous diffusion and kurtosis lesions in acute ischemic stroke, and thus is suitable for translational applications
in the acute stroke clinical setting. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), which captures acute ischemic
tissue that is likely to infarct, has become one of the most widely
used techniques for acute stroke imaging (1–6). Studies have shown
that early DWI deﬁcit can be partially salvaged with prompt treatment, consistent with the ﬁndings that metabolic disruption within
the DWI lesion is heterogeneous (6–11). However, the graded
ischemic tissue injury could not be reliably segmented using the percentage reduction of mean diffusivity. There is no well-established
imaging method that provides adequate spatiotemporal resolution
for the stratiﬁcation of heterogeneous DWI lesions (12,13). A complementary MRI technique is therefore needed to reﬁne the widely
used stroke DWI technique. To this end, diffusion kurtosis, an index
that measures non-Gaussian diffusion of water molecules, has been
investigated for stroke imaging (14–19). A recent study shows that
DWI lesions with no change in mean kurtosis (MK) are likely to
respond favorably to early reperfusion, while lesions with abnormalities in both mean diffusion (MD) and kurtosis show poor recovery,
suggesting that diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) is capable of
stratifying the heterogeneously injured DWI lesion (20).
As diffusion in cerebral tissue is anisotropic, the standard DKI
protocol requires collecting DWI images with multiple b-values
along varied diffusion directions, resulting in relatively long
acquisition times of 6 min or more (15). The scan time has to

be substantially shortened before DKI can be used routinely in
the acute stroke setting. Hansen et al. recently proposed a fast
DKI acquisition and processing approach, and demonstrated its
ability to map both mean diffusivity (MD′) and apparent mean
kurtosis (MK′) in ﬁxed brains and control subjects (21). Because
it is not practical to obtain and compare different means of DKI

in acute stroke patients, our study tested whether the fast DKI
approach can characterize heterogeneous ischemic lesions in
an animal model of acute stroke prior to clinical translation. We
showed that MD′ and MK′ maps obtained using the fast DKI
protocol strongly correlated with MD and MK obtained using
conventional approaches, and that the severity and size of
diffusion and kurtosis ischemic lesions were in good agreement.
Thus, our results demonstrate that the newly proposed fast
DKI method is suitable for imaging ischemic stroke in 2 min,
particularly in the acute stroke setting.

of directions (22–24). To conﬁrm this, we also obtained DKI using
b-values of 0, 1000 and 2500 s/mm2 along 15 diffusion directions
in four normal rats (scan time =5 min 10 s) for comparison.
Data analysis
Images were analyzed in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA). For
the fast DKI acquisition scheme, we calculated MD′ using the

content of the blood (SpO2) were monitored (Nonin Pulse
Oximeter 8600, Plymouth, MN), and body temperature was maintained by a circulating warm water jacket positioned around the
torso. Ten normal rats and ten stroke rats were imaged, following
a standard intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
procedure. One stroke rat was excluded from analysis due to failed
MCAO preparation with little ischemic lesion.

MRI scans were performed on a 4.7 T small-bore scanner (Bruker
BioSpec, Billerica, MA). Multislice MRI (ﬁve slices, slice
thickness/gap = 1.8/0.2 mm, ﬁeld of view = 20 × 20 mm2, acquisition matrix = 48 × 48) was acquired with single-shot echo-planar
imaging. For the fast DKI protocol, we used three b-values: 0,
1000, and 2500 s/mm2. One image was obtained for b = 0 and
three images were obtained for b = 1000 s/mm2 with the diffusion gradient applied along the directions (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0) and
(0, 0, 1). In addition, nine images were obtained for b = 2500 s/
mm2 with the diffusion gradient applied along n^ ðiÞ , n^ ðiþÞ and
n^ ðiÞ , which were deﬁned as n^ ð1Þ ¼ ð1; 0; 0ÞT , n^ ð1þÞ ¼ ð0; 1; 1ÞT
and n^ ð1Þ ¼ ð0; 1; 1ÞT , and similarly for i =2 and 3 (gradient
pulse duration/diffusion time (δ/Δ) = 6/20 ms, TR/TE = 2500/
40.5 ms, number of signal average (NSA) = 4, scan time = 2 min
10 s). Note that the superscript i in n^ ðiÞ labels the position of
the “1” while in n^ ðiþÞ and n^ ðiÞ it labels the position of the “0” (21).
As we were interested in the MK instead of the full tensor, we
extended a conventional diffusion tensor imaging protocol for
deriving kurtosis (20,22,23). Speciﬁcally, we used six b-values –
0, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500 s/mm2 – in six diffusion
gradient directions (scan time =5 min 10 s). In this study, a
conventional MK was estimated by averaging the kurtosis from
six independent directions, which has been shown in brain to
agree fairly well with estimates obtained using higher numbers

Note that for the fast DKI approach MK′ was directly calculated
(Equation [2]). For processing conventional DKI data, apparent
diffusion (Dapp) and kurtosis coefﬁcients (Kapp) along each direction were calculated by least-squares ﬁtting DWI signals to
1 2 2
SðbÞ ¼ Sð0ÞebDapp þ6b Dapp K app , where S(b) is the DWI signal at a
particular b-value and S(0) is the signal without diffusion
weighting (22). The mean diffusion coefﬁcient and the kurtosis
coefﬁcient were calculated as the average of Dapp and Kapp,
respectively. For DKI data obtained with 15 diffusion directions,
we used Diffusional Kurtosis Estimator (DKE; http://
academicdepartments.musc.edu/cbi/dki/dke). To differentiate
MD and MK results obtained from these two approaches, we
used MDmu and MKmu to denote measurements from six bvalues along six directions, and MDtf and MKtf to denote
measurements from three b-values along 15 directions.

RESULTS
Figure 1 shows diffusion and kurtosis maps from the central slice
(positioned 2 mm posterior to the bregma) of a representative
normal Wistar rat, obtained using the approach of six b-values
along six diffusion directions (Fig. 1(a), (b)), three b-values along
15 directions (Fig. 1(c), (d)), and the fast acquisition approach
(Fig. 1(e), (f)). Notably, the corpus callosum (CC) and striatum
displayed hyperintensity in the MK maps due to their
complex/restricted microscopic structure (26). There was signiﬁcant correlation, per voxel, of the diffusion and kurtosis coefﬁcients measured using six b-values along six directions (MDmu
and MKmu) and three b-values along 15 directions (MDtf and
MKtf, squares). Speciﬁcally, we have MDtf = 0.87 MDmu + 0.08
(R2 = 0.96, P < 0.01, Fig. 1(g)) and MKtf = 0.86 MKmu + 0.03
(R2 = 0.73, P < 0.01, Fig. 1(h)), summarized in Table 1. Analysis of
four normal animals with two conventional DKI methods showed
that R2 was 0.96 ± 0.01 for MDtf versus MDmu, and 0.67 ± 0.09 for
MKtf versus MKmu, respectively, substantially correlated with

FAST KURTOSIS IMAGING OF ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE
kurtosis map signal-to-noise ratio in the central slice of normal
rats to be 6.0 ± 0.4 versus 6.5 ± 0.7 for the conventional and fast
DKI approaches, respectively, with their relative difference within
10%. These ﬁndings suggest that both diffusion and kurtosis
maps can be obtained using the fast DKI acquisition method,
in reasonable agreement with the standard approach.
Because the DKI method of multiple b-values along six diffusion directions provides similar DKI measurements to that of
three b-values along 15 directions and has been demonstrated
capable of capturing diffusion/kurtosis mismatch, we chose it to
test the fast DKI method during acute stroke (20). Figure 2
compares diffusion and kurtosis maps from the central slice of a
representative acute stroke rat obtained using the standard DKI
protocol (Fig. 2(a), (b)) and the fast acquisition approach (Fig. 2
(c), (d)). The right ipsilateral striatum shows substantial diffusion
decrease and kurtosis increase due to ischemic injury. Similar to
normal rats, there was signiﬁcant correlation, per voxel, between
diffusion and kurtosis values measured using the standard (MDmu
and MKmu) and fast DKI protocols (MD′ and MK′). We found that
MD′ = 0.90 MDmu + 0.07 (R2 = 0.82, P < 0.01) and MK′ = 0.88
MKmu + 0.05 (R2 = 0.80, P < 0.01). The identity lines were included
in both ﬁgures (dash–dotted lines). An analysis of all stroke animals (n = 9) showed that R2 was 0.80 ± 0.09 and 0.75 ± 0.06 for
MD′ versus MDmu and MK′ versus MKmu, respectively, signiﬁcantly
different from zero (P < 0.01, one sample t-test).
Figure 3 shows multi-slice diffusion and kurtosis maps from a
representative acute stroke rat. Diffusion and kurtosis lesions in
the ipsilateral ischemic brain were determined if their values
were two standard deviations beyond their means. Diffusion
and kurtosis images and outlined lesions are shown for the conventional method (Fig. 3(a), (b)) and fast DKI approach (Fig. 3(c),
(d)), demonstrating that the threshold-based tissue segmentation algorithm can provide reasonable delineation of heterogeneous ischemic tissue.
We compared diffusion and kurtosis lesion size determined
using the fast DKI method and the conventional DKI protocol
(Fig. 4). Diffusion and kurtosis lesion volumes were 130 ± 85 mm3
and 91 ± 55 mm3 respectively from the conventional method,
while they were 140 ± 102 mm3 and 106 ± 76 mm3 from the fast
DKI method. Regression analysis shows MD′ lesion = 1.18 MDmu
lesion  13.74 mm3 (R2 = 0.98, P < 0.01, Pearson correlation), and
MK′ lesion = 1.38 MKmu lesion  19.32 mm3 (R2 = 0.98, P < 0.01,
Pearson correlation). A paired t-test showed no signiﬁcant difference in diffusion lesion size (P > 0.19) and kurtosis lesion size
(P > 0.08). Importantly, there was no signiﬁcant difference in
kurtosis–diffusion lesion mismatch obtained from these two
methods (26 ± 13% versus 23 ± 8%, P > 0.08). In addition,
regression analysis showed signiﬁcant correlation in their
kurtosis–diffusion lesion mismatches (R2 = 0.57, P < 0.02). Consequently, our data conﬁrmed that the fast DKI protocol provided
good measurement of diffusion and kurtosis during acute stroke,
in good agreement with the conventional DKI protocol.

signiﬁcant correlation, per voxel, of the diffusion and kurtosis coefﬁcients measured using six b-values along six directions (MDmu

linear regression analysis (dashed lines), we found that MD

MDmu and 0.55 ± 0.09 for MK′ versus MKmu, both signiﬁcantly different from 0 (P < 0.01, one sample t-test). The identity lines
were plotted as dash–dotted lines. In addition, we found the

We further compared MD′ and MK′ values in contralateral
normal region, diffusion and kurtosis lesions (Fig. 5). One-way
analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction was performed
to compare diffusion and kurtosis values in contralateral normal
area, ipsilateral ischemic diffusion and kurtosis lesions. The
contralateral normal MD′ and MK′ were determined to be
0.87 ± 0.02 μm2/ms and 0.64 ± 0.03, respectively. For MD′ lesions,
we found MD′ and MK′ to be 0.67 ± 0.07 μm2/ms and 0.89 ± 0.05,
respectively, signiﬁcantly different from those of the contralateral

normal region (P < 0.01). For MK′ lesions, we found MD′ and MK′ to
be 0.69 ± 0.07 μm2/ms and 0.97 ± 0.08, respectively, signiﬁcantly
different from those of the contralateral normal region (P < 0.01).
Notably, MD′ was not statistically different between MD′ and MK′
lesions, while their MK′ was signiﬁcantly different (P = 0.02), consistent with the notion that the severity of mean diffusivity decrease
could not reliably stratify the heterogeneous DWI lesion (12).

DISCUSSION
It has been shown that DKI is able to stratify heterogeneously injured DWI lesions, thus enabling improved deﬁnition of ischemic
penumbra (20). However, the relatively long acquisition time of
the technique limits its use in the acute stroke setting (15,19).
Hansen et al. demonstrated that fast DKI approach strongly
correlates with an approach of multiple b-values along fully
sampled diffusion directions in normal subjects. Speciﬁcally,

intraluminal MCAO induces severe hypoperfusion and
aggravates ischemic injury, which could shorten the therapeutic
window. The biological signiﬁcance of heterogeneous kurtosis–
diffusion mismatch should be elucidated using thromboembolic
animal stroke models, which mimic human ischemic stroke
better than intraluminal stroke models. In addition, it is necessary
to develop more advanced tissue classiﬁcation algorithms –
beyond the threshold-based analysis – to quickly and accurately
segment ischemic tissue in guiding stroke treatment (34–36).

CONCLUSION
Our study evaluated a fast DKI acquisition method for acute stroke
imaging and showed that the size and severity of diffusion and
kurtosis lesions obtained using the fast method substantially correlated with those obtained using a conventional DKI protocol.
Therefore, the fast stroke DKI approach holds great promise for investigation of the evolution and therapeutic relevance of diffusion
and kurtosis lesions, and ultimately for facilitating translational
kurtosis imaging in the acute stroke setting.

the fast DKI protocol used in our study took about 2 min,
substantially shorter than the conventional DKI protocols of
5 min. Before we can apply it to study patients in the acute stroke
setting, it is necessary to compare it with conventional DKI
methods and validate that diffusion and kurtosis lesions can be
reliably measured at reduced scan time. It is important to note that
MD and MD′ correspond to the same physical quantities, albeit
estimated in different ways. In contrast, MK and MK′ are physically
distinct, but are nonetheless highly correlated. Speciﬁcally, MK
presents the directional average of the kurtosis and MK′ represents
the average of the kurtosis tensor (21). Indeed, we showed that
mean diffusion and kurtosis coefﬁcients obtained using the fast
DKI scheme substantially correlated with those from conventional
DKI protocols (Figs. 1 and 2). In addition, the fast DKI method was
in excellent agreement with the standard methods in deﬁning
mean diffusion and kurtosis lesions (Fig. 4). More importantly, the
kurtosis–diffusion lesion mismatch during acute ischemic stroke
can be captured using the fast DKI method (21).
As the MK measurement was the major focus in our study
instead of the full kurtosis tensor, we chose the approach of
multiple b-values along six undersampled diffusion directions
in order to reduce its scan time for acute stroke imaging. We
derived kurtosis using goodness of ﬁt, a model that has also
been used by Lätt et al. and Jensen et al. (22,23,25). The small
number of diffusion directions used for conventional DKI is a
limitation of the study. In particular, the MK measurements
determined from six directions are probably more variable and
less accurate than would be the case for a 30 direction protocol
(21). Recently, Fukunaga et al. demonstrated similar MK
measurements using 6 and 15 directions (24). Our results also
conﬁrmed signiﬁcant correlation between measurements
obtained with six b-values along six directions, three b-values
along 15 directions and the fast DKI method proposed by
Hansen et al. (21). Both diffusion and kurtosis determined from
the fast method were slightly underestimated with respect to
the approach of multiple b-values. The reasons for this could
be complex because in vivo diffusion measurements depend
on a number of parameters, including the diffusion direction,
number and range of b-values as well as diffusion time. In addition, the fast approach solves for the diffusion and kurtosis by
assuming negligible high order diffusion (e.g. O(b3)) and Rician
noise terms, while such terms could be treated as the residual
ﬁtting error in the multiple-b DKI approach. Importantly, the
correlation between these two protocols was highly signiﬁcant.
It is worth noting that the fast DKI approach only provides
measurements of mean diffusion and kurtosis, which may hinder
the adoption of the fast DKI protocol in the situation where a
complete set of diffusion tensor metrics beyond mean diffusion
and kurtosis are required (19,26–33). Because studies have
demonstrated that diffusion anisotropic matrixes such as FA do
not consistently show changes in the ﬁrst six hours of ischemic
stroke, the fast DKI approach, despite the loss of its ability to
resolve diffusion and kurtosis tensors, should be acceptable for
the acute stroke imaging application, where imaging time has
to be minimized (34,35).
The establishment of the fast DKI protocol should enable
future studies to investigate early ischemic tissue injury in the
acute stroke setting and to verify whether kurtosis MRI augments
standard stroke MRI, and ultimately provides guidance for more
effective stroke treatment. Our study used an intraluminal stroke
model, which provides relatively reproducible ischemic insult, to
