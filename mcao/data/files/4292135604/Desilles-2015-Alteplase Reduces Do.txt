Background and Purpose—Downstream microvascular thrombosis (DMT) is known to be a contributing factor to incomplete
reperfusion in acute ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to determine the timing of DMT with intravital imaging
and to test the hypothesis that intravenous alteplase infusion could reduce DMT in a transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) rat stroke model.
Methods—Rats were subjected to 60-minute transient MCAO. Alteplase (10 mg/kg) was administered 30 minutes after
the beginning of MCAO. Real-time intravital fluorescence microscopy through a dura-sparing craniotomy was used to
visualize circulating blood cells and fibrinogen. Cerebral microvessel patency was quantitatively evaluated by fluorescein
isothiocyanate-dextran perfusion.
Results—Immediately after MCAO, platelet and leukocyte accumulation were observed mostly in the venous compartment.
Within 30 minutes after MCAO, microthrombi and parietal fibrin deposits were detected in postcapillary microvessels.
Alteplase treatment significantly (P=0.006) reduced infarct volume and increased the percentage of perfused vessels
during MCAO (P=0.02) compared with saline. Plasma levels of fibrinogen from alteplase-treated rats showed a rapid
and profound hypofibrinogenemia. In vitro platelet aggregation demonstrated that alteplase reduced platelet aggregation
(P=0.0001) and facilitated platelet disaggregation (P=0.001). These effects were reversible in the presence of exogenous
fibrinogen.
Conclusions—Our data demonstrate that DMT is an early phenomenon initiated before recanalization. We further show that
alteplase-dependent maintenance of downstream perfusion during MCAO improves acute ischemic stroke outcome through a
fibrinogen-dependent platelet aggregation reduction. Our results indicate that early targeting of DMT represents a therapeutic
strategy to improve the benefit of large artery recanalization in acute ischemic stroke.   (Stroke. 2015;46:3241-3248.

alteplase infusion before EVT has now become a matter of
debate.8 A meta-analysis of EVT showed that the likelihood of
a favorable outcome increased with the use of previous intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase.9 The fact that alteplase
infusion exerts beneficial effects even in case of mechanical
recanalization suggests that alteplase does not only impact
proximal arterial recanalization but also probably prevents or
corrects other ischemia/reperfusion-related damage.

of care has changed, with evidence showing that rapid additional endovascular therapy (EVT) was superior to intravenous alteplase alone in the setting of AIS with large vessel
occlusions.3–7 Whether to continue carrying out intravenous

Several experimental studies have examined microvascular changes downstream from focal cerebral ischemia.10,11
Histological evaluation of the ischemic tissue with light and
electron microscopy showed that microvessel lumina were
obstructed with platelets, leukocytes, and fibrin-rich aggregates.12–15 Corroborating these findings, intravital imaging studies have revealed that immediately after arterial recanalization,
leukocytes and platelets adhere to endothelial cells in postcapillary microvessels, thus contributing to microvascular obstruction.16–18 This thrombotic process in microvessels downstream
of the initial occlusion site could be responsible for incomplete
microcirculatory reperfusion and drive infarct growth despite
successful proximal recanalization.10 Supporting this hypothesis, experimental studies in AIS models have shown that platelet adhesion or aggregation, or leukocyte adhesion inhibition
could reduce infarct volume notably by enhancing the patency
of downstream cerebral microvessels.19–22 Furthermore, clinical studies have shown that a state of incomplete reperfusion
despite successful recanalization occurs in approximately one
quarter of patients with significant impact on clinical outcome.23,24 Taken together, these data indicate that therapeutic approaches aimed at microvascular obstruction reduction
might improve the success rate of recanalization therapies. The
exact mechanisms and timing of downstream microvascular
thrombosis (DMT) during AIS remain unclear. In particular,
no experimental study has explored whether microvascular
thrombosis was an early event after proximal occlusion or
rather a consequence of ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury.
The aim of this study was to determine the timing of DMT in
AIS with real-time intravital imaging and to assess the potential efficacy of alteplase to improve microvascular perfusion in
a rat model of transient cerebral ischemia.

Methods
The Animal Ethics Committee of the INSERM-University Paris 7, authorization 2010/13/698-0002, approved animal care and experimental protocols. These experiments were conducted in compliance with the Stroke
Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) guidelines.25

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion and Reperfusion
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (Janvier, France), weighing 300 to 350
g, were anesthetized by isoflurane mixed with air (4% for induction;
1.5% during surgery), under spontaneous respiration. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by transient monofilament (4041PK10,
Doccol, Redlands, CA) occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery
occlusion (tMCAO) for 60 minutes. Animals were randomly assigned
to 1 of 2 groups (n=15 per group): control (saline treatment only) and
alteplase (10 mg/kg body weight, Actilyse; Boehringer Ingelheim,
Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany). Continuous alteplase or saline infusion via the right jugular vein (10% bolus; 90% continuous infusion
for 30 minutes; Harvard Apparatus Infusion Pump) started 30 minutes after stroke onset. After monofilament withdrawal, rats were returned to their cages. Body temperature was maintained at 37°C with
a heating pad for the duration of surgery. Computer-based randomization was used to allocate drug regimens to each group. Experiments
were blinded and the operator was unaware of group allocation during surgery and outcome assessment (Figure I in the online-only Data
Supplement).

DMT Visualization
After a partial dura-sparing craniotomy, rats were subjected to a
60-minute tMCAO (n=10). Intravital fluorescence microscopy

(Macroscope, Leica, France) was used to visualize circulating blood
cells (after intravenous injection of rhodamine 6G) and fibrinogen (fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC] antifibrinogen polyclonal
antibody, Dako, France) during MCAO and after recanalization.
Microvessel thrombosis was defined as direct visualization of platelet, leukocyte, and fibrinogen aggregates.

Determination of Infarct Size, Brain Edema, and
Hemorrhagic Transformation
Rats were euthanized 24 hours after tMCAO. Brains were quickly removed and cut into 2-mm thick coronal sections using a rat brain slice
matrix. The slices were stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Quentin Fallavier, France) in PBS to visualize the infarction. Planimetric measurements (Image J software,
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) were performed blinded
to the treatment group and were used to calculate infarct volumes and
brain edema.26 The occurrence of hemorrhagic transformation (HT)
was macroscopically assessed on whole brains and again after the
2-mm thick coronal brain slices were cut before 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining.

Neurological Deficit Evaluation
The neurological deficit was evaluated using a modified Neurological
Severity Score, which is a composite of motor, sensory, and balance
tests.26 Neurological function was graded on a scale of 0 to 10 (Figure
II in the online-only Data Supplement). Neurological Severity Score
was assessed immediately before euthanization at 24 hours after
stroke onset.

Measurements of Microvascular Patency
To examine the patency of cerebral microvessels downstream from
MCAO, FITC-dextran (2×106 molecular weight, Sigma-Aldrich,
France; 1 mL of 50 mg/mL) was administered intravenously to the
rats 1 minute before euthanization. The slice at +0.70 mm posterior
to bregma was fixed in paraformaldehyde 3.7%. One coronal section from each rat was digitized with a NanoZoomer at ×40 and
analyzed using morphometry software (Histolab 6.1.5, Microvision
Instruments). A threshold was applied to each digitized image to
ensure that the numbers of FITC pixels reflected the original FITCdextran–perfused patterns. For each hemisphere, the numbers of
FITC pixels divided by the total numbers of pixels were calculated.
Data are presented as the ratio between the 2 hemispheres and expressed as a percentage. To test the effect of alteplase on the patency
of downstream cerebral microcirculation, microvessels perfused with
FITC-dextran were examined 1 hour after MCAO before recanalization in rats treated by alteplase or saline (n=11 per group).

Measurements of Plasma Fibrinogen Level
Levels of fibrinogen were assayed on plasma samples from immediately before, 1 hour and 24 hours after alteplase or saline infusion.
Plasma samples were immediately separated by centrifugation at
2000g for 10 minutes and 2500g for 15 minutes and stored at −80°C
until further analysis. Fibrinogen levels were measured by the Clauss
method.27

In Vitro Platelet Aggregation
Platelet-rich plasma (PRP; 6×108 platelets/mL) or washed platelets
(WP) resuspended in platelet-poor plasma (PPP; 6×108 platelets/mL)
from rats were stimulated with ADP (50 µmol/L) to induce aggregation. Platelet aggregation was continuously recorded as changes in
light transmission (APACT 4004, Elitech France). Four different experiments were performed: platelet aggregation with (1) PRP from
rats treated with alteplase or saline; (2) WP resuspended in PPP from
rats treated with alteplase or saline; (3) WP resuspended in PPP from
alteplase-treated rats with or without addition of exogenous purified
rat fibrinogen (Sigma-Aldrich, France); and (4) platelet disaggregation with PRP. Disaggregation of PRP was induced by addition of

Desilles et al   Alteplase Improves Microvascular Perfusion    3243
alteplase at 3 different doses after the aggregation response reached
its maximum.

Exclusion Criteria
Animals were excluded for analysis if the total lesion volume was
<1% (n=2 and n=1 in alteplase and saline group, respectively), if subarachnoid hemorrhage was present (n=1 in each treatment group) or
if death because of anesthesia or surgery occurred within 3 hours of
stroke induction (n=0).

Animal Sample Size Calculation
The study was designed with 80% power to detect a relative 50%
difference in infarct volume between alteplase and saline groups.
Statistical testing was performed at the 2-tailed (α) level of 0.05 using
a t test. On the basis of preliminary data indicating that the average
infarction volume in 60-minute tMCAO was 33%, SD: 15.06%, we
used 15 rats for each group.

Results
Transient Monofilament MCAO Induces Early
DMT
The timing and frequency of DMT after occlusion of a major
cerebral artery were determined using fluorescence intravital microscopy combined with the tMCAO ischemic stroke
model. Observation of pial vessels through a partial durasparing craniotomy revealed that the accumulation of platelets

and leukocytes started immediately after occluding the MCA
(Figure 1A and 1B; Movies I and II in the online-only Data
Supplement). This early and pronounced adhesion of leukocytes and platelets occurred almost exclusively in the venous
compartment and persisted ≥1 hour after monofilament
withdrawal (Figure 1B; Movie IV in the online-only Data
Supplement). Furthermore, in all rats analyzed, during the
hour of MCAO, and before MCA recanalization, microthrombosis characterized by intraluminal deposition of fibrin(ogen)
developed in postcapillary microvessels at sites of leukocyte
and platelet accumulation (Figure 1C). These early aggregates
of leukocytes, platelets, and fibrin(ogen) led to a complete
cessation of blood flow in at least 1 postcapillary microvessel
per field of observation (Figure 1A; Movies II and III in the
online-only Data Supplement). After proximal recanalization
and despite recovery of blood flow in pial arteries, leukocytes
and platelets remained firmly adherent to the postcapillary
microvessel wall (Figure 1B; Movie IV in the online-only
Data Supplement). These results indicate that DMT is an early
event of AIS that principally affects the venous compartment
and that can persist despite proximal recanalization.

Alteplase Intravenous Infusion Improves Stroke
Outcome After Monofilament Transient MCAO
To determine whether thrombolytic therapy can limit MCAOinduced brain damage, we compared the effect of alteplase
and saline on stroke outcome when administered early after
monofilament MCAO. Intravenous alteplase injection at
10 mg/kg 30 minutes after initiating tMCAO significantly
reduced infarct size evaluated 24 hours later (P=0.006;
Figure 2A and 2B). Accordingly, the neurological deficit 24
hours after tMCAO was decreased in the alteplase-treated

The cortical microcirculation downstream of the
MCA was observed by intravital microscopy
before, during, and after MCAO. Platelets and leukocytes were labeled by intravenous injection of
rhodamine 6G, and fibrin(ogen) using a fluorescein
isothiocyanate–conjugated antifibrinogen polyclonal antibody. A, Representative images of rhodamine 6G labeling before (0 minutes), 15 minutes,

group (P=0.004; Figure 2C). Brain edema was also significantly decreased in the alteplase-treated group in comparison
with the saline-treated group expressed as percentage difference between the ischemic and nonischemic hemisphere volume (10.5% versus 5.2%, respectively; P=0.05; Figure 2D).
Importantly, there was no mortality or HT at 24 hours in any
group.
The effect of early alteplase treatment on microvascular
patency during cerebral ischemia was measured in a subgroup
of rats that were euthanized before recanalization at the end of
the 60-minute long MCAO period. For these experiments, fluorescent dextran was injected intravenously 1 minute before
euthanization to highlight patent vessels. Alteplase treatment
led to a significant increase in microvascular patency in the
ischemic cerebral hemisphere when compared with saline
treatment (P=0.02; Figure 3A and 3B). Together, these results
showing that early administration of alteplase improves microvascular patency and stroke outcome in a model of tMCAO
indicate that alteplase exerts beneficial effects independently
of its action on proximal arterial recanalization.

Alteplase Fibrino(geno)lytic Activity Induces a
Rapid and Profound Hypofibrinogenemia That
Prevents Platelet Aggregation and Promotes
Disaggregation of Freshly Formed Platelet
Aggregates
The maintenance of microvascular patency by alteplase during
MCAO suggested that its early administration might prevent
DMT secondary to proximal occlusion. Fibrinogen concentration dramatically decreased at 1 hour after the end of treatment infusion in the alteplase group (P<0.001; Figure 3C) but
not in the saline group. Furthermore, citrated PRP retrieved
from rats treated with alteplase showed a decreased platelet
aggregation in response to ADP when compared with PRP

from saline-treated rats (Figure 4A and 4B). In addition,
alteplase concentrations corresponding to doses of 1, 3, and
10 mg/kg caused a dose-dependent disaggregation of platelets
when added to rat PRP after maximal aggregation response to
ADP was achieved (Figure 4C and 4D). To determine whether
the effect of alteplase aggregation and disaggregation could
be attributed to the alteplase-induced hypofibrinogenomia or
whether it further involved a direct effect on platelets through
shedding of platelet adhesion receptors, experiments with
crossed platelet/plasma systems were performed. WPs and
PPP were prepared from rats treated with alteplase or saline
and the aggregation response to ADP of both types of WP was
tested in either 1 of the 2 PPP. These experiments showed a significant reduction in the aggregation response to ADP of WP,
whether from alteplase-treated or control rats, in PPP from
alteplase-treated rats when compared with PPP from salinetreated rats (Figure 5A and 5B). Importantly, the addition
of exogenous purified rat fibrinogen to PPP from alteplasetreated rats restored the aggregation response to ADP of WP
from both alteplase-treated and control rats (Figure 5C and
5D). These results therefore indicate that early administration of alteplase during MCAO helps to maintain downstream
microvascular patency by preventing platelet aggregation
and promoting platelet disaggregation through induction of
fibrino(geno)lysis.

techniques that evaluate perfusion during proximal occlusion
fail to distinguish if microvascular thrombosis affects hypoperfusion or if hypoperfusion is only the consequence of
proximal occlusion. Because clinical studies suggested that
secondary ischemia and lesion growth would be modest or
nonexistent after reperfusion,29,30 concerns have been raised
about whether secondary microthrombosis occurs in patients;
and whether it could constitute a therapeutic target for AIS
treatment.28 In this perspective, we demonstrated that DMT is
a direct consequence of proximal occlusion and not of reperfusion. Our results suggest a reconsideration of the secondary
microthrombosis perception, both in terms of pathophysiology
and of how it should be approached as a therapeutic target. In
fact, we show that the deleterious impact of DMT on stroke
outcome is because of its early consequences on microvessel patency immediately after occlusion. Accordingly, maintenance of microvessel patency during occlusion by early
administration of alteplase resulted in infarct size reduction
and neurological deficit improvement.
Considering the role of leukocytes, especially neutrophils,
in venous thrombosis31 one could speculate that the risk and
intensity of DMT might be enhanced by proinflammatory or
procoagulant states (eg, diabetes mellitus, infection, dyslipidemia, etc). For example, diabetes mellitus was recently shown
to prime circulating neutrophils for activation and release of
procoagulant neutrophil extracellular traps.32 Thus, early targeting of DMT and the relevance of our findings might be
even more important in such comorbid situations.
The therapeutic potential of targeting secondary microthrombosis for AIS treatment was previously suggested by
experimental studies where microthrombosis was prevented
either by using a constitutive genetic deficiency in thrombus
formation in mice or the early administration of antithrombotic drugs after proximal occlusion.20,21,33–36 Taken together
with our findings, these studies indicate that DMT targeting
should be achieved as soon as possible following occlusion,
even before recanalization, to be effective. In that regard, a
recent EVT meta-analysis showed that the likelihood of a
favorable outcome increased with the use of previous intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase.9 Moreover, early alteplase
treatment was also shown to predict better outcome despite
persistence of large artery occlusion.37 Our results provide
mechanistic insights that could explain these clinical data.
Indeed, unlike thrombo-embolic models, the monofilament
model of tMCAO mimicks such clinical situations in which the
causal occlusion and proximal recanalization are not affected
by intravenous thrombolytic treatment. Nevertheless, our findings likely apply to other proximal artery occlusion models
of stroke. As we show with intravital microscopy, DMT is
not a consequence of reperfusion but of proximal occlusion,
an event common to the various large artery ischemic stroke
models (transient or permanent MCAO and embolic models). In our experimental model of proximal artery occlusion,
despite a profound decrease in downstream blood flow during
MCAO, residual perfusion was maintained through collateral
pial anastomosis. This residual blood flow downstream proximal occlusion allows transient tissue survival (penumbra) and
regional drug delivery.

Using this model, we demonstrate the pathological
importance of DMT and show that it can be overcome by
early intravenous alteplase administration that causes a
rapid and profound hypofibrinogenemia. The latter events
prevent platelet aggregation and help to dissociate freshly
formed unstable platelet aggregates. Alteplase-induced
hypofibrinogenemia and its consequences on platelet
aggregation and disaggregation were previously shown
to be due to the incomplete fibrin specificity of alteplase
when used at therapeutic plasma concentration.38–40 This
temporary hypofibrinogenemia is also frequently found in
patients treated with alteplase. Results from clinical studies have suggested that fibrinogen exerts paradoxical and
biphasic effects during the acute phase of ischemic stroke.
Elevated initial plasma levels of fibrinogen were shown to
be independently associated with a poor stroke outcome.41
In addition, Ancrod, a purified fraction of venom from
Malayan pit viper (Calloselasma rhodostoma) that induces
a hypofibrinogenemia by splitting the fibrinogen, has been
shown to have a favorable benefit-risk profile for patients
when administered early within 3 hours of stroke onset.42
However, other clinical studies have shown that there was
no benefit in giving Ancrod beyond 3 hours of stroke onset.43
Therefore, exactly like for alteplase, Ancrod-induced
hypofibrinogenemia seems to be beneficial exclusively
when used early after stroke onset. On the other hand, the
increased risk of HT associated with hypofibrinogenemia is
probably the most important adverse effect of late alteplase
treatment.44,45 Thus, although plasma fibrinogen plays a deleterious role by supporting DMT in the first few hours of
AIS, it remains necessary to prevent HT in later stages. Of
note, in our model, alteplase was not associated with HT
when administered early after occlusion.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that DMT occurs
immediately after MCAO and contributes to MCAO-induced
brain damage. We further show that early intravenous
alteplase administration, before recanalization, improves ischemic stroke outcome by preserving cerebral microvascular
perfusion downstream to the arterial occlusion. This benefit
of alteplase was predominantly mediated by a rapid fibrinogenolytic action. Thus, our results support the use of alteplase
treatment before EVT to improve the benefit of large artery
recanalization, through targeting of DMT.
