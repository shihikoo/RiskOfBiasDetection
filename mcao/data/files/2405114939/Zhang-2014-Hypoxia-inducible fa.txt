Stroke is a leading cause of adult morbidity and mortality with very limited treatment options. Evidence
from preclinical models of ischemic stroke has demonstrated that the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
effectively protects the brain from ischemic injury. Here, we evaluated a new pathway through which
NAC exerted its neuroprotection in a transient cerebral ischemia animal model. Our results demonstrated
that pretreatment with NAC increased protein levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), the
regulatable subunit of HIF-1, and its target proteins erythropoietin (EPO) and glucose transporter
(GLUT)-3, in the ipsilateral hemispheres of rodents subjected to 90 min middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) and 24 h reperfusion. Interestingly, after NAC pretreatment and stroke, the contralateral
hemisphere also demonstrated increased levels of HIF-1α, EPO, and GLUT-3, but to a lesser extent.
Suppressing HIF-1 activity with two widely used pharmacological inhibitors, YC-1 and 2ME2, and speciﬁc
knockout of neuronal HIF-1α abolished NAC’s neuroprotective effects. The results also showed that YC-1
and 2ME2 massively enlarged infarcts, indicating that their toxic effect was larger than just abolishing
NAC's neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, we determined the mechanism of NAC-mediated HIF-1α
induction. We observed that NAC pretreatment upregulated heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) expression
and increased the interaction of Hsp90 with HIF-1α in ischemic brains. The enhanced association of
Hsp90 with HIF-1α increased HIF-1α stability. Moreover, Hsp90 inhibition attenuated NAC-induced HIF1α protein accumulation and diminished NAC-induced neuroprotection in the MCAO model. These
results strongly indicate that HIF-1 plays an important role in NAC-mediated neuroprotection and
provide a new molecular mechanism involved in the antioxidant’s neuroprotection in ischemic stroke.

Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States and
worldwide [1,2]. Reduced supply of oxygen and nutrients results
in devastating loss of neurons and leads to defects in brain
function in stroke patients [3]. Developing stroke therapeutics
remains one of the major challenges in clinical medicine. A further
exploration of the mechanism of drug candidates in stroke is
crucial to the design and implementation of human trials.
Pharmacological effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) have been
studied in stroke models by several research groups. Rodents
treated with NAC before ischemia showed reduction in brain
infarct volume [4,5], reduced neuronal cell death [6–8], and
improvement in neurological function [4]. In addition, NAC is
protective in other organs subjected to ischemia, such as heart,
liver, lung, and kidney [9–13], and is beneﬁcial in other types of
brain diseases such as Parkinson disease [14], Alzheimer disease

[15], and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [16], by slowing down aging
and increasing life span [17].
The neuroprotective effects of NAC in ischemia have generally
been accredited to its ability to reduce reactive oxygen species
(ROS) levels and to inhibit oxidation of lipids, proteins, and DNA.
Over the past decades, research progress in cellular redox signaling suggests that antioxidants may exert their biological functions
through speciﬁc signaling pathways. Studies on pathways that
contribute to NAC’s neuroprotective effects in ischemia are scarce,
although NAC has been suggested to mediate cell survival signaling pathways in other pathological conditions, including cardiovascular, respiratory, and hepatic diseases (see review [18] for
detailed discussion). One study has suggested that the neuroprotection of NAC is related to its anti-inﬂammatory activity through
suppression of the activity of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) [19].
However, it has been reported that NAC’s protective effect is
retained even when administered after the NF-κB activation burst
[20]. This observation suggested that anti-inﬂammation might
not critically contribute to NAC’s neuroprotection. A greater

understanding of NAC-mediated changes in key pathways in
pathological conditions such as ischemia may provide insights
for developing promising therapeutic approaches.
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a predominant mediator
of adaptive responses to decreased oxygen availability, a characteristic of ischemic stroke. HIF-1 is a heterodimer of two subunits,
the regulatable HIF-1α and the constitutively expressed and stable
HIF-1β [21]. The activity of HIF-1 is primarily determined by the
level of its α subunit [22,23]. Our previous study demonstrated
that NAC is able to induce HIF-1α expression in primary cortical
neurons exposed to hypoxia [24]. Our present study provides
experimental evidence that NAC stabilizes HIF-1α and increases its
downstream target genes expression in the brains of transient
cerebral ischemia animal models. More importantly, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that the protective effects of NAC against
ischemic injury were abolished when HIF-1 activity was inhibited
by either pharmacological inhibitors or genetic depletion. Furthermore, we reveal a novel mechanism by which NAC upregulates
HIF-1α protein expression in ischemic brains.

Materials and methods
Animals
All procedures using animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Kansas
and the University of New Mexico and conformed to the National
Institutes of Health guidelines for use of animals in research.
Animals were maintained in a climate-controlled vivarium with a
12-h light–dark cycle with free access to food and water. Male
Sprague–Dawley rats, 280–310 g, were from Charles River Laboratory (Wilmington, MA, USA). Mice (B6.129-hif-1αtm3Rsjo/J) carrying
homozygous HIF-1α ﬂoxed alleles (HIF-1αF/F) were generated by
engineering loxP sites ﬂanking exon 2 of the HIF-1α gene as
described previously [25] and were bought from The Jackson
Laboratory (Stock No. 007561, Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Mice (B6.
Cg-Tg (CaMk2a-cre) T29-1Stl/J) expressing Cre recombinase under
the control of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMKII)
promoter were generated as described previously [26] and also
bought from The Jackson Laboratory (Stock No. 005359). All mouse
strains were maintained on a C57BL/6 J background. All animals
were acclimated to the environment for 7 days before the experiments. The mouse strain B6.Cg-Tg (CaMk2a-cre) was crossed with
homozygous HIF-1αF/F mice to generate Cre þ /  :HIF-1αF/Wt, which
were crossed with homozygous HIF-1αF/F mice to generate HIF-1α
mutants Cre þ /  :HIF-1αF/F, designated as neuron-speciﬁc HIF-1αknockout HIF-1αΔ/Δ as described previously [27]. Littermates with
the Cre  /  :HIF-1αF/F genotype were used as controls for each
group of experiments.

Genotyping
Genomic DNA was isolated from tail biopsies collected at 21 days
of age using the DNeasy genomic DNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA, USA). HIF-1αF and wild-type alleles were detected using the
following primers: 5′-CGTGTGAGAAAACTTCTGGATG-3′ and 5′AAAAGTATTGTGTTGGGGCAGT-3′. Transgenic mice expressing Cre
recombinase were identiﬁed using primers 5′-GCGGTCTGGCAGTAAAAACTATC-3′ and 5′-GTGAAACAGCATTGCTGTCACTT-3′. PCR was
performed with the Omni Clenttaq polymerase (DNA Polymerase Co.,
St. Louis, MO, USA). The products were run on a 3% agarose gel for
HIF-1α or Cre. A representative genotype analysis of nine littermates
is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
For the surgical procedures on rats, 4.0% isoﬂurane in N2O:O2
(70%:30%) was used for anesthesia induction and 2.0% for anesthesia maintenance. Duration of anesthetic exposure was kept the
same for each animal. MCAO followed by reperfusion was conducted using an intraluminal model as previously described [28].
Brieﬂy, the external carotid artery (ECA), internal carotid artery
(ICA), and pterygopalatine artery of the ICA were exposed.
A silicone rubber-coated monoﬁlament nylon suture (Doccol Corp.,
Sharon, MA, USA) with a diameter of 0.37 mm was inserted into
the ICA via a slit in the ECA. The suture was advanced along the ICA
to the extent of 18 to 19 mm from the bifurcation of the rat.
Reperfusion was produced by gently withdrawing the suture until
the suture tip reached the bifurcation and the incision closed
90 min after the onset of ischemia. After surgery, the animals were
allowed to recover from anesthesia while being given food and
water ad libitum. Buprenorphine was administered at 0.1 mg/kg
subcutaneously as postoperative analgesia. For mouse anesthesia,
2.0% isoﬂurane in N2O:O2 (70%:30%) was used for induction and
1.0% for maintenance. A similar surgical procedure was performed
on mice using smaller-sized sutures, with a diameter of 0.23 mm
(Doccol Corp.). The suture was advanced along the ICA to the
extent of 9 to 10 mm from the bifurcation of the mouse. For all
animals used in this study, successful MCAO was conﬁrmed by
laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (LDF; Moor Instruments, Wilmington, DE,
USA) as described in the literature [29]. During ischemia, LDF
regional cerebral blood ﬂow dropped to 16.9 7 3.6 (mice) or
15.4 7 1.8% (rats) of the preischemic level; and after reperfusion
the blood ﬂow was restored to 87.6 74.7 (mice) or 90.5 73.6%
(rats) of the preischemic level. In addition, the animals were
placed on a heating pad during surgery. Body temperature was
monitored throughout the surgery process. There was no signiﬁcant difference in body temperature, which was in the range of
37.0 70.3 1C. Animals that did not show any neurological deﬁcits
or had intracranial bleeding during the surgical process were
excluded.
Experimental groups
Sprague–Dawley male rats were randomly assigned to the
following nine groups: (1) 3-(5′-hydroxymethyl-2′-furyl)-1-benzylindazole (YC-1) (without MCAO, n ¼5); (2) NAC (without MCAO,
n ¼5); (3) 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) (without MCAO, n¼ 5);
(4) MCAO (n ¼25); (5) MCAO pretreated with NAC (n ¼25);
(6) MCAO pretreated with YC-1 (n¼ 30); (7) MCAO pretreated
with YC-1 þNAC (n ¼30); (8) MCAO pretreated with 2ME2
(n ¼30); and (9) MCAO pretreated with 2ME2 þNAC (n¼ 30).
In all the six groups subjected to MCAO, ﬁve rats were used for
Western blotting of whole contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres, ﬁve rats were used for Western blotting of peri-infarct
tissue, ﬁve rats were used for immunostaining, and ﬁve to eight
rats were used for infarct size measurement by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) staining (Table 1). NAC (A7250; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA)
dissolved in saline with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was
administered at 150 mg/kg body wt intraperitoneally (ip) at
30 min before the onset of ischemia according to a previous
publication [8]. Growing evidence suggests that YC-1 and 2ME2
exert an inhibitory effect on the accumulation of HIF-1α induced
by hypoxia, iron chelation, and proteasomal inhibition [30–34].
YC-1 has widely been used as a HIF-1 blocker in research. It has
been demonstrated that YC-1 effectively inhibits HIF-1 expression
in heart [35], kidney [36], and brain [37]. YC-1 may directly
degrade HIF-1α protein by inducing the degradation of the
C-terminal of HIF-1α protein [38]. It can also suppress the

a
Failed MCAO: animals were excluded because of a lack of obvious neurological deﬁcit, which occurred when the suture was not placed at the right location to
block the middle cerebral artery (MCA).
b
Death after successful MCAO: occlusion of the MCA was successful but the
animal died primarily because of intracranial bleeding during the procedure. The
intracranial bleeds happened when the monoﬁlament suture was inserted too far
and perforated the anterior cerebral artery. When the bleed occurred, the animal
died from bleeding within the ﬁrst 2 h postreperfusion. For all the animals used for
ﬁnal analyses, no signs of hemorrhage were observed.

translation of HIF-1α through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/4E-BP pathway
[39]. YC-1 has been reported to inhibit the expression of HIF-1
downstream genes such as erythropoietin (EPO) and vascular
endothelial growth factor [32]. 2ME2 inhibits HIF-1α protein
synthesis by disrupting microtubules [40]. Both YC-1 and 2ME2
were used as complementary approaches to knockout in determining the effect of HIF-1. YC-1 (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor,
MI, USA) and 2ME2 (Enzo Life Science, Farmingdale, NY, USA) were
both dissolved in a solution of 1% DMSO in saline. YC-1 was
administered at 2 mg/kg body wt through the femoral vein at 24 h
and 30 min before the onset of ischemia. 2ME2 was administered
at 5 mg/kg body wt (ip) at 1 h before the onset of ischemia. Rats in
the control group received equal-volume injections (ip) of the
DMSO solution. We chose the dose of the HIF-1 inhibitors based
on previous publications [30,31] and our own analysis of HIF-1α
expression.
The HIF-1α knockout (HIF-1αΔ/Δ) male mice were randomly
assigned to two groups: MCAO group (n ¼6) and MCAO pretreated
with NAC (n ¼6). Twelve male littermates (HIF-1αF/F) were used as
controls and randomly assigned to two groups: MCAO group
(n ¼6) and MCAO pretreated with NAC (n¼ 6). In all four groups,
three mice were used for Western blotting analysis and three mice
were used for infarct size measurement by TTC. In mouse models
of MCAO/reperfusion, NAC was administered at 240 mg/kg (dissolved in saline) body weight (ip) at 30 min before the onset
of ischemia. The NAC dose for mice was calculated from the rat
dose using body surface area normalization [41]. Mice in control
and HIF-1α knockout groups received an equal volume of saline
injection (ip).
The effect of 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG;
AG Scientiﬁc, San Diego, CA, USA) was tested in the following groups
of mice: NAC (without MCAO, n¼ 3), 17-AAG (without MCAO, n¼ 3),
MCAO (n ¼3), MCAO pretreated with NAC (n ¼3), MCAO pretreated
with 17-AAG (n ¼3), and MCAO pretreated with 17-AAG þ NAC
(n ¼3). 17-AAG is a derivative of the antibiotic geldanamycin and is

widely used as a heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor. 17-AAG
was dissolved in a solution of 1% DMSO in saline and administered
at 25 mg/kg (ip) at 1 h before the onset of ischemia. Mice in
control and NAC groups received an equal volume of the DMSO
solution (ip).
Usually four or ﬁve animals were randomly selected for surgery
on a given day. A randomized block design was used: within each
day, each animal was allocated at random to one of the available
treatments. The following ﬁnal analyses were performed by
researchers who were blinded to the treatments and animal groups.
Western blotting and coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP)
At 24 h reperfusion, the animals were anesthetized and euthanized by decapitation. The ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres were isolated and homogenized separately for Western
blotting assay. We also collected peri-infarct brain tissues and the
corresponding region in the contralateral (nonischemic) side. The
peri-infarct region was identiﬁed using TTC staining in the control
MCAO rat model (90 min ischemia and 24 h reperfusion, no
pharmacological treatments) as described in our previous publication [42]. Brieﬂy, as marked in Fig. 2A, the ischemic peri-infarct
was selected on the one o’clock line in the ipsilateral cortex.
Tissues between the dashed lines (about 1.5 mm in width; Fig. 2A)
were isolated from the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres
and homogenized separately for Western blotting. The ﬁxed
location, as marked in Fig. 2A, was used for tissue isolation in
animals that received different pharmacological treatments. However, the location of peri-infarct varies from animal to animal,
especially in animals from different groups. The selected region of
treated animals may represent pathological states different from
that of the control MCAO rats. Standard Western blotting and co-IP
procedures were followed as described previously [30]. The
primary antibodies were rabbit anti-HIF-1α (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA), mouse anti-Hsp90 (SPA-830; Enzo Life Science), rabbit
anti-glucose transporter (GLUT-3; ab53095; Abcam, Cambridge,
MA, USA), and rabbit anti-EPO (sc-7956; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The secondary antibody for HIF-1α, GLUT-3,
and EPO was goat anti-rabbit IgG–horseradish peroxidase (HRP;
sc-2030; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The secondary antibody for
Hsp90 was goat anti-mouse IgG–HRP (sc-2030; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). β-Actin was used as an internal control.
Measurement of infarct size by magnetic resonance imaging and TTC
staining
The rats were transported to the MRI room next to the surgery
room at 24 h reperfusion and placed in the isocenter of the magnet
before the imaging session. MRI was performed on a 4.7-T
Biospecs MR scanner (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA, USA). An
actively shielded gradient coil with a 120-cm inner diameter was
used. The animals were kept in the same position throughout
imaging. For each animal, we performed T2-weighted MRI by
using a rapid acquisition with refocused echo sequence. Image
data were then transferred to a workstation running Linux for
further processing. From the T2-weighted magnetic resonance
images, we calculated the volume of infarction using ImageJ.
After MRI, the brains were removed and sectioned into 2-mm
slices. The slices were incubated in a 2% solution of TTC in 0.1 M
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) at 37 1C for 30 min and
ﬁxed in 10% formalin. TTC staining has been widely used to reﬂect
accurately the extent of irreversible ischemic damage in cerebral
tissues in rats [43]. TTC-stained brain sections were photographed
using a digital camera (Powershot 400 digital camera; Canon).
The infarct size was calculated; and the percentage of the infarct
area with respect to the total area was digitally quantiﬁed by

infarct area was calculated as previously described [44].
Mortality and neurological deﬁcits
Mortality was calculated at 24 h after MCAO/reperfusion. The
neurological scores were performed in a blinded fashion at 24 h,
based on a modiﬁed scoring standard of Rogers et al. [45]. We
excluded dead animals in the scoring scale.
Immunohistochemical staining
After 24 h reperfusion, rats/mice were transcardially perfused
with ice-cold PBS under anesthesia and then with 4% paraformaldehyde. After decapitation, the brains were isolated and ﬁxed
overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were then
embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek USA, Torrance, CA,
USA) and sectioned coronally at 10 μm thickness using a vibrating
microtome (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL, USA). Brain

sections were washed and the nonspeciﬁc binding sites were
blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and 0.25% bovine
serum albumin for 1 h. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with sections overnight at 4 1C [30].
Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-HIF-1α (04–1006; Millipore),
rabbit anti-GLUT-3 (ab53095; Abcam), rabbit anti-EPO (sc-7956;
Santa Cruz), and mouse anti-NeuN (MAB377; Millipore). Secondary antibodies were donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 488 and goat antimouse Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The
process for selecting the area of interest for imaging was detailed
in our previous publication [42]. The imaging location was selected
at per-infarct cortex based on TTC staining. As marked in Fig. 2A,
the squares indicate the selected area for imaging. Images were
routinely captured with a Leica DMI 4000B ﬂuorescence microscope. The original images were converted to 8-bit RBG and the
immunoreactivity of each image was analyzed with Image-Pro
Plus 5 (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA). Pixel intensity was
chosen to reﬂect changes in protein expression levels in neurons
over cell counts. The rationale was that HIF-1α might have been

extensively expressed in the neurons in ischemic brain without
NAC treatment [27], so the number of the HIF-1α-positive neurons
may not be able to reﬂect further changes in neuronal HIF-1α
expression in neurons such as those in the NAC-treated group. The
optical density approach is able to reﬂect further increases in the
protein content of HIF-1α-positive neurons. An approximate

threshold for pixel intensity was set and applied to images to
discriminate positive staining from background signal. Total
immunoreactivity was calculated by the area occupied by immunopositive pixels multiplied by the optical density of those pixels.
Five consecutive sections per animal were used for analysis.
Average values for each animal were used to generate mean values

for each treatment. All immunohistochemical staining data were
obtained and analyzed in a blinded manner.
Statistical analysis
Neurological score results are presented as median with range.
Other results are presented as mean with a standard error of
the mean. Comparisons of Western blotting, immunoreactivity,
and infarct volumes were carried out by ANOVA, followed by
Tukey’s correction (R 3.0.1). Neurological scores were compared
using Kruskal–Wallis analysis followed by Bonferroni correction.
A po 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. For the statistical analysis of mortality, the Fisher exact test was used.

Results
NAC enhanced global HIF-1α expression in ischemic brains
Previous reports have demonstrated that pretreatment with
NAC signiﬁcantly increased neuronal survival and reduced brain
infarct [4,7,8,46]. To investigate the mechanism of NAC’s neuroprotective effects during ischemia and reperfusion, NAC was
administrated (ip) to rats before the onset of MCAO in this study.
Fig. 1 shows Western blotting results of the overall levels of HIF-1α
and its downstream proteins in contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres. Ischemic exposure increased HIF-1α protein expression in
the ipsilateral hemisphere, compared to the contralateral one
(Figs. 1A and B). NAC further increased HIF-1α expression in the
ipsilateral brain tissues. NAC also upregulated the protein expression of EPO and GLUT-3, two downstream factors of HIF-1, in the
ipsilateral hemisphere (Figs. 1A–D). The results indicated that NAC
effectively enhanced HIF-1α protein accumulation and HIF-1
functional activity in the ischemic brains. In addition, it is of
interest to note that NAC also increased the HIF-1α expression in
the contralateral side, which is usually used as control in stroke
studies. To conﬁrm the effect of NAC on contralateral brain tissue,
we also administered NAC to rats that did not receive MCAO
(naïve animals). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2, NAC promoted HIF-1α expression in the naïve rats’ brains.
The above results were obtained using whole-hemisphere
homogenates and reﬂected the effect of NAC on the overall levels
of HIF-1α, EPO, and GLUT-3 in both hemispheres. We also
determined changes in the protein levels in selected peri-infarct
areas as marked in Fig. 2A. Results demonstrated that NAC
increased the protein levels of HIF-1α, EPO, and GLUT-3 in the
selected region (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, it needs to be
pointed out that we isolated the peri-infarct tissue of all the rats
from the ﬁxed location that was determined based on control
MCAO animals, which received no pharmacological treatments.
Because the drug treatments altered the brain infarction, the
selected region in the drug-treated animals might represent a
pathological state different from that of control rats. We do not
exclude the possibility that changes in HIF-1α and its target
protein levels might be a result of sampling tissues of different
viability. Nevertheless, these results from the selected brain region
provide additional insights into the effects of NAC on the expression of HIF-1α, EPO, and GLUT-3 in the ischemic brain.
One of the aims in this study was to determine the role of HIF-1
in NAC-mediated neuroprotection. Inhibiting HIF-1 activity would
conﬁrm speciﬁcally whether HIF-1 contributes to NAC’s effects.
YC-1 and 2ME2 are commonly used HIF-1α inhibitors. To inhibit
HIF-1, we chose double injections of YC-1 at 2 mg/kg based on our
previous report of HIF-1α inhibition [30]. It has been shown that
2ME2 (5 mg/kg. ip) could successfully decrease HIF-1α levels in rat
[31]. To successfully inhibit HIF-1α expression in the NAC group,

13

the inhibitors were administered before the injection of NAC. Both
inhibitors at the tested doses effectively suppressed HIF-1α, EPO,
and GLUT-3 expression in ischemic brains (Figs. 1A–D). It is
noteworthy that YC-1 and 2ME2 were able to inhibit HIF-1α
expression in the presence of NAC in the contralateral sides (Fig. 1)
and in the brains of naïve rats (Supplementary Fig. S2).
NAC elevated neuronal HIF-1α expression in ischemic brains
As ischemia causes devastating neuronal death in stroke, it was
of great interest to determine if NAC enhanced the expression of
HIF-1α in neurons. As illustrated in Fig. 2, HIF-1α protein accumulation primarily occurred in the NeuN (neuronal marker)positive cells in the selected area of the ipsilateral hemispheres.
The intensity of HIF-1α immunostaining was further increased in
the ipsilateral side of the brains of NAC-treated rats. Moreover, the
neuronal expression of EPO and GLUT-3 was signiﬁcantly
increased in the ipsilateral neurons of NAC-treated rats, compared
to control rats (Figs. 3A and B, Supplementary Fig. S5). The
ipsilateral expression of all three proteins (HIF-1α, EPO, and
GLUT-3) was remarkably reduced by the HIF-1α inhibitors, YC-1
and 2ME2, in either NAC-treated or control rats. The above results
demonstrate that NAC remarkably enhanced HIF-1α and its downstream genes expression in neurons in the ipsilateral hemisphere
of an ischemic brain.
HIF-1 was responsible for NAC-mediated neuroprotection against
ischemic brain injury
To determine the role of HIF-1 in NAC’s neuroprotection in
ischemic stroke, we ﬁrst evaluated NAC’s protective effects against
ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury by T2-weighted MRI
and TTC staining. Fig. 4A shows a series of brain sections of a rat
subjected to 90 min MCAO and 24 h reperfusion. The brain infarct
volume was calculated based on the area of hyperintensity of the
MR images. As shown in Figs. 4A and B, administration of NAC at
150 mg/kg signiﬁcantly reduced the infarct volume (140.2 7
18.8 mm3), compared to the control group (226.0 726.1 mm3;
p¼ 0.0135). Consistent with the T2-weighted MRI data, the infarct
volume measured by TTC-staining also demonstrated that NAC
signiﬁcantly reduced the brain infarction (p ¼0.0007). These
results were in line with previous reports that NAC is neuroprotective in ischemic stroke [4–7,19,47].
Fig. 4 also demonstrated that inhibiting HIF-1α remarkably
augmented ischemia-induced brain damage. YC-1 and 2ME2
increased the infarct volume estimated by T2-weighted MRI from
226.07 26.1 to 481.6 727.7 and 477.8724.1 mm3, respectively
(p o0.0001). No signiﬁcant difference was observed among YC-1,
YC-1 þ NAC, 2ME2, and 2ME2 þNAC groups, indicating that NAC
failed to provide protection against cerebral ischemia in the
presence of YC-1 or 2ME2. Results from TTC staining showed
similar effects. It is noteworthy that YC-1 and 2ME2 massively
enlarged the infarcts, indicating their toxic effect was beyond just
abolishing NAC's neuroprotective effects.
We further determined the functional recovery of rats subjected to NAC and HIF-1 inhibitor treatments by behavioral
assessment according to Rogers et al. [45]. NAC treatment signiﬁcantly decreased the median neurological scores from 3 (range
2–4) in control rats to 2 (range 1–3) (control, n¼ 22; NAC, n ¼23;
p¼ 0.0097; Fig. 4D). However, NAC was not able to alleviate
neurological abnormalities when HIF-1 activity was inhibited by
YC-1 or 2ME2. In addition, two animals were dead in the control
group, and one dead was observed in the NAC-treated groups
(Table 1). The treatment with NAC, YC-1, or 2ME2 alone did not
cause death in negative control animals (without MCAO, data not
shown).

Neuron-speciﬁc HIF-1α knockout abolished NAC-mediated
neuroprotection in ischemic brains
The above results demonstrate that the pharmacological HIF-1α
inhibitors YC-1 and 2ME2 abolished NAC’s neuroprotection in the
ischemic brains. We further studied the speciﬁc role of HIF-1 in NACmediated neuroprotection with neuron-speciﬁc HIF-1α-knockout
mice (HIF-1αΔ/Δ). CAMKII-dependent Cre expression removed the
lox-HIF-1α-lox cassette in the genome of neurons of HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice

(Fig. 5A). To evaluate the efﬁciency of HIF-1α ablation in neurons of
the HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice, we used immunostaining to visualize HIF-1α
expression in NeuN-positive cells in the ipsilateral hemisphere of a
mouse brain after 90 min MCAO and 24 h reperfusion. HIF-1α
expression was diminished in the majority of neurons in HIF-1αΔ/Δ
mice (Supplementary Fig. S6). Postischemic accumulation of HIF-1α,
GLUT-3, and EPO was signiﬁcantly attenuated in the HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice
compared with controls (HIF-1αF/F; Figs. 5B and C). Moreover, NAC
administration failed to increase the expression of HIF-1α and its

target genes in ischemic brains of HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice. We observed
increased infarction in HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice compared with wild-type
controls (Figs. 5D and E). Pretreatment with NAC signiﬁcantly
reduced the infarct volume in control mice (50% decrease from
63.075.6 to 33.376.7 mm3, p¼0.0316), but not in HIF-1αΔ/Δ mice
(HIF-1αΔ/Δ, 83.777.5 mm3; HIF-1αΔ/Δ þNAC, 76.375.5 mm3,

p¼ 0.8421). The results further conﬁrmed that NAC’s neuroprotective
effects were suppressed by HIF-1α inhibition, indicating that HIF-1 is
highly involved in NAC’s protection against ischemic brain injury. It is
noteworthy that, compared to the rat MCAO model with NAC
treatment that had infarct mainly in the striatum, the mouse model’s
damage was restricted largely in the cortex.

Hsp90 was involved in NAC-mediated HIF-1α upregulation in
ischemic brains
We then investigated the mechanism underlying NAC-induced
HIF-1α upregulation in ischemic brains. Previous studies have
shown that Hsp90 is able to bind and stabilize HIF-1α [48].
We postulated that NAC might increase HIF-1α protein levels by
promoting the expression and chaperone activities of Hsp90. We
therefore determined the Hsp90 protein level and Hsp90–HIF-1α
interaction in NAC-treated MCAO models. As we expected, NAC
administration signiﬁcantly upregulated Hsp90 expression in the
ipsilateral hemispheres of MCAO mice (Figs. 6A and D). Meanwhile, NAC also increased the amount of Hsp90 pulled down by
anti-HIF-1α antibody (Figs. 6A and B), indicating that NAC
enhanced the association between Hsp90 and HIF-1α. The results
strongly supported the concept that NAC-induced HIF-1α upregulation was accompanied by increased Hsp90 expression and
strengthened Hsp90–HIF-1α interaction.
To better evaluate the contribution of Hsp90 to NAC-mediated
HIF-1α upregulation, we inhibited Hsp90 activity with 17-AAG,
which is blood–brain barrier permeative and speciﬁcally binds to
Hsp90 [49]. As shown in Fig. 6A, 17-AAG remarkably reduced the
interaction of Hsp90 with HIF-1α and suppressed HIF-1α protein
expression. It completely abolished the HIF-1α upregulation in
NAC-treated ischemic mouse brains, suggesting that Hsp90 was
involved in NAC-induced HIF-1α accumulation. Furthermore,
17-AAG signiﬁcantly increased the infarction in control and NACtreated animals subjected to 90 min MCAO and 24 h reperfusion
(Fig. 7). In conclusion, our results suggest that NAC promoted
HIF-1α stabilization by increasing Hsp90 protein expression and
the Hsp90–HIF-1α interaction.

Discussion
Many previous studies have demonstrated that NAC protects
against cellular injury from various stresses including ischemia.
The beneﬁcial effect of NAC has been largely attributed to its
antioxidant properties, speciﬁcally speaking, to its ability to reduce
ROS and lipid peroxidation. In this study, we deﬁned a new
mechanism (i.e., upregulating the protein level of HIF-1α) by
which NAC exerts its protective effect against ischemic insults.
As an antioxidant, NAC alters the cellular redox environment,
which plays a critical role in normal cellular functions. HIF-1α, the
unstable subunit of HIF-1, can be strongly regulated by the cellular
redox environment. For example, excessive ROS disrupt HIF-1α
accumulation such as in HeLa cells [22] and renal medullary
interstitial cells [50]. In contrast, antioxidants such as NAC have
been reported to stabilize HIF-1α in epithelial cells [51] and in
primary culture cortical neurons as demonstrated in our previous
study [24]. However, it was not known whether NAC stabilizes
HIF-1α in ischemic brain. In line with these observations, this
study, for the ﬁrst time, showed that NAC administration increased
the protein expression of HIF-1α and its target genes EPO and
GLUT-3 [52] in the ipsilateral side of an ischemic brain. More
importantly, HIF-1 inhibition diminished the neuroprotection by
NAC, substantiating the involvement of HIF-1 in NAC’s protective
effects. These results clearly present that upregulating HIF-1
activity is a new function of NAC in ischemic brain.
We also determined the level of HIF-1α protein in a speciﬁc
region of an ischemic brain, the peri-infarct region deﬁned in
control MCAO rats (90 min ischemia and 24 h reperfusion). The
peri-infarct region is at risk for delayed neuronal death owing
to the deleterious metabolic processes propagated from the
ischemic core to the neighboring tissue, including excitotoxicity,
oxidative stress, and inﬂammation [53]. The surviving neurons in

17

the peri-infarct region directly contribute to behavioral recovery
after stroke [54,55]. Previous studies have demonstrated that HIF1α induction reduced cell death of neurons located in the periinfarct region [56]. Thus, the peri-infarct tissue is a crucial
neuroprotection target, and it is ideal to deﬁne how NAC alters
HIF-1α expression in this region. Our results showed that NAC
upregulated the protein levels of HIF-1α, GLUT-3, and EPO in the
peri-infarct brain region. However, results from the selected periinfarct brain tissue have limitations. The ﬁxed brain region was
identiﬁed based on control MCAO animals. We isolated the
samples from the same location as peri-infarct in animals that
received different treatments. Actually, the location of the periinfarct area varies between animals, and it moves especially when
the treatment induces neuroprotection. As a result, the selected
brain region that represented the peri-infarct region in control
MCAO animals did not necessarily represent the peri-infarct
region in animals that received different treatments. For example,
the selected brain tissue in NAC-treated rats might be more
normal (healthier) than that in control rats. The measurement of
the protein level in whole-hemisphere homogenates avoided the
issue of peri-infarct shifting in the various groups. The Western
blotting results of whole hemisphere reﬂected the effects of NAC
on the overall levels of HIF-1α, EPO, and GLUT-3 in whole ischemic
hemisphere including infarct core, peri-infarct regions, and nonischemic remote areas. Many previous studies have used wholehemisphere homogenates to determine protein expression in
contra- and ipsilateral sides of ischemic brains [27,57–60]. Our
results demonstrated that NAC enhanced HIF-1α expression in the
ipsilateral side. It is noteworthy that NAC also enhanced HIF-1α
and its target gene expression in the contralateral side, suggesting
that NAC’s effect on HIF-1α is independent of its neuroprotection.
Furthermore, our study showed that NAC failed to reduce the brain
infarction in HIF-1α-knockout mice, which indicates that NAC’s
neuroprotective effect depends on increasing HIF-1α expression.
Both aspects of the experimental evidence support that HIF-1α
upregulation is the mediator of NAC’s neuroprotection, rather than
the consequence.
Although it is known that redox regulates HIF-1α expression in
many cells as discussed above, the mechanism responsible for the
regulation is far from completely understood. Hsp90 is among the
most abundant proteins in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. As
chaperone, Hsp90 prevents the aggregation of unfolded proteins
induced by stresses such as heat shock and ischemia. It has been
shown that Hsp90 interacts with transcription factors with the
bHLH-PAS domain, such as Sim and Ahrhr. HIF-1α is a transcription factor containing the bHLH-PAS domain, suggesting that
Hsp90 may interact with HIF-1α. In fact, Isaacs et al. [61] have
shown that Hsp90 antagonist inhibits HIF-1α expression and
reduces its target gene mRNA. Therefore, we postulated that NAC
might stabilize HIF-1α by promoting its interaction with Hsp90.
Indeed, we found that NAC administration upregulated the Hsp90
protein level by 27.3% and enhanced the interaction between
Hsp90 and HIF-1α in the ipsilateral hemisphere of an ischemic
brain. Given the fact that Hsp90’s chaperoning capacity vastly
exceeds the demand for more than 200 client targets under
normal conditions [62,63], this moderate increase in Hsp90
protein level and interaction may sufﬁciently account for the 54%
increase in the HIF-1α protein level (Fig. 6). The Hsp90 inhibitor
17-AAG attenuated the interaction between Hsp90 and HIF-1α
although it did not reduce Hsp90 protein expression in ischemic
brains. The fact that 17-AAG inhibited HIF-1α upregulation in the
presence of NAC indicated that Hsp90 activity was required for
NAC-induced HIF-1α accumulation. However, the mechanism of
NAC-mediated Hsp90 upregulation is not known. Suppressing
oxidation or other properties of NAC may contribute to the
upregulation, which warrants further investigation.

In this study, we demonstrated that the neuroprotective effect
of NAC was largely mediated by HIF-1α induction and HIF-1
activation. Although we have provided data to show that Hsp90

is involved in the stabilization of HIF-1α by NAC, it is not known
how exactly NAC promotes the interaction between Hsp90 and
HIF-1α and stabilizes HIF-1α. We postulate that NAC, an

antioxidant, may do so by maintaining redox homeostasis in
ischemic brains. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S4, NAC, which
increased the GSH/GSSG ratio, induced signiﬁcant expression of
HIF-1α in peri-infarct. L-Buthionine sulfoxide (BSO), which
decreased the GSH/GSSG ratio, decreased HIF-1α expression in
the peri-infarct. Moreover, NAC increased HIF-1α expression in the
contralateral side (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S4) as well as in
the brain of naïve animals (Supplementary Fig. S2). BSO decreased
the level of HIF-1α in the contralateral side although no signiﬁcance was observed owing to low basal levels of HIF-1α in normal
brain tissue. The opposite effects of NAC and BSO indicate that NAC
might upregulate HIF-1α by reducing oxidants. These results are in
line with our previous observation on primary cultured neurons
[24]. In the previous studies, we investigated the relationships
between HIF-1α expression, ROS, and redox status in neurons.
We observed low levels of HIF-1α protein expression in the
neurons exposed to in vitro ischemic conditions that had high
levels of ROS (oxidizing environments), and vice versa. NAC
induced HIF-1α protein expression in hypoxic neurons and BSO
inhibited the expression. Moreover, (  )-epicatechin gallate, an
ROS scavenger, elevated HIF-1α expression in the neurons subjected to in vitro ischemia. Taken together, these data indicate that
NAC may promote HIF-1α stabilization by suppressing ROS and
maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Evaluation on oxidative
stress levels in the experimental groups and effects of other
antioxidants on HIF-1 would provide more evidence for the
concept, which needs to be investigated in future studies.
There were several considerations for using YC-1 and 2ME2 in
this study. First, the two compounds are the most speciﬁc
inhibitors available. Second, they have been widely used to inhibit
HIF-1 activity [31–41]. Third, as in previous publications, they
provided effective HIF-1 inhibition. Fourth, they were included in
this study to complement the HIF-1α-knockout model. The results

demonstrated that the effects of these drugs were enormous on
infarct volume, indicating they may act on other pathways that
exacerbate brain injury after MCAO. The effects of YC-1 and 2ME2
were so enormous that the effects of NAC were completely
saturated by the HIF-1 inhibitors. These are novel ﬁndings regarding the two commonly used HIF-1 inhibitors in ischemic brain.
To some extent, the effects of the two HIF-1 inhibitors provided
evidence to support the concept that NAC lost its protective effect
in the MCAO models in the presence of either of the two drugs
although other unidentiﬁed pathways were obviously involved. In
addition, we found that genetic inactivation of HIF-1α resulted
in lower infarct volume augmentation than pharmacological
inhibition of HIF-1α (Figs. 4A and 5D). This might be due to the
activation of compensatory pathways in response to HIF-1α
deletion and alteration of non-HIF-1 pathways by the inhibitors.
For example, a previous study reported higher basal protein level
of HIF-2α and an enhanced upregulation of HIF-2α under hypoxia
in HIF-1α-knockout brains [27]. The upregulation of HIF-2α may
partially substitute for the loss of HIF-1α function and participate
in neuroprotection in the ischemic brain. YC-1 and 2ME2 are able
to downregulate the α subunit of both HIF-1 and HIF-2 [40,64],
and as the result, they augment infarct volume further than the
HIF-1α gene inactivation approach. Overall, the data obtained
from knockout mice are evident that NAC mediates its neuroprotection by regulating HIF-1 activity with support from the results
of YC-1 and 2ME2.
HIF-1’s role in cerebral ischemia is still arguable. Accumulating
evidence shows that induction of HIF-1 provides protection
against cerebral ischemic damage in adult animals [56,65,66] as
well as neonatal models [67]. The protective function of HIF-1
mainly results from a broad range of genes that HIF-1 regulates.
The gene expression facilitates the adaptation to low-oxygen
conditions [68]. As demonstrated in this study, enhanced

20

Z. Zhang et al. / Free Radical Biology and Medicine 68 (2014) 8–21

expression of HIF-1 by NAC induced the expression of EPO and
GLUT-3, which facilitate cell survival and oxygen and glucose
transport. However, others have reported detrimental effects of
HIF-1 in models of hypoxia and cerebral ischemia [69–71]. The
discrepancy of these observations may be partly explained by
distinctive effects of HIF-1 at different severities of ischemia. For
example, HIF-1 is neuroprotective in a 30-min transient MCAO
model [27], whereas it is harmful in a 75-min model of bilateral
common carotid artery occlusion [69]. Given the effect of NAC on
HIF-1 expression, NAC (or other antioxidants) may have different
effects on neurons under different ischemic conditions. Future
studies on this aspect may help design therapeutic approaches for
speciﬁc conditions of ischemia.
In the translational aspect, this study provides novel insight into
the mechanism of NAC's prophylactic effect on ischemic brain
injury. NAC is a commercially available supplement. It is of interest
to know its effects when taken prophylactically. The pretreatment
dose of NAC used in this study is comparable to those of previous
studies. For example, Niu et al. [7] reported that pretreatment with
NAC at 150 mg/kg could prevent death-associated protein from
trafﬁcking and increase the number of the surviving CA1 pyramidal
cells of the hippocampus at 5 days of reperfusion. Pretreatment
with NAC 30 min before transient forebrain ischemia successfully
increased the neuronal survival in rats [8]. Results by Zhang et al.
[46] showed that at a dose of 100 mg/kg, pretreatment with NAC
distinctly inhibited the association of postsynaptic density protein
95 with kainate receptor glutamate receptor 6 and ameliorated
brain injury induced by ischemia. Sekhon et al. [4] reported that
animals pretreated with NAC at 150 mg/kg showed a 49.7% reduction in brain infarct volume and 50% reduction in the neurological
evaluation score compared to untreated animals. Meanwhile, posttreatment with NAC has also been shown to be neuroprotective in
ischemic brains at a similar dose range [5,19,72]. For instance, a
single dose of NAC given 15 min after trauma might be effective on
lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme activity, and neuronal protection in cerebral injury after closed head trauma [72]. However,
the present study using pretreatment only has its limitations and
caveats and provides no direct evidence to reveal the mechanism of
NAC's neuroprotective effect in postinjury treatment. It is of interest
and clinically relevant in future studies to determine the possible
mechanism of neuroprotection by NAC treatment after the occurrence of ischemia.
In summary, our data provide evidence that pretreatment with
NAC upregulates HIF-1 activity in ischemic brains and demonstrate
for the ﬁrst time that NAC-induced neuroprotection against ischemia
is dependent on HIF-1 activity. Moreover, the results reveal a new
pathway through which NAC augments HIF-1 activity by enhancing
Hsp90 expression and Hsp90–HIF-1α interaction. Our study suggests
a new mechanism through which NAC protects stroke-induced brain
injury, which may further improve the chances of identifying
promising therapeutic approaches in future studies.
