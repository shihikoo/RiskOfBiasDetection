Introduction

Strokes are the result of inadequate blood supply to the brain
due to either a blocked blood supply or a ruptured brain
aneurysm. The most common forms of a stroke are ischemic
in nature; approximately 70% of all strokes are ischemic and
the result of either a thrombus or embolism that leads to the
immediate loss of oxygen and glucose in a particular brain
area (Silvestrelli et al., 2002). If applied within a critical time
window, endovascular procedures and thrombolytic agents
can prevent signiﬁcant neurological and functional deﬁcits.
However, although the restoration of blood circulation to
ischemic brain tissue is necessary for the recovery of normal
function, it is possible that an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)
injury will occur. I/R injury strongly affects neurons and
eventually leads to cell death, but the mechanisms by which
I/R injury induces cell death remain unclear.
In addition to directly causing brain damage, I/R injury
triggers ER stress. The ER stress that occurs with I/R injury is
associated with the increased expressions of ER stress markers such as CATT/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), and glucose-regulated
protein 78 (GRP78) (Duan et al., 2010; Morimoto et al., 2007;
Nakka et al., 2010). These markers are also induced by
increases in calcium (Ca2þ) and reactive oxygen species
(ROS) levels (Zhang and Kaufman, 2008; Zhang, 2010). A
number of studies have shown that ER stress is a critical
component of pro-apoptotic signaling and the sensing of
damage in the brain (Ferri and Kroemer, 2001; Li et al.,
2006). Moreover, recent evidence has indicated that ER stress
plays a critical role in brain damage after I/R injury (Nakka
et al., 2010) and that this damage is attenuated by the
inhibition of ER stress-induced apoptosis (Tajiri et al., 2004).
Nafamostat mesilate (NM), a type of serine protease
inhibitor, is used to treat patients suffering from disseminative blood vessel coagulation, hemorrhagic lesions, and
hemorrhagic tendencies. NM also improves acute pancreatitis by preventing the formation of blood clots in extracorporeal circulation (Akizawa et al., 1993; Iwaki et al., 1986),
possesses anti-inﬂammatory capabilities, decreases the production of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO),
inhibits apoptosis, and lowers the levels of interleukin (IL)-6
and IL-8 in cultured human trophoblasts (Nakatsuka et al.,
2000). Furthermore, NM prevents the activation of nuclear
factor kappa-B (NF-κB), inhibits the activities of intercellular
adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (Fujiwara et al.,
2011), and induces the caspase-8-mediated apoptosis of
pancreatic cancer cells (Furukawa et al., 2010). However, the
effects of NM on brain damage after I/R injury have yet to be
fully elucidated. Therefore, the present study investigated the
protective effects of NM in brain tissue following I/R injury

and attempted to determine whether the inhibition of ER
stress-induced brain damage by NM is the mechanism underlying this effect.

Results

2.1.
NM decreased infarct size, brain swelling, and
neurological deﬁcit scores after transient MCAO
To investigate the neuroprotective impact of NM on acute
cerebral infarctions in rats, its effects were examined in a rat
model of transient MCAO; representative images of brain
slices obtained 24 h after the transient MCAO procedure are
provided (Fig. 1A). Compared to the sham group, rats in the
MCAO group exhibited a signiﬁcant increase in the size of the
infarct 24 h after I/R injury (Fig. 1A). However, the infarct size
was signiﬁcantly smaller in the NM-treated MCAO group
compared to the MCAO group. The mean areas of the infarcts
in the slices from the MCAO and NM-treated MCAO groups
were 24.3771.75%, 30.8773.00%, 31.6273.25%, 21.3772.00%,
and 9.8772.25% and 3.4273.46%, 6.6271.3%, 7.1772.8%,
1.2971.0%, and 0% of the total brain areas, respectively
(% infarct area ¼ infarctsize
totalsize 100). Additionally, there was a signiﬁcant increase in brain water content in the MCAO group,
but this was markedly decreased by treatment with NM
(Fig. 1B). These ﬁndings indicate that NM inhibits infarct size
and brain edema following transient MCAO in rats.

2.2.
NM improved neurological deﬁcits after transient
MCAO
To determine the effects of NM treatment on I/R-induced
neurobehavioral deﬁcits after transient MCAO, the neurological deﬁcit scores of each group were compared using
Garcia’s method (Garcia et al., 1995). The MCAO group had a
lower neurological deﬁcit score (8.0470.39) than the sham
group (14.1970.46) but NM treatment signiﬁcantly increased
the score of the NM-treated MCAO group (11.2670.51; Fig. 1C).
This suggests that NM enhanced the neurological deﬁcit
scores of rats after transient MCAO.

2.3.

NM enhanced neurosurvival after transient MCAO

To determine whether NM increased neurosurvival after
transient MCAO-induced ischemic brain injury, a FluoroJade B staining procedure was performed. Fluoro-Jade B-positive neurons were observed in the penumbra and ipsilateral
region 24 h after transient MCAO (Fig. 2A2, A3, A5 and A6) but
there was a decrease in positive cells in the penumbra and
ipsilateral region in the NM treated-MCAO group relative to
the MCAO group (Fig. 2B2, B3, B5 and B6).

Microglia and astrocytes are activated in association with
the neuroinﬂammatory response following ischemic brain
injury (Williams et al., 2007). Therefore, the activation of
microglia and astrocytes following transient MCAO was
analyzed by immunohistochemistry using anti-iba-1 and
anti-GFAP antibodies, respectively. In the contralateral hemisphere, iba-1 immunoreactive microglia were in their resting
form (Fig. 3A1). In the ipsilateral hemisphere, Iba-1 immunoreactive microglia showed activated cell morphology, with
enlarged cell bodies and thicker processes (Fig. 3A2). In MCAO
group with NM treatment; however, microglia activation was
notably suppressed (Fig. 3A4). Similarly, astrocytes activation
in the ipsilateral cortex of MCAO group was also attenuated
in NM treated-MCAO group (Figs. 3B2 and 4). These ﬁndings
indicate that NM has a protective effect against ischemic
brain injury that occurs via the activation of microglia and
astrocytes.

2.4.
NM attenuated the ER stress response following
transient MCAO
GRP78 and CHOP are markers of ER stress, which is an early
event associated with MCAO-induced damage in brain cells.
Thus, to determine whether NM would affect ischemia-

induced ER stress, the present study assessed the expression
levels of GRP78 and CHOP using immunoblot analyses of the
penumbra after transient MCAO. The MCAO group exhibited
a signiﬁcant increase in the expressions of GRP78 and CHOP,
while NM treatment downregulated these expression levels
(Fig. 4A and B).
Next, because it regulates CHOP expression, the present
study determined whether NM treatment would inhibit the
expression level of p-eIF2α after transient MCAO using
immunoblot analyses of the penumbra. There was a signiﬁcant increase in the expression level of p-eIF2α in the MCAO
group; in contrast, NM treatment decreased this expression
(Fig. 4C).

Discussion

The present ﬁndings demonstrate that NM exerted neuroprotective effects in a rat model of focal cerebral I/R injury by
decreasing infarct size and improving neurological deﬁcits.
Furthermore, NM treatment inhibited the neurological
response to ER stress after transient MCAO, resulted in a
decreased number of Fluoro-Jade B-positive neurons, and
attenuated the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the

increase in the number of Fluoro-Jade B-positive neurons in the ipsilateral (A2 and A5) and penumbra (A3 and A6) regions of
the MCAO group. NM treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the number of Fluoro-Jade B-positive neurons in the ipsilateral (B2 and
B5) and penumbra (B3 and B6) regions. The bar graph represents the number of Fluoro-Jade B-positive cells in the cerebral
cortex. All data are presented as means7standard deviation of three independent experiments. *po0.05. NM: nafamostat

penumbra and ipsilateral region. These ﬁndings suggest that
NM is protective against cerebral I/R injury via the amelioration of degenerating neurons in in the penumbra and ipsilateral region.
Following the reperfusion process that took place 2 h after
the ischemia procedure, I/R injury was evident in the brains
of the rats. These results are consistent with a previous
report that 2 h of ischemia followed by reperfusion is associated with maximal infarct expansion that increases with
the duration of reperfusion (Nakka et al., 2010). Fluoro-Jade B
is a ﬂuorescein derivative that selectively stains neurons
undergoing degeneration after transient focal ischemia
(Benedek et al., 2006). The present study observed a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of nonviable neurons in the
penumbra and ipsilateral regions in the NM-treated MCAO
group compared with the MCAO group. This ﬁnding agrees
with the changes in infarct volumes that were determined by
TTC staining as well as the activation of microglia and
astrocytes. These data indicate that the neuroprotective
effects of NM treatment are likely associated with a reduction
in the degeneration of damaged neurons.
It is well known that NM, a serine protease inhibitor, exerts
anticoagulant effects via its action on the blood coagulation
factors IX, X, XIIa, and VIIa (Hitomi et al., 1985). In addition to
its anticoagulant effects, NM inhibits inﬂammatory responses,
suppresses LPS-induced NO overexpression and apoptosis,

and reduces levels of IL-6 and IL-8 (Nakatsuka et al., 2000;
Noguchi et al., 2003). NM also acts as an inhibitor of kallikrein,
a type of serine protease, which makes it an effective antiinﬂammatory or anti-ﬁbrinolytic drug (Hitomi et al., 1985;
Iwama et al., 1998). Stroke and focal cerebral ischemia induce
inﬂammation that is mediated by cytokines, adhesion molecules, chemokines, and leukocytes (Huang et al., 2006) which,
in turn, leads to the activation of microglia and astrocytes. In
the present study, NM reduced infarct size and improved
neurological deﬁcits following a transient MCAO procedure
and it is likely that these effects were associated with the NMinduced inhibition of microglia and astrocyte activation. In
other words, the attenuation of ischemia-induced inﬂammation by NM may be responsible for the neurological improvements observed after brain injury as well as the enhancement
of functional recovery. Furthermore, the present results suggest that NM is a possible target molecule for therapies that
ameliorate stroke injury.
Cerebral ischemia, such as stroke, can lead to apoptosis or
the impairment of neuronal cells than other glial cells,
because neurons are more vulnerable than glia to insults
such as ischemia, hypoxia and brain trauma (Oshiro et al.,
2008; Peng et al., 1998). The present study demonstrated that
NM has neuroprotective effects and reduces infarct size after
I/R injury and, thus, NM may also inhibit the death of
neuronal cells. The involvement of ischemia-associated

processes, which is resting form (A1), toward enlarged cell bodies and thicker processes, which showed typical microglial

hypertrophical cytoplasm and thickened processes (B2). (A4 and B4) NM treatment after MCAO inhibited the activation of
microglia and astrocytes in the infarct area relative to the MCAO group. The bar graphs represent the immunohistochemical

astrocyte activation that inﬂuence tissue viability, including
glutamate homeostasis, water balance, maintenance of the
blood–brain barrier, regulation of cerebral blood ﬂow, and
secretion of neuroprotective factors, is well known (Goldstein,
1988; Papadopoulos and Verkman, 2007; Schousboe and
Waagepetersen, 2005; Trendelenburg and Dirnagl, 2005).
Additionally, the neuroprotective function of microglia activation was suggested in previous studies MyD88 and IKKβ
deletion mice (Cho et al., 2008; Simard and Rivest, 2007). In
the present study, NM inhibited the activation of astrocytes
and microglia in the penumbra and ipsilateral region after
transient MCAO. Although the transient MCAO procedure
induced neuronal degeneration, it was markedly blocked by
treatment with NM. The present ﬁndings that there was a
reduction in activation of astrocytes and microglia following
NM treatment is strong evidence for its role in the prevention
and/or improvement of brain damage after transient MCAO.
Previous studies have shown that ER stress plays a key
role in the mediation of the ischemia-induced neuronal
degeneration. For example, I/R injury induces neuronal
apoptosis in the penumbra and upregulates the expression
of ER stress markers, including GRP78 and CHOP (Wu et al.,
2013). On the other hand, CHOP expression can be regulated
by GRP78; the overexpression of GRP78 decreases the

induction of CHOP, attenuates cell death (Fu et al., 2008),
and blocks ER stress (Rao et al., 2002). Similarly, the present
study found that transient MCAO increased GRP78 and CHOP
expression levels but that these levels markedly decreased
following NM treatment. Therefore, it is suggested here that
the neuroprotective effects of NM are associated with its
inhibition of CHOP expression and an enhancement of
endogenous GRP78 activity in neuronal cells via inhibition
of activation of microglia and astrocytes.
In the brain injury induced by ER stress, CHOP induction is
regulated by the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 pathway via an unfolded
protein response (Zhang and Kaufman, 2008). If eIF2α is
activated by ischemia, it can not only lead to increases in a
number of transcription factors but also the induction of
ATF4 and CHOP (DeGracia and Montie, 2004), which would
result in the initiation of apoptosis signaling cascades. In the
present study, transient MCAO instigated the activation of
eIF2α, which was signiﬁcantly inhibited by NM. Therefore, the
present ﬁndings suggest that NM can attenuate the activation
of eIF2α and lead to the inhibition of CHOP activity and cell
apoptosis.
In conclusion, the present data provide experimental
evidence that NM was protective against cerebral I/R-induced
brain damage via inhibition of the ER stress response and an

attenuation of the activation of astrocytes and microglia.
These results suggest that NM is a promising potential target
for therapeutic regimens following stroke.

Experimental procedure

4.1.

Animals

University regarding the use and care of animals. All animals
were housed in a standard environment with a 12:12-h light/
dark cycle, a constant room temperature maintained between
20–25 1C, and 40–60% humidity. Food and water were supplied ad libitum.

4.2.

The present study utilized male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats
(Samtako; Osan, Korea) that were 9 weeks of age and had
body weights between 250 and 280 g. All experimental procedures adhered to the policies of Chungnam National

Drug administration and surgery

The rats were divided into three groups: sham, middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and MCAO with NM
(1 mg/kg, Sigma; St. Louis, MO, USA). All drugs were intravenously injected into the tail vein 30 min prior to and 30 min
after surgery. The MCAO procedure was performed by

18

brain research 1627 (2015) 12–20

occluding the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) for 60 min
using a modiﬁed intraluminal-suture insertion method in
which a nylon ﬁlament was introduced into the MCA. The
right common carotid artery was exposed and a 4–0 monoﬁlament nylon suture (Docol Corporation; Sharon, MA, USA)
was inserted via the external carotid artery (ECA) into the
internal carotid artery and the MCA 20–22 mm from the
carotid bifurcation. The neck incision was then closed and
the suture was removed after 120 min. Subsequently, each
animal was tested using a standardized neurological scaling
system (Garcia et al., 1995) to conﬁrm the presence of typical
neurological deﬁcits; rats that did not show initial contralateral paralysis were excluded from the study. All rats in the
sham group were subjected to the same surgical procedure
but the nylon suture was advanced for only 10 mm and then
immediately withdrawn.

4.3.

Neurological scores

The neurological scores of each group were measured using
Garcia’s neurological score method. The behavior of each rat
was assessed using six independent criteria: spontaneous
activity, symmetry of movements, outstretching of the forelimbs, wall climbing, reaction to body touch, and response to
touching of the vibrissae. The results of the ﬁrst three tests
were graded from 0 (severe deﬁcit) to 3 (no deﬁcit) while the
latter three tests had a low score of 1; the total score for each
rat ranged from 3 to 18 points.

4.4.

Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining

To determine the volumes of the infarcts, the rats were
decapitated 24 h after the performance of the post-ischemic
reperfusion that followed the MCAO. Each brain was removed
and sliced in coronal sections (2.0 mm thick) using a Rat brain
slicer (Zivic Instruments; pittsburgh, PA, USA). Five brain
slices from each rat were incubated in 2% (w/v) triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution for 20 min at 37 1C and then
transferred to a 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution for
ﬁxation. Normal brain tissue was uniformly red in color,
whereas the infarcted regions were whitish. The postﬁxation brain slices from each rat were photographed and
the extents of the whitish infarct areas were calculated using
the Adobe Photoshop CS imaging system; the infarct volume
was calculated as the percentage of the total brain area of
each section.

4.5.

Extent of brain edema

To determine brain water content, the animals were decapitated 24 h after the performance of the post-ischemic reperfusion that followed the MCAO. For this procedure, whole
brains were obtained and the right hemispheres were quickly
isolated. Each sample was weighed on an electronic balance
and dried in an oven at 100 1C for 24 h. Next, each sample was
weighed precisely and the water content (percentage value)

was determined using the following formula: [(wet weight
minus dry weight)/wet weight]  100%.

4.6.

Immunohistochemistry

All brains were ﬁrst transcardially perfused with 0.1 M
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and then 4% PFA in
0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) 24 h after of the performance of the MCAO
and reperfusion. Subsequently, the brains were isolated,
incubated for 1 day in 4% PFA, incubated in a solution of
25% sucrose and PBS for 8 h, and then serial frontal sections
were cut using a cryotome (Leica; Germany). Next, the brain
sections were washed with PBS and incubated with anti-Iba-1
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.; Santa Cruz, CA, USA) to
observe microglia and glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP;
Santa Cruz) to observe astrocytes. Next, they were incubated
with anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz) for 2 h at room
temperature and reacted using 0.01% H2O2 with 0.05% diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride in 50 mM Tris–HCl. The sections were imaged with digitalized microphotographs using
commercial imaging analysis software (AxioScope software;
Thornwood, NY, USA).

4.7.

Fluoro-Jade B staining

To assess neurodegeneration, the ﬁxed brain sections were
pretreated with a 100% alcohol solution for 3 min, a 70%
alcohol solution for 1 min, and then washed in distilled water
for 2 min. The sections were then incubated for 10 min in a
0.06% potassium permanganate solution, rinsed in distilled
water for 2 min, and then transferred into a 0.001% solution
of Fluoro-Jade B in 0.09% acetic acid for 20 min. The sections
were imaged with digitalized microphotographs using commercial imaging analysis software (AxioScope software).

4.8.

Immunoblotting

The present study utilized anti-GRP78, anti-CHOP, anti-peIF2α (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.; Beverly, MA, USA),
anti-eIF2α (Cell Signaling), and anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz) antibodies. Whole-cell lysates (50 μg) were boiled in a sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) gel loading buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred
to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then probed with the
appropriate primary and peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Chemiluminescent
signaling was developed using Super Signal West Pico or
Femto substrates (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA), the blots were
imaged with a Gel Doc 2000 Chemi Doc system (Bio-Rad;
Hercules, CA, USA), and the band densities were quantiﬁed
with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). All values were normalized using β-actin as a loading control.

4.9.

Image analysis and statistical analysis

To assess the immunohistochemical signals quantitatively,
we used the NIH image program (ImageJ) for densitometric

brain research 1627 (2015) 12–20

measurements. All experiments were performed at least
three times, all data are expressed as means7standard
deviation (SD), and all statistical analyses were performed
using Sigma Stat (Systat Software; La Jolla, CA, USA). Data for
which two conditions were compared were evaluated using a
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Tukey's
post-hoc test. A P valueo0.05 was considered to indicate
statistical signiﬁcance.
