Abstract
Introduction: Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, claims six lives every 60 seconds, and is a
leading cause of adult disability across the globe. Tissue plasminogen activator, the only United States Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug currently available, has a narrow therapeutic time window of less than 5
hours. In the past decade, cells derived from the human umbilical cord (HUC) have emerged as a potential
therapeutic alternative for stroke; however, the most effective HUC-derived cell population remains unknown.
Methods: We compared three cell populations derived from the human umbilical cord: cord blood mononuclear
cells (cbMNCs); cord blood mesenchymal stromal cells (cbMSCs), a subpopulation of cbMNCs; and cord matrix
MSCs (cmMSCs). We characterized these cells in vitro with flow cytometry and assessed the cells’ in vivo efficacy in a
2-hour transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) rat model of stroke. cbMNCs, cbMSCs, and cmMSCs were
each transplanted intraarterially at 24 hours after stroke.
Results: A reduction in neurologic deficit and infarct area was observed in all three cell groups; however, this
reduction was significantly enhanced in the cbMNC group compared with the cmMSC group. At 2 weeks after
stroke, human nuclei-positive cells were present in the ischemic hemispheres of immunocompetent stroke rats in
all three cell groups. Significantly decreased expression of rat brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA was observed
in the ischemic hemispheres of all three cell-treated and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) group animals compared
with sham animals, although the decrease was least in cbMNC-treated animals. Significantly decreased expression
of rat interleukin (IL)-2 mRNA and IL-6 mRNA was seen only in the cbMSC group. Notably, more severe
complications (death, eye inflammation) were observed in the cmMSC group compared with the cbMNC and
cbMSC groups.
Conclusions: All three tested cell types promoted recovery after stroke, but cbMNCs showed enhanced
recovery and fewer complications compared with cmMSCs.

Introduction
Cells derived from the human umbilical cord (HUC) have
been successfully used in the clinic for almost 2 decades
[1-4]. Their simple and economic retrieval, enrichment for
hematopoietic progenitors, enhanced proliferation rate, expansion potential [5,6], and low incidence of graft-versushost disease [7,8] makes them a promising cell treatment
for several disorders. Although their therapeutic benefits
were initially thought to be limited to hematopoietic disorders, several recent studies have shown the potential of
these HUC-derived cells to enhance regeneration and tissue
repair in various pathological disorders, including neurologic diseases [9-11]. HUC-derived cells have already been
used clinically for nonhematopoietic degenerative conditions [12], hereditary ataxia [13], and disorders such as
cerebral palsy [14] and spinal cord injury [15], and they are
currently being tested for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00593242).
HUC-derived cells have been used in preclinical stroke
studies for more than a decade. Alhough most studies
have shown significant functional or histo-pathologic recovery, homing, and differentiation of the grafted cells
[16-25], some studies reported on lack of migration or
neurologic benefits [26-28] or absence of human nucleipositive cells despite evidence of functional recovery [29].
In a meta-analysis, we assessed the effects of HUC-derived
cells in preclinical stroke studies (included studies, 14).
We found a significant reduction in infarct volume with
an overall effect of Z = 6.54 (P < 0.00001), with a noticeable heterogeneity as well (I2 = 87%). Apart from variation
in study design, cell dose, or route of transplantation, a
possible source of this heterogeneic outcome could be the
varying mix of cell populations present in human umbilical cord blood [11] and/or biologic differences of the
cord matrix/blood-derived cell populations used in these
studies. cbMNCs comprise a heterogeneous mix of immature lymphocytes, monocytes [12,30], hematopoietic [31],
endothelial [32], and mesenchymal [33-36] stem/progenitor cells. Moreover, studies report on the presence of very
small embryonic-like stem cells [37], embryonic-like cells
[38,39], and neural stem/progenitor cells [40-42] at different lineage commitment stages. It is therefore important
to understand whether it is the mixture of cord blood cells
or a specific stem cell population that is responsible for
ameliorating the harmful effects of stroke and hereby to
assess the risks of cell therapy.
In this study, we characterized and compared cbMNCs
from HUCs with two entities of HUC-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs): cord blood MSCs (cbMSCs),
and cord matrix MSCs (cmMSCs). Whereas cbMSCs are
composed of a rare population of multipotent precursors
enriched from cbMNCs [35,43,44], cmMSCs are derived
from the mucoid connective tissue surrounding cord
blood vessels, known as Wharton jelly [45]. These three

cell populations were transplanted into stroke rats to assess their potential effects on recovery and their ability to
home to the host brain after intraarterial transplantation.
Additionally, we analyzed the inflammatory response in
the host, as well as the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), epidermal growth factor (EGF),
glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPx-4), and reelin mRNA in the
ipsilateral hemispheres of the study animals, given their
role in neuroprotection and recovery after stroke [46-56].

Materials and methods
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model and
sham surgery

All animal procedures were approved by the Stanford
University Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal
Care. Adult male Wistar rats (270 to 300 g) were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) by
using the 2-hour transient intraluminal filament occlusion model of cerebral ischemia, as described previously
[49,57,58]. In brief, rats were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in a mixture of 30% oxygen and 70% air. After a
midline incision, the right common carotid artery (CCA),
external carotid artery (ECA), and internal carotid artery
(ICA) were exposed. The CCA and ICA were temporarily
ligated, and a 4–0 silicone rubber-coated reusable monofilament (Doccol Inc, 40SPRe3756) was inserted into the
lumen of the right ICA through a small incision in the
ECA. The filament was advanced into the ICA until 18 to
19 mm was inserted from the bifurcation, and the origin
of the middle cerebral artery was blocked. Physiological
parameters (respiratory rate, core body temperature, and
color of mucous membranes) were monitored and recorded throughout the surgical procedure. Two hours
after the MCAo, each animal was reanesthetized, and the
monofilament was withdrawn to cause reperfusion. All
surgery animals were given analgesic treatment with 0.03
mg/kg buprenorphine.
For sham surgery, the ECA was surgically prepared for
insertion of the filament, but the 4–0 monofilament was
not inserted. The neck incision was closed, and each animal underwent the same postoperative care as the stroke
surgery animals.
Isolation of cbMNCs and culture of MSCs

Cord blood collection was approved by the Institutional
Review Board (IRB) and Stem Cell Research Oversight
(SCRO) Committee at Stanford University. Informed
consent was taken from donor mothers before samples
were collected. All six cord-blood samples were processed within 10 hours of collection, and cbMNCs were
obtained by using the Ficoll-Paque density gradient
method [40,59,60]. Cell viability was tested by using
the trypan blue exclusion method. The cbMNCs obtained were used for cbMSC culture, flow-cytometry

Karlupia et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy 2014, 5:45

experiments, transplantation, or cryopreservation. cbMSC
cultures were established, as previously described [61],
with modifications made in our laboratory. In brief, 60 ×
106 cbMNCs were plated per fibronectin-coated six-well
plates (Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA) in proliferation medium comprising MEM-α with
glutamax, ribonucleosides, and deoxyribonucleosides
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY 16000–044), 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco FBS), 50 nM dexamethasone (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO D8893), 10 ng/ml epidermal
growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich E9644), 10 ng/ml plateletderived growth factor (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN),
and 1× penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen 15140–122).
Plates were placed in a normoxic humidified incubator
with 5% CO2 and growth medium was replaced after 24
hours of plating and every alternate day thereafter.
On appearance of the first colony of adherent cells,
cells were harvested by using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution and re-plated in new noncoated culture plates. Passages 5 to 6 were used in all experimental procedures.
cmMSCs were obtained commercially from PromoCell
(C-12971, Germany) and were expanded by using proliferation medium (C-28010, PromoCell).

buffer. Simultaneously, compensation controls were prepared for all the markers by using BD-CompBeads (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Flow cytometry was performed on a Becton Dickinson LSR-II (Stanford Shared
FACS Facility), and data were analyzed with FlowJo
(TreeStar Inc). Gates were set according to the unstained and 7-amino-actinomycin D-stained controls to
exclude dead cells for each cell type, and compensation
was done by single-color-stained BD-CompBeads. Isotype controls were not used for these experiments, as
several past studies pointed to their nonessential [62-64]
or potentially misleading results [65,66].
Transplantation of cbMNCs, cbMSCs, or cmMSCs

Animals were randomly divided into experimental groups:
sham surgery (n = 12); MCAo + PBS (n = 27); MCAo rats
infused with 10 × 106 cbMNCs (n = 24); 5 × 106 cbMSCs
(n = 18); 5 × 106 cmMSCs (n = 23), and 10 × 106 cmMSCs
(n = 6). Stroke animals were injected with PBS or cells suspended in PBS 24 hours after stroke through an intracarotid route. To assess the inflammatory reaction after stroke,
none of the experimental animals received an immunosuppressant drug.

Flow-cytometry analysis

Assessment of neurologic deficit

Flow cytometry was used to characterize the cultured
cbMSCs and to compare them with cbMNCs and
cmMSCs. cbMSCs from passages 5 and 6 were assessed
for expression of mesenchymal and hematopoietic lineage
markers relative to cbMNCs in successive flow-cytometry
experiments by using mouse anti-human CD73 (PE),
CD90 (FITC), CD166 (PE), CD34 (FITC), CD133 (APC),
CD19 (FITC), CD45 (APC-Cy7), HLA-ABC (FITC), and
HLA-DR (FITC). cbMSCs were further compared with
cmMSCs and cbMNCs simultaneously by using a multicolor flow-cytometry experiment designed for a total of 27
phenotypic markers (see Additional file 1). cbMSCs and
cmMSCs used in this experiment were from passage 6,
and cbMNCs used were from the same sample from
which the cbMSC culture was established. For comparative immunophenotyping, cbMNCs, cbMSCs, and cmMSCs
(75,000 cells per experiment) were washed with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% to 1% FBS, and
100-μl aliquots of each were placed in flow-activated
cell sorting (FACS) tubes for staining.
Six antibody cocktails (Additional file 1) were used for
characterization of the three cell types and were prepared according to their conjugated fluorochromes and
their emission ranges. The volume of each antibody used
was per manufacturer’s recommendation or as titrated
in preliminary experiments. Antibody cocktails were
added to each tube and incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes.
Stained cells were given three washes at 1,200 rpm for
5 minutes each and then suspended in 500 μl FACS

The rotarod, grid-walk, and open-field behavior tests were
used to assess motor coordination, sensory motor function,
and spontaneous activity of study animals before surgery
(MCAo/sham), and at 1, 4, 7, and 14 days after surgery.
Baseline readings at 24 hours before surgery were the internal controls for each study animal. All behavior experiments were performed between 9 AM and 2 PM.
In the rotarod performance test rats were placed on a
motor-driven cylinder and the length of time they
remained on it before falling was recorded [16,67,68].
Animals were trained 3 days before surgery to remain
on the rotating spindle (moving at a constant speed of 8
rpm) for 60 seconds. One day before surgery, the trained
animals were given a test trial on an accelerating cylinder (with an increasing speed of 4 to 40 rpm within 5
minutes), and latency to their fall was recorded.
The grid-walk test was modified from the test described by Rogers et al. [68]. Rats were placed on an elevated 30-mm2 grid floor for 1 minute to be acclimated
and then placed on the grid floor and recorded for 2 minutes. Total numbers of paired steps as well as total numbers of foot faults for each limb were manually counted
from the recorded videos [67]. Percentage foot fault was
determined by using the formula: ((Number of foot faults/
(number of paired steps + number of foot faults)) × 100).
For the open-field test, animals were individually
placed in the center of the arena and were tracked with
a video camera connected to a computer. Ethovision XT
5.1 software by Noldus was used to design the paradigm

Karlupia et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy 2014, 5:45
http://stemcellres.com/content/5/2/45

for recording, and animals were recorded for 10 minutes
for each trial. Total distance moved by each animal during the 10-minute trial was compared to assess spontaneous activity.
Assessment of infarct size

On day 14 after stroke, rats were killed with isoflurane
and perfused transcardially with 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4)
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were extracted and incubated overnight in 10-fold 4% PFA and
were saturated with increasing sucrose concentrations
(20% followed by 30%) in PBS for 24 to 48 hours. Cryosections (20 μm) were cut serially between +1 to −1 bregma.
Seven coronal sections (200 μm apart) per brain were
stained by using high-contrast silver staining and scanned
at 1,200 dpi [69,70]. Image J software by the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) was used to measure the total
ipsilateral, contralateral, and infarct areas. Infarct area was
calculated relative to the contralateral hemisphere by
using the formula: infarct size = 100 × (total contralateral
hemisphere area − (total ipsilateral hemisphere area–infarct area)/total contralateral hemisphere area) [17,69].
Tissue processing and immunohistochemistry

At 2 weeks after stroke, animals were transcardially perfused, and brains were extracted and sectioned at 20-μm
postfixation. Immunohistochemistry was performed for
localization of human nuclei (HuNu)-positive cells in celltreated animals and to assess the effect of transplanted
cells on immune response by using anti-CD68 and ionized
calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba-1) antibodies.
Immunohistochemistry to localize transplanted human
cells was performed [71] by using a monoclonal antibody
specific for human nuclei with no cross-reactivity for rat or
mouse nuclei (MAB1281, mouse anti-HuNu, Millipore,
Billerica, MA). In brief, endogenous peroxidase activity was
quenched with H2O2 (0.3%), and sections were blocked for
40 minutes in tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% normal goat serum (NGS; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA, S-1000). Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C
with primary antibody (1:100) and then incubated with
biotinylated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG,
Zymed; Vector Laboratories, 1:200) for 2 hours at room
temperature followed by ABC (Vectastain Elite; Vector
Laboratories) and diaminobenzidine (DAB; Vector Laboratories) developing. Immunohistochemical staining in the
contralateral hemisphere was used as an internal control
for each animal. Sections from the PBS-group animals were
also stained as a negative control for human cells.
A similar procedure was followed with the lysosomal
marker CD68 by using mouse monoclonal anti-rat CD68
antibody (sc-59103; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.,
Santa Cruz, CA, 1:200).

Page 4 of 19

For Iba-1, immunofluorescence was performed. Primary
antibody (rabbit anti-Iba-1; Wako; 1:600) was incubated
overnight at 4°C followed by 2 hours of incubation at
room temperature with secondary antibody diluted at
1:400 (Alexa Fluor-594 goat anti-rabbit; Invitrogen, Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY-A11037) [71]. Mounting
was done by using Vectashield mounting media with DAPI
(Vector Laboratories, H-1200), and images were taken by
using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope.
Total RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and
quantitative real-time PCR

Total RNA was isolated by using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini
Kit and following manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, rats
were killed at day 14, and the brains were extracted. About
3 mm3 (approximately 30 mg) of tissue was excised from
the ischemic hemisphere, 2 to −1.5 bregma, and just medial to the infarcted region of cell-treated and PBS-group
animals. A similarly representative brain region was excised
from the ipsilateral hemisphere of sham animals. Reverse
transcriptase reactions were performed with the Bio-Rad
iScript cDNA synthesis kit by using 1 μg of total RNA.
To analyze levels of mRNA, qPCR was performed on the
Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time Detection System by using Taqman gene-expression assays (Inventoried/Cat. 4331182;
Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Reference genes were rat- and
human-specific glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) (Rn01775763_g1; Hs03929097_g1*). Target genes
were rat-specific brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
(Rn02531967_m1); glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPx-4) (Rn00
820816_g1); epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Rn005633
36_m1); reelin (Rn00589609_m1); interleukin 1beta (IL-1β)
(Rn00580432_m1); tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-A)
(Rn01525859_g1); rat- and human-specific interleukin (IL)2 (Rn00587673_m1, Hs00174114_m1); IL-6 (Rn014103
30_ml, Hs00985639_m1); and IL-10 (Rn0053409_m1, Hs00
961622_m1).
The threshold cycles (Ct) for the target gene and internal control were determined for each sample, which
underwent qPCR in parallel duplicate runs. Expression
of target genes was normalized to the housekeeping gene
GAPDH and is displayed as 2-ΔCT.
Assessment of adverse effects and mortality rate

Appearance of adverse effects during/within 24 hours
and 24 hours after cell administration was recorded. The
total of dead animals in each group was counted separately for time points <24 hours and >24 hours after
transplantation. The mortality rate was calculated as percentage of animals that died of total animals in each
group. Statistical significance for mortality was calculated relative to PBS group.

Statistics

Statistical analyses of data were performed with GraphPad Prism 5 software (San Diego, CA, USA). One-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post hoc test
was used for percentage of infarct area, and two-way
ANOVA (with Bonferroni post hoc test) was used for behavioral analysis. The t test with Bonferroni multiplecomparison adjustment was used for qPCR analysis. All
neurologic, histopathologic, and gene-analysis data are
presented as mean ± SEM. For flow-cytometry data analysis, the two-tailed t test with Welch correction was
used, and data are presented as mean ± SD. For mortality
data analysis, the Fisher Exact test was used with twotailed P values. Significance was set at P < 0.05.

Results
Culture of cbMSCs and comparative immunophenotyping
of cbMNCs, cbMSCs, and cmMSCs with flow cytometry

Attempts to isolate MSCs from six cord-blood samples
resulted in two colonies of adherent cells that showed a
flat, spindle-shaped, fibroblastoid phenotype (Figure 1). The
first colony from these two cord blood samples was visible
at days 16 and 18, respectively. Cultured cbMSCs were
assessed at passages 5 and 6 for the expression of surface antigens reportedly expressed on MSCs [72], and were found
positive for CD90, CD73, CD166, and showed negligible expression of CD45 and HLA-DR. Relative to cbMNCs,
enriched cbMSCs showed higher expression of CD73,
CD166 (P < 0.0001), CD90 (P < 0.0004) and decreased expression of HLA-DR (P < 0.0001), CD45 (P < 0.01), and
CD19 (P < 0.005) (Figure 1A,B).
Enriched cbMSCs showed a trend toward higher expression of HLA-ABC and lower expression of CD34 and
CD133. CbMSCs were compared with cbMNCs and commercially obtained matrix-derived cmMSCs by using
multicolor flow cytometry (Table 1; see Additional files 2,
3). cbMNCs were positive for MHC I, MHC II, dendritic,
hematopoietic, leukocytic, endothelial, lymphocytic, and
myeloid cell markers (CD56, CD14, CD45, LIN1, CD33),
but, like cb/cmMSCs, showed very low expression of
primitive hematopoietic progenitors (CD34, CD133). Both
cbMSCs and cmMSCs were highly positive for CD44,
CD117, CD73, CD166, CD184, CD59, CD123, and CD210,
and showed very low expression of HLA-DR, CD34,
CD33, CD133, and CD45. Apart from the expression of
MSC lineage markers, expression of CD117 (stem cell
factor), CD184 (CXCR4 receptor), CD106 (VCAM-1 molecule), CD59 (inhibitor of membrane attack complex
formation), and lack of Lin1+ cells (only in cbMSCs),
mainly distinguished MSCs from cbMNCs (Table 1 and
Additional files 2, 3).
Although cmMSCs expressed typical MSC markers,
these cells also exhibited expression of certain markers
(Lin1+ 31.6% compared with 0.46% for cbMSCs; CD56,

Page 5 of 19

80% compared with 1.28% for cbMSCs; CD4, 68% compared with 5.8% for cbMSCs and CD14, 20% compared
with 0.404% in cbMSCs), similar to cbMNCs. CD56,
expressed on neuronal and NK cells and known to mediate
synaptic plasticity, was found highest in cmMSCs (80.8%)
compared with 11.3% in cbMNCs and 1.28% in cbMSCs.
cbMNCs are as effective as cbMSCs or cmMSCs in
improving motor coordination

Compared with the PBS group, all three cell-group animals
showed significant recovery in the rotarod test at day 4
(P < 0.01 for MNC and P < 0.05 for cbMSC and cmMSC),
which continued until day 14 after stroke (P < 0.001,
cbMNC; P < 0.01, cbMSC and cmMSC). At 24 hours after
stroke, the latency to fall from the rotating spindle was significantly shorter in MCAo versus sham animals; however,
no significant differences were seen in the sham-versus-cell
groups or within the three cell-treated groups at days 4, 7
and 14. By 2 weeks, all three cell groups were performing
at prestroke baseline levels (Figure 2A).
cbMNCs and cbMSCs but not cmMSCs promote
improvement in spontaneous activity after stroke

MCAo caused a significant decrease in spontaneous activity of stroke rats compared with the sham group at day 1.
Improvement in spontaneous activity, although not significant, was seen at day 4 after stroke in cell-treated animals
and at day 7 in PBS-group animals. Despite continuous
improvement in the spontaneous activity of cell-treated
rats from days 4 to 14, significant recovery relative to the
PBS group was seen only at day 14 after stroke in the
cbMNC and cbMSC groups but not in the cmMSC group.
PBS-treated MCAo rats showed increased spontaneous
activity at day 7, which showed a deteriorating trend at
day 14. No significant difference was seen across the three
cell groups (Figure 2B).
cbMNCs are more effective in reducing sensory-motor
deficits than are cbMSCs or cmMSCs

All study animals showed similar limb misplacements in
the grid-walking test before stroke, which increased significantly after stroke relative to the sham group. Compared with the PBS group, all cell-treated animals
showed a decreasing trend in percentage of foot faults,
starting on day 4 (Figure 2C). However, only the cbMNC
and cbMSC groups showed significant reductions in
limb misplacement at day 14 after stroke (P < 0.001 for
cbMNCs and P < 0.01 for cbMSCs) compared with the
PBS group. Only the cbMNC group showed significant
reduction in foot faults starting on day 7 (P < 0.01) and,
by day 14, percentage of foot faults in this group was as
low as prestroke baseline values. At day 14, the cbMNC
group performed significantly better than the cmMSC

Figure 1 Immunophenotypic characterization and expansion of cultured cord-blood MSCs. Culturing cbMSCs from cbMNCs resulted in
enrichment of CD73+CD166+CD90+CD45−CD34−HLA-DR− cells closely resembling the phenotypes of MSC proposed by the International Society
for Cellular Therapy (ISCT), 2006 [72]. Representative flow-cytometry contour plots are shown to illustrate expression of individual phenotypic
markers in cbMNCs and cbMSCs (A). In each plot, percentage of cells positive for a given marker is shown on the right, and percentage of cells
negative for the same marker is shown on the left. Relative to cbMNCs, cbMSCs had enriched expression of CD73, CD166 (P < 0.0001), CD90
(P < 0.0004), and decreased expression of HLA-DR (P < 0.0001), CD45 (P < 0.01), and CD19 (P < 0.005). cbMSCs also had relatively higher expression
of HLA-ABC and lower expression of CD34 and CD133, although the difference was not significant (B). Spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like, flat, adherent
cells are shown across various passages of cbMSC culture (magnification 10×) (C). Comparative morphologic representation of 10th passage cbMSCs
and commercially obtained cmMSCs is shown in (D). Student t test, n = 4 for each group, (**) is P < 0.01, (***) is P < 0.001, and (ns) is nonsignificant.

group (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference
between cbMSC and cmMSC groups.
A subgroup analysis (n = 8 per group) showed significant recovery in both contralateral forelimb and hindlimb
function of cbMNC-treated animals and only contralateral
hindlimb function of cbMSC-group animals compared
with PBS-group animals (Figure 2D,E). cbMNC-group animals displayed significantly fewer faults in the contralateral forelimb at day 4 (P < 0.01) and at days 7 and 14
(P < 0.05), compared with PBS-group animals, (Figure 2D).
Both cbMNC- and cbMSC-group animals had significant
reduction in contralateral hindlimb misplacement at day
14 after stroke (P < 0.05 for MNC and P < 0.01 for cbMSC
group), relative to PBS group (Figure 2E).

HuNu-positive cells were found in the ipsilateral hemisphere of cbMNC-, cbMSC-, and cmMSC-treated animals.
HuNu-positive cells were not present in the contralateral
hemisphere of cell-transplanted animals, indicating the
propensity of all three cell types to migrate through the
ICA and to home sustainably to the region of infarction
(Figure 4).
Relative to the PBS group, a marked decrease in Iba-1positive cells (activated macrophages/microglia) was observed in both ipsilateral cortex and more prominently in
the striatum of cell-treated animals (Figure 5). Similar to
reduction in Iba-1-positive cells, a trend of fewer CD68positive, activated microglia was seen in all three cellgroup animals compared to PBS-group animals (Figure 6).

cbMNCs promote greater reduction in infarct size

Assessment of neuroprotective, antiinflammatory, and
antioxidative effects of the three cell types in stroke rats

High-contrast silver staining at day 14 after stroke showed
extensive cortical and striatal atrophy, massive loss of cytoarchitecture, and enhanced ventricular enlargement in the
PBS group. Transplantation of all three cell types significantly reduced infarct size with apparently reduced ventricular enlargement and loss of cytoarchitecture. The
percentage of infarct area, calculated relative to the contralateral hemisphere, was 62.337% ± 5.508% in the PBS
group, 42.64% ± 6.56% in the cbMNC group, 46.436% ±
6.3% in the cbMSC group, and 51.337% ± 4.37% in the
cmMSC group, (n = 10 per group). Although all three
cell types were similarly effective in reducing infarct
size relative to the PBS group (P < 0.001), the reduction
in percentage infarct area was significantly greater in
the cbMNC group compared with the cmMSC group
(P < 0.01) (Figure 3B). No significant difference was seen
in percentage of infarct area of cbMNC and cbMSC
groups or between cbMSC and cmMSC groups.
cbMNCs, cbMSCs, and cmMSCs can survive in the host
ischemic environment and mediate similar
immunomodulatory effects

To identify and characterize the transplanted human
cells in the brains of immunocompetent stroke rats, immunohistochemistry was performed on coronal brain
sections at 2 weeks after transplantation (n = 4 per group).

We assessed the mRNA expression of nine rat-specific
genes (BDNF, GPx-4, EGF, reelin, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-1beta,
TNF-alpha) and three human-specific genes (IL-2, IL-6,
and IL-10) in the ipsilateral hemisphere of cell-treated, PBS,
and sham-group animals. At 2 weeks after stroke, rat BDNF
mRNA expression was significantly higher in the ipsilateral
hemisphere of the sham group compared with the PBS
(P < 0.0001), cbMNC (P < 0.01), and cb/cmMSC (P < 0.001)
groups. Compared with the cbMSC, cmMSC, and PBS
groups, rat BDNF mRNA showed a trend of higher expression in the cbMNC group (Figure 7). At day 14 after stroke,
a trend of enhanced expression of rat reelin and GPx-4
mRNA was detected in sham and cbMNC-treated animals
compared with the PBS group. No significant difference
was observed in rat EGF mRNA expression among the
PBS, sham, and cell-treated groups. Relative to the PBS
group, expression of rat IL-2 mRNA was low in the sham
and cell groups, with a significant decrease in the cbMSC
and cmMSC groups (P < 0.001). Rat IL-6 mRNA was significantly lower in the cbMSC and sham groups (P < 0.001)
and was detected at high levels in the cmMSC and cbMNC
groups (difference not significant).
The lowest expression of rat IL-1beta mRNA was detected in cbMSC-treated animals (P < 0.001), with no significant difference between the sham, PBS, cbMNC, and

cmMSC groups. No significant difference was detected in
expression of rat TNF-alpha mRNA between groups, although cmMSCs showed a trend of higher TNF-alpha
mRNA expression. No expression of rat IL-10 mRNA or
human-origin cytokine mRNA (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10) could be
detected in any of the study groups.
cbMNCs and cbMSCs showed no adverse effects and
decreased mortality after stroke

No cell-related adverse events were observed in cbMNCand cbMSC-treated animals after transplantation. Of 23
animals treated with 5 × 106 cmMSCs, one animal developed severe inflammation in the ipsilateral eye within
24 hours of transplantation (see Additional file 4). In

contrast, the incidence of severe inflammation of the ipsilateral eye in animals transplanted with 10 × 106 cmMSCs
was significantly higher (three of six). Of these four total
animals with severe eye inflammation, all three of the animals transplanted with 10 × 106 cells died within 24 hours;
however, the animal transplanted with 5 × 106 cmMSCs
survived to day 14 (Table 2). A trend of decreased overall
mortality after stroke was seen in the cbMNC (8%) and
cbMSC (11%) groups relative to the PBS (22%) group. The
overall mortality rate was highest
in the
cmMSC (26%) group, although the difference in mortality
of all three cell-group animals and the PBS group was not
significant (Table 2). No animals died within 24 hours of
cbMNC (10 × 106), cbMSC (5 × 106), or cmMSC (5 × 106)

Figure 2 Reduced neurologic deficits in all three cell-treated stroke animals with enhanced recovery in the cbMNC group. Neurologic
deficits were assessed on rotarod (A), open field (B), and foot-fault (C) tests before stroke (d 0) and at d 1, 4, 7, and 14 after stroke. Rotarod motor
coordination of all cell-treated animals improved significantly compared with the PBS group. P < 0.01 (d4), P < 0.001 (d 7, 14) for cbMNC group;
P < 0.05 (d 4) and P < 0.01 (d 7, 14) for cbMSC and cmMSC groups. Significant improvement in open-field spontaneous activity was seen at d 14
in cbMNC- and cbMSC-treated animals, but not in the cmMSC group compared with the PBS group (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Significant
reduction in percentage foot faults was seen in the cbMNC group relative to the PBS group (P < 0.01, d 7 and P < 0.001, d 14) and the cmMSC group
(P < 0.05, d 14). cbMSC- but not cmMSC-treated animals showed significant reduction in limb misplacement at d 14 (P < 0.01). Relative to the PBS
group, only the cbMNC group showed significantly less contralateral forelimb errors (D) (P < 0.01 at d 4; P < 0.05 at d 7, 14); however, both cbMSC
and cbMNC groups showed recovery in contralateral hindlimb errors at d 14 (E) (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). At d 14, relative to the sham
group, no significant difference was seen in contralateral forelimb errors in the cbMNC group and in hindlimb errors in both cbMNC and cbMSC
groups (D, E). (*) is P < 0.05; (**) is P < 0.01, and (***) is P <0.001. Values are expressed as mean ± SEM.

group. In contrast, all six animals transplanted with 10 ×

Discussion
HUC blood is a promising source of cells for the treatment of stroke, either by using a heterogeneous mix of unprocessed cells or by preselecting a specific cell population

Figure 3 All three cell types promoted histopathologic recovery, with greater improvement seen in the cbMNC group. Silver-stained
brain sections showed decreased infarct size, reduced ventricular enlargement, and loss of cytoarchitecture in all three cell-treated animals compared with the PBS group (A). Significant reduction in percentage of infarct area across all three cell groups (P < 0.001) was seen compared with
the PBS group at d 14 after stroke (B). Reduction in lesion size was significantly more in the cbMNC versus cmMSC group (P < 0.01). Values are

from it [11]. Although these two therapeutic avenues have
been tested in various preclinical stroke studies with beneficial effects, it is not yet known whether one is more effective than the other. Thus, we compared the cbMNC
population, which is a heterogeneous mix of hematopoietic, mesenchymal, and endothelial stem/progenitor
cells, along with immature immunological cells [12], with
MSCs derived from cbMNCs and cord matrix.
Although, in principle, transplantation of a xenogenic
graft might induce a local immune response in the host,
preclinical and clinical reports have raised the possibility
of using HUC-derived cells without immunosuppression
[12,17]. Reports have also suggested that immunosuppression is neuroprotective [73,74]. Therefore, to assess
the safety and unbiased efficacy of these cells, we omitted immunosuppression in our study.
Cord-blood-derived cells and other stem cells can be
chemotactically attracted to the site of injury [17]. It is
thus reasonable to opt for systemic rather than intracerebral delivery to avoid tissue damage at the injection site
[75]. Further, selection of intraarterial over intravenous injection was based on study results that showed that more
cells reach the MCA territory when transplanted intraarterially [76,77] and another study that showed approximately 96% of cells transplanted intravenously were
trapped in the lungs and did not reach the arterial circulation in a traumatic brain injury model [78].
As transplanted cell survival in the host brain of immunocompetent rats was one of our outcome measures,
we opted to transplant these cells intraarterially.
A dose-response study of cord-blood-derived cells suggested that delivery of 106 cells was sufficient to result

in significant functional recovery and that doses of >106
cells resulted in functional as well as histopathologic recovery [24]. We thus opted for a dose of 107 cells to assess
the comparative effects of transplanted cbMNCs and
cb/cmMSCs. However, we decreased the dose to 5 × 106
for cb/cmMSCs, as intraarterial injection of 107 cmMSCs
resulted in severe inflammation of the ipsilateral eye,
followed by acute mortality in our study animals. Thus, 5 ×
106 cells was the maximum number of cb/cmMSCs we
could safely transplant (Table 2). MSCs have a tendency to
aggregate into multicellular globules [79], thus at higher
concentrations, they can result in vascular embolization.
Our data suggest that cbMNCs are more effective than
cb/cmMSCs in promoting functional recovery and reducing infarct. Although we would have preferred to inject
the same doses of cbMNCs and cb/cmMSCs, we think it is
unlikely that a twofold difference in transplanted-cell numbers could account for increased beneficial effects of
cbMNCs. Furthermore, cbMSCs comprise a very small
subset (0.001% to 0.000001%) of cbMNCs [80]. Therefore,
it is reasonable to assume that an enriched preselected
population of MSCs would have been equally or more effective at a lesser dose, if they were the critical cbMNC
subpopulation that mediates recovery. Our flow-cytometry
data showed that the cultured fraction of cbMNCs
was enriched in CD73+CD166+CD90+CD45−HLA-DR−
cells (cbMSCs). These cultured cbMSCs showed an approximately 20-fold increase in expression of MSC markers,
resulting in a very effective enrichment of cbMSCs from
the cbMNCs. Thus, 5 × 106 transplanted cbMSCs contained
10-fold more cbMSCs than in 10 × 106 cbMNCs. The enhanced recovery in the cbMNC group compared with the

migrated from the ICA to the ischemic hemisphere and were localized predominantly in the cortex and striatum of the infarct boundary zone
(IBZ). Arrows represent MAB1281-positive cells. No MAB1281 (HuNu)-positive cells were found in the contralateral hemisphere of any of the three
cell groups. Similarly, no MAB1281 staining was seen in the ipsilateral or contralateral hemisphere of PBS rats. Scale bar = 10 μm.

compared with more-compact amoeboidal morphology seen in the PBS group. Decrease in expression of Iba-1 was more prominent in ipsi-striatum
(B) than in ipsi-cortex (A). Scale bar = 100 μm.

enriched cb/cmMSC groups could be due to additional cell
fractions in the cbMNCs that might secrete factors important for recovery. Thus, the as-yet-uncharacterized functional
properties of cbMNC subpopulations and their possible interactions, rather than total cell numbers, could be responsible for the beneficial effects of transplanted cbMNCs. The
enhanced recovery with cbMNCs thus may be partially attributable to the integrative effects of various stem/progenitor cell fractions present in this cell population.

A recent study [81] compared the effects of cbMNCs
with CD34-enriched and CD34-depleted cbMNC fractions in spontaneously hypertensive stroke rats. The study
reported superior effects of cbMNCs relative to the CD34+
and CD34- fractions, suggesting the possibility that the
combined effect of other cell fractions was necessary for
the overall neuroprotective effect.
Although rats in both the cbMNC and cbMSC groups
showed improvement in sensory motor functions, only

Figure 7 Quantification of mRNA expression of rat-specific BDNF, GPx-4, EGF, reelin, IL-2, IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha in the ipsilateral
hemisphere. At 2 weeks after stroke, rat BDNF mRNA expression in sham rats was significantly more compared with PBS (P < 0.0001), cbMNC
(P < 0.01), and cb/cmMSC (P < 0.001) groups. Rat BDNF mRNA expression was relatively more in the cbMNC group compared with the cb/cmMSC
and PBS groups. No significant difference was seen in expression of rat EGF, reelin, GPx-4, and TNF-alpha across the cell-treated, sham, and PBS
groups, although there was an enhanced expression of GPx-4 and reelin mRNA in cbMNC and sham animals. Significantly decreased IL-2 mRNA
expression was seen in the cb/cmMSC groups (P < 0.001). Compared with the PBS group, expression of IL-6 mRNA was significantly less in cbMSC- and
sham-group animals (P < 0.001). Significantly decreased expression of rat IL-1beta mRNA was seen only in the cbMSC group (P < 0.001). Values are
expressed as mean ± SEM, (*) is P < 0.05; (**) is P < 0.01; (***) is P < 0.001; and (****) is P < 0.0001.

cbMNC-treated rats showed early (within 7 days) recovery
in the grid-walk test. This was likely attributable to the
significant improvement seen in both contralateral forelimb and hindlimb deficits in this group. Infarct size was
also most reduced in the cbMNC group and was significantly smaller than that in the cmMSC group. Although
cbMNCs have been shown to produce various growth factors, such as VEGF and BDNF [82], it is probably their
ability to induce enhanced expression of endogenous
BDNF [29] that partially resulted in enhanced recovery in
this group. BDNF is known to mediate proliferation of
existing vascular endothelial cells [83,84], survival and migration of neuronal cells, along with modulation of their
synaptic functions [51,52], and to exert neuroprotective
effects via downregulation of neuronal NOS (nNOS) activity [85]. Intravenous infusion of BDNF has been shown to
reduce infarct volume as early as 5 hours after stroke [47].
Further, the increased mRNA expression of rat-specific
BDNF seen in sham versus PBS animals implies a reduction in the BDNF endogenous levels after stroke. Thus,
cbMNCs and, to a lesser extent, cb/cmMSCs, possibly restore the stroke-induced depletion of endogenous BDNF
[86]. In addition, the trend of increased expression of rat
GPx-4 mRNA in cbMNC-treated animals indicates a possible role of MNCs in abating the effects of oxidative
stress on GPx-4 levels. The restored GPx-4 might in turn
downregulate lipid peroxidation, resulting in decreased
neuronal cell death and enhanced overall recovery.

Similar to earlier reports [16,24], transplanted cbMNCs,
cbMSCs, and cmMSCs were seen predominantly in the
ischemic hemisphere where homing is likely facilitated
by chemokine receptor type-4 (CXCR4)-CXCL12 or
CD117-stem cell factor (SCF) interactions. Upregulation of CXCL12/stromal-derived factor 1(SDF-1) has
been reported in the ischemic penumbra [87,88], and
its interaction with (CXCR-4)/CD184 (expressed by all
three cell populations used in our study) is known to
promote migration of cbMNCs [89]. Also, enhanced expression of SCF has been reported in neurons within
the injured hemisphere [90] and might have played a
role in directed migration of transplanted cb/cmMSCs,
both of which had significant expression of the SCF
receptor CD117, as shown in our comparative flowcytometry experiment.
We observed decreased numbers of CD68- and amoeboidal Iba-1-positive cells in our cell-treated versus PBS
animals, indicating a decrease in activated microglia. These
resident immune cells are known to acquire a phagocytic
phenotype after stroke that disrupts the blood–brain barrier and increases inflammation through release of proinflammatory cytokines, free radicals, and recruitment of
leukocytes from the circulatory system [91,92]. Thus, a
decrease in activated microglial cells in the injured brain
after HUC-derived cell treatment represents an immunomodulatory effect that could reduce neuroinflammation
and increase recovery. Although how HUC-derived cells

Adverse effects and mortality after cell transplantation. The table shows cell-related adverse effects within 24 hours and >24 hours of cell transplantation. Both
cbMNC- and cbMSC-group animals had no adverse effects after cell transplantation. One animal transplanted with 5 × 106 cmMSCs and three animals transplanted
with 10 × 106 cmMSCs had severe inflammation of the ipsilateral eye within 24 hours of transplantation. The mortality rate was calculated, for two time points,
within 24 hours and >24 hours, as a percentage of animals that died to the total animals in each group. A decreasing trend in mortality was seen in the cbMNC
and cbMSC groups, but not in the cmMSC group compared with the PBS group. The mortality rate within 24 hours of transplantation in animals transplanted with
10 × 106 cmMSCs was significantly higher compared with the PBS group animals (P < 0.0001). *P value relative to the PBS group calculated with the Fisher Exact

suppress activated microglia is unknown, a recent study
implicates the role of CD11b+ and CD19+ cbMNCs in reducing microglial survival and CD4+ in sustaining microglia in vitro after hypoxic conditions [91]. In our study,
cbMNCs were CD19+CD4+, cmMSCs were CD19−, but
had enriched CD4+ expression, whereas cbMSCs had negligible expression of both CD19 and CD4. Thus, markedly
reduced activated microglial cells in each of these three
cell groups indicates that additional factors could be involved in mediating microglial suppression as well as the
possibility that CD19+ cells override the protective effects
of CD4+ cells.
In stroke, various pro-inflammatory cytokines are secreted from infiltrated leukocytes and macrophages
through activation of resident microglia. The insignificant differences in IL-6, IL-β, and TNF-alpha mRNA expression within the cbMNCs and cmMSCs groups
compared with control animals may be due to timedependent expression patterns. These cytokines have
been shown to peak in expression in the ischemic hemisphere at day 7 after stroke, which was decreased by day
14 [93]. The significant decrease in IL-2, IL-6, and IL1beta mRNA in the cbMSC group could indicate a
mechanistic shift of action of these cells from their parental cbMNC population. Whereas suppression of proinflammatory factors might mediate the recovery observed
in cbMSC-treated animals, in the cbMNC group, recovery is more likely associated with the release of growth
factors and the ability to attenuate oxidative stress. The
negligible antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 mRNA seen
in our study is similar to that of previous reports [93] in
which no expression was seen at day 14 after stroke.
The absence of any human cytokine expression in the
ipsilateral hemisphere of the transplanted animals is possibly due to the moderate number of surviving human
cells, low levels of cytokine secretion by the transplanted
cells, or reduced overall inflammation by day 14 after
stroke. Future studies assessing the treatment and timedependent profile of these cytokines will enhance our understanding of inflammation and the effects of umbilical
cord cell subtypes on the same. At 2 weeks after stroke,
insignificant differences in the expression of reelin and
EGF mRNA between the PBS, sham, and cell groups could
indicate that reelin-mediated migration of progenitors and
EGF-mediated recovery after stroke is time dependent.
Cell survival in immunocompetent stroke rat brains and
the absence of adverse events in cbMNCs and cbMSCs
might be due to their immunomodulatory function in
addition to the presence of phenotypically and functionally
immature T-lymphocytes [94]. Cord blood has a higher
percentage of homogeneous regulatory T-lymphocytes
(Tregs) compared with heterogeneous Tregs present in
peripheral blood and a smaller percentage in bone marrow
[95]. Tregs are known to dampen the immune response

Page 15 of 19

[96] and have been shown to exert potent antiinflammatory neuroprotective effects after stroke [97]. HUC blood
Tregs have also been shown clinically to prevent allogeneic acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [98]. It is
therefore important to understand the role of this subpopulation in mediating the survival of transplanted HUCderived cells without adverse effects and whether these
cells play a role in poststroke recovery. Although many
studies with Treg-depleted donor allografts have shown
enhanced GVHD [99-101], it is worth exploring whether
Treg-depleted cord-blood-derived cells home and exert
similar neuroprotective effects in stroke, as seen in this
study. Further, it would be interesting to determine
whether cord-blood and matrix cells have phenotypically
and functionally similar Treg populations.
Last, although both cbMSCs and cmMSCs showed
similar expression of MSC-specific markers, they differed in their expression of Lin1, CD56, CD4, and CD14,
which could account for the differences in functional
and histopathologic recovery seen with these cells. It
would be interesting to determine whether these differences are preserved with cbMSCs and cmMSCs isolated
from the same donor. Further, because of phenotypical
and functional heterogeneity within MSC preparations
and variations between MSC donors, it would be informative to include multiple MSC preparations from
multiple donors in MSC studies [102,103].
We analyzed cbMSCs isolated from a single donor,
which is a limitation of our study. Future studies comparing cbMSCs isolated from multiple donors would therefore provide valuable information on donor-dependent
and/or MSC-subpopulation variations in the context of
cbMSC transplantation after stroke.

Conclusions
Our study data show that cbMNCs, cbMSCs, and cmMSCs
are effective in ameliorating the effects of stroke. However,
cbMSCs, an enriched cell population of cbMNCs, or
cmMSCs, did not show superior performance in stroke rats
compared with the heterogeneous cbMNCs. cbMNCs are
widely accessible and more easily prepared compared with
processed and ex vivo expanded MSCs. Further, the sustainable homing of cbMNCs similar to cb/cmMSCs and
the absence of severe cell-related adverse effects, as seen
with cmMSCs, suggests cbMNCs to be a promising cell
therapy for stroke.

Additional file 4: Description of Data. Photographs of two stroke rats
taken 72 hours after cmMSC transplantation. One stroke rat from cmMSC
group had severe inflammation in ipsilateral eye post cell (5 × 106)
transplantation, which persisted until 14 days (A). The eye can be well
demarcated from normal ipsilateral eye of another cmMSC-transplanted
animal with no adverse effect (B). Similar inflammation of the ipsilateral
eye was also seen in three animals transplanted with 10 × 106 cmMSCs,
all of which died within 24 hours of transplantation.
