Infectious complications are the leading cause of death in the post-acute phase of stroke. Post-stroke
immunodeﬁciency is believed to result from neurohormonal dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous
system (SNS) and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. However, the differential effects of these
neuroendocrine systems on the peripheral immune cells are only partially understood. Here, we
determined the impact of the hormones of the SNS and HPA on distinct immune cell populations and
characterized their interactions after stroke.
At various time points after cortical or extensive hemispheric cerebral ischemia, plasma cortisone,
corticosterone, metanephrine and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels were measured in mice.
Leukocyte subpopulations were ﬂow cytometrically analyzed in spleen and blood. To investigate their
differential sensitivity to stress hormones, splenocytes were incubated in vitro with prednisolone, epinephrine and their respective receptor blockers. Glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) and beta2-adrenergic
receptor (b2-AR) on leukocyte subpopulations were quantiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry. In vivo effects of
GCR and selective b2-AR blockade, respectively, were deﬁned on serum hormone concentrations,
lymphopenia and interferon-c production after severe ischemia.
We found elevated cortisone, corticosterone and metanephrine levels and associated lymphocytopenia
only after extensive brain infarction. Prednisolone resulted in a 5 times higher cell death rate of splenocytes than epinephrine in vitro. Prednisolone and epinephrine-induced leukocyte cell death was prevented by GCR and b2-AR blockade, respectively. In vivo, only GCR blockade prevented post ischemic
lymphopenia whereas b2-AR preserved interferon-c secretion by lymphocytes. GCR blockade increased
metanephrine levels in vivo and prednisolone, in turn, decreased b2-AR expression on lymphocytes.
In conclusion, mediators of the SNS and the HPA axis differentially affect the systemic immune system
after stroke. Moreover, our ﬁndings suggest a negative-feedback of corticosteroids on the sympathetic
axis which may control the post-stroke stress-reaction. This complex interplay between the HPA and
the SNS after stroke has to be considered when targeting the neurohormonal systems in the post acute
phase of severe stroke.

The immune system is intricately involved in damage and

Anrather, 2011; Macrez et al., 2011). At the same time, the injured
brain affects immune cell function resulting in suppression of the
systemic immune system (Meisel et al., 2005; Woiciechowsky
et al., 1999b). Immunodepression predisposes patients to pneumonia and other infections which contribute substantially to post
stroke mortality and morbidity (Chamorro et al., 2007a; Meisel
and Meisel, 2011). The immune alterations in stroke patients
include decreased numbers of peripheral lymphocytes, impaired

activation, mitogen-induced proliferation and cytokine production
of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells which correlate with stroke
severity (Czlonkowska et al., 1979; Hug et al., 2009; Klehmet
et al., 2009) and with the incidence of stroke-associated infections
(Chamorro et al., 2007b; Klehmet et al., 2009). A Th1/Th2 shift of
CD4+ T lymphocytes results in reduced interferon-c (IFN-c) and
increased interleukin-4 (IL-4) cytokine production in both human
(Chamorro et al., 2007b; Klehmet et al., 2009) and experimental
stroke (Prass et al., 2003). Besides impaired lymphocyte functions,
altered monocyte function leads to decreased tumor necrosis
factor-a (TNF-a) and elevated IL-10 cytokine production in stroke
patients. Increased peripheral monocyte counts and elevated IL-10
and IL-6 levels have been identiﬁed as predictors of post-stroke
infections (Chamorro et al., 2007a, 2006; Klehmet et al., 2009).
The signaling mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between
the brain and immune system are under intense investigation. Current concepts attribute a major role to the dysregulation of the
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and of the sympathetic
nervous system (SNS) and their humoral mediators, glucocorticoids and catecholamines, respectively (Iadecola and Anrather,
2011; Meisel et al., 2005). Increased plasma and urine cortisol
and catecholamine levels have been associated with a high mortality rate and poor functional outcome in stroke patients (Feibel
et al., 1977; Olsson, 1990) although a recent study could not
conﬁrm such a correlation (Liesz et al., 2013).
In a landmark experimental study, Prass and co-workers found
that activation of the SNS is mainly responsible for spontaneous
bacterial infections after experimental stroke (Prass et al., 2003).
Pharmacological blockade of beta-receptors prevented the
impaired ex vivo production of IFN-c by T cells and resulted in a
lower bacterial burden in lungs of ischemic mice (Prass et al.,
2003). In another study, noradrenergic sympathetic innervation
of hepatic invariant natural killer T cells mediated immunosuppression after stroke (Wong et al., 2011). Although glucocorticoids
are potent modulators of immune cells under physiological and
other pathological conditions, their role in post-stroke immunodepression appeared to be less prominent (Prass et al., 2003). However, the differential effects of both systems on distinct immune
cell populations and a potential interplay of the HPA axis and the
SNS have not been studied in the setting of stroke.
The purpose of the present study was to characterize the impact
of catecholamines and glucocorticoids on different subsets of
leukocytes, and to describe the interactions between mediators
of the HPA axis and the SNS after experimental murine stroke.
2. Materials and methods
The study was conducted in accordance with national guidelines for the use of experimental animals. All experimental procedures were approved by the governmental committees (animal
care committee, Regierungspraesidium Karlsruhe, Referat 35, Germany). Age-matched, 8–10 weeks old male mice (C57BL/6J, Charles
River Laboratories) were used for the experiments. All mice were
kept on a standard 12 h light/dark cycle and had free access to food
and water.
2.1. In vivo stress hormone blockage
One group of mice was intraperitoneally injected with 4 mg/kg
of the b2-adrenergic receptor (b2-AR) blocker ICI 118551 (Sigma)
dissolved in saline right before as well as 4, 8 and 12 h after middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In more prolonged (3 d) experiments, mice were treated every 12 h thereafter. Control animals
received an equivalent volume of saline. Other groups of mice were
intraperitoneally injected with 30 mg/kg of the glucocorticoid
receptor (GCR) blocker RU486 (Sigma). Due to its hydrophobic

201

properties, RU486 was dissolved in ethanol/soybean oil solution
(1:10) at 6 mg/ml and administered 12 h and again 2 h before
MCAO. Control animals received an equivalent volume of ethanol/soybean oil (1:10). Accounting for its longer half-life
(Lahteenmaki et al., 1987), RU486 or its solvent were additionally
injected 48 h after MCAO for prolonged (3 d) experiments.
2.2. Ischemia models
Moderate-sized cortical infarcts were induced by transtemporal
coagulation of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) distal to the lenticulostriate arteries as a modiﬁcation of the previously described
‘Tamura model’ (Tamura et al., 1981). Mice were anesthetized with
1.5–2% halothane in N2O:O2 (2:1). After a 1 cm long skin incision
between the left eye and ear, the temporal muscle was removed
and a burr hole was drilled through the temporal skull. The dura
mater was removed and the MCA was permanently occluded using
a bipolar electrocoagulation forceps (ERBOTOM, Erbe, Germany). In
sham-operated mice, the MCA was exposed but not occluded. Total
anesthesia time was approximately 15 min in both MCAO and
sham procedures.
For the induction of extensive hemispheric MCAO, mice were
anesthetized with 1.5–2% halothane in N2O:O2 (2:1). To measure
relative cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) changes, a laser Doppler probe
(P403, Perimed, Sweden) was placed 3 mm lateral and 1 mm posterior to the bregma, and relative perfusion units were obtained
(Periﬂux 4001, Perimed, Sweden). Baseline rCBF was deﬁned as
100%. A ventral cervical incision was made to expose the left common carotid artery, which was gently separated from its sheaths
and vagal nerves, and an incision was made on it between 2 ligations, into which a silicon-covered 8–0 nylon monoﬁlament (Doccol Corporation) was inserted and advanced through the internal
carotid artery to occlude the MCA. Successful occlusion was
deﬁned as a decrease of perfusion to <20% of baseline ﬂow measured by laser Doppler. The ﬁlament was ﬁxed in this position by
ligation, the neck closed, the Doppler probe removed and the
mouse replaced into its cage. Sixty min after ﬁlament insertion,
the mouse was reanesthetized and the ﬁlament was removed.
Sham operation was performed identically except that the sham
group only underwent brief introduction of the ﬁlament into the
external carotid artery. A feedback controlled heating pad was
used to maintain body temperature (37 °C) during surgery. Following the closure of the skin, mice were placed under an infrared
heating lamp between the operations and until recovery from
anesthesia. The total anesthesia time was approximately 20 min
in ﬁlament-induced MCAO and sham procedures.
2.3. Assessment of infarct volume
We determined the infarct volume on cresyl violet stained cryosections. In brief, mice were deeply anesthetized with an i.p. injection of Ketamin/Xylazin (100 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively)
and transcardially perfused with cold saline. Brains were removed,
immediately frozen and 20 lm thick coronal cryosections were cut
every 400 lm and stained with cresyl violet. We scanned the
stained sections at 600 dpi, and measured the infarct areas using
a public domain image analysis program (ImageJ). The total infarct
volume was obtained by integrating measured infarct areas and
distance between sections. Correction for brain edema was applied
by subtraction of the ipsilateral minus contralateral hemisphere
volume from the directly measured infarct volume.
2.4. Stress hormone level assessments
Blood samples were collected from naive mice and 2 h, 24 h, or
3 days after MCAO and sham operation from the periorbital venous

202

sinus in anesthesia followed by transcardial perfusion and collection of spleens and brains. For plasma preparation, blood was collected in EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetate) tubes, centrifuged
for 10 min at 1500g at 4 °C. Plasma was rapidly processed for the
analysis of metanephrine and adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH) levels. For serum preparation, blood was collected in test
tubes, allowed to clot for 30 min in room temperature followed
by centrifugation for 10 min at 1500g at 4 °C. Serum was collected
and immediately processed for the measurement of cortisone or
stored at 20 °C for the measurement of corticosterone using ELISA
(Abcam). Metanephrine, cortisone and ACTH concentrations were
analyzed in the Core Laboratory Facilities of the University Hospital
Heidelberg. Metanephrines were analyzed with ELISA (Fast Track,
Beckman Coulter). The analysis of ACTH and cortisone was done
with a chemoluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) on a CENTAUR XP
(Siemens healthcare diagnostics).
2.5. In vitro incubation with stress hormones
Spleens were collected from naive mice after transcardial perfusion and processed to single cell suspensions. Cells were cultured
in 96-well plates (300,000 cells/well) and incubated with 1, 10 or
100 nM epinephrine (Sigma Aldrich) or 1, 10 or 100 nM prednisolone (Sigma Aldrich) and their respective receptor blockers for 1, 2,
4, 6, or 18 h at 37 °C. The nonselective a-AR blocker phentolamine
(Sigma Aldrich), the nonselective b-AR blocker propranolol (Sigma
Aldrich), the selective b1-AR blocker atenolol (Sigma Aldrich) and
the selective b2-AR blocker ICI 118551 (Sigma Aldrich) were used
to investigate the role of the different catecholamine receptors on
leukocytes. The effect of prednisolone was blocked by the GCR
blocker RU486 (Sigma Aldrich). All receptor blockers were used
in 100 nM concentration for in vitro experiments. At least 3 individual experiments were performed for all in vitro experiments
and samples analyzed in duplicates.
2.6. Ex vivo IFN-c production
Spleens were collected from saline, b2-AR blocker, soybean oil
or GCR blocker treated mice 3 d following MCAO. Spleens were
processed to single cell suspension and after ﬁcoll density gradient
centrifugation 300,000 mononuclear cells were cultured in 96-well
plates (RPMI-1640, +10% FCS, +2 mM Glutamine, +25 mM HEPES,
+1% Penicillin/Streptomycin, +50 lM Mercaptoethanol). We processed each sample in duplicate. Cells were primed for 36 h with
plate-bound anti-mouse CD3e (Clone145-2C11, BD Biosciences)
to stimulate IFN-c production of T lymphocytes. Cells were then
restimulated with 500 ng Ionomycin (Sigma–Aldrich), 5 ng/ml
PMA (Sigma–Aldrich), and protein transport inhibitor (BD Golgi
Plug, BD Biosciences) for 5 h, followed by intracellular staining
for IFN-c (Clone XMG1.2) following the manufacturers’ protocols
(BD, eBioscience) and subsequent ﬂow cytometric analysis (BD
FACS Calibur).
2.7. Flow cytometry
We collected spleens after transcardial perfusion with saline in
anesthetized mice. After homogenization and hypotonic lysis of
red blood cells, the single cell suspension was used for ﬂow cytometric analysis of leukocyte populations and stress hormone
receptors. Leukocyte subpopulations were identiﬁed by cell surface
staining for anti-mouse CD3, CD4, CD8, NK1.1, B220, Ly-6G, CD11b
following the manufacturer’s protocols (eBioscience). After the cell
surface staining, an indirect staining protocol was used for the
detection of GCR and b2-AR in different leukocyte subsets. Brieﬂy,
cells were ﬁxed, and then washed in permeabilization buffer
followed by Fc-block according to the manufacturer’s protocols

(eBioscience). The cells were incubated with rabbit anti-GCR, rabbit anti-b2-AR or normal rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz) for
30 min at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz). In
the course of in vitro incubation with stress hormones, dead cells
were detected using propidium iodide (BD Pharmingen) staining.
Flow cytometry was performed on a Beckton Dickinson FACS
Calibur and LSR II and analyzed by CellQuest Pro and FACS Diva
software, respectively. We used quantitative calibration with the
BD QuantiBRITE PE Beads (BD Bioscience) for ﬂow cytometric
quantiﬁcation of receptor number per cell and QuantiQuest software to standardize the quantiﬁcation in terms of antibodies
bound per cell following the manufacturer’s protocol.
2.8. Statistical analysis
All values are expressed as mean ± SD. Student’s t-test was used
for comparison between 2 groups. For multiple comparisons, oneway ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett’s test was used where all
groups were compared to one control group. One-way ANOVA
was followed by post hoc Tukey’s test for comparing all pairs of
columns. Hormone levels, body weights and spleen weights shown
in Figs. 2 and 3 were tested at each time point using two-way
ANOVA for the model (distal vs. proximal MCAO) and surgery
(sham vs. MCAO). The results of in vivo receptor blockage
experiments were analyzed by two-way ANOVA for surgery
(fSHAM vs. fMCAO) and treatment (saline vs. b2-AR-blocker vs.
oil vs. GCR-blocker). In every case, two-way ANOVA was followed
by post hoc Tukey’s test. The normal distribution of these datasets
was validated by Kolmogorov–Smirnov using GraphPad Prism 5
software. The accepted signiﬁcance level was p < 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Extensive brain ischemia affects neuroendocrine and immune
homeostasis
We induced moderate-sized cortical infarcts by the coagulation
of the distal MCA (cMCAO) and extensive hemispheric infarcts by
transient (60 min) proximal MCA ﬁlament occlusion (fMCAO;
Fig. 1a). Distal MCAO resulted in an infarct volume of 12.8 ±
2.5 mm3, while mice with proximal MCAO had 52.4 ± 5.3 mm3
extensive hemispheric infarcts 1 d following surgery (Fig. 1b).
While mice generally recovered well from moderate-sized infarcts,
only one third of animals with extensive stroke survived up to 7 d
after surgery (Fig. 1c).
We investigated the blood levels of stress hormones in mice
with moderate-sized and extensive hemispheric infarcts, respectively. Plasma metanephrine and serum cortisone concentrations
increased only after extensive ischemia (at d1 for both metanephrine and cortisone fMCAO vs. fSHAM: p < 0.001; Fig. 2a, b). Plasma
levels of both stress hormones were substantially increased
already at 2 h after ischemia-onset and remained elevated during
the 3 d observation period. We further analyzed corticosterone
concentration 1 d after stroke and detected a similar increase of
hormone levels as seen in cortisone (Fig. 2c). Interestingly, plasma
ACTH concentration was increased only 2 h after MCAO, returned
to baseline at 1 d, and was decreased in mice with extensive ischemia 3 d following MCAO (fMCAO vs. fSHAM: p = 0.036; fMCAO vs.
cMCAO: p < 0.001; Fig. 2d), suggesting that prolonged cortisone
upregulation does not depend on continued ACTH stimulation.
Body weight, spleen weight and splenocyte number were
decreased after extensive hemispheric but not after moderatesized cortical infarction (Fig. 3a, b, Suppl. Fig 1). The cell-loss
affected predominantly the lymphocyte subpopulations. One day

after extensive stroke, T cells were reduced to 30.1 ± 6.5%, B cells to
31.9 ± 5.9%, and NK cells to 47.5 ± 11.2% of cell numbers counted in
sham animals (p < 0.001 for all lymphocyte populations). In contrast, granulocyte and monocyte counts were increased 2 h after
stroke to 211.0 ± 62.5% and 146.1 ± 38.9% of sham cell counts,
respectively (p < 0.001 and p = 0.017, respectively), were on the
level of sham operated controls at 24 h and were subsequently
reduced 3 d after stroke (Fig 3c).

The susceptibility of different leukocyte populations to
epinephrine-induced cell death did not differ between the lymphocyte, granulocyte and monocyte subpopulations. In contrast, prednisolone had a signiﬁcantly stronger effect on lymphocytes than on
granulocytes and monocytes (over all p < 0.0001; Fig. 4c).

3.2. Lymphocytes are more susceptible to prednisolone-induced cell
death than innate immune cells

We investigated expression of b2-AR and GCR in naive leukocytes in order to determine whether the different susceptibility
of leukocyte subpopulations to stress hormone-induced cell death
depends on a differential expression of hormone receptors
(Fig. 4d). All leukocyte subpopulations expressed both b2-ARs
and GCRs. The number of b2-AR on naive leukocytes did not differ
between the subpopulations (over all p = 0.098; Fig. 4e) which is
consistent with the similar effect of epinephrine on cell death
detected in leukocyte subpopulations. In contrast, lymphocytes
expressed signiﬁcantly more GCRs than granulocytes and monocytes (over all p < 0.0001) consistent with their higher susceptibility to prednisolone-induced cell death (Fig. 4e). These results
indicate that the extent of glucocorticoid-induced cell death of
lymphocytes might depend on their differential expression of
GCR explaining the selective lymphocyte-loss after extensive brain
lesions.

To investigate whether catecholamines and glucocorticoids
affect leukocyte subpopulations differently, splenocyte cultures
from naive mice were incubated with 100 nM epinephrine or 10
nM prednisolone in vitro for 18 h. Concentrations of hormones
and the incubation time were chosen according to pilot experiments (Suppl. Fig 2a). Epinephrine resulted in a 33.2% increase in
the proportion of propidium iodide positive (PI+) dead cells
compared to untreated controls (37.0 ± 2.7% vs. 27.8 ± 4.4%;
p = 0.004), while prednisolone increased the proportion of PI + cells
by 117.4% compared to control (77.8 ± 7.7% vs. 36.1 ± 6.0%;
p < 0.001; Fig. 4a, b). To dissect which sympathetic receptors were
responsible for this effect of epinephrine, we used different
catecholamine receptor-blockers. The effect of epinephrine was
blocked only by the non-selective b-blocker propranolol and by
the selective b2-blocker ICI 118551. In contrast, the a-blocker
phentolamine and b1-blocker atenolol did not inﬂuence the
proportion of PI+ cells demonstrating the role of b2-AR in catecholamine-induced leukocyte death (Fig. 4b).
The glucocorticoid receptor blocker RU486 prevented prednisolone-induced cell death (Fig. 4b) in a dose-dependent manner
(Suppl. Fig. 2b).

their hormone receptor expression

3.4. GCR-blockade prevents lymphopenia while b2-AR-blockade
prevents T cell dysfunction
We investigated the in vivo effects of pharmacological blockade
of stress hormone receptors on spleen weight and splenocyte number 1 d after extensive infarction. The GCR-blocker RU486 normalized spleen weight (GCR-bl vs. oil: p = 0.022; GCR-bl vs. b2-AR-bl:

Fig. 2. Stress hormone levels increase only after extensive ischemia. (a) Levels of metanephrine, (b) cortisone, (c) corticosterone and (d) ACTH were determined 2 h, 1 d and
3 d following surgery in coagulation MCAO (cMCAO) with respective sham (cSHAM) and ﬁlament MCAO (fMCAO) with respective sham (fSHAM) operated animals. Naive
mice were used as controls. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. In Panel a, b and d, two-way ANOVA for model (coagulation vs. ﬁlament) and for surgery (naive vs. SHAM vs.
MCAO) was performed followed by post hoc Tukey’s test for group comparison at each time point after surgery.  p < 0.05 vs. naive, ⁄p < 0.05 vs. fSHAM, #p < 0.05 vs. cMCAO
(n = 6 values per group each pooled from 2 mice). In panel c, one-way ANOVA was used followed by post hoc Tukey’s test.  p < 0.05 vs. naive, #p < 0.05 vs. cMCAO (n = 5
animals per group).

p = 0.005; Fig. 5a) and splenic lymphocyte counts (Fig. 5b). In
blood, RU486 had a profound effect only on T cell counts (GCR-bl
vs. oil and GCR-bl vs. b2-AR-bl: p < 0.001, while NK cells and B cells
were not affected by this treatment (Fig. 5c). In contrast, the b2blocker ICI 118551 had no effect on spleen weight and lymphocyte
numbers in the spleen or blood. To rule out effects of receptor
blockage that might be unrelated to ischemia, we performed ICI
118551 and RU486 treatment also in sham animals. We did not
detect differences between untreated, b2-adrenergic receptor and
glucocorticoid receptor blocker-treated animals regarding spleen
weight or the ratios as well as absolute numbers of lymphocyte
subsets in blood or spleen (Supplementary Fig. 3).
To investigate the effect of stress hormones and hormone receptor-blockers on T cell function, we analyzed ex vivo IFN-c secretion
of isolated splenocytes. Corresponding to previous reports characterizing the delayed kinetics of impaired IFN-c production in the
peripheral immune system (Haeusler et al., 2008; Offner et al.,
2006), we isolated splenocytes 3 d after severe ischemia (fMCAO)
from b2-blocker ICI 118551 or GCR-blocker RU486 treated mice
and stimulated them in vitro for the analysis of IFN-c secretion
(Fig. 5d). In accordance with a previous report (Prass et al.,
2003), IFN-c production by lymphocytes which had been isolated
from saline treated extensive stroke mice was decreased compared
to sham operated controls. Interestingly, treatment with the b2AR-blocker completely restored IFN-c-secreting capacities of splenic lymphocytes while the GCR-blocker had no effect (over all
p = 0.0095; Fig. 5e).

Our results suggest that GCR stimulation induces lymphocytopenia, while catecholamines seem to be responsible for the
impaired lymphocytic IFN-c secretion after extensive stroke.

3.5. Glucocorticoids decrease the plasma concentration of
metanephrine and down-regulate b2-ARs on lymphocytes
To investigate interactions between the sympathetic and HPA
systems following extensive stroke, we determined metanephrine,
cortisone and corticosterone serum levels of b2-AR-blocker and
GCR-blocker-treated mice 24 h after fMCAO (Fig. 6a). Pretreatment with the b2-AR-blocker ICI 118551 did not inﬂuence
metanephrine, cortisone and corticosterone levels. In contrast,
treatment with the GCR-blocker RU 486 increased cortisone and
corticosterone serum concentrations as well as metanephrine
plasma concentrations (GCR-bl vs. sal and GCR-bl. vs. b2-AR-bl:
p < 0.001).
Moreover, we investigated the in vitro effect of epinephrine and
prednisolone on the b2-AR and GCR expression of different leukocyte subsets in splenocyte culture (Fig. 6b). Epinephrine did not
affect hormone receptor expression, while prednisolone decreased
the number of its own receptors (epinephrine vs. prednisolone
p = 0.012) and the numbers of b2-Ars (epinephrine vs. prednisolone p = 0.0007) on lymphocytes.
Taken together, these results indicate that glucocorticoids
attenuate the sympathetic stress response by decreasing the

plasma concentration of catecholamines and by downregulating
the expression of b2-AR on lymphocytes.
4. Discussion
The major new ﬁndings of the present study are that (1) serum
levels of key stress hormones are only increased after experimental
extensive hemispheric infarction but not moderate-sized cortical
infarcts. (2) Post stroke lymphocytopenia is associated with
increased glucocorticoid levels and can be abrogated by GCRinhibitors. (3) Increased catecholamine levels induce altered
lymphocyte IFN-c secretion via the b2-AR. (4) Glucocorticoids
downregulate catecholamine levels and b2-AR expression on
lymphocytes.
Acute ischemic stroke in patients results in increased activity of
the HPA axis, increased cortisol production and elevated circulating cortisol levels (Fassbender et al., 1994; Olsson et al., 1992).
Clinical stroke is also followed by elevated catecholamine plasma
levels (Sander et al., 2001). In our present work, only extensive
infarction increased levels of metanephrine, cortisone and corticosterone whereas moderate-sized cortical infarcts had no effect.
This ﬁnding is consistent with our previous observations in stroke
patients (Liesz et al., 2013). Metanephrine and normetanephrine
are the main products of catecholamine metabolism mediated by
catechol-O-methyl-transferase (Eisenhofer et al., 1995). As sympathetic nerves do not contain this enzyme, and 91% of plasma metanephrine is produced under stress conditions in the adrenal
medullary gland (Eisenhofer et al., 1998), our results reﬂect catecholaminergic activity of the adrenomedulla. Cortisone is a biolog-

ically inactive glucocorticoid whose plasma concentration is in
dynamic equilibrium with its active form (Ichikawa et al., 1977).
Accordingly, by measuring the concentration of the active glucocorticoid corticosterone we detected hormone level changes similar to cortisone. Increased glucocorticoid levels were associated
with elevated ACTH levels only in the hyperacute phase after
stroke in the present study. In patients with acute stroke, increased
(Olsson et al., 1992) or abnormally low (Schwarz et al., 2003) secretion of ACTH has been reported. Others found an initial increase of
ACTH levels followed by a suppression in stroke patients
(Fassbender et al., 1994; Liesz et al., 2013) which is in accordance
with our present data. This suggests that delayed glucocorticoid
production occurs independent of stimulation by ACTH. Supposedly, IL-6, IL-1b and other cytokines may directly augment adrenal
function after cerebral ischemia and increase glucocorticoid secretion (Johansson et al., 1997; Woiciechowsky et al., 1999a).
In parallel with the induction of stress hormones, only extensive infarcts resulted in reduced spleen weight and decreased splenic cellularity. Among the different subsets of leukocytes, we found
a relative increase of the proportion of granulocytes and monocytes during the ﬁrst 3 days after MCAO. This conﬁrms our previous results (Liesz et al., 2009) and is consistent with ﬁndings of
reduced splenic cellularity and an attenuated response of splenic
and circulating T lymphocytes to mitogens (Offner et al., 2006).
Moreover, infarct volume is the main factor associated with lymphopenia and increased monocyte number in stroke patients
(Chamorro et al., 2007a; Hug et al., 2009).
Our in vitro results show that leukocytes are much more sensitive to undergo necrosis after exposure to prednisolone compared

to epinephrine. Glucocorticoids are potent inducers of lymphocyte
apoptosis (Tuckermann et al., 2005) and this effect is mediated via
the GCR (Pratt et al., 1996). Accordingly, in the present study the
cell death rate was signiﬁcantly higher among lymphocytes than
granulocytes or monocytes, GCR-blockade prevented prednisolone-induced cell death, and the susceptibility of leukocyte
populations to prednisolone-induced apoptosis correlated with
their GCR expression. Catecholamines may also affect intestinal
lymphocyte number and apoptosis (Marra et al., 2005). Moreover,
the non-selective b-blocker propranolol prevented apoptosis of
splenocytes after murine stroke (Prass et al., 2003). All immune
cells express adrenoceptors (Kohm and Sanders, 2001) with a predominance of b1-AR and b2-AR (Fuchs et al., 1988; Molinoff and
Aarons, 1983; Radojcic et al., 1991). The b2-AR binding was found

to have a stimulatory effect on Th1 cytokine production (RamerQuinn et al., 1997) and a key role in antigen cross-presentation
by dendritic cells (Herve et al., 2013). However, the role of b2-AR
in catecholamine-induced leukocyte cell death after stroke had
not been investigated yet. Our in vitro data indicate that the
b2-AR mediates the moderate catecholaminergic effects on leukocyte apoptosis. We did not ﬁnd a difference in the susceptibility
towards epinephrine among the different leukocyte subsets, which
correspond with the similar expression of b2-AR in these cell
populations.
In accordance with the in vitro data, only GCR-blockade prevented the reduction of splenic lymphocytes and normalized T cell
counts in blood after extensive ischemia. For the investigation of T
cell function, their key effector cytokine IFN-c (Schoenborn and

important cytokine against post-stroke bacterial infections (Prass
et al., 2003) and it is also perceived as a main cytokine in secondary
neuroinﬂammation after stroke (Iadecola and Anrather, 2011). In

contrast to T cell counts in spleen and blood, only b2-AR-blockade
prevented the attenuation of lymphocytic IFN-c production. Our
ﬁndings concerning a b-AR-induced lymphocyte dysfunction corresponds to previous experimental studies (Prass et al., 2006,

2003). The present study, however, demonstrates for the ﬁrst time
selective b2-AR-dependent pathway for lymphocyte function in
respect to IFN-c-secretion which is independent of glucocorticoid-induced lymphocyte necrosis. We did not investigate the
mainly monocyte-derived cytokines TNF-a and IL-10. However,
higher monocyte counts and increased IL-10 levels are predictors
of post-stroke infections (Chamorro et al., 2006). Additionally,
IL-10 inhibits IFN-c production by Th1 cells and suppresses T lymphocyte proliferation (Friedman et al., 1997) and therefore
deserves further attention in post-stroke immunosuppression.
The permissive effects of glucocorticoids on the effects of catecholamines in the heart have long been known (Seleznev Iu and
Martynov, 1982). Glucocorticoids regulate b-AR density of heart
muscle (Dangel et al., 1996) and pulmonary smooth muscle (Mak
et al., 1995). However, potential interactions between the glucocorticoid and the catecholaminergic system had not been investigated so far after stroke and in terms of peripheral immune cells.
In the present study, prednisolone decreased the expression of
b2-ARs on lymphocytes in vitro which may render these cells less
susceptible to catecholaminergic stimulation. Moreover, the higher
catecholamine blood levels caused by the pharmacological
blockade of GCR suggest a negative feedback mechanism of
corticosteroids on the sympathetic axis. Similar observations were
reported from surgical stress experiments where adrenalectomized animals had markedly elevated norepinephrine and dopamine responses to cholecystectomy which was decreased by
cortisol administration (Udelsman et al., 1987). This interaction
may have an important role in controlling the post-stroke stressreaction.

Although glucocorticoids were mainly responsible for lymphocytopenia in the present study, the majority of previous studies
attribute a more important role to the sympathetic system for
the development of infectious complications. One study found that
the incidence of pneumonia is lower in stroke patients taking betablockers on admission (Dziedzic et al., 2007). The present and a
previous experimental study (Prass et al., 2003) suggest that the
preservation of IFN-c production is a potential effector mechanism
of beta-blockers responsible for less susceptibility to post-stroke
infections. As a larger infarct size is correlated with a stronger
endocrine response, in more extensive immunosuppression
(Chamorro et al., 2007a; Haeusler et al., 2008; Hug et al., 2009;
Liesz et al., 2009, 2013; Minnerup et al., 2010) and in a higher incidence of infections (Chamorro et al., 2007a; Haeusler et al., 2008;
Heuschmann et al., 2004), patients with extensive infarcts should
be regarded as the primary target of therapeutic interventions aiming to alleviate post-stroke immunosuppression and to prevent
infectious complications.
The major limitation of the present study is the use of pharmacological blockade of the SNS and HPA axis in vivo. Although we
performed extensive in vitro experiments, effects of these agents
beyond their impact on immune cells in in vivo experiments cannot
be ruled out.
In conclusion, mediators of the SNS and the HPA axis have differential and interactive effects on the systemic immune system
after stroke. A better understanding of the complex interplay
between both systems and potentially other signaling pathways
is necessary to design interventions targeting the important consequences of post stroke immune dysregulation.
