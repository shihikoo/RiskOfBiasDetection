Background: This study was performed to determine whether there is an association
between microregional O2 balance and neuronal survival in cerebral ischemiaâ€“reperfusion using dexmedetomidine, an a2-adrenoreceptor agonist and a sedative.
Methods: Rats were subjected to 1 hour middle cerebral artery occlusion and a 2hour reperfusion. During reperfusion, normal saline (n 5 14) or dexmedetomidine
1 mg/kg/minute (n 5 14) was infused intravenously. At 2 hours of reperfusion,
regional cerebral blood flow using 14C-iodoantipyrine autoradiography, microregional arterial and venous (20-60 mm in diameter) O2 saturation (SvO2) using cryomicrospectrophotometry, and the size of cortical infarction were determined.
Results: Ischemiaâ€“reperfusion decreased microregional SvO2 (52.9 6 3.7% vs.
61.1 6 .6%, P , .005) with increased variation or heterogeneity (P , .0001) with
similar regional cerebral blood flow and O2 consumption. Dexmedetomidine during
reperfusion decreased the heterogeneity of SvO2 that was analyzed with an analysis
of variance (P , .01) and reported as coefficient of variation (100 3 standard deviation/Mean) (11.8 vs. 16.4). The number of veins with O2 saturation less than 50%
decreased with dexmedetomidine (13/80 vs. 27/81, P , .01). The percentage of
cortical infarct in total cortex was smaller with dexmedetomidine (8.3 6 2.2% vs.
12.6 6 1.5%, P , .005). Conclusions: In the cerebral ischemic reperfused cortex, dexmedetomidine decreased the heterogeneity of SvO2 and the number of small veins
with low O2 saturation suggesting improved microregional O2 supply/consumption balance. The improvement was accompanied by the reduced size of cortical
infarction. Key Words: Cerebral ischemia reperfusionâ€”cerebral O2 supply and
consumption balanceâ€”cerebral venous O2 saturationâ€”a2 agonist.

Variation or heterogeneity of microregional O2 supply/
consumption balance, venous O2 saturation (SvO2), and
O2 tension has been reported in both normal and ischemic
conditions in the brain.1-3 There are also reports of spatial
and temporal heterogeneity in molecular responses,
microvascular responses, and neuronal injury in
cerebral ischemia.4-6
In focal cerebral ischemia, restoring regional cerebral
blood flow (rCBF) as early as possible to reduce ischemic
brain injury is the primary goal of treatment. It is usually
beneficial and reduces ischemic brain injury.7,8 However,
restoration of rCBF may not guarantee an improved
neurologic outcome because restoration of blood flow to
an ischemic area may add various pathophysiologic

changes to an already ischemic region and may not
guarantee improved O2 supply and consumption
balance despite improved or restored rCBF.2,9-11
Microregional SvO2 is the final product of microregional
O2 supply and consumption balance that includes
variations of rCBF, hemoglobin (Hb), microregional
arterial saturation (SaO2), and SvO2. Because SaO2 is
essentially constant and independent of ischemic status
or regions,1,12 microregional SvO2 would represent
local O2 supply and consumption balance in the
microregions. Our recent data showed a decrease of
average microregional SvO2 after focal ischemia, but
with a 2-hour reperfusion, the SvO2 did not increase.
Despite return of rCBF, the decrease of O2 supply/consumption balance continued during the reperfusion
period. The heterogeneity of microregional SvO2 and
number of veins with low O2 saturation increased in the
focal ischemic area and increased further with reperfusion without a significant change in average SvO2. There
were many microregions with low SvO2 in the reperfused
cortical area.12 We speculated that decreasing number of
microregions with low O2 balance or low SvO2 would
be beneficial for neuronal survival.
Dexmedetomidine is an a2 adrenoreceptor agonist and is
used as a sedative and an analgesic especially in a
neurointensive care unit.13,14 It is known to decrease
rCBF and cerebral O2 consumption and produces
neuroprotection in focal and global cerebral ischemia.15-19
Previous study suggested that dexmedetomidine might
help provide optimal cerebral O2 supply and
consumption balance during hemorrhage.16 This study
was performed to test the hypothesis that dexmedetomidine infusion during reperfusion would decrease the variation of microregional SvO2 and the number of veins with
low O2 saturation, thus improving microregional O2 supply/consumption balance in the ischemic reperfused cortex (IR-C). We also determined the size of cortical
infarction at the end of 2 hours of reperfusion to see
whether there is any association between microregional
O2 balance and neuronal injury in the early stage of reperfusion. We used an intraluminal monofilament model of
middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Cryomicrospectrophotometry and autoradiography were used to
determine microregional SvO2, SaO2, and rCBF. Tetrazolium staining was used to determine the size of cortical
infarction.

28 male Fischer 344 rats weighing 240-270 g were
initially anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in an air and oxygen mixture through a tracheal tube and were mechanically ventilated. A femoral artery and vein were
cannulated. The venous catheter was used to administer
radioactive tracer, dexmedetomidine, and normal saline.
The artery catheter was connected to Statham P23Db
pressure transducer (Gulton-Statham, Rochester, NY)
and an iWorx data acquisition system (Iworx Systems,
Dover, NH) to monitor heart rate and blood pressure.
This catheter was also used to obtain arterial blood samples for analysis of Hb, blood gases, and pH using a Radiometer blood gas analyzer (ABL80; Radiometer America,
Westlake, OH). The isoflurane concentration was maintained at 1.4% after MCA occlusion. Body temperature
was monitored and maintained at 37 6 .5 C with a servocontrolled rectal thermistor probe and a heating lamp.
Temporalis muscle temperature was monitored as a
representative pericranial temperature using a thermocouple probe (Omega Engineering, Inc, Stamford, CT),
and it averaged 37 C.
We used the transient occlusion of the MCA using an intraluminal thread as our technique to study cerebral
ischemiaâ€“reperfusion.20,21 The common carotid artery
was exposed through a midline ventral cervical incision
and carefully separated from the adjacent nerve. Then a
4.0 monofilament thread with its tip covered with silicon
was inserted into the stump of the external carotid artery
and advanced approximately 1.7 cm into the internal
carotid artery until resistance was felt. The filament was
held in place for 60 minutes blocking the MCA. The
filament was then removed, allowing reperfusion, and
the external carotid artery was closed. All measurements
were performed after 120 minutes of reperfusion.
Animals were randomly assigned to 2 groups. For the
dexmedetomidine group (n 5 14), dexmedetomidine
(10 mg/mL) 1 mg/kg/minute was infused intravenously
during this 2-hour reperfusion period.16,22 The normal
saline group (n 5 14), the same volume of normal saline
was infused at the same rate during this period. In the
randomly selected 8 rats in each group, rCBF and
microscopic O2 saturations of small veins and arteries
were determined in the IR-C, contralateral cortex (CC),
and pons. In 6 rats in each group, the size of cortical infarct
was also determined at 2 hours of reperfusion.

Determination of rCBF

Materials and Methods
Animal Preparation
This investigation was conducted in accordance to US
Public Health Service Guidelines using the Guide for
the Care of Laboratory Animals (DHHS Publication No.
85-23, revised 1996) and was approved by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

rCBF was measured by the 14C-iodoantipyrine quantitative autoradiographic technique. Briefly, 40 mCi of 14Ciodoantipyrine was infused intravenously. When the
isotope entered the venous circulation, the arterial catheter
was cut to 20 mm to minimize smearing. Twenty blood
samples were obtained from the arterial catheter approximately every 3 seconds during next 60 seconds. At the
moment when the last sample was obtained the animal

was decapitated, and the head was frozen in liquid nitrogen. While frozen, the brain was sampled from 3 regions:
IR-C, CC, and pons. The brain samples were sectioned
(20 mm) on a microtome cryostat, and the sections were
exposed to X-ray film to obtain an autoradiogram. The cerebral 14C-iodoantipyrine concentrations were determined
by reference to 8 precalibrated standards (40-1069 nCi/g,
Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) using the NIH imageJ program (www.NIH.gov). For each brain region
examined, a minimum of 8 optical density measurements
were made, each on different sections. Blood samples
were placed in a tissue solubilizer and 24 hours later put
in a counting liquid. These samples were counted on a
liquid scintillation counter and were quench corrected. Determinations of rCBF were then calculated using equation
published previously.1,16

head and sliced in coronal sections using a straight edge
razor blade. There were typically 3-4 slices of approximately 2-3 mm thickness each from each brain. The slices
were placed in the tetrazolium chloride solution and incubated for 30 minutes. The tetrazolium chloride was then
poured off, and the slices were washed 3 times in PBS,
1 minute per wash. Each slice was then placed in a small
weighing boat with PBS to keep it from drying out. The
boat was placed on a dissecting microscope and a clean
slide was placed over the weighing boat. The cortical region of each slice was traced onto the slide using a
.3-mm marker. Any infarcted areas were marked by
cross-hatching over any areas not well marked with tetrazolium stain. The slides were then scanned. The scanned
images were then measured for total and infarcted areas
using ImageJ. Cortical infarcted areas are reported as
percent of total cortical area.

Determination of Microregional SaO2 and SvO2
Alternate sections of the brain tissue that were used for
determining rCBF were used for the determination of arterial and SvO2. These cortical sections were from an approximately 5-mm plug taken from the parietal cortex over the
MCA. Details of this technique have been published previously.23,24 Briefly, the brain sections were cut into wafers at
220 C. The regions were mounted with embedding
medium in a microtome cryostat. Twenty micrometer
thick sections were obtained at 235 C under a N2
atmosphere. The sections were transferred to precooled
glass slides and covered with degassed silicone oil
and a coverslip. These slides were placed on a
microspectrophotometer fitted with an N2-flushed cold
stage to obtain readings of optical density at 568, 560,
and 523 nm. This 3-wavelength method corrects for the
light scattering in the frozen blood. Only vessels in the
transverse section were studied so that the path of light traversed only the blood. The size of the measuring spot was
8 mm in diameter. Readings were obtained to determine O2
saturation in 5 arteries and 10 veins (20-60 mm in diameter)
in each region. Arterioles and venules were differentiated
by presence or absence of muscle layers. The O2 content of
blood was determined by multiplying the percent O2 saturation by the Hb concentration times 1.36, the maximal
binding capacity of Hb for O2 per gram. The difference between the average arterial and venous O2 contents
(regional O2 extraction) was then obtained. Using the
Fick principle, we calculated the O2 consumption for
each region as the product of average flow and O2 extraction. This method has been validated in the brain.

Determination of Size of Cortical Infarct
For determination of the size of cortical infarction, a
tetrazolium staining was performed as follows. A .05%
solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma)
solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was prepared
and warmed to 37 C. The brain was removed from the

Statistical Analysis
A 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed
for the various measurements to assess the difference between the different regions (used as a repeated measures
within treatment) and treatments examined for hemodynamic, blood gases, cerebral blood flow, and O2 balance
parameters. Analysis was conducted using the general
linear model (PROC GLM) from the SAS Institute (Cary,
NC). Post hoc testing of multiple comparisons was performed using Tukey procedure. An ANOVA was used
to analyze the distribution, and the heterogeneity or variability of all SvO2 determined. The coefficient of variation
(CV) of SvO2 was also reported to describe heterogeneity.
The CV was calculated as 100 3 standard deviation (SD)/
mean. A c2 test was also used to assess differences in the
distribution of SvO2 and differences in the number of low
O2 saturated veins between groups. Nonpaired t test was
used to assess the difference in the size of infarct between
the groups. A value of P less than .05 was considered as
statistically significant. All values are expressed as
mean 6 SD.

Results
Hemodynamic and Blood Gas Parameters
Hemodynamic and blood gas parameters in the dexmedetomidine and normal saline groups of rats before determining O2 balance are listed in Table 1. The mean arterial
blood pressure was not significantly decreased, but the
heart rate was significantly decreased (226%, P , .001)
with dexmedetomidine infusion (Table 1.) Arterial blood
gases, pH, and Hb were not significantly different between the 2 experimental groups. Hemodynamic and
blood gas parameters of rats that were used for
measuring the size of infarct were also similar to the corresponding group.

SaO2 and SvO2
The average SaO2 was similar in all regions and groups
(Table 2). However, the average of SvO2 was significantly
lower in the IR-C compared with the CC in both the normal
saline (P ,.005) and dexmedetomidine groups (P ,.0001,
Table 2). The average ratio of O2 supply and consumption
of the IR-C was significantly lower than that of the corresponding CC in both the dexmedetomidine (P , .005)
and the normal saline group (P , .0001; Table 2).

There was a significant shift to lower values in the IR-C
compared with the CC in both groups (normal saline,
P , .0001; dexmedetomidine, P , .0001). The distribution
of SvO2 was significantly shifted (P ,.01) to higher values
with dexmedetomidine in the IR-C compared with
normal saline group. The degree of heterogeneity of
SvO2 was analyzed by ANOVA and reported as CV
(CV 5 100 3 SD/mean) obtained from the distribution
curve (Fig 2). Ischemia reperfusion significantly increased
the heterogeneity of SvO2 in the normal saline (P , .0001)
and in the dexmedetomidine-treated rats (P ,.0001). Dexmedetomidine treatment significantly decreased the heterogeneity of microregional SvO2 (P , .01) in the IR-C.
The values of CV were 16.4 and 5.3 for the IR-C and
CC, respectively in the normal saline group and 11.8
and 5.0 for the dexmedetomidine group. The number of
veins with oxygen saturation below 50% was significantly
less in the dexmedetomidine than in the normal saline
group (13 of 80 vs. 27 of 81; ANOVA, P , .01; c2,
P , .005) in the IR-C. In the CC, no veins with O2 saturation below 50% were observed in either group.

Size of Cortical Infarct
The size of cortical infarct determined at the end of a 2hour reperfusion was significantly smaller with
dexmedetomidine-treated than normal saline-treated
rats (8.3 6 2.2% vs. 12.6 6 1.5%, P , .005).

rCBF and O2 Consumption
rCBF or the oxygen consumption was not significantly

groups (Fig 1, B).
The oxygen extraction of the IR-C was significantly
elevated compared with the CC in the normal saline
group (121%, P , .01) and in the dexmedetomidine
group (120%, P , .001, Fig 1, C).

Distribution of SvO2
The distribution of all SvO2 determined was heterogeneous in both cortical regions in both groups (Fig 2).

We also compared the effects of dexmedetomidine during reperfusion in the remote cerebral region, the pons.
There were no significant differences in the cerebral blood
flow (normal saline, 129 6 50 vs, dexmedetomidine,
104 6 32 mL/minute/100 g) in the pons between groups.
The oxygen extraction (normal saline, 4.3 6 .6 vs. dexmedetomidine, 4.7 6 .4 mL O2/100 mL) was also similar between the 2 experimental groups in the pons. The oxygen
consumption of the pons was also not significantly
different in comparison between the groups (normal saline 5.5 6 2.0 vs. dexmedetomidine 4.9 6 1.4 mL O2/
min/100 g).

Discussion
Our data indicated that ischemia reperfusion decreased
the average microregional SvO2 and increased the number of veins with low O2 saturation with increase in variation. Dexmedetomidine infusion during reperfusion
decreased the number of veins with low O2 saturation
with reduced size of cortical infarct determined at 2 hours
after reperfusion.
In this study, the ratio of O2 supply and consumption in
a region was determined by dividing local O2 supply by
local O2 consumption; CaO2 3 CBF/CBF (CaO22CvO2),
where CaO2 and CvO2 are the arterial and venous O2 content, respectively, and CBF is the cerebral blood flow.
CaO2 or CvO2 was determined by multiplying SaO2 or
SvO2 by Hb times 1.36, the maximum binding capacity

of Hb for O2 per gram. This equation cancels out Hb,
1.36, and rCBF. This reduces to SaO2/(SaO22SvO2),
where SaO2 and SvO2 are the percent oxyhemoglobin in
the arterial and venous blood, respectively. Because
SaO2 is essentially constant and independent of ischemic
status or regions, individual microregional SvO2 could
reflect the final product of microregional O2 supply and
consumption. SvO2 variability in this study represents
the heterogeneity of O2 supply/consumption ratio on microregional basis. Our data on heterogeneity of SvO2 in
the ischemia reperfusion is similar to our previous reports.12 Increased heterogeneity was considerable and
dexmedetomidine lowered the heterogeneity in the IR-C.
Ischemia reperfusion activates various pathophysiologic
reactions including plateletâ€“leukocyte aggregation, release
of inflammatory agents and free radicals, interstitial and

cellular edema, and decrease of endothelium-dependent
vascular responses.2,8-11 It is possible that reperfusion
caused microregional blockage or hyperemia and caused
irregular distribution of rCBF.11,25 Ischemia reperfusion
could have rendered the neurons excited, normal,
nonfunctioning or dead producing increase, or decrease
in the O2 consumption in various microscopic areas.26,27
This anatomic and functional heterogeneity could have
caused mismatch between O2 supply and consumption,
thus producing heterogeneity of microregional SvO2. We
hypothesized that dexmedetomidine would decrease the
heterogeneity of SvO2 and would improve microregional
O2 balance during reperfusion.
It has been reported that dexmedetomidine decreases cerebral metabolism and decreases cerebral blood flow.15,16
Vasoconstriction produced by dexmedetomidine in the
normal cortex could have helped redistribute blood flow
to the IR-C contributing to a more complete restoration of
blood flow to this region in this study. Local application
of atipamezole, an a2-adrenergic antagonist, could block
pial arteriolar vasoconstriction induced by local application of dexmedetomidine.28 Pial vasoconstriction induced
by systemic dexmedetomidine, however, was only slightly
attenuated by local atipamezole.28 Systemic dexmedetomidine may decrease cerebral O2 consumption and induce
vasoconstriction indirectly.15,16,28,29 Dexmedetomidine has
been known to decrease neuronal excitation and O2
consumption and to produce sedative effects.15,16,18,30
The rCBF of IR-C appeared lower than the normal cortex but without a statistical significance. This slightly lowered rCBF could have contributed to the increase in O2
extraction in the control animals. Some of the neurons
could be excited using more oxygen, increasing O2 extraction, and decreasing SvO2 compared with the normal cortex in both groups. In the dexmedetomidine-treated
animals, however, despite restoration of rCBF, O2 extraction was still significantly higher in the IR-C. It is also
possible that more neurons could be alive compared
with the control group using more oxygen in the IR-C.
The almost complete restoration of rCBF and lowering
neuronal O2 consumption by dexmedetomidine could
have contributed to lowering SvO2 heterogeneity and
lowering the number of small veins with low O2 saturation compared with the control animals.
Neuroprotection by dexmedetomidine was reported
in brain ischemia and excitotoxicity.17-19,30,31 However,
neuroprotection by other a2 adrenoreceptor agonist
clonidine is more controversial.32,33 Various mechanisms
for dexmedetomidine-induced neuroprotection were suggested such as involving a2A adrenoreceptor subtypes,
brain derived neurotrophic factors, and P13 K/Akt and
ERK1/2 pathways.19,31,34 This is the first study showing
the possibility that dexmedetomidine could decrease
neuronal damage during reperfusion through a linkage
with improved microscopic O2 supply and consumption
balance and reduced number of small veins with low O2

saturation. It is possible that agents, which decrease
the number of veins with low O2 saturation, could
decrease neuronal damage. The percentage of cortical
infarcted area out of the total cortex was significantly
lower with dexmedetomidine treatment. In this study,
the size of cortical infarction was determined because
SvO2 was measured in the cortical microregions. This
decrease in the size of cortical infarction at 2 hours
after reperfusion would not suggest a long-term effect
of dexmedetomidine. This suggests that this improved
O2 supply/consumption balance reflected in the
decrease in the number of veins with low SvO2 could
be one of the contributory factors deciding the size of
infarct in the acute stage of reperfusion, at least in the
cortical area. However, another study reported that
high dose of dexmedetomidine exacerbated ischemic
brain injury measured at 5 days.22 This different
outcome from that of our study may be because of
various different experimental conditions. The average
O2 consumption in the ischemic reperfused area of the
dexmedetomidine-treated rats was similar to that of
the control animals despite reported effects of dexmedetomidine on decreased cerebral O2 consumption. It suggests that more neurons could be alive enough to extract
necessary oxygen and produce similar average O2 consumption resulting in a decreased size of cortical infarct
because the rCBF was similar between the 2 groups in
the IR-C.
Variations in the mean arterial blood pressure, rCBF,
and Hb between groups even without a statistical significance could have affected our data. The reported rCBF
values are from regions, not from microregions. However, the equation used for O2 supply and consumption
balance cancels out Hb and rCBF. SaO2 was also essentially constant and independent of ischemic status.
Therefore, the individual SvO2 should represent the final
product of the O2 supply and consumption balance in
the microregions. We used isoflurane anesthesia during
the experimental period. It is possible that different anesthetics or awake condition would have produced
different results. In our previous study, dexmedetomidine produced a substantial reduction in rCBF and O2
consumption in the normal cortex.16 The discrepancy
between this study and the previous one could be explained in part by presence or absence of ischemia
reperfusion and differences in duration of isoflurane
anesthesia and strain of rats. The limitation in our measurements of regional cerebral flow and O2 extraction
and consumption was reported previously.23,24 This
technique is one of the few methods of quantitatively,
accurately, and rapidly estimating cerebral O2 balance
in small microregions of normal and ischemic cortex
with drainage fields of cerebral veins of 20-60 mm in
diameter.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that cerebral
ischemia reperfusion reduced the average microregional

a2 AGONIST ON CEREBRAL O2 BALANCE IN REPERFUSION FUNDING : INTRAMURAL DEPARTMENTAL SOURCES

SvO2 and increased the number of small veins with
low O2 saturation with increased heterogeneity. Dexmedetomidine lowered the number of veins with low O2
saturation with decreased heterogeneity. The size of
cortical infarction, which was also determined at 2 hours
of reperfusion decreased with dexmedetomidine. This
decreased number of microregional SvO2 with low O2
saturation with dexmedetomidine suggests improved microregional O2 supply/consumption balance and may
have contributed to the decreased size of cortical infarction in the early stage of reperfusion.
