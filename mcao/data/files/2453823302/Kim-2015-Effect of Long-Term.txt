Fimasartan is a newly developed angiotensin receptor blocker, which may have protective effects during myocardial infarction or
atherosclerosis. In this context, we investigated the effects of long-term treatment with low-dose fimasartan on focal ischemia in rat
brain. We induced focal ischemia in brain by transient intraluminal occlusion of middle cerebral artery (MCA) and administered
low-dose (0.5 mg/kg) or regular doses (1 or 3 mg/kg) of fimasartan via intravenous routes. After the administration of low-dose
(0.5 mg/kg) fimasartan, blood pressure did not decrease compared to the phosphate-buffered saline- (PBS-) control with MCA
occlusion (MCAO) group. The infarct volume and ischemic cell death were reduced in the low-dose fimasartan-treated group
(46 ¬± 41 mm3 for 0.5 mg/kg and 153 ¬± 47 mm3 for PBS-control with MCAO; ùëÉ < 0.01) but not in the regular-dose groups.
Low-dose fimasartan treatment improved functional recovery after ischemia and significantly decreased mortality. In our study,
fimasartan reduced the degradation of IùúÖB and the formation of an inflammatory end-product, COX-2. As a result, the recruitment
of inflammatory cells in the peri-infarct area decreased in fimasartan-treated group. We have demonstrated that long-term, lowdose fimasartan treatment improved outcomes after focal ischemia in the brain via a reduction of inflammation.

1. Introduction
Fimasartan (BR-A-657) is the ninth developed angiotensin
receptor blocker (ARB) from Korea [1]. Fimasartan is a series
of pyrimidin-4(3H)-one derivatives as losartan analogues,
and fimasartan has about six hundredfold affinity for the
angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) compared to equivalent
doses of losartan [2, 3]. In addition to greater potency,
fimasartan is rapidly absorbed following oral administration,
and the time to peak plasma concentration ranges 0.5‚Äì
3 h with comparable safety profile [1]. Thus, it has been
used as an antihypertensive drug in Korea since 2011 after
approval by the Korean Food and Drug Administration. In
addition to lowering blood pressure (BP), there are a few
experimental studies suggesting fimasartan has protective
effects during cardiovascular diseases. Fimasartan decreased

infarct volume and improved functional outcomes during rat
myocardial infarction [4], and it prevented the progression
of atherosclerosis in injured vessels in a rabbit model [5].
However, the effect of fimasartan on focal ischemia in the
brain has not been investigated.
Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide including Korea and presents a disease burden to
patients‚Äô families and society due to disability after stroke
[6]. Despite these detrimental outcomes, stroke treatment has
been limited to recanalization therapy, and there is no practical neuroprotective agent [7, 8]. Some ARBs demonstrated
neuroprotective effects in animal models against ischemic
stroke [9‚Äì11]. However, one of those ARBs (candesartan)
did not demonstrate any beneficial effect for ischemic stroke
patients when administered in the acute phase and may have

Figure 1: Schematic diagram of the study protocols. For Sprague-Dawley rats, low-dose (0.5 mg/kg) or regular doses (1 or 3 mg/kg) were
administered for 4 weeks via an oral route before the induction of transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. At 2 days, western blot
(WB) analyses were performed. At 7 days immunofluorescent staining was performed, and infarct volume was measured. Behavior tests were
performed for 14 days after induction of transient MCA occlusion, and mortality was censored at 28 days. Blood pressure was monitored
during the pretreatment and follow-up period.

even been harmful [12]. It has been postulated that this
failure may originate from lowered BP in the candesartan
treatment group because tissue hypoperfusion might accelerate ischemic damage in the acute phase after stroke. In
some diseases, such as diabetic nephropathy in which the
relative hypotension may promote the progression of the
disease, the effects of low-dose ARBs have been studied [13,
14]. Furthermore, physicians usually choose antihypertensive
drugs according to comorbidities of patients and adverse
events of drugs, not by the outcomes of cardiovascular events
related to hypertension. However, a recent retrospective
cohort study showed that prestroke administration of ARBs
might improve the outcomes of stroke [15]. In this context,
we investigated the effects of long-term treatment with a lowdose novel ARB, fimasartan, on focal ischemia in the rat
brain.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Animals and Experimental Groups. Male SpragueDawley rats (Koatech, Seoul, Republic of Korea), weighing
between 200 and 220 g, were used in these experiments. All
animal studies were performed according to the National
Institutes of Health Guide for the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of the Biomedical Research Institute
at Seoul National University Hospital. We administered
fimasartan at a low-dose (0.5 mg/kg) and a regular dose
(1 or 3 mg/kg) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) orally
for 4 weeks once per day before the induction of ischemia
and reperfusion in the middle cerebral artery (MCA). After
induction of transient MCA occlusion (MCAO), we ceased
the fimasartan administration to prevent BP reductions after
ischemia (Figure 1).
2.2. Focal Ischemia-Reperfusion Model. Focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion was induced with a minor modification of
the endovascular internal carotid artery (ICA) suture method
[16, 17]. After inhalation of 3% isoflurane in 30% oxygen and
70% air, the left common carotid artery (CCA) was exposed at
its bifurcation using a midline cervical incision. The external
carotid artery (ECA), ICA, and CCA were ligated using a 50 silk suture. The CCA was then transected, and a 5-0 nylon
monofilament suture (with its tip rounded by heating) was

inserted into the CCA. To occlude the origins of the MCA and
proximal anterior cerebral artery, the suture was advanced
into the ICA for a distance of 20 mm. The suture was secured
in place using a ligature, and the wound was closed. The
monofilament was removed 60 min after the occlusion. The
animals were allowed food and water ad libitum. Rectal
temperature was maintained at 37 ¬± 0.5‚àò C using a thermistorcontrolled heating blanket. Sham operations were performed
to make a negative control group (ùëõ = 4 for Nissl staining and
ùëõ = 2 for TTC staining).
2.3. Measurement of Infarct Volumes. After cardiac perfusion-fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L PBS,
the brains were removed quickly and cut into 30 ùúám thick
coronal sections on a freezing microtome. Ten brain sections
were mounted onto glass slides and processed for Nissl
staining for measurement of infarct volumes, and to demonstrate infarct areas clearly, TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride) staining was performed (ùëõ = 3 for each group).
The infarct volumes were measured using an image analysis
program, ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
MD).
2.4. In Situ Labeling of DNA Fragmentation. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end
labeling (TUNEL) was performed with the use of a commercially available kit as described previously [18]. Sections
were incubated in a TdT-labeling reaction mixture for 90 min,
colored with DAB solution, and counterstained with methyl
green. A single axial section through the center of the
ischemic lesion was analyzed. Eight sampling regions were
placed along the periphery. TUNEL-positive cells were identified and counted. Total counts in these sampling regions
were converted into cell densities for quantification and
comparison between the treatment and control groups.
2.5. Behavioral Testing and Mortality Check. This test was
a modified version of a test described by a previous study
[19]. The limb-placing test was used to evaluate the outcome
of recovery on postoperative days 1, 3, 7, and 14. The test
assesses the sensorimotor integration of the forelimb and the
hind limb by checking responses to tactile and proprioceptive
stimulation. In the first task, the rat was suspended 10 cm

BioMed Research International
over a table, and the forelimb stretch towards the table
was observed. In the second test, the rat was positioned
towards the table and its forelimbs were placed on the table.
Next, the rats were placed along the table edge to check
for lateral placement of the forelimb (third task). In the
fourth task, the rat was again positioned towards the table
with the hind limbs just over the table edge. Each hind
limb was pulled down and gently stimulated by pushing
towards the side of the table. The 4 tasks were scored in the
following manner: normal performance, 0 points; incomplete
performance, 1 point; no performance, 2 points. A total of 8
points indicated maximal neurological deficit, and 0 points
indicated normal performance. The mortality was checked 28
days after induction of transient MCAO.
2.6. Measurement of Blood Pressures. The BP was recorded
using a CODA Noninvasive Blood Pressure System (Kent
Scientific Corporation, Torrington, CT). The BP is recorded
by a band attached to the tail (homologated by Bland-Altman
testing) [20]. This method is recommended by the American
Heart Association as a measuring guide for laboratory animals [21]. Noninvasive BP monitoring was performed on days
28, 27, 25, 21, 14, and 7, just before MCAO induction. After
MCAO, noninvasive BPs were measured on days 1, 3, and 7.
Invasive BPs were obtained via the femoral artery once before
ischemia (after fimasartan administration for 28 days).
2.7. Immunofluorescent Staining and Cell Quantification.
Immunofluorescent staining of brain tissue was performed
using cryopreserved 40 ùúám coronal sections. Each section
was incubated with 0.5% bovine serum albumin/0.3% TritonX followed by 10% normal serum in PBS for 1 hour for
blocking. Sections with a primary antibody were placed at
4‚àò C for 16 hours. After washing, each section was subsequently incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with
the fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody. Monoclonal
antibodies against MHC class II Ia (Ox6; Santa Cruz Biotech,
Santa Cruz, CA) labeled activated microglia/macrophages.
Stained cells were then examined under a confocal laser
scanning biological microscope (LSM 410 META; Carl Zeiss,
Jena, Germany).
Quantitative analysis of the positively stained cells was
performed in the peri-infarct regions by two independent
investigators (Hong-Kyun Park and Dohoung Kim) who
were masked to the group allocations. To count activated
microglia/macrophages, 16 high-power fields were taken
from the sections through the center of the infarct lesion 7
days after transient MCAO. Total counts in the measured
sections were converted into cell densities for comparison
between fimasartan treatment and control groups according
to our established protocol [22].
2.8. Western Blot Analysis. The rats were killed via decapitation, and the brains were immediately extracted 48 hours
after the induction of transient MCAO. After the centrifugation of hemisphere homogenates, 50 ùúág of protein was
separated on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. These membranes were incubated in blocking buffer

3
(5% skim milk in 50 mmol/L Tris PH 7.5, 0.15 mmol/L NaCl,
and 0.05% Tween-20) and the blots were probed with antibodies recognizing IùúÖB (Cell Signaling Tech., Danvers, MA)
and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2; BD Biosciences, Franklin
Lakes, NJ). Immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced
chemiluminescence, and the relative optical densities were
compared to the mean values of the control group.
2.9. Statistical Analysis. The values are presented as the
means ¬± standard deviations. The data were analyzed with the
nonparametric Mann-Whitney ùëà test for unpaired samples
between two groups, and the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis
ùêª test was used for multiple groups. To compare each group
after the Kruskal-Wallis ùêª test, the Bonferroni correction was
performed as post hoc test. A two-tailed value of ùëÉ < 0.05 was
considered significant. The survival analysis was performed
according to the log-rank test. All statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

3. Results
3.1. Blood Pressure: Pretreatment and Follow-Up Period. The
mean BPs decreased in the regular-dose fimasartan groups
at 3 days, but the mean BPs in the low-dose fimasartan were
not different from PBS-controls with MCAO via noninvasive
monitoring (Figure 2(a)). Because of a one-day diet restriction prior to focal ischemia, the mean BPs in all groups were
lower compared to the resting mean BPs in pretreatment
period. With the single-time invasive monitoring just before
focal ischemia, all BPs, including the systolic, diastolic, and
mean, decreased in the regular-dose fimasartan group but
did not decrease in the low-dose fimasartan group compared
with PBS-controls with MCAO (Figures 2(b), 2(c), and 2(d)).
After inducing focal ischemia, the mean BPs increased in
all groups. The mean BPs in the regular-dose fimasartan
groups returned to the level of the low-dose and control
groups 3 days after inducing focal ischemia because we ceased
fimasartan administration after ischemia to minimize the
possible harmful effects of low BP.
3.2. Infarct Volume and Ischemic Cell Death. Sham operations
did not make any infarct lesions in the brain (Figure 3(a)).
The infarct volume decreased in the low-dose pretreatment
groups compared to the PBS-control with MCAO group
(46 ¬± 41 mm3 for 0.5 mg/kg and 153 ¬± 47 mm3 for control;
ùëÉ by Bonferroni correction between two groups < 0.01;
Figure 3(a)). However, the infarct volumes in the regulardose groups were not different from the PBS-control with
MCAO group (95 ¬± 58 mm3 for 1 mg/kg and 103 ¬± 42 mm3
for 3 mg/kg; ùëÉ by Bonferroni correction = 0.21 for 1 mg/kg
and 0.12 for 3 mg/kg compared to the control group). Based
on this result, we evaluated ischemic cell death, functional
outcomes, mortality, and inflammatory changes between two
groups (low-dose and control) to minimize the number
of animals sacrificed. Ischemic cell deaths also decreased
in the low-dose fimasartan group compared to the PBScontrol with MCAO group as determined by TUNEL staining

3.3. Functional Outcomes and Mortality. Low-dose fimasartan improved functional recovery after focal ischemia compared to the PBS-control with MCAO group. There was
a trend for improved functional scores in the low-dose
fimasartan group, and the functional recovery was prominent
at 14 days after ischemia (2 ¬± 2 points for 0.5 mg/kg and
5 ¬± 3 points for control, ùëÉ < 0.05; Figure 4(a)). The mortality
rate decreased significantly in the low-dose fimasartan group
compared with the PBS-control with MCAO (ùëÉ by log-rank
test < 0.05; Figure 4(b)).

3.4. Inflammatory Cell Recruitment and Inflammatory
Markers. Ox6-stained microglia/macrophages were less
frequently found in the periphery around the lesion, and
the density in the low-dose fimasartan-treated group was
lower than the PBS-control with MCAO group (Figure 5(a)).
According to quantitative analysis, the fimasartan-treated
group exhibited a lower number of Ox6-positive cells
(169 ¬± 54 versus 647 ¬± 167 cells/mm2 ) than the PBS-control
with MCAO group (Figure 5(b)).
After ischemia, IùúÖB was degraded on the lesion hemisphere compared to the contralateral brain in PBS-control
with MCAO animals (relative optical density on the lesion
side for IùúÖB = 0.5 ¬± 0.1). In the low-dose fimasartan-treated

The infarct volume in the low-dose fimasartan group (0.5 mg/kg, ùëõ = 8) decreased significantly compared to the PBS-control with MCAO
group (ùëÉ < 0.05 by Bonferroni correction, ùëõ = 8), but there was no difference between the regular-dose group and PBS-controls with MCAO
(ùëÉ for 1 mg/kg = 0.21 and ùëÉ for 3 mg/kg = 0.12; ùëõ = 6 each). (b) Ischemic cell death, evaluated by TUNEL staining, decreased in the low-dose

group, the degradation of IùúÖB was suppressed to the level of
the contralateral brain in control group (ùëÉ < 0.05; Figures
5(c) and 5(d)). The density of COX-2, the inflammatory endproduct after ischemia, in the infarcted hemisphere was 1.6fold higher in the control group than the fimasartan-treated
group (ùëÉ < 0.05; Figures 5(c) and 5(e)).

4. Discussion
Fimasartan improved the outcomes after ischemic stroke
in the experimental model and decreased inflammation
related to ischemic damage. Inflammation is an important
process that elicits acute damage after brain ischemia [23].
Compared to other pathologic processes after brain ischemia,
inflammation is a potent reaction associated with reactive

oxygen species, necrosis, apoptosis, and tissue remodeling.
Moreover, it is closely related to various cell types such
as microglia/macrophages, endothelial cells, neurons, and
glial cells. In a recent in vitro study, fimasartan decreased
inflammatory reactions in macrophages by reducing a proinflammatory transcription factor, NF-ùúÖB, and inflammatory
end-products such as iNOS [24]. This effect of fimasartan
may have originated from the blocking of angiotensin II,
which has been known to provoke inflammation through AT1
receptor [25]. This kind of anti-inflammatory effect by ARBs
was also observed in the brain. Candesartan suppressed the
expression of cytokine mRNA in LPS-induced inflammatory
brain tissue [26]. In our study, fimasartan reduced the
degradation of IùúÖB, which is a marker for NF-ùúÖB activation,
and the formation of an inflammatory end-product, COX-2.

Figure 4: Functional recovery and mortality after focal cerebral ischemia. (a) Low-dose fimasartan improved functional recovery after
transient focal ischemia compared to PBS-controls with MCAO. This improvement was prominent at 14 days after ischemia (ùëÉ < 0.05;
ùëõ = 17 for 0.5 mg/kg and ùëõ = 12 for control). (b) The mortality rate decreased significantly in the low-dose fimasartan group compared with
PBS-controls with MCAO (ùëÉ by log-rank test < 0.05; ùëõ = 18 each).

As a result, the recruitment of inflammatory cells in the periinfarct area decreased after long-term fimasartan treatment.
Some other ARBs have shown neuroprotective effects
against cerebral ischemia in hypertensive animals [27, 28].
The protective effects focused on the reversal of chronic
vascular damage, which was induced by high BPs. In addition
to this BP lowering effect, some investigators thought that
ARBs might have direct protective effects against focal cerebral ischemia. To evaluate this, a few ARBs were investigated
in normotensive animals. Irbesartan which was injected
intracerebroventricularly decreased infarct volume, apoptosis, and inflammation independent of the systemic effects
[9]. According to this observation, candesartan, which was
administered via an intravenous or oral route, decreased
infarct volume and improved functional outcomes after brain
ischemia in normotensive rats [11, 29]. The experiments that
delivered candesartan systemically were mainly focused on
posttreatment after ischemia and regular doses of ARBs,
which decreased BP. However, in a recent clinical trial,
acute treatment with a regular dose of candesartan was not
beneficial for ischemic stroke patients likely due to tissue
hypoperfusion [12]. Similar to this human trial, we observed
that low-dose fimasartan was superior to the regular doses.
To reveal the protective effect of fimasartan independent of
the BP lowering effects, we administered low-dose fimasartan
to normotensive animals for a long period before inducing
ischemia.
Low-dose ARB treatments have been evaluated in some
disease models [30, 31]. Unlike myocardial infarction where
high BP is directly harmful to ischemic tissue due to the
increased work load of the heart, the brain and kidney are
more vulnerable to relative hypotension in ischemic states
than the heart. For diabetic nephropathy, the beneficial
effects of low-dose ARBs have already been reported [13, 14],
and there are ongoing clinical trials investigating the effects

of low-dose fimasartan on diabetic nephropathy. Without
adequate oxygen and glucose, neurons could not survive
for more than a few minutes [32]. In this context, lowering
the BP during the acute period after cerebral infarction
should be applied cautiously. Low-dose ARB treatment might
be considered as a neuroprotective treatment after cerebral
infarction, and fimasartan is a good candidate for lowdose treatment because it has highly potent affinity for AT1
compared to other ARBs.
The present experiment had a few limitations. First, the
protective effects of fimasartan on focal brain ischemia may
not be exclusively caused by the anti-inflammatory effects of
fimasartan. According to our observations, reducing inflammation could be one of the important beneficial processes of
fimasartan, but other pathologic ways after cerebral ischemia
such as apoptosis or disrupted autoregulation might be
related to the effects of fimasartan. Second, to evaluate the
protective effects of fimasartan independent of its BP lowering effects, our experiment was performed in normotensive
animals. However, because fimasartan is mainly used as an
antihypertensive drug, the neuroprotective effects of regular
doses of fimasartan after cerebral ischemia in hypertensive
animals should be investigated in future experiments.

5. Conclusion
Taken together, we have demonstrated that low-dose, longterm fimasartan treatment improved outcomes after focal
brain ischemia via inflammation reduction. Fimasartan is
already being used to treat hypertension in the daily practice
of some countries because it has high potency and tolerable
safety [1]. From our translational approach with fimasartan,
we found a novel and safe therapeutic candidate to protect
brain tissue after ischemia. After considering the lessons from
experimental and clinical studies with other ARBs [12, 30],

(ùëõ = 4 each). (d) In the quantitative analyses, the degradation of IùúÖB was suppressed in the low-dose fimasartan-treated group in the lesion
and was comparable to the contralateral brain in the PBS-control with MCAO group compared with lesion side in the PBS-control with
MCAO group (ùëÉ < 0.05). (e) The density of COX-2 in the infarcted hemisphere was 1.6-fold higher in the PBS-control with MCAO group
compared to the fimasartan-treated group (ùëÉ < 0.05).

we applied an adequate dose of fimasartan so that its
pleiotropic effect (independent of BP lowering) could be
maximized. We believe that this protective effect of fimasartan will be investigated in human studies for the treatment of
ischemic stroke in the near future.
