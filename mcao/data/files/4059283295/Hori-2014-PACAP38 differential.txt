Abstract: Pituitary adenylate-cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) has neuroprotective
and axonal guidance functions, but the mechanisms behind such actions remain
unclear. Previously we examined effects of PACAP (PACAP38, 1 pmol) injection
intracerebroventrically in a mouse model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
(PMCAO) along with control saline (0.9% NaCl) injection. Transcriptomic and proteomic
approaches using ischemic (ipsilateral) brain hemisphere revealed differentially regulated
genes and proteins by PACAP38 at 6 and 24 h post-treatment. However, as the ischemic

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2014, 15

hemisphere consisted of infarct core, penumbra, and non-ischemic regions, specificity of
expression and localization of these identified molecular factors remained incomplete. This
led us to devise a new experimental strategy wherein, ischemic core and penumbra were
carefully sampled and compared to the corresponding contralateral (healthy) core and
penumbra regions at 6 and 24 h post PACAP38 or saline injections. Both reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to
examine targeted gene expressions and the collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2)
protein profiles, respectively. Clear differences in expression of genes and CRMP2 protein
abundance and degradation product/short isoform was observed between ischemic core and
penumbra and also compared to the contralateral healthy tissues after PACAP38 or saline
treatment. Results indicate the importance of region-specific analyses to further identify,
localize and functionally analyse target molecular factors for clarifying the neuroprotective
function of PACAP38.

1. Introduction
Our group has been investigating a medical condition of the brain, namely brain ischemia also
known as cerebral ischemia/ischemic stroke that is regarded as the third most common cause of death
after heart attack and cancer [1], and the potential neuroprotective effect of pituitary adenylate-cyclase
activating polypeptide (PACAP) therein [2–11]. Utilizing the established permanent middle cerebral
artery occlusion (hereafter referred to as PMCAO) model mice, our experimental strategy was based
on first providing an inventory of the molecular factors, genes and proteins that are differentially
expressed in the ischemic brain hemispheres with or without PACAP38 treatment [12–14]. To note,
these studies employed the intraluminal filament technique PMCAO model because of its simplicity
and noninvasive characteristics compared to the classical electrocoagulation method for PMCAO.
The transient MCAO results in reperfusion injury, and to avoid this complication, the method of choice
in our research projects was using the intraluminal PMCAO model.
Applying the DNA microarray (4x44K whole genome transcriptomic profiling) and two-dimensional
gel electrophoresis (2-DGE) linked with mass spectrometry approaches [15–17], our previous research
revealed the first ischemia-related transcriptome and proteome of the mouse brain, laying a strong
foundation for studies designed to elucidate the mechanisms regulating ischemia and to explore the
neuroprotective effects of agents such as target neuropeptides, including PACAP38 [12–14]. The
large-scale transcriptomic data obtained from these above studies are available under the accession/series
numbers GSE 28201 and GSE 37565 at the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public functional
genomics data repository (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/linking.html). Readers are referred to
these gene expression profiles for further information, download, and/or independent analysis.
Though these were novel findings at the level of transcriptome and proteome providing an overall
picture of the ischemic hemisphere at two time points of 6 and 24 h post-ischemia, the specificity

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2014, 15

17016

of expression and localization of these identified molecular factors in infarct core and penumbra
(ipsilateral), and matching non-ischemic regions (contralateral) remained incomplete. With this in mind,
we asked a question—is there any discernable difference between different regions of the ischemic
brain? To answer that, our present study targeted ischemic core and penumbra regions in the ischemic
hemisphere comparing it to the corresponding contralateral (healthy) core and penumbra regions at
6 and 24 h, post-PACAP38 or -saline injections. The same molecular factors, genes and proteins that
were identified in our previous studies [12,13] were examined. The experimental strategy used for this
study is presented in the Figure 1 (see below).
Figure 1. Experimental design and workflow using the permanent middle cerebral artery
occlusion (PMCAO) model. Effect of the intracerebroventricular administered pituitary
adenylate-cyclase activating polypeptide 38 (PACAP38) into ischemic mouse brain was
evaluated at the molecular level in the ischemic core and penumbra of the ipsilateral
(right) hemisphere along with the corresponding regions in the healthy contralateral
hemisphere (left). All marked brain regions were sampled and finely powdered in liquid
nitrogen, followed by investigation into molecular level changes at the level of genes (mRNA
abundance) and protein expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively.

of CRMP2 Protein

To test our hypothesis that there would be certain differences in expression of these gene and
proteins, depending on the brain regions (core and penumbra) examined, we performed (I) reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of selected genes; and (II) Western blot
analysis of the collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2). The CRMP2, first named as CRMP-62,
was originally identified in 1995 using a Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system [18]. CRMPs, being
multifunctional adaptor proteins/microtubule associated proteins, are highly expressed in brain/central
nervous system [19,20]. In particular, CRMP2 is known to be important in determination of neuronal

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2014, 15

polarity and axonal elongation, involved in axonal damage and neuronal cell death, neurological
disorders, and brain ischemia among other functions being gradually revealed [21–27]. One conclusion
drawn from these past and recent studies is providing a proof-of-concept on pharmacological manipulation
of CRMP2 as a possible therapy development against certain neurological diseases [28,29].
The results presented and discussed below revealed not only distinct expression profiles of these
genes and the CRMP2 protein in ischemic core and penumbra, but also provided some new data over the
previous two studies where the brain hemispheres were used. These results are primarily discussed in
this communication, and the importance of targeted brain region analysis is one of the key messages of
this paper, with regard to further understanding and clarifying the neuroprotective action of PACAP38.
2. Results
Figure 1 illustrates post-PMCAO, the brain regions labeled ischemic core and penumbra in the
ipsilateral (ischemic) hemisphere that were dissected out carefully using a sterile scalpel. In parallel,
similar sized regions in the contralateral hemisphere were also dissected. Both PACAP38 injected and
saline injected brains were dissected and sampled with extreme care at 6 and 24 h post-ischemia and
immediately frozen at −80 °C. It is to be noted that the ischemic core and penumbra was demarcated
based on the visual confirmation and past experience and observations post-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) staining of ischemic brains.
At first, we used these designated brain regions for extraction of total RNA confirming their
appropriate quantity and quality (Figure 2A). As shown in Figure 2B, the expression of glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and β-actin, as positive controls, was confirmed in all dissected
regions from both hemispheres at 6 and 24 h by RT-PCR. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed
as described in Materials and Methods, and the gene-specific primers are detailed in Table 1. Results
showed that the mRNAs for GAPDH and β-actin were expressed almost uniformly across the tested
conditions. With these confirmatory data, we proceeded to check the mRNA expression profiles of
selected target genes (Table 1), which were selected based on our previous research on PACAP
induced or suppressed genes under ischemic conditions [12,13]. Both up-regulated (see below,
Figure 3) and down-regulated (see below, Figure 4) genes were selected for testing the hypothesis that
there would be differences in the expression level of these genes depending not only on the regions
(ischemic core and penumbra) but also the time post-PMCAO. We describe each expression below.
In general, almost all genes examined showed an induction and suppression as originally seen in the
Hori et al. (2012) study [13].

DOWN-REGULATED GENE CANDIDATES
2.1. Upregulated Genes
Gabra6 (γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor 6) gene was highly induced in penumbra under
saline injection at 6 h, and at 24 h in ischemic core the gene was more abundantly expressed after both
saline and PACAP38 treatment. However, in penumbra, Gabra6 was only induced after PACAP38
treatment. In contralateral hemisphere, its expression was seen at a lower level only at 24 h.
Il6 (interleukin 6), showed a strong expression at 24 h compared to 6 h, predominantly in ischemic
core after both saline and PACAP38 injection. A higher expression was also seen in healthy core after
saline treatment. Overall, a higher expression level was seen at 24 h post-ischemia.
S100a5 (S100 calcium binding protein A5), showed the strongest expression at 24 h in PACAP38
treated ischemic core and penumbra samples.
Il22 (interleukin 22) gene showed a greater overall induction at 24 h post-ischemia, in penumbra
after both saline and PACAP38 treatments. Moreover, it showed an increased expression in healthy
penumbra, especially under PACAP38 treatment compared to the saline treatment.
Il1b (interleukin-1β) gene similarly showed strongest expression at 24 h after PACAP38 injection in
both ischemic core and penumbra. A similar trend in expression was also seen at 6 h post-ischemia.
Ccl2 (chemokine C-C motif ligand 2), a chemotactic chemokine, in general showed a constitutive
expression over all samples, however, its mRNA abundance was strongest at 24 h after PACAP38
injection in both ischemic core and penumbra.
Il11 (interleukin 11) gene showed strongest expression at 24 h after PACAP38 treatment in both
ischemic core and penumbra compared to a similar constitutive expression in all other samples.
Cxcr2 (chemokine receptor type 2) gene showed an almost high constitutive expression at 6 h, but
was highly induced at 24 h after PACAP38 injection in both ischemic core and penumbra.
Igf1 (insulin-like growth factor 1), which is a eurotrophic and differentiation factor playing key role
in regulation of growth and development of central nervous system (CNS) revealed an almost high
constitutive expression at 6 and 24 h. Looking at Igf1 mRNA abundance, it can be seen that this gene
did not show a strong increase after PACAP treatment when compared to the other PACAP38
highly up-regulated genes presented in Figure 3. This might be due to the highly constitutive baseline
expression of Igf1 in the brain. In the above context, it should be noted that at 6 h time point, a slight
increase in abundance was seen in healthy controls, especially with PACAP38 treatment. Looking back

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2014, 15

17022

at gene expression data from previously performed brain hemisphere DNA microarray analysis [12,13];
Igf1 was constitutively expressed at high level, but at 6 h after PACAP38 treatment under ischemic
condition showed higher mRNA abundance compared to all other time points and treatments.
Fgf21 (fibroblast growth factor-21) is a new member of FGF (fibroblast growth factor)
super-family and an important endogenous regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism, but less
investigated in CNS. Its expression was strongly induced at 6 h under saline and PACAP38 treatment
in ischemic penumbra. Its mRNA abundance was also seen at 24 h after PACAP38 injection in both
ischemic core and penumbra. More interestingly, PACAP38 alone induced its expression in healthy
core and penumbra at 24 h.
2.2. Down-Expressed Genes
Tph2 (tryptophan hydroxylase 2) mRNA expression despite showing a higher baseline or constitutive
expression in all samples, showed a slight decrease in abundance after PACAP38 treatment at both
6 and 24 h, especially prominent in ischemic penumbra. This was also similar to observed down-regulation
of transcript abundance in the brain hemisphere in our previous studies [12,13]. The notable difference
was that compared to the previous study, here we could identify the decrease at both 6 and 24 h in the
penumbra, whereas in the Hori et al. (2012) study, the decrease was only seen at 6 h, albeit in the
hemisphere [13].
Slc6a4 (solute carrier family 6 member 4), encoding for the neurotransmitter transporter, serotonin,
gene expression was also constitutively high in all samples analyzed. However, the 6 h samples showed
a lower expression compared to 24 h, which was also observed in the Hori et al. (2012) study [13].
In particular, ischemic core and healthy core after PACAP38 treatment showed slightly decreased
mRNA expression.
Prlr (prolactin receptor) gene also showed suppressed expression in both healthy core and penumbra
(strongest decrease) after PACAP38 treatment at 6 h. However, 24 h after PACAP38 injection strongly
reduced the Prlr expression in ischemic core, and also to some degree in ischemic penumbra and healthy core.
Mmp8 (matrix metalloproteinase 8) gene did not show a clear reduction in transcript abundance,
except for a slight suppression seen at 24 h in healthy core with PACAP38 treatment. However, its
abundance was drastically lower in healthy regions compared to ischemic regions at both 6 and 24 h.
Tnf (tumor necrosis factor) gene also did not show a reduction in its transcript by PACAP38
treatment, although, its abundance was lower in the saline ischemic and healthy core regions, and in
the saline injected healthy penumbra.
Cxcl2 (chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 2) gene also did not show any reduction in transcript abundance
after PACAP38 treatment, and behaved in a similar fashion as the Tnf gene. It should be noted that in case
of the last three down-regulated genes (Mmp8, Tnf, and Cxcl2) compared to the saline treated core and
penumbra, where all three genes were strongly down-regulated, a strong increase in mRNA abundance
was seen in both ischemic core and penumbra at 24 h after PACAP38 treatment.

In our previous study we had observed cross-reaction of the CRMP2 antibody with a newly
appeared ~56 kDa protein band only in the PMCAO model [13]. In this study, using the same specific

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2014, 15

17023

brain regions examined for gene express changes, we found that there was a weak expression of
the ~56 kDa CRMP2 cross-reacting protein band in both the ischemic core and penumbra at 6 h,
but whose intensity was stronger under PACAP38 treatment (Figure 5A,B). At 24 h, PACAP38
injection dramatically increased its (~56 kDa) abundance in both the ischemic core (strongest increase)
and penumbra (weaker than that seen in the core region). No such cross-reaction with a band of similar
size was seen in the healthy core and penumbra at 6 and 24 h in either PACAP38 or saline treatment.
On the other hand, with respect to ~65 kDa and in particular ~63 kDa CRMP2 cross-reacting protein
bands, their abundance was high in healthy core and penumbra, where the bands were strongly
increased over the ischemic regions. However, the difference in these two CRMP2 cross-reacting
bands was the most prominent at 24 h, where on the one hand in the ischemic regions (lanes 10 and 12)
their intensity decreased but on the other hand in the healthy tissues (lanes 14 and 16) their abundance
increased with PACAP38 treatment. Although, weakly cross-reacting, the 70 kDa band appeared to
show a similar trend.

Abbreviations are the same as in Figure 2 legend. Proteins cross-reacting with the anti-CRMP2
protein antibody are visible as three constitutively present proteins (~70, ~65, and ~63 kDa

core but also in the penumbra. Total protein extraction, separation, Western blotting, and
image analyses procedures are detailed in Materials and Methods.

3. Discussion
The main objective addressed in this study was to identify PACAP38 influenced gene expression and
CRMP2 protein abundance, specifically in the ischemic core and the penumbra as compared to the first
two studies carried out using whole hemispheres [12,13]. Results on both gene expression and the
CRMP2 protein indicate that expression patterns for these molecules vary in different brain regions in
the PACAP38 treated ischemic hemisphere compared to healthy contralateral regions including saline
treatment (Figures 3–5). Thus, it would be important to apply such an experimental design to future
experiments involving brain ischemia studies. Gene expression analysis of these selected genes using
RT-PCR also provided new information into the localized expression in the ischemic core and penumbra.
We further discuss below some of the gene expression data obtained here focusing on observed
differences in expression between infract core and penumbra in relation to PACAP38 treatment.
Among the highly expressed genes with no defined function in neuroprotection two genes are worth
mentioning. First, Gabra6, whose link with neuroprotective mechanism remains undiscovered, was
strongly induced at 24 h not only in ischemic core under both saline and PACAP38 injections but also
in ischemic penumbra by only PACAP38 injection. These results suggest that penumbra might be
a site where PACAP38 is actively affecting Gabra6 transcription and that 24 h might be a critical time
period for asserting such action. Although, we could not a detect Gabra6 transcript in ischemic
penumbra under saline, at 24 h, its mRNA abundance was higher compared to the 6 h time point, even
in healthy core and penumbra. We cannot explain this result, but speculate that healthy tissues might
be a site for enhanced Gabra6 expression in response to the ischemia or as a bilateral effect. Second,
expression profile of the S100a5 gene revealed its dramatic expression at 24 h compared to 6 h, and
PACAP38 injection increased its expression at all treatment points, and most strongly in the ischemic
core and penumbra. This suggests that the effect of S100a5 is critical at the 24 h time period and site
of action is both ischemic core and penumbra. However, to date the role of S100a5 protein in
neuroprotection remains unknown.
Among the cytokines, which play an important role in mediating the inflammatory responses in the
ischemic brain, especially Il6, we found that not only Il6 expression but also the transcripts of Il22,
Il1b, and Il11 were differentially expressed in these brain regions. The Il6 gene expression was found
to be the most strongly induced in the ischemic core rather than penumbra at 24 h, and also in the
corresponding healthy core regions. As the 24 h time period presents its (Il6) strongest expression, this
result is in line with the fact that IL6 is an important inflammatory cytokine in ischemic brain [6].
However, at 24 h, PACAP38 was found to suppress its expression not only in the ischemic core, and
also in the healthy core and penumbra. This suggests that IL6, which is also believed to have a role in
neurodegeneration rather than neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia [30], is responsive to PACAP38
treatment, which might be one of the mechanisms by which PACAP38 could exert a neuroprotective
role in the brain during ischemia. In the case of IL22, its expression was strongly induced by PACAP38
treatment at 24 h in both the ischemic and healthy penumbras but that was especially high in the
ischemic penumbra. Although not much is known about the biological role of this cytokine in neuronal
cells, a recent study using naïve PC12 cells suggested a role for IL22 in neurological processes, a first
such report showing a neuroprotective function for this cytokine [31]. Another unrelated work on lung
infection by the influenza A virus showed that IL22 limits lung inflammation and subsequent bacterial

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2014, 15

17025

superinfections [32]. These two examples might explain the possible function of Il22 in the PACAP38
influenced neuroprotection in the ischemic brain. Looking at another cytokine, Il1b, which showed
a different expression pattern where PACAP38 induced its transcript in the ischemic core followed by
ischemic penumbra that was strongest at 24 h. Similarly, the Il11 expression was strongest at 24 h,
in the ischemic core followed by ischemic penumbra. Both Il1b and Il11 have been suggested to have
a negative role in brain injury or neuroprotection. For example, neutralizing IL-1b could reduce cerebral
edema and tissue loss causing an improvement in late cognitive outcome following traumatic brain
injury in mice [33]. In case of IL11, a cold pre-conditioning neuroprotection is dependent on TNF-α
(tumor necrosis factor α) but was enhanced by blocking IL11 [34]. The potential neuroprotective
function of these two cytokines in ischemic brain post-PACAP38 treatment remains to be investigated.
Looking at the chemokines, Ccl2 and Cxcr2, we found that unlike the cytokines, these are quite
highly expressed constitutively in all samples, especially at 6 h in the case of the Cxcr2 gene. Despite
this high expression, at 24 h, both these genes were strongly expressed in PACAP38 treated ischemic
core followed by penumbra. The CCL2 is an important mediator of neuroinflammation mediating
macrophage recruitment and migration during peripheral and central nervous system inflammation [35].
CXCR2, a major chemokine receptor, and its ligands, have been implicated in numerous brain
pathologies, and are involved in the recruitment of neutrophils and developmental positioning of
neural cells [36,37]. It is interesting to note that the both Ccl2 and Cxcr2 genes are being induced by
PACAP38 in the ischemic core and penumbra. How PACAP38-mediated neuroprotection is linked to
the induction of these pro- and anti-inflammatory chemokines and their receptors in the ischemic brain
remains to be decisively answered in future studies.
For the down-regulated genes, we discuss two unique genes that encode for serotonin and prolactin
receptor. Tph2, tryptophan hydroxylase 2, encodes a protein responsible for synthesizing the
neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT); 5-HT is synthesized in two steps, with TPH
(tryptophan hydroxylase) as the rate-limiting enzyme [38]. Results revealed that the baseline expression
of Tph2 in all samples was high, indicating that the transcript is abundantly present under the performed
experimental conditions. Nevertheless, PACAP38 treatment caused a slight decrease in expression of
Tph2 transcript abundance, especially in the ischemic penumbra at both 6 and 24 h. Although, the
decrease is small, it would be tempting to link this observed decrease in Tph2 gene expression to
changes in the level of serotonin; but, we have no data to support that claim as yet. There are reports in
the literature showing the decrease in 5-HT level following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia [39]. Moreover,
a recent report shows that NAS, N-acetylserotonin that is an immediate precursor of melatonin, has
neuroprotective function against ischemic injury [40]. We are working to establish a protocol for their
(metabolites) measurement by tandem mass spectrometry, and after which it may be possible to shed
more light on our observations at the level of mRNA expression. The second gene encoding for
a receptor of a hormone involved in human reproductive health, namely Prlr, prolactin receptor, showed
a strong decrease in its expression upon PACAP38 treatment in the ischemic core at 6 and 24 h. Our data
also showed increased expression of Prlr at both 6 and 24 h in the ischemic penumbra. This difference
might be explained by a previously published report showing for the first time that hypoxia ischemia
induces a robust activation of the prolactin axis in regions of the cerebral cortex affected by injury [41].
However as described in that report, and we quote the authors—“The lack of neuroprotective
properties in vivo and in vitro indicates that, unlike growth hormone, prolactin is not directly involved

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2014, 15

17026

in neuronal rescue in the injured brain. Its strong relation to glial reactions and its gliatrophic effects
suggest that the prolactin axis is primarily involved in a gliogenic response during recovery from
cerebral injury [41]”. Looking at the other down-regulated gene expressions analyzed in this study, we
could not find clear differences in the suppression by PACAP38 in analyzed core and penumbra tissue
samples, although these genes were selected based on our previous microarray data using whole ischemic
hemispheres [12–14]. For example, in the case of Mmp8, Tnf, and Cxcl2 down-regulated genes they
showed higher expression after PACAP38 treatment in core and penumbra at 24 h over saline controls.
Although, we cannot explain the discrepancy, it is possible that the observed gene expression results
are due to the use of specific sample tissues—Core and penumbra.
Finally, we examined the behavior of the CRMP2 (CRMP family member) [18–23] protein
abundance and expression in the core and penumbra after PACAP38 treatment. With respect to the
results obtained from CRMP2 Western blotting, there was a difference (quantitative) in the results
obtained using the brain hemispheres [13] and the brain regions (ischemic core and penumbra) as
shown in Figure 5. In our previous study, at 6 h after PACAP38 treatment, the most notable result was
of the identification of the ~56 kDa protein band, which at that time we believed to be strongly induced
in the ischemic hemisphere, whereas at 24 h, at best a very weak expression could be seen [13].
Additionally, in that paper, immunofluorescence staining suggested that the penumbra also has a
positive reaction to the CRMP2 antibody at 6 h, which is consistent with the findings of this study
showing the CRMP2 cross-reacting ~56 kDa band in penumbra regions at 6 h PACAP38 treatment
(Figure 5). In the present study, we have clarified that at 24 h post-ischemia the ~56 kDa CRMP2
cross-reacting protein band strongly correlated with PACAP38 treatment, especially in the core
regions. Initially, two questions arise from this observation- first, why is there a lower ~56 kDa band
and second, how is it produced? One previously published study, specifically on the CRMP2 protein, has
suggested that a 55 kDa band (which should be the same to our observed 56 kDa protein, Figure 5) is
a degradative product following both acute traumatic and neurotoxic injury; those authors also stated,
and we quote “Further studies are being conducted to elucidate the pathophysiological significance of
the cleavage of CRMP-2 in the nervous system” [25]. If this is also the case in our study and, which
the study of Zhang et al. (2007) suggests [25], then why is there enhanced CRMP2 degradation (as
evident by the ~56 kDa band) after PACAP38 treatment? Searching the literature, we found another
study demonstrating that a short isoform of the CRMP2 protein (around 58 kDa) derived from
post-translational C-terminal processing of the CRMP2B subtype has an important role in regulation of
neurite outgrowth in brain development [42]. That study suggests that our observed ~56 kDa might not
simply be a degradative product, but on the contrary might be specifically targeted for such processing
after PACAP38 treatment.
We further turned our attention to the mature (unphosphorylated) CRMP2 protein that has a
molecular weight of around 62 kDa, and the phosphorylated form whose molecular weight is around
66 kDa [21]. Although in the ischemic regions (lanes 1 to 4 and 9 to 12) the ~63 and ~66 kDa proteins
decrease after PACAP38 treatment, in the contralateral side (healthy regions) there is a strong increase
in abundance of especially the ~63 kDa band at 6 and 24 h. One possible reason may be that PACAP38
directly affects the CRMP2 expression in healthy contralateral hemisphere, which in turn regulates
several signaling pathways in promoting nervous system development, as proposed earlier [42]. Based
on all these results, there is no doubt to the observation that the CRMP2 protein expression and

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2014, 15

17027

abundance is influenced by PACAP38. However, the question remains as to how PACAP38
neuroprotective function can be linked to the established role of full-length CRMP2 in axonal
growth [20–22,43]. Our data showing a reduction in the ~63 and ~66 kDa bands implies that there
might be a stop to un-regulated axonal growth and other functions related to nervous system
development in the ischemic regions, which may be expected as the brain tissues, especially the core
that is dying. Simultaneously, an increase in the short isoform of ~56 kDa could be associated with a
specific function of causing neurite outgrowth inhibition and suppressed axonal growth in the ischemic
regions, as supported by the 2008 study of Rogemond and co-workers using neuroblastoma cells and
cultured cortical neurons [42]. Nevertheless, whether CRMP2 stability has a role in PACAP-mediated
neuroprotection or is just a reflection of the ischemic brain must be clarified.
Currently, we have initiated a new project to examine in detail the CRMP2 protein, by (I) using an
immunoprecipitation approach for identifying interacting proteins; (II) re-examining its phosphorylation
state using specific antibodies; and (III) examining the presence of splice variants using exon-PCR/exon
microarray. The idea is that all these additional experiments will shed new light on CRMP2 function
under PACAP38 treatment. It would also be worth investigating how other members of the CRMP
family differ in expression in these brain regions with or without PACAP.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Animals and Husbandry
Animal care and experimental procedures were used as approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of Showa University (School of Medicine), Tokyo, Japan. Thirty male mice (C57BL/6J)
of 9-weeks-old (25~35 g body weight) were purchased from Charles River (Kanagawa, Japan). Mice
were housed at the Animal Institution in Showa University in acrylic cages (8 mice/cage) maintained
at 23 °C with a standard 12 h light/dark cycle, optimum humidity, and temperature control. Animals
were given access to tap water and laboratory chow ad libitum.
4.2. Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion, PACAP38 and Saline Treatments
The experimental design is presented in Figure 1. The PMCAO model mice were generated as
described previously [12,13]. Mice were first anesthetized with 4% sevoflurane (induction) and 2%
sevoflurane (maintenance) in a 30% O2 and 70% N2O gas mixture via a face mask, followed by
an incision in the cervical skin, opening of salivary gland, resulting in visualization of the right
common carotid artery. A midline cervical incision was made to expose the external carotid artery, and
using intraluminal filament technique the PMCAO model was generated. PACAP38 (1 µL containing
1 pmol) or 1 µL of saline (0.9% NaCl, as control) was injected intracerebroventrically, immediately
after PMCAO. PACAP38 (Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka, Japan; supplier temperature was −20 °C) was
dissolved at 10−5 M concentration by saline, and stored at −80 °C. PACAP test solution (for injection)
was diluted ×10 times with 0.9% NaCl just before use. After injections, the animals were returned to
their cages. A total of four groups were prepared as mentioned in Table 2.
In the present study, we used three mice each in PMCAO groups for PACAP38 and saline injections,
respectively, that exhibited neurological grades G1 and G2 [6,12,13] for the subsequent downstream

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2014, 15

17028

analysis. The neurological grades were based on a previously published paper in our group by Ohtaki
and co-workers [6]. Briefly, evaluation of the neurological deficits was based on five grades 0 to 4:
(I) 0 represents—normal, no observable neurological deficit; (II) 1 represents—mild, failure to extend
the contralateral forepaw upon lifting the animal by the tail; (III) 2 represents—moderate, circling to
the contralateral side; (IV) 3 represents—severe, leaning to the contralateral side when at rest; and (V)
4 represents—heavy, no spontaneous motor activity [6]. Some of the mice were examined for ischemia
by TTC staining of brain sections (2 mm slices) at 37 °C for 10 min [6,12].
4.3. Dissection of Brain, Sampling and Storage
Six or 24 h post-injection of PACAP38 or saline, the mice were removed from their cages,
decapitated, and their brains carefully removed on ice. The right (ipsilateral; ischemic) and left
(contralateral) hemispheres were dissected, and from each hemisphere the ischemic core and penumbra
regions and corresponding healthy core and penumbra were carefully removed with a sterile scalpel,
and placed in 2 mL Eppendorf tubes. The samples were then quickly immersed in liquid nitrogen and
stored in −80 °C prior to further analysis (Figure 1).
Table 2. The number of mice used for this experiment. A total of 23 mice were prepared,
and 3 each were selected randomly based on neurological grade (NG). Mice with score 0
and 3 were not selected for sampling the brains.

4.4. Total RNA Extraction, Synthesis of cDNA and Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction
Stored brain regions were ground to a very fine powder with liquid nitrogen, and the total RNA
was extracted whose quantity and quality was determined and confirmed exactly as described
previously [12,13]. Three samples were pooled for each condition as the amount of each region was
very small, and the resulting powder was used for total RNA extraction. For validation of total RNA
quality and subsequently synthesized cDNA, RT-PCR was carried out using two commonly used
house-keeping genes GAPDH and β-actin as positive controls [12,13]. The gene-specific primers were
designed (Table 1). The cDNA synthesis and RT-PCR analysis protocol used is as follows: Total RNA
samples were first DNase-treated with RNase-free DNase (Stratagene, Agilent Technologies,
La Jolla, CA, USA). First-strand cDNA was then synthesized in a 20 μL reaction mixture with an
AffinityScript QPCR cDNA Synthesis kit (Stratagene, Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA, USA)
according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer, using 1 μg total RNA. The reaction conditions
were: 25 °C for 5 min, 42 °C for 5 min, 55 °C for 40 min and 95 °C for 5 min. The synthesized cDNA
was made up to a volume of 50 μL with sterile water supplied in the kit. The reaction mixture
contained 0.6 μL of the first-strand cDNA, 7 pmols of each primer set and 6.0 μL of the Emerald
Amp PCR Master Mix (2× premix) (TaKaRa Shuzo, Shiga, Japan) in a total volume of 12 μL.
Thermal-cycling (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan) parameters were as follows: after an initial
denaturation at 97 °C for 5 min, samples were subjected to a cycling regime of 20 to 40 cycles at 95 °C
for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. At the end of the final cycle, an additional extension step
was carried out for 10 min at 72 °C. After completion of the PCR the total reaction mixture was spun
down and mixed (3 μL), before being loaded into the wells of a 1.2/1.8% agarose (Agarose (fine
powder) Cat no. 02468-95, Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) gel. Electrophoresis was then performed
for ~22 min at 100 Volts in 1× TAE (tris-acetate) buffer using a Mupid-ex electrophoresis system
(ADVANCE, Tokyo, Japan). The gels were stained (8 μL of 10 mg/mL ethidium bromide in 200 mL
1× TAE buffer) for ~7 min and the stained bands were visualized with the ChemiDoc XRS+ imaging
system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Each gene expression analysis was performed at least twice
as independent PCR reactions and electrophoresis on gel, and one of the images was presented as a
representative data for each gene in the respective figures for up-/down-regulated expressions.

4.5. Extraction of Total Soluble Protein
Total protein was extracted from sample powders (around 50 mg) of each dissected brain region
using a previously used lysis buffer containing thiourea and Tris (LB-TT) for extraction of brain
proteins [13,16,17]. The composition of slightly modified LB-TT was as follows: 7 M (w/v) urea, 42 g;
2 M (w/v) thiourea, 15.2 g; 4% (w/v) CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1propanesulfonate), 4.0 g; 18 mM (w/v) Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 1.8 mL; 14 mM (w/v) trizma base,
169.5 mg; 0.2% (v/v) triton X-100, 0.2 mL; 50 mM (w/v) DTT (dithiothreitol), 771.5 mg;
1% (v/v) pH 3–10 ampholyte, 1 mL; and two EDTA-free proteinase inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics GmbH,
Mannheim, Germany) tablets in a total volume of 100 mL at room temperature (RT). To extract protein,
1 mL of LB-TT was quickly added to the 2 mL microfuge tube containing the sample powder
(immediately after removal from the −80 °C deep freezer) and immediately mixed by vortexing (at full
speed using a Lab mixer, Iwaki, Tokyo, Japan) for 1 min at RT. The protein solution in LB-TT was
incubated at RT for 30 min with mixing by vortexing (for 30 s) and sonication (for 30 s in a water-bath
type sonicator) for a total of 5 times. The insoluble protein pellet and/or debris were pelleted by
centrifugation at 18,500× g for 15 min at 20 °C in a high-speed refrigerated micro centrifuge (MX-150,
TOMY, Tokyo, Japan). The clear supernatant (around 900 µL) was transferred to a new 1.5 mL
microfuge tube, and stored at –80 °C as the total soluble protein. Protein concentration was determined
with a Coomassie Plus™ Protein Assay kit (PIERCE, Rockford, IL, USA) using bovine serum
albumin (BSA) as a standard and a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific,
Wilmington, DE, USA).
4.6. Western Blot Analysis
The separated proteins after SDS-PAGE (mini-gel) were transferred onto a polyvinyldifluoride
(PVDF) (Trans-Blot Turbo Midi PVDF, 0.2 µM, Transfer Packs kit; Cat. no. 170-4157, Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA). The Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used
for the electrotransfer (Standard SD protocol; 25 V, 1.0 A, 30 min). Following the transfer of proteins
on the PVDF membrane (and also confirmed by visualizing all the 10 colored molecular mass
standards), it was incubated in 25 mL of 5% blocking solution (Block-Ace powder, Cat. no. UK-B80,
DS Pharma, Osaka, Japan; Yukizirushi, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan) for 1 h under constant slow
shaking at RT. Blocking solution was prepared by dissolving 4 g powder in 80 mL 1× TTBS
(tris-tween-buffer-saline) (10× TTBS: NaCl, 80 g; 1 M Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mL; Tween-20, 5 mL).
Western blotting and detection was carried out using the Immun-Star WesternC Chemiluminescent kit
(Cat. no. 170-5070, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Blocking
solution was decanted and the membrane was washed once in 1× TTBS (5 min), followed by incubation
in 25 mL of primary antibody solution (PAS; 1 µL rabbit anti-CRMP2 protein antibody (Cat. no.
ab62661; 100 µg, 2 mg/mL; Abcam, Cambridge, UK, www.abcam.co.jp)) for 1 h, as above. The
membrane was then washed with 25 mL of 1× TTBS for five times. The last TTBS wash was decanted
and the membrane was incubated in 25 mL of secondary antibody solution (SAS; 0.5 µL of Amersham,
ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) anti-rabbit IgG, HRP (horseradish peroxidase) linked
species-specific whole antibody (from Donkey); Cat. no. NA 934; GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont,

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2014, 15

17031

Buckinghamshire, UK) for 1 h with slow shaking at RT. The 1× TTBS wash step was repeated
five times. For blot development, the luminol/enhancer and peroxide buffer solutions were mixed in a
1:1 ratio (1 mL:1 mL; one membrane volume) and spread over the membrane and incubated at RT for
5 min. Excess solution was drained by touching one end of the membrane on a KimWipe paper towel,
and the signal (cross-reacting protein bands) was visualized using the ChemiDoc XRS+ imaging
system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The Western blot analysis was repeated at least three times,
and representative data from one blot are shown.
5. Conclusions
Having described the above, it should be noted that without using or dissecting out the core and
penumbra regions in the ischemic brain, the present results on gene and protein expression would not
have been realized. Thus, the importance of studying, as far as possible, different regions of the brain
in greater detail at the level of the gene and protein is necessary. Based on both our previous [12–14]
and the current data we are a step closer to understanding the gene expression changes in specific
regions of the brain, and which might serve as a base for exploring their translation in clinical studies in
context of observed PACAP-mediated neuroprotection in an animal model. In the meantime such studies
can be considered and performed, the next step in this research is whole genome (DNA microarray)
analysis of the ischemic core and penumbra tissue in conjunction with additional bioinformatics
analysis using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, Ingenuity® Systems, 1700 Seaport Blvd, 3rd Floor
Redwood City, CA 94063, USA) tool, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments utilizing the
anti-CRMP2 antibodies. These experiments have been initiated following our present results discussed
above, and it is our belief that identifying specific molecular pathways genome-wide along with
clarifying role of the ~56 kDa CRMP2 protein will help in understanding how PACAP38 might
function as a neuroprotective and/or potentially therapeutic agent in counteracting ischemia.
