Background and purpose: The Toll-like receptor 4(TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa B NF-κB inﬂammatory pathway
contributes to secondary inﬂammation in many diseases including stroke. Moreover, the neuroprotective effect
of splenectomy in stroke is supported by a vast body of experimental evidence. Nevertheless, the underlying
mechanism(s) by which splenectomy enhance neuroprotection in stroke is still poorly understood. Our study
aimed to investigate whether post-ischemic splenectomy modulate the TLR4/NF-κB inﬂammatory pathway in
stroke.
Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the levels of TLR4 and NF-κB expression in brain areas
(parietal lobe, hippocampus and striatum) of rats that underwent: MCAO-splenectomy surgery (MS ); MCAO
surgery without splenectomy (MCAO control or MC); Sham MCAO and splenectomy surgery (sham control
group or SC group respectively. Apoptosis in these areas was assessed by TUNEL detection technique.
Results: The levels of TLR4 and NF-κB expression were signiﬁcantly reduced in splenectomized rats relative to the
MS group (P b 0.01). Additionally, the number of apoptotic cells in the ischemic hemisphere were signiﬁcantly
higher in both MCAO groups compared to the Sham group (P b 0.05), between day 1 and day 7. An exception
was observed in the striatum where the difference in apoptotic rate between the MS and sham group was not
statistically signiﬁcant at the same time points. Moreover, the variation apoptotic rate in different cerebral
zone correlated to variation in TLR4 and NF-κB expression.
Conclusion: In summary, our study provides further evidence of neuroprotective effect of splenectomy in ischemic stroke. Our results suggest that such an effect might be due to the inhibition of theTLR4/NF-κB inﬂammatory
pathway.

1. Introduction
The pathophysiologic changes in ischemic stroke involve both components of the immune and central nervous systems (Iadecola and
Anrather, 2011). Understanding the complex interplay between these
two complex systems at both the cellular and molecular levels is a critical step toward a better understanding of stroke pathophysiology and
improving or renovating therapeutic strategies in stroke management.
Soon after brain ischemia, microglia, astrocytes and neurons are activated (Inose et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2011). This activation has been reported
to correlate at the molecular level with the activation of their membrane
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and downstream up-regulation of various
transcription factors such as the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) (Fan
et al., 2009; Zwagerman et al., 2010).

The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is a family of transcription factors
made of ﬁve sub units (p50, RelA⁄p65, c-Rel, RelB and p52) that form
homo or hetero-dimmers in various combinations. NF-κB is a key regulator of hundreds of genes involved in cell survival and inﬂammation
(Harari and Liao, 2016; Shih et al., 2015). Following cerebral ischemia,
NF-κB is rapidly up-regulated in neurons and glial cells (Shih et al.,
2015; Hanke and Kielian, 2011; Lenihan and Taylor, 2013). Activation
of TLR4 leads to the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B
(NF-κB), which is a key regulator involved in the induction of inﬂammatory mediators. NF-κB translocates into the nucleus and regulates the
transcription of genes related to inﬂammatory responses, such as
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and
interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Shih et al., 2015).
Previous studies have established the neuroprotective effect of splenectomy in MCAO rodent model, as reviewed by Pennypacker and
Offner (2015)). However the precise mechanisms leading to this neuroprotection are still poorly understood. Our study sets out to investigate a
possible mechanism responsible of this neuroprotective effect. We
hypothesized that the neuroprotective role of splenectomy in ischemic
may be linked to the TLR4-NF-κB-dependent inﬂammatory pathway.
To validate our hypothesis, we assessed levels of TLR4 and NF-κB

expression, as well as cellular apoptosis in the brain, following MCAO in
splenectomized rats.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Adult male Sprague–Dawley (SD, RGDID: 70508) rats, speciﬁc
pathogens(SPS free, weighing between (230–250 g), provided by
Shanghai West Poole Will Kai Experimental Animal Co. Ltd. Quality
Certiﬁcate No. 2008001626151,were raised and fed in Southeast
University's SPS barrier system at (21 ± 2) °C room temperature. All
procedures involving animals complied with the NIH Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of southeast university. Under
strict experimental protocols, the rats were assigned randomly into
three groups: sham control (n = 6) or SC group: rats underwent a
sham middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery followed by a
sham splenectomy; MCAO-control (n = 6) or MC group: rats
underwent a MCAO surgery followed by a sham splenectomy; MCAOsplenectomy (n = 6) or MS group: rats underwent a MCAO surgery
followed by a splenectomy.

anesthetized with chlorine halothane inhalation (3.5% for induction
and 1.5% for maintenance) and kept warm with a circulating water
pad that covered the whole coil. Magnetic T2-weighted images were
obtained by a RARE sequence with a respiratory-gating technology.
The MRI parameters were as follows: TR/TE = 5341.6 ms/12 ms, Slice
thickness = 0.5 mm, layer distance = 0.5 mm, ﬂip angle = 180°, matrix
256 × 256, ﬁeld of vision: 3 cm × 3 cm. The scans were performed three
times on average. The rats' respiration and heart rate were continually
monitored during scanning.
After image acquisition, analysis was made using Image J Software
Analysis System to compute each scanned layer's infarct volume and
size. With the formula: infarct volume = added value of infarct size of
each layer × slice thickness layer distance. Behavior assessment was
conducted using Longa's method (Longa et al., 1989). Brieﬂy, the neurologic ﬁndings were scored on a ﬁve-point scale: a score of 0 indicated no
neurologic deﬁcit, a score of 1 (failure to extend left forepaw fully) a
mild focal neurologic deﬁcit, a score of 2 (circling to the left) a moderate
focal neurologic deﬁcit, and a score of 3 (falling to the left) a severe focal
deﬁcit; rats with a score of 4 did not walk spontaneously and had a
depressed level of consciousness.
Rats showing signs of cerebral hemorrhage or showing no ischemic
infarct on the MRI scanning result, as well as those scoring 0 on the
behavior scale were immediately removed from the experiment.

2.2. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model
2.5. Hematoxylin–eosin(HE) staining
For both MCAO groups (MCAO-control group (n = 6), MCAOsplenectomy group (n = 6)), a focal cerebral ischemia was performed
with polylysine coated nylon ﬁlament (head diameter 0.32 ±
0.02 mm; body diameter0.24 mm (Beijing Sunbio Biological Technology
Co., Ltd.) occluding the middle cerebral artery (MCA) for 60 min., as previously described by Koizumi et al. (1986) and Longa et al. (1989) with
modiﬁcation. Brieﬂy, the mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate
(0.3 ml/100 g) administered via the abdomen and then placed under a
stereo-microscope in a supine position. A warming pad was used to
keep the body temperature at 37 °C during the surgery. A midline skin
incision was made at the neck region followed by careful exposure of
the external, internal, and common carotid arteries (ECA, ICA, and
CCA, respectively). One polylysine coated nylon ﬁlament (head diameter 0.32 ± 0.02 mm; body diameter 0.24 mm Beijing Sunbio Biological
Technology Co. Ltd.) was gently advanced into the internal carotid
artery (ICA) to block the blood ﬂow of the middle cerebral artery for
90 min. After that, the suture was moved out for reperfusion of the ischemic brain. The same procedure was performed on the SC group
(n = 6) except, no ﬁlament was inserted into the carotid artery to
induce brain ischemia. Exclusion criteria were: a lack of neurological
deﬁcit 60 min after surgery using Longa's score (Longa et al., 1989),
the entire occlusion surgery time exceeding 20 min, nylon ﬁlament insertion depth lesser than 18 mm, signs of hemorrhage, anesthesia or
surgery failure.

The rats were anesthetize with 10% chloral hydrate (0.3 ml/100 g)
administered via abdomen then ﬁxed on a console in a supine position.
A rapid vertical incision was made from the left part of the abdomen to
the thoracic area, enabling the heart and the spleen (for SC and MC
groups) to be uncovered (exposed). A perfusion needle was then
inserted from the left ventricle to the aorta ﬁxed with a hemostatic forceps ﬁxation needle. A rapid incision made on the right atrium followed
by perfusion with saline solution from the left ventricle was performed
to effuse body ﬂuids. The body ﬂuid effusion was considered complete
after the discharge from the right atrium turned clear and/or paling of
the spleen. After the body ﬂuids' removal, the animals were decapitated,
their brain removed then ﬁxed using 4% paraformaldehyde (4–6 h for
ﬁxation). Parafﬁned slices (5 mm) of sacriﬁced rats brains were obtained after washing and drying of the brain tissues with 50%, 70%, 85% and
95% of absolute ethanol, respectively (2 h for each stage). To enhance
the clarity of brain tissues, the samples were placed in a 50% of ethanol
+.50% of di-methylbenzene solution for 2 h then placed in a solution of
di-methylbenzene I and II for 2 h, respectively. They were then wrapped
with an equimolar volume of melted parafﬁn and ﬁxed for 3 h ready for
slicing. The slicing was done using a slicing machine adjusted to obtain
slices of 5 mm thick of each slice. Staining of each slice was done using
hematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining.
2.6. Immunohistochemistry

2.3. Splenectomy
After successful MCAO surgery followed by reperfusion, splenectomy was immediately performed as described by Zhang et al. (2013)
with modiﬁcation. Brieﬂy, after disinfection of the left side of the abdomen, a vertical incision of about 3 cm was made at the level of the left
costal margin; the spleen then was retracted through the incision and
stored at −80 °C. The sham control and MCAO-control groups received
the same treatment except for the removal of the spleen.
2.4. Brain MRI scanning and behavior assessment
Before collecting the brain samples, an MRI scanning and behavior
assessment were performed on day 1, day 3 and day 7 after surgery,
respectively. All MRIs were performed on a high-ﬁeld micro-MR scanner (7.0T, Bruker, and PharmaScan) with a body coil. Rats were

Slices from the selected brain areas (parietal cortex, hippocampus,
striatum) were dried at 60 °C for 30 min then placed in dimethylbenzene I and II (15 × 15 min) solution before being rinsed
with 100%, 95%、85%, 75% of ethanol, respectively (3 × 3 × 3 × 3 min)
and ﬁnally with distilled water for 3 min. Next, for antibody preparation
used in this experiment including: Rabbit anti NF-κBp65 monoclonal
antibody (AB-32536, Abcam company product); Rabbit anti TLR4mAb
(AB-22048, Abcam company product); goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary
antibody (AB-6721, Abcam company product), all antibodies were
ﬁrst renatured using 0.01 M of citrate solution (buffer) followed by
high pressure repair (30 min) then left to cool in room temperature
(37%) and rinsed tree times with PBS. Endogenous peroxidase activity
was extinguished by incubating the slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) for 15 min then rinsed tree times with PBS. To avoid or block
non-speciﬁc binding of the antibodies, slides were incubated with

not signiﬁcant in the parietal cortex (B1, C1) (P N 0.05).

enhanced 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) visualization, slices were
washed in PBS (3 × 5 min) following secondary antibody solution and
incubated in an avidin/biotin/horseradish peroxidase complex
(Vectastain Elite ABC kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h
at room temperature. The sections were washed in PBS, and hematoxylin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) was used for color development and 0.1 hydrochloric acid alcohol for differentiation. Finally, slides were dried with
75%, 85%, 95%, and 100% ethanol respectively (3 × 3 × 3 × 3 min) then
treated with xylene for contrast improvement.
2.7. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP Nick End
Labeling (TUNEL) for apoptosis detection
The samples collected from the parietal cortex, hippocampus and
striatum of each group ischemic hemisphere were processed as
described above. Then, apoptotic cells were detected in those areas by
TUNEL. The number of apoptotic cells was determined by ﬂuorescence
with the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer instructions. On
the slices, neurons with dark brown stained nucleus were considered
TUNEL-positive. Their total number was obtained in a blind fashion by
light microscopy (400×) (Eclipse E600, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Finally,
an average for each group was calculated.
2.8. Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS13.0 software.
Wilcoxon signed rank test methods were used to compare infarct
volume. Immunohistochemical analysis and apoptotic rates values are
expressed by mean and standard deviation (Ⱦ ± S). ANOVA was used
for comparisons between groups. Least Signiﬁcant Difference (LSD)

test was used for comparisons within groups. Behavioral scores between two groups at different point of time were compared using a t
test. P values of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically
signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Splenectomy reduces infarct volume and improve neurologic deﬁcit
after MCAO
To evaluate the impact of splenectomy on infarct volume and neurologic deﬁcit following MCAO, MRI scanning and behavioral scores were
assessed as described earlier. As shown in Fig. 1), between day 1 and day
7, the MS group showed a reduced infarct size relative to the MC group
(P = 0.156 P = 0.031). Additionally, there was a decrease trend in behavioral scores for both MS and MC groups although this trend was
more pronounced in the MS relative to the MC group (Fig. 1). However,
statistical analysis showed no signiﬁcant difference between both group
behavioral scores at different time points (P = 0.137).
3.2. Splenectomy protects the brain from neurodegeneration after MCAO
To observe the effect of splenectomy on brain histopathology following ischemia, hippocampal tissues (the most vulnerable to cerebral
ischemia) were stained and assessed for morphological change under
microscopy. Rats in the SC group showed a normal appearance in the
neural architecture as shown in (Fig. 2, A1). In the MCAO groups (MC
and MS), the ischemic core was distinguishable from normal tissues
by a massive loss of focal tissues and cells, loose connectivity between
cells, deeply dyed nucleus and irregular cellular architecture as shown
in Fig. 2, A2.The ischemic penumbra, located between the core and

Moreover, NF-κBp65 positive cells were signiﬁcantly reduced in the MS group compared to the MC group (P b 0.01). However, this reduction was not signiﬁcant in the parietal cortex
(B1, C1) (P N 0.05).

normal tissues, showed no massive loss in tissues but still presented
some morphological anomalies including: swelling, ambiguous or invisible nuclei, nuclear vacuolization, and cytoplasmic cavities (Fig. 2, A2).
On day 7 after reperfusion, the ischemic penumbra showed evidence
of tissue atrophy, karyopyknosis, partial dissolvement of cell nuclei,
increased interstitial space coupled with microglial proliferation and
inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration. Interestingly, these morphological changes were more visible on MC rats compared to MS rats, as shown in Fig. 2,
B1, B2, C1, C2.
3.3. Splenectomy decreases TLR4 and NF-κBp65 expression in the brain
following MCAO
Anti-TLR4, anti-NF-κBp65 antibodies were respectively used to
quantify the expression of TLR4 and NF-κBp65. These antibodies were
used to stain selected areas of the ischemic cerebral hemisphere

(parietal cortex, hippocampus, striatum) for all groups (MC, MS and
SC
),
between day1 and day 7. Thereafter, the staining results were assessed
and analyzed by two independent viewers under a high resolution
microscope (200×, 400×).
Between day 1 and day 7, in the selected brain areas of the SC group,
the immunohistochemical results indicated no signiﬁcant change for
TLR4 and NF-κBp65 positive stained cells (P N 0.05). However, in both
MC and MS groups,TLR4 and NF-κBp65 positive cells were signiﬁcantly
increased compared to the SC group (P b 0.01) (Figs. 3, 4,Table 1). Meanwhile, in the MS group, TLR4 and NF-κBp65 positive cells were signiﬁcantly reduced compared to the MC group (P b 0.01); however, this
reduction was not signiﬁcant in the parietal cortex (P N 0.05). Furthermore, while, in both MC and MS groups, TLR4 and NF-κBp65 positive
cells were signiﬁcantly increased between day1 and day 7 in the striatum (P = 0.00); no such increase was observed for the MS group in

the hippocampus (p N 0.05) (Tables 1,2) (Fig. 5). These results
suggested that the levels of TLR4 and NF-κBp65 expression increased
in the brain after cerebral ischemia, and that splenectomy could inhibit
their expression.
3.4. Splenectomy down-regulates cellular apoptosis following MCAO
Cellular apoptosis in different areas of the ischemic brain was
assessed by TUNEL assay, and the results were manually quantiﬁed
under a high resolution microscope (400 ×). In the SC group no signiﬁcant number of TUNEL positive was detected (P N 0.05) (Fig. 7,
A1-A3).In contrast, in both MC and MS groups, a greater number of
TUNEL positive cells were detected in all selected brain areas
(Fig. 7, B1-B3, C1-C3). Furthermore, the number of these TUNEL positive cells was greater in the striatum compared to the parietal cortex
and the hippocampus (P b 0.05) (Table 3). Additionally, statistical
analysis also conﬁrmed a greater number of apoptotic cells in both
MS and MC groups compared to the sham in all the brain areas
(P b 0.01). Likewise, the number of apoptotic cells in the striatum

and hippocampus of the MC group was signiﬁcantly greater than
the MS group (P b 0.01). However, in the parietal lobe, no signiﬁcant
difference in apoptotic rate was revealed between the two groups
(P N 0.05) (Table 3). Interestingly, between day 1 and day 7, the number of apoptotic cells in hippocampal tissues of the MS group compared to the sham group showed no signiﬁcant difference
(P N 0.05), Moreover, the comparison of the number of apoptotic
cells between the selected areas for the MS group as well as the MC
group showed no signiﬁcant difference. (P N 0.05) (Table 3, Fig. 6).
Taken together, these results suggested that splenectomy downregulated cellular apoptosis in the brain following MCAO.
4. Discussion
Neurons' high energy consumption makes them particularly vulnerable to ischemic and hypoxic attacks. In vitro, neurons can barely survive up to 10 min in an oxygen deprived environment (Levy et al.,
1975). In the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, where
one of the main branch supplying the brain (middle cerebral artery

TLR4/NF-κBp65 increase in the ischemic brain after MCAO and were signiﬁcantly reduced in selected brain areas after splenectomy. Note:** indicates signiﬁcant difference between groups
(P b 0.01).

MCA) is ligated via microﬁlament insertion or by other means, neuronal
death begins to occur 6 to 7 min after ﬁlament insertion. This model,
which mimics ischemic stroke, is the most used in experimental stroke
(Sørensen et al., 1998; Fluri et al., 2015). In the acute phase of stroke,
loss in blood ﬂow deprives neurons of an adequate level of oxygen to
maintain a normal homeostatic physiology. Consequently, this depletion of energy supply triggers a cascade of pathophysiologic events
such as peri-infarct depolarization, oxidative/nitrosative stress, neuronal hyper-polarization (the result of calcium overload), resulting in
neuronal death. Afterward, resident astrocytes and microglia sensing
the change in the focal brain homeostasis get activated via binding
with damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and high mobility
group box-1 (HMGB-1) released by dying neurons (Shichita et al.,
2012). The activation of resident microglia and astrocytes promotes
local inﬂammation by releasing pro-inﬂammatory agents (cytokines,
chemokines and adhesion molecules) in the blood stream, and these
pro-inﬂammatory agents in turn help in the activation and recruitment
of other immune cells from the periphery, mainly from the spleen
(Pennypacker and Offner, 2015; Offner et al., 2006).

The spleen, the largest peripheral immune organ, serves as a reservoir for immune cells and plays an important role in immune surveillance, as well as the clearance from the blood stream of endogenous
and exogenous harmful substances (Offner et al., 2006). The spleen is
a major contributor in the delayed immune response after stroke, as it
is involved in post-ischemic secondary inﬂammatory response, as well
as stroke-induced immunodepression (Pennypacker and Offner, 2015;
Ajmo et al., 2008; Jin et al., 2016). Previous studies have demonstrated
that removal of the spleen prior to MCAO surgery is neuroprotective
(Zhang et al., 2013; Seifert et al., 2012 Jun, 2014; Dotson et al., 2015;
Wang et al., 2015). Furthermore, ischemic stroke is followed by splenic
atrophy in both animals and humans, which is thought to be caused by
excessive release of immune cells in the blood stream that migrate to
the ischemic brain, and contribute to secondary inﬂammation
(Pennypacker and Offner, 2015). Our results conﬁrm the neuroprotective role of the spleen after MCAO, as splenectomized rats showed less
evidence of neurodegeneration relative to the control group. However,
our study differs from the previous studies, as splenectomy was performed after reperfusion. In fact, our study is more consistent with the
report by Ostrowski et al. (2012)) that splenic radiation following
MCAO surgery was neuroprotective in mice. Together, these studies
suggest that the elimination of splenocytes by any means, prior or
after MCAO, results in protection from ischemic tissue injuries.
It is well known that the spleen participates to post-ischemic brain
damage mainly by promoting and maintaining post-stroke inﬂammatory response. A study by Zhang et al. (2013) reported that splenectomy
reduced infarct volume and neurodegeneration by decreasing T cells,
neutrophils, macrophages and proinﬂammatory cytokines, while
increasing anti-inﬂammatory cytokines in brain tissues in rats after
MCAO. Furthermore Seifert et al. (2014) demonstrated that splenectomy resulted in reduced inﬁltrating leukocytes and activated microglia
as well as a decrease of IFNγ in the brain after MCAO in mice. Similar results were reported by Ostrowski et al. using splenic radiation in rats

after MCAO (Ostrowski et al., 2012). Additionally, a recent study by
Seifert et al. (2012) reported that splenectomy inhibits the IFNγdependent inﬂammatory pathway, reﬂected by the reduction of the
chemokine interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) expression, and a resultant decrease in infarct volume. More recently, two intriguing studies
have reported a sexual difference in the spleen-induce immune response after stroke. It was reported in these studies that splenectomy
was neuroprotective in male but not in female mice after MCAO
(Dotson et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015), suggesting a neuroendocrine involvement in the spleen-induced neuroinﬂammation and neurodegeneration. In our study, the inﬂammatory response in the brain was
evaluated by assessing the levels of TLR4 and NF-κB in the brain after
MCAO. Neurodegeneration was assessed by histological imaging and
evaluating cellular apoptosis in various brain areas.
The TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway is known to be involved in many
CNS inﬂammatory pathologies and diseases such as atherosclerosis and
multiple sclerosis (Shih et al., 2015). In stroke, this pathway is activated
through the opening of the TLR4 non-pathogenic gate which induces an
inﬂammatory cascade that results in brain tissue damage (Kilic et al.,
2008). The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) transcriptional activation
pathway is considered to be a major regulator of inﬂammation and apoptosis in ischemic stroke (Harari and Liao, 2010). A study by Kilic et al.
(2008) observed that mouse defective in TLR4 genes showed a reduction in Caspase3 expression and cell apoptosis, deducing that the TLR4
pathway participates in post-stroke apoptotic cell death. This suggests
that the regulation of this pathway could be used to modulate poststroke inﬂammatory response and neurodegeneration, therefore
protecting further damage in the brain. Our results are consistent
with these ﬁndings, as the levels of TLR4 and NF-κB expression
were signiﬁcantly reduced in splenectomized mice compared to
the control. Furthermore, our study revealed a difference in the expression of these proteins in different brain areas following MCAO.
For instance, the levels of expression of both proteins in the striatum
were greater than in the hippocampus and the parietal cortex. The
variation in TLR4 and NF-κB in these areas was probably due to
their anatomical topology, and different degrees of reperfusion following MCAO. In fact, hippocampal tissues, due to the lack of collateral vessels, are often the most vulnerable to ischemic injury, and
neurons in the hippocampus often undergo rapid necrosis instead
of apoptosis following MCAO (Barth and Mody, 2011). Indeed, the
higher levels of expression of TLR4 and NF-κB in the striatum relative
to the hippocampus in both splenectomized and control mice in our
results were reﬂective of that fact. Moreover, our results showed that
splenectomy reduced apoptosis in the ischemic brain, as the number
of apoptotic cells was signiﬁcantly lower in the MS group relative to
the MC group. Additionally, the number of apoptotic cell positively
correlated with the levels of TLR4 and NF-κB in selected brain

areas. Our results are consistent with the ﬁndings by a study by
Chu et al. that immediate splenectomy, following a traumatic brain
injury (TBI), down-regulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK)–NF-κB pathway and reduces apoptosis in the brain (Chu
et al., 2013).
In summary, the spleen up-regulates the TLR4–NF-κB dependent inﬂammatory pathway and increases apoptosis in the brain after MCAO.
Splenectomy reduces brain inﬂammation and cellular apoptosis following MCAO. We therefore propose, that splenectomy protects the brain
from neurodegeneration through down-regulation of the TLR4–NF-κB
dependent inﬂammatory pathway in ischemic stroke. Targeting this
pro-inﬂammatory pathway following stroke could be an important
asset for future stroke therapeutic.
