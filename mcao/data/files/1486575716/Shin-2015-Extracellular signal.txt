Abstract Less disruption of the blood–brain barrier
(BBB) after severe ischemic stroke is one of the beneficial
outcomes of ischemic preconditioning (IP). However, the
effect of IP on tight junctions (TJs), which regulate paracellular permeability of the BBB, is not well understood. In
the present study, we examined IP-induced changes in TJs
before and after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
in mice, and the association between changes in TJs and
tolerance to a subsequent insult. After IP, we found
decreased levels of transmembrane TJ proteins occludin
and claudin-5, and widened gaps of TJs with perivascular
swelling at the ultrastructural level in the brain. An
inflammatory response was also observed. These changes
were reversed by inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) via the specific ERK1/2 inhibitor

U0126. After MCAO, reduced brain edema and inflammatory responses were associated with altered levels of
angiogenic factors and cytokines in preconditioned brains.
Pretreatment with U0126 reversed the neuroprotective
effects of IP against MCAO. These findings suggest that
ERK1/2 activation has a pivotal role in IP-induced changes
in TJs and inflammatory response, which serve to protect
against BBB breakdown and inflammation after ischemic
stroke.

The blood–brain barrier (BBB) plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis by regulating the entry of molecules
and cells into the brain from peripheral circulation. Dysregulated or increased BBB permeability may endanger the
brain, and BBB dysfunction is observed in many brain
diseases, including ischemic stroke (Stamatovic et al.
2008).
Tight junctions (TJs) are located between adjacent
endothelial cells of the BBB and function as gates for
molecule transportation through paracellular clefts (Coisne
and Engelhardt 2011). Occludin and claudin-5 are the
major protein components of transmembrane TJs and are
responsible for regulating paracellular permeability (Coisne and Engelhardt 2011). Increases in paracellular permeability, which are involved in most pathological cases of
BBB breakdown, allow proteins, cytokines, and cells from
peripheral circulation into the brain, thereby inducing
pathological brain responses (Stamatovic et al. 2008).

Decreased expression of occludin and claudin-5 mRNA
and protein is closely associated with BBB breakdown and
edema in the ischemic brain (Yang et al. 2007; Jiao et al.
2011), and the neuroprotective effects of chemical agents
against ischemic injury occur through the prevention of TJ
protein down-regulation (Ishrat et al. 2010; Wang et al.
2012). Dysregulated TJ proteins, therefore, contribute to
BBB breakdown and brain tissue damage following
ischemic injury.
Ischemic preconditioning (IP) comprised mild ischemic
stimuli that induce the brain tolerance to a subsequent
ischemic insult that is harmful (Narayanan et al. 2013). The
neuroprotective mechanisms of IP are diverse and include
up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes, increased DNA
repair, and suppression of inflammation (Narayanan et al.
2013). IP also reduces BBB disruption in the ischemic
brain (Masada et al. 2001; Gesuete et al. 2011) and prevents increases in paracellular permeability and TJ protein
disorganization after oxygen–glucose deprivation in vitro
(Gesuete et al. 2011). These studies imply that IP-induced
tolerance is related to the tightness of TJs. However, it is
not clear whether IP produces changes in TJs before severe
ischemic injury. Proinflammatory mediators produced by
cerebral endothelial cells and cytokines released from brain
cells or the peripheral circulation increase paracellular
permeability (de Vries et al. 1996; Bolton et al. 1998;
Stanimirovic and Satoh 2000; Candelario-Jalil et al. 2007).
Since cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and
interleukin (IL)-1b, which have key roles in inducing tolerance, are mildly increased in the brain after IP (Karikó
et al. 2004), IP-induced cytokines may affect BBB permeability or may be caused by dysregulated BBB prior to
ischemic insults.
According to definitions by Meller and Simon (2013),
the response of preconditioning is changes in the tissue
prior to a harmful stress, whereas tolerance is the response
of preconditioned tissue following an insult. Here, we
examined changes in TJs following a brief bilateral common carotid artery occlusion [BCCAO, a global IP (Shin
et al. 2009)] and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO,
an ischemic insult), as well as the association between
changes in TJs and tolerance after preconditioning.

guidelines for the ethical use of experimental animals.
Mice were acclimatized for 1 week before the experiments
in an animal room under a 12-h light/dark cycle at
22 ± 2 °C. The number of animals used was minimized to
reduce animal suffering.
IP by BCCAO
Detailed procedures for BCCAO preconditioning were
previously described (Shin et al. 2009). Briefly, mice were
anesthetized with isoflurane (1.6–2 %), and a fiber optic
probe was glued to the right parietal bone (2 mm posterior
and 5 mm lateral to bregma) and connected to a laserDoppler flowmeter (Periflux System 5010, Perimed, Sweden). Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was continuously monitored using a computer-based data acquisition system
(Perisoft). IP was induced by three 1-min occlusions of
both common carotid arteries, each followed by 5 min of
reperfusion. Wounds were closed and animals were
returned to their cages. In sham-operated mice, the carotid
arteries were exposed for 15 min without occlusion. Control animals did not undergo surgery.
Transient MCAO
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane 24 h after BCCAO,
or sham operation (Shin et al. 2009). Detailed procedures
for transient MCAO were previously described (Shin et al.
2009). Briefly, 6–0 silicon-coated monofilament surgical
suture (Doccol Cooperation, Redlands, CA, USA) was
inserted into the exposed right external carotid artery,
advanced into the internal carotid artery, and wedged into
the circle of Willis to obstruct the origin of the MCA. The
filament was left in place for 30 min and withdrawn to reestablish CBF. CBF continuously recorded during MCAO
and reperfusion periods. Only animals that exhibited a
greater than 85 % reduction in CBF during MCA occlusion
and at least an 80 % recovery after 10 min of reperfusion
were included in the study. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5 °C with a thermostatically controlled
heating pad during surgery and recovery until consciousness was regained.
Drug administration

Materials and methods
Animals
Male C57BL/6 mice, aged 10–11 weeks, were used in the
experiments (Orient Bio Inc., Seongnam, Republic of
Korea). All procedures were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the Medical School of
Ewha Womans University and conformed to international

U0126 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was prepared
in normal saline containing 0.4 % dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich) as a stock solution of 1 mg/ml.
Each mouse received 100 ll containing a 30 lg/kg dose
via the tail vein injection 23 h after BCCAO. The same
amount of normal saline containing 0.4 % DMSO was used
as a vehicle. The dose of U0126 and the time point for
observation of phosphorylated extracellular signal-

regulated kinase1/2 (pERK1/2) after U0126 treatment were
modified from a previous study (Wang et al. 2004).
Neurological score and wire suspension test
Neurological score and performance in the wire suspension
test were examined before and 3 days after MCAO. A fourpoint graded neurological score was employed (Li et al.
2004): 0 = no deficit, 1 = forelimb weakness and torso
turning to the ipsilateral side when held by the tail,
2 = circling to the affected side, 3 = unable to bear weight
on the affected side and 4 = no spontaneous locomotor
activity or barrel rolling. The wire suspension test was
modified from a previous study (Takahashi et al. 2009). A
mouse was placed on a wire (60 cm in length and 2 mm
thick, elevated up to 60 cm from a surface) at a point
midway between two support posts for 30 s. Performance
was evaluated using the following scores: 0 = fell off,
1 = hung onto the bar with two forepaws, 2 = hung onto
the bar with two forepaws and attempted to climb onto the
bar, 3 = hung onto the bar with two forepaws and one or
both hind paws, 4 = hung onto the bar with all four paws
with tail wrapped around the bar, 5 = escaped to a support
post. The average score across three trials was calculated.
Measurements of infarct volume and brain edema
Infarct volume was measured following previously
described procedures (Lin et al. 1993). Mice were euthanized 3 days after MCAO, and the brains were removed,
frozen and sectioned (30 lm thick) using a cryostat. Brain
sections were collected serially at 600-lm intervals, and
stained with cresyl violet. Infarct volumes were measured
using an image analyzer (Axiovision LE 4.1, Carl Zeiss,
Jena, Germany). Values were reported after correction for
post-ischemic swelling as previously described (Lin et al.
1993). To measure brain edema, the whole brain was
quickly removed 24 h after IP or MCAO, dissected into
right and left hemispheres, and weighed (wet weight). Dry
weight of each hemisphere was then measured after drying
the tissue for 3 days in an oven at 100 °C. Hemispheric
water content was calculated as (1-dry weight/wet
weight) 9 100 (Lin et al. 1993). An edema index was
calculated by dividing water content in the ipsilateral
hemisphere by that in the contralateral hemisphere to
assess vasogenic edema induced by MCAO (Shin et al.
2011).
Western blot analysis
Cortical tissue from the ipsilateral hemisphere was used for
Western blotting. Tissue was lysed in 10 ml sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS) buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, 1 %

15

IGEPAL CA-630, 0.25 % deoxycholic acid, 150 mM
NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1 mM NaF,
0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate, pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete Mini, Roche, Mannheim, Germany), incubated for 20 min on ice, and
centrifuged at 15,7009g for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein
concentration of the supernatant was determined (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), and 80 lg of protein
was loaded for SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
Protein was transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore Corporate, Billerica, MA, USA) using an
electroblotting apparatus. Membranes were blocked for 1 h
in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1 % Tween-20
and 5 % dry milk, incubated overnight with antibodies
against occludin (1:1,000; Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA), claudin-5 (1:1,000; Invitrogen Corporation), pERK1/2 (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA), Ser-473 phosphorylated Akt (pAkt,
1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), TNF-a (1:500; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), IL-1b (1:100, R&D, Minneapolis,
MN, USA), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra, 1: 200;
R&D), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, 1:500;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1,
1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Membranes were
washed three times (20 min each) with TBS containing
0.1 % Tween-20, incubated with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h and washed three
times (20 min each) with TBS containing 0.1 % Tween-20.
Protein bands were visualized with the Western Blotting
Luminal Reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Each
membrane was re-probed with anti-actin (1:1,000), antiERK1/2 (1:2000), or anti-Akt (1:1,000; all from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) antibody after application of a stripping
solution (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA).
Samples from the same three animals in each group were
analyzed by Western blots using each primary antibody
listed above. For quantification, densities of the occludin,
claudin-5, TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-1ra, VEGF, and Ang-1 bands
were normalized to the density of actin, and densities of the
pERK1/2, or pAkt bands were normalized to the density of
the total (phosphorylated ? unphosphorylated) forms of
the same proteins using ImageJ software (version 1.37,
NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).
Immunofluorescence staining
Animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital
(120 mg/kg, i.p.) 24 h after MCAO, and perfused transcardially with saline followed by cold 4 % formaldehyde
in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Brains were
removed, incubated overnight in fixative, and stored in a
30 % sucrose solution. Using a cryostat, serial coronal
brain sections (20 lm thick, 600-lm intervals) were cut

123

16

throughout the region spanning ?1.4 to -1.0 mm from
bregma and mounted on gelatin-coated slides. Brain sections were incubated in TBS containing 0.1 % Triton
X-100, 5 % normal serum, and 1 % bovine serum albumin
for 1 h and incubated overnight in primary antibodies for
Iba1 (1:1,000; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka,
Japan), CD11b (1:1,000; AbD Serotec, Kidlington, UK), or
CD68 (1:1,000; Chemicon International). For double
immunofluorescence staining, primary antibody for CD31
(1:100; BD bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) was co-incubated with the antibody for occludin (1:100; Invitrogen
Corporation) or claudin-5 (1:100; AbcamÒ, Cambridge,
UK). Secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:1,000; Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) for single staining or to Alexa fluorÒ568
(1:1,000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) for double
staining were applied to the sections for 1 h. Sections were
washed with TBS between all steps. Vectashield mounting
medium containing the nuclear stain 60 -diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI, Vector Laboratories, Inc.) was
applied to brain sections before placing the coverslip.
Fluorescence images were obtained at 4-lm thicknesses
through the z axis of sections, covering a total of 20 lm in
depth, using a confocal microscope (LSM5 PASCAL; Carl
Zeiss) equipped with a filter set with excitation at 488 and
543 nm. Densely stained and round-shaped Iba1-, CD11b-,
and CD68-positive cells were quantified using the Axiovision LE program (Carl Zeiss). Two serial brain sections
from each animal were used, and quantification was performed in three different areas (500 lm2) of the lateral
cortex in the right hemisphere (ipsilateral to ischemia) for
each brain section. The mean cell number for six 500-lm2
areas was calculated for each animal (Park et al. 2012).
Transmission electron microscopic analysis
Twenty-four hours after IP, animals were perfused with
2 % paraformaldehyde and 2.5 % glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M
phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at a speed of 3 ml/min using a
pump system (Millipore). Coronal brain sections (1 mm
thick; between ?1.2 and -1.0 mm from bregma) were cut,
and the lateral cortex was dissected into small pieces
(1.0 9 1.0 9 1.0 mm). Sections were post-fixed in 1 %
osmium tetroxide (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA, USA) for
1 h, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon 812 Resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA). Areas of
interest were selected from 1-lm thick semi-thin sections
cut with an ultra-microtome (Reichert-jung, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and stained with toluidine blue. Ultrathin
(60–70 nm) sections were cut, stained with 1 % uranyl
acetate (Ted Pella, Inc.) and 1 % lead citrate (Ted Pella,
Inc.), and examined with an electron microscope (Hitach
7650; Hitach, Tokyo, Japan). Images were obtained using a

123

Morada camera (Soft Imaging System, Olympus Soft
Imaging Solutions GmbH, Münster, Germany). Angles of
TJs with respect to the lumen and TJ gaps were measured
according to previously described methods (Daneman et al.
2010) using analySIS software (Soft Imaging System).
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean.
Comparisons between two groups were analyzed using
unpaired Student’s t tests. Comparisons among more than
two groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc Fisher’s protected least significant difference tests (Statview version 5, SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Neurological and hanging wire test
scores were analyzed using Mann–Whitney U tests
(Prism4, GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
Statistical significance was set at p \ 0.05.

Results
IP induces ERK1/2-dependent changes in TJ protein
levels
To test whether levels of TJ proteins are altered by IP,
occludin and claudin-5 proteins were measured 6, 24, or
48 h after IP. Levels of claudin-5 were reduced at 6 h
(0.78 ± 0.02) compared to control (0.93 ± 0.07, 0.85-fold
change; p = 0.04), and levels of occludin were reduced at
24 h (0.65 ± 0.07, 0.70-fold change; p \ 0.01) and 48 h
(0.73 ± 0.04, 0.78-fold change; p = 0.04) compared with
control (0.92 ± 0.05; Fig. 1a). Both protein levels were
lowest at 24 h after IP. Reductions in protein expression
were confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. In the
control brain, occludin (red, Fig. 1b) and claudin-5 (red,
Fig. 1c) were clearly localized in the vessels stained by the
endothelial marker CD31 (green, Fig. 1b, c), but levels of
staining were decreased 24 h after IP. VEGF reduces TJ
protein levels (Argaw et al. 2009) and up-regulation of
VEGF together with down-regulation of Ang-1 contributes
to BBB breakdown and brain edema (Zhang et al. 2002).
At 24 h after IP, which was the time of lowest TJ protein
levels, VEGF levels were significantly increased
(0.48 ± 0.01 vs. 0.32 ± 0.01, 1.51-fold change; p \ 0.01)
but Ang-1 levels were unchanged compared with control,
suggesting that IP causes a shift in VEGF/Ang-1 expression resulting in an increase in BBB permeability (Fig. 1d).
It was previously reported that IP activates ERK1/2 and
Akt, and that their inhibition blocks IP-induced neuroprotection (Shamloo et al. 1999; Gu et al. 2001; Lange-Asschenfeldt et al. 2004; Miao et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2006;
Zhang et al. 2007). In addition, these kinases are involved

in down-regulation of TJ proteins and hyperpermeability of
brain-derived endothelial cells (Fischer et al. 2004, 2005;
Andras et al. 2005). To examine the relationship between
levels of kinases and TJ proteins in the preconditioned
brain, pERK1/2 and pAkt levels were examined 6, 24, or
48 h after IP. IP significantly increased ERK1/2 activation,
which peaked at 24 h (0.86 ± 0.02 vs. 0.56 ± 0.02, 1.55fold change relative to control; p \ 0.01). This up-regulation of pERK1/2 was sustained at 48 h (0.74 ± 0.01, 1.34fold change relative to control; p \ 0.05). Levels of pAkt,
however, did not differ from control at any time point
(Fig. 2a). Therefore, the IP used in this study appears to
activate ERK1/2 but not Akt. To determine the role of
ERK1/2 activation in TJ protein levels in the preconditioned brain, the specific ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (30 lg/
kg, i.v.) was administered to mice 23 h after IP (Fig. 2b).
One hour after U0126 administration, pERK1/2 levels in

preconditioned brains were markedly reduced (0.39 ± 0.03
vs. 0.92 ± 0.04; p \ 0.01 vs. vehicle; Fig. 2b). Also,
ERK1/2 inhibition restored occludin (1.17 ± 0.1 vs.
0.84 ± 0.03; p \ 0.01 vs. vehicle) and claudin-5
(0.69 ± 0.03 vs. 0.56 ± 0.03; p \ 0.01 vs. vehicle) levels
in the preconditioned brain (Fig. 2c). These results suggest
that TJ protein levels in the BBB depend on IP-induced
ERK1/2 activation.
IP induces structural TJ changes
Next, we examined the ultrastructural morphology of TJs
in brain endothelial cells 24 h after IP. Vessels were
examined from 2 or 3 mice in each group. In control brains,
vessels were round, and the alignment of TJs between
endothelial cells was mostly parallel to the plane of the
vessel lumen [75.6 ± 7.7 % of TJs within a 30° angle of

the lumen plane; Fig. 3a (left upper panel), 3b]. Intercellular gaps of TJs were electron-dense, and apical gaps were
tightly closed [13.9 ± 0.2 nm, Fig. 3a (right upper panel)
and 3c]. After IP, vessels were deformed and perivascular
swelling was observed [Fig. 3a (left middle panel)]. This
mild perivascular swelling did not extend to the formation
of brain edema measured by percent water content (control,
78.55 ± 0.12 %; IP, 78.83 ± 0.25 %; n = 5 in each
group; p = 0.34 compared with control). Also the angle of

123

TJs to the lumen was increased (30.9 ± 9.8 % of TJs
within a 30° angle, p \ 0.01 vs. control; Fig. 3b). TJs were
less electron-dense, and apical gaps were significantly
widened [19.5 ± 0.6 nm, p \ 0.01 vs. control; Fig. 3a
(right middle panel), c]. U0126 administration reversed
these IP-induced changes in TJ angle (81.3 ± 5.1 % of TJs
within a 30° angle, p \ 0.01 vs. IP; Fig. 3b) and TJ gap
[13.2 ± 0.3 nm, p \ 0.01 vs. IP; Fig. 3a (lower panels), c].
These results suggest that IP affects not only levels of TJ

Brain Struct Funct (2015) 220:13–26

proteins but also the structure of TJs via ERK1/2
activation.
ERK1/2 activation involved in IP-induced
inflammatory response
Reductions in TJ protein levels and structural changes in
TJs with mild perivascular swelling suggest that IP compromises the BBB. Disruptions of TJs may increase the
paracellular flux of blood-born molecules and may be
involved in inflammatory responses in the brain (Coisne
and Engelhardt 2011). Therefore, we examined whether IP

19

induces inflammatory responses, such as increases in TNFa and IL-1b protein levels and activation of inflammatory
cells in the brain. Levels of TNF-a (0.48 ± 0.03 vs.
0.15 ± 0.01, 3.29-fold change relative to control;
p \ 0.01) and IL-1b (0.45 ± 0.04 vs. 0.16 ± 0.01, 2.88fold change relative to control; p \ 0.01) were significantly
increased after IP (Fig. 4a), which agrees with previous
studies showing induction of proinflammatory cytokines
after IP (Cardenas et al. 2002; Shin et al. 2009). Cytokines
can be released by activated microglia or infiltrated bloodborn cells. To test whether IP increases the number of
activated microglia/macrophages, we stained cortical

suggest that IP induces an inflammatory response that is
partly dependent on ERK1/2 and coupled with alterations
of TJs.
Reversal of IP neuroprotective effects by ERK1/2
inhibition
To test whether IP-induced ERK1/2 activation is involved
in neuroprotection against ischemic stroke, MCAO was
performed in mice treated with vehicle or U0126 after IP
(Fig. 5a), and infarct volumes were measured 3 days later.
Infarct volumes in vehicle-treated mice after IP (total,
21.81 ± 4.78 mm3; cortex, 9.60 ± 4.37 mm3; striatum,
9.74 ± 0.31 mm3; Fig. 5b) were comparable to the infarct

Brain Struct Funct (2015) 220:13–26

volumes observed after IP in our previous study (Shin et al.
2009). Compared to vehicle treatment, U0126 administration after IP significantly increased infarct volumes considering the total hemisphere (45.43 ± 4.95 mm3, 2.08fold change, p \ 0.01), cortex (29.91 ± 6.13 mm3, 3.12fold change, p = 0.03), and striatum (10.98 ± 0.41 mm3,
1.13-fold change, p = 0.04; Fig. 5b). No differences in
CBF were found between U0126 and vehicle groups
(Fig. 5c). Vehicle- and U0126-treated preconditioned mice
showed no differences in neurological score or performance in the wire suspension test before MCAO (Fig. 5d,
e), but U0126-treated preconditioned mice showed significant neurological deficits after MCAO (2.75 ± 0.41 vs.
1.17 ± 0.17 for neurological score, 3.33 ± 0.43 vs.
4.72 ± 0.10 for wire suspension test, p = 0.01 vs. vehicle
for both tests). These results suggest that IP-induced
ERK1/2 activation plays a pivotal role in protecting both
brain structure and function against ischemic injury.
Reversal of IP-induced vascular protection by ERK1/2
inhibition
The extent of vasogenic edema caused by BBB breakdown
is correlated with degree of ischemic brain damage (Kondo

21

et al. 1997; Hirt et al. 2009). To test the role of ERK1/2
activation in edema formation and BBB breakdown after
ischemic injury in the preconditioned brain, brain edema
was measured 24 h after MCAO, which is the time point of
vasogenic edema formation (Shin et al. 2011). Edema
indices in preconditioned brains were significantly
increased after U0126 administration (1.028 ± 0.002)
compared with vehicle treatment (1.009 ± 0.002, p \ 0.01;
Fig. 6a). Next, we examined levels of TJ proteins that are
associated with BBB breakdown after ischemic stroke
(Yang et al. 2007; Jiao et al. 2011). Ischemic stroke reduced
levels of occludin (0.71 ± 0.02 vs. 0.93 ± 0.02) and
claudin-5 (0.55 ± 0.03 vs. 0.75 ± 0.03) in mice with sham
surgery (0.76-fold change and 0.73-fold change, respectively, both p \ 0.01 vs. control). However, IP significantly
prevented this reduction in occludin (0.97 ± 0.03) and
claudin-5 (0.80 ± 0.03) levels (1.36-fold change and 1.46fold change, respectively, both p \ 0.01 vs. sham; Fig. 6b).
The effect of IP was reversed by U0126 (0.87 ± 0.03 for
occludin, 0.57 ± 0.06 for claudin-5, p = 0.01 and p \ 0.01
vs. IP, respectively). We observed that IP reduced
(0.92 ± 0.04, 0.79-fold change relative to sham, p \ 0.01)
the increase in VEGF following ischemia (1.16 ± 0.07 vs.
0.53 ± 0.01, 2.18-fold change relative to control, p \ 0.01;

were reversed by U0126 (1.12 ± 0.01 and 0.49 ± 0.05,
respectively, both p \ 0.01 vs. IP; Fig. 6b). The findings
suggest that IP-induced ERK1/2 activation prevents BBB
breakdown by preserving TJ protein levels and modulating
VEGF and Ang-1 levels in the ischemic brain.

Reversal of anti-inflammatory effects of IP by ERK1/2
inhibition
BBB breakdown is associated with neuroinflammation
after ischemic stroke (Stamatovic et al. 2008). Therefore,
we further examined ischemia-induced inflammatory
response in the preconditioned brain 24 h after MCAO. We
observed that IP reduced (0.40 ± 0.01 and 0.38 ± 0.01,
0.79-fold change and 0.86-fold change, respectively, both
p \ 0.01 vs. sham) the ischemia-induced elevations of
TNF-a (0.51 ± 0.01 vs. 0.28 ± 0.03) and IL-1b
(0.44 ± 0.01 vs. 0.20 ± 0.02) (1.84-fold and 2.23-fold
change, respectively, both p \ 0.01 vs. control), whereas
IP increased the endogenous IL-1b inhibitor IL-1ra
(1.04 ± 0.01 vs. 0.73 ± 0.08, 1.43-fold change relative to
sham, p \ 0.01; Fig. 7a). These results are consistent with
our previous report that IP increases IL-1ra, thereby
decreasing the IL-1b/IL-1ra ratio (Shin et al. 2009). Also
the data suggest that the IP-induced reduction in inflammatory response is not simply caused by attenuation of
BBB breakdown, but also partly caused by induction of
anti-inflammatory cytokines. Similar to TNF-a and IL-1b
levels, IP also reduced the elevated numbers of activated
microglia/macrophages 24 h after MCAO (39.33 ± 3.05
vs. 60.17 ± 2.21 for Iba1, 35.17 ± 2.40 for CD68, both
p \ 0.01 vs. sham; Fig. 7b). All of these anti-inflammatory
effects of IP in the ischemic brain were reversed by U0126
(Fig. 7a, b). Together, these results suggest that IP-induced
ERK1/2 activation has an important role in reducing
inflammatory responses in the brain after ischemic injury.

Discussion
In this study, we examined IP-induced changes in levels of
TJ proteins before and after ischemic stroke. We found that
decreased levels of TJ proteins and inflammatory responses
were dependent on ERK1/2 activation after IP. Furthermore, we demonstrated that inhibition of ERK1/2 reversed
the neuroprotective effects of IP on BBB breakdown and
brain inflammation after MCAO, suggesting a pivotal role
of IP-induced ERK1/2 activation in the induction of
tolerance.
It is well recognized that an increase in proinflammatory
cytokines is one response to preconditioning stimuli
(Karikó et al. 2004). However, the source of the cytokines
that are increased by IP has not been clearly identified. We
focused on IP-induced changes in TJs because brain
endothelial cells play important roles in the initiation of
brain inflammation, either by releasing inflammatory
mediators or through BBB breakdown (Stanimirovic and
Satoh 2000; Coisne and Engelhardt 2011). We observed a
reduction in occludin and claudin-5 protein levels,

23

morphological changes in TJs with perivascular swelling.
Also, the potent vascular permeability factor VEGF was
increased without changes in the expression of Ang-1,
which inhibits the effects of VEGF on BBB leakage
(Zhang et al. 2002), suggesting that IP shifts angiogenic
factors toward an increase in BBB permeability. This
possibility was further supported by findings that inflammatory responses, such as increased TNF-a and IL-1b and
activated microglia/macrophages, were elicited at the time
of TJ disruption after IP.
Activation of ERK1/2 in the ischemic brain can be
either protective or detrimental depending on its source
(Sawe et al. 2008). Increased ERK1/2 activity caused by
severe ischemic injury itself can contribute to brain damage
(Alessandrini et al. 1999), whereas ERK1/2 activity caused
by IP can be neuroprotective (Shamloo et al. 1999; Gu
et al. 2001). We determined that ERK1/2 activation after IP
was responsible for the changes in TJs, as these changes
were reversed by administration of the ERK1/2 inhibitor
U0126. Our findings support previous reports that an
ERK1/2 inhibitor blocks the effects of ERK1/2 activation
on occludin and claudin-5 levels, and permeability in brain
endothelial cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide or HIV-Tat
protein (Andras et al. 2005; Fischer et al. 2005). However,
we found that the effect of IP on inflammatory responses
was only partially prevented by U0126, suggesting that
some inflammatory response arose from the brain cells, and
not completely from outside the brain. Also, signaling
pathways other than ERK1/2, such as nuclear factor jB,
may have a role in IP-induced inflammatory response
(Karikó et al. 2004). However, our results exclude the
possibility that IP-induced changes in TJs might result
from secondary effects of increased TNF-a and IL-1b
proteins (Stanimirovic and Satoh 2000; Didier et al. 2003),
as alterations in TJs were completely prevented by ERK1/2
inhibition despite an incomplete prevention of inflammatory response. Although previous studies show a crucial
role of activated ERK1/2 in preconditioning-induced tolerance (Shamloo et al. 1999; Gu et al. 2001; Lange-Asschenfeldt et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2006), its action in the brain
before ischemic insults has not been demonstrated.
Therefore, our study provides the first evidence of IPinduced changes in TJs and inflammatory responses via
ERK1/2 activation before severe ischemic injury.
Endogenous vascular protective and anti-inflammatory
mechanisms may be activated in response to IP-induced
BBB disruption and inflammatory responses, thereby
reducing brain injury after a subsequent severe ischemic
insult. As we expected, IP reduced vasogenic edema
caused by BBB breakdown, and this was associated with
less of a reduction in TJ protein levels. Protective effects
on TJ protein levels might be attributed to the altered
expressions of angiogenic factors VEGF and Ang-1 in the

ischemic brain. A previous study reported that increased
VEGF expression and decreased Ang-1 are associated
with BBB leakage during the acute phase after embolic
stroke, suggesting that a balance between VEGF and Ang1 is required to maintain the integrity of the BBB (Zhang
et al. 2002). In another study, administration of recombinant Ang-1 was found to antagonize BBB disruption
and increase in metalloproteinase-9 activity caused by
VEGF treatment after ischemic stroke (Valable et al.
2005). In addition, over-expression of Ang-1 is reported to
restore the reduction of TJ protein levels (occludin,
claudin-5, and zonula occludens-1) and the increase in
BBB leakage is caused by the over-expression of VEGF
in the ischemic brain (Shen et al. 2011). Therefore, the
reduced vasogenic edemas in the preconditioned brain
after MCAO in the present study might result from the
protection of TJ protein levels by reduced VEGF and
increased level of Ang-1.
Repressed inflammatory responses at the time of vasogenic edema formation might have been a result of reduced
BBB breakdown in the preconditioned brain after MCAO,
as dysregulated BBB permits infiltration of plasma proteins
and peripheral cells (Sandoval and Witt 2008). In addition
to the implication of reduction of BBB breakdown, we
suggest that anti-inflammatory mediators may have
decreased inflammatory responses, as IP enhanced IL-1ra
levels after MCAO (Fig. 7a). IL-1ra is known to protect the
ischemic brain by blocking IL-1 receptors and thereby
attenuating inflammation (Barone et al. 1998). Accordingly, our results support the idea that a mild inflammatory
response induced by preconditioning produces feedback
inhibition of inflammation through anti-inflammatory
cytokines or decoy receptors of proinflammatory cytokines,
which limits brain damage due to a subsequent ischemic
insult (Karikó et al. 2004).
Studies defining the key pathways of preconditioning
and tolerance will be valuable for identifying targets of
drug therapy to protect patients with high risk of ischemic
stroke and to reduce brain damage following ischemic
stroke (Meller and Simon 2013). We showed that via
ERK1/2 activation, preconditioning alters TJs and inflammatory responses as well as levels of angiogenic factors
and cytokines after ischemic stroke. These findings suggest
a pivotal role of ERK1/2 in aspects of paracellular permeability and inflammation after IP, and provide clues for
developing pharmacological treatments for the prevention
and treatment of stroke.
