Ischemic stroke interrupts the flow of blood to the brain and subsequently results in cerebral infarction and neuronal cell death,
leading to severe pathophysiology. Glutathione (GSH) is an antioxidant with cellular protective functions, including reactive oxygen
species (ROS) scavenging in the brain. In addition, GSH is involved in various cellular survival pathways in response to oxidative
stress. In the present study, we examined whether GSH reduces cerebral infarct size after middle cerebral artery occlusion in vivo and
the signaling mechanisms involved in the promotion of cell survival after GSH treatment under ischemia/reperfusion conditions
in vitro. To determine whether GSH reduces the extent of cerebral infarction, cell death after ischemia, and reperfusion injury,
we measured infarct size in ischemic brain tissue and the expression of claudin-5 associated with brain infarct formation. We also
examined activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, inactivation of FOXO3, and expression of Bcl2 to assess the role of GSH in promoting
cell survival in response to ischemic injury. Based on our results, we suggest that GSH might improve the pathogenesis of ischemic
stroke by attenuating cerebral infarction and cell death.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke resulting from obstruction of a blood vessel
supplying the brain, a major cause of morbidity and mortality
[1], leads to disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB),
which subsequently causes vasogenic edema [2‚Äì4] and neuronal cell death [5]. Reperfusion after occlusion induces
water entry through endothelial cells, resulting in cerebral
infarction and further increases in BBB permeability [6, 7].
This reperfusion influences brain tissue by generating reactive
oxygen species (ROS) [8], which contributes to oxidative
stress. Glutathione (L-c-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine; GSH) is
an intracellular thiol tripeptide present in all mammalian
tissues that plays a crucial role in cellular protection against
oxidant damage [9]. A decrease in cellular GSH induces
the release of cytochrome c, and the redox environment
thus triggers the apoptotic signaling pathway [10, 11]. In
addition, a deficiency of GSH is associated with a variety of
central nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease

[12], Parkinson‚Äôs disease [13], and stroke [14, 15]. The BBB
is a structural and functional barrier that regulates the
exchange of many metabolites from circulating blood to
brain tissue [16]. In cerebral ischemia, the BBB is disrupted,
leading to brain infarction and secondary brain damage
[17]. Oxidative stress following stroke results in metabolic
dysfunction causing ROS accumulation [18]. GSH is reported
to have a protective effect against brain vascular endothelial
dysfunction, including endothelial barrier permeability [19],
cell death [20], and the scavenging of ROS [21]. GSH
depletion elicits endothelial oxidative stress and cell apoptosis
[20, 22]. Some clinical studies demonstrate that an increased
risk for stroke is associated with low levels of GSH in the
brain [23, 24]. Forkhead box O (FOXO), from the O type
subfamily of the forkhead transcription factor superfamily
[25], regulates a series of downstream targets and is thereby
involved in diverse cellular functions including the regulation
of cell permeability [25‚Äì28]. Furthermore, hypoxia stress
resulting from stroke triggers FOXO3-mediated dysfunction

2
of the BBB [29]. FOXO transcriptional factors are associated
with multiple mechanisms in response to oxidative stress
[30], including activation of the cellular apoptotic pathway
[31], several ROS-regulated mechanisms [32], and upregulation of several antioxidant enzymes such as manganese
superoxide dismutase [33, 34]. FOXO3 transcription factors
are downstream effectors of PI3K/Akt [35, 36]. The activity
of FOXO is modulated by the phosphorylation, acetylation,
and ubiquitination of PI3K/Akt [34]. FOXO phosphorylation
is mainly induced through the PI3K-mediated Akt pathway,
which is known to have a crucial role in cell cycle arrest
and cell survival [32]. Also, FOXO3 is associated with the
expression of Bcl2, which is an important antiapoptotic
protein [37] in cellular protection against oxidative stress
[38, 39]. In the present study, we investigated whether GSH
reduces infarct size, the association of GSH with the PI3K/Akt
pathway, and the influence of GSH on the expression of
FOXO3 and Bcl2 after ischemic injury. Our results indicate
that GSH might inhibit the effects of cerebral infarction and
boost antiapoptotic signaling after ischemic stroke, suggesting that GSH may be a potent therapeutic antioxidant that can
attenuate severe pathologies after ischemic stroke.

2. Methods and Materials
2.1. Animals. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (Orient,
Gyeonggi-Do, Republic of Korea; 8 weeks old; 250‚Äì
260 g) were subject to transient focal cerebral ischemia by
intraluminal middle cerebral artery blockade with a nylon
suture, as previously described [40]. After 60 min of middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), blood flow was restored
by withdrawing the suture, and regional cerebral blood flow
was monitored using a laser Doppler flow meter (Transonic
Systems, Inc., Ithaca, NY, USA). All animal procedures and
experiments were performed in accordance with the Guide to
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved
by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care. We used at least 5 rats in all groups
for study. Each measurement included 5 repeats per animal.
2.2. Drug Treatments. For each experiment, rats were given
anesthesia (chloral hydrate, 300 mg/kg, intravenous infusion
(i.v.)). GSH (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in normal saline (pH 7.5). Rats were injected with
GSH (500 mg/kg/mL, i.v.) 10 min after MCAO occlusion [41].
Control rats were given an equal volume of saline using the
same procedure.
2.3. Evaluation of Infarct Volume. For evaluation of brain
edema, rats were sacrificed at reperfusion 24 hr after MCAO
injury. Brain slices (2-mm thick) between ‚àí22.00 mm and
+4.00 mm relative to Bregma were incubated with 2% 2, 3,
5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) at 37‚àò C for 10 min in the dark in a drying
oven and later photographed using a Nikon E 950 digital
camera attached to a dissecting microscope. Infarct volume
was determined from digitized images using the Quantity
One software package (Bio-Rad, Philadelphia, PA, USA).
Typically, 5 slices were used for analysis.

Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity
2.4. Cresyl Violet Staining. At reperfusion 24 hr after MCAO
injury, rats were sacrificed, and brains were fixed in 3.7%
formaldehyde and quickly frozen. Tissues were sectioned
(20 ùúám) coronally and sequentially dipped into xylene for
5 min, 100% alcohol for 5 min, 95% alcohol for 5 min, and
70% alcohol for 5 min. Sections were stained with cresyl
violet (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 3 min. After
staining, slides were reacted with 70% alcohol for 5 min,
95% alcohol for 5 min, 100% alcohol for 5 min, and xylene
for 5 min. Sections were then observed under a microscope
equipped with a digital camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
2.5. Immunohistochemistry. Frozen brain sections (5 ùúám)
were cut onto clean glass slides (Thermo Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA), air-dried, and fixed in cold acetone for 10 min at
‚àí20‚àò C. The slides were first washed in Tris-buffered saline
(TBS) and then incubated with 0.3% H2 O2 in methanol to
quench endogenous peroxidase activity. Followed by a series
of washes (three times with distilled water), the sections
were blocked with 10% normal rabbit serum. Frozen brain
sections (5 ùúám) were fixed in ice-cold acetone for 20 min.
To block nonspecific labeling, sections were incubated in
5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for
30 min before addition of primary and secondary antibodies.
Primary antibodies for claudin-5 (1 : 50; Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) were applied to the samples for 24 hr at 4‚àò C
followed by a 90-min incubation with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibody (1 : 100; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) and three washes in PBS for 10 min each. After three
washes in 0.1% PBS with Tween-20 (PBST), the sections
were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit
or FITC-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody
diluted to 1 : 200 with 5% BSA fraction V in 0.1% PBST for
2 hr in the dark at room temperature. After three washes in
PBS, sections were incubated with 1 ùúág/mL 4Û∏Ä† ,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)
and 2 ùúág/mL propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) for counterstaining. Tissues were then visualized
under a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 700, Carl Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany). The percentages of relative intensity
were measured by using Image J as by referring the previous
study [42].
2.6. Cell Culture. Murine brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3
cells; ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in Dulbecco‚Äôs modified Eagle‚Äôs medium (Hyclone Laboratories,
South Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal
bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, South Logan, UT,
USA) and 100 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Hyclone
Laboratories, South Logan, UT, USA) at 37‚àò C in a humidified
atmosphere in the presence of 5% CO2 [43]. bEND.3 cells
were used after 13 passages.
2.7. Hypoxia and Reperfusion (H/R) Injury. Confluent cells
were transferred to an anaerobic chamber (Thermo Scientific,
Pittsburgh, PA, USA) (O2 tension, 0.1%) and washed three
times with PBS. Then, culture medium was replaced with

Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity
deoxygenated, glucose-free balanced salt solution, and cells
were incubated for 6 hr. Following hypoxia injury, cells were
incubated for 18 hr under normal growth conditions with or
without drug treatment [44].
2.8. Drug Treatment. GSH (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA) was dissolved in ethanol. An equivalent volume of
ethanol (final: 0.01%) or water was added to control and all
GSH-containing wells. bEnd.3 cells were exposed to 1 mM
GSH for 3 hr before H/R injury (this concentration was
chosen to study the cellular protective effect of GSH against
H/R injury based on the results of our previous study).
The present study consisted of four groups of cells. Normal
control (NC) cells were cultured with nontreated media
without H/R injury, experimental control (EC) cells were
cultured in nontreated medium for 18 hr after 6 hr of H/R
injury, and 1 mM GSH cells were pretreated with 1 mM GSH
for 3 hr before 6 hr of H/R injury. Cells were then cultured in
nontreated medium for 18 hr. Cells in the Akt inhibitor group
were treated with 100 nM Akt inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) 3 hr before H/R injury.
2.9. Determination of Intracellular ROS. The level of intracellular ROS for each treatment group was measured using
a fluorescent probe, 2Û∏Ä† , 7Û∏Ä† -dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), as previously described [45]. Cells were plated at a density of 1
√ó 106 cells/mL and treated with GSH for 24 hr. After GSH
pretreatment, H/R was performed. Then, bEND.3 cells were
treated with 5 ùúáM DCF-DA for 30 min at 37‚àò C. After washing
with PBS, fluorescence was measured with a microscope
(Nikon TS100-F ECLIPSE) equipped with a CCD camera
(Hamamatsu Photonics) [43].
2.10. Western Blot Analysis. After GSH pretreatment, H/R
injury, and restoration, cells were washed rapidly with icecold PBS, scraped, and collected. Cell pellets were lysed
with ice-cold RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA). The lysates were centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 1 hr
at 4‚àò C to produce whole-cell extracts. Protein content was
quantified using the BCA method (Pierce, IL, USA). Protein
(20 ùúág) was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel
and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane.
After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin prepared
in TBS/Tween (20 nM Tris (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%
Tween 20) for 1 hr at room temperature, immunoblots were
incubated overnight at 4‚àò C with primary antibodies that
specifically detect phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K; 1 : 2000;
Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), Akt (1 : 2000; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt;
1 : 2000; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), or ùõΩ-actin
(1 : 2000; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA). Blots were then
incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse or
-rabbit IgG antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) for
1 hr at room temperature. Enhanced chemiluminescence was
performed by ECL (Pierce, IL, USA) [43].

2.11. RT-PCR. To examine the expression of Bcl2 in GSHpretreated b.END3 cells under hypoxic conditions, reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using Bcl2 primers. Briefly, samples were lysed with
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and total
RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer‚Äôs protocol.
cDNA synthesis from mRNA and sample normalization was
performed. PCR was performed using the following thermal
cycling conditions: 10 min at 95‚àò C; 40 cycles of denaturing at
95‚àò C for 15 sec, annealing at 65‚àò C for 30 sec, and elongation at
72‚àò C for 30 sec; final extension at 72‚àò C for 10 min; and holding
at 4‚àò C. PCR was performed using the following primers (5Û∏Ä† to
3Û∏Ä† ): Bcl2 (F): AAGCTGTCACAGAGGGGCTA, (R): CAGGCTGGAAGGAGAAGATG; GAPDH (F): GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG, (R): TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGC.
PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gels and
stained with ethidium bromide.
2.12. Statistical Analysis. Statistical analyses were carried out
using SPSS 18.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
Data are expressed as the mean ¬± standard error of the mean
of three independent experiments. The statistical significance
of group differences was determined by one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post hoc multiple
comparison tests. The statistical significance of differences
from the MCAO group (i.e., EC group) was determined by
t-tests. Differences were considered statistically significant at
ùëÉ < 0.05. (‚àó ùëÉ < 0.05, ‚àó‚àó ùëÉ < 0.001)

3. Results
3.1. GSH Reduced Infarct Volume following Cerebral Ischemia.
To investigate whether GSH affects vascular permeability in
the animal brain, we measured infarct volume at reperfusion
24 hr after MCAO injury using TTC staining (Figure 1(a)).
White areas indicate damaged brain areas due to ischemia
(Figure 1(a)). We sacrificed 6 rats in all groups. The graph
shows the percentage of injured ipsilateral hemisphere relative to uninjured ipsilateral hemisphere for the MCAO and
GSH groups (Figure 1(b)). The percentage of infarcted area
in the MCAO group was >17%, whereas the percentage of
brain edema after GSH treatment was <8%. Infarct volume
(%) was significantly reduced in the GSH group compared
with the MCAO group. This graph included the observation
results of 5 repeats per animal. Our findings indicate that GSH
treatment reduced cerebral infarct volume after ischemic
brain injury.
3.2. Assessment of GSH-Induced Morphological Alterations
Using Cresyl Violet Staining. Cresyl violet staining was performed at reperfusion 24 hr after MCAO injury to assess
the extent of ischemia-induced damage in the striatum and
cortex (Figure 2). In the NC group (without MCAO injury
or GSH treatment), intact cellular structure was observed in
both the cortex and striatum. In the MCAO group (i.e., EC
group), small, shrunken cell bodies and damaged tissue was
observed in the ischemic cortex and striatum (Figure 2). In
the GSH-treated group (GSH treatment and MCAO injury),

group, and we observed healthy round cells in the ischemic
cortex and striatum (Figure 2). This result included 5 repeats

3.3.GSH Prevents BBB Disruption following Cerebral Ischemia.
We conducted immunohistochemistry using claudin-5

antibody at reperfusion 24 hr after MCAO injury to examine
changes in the expression of this BBB junction protein
in the cortex (Figure 3(a)) and striatum (Figure 3(b)). In
the NC group, claudin-5 was considerably expressed in
both the cortex (Figure 3(a)) and striatum (Figure 3(b)).
However, claudin-5 expression was attenuated in both the
cortex (Figure 3(a)) and striatum (Figure 3(b)) at reperfusion
24 hr after MCAO injury (EC group). In the GSH-treated

Figure 3: Immunochemical image for confirmation of preserved claudin-5 expression by GSH treatment. (a) Immunochemical images
showed that claudin-5-positive cells (green) were particularly reduced in rat cortex of experimental control (EC) group. In GSH treatment
group, claudin-5 protein expression was observed in rat cortex compared to the EC group. (b) Ischemic striatum (EC group) showed reduced
claudin-5 expression while in GSH treatment group, claudin-5-positive cells were retained in rat striatum owing to GSH treatment. (c) The

group, claudin-5 expression was increased in both the cortex
(Figure 3(a)) and striatum (Figure 3(b)) compared with the
EC group. Figures 3(c) and 3(d) graphs expressed the relative
intensity compared to the normal control group (Figures
3(c) and 3(d)). The relative intensity was measured by using
Image J by following the previous study [42] to show to the
differences of claudin-5 expression between groups in spite
of indirect quantification method. These results included
5 repeats per animal. Based on these results, we suggest
that GSH may inhibit the degradation of claudin-5 in the
ischemic brain and protect against BBB disruption.

3.4. GSH Decreases H/R-Induced ROS Production. We measured ROS levels using DCF-DA reagent, a fluorescent dye
that visualizes ROS, in b.END3 cells. DCF-DA-positive cells
increased in number after H/R injury. ROS levels in the
1 mM GSH pretreatment group were not largely different
from those in the NC group. In the H/R injury group, ROS
levels were increased compared with those in the NC group.
This increase was partially blocked by pretreatment with
1 mM GSH (Figure 4). The H/R injury group with 1 mM
GSH pretreatment showed a clear decrease in the number of
DCF-DA-positive cells compared with the H/R injury group.

Figure 5: The measurement of PI3K, Akt expression in brain enthothelial cells after H/R-induced injury. (a) Western blotting showed that
the relative protein level of PI3K was reduced in EC compared to the NC group. The protein level of PI3K was increased in 1 mM GSH groups,
compared to the EC group. The bar graph shows the quantification of PI3K protein in all groups. (b) Western blotting showed that the relative
protein level of phosphor-Akt was reduced in EC compared to the NC group. The protein level of phosphor-Akt was increased in 1 mM GSH
groups, compared to the EC group. The bar graph shows the quantification of phosphor-Akt/Akt protein in all groups. ùõΩ-actin was used
as an internal control. Each experiment included 3 repeats per condition. Data are expressed as mean ¬± S.E.M. (‚àó ùëÉ < 0.05, ‚àó‚àó ùëÉ < 0.001).
Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt).

This result suggests that GSH inhibits H/R-induced ROS
production in b.END3 cells.
3.5. GSH Attenuates the Death of b.END3 Cells after H/R
Injury via PI3K/Akt Activation and FOXO3 Inactivation. To
investigate whether PI3K/Akt signaling is activated in H/Rinduced stress, we first measured the expression of PI3K
by western blot analysis (Figure 5(a)), as PI3K expression
correlates with the activation of cell survival signaling.
H/R-injured cells showed an obvious suppression of PI3K
expression, whereas PI3K activation in H/R-injured cells
with 1 mM GSH pretreatment was not largely different from
that in the EC group (Figure 5(a)). Next, we examined the

phosphorylation of Akt by western blot analysis (Figure 5(b)).
Phosphorylation of Akt is associated with activation of Akt
signaling and cell survival. Our results suggest that the
expression of phosphorylated Akt protein in the EC group is
attenuated compared with that in the NC group. The relative
portion of phosphorylated Akt in the 1 mM GSH group was
similar to that in the EC group. However, expression of
phosphorylated Akt in the 1 mM GSH treatment group was
higher than that in the EC group (Figure 5(b)). In addition,
more translocation of FOXO3 occurred in the GSH-treated
group than in the EC group despite the same H/R injury
(Figures 6(a) and 6(b)). These results show that GSH may
activate PI3K/Akt signaling and inhibit the activation of
FOXO3 in H/R-injured brain endothelial cells.

This ortho image shows the activation of FOXO3 by suggesting the translocation of FOXO3 into the nucleus. The translocation of FOXO3

Figure 7: The mRNA level of Bcl2 in hypoxia exposed b.End3 cells.
The mRNA level of Bcl2 was measured using RT-PCR. The mRNA
level of Bcl2 was decreased in the hypoxia injury group compared
to the normal control group. 1 mM GSH increased the mRNA level
of Bcl2 in hypoxia injured b.END3 cells. The mRNA level of Bcl2
was increased in the hypoxia injury group compared to the normal
control group. 1 mM GSH reduced mRNA level of Bcl2 in hypoxiainjured b.END3 cells. In Akt inhibitor groups, the mRNA level of
Bcl2 shows the reduction compared to the no inhibitor treatment
group, respectively. The bar graph shows the quantification of Bcl2
mRNA in all groups. GAPDH was used as an internal control. Each
experiment included 5 repeats per condition. Data are expressed as
mean ¬± S.E.M. (‚àó ùëÉ < 0.05, ‚àó‚àó ùëÉ < 0.001).

3.6. GSH Promotes the Expression of Bcl2 after H/R Injury.
To examine whether PI3K/Akt signaling contributes to the
expression of Bcl2 in H/R injury, we measured the mRNA
level of Bcl2 by RT-PCR (Figure 7), as Bcl2 correlates with
activation of cell survival signaling. H/R-injured cells showed
an obvious suppression of Bcl2 expression, whereas Bcl2
activation in H/R-injured cells with 1 mM GSH pretreatment
was markedly higher than that in the EC group (Figure 7).
Under the situation that the activation of Akt was inhibited by
an Akt inhibitor, Bcl2 expression was further reduced by GSH
pretreatment in H/R-injured cells (Figure 7). These results
show that GSH may activate PI3K/Akt signaling and thereby
promote the expression of Bcl2 as a modulator of cell survival
in H/R-injured b.END3 cells.

4. Discussion
Ischemic stroke causes brain damage and alterations in GSH
redox status [46, 47]. Cerebral infarction volume following
ischemic stroke is increased in GSH-deficient mice [48, 49].
In the present in vivo study, we demonstrated that GSH
reduces brain infarct volume after MCAO injury in the
rat brain. Junction proteins such as cadherins, ùõº-catenin,
occluding, claudin, and ùõΩ-catenin are components of the BBB
[50]. When the brain is exposed to stress, the first barrier is
brain endothelial cells sealed by tight junctions [51], which
form a junction complex between endothelial cells [52, 53].
The endothelial cells connected by junction proteins play

a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the BBB to
protect the brain [54], and tight proteins regulate paracellular
permeability [55]. The results of the present study suggest that
GSH preserves the loss of the tight junction protein claudin5 after MCAO injury. Moreover, to determine the specific
mechanism underlying the cellular protection provided by
GSH, we investigated the cellular mechanism through in vitro
experiments. In ischemic stress, the increased production
of ROS in the brain triggers signaling cascades leading
to inflammation, apoptosis, and ultimately memory and
motor deficits [56]. The appropriate regulation of ROS by
cellular antioxidant redox enzymes such as GSH is essential
to prevent oxidative stress-induced brain damage [57]. In
the present in vitro experiments, we confirmed that GSH
attenuates the production of ROS in brain endothelial cells
after ischemic injury. Hypoxia induces FOXO3-mediated
dysfunction of the BBB [29]. Therefore, we investigated the
activation of FOXO3, which is associated with disruption of
the BBB [29] and increased proapoptotic gene expression
[58], as well as the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling, which is
an upstream target of FOXO3 transcription [58, 59] and a cell
survival pathway [60, 61]. FOXO3 modulates diverse cellular
and physiological mechanisms including metabolism, apoptosis, and cellular longevity [34, 62‚Äì64]. The H2 O2 -induced
decrease in cell viability is mediated by a FOXO3-dependent
mechanism [65]. Deacetylation of FOXO3 protects mitochondria against oxidative stress by boosting mitochondrial
homoeostasis [66] and reduces the production of cellular
ROS [67, 68]. FOXO3 mediates ROS-induced apoptosis
through the expression of ROS scavenging enzymes [69]. In
the present study, we found decreased activation of FOXO3
translocation into the nucleus in the GSH-treated MCAO
injury group. This reduction may be related to a decreased
production of ROS by GSH treatment. In addition, one study
demonstrated that FOXO3 increases hypoxia-induced BBB
hyperpermeability [29]. Recent studies show that hypoxic
conditions promote the translocation of FOXO3 into the
nucleus of endothelial cells [29, 70] and increases FOXO3,
triggering hypoxia-induced degradation of junction proteins
such as VE-cadherin and claudin-5 [29]. Based on our results,
GSH may prevent the degradation of the tight junction
protein claudin-5 following ischemic stroke, which may
involve the reduced translocation of FOXO3 into the nucleus.
Moreover, phosphorylation of FOXO by Akt leads to the
holding of FOXO in the cytoplasm and the blockade of target
gene transcription [35]. Akt promotes cell survival by regulating FOXO transcription factors [71]. Activation of FOXO3
also induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in endothelial
cells by suppressing heat shock protein 70 expression [72, 73].
Activation of FOXO3 causes an increased expression of the
antiapoptotic protein Bcl2 [37]. In addition, overexpression
of Bcl2 leads to an increase in the cellular content of GSH [74,
75]. By contrast, Bcl2 deficient-mice show reduced GSH levels
in brain tissue and exhibit an increased risk of neuronal cell
death [76]. Considering the results of the present study, we
assume that an increased expression of Bcl2 may protect brain
tissue from damage due to ischemic stroke. Briefly, we suggest
three possibilities: (1) GSH attenuates cerebral infarct volume
after ischemic stroke, (2) GSH preserves the disruption of

Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity
BBB after ischemic injury, and (3) GSH improves the survival
of brain endothelial cells by promoting the PI3K/Akt pathway, inhibiting the translocation of FOXO3 into the nucleus,
and boosting the expression of Bcl2. Thus, we thought that
this study would provide the basic data to understand the role
of GSH in ischemic stroke. Ultimately, we suggest the need for
further study regarding the role of GSH in alleviating severe
brain pathologies caused by ischemic stroke.
