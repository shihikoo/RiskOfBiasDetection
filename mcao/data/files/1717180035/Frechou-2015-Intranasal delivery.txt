Progesterone is a potential neuroprotective agent for cerebral stroke. One of the STAIR's recommendations is to test different routes of delivery of therapeutic agents. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective efﬁcacy of intranasal delivery of progesterone in oleogel. Male mice were subjected to
transient middle cerebral occlusion (MCAO) for 1 h. Mice received intranasal or intraperitoneal administrations of progesterone (8 mg/kg) at 1, 6, and 24 h post-MCAO. Plasma and brain levels of steroids
were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry 2 and 24 h after the last administration of
progesterone. Behavioral and histopathological analyzes were performed at 48 h post-MCAO. For bloodbrain barrier (BBB) permeability analysis, mice received one intranasal administration of progesterone or
placebo at reperfusion and Evans Blue and sodium ﬂuorescein extravasations were assessed at 4 h postMCAO. Two hours after its nasal administration, progesterone reached elevated levels in brain and
plasma and was bioconverted to its 5a-reduced metabolites and to 20a-dihydroprogesterone. However,
brain levels of progesterone and its metabolites were about half those measured after intraperitoneal
injections, whereas levels of 11-deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone were 5-times lower. In contrast,
after 24 h, higher levels of progesterone were measured in brain and plasma after intranasal than after
intraperitoneal delivery. Intranasal progesterone decreased the mortality rate, improved motor functions,
reduced infarct, attenuated neuronal loss, and decreased the early BBB disruption. This study demonstrates a good bioavailability, a prolonged absorption and a good neuroprotective efﬁcacy of intranasal
delivery of progesterone, thus potentially offering an efﬁcient, safe, non-stressful and very easy mode of
administration in stroke patients.

1. Introduction
Stroke is a major cause of death and neurological disability
(Feigin, 2005). Currently, the only FDA-approved treatment for
acute stroke, thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), can only be used in less than 5% of patients because of its

narrow therapeutic window and risks (Wardlaw et al., 2012).
Therefore, it is necessary to develop new alternatives or complementary strategies, and there is great interest in neuroprotective
ones (Majid, 2014).
A number of studies have demonstrated neuroprotective efﬁcacy of progesterone in experimental models of stroke, and in
particular after MCAO (Gibson et al., 2008; A. Liu et al., 2012;
Schumacher et al., 2007; Stein, 2008; Wong et al., 2013). However, they have only investigated the efﬁcacy of intraperitoneal
and subcutaneous administrations (Wong et al., 2013), which
would not be the most appropriate mode of administration in
stroke patients since progesterone injection has a short half-life
in both plasma and brain. Before clinical trials, reﬁning of treatment protocols is needed. One of the STAIR's recommendations is

M. Frechou et al. / Neuropharmacology 97 (2015) 394e403

to evaluate different administration routes and to develop the
one which better mimics what is feasible and practical in clinical
settings. Intranasal delivery is one of the most attractive routes. It
has gained significant attention as a convenient, efﬁcient and
noninvasive method for the administration of drugs including
steroids (Dhuria et al., 2010; Ducharme et al., 2010; Kim et al.,
2012; Lu et al., 2011; Pires et al., 2009; Rhim et al., 2013; Van
den Berg et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2013). Recently, a comparison of intranasal administration and intravenous injection of
progesterone in mice has shown that the bioavailability in blood
2 h after intranasal administration was 14%, the blood levels being 7.35 times lower than after intravenous administration. Brain
levels of progesterone after intranasal administration did not vary
signiﬁcantly over time (2e120 min) while levels decreased with
time after the intravenous injection. Furthermore, intranasal
delivery of progesterone decreased anxiety (Ducharme et al.,
2010).
These characteristics of the intranasal administration (low level
in plasma, stability of levels in brain over 2 h, therapeutic potential)
suggest that intranasal administration of progesterone is a promising route for the delivery of progesterone after stroke. Furthermore, in addition to the pharmacokinetic advantages, nasal
application could be rapidly and easily performed in stroke patients
without the need for special equipment or qualiﬁcation. Thus,
progesterone could be administrated even before reaching the
hospital. This could represent a great advantage, as mitigate the
initial pathological processes is very important in stroke. This route
of administration should also be evaluated in other experimental
models of stroke including hemorrhagic stroke, as intraperitoneal
and subcutaneous administrations of progesterone have been
shown to be beneﬁcial in subarachnoid hemorrhage model (Yan
et al., 2013) and also in transient MCAO model followed by
delayed treatment with rt-PA (Won et al., 2014).
Progesterone acts after binding to intracellular progesterone
receptors (PR) or membrane receptors (mPR and PGRMC1) and is
also actively metabolized. Indeed, progesterone can be converted to
5a-dihydroprogesterone (5a-DHPROG) by the steroid 5a-reductases, then to 3a,5a-tetrahydroprogesterone (3a,5a-THPROG,
allopregnanolone) by the 3a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3aHSD). In addition, 5a-DHPROG can be reduced to 3b,5a-tetrahydroprogesterone
(3b,5a-THPROG,
isoallopregnanolone)
(Supplemental Figure I). Like progesterone, 5a-DHPROG can activate gene transcription (Rupprecht et al., 1993) after binding to the
intracellular PR, which have recently been shown to play a key role
in the neuroprotective effects of progesterone after MCAO (Liu
et al., 2012a). Although 3a,5a-THPROG has no afﬁnity for the
intracellular PR, it also exerts neuroprotective effects in experimental stroke, most likely by modulating GABAA receptors (Belelli
and Lambert, 2005; A. Liu et al., 2012; Sayeed et al., 2006). Progesterone can also be reduced to 20a-dihydroprogesterone (20aDHPROG), but the signiﬁcance of this pathway remains poorly
understood.
In this study, we investigated whether the intranasal delivery of
progesterone could be used therapeutically for stroke. In a transient
MCAO mice model, we compared the relative efﬁciency of intranasal administration versus intraperitoneal injection for the delivery of progesterone to the brain. We then determined whether
levels of progesterone reached in the brain by intranasal delivery
have neuroprotective efﬁcacy after MCAO. The formulation of
progesterone used in this study, is the same that could be used in
humans. It has been accepted for use in clinical studies in humans
by the German health authority (BfArM) and has been shown to be
efﬁcient in mitigating sleep dysfunction in postmenopausal women
(Steiger, 2013).

2. Experimental procedures
2.1. Animals and surgery
All procedures concerning animal care and use were carried out in strict
accordance with national guidelines (authorization 94-345 to R.G., animal facility
approval 94-043-13) and with French ethical laws (Act 87-848 and Act 2013-11) and
European Communities Council Directives (November 24, 1986 86/609/EEC).
C57BL6/129SvEv mice from our breeding colony were housed under standard
conditions with a 12 h lightedark cycle and access to food and water ad libitum.
Adult male C57BL6/129SvEv mice (3e4 months weighting 26e30 g) were used.
Transient cerebral ischemia was performed under ketamine (50 mg/kg) and
xylazine hydrochloride (6 mg/kg) according to Liu et al. (2012a). Brieﬂy, the left
common carotid artery and the internal carotid artery were isolated and temporarily
occluded. A nylon monoﬁlament (Drennan; 83 mm diameter) coated with ‘thermomelting’ glue (4 mm long, 190 mm diameter) was introduced through an arteriotomy performed in the external carotid artery and advanced into the internal
carotid artery to occlude the origin of the MCA. Occlusion of the MCA was controlled
by monitoring the cerebral blood ﬂow in the MCA territory with laser Doppler
ﬂowmetry (Moor Instruments, France). The criterion of exclusion in this study was
set on the basis of the % of decrease of blood ﬂow comparatively to baseline before
MCAO: animals with less than 50% of decrease must be excluded. On this basis, no
animals were excluded. The ﬁlament was withdrawn 1 h after occlusion to allow
reperfusion, and the common carotid artery ligature was also removed. Body temperature was monitored throughout surgery by a rectal probe and maintained at
37 ± 0.5  C with a homoeothermic blanket control unit (Harvard Apparatus, Edenbridge, Kent, UK). After surgery, the wound was sutured. The mice were returned to
their cage maintained at 30  C, with free access to food and water. In order to
prevent dehydration, mice were injected subcutaneously with 0.5 ml of 0.9% NaCl
just after reperfusion and then twice per day. All mice that survived were analyzed.
2.2. Progesterone treatments and experimental groups
For intranasal administration, progesterone was dissolved in a proprietary
oleogel (4% in ologel composed of a viscous castor oil mixture; M et P Pharma AG,
Emmetten, Switzerland). The stability of the oleogel containing progesterone has
been investigated according to the International Conference on Harmonisation of
Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH)
Guidance for Industry “Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products”, at
25  C ± 2  C/60% relative humidity (RH) ± 5% RH for 3 years and at 40  C ± 2  C/75%
RH ± 5% RH for 6 months and has shown to be stable under these conditions. The
pharmacokinetics of this formulation after intranasal administration to mice were
recently reported (Ducharme et al., 2010).
For intraperitoneal injections, progesterone was dissolved in a small volume of
ethanol and further diluted in sesame oil to obtain the desired ﬁnal steroid concentrations (0.8 mg/ml) (A. Liu et al., 2012). Progesterone was administered intranasally or intraperitoneally at the dose of 8 mg/kg. Nasal delivery was performed
without anesthesia by direct application of progesterone oleogel into each nostril
(1 ml/nostril/10 g of body weight) using a pipette.
Mice were randomly assigned to the different treatment groups. Throughout the
analysis, experimenters were blinded to the experimental conditions of the mice.
After MCAO, a number was randomly assigned to each mouse. The experimenter
knew the number of the animal and not the group to which it belongs. The blind was
lifted only when processing results. Two experiments were designed.
2.2.1. Experiment 1
It was designed to measure steroid levels in plasma and brain after intranasal or
intraperitoneal delivery of progesterone. Mice (n ¼ 42) were subjected to 1 h MCAO;
6 groups (n ¼ 7) were designed: Three treatment groups and 2 times analysis. Three
groups were composed: group 1 received no treatment; group 2 received intranasal
progesterone; group 3 was injected intraperitoneally with the same dose of progesterone. Progesterone was administered at 1, 6, and 24 h after MCAO. Two times of
analysis were chosen: mice were sacriﬁced either at 2 h after the last administration
of progesterone (i.e. 26 h post-MCAO) or at 24 h after the last administration of
progesterone (i.e 48 h post-MCAO). Mice were handled gently to minimize stress
and were quickly decapitated by rapid cervical dislocation without anesthesia. Blood
samples were taken and the brain dissected out of the skull on a bed of crushed ice
and the ipsilateral ischemied hemisphere and contralateral hemisphere were
separated. Plasma and brain samples were frozen on dry ice and stored at 80  C
until analysis. Among the 42 mice, 5 mice died. At the end of the experiment, 6 mice
survived in all groups except for one group in which 7 mice survived. Brain and
plasma levels of steroids were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
(GC/MS) according to a validated protocol (A. Liu et al., 2012).
Brieﬂy, steroids were extracted from tissues and plasma samples from experiment 1 with methanol, and internal standards were added for steroid quantiﬁcation:
2 ng 2H6-5a-DHPROG (CDN Isotopes) for 5a-DHPROG, 2 ng 19-norprogesterone
(Steraloids, Newport, Rhode Island) for progesterone and 3a,5a-THPROG and
3b,5a-THPROG, 2 ng 2H8-DOC for DOC, and 10 ng 2H8-corticosterone (CDN Isotopes,
Sainte Foy La Grande, France) for corticosterone. Unconjugated and conjugated
steroids were separated by a previously described solid phase extraction and a

396

recycling procedure (Liere et al., 2004). The fraction containing the unconjugated
steroids was ﬁltered and further puriﬁed and fractionated by HPLC (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc, San Jose, CA). Three fractions were collected from the HPLC system: the
ﬁrst containing 5a-DHPROG, was silylated with a mixture of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltriﬂuoroacetamide, ammonium iodide (NH4I), and dithioerythritol
(1000:2:5,vol/wt/wt), the second containing progesterone 3a,5a-THPROG, 3b,5aTHPROG and DOC was derivatized with heptaﬂuorobutyric anhydride, and the third
with corticosterone was also derivatized with heptaﬂuorobutyric anhydride. GC/MS
analysis of the steroid derivatives was performed using an AS 3000 autosampler, a
Focus GC gas chromatograph, and a DSQII mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc San Jose, CA). Identiﬁcation of each steroid derivative was supported by its
retention time during GC and two diagnostic ions resulting from electron impact
ionization. Quantiﬁcation was performed in single ion monitoring mode according
to the major diagnostic ion (Supplemental Table 1).
2.2.2. Experiment 2
It was designed to evaluate the neuroprotective efﬁcacy of intranasal delivery of
progesterone.
2.2.2.1. Experiment 2, set 1. Samples size were powered for the t-test (85% power to
detect 20% infarct size reduction with a ¼ 0.05); N ¼ 15. Taking into account the
mortality rates, the initial size of samples was increased to 22e23, to be sure to have
N ¼ 15 at the time of analysis. Mice (n ¼ 45) were subjected to 1 h MCAO. Two
groups were analyzed: group 1 received intranasal placebo (MCAO þ i.n placebo;
n ¼ 23); group 2 received intranasal progesterone (MCAO þ i.n Prog; n ¼ 22).
Progesterone was administered at 1, 6, and 24 h after MCAO. This dose and treatment regimen have been shown to be neuroprotective in previous studies using
intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injections of progesterone (Wong et al., 2013).
- Mortality rates were calculated at 48 h post-MCAO. The number of mice that died
was expressed as a percentage of the total number of animals undergoing surgery in each group.
Different parameters were analyzed at 48 h post MCAO for all the mice that
survived:
- Body weight loss was calculated as a percentage change of weight at 48 h
comparatively with values measured just before surgery.
- Behavior tests were performed in a room at 20e22  C. Motor coordination and
function were assessed by the rotarod test (A. Liu et al., 2012) and by neurological scoring modiﬁed from Wahl et al. (1992). The Rotarod Test evaluates the
time the mice remain on a constant-speed rotarod (LE-8200, Bioseb, 10 revolutions/min). A trial ended when the animal fell off or gripped the device without
attempting to walk. Neurological scoring was performed on a grading scale. A
score from 0 to 3 points was attributed to each mouse as follows: score 0 ¼ no
deﬁcit; score 1 ¼ ﬂexion of right-forelimb side; score 2 ¼ score 1 þ torsion of
thorax; score 3 ¼ score 2 þ circling on the plane surface.
- Cerebral infarct volumes were determined after triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) staining of brain sections (A. Liu et al., 2012). Mice were sacriﬁced by
decapitation at 48 h post-MCAO. Brains were removed and sectioned into 7  1mm-thick coronal sections using a McIlwain tissue chopper (Mickle Laboratory
Engineering, Gomshall, Surrey, UK). To quantify ischemic damage, coronal sections were stained with 2% of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma)
for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. The area of damaged parenchyma
(unstained tissue) was measured on each slice using Image J 1.46f software (NIH,
Bethesda, MD, USA). Infarct area was then multiplied by the ratio of the surface
of the infarcted to the intact (contralateral) hemispheres at the same level to
correct for brain swelling. The total volume of damaged tissue (in mm3) was
calculated by linear integration of the corrected lesion areas
- Analysis of neuronal density was determined by immunoﬂuorescence. Coronal
sections from MCAO þ i.n placebo (n ¼ 6) and MCAO þ i.n Prog (n ¼ 6) were
processed for immunoﬂuorescence. A coronal brain slice (from Bregma 0.5
to0.5) according to the stereotaxic brain atlas of Franklin and Paxinos (2008)
was selected for each mouse, post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4  C
and cryoprotected at 4  C in 10%, 20% and 30% PBS-sucrose then frozen in
Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (OCT, SakuraeFineteck) and stored
at 20  C. Serial (14 mm) coronal brain sections were cut on a cryostat (HM 560,
Thermo Scientiﬁc) and collected for standard immunoﬂuorescence analysis
using anti-NeuN antibody. Brain sections were rehydrated in PBS 1X pH 7.4 and
then incubated overnight at 4  C with the primary anti-neuronal nuclei antiNeuN rabbit polyclonal antibody (ABN78, Millipore, Massachusetts, USA)
diluted at 1:500 in PBS 1X supplemented with 1% normal goat serum. Sections
were rinsed in PBS and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the ﬂuorescent secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488, A11008, Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) diluted at 1:200 in PBS 1X. Control of
immunostaing was shown by substitution of the antibody by non-immun serum
on adjacent sections. In this cas no-staining was observed. Photographs were
obtained with objective (20) in three regions of the cortex corresponding to
the infarct, peri-infarct and contralateral cortex. Two sections/mouse were

analyzed from 5 animals in MCAO þ i.n placebo group and 6 animals in
MCAO þ i.n progesterone group (because of a technical problem one sample
from MCAO þ i.n placebo group was unusable). For each of the three regions, the
number of NeuNþ cells per area of 0.38 mm2/section was counted. The total
number of NeuNþ cells in the two sections was taken as the representative value
in each region per mouse. Data are expressed as means ± SD of NeuNþ cells/ﬁeld
corresponding to an area of 0.76 mm2.

2.2.2.2. Experiment 2, set 2. It was designed to evaluate the effect of intranasal
delivery of progesterone on the early opening of the BBB. Permeability of BBB was
assessed by measuring the Evans Blue (EB) and sodium ﬂuorescein (NaFl) content in
the brain. Sixteen mice were subjected to MCAO for 1 h. One mouse died after
surgery. At reperfusion, mice received one intranasal administration of progesterone
(8 mg/kg, n ¼ 8) or placebo oleogel (n ¼ 7). Two hours after MCAO, normal saline
containing EB (2%) and NaFl (2%) (4 ml/kg) was administrated intravenously. Four
hours after MCAO, mice were transcardially perfused with 0.9% NaCl to remove the
intravascular dye. Brains (minus olfactory bulbs and cerebellum) were removed,
separated in ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres and weighed. The quantitar et al.
tive measure of EB and NaFl extravasation was realized according to Lenzse
(2007). Brieﬂy, trichloroacetic acid 80% was added (V:V) to the homogenates to
precipitate the proteins, followed by centrifugation (13000 g, 10 min at 4  C). For the
EB measurement, the supernatant was diluted with Ethanol 100% (1:4), and for the
NaFl measurement, the supernatant was diluted with NaOH (1:0.8). The concentrations of EB and NaFl were determined by spectrophotometric method using
standard curves (excitation at 620 nm and emission at 680 nm for EB; excitation
440 nm and emission at 525 nm for NaFl). Concentration of each dye was expressed
as microgram/g of wet tissue weight.
2.3. Statistics
For all the experiments, group size was calculated using “Statistica software (85%
power to detect a 20% difference). According to these criteria, the number of mice
per group was determined to be at least N ¼ 7 for experiment 1, N ¼ 15 for experiment 2, set 1 and N ¼ 7 for experiment 2, set 2”.
Data are expressed as means ± standard deviation except for mortality rates
which are expressed as percentage of the total number of animals undergoing
surgery in each group. Dixon's Q test was used for identiﬁcation and rejection of
outliers. Tests were performed with GraphPad Prism 4 (Graphpad Inc., California).
Differences between two groups were analyzed by unpaired two-tailed Student's t
test, or Mann Whitney test when the variances were signiﬁcantly different. Mortality rates were analyzed by Fisher exact test. P values <0.05 were considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

3. Results
3.1. Progesterone in oleogel delivered intranasally lead to sustained
high levels of progesterone and its metabolites and low levels of
corticosterone
In order to determine the relative efﬁciency of the intranasal
route of progesterone delivery, adult male mice were untreated or
treated with intranasal progesterone (8 mg/kg) in oleogel or with
the same dose of intraperitoneally injected progesterone in oil,
respectively, at 1, 6, and 24 h after MCAO (1 h). Levels of progesterone and its reduced metabolites were measured in brain and
plasma by GC/MS at 2 h and 24 h after the last administration of
progesterone. Levels of 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) and corticosterone were also measured as an index of post-stroke and posttreatment stress.
Two hours after its nasal administration, progesterone reached
elevated levels in plasma and brain (in both, ipsilateral and
contralateral hemisphere) and was bioconverted to its neuroactive
5a-reduced metabolites and to 20a-dihydroprogesterone (Fig. 1).
Consistent with the post-stroke stress, high levels of corticosterone,
were measured in brain and plasma of the ischemied mice. A large
variability was observed in this group. After intranasal administration of progesterone, this variability decreased and the brain
levels of DOC (the precursor of corticosterone) increased whereas
those of corticosterone decreased (Fig. 2).
Twenty-four hours after the last administration of progesterone,
sustained high levels of progesterone were measured in both, brain
and plasma, after the intranasal administration of progesterone

Fig. 1. Plasma and brain levels of progesterone, 5a-DHPROG, 3a,5a-THPROG, 3b,5a-THPROG and 20a-DHPROG analyzed by GC/MS at 2 h after the last administration of progesterone. Samples were taken from mice without treatment (MCAO; n ¼ 7) or after intranasal administration of progesterone at 1, 6 and 24 h post-MCAO in oleogel (MCAO þ i.n Prog;
n ¼ 6). Data represent mean ± SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.

(Fig. 3). Brain and plasma levels of DOC and corticosterone showed
high variability and no statistical differences were observed in
ischemied untreated mice and after intranasal progesterone delivery (Supplemental Fig. 2).
It is important to note that 2 h after intranasal progesterone
administration, brain levels of progesterone and its metabolites
were about half those measured after intraperitoneal injections
(Supplemental Fig. 3); and levels of DOC and corticosterone were 5times lower than those measured after intraperitoneal injections
(Supplemental Fig. 4). In contrast, after 24 h, levels of progesterone
measured in brain and plasma, as well as those of DOC and

corticosterone were about two times higher after intranasal than
after intraperitoneal delivery (Supplemental Figs. 5 and 6).
3.2. Progesterone in oleogel delivered intranasally showed
neuroprotective efﬁcacy after MCAO
The above results showed that progesterone in the formulations
tested less efﬁciently penetrated the brain after its intranasal delivery than after intraperitoneal injections. However, after intranasal administration, progesterone remained at signiﬁcant levels in
the brain for at least 24 h. Interestingly, at 2 h, levels of

Fig. 2. Plasma and brain levels of DOC and corticosterone analyzed by GC/MS 2 h after the last administration of progesterone. Samples were taken from mice without treatment
(MCAO; n ¼ 7) or after intranasal administration of progesterone at 1, 6 and 24 h post-MCAO in oleogel (MCAO þ i.n Prog; n ¼ 6). Data represent mean ± SD. *P < 0.05.

corticosterone, the adrenal steroid that is related to stress responses and which potentiates ischemic injury, were 5-times lower
after intranasal administration of progesterone. These ﬁndings
suggested that the nasal route of delivery may provide efﬁcient
neuroprotection after ischemia.
We therefore, investigated the neuroprotective potential of
intranasal delivery of progesterone. Adult male mice were subjected to 1 h MCAO and received intranasal administration of either
placebo or progesterone gel (8 mg/kg), respectively, at 1, 6 and 24 h
after MCAO. Behavioral and histopathological analyses were performed at 48 h post-MCAO. All mice lost weight 48 h post-MCAO.
Intranasal progesterone delivery did not affect the rate of weight
loss (15.94 ± 7.22% for MCAO þ i.n Prog versus 18.19 ± 12.04% for
MCAO þ placebo; P > 0.05, two-tailed unpaired Student's t test).
Intranasal administration of progesterone signiﬁcantly decreased
the mortality rate (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4A). Motor coordination, when
assessed on the rotarod, revealed that mice displayed functional
motor deﬁcits at 48 h after MCAO, comparatively to their performance before surgery. Intranasal Progesterone treatment signiﬁcantly decreased the motor deﬁcit on the rotarod (P < 0.05)
(Fig. 4B). Motor deﬁcits were also evaluated by neurological scores
attributed to each mouse using a grading scale modiﬁed from Wahl
et al. (1992) where elevated scores reﬂect higher deﬁcits. Before the
surgery, mice had score 0 and MCAO induced motor deﬁcits.
Intranasal progesterone treatment signiﬁcantly decreased the
neurological score (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4C). Ischemic brain damage was
assessed by staining brain sections with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC). The intranasal administration of progesterone
signiﬁcantly reduced the size of total infarct volume (P < 0.05)
(Fig. 5A). Neuronal density was assessed by immunoﬂuorescence
analysis and quantiﬁcation of positive NeuNþ cells in the cortex.
Intranasal delivery of progesterone increased the density of NeuNþ
cells in both the infarct and peri-infarct area (P < 0.05) and had no
effect in the contralateral cortex (Fig. 5B).
Evaluation of the leakage of BBB was assessed by the measure of
the extravasation of EB and NaFl in the parenchyma. Four hours
after MCAO, a higher EB concentration was detected in the ipsilateral hemisphere compared to the contralateral hemisphere

(P < 0.05). Intranasal administration of progesterone signiﬁcantly
deceased EB extravasation in the ipsilateral hemisphere (P < 0.05),
but had no signiﬁcant effect in the contralateral hemisphere
(P > 0.05) (Fig. 6A). Concentrations of NaFl in the ipsilateral and
contralateral hemispheres were not signiﬁcantly different, and
progesterone administration had no signiﬁcant effect on NaFl
extravasation in both hemispheres (P > 0.05) (Fig. 6B).
4. Discussion
This study shows that progesterone in oleogel delivered intranasally leads to sustained high levels of progesterone and its metabolites and low levels of corticosterone. Furthermore, this
formulation and route of delivery decreased mortality rate and are
efﬁcient to provide neuroprotection after MCAO.
Our results show that progesterone reached high levels in both
blood and brain 2 h after its intranasal delivery, and was bioconverted to its neuroactive 5a-reduced metabolites (5a-DHPROG,
3a,5a-THPROG and 3b,5a-THPROG) and to 20a-DHPROG. However,
the level of progesterone obtained in the brain was signiﬁcantly
lower compared to the one observed after intraperitoneal injection
of the same dose in oil solution. A remarkable feature was the
higher levels of progesterone measured in both, brain and plasma,
24 h after the intranasal administration compared to the intraperitoneal delivery of progesterone. These ﬁndings suggest that progesterone delivered intranasally entered the blood and the brain at
a much slower rate than progesterone injected intraperitoneally.
The sustained relatively high levels of progesterone for 24 h may
contribute to its protective effect against early mortality and to the
reduction of neuron loss after ischemia in this critical time period.
High levels of corticosterone and its precursor DOC were
measured in brain and plasma after MCAO consistent with an
activation of the pathway of corticosteroids synthesis in response
to the post-stroke stress (Fassbender et al., 1994; Mracsko et al.,
2014; Olsson et al., 1992; Zucchi et al., 2010). A large variability
was observed, as it was also reported for humans and may
contribute to the large variability in recovery after stroke
(Prabhakaran et al., 2008). Two hours after intranasal delivery of

Samples were taken from mice without treatment (MCAO; n ¼ 6) or after intranasal administration of progesterone at 1, 6 and 24 h post-MCAO in oleogel (MCAO þ i.n

progesterone, mice showed 5-times less DOC and corticosterone in
the brain than untreated mice or mice that received progesterone
by intraperitoneal injection. These ﬁndings suggest a transitory
anti-stress effect of intranasally administered progesterone. This
effect on corticosterone levels may be of a high relevance. Indeed,
sustained exposure to corticosterone is toxic to neurons and it has
been shown that ischemic injury to neurons was potentiated by
high levels of corticosterone and was attenuated by adrenalectomy
(Sapolsky and Pulsinellia, 1985). In stroke, stress and high levels of
glucocorticoids within the ﬁrst days are detrimental to functional
outcome and are associated with high morbidity (Christensen et al.,
2004; Feibel et al., 1977; Kirkland et al., 2008).

Our results show that the amount of progesterone that reached
the brain after intranasal delivery was sufﬁcient to induce neuroprotective effects and has a good efﬁciency for the treatment of the
consequences of stroke. Indeed, intranasal delivery of progesterone
decreased mortality rate, decreased the early BBB disruption,
improved motor functions, reduced lesion volume and increased
neuronal density in the infarct and peri-infarct. Several studies
have shown the neuroprotective effects of progesterone after
stroke (Wong et al., 2013). Most of them reported a beneﬁcial effect
in reducing lesion volume and increasing motor functions. However, few of them reported the effect of progesterone on mortality
rate. One study reported a decrease of mortality rate after

progesterone treatment in male mice (Gibson and Murphy, 2004)
while another study showed no effect of progesterone on mortality
rate in ovariectomised females and in aged females (Gibson et al.,
2011). A recent meta-analysis based on individual animal data
concluded that progesterone was associated with an increase in
death (Wong et al., 2013). Our results show that progesterone
oleogel administered by intranasal route decreased the mortality
rate. The immunodepression after stroke and infectious complications contribute to mortality in the early post-stroke phases
(Chamorro et al., 2007; Iadecola and Anrather, 2011; Macrez et al.,

2011). Recently, Mracsko et al. (2014) have shown an increase in
serum levels of corticoids after 1 h MCAO and a correlation with the
post-stroke lymphopenia. This effect in immune system was
abrogated by glucocorticoid receptor blockade (Mracsko et al.,
2014). The decrease of mortality rate observed after intranasal
delivery of progesterone could be also explained in part by the
lower levels of corticoids measured in brain and plasma compared
to those measured after MCAO, and after MCAO and intraperitoneal
injection of progesterone.
Our results showed that 4 h after MCAO, intranasal progesterone
treatment at the time of reperfusion limited the passage of large
molecules (EB) without limiting the passage of small molecules
(NaFl), indicating an effect of progesterone on the large BBB
opening. This early protection of the BBB by progesterone could
contribute to the reduction of brain edema and hemorrhages,
which are two main complications leading to the early death in
stroke patients (De Vries et al., 1997; Gasche and Copin, 2003). This
effect on BBB could also contribute to the observed improvement of
the functional recovery and to the reduction of the early mortality.
Indeed, the BBB leakage results in (1) brain edema formation,
which participates to the worsening of the behavioral deﬁcits, (2)
hemorrhagic transformation, which contributes to the premature
death, and (3) polymorphonuclear neutrophil inﬁltration, which
increases the inﬂammatory response and aggravates the ischemic
lesion (Aronowski et al., 1997; Jiang et al., 2009; Strbian et al., 2007;
Wong et al., 2013).
Intranasal progesterone oleogel treatment reduced also postischemic lesion and increased neuronal density in both, the periinfarct and the infarct, compared to placebo treated mice. This
suggests that progesterone treatment results in tissue preservation,
probably by limiting neuronal death. After intranasal progesterone
treatment, larger number of neurons survive in the peri-infarct but
interestingly also in the core of the infarct, probably due to the
lower levels of corticosterone and the effect of progesterone on the
inﬂammatory response and apoptosis (Gibson et al., 2005;
Grossman et al., 2004; Sayeed and Stein, 2009; Si et al., 2014;
Zhang et al., 2010). The preservation of larger number of neurons
may explain in part the observed functional outcomes improvement, evaluated by neurological score and on Rotarod test.
Until now, the neuroprotective effects of progesterone after
stroke were performed by administrating progesterone intraperitoneally and/or subcutaneously. Progesterone was either dissolved
in water, oil, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or with the aid of 2hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin. Our current study is the ﬁrst to
investigate the effect of a progesterone formulation in oleogel (M et
P Pharma) delivered intranasally. According to STAIR's recommendation, preclinical evaluation of a new treatment strategy must
fulﬁll different criteria: a route which better mimics what is feasible
and practical in clinical settings in addition to being non-invasive,
fast and with few side effects.
For steroids, systemic administration is common in clinical
practice, but shows rapid elimination. Oral administration is noninvasive, but with the ﬁrst pass effects requires micronised form
and high doses, is inﬂuenced by food and gastrointestinal residence, and has a slow onset of action. Intranasal delivery is an ideal
route of administration that satisﬁes STAIR's criteria. This administration route allows to target the brain and in certain cases favors
speciﬁc brain regions (Ducharme et al., 2010). Numerous biological, formulation and device related factors determine the therapeutic potential of nasal drug application. Although mechanism
and dependencies of the drug transport are not yet clearly understood, there is some hint that certain drugs can be directly
transported from the nasal cavity to the central nervous system via
the olfactory neuro-epithelium and trigeminal nerve system. Besides, drugs may also be quickly absorbed into circulation due to

the large absorption area and sufﬁcient blood supply of nasal
mucosa and then transported to the central nervous system
(Dhuria et al., 2010; Lochhead and Thorne, 2012; Pires et al., 2009).
Furthermore and interestingly, intranasal delivery of progesterone
seems to decrease stress, as shown by the relatively low corticosterone levels.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that the intranasal drug
delivery could be used in different experimental models of CNS
diseases including stroke (De Souza Silva et al., 2008; Ducharme
et al., 2010; Z. Liu et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2011; Van den Berg et al.,
2004). Furthermore, intranasal delivery of drugs in humans is
either under evaluation in clinical trials or already used for therapeutic purposes (Illum, 2004; Lochhead and Thorne, 2012; Pires
et al., 2009). Concerning testosterone for example, the effects of a
fast-acting testosterone nasal spray on the fear reactions of young
men to two distinct anxiety challenges will be tested (University of
Texas at Austin, clinical trial NCT02361190) and the commercial
launch of Natesto™ (EndoPharmaceuticals), a nasal gel for testosterone delivery indicated for replacement therapy in males
suffering from hypogonadism, is planned for March 2015.
In summary, our study show that intranasal administration of
progesterone in oleogel is efﬁcient to deliver progesterone to
plasma and brain after MCAO and that the amount of progesterone
that reaches the brain is sufﬁcient to decrease mortality rate and to
provide neuroprotection after MCAO. Thus, due to its pharmacokinetic characteristics and practical advantages intranasal delivery
appears to be an appropriate strategy to be developed for therapeutic use of progesterone for stroke.
