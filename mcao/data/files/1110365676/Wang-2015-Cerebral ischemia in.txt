Recent evidence has shown that an increase in CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells may contribute
to stroke-induced immunosuppression. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie this increase
in Treg cells remain unclear. Here, we used a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model in mice
and speciﬁc pathway inhibitors to demonstrate that stroke activates the sympathetic nervous system,
which was abolished by 6-OHDA. The consequent activation of b2-adrenergic receptor (AR) signaling
increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) level in bone marrow. b2-AR antagonist prevented the upregulation
of PGE2. PGE2, which acts on prostaglandin E receptor subtype 4 (EP4), upregulated the expression of
receptor activator for NF-jB ligand (RANKL) in CD4+ T cells and mediated the increase in Treg cells in
bone marrow. Treatment of MCAO mice with RANKL antagonist OPG inhibited the increase in percent
of bone marrow Treg cells. PGE2 also elevated the expression of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase in
CD11C+ dendritic cells and promoted the development of functional Treg cells. The effect was neutralized
by treatment with indomethacin. Concurrently, stroke reduced production of stromal cell-derived factor1 (SDF-1) via b3-AR signals in bone marrow but increased the expression of C-X-C chemokine receptor
(CXCR) 4 in Treg and other bone marrow cells. Treatment of MCAO mice with b3-AR antagonist
SR-59230A reduced the percent of Treg cells in peripheral blood after stroke. The disruption of the
CXCR4–SDF-1 axis may facilitate mobilization of Treg cells and other CXCR4+ cells into peripheral blood.
This mechanism could account for the increase in Treg cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and progenitor
cells in peripheral blood after stroke. We conclude that cerebral ischemia can increase bone marrow
CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells via signals from the sympathetic nervous system.

1. Introduction
Accumulating evidence suggests that regulatory T cells are key
immunomodulators after ischemic stroke and may contribute to
post-stroke immunosuppression and infectious complications, such
as pneumonia (Chamorro et al., 2007; Dirnagl et al., 2007; Liesz et al.,
2009; Meisel et al., 2005; Offner et al., 2006; Prass et al., 2003).
However, few studies have investigated the cellular and molecular
mechanisms of ischemic stroke-induced immunosuppression.
It has recently become clear that peripheral tolerance and
immune homeostasis are largely maintained by immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, such as CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ regulatory T

(Treg) cells (Wing and Sakaguchi, 2010). Treg cells exert
immune-modulating effects by either direct contact with the
suppressed cell or release of immunosuppressive cytokines, such
as transforming growth factor (TGF)-b, interleukin (IL)-10, and
IL-35 (Sakaguchi et al., 2008; Wing and Sakaguchi, 2010). Evidence
from clinical trials and from preclinical studies that used the
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model showed that
stroke causes marked elevations in the number of Treg cells in
peripheral blood and spleen (Offner et al., 2006; Yan et al., 2009).
Treg cells decrease T cell activation and reduce production of interferon-c (c-IFN), one of the most important factors for preventing
bacterial infections (Liesz et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2011; Mahic
et al., 2006; Offner et al., 2006). Therefore, Treg cells are thought
to be strongly associated with stroke-induced immunosuppression
(Offner et al., 2006, 2009). However, the cellular and molecular
mechanisms that underlie the stroke-induced increase in Treg cells
are largely unknown.

J. Wang et al. / Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 43 (2015) 172–183

Treg cells comprise at least two subpopulations: inducible Treg
(iTreg) cells and natural Treg (nTreg) cells (Sakaguchi et al., 2008;
Wing and Sakaguchi, 2010). nTreg cells are produced in the
thymus and released into peripheral blood. iTreg cells are induced
in the periphery from naive T cells, mainly CD4+CD25 T cells
(Sakaguchi et al., 2008; Wing and Sakaguchi, 2010). Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and its product prostaglandin (PG) E2 play important
roles in mediating the generation of iTreg cells in the ultravioletirradiated mouse and tumor models (Mahic et al., 2006; Sharma
et al., 2005; Soontrapa et al., 2011). In the ultraviolet irradiation
model, PGE2 acts on prostaglandin E receptor subtype 4 (EP4),
leading to elevated levels of receptor activator for NF-jB ligand
(RANKL) in the epidermis (Loser et al., 2006; Soontrapa et al.,
2011). RANKL and its receptor, RANK, upregulate CD205 expression
in dendritic cells (DCs) (Loser et al., 2006). CD205+ DCs directly
utilize endogenous TGF-b to induce the differentiation of
CD4+CD25 into CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells (Yamazaki et al., 2008).
However, it is well known that RANKL is produced mainly by bone
marrow cells, including osteoblasts, stromal cells, and activated T
cells (especially for CD4+ lymphocytes), in response to immune
stimulation (Vernal et al., 2006). EP4 is also mainly expressed in
lymphocytes (Tilley et al., 2001). Interestingly, bone marrow
increases the production of PGE2 in response to lipopolysaccharide-induced brain inﬂammation via b2-adrengenic receptor (AR)
signaling (Inoue et al., 2003). Moreover, stroke signiﬁcantly
increases the number of bone marrow CD4+ T cells (Denes et al.,
2010). Therefore, we asked whether bone marrow can generate
iTreg via PGE2–EP4–RANKL signaling after stroke.
Treg cells express CXCR4 receptor and are retained in bone marrow by the CXCR4-SDF-1 axis (Zou et al., 2004). Under homeostatic
conditions, cyclical signals from the sympathetic nervous system
(SNS) act via b3-ARs to reduce bone marrow SDF-1 and maintain
low levels of CXCR4+ hemopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs)
in peripheral blood (Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2008). It is well known
that cerebral infarct increases the number of HSPCs and Treg cells
in peripheral blood (Chang et al., 2011a; Paczkowska et al., 2005).
However, it is still unclear whether ischemic stroke enhances the
mobilization of CXCR4+ cells such as Treg cells and HSPCs from
bone marrow into peripheral blood via SNS signaling.
Although studies have shown that stroke might mediate the
increase in Treg cells, and bone marrow can be a priming site for
immune response and generation of Treg cells (Feuerer et al.,
2003; Sakaguchi et al., 2008), no study has examined the mechanisms involved. We hypothesize that stroke induces activation of
the SNS, which further activates speciﬁc signaling pathways
downstream and mediates the generation of Treg cells. In the
current study, we focused on the molecular regulation of bone
marrow Treg generation and its role in immunosuppression after
stroke. We found that stroke-induced activation of the SNS
mediated the increase in bone marrow Treg cells and enhanced
the mobilization of Treg cells via b2-AR and b3-AR signaling
pathways, respectively, and that the Treg cells aggravated bacterial
loads in lung.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Male C57BL/6 mice (25–30 g, 12–14 weeks old; Animal
Experimental Center of Zhengzhou University) were used for the
study. Animals had free access to food and water and were
maintained under temperature-, humidity-, and light-controlled
conditions. All animal procedures were performed under an
appropriate Home Ofﬁce License and adhered to regulations as
speciﬁed in the Animals (Scientiﬁc Procedures) Act (1986).

173

2.2. Surgical procedures
C57BL/6 mice were subjected to transient MCAO as described
previously but with some modiﬁcation (Jin et al., 2013). In brief,
mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 4%
chloral hydrate. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.6 °C
throughout the surgical procedure by means of a feedbackregulated water-heating system. The right common carotid artery,
external carotid artery, and internal carotid artery were exposed
through a midline neck incision. A 6.0 monoﬁlament nylon suture
with silicone-coated tip was introduced into the origin of the
external carotid artery and advanced through the internal carotid
artery to block the origin of the middle cerebral artery. The
monoﬁlament was left in place for 45 min until reperfusion.
Successful MCAO was deﬁned as P80% decrease in cerebral blood
ﬂow conﬁrmed by laser-Doppler ﬂowmetry (moorVMS-LDF, Moor
Instruments Ltd., UK). In sham-operated animals, the ﬁlament was
advanced along the internal carotid artery until the origin of the
middle cerebral artery and was withdrawn immediately.
2.3. Bone marrow and peripheral blood cell analysis
Bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were
collected as previously described (Wang et al., 2013). The mice
were sacriﬁced after a sublethal intraperitoneal injection of 4%
chloral hydrate. Then, their femurs and tibias were aseptically
dissected and both ends cut. Bone marrow was ﬂushed out with
500 lL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Blood samples were
collected into heparinized tubes and centrifuged. The supernatant
was frozen for later measurement of SDF-1 and PGE2 by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The bone marrow and
peripheral blood cells were depleted of red cells by hypotonic lysis,
resuspended in PBS, and subjected to density-gradient centrifugation (260g, 26 min) in 1.083 g/mL Histopaque 1.083 (Sigma–
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The mononuclear cell layer was
collected from the gradient interface and washed with DMEM
F12 in three consecutive steps of 6-min centrifugation and
resuspension.
2.4. Flow cytometry
The collected mononuclear cells were resuspended in PBS supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide
(FACS buffer), incubated for 10 min with anti-CD4-FITC (Miltenyi
Biotec, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany) or anti-CD11C-PE (Miltenyi
Biotec), and stained for 30 min at 4 °C with one or more of the following antibodies: allophycocyanin (APC)–conjugated anti-CD25
(Miltenyi Biotec), phycoerythrin (PE)–conjugated anti-CXCR4
(Miltenyi Biotec), PE–conjugated anti-RANKL (BD Biosciences,
USA). For intracellular IDO and FoxP3 staining, we used a BD
Cytoﬁx/Cytoperm Kit (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Next, for
IDO detection, we used rabbit anti-mouse IDO (1:200, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for the primary antibody and
goat anti-mouse-APC–conjugated antibody (1:200) for the secondary antibody. For FoxP3 detection, APC–conjugated anti-FoxP3
(Miltenyi Biotec) was used directly. Isotype-matched antibodies
and unstained cells were used as negative controls. Data were
collected on a FACScan 4-color, 2-laser ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences and Cytek Development, Fremont, CA) with CellQuest
software (BD Biosciences) and were analyzed with the FlowJo
software package (TreeStar, Ashland, OR, USA).
2.5. Western blot analysis
Bone marrow cell extracts were prepared in ice-cold RIPA lysis
buffer containing 1 PMSF and 1 phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
(Beyotime, China). After centrifugation, the supernatant of each

174

sample was collected, and the protein concentration was determined in triplicate using the protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, USA). Equal
amounts of protein (20–50 lg) per lane were separated on 4–12%
SDS–polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. Proteins were
transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA). Membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat milk
in PBS – 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Next,
membranes were incubated with one of the following primary
antibodies: polyclonal rabbit anti-CXCR4 (1:400, ProteinTech
Group, USA), polyclonal rabbit anti-COX-2 (1:600, ProteinTech
Group), polyclonal rabbit anti-SDF-1 (1:600, Santa Cruz), polyclonal rabbit anti-RANKL (1:600, Santa Cruz), polyclonal rabbit
anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 1:600, Santa Cruz), polyclonal
rabbit anti-IDO (1:600, Santa Cruz). These antibodies were diluted
in PBS/0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) containing 1% bovine serum albumin
at 4 °C. Loading volumes were normalized against anti-GAPDH peroxidase (1:1,000, Zhixian Biotech, Hangzhou, China). Membranes
were washed with PBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit–horseradish
peroxidase, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) diluted 1:800 in 6%
nonfat milk/PBST for 2 h at room temperature. Protein bands were
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence ECL kit (Beyotime,
China) and detected on a ChemiScope 3400 Mini (Clinx Science
Instruments Co., Ltd, China). Target protein levels were normalized
against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
levels and expressed as relative fold changes compared to the naïve
group.
2.6. ELISA
We measured the concentrations of secreted SDF-1 and PGE2 in
the bone marrow supernatants (100 lL per sample) and of c-IFN in
plasma in triplicate using the appropriate ELISA kits (R&D systems,
USA) (Petit et al., 2002).
2.7. Drug administration
All drugs were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.), intravenously
(i.v.) or subcutaneously. Control animals were injected with the
corresponding vehicle at the same time. RU486 (glucocorticoid
receptor inhibitor; Sigma–Aldrich) was dissolved in ethanol/
sesame oil solution and administered 24 h, 5 h, and immediately
before MCAO (30 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) (Prass et al., 2003).
6-Hydroxydopamine HBr (6-OHDA; Sigma–Aldrich) was dissolved
in sterile 0.01% ascorbic acid/saline and injected 3 days before
MCAO (200 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) (Prass et al., 2003). Phentolamine (a-adrenergic receptor blocker; Sigma–Aldrich) was
dissolved in saline and administered 6 h before MCAO (0.2 mg/kg
body weight, i.v.) (Hagendorff et al., 1998). Propranolol (nonselective b-adrenergic receptor inhibitor; Sigma–Aldrich) was dissolved
in 0.9% saline and administered 8 h, 4 h, and immediately before
MCAO and 4, 8, 24, and 48 h after MCAO (30 mg/kg body weight,
i.p.) (Prass et al., 2003). Butoxamine (selective b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist; Sigma–Aldrich) was dissolved in PBS and injected
at 12 h and immediately before MCAO and then 1 day after MCAO
(25 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) (Lucin et al., 2009). SR59230A
(selective b3-adrenergic receptor antagonist; Sigma–Aldrich) was
dissolved in PBS and administered twice on the day before MCAO
(5 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) (Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2008).
Indomethacin (selective COX-2 inhibitor; Sigma–Aldrich) was
dissolved in drinking water and administered based on daily water
consumption to reach a target of 2.5 mg/kg per day (Soontrapa
et al., 2011). Treatment of mice with indomethacin began 3 days
before MCAO. L-161,982 (selective EP4 antagonist; Sigma–Aldrich)
was dissolved in PBS and administered once daily for 4 days
before MCAO (10 lg per mouse, i.p.) (Soontrapa et al., 2011).

Osteoprotegerin/Fc (OPG/Fc) chimera from mouse (RANKL inhibitor; Sigma–Aldrich) was injected subcutaneously at a dose of
10 mg/kg, three times per week beginning 7 days before MCAO
(Weinstein et al., 2011).
2.8. Bacteriological analysis
The mice were anesthetized and then washed with 70% ethanol
under sterile conditions. The lungs were removed after thoracotomy and homogenized. For determination of colony-forming units,
100 lL of tissue homogenate was serially diluted, plated onto
blood agar plates (Merck), and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. An
investigator blinded to experimental conditions counted the
bacterial colonies.
2.9. Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± SD. Differences among multiple
groups were assessed with 1-way ANOVA followed by the
Bonferroni post hoc test for multiple comparisons. Differences
were considered signiﬁcant at P < 0.05. All data were analyzed with
SPSS Statistics 13.00.
3. Results
3.1. Ischemic stroke increases the level of PGE2 and Treg cells but
reduces the production of SDF-1 in bone marrow by signaling from
activated SNS
The SNS innervates bone marrow and can mediate profound
changes in bone marrow during conditions of stress (Dutta et al.,
2012; Lucin et al., 2009). To determine the inﬂuence of stroke on
bone marrow, we ﬁrst assessed the dynamic activity of the SNS.
Western blot showed that the level of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH,
the rate-limiting enzyme that determines the production of
norepinephrine [NE] in sympathetic ﬁbers) (Dutta et al., 2012)
was signiﬁcantly increased at 6 h after stroke (n = 6/time point,
6 h, days 1, 3: P < 0.05; Fig. 1A and B), indicating activation of the
SNS. Expression had returned to baseline on day 7. The CXCR4SDF-1 axis plays a key role in retaining bone marrow cells (Petit
et al., 2002). The disruption of this axis leads to migration of bone
marrow cells to the periphery (Petit et al., 2002). To test the inﬂuence of stroke on the CXCR4–SDF-1 axis, we ﬁrst examined the
concentration of SDF-1 in bone marrow. Western blot results
showed that bone marrow SDF-1 was signiﬁcantly lower in MCAO
mice than in sham-operated mice at 6 h after ischemic stroke,
reached the lowest mean value on day 3, and persisted at low
values for at least 7 days (n = 6/time point, 6 h, days 1, 3, 7:
P < 0.05; Fig. 1A and C). ELISA results conﬁrmed those of Western
blot (Fig. 1F). Western blot also showed that stroke signiﬁcantly
increased the level of CXCR4 in total bone marrow on days 1 and
3 compared to that in sham-operated mice (n = 6/time point, days
1, 3: P < 0.05; Fig. 1A and D). CXCR4 was restored to the baseline
level on day 7 after stroke. PGE2 is an important immunomodulator and can be secreted by bone marrow cells (Porter et al., 2013).
Expression of COX-2, the rate-limiting enzyme for synthesis of
PGE2, was signiﬁcantly higher in bone marrow of MCAO mice than
in that of sham-operated mice at 6 h, peaked at day 1, and
remained elevated for at least 7 days after stroke (n = 6/time point,
6 h, days 1, 3, 7: P < 0.05; Fig. 1A and E). Quantitative analysis of
PGE2 by ELISA further supported the results observed in the
Western blot (Fig. 1G).
Bone marrow contains various immune cells, including CD4+ T
cells and Treg cells; 1–2% of bone marrow mononuclear cells are
CD4+ T cells (Price and Cerny, 1999). In naïve mice Treg cells

accounted for 13.2 ± 2.8% of all CD4+ T cells in bone marrow and
5.2 ± 1.8% of all CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood (n = 6, P < 0.05;
Fig. 1H–K), consistent with previously published data (Chang
et al., 2011; Offner et al., 2006; Yan et al., 2009). Sham-operated
mice exhibited a slight decrease in Treg cells in bone marrow
within 3 days, but the percent of Treg cells was not signiﬁcantly
different from that of naïve mice (n = 6/time point, days 1, 3, 7:
P > 0.05; Fig. 1H and J). However, stroke disrupted the homeostasis
and caused a modest reduction in the percent of Treg cells on day 1
(n = 6; P < 0.05) and a signiﬁcant elevation in the fraction of CD4+
T cells that were Treg cells in bone marrow on days 3 and 7
(n = 6/time point, days 3, 7: P < 0.05; Fig. 1H and J). The percent
of Treg cells in peripheral blood also was signiﬁcantly elevated
on days 1, 3, and 7 after stroke (n = 6/time point, days 1, 3, 7:
P < 0.05; Fig. 1I and K), consistent with recent data from stroke
patients and experimental animals (Chang et al., 2011; Yan et al.,
2009).
Experimental stroke induces systemic immune changes via the
hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) and the SNS (Chamorro et al.,
2012). 6-OHDA, which ablates SNS innervations, and the glucocorticoid receptor inhibitor RU486 were used to conﬁrm whether the
HPA axis mediates the changes in bone marrow after stroke. RU486
had no effect on the levels of SDF-1 (Fig. 2A–C), CXCR4 (Fig. 2D and
E), COX-2 (Fig. 2D and F), PGE2 (Fig. 2G), or Treg cells (Fig. 2H–K) in

bone marrow after stroke (n = 6, P > 0.05). However, 6-OHDA signiﬁcantly increased the level of SDF-1 (Fig. 2A–C) and reduced
the production of CXCR4 (Fig. 2D–E), COX-2 (Fig. 2D, F), PGE2
(Fig. 2G), and Treg cells (Fig. 2H–K) in bone marrow (n = 6;
P < 0.05). The results suggest that the changes in bone marrow
are mainly mediated by the SNS rather than the HPA.
3.2. SNS signals regulate Treg cells and PGE2 via b2-AR and SDF-1
production through b3-AR
The results described above indicate that stroke causes changes
in bone marrow through SNS signaling. However, NE released from
the SNS can act on a- and b-ARs. Therefore, we examined which AR
subtype mediates the increase in percent of Treg cells and
expression of COX-2. We ﬁrst used phentolamine to block a-ARs.
Treatment of mice with phentolamine had no effect on COX-2
expression or the percent of Treg cells, (n = 6, P > 0.05; Fig. 3A, C,
G and H). In contrast, treatment of mice with the nonselective
b-AR antagonist propranolol markedly reduced bone marrow
COX-2 expression and the percent of Treg cells compared to that
in vehicle-treated mice (n = 6, P < 0.05; Fig. 3A, C, G and H). Previous studies have shown that SDF-1 level in bone marrow is controlled by b-AR signaling under homeostasis (Méndez-Ferrer
et al., 2008). Therefore, we used butoxamine (selective b2-AR

middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and blockade of the SNS (6-OHDA) or HPA (RU486). One group of MCAO mice and one group of sham-operated mice were treated

antagonist) and SR59230A (selective b3-AR antagonist) to identify
which receptor subtype primarily mediates these changes. Treatment of MCAO mice with butoxamine reduced the production of
COX-2 and the percent of Treg cells in bone marrow but did not
affect SDF-1 level (n = 6, P < 0.05; Fig. 3A–C, E, G and H).
Conversely, SR59230A inhibited the reduction in bone marrow
SDF-1 but had no effect on COX-2 or Treg cells (n = 6, P < 0.05;
Fig. 3A–C, E, G and H). Quantitative analysis of PGE-2 and SDF-1
by ELISA supported the results observed on Western blot (Fig. 3D
and F). Taken together, these results suggest that the changes in
PGE2 and percent of Treg cells are mediated by b2-AR signaling
and that the change in SDF-1 levels is mediated by b3-AR.
3.3. The PGE2-EP4 signaling pathway plays a key role in mediating the
increase in bone marrow Treg cells after stroke
Our data indicate that stroke induces the increase in PGE2 production and the percent of Treg cells. To test the relationship
between PGE2 and Treg cells in bone marrow, we treated mice
with the selective COX-2 inhibitor indomethacin. Indomethacintreated mice exhibited signiﬁcantly fewer Treg cells in bone

marrow than did vehicle-treated mice (n = 6, P < 0.05; Fig. 4A and
B). To verify whether EP4 receptor signaling plays a role in regulating the percent of Treg cells, we administered the EP4-selective
antagonist L-161,982 to MCAO mice. Notably, injection of
L-161,982 signiﬁcantly prevented the increase in Treg cells after
stroke (n = 6, P < 0.05; Fig. 4A and B). Under normal conditions,
CD11C+ DCs express little IDO. It has been shown that the upregulation of IDO in CD11C+ DCs promotes functional development of
Treg cells but does not affect the generation of Treg cells (van
der Marel et al., 2007). Flow cytometry results showed that IDO
production in CD11C+ DCs was signiﬁcantly upregulated at 6 h
after stroke, peaked on day 3, and persisted at high levels for at
least 7 days (Fig. 4C and D). Treatment of mice with indomethacin
for 3 days inhibited the expression of IDO (Fig. 4C and D), indicating that PGE2 mediates this upregulation of IDO in CD11C+ DCs
after stroke. However, L-161,982 did not alter IDO expression in
CD11+ DCs, suggesting that EP4 signaling does not mediate the
increase in IDO expression. Taken together, our results show that
PGE2 promotes the generation of bone marrow Treg cells via EP4
signaling and that the upregulation of IDO may contribute to the
immunosuppressive function of Treg cells.

3.4. PGE2-EP4 signaling mediates the increase in percent of Treg cells
via RANKL signaling in bone marrow CD4+ T cells after stroke
Soontrapa et al. (2011) recently reported that PGE2–EP4 signaling mediates the ultraviolet-induced increase in number of Treg
cells through upregulation of RANKL expression in the epidermis.
To verify whether PGE2–EP4–RANKL signaling also mediates the
increase in bone marrow Treg cells, we ﬁrst investigated RANKL
production in the bone marrow. Western blot results showed that
the bone marrow RANKL expression was strongly upregulated at
6 h after stroke compared to that in sham-operated mice, peaked
on day 1, and persisted at high levels for at least 7 days (n = 6/time
point, 6 h, days 1, 3, 7: P < 0.05; Fig. 5A and B). To verify the effect
of PGE2–EP4 signaling on RANKL production, we treated MCAO
mice with indomethacin or L-161,982. Blockade of PGE2–EP4 signaling markedly inhibited the production of RANKL in bone marrow (n = 6, P < 0.05; Fig. 5C and D). It is well known that RANKL
is mainly expressed by lymphocytes, especially CD4+ T cells in
bone marrow in response to immunostimulation (Kong et al.,
1999; Loser et al., 2006). Therefore, we used ﬂow cytometry to test
RANKL production in CD4+ T cells from MCAO mice. We found that

RANKL production in CD4+ T cells was signiﬁcantly elevated at 6 h,
peaked on day 1, and remained high for at least 7 days after stroke
(n = 6/time point, 6 h, days 1, 3, 7: P < 0.05; Fig. 5E and G). These
data suggested that stroke activated CD4+ T cells and elevated
RANKL level in bone marrow through PGE2–EP4 signaling. To further determine the relationship between increased RANKL and
Treg cells in bone marrow, we pretreated MCAO mice with the
RANKL antagonist OPG/Fc. Flow cytometry showed that OPG-treated mice had signiﬁcantly fewer Treg cells in bone marrow than
did vehicle-treated mice on day 3 after MCAO (n = 6/time point,
days 3, 7: P < 0.05; Fig. 5F and H). Taken together, these ﬁndings
suggest that the PGE2–EP4–RANKL pathway can mediate the
increase in Treg cells in bone marrow, consistent with its reported
role in the ultraviolet model (Soontrapa et al., 2011).
3.5. SNS decreases bone marrow SDF-1 level and enhances the
mobilization of Treg cells from bone marrow to peripheral blood after
ischemic stroke
Previous work has suggested that the CXCR4–SDF-1 axis plays
an important role in controlling the migration of Treg cells. We

used ﬂow cytometry to further investigate changes of CXCR4 in
Treg cells after stroke. The expression of CXCR4 in Treg cells was
signiﬁcantly increased on days 1 and 3 after MCAO (n = 6,
P < 0.05; Fig. 6A and B). Pretreatment with 6-OHDA, but not
RU486, signiﬁcantly reduced the expression of CXCR4 on CD4+
FoxP3+ Treg cells (n = 6, P < 0.05; Fig. 6A and B), suggesting that
the SNS mediates the increase in expression of CXCR4 in Treg cells.
Pretreatment of MCAO mice with SR59230A (selective b3-AR
antagonist) had no effect on the percent of Treg cells in bone marrow but decreased the percent of Treg cells in peripheral blood
(Fig. 6C), suggesting that decreased bone marrow SDF-1 enhances
the mobilization of Treg cells to peripheral blood after stroke.
3.6. Bone marrow Treg cells contribute to immunosuppression after
stroke
The mortality of MCAO mice reaches a peak of 57% on day 6
after stroke, and the main cause of death is considered to be
pulmonary infection (Meisel et al., 2004). In addition, 6-OHDA or
b2-AR blockade is able to reduce the bacterial load in lung. To
determine whether Treg cells contribute to immunosuppression
in the delayed phase after stroke, we evaluated the bacterial load
in lung of MCAO mice on day 7 after stroke by using b3-AR inhibitor
SR-59230A and RANKL inhibitor OPG. Analysis of lung homogenate
showed that SR-59230A or OPG-treated mice had signiﬁcantly
lower bacterial loads than did vehicle-treated mice, suggesting

that bone marrow Treg cells may contribute to immunosuppression after stroke (Fig. 6D and E). The concentration of c-IFN in
plasma signiﬁcantly increased in SR-59230A and OPG-treated mice
compared to that in vehicle-treated mice on day 7 after stroke
(Fig. 6F).
4. Discussion
In this study, we show that stroke induces activation of the SNS.
The resulting elevation in TH leads to increased production of PGE2
via b2-AR signaling. Increased PGE2 acts directly on EP4 to mediate
upregulation of RANKL, which plays an important role in regulating
the percent of Treg cells in bone marrow after stroke (Fig. 5F).
Although it has already been reported that bone marrow might
be a priming site for generating iTreg cells, to our knowledge, this
study is the ﬁrst to demonstrate the molecular mechanisms that
underlie this process after stroke. We found that, simultaneously,
stroke leads to a signiﬁcant decrease in the concentration of
SDF-1 via b3-AR signaling and upregulates the expression of CXCR4
in Treg cells and other bone marrow cells. The reduction in bone
marrow SDF-1 facilitates the mobilization of CXCR4+ Treg cells
and HSPCs from bone marrow into peripheral blood, accounting
for the increase in these cells in peripheral blood after stroke
(see Fig. 7).
Bone marrow is innervated by the SNS but is also part of the
lymphocyte recirculation network and a priming site for T cells

in response to blood-borne antigens (Feuerer et al., 2003). Approximately 8–20% of bone marrow mononuclear cells are lymphocytes
(Schirrmacher et al., 2003). Studies in bone metabolism have conﬁrmed that the anti-osteogenic function of leptin, which is
secreted from adipocytes, is mediated by the SNS through b2-AR
signals, suggesting that the SNS can directly control the biologic
function of osteoblasts (Takeda et al., 2002). Mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs) are also innervated by the SNS (Méndez-Ferrer et al.,
2008). MSCs and osteoblasts have the capacity to synthesize and
secrete PGE2. We found that stroke increased the levels of both
COX-2 and PGE2. Treatment with 6-OHDA reduced the level of
PGE2, suggesting that activation of the SNS can promote the secretion of PGE2 in bone marrow. Previous studies have reported that
b2 is the only b-AR expressed in osteoblasts, but MSCs express both
b2- and b3-ARs, and osteoblasts derive from MSCs (Méndez-Ferrer
et al., 2008). Therefore, both b2- and b3-AR signaling can affect the
production of PGE2. Treatment of mice with a selective b2-AR
inhibitor, but not a b3-AR inhibitor, markedly reduced the level
of COX-2/PGE2 in bone marrow, conﬁrming that the SNS directly
enhances synthesis and release of PGE2 via b2-AR signaling.

Prostaglandins have been reported to stimulate expression of
COX-2, suggesting that COX-2/PGE2 expression in vivo is regulated
by a positive feedback mechanism (Obermajer et al., 2011). In our
study, the main mediator of TH returned to normal values on day 7
after stroke; however the production of COX-2/PGE2 persisted at
high levels for at least 7 days after stroke. The positive feedback
mechanism may be responsible for these results.
Treg cells are composed of iTreg and nTreg cells. iTreg cells play
a vital role in mediating immune tolerance or immunosuppression.
Previous reports revealed that iTreg cells, which come from CD4+
CD25 T cells, can be generated in the periphery by prolonged or
repeated antigenic and cytokine stimulation, including PGE2
(Chen et al., 2008; Loser et al., 2006; Obermajer et al., 2011;
Sakaguchi et al., 2008; Sharma et al., 2005; Soontrapa et al.,
2011; Yamazaki et al., 2008). PGE2 is the most abundant prostanoid found in primates. Recent studies have conﬁrmed that PGE2
has strong immunomodulatory effects on the immune system
(Braun et al., 2005; de Visser et al., 2006; Mahic et al., 2006;
Sharma et al., 2005). PGE2 inhibits T cell proliferation through
EP2 receptor signals in a concentration-dependent manner, but

raises the level of IDO in DCs in the presence of TNF-a (Braun et al.,
2005). When unstimulated CD4+CD25 T cells are cultured for
2 days in the presence of PGE2, the expression of FoxP3 increases
3- to 5-fold in a concentration-dependent manner (Mahic et al.,
2006). In our studies, the level of PGE2 in bone marrow increased
rapidly beginning at 6 h after stroke. However, at 24 h after stroke,
the percent of Treg cells in bone marrow was modestly decreased
while the percent of Treg cells in peripheral blood was signiﬁcantly
increased. These results suggest that the total percent of Treg cells
is unlikely to increase. Therefore, PGE2 probably does not mediate
the increase in Treg cells in bone marrow directly.
Studies in bone metabolism have shown that RANKL and RANK
are important regulators of osteoclasts (Ashcroft et al., 2003;
Weinstein et al., 2011). RANKL expression can be upregulated by
bone-resorbing factors, including PGE2 (Hofbauer et al., 2000). In
the immune system, RANKL is highly expressed in activated T cells
(Loser et al., 2006; Vernal et al., 2006), and RANKL cognate receptor
RANK is expressed on DCs (Loser et al., 2006; Soontrapa et al.,
2011). In the ultraviolet irradiation model, PGE2 increased expression of RANKL by acting through EP4 on keratinocytes (Soontrapa
et al., 2011). RANKL–RANK signaling subsequently mediates the
increase in Treg cells in the periphery by increasing CD205 expression in DCs (Yamazaki et al., 2008). It is clear that stroke can induce
activation of lymphocytes and an increase in the number of CD4+ T
cells in bone marrow (Chamorro et al., 2012; Denes et al., 2010;
Meisel et al., 2005). Additionally, RANKL production can be upregulated in CD4+ T cells via exogenous stimulation in vitro and
in vivo (Kong et al., 1999). In our study, we ﬁrst veriﬁed that stroke
signiﬁcantly elevated the level of RANKL, which increased the percent of Treg cells. Treatment of MCAO mice with COX-2 inhibitor or
EP4 antagonist signiﬁcantly reduced RANKL production, suggesting
that PGE2-EP4 signaling mediated the increase in bone marrow
RANKL. Flow cytometry analysis further revealed that CD4+ T cells
are a primary source for RANKL in bone marrow after stroke.
Together with our ﬁnding that stroke increases the production of
PGE2 in bone marrow via b2-AR signals, our results also show that
the SNS can mediate the increase in Treg cells in bone marrow via
PGE2–EP4 signaling on CD4+ T cells.
IDO, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the kynurenine pathway, is mainly present in macrophages and DCs (van der Marel
et al., 2007). During the progress of iTreg development, the IDO
pathway is essential for plasmacytoid DC-driven Treg generation
from CD4+CD25 T cells (Chen et al., 2008). Blockade of IDO does
not affect FoxP3 expression but inhibits the development of functional Treg cells (van der Marel et al., 2007). In our studies, SNS
increased the level of IDO via PGE2 signaling, suggesting that iTreg
generation from the bone marrow microenvironment is functional
and can induce immune tolerance in the periphery.
Under homeostatic conditions, circadian oscillations of SDF-1 in
bone marrow are controlled by the SNS (Méndez-Ferrer et al.,
2008). Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor induces stem cell
mobilization by decreasing bone marrow SDF-1 and upregulating
CXCR4 through activation of SNS (Petit et al., 2002), suggesting that
disruption of the CXCR4–SDF-1 axis has profound inﬂuence on
bone marrow. We found that acute stroke constitutively activates
SNS and leads to elevated expression of TH and NE, which acts
on the b3-AR to inhibit MSC secretion of SDF-1. The resulting
reduction in SDF-1 in bone marrow promotes mobilization of
CXCR4+ cells, including Treg cells, to peripheral blood. Therefore,
disruption in the CXCR4–SDF-1 equilibrium may be responsible
for the alterations in percent of Treg cells in bone marrow and
peripheral blood on day 1 after stroke and for the increase in percent of Treg cells in peripheral blood on day 3 after stroke. A recent
study showed that the SNS negatively regulates the percent of Treg
cells in the spleen. 6-OHDA treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the

181

concentration of NE and increased the percent of Treg cells in
spleen through inhibition of apoptosis (Wirth et al., 2014). However, we and other groups found that stroke-induced SNS activity
not only elevates NE level but also increases the percent of Treg
cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood (Chang et al., 2011).
In fact, the two ﬁndings are not contradictory. An ex vivo experiment showed that NE induces the apoptosis of Treg cells in a
dose-dependent manner via b2-AR signaling; however, a concentration of NE less than 10 4 M did not increase apoptosis of CD4+
CD25+ Treg cells (Wirth et al., 2014). Under steady state conditions,
the concentration of NE in spleen (100 ng/g) is signiﬁcantly
higher than that in bone marrow (1–3 ng/g) and peripheral blood
(<1 lM/L) (Bellinger et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2011). 6-OHDA treatment reduced the concentration of NE to less than 17% and led to
an increase in the percent of Treg cells in spleen (Wirth et al.,
2014), suggesting that an in vivo NE concentration less than
17 ng/g does not induce apoptosis of Treg cells. In our research
and that of others, stroke led to a 2-fold increase of NE in bone
marrow and peripheral blood, but the concentration of NE
remained less than that in spleen after 6-OHDA treatment
(Chang et al., 2011). Therefore, the NE concentration after stroke
does not increase apoptosis of Treg cells. In addition, treatment
of mice after stroke with cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated
transcript downregulated the NE level and simultaneously reduced
the percent of Treg cells in peripheral blood (Chang et al., 2011),
suggesting that increased NE may be responsible for the increase
in percent of Treg cells after stroke, further supporting our ﬁndings.
Stroke can cause immunodepression syndrome, which is characterized by the apoptosis and inactivation of lymphocytes and a
shift from T helper cell (Th)1 toTh2 cytokine production (Meisel
et al., 2004, 2005; Offner et al., 2006; Prass et al., 2003; Wirth
et al., 2014). It has been shown that an approximately 90% reduction in spleen and thymus cell numbers in MCAO mice leads to signiﬁcant atrophy of spleen and thymus (Offner et al., 2006). The lost
components are mainly immune cells, including B cells, T cells, and
natural kill cells (Offner et al., 2006). The loss and deactivation of
lymphocytes may contribute to decreased production of c-IFN
(Chamorro et al., 2012; Wirth et al., 2014), which results in
increased mortality from bacteremia and/or pneumonia (Offner
et al., 2006; Prass et al., 2003; Venet et al., 2009). A recent emerging concept of immunodepression after stroke is the increase in
Treg cells (Chang et al., 2011; Offner et al., 2006, 2009; Yan et al.,
2009). Studies have shown that Treg cells have an immunosuppressive function in cancer, autoimmunity, allergy, trauma, and
infectious diseases, such as pneumonia and sepsis, through cellto-cell contact and/or secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines,
including IL-10 (Dziennis et al., 2011; MacConmara et al., 2006;
Nascimento et al., 2010; Venet et al., 2009; Wing and Sakaguchi,
2010; Zhang et al., 2010). Manifestations of systemic immunodepression are not unique to stroke, as they can also occur after traumatic injury, severe burns, or brain surgery (Chamorro et al., 2012).
These injuries all seem to affect the innate and adaptive immune
responses profoundly. Treg cells promote increased susceptibility
to subsequent bacterial infections by reducing production of
c-IFN in these disorders (MacConmara et al., 2006; Venet et al.,
2009). However, there is no direct evidence to show the relationship between exogenous Treg and immunosuppression after
stroke. We found that inhibiting the increase in bone marrow Treg
cells led to reductions in bacterial load in lung and increases in
plasma level of c-IFN. Together with previous ﬁndings, we conclude that exogenous Treg cells contribute to stroke-induced
immunosuppression by inhibiting the secretion of c-IFN. Although
Liesz et al. showed that depletion of endogenous Treg cells with
anti-CD25 in MCAO mice led to signiﬁcant downregulation of
IL-10 level and upregulation of c-IFN in peripheral blood after

182

stroke (Liesz et al., 2009, 2013), the effect of Treg cells on the
peripheral immune system has not been examined. We are the ﬁrst
to conﬁrm the role of Treg cells in immunosuppression after stroke.
A recent study showed that transfer of Treg cells collected from
inguinal and axillary lymph nodes and spleens of MCAO mice could
not increase the bacterial loads on day 3 after stroke (Li et al.,
2013). The source of Treg cells and time point used may account
for the discrepancy. First, Treg cells derived from bone marrow
are more suppressive than other Treg cells in thymus and spleen
because they express higher levels of FoxP3 and CD25 (Zou et al.,
2004). Second, CD4+CD25+ T cells are not a homogeneous
population; they contain varying numbers of regulatory and nonregulatory T cells (Yagi et al., 2004). Transfer of naïve lymphocytes
or splenocytes into MCAO mice can inhibit the reduction of plasma
c-IFN and prevent pneumonia (Prass et al., 2003). Third, the effect
on the innate and adaptive immune system of deleting or
increasing endogenous Treg cells does not become evident until
3 days after stroke, indicating that endogenous Treg cells may
primarily be involved in immune response during the delayed
phase of stroke (Chamorro et al., 2012; Liesz et al., 2009, 2013).
The major limitation of our study is the use of pharmacological
inhibitors in animals. Although we paid great attention to the
potential side effects of these inhibitors, we cannot exclude
potential systemic effects of these agents beyond their impact on
immune cells in vivo.
In summary, our study reveals novel mechanistic insights into
the generation of bone marrow Treg cells and mobilization of
CXCR4+ cells from the bone marrow to the circulation after stroke.
We show that stroke-induced activation of the SNS mediates the
generation of bone marrow Treg cells by b2-AR-EP4-RANKL signaling. Additionally, we found that bone marrow SDF-1 degradation
by b3-AR signaling and upregulation of CXCR4 in bone marrow
cells facilitate the mobilization of Treg cells and other CXCR4+ cells,
including HSPCs, to peripheral blood. These changes could account
for the increase in Treg cells and HSPCs in peripheral blood after
stroke. Manipulation of these interactions could lead to new
perspectives on the development of improved clinical protocols
for stroke-induced immunosuppression.
