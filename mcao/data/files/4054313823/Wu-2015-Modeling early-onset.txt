Stroke is the leading cause of seizures and epilepsy in the aged population, with post-stroke seizures being a poor
prognostic factor. The pathological processes underlying post-stroke seizures are not well understood and
studies of these seizures in aging/aged animals remain scarce. Therefore, our primary objective was to model
post-stroke seizures in aging mice (C57 black strain, 16–20 months-old), with a focus on early-onset, convulsive
seizures that occur within 24-hours of brain ischemia. We utilized a middle cerebral artery occlusion model and
examined seizure activity and brain injury using combined behavioral and electroencephalographic monitoring
and histological assessments. Aging mice exhibited vigorous convulsive seizures within hours of the middle
cerebral artery occlusion. These seizures manifested with jumping, rapid running, barrel-rolling and/or falling
all in the absence of hippocampal–cortical electrographic discharges. Seizure development was closely associated
with severe brain injury and acute mortality. Anticonvulsive treatments after seizure occurrence offered temporary seizure control but failed to improve animal survival. A separate cohort of adult mice (6–8 months-old)
exhibited analogous early-onset convulsive seizures following the middle cerebral artery occlusion but had
better survival outcomes following anticonvulsive treatment. Collectively, our data suggest that early-onset
convulsive seizures are a result of severe brain ischemia in aging animals.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the most common cause of seizures in the elderly population,
with reported incidences ranging from 3–10% of all stroke cases (Bladin
and Bornstein, 2009; Brodie et al., 2009; Menon and Shorvon, 2009;
Chen et al., 2010; Balami et al., 2011; Gilad, 2012; Guekht and
Bornstein, 2012; Procaccianti et al., 2012; Guth et al., 2014). Post-stroke
seizures are associated with higher mortality rates, prolonged hospitalization, and increased incidences of long-term disability (Waterhouse et al.,
1998; Vespa et al., 2003; Szaﬂarski et al., 2008; Burneo et al., 2010; Huang
et al., 2014). These consequences contribute signiﬁcantly to the socioeconomic burden of stroke, already the greatest amongst all disease in North
America, in addition to the massive personal burden felt by patients and
their families (Smurawska et al., 1994; Zorowitz et al., 2009; Publication
Health Agency of Canada., 2011; Mozaffarian et al., 2015). Speciﬁc
guidelines for the deﬁnitive treatment of post-stroke seizures have yet

to be established but may require a deeper understanding of seizure pathogenesis (Gilad, 2012; Guekht and Bornstein, 2012; Procaccianti et al.,
2012; Kulhari et al., 2014; Sykes et al., 2014).
Early-onset seizures are largely observed within 24 h and are a
medical emergency as life-threatening status epilepticus may follow
(Waterhouse et al., 1998; Waterhouse and DeLorenzo, 2001).
Early-onset seizures can manifest as generalized tonic–clonic convulsions, or non-convulsive seizures which require EEG monitoring for
diagnosis (Silverman et al., 2002; Jordan, 2004; Claassen et al., 2007;
Chung, 2014). Stroke severity and the degree of cortical involvement
have been recognized as risk factors for early-onset seizure development following ischemic stroke (Bladin and Bornstein, 2009; Brodie
et al., 2009; Menon and Shorvon, 2009; Balami et al., 2011; Chen et al.,
2010; Gilad, 2012; Guekht and Bornstein, 2012; Procaccianti et al.,
2012; Chung, 2014). However, the regional initiation and progression
of early-onset seizures are often difﬁcult to assess clinically in patients
with severe brain ischemia. Therefore, it may be of more practical
value to study these phenomena in a viable animal model.
Previous studies have characterized early-onset, non-convulsive
seizures (NCS) in adult rats following a middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO; Hartings et al., 2003; Williams et al., 2004, 2006; Karhunen
et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2009; Cuomo et al., 2013). These NCS were

2

generally observed a few hours following the MCAO with matching
cortical EEG discharges. A link between development of these NCS and
brain injury was established as anticonvulsant treatment reduced both
ischemic injury and acute mortality (Williams et al., 2004, 2006;
Cuomo et al., 2013). Other studies investigated early-onset, convulsive
seizures (CS) in adult animals following brain ischemia (Reglodi et al.,
2000; Wang et al., 2001; Shabanzadeh et al., 2005; El-Hayek et al.,
2011a). However, inconsistencies in the EEG discharges corresponding
to these CS demonstrate a need for further examination. These prior
studies also utilized adult animals exclusively, overlooking aging as
the most important non-modiﬁable risk factor for stroke and its link
to greater brain damage and poor outcomes (Mozaffarian et al., 2015).
While late-onset seizures have been documented in aged rats following
MCAO and photothrombotic ischemia (Kelly, 2006; Karhunen et al.,
2007; Kelly et al., 2001, 2011), very little information remains available
on the behavioral and EEG characteristics of early-onset, post-ischemic
seizures in aging/aged animals. Therefore, for our study, we aimed to
develop a viable model of early-onset, post-MCAO seizures (CS, NCS) in
aging mice in order to characterize the prognostic role of these seizures
and the pathophysiological processes underlying their development.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Animals
Male C57 black mice (C57BL/6; Charles River, Senneville St-Constant,
Quebec, Canada) were used. C57 mice that are ≥24-months-old may
correspond to a human age of approximately ≥70 years (Flurkey et al.,
2007). However, aged C57 mice often encounter many health-related
complications such as skin lesions, ear infections and tumors (Flurkey
et al., 2007). Therefore we chose to conduct our MCAO experiments in
16–20 month-old C57 mice in order to minimize confounding health
complications while effectively modeling brain ischemia in aging animals.
Overall, 89 aging mice were used: 67 animals underwent a MCAO, 15
underwent a sham surgery or occlusion of the common carotid artery
alone (n = 7 or 8), and 7 died during the course of surgery/anesthesia
due to either respiratory suppression or bleeding. A separate cohort of
adult C57 black mice (male, 6–8 months-old, n = 38) were used to
compare the effects of age on early-onset seizures.
The animals were housed in a vivarium that was maintained at
22–23 °C with a 12-hour light on/off cycle. Food and water were
available ad libitum. All experiments detailed were reviewed and
approved by the animal care committee of the University Health
Network in accordance with the Canadian Guidelines for Animal Care.
In line with the guidelines, animals with severe CS were treated with
clinically appropriate anticonvulsants. Mandatory euthanization was
conducted if animals exhibited severe, recurrent CS inadequately
suppressed by anticonvulsant treatments and/or presented in poor
physical condition such as with persistent immobility, lack of eating
and drinking, irresponsiveness to touch, loss of the righting reﬂex,
and/or a substantial reduction in body weight (≥20% of baseline level).
In our study, acute mortality was deﬁned as spontaneous death or
mandatory euthanization within 48 h post-ischemia.
2.2. Intracranial EEG recordings
Electrode construction, implantation and EEG recordings were
conducted as previously described (Wu et al., 2008; Wais et al., 2009;
El-Hayek et al., 2011a,b; Jeffrey et al., 2014). All electrodes were
constructed using polyamide-insulated stainless steel wires (outside
diameter of 200 μm for monopolar electrodes and 125 μm for twisted bipolar electrodes; Plastics One, Ranoake, VA, USA). Monopolar electrodes
were pre-assembled in an array before implantation (Wu et al., 2008).
The tips of the twisted bipolar wires were separated by approximately
100 μm (Jeffrey et al., 2014). EEG recordings were made using a
dual-channel AC microelectrode ampliﬁer with extended headstages

(model 1800, AM Systems, Carlsborg, WA, USA). Signals were collected
in a frequency bandwidth of 0.1–1000 Hz, ampliﬁed 1000 times and
then digitized at ≥5 KHz (Digidata 1300, Molecular Devices; Sunnyvale,
CA, USA). Data acquisition, storage, and analysis were conducted using
pClamp software (version 9 or 10; Molecular Devices).
Monopolar recordings were conducted in the majority of animals
since electrode implantation involved a shorter surgery with minimal
perioperative complications, a particularly important consideration in
more susceptible aging animals (Wu et al., 2008). EEG activity recorded
with monopolar electrodes represented the signal difference between
the recording and reference electrodes. Therefore, this method was
more sensitive to movement artifacts and other remote signals. Twisted
bipolar electrodes were used for local differential recordings in some
animals but the relatively long surgery for implantation was associated
with greater perioperative complications including mortality. EEG
activity in these local differential recordings represented the signal
difference between the tips of the two twisted electrodes. Therefore,
this method was less susceptible to other artifacts or remote signals,
and was preferable for sampling the local circuitry activity.
For monopolar recordings, electrodes were implanted bilaterally
into the hippocampal CA1 (bregma − 2.3 mm, lateral 2.0 mm and
depth 2.0 mm) and parietal cortex (bregma −0.6 mm, lateral 1.5 mm
and depth 1 mm; Franklin and Paxinos, 1997) or unilaterally into the
hippocampal CA3 (bregma: − 2.6 mm, lateral 2.5 mm and depth
3.0 mm) and parietal cortex. For local differential recordings, twisted
bipolar electrodes were implanted bilaterally into the hippocampal
CA3 or into CA3 and the parietal cortex. The locations of the implanted
electrodes were veriﬁed histologically (Fig. 3C, Supplemental Fig. 1).
Most EEG recordings were performed in free-moving animals.
During some EEG recordings, animals were placed in a mouse restrainer
(Type C or D, Canadawide Scientiﬁc, Ottawa, Canada) to limit the
amount of CS-related movement artifacts. Although the restrainers
inhibited vigorous convulsive behavior such as jumping and rapid
running, other characteristic seizure activity such as barrel-rolling,
rapid limb movements, and tail erections remained observable and
analogous to those seen in their unrestrained counterparts.
To quantify EEG changes over time, we used the root mean square
(RMS) of the EEG signals as this has been shown to be a sensitive
measure of ischemic EEG suppression in adult C57 black mice following
hypoxia–ischemia (El-Hayek et al., 2011b). Others have used EEG RMS
to assess brain activities in a rat model of post hemorrhagic seizures
(Klahr et al., 2015). RMS calculations were made from 30-sec EEG
segments collected while animals were immobile as these data segments
were minimally contaminated by movement-related artifacts. Power
spectra were then generated with 50% window overlap at a spectral
resolution of 0.3 Hz. The RMS of the EEG power spectrum was automatically calculated in pClamp.
2.3. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
Animals were anesthetized with 2% isoﬂurane. During surgery, animal
rectal temperatures were maintained between 35.5–36.5 °C via an automatic heating device (DC temperature controller, FHC Inc., Bowdoin,
ME, USA). Permanent and reversible MCAO, referred to as pMCAO and
rMCAO in the following text, were conducted via intra-luminal suture insertion (Durukan and Tatlisumak, 2007; Hossmann, 2008; Howells et al.,
2010; Liu and McCullough, 2011). Each surgery lasted 20–40 min. The
protocol for electrocoagulation of the MCA (MCAO-e) was modiﬁed
from previous studies in adult mice (Liu et al., 2005; Cipriani et al.,
2011; Moyanova et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011).
For the pMCAO, a silicon-coated ﬁne suture (#6, Doccol Corporation,
Redlands, CA, USA) was inserted into the common carotid artery and
advanced through the internal carotid artery with its tip 7–8 mm distal
to the carotid bifurcation (the Koizumi's method; see Durukan and
Tatlisumak, 2007). The common carotid artery and the inserted suture
were then permanently ligated.

C. Wu et al. / Experimental Neurology 271 (2015) 1–12

For the rMCAO, the suture was inserted through the external carotid
artery and advanced through the internal carotid artery (the Longa's
method; see Durukan and Tatlisumak, 2007). After suture placement,
the external carotid artery was temporarily ligated and the skin
wound was loosely sutured. Animals were split into two groups and
were allowed to recover from anesthesia with the suture in for either
45 or 90 min (referred to as the rMAO45min and rMCAO90min group
respectively in the following text). Different durations of occlusion
were utilized to explore the relationship between the duration of
ischemia, reperfusion, and seizure occurrence. The suture was then
withdrawn under isoﬂurane anesthesia and the external carotid artery
was permanently ligated.
For the MCAO-e, animals received a skin incision to expose the skull
between the right ear and eye. A small hole was drilled through the
skull, and the main ascending branch of the MCA was cauterized using
a clinical-grade cautery (Bovie, Clearwater, FL, USA).
Aging mice that underwent either an irreversible ligation of the
common carotid artery or a sham surgery were used as controls. The
sham surgery consisted of surgical exposure of the common carotid
artery in the anesthetized animal, followed by subsequent skin closure.
2.4. Detection of early-onset seizures
Baseline monitoring was performed 1 week after electrode implantation with continuous behavioral and EEG monitoring for up to 6 h.
To detect early-onset seizures following MCAO, animals were placed
under continuous visual surveillance by experimenters with concurrent
EEG recordings for the ﬁrst 4–6 h post-surgery, followed by overnight
video monitoring for an additional 10–14 h. Behavioral and EEG monitoring was resumed the next day and at later serial time points when
permitted by animal survival.
The appearance of vigorous CS were exempliﬁed by rapid running,
jumping, barrel rolling (≥3 turns), falling (loss of righting reﬂex) with
tonic limb ﬂexion, and repetitive tail erection (Supplementary videos 1
and 2). These CS were in keeping with generalized tonic–clonic seizures
described for rodent models in the past (Velíšková, 2006). Previous
studies have reported similar CS in other mouse models (Ivanov et al.,
2004; Muramatsu et al., 2008; Silva-Fernandes et al., 2010; El-Hayek
et al., 2011a). Subtle or ambiguous convulsive behaviors, such as head
nodding, jerking, and/or shaking were not classiﬁed as CS.
Ictal-like EEG discharges were deﬁned as repetitive single-spike or
poly-spike waveforms lasting ≥ 5 s in duration with amplitudes ≥ 2
times that of the background signals (Wais et al., 2009; He et al.,
2009; Jeffrey et al., 2014).
2.5. Anticonvulsive drug treatments
Lorazepam (Ativan) and fosphenytoin (Cerebyx) were obtained in
clinically available injectable forms (Sandoz Canada Inc. and Erfa
Canada Inc., Quebec, Canada). These drugs were diluted in saline and
administered via intra-peritoneal (IP) injections at dosages of
1.5 mg/kg for lorazepam and 30 mg/kg for fosphenytoin (equivalent
to phenytoin 20 mg/kg).
2.6. Brain histology
Brain histological assessments were conducted as previously
described (Wais et al., 2009; He et al., 2009; El-Hayek et al.,
2011a). Animals were anesthetized using an IP injection of sodium
pentobarbital (70 mg/kg) and then transcardially perfused with
10% neutral buffered formalin solution. The brain was removed and
further ﬁxed in 10% formalin with 20% sucrose. Cryostat coronal
sections 30 μm thick were obtained of the entire brain and stained
with cresyl-violet to evaluate gross brain injury at different
post-ischemic time points (Liu and McCullough, 2011) and verify
implanted electrode tracks in their appropriate anatomical locations.

3

The timing of histological processing was dependent on animal survival.
All aging mice with CS were processed at 24–48 h post-ischemia due to
early mortality (or mandatory euthanization) while CS-free aging mice
survived for up to 10 weeks prior to processing. Images were obtained
using a Leica (DMRN) upright microscope and analyzed using Image J
software (National Institute of Health, USA).
To quantify the regions with weak cresyl-violet staining, the brightness and contrast of the Leica microscope captured images were adjusted
to clearly demarcate boundaries. Only regions that were clearly stained
lighter compared to adjacent areas were included for analysis. To assess
ipsilateral edema or atrophy, the area of the ipsilateral hemisphere was
normalized as a percentage of the corresponding contralateral hemisphere at 8 coronal levels (from bregma −3.2 to 1.9 mm; El-Hayek
et al., 2011a). Ipsilateral brain injury, deﬁned as weakly stained areas, or
cavities and scar tissue with visible margins, was also quantiﬁed as a percentage of the total ipsilateral area at the same 8 coronal levels.
2.7. Statistical analysis
Statistical tests were done using the SigmaStat software (Systat Software Inc, San Jose, California, USA). A Student's t-test or Mann–Whitney
Rank Sum Test was used for two group comparisons. For multiple group
comparisons, a one-way ANOVA was used, followed by a multiple
comparison Dunn's test versus baseline control or a Holm–Sidak multiple comparison pairwise test. A Chi-square or Fischer exact test was
used for rate comparisons. Data were presented as mean and standard
error of the mean (SEM) throughout the text and ﬁgures. Statistical
signiﬁcance was set at the level of p ≤ 0.05.
3. Results
Data collected from aging C57 black mice (C57BL/6, 16–20 monthsold) are presented below except where use of adult mice (6–8 monthsold) is speciﬁed. In the following text, ‘ipsilateral’ and ‘contralateral’ are
relative to the unilateral MCAO.
3.1. Behavioral and EEG features of CS and NCS
Vigorous CS (Supplementary video 1) were observed in 8/13 (62%),
12/19 (63%), and 15/27 (56%) aging mice that underwent the pMCAO,
rMCAO90min, and rMCAO45min respectively, but in none of the aging
mice (0/8) that underwent the MCAO-e (Fig. 1A). Neither CS nor NCS
were observed in any control mice following a sham surgery (n = 7)
or occlusion of the common carotid artery alone (n = 8; Fig. 1A).
CS onset was sudden, without any appreciable prodromes. However,
animal handling or moderate auditory stimuli (such as cage disturbance
and hand clapping) could sometimes trigger these CS. CS latency was
measured from termination of surgical suture-insertion to the ﬁrst
spontaneous CS. Of the 35 aging mice with CS post pMCAO/rMCAO, 27
(77%) exhibited their ﬁrst CS within 7–110 min. The mean CS latency
in these animals was 30.1 ± 4.6 min (Fig. 1B). The remaining 8 animals
(23%) exhibited their ﬁrst CS during overnight video monitoring
(Supplementary video 2). Their mean CS latency was 502.1 ±
96.7 min (Fig. 1B).
We recorded EEG signals from bilateral hippocampal–cortical areas
or ipsilateral hippocampal–cortical areas in different animal cohorts to
examine ischemia- and seizure-related forebrain activity. EEG signals
during CS were analyzed in 28 aging mice (2–3 CS per animal) that
underwent either mono-polar (n = 16) or local differential recordings
with twisted bipolar electrodes (n = 12). No hippocampal or cortical
EEG discharges preceding or coinciding with the CS were seen in any
of the 28 animals examined (Figs. 1C, D). However, hippocampal and
hippocampal–cortical EEG discharges during periods of immobility, indicative of NCS (Hartings et al., 2003; Williams et al., 2004, 2006;
Karhunen et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2009; Cuomo et al., 2013), were
observed in 14 aging mice following pMCAO, rMCAO90min, rMCAO45min,

and MCAO-e (n = 2, 3, 7 and 2 respectively; Figs. 1C, D). Mean NCS
latency, measured from the termination of surgery to the ﬁrst
non-convulsive discharge, was 24.4 ± 3.7 min (n = 13; Table 1). One
animal was an outlier with a NCS latency of 300 min. The mean duration
of the NCS was 35.6 ± 4.5 s (measured from 19 hippocampal discharge
events in 14 animals; Table 1). Interestingly, in aging mice with both
NCS and CS following pMCAO or rMCAO, 1–2 NCS always preceded
the ﬁrst CS but did not recur afterwards.
3.2. Development of CS is closely associated with severe brain injury
A positive correlation has been found between EEG signal suppression and the degree of brain ischemia in human subjects (Faught,
1993; Jordan, 2004). Previous work has shown that an early decrease
in ipsilateral hippocampal EEG signal also closely correlates with

ischemic brain injury and CS development in adult mice following an
ischemic insult (El-Hayek et al., 2011b). In aging mice with CS following
pMCAO/rMCAO, post-ischemic EEG signals from the ipsilateral hippocampus were decreased to 41% and 58% of baseline at 1 h (n = 27)
and 24 h (n = 5) respectively, which signiﬁcantly differed from EEG
changes seen in the sham controls (p b 0.05, Figs. 2A, B, E). In CS-free
aging mice, ipsilateral EEG signals were only moderately decreased
following pMCAO/rMCAO to 70% of the baseline at 1-hour postischemia with subsequent recovery to 88% at 24 h (n = 13; Figs. 2C,
E). Similarly moderate decreases were seen in the CS-free aging mice
that underwent MCAO-e (75–80% of sham control levels) at 1 h and
24 h post electrocoagulation (Figs. 2D, E).
Brain histological assessments were conducted in all groups at
different time points. At 24–48 h post-pMCAO/rMCAO, brain injury
was identiﬁable by areas of weak cresyl-violet staining in the ipsilateral

hemisphere, and by a signiﬁcantly increased ipsilateral to contralateral
hemispheric area ratio (Figs. 3C, E). These injury features were observed
in all 13 aging mice that exhibited CS and underwent successful
histological processing. The weakly stained areas predominated in the
rostral to mid coronal planes and affected the striatal, hippocampal,
and lateral cortical sites (Fig. 3C). These areas corresponded to 18–35%
of the total ipsilateral hemisphere across 6 coronal levels (bregma
1.9 mm to − 1.5 mm, n = 9; Table 1). The ratio of the ipsilateral to
contralateral hemispheric area was increased to 108–118% in these
animals (n = 13 aging mice), signiﬁcantly different from the sham
controls (Fig. 3E). This was suggestive of substantial ipsilateral edema
seen in early brain injury. CS-free aging mice (n = 6) did not have any
evidence of cystic infarctions and had ipsilateral to contralateral
hemispheric area ratios comparable to the sham controls when examined 2–5 weeks post-surgery (Fig. 3E). In the MCAO-e group, focal
ipsilateral infarcts were evident in the rostral coronal planes of all 8
aging mice at 8–10 weeks post-surgery (Fig. 3D). The ipsilateral to
contralateral hemispheric area ratio was decreased in these animals at
several coronal levels (Fig. 3E), suggesting ipsilateral atrophy. No
evident brain injuries and no differences between the ipsilateral and
contralateral hemispheric areas were observed in any control mice
(n = 7, 8; Figs. 3A, B, E).

Section 1 of Results) could not be treated in a timely manner. Of these
untreated animals, 5 died immediately after the ﬁrst 1–3 CS
(Supplementory video 2) while the other 3 animals exhibited 7–15
CS throughout the entire duration of overnight video monitoring
and underwent mandatory euthanization the next morning due to
their poor physical condition. This suggests that if left untreated, postischemic CS can cause sudden death or lead to status epilepticus-like conditions in aging animals. In the following text, we use the term ‘acute
mortality’ to denote spontaneous death or mandatory euthanization
within a 48-hour post-ischemic window.
IP injections of lorazepam (1.5 mg/kg) and fosphenytoin (30 mg/kg)
were given to individual animals after two observed CS. The intention of
treatment was to prevent recurrent seizures to potentially improve
CS-induced mortality. The treatment provided temporary seizure
control as CS ceased 4–6 h following treatment but reappeared later
during overnight video monitoring. Despite offering temporary seizure
control, the treatment failed to improve overall animal survival. Of the
27 aging mice treated after two CS, 24 encountered acute mortality
and only 3 survived following rMCAO45min but ultimately either died
spontaneously or underwent mandatory euthanization 9–21 days
later (Table 1).

monitoring, anticonvulsive treatments, and histological assessments were identical to those applied to aging mice. The motor
manifestations of CS were analogous to those seen in aging mice
and were observed in 11/17 (65%), 11/15 (73%), and 3/6 (50%)
adult mice following pMCAO, rMCAO90min, and rMCAO45min respectively (Fig. 4A). The mean CS latency for all adult animals with the
exception of one was 45.6 ± 9.9 min (n = 24). One adult animal
exhibited its ﬁrst CS approximately 7.5 h after the pMCAO
(Fig. 4A). The mean CS incidence and latency did not signiﬁcantly
differ from those documented in aging mice (Table 1). However,
relatively fewer adult mice exhibited their ﬁrst CS during overnight
monitoring (1/25 vs. 8/35, p = 0.067; Table 1). As with their aging
counterparts, no CS or NCS were observed in sham control adult
mice (n = 5; Fig. 4A).

As with aging animals, no hippocampal–cortical EEG discharges
were detected during CS (n = 11) but NCS were evident following
pMCAO/rMCAO (n = 5; Fig. 4B). Mean NCS latency (17.8 ± 5.1 min)
and duration (42.9 ± 4.3 s) did not signiﬁcantly differ from aging
mice (Table 1). Like with aging animals, NCS preceded CS in adult
mice that developed both, and did not recur after the CS.
In adult mice with CS following pMCAO, rMCAO90min, and
rMCAO45min, ipsilateral hippocampal EEG signals decreased to 67% of
baseline at 1 h (n = 11) post-surgery and recovered to 91% at 24 h
(n = 6) (Figs. 4C, D). The early ipsilateral EEG suppression at 1 h was
signiﬁcantly less than that observed in the aging mice (41%, p = 0.01,
Table 1). In CS-free adult animals, ipsilateral EEG signals decreased to
77% of baseline at 1 h with subsequent recovery to 102% at 24 h
(Fig. 4D) post-pMCAO/rMCAO.

Ipsilateral brain injury was seen in 16 adult mice with early-onset CS
that successfully underwent histological processing 24–48 h post
pMCAO/rMCAO. Weakly stained ipsilateral regions were quantiﬁable
in 6/16 adult animals (Fig. 4E), and appeared to be less variable than
those observed in aging mice (Table 1). The ipsilateral to contralateral
hemispheric area ratio was increased to 108–117% at 8 coronal levels
(Figs. 4E, F), similar to increases seen in aging mice (Table 1). In
addition, no histological evidence of gross brain injury was found in

CS-free adult mice following pMCAO/rMCAO (n = 4). The ipsilateral
to contralateral hemispheric area ratio of these animals also did not
differ from their age-matched sham controls (Fig. 4F).
Adult mice (n = 24) were treated identically to the aging mice, with IP
lorazepam and fosphenytoin after two observed CS. Despite temporary
seizure suppression following treatment, 18 animals still encountered
acute mortality while 6 survived for 10–28 days after rMCAO90min and
rMCAO45min (n = 4 and 2 respectively). Gross ipsilateral infarctions

8

were evident in 3 of the 5 surviving animals that underwent successful
histological processing. The acute mortality rate in treated, adult animals
following rMCAO90min was signiﬁcantly lower than their aging counterparts (7/11 vs. 12/12; p = 0.037; Table 1).

4. Discussion
Four main ﬁndings emerged from our study. 1) Aging mice (16–20months-old) are susceptible to early-onset CS development following

C. Wu et al. / Experimental Neurology 271 (2015) 1–12

pMCAO/rMCAO. 2) Development of CS is closely associated with severe
brain injury. 3) CS occurrence is strongly linked to acute mortality, and
while anticonvulsive treatment can transiently suppress seizure genesis,
it does not decrease overall mortality. 4) Compared to aging mice, adult
mice (6–8 months) exhibit morphologically identical early-onset, post
MCAO CS but have better survival when treated following rMCAO90min.

4.1. Modeling early-onset post-ischemic seizures in aging mice
C57 black mice (C57BL/6) are commonly utilized in aging and
neuroscience research (Flurkey et al., 2007). However, the posterior
communicating arteries that connect the posterior cerebral artery and
internal carotid artery territories are often underdeveloped or hypoplastic in this strain. This inherited cerebrovascular defect may contribute to the extensive brain injuries seen in C57 black mice following
periods of global or focal brain ischemia (Fujii et al., 1997; Kitagawa
et al., 1998; Ozdemir et al., 1999; Majid et al., 2003; McColl et al.,
2004; Adhami et al., 2006; El-Hayek et al., 2011a). Since stroke severity
is a risk factor for post-ischemic seizure genesis, this anatomical defect
may have contributed to the higher prevalence of experimental
post-stroke seizures in our model than what has been documented
clinically (Bladin and Bornstein, 2009; Brodie et al., 2009; Menon and
Shorvon, 2009; Balami et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2010; Gilad, 2012;
Guekht and Bornstein, 2012; Procaccianti et al., 2012; Chung, 2014).
We utilized four different MCAO protocols (pMCAO, rMCAO45min,
rMCAO90min, MCAO-e) in order to evaluate the effects of different
durations of ischemia and reperfusion on CS development. The MCAO-e
group was included in order to evaluate the effect of small, focal infarcts
on CS development without the inherent variability of a sutureinsertion method. Although we may have expected to see a lower
incidence of CS in the rMCAO45min group compared to the rMCAO90min
group and the pMCAO group (Barber et al., 2005), there were no signiﬁcant differences in CS incidence between any of the groups in either
aging or adult mice (Table 1). Therefore, the complete cohort was used
in the analysis for both age groups.
The association we established between early-onset CS and acute
mortality is in keeping with post-stroke seizures as a poor prognostic
factor clinically including its association with higher mortality
(Waterhouse et al., 1998; Vespa et al., 2003; Szaﬂarski et al., 2008;
Burneo et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2014). The greater mortality rates in
aging mice compared to adult mice may reﬂect the relative intolerance
of aging/aged animals to ischemic insults and a blunted recovery
response (Popa-Wagner et al., 2011). Aging animals are also more
susceptible to the perioperative complications of the MCAO, including
the use of anesthesia, which may exacerbate ischemic brain injury
leading to poorer physical presentation. Aging animals with CS were
seemingly dichotomized into those with short CS latencies, and a
minority with long CS latencies (Results section 1). This variability
may have arisen due to differences in the severity of the induced
ischemia amongst animals or to documented differences in the susceptibility of different aging animals to anesthesia and surgical procedures
(Liu and McCullough, 2011). Based on our ﬁndings and the corroborating clinical evidence, our model encapsulates key clinical features of
post-stroke seizures that make it potentially viable for future translational studies.

4.2. Development of CS is closely associated with severe brain injury
In our study, severe brain injury was classiﬁed as a decrease in the
ipsilateral EEG signal to ≤50% of the baseline level and/or histologically
evident gross brain injury in the ipsilateral hemisphere (Figs. 2–3). CS
were found to have occurred exclusively in animals with severe brain
injury, as evidenced by widespread ipsilateral edema and loss of
cresyl-violet stained neurons in the pMCAO/rMCAO animals. This is
further supported by the observation that no CS were seen in any
animals from the MCAO-e group where histology showed only small,
focal infarctions without the aforementioned features. Furthermore,
histological evidence of gross brain injury was conspicuously absent in
all CS-free animals. For example, there was no evidence of ipsilateral infarction or atrophy (Fig. 3E) in animals without CS that survived
2–5 weeks following pMCAO/rMCAO. This suggests a potential relationship between both the presence and degree of brain injury to the subsequent development of early-onset CS. Whether the CS themselves
exacerbate brain injury or if the eventual development of severe, ischemic brain injury is a requisite feature for early CS development remain
to be determined.
Signiﬁcant suppression of the ipsilateral EEG signals at 1 h postischemia was closely associated with CS onset in the majority of cases.
Since EEG suppression has been shown to be a sensitive measure of
ischemia (Faught, 1993; Jordan, 2004; El-Hayek et al., 2011a, b), this
ﬁnding implies a close temporal relationship between brain ischemia
and subsequent CS development. Animals with only moderate ipsilateral EEG suppression (Figs. 2C, E) without CS or histological signs of brain
injury may have undergone insufﬁcient brain ischemia. These ﬁndings
together suggest that early-onset CS are a consequence of severe, ischemic brain injury.

4.3. Inﬂuence of CS on acute mortality and the effects of anticonvulsive
drug treatments
Aging mice with CS had a high acute mortality rate despite anticonvulsive treatment. When left untreated, all aging mice with CS died
shortly after or developed a status epilepticus-like condition, eventually
leading to acute mortality. However, CS-free aging mice remained in
acceptable physical condition post-MCAO and survived for several
weeks prior to histological processing. These observations suggest that
early-onset CS development is a major contributing factor to acute
mortality.
Lorazepam and fosphenytoin are recommended for controlling
status epilepticus clinically (Meierkord et al., 2010; Shorvon, 2011).
Lorazepam enhances GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition with lasting
effects while fosphenytoin suppresses excessive activity of voltagegated Na+ channels with less adverse effects than phenytoin. We
combined lorazepam and fosphenytoin in an attempt to control recurrent CS in our animals through the synergistic anticonvulsive effects of
these drugs. However, treatment after CS development only offered
transient seizure control and did not signiﬁcantly improve survival
(Table 1). This phenomenon may be analogous to the refractory nature
of recurrent seizures or status epilepticus-like conditions clinically and
in other animal models (Reddy and Kuruba, 2013). It is also unlikely
that the severe, progressive ischemic brain injury leading to the poor

physical condition of these aging mice can be reversed by anticonvulsive
treatment alone. However, the effects of repetitive anticonvulsive drug
treatments, similar to those used clinically for status epilepticus
(Meierkord et al., 2010; Shorvon, 2011) remain to be evaluated. This
may be accomplished using continuous intravenous infusion or systemic
application through a pump. Whereas repeated dosing may be able to
rescue additional animals, prophylactic or early anticonvulsive treatments
(given prior to the very ﬁrst CS or NCS) may also offer neuroprotection
(Calabresi et al., 2003) in ischemic aging mice and may be a topic worth
exploring in the future.
4.4. Inﬂuence of age on genesis of early-onset post-ischemic CS
We found that the post-MCAO CS observed in aging and adult mice
were similar in regards to motor behavior, incidence, latency, the lack
of associated hippocampal–cortical EEG discharges, and its association
with severe brain injury. These notable similarities suggest that there
may be a common mechanism underlying the development of these
early-onset CS in aging and adult animals. However, both the early
ipsilateral EEG suppression (at 1 h post-ischemia) and the acute mortality rate following rMCAO90min were greater in aging mice than in adult
mice (Table 1). Aging mice were also more likely to demonstrate poorer
physical condition (such as with prolonged immobility or lack of eating
or drinking) following pMCAO/rMCAO and a greater proportion of aging
mice had their ﬁrst CS later on during overnight monitoring compared
to adult mice (Table 1). The decreased tolerance of aging animals to
anesthesia and surgery in addition to an age-related increase in vulnerability to brain ischemia (Liu and McCullough, 2011; Popa-Wagner
et al., 2011) may have contributed to both poorer outcomes and a longer
CS latency in some instances.
4.5. Generation of early-onset CS may involve or affect deeper
subcortical structures
Current clinical evidence has implicated deeper sub-cortical
structures in the pathogenesis of generalized seizures. Seizures and
seizure-like behaviors have been observed in patients with brainstem
stroke (Saposnik and Caplan, 2001; Rollins et al., 2013). Furthermore,
generalized tonic–clonic seizures in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy do not always have corresponding cortical EEG discharges (Schindler
et al., 2007) but tend to correlate with abnormally increased cerebral
blood ﬂow in deeper brain structures, including the brainstem
(Blumenfeld et al., 2009). The role of subcortical structures in seizure
generation and propagation has long been recognized in animal models
(Gale, 1992; Miller, 1992). In particular, CS with rapid running, jumping,
and/or barrel-rolling have been observed in rodent models of brainstem
electrical kindling (Omori et al., 2001; Lam et al., 2010) and audiogenic
seizures during ethanol withdrawal (Yang et al., 2003). In these models,
the CS were thought to involve or affect the midbrain reticular formation, periaqueductal gray matter, and/or superior colliculus based on
local EEG discharges and spike activity. Brainstem areas have also
been implicated in seizure genesis in rats following systemic injections
of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (DeSalvo et al., 2010).
Behaviorally, the CS we observed from both aging and adult mice
resemble the generalized tonic–clonic seizures described in previous
rodent models (Velíšková, 2006; Ivanov et al., 2004; Muramatsu et al.,
2008; Silva-Fernandes et al., 2010; El-Hayek et al., 2011a). Hippocampal
and parietal cortical discharges were absent during all CS regardless of
whether the EEG recordings were made with monopolar or twisted
bipolar electrodes (Figs. 1, 4). This was unlikely due to the limitations
of our EEG recordings since we were able to reliably detect NCS in a
large number of animals using the same recording protocols and technology. In light of the similarities between the post-MCAO CS observed
in our study and the brainstem CS previously observed from other
models (Omori et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2003; Lam et al., 2010), we

suggest that generation of early-onset CS following MCAO may involve
and/or affect deeper subcortical structures.
The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of these CS still
remain unclear. Gross brainstem injury may not be a primary factor
due to the short latency of the CS (mean latencies of 32.8 min and
45.6 min in aging and adult mice respectively). Therefore, CS onset
may precede the development of structural neuronal damage in the
majority of ischemic animals. There was also a conspicuous lack of
gross, histological brainstem injury when examined 24–48 h and
2–5 weeks post-ischemia. In light of observations that tactile handling
or moderate auditory stimuli could trigger CS in ischemic animals, it is
possible that peripheral ascending inputs may facilitate CS generation
when cortical descending inhibition is compromised during early ischemia. Further experiments examining EEG signals in multiple subcortical
areas simultaneously in individual mice, although technically challenging, may reveal the precise regional initiation and subsequent spread of
these early-onset CS.
4.6. Other study limitations
In our study, we did not measure cerebral blood ﬂow to conﬁrm the
success of the MCAO. This was in part due to the technical constraints of
the EEG electrode headset, which physically obstructs the mouse calvarium. Furthermore, an accurate CBF measurement may require animals
to be anesthetized, which would suppress early-onset CS. Instead of
measuring cerebral blood ﬂow, we utilized EEG suppression as a previously validated surrogate measure of brain ischemia (Faught, 1993;
Jordan, 2004; El-Hayek et al., 2011a,b). The reliability of our EEG recordings was validated by the demonstrated ability to detect NCS and to
assess EEG suppression at early post-ischemic time points. However,
there were a group of aging mice that did not have EEG suppression
or histologic evidence of brain injury. These animals may have undergone a technically unsuccessful MCAO due to inappropriate suture
insertion. Further methodological improvements in the MCAO procedure may diminish this underlying variability in the future.
Our study was designed to study the effects of brain ischemia on seizure genesis. Our data were limited in terms of evaluating hemorrhagic
stroke-like events and post-hemorrhagic seizures (Vespa et al., 2003;
Balami and Buchan, 2012; Klahr et al., 2015). The presence of a hemorrhage could not be histologically determined as all animals underwent
cardiac perfusion prior to brain dissection and histological processing.
Therefore, even in the presence of visible ventricular blood in certain
animals, it could not be conclusively determined if the bleeding originated from the MCAO or as a direct consequence of the transcardiac
perfusion. The issue of a potential hemorrhagic component contributing
to early-onset seizures in our model remains to be addressed.
In our study, there was a high acute mortality rate in aging mice
following “successful” pMCAO/rMCAO. While we established a close
relationship between acute mortality and the development of earlyonset CS, the high mortality rate still imposed limitations on several
experimental measures. In particular, the histological assessment of
brain injury was limited by animal survival particularly at later
post-ischemic time points. Therefore, a direct comparison of histological
parameters between aging and adult mice (Table 1) was inconclusive
due to the low sample sizes and resulting high variability within each
group. In addition, the acute mortality of many animals in our study
precludes an adequate examination of late-onset, epileptic seizures
and other chronic behavioral abnormalities in ischemic aging mice.
Further strategies to reduce acute mortality will be needed in order to
assess post-stroke epilepsy and its associated effects on outcome.
5. Conclusion
We describe here a model of early-onset post-ischemic seizures in
aging mice that replicates some common features of clinical post-stroke
seizures. Our data suggest that early-onset CS are a poor prognostic factor

C. Wu et al. / Experimental Neurology 271 (2015) 1–12

and CS generation may involve or affect deeper subcortical structures. Our
study may provide useful information to further elucidate the pathophysiology of these post-stroke seizures such that in the future, more timely
diagnoses and effective interventions may be developed clinically.
