Histone deacetylases (HDACs) constitute a super-family of enzymes grouped into four major classes
(Class I–IV) that deacetylate histone tails leading to chromatin condensation and gene repression.
Whether stroke-induced oligodendrogenesis is related to the expression of individual HDACs in the oligodendrocyte lineage has not been investigated. We found that 2 days after stroke, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and mature oligodendrocytes (OLGs) were substantially reduced in the peri-infarct
corpus callosum, whereas at 7 days after stroke, a robust increase in OPCs and OLGs was observed. Ischemic brains isolated from rats sacriﬁced 7 days after stroke were used to test levels of individual members
of Class I (1 and 2) and Class II (4 and 5) HDACs in white matter oligodendrocytes during stroke-induced
oligodendrogenesis. Double immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that stroke substantially increased
the number of NG2+ OPCs with nuclear HDAC1 and HDAC2 immunoreactivity and cytoplasmic HDAC4
which were associated with augmentation of proliferating OPCs, as determined by BrdU and Ki67 double
reactive cells after stroke. A decrease in HDAC1 and an increase in HDAC2 immunoreactivity were
detected in mature adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) positive OLGs, which paralleled an increase in
newly generated BrdU positive OLGs in the peri-infarct corpus callosum. Concurrently, stroke substantially decreased the acetylation levels of histones H3 and H4 in both OPCs and OLGs. Taken together,
these ﬁndings demonstrate that stroke induces distinct proﬁles of Class I and Class II HDACs in white
matter OPCs and OLGs, suggesting that the individual members of Class I and II HDACs play divergent
roles in the regulation of OPC proliferation and differentiation during brain repair after stroke.

1. Introduction
White matter consists mostly of glial cells and myelinated axons. It comprises about half of the brain volume in humans, and
nearly all cases of ischemic stroke involve white matter (Goldberg
and Ransom, 2003; Liu et al., 2012). Mature oligodendrocytes

(OLGs), the glial cells responsible for CNS myelin formation, are
highly vulnerable to ischemic injury mediated by oxidative stress,
excitatory amino acids, trophic factor deprivation and apoptosis
(Dewar et al., 2003; Pantoni et al., 1996). OLG injury results in
demyelination with subsequent impairment of axonal conduction
(Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2008; McTigue and Tripathi,
2008).
Myelin repair involves the generation of new mature OLGs,
since surviving OLGs after injury are incapable of playing a significant role in remyelination (Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2008;
Keirstead and Blakemore, 1997; McTigue and Tripathi, 2008).
New OLGs are derived from non myelinating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) located throughout the grey and white matter
of the adult brain (Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2008; McTigue
and Tripathi, 2008). New OLGs are generated in the peri-infarct
area in animal models of stroke (Gregersen et al., 2001; Tanaka
et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2010, 2011), however, the molecular

mechanisms underlying stroke-induced oligodendrogenesis have
not been extensively investigated (Zhang et al., 2013).
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) comprise a super-family of enzymes grouped into four major classes (Class I–IV) that deacetylate
speciﬁc lysine residues in histone tails leading to chromatin condensation and gene repression (Jenuwein and Allis, 2001; Kouzarides, 2007). Numerous studies suggest that the functions and
expression proﬁles of HDAC isoforms in oligodendrocytes dynamically respond to the developmental stage, age and health of the
cells. Developmental animal studies revealed that all Class I and
Class II HDAC isoforms exist in the corpus callosum at different
developmental time points up to 24 days postnatally (Shen et al.,
2005). The enzymatic activity of HDACs on nucleosomal histones
was found to be essential for embryonic human and rodent
OPCs differentiation (Conway et al., 2012; Marin-Husstege et al.,
2002; Shen et al., 2005) and systemic administration of valproic
acid (VPA), a non-selective HDAC inhibitor, to rat pups prevented
the differentiation of developing OPCs and resulted in signiﬁcant
hypomyelination (Shen et al., 2005). However, the deleterious
effect of treatment with non-selective HDAC inhibitors on
oligodendrocytes in vivo is temporally restricted and takes
place up to the ﬁrst 10 postnatal days (Shen et al., 2005). Other evidence also suggests that the aging process affects histone acetylation in white matter oligodendrocytes. For example, Shen et al.,
(2008a) found decreased HDAC enzymatic activity in protein
extracts of the corpus callosum of aged mice (8 months old)
compared to young mice (8 weeks old) along with a generalized
age-dependent decrease of Class I and Class II HDACs expression
in OLGs.
Preclinical studies in animal models of stroke showed that inhibition of HDACs provides neuroprotection (Kim et al., 2007; Ren
et al., 2004), stimulates neurogenesis and increases white matter
repair (Kim et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2012). Treatment of adult stroke
rats with VPA increases mature OLG survival by reduction of apoptotic OLG death and augmentation of newly generated oligodendrocytes (Liu et al., 2012). Similarly, two in vitro studies showed
that treatment with HDAC inhibitors preserves mature oligodendrocytes and promotes functional recovery in optic nerves from
young and aged mice after oxygen and glucose deprivation
(OGD) (Baltan, 2012; Baltan et al., 2011). Most of these investigations on HDAC function have been based on non-selective HDAC
inhibitors and their effect on white matter after ischemia. The
HDAC family has only recently started to be addressed individually, and emerging data suggest that individual HDACs have distinctive biological functions in oligodendrocytes. Single
knockouts of Class I HDAC1 or HDAC2 under the control of Olig1
promoter in mice did not yield obvious developmental defects,
however, double genetic ablation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 blocked
oligodendrocyte differentiation by activation of the Wnt signaling
pathway (Ye et al., 2009). In another study, Wei et al. showed that
transcription factor Nkx2.2 recruits an HDAC1 complex to repress
the myelin basic protein (MBP) promoter in immature oligodendrocytes (Wei et al., 2005). Unlike Class I HDACs, the roles of Class
II HDACs in oligodendrocyte development are still not known (Yao
and Yang, 2011). Other reports investigated roles of individual
Class III and IV HDACs in oligodendrocyte differentiation; Class III
HDAC Sirt2 promotes the differentiation of CG4 oligodendrocytes
(Ji et al., 2011), and knockdown of the Class IV HDAC (HDAC11) reduces myelin gene expression and arrested oligodendrocyte maturation in the same cell line (Liu et al., 2009).
In the present study, using a rat model of focal cerebral
ischemia, we examined the spatial proﬁle of individual Class I
and Class II HDACs in OPCs and mature OLGs in the peri-infarct
white matter. We found that stroke induces diverse changes in
the expression proﬁles of individual Class I and Class II HDACs in
OPCs and OLGs.

2. Material and methods
All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance
with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) of Henry Ford Health System. All efforts were made to
minimize suffering of animals.
2.1. Animal model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
Adult male Wistar rats (3–4 months, 270–300 g) were employed in all experiments. The middle cerebral artery (MCA) was
permanently occluded via an intraluminal vascular occlusion
method modiﬁed in our laboratory (Chen et al., 1992; Zhang
et al., 2009). Brieﬂy, following anesthesia and neck dissection, a
4–0 surgical nylon suture (18.5–19.5 mm) determined by the animal weight, with its tip expanded by heating near a ﬂame, was advanced from the right external carotid artery (ECA) into the lumen
of the internal carotid artery (ICA) to block the origin of the MCA.
Rats (n = 6–8/group) were subjected to MCAO and sacriﬁced at 2,
7 or 14 days after stroke. Sham-operated rats were similarly anesthetized and neck dissection performed without suture
advancement.
2.2. Bromodeoxyuridine labeling
Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a thymidine analog that is incorporated into cells during DNA synthesis, was used for S-phase labeling. Using a cumulative labeling protocol (Zhang et al., 2001), rats
(n = 6–8/group) were injected daily with BrdU (Sigma–Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO), intraperitoneally at 50 mg/kg/day for 2 or 7 consecutive days, starting 24 h after surgery. Animals were sacriﬁced 2
or 7 days after surgery at 2 h after the last BrdU injection. Animals
sacriﬁced at 14 days after surgery were injected daily with BrdU for
7 days starting 24 h after surgery.
2.3. Tissue preparation
Brains were ﬁxed by transcardial perfusion with saline, followed by perfusion and immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains
were cut into seven equally spaced (2 mm) coronal blocks and
embedded in parafﬁn. A series of coronal sections (6 lm thick)
were obtained at the center of the lesion, corresponding to coronal
coordinates for Bregma 1 to +1 mm (Paxinos and Watson, 1986),
and used for immunohistochemistry.
2.4. Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed following standard protocols, as previously described (Liu et al., 2012). The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-Adenomatous Polyposis
Coli (APC [CC-1], 1:20; GWB-D835F1, GenWay, San Diego, CA), a
marker for mature OLGs (Bhat et al., 1996), mouse anti-Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan (NG2, 1:1000; 05–710, Millipore, Billerica,
MA), a marker of OPCs (Ness et al., 2005), mouse anti-BrdU (1:100;
M0744, Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and rabbit anti-Ki67 (1:300; RM9106, Thermo Scientiﬁc, Barrington, IL), markers for proliferating
cells. Class I and Class II HDACs were examined using: rabbit
anti-HDAC1 (1:2000; ab7028, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), rabbit
anti-HDAC2 (1:250; sc-7899, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-HDAC4 (1:50; sc-11418, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit anti-HDAC5 (1:50; sc-11419, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology).
Histone acetylation levels were examined using: rabbit antiAcetyl Histone H3 Lys9/Lys14 (Ac-HH3, 17–615, 1:1200; Millipore)

H. Kassis et al. / Neurochemistry International 77 (2014) 17–23

and rabbit anti-Acetyl Histone H4 Lys12 (Ac-HH4, 06–1352,
1:2000; Millipore). The tissues were incubated with the primary
antibodies listed above and with Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch,
West Groove, PA) or ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, Jackson
ImmunoResearch) conjugated secondary antibodies. Nuclei were
counterstained with 40 ,60 -diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at 1:10000. Negative controls omitting the primary antibody were used to verify that conditions of
the immunostaining did not result in a non-speciﬁc background.
Negative controls for all double immunohistochemistry experiments produced a negative outcome, ensuring that only speciﬁc
signals are detected.
2.5. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) assay
TUNEL for the identiﬁcation of apoptotic cells was performed
using the ApopTagÒ Fluorescein in Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit
(Millipore) following the manufacturer’s manual.
2.6. Image acquisition and analysis
Quantiﬁcation of immunoreactive cells was performed as previously described (Liu et al., 2012). Brain coronal sections were digitized under a 40 objective (BX40; Olympus Optical) using a
three-CCD color video camera (Sony DXC-970MD) interfaced with
an MCID image analysis system. For each immunostaining, three
coronal sections from each rat brain were acquired from the center
of the ischemic lesion at 100 lm intervals. From each coronal section, six ﬁelds of view from the peri-infarct corpus callosum (within 500 lm adjacent to the lesion border) and six ﬁelds from the
contralateral homologeous area of sham and MCAO operated rats
were acquired. Immunoreactive cells were counted on a computer
monitor to improve visualization. The total numbers of immunoreactive cells per mm2 area are presented. The number of rats used
for each statistical analysis is described as n = x/group in all
experiments.
2.7. Statistical analysis
Student’s t test was used when comparing two groups. One-way
ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni tests was used when comparing
more than two groups. Statistical signiﬁcance was set a p < 0.05.
All values are presented as mean ± SE for illustration.
3. Results
3.1. Temporal proﬁle of oligodendrocyte recovery in white matter after
stroke
To evaluate the temporal proﬁle of oligodendrocyte recovery in
white matter after stroke, we examined the proportions of
NG2+ OPCs and APC+ OLGs in the peri-infarct corpus callosum at
2, 7 and 14 days after stroke compared to sham control.
In the normal corpus callosum, NG2+ OPCs had an elongated
shape with long processes, while APC+ OLGs had a round body
and were found in clusters parallel to the orientation of axons.
Compared to sham control, we found a signiﬁcant reduction of
NG2+ OPCs in the ischemic corpus callosum at 2 days after MCAO
(down to 60% of sham), that later increased to 142% and 174%
of sham levels at 7 and 14 days after MCAO (Fig. 1A). Morphologically, NG2+ OPCs at 2 days after MCAO exhibited short processes,
whereas 7 and 14 days after MCAO, NG2+ OPCs displayed multiple
and long processes.

19

To examine the effect of stroke on OLGs, we counted the number of APC+ OLGs, because APC is primarily expressed in the cytoplasm of individual mature OLGs and has been previously used as a
marker of mature OLGs (Bhat et al., 1996). We found a signiﬁcant
reduction of APC+ OLGs in the ischemic corpus callosum at 2 days
after MCAO (down to 36% of sham), that later recovered to 74%
and 91% of sham levels at 7 and 14 days after MCAO (Fig. 1B).
Together, these data show that a robust recovery of oligodendrocytes occurs in white matter after ischemic injury which can be
detected as early as 1 week after stroke.
3.2. Stroke induces OPC proliferation and differentiation in ischemic
white matter
We next examined whether OPC proliferation and differentiation lead to increases in OPCs and mature OLGs after stroke. All
the following measurements were performed on animals subjected
to 7 days of MCAO, because this is the earliest time point among
those we tested (2, 7 and 14 days), when an increase in OPCs and
OLGs was observed (Fig. 1A and B). To examine whether stroke increases proliferating OPCs during brain recovery, ischemic rats
(n = 8) were injected with BrdU for 7 consecutive days starting
24 h after MCAO. All rats used for immunohistochemistry were
sacriﬁced 7 days after induction of MCAO and 2 h after the last
BrdU injection. Double immunoﬂuorescent staining showed that
the numbers of NG2+/BrdU+ cells signiﬁcantly increased in periinfarct corpus callosum at 7 days after stroke (Fig. 1C–E) compared
to the contralateral side, suggesting that stroke induces OPC proliferation. Since cells may reenter the cell cycle and incorporate BrdU
during apoptotic death (Bauer and Patterson, 2005), we performed
TUNEL staining along with BrdU immunostaining to rule out the
possibility that apoptotic processes in OLGs induce BrdU incorporation. We found that BrdU+ and TUNEL+ cells were mutually
exclusive in the ischemic corpus callosum (Fig. 1F), suggesting that
BrdU+ cells represent proliferating cells and not apoptotic cells.
BrdU is incorporated during the S-phase of the cell cycle and
can be passed down to daughter cells following division (Wojtowicz and Kee, 2006). Therefore, to examine whether enhanced
OPC proliferation continues to actively occur a week after stroke,
we measured Ki67 immunoreactivity, a protein that is present during all active phases of the cell cycle (G(1), S, G(2), and mitosis), but
is absent from resting cells (G(0)) (Scholzen and Gerdes, 2000).
Double immunostaining showed that some Ki67+/NG2+ OPCs in
the peri-infarct corpus callosum appeared as doublets (Fig. 1G,
arrowheads) and quantiﬁcation revealed that the numbers of
NG2+/Ki67+ cells were signiﬁcantly increased in the peri-infarct
corpus callosum (Fig. 1G–I) 7 days after stroke. Together, these
data indicate that OPCs continue to actively proliferate in situ a
week after stroke.
Mature OLGs do not proliferate and cell cycle exit is a prerequisite for oligodendrocyte differentiation (Casaccia-Bonneﬁl and Liu,
2003). As expected, double immunoﬂuorescent staining showed
that none of APC+ cells were Ki67+ (Fig. 1J); however, we observed
a signiﬁcantly higher number of APC+/BrdU+ cells in the periinfarct corpus callosum (Fig. 1K–M) 7 days after stroke compared
to the contralateral side. These data suggest that APC+/BrdU+ cells
are newly generated mature OLGs that are likely derived from
proliferating OPCs during the period of BrdU labeling. Taken
together, our data show that stroke induces enhanced OPC proliferation and differentiation in white matter a week after stroke.
3.3. Stroke alters HDAC expression in OPCs and OLGs in peri-infarct
white matter
To examine whether HDACs are involved in stroke-inducedoligodendrogensis, we examined protein levels of individual

members of Class I (1 and 2) and Class II HDACs (4 and 5) in white
matter oligodendrocytes after stroke. We performed double immunoﬂuorescent staining with antibodies speciﬁcally against each

HDAC and against either NG2 or APC to detect OPCs and OLGs,
respectively, in white matter a week after stroke. Immunoreactivity of HDAC1 and HDAC2 was primarily in nuclei, while HDAC4 and

HDAC5 were predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm. Double
immunostaining revealed that stroke markedly increased the numbers of NG2+ OPCs which co-localized with HDAC1, HDAC2, and
HDAC4 immunoreactivity, but did not signiﬁcantly change the
number of HDAC5+/NG2+ cells in the peri-infarct corpus callosum
(Fig. 2A–G). However, stroke signiﬁcantly increased the number of
HDAC2+/APC+ cells, whereas the number of HDAC1+/APC+ cells
signiﬁcantly decreased. Stroke did not signiﬁcantly alter the numbers of HDAC4+ and HDAC5+/APC+ cells (Fig. 2H–N). These data
reveal that stroke induces diverse changes in the expression proﬁles of individual Class I and Class II HDACs in OPCs and OLGs.
3.4. Stroke alters histone acetylation levels in OPCs and OLGs in periinfarct white matter
HDAC activity catalyzes the removal of an acetyl group from
lysine residues of histone tails within nuclear chromatin (Kouzarides, 2007). To investigate whether the observed changes in
expression levels of HDAC isoforms in OPCs and OLGs after stroke
are accompanied by changes in HDAC activity, histone acetylation
levels were assessed. Using double immunoﬂuorescent staining,
we quantiﬁed co-localization of acetylated histone H3 (Ac-HH3)
and acetylated histone H4 (Ac-HH4) immunoreactivity in
NG2+ OPCs and APC+ OLGs. Stroke substantially decreased the
numbers of Ac-HH3 and Ac-HH4 positive OPCs, as well as
decreased the numbers of Ac-HH3 and Ac-HH4 positive OLGs
(Fig. 2O–R) in the peri-infarct corpus callosum. The observed
higher density of Ac-HH3+ and Ac-HH4+ OLGs versus Ac-HH3+ and
Ac-HH4+ OPCs (Fig. 2O–R) is most likely due to the larger number
of OLGs in white matter compared to OPCs. Together, these data
suggest that histone acetylation levels in both OPCs and OLGs in
the white matter are reduced after ischemia.
4. Discussion
In the present study, we show that stroke-induced oligodendrogenesis in white matter is associated with distinct proﬁles of Class I
(1–2) and Class II (4–5) HDACs in OPCs and OLGs, suggesting that
the individual members of Class I and II HDACs could play divergent roles in OPCs and OLGs in response to ischemia during white
matter remodeling. HDAC activity catalyzes the removal of an acetyl group (deacetylation) from lysine residues of histone tails within
nuclear chromatin (Kouzarides, 2007) and favors compaction of
chromatin leading to gene repression (Roth and Allis, 1996). A
crosstalk between extrinsic signals, transcription factors and chromatin modiﬁers (such as HDACs), determine if a progenitor cell
would proliferate and differentiate in response to injury (Li et al.,
2009). Stroke induces oligodendrogenesis in peri-infarct regions
by augmentation of OPC proliferation and promoting OPC differentiation into mature OLGs (McIver et al., 2010; Tanaka et al., 2001,
2003; Zhang et al., 2010, 2011). Whether stroke-induced oligodendrogenesis is related to expression of HDACs has not been examined. The present study shows that stroke induces diverse
changes in the expression proﬁles of individual Class I and Class
II HDACs in OPCs and OLGs. The identiﬁcation via epiﬂurescent
microscopy of Class I HDACs as primarily nuclear, while Class II
HDACs as mainly cytoplasmic in OPCs and OLGs of the peri-infarct
white matter, suggest that Class I HDACs are more likely to participate in epigenetic regulation, while Class II HDACs are more likely
to deacetylate cytoplasmic substrates. However, additional 3D
confocal imaging is required to verify these observations. Class II
HDACs had a lower expression levels and showed less dramatic
changes in white matter OLGs after stroke. Therefore, Class I
HDACs could be more actively involved than Class II HDACs in
mediating stroke-induced oligodendrogenesis. The importance of
histone deacetylation for OPC differentiation has previously been

demonstrated by a large series of experiments (Dewar et al.,
2003; Marin-Husstege et al., 2002). In vitro, selective silencing of
HDAC1 or HDAC2 was found to impair the timely differentiation
of primary OPCs (Shen et al., 2008b). Mice with ablations of both
HDAC1 and HDAC2 genes, but not an individual gene, in the OLG
lineage suppress OPC differentiation into mature OLGs, consequently leading to animal death at postnatal week 2, indicating
that these HDACs play redundant roles in OPC differentiation during development (Ye et al., 2009). Our study shows an association
between substantial increases in Class I HDACs in OPCs and augmentation of proliferating OPCs as determined by BrdU and Ki67
double positive cells after stroke, suggesting a possible role for
these HDACs in regulating OPC proliferation after injury. In
addition, our data show mixed patterns of decrease in HDAC1
and increase in HDAC2 in OLGs, which were associated with an
increase in mature OLGs after stroke. We also found that stroke
increased BrdU positive OLGs that were out of the cell cycle, as
determined by negative Ki67 immunoreactivity. Given that mature
OLGs do not proliferate, these BrdU positive OLGs derive from
OPCs. Thus, our data suggest that in addition to OPC proliferation,
different levels of HDAC1 and HDAC2 mediate OPC differentiation.
Indeed, by downregulation of Sox2, these HDACs promote OPCs to
differentiate into myelinating OLGs (Shen et al., 2008b). HDAC1
and HDAC2 also negatively regulate Wnt and Notch signaling that
inhibit OPC differentiation (Ren et al., 2004; Shen et al., 2008b).
Recruitment of HDAC1 to the myelin basic protein (MBP) promoter
leads to repression of the MBP expression (Wei et al., 2005). MBP is
exclusively expressed by mature OLGs and its expression is mainly
regulated at the transcriptional level (Wei et al., 2003). Together
along with our data, we speculate that upregulation of MBP
expression mediated by a decrease in HDAC1, and suppression of
Sox2 and Wnt and Notch signaling in OPCs mediated by an increase in HDAC2, lead to enhancement of OPC differentiation to
mature OLGs after stroke.
Recent studies have primarily focused on the use of nonselective HDAC inhibitors such as VPA (Liu et al., 2012) to promote
white matter recovery after stroke. These compounds target
multiple classes of HDACs. The present study revealed that
individual HDACs in OLGs and OPCs may play distinctive roles in
inducing oligodendrogenesis during white matter remodeling after
stroke. Therefore, additional mechanistic studies are warranted to
facilitate the development of a more speciﬁc and effective HDACtargeting drug therapy for stroke.
