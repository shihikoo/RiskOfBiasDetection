Abstract 5-Aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) confers neuroprotection in ischemic mice by inhibiting DNA methylation.
Zebularine is another DNA methylation inhibitor, less toxic
and more stable in aqueous solutions and, therefore more biologically suitable. We investigated Zebularine’s effects on
brain ischemia in a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAo) model in order to elucidate its therapeutic potential.
Male Wistar wild-type (WT) rats were randomly allocated to
three treatment groups, vehicle, Zebularine 100 μg, and
Zebularine 500 μg. Saline (10 μL) or Zebularine (10 μL)
was administered intracerebroventricularly 20 min before
45-min occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Reperfusion
was allowed after 45-min occlusion, and the rats were
sacrificed at 24-h reperfusion. The brains were removed,
sliced, and stained with 2 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) before measuring infarct size. Zebularine (500 μg)
reduced infarct volumes significantly (p<0.05) by 61 % from
20.7 ± 4.2 % in the vehicle treated to 8.1 ± 1.6 % in the
Zebularine treated. Zebularine (100 μg) also reduced infarct
volumes dramatically by 55 to 9.4±1.2 %. The mechanisms
behind this neuroprotection is not yet known, but the results
agree with previous studies and support the notion that

Introduction
Stroke is amongst the leading causes of death and morbidity
and affects 15 million individuals annually worldwide. Approximately, one in six people will have a stroke in their lifetime [1], and the risk of having a stroke more than doubles
each decade after the age of 55 [2]. Despite current attention to
stroke-risk factors and preventive treatment, the number of
stroke cases has been increasing in recent decades, probably
due to the aging population [3]. Additionally, strokes are also
increasingly afflicting younger people, especially in developing countries where unhealthy lifestyle habits have taken hold.
The number of people aged 20 to 64 who experience stroke
has increased by 25 % in the past two decades [4]. Considering the loss of life, cost in physical and mental disability, and
subsequent loss of productivity, the need for effective therapeutic interventions of stroke is obvious.
DNA methylation is a heritable, enzyme-induced modification to the DNA structure without alteration of the specific
sequence of the base pairs responsible for encoding the
genome.
DNA methylation is important for controlling the profile of
gene expression and is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase,
an enzyme abundant in the brain [5]. Recent studies have
suggested that DNA methylation is a dynamic event even in
the adult CNS [6]. As a consequence of cerebral ischemia,
significant DNA damage and alterations in gene expression
occur. Previous studies have demonstrated that DNA

Transl. Stroke Res. (2015) 6:296–300

methylation was significantly increased in ischemic striatum
and cortex compared with the respective contralateral tissues
in wild-type mice [5].
5-Aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), a widely used DNA
methylation inhibitor [7, 8], has been shown to inhibit DNA
methylation significantly in wild-type mice when administered intracerebroventricularly before ischemia. It has also
been shown that pharmacological inhibition of DNA methylation by 5-aza-dC confers stroke protection in wild-type mice
[5].
The mechanisms behind are not yet known; however, it
was hypothesized that DNA methylation alters gene expression after ischemia in a way to make tissue susceptible to
injury. Various changes in gene expression are reported to be
induced after ischemia [9].
Therefore, neuroprotection may relate not only to the specific characteristics of delayed neuronal cell death after stroke
but also to ischemia-induced changes in gene expression mediated by DNA methylation.
Besides 5-aza-dC, which has been used in clinical trials,
especially for leukemia treatment [10], Zebularine is another
DNA methylation inhibitor, originally synthesized as a cytidine deaminase inhibitor [11–14]. Zebularine has been shown
to be less toxic and more stable in aqueous solution compared
to 5-aza-dC, while 5-aza-dC is shown to be toxic and unstable
in aqueous solution, which makes it difficult to administer
experimentally and clinically [15].
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of
Zebularine on ischemic stroke, in order to test the potential
of Zebularine for ischemia treatment, and to expand our understanding of DNA methylation’s role on ischemic stroke.

Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
All animal procedures were performed according to the practices of the Swedish Board of Animal Research and were
approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Care and
Use at Linköping, Sweden (Permit number: 8-13). All efforts
were made to minimize suffering.

Animal
A total of 40 male Wistar wild-type (WT) rats at the age of 10–
15 weeks (310–390 g) were used and housed at Linköping
University Animal Department. The rats were kept two in
each cage, with free access to water and standard rodent chow,
and with 12-h light/dark cycles. During the postoperative period, the rats were housed individually.

Drug Administration
The rats were randomly allocated to three treatment groups for
intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration. Ten microliter
of sodium chloride (9 mg/mL) (B. Braun, Germany), 10 μL
of Zebularine (Sigma, Sweden) 100 μg at 50 mg/mL in 9 mg/
mL sodium chloride, or 10 μL of Zebularine 500 μg at 50 mg/
mL in 9 mg/mL sodium chloride was injected into the lateral
ventricle with 50-μL Gastight syringe (Hamilton, Switzerland) and 27G (0.4×60 mm) needle (Mediplast, Sweden).
Injection into the lateral ventricle was performed 20 min before middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). The injections
were performed at the stereotactic coordinates: bregma (B)
−1.3 mm anterior/posterior, (B) −3.8 mm ventral to the brain
surface, and +1.8 mm lateral to midline according to Holm
et al., 2011 [16].
MCAo
Transient focal cerebral ischemia was produced by the middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) procedure as described previously as Ström et al., 2013 [17]. Briefly, rats were anesthetized with isofluorane (Forene®, Abbott, Scandinavia AB,
Kista, Sweden) at 4.5 % for induction and 1.5 % for maintenance in a mixture (30/70 %) of oxygen/nitrous oxide in an
induction chamber. The anesthetized animal was put in supine
position, and after shaving, a 2-cm cervical midline incision
was made. Rat body temperature was maintained between
37.0±0.5 °C with a heating pad (Harvard Homeothermic
Blanket system, Edenbridge, UK) during the entire
experiment.
The common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery
(ECA), and internal carotid artery (ICA) were isolated from
surrounding tissues. CCA and ECA were permanently ligated
with a suture (6-0 silk suture, Vömel, Germany), while ICA
was temporarily clipped with a vascular micro-clip (8-mm
artery clip, Rebstock Instruments Gmbh, Dürbheim, Germany), after which a small incision was made in the CCA. Then a
30-mm 4-0 nylon suture (403756, Doccol, Redlands, CA,
USA) with silicone-coated tip was introduced into CCA, and
micro-clip was removed from ICA. Then filament was advanced up the ICA approximately 18–20 mm until a slight
resistance was felt, indicating correct placement, thereby
blocking the origin of the middle cerebral artery. The filament
was secured by a temporary ligation, then wound was closed,
and the animal was allowed to wake up in individual cage.
After 45 min of ischemia, the rat was re-anesthetized, the
filament was withdrawn and the ligation was permanently
knotted; the wound was sutured again with 6-0 suture. The
rats were let to recover in individual cages with free access to
water and water-soaked food pellets placed in a Petri dish on
the cage floor to promote eating at 25 °C room temperature
until termination of the experiment.

Measurement of the Infarct Volume
At 24 h after reperfusion, rats were anesthetized by carbon
dioxide and sacrificed by a guillotine. The brains were
removed rapidly and were cut into seven coronal sections, each at 2-mm thick with razor blades directed by
a rat brain matrix (RBM-4000, ASI Instrument, Inc.,
Warren, MI).
The sections were stained with 2 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 15 min
at 37 °C. Excess TTC was then drained, and the slices were
scanned (ScanJet 2c, Hewlett-Packard Sweden AB, Solna,
Sweden). The size of infarct area of each TTC-stained section
was measured using a computerized image analysis system
(SigmaScan Pro5). The infarct volume was calculated by multiplying the average infarct area of two adjacent slices with the
thickness of the tissue in between, which then was summed up
to a total infarct volume as described as Ström et al., 2013
[18]. The infarct volume was corrected for edema as follows:
infarct volume × total contralateral hemisphere/total ipsilateral
hemisphere.

Discussion
Statistical Analysis
Tamhane’s post hoc test for unequal variance was performed
on one-way ANOVA analysis (SPSS, Version 22, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) for comparing infarct volumes
of the different treated groups (vehicle, Zebularine 100 μg,
and Zebularine 500 μg). P values <0.05 were considered significant. Data are presented as mean±SEM.

In the present study, we demonstrated that administration of
100 μg of DNA methylation inhibitor Zebularine
intracerebroventricularly 20 min before 45 min MCAo reduced infarct volume dramatically by 55 % compared to
vehicle-treated wild-type rats, and 500 μg of Zebularine reduced infarct volume significantly (p<0.05) by 61 %, compared to that of vehicle-treated wild-type rats.

Infarct Volume (%)

Wistar WT male rats were treated with either saline or
Zebularine (100 μg, 500 μg) intracerebroventricularly
20 min before 45-min MCAo and sacrificed 24 h after reperfusion. Brains were removed, sliced, stained, and scanned,
and infarct sizes were measured (Fig. 1).
Rats treated by 500 μg of Zebularine had mean brain infarction volume of 8.1±1.6 % compared to 20.7±4.2 % in the
vehicle-treated rats representing 61 % reduction (p<0.05)
(Fig. 2).
Rats treated by 100 μg of Zebularine had mean brain infarction volume of 9.4±1.2 % representing 55 % reduction
compared to the vehicle-treated rats (Fig. 2). The overall mortality of the rats randomized for the study was 10 %.
A total of 33 Wistar male rats were included in the study.
Seven animals were excluded, because they died during surgery procedures or after reperfusion (n=4) or because of intracerebroventricular administration failure (n=3).

aza-dC administered intracerebroventricularly 10 min before
30 min MCAo reduced infarct volume by 34 % at 72 h reperfusion, and in 45 min MCAo followed by 48 h reperfusion,
infarct volume was 54 % smaller in the 5-aza-dC-treated wildtype mice compared to vehicle-treated wild-type mice.
Our results support Endres’ study that DNA methylation
inhibition confers neuroprotection in ischemic rats. The mechanisms behind this neuroprotection remains to be firmly
established, but a Zebularine-induced gene regulation by
DNA methylation inhibition [5] is amongst the possibilities.
Zebularine, as a methyl transferase inhibitor, is a known cytidine analogue containing a 2-(1H)-pyrimidine ring, which can
be incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA as a deoxy
base replacing the deoxycytidine [17]. It has been confirmed
that Zebularine exerts its demethylation activity by stabilizing
the binding of DNMTs to DNA, hindering the methylation
and decreasing the dissociation, thereby trapping the enzyme
and preventing turnover [19].
In addition to DNA methylation, histone methylation and
deacetylation have also been linked to gene regulation
[20–24].
Treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor
suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) has been reported
to prevent histone deacetylation in the ischemic brain, which
increased expression of neuroprotective proteins Hsp70 and
Bcl-2 in ischemic brain tissue 24 h after insult in the mouse
brain. Mice injected with SAHA at 25 and 50 mg/kg had
smaller infarct volumes compared with vehicle-treated mice
(28.5 and 29.8 % reduction) [25]. The function of histone
acetyl transferases (HATs) was found to be impaired within
the ischemic brain tissue [25, 26]. The pharmacological inhibition of HDACs during brain ischemia prevented reduction
of histone acetylation due to decreased HAT activity, which
increased neuroprotective proteins expression and was of therapeutic relevance to treatment of postischemic brain damage
[25].
In a study by Lanzillotta et al., neuroprotection was shown
in mice subjected to MCAo and treated with HDAC1-3 inhibitor entinostat (MS-275) [27]. MS-275, by blocking HDAC
activity, enhanced HAT-mediated acetylation of both RelA
and H3 histone. The pharmacological intervention reverted
the unbalanced RelA acetylation occurring during ischemic
insult. Consequently, RelA binding shifted from the proapoptotic gene Bim promoter to the anti-apoptotic gene BclxL promoter. These findings support the notion that a pharmacological intervention affecting the epigenetic machinery regulating gene transcription can reduce postischemic brain damage [27].
5-Aza-CdR treatment has been reported to result in global
decreases in H3K9 dimethylation, an effect that was linked to
its ability to mediate dose-dependent, posttranscriptional decreases in the key enzyme, responsible for this epigenetic
modification, G9A [27]. It indicates that 5-aza-CdR acts to

299

reverse multiple levels of epigenetic repression present on
both DNA and histones, locally and globally, to reactivate
silenced genes, furthering the emerging concept that multiple
layers of epigenetic repression participate in gene regulation
[28].
Studies of epigenetic mechanisms in stroke are still in their
infancy but offers promise for increased understanding of
stroke pathophysiology and of the potential viability of new
strategies for its treatment [29].
We administered Zebularine before occluding the MCA.
Future studies where Zebularine is administered after the brain
infarction has been induced would be even more clinically
relevant.

Conclusions
The present study shows that the DNA methylation inhibitor
Zebularine confers neuroprotection in ischemic rat brains and
provides further support for the hypothesis that DNA methyltransferase contributes to delayed ischemic brain injury.
