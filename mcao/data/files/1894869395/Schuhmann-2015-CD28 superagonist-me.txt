While the detrimental role of non-regulatory T cells in ischemic stroke is meanwhile unequivocally recognized, there are
controversies about the properties of regulatory T cells (Treg). The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of Treg by applying
superagonistic anti-CD28 antibody expansion of Treg. Stroke outcome, thrombus formation, and brain-inﬁltrating cells were
determined on day 1 after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Antibody-mediated expansion of Treg enhanced stroke size
and worsened functional outcome. Mechanistically, Treg increased thrombus formation in the cerebral microvasculature. These
ﬁndings conﬁrm that Treg promote thrombo-inﬂammatory lesion growth during the acute stage of ischemic stroke.

INTRODUCTION
It has been observed for many years that immune cells
transmigrate over the blood–brain barrier into infarcted brain
tissue. This process follows a deﬁned time course, with neutrophils
and macrophages beginning to accumulate in the brain some
hours after stroke, and lymphocytes reaching maximum inﬁltration by approximately day 3.1 While the detrimental role of nonregulatory T-cell subsets in the acute phase of ischemic stroke is
widely accepted,2–4 there is an ongoing debate about the
contribution of regulatory T cells (Treg) to this pathology.4–7
We were able to show that Treg cause microvascular dysfunction
and consequently thrombus formation and secondary infarct
growth in the acute phase after experimental ischemic stroke by
interaction with endothelial cells and platelets.4,8 This interplay
between inﬂammatory processes and thrombus formation has
recently been referred to as ‘thrombo-inﬂammation’.8
Other groups reported secondary deterioration of stroke
volumes and functional outcome in animals 7 days after blocking
of Treg.5 Therefore, the aim of this study was to clarify the impact
of Treg in the acute phase of ischemic stroke by the means
of a superagonistic anti-CD28 antibody (CD28 SA) that leads
to an expansion of pre-existing Treg in the lymphoid organs and
the dissemination of increased Treg numbers in the peripheral
blood.9,10

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Details of the experimental procedure are provided in the
Supplementary Information. The animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the European
Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for
Experimentation and the current ARRIVE guidelines (http://www.
nc3rs.org/ARRIVE). Experiments were approved by legal state
authorities (Government of Lower Franconia).
Ischemia Model
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in 6 to 8-week-old male
C57BL/6, DEREG or Rag1−/− mice by 30-minute transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) as described.3,4,11 Infarct
volumes were calculated from brain slices stained with 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride. The Bederson score and the grip
test score were used to monitor neurologic function.12,13
Expansion of Treg by CD28 SA Treatment in vivo
CD28 SA (clone D665, Exbio, Praha, Czech Republic, 50 μg/mouse)
was applied 3 days before tMCAO (prophylactic application) or
immediately after tMCAO (therapeutic application) by an intraperitoneal injection. MOPC-21 antibody (BioXCell, West Lebanon, NH,
USA) served as control. Regulatory T cells were quantiﬁed by ﬂow

(generated by B Nieswandt, Würzburg, Germany). For quantiﬁcation of occluded vessels hematoxylin–eosin staining was performed (10 μm slices), and the percentage of occluded vessels in
every tenth slice was counted under 40-fold magniﬁcation.

RESULTS
First, we conﬁrmed that CD28 SA treatment leads to an expansion
of Treg in mice (maximum on day 3), as has previously been
described.10 We found a signiﬁcant increase in the relative
numbers of Treg in the blood and lymph nodes of wild-type mice

(Supplementary Figure 1, P o 0.05). In the next step, we ruled out
that the CD28 SA itself inﬂuences the cerebral blood ﬂow,
hemodynamics (heart rate and mean arterial pressure) and the
blood gas analysis (Supplementary Figures 2 and 3, Supplementary Table 1). These ﬁndings exclude that CD28 SA treatment
alters important physiologic parameters that might inﬂuence
stroke outcome and prove that middle cerebral artery occlusion
and reperfusion were sufﬁcient in our model.
Next, we assessed if the increase in Treg numbers before tMCAO
inﬂuences stroke development in wild-type mice. Stroke volumes
on day 1 were signiﬁcantly larger (82.0 ± 35.2 mm3) compared
with wild-type animals that had received isotype control
antibodies (46.5 ± 36.4 mm3, Po 0.05) (Figure 1A). To exclude that
the CD28 SA inﬂuences outcome measures independent of its
boosting effect on the Treg population, we additionally analyzed
Rag1−/− mice that lack lymphocytes. As the CD28 SA had no
impact on stroke volumes (control group: 30.4 ± 2.8 mm3; CD28 SA
group: 37.3 ± 12.5 mm3, P40.05) (Figure 1A) a direct effect of the
CD28 SA on clinical outcome in the absence of T and B cells could
be excluded. Importantly, increased stroke size in the wild-type
mice also translated into worse functional outcome as assessed by
the grip test (values are the median with 25th and 75th
percentiles, respectively, in brackets (control: 3.0 (2.0, 4.5); CD28
SA: 2.0 (0.0, 3.0), P o 0.05), but not in the Bederson score (control:
2.0 (2.0, 3.0); CD28 SA: 3.0 (2.0, 4.0), P40.05) (Figure 1B). Again,
there was no difference regarding behavioral testing between the
treatment groups in Rag1−/− animals (not shown). Moreover,
survival rates on days 1 and 3 were lower in CD28 SA pretreated
animals (Figure 1C). Importantly, treatment with CD28 SA after
tMCAO (therapeutic approach) had no impact on stroke volumes
(Supplementary Figure 4) and functional outcome (not shown)
on day 3.
Rag1−/− mice do not exclusively lack Treg. To rule out the fact
that the detrimental effect of the CD28 SA was at a relevant
portion mediated by other lymphocyte subpopulations apart from
Treg, we introduced the DEREG mouse model. In these mice Treg
can be selectively depleted by the repetitive application of DTX.11
Superagonistic anti-CD28 antibody again signiﬁcantly increased
the numbers of circulating Treg in naïve DEREG mice but not in
Treg-depleted DEREG mice (Supplementary Figure 5). Accordingly,
CD28 SA pretreatment induced signiﬁcantly larger infarctions in
DEREG mice containing Treg, while this was no longer the case in
the group of DEREG mice without Treg (Figure 1D).
In the next step, we analyzed if the increase in peripheral Treg
alters the composition of the cellular inﬁltrate within the ischemic
brain. Indeed, we found more ipsilesional CD4+ cells (Figure 2A,
P o0.01) and neutrophils (Figure 2B, P o0.01) after pre-tMCAO
CD28 SA treatment compared with control animals. A negative
immunostaining control is provided in Supplementary Figure 6.
The fact that CD28 SA treatment not only increased the amount
but also the density of immune cells (Supplementary Figure 7)

9
argues against an unspeciﬁc effect, related for instance to larger
infarct volumes. Nevertheless, data must be interpreted with
caution since brains have not been ﬂushed before sampling in
these experiments. Hence, the total cell numbers obtained here
potentially include a considerable amount of cells derived from
within the brain vasculature.
To conﬁrm that Treg contribute to ischemic brain injury by
boosting ‘thrombo-inﬂammation’,8 we demonstrated a higher
number of occluded brain vessels (Figure 2C, P o 0.05) and
glycoprotein IX-positive platelets (Figure 2D, P o 0.05) in CD28 SApretreated mice compared with control mice. Again, the CD28 SA
also increased the density of occluded vessels (Supplementary
Figure 8). To further analyze the location of Treg in the ischemic
brain during the early phase of stroke, we performed immunohistochemistry of brain specimen taking advantage of genetically
modiﬁed mice, in which Foxp3-expressing cells are visible by a
transgenic construct linking green ﬂuoresecent protein and the
DTX receptor (DEREG mice).4,11 We could show that Treg were
predominantly located within the vessel lumina (Figure 2E) and
did not transmigrate into the brain parenchyma until day 1 after
stroke, which is in line with previous studies.1,4
DISCUSSION
In the present study, with the use of a pharmacologic expansion of
Treg, we independently conﬁrm that Treg are strong potentiators of
acute ischemic stroke.4 Superagonistic anti-CD28 antibodyinduced expansion of Treg positively correlated with increased
stroke size 24 hours after ischemia. In analogy to our previous
study, Treg interact with endothelial cells and platelets to induce
microvascular dysfunction and thrombosis.4 In contrast to our
ancestor study4 and the results of this study—both strongly
arguing for a detrimental role of Treg during the acute phase of
brain ischemia/reperfusion injury—it has been reported that Treg
are key modulators of cerebroprotection in brain ischemia in mice
in the late phase.5 Therefore, it would be worthwhile to study
whether CD28 SA application at later time points inﬂuences stroke
outcome although Treg expansion with CD28 SA after tMCAO had
no impact on the neurological status on day 3 in our hands
(Supplementary Figure 4).
Treg promote stroke progression within a few hours after cessation of cerebral blood ﬂow. At this early stage, they are mainly
found within cerebral blood vessels and interact with endothelial
cells and platelets. This interplay between thrombotic and
inﬂammatory processes has recently been described as ‘thromboinﬂammation’.8 Nevertheless, we also found an increased number
of CD4+ and Ly6B.2+ cells in the brain parenchyma as early as day
1 after tMCAO. While it is well-known that neutrophils start to
transmigrate into the brain within hours after stroke, the
pathophysiologic role of these cells in acute ischemic stroke is
still under debate.1,4,14 Moreover, the mechanisms through which

peripheral Treg expansion by the CD28 SA enhances neutrophil
recruitment to the ischemic brain need to be further established.
One potential explanation could include the formation of a proinﬂammatory milieu triggered by activated T cells present in high
numbers within the brain vasculature and subsequent upregulation of cell adhesion molecules. However, based on the
observation that Treg (and other T cells) trigger ischemic brain
damage already after a few hours after vessel occlusion, it can be
assumed that mechanisms operating mainly within the brainperfusing vessels rather than within the brain parenchyma
contribute to the detrimental T-cell effect to a large extent.2–4
In summary, the present study independently conﬁrms that Treg
promote lesion growth during the acute stage of ischemic stroke.
Short-term inhibition of Treg might become a promising therapeutic approach to combat this devastating neurologic
condition.
