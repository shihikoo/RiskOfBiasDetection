Abstract 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) is a recently
identified potent agonist of tropomyosin-related kinase B
that can cross the blood–brain barrier after oral or intraperitoneal administration. The aim of the present study was
to determine whether 7,8-DHF has neuroprotective effects
against cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury and,
if so, to investigate the possible underlying mechanisms.
Cerebral I/R injury rats were induced by middle cerebral
artery occlusion for 90 min followed by reperfusion for
24 h. 7,8-DHF was administered intraperitoneally at a dose
of 5 mg/kg immediately after ischemia. Our results showed
that 7,8-DHF significantly reduced neurological deficit
scores, infarct volumes, and neuronal apoptosis in brains of
I/R rats. Meanwhile, 7,8-DHF also increased Bcl-2
expression, decreased expression of cleaved caspase-3, Bax
and inducible nitric oxide synthase, and inhibited nuclear
factor-jB activation in ischemic cortex. Finally, malondialdehyde and nitric oxide contents were reduced, but

activities of glutathione, glutathione peroxidase and
superoxide dismutase were restored in ischemic cortex
treated with 7,8-DHF. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that 7,8-DHF is able to protect against cerebral
I/R injury, which may be, at least in part, attributable to its
anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory
actions.

Introduction
Stroke is the second leading cause of mortality and the
most common cause of long-lasting disability in the world.
Population-based studies have estimated that ischemic
stroke constitutes approximately 80 % of all strokes (Feigin et al. 2003; Donnan et al. 2008). Ischemic stroke is
usually characterized by an initial interruption of blood
flow and the subsequent restoration of blood supply and
concomitant reoxygenation, leading to irreversible brain
damages and persistent neurologic dysfunction (Woitzik
et al. 2008). The major pathological mechanisms involved
during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury
include excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation and
apoptosis (Amantea et al. 2009; Broughton et al. 2009; Jin
et al. 2010). So far, thrombolytic treatment with intravenous tissue-plasminogen activator (tPA) remains the only
approved therapy for patients with acute ischemic stroke;
however, the efficacy of this intervention is satisfactory in
only 2–5 % of ischemic patients, primarily caused by the
short therapeutic time window (Kleindorfer et al. 2008).

123

Thus, there is a great need to develop novel and effective
therapeutic strategies for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member
of the neurotrophin growth factor family that plays fundamental roles in neuronal growth, differentiation, and
survival during development and adulthood (Nikolaou
et al. 2006; Numakawa et al. 2010). BDNF interacts with
tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor and elicits
its dimerization and autophoshorylation, thereby leading to
the activation of several important signaling pathways,
such as MAPK, PI3K and phospholipase C-c (Numakawa
et al. 2010). Accumulating evidence indicates that BDNF
has potent neuroprotective effects against various neurotoxic insults (Scharfman and Maclusky 2005). For example, intracerebral infusion of BDNF or transplantation of
mesenchymal stem cells overexpressing BDNF has been
shown to promote functional recovery and reduce infarct
size in permanent or transient cerebral ischemia in rats
(Yamashita et al. 1997; Kurozumi et al. 2004; Nomura
et al. 2005; Chang et al. 2012). It is highly conceivable that
the BDNF-TrkB pathway represents a potential therapeutic
target for these disorders. Unfortunately, clinical trials have
demonstrated that the therapeutic utility of recombinant
BDNF for neurological diseases is relatively disappointing
presumably because of short in vivo half-life, poor delivery
and unable to penetrate the blood–brain barrier (Zuccato
and Cattaneo 2009). Therefore, various small molecule
ligands of the high affinity BDNF receptor, TrkB are
increasingly being pursued as alternative agents for therapeutic options of neurological diseases.
7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) is a small-molecule
flavone derivative that can bind with high affinity and
specificity to TrkB and potently activate downstream signaling cascades (Jang et al. 2010). Recently, 7,8-DHF has
been reported to potentially cross the blood–brain barrier and
imitate certain BDNF actions in learning and memory (Choi
et al. 2010; Jang et al. 2010). Furthermore, systemic
administration of 7,8-DHF results in robust activation of
TrkB in the mouse brain (Jang et al. 2010). Similar to BDNF,
this compound has also been shown to have neuroprotective
effects against excytotoxic and ischemic damages and to
rescue memory impairment in rodent models (Andero et al.
2011; Chen et al. 2011; Devi and Ohno 2012). However,
whether 7,8-DHF possesses the ability to protect brain
against I/R injury has not yet been investigated.
In the present study, we used a rat model of transient
focal cerebral ischemia to determine whether treatment
with 7,8-DHF has neuroprotective effects in reducing
infarct volume and improving neurological deficits and, if
so, to investigate whether the neuroprotective effects are
associated with the inhibition of neuronal apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)
expression.

Materials and methods
Animals and drug
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats, weighing 200–250 g,
were provided by the Experimental Animal Centre of
China Medical University. They were housed in cages and
kept under constant temperature (22 °C) and humidity
(40–50 %) with a 12 h light/dark schedule (lights on from
7 a. m. to 7 p. m.). Tap water and food pellets were
available ad libitum throughout the study. All animals were
allowed one week to stabilize with the laboratory environments before the experimental procedures. Animal care
and handling procedures were carried out in strict accordance with the guidelines approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of China Medical University. 7,8-DHF was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO, USA) and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) for further use.
Transient cerebral ischemia model
Focal cerebral I/R injury was reproduced by the middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) method as previously
described with minor modifications (Longa et al. 1989).
Briefly, rats were anesthetized with 10 % chloral hydrate
(350 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), and their skin was sterilized. The right common carotid artery (CCA), internal
carotid artery (ICA), and external carotid artery (ECA)
were carefully isolated and exposed. A 4-0 monofilament
nylon suture with a heat-blunted tip was inserted from the
ECA lumen to the ICA until faint resistance was felt,
thereby blocking the blood flow of the right middle cerebral artery. After a 90-min occlusion, the filament was
slowly withdrawn to restore the blood flow (reperfusion)
for 24 h. The rectal temperature was maintained at
37.0 ± 0.5 °C with an infrared lamp throughout the surgical procedure. Sham-operated animals underwent the
same procedure, but the filament was not inserted.
Animal groups and administration of 7,8-DHF
Ninety-six rats were randomized into four groups as follows (n = 24 for each group): (1) the sham operation
group, in which the right CCA, ICA, and ECA were
exposed but without occlusion; (2) the sham ? 7,8-DHF
group, in which the sham-operated rats were treated with
7,8-DHF (5 mg/kg in 500 ll DMSO, i.p.) immediately
after the operation; (3) the I/R group, which were given
500 ll DMSO (vehicle) immediately after the occlusion;
(4) the I/R group ? 7,8-DHF, which were given an intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg 7,8-DHF dissolved in
500 ll DMSO immediately after the occlusion. At 24 h

J Mol Hist (2014) 45:129–140

after reperfusion, the animals were euthanized by an
overdose of chloral hydrate, and their brains were rapidly
dissected out for further measurements.
Evaluation of neurological deficits
At 24 h after reperfusion, neurologic deficits were scored
in a blind manner according to a five-point scale as
described by Longa et al. (1989): 0, normal spontaneous
movements; 1, forelimb flexion; 2, turn around into a circle; 3, fall down to the left side; 4, unable to walk spontaneously and depression of conscious.
Assessment of cerebral infarct volume
Following neurological deficit evaluation, the brains were
dissected, chilled in ice-cold saline for 5 min, and sectioned into five consecutive coronal slices. The slices were
stained with 2 % 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC, Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C for 30 min and then fixed
in 10 % formalin neutral buffer overnight. Infarct volume
was calculated as the percentage of infarct volume to
ipsilateral hemisphere volume in the coronal slices.
Histological examination
For histological examination, the brains were immersed in
10 % buffered neutral formalin overnight, processed for
paraffin embedding, and cut into 5-lm sections. The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
following standard procedure and then examined under a
light microscope.

131

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was conducted on 5-lm paraffin
sections using the standard streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) method. Briefly, the tissue sections were
deparaffinized, rehydrated, and microwaved for 10 min in
0.01 mol/L citrate buffer for antigen retrieval. Endogenous
peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating with 0.3 %
hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 15 min. After blocking
with 10 % normal goat serum for 15 min, the sections were
reacted overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit polyclonal antibody
against iNOS (1:50 diluted; Biosynthesis Biotechnology,
Beijing, China), followed by incubation with biotinylated
goat anti-rabbit IgG at 37 °C for 30 min. The bound antibody was detected with streptavidin-HRP conjugate, and
the reaction products were visualized with DAB substrate.
Finally, the tissue sections were counterstained with
hematoxylin.
Immunofluorescence labeling
Following antigen retrieval, endogenous peroxidase and
non-specific binding were inhibited as described above.
The tissue sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C
with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against phosphorylated
TrkB (1:100 diluted; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA),
followed by incubation with a fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-conjugated secondary antibody at 37 °C for
60 min. After nuclei were stained with 40 , 6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI), the sections were examined under a
laser confocal microscopy.

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) staining

Measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione
(GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), superoxide
dismutase (SOD), and nitric oxide (NO)

TUNEL staining was performed using a commercially
available kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After deparaffinization and rehydration, the sections were treated with
cell permeabilization solution (0.1 % Triton X-100) for
8 min on ice. Endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited
with 0.3 % hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 min. Then,
the tissue sections were stained with the TUNEL reaction
mixture containing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
(TdT) and fluorescein-conjugated dUTP at 37 °C for 60 min
in the dark, followed by incubation with converter-PODS
(antifluorescein antibody conjugated with peroxidase) at
37 °C for 30 min. After extensive washing with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS), TUNEL-positive color development
(brown) was achieved using the 3, 30 -diaminobenzidine
(DAB) substrate. At the end, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted.

The ipsilateral cerebral cortex (ischemic core and penumbra) were excised and homogenized in cold PBS (4 °C).
The homogenates were then centrifuged at 3,000g for
15 min, and the supernatants were collected for measurement of GSH, GSH-PX and SOD activities, as well as
MDA and NO contents using colorimetric assays with
commercial kits (Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute,
Nanjing, China). The MDA levels were measured by
monitoring thiobarbituric acid (TBA) reacting substances
with a spectrophotometer at 532 nm. The data are
expressed as nmol/mg protein. The GSH-PX activity was
assayed based on the reaction of reduced GSH to the oxidized form of glutathione GSH in the presence of H2O2.
The SOD activity was determined by measuring its ability
to inhibit nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction due to
superoxide anion generation. The results are reported as
U/mg protein. The NO contents were analyzed using the

and presented as lmol/mg protein.

performed using the SPSS16.0 statistical analysis software
for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). P \ 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Western blot analysis
The total cellular and nuclear extracts were prepared from
the ipsilateral ischemic cortex using a nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extraction kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China) following the supplier’s
recommended protocol. The protein concentrations were
determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay. Equivalent amounts of proteins were fractionated on sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). After blocking
with 5 % (w/v) skim milk, the membranes were immunoblotted overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal antibodies
against Bax, Bcl-2, nuclear factor (NF)-jB (1:400 diluted;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), TrkB (1:
1,000 diluted), phosphorylated TrkB (1: 1,000 diluted; Abcam), iNOS (1:400 diluted) and active caspase-3 (1:1,000
diluted; Biosynthesis Biotechnology). Next, the membranes
were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody at room temperature for 45 min, and the
bands of specific protein on the membranes were visualized
with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Millipore).
b-actin served as a protein loading control.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
EMSA was performed to determine NF-jB DNA-binding
activity by using a commercial kit (Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology). For short, nuclear proteins from the ipsilateral ischemic cortex were incubated with a biotinlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing
the specific recognition sequence for NF-jB (50 -AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-30 ). After incubation at
room temperature for 20 min, the reaction mixtures were run
on a 4 % non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel at 10 V/cm for
60 min, and the protein-DNA complexes were transferred
onto nylon membranes and UV-crosslinked for 10 min.
Finally, the specific biotinylated protein-DNA bands were
developed with HRP-conjugated streptavidin using an ECL
kit. Levels of NF-jB DNA binding activity were quantified
by densitometric analysis.
Statistical analysis
All results are reported as mean ± standard deviation
(SD). The neurological deficit scores were analyzed by
Mann–Whitney U test. All other data were analyzed by
one-way ANOVA, and the Bonferroni post hoc test was
used for multiple comparisons. All statistical analysis was

Results
7,8-DHF enhances phosphorylated TrkB expression
in the cortex
To determine the ability of systemic 7,8-DHF to activate
TrkB in vivo, we examined TrkB and phosphorylated TrkB
levels in the cortex by immunofluorescence labeling and
western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1a, labeling for
phosphorylated TrkB was almost abolished in the cortex of
rats with cerebral I/R injury. Treatment with 7,8-DHF
obviously increased phosphorylation of TrkB in both sham
and I/R rats. Our western blot analysis also confirmed this
finding (Fig. 1b, c). Thus, these results clearly indicate that
7,8-DHF is able to activate TrkB in vivo.
7,8-DHF attenuates cerebral I/R injury in rats
To evaluate the protective effects of 7,8-DHF on cerebral
ischemia in rats, 7,8-DHF (5 mg/kg) was administered via
intraperitoneal injection. At 24 h after reperfusion, neurological scores were assessed using a five-tiered scoring
system, and infarct volumes were measured with TTC
staining. As shown in Fig. 2a, neurological score was zero
in the sham and 7,8-DHF group animals. In contrast,
neurological score of 3.1 ± 0.6 was observed in the vehicle-treated I/R rats. Meanwhile, rats in the sham operated
group had no infract, whereas 90 min MACO and 24 h
reperfusion caused significant infarct (31.9 %) as shown in
TTC-stained coronal brain sections (Fig. 2b, c). Interestingly, the neurological score was significantly improved
and the infarct volume was diminished by 7,8-DHF
administration 24 h after MCAO (P \ 0.01).
H&E staining was performed to detect the histological
alterations in the cerebral cortex after injury. As illustrated
in Fig. 2d, there were little histological abnormalities in the
brains of the sham and 7, 8-DHF group rats, but the MCAO
approach resulted in extensive neuronal damages in the
ischemia core and penumbra, such as neuronal loss, nuclei
shrinkage, and neuronal vacuolization. Administration of
7,8-DHF to the I/R rats significantly protected neurons
from MCAO-induced damages. These results suggest that
7,8-DHF attenuates cerebral I/R injury in rats.
7,8-DHF inhibits I/R-induced neuronal apoptosis in rats
To determine whether 7,8-DHF exerts the neuroprotective
effects through the inhibition of apoptosis, we analyzed

apoptotic status of the ischemia core and penumbra with
TUNEL staining. TUNEL-positive cells were barely seen in
the sham and 7,8-DHF groups, while they were abundant in
the I/R group 24 h after MACO. Number of TUNELpositive neurons was significantly reduced by 7,8-DHF
treatment (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, we measured the

expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax and cleaved caspase-3 in the
ipsilateral ischemic cortex by western blot analysis. The
results revealed that MCAO led to significant up-regulation
of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2
in the I/R rats compared with the sham rats. However, these
expression level changes were markedly reversed by 7,8-

DHF treatment (Fig. 3b, c). Altogether, these data indicate
that 7,8-DHF attenuates cerebral I/R injury probably
through promoting cell survival and inhibiting cell
apoptosis.

7,8-DHF inhibits NO production and iNOS expression
in the ischemic cortex

7,8-DHF inhibits oxidative stress in the ischemic cortex
To test if the inhibition of oxidative stress is involved in the
neuroprotective effects of 7,8-DHF on cerebral I/R injury,
we evaluated MDA content, an indicator of oxidative
stress, and activities of several antioxidant enzymes,
including GSH, GSH-PX and SOD in the ipsilateral
ischemic cortex. As shown in Fig. 4a, after 24 h of reperfusion, MDA levels in the I/R group were significantly
higher than those in the sham group. However, 7,8-DHF
treatment significantly attenuated MDA levels in comparison to those of I/R rats. Furthermore, I/R injury produced a
significant decrease in activities of GSH, GSH-PX and
SOD as compared to the sham group, but treatment with
7,8-DHF remarkably restored the activities of these antioxidants, which protect against oxidative stress (Fig. 4b–
d). Taken together, these observations suggest that 7,8DHF reduces oxidative stress and increases antioxidant
enzyme activity in rats with cerebral I/R injury.

The excessive production of NO by iNOS has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of cerebral I/R injury (ArunaDevi et al. 2010). Therefore, we investigated whether
7,8-DHF suppresses NO production and iNOS expression
in the ischemic penumbra. After 24 h of reperfusion, NO
levels in the ischemic cortex of the ipsilateral hemisphere
were obviously increased in comparison to those of shamoperated rats. However, this increase was attenuated by
7,8-DHF treatment (Fig. 5a, P \ 0.01). Simultaneously,
we also determined the iNOS protein expression in the
ischemic cortex by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Figure 5b shows representative immunohistochemical photomicrographs of iNOS in brain tissues.
Compared with the sham-operated rats, the rats in the I/R
group exhibited a remarkable increase in iNOS reactivity.
However, 7,8-DHF treatment at 5 mg/kg dampened these
changes. Furthermore, western blot analysis showed that
there was a marked increase in iNOS expression in ischemic brain tissues of the I/R group compared with the sham
group (P \ 0.01). 7,8-DHF treatment (5 mg/kg i.p.) significantly decreased iNOS expression in cortex of rats with

findings reveal that the inhibition of NO production and

pathway may be a critical mediator of 7,8-DHF-mediated
protection from cerebral I/R injury.

Discussion
7,8-DHF suppresses the NF-jB pathway
in the ischemic cortex
To delineate the role of the NF-jB pathway in the observed
protective effects of 7,8-DHF on cerebral I/R injury, we
detected activation of NF-jB in the cerebral cortex after
I/R injury. As shown in Fig. 6a, b, nuclear levels of NF-jB
expression were greatly increased in the I/R group
(P \ 0.01); these effects were further dampened by 7,8DHF treatment (P \ 0.05). Similarly, EMSA showed that
elevated NF-jB binding activity was observed in the
ipsilateral cortex at 24 h after reperfusion. However, this
elevation was significantly decreased by 7,8-DHF treatment (Fig. 6c, d). Our results imply that the NF-jB

123

In the present study, we demonstrated that treatment with
7,8-DHF at 5 mg/kg improved neurobehavioral outcomes,
reduced infarct volumes, and inhibited neuronal apoptosis
in rats subjected to MCAO-induced cerebral I/R injury.
Moreover, 7,8-DHF treatment also suppressed oxidative
stress, NO production, iNOS expression, activation of the
NF-jB pathway at 24 h after MCAO injury, suggesting the
possible mechanisms responsible for the neuroprotective
effects of 7,8-DHF against brain I/R injury.
7,8-DHF is a recently identified selective agonist of
TrkB that can cross the blood–brain barrier after oral or
intraperitoneal administration (Jang et al. 2010). Previous
studies have tested 7,8-DHF as a neuroprotective agent in

several neurodegenerative diseases (Andero et al. 2011;
Chen et al. 2011; Devi and Ohno 2012). However, whether
7,8-DHF has neuroprotective effects against cerebral I/R
injury remains unknown. In the present study, our results
showed that intraperitoneal administration of 7,8-DHF
significantly protected against cerebral I/R injury after

MCAO, as evidenced by reductions in infarct area and
improvements in neurological score. Initially, Jang and
colleagues have reported that 7,8-DHF displays a relatively
low cellular 50 % effective concentration (EC50) in survival of primary neurons and robust neuroprotective effects
with a 5-mg/kg dosage in mice (Jang et al. 2010). In

subsequent in vivo studies, this dosage of 7,8-DHF has
been used to investigate its neuroprotective actions in
Alzheimer’s disease and age-related cognitive deficits
(Devi and Ohno 2012; Zeng et al. 2012). Therefore, we
also chose to administer 5 mg/kg 7,8-DHF by intraperitoneal injection in the present experiments, and found potent
neuroprotective effects of 7,8-DHF against brain I/R injury
in rats. Taken together, this low dosage makes it an ideal
candidate to follow up in clinical trials. Meanwhile,
immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis
demonstrated that treatment with 7,8-DHF remarkably
increased phosphorylation of TrkB in the cortex of rats.
These data suggest that systemic administration of the
TrkB agonist 7,8-DHF protected rats against brain I/R
injury through directly activating TrkB receptors.

Neuronal apoptosis is a prominent feature in a variety of
neurodegenerative disorders, such as stroke, Alzheimer’s
disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Mattson 2000;
Friedlander 2003). Several lines of evidence suggest that
apoptosis is also an important mechanism of neuronal death
in the ischemic penumbra after focal cerebral ischemia
(Love 2003; Yuan 2009). In the present study, we observed
an obvious increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells
in the ischemic cortex of vehicle-treated animals. In contrast, this rise in TUNEL-positive cells was significantly
attenuated in 7,8-DHF-treated I/R rats. Our results are
consistent with previous data showing that 7,8-DHF protects lung fibroblast cells, retinal ganglion cells, and primary neurons from hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis
(Zhang et al. 2009; Jang et al. 2010; Gupta et al. 2013).

Caspase-3 is known to be an executioner of programmed
cell death, and caspase-3 activation can lead to DNA fragmentation and subsequently to expansion of infarct volume
in MCAO models of ischemic injury (Guegan and Sola
2000; Luo et al. 2002). The Bcl-2 family is composed of a
number of intracellular proteins that have either pro- (Bax,
Bak, and Bok) or anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Bcl-w)
functional capabilities (Ola et al. 2011). In this study, we
found that 7,8-DHF inhibited caspase-3 activation and Bax
protein expression, but increased Bcl-2 expression in the
ischemic cortex, which may be the molecular mechanism
responsible for 7,8-DHF protection against neuronal apoptosis. Nevertheless, how 7,8-DHF regulates Bcl-2 and Bax
proteins needs further investigations.
Mounting evidence suggests that oxidative stress,
termed as an imbalance between production and elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is involved in the
pathophysiology of brain I/R injury. At high level, ROS
can randomly react with membrane lipids, thereby initiating the lipid peroxidation process and ultimately causing
DNA breakage and neuronal apoptosis (Allen and Bayraktutan 2009). MDA is an end product of lipid peroxidation that has been commonly used to indirectly assess ROS
content (Dib et al. 2002). Additionally, ROS can be scavenged by antioxidant enzymes, such as GSH, GSH-PX and
SOD (Blokhina et al. 2003). Thus, the activity of these
enzymes may be useful in evaluating the antioxidant
enzyme status. In the current study, as shown elsewhere,
I/R injury caused a significant rise in the MDA level and
decrease in GSH, GSH-PX and SOD activity in the cortex,
whereas 7,8-DHF decreased the MDA levels and enhanced
the antioxidant enzyme activities in brain tissues. In fact,
7,8-DHF has been shown to be a potent antioxidant in
hippocampal neuronal cells, oocytes, and retinal ganglion
cells (Gupta et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2011; Choi et al. 2013).
Altogether, our data imply that 7,8-DHF limits cell damages by reducing oxidative stress in brain I/R model.
NF-jB is an important transcription factor involved in
cell survival and inflammation. It has been reported that I/R
injury induces activation of NF-jB, in response to ROS, to
aggravate brain injury through the induction of many proinflammatory mediators, including iNOS (Zhang et al.
2005). In addition, excessive systemic iNOS-derived NO
production has been implicated in cerebral inflammation
and tissue damage caused by ischemic stroke (Toda et al.
2009). More importantly, inhibition of NF-jB activation or
attenuation of iNOS expression and NO production has
been shown to protect brain against ischemic damage
(Zhang et al. 2005; Khan et al. 2004). In our study, 7,8DHF treatment not only suppressed NF-jB nuclear
expression and binding activity, but also reduced NO
content and iNOS expression the ischemic cortex. Our
results concerning the neuroprotective mechanism of 7,8-

139

DHF in brain I/R injury are in part consistent with a previous study demonstrating that 7,8-DHF inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced iNOS expression and NF-jB
activity in RAW264.7 cells (Park et al. 2012). Thus, it is
obvious that the neuroprotective effects of 7,8-DHF in
cerebral ischemia may be associated with the inhibition of
NF-jB activation and iNOS expression.
In conclusion, the present study have unveiled that a
5 mg/kg dose of 7,8-DHF, administered i.p. after the onset
of ischemia, significantly reduced infarct volume and
improved neurological deficit in a rat model of MCAOinduced cerebral ischemia. The neuroprotective effects of
7,8-DHF seem to be at least partly due to its anti-apoptotic,
anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory actions. Our data
suggest that 7,8-DHF holds great potential to be developed
as a neuroprotective agent for stroke therapeutics.
