Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of mortality and permanent disability in adults worldwide. Neurogenesis triggered by ischemia in the adult mammalian brain may provide insights into stroke treatment.
Morroniside is an active component of sarcocarp of C. ofﬁcinalis that have shown neuroprotective effects.
The aim of the present study is to test whether morroniside promotes neurogenesis via Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway for brain recovery in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. Morroniside was
administered intragastrically once daily at the concentrations of 30, 90 and 270 mg/kg for 7 days postischemia. Neurological functions were detected by Ludmila Belayev score tests. Endogenous neural stem
cells responses were investigated with immunoﬂuorescence staining of Ki-67 and Nestin to identify the
neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ). The expression of proteins involved in and related to
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was detected by western blotting analysis. Morroniside signiﬁcantly
promoted neurogenesis for brain recovery 7 days post-ischemia. Increased expression of Wnt 3a,
β-catenin and T-cell transcription factor-4 (Tcf-4), along with activation of downstream transcription
factors Pax6 and neurogenin2 (Ngn2), indicated that the neurorestorative effects of morroniside may be
associated with Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. These data provide support for understanding the
mechanisms of morroniside in neurorestorative effects and suggest a potential new strategy for ischemic
stroke treatment.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the most common
cause of permanent disability in adults worldwide (Navarro-Sobrino
et al., 2011). Despite substantial progress in understanding the
mechanisms of ischemic stroke over the past few decades, there is
still no effective therapy for neurorestorative treatment (Yemisci et
al., 2009). Evidence is accumulating that cerebral ischemia can
stimulate endogenous neurogenesis in the subventricular zone
(SVZ) of adult mammals (Marti-Fabregas et al., 2010; Ohira et al.,
2010). Although the increase of stem cells in the SVZ of the adult

brain may lead to morphological and functional improvements
following ischemic injuries, this internal response is unable to
functionally compensate for the ischemic damage. Thus, there is an
urgent need to search for therapeutic approaches that can augment
endogenous neurogenesis.
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is well known for its important role in nervous system development. In the presence of
Wnt signals, β-catenin is stabilized and translocates to the nucleus,
where it interacts with T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor
(TCF/LEF) family of transcription factors to induce changes in gene
expression (Baarsma et al., 2013; Clevers, 2006). This signaling
pathway has been shown to regulate neurogenesis in the adult
SVZ, by promoting proliferation of progenitor cells (Adachi et al.,
2007). A recent study in focal cerebral ischemic injury model
revealed that treatment with lentivirus expressing Wnt3a-HA into
SVZ enhanced functional recovery from the 2nd day after injury
and increased the number of immature neurons in the striatum

and SVZ (Shruster et al., 2013). The ﬁndings indicate that Wnt
signaling could induce an appropriate neurogenic environment for
neuronal differentiation and survival post-ischemic injury.
Morroniside is an iridoid glycoside extracted from the sarcocarp of Cornus ofﬁcinalis. It has been shown to possess antioxidative and anti-apoptosis activities in vitro and in vivo (Wang
et al., 2008, 2009); moreover, our previous studies have also
demonstrated that morroniside reduces the infarct volume and
promotes neurological functional recovery 3 days after focal
ischemic stroke (Wang et al., 2010). However, the long-term effects
and mechanisms of morroniside against ischemic stroke are not
clear. We hypothesized that morroniside could promote neurogenesis for neurorepair from ischemic injury. In the present study,
we used a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to
identify the effects of morroniside on neurogenesis 7 days postischemia, and to examine whether the Wnt signaling pathway
involved in the neurorestorative mechanism of morroniside.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Morroniside extraction and identiﬁcation
C. ofﬁcinalis was purchased from Tong Ren Tang Company,
Beijing, China, and authenticated by Professor Wen Wang. Morroniside was extracted from the sarcocarp of C. ofﬁcinalis and
puriﬁed as previously described (Wang et al., 2010). The ﬁnal
purity was determined to be 98.5% by high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) analysis.

2.4. Immunoﬂuorescence analysis and immunohistochemistry
analysis.
Immunoﬂuorescence staining was used to visualize Nestin in
the SVZ. After the rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in
PBS, the brains were extracted and post-ﬁxed overnight. Ice-cold
sections (40 μm) were prepared using standard protocols and freeﬂoating sections were incubated with 3% H2O2 in 0.01 M PBS. After
incubation with a blocking solution, the sections were incubated
with primary antibody anti-Ki67 (Cell Signaling Technology) or
anti-Nestin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 48 h at 4 1C and then incubated
with CY2 or CY3-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for
0.5 h. The ﬂuorescence signals were visualized using a confocal
laser scanning microscope system (MRC1024, Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA). For immunohistochemistry analysis, the sections prepared as above were incubated with primary antibody anti-βcatenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 24 h at 4 1C. The secondary
antibody was biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The sections were stained using the avidin-biotin
peroxidase complex method with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine as a
chromogen. The stained sections were then dehydrated in a
graded alcohol series, cleared in xylene, coverslipped with neutral
balsam and examined under a light microscope equipped with a
computerized image analysis system (Olympus BX51, Japan).
Image Pros Plus 5.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Bethesda,
MD, USA) was used to determine the average number of positive
cells in area of interest (AOI) in the dorsal lateral corner of SVZ
per section.
2.5. Protein expression analysis.

2.2. Animals and the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model
Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 260–280 g were
purchased from Beijing Vitalriver Experimental Animal Co. (Beijing, China), and were housed under a 12/12 h dark/light cycle and
speciﬁc-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. Before the MCAO model
was performed, the rats were fasted without water deprivation
for 12 h. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with 3.5%
enﬂurane in a mixture of 70% nitrous oxide and a balance of
oxygen (Bickford veterinary anesthesia equipment model no.
61010, AM Bickford Inc., Wales Center, NY, USA). The rats were
orally intubated, immobilized with intra-arterial pancuronium
bromide (0.6 mg/kg) and mechanically ventilated (Rodent Ventilator Model 683, Harvard Apparatus Inc., Holliston, MA, USA).
A piece of nylon monoﬁlament was inserted into the left internal
carotid artery via an arteriotomy and lodged in the narrow
proximal anterior cerebral artery, which blocked the MCA at its
origin. After 30 min of ischemia, reperfusion was established by
the withdrawal of the ﬁlament. When both cerebral and rectal
temperatures returned to normal levels, the animals were allowed
to regain consciousness and were placed under warm conditions
for an additional 3 h. Morroniside was dissolved in normal saline
and administered intragastrically once a day at the dose of 30, 90,
270 mg/kg for 7 days, starting at 3 h after MCAO. The vehicle
control groups of the ischemic rats received an equal volume of
normal saline. Sham-operated rats were treated with an equal
volume of normal saline or 270 mg/kg morroniside. Animal protocols for these studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of Xuanwu Hospital in Capital Medical University.
2.3. Neurological scoring
Seven days post-MCAO, neurological deﬁcits were evaluated by
Ludmila Belayev score test as previously described (Belayev et al.,
1996).

The rats were euthanized under 10% chloral hydrate (0.4 mL/kg)
anesthesia. The infarct side of the cortex was harvested and homogenized in ice-cold buffer (tris-(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane
50 mM, pH 7.4, NaCl 150 mM, 0.5% Triton X-100, edetic acid 1 mM,
phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride 1 M and aprotinin 5 mg/L). Following
the homogenate centrifuged at 14,000  g at 4 1C for 30 min, the
supernatants were collected as the total protein. The proteins were
then electrophoresed through a 10–15% sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) and electrically transferred onto a
nitrocellulose membrane. This membrane was detected using primary antibodies, including anti-Wnt 3a (Millipore), anti-β catenin
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Tcf-4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
anti-Pax 6 (Abcam), anti-Tbr 2 (Abcam), anti-neurogenin2 (Ngn2)
(Abcam). The amount of protein was normalized with β-actin values
in the same lane.
2.6. Statistical analysis.
All data are presented as the mean 7SEM. Analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Scheffe (when number of sample is not equal)
or Tukey's multiple range post-hoc test was carried out by using
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (SPSS 17.0 Statistical Software). A p value of less than 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

3. Results
3.1. Morroniside improved neurological deﬁcits 7 days following
MCAO
In Ludmila Belayev score test, the score of the vehicle-treated
rats was signiﬁcantly increased to 5.36 70.61 from 0 compared
with the sham-operated group 7 days after MCAO (P o0.001,
n ¼11), indicating that neurological deﬁcits of the rats caused
by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion remained 7 days after MCAO.

216

However, treatment with morroniside at the concentrations of 90
and 270 mg/kg/day for 7 days after MCAO respectively reduced the
Ludmila Belayev score from 5.36 70.61 to 2.69 7 0.56 (P o0.05,
n ¼13) and 1.36 7 0.49 (P o0.001, n ¼14) (Fig. 1). These results
suggested the effects of morroniside on the recovery of neurological function 7 days post-ischemic injury.

3.2. Morroniside promotes neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia
To study the effects of morroniside on neurogenesis, we ﬁrst
examined cell proliferation in the SVZ 7 days after MCAO by using
immunostaining for Ki-67. In the vehicle-treated ischemic rats,
cerebral ischemia induced Ki-67-positive cells were clearly

increased in the ischemic ipsilateral dorsolateral corner of SVZ
7 days after MCAO (Fig. 2C). Treatment with morroniside at dose of
90 and 270 mg/kg respectively increased the number of Ki-67positive cells in SVZ from 123.177 3.66 to 310.5 7 3.47 (P o0.001)
and 423.83 75.76 (P o0.001) (Fig. 2E–G).
Next, we detected Nestin-positive cells in the SVZ by using
immunoﬂuorescence. In the vehicle-treated ischemic rats, Nestinpositive cells were also increased in the ischemic ipsilateral dorsolateral corner of the SVZ 7 days after MCAO (Fig. 3C). Quantitation
conﬁrmed that the number of Nestin-positive cells was signiﬁcantly
increased compared with the sham-operated group (Po0.001)
(Fig. 3H). Treatment with morroniside at dose of 30, 90 and
270 mg/kg respectively increased the density of Nestin-positive cells
in SVZ from 254.6876.03% to 363.3675.89% (Po0.001), 442.167
7.25% (Po0.001) and 475.5974.97% (Po0.001) (Fig. 3H). Moreover,
Nestin-positive cells in morroniside-treated rats were found not only
in the SVZ area but also appeared to penetrate into peri-infarct cortex
(Fig. 3G). In addition, the results of Ki-67- and Nestin-positive cells
indicated that there were no effects on the cell proliferation of the
sham-operated rats after morroniside treatment (Figs. 2B and 3B).
Taken together, these data indicate that administration of morroniside
promotes neural stem cell proliferation after focal cerebral ischemia.

ischemic stroke

Ludmila Belayev scores are expressed as absolute values and Scheffe post-hoc test

In order to study the potential mechanisms of morroniside in
neurogenesis, we examined the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
pathway in this neurorestorative process. The results showed
β-catenin expression in the SVZ (Fig. 4A and B), indicating the
potential relationship between the Wnt signaling pathway and
neurogenesis. As Fig. 4C–F shows, the expression of Wnt3a,
β-catenin and Tcf-4 was increased at 7 days after ischemia in
the morroniside-treated rats, compared with the vehicle-treated
ischemic rats. These results indicate that the Wnt signaling
pathway is involved in the effects of morroniside on ischemic
recovery. It was also observed that there were no signiﬁcant
differences in the above-mentioned protein expression between

the vehicle-treated ischemia rats and the sham-operated group
(Fig. 4C–F). These results suggest that long term activation
of Wnt signaling is sustained by morroniside per se, and not
non-speciﬁcally caused by lingering effects of ischemia.
Consistent with a role for this mechanism in brain recovery, the
expression proﬁles of Wnt3a continued to evolve at 1 day and
3 days after ischemia. Compared with the corresponding shamoperated group, the expression of Wnt3a was increased about
57.1% at 1 day (Fig. 5A; Wnt 3a/actin at 1 day, MCAO, 1.05 7 0.03
versus sham, 0.7 70.05, P o0.05; n¼ 3), but no change occurred at
3 day (Fig. 5B; Wnt 3a/actin at 3 day, MCAO, 0.89 70.15 versus
sham, 0.89 70.14, P4 0.05; n ¼ 3). This result indicates that activation of Wnt signaling triggered by ischemia may last up to
24 h; however, treatment with morroniside may extend this active
period to 7 days.
To further conﬁrm the effects of morroniside, we treated
non-ischemic sham-operated rats with morroniside at dose of
270 mg/kg/day for 1 day and 3 days, and then examined the
Wnt3a expression on the ﬁrst and third day after morroniside
administration. The results showed that there was no difference
between morroniside-treated animals and untreated control
groups (Fig. 5A and B), which indicate that morroniside may not

be a direct agonist of Wnt signaling per se, but may only activate
Wnt signaling in the context of ischemia-injured brain.
3.4. Morroniside regulated the expression of Wnt signaling-related
transcription factors after ischemic stroke
To further study the effects of morroniside on Wnt signaling
pathway, the expression of transcription factors downstreams of
Wnt signaling pathway was examined by immunoblot assay. The
results showed that the expression of Ngn2 was signiﬁcantly
increased by 1.76-fold 7 days after MCAO, compared with the
sham-operated group (P o0.05, n ¼3). Administration of morroniside at dose of 90 and 270 mg/kg enhanced this increase in Ngn
2 expression by 1.59-fold (P o0.01, n ¼4) and 1.76-fold (Po 0.01,
n ¼4) respectively, compared with the vehicle-treated group
(Fig. 6A and B). The Pax6 level is also up-regulated by morroniside
of 90 and 270 mg/kg 7 days after MCAO, although no change
occurred in the vehicle-treated group compared with the shamoperated group (Fig. 6A and C). As to the expression of Tbr2,
post-hoc analysis showed that there were no signiﬁcant differences between the morroniside-treated, the vehicle-treated ischemia rats and the sham-operated group.

4. Discussion
In the present study, we identiﬁed the neuroprotective effects
of morroniside of 7 days-administration in a rat model of MCAO,
characterized by improving neurological function. We proposed
that promoting neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia plays an

important role for morroniside intervention. As the results of
immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting shown, Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway might be involved in the neurorestorative mechanisms of morroniside on neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia.
Neurogensis is a primary neurovascular response during stroke
recovery phase. Cerebral ischemia stimulates neurogenesis in the

SVZ and subgranular zone (SGZ) of adult brain (Delavaran et al.,
2013; Marti-Fabregas et al., 2010; Ohira et al., 2010). Ki-67 is a
nuclear nonhistone protein expressed among proliferating cells
but absent in quiescent cells, therefore being used as a proliferation marker (Yerushalmi et al., 2010; Varela-Nallar et al., 2014),
while Nestin is a class VI intermediate ﬁlament protein that
serves as a predominate marker for neural stem and progenitor
cells (Messam et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2013). Hence, the increased
levels of Ki-67 or Nestin-immunoreactive cells in the SVZ of
the ischemia-treated rats indicated endogenous neural stem cells
response 7 days following MCAO. After morroniside administration, this increase in the number of Ki-67 or Nestin-postive cells
was enhanced. Morever, the distribution of Nestin-immunoreactive cells of ischemia-treated rats was observed not only
in the lateral ventricle wall and the dorsolateral corner of the
SVZ, but also in the peri-infarct cortex. The results indicate that
morroniside promote neurogenesis post-ischemia, and the upregulation of these neural progenitor cells is thought to contribute to
functional recovery.
Several studies have addressed the role of Wnt/β-catenin
signaling in adult neurogenesis, mediating cell survival, proliferation of neural progenitor cells and differentiation into neuron
(Inestrosa and Arenas, 2010; Kuwabara et al., 2009). It has been
also previously reported that components of the canonical Wnt/βcatenin pathway are expressed within the adult SVZ and SGZ
(Adachi et al., 2007), and Wnt/β-catenin signals activate downstream target genes to promote adult neurogenesis (Kuwabara
et al., 2009; Lie et al., 2005). Growing evidence from recent studies
suggests that this pathway is upregulated in the SVZ following

stroke and may exert an important role in ischemia-induced
neurogenesis (Lei et al., 2008; Mastroiacovo et al., 2009). The
results in the present research show that the Wnt signaling
pathway is activated in the early phase of ischemia and is limited
to 24 h; however, its activation extends to 7 days after treatment with morroniside. The absence of any effects on the shamoperated rats suggests that morroniside may not directly act on
Wnt signaling, while it may only exert its activation role on the
ischemic-injured brain. Thus, morroniside may function as a stem
cell proliferation enhancer rather than an initiator.
In order to conﬁrm the effects and possible mechanisms of
morroniside on neurogenesis, we further studied the changes of
the expression of downstreams factors in the Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway 7 days post-ischemia. Transcription factors
Pax6, Tbr2 and Ngn2 have been demonstrated to function as
downstream mediator of Wnt-induced neurogenesis from adult
hippocampal neural progenitors (Cho and Dressler, 1998; Faigle
and Song, 2013). Kohwi et al. (2005) found that transcription
factor Pax6 was expressed in most proliferating SVZ progenitors
but only in a subpopulation of migrating neuroblasts, promoting
neuronal differentiation. The studies on Pax6 mutant Small
Eye mice have shown that Pax6 plays an important role in the
regulation of forebrain development by Wnt–Tcf signaling pathway (Cho and Dressler, 1998), and regulates the differentiation of
speciﬁc subtypes of interneurons in the olfactory bulb (OB)
(Ninkovic et al., 2010). Tbr2, a pro-neurogenic T-box transcription
factor expressed by intermediate neuronal progenitors (INPs), has
been shown to be critically required for neurogenesis in the adult
subventricular zone (SVZ) and in the dentate gyrus of adult mice

220

(Brill et al., 2009). Functional inactivation of Tbr2 consistently
results in increased proliferation of NSCs, but in the long-time
absence of Tbr2, neurogenesis is halted as the result of failed
neuronal differentiation (Hodge et al., 2012). There is a crosstalk
between Pax6 and Tbr2 that down-regulation of Pax6 upregulates
Tbr2 expressions in olfactory bulb mitral cells in developing
neocortex while overexpression of Pax6 leads the postmitotic cells
differentiate into interneurons (Bayatti et al., 2008; Imamura and
Greer, 2013). Ngn2 is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix
(bHLH) transcription factors, and it is well known that Ngn2 is
associated with neural differentiation and inhibits astrocytic
differentiation. The previous studies have shown that β-catenin
signaling could upregulate Ngn2 expression although the mechanism is still not clariﬁed (Hong and Bain, 2012; Matsumoto
et al., 2013). The results of this present study demonstrated that
morroniside-treatment upregulated the expressions of Pax6 and
Ngn2. It is indicated that the regulation of these factors might be
involved in the augment of neural stem cells proliferation and next
neuronal differention by morroniside through Wnt/β-catenin
pathway. As to the negative-effects of morroniside on Tbr2, we
considered it be associated with the complex expression patterns
of Pax6 and Tbr2 (Bayatti et al., 2008; Muzio et al., 2002).
In summary, morroniside improves the endogenous mechanisms of neurogenesis for brain recovery following ischemic stroke.
Morroniside could sustain the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to enhance the proliferation of neural stem cells
7 days post-ischemia, and could regulate the expression of downstream transcription factors Pax6 and Ngn2 to promote neurogenesis. Though the exact correlation between the Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway and neurogenesis promoted by morroniside
still needs to be fully deﬁned, these results suggest that morroniside offers a prospective medicine for stroke recovery. One caveat
remains, i.e. the temporal relationship between acute neuroprotection and delayed neurorepair. In this initial study, treatments
with morroniside were started at 3 h after MCAO. Thus, overlap
between its known acute protective effects and our present
ﬁndings of promoting neurogenesis cannot be fully separated,
and ultimately, the correlation between delayed neurorepair effect
and whole-animal neurological function still needs to be fully
deﬁned.
