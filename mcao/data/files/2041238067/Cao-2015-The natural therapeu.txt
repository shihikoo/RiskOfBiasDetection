Ethnopharmacological relevance: Salvia miltiorrhiza, a perennial plant in the genus Salvia and popularly
known as “Danshen”, is highly valued for its roots in traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). It has widely
used for the treatment of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases in China. Recently, the cerebral
protection of magnesium lithospermate B (MLB), a working extract from Salvia miltiorrhiza, has received
more attention. Here, we investigated the therapeutic effects of MLB on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
(CI/R) injury using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rats.
Materials and methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to CI/R using a thread to occlude the
right middle cerebral artery. After 2 h of cerebral ischemia, the middle cerebral artery was reperfused for
24 h. Rats were injected with different doses of MLB (15, 30 and 60 mg/kg). Infarct zones, neurological
deﬁcit scores, brain water content, glutamate levels and protein expressions were evaluated after 24 h of
reperfusion.
Results: We found that MLB treatment of rats exposed to focal CI/R decreased neurological deﬁcit scores,
brain water content, glutamate levels and cerebral infarct zones. We also demonstrated that MLB can
inhibit CI/R injury-induced activation of caspase-3, a marker of apoptosis. This protection by MLB against
CI/R injury was accompanied by an upregulation of p-Akt in the ischemic hemisphere. Furthermore, the
MLB-induced protection was prevented by treatment with a PI3K inhibitor (LY-294002).
Conclusions: The data in the present study suggest a potential protective role of MLB against CI/R injury
in rats. The salient ﬁnding of the present study is that this protective effect of MLB is likely mediated
through an Akt-dependent pathway.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the second most common cause of death and a major
cause of disability around the world. Ischemic stroke occurs due to
impairment of the blood supply to the brain or any of its parts,
resulting in glucose and oxygen deprivation. Effective treatment of
ischemic stroke requires re-canalization of occluded cerebral blood
vessels. However, reperfusion after cerebral ischemia can cause brain

injury, leading to cerebral edema, brain hemorrhage, and neuronal
death. This phenomenon is termed as cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
(CI/R) injury (Donnan et al., 2008). However, few CI/R treatments
have been successfully applied in clinical practice, although several
strategies and drugs have been shown to decrease CI/R damage in
animal models (Auriel and Bornstein, 2010; Sahota and Savitz, 2011).
Recent studies have focused on the application of traditional Chinese
medicines (TCMs) in the treatment of cerebral injury, as many TCMs
and their active components are reported to possess neuroprotective
efﬁcacy. Indeed, Danhong injections and ligustrazine hydrochloride
injections have been effective treatments for CI/R injury in China
(He et al., 2012). As such, TCMs exhibit desirable effects on reperfusion injury, suggesting that they may be potential novel reperfusion
injury therapies (Jia et al., 2008; Xuejiang et al., 1999). Thus, ﬁnding
more effective therapeutic neuroprotective agents with minimal side

effects from natural sources, such as herbs or plants, has become a
priority in the ﬁeld of TCMs.
Salvia miltiorrhiza, a perennial plant in the genus Salvia and
popularly known as “Danshen”, is highly valued for its roots in TCMs.
It has widely used in China and, to a lesser extent, in Japan, the
United States, and European countries for the treatment of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases. Magnesium lithospermate B
(MLB, Fig. 1) is the active component in the water-soluble fraction of
Salvia miltiorrhiza (Kim et al., 2010). Over the last decade, substantial
scientiﬁc evidence has suggested that MLB has anti-ﬁbrotic, myocardial protection, and neuroprotective effects (Tzen et al., 2007). MLB
prevents hepatitis and uraemia, and it improves blood circulation,
arrhythmia, and renal function (Fish et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2003).
Recent work has shown that MLB possesses cardioprotective effects
on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, decreasing ST-segment
elevation, reducing infarct size, and alleviating myocardial damage
severity (Quan et al., 2013). However, up to now, few studies have
considered the protective effects of MLB on CI/R injury. Thus, we
assessed the potential beneﬁt of MLB using the middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rats. In addition, one of the critical
mechanisms of CI/R injury involves the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway (Mullonkal and Toledo-Pereyra, 2007;
Zhao et al., 2006). Extensive research has shown that the activation
of PI3K/Akt during CI/R plays a pivotal role in reducing neuronal
damage (Zhao et al., 2006). However, whether the activation of the
PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in MLB-induced protection against CI/R
injury remains unknown. Therefore, we further investigated the
potential mechanism of MLB on CI/R injury, paying particular
attention to the effects of MLB on the PI3K/Akt pathway.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Ethics statement
This study was performed in accordance with the National
Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of experimental animals,
and all animal protocols were approved by the Fourth Military
Medical University (FMMU) Committee on Animal Care. All surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and
all efforts were made to minimize suffering.
2.2. Animals and chemicals
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (2507 20 g) were supplied by
the animal research center at FMMU. Rats were housed individually under constant temperature (23 73 1C) and humidity, with a
12-h light/dark cycle and free access to chow and water.
MLB was provided by Xi’an Honson Biotechnology Co. (Xi’an,
China). Dried roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza plants cultivated in a local
farm were prepared. The dried roots (8.8 kg) were extracted with
50 l methanol under reﬂux for 8 h and concentrated to a brown
syrup. The syrup was suspended in H2O and partitioned with

chloroform. MLB was harvested after repeated column chromatography of the H2O extract using Sephadex LH-20 and H2O as an
eluent. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis
was performed. Brieﬂy, the HPLC system (Agilent 1100 Series)
consisted of a quaternary pump, C18 gravity column (Alltima C18,
250  4.6 mm, 5 μm) and DAD detector; mobile phase: acetonitrile–water-5% acetic acid ¼21/78/1; ﬂowrate: 1.0 ml/min; detector wave length: 286 nm (Fig. 2).
2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (LY) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co.
(St. Louis, MO, U.S.). The BCA protein assay kit was obtained from
Jiancheng Reagent Co. (Nanjing, China). All primary antibodies and
goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody were bought from Cell
Signaling Co. (Cell Signaling, Santa Cruz, CA).
2.3. The MCAO model
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was induced as
previously described (Xu et al., 2006). After an overnight fast, rats
were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 40–45 mg/kg 2%
(v/v) sodium pentobarbital, and placed in dorsal recumbency.
Following a skin incision, the right common carotid artery, the
external carotid artery (ECA), and the internal carotid artery (ICA)
were exposed and carefully isolated. A 3-0 monoﬁlament nylon
suture was inserted from the lumen of the ECA to that of the right
ICA to occlude the origin of the right middle cerebral artery. After
2 h of MCAO, the suture was carefully removed from the ICA. The
neck incision was closed, and the rats were allowed to recover.
During the surgical procedure, body temperature was maintained
at 37 1C with a heating pad. The sham group underwent the same
surgical procedure, except that the monoﬁlament was introduced
into the external carotid artery but not advanced.

2.4. Experimental groups
Part 1: To investigate the cerebral protective effects of MLB, rats
were divided randomly into 3 large groups: (I) sham (n ¼9), (II)
vehicleþCI/R (n ¼ 9), and (III) MLB þCI/R (n ¼9 in each subgroup).
Rats in groups (I) and (II) were injected (i.v.) with saline. Rats in
group (III) were injected (i.v.) with 15, 30, or 60 mg/kg MLB at the
onset of reperfusion.
Part 2: To explore the underlying therapeutic mechanism of
MLB, rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: (I) vehicle þCI/R
(n ¼9), (II) MLB þCI/R (n ¼9), and (III) MLB þCI/R þLY (n¼ 9). Rats
in group (I) were injected (i.v.) with saline. Rats in group (II) were
injected (i.v.) with 60 mg/kg MLB at the onset of reperfusion. Rats
in group (III) were injected (i.v.) with LY294002 (5 mg/ml, 10 μl)
before MCAO and then injected (i.v.) with 60 mg/kg MLB at the
onset of reperfusion (Fig. 3).
2.5. Assessment of neurological deﬁcits
Neurological testing was performed by a single, blinded examiner just before the rats were killed. Neurological deﬁcits were
evaluated 24 h after MCAO according to a 5-point scale system
described previously (Xu et al., 2010). If no deﬁcit was observed
after MCAO, the animal was removed from further study. Scoring
was as follows: 0 ¼no deﬁcit, 1 ¼ failure to extend the left forepaw
fully, 2 ¼ circling to the left, 3 ¼paresis to the left, 4 ¼no spontaneous walking, 5 ¼death.
2.6. Measurement of infarct zone in the brain
Rats were killed by decapitation after reperfusion, and the brain
was kept at  20 1C for 10 min. Frozen brains were sliced into

uniform coronal sections approximately 2-mm thick, and the brain
slices were stained with 1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)
at 37 1C for 15 min (Chen et al., 2012). The TTC-stained sections were
photographed with a digital camera, and the infarct areas of each
section were measured using an image analysis system (Image-Pro
Plus, Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD) (Belayev et al., 2003). Percentage infarct zone was calculated as follows: [(VC VL)/VC]  100%,
where VC is the zone of the control hemisphere, and VL is the zone of
the non-infarcted tissue in the lesioned hemisphere.
2.7. Measurement of brain water content
After brains were used for measuring the infarct zones as described
above, all of the samples, including infarcted and non-infarcted sections, were weighed immediately to obtain the wet weights. Then, the
samples were dried in a desiccating oven at 110 1C for 24 h and
weighed again to obtain the dry weights. Brain water content was
calculated as follows: brain water content (%)¼ (wet weight dry
weight)/wet weight  100% (Chen et al., 2012).
2.8. Measurement of glutamate level
Animals were maintained under anesthesia, and body temperature was maintained at 37 1C with a heating pad. Levels of glutamate
in the cerebro-spinal ﬂuid were determined as documented in a
previous study. In brief, a dialysis device was implanted in the dorsal
dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. Probes were constructed with a hollow ﬁber bent into a U-shaped loop. The U-loop,
sealed to the cannula with epoxy, was 2.05–2.4 mm in length and
had an internal volume of 0.033–0.038 ml. The loop was perfused
with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution by a powered micro-injector.
After a midline incision, dissection of the neck muscles exposed the

atlanto-occipital membrane. This membrane was punctured, and the
cerebro-spinal ﬂuid ﬂowed spontaneously from the cerebellomedullary cisterna (Zhao et al., 2012). Samples (30-ml) of cerebro-spinal
ﬂuid were collected prior to ischemia; at 30, 60 and 120 min after
ischemia; and at 30, 60, 120, 240 and 480 min after reperfusion.

2.9. Western blot analysis
Ischemic brains were quickly removed, and ischemic area brain
tissues were collected. Proteins were extracted from brain tissue,
and protein concentrations were determined. The proteins
(30–60 μg) were resolved on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The
fractionated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes and probed overnight at
4 1C with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt, anti-Akt, or anticleaved caspase-3. The following day, the membranes were
incubated at room temperature for 2 h with the corresponding

secondary antibodies. The blots were visualized with ECL-Plus
reagent (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ).

2.10. Statistical analysis
First, we checked whether the data were normally distributed.
If the data were normally distributed, we planned to use a
parametric analysis method; if not, we planned to conduct a
nonparametric statistical analysis. All of the data showed a normal
distribution; therefore, we conducted a parametric analysis. Continuous variables that approximated the normal distribution were
expressed as the mean 7 standard deviation (S.D.). Neurologic
scores were expressed as the median. Comparisons between
groups were accomplished using ANOVA followed by Turkey’s
multiple comparison tests. A level of po 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant. Statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, CA).

3. Results
3.1. MLB treatment reduced infarct zone
The infarct zone is considered a key criterion in evaluating CI/R
injury, and it is directly related to the prognosis of patients in the
clinic (Deng et al., 2013). To examine the protective effect of MLB on
CI/R injury, we ﬁrst performed TTC staining after 24 h of reperfusion
and 2 h of MCAO. TTC staining of brain slices were analyzed to
determine the percentage of the infarct zone relative to the whole
brain. The effects of MLB and vehicle on infarct zones after CI/R
injury are presented in Fig. 4A. The CI/R-induced infarct zone in rats
was 43.274.3% (F(2,15)¼ 242, po0.05, Fig. 4B). However, treatment with MLB markedly attenuated the CI/R-induced infarct zone
to 19.174.0% F(2,15)¼242, po0.05, Fig. 4B). This result suggested
that MLB possessed a protective effect on CI/R injury.
3.2. The protective effect of MLB on infarct zone was dose-dependent
To evaluate the protective effect of MLB on CI/R injury in the
MCAO model, we treated rats with different doses of MLB (15, 30,
and 60 mg/kg body weight). TTC staining 24 h after reperfusion
indicated that MLB treatment at 15 mg/kg did not remarkably reduce
infarct zone compared with the CI/R group (39.274.0% vs
43.274.3%, F(4,25)¼104.2, p40.05, Fig. 5); however, MLB treatment
at 30 and 60 mg/kg demonstrated signiﬁcant protection against CI/R
injury compared with the untreated group (26.975.9% and 19.17
4.0% vs 43.274.3%, F(4,25)¼104.2, po0.05, Fig. 5), suggesting a
dose-dependent protective effect of MLB on infarct zone in the rat
MCAO model. In the following experiments, we chose the 60-mg/kg
body weight dose to study the protective effect of MLB.

Fig. 7. MLB treatment decreased brain water content. The brain water content of
the ipsilateral hemispheres was similar to the neurological score and infarct zone.
No difference was found in contralateral hemispheres. CI/R, cerebral ischemia/

mean7 S.D. n ¼6. Signiﬁcance was determined by ANOVA followed by Tukey’s
test. #p o 0.05 vs. sham group, np o 0.05 vs. vehicleþ CI/R group.

3.3. MLB treatment improved neurological deﬁcits
When CI/R occurs, it changes the cerebral ultrastructure, function and metabolism, resulting in brain tissue damage intertwined
with serious dysneuria. In the present study, we focused on the
correlated neurological deﬁcit score (Oron et al., 2006). Neurological
deﬁcits, assessed by monitoring ambulatory activity, were signiﬁcantly increased in rats in the CI/R group compared with rats in the
MLB group (neurological score median: 3 vs 1, F(2,21)¼ 38.34,
po0.05, Fig. 6). Distinct neurological impairment symptoms, such
as a failure to stretch the left forepaw completely, circling toward
the left, left lateroversion when walking and loss of walking were
observed in the CI/R group. Treatment with MLB signiﬁcantly
ameliorated these neurological impairment symptoms.

explore the therapeutic time window of MLB exposure, we examined the levels of glutamate in the cerebro-spinal ﬂuid before,
during and after CI/R injury. The pre-ischemic level of glutamate
was 4.09 70.76 mmol/l. CI/R signiﬁcantly elevated the levels of
glutamate (po 0.05, Fig. 8). Administration of MLB greatly suppressed the levels of glutamate after reperfusion (F(2,6)¼77.5,
po 0.05, Fig. 8).

3.4. MLB treatment decreased brain water content
3.6. MLB treatment decreased cleaved caspase-3 expression
Total brain water content changes in several cerebral pathological conditions, and the measurement of brain water content is
important for the selection of appropriate therapeutic procedures
(Chen et al., 2012). This study further examined the effects of MLB
on brain water content. In the ipsilateral hemisphere, the brain
water content was 76.9 71.4 in the sham group (Fig. 7). In the
ipsilateral hemisphere of the MLB group, the brain water content
was lower (79.0 71.4, F(2,18) ¼104.6, p o0.05, Fig. 7) than that in
the CI/R group (81.67 1.1, Fig. 7). No signiﬁcant differences among
the groups were observed in the contralateral hemispheres.
3.5. MLB treatment decreased glutamate levels
Glutamate is the most common excitatory neurotransmitter in
the mammalian central nervous system, and glutamate excitotoxicity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many devastating
human neurological diseases, such as stroke (Zhao et al., 2012). To

Brain injury has been shown to cause marked elevation in
glutamate concentrations, which is responsible for neuronal injury
or death owing to excitotoxicity (Bonde et al., 2005). CI/R injury is
a pathological process that results in extensive apoptotic and
necrotic cell death, with apoptosis considered to be the dominant
cause of cell death after CI/R injury (Chen et al., 2013a, 2013b).
Notably, caspase-3 is regarded as a marker of apoptosis (Srinivasan
et al., 1998). Therefore, we also determined the levels of cleaved
caspase-3 in brain tissue using western blot analysis. We found
that CI/R injury caused a signiﬁcant increase in cleaved caspase-3
expression compared with the sham group. MLB treatment decreased the expression of cleaved caspase-3 following CI/R injury
(Fig. 9A). Further quantitative analysis showed that MLB treatment
markedly decreased cleaved caspase-3 expression compared with
the CI/R group (0.98 70.22 vs 2.02 70.32, F(2,6) ¼39.5, p o0.05,
Fig. 9B).

ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test. #p o0.05 vs. sham group, npo 0.05 vs. vehicleþCI/R group.

3.7. MLB treatment increased phosphorylated Akt levels
Indeed, among the numerous signaling pathways involved in
regulating cell survival, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a
crucial role in protecting the brain from CI/R injury (Mullonkal and
Toledo-Pereyra, 2007; Zhao et al., 2006). To further explore the
potential of MLB as a novel therapeutic for CI/R treatment, it was
important to address the mechanism by which the compound
exerted its neuroprotective effects. In our study, western blot
analysis was used to evaluate the effect of MLB on phosphorylated
Akt (p-Akt). After reperfusion, no signiﬁcant changes were identiﬁed in total Akt (t-Akt) expression among the groups (Fig. 9C). It is
well known that Akt phosphorylation has been demonstrated to
reﬂect Akt activation. Treatment with MLB signiﬁcantly increased
the expression of p-Akt compared with the CI/R group (0.6570.04
vs 0.3270.03, F(2,6)¼ 249, po0.05, Fig. 9D). Therefore, Akt activation may be the mechanism by which MLB protects against CI/R
injury.
3.8. The PI3K inhibitor LY-294002 reversed the protective effects
of MLB
To expand on the above results, LY-294002, a PI3K/Akt inhibitor,
was used to conﬁrm that MLB modulated Akt activity. TTC staining
was performed after the treatment with LY-294002 to evaluate its
effects on infarct zone. As expected, LY-294002 treatment partly
abolished the protective effect of MLB on infarct zone (19.075.2 vs
26.877.4, F(2,15)¼ 15.55, po0.05, Fig. 10C and D). In addition, the
stimulatory effect of MLB on Akt phosphorylation was completely

abolished by treatment with LY-294002 (0.6570.04 vs 0.2370.04,
F(2,6)¼90.69, po0.05, Fig. 10A and B). These results using
LY-294002 conﬁrmed the crucial participation of the PI3K/Akt
pathway in MLB-induced protection against CI/R injury.

4. Discussion
In clinical practice, CI/R injury, which results in cerebral infarction, is the main cause for the aggravation of brain dysfunction and
cell death (Ekshyyan and Aw, 2004). There are very few effective
treatments for stroke, and the development of new therapeutic
interventions is currently the main goal in many laboratories
around the world (Arumugam et al., 2008; Young et al., 2007).
However, clinical applications and experimental animal models
have demonstrated that TCMs have desirable effects, suggesting
that they have a bright future in the therapy of reperfusion injury
(Guan et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2012; Yin et al., 2013).
Salvia miltiorrhiza, a very important traditional Chinese medicinal
herb, has been commonly used in TCMs for over a thousand years in
the treatment of coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular diseases, including stroke (Li et al., 2012). The therapeutic efﬁcacy of
Salvia miltiorrhiza for stroke has been conﬁrmed by clinical studies
suggesting that Salvia miltiorrhiza preparations were neuroprotective
with few or no adverse effects (Xu et al., 2009). MLB, a tetramer of
caffeic acid with various pharmacological actions, is an effective
component extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza (Wei et al., 2013). In the
present study, we found that treatment of rats exposed to focal CI/R
with MLB decreased cerebral infarct zone and brain water content.

These results suggested that MLB possessed cerebral protective
effects on CI/R injury. The beneﬁcial effect of MLB on infarct zone
was also conﬁrmed and found to be dose-dependent. Thus, we chose
a dose of 60 mg/kg body weight to study the cerebral protective
effects of MLB.
It is accepted that when CI/R occurs, it changes the cerebral
ultrastructure, function and metabolism, resulting in brain tissue
damage intertwined with serious dysneuria (Chen et al., 2012).
Neurological deﬁcits are the main criteria generally used for the
deﬁnite diagnosis of CI/R injury. In the present study, a neurological
examination was performed after CI/R. The neurological ﬁndings
were scored on a 5-point scale. Our study suggested that treatment
with MLB signiﬁcantly ameliorated CI/R-induced neurological impairment symptoms, which was consistent with the infarct zone and
brain water content results.
Glutamate is the most common excitatory neurotransmitter in
the mammalian central nervous system and is involved in many
aspects of normal brain function. Normal brain tissue contains
5–15 mmol of glutamate per kg, depending on the region. Glutamate
may also be a potent neurotoxin when its levels are too high
(Danbolt, 2001). Indeed, glutamate excitotoxicity is implicated in
the pathogenesis of many devastating human neurological diseases,
such as stroke (Bonde et al., 2005). Our results indicated that
Administration of MLB greatly suppressed the levels of glutamate
after reperfusion. Thus, the maintenance of normal extracellular glutamate concentrations by MLB is critical for preventing CI/R injury.
Evidence from experimental models shows that apoptosis, a
process of self-destructive cell death, is involved in CI/R injury and
neurodegenerative disorders (Connell et al., 2011). Previous studies

have also shown that the caspase family promotes and implements
apoptosis in mammalian cells, with caspase-3 being the most
critical downstream effector in the caspase cascade (Yang et al.,
2006). Thus, we measured caspase-3 activity to explore the underlying mechanism responsible for the protective effect of MLB in rats
after CI/R injury. The results indicated that MLB inhibited cell
apoptosis in the brain, which was accompanied by a reduced
expression of cleaved caspase-3 after CI/R injury. Because our data
demonstrated that MLB prevented neuronal apoptosis after CI/R
injury, we explored the signaling pathways involved in the neuroprotective effects of MLB. It is well known that the PI3K/Akt
pathway is a central mediator in the signal transduction pathways
regulating cell growth, cell survival, and metabolism (Zhao et al.,
2006). The neuroprotective role of the PI3K/Akt pathway in cerebral
ischemia has been widely studied. It is not clear whether MLB
activates the PI3K/Akt pathway after cerebral ischemia injury. In
this study, we provided evidence that PI3K/Akt activation mediates
the protective effects of MLB in the CI/R injury model and that
inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway abolishes the effect of
MLB on CI/R injury. LY-294002 was used in the present study to
dissect the protective role of MLB against CI/R injury. The data
demonstrated that LY-294002 blocked MLB-induced stimulation of
Akt. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that PI3K/Akt pathway
activation mediates the protective effects of MLB on CI/R injury.
Taken together, the data of the present study are the ﬁrst to
suggest a potential protective role of MLB against CI/R injury in rats
by decreasing infarct size, improving neurological deﬁcits, alleviating brain water content, and attenuating glutamate levels. We also
demonstrated that MLB inhibited the activation of caspase-3,

a marker of apoptosis, following CI/R injury. This protective effect of
MLB on CI/R injury was accompanied by an upregulation of p-Akt in
the ischemic hemisphere. Furthermore, the protection induced by
MLB was prevented by treatment with a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002).
Thus, the protective effect of MLB appeared to be mediated through
an Akt-dependent pathway.
