INTRODUCTION
In the acute phase of ischemic stroke, there is increasing
evidence that lysosome may be involved in mediating
neuronal death and survival, for regulating homeostasis
of intracellular damaged proteins and organelles (Luzio
et al., 2007). Autophagy is a catabolic process that is
important for bulk removal of cellular proteins and
organelles (Klionsky and Emr, 2000). For autophagic
degradation, proteins are targeted and transported to
membrane-enclosed vesicles. The vesicles are fused with
lysosomes and their contents are degraded by lysosomal
enzymes, cathepsins B, Hexb, et al. (Punnonen et al.,
1993; Kurz et al., 2008). Lysosomes are ubiquitous in all
animal cells, as an acidic compartment with limiting
membranes and contain various typos of hydrolytic
enzymes with acidic pH optima. Lysosomal proteolytic
enzymes normally reside in lysosomes and are responsible for protein breakdown. Regulation of intracellular
protein metabolism might cause a pathological proteolysis
of cytosolic proteins and membranes leading to further
cellular damage when released into the cytoplasm. In
the ischemic stroke, studies have identiﬁed that targeting
prodeath signaling upstream of mitochondria damagecathepsin B in ischemic astrocytes contributes to neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia (Gu et al., 2013). In
recent years, Terman et al. proposed a theory of
lysosomal-mitochondrial axis for cell death and survival
(Terman et al., 2006). Cerebral ischemia could induce
lysosomal membrane permeabilization and releasing of
lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes, causing neuronal death
mediating mitochondrial autophagy (Lipton, 2013).
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an endogenous non-coding
RNAs, comprising approximately 18–24 nucleotides of
small
regulatory
molecules
that
cause
posttranscriptional gene silencing by base pairing with
messenger RNA (mRNA) for degradation and/or
translational repression (Bartel, 2009). In recent years,
there is an increasing amount of evidence that miRNAs
play an important role in neural pathological and physiological changes (Sun and Hevner, 2014). The miRNA
expression proﬁle in cerebral ischemia was ﬁrst reported
by Jeyaseelan et al., which revealed 114 novel miRNAs
in the brain tissue and peripheral blood of rats
(Jeyaseelan et al., 2008). Subsequently, studies have
demonstrated that miRNAs play an important pathogenetic role in neuronal apoptosis, inﬂammation
response, and ionic homeostasis following stroke
(Dharap et al., 2009; Gubern et al., 2013). However,

Abstract—The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in lysosomemediated neuronal death and survival following ischemic
stroke remains unknown. Herein, using miRNA and mRNA
gene expression proﬁling microarrays, we identiﬁed the differentially expressed 24 miRNAs and 494 genes in the cortical peri-infarct area, respectively. Integrating the miRNA
targets and mRNA expression proﬁles, we found 47 genes
of miRNA targets, including lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2), Hexb, Bcl2, etc. MiR-207 and
miR-352 were mainly downregulated after ischemic stroke,
followed by a slight return to baseline during post-middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) 1 d to 7 d. Furthermore,
the luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that LAMP2
and Hexb were the direct targets of miR-207 and miR-352,
respectively. After lateral ventricle injection with miR-207
agonist mimics, the neurological deﬁcit scores and infarct
volumes were attenuated, and the structure of mitochondria
ridges was improved. In addition, miR-207 mimics could
reduce the number of cellular lysosome and autophagosome, whereas increase the number of autophagic vacuoles, indicating miR-207 might aﬀect the latter part of
lysosomal-autophagy pathway and mitochondria-induced
apoptosis. These results suggested that miR-207 and
miR-352 were involved in lysosomal pathway for mediating
ischemic injury and spontaneous recovery. MiR-207 mimics
as potential target drugs could protect against autophagic
cell death after ischemic stroke. Ó 2015 IBRO. Published

few reports have revealed that miRNAs regulate lysosomal function or autophagy in ischemic stroke.
Nowadays it is noteworthy that miRNA function was
deﬁned by bioinformatics analysis, which predicted their
potential targets (Lhakhang and Chaudhry, 2012).
However, predicted targets source from the Mirbase,
MicroCosm, Miranda, Targetscan, Mirdb and Pictar database, many of which are presumed to be false, which frequently lead to the failure of the functional veriﬁcationrelated experiments. In order to enhance their reliability,
researchers integrated the miRNA and mRNA expression
proﬁles for understanding their potential function (Cava
et al., 2014). However, integrated analysis of the miRNA
and mRNA expression proﬁles in early ischemic stroke
remains less.
Therefore, we aimed to analysis of miRNA and mRNA
expression proﬁles highlights alterations in modulation of
the neuronal death and survive in the cortical peri-infarct
area of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats
using high-throughput technologies. An integrative
method was developed to identify lysosomal-autophagy
pathway-related molecules which were involved in
ischemic stroke. The ﬁndings of the current studies
provided a novel insight into the molecular mechanisms
following ischemic stroke.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Ethics statement
All experimental procedures were approved by the
Committee on Animal Care and Usage of Fujian
University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (FUTCM) in
which all the principles followed the Chinese
Speciﬁcations for the Production, Care and Use of the
Laboratory Animals. All animal experiments were
permitted under License SYXK (Min) 2012-007 for
performing animal experiments. The rats were handled
according to the guidelines of the Council for
International Organization of Medical Sciences on
Animal Experimentation (World Health Organization,
Geneva, Switzerland) and the FUTCM.
MCAO rat model for focal cerebral ischemia
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 60) weighting
230–250 g were housed in an environmentally controlled
room at FUTCM (22 ± 2 °C with a 12-h/12-h light/dark
cycle). The rats were supplied with standard rat chow
and water ad libitum. Focal cerebral ischemia was
induced by MCAO, as described previously (Tao et al.,
2010) with slight modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, left MCAO was
performed using an occluding suture (diameter,
0.26 mm) for 2 h for MCAO-evoked ischemia, and then
the suture was slowly drawn back to allow reperfusion.
The ipsilateral cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) was measured
by Laser Doppler Flowmetry (BIOPAC Systems, Goleta,
CA, USA). The MCAO model was considered successful
(inclusion) only when cerebral blood ﬂow dropped equal
or more than 80% of baseline during occlusion.
Furthermore, this blood ﬂow rate was maintained for at
least one hour (except for 0-h time point). Although the

ipsilateral CBF was measured by Laser Doppler
Flowmetry in MCAO surgery, the lack of monitoring of
blood gases and cerebral blood ﬂow which were normal
for stroke research.
Rat groups
First experiment: Rats were randomly divided into the
following four groups (n = 16 rats per group): Sham
group (Sham), three groups of MCAO model groups
with 2 h of ischemia followed by reperfusion for 1, 3 and
7 days, respectively. Rats in Sham group received the
same surgical procedures as those in the model group
MCAO, but the suture was not advanced beyond the
internal carotid bifurcation.
Second experiment: Rats were randomly divided into
the following three groups (n = 12 rats per group): (1)
MCAO model with 3 days group (abbreviation:
MCAO + 3d), (2) MCAO with injection of miR-207
mimics (abbreviation: MCAO + miR-207mimics), (3)
MCAO with injection of miR-207 mimics negative control
(abbreviation: MCAO + Vehicle). Lateral ventricle
administration was performed in MCAO + miR-207
mimics and MCAO + Vehicles groups at 30 min before
MCAO. Animals were anesthetized with 10% chloral
hydrate, and then rats were placed in stereotaxic
apparatus (RWD Life Science Co., Ltd., 68001).
Subsequently, the miR-207 mimics (100 lM in saline)
(GeneCopoeia
Inc.,
Guangzhou,
China)
were
respectively injected into the left brain lateral ventricle
with 20 min in total volume of 7 ll (Zhao et al., 2013).
Stereotactic coordinates were as follows: anteroposterior,
0.8 mm; mediolateral, 1.5 mm; depth, 3.5 mm. The ipsilateral CBF was measured by Laser Doppler Flowmetry
(BIOPAC Systems, Goleta, CA, USA). The mimics or
negative mimics were considered successful (injection)
only when cerebral blood ﬂow dropped equal baseline
during injection. Furthermore, this blood ﬂow rate was
maintained for at least 20 min.
Assessment of neurological deﬁcit scores and infarct
volume
At post-reperfusion, neurological function was assessed
in sixteen animals by an observer who was blinded to
the experimental conditions. The evaluation of
neurological function was performed using the Modiﬁed
Neurological Severity Score (mNSS) testing approach
(Hernández-Jiménez et al., 2013). The mNSS is composed of a series of motor tests (i.e., muscle status and
abnormal movements), sensory tests (i.e., visual, tactile,
and proprioceptive assessment), balance tests, and reﬂex
tests, and is graded on a composite scale of 0–18. The
higher the mNSS is, and the more severe the injury is.
After assessment of infarct volume, rats (n = 4 per
group) were narcotized by an intraperitoneal (i.p.)
injection of 10% chloral hydrate (100 g/0.3 ml) and
sacriﬁced by decapitation at times after reperfusion.
Frozen brains were coronally sectioned into slices of
1-mm thickness, and stained with 2% 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride monohydrate (TTC, SigmaAl-drich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as described previously

J. Tao et al. / Neuroscience 305 (2015) 1–14

(Lan et al., 2013). Stained slices were scanned by a highresolution digital camera (Cannon sx20; Canon Inc.,
Tokyo, Japan), and the infarct volume was determined
with Motic Med 6.0 System (Motic, China), which was
expressed as the percentage of the total cerebral
ischemia volume.
miRNA expression and mRNA gene expression
Proﬁling Microarrays
Total RNA was extracted from cortical peri-infarct area of
the ipsilateral hemisphere tissue using the TRIzol
Reagent (Life Technologies (AB & Invitrogen), Carlsbad,
USA) and miRNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Dusseldorf,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
which eﬃciently recovered all RNA species, including
miRNAs. RNA quality and quantity was measured using
nanodrop spectrophotometer (ND-1000, Nanodrop
Technologies) and RNA Integrity was determined by gel
electrophoresis. For the mRNA microarray, brieﬂy,
100 ng of total RNA was ampliﬁed following Aﬀymetrix’s
small sample labeling protocol. The protocol uses two
rounds of reverse transcription and in vitro transcription
with a biotin label being incorporated during the second
round of in vitro transcription. Ten micrograms of biotinlabeled and fragmented cRNA was hybridized to
Aﬀymetrix Rat expression 230 2.0 microarrays
(Aﬀymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Three independent
biological replicates were respectively included in the
Sham group and MCAO with 3 days (MCAO + 3d)
group. The microarrays were hybridized, washed and
scanned according to Aﬀymetrix standard protocols. The
quality of the microarray data was assessed by the
consistency of the percent present calls, background
signal, rawQ and noise. The data were imported into
Genespring, (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for
normalization and data analysis. Robust Multi-Array
Analysis (RMA) was used for pre-processing of the raw
CEL ﬁles, and the data were normalized using a global
per chip normalization (normalized to the 50th
percentile) and per gene normalization (normalized to
the median). A twofold diﬀerence in normalized
expression in combination with a Welch t-test was used
to identify diﬀerentially expressed transcripts. The t-test
was performed without an assumption of equal
variances, and discovery rate (FDR) and Benjamini and
Hochberg False multiple testing corrections was used
with a false discovery rate of 0.05.
For the miRNA microarray, brieﬂy, 100 ng of total
RNA, three independent biological replicates were
respectively included in the Sham group and
MCAO + 3d group. After RNA isolation the samples
from the miRCURYä Hy3ä/Hy5ä Power labeling kit
(Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark) was used according to the
manufacturer’s guideline for miRNA labeling. After
stopping the labeling procedure, the Hy3TM-labeled
samples were hybridized on the 7th generation of
miRCURYTM LNA Array (v.18.0) (Exiqon) according to
array manual. Following hybridization, the slides were
achieved, washed several times using Wash buﬀer kit
(Exiqon), and ﬁnally dried by centrifugation for 5 min at
400 rpm. Then the slides were scanned using the Axon

3

GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Axon Instruments,
Foster City, CA, USA). Scanned images were then
imported into GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Axon) for grid
alignment and data extraction. Replicated miRNAs were
averaged and miRNAs with intensities P30 in all
samples were chosen for calculating normalization
factor. Expressed data were normalized using the
Median normalization. After normalization, signiﬁcant
diﬀerentially expressed miRNAs were identiﬁed through
Volcano Plot ﬁltering. Hierarchical clustering was
performed using Multi Experiment Viewer (MEV)
software (v4.6, TIGR, USA). A 1.5-fold diﬀerence in
normalized expression in combination with a Welch
t-test was used to identify diﬀerentially expressed
transcripts. The t-test was performed without an
assumption of equal variances, and FDR and Benjamini
and Hochberg False multiple testing corrections were
used with a false discovery rate of 0.05.
Prediction of miRNA target genes and mRNA
expression integrative analysis
Signiﬁcantly expressed miRNAs (P < 0.05, Fold P1.5
and FDR 6 5%) were used for prediction of target genes
using
Microcosm
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/enright-srv/
microcosm/htdocs/targets/v5/), Miranda (http://www.
microrna.org/microrna/home.do) and Mirdb (http://mirdb.
org/miRDB/) databases. The selection criteria for the
target genes are the genes which are predicted by two
or more databases. Their target genes were performed
for
bioinformatics
analysis
using
Annotation
Visualization Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.7 and
Kyoto Encyclopedia Genes & Genomes (KEGG)
pathways. The selected pathways were plotted
according to the enrichment score and chi-square test
with p < 0.05. The biological networks graph of miRNA
interaction with target mRNAs were manufactured with
Cytoscape v3.0.0 (NIGMS, USA).
Luciferase reporter assay
The psiCHECK2-LAMP2-luc and psiCHECK2-LAMP2Mut-luc ﬁreﬂy luciferase reporter vectors, which contain
the intact or mutated putative miR-207 recognition
sequence from the 30 -UTR of LAMP2, respectively,
cloned downstream of the ﬁreﬂy luciferase gene were
constructed as follows. The following primers were
designed to RT-PCR the 30 -UTR of human LAMP2 from
total RNA extracted from primary cortical neuronal cells.
LAMP2-F1:50 -cuggcuuuaaaaaaAGGAGAAaa-30
LAMP2-R1:50 -ACCCATCTCACCCATTCTTG-30 ;
MutLAMP2-F1:50 -cuggcuuuaaaaaaUCCUCUUaa-30 ;
MutLAMP2-R1:50 -TGACACAGCAACTCCTTTGG-30 .
Each RT-PCR product is about 1 kb, and covers
putative miR-207 recognition sequence or mutated
sequence from the 30 -UTR of LAMP2. Clones were
selected after screening by restriction digestion with
XhoI and NotI. Primary cortical neuronal cells were
seeded in 96-well white assay plates (Corning) at a
density of 30,000 cells per well one day before

transfection. Tennanograms of each reporter construct
was co-transfected with miR-207 mimics or a mimic
negative control (GeneCopoeia Inc., Guangzhou, China)
at a ﬁnal concentration of 100 nM into primary cortical
neuronal cells mediating Lipofectamine 2000 (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. After 48 h, ﬁreﬂy and Renilla
luciferase activities were measured with the Dual-Glo
luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Promega, Madison, USA). Fireﬂy luciferase
activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity for
each sample. The similar method was performed for
validation of miR-352 and Hexb interaction. All
experiments were performed in triplicate and three wells
for each condition.

Transmission electron microscopy
The ﬁxative perfused brain specimens were ﬁxed with the
mixture (5% glutaraldehyde – 10% paraformaldehyde) for
72 h at 4°C then ﬁxed with 1% osmium tetroxide in
cacodylate buﬀer for 2 h at room temperature. After
being washed with PBS, the samples were dehydrated
with the standard step samples and embedded in an
Epon-Araldite 618 mixture. Then the brain was
sectioned into 80-nm modular ultrathin slices and were
stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and
observed with a H70 electron microscope (Hitachi, H800, Tokyo, Japan) operating at 80 kV. The photos were
obtained on a hp digital CCD camera (SIS4million
volex). Images were acquired digitally from a randomly
selected pool of 10–15 ﬁelds under each condition. For
a quantitative analysis of the number of intact
mitochondria, lysosome and autophagosomes, ten ﬁelds
of vision for each rat (three rats in each group) were
examined referring to the following literature (Wu et al.,
2015).
Western blot analysis
The cortical peri-infarct area of the ipsilateral hemisphere
(n = 4 rats per group) was dissected and homogenized in
Radio-Immunoprecipitation Assay (RIPA) lysis buﬀer
(Beyotime Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China), and total
protein was separated by centrifugation at 13,000g for
15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were harvested, and the
protein concentration of each sample was determined
using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Beyotime
Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China). For gel electrophoresis,
samples were separated in 12% sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gels, and separated proteins
were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride
membranes (Millipore, Massachusetts, USA).
After transfer, the membranes were blocked for 2 h
with 5% nonfat milk (BD-Becton, Dickinson and
Company, San Antonio, TX, USA) and incubated
overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies:
rabbit polyclonal anti-LAMP2 antibody (diluted 1:500;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal antiHexb antibody (diluted 1:2000; Abcam). Blots were also
incubated with a primary antibody against b-actin (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), which was employed as an

After three washes, the membranes were incubated for
2 h with species-speciﬁc horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies (diluted 1:5000;
Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA).
The immunoreactive protein bands were detected using
an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Millipore) and
quantiﬁed using Labworks 4.6 image analysis software
(UVP, LLC, Upland, CA, USA).
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR)
Expression levels of mRNA and miRNA were determined
by qPCR. Total RNA was extracted from the cortical periinfarct area of the ipsilateral hemisphere (n = 4 rats per
group) as described above for mRNA gene expression
Proﬁling Microarrays. Extracted total RNA was then
reverse transcribed to generate cDNA according to the
manufacturer’s instructions of Revert AidTM First Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Beijing,
China). The reverse transcription reaction was ampliﬁed
using a Bio-Rad CFX96 Detection System (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA) with the Plexorä One-Step
qRT-PCR System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). For
mRNA and miRNA ampliﬁcation, the following primers
were
used:
LAMP2(RQP049594,
GeneCopoeia,
Guangzhou, China), Apoe(RQP052690, GeneCopoeia),

Statistical analysis
All quantitative data are expressed as the mean ± the
standard error of means (S.E.M) and were analyzed
using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences) 17.0 statistical analysis software (IBM,
Chicago, IL, USA). The data were subjected to a oneway analysis of variance between diﬀerent groups,
followed by the least signiﬁcant diﬀerence t-test. In all
cases, P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
All ﬁnal results were analyzed by observers blinded to
the experimental conditions.

RESULTS
Focal cerebral ischemia models exhibited
spontaneous recovery
Focal cerebral ischemia rat models (n = 9) subjected to
MCAO were sacriﬁced at the 1 d, 3 d and 7 d after
surgery. The neurological deﬁcit was evaluated with
mNSS score for each animal at diﬀerent time points. We
found the maximum score (14.46 ± 0.39) at the postMCAO 1 d and the spontaneous recovery of
neurological score at the post-MCAO 3 d and 7 d
(Fig. 1A). The brain slices of these rats were stained
with TTC and infarct volumes on the ipsilateral region
were measured. The infarct volume peaked at the post-

MCAO 1 d (39.16% ± 2.31%), which had no statistical
signiﬁcance (p > 0.05) compared with that of the postMCAO 3 d. The infarct volume declined to 25.88% on
the post-MCAO 7 d (Fig. 1B).
MiRNA and mRNA expression proﬁling in the cortical
peri-infarct area following ischemic stroke
Microarray-based miRNA and mRNA proﬁling were
analyzed. A total of 198 miRNAs and 2254 mRNAs
showed diﬀerential expression in the cortical peri-infarct
area following MCAO 3 days. However, 24 miRNAs
were fold change of P1.5, and p < 0.05, FDR 6 5%, of
which 17 miRNAs (miR-151-3p, -382-5p, -let-7b-5p,
-207, -30d-5p, -3573-3p, -27b-3p, 330-5p, -222-3p, 34a5p, 30a-5p, -125b-5p, -9a-5p, -27a-3p, 22-3p, -352, and
-100-5p) were down regulated, whereas 7 miRNAs
(miR-532-5p, -1949, -382-3p, -377-3p, -409a-3p, -92b3p, and -879-5p) were up regulated (Fig. 2A). 494
mRNA genes did fall in the statistically signiﬁcant and
were fold change of P2 and p < 0.05, FDR 6 5%, of
which 171 genes were down-regulated, whereas 323
genes were up-regulated (Fig. 2B).
Veriﬁcation of selected genes by quantitative
real-time PCR
To verify the results of the miRNA and mRNA microarray,
quantitative real-time PCR was performed to assess the
expression of selected 14 miRNAs and 10 mRNAs,

and -222-3p were down-regulated and fold change of
P1.5, whereas miR-532-5p, -382-5p, and -409a-3p
were up-regulated and fold change of P1.5 (p < 0.05
or p < 0.01) (Fig. 3A). The expression of LAMP2, Apoe,
Hexb, Arsb, Bcl2, Nxph4, Enc1, and Chga mRNA levels
were down-regulated fold change of P2, whereas Ctse
and Capn3 were up-regulated fold change of P2
(p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) (Fig. 3B).
Integrating miRNA targets and mRNA expression
proﬁles
The signiﬁcantly expressed 17 down-regulated and seven
up-regulated miRNAs were selected for an analysis of
their target genes by online prediction algorithms from
Microcosm, Mirdb and Miranda databases. A total of
2290 target genes were obtained by screening of
genes-predicted appeared in two or more of the above
databases. Among them, 1797 genes were targets of
17-downregulated miRNAs (Fig. 4A). In addition, 493
genes were targets of 7-upregulated miRNAs (Fig. 4B).
Furthermore, integrating databases-based 2290
targets and microarray-based 494 mRNA genes, we

found their intersections included 47 genes, which were
considered as potential targets of miRNAs. Among
them, 34 genes (Mlph, Fkbp9, Hmgn2, Cyp4f5, Apoe,
Arsb, Tspan8, Manba, Csk, Id3, LAMP2, Pctp, Ccr5,
Onecut1, Mfng, Hexb, Map3k1, RT1-CE10, Psmb9,

Arhgdib, Capn3, Ptpn6, Glipr1, Slc7a7, Tac4, Rhbg,
Ctse) expressed up-regulation. In addition, 13 genes
(Bcl2, Cyp11b1, Pcdha13, Hmgcs1, Rims1, Cck, Chga,
Shank1, Dclk1, Kcnb2, Htr2c, Nxph4, Enc1) expressed
down-regulation(Fig. 5A).
Furthermore, the 47 genes were chosen for pathway
analysis. The top four pathways were obtained
according to the fold enrichments scores of P5, which
included lysosome (p < 0.01), neurotrophin signaling
pathway (p < 0.05), other glycan degradation (p < 0.1),
and
glycosaminoglycan
degradation
(p < 0.1),
respectively (Fig. 5B).

A total of seven miRNAs from screening that
were potentially target lysosomal-associated membrane
proteins and enzymes. However, only miR-207
regulated the lysosomal-associated membrane proteins,
whereas six miRNAs regulated the lysosomal enzymes,

the fold change of miR-352 is maximum among them
(5.32 ± 0.23). Therefore, the miR-207 and miR-352
were selected for further potentially functional analysis.
Next, to identify the functions of miR-207 and miR-352
in the progression of ischemic stroke, we detected the
expression of miR-207 and miR-352 in the cortical periinfarct area following post-MCAO 1 d, 3 d and 7 d. The
results showed that the expression of miR-207 and
miR-352 were obviously decreased in the MCAO groups
compared with the Sham group, followed by a slight

stroke (post-MCAO 1 d to 7 d) (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05)
(Fig. 6A). The levels of LAMP2 and Hexb proteins were
progressively decreased (p < 0.05) during post-MCAO
1 d to 7 d (Fig. 6B and C).
MiR-207 and miR-352 regulated their targets in
primary cortical neuronal cells
Firstly, we applied luciferase reporter assay to identify the
interactions of miR-207 and LAMP2, miR-352 and Hexb
in vitro, respectively. The results showed that the miR207 mimics decreased the luciferase activity of LAMP2
30 UTR in the primary cortical neuronal cells (p < 0.05),

but the luciferase activity of LAMP2 mutant 30 UTR
showed no change (p > 0.05) (Fig. 7A). Similarly, the
miR-352 mimics suppressed the luciferase activity of
Hexb 30 UTR, but the luciferase activity of Hexb mutant
30 UTR showed no change (p > 0.05) (Fig. 7B). These
results suggested that miR-207 and miR-352 downregulated the expression of LAMP2 and Hexb proteins.
MiR-207 mimics inhibited the number of lysosome
and attenuated infarct volumes
After 100 lM miR-207 agonist mimics were injected in
lateral ventricle, we found the expression of miR-207
increased signiﬁcantly in the cortical peri-infarct area

following MCAO for 3 days (p < 0.01), whereas the levels
of LAMP2 protein and mRNA all decreased signiﬁcantly
compared to the MCAO + Vehicle group (p < 0.05)
(Fig. 8A, 8B and 8C). In the MCAO + miR-207 mimics
group, the over-expression of miR-207 could inhibit the
number of lysosome and autolysosome, and increase
the number of autophagic vacuole, and repair the
structure of mitochondria ridges (Fig. 8D). In addition,
the miR-207 mimics ameliorated the neurological deﬁcit
scores and infarct volumes of MCAO rats (p < 0.05)
(Fig. 8E and 8F).

DISCUSSIONS
The present study identiﬁed diﬀerentially expressed 24
miRNAs and 494 genes in the cortical peri-infarct area
of cerebral ischemic rats using high-throughput
technologies. Integrating miRNA and mRNA expression
proﬁles, we found 47 direct targets of miRNAs, which
involved in lysosome, neurotrophin signaling pathway,
other glycan degradation and glycosaminoglycan
degradation using signaling pathway analysis. Among
them, the lysosomal pathway-related molecules included
lysosomal membrane proteins LAMP2 and lysosomal
enzymes Hexb, et al. Furthermore, in vitro, the
luciferase reporter assay suggested that miR-207 and
miR-352 down-regulated the LAMP2 and Hexb proteins
in primary cortical neuronal cells. In vivo, they were
mainly downregulated after ischemic stroke, followed by
a slight return to baseline during stroke recovery (postMCAO 1 d to 7 d). The levels of LAMP2 and Hexb
proteins were progressively decreased (p < 0.05)
during post-MCAO 1 d to 7 d. In addition, it is more
important that miR-207 agonist mimics could inhibit the
number of lysosomes and autolysosomes, and increase
the number of autophagic vacuoles, and repair the
structure of mitochondria ridges.
Ischemic stroke accounts for more than 80% of all
stroke cases and has a high morbidity and mortality
worldwide (Donnan et al., 2008). Stroke induces neurogenesis and spontaneous recovery in the ischemic boundary regions (Parent et al., 2002; Nudo, 2007). Animal
studies have also provided evidence of spontaneous
recovery from stroke (Marson et al., 2008). Furthermore,
Lu et al. have also shown that infarct volume reaches a
maximum at 24-h reperfusion and reduces gradually
thereafter (Lu et al., 2004). In our study, we also have
found that neurological function with mNSS score and
infarct volume reached a maximum post-MCAO 1 d and
reduced gradually during post-MCAO 1 d to 7 d.
However, the molecular mechanisms of ischemic
stroke-induced brain damage and spontaneous recovery
remain not well known. MiRNAs are known to
play important roles in cerebral physiological and
pathological processes, including neuronal development,
apoptosis, proliferation and diﬀerentiation (Liu et al.,
2013a,b; Meza-Sosa et al., 2014). Studies have demonstrated that miRNAs regulate neuronal death and survive
in the progression of ischemic stroke (Nielsen et al., 2009;
Liu et al., 2011). In the present study, we found that 24
miRNAs were fold change of P1.5 and p < 0.05,

expression proﬁles, we found their intersection included
47 genes. Furthermore, we identiﬁed the 47 genes
involved in main signaling pathways that included lysosome, neurotrophin signaling pathway, other glycan
degradation, and glycosaminoglycan degradation using
bioinformatics-based signaling pathways analysis. The
lysosome pathway has been selected for further studies
due to its fold enrichment scores of P5 and p < 0.01

which was optimum in pathways-predicted. The lysosome
pathway-related miRNAs were associated with their
respective targets in terms of algorithms in bioinformatics,
including miR-207-LAMP2, miR-125b-Arsb, miR-30aCsk, miR-222-Ctse, miR-330-Ctsh, miR-352-Hexb, miR382-Manba. However, only miR-207 regulated the
lysosomal-associated membrane proteins, whereas six
miRNAs regulated the lysosomal enzymes, the fold
change of miR-352 is maximum among them
(-5.32 ± 0.23). Therefore, the miR-207 and miR-352
were selected for further potentially functional analysis.
MiRNAs were involved in lysosome or lysosomalautophagy pathway in the central nervous system is
less reported in publications of the world. Lysosome is

an important organelle in autophagy, which is
responsible for the degradation of macromolecules
derived from the extracellular space through
endocytosis or phagocytosis, as well as from the
cytoplasm through autophagy. Autophagy is a
homeostatic process whereby autophagosomes deliver
cytoplasmic components and organelles to lysosomes.
Xing et al. have shown lysosomal activity in the
ipsilateral thalamus after cortical infarction following
post-MCAO 7 d and 14 d (Xing et al., 2012). The role of
lysosomal pathway as a mediator of cell death has been
suggested in some pathological conditions and some
forms of neuronal cell death (Puyal and Clarke, 2009;
Kesidou et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014). Qin et al. found

12

E

Fig. 8 (continued)

that the number of lysosomes was increased to promoting
cell death at the 6 h in both permanent MCAO and OGD
injury. Simultaneously, the LAMP2 and the lysosomal
enzyme cathepsin B were markedly up-regulated in astrocyte cells at 6 h after OGD injury (Qin et al., 2010). In vivo,
we found the expression of LAMP2 and lysosomal
enzyme Hexb were progressively decreased in the cortical neurons of peri-infarct area following post-MCAO 1 d
to 7 d. Therefore, our and other studies suggested the

lysosomal pathway-related LAMP2 protein played an
important role in cerebral ischemic stroke.
However, few reports have shown that miR-224,
miR-373⁄ and miR-379 negatively regulated LAMP2
in neuroblastoma cells (Alvarez-Erviti et al., 2013). In
the present study, we demonstrated miR-207 downregulated the expression of target LAMP2 in primary
cortical neuronal cells using bioinformatic analysis and
luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, through lateral

13

ventricle injection with miR-207 agonist mimics, we found
that the miR-207 mimics could attenuate the neurological
deﬁcit scores and infarct volumes of MCAO rats.
Simultaneously, it reduced the number of cellular
lysosomes and autolysosomes, whereas increased the
number of autophagic vacuoles. The results indicated that
miR-207 aﬀected the latter part of lysosomal-autophagy
ﬂux with unknown mechanism. A previous report
suggested that miR-207 was a neurotrophin in primary
cortical neuronal cells, which suppressed cell apoptosis
in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) insult (Li et al., 2013;
Montalban et al., 2014). However, it is well-known that cell
apoptosis is associated with mitochondria function. In the
present study, we also found that miR-207 mimics could
repair the structure of mitochondria ridges. Therefore,
miR-207 regulated apoptosis whether also via LAMP2
regulation of lysosomal-autophagy pathway in the cortical
peri-infarct area remains to be determined. In present
study, the miR-207 mimics protected against neurological
deﬁcits and cerebral infraction at the post-MCAO 3 d via
inhibition of the lysosomal membrane protein, but the
long-term eﬀects of miR-207 mimics remain unclear and
need further study.

CONCLUSIONS
Integrating miRNA and mRNA expression proﬁles, we
demonstrated that miR-207 and miR-352 negatively
regulated LAMP2 and Hexb, respectively. They were
downregulated after ischemic stroke, followed by a
slight return to baseline during post-MCAO 1 d to 7 d. In
addition, miR-207 mimics can reduce the number of
cellular lysosome and autophagosome, whereas
increase the number of autophagic vacuoles in the

cortical peri-infarct area accompanied by the improved
neurological
deﬁcits
and
cerebral
infraction
performances.
