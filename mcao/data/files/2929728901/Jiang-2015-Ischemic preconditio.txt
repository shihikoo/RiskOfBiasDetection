autophagy inhibitor) and then were subjected to IPC induced
by a 10-min middle cerebral artery occlusion. Afterward, the
brain AMPK activity and autophagy biomarkers were measured. At 24 h after IPC, permanent cerebral ischemia was
induced in these rats, and infarct volume, neurological deficits
as well as cell apoptosis were evaluated 24 h later. We demonstrated that IPC activated AMPK and induced autophagy in
the brain, which was accompanied by a reduction of infract
volume, neurological deficits, and cell apoptosis after cerebral
ischemia. Meanwhile, the IPC-induced autophagy was
inhibited by compound C while the neuroprotection of IPC
was abolished by compound C or 3-MA. These findings
suggest that AMPK-mediated autophagy contributes to the
neuroprotection of IPC, highlighting AMPK as a therapeutic

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is one of the major causes of disability and
death worldwide, which lacks effective treatment currently
[1]. In recent years, mounting evidence suggests that cerebral
ischemic preconditioning (IPC), which consists of transient
episodes of subthreshold ischemic insult, induces a low level
of energy stress in the brain and increases the tolerance to
subsequent fatal ischemic exposure [2–5]. Although the neuroprotection of IPC has been successfully validated in several
species [6–8], the underlying mechanisms are still not fully
understood thus far.
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an evolutionarily
conserved serine/threonine kinase, which plays a crucial role
in regulating the homeostasis of cellular energy in the whole

221

body [9]. It can be phosphorylated and activated in response to
an increase in the intracellular AMP-to-ATP ratio during
glucose deprivation, hypoxia, or ischemia and maintains cellular energy by suppressing ATP consumption as well as
stimulating ATP generation [10, 11]. Although emerging evidence indicates that AMPK can be activated by IPC in
peripheral organs and exerts beneficial effects as a potential
mediator of ischemic metabolic adaptation [12–15], the information regarding the role of brain AMPK in cerebral IPC is
still limited thus far.
As a conserved process participating bioenergetic management by degrading and recycling cellular constituents, autophagy has been recently proposed as a downstream target of
AMPK. Previous studies indicated that activation of AMPK
was able to induce autophagy and subsequently conferred
protective effects against ischemic injury in the heart, liver,
kidney, and muscular tissues [16–21]. However, the role of
autophagy in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia is still
controversial and inconclusive [22]. Several studies showed
that activation of autophagy after the onset of stroke exacerbated ischemic neuronal injury [23, 24]. Conversely, accumulating evidence indicated that pre-activation of autophagy in
the brain remarkably enhanced tolerance against ischemic
injury, as it facilitated cellular energy production, limited
endoplasmic reticulum stress, and prevented neuronal apoptosis during subsequent fatal ischemic exposure [25, 26]. In the
current study, we tested the hypothesis that IPC activated
AMPK and subsequently induced autophagy in the brain. In
addition, we investigated the role of AMPK-dependent autophagy in the neuroprotection of IPC in a rat model of
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO).

Materials and Methods
Animals
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (3 months old, obtained from the
Experimental Animals Center of Nanjing Medical University)
were housed in a standard animal room with a 12-h light/dark
cycle and given free access to food and water. All animal
experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Management Committee of Qingdao Municipal Hospital and were
carried out in accordance with the NIH Guidelines for Care.
Drug Administration and Experimental Groups
Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) and 3-methyladenine (3MA, an autophagy inhibitor) were obtained from SigmaAldrich Inc and were dissolved in saline for injection. The
dose (20 mg/kg) and administration route (intraperitoneal
injection) for compound C were chosen based on previous

studies from our group and McCullough et al. [27, 28]. On
consideration of the adverse effects of 3-MA when administrated intraperitoneally, we therefore directly injected it into
the right lateral cerebral ventricle as described [29]. The dose
(200 nmol) for 3-MA (intracerebroventricular injection) was
determined according to previous studies from our group and
Sheng et al. [25, 28]. It should be noted that treatment with
compound C or 3-MA at the doses used did not significantly
influence physiological parameters including PaCO2, PaO2,
and blood pressure in rats (data not shown). The detailed
experimental protocol was indicated in Fig. 1.
Induction of IPC
IPC was induced as described by Sheng et al. [25]. First, rats
were anesthetized with 10 % chloral hydrate (3.5 mL/kg; i.p.).
It is should be noted that choral hydrate is not a preferred
anesthetic for experimental stroke. The right common carotid
artery, external carotid artery (ECA), and internal carotid
artery (ICA) were isolated through a ventral midline incision.
A 30-mm length of nylon filament (Φ 0.26 mm), with its tip
passivated by heating near a flame, was inserted from the right
ECA into the lumen of ICA, and then advanced to the Circle
of Willis to occlude the origin of the right middle cerebral
artery. IPC was induced by a transient cerebral ischemia of
10 min duration. After induction of IPC, the suture was gently
withdrawn to permit reperfusion. Afterward, the ECA was
ligated and wounds were carefully closed with suture.
Western Blotting
At an indicated time after IPC induction, rats were sacrificed
under deep anesthesia. The cerebral cortex from the right
hemisphere of each rat was homogenized and the total proteins were extracted by RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime Inc.).
Different samples with an equal amount of protein were
separated on 8–12 % SDS polyacrylamide gels, transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked in 5 % BSA powder
in 1× Tris buffered saline (TBS) with 0.1 % Tween 20 (1×
TBST) at room temperature for 2 h. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a mouse monoclonal antibody
against p-AMPK (Thr172) (1:600; Cell Signaling Technology
Inc.), AMPK (1:800; Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), pacetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACA, A major downstream target
of AMPK activation) (Ser79) (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), ACA (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology Inc.),
microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) (1:1,000;
Sigma-Aldrich Inc.), and P62 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology Inc.); then washed with 1× TBST; and incubated with
HRP-coupled secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature.
After washing, protein bands were detected with chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Thermo Scientific Inc.) for 5 min at

The signal intensity of the primary antibody binding was
analyzed using Quantity One software 4.6.2 (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) and normalized to a loading control β-actin

further incubated with 0.5 mg/mL 4,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) for 10 min. After that, the sections were
washed with PBS and sealed with a coverslip. The slides were
analyzed with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus Inc.).
Transmission Electron Microscopic Examination

Immunofluorescence Analysis
Immunofluorescence analysis was carried out as previously
described [29, 30]. Twenty-four hours after IPC induction, rats
were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with
phosphate buffer saline (PBS), followed by a solution containing 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were removed
and post-fixed in 4 % PFA solution overnight. After
dehydrated in alcohol, the brains were embedded in paraffin
and cut into 4–5 μm sections. Afterward, the sections were
deparaffinized, hydrated in distilled water, treated with 3 %
H2O2 for 10 min to remove endogenous peroxidase activity,
and washed again with PBS. Sections were then permeabilized with 0.1 % Triton X-100 for 10 min, blocked with
10 % normal goat serum for 2 h at room temperature, and
incubated in the primary antibodies against LC3 (1:250,
Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) 4 °C for 24 h. The sections were rinsed
with PBS and sequentially incubated respectively with
TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IGG (1:1,000, Beyotime Inc.)
in a humidified container for 1 h at 37 °C. The sections were

The transmission electron microscopic examination was performed as previously described [29–31]. Briefly, the brain
tissue was sliced into small sections, immersed in 1 % osmium
tetroxide for 2 h, dehydrated in graded ethanol, and then
embedded in epoxy resin. Afterward, these selections were
cut into ultrathin sections (60–70 nm) with an ultramicrotome,
post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and
then subsequently examined under a transmission electron
microscope.
pMCAO
Twenty-four hours after IPC induction, rats were anesthetized
with 10 % chloral hydrate (3.5 mL/kg; i.p.) again. The incision
was re-opened and the nylon filament was re-inserted into the
lumen of ICA through the stump of ECA to induce permanent
cerebral ischemia. The filament remained there until the rat
was killed. Induction of pMCAO was considered successful if
a >80 % reduction in rCBF was observed in the core region of

223

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 51:220–229

the MCA territory after occlusion. Throughout the procedure,
body temperature was closely monitored with a rectal probe
and maintained in the range of 37.0±0.5 °C with a heating pad.
Rats in the sham-operated group were subjected to the filament
insertion into the ICA but with no reduction in blood flow.
2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium Chloride (TTC) Staining
TTC staining was performed to evaluate the infarct volume by
investigators who were blinded to the experimental groups.
Twenty-four hours after pMCAO, rats were killed under deep
anesthesia, and the brains were rapidly removed and then
sectioned coronally into five 3-mm-thick slices using a rat
brain matrix. The slices were immersed in the dark staining
with 2 % TTC for 30 min and then fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde. The infarct volume was evaluated by Image ProPlus 5.1 analysis system (Media Cybernetics Inc.) using
Swanson’s method which corrects for edema [32].
Terminal-Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-Mediated Nick End
Labeling (TUNEL)
Twenty-four hours after pMCAO, rats were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with PBS, followed by a
solution containing 4 % PFA. Brains were removed and
TUNEL was performed by using a cell death detection kit
(Roche Inc.) as previously described [33]. Cells labeled with
green fluorescence in the peri-infarct region were identified as
TUNEL-positive cells. Cell counting was performed on three
randomly selected nonoverlapping fields in the peri-infarct
region of the cerebral cortex per slide by observers who were
blinded to the experimental groups. Data obtained in every
field were added together to make a final data count for each
slide and expressed as percentage of total cell numbers (staining with DAPI).

independent sample t test and one- or two-way ANOVA
followed by least significant difference post hoc test. For
neurological deficits, the Mann–Whitney U test was used for
comparisons between two groups. The mortality of rats after
pMCAO was assessed with the chi-squared method. With the
exception of mortality and neurological deficit, the data are
expressed as mean ± SD. P<0.05 was considered significant.

Results
IPC Activated AMPK and Induced Autophagy in the Brain
Rats were sacrificed at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after IPC, and the
ratios of p-AMPK (Thr172)/AMPK as well as protein levels of
LC3-II in the cerebral cortex of the right hemisphere were
assessed by western blotting. As indicated in Fig. 2a, b, the
ratio of p-AMPK (Thr172)/AMPK changed in a monophasic
manner: significantly increased from 6 h, peaked at 12 h,
started to decrease from 24 h, and returned to the baseline
value at 48 h. This observation suggested an upregulation of
AMPK activity within 48 h after IPC. Meanwhile, as indicated
in Fig. 2a, c, LC3-II levels change in a similar pattern: began
to increase from 6 h, peaked at 24 h, and started to decrease
from 48 h. This finding was validated by immunofluorescence
analysis using an anti-LC3 antibody with higher selectivity for
LC3-II, as rats subjected to IPC showed higher LC3-II immunoreactivity than sham-operated rats in the cerebral cortex of
the right hemisphere (Fig. 2d). In addition, transmission electron microscopic examination detected autophagosomes with
a double-membrane structure in the brain of IPC-treated rats
(Fig. 2e), further suggesting the induction of autophagy within
48 h after IPC.

Neurobehavioral Testing
Neurobehavioral tests were performed at 24 h after pMCAO
using a five-point scale [34] by observers who were blinded to
the experimental groups: 0, rats extended both forelimbs
toward the floor when gently suspended 1 m above the floor
and with no other signs of neurological deficit; 1, rats consistently flexed the forelimb contralateral to pMCAO; 2, rats
circled toward the contralateral side when the tail was pulled;
3, rats spontaneously circled toward the contralateral side
when allowed to move freely; and 4, no spontaneous movement with an apparent depressed level of consciousness.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by the SPSS software 16.0.
Statistically significant differences were evaluated by an

To investigate the role of AMPK in IPC-induced autophagy,
rats were injected with a single dose of compound C
(20 mg/kg; i.p.) 5 min before IPC. Twenty-four hours after
IPC, the p-AMPK (Thr172)/AMPK and p-ACC (Ser79)/ACC
ratios in the cerebral cortex of the right hemisphere were
analyzed by western blotting. The inhibition of compound C
on IPC-induced AMPK activation was shown in Fig. 3a–c. As
demonstrated in Fig. 3d, e, compound C significantly attenuated the IPC-induced increase in LC3-II by 53 %, and this
finding was further confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 3g). Meanwhile, the reduction in P62 levels caused
by IPC was also reversed by compound C pretreatment
(Fig. 3d, f). Additionally, transmission electron microscopic
examination showed a decreased number of autophagosomes
with a double-membrane structure after compound C pretreatment (Fig. 3h). It should be noted that compound C itself did

not significantly affect the basal activity of AMPK or autophagy, as p-AMPK (Thr172)/AMPK ratio and LC3-II level in the
brain of sham-operated rats stayed unchanged after injecting
with a single dose of compound C (data not shown).

At 24 h after pMCAO, infarct volume, cell apoptosis, and
neurological deficits were evaluated by TTC staining,
TUNEL, and Benderson neurobehavioral tests, respectively.
IPC significantly reduced the infarct volume following subsequent pMCAO by 26 % (Fig. 5). Meanwhile, IPC also ameliorated cell apoptosis in the peri-infarct region, as the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was markedly reduced by
IPC (Fig. 6a, 17.4 vs 24.8 % of the total cell numbers,
P<0.05). In addition, IPC significantly attenuated neurological deficits in rats subjected to pMCAO [Fig. 6b, median of
the pMCAO group—2, median of the IPC+pMCAO group—
1, P<0.05].

IPC Decreased Infarct Volume, Neurological Deficits,
and Cell Apoptosis After pMCAO
Twenty-four hours after IPC, rats were subjected to pMCAO.
This time point was determined according to the above results,
which showed that autophagic activity in the brain peaked at
24 h after IPC induction.
As shown in Fig. 4, seven rats died before completion of
the experiment and were excluded from the study. Postmortem
examinations did not reveal the occurrence of intracerebral or
subarachnoid hemorrhage in any of these animals, and no
significant differences were found among the mortality of
each group.

single dose of compound C (20 mg/kg; i.p.) or 3-MA
(200 nmol; i.c.v.) 5 min before IPC. The inhibitory
effect of 3-MA on IPC-induced autophagy had been
confirmed by western blotting (Fig. S1). Twenty-four
hours after IPC, rats were subjected to pMCAO. Infarct
volume and neurological deficits were evaluated by
TTC staining and Benderson neurobehavioral tests, respectively, at 24 h after pMCAO. As demonstrated in
Fig. 5, the IPC-induced reduction in infarct volume was
abolished by pretreatment with either compound C or 3-MA.
In accordance to this finding, the Benderson neurobehavioral
tests demonstrated that the attenuation in neurological
deficits caused by IPC was reversed by compound C or
3-MA (Fig. 6b). Of note, compound C or 3-MA alone at
the current dose did not exacerbate the stroke outcome
(data not shown).

Discussion
The major finding of the present study is that IPC induced
autophagy via an AMPK-dependent pathway, which subsequently decreased infract volume, cell apoptosis, and neurological deficits caused by ischemic stroke (Fig. 7). As a
heterotrimeric serine/threonine kinase, AMPK plays an important role in the regulation of cellular and whole body
energy homeostasis [9]. It can be phosphorylated and activated in response to an increase in the intracellular AMP/ATP
ratio under stress condition and maintains energy by suppressing ATP consumption as well as stimulating ATP generation
[10, 11]. Emerging evidence suggests that IPC leads to the
activation of AMPK in peripheral organs. In the heart, several
studies showed that the p-AMPK/AMPK ratio was significantly increased after IPC, suggesting an upregulation of
AMPK activity [13]. In the liver, Peralta and colleagues
revealed that IPC led to the activation of AMPK, which
subsequently protected against hepatic ischemia-reperfusion
injury [12]. These observations implied that AMPK might act
as a mediator of ischemic metabolic adaptation, mediating
downstream protective signaling of IPC in the peripheral
organs. In the current study, we found that IPC upregulated
p-AMPK/AMPK ratio in rat brain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing that IPC led to the
activation of brain AMPK.
Another exciting finding of this study is that activation of
AMPK induced by IPC led to an enhancement of autophagy.
Meanwhile, the enhancement of autophagy can be fully
abolished by inhibition of AMPK, indicating that IPC remarkably enhanced brain autophagy in an AMPK-dependent pathway. These findings were consistent with a recent study from
our group, which showed that activation of AMPK via

227

metformin, a well-known hypoglycemic drug, led to the enhancement of autophagy in rat brain [28]. Meanwhile, our
observations were also supported by previous findings in
peripheral tissues. In cardiomyocytes from diabetic OVE26
mice, pharmacological activation of AMPK led to the activation of autophagy, which protected against diabetic cardiomyopathy [16]. In a recent study from Pauly et al., administration
of AICAR, an established activator of AMPK, resulted in a
significant upregulation of autophagy in muscles from mice
with Duchenne muscular dystrophy [21]. Moreover, Wang
and colleagues found that activation of AMPK led to the
upregulation of autophagic activity in tubular cell of the
kidney [18]. It is worthy to note that AMPK can activate
autophagy via multiple signaling pathways. Several lines of
evidence suggest that AMPK activation enhanced autophagy
via inhibition of mTOR, a conserved Ser/Thr kinase that
negatively regulates autophagy [35]. Meanwhile, recent studies indicated that AMPK could enhance autophagy by directly
phosphorylating ULK1 [36]. The precise pathway by which
AMPK activated autophagy in the brain should be further
investigated by future studies.
The most important finding of this study is that AMPKmediated autophagy in the brain contributed to the neuroprotection of IPC, since IPC-induced reduction of infarct volume,
neurological deficits, and cell apoptosis was completed reversed by inhibition of AMPK or autophagy. These findings
strongly supported the hypothesis that pre-activation of brain
autophagy could protect against subsequent permanent cerebral ischemia [25, 26]. The mechanisms for this protection are
that IPC-induced autophagy can restore adequate intracellular
ATP and amino acids by degradation of cellular proteins,
lipids, and glycogen granules, which increases the tolerance
of neurons to lethal ischemic exposure [37]. In addition to
facilitating cellular energy production, autophagy also provides a mechanism for efficient use of these substrates via
the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria [38]. Aside from
its prosurvival mechanisms, activation of autophagy by IPC
retards cell apoptosis by suppressing excessive endoplasmic
reticulum stress and inflammation response during subsequent
permanent ischemia [26, 39]. Interestingly, in contrast to the
beneficial role during ischemia, induction of autophagy
seemed to deteriorate neuronal damage during the reperfusion
phase [29, 40]. This was further reinforced by a previous study
from Matsui and colleagues, which showed that autophagy
induction was protective during the ischemia period, whereas
it was detrimental during reperfusion in a myocardial ischemia
model [17]. The contradictory role of autophagy in ischemia
and reperfusion might be attributed to the differences in the
pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying these two phases.
This study also has some limitations. For example, we used
an autophagy inhibitor 3-MA to determine whether AMPKmediated autophagy contributed to the neuroprotection of IPC
in this study. In fact, 3-MA has multiple effects that are

228

independent of its inhibition on autophagy, which would
potentially influence cellular function and signaling [41].
Meanwhile, a recent study from Wu et al. showed that 3MA could promote autophagy under a particular condition
[42]. Hence, future studies using autophagy inhibitors with
greater specificity are needed to validate our findings.
In conclusion, our data shows that IPC induces brain autophagy in an AMPK-mediated pathway, which subsequently
reduces infract volume, cell apoptosis, and neurological deficits caused by pMCAO. These findings support the hypothesis that pre-activation of autophagy is protective in ischemic
diseases and highlight AMPK as a therapeutic target for stroke
prevention and treatment.
