Ischemia induces different levels of hypoxia
inducible factor-1α protein expression in
interneurons and pyramidal neurons
Prabhu Ramamoorthy and Honglian Shi*

Abstract
Introduction: Pyramidal (glutamatergic) neurons and interneurons are morphologically and functionally well
defined in the central nervous system. Although it is known that glutamatergic neurons undergo immediate cell
death whereas interneurons are insensitive or survive longer during cerebral ischemia, the protection mechanisms
responsible for this interneuronal survival are not well understood. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) plays an
important role in protecting neurons from hypoxic/ischemic insults. Here, we studied the expression of HIF-1α, the
regulatable subunit of HIF-1, in the different neuronal phenotypes under in vitro and in vivo ischemia.
Results: In a primary cortical culture, HIF-1α expression was observed in neuronal somata after hypoxia (1% oxygen)
in the presence of 5 or 25 mM glucose but not under normoxia (21% oxygen). Interestingly, only certain
MAP2-positive neurons containing round somata (interneuron-like morphology) co-localized with HIF-1α staining.
Other neurons such as pyramidal-like neurons showed no expression of HIF-1α under either normoxia or hypoxia.
The HIF-1α positive neurons were GAD65/67 positive, confirming that they were interneuron-type cells. The HIF-1α
expressing GAD65/67-positive neurons also possessed high levels of glutathione. We further demonstrated that
ischemia induced significant HIF-1α expression in interneurons but not in pyramidal neurons in a rat model of
middle cerebral artery occlusion.
Conclusion: These results suggest that HIF-1α protein expression induced by ischemia is neuron-type specific and
that this specificity may be related to the intracellular level of glutathione (GSH).

Introduction
Neurons can be classified into three major groups, pyramidal neurons responsible for glutamate release, interneurons with round cell bodies responsible for γ–aminobutyric
acid (GABA) release, and spiny interneurons with small cell
bodies that can release both glutamate and GABA. Interestingly, ischemia-mediated vulnerability differs among neuronal subpopulations. Interneurons are resistant to ischemia
in striatum, cortex, and hippocampus, whereas pyramidal
neurons undergo immediate cell death under certain ischemic conditions [1-8]. However, the molecular mechanism
for neuronal type-specific resistance to ischemia is not well
understood.
Hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a transcriptional
factor that plays a critical role in cellular adaptation to

low oxygen levels. It is a heterodimer consisting of two
subunits, α and β. HIF-1β is constitutively expressed; the
oxygen level has no effect on its expression. The protein
level of HIF-1α is highly regulated by oxygen tension [9].
Thus, the activity of HIF-1 is primarily determined by
the expression of the subunit HIF-1α and not that
of HIF-1β. During hypoxia, HIF-1α is stabilized, translocates to the nucleus, binds to HIF-1β, and initiates
transcription. HIF-1 plays an important role in neuroprotection against ischemia by upregulating various
growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and erythropoietin. It has been shown that HIF-1α
knockdown increases brain injury in a mouse model of
transient focal cerebral ischemia [10]. Inhibition of proline hydroxylase (PHD), an enzyme that initiates the
degradation of HIF-1α, protects against glutamateinduced damage in the rat hippocampus [11]. Moreover,
it has been reported that HIF-1α expression can vary in

different cells. For example, its stability and degradation
is regulated in a cell-type-specific manner in carcinoma
cell lines [12]. The expression of HIF-1α differs in hepatoma and primary endothelial cells due to different degradation mechanisms [13]. Degradation occurs mainly in
the cytosol in HEPG2 cells and in both cytosol and nucleus in mouse brain endothelial cells [13]. Previous data
from our laboratory demonstrate that HIF-1α stability
requires a reducing environment during ischemia and
that increases in glutathione (GSH) levels stabilize
HIF-1α in cortical neurons [14], indicating that protein
levels of HIF-1α may vary among cells with different
redox statuses.
We hypothesized that HIF-1α was expressed differently
in pyramidal neurons and interneurons during hypoxic
conditions. To test this hypothesis, we studied and compared the cell-type-specific expression of HIF-1α in
pyramidal neurons and interneurons in a primary cortical
neuronal culture exposed to hypoxia and an animal model
of cerebral ischemia. We demonstrated that, under ischemic conditions, HIF-1α expression was remarkably stable
in interneurons when compared to pyramidal neurons.
HIF-1α stability in interneurons was consistent with an
increase in intracellular GSH levels, suggesting that interneurons contain a highly reducing environment that
maintains HIF-1 stability and expression during ischemia.

Materials and methods
Isolation of neurons

Primary neuronal cultures of cerebral cortices were obtained from Sprague–Dawley (SD) rat brains (postnatal
day 0 [P0] to P3). Cultures were prepared according to
Brewer et al. [15] with slight modifications. Whole cerebral cortices were dissected and then incubated for
50 min in 0.12% trypsin at 37°C. After the incubation,
cells were washed completely with Hank’s balanced salt
solution (HBSS) four times and dissociated with a firepolished glass pipette in dissociation medium (HBSS,
0.1% BSA and 8 mM MgCl2), pelleted by centrifugation
at 4000 g for 4 min at room temperature (RT), dissociated in starter medium (DMEM containing 10% FCS)
and plated on coverslips. Coverslips were pretreated by
incubation with poly-D-lysine (0.01%) for 1 hour (hr),
then rinsed with sterile distilled water four times and
dried before the cells were plated. Cultures were kept at
37°C in 5% CO2 for 1 hr, flooded with starter medium
and incubated overnight at 37°C in 5% CO2. After
24 hrs, the medium was replaced with culture medium
(Neurobasal plus 2 mM glutamine and B27 supplement). Every 4-6 days, half of the medium was replaced
with fresh culture medium. After 12-18 days of in
vitro culture (DIV), neuronal cells were used for the
experiments.

In vitro hypoxia or cobalt chloride (CoCl2) treatment

Neuronal medium was removed and replaced with fresh,
serum-free experimental medium (DMEM) containing 0,
5, or 25 mM glucose. For normoxia, neurons were incubated under 21% oxygen at 37°C for 3 hrs. For hypoxia,
cells were maintained with 1% O2/5% CO2 balanced with
N2 at 37°C for 3 or 5 hrs. Incubation periods were
selected based on our previous studies [14]. Expression
of HIF-1α was observed in the cultured neurons after
3- and 5-hr hypoxic treatments, and further studies were
performed only with 3-hr hypoxic treatments. For CoCl2
treatment, cortical neurons were incubated with 0.3 mM
CoCl2 at 37°C for 3 hrs under normoxic conditions [16].
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)

Male SD rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington,
MA, USA) weighing between 250 g and 280 g were used
in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and with approval from the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Middle cerebral ischemia/reperfusion was conducted according to the method
of Longa et al. (1989), with some modification. Briefly, the
right common carotid artery, including its bifurcation, was
dissected, and the external carotid artery was divided,
leaving a stump of 3–4 mm. The internal carotid artery
was isolated, and the stump of the external carotid artery
was reopened, and a 4.0 monofilament nylon suture with
a slightly enlarged and rounded tip (Doccol Cooperation,
Redlands, CA, USA) was inserted 17 mm through the
internal carotid artery. Reperfusion was initiated by
withdrawal of the filament at 90 min after occlusion. After
surgery, the animals were allowed to recover from
anesthesia while being given food and water ad libitum.
Successful MCAO models were confirmed by 2, 3,
5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining (Figure 1) and by
behavioral observation according to Rogers’ scales [17].
In vitro immunocytochemistry

Immunocytochemistry was performed as described by
Ramamoorthy et al. [18]. Briefly, cortical neurons were
washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at RT.
Fixed cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized
using 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at RT and
incubated with blocking solution (PBS containing 0.05%
Triton X-100 and 0.25% BSA) for 30 min at RT. Then,
neurons were incubated with specific primary antibodies
overnight at 4°C. Cells were washed with blocking solution for 4 × 15 min and incubated with an appropriate
secondary antibody for 90 min at RT in the dark. Coverslips were washed with blocking solution and mounted
with the temporary mounting medium Vectashield H
1000 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescent intensity was quantified with Image-Pro Plus 5.1

(Media Cybernetics). We randomly selected several cell
free areas and calculated mean intensity as background
intensity. We then determined fluorescent intensity in
neuronal soma in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The
background intensity was subtracted from neuronal
HIF-1α intensity. Changes in HIF-1α intensity caused by
hypoxia were normalized to the normoxic level.
In vivo immunocytochemistry

Rat brain was dissected after 90 min MCAO and 24 hr
reperfusion. In vivo fixative was performed with 4%
paraformaldehyde cardio perfusion. Then, brains were
soaked in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at RT and
30% sucrose for 48-72 hr at 4°C. Then, the brain was
frozen using ice cold isopentane or liquid nitrogen for
2-3 min. Coronal brain sections were prepared from
frozen brain sample using a cryostat. Slices were stained
as described previously [18] with slight modifications.
Briefly, after brain slices were washed with PBS and fixed
(4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at RT) for 90 min, fixative
was removed, and slices were washed with PBS and
permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS overnight at
RT. Slices were incubated in blocking solution (PBS
containing 2% BSA) overnight at 4°C and incubated for
48 hrs at 4°C with a primary antibody. Slices were
washed in blocking solution for 15 min × 4 times and
incubated with a secondary antibody for 4 hrs at RT.
After washing, the slices were mounted in the temporary
mounting medium Vectashield H1000. Control experiments were performed by omitting the primary antibody
and incubating with secondary antibody alone.
Primary antibodies used were goat anti-HIF-1α (1-100;
sc-8711; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-HIF-1α

(1-1000; 04-1006; Millipore Bioscience), mouse antiHIF-1α (1-200; NB-100-123; Novus Biological), mouse
anti-MAP2 (1:200; MAB378; Millipore Bioscience) and
rabbit anti-GAD65/67 (1-400; AB1511; Millipore Bioscience). Secondary antibodies were donkey anti-goat
Alexa 488 (1-100; Molecular Probes), goat anti-rabbit
Alexa 488 (1-100; Molecular Probes), goat anti-mouseFITC (1-50; Santa Cruz), donkey anti-mouse TRITC
(1-50; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and donkey anti-rabbit
DyLight 549 (1-2,500; Rockland). For double-staining experiments, antibodies were applied sequentially, starting
with the anti-HIF-1α antibody. For antibody specificity,
goat anti-HIF-1α antibody was incubated with HIF-1α
blocking peptide (1-100; Santa Cruz) at RT for 2 hrs
before staining the neurons for HIF-1α. Control experiments showed no significant bleed-through of the fluorescent labels or cross-reactivity between antibodies. As
marked in Figure 1, the peri-infarct tissues in the ipsilateral cortex and the corresponding area in the contralateral cortex were selected as areas of interest. Images
were obtained with a Leica DMI4000 microscope with a
40X objective and a Leica DFC340 FX Digital camera,
using Leica LAS AF software. For quantification, the
intensity of HIF-1α in the neuronal soma was randomly
counted using MAP2- or GAD65/67-positive cell bodies.
Fluorescent intensity was determined as described above.
GSH staining

GSH was detected by using monochlorobimane (MCB) as
reported by Chatterjee et al. [19]. Briefly, after hypoxic
treatments, 0.1 mM of MCB was added directly to the
neuronal petri dish and incubated for 20 min at 37°C.
After the incubation, neurons were fixed and stained for
specific neuronal markers using the method described
above. The staining process was performed in the dark.
MCB-GSH was visualized at an excitation wavelength of
380 nm and an emission wavelength of 480 nm using a
fluorescence microscope. For quantification, MCB-GSH
intensity was calculated for the neuronal soma. As it is impossible to measure MCB-GSH intensity in the same neurons before and after hypoxic treatments, different plates
of neurons were treated with normoxia and hypoxia.
Fluorescent intensity was determined as described above.
Cell death

Dead or unhealthy neurons were counted visually by
assessing morphological damage with the cytoskeletal protein MAP2 [20]. Healthy cells were identified by intact
somata and processes, unhealthy cells were differentiated
by swelling or bulging in the MAP2-positive processes
and dead neurons were identified by disruption/breakdown in the MAP2 staining in both the cell body and
processes.

Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05.

Results
HIF-1α stability after hypoxia/ischemia is neuron-typespecific

Earlier studies have demonstrated that hypoxia/ischemia
induces HIF-1α expression in cortical neurons. However,
the cortical region of the brain contains multiple neuronal types with different survival rates during ischemia.
We initially asked two questions. First, do all types of
cortical neurons express HIF-1α in ischemia? Second, do
only the surviving neurons express HIF-1α in ischemia?
To address these questions, we examined the expression
of HIF-1α in cultured cortical neurons exposed to
hypoxia/ischemia. Under normoxic conditions, both

Page 4 of 10

round-soma-like and pyramidal-like neurons showed intact somata and processes; as expected, no expression of
HIF-1α was seen (Figure 2A). Under hypoxic conditions,
significant expression of HIF-1α was only observed in
certain MAP2-positive neurons. Interestingly, all the
neurons that expressed HIF-1α possessed round somata.
This phenomenon was seen when cells were cultured in
5 or 25 mM glucose under 1% oxygen (Figure 2A’). The
neurons with a pyramidal-like morphology showed no
significant HIF-1α expression and had swollen somata
and bulging/broken processes in both 5 and 25 mM
glucose after hypoxia. Furthermore, when the neurons
were treated with 0 mM glucose for 3 hrs, almost all the
MAP2-positive neurons showed swelling or breakdown
in their processes (unhealthy/dead) under normoxic
conditions (data not shown). For further confirmation of
the high expression of HIF-1α in the neurons with
round somata, these experiments were repeated using
cobalt chloride (CoCl2) treatment, a HIF-1α inducer.
CoCl2-induced HIF-1α expression was found in the

Figure 2 HIF-1α expression in primary cortical neurons exposed to hypoxia/ischemia. A & A’) Neurons were double-stained for HIF-1α and
MAP2 in the presence of 5 and 25 mM glucose with and without hypoxia. HIF-1α expression in the somata was observed in cells with interneuron-like

neurons that contained round somata (Figure 2B, bottom panel) but not those with pyramidal-like morphology (Figure 2B, upper panel). Analysis of the total
intensity of HIF-1α-immunoreactive (ir) neurons with
round somata showed 3.0- and 3.5-fold increases in
response to 5 mM and 25 mM glucose under hypoxia,
respectively (Figure 2C).
To further confirm these findings, we examined HIF1α expression in different neurons in the cortex of a rat
MCAO model. Double staining of HIF-1α and MAP2 in
coronal brain slices revealed that not all MAP2-ir
neurons expressed HIF-1α in the cortical area. Similar to
our observation in primary cultures, neurons with a
round-soma-like morphology showed HIF-1α-ir in the
ipsilateral region (open arrow), but no HIF-1α staining
was observed in the contralateral region (Figure 2D). In
addition, neurons with a pyramidal-like morphology
showed no HIF-1α expression (Figure 2D solid arrow),
confirming the in vitro data.
The above results demonstrated that the neuronal
subpopulation containing round somata with intact cell
bodies expressed HIF-1α under hypoxia. To assess neuronal survival under these conditions, we quantified the
neurons subjected to in vitro ischemia using MAP2-ir
staining. Neurons were divided into three categories:
1) intact cell body and processes (viable cells), 2) swollen
cell body with swollen processes (unhealthy or dead), and
3) disrupted cell body and broken processes (dead). Under
normoxia, 80-90% of neurons were viable in the presence
of either 5 mM or 25 mM glucose, but in the presence of
0 mM glucose, the proportion of viable neurons dropped
to 10%. When exposed to 1% oxygen, 70-80% of neurons
were unhealthy or dead after 3 hrs in 5 or 25 mM glucose
concentrations. There was no significant difference between normoxia and hypoxia when the cells were exposed
to 0 mM glucose (Table 1). Further neuronal experiments
were performed only with 25 mM glucose.

GAD65/67-positive neurons express HIF-1α following
hypoxia/ischemia

To confirm that the round-soma neurons that expressed
HIF-1α under hypoxia were GABAergic neurons, we
double-stained neuronal cultures with antibodies against
HIF-1α and GAD65/67 (interneuronal marker). As shown
in Figure 3, under normoxia, neurons did not express
HIF-1α, regardless of their GAD65/67 expression. Some
neurons showed co-localization of HIF-1α and GAD65/67
under hypoxic conditions. No GAD65/67-negative cells
were HIF-1α-ir whereas most GAD65/67-positive cells
were HIF-1α-ir under hypoxia. We then quantified the
percentage of HIF-1α-ir neurons showing coexpression of
GAD65/67. These results demonstrated that 35-40% of
GAD65/67-ir neurons were HIF-1α-ir (Figure 3B). For
further confirmation, we co-stained brain slices from the
rat model of MCAO with HIF-1α and GAD65/67 antibodies. These data demonstrated that HIF-1α-ir neurons
co-localized with GAD65/67-ir neurons (Figure 3C, 1). It
is noteworthy that not all GAD65/67-ir neurons in the
brain slices expressed HIF-1α (Figure 3B, 2). These results
confirmed that HIF-1α expression was specific to interneurons and that not all cortical interneurons expressed
HIF-1α after ischemia.
GSH stabilizes HIF-1α in interneurons after
hypoxia/ischemia

We have previously reported that redox status plays an
important role in HIF-1α expression in cortical neurons
[14]. We postulated that GSH might play a role in regulating HIF-1α expression in different types of neurons. We
therefore used MCB staining to evaluate levels of GSH in
pyramidal neurons and interneurons exposed to hypoxia.
Figure 4A shows that MCB-GSH intensity was equally
expressed in all MAP2-ir neurons under normoxia.
Interestingly, neurons with pyramidal-like morphology
had less MCB-GSH staining under hypoxia than under
normoxia. Neurons with interneuron-like morphology
showed higher MCB-GSH staining in MAP2-ir neurons
than the neurons with pyramidal-like somata after exposure to hypoxia. To confirm whether this increase in
MCB-GSH was co-localized with GAD65/67 neurons, we
stained the neurons for GAD65/67 after MCB treatments
with and without hypoxia. Some of the GAD65/67-ir neurons showed an increase in the MCB-GSH signal under
hypoxia compared to normoxia (Figure 4B, open arrow).
GAD65/67-negative neurons with pyramidal-like somata
showed reduced MCB-GSH staining during hypoxia
(Figure 4B, lower panel, solid arrow). The inset in
Figure 4B shows a phase-contrast image to confirm that
the GAD65/67-negative neuron had a pyramidal-like
soma. We then examined whether the neurons with an
increase in MCB-GSH also expressed HIF-1α. This was
done by co-staining the neurons with HIF-1α and

GAD65/67 after MCB treatment. Normoxic neurons,
including the GAD65/67-positive cells, did not show
HIF-1α-ir, (Figure 4C, upper panel). Following hypoxia,
neurons showed HIF-1α expression only in GAD65/67-ir
neurons containing high levels of MCB-GSH (Figure 4C,
middle panel and line profile). Interestingly, not all
GAD65/67-ir neurons had increased levels of MCB-GSH
under hypoxia. Quantification of the data revealed that
almost 35-40% of GAD65/67-ir neurons were HIF-1α-ir
and possessed high levels of MCB-GSH (Figure 4D).
Furthermore, inhibition of GSH synthesis by buthionine
sulfoximine (BSO) reduced the overall MCB-GSH intensity and suppressed HIF-1α expression in all GAD65/67-ir
neurons exposed to hypoxia (Figure 4C, bottom panel).
Quantitative data indicated that when the MCB-GSH level
was reduced to 30-40% with BSO, the expression of
HIF-1α in GAD65/67 positive neurons was completely
inhibited (Figure 4E). These results suggest that differences in the level of GSH may be responsible for different levels of HIF-1α expression in hypoxic interneurons
and pyramidal neurons.

Discussion
The present study demonstrates for the first time that
HIF-1α expression is cell-type-specific among cortical
neurons in response to hypoxic/ischemic insults. Specifically, certain interneurons express a significantly higher
level of HIF-1α protein than pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, the present results reveal that reduction in the
GSH level might play a role in decrease in the HIF-1α
level of the interneurons.
Previous reports have shown that the two major classes
of neurotransmitter-containing neurons, pyramidal neurons and interneurons, are differentially affected during
ischemia [3,21]. Consistent with these reports, our results
demonstrate that hypoxia induces swelling in the somata
or disruption of processes in pyramidal neurons. In contrast, the interneurons show intact somata and processes
during hypoxia. Pyramidal neurons and interneurons have
different mechanisms for buffering intracellular calcium
during hypoxia [22,23]. Interneurons contain specific
calcium-binding proteins (e.g., parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin (CaBP)) to regulate intracellular calcium for the

survival of these cells [24,8]. Because calcium is a critical
damaging factor in ischemic neuronal death, these
calcium-binding proteins might contribute to interneuronal survival. However, Freund et al. found that there
was no consistent and systematic relationship between
neuronal CaBP or PV content and ischemic vulnerability
[25]. They and Crain et al. demonstrated that the majority
of supragranular pyramidal cells that contained CaBP
were the pyramidal cells most frequently degenerating
after ischemia [26,25]. In contrast, the density and distribution of non-pyramidal cells, mainly interneurons, containing CaBP or PV appeared qualitatively unchanged
after ischemia [25,26]. In addition, Larsson et al. have reported that increased neurotrophin signaling may provide
neuroprotection in ischemic interneurons [27]. Our results clearly demonstrate that among the cortical neurons,

GAD65/67-positive neurons, but not pyramidal neurons, express HIF-1α following hypoxia. These results
indicate a novel pathway that may contribute to the
resistance of interneurons to ischemia. Consistent with
this concept, HIF-1 has been found to regulate transcription of the NTRK2 gene, which stimulates neurotrophin signaling [28].
It is worth noting that CoCl2 treatments also induce
significant expression of HIF-1α in interneurons, whereas
minimal expression is seen in neurons containing pyramidal-like somata and apical dendrites with intact cell
bodies and processes. The dose of CoCl2 used in the
present experiments does not cause cell death in either
interneurons or pyramidal neurons. This indicates that
the expression of HIF-1α in hypoxic interneurons is not
necessarily a result of cell survival.

Many factors can regulate HIF-1α protein stability in an
oxygen-independent manner. For example, heat shock
protein 90 can stabilize HIF-1α, and receptor for activated
kinase C (RACK1) can lead to HIF-1α ubiquitination and
degradation [29]. Calcium might regulate HIF-1α expression in ischemic neurons. However, the available results
are controversial or contradictory to each other. Calcineurin, a calcium-dependent protein phosphatase, may promote HIF-1α expression by de-phosphorylating RACK1
[30]. In contrast, it has been reported that lowering
the intracellular calcium concentration activates HIF-1
through inhibition of hydroxylation of HIF-1α [31]. Unlike
these results, Salnikow et al. reported that elevation of
intracellular calcium neither induced the expression of
HIF-1α protein nor stimulated HIF-1-dependent transcription [32]. However, Mottet et al. argued that elevated
calcium levels after prolonged hypoxia increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) activation
and increased HIF-1 transcriptional activity but did not
induce HIF-1α accumulation [33]. Our results clearly
show that GSH can stabilize HIF-1α protein in ischemic
neurons. This is consistent with previous reports that
HIF-1α can be strongly regulated by the redox environment [34-36], a mechanism that is of particular importance in the setting of ischemic brain injury because of the
intrinsic changes in redox status. Although a more oxidizing environment has been suggested to stabilize HIF-1α
in non-neuronal cells [37,38], there is strong evidence
supporting that a more reducing environment stabilizes
HIF-1α, such as in COS7 cells [39], HeLa cells [40],
HepG2 cells [41], MCF-7 cells [34], salmonid cells [42],
renal medullary interstitial cells [43], and primary cultured
neurons [14]. Reactive oxygen species can increase the
activity of both 26S and 20S proteasomal degradation
pathways under hypoxic conditions [44,45]. Thus, it is
highly possible that the presence of high levels of GSH
decreases the activity of the 20S and 26S pathways and
stabilizes HIF-1α protein in interneurons. Based on this
discussion, GSH may not be the only factor contributing
to HIF-1α expression in the two neuronal types. Other
antioxidants that are able to reduce reactive oxygen species in the neurons may also contribute to the stabilization
of HIF-1α protein.
The exact mechanism by which hypoxic interneurons
maintain higher levels of GSH than hypoxic pyramidal
neurons remains unclear. However, the following mechanisms may be involved. First, interneurons may generate
lower amounts of free radicals than pyramidal neurons in
hypoxia/ischemia. It is well established that ischemia
causes excess free radical generation, mainly via mitochondrial dysfunction caused by excessive calcium. Interneurons can have lower levels of NMDA receptor activity
by inhibiting Cys-299 of the NMDA receptor subunit
NR2A [46]. This inactivation of glutamate receptors

reduces the intracellular calcium and thus reduces free
radical generation. Second, interneurons may have an enhanced defense system against oxidative stress. Interneurons have an enhanced and more efficient thioredoxin-2
system in detoxifying hydrogen peroxide, compared to
pyramidal neurons [47]. Enhanced expression of antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase and Bcl-2 has been
observed in ischemic interneurons [46]. In addition, the
presence of nitric oxide may also help interneurons reduce
free radical generation and protease activity [48,46].
Overall, both low levels of free radical generation and
enhanced levels of antioxidants may spare GSH in hypoxic
interneurons.

Conclusion
We report here that expression of HIF-1α is mainly
detected in interneurons during hypoxia/ischemia. High
levels of GSH in interneurons may play a role in maintaining the cellular environment for the expression of
HIF-1α. These results provide essential information for
understanding the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia.
