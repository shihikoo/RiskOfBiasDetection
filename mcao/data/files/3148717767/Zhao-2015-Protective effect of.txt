reperfusion. The neuroprotective effects of rhGLP-1 (7–36) were evaluated by changes in
neurological deﬁcit scores and 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Changes
in blood glucose were used to assess hypoglycemic effects. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase
(GSH-PX), inducible nitric oxide syntheses (iNOS) and endothelial nitric oxide syntheses
(eNOS) after MCAO/R administration (2 h and 46 h) were examined to investigate the
possible mechanisms of RhGLP-1 (7–36). Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used
for histopathological observation. Compared with the control group, rhGLP-1 (7–36)-treated
groups decreased nerve function deﬁciency scores; signiﬁcantly reduced infarction volume
percentage, MDA, iNOS and blood glucose; and signiﬁcantly increased SOD, GSH-PX and
eNOS. In addition, rhGLP-1 (7–36) groups enhanced the density of surviving neurons and
increased vascular proliferation. The current study suggests a neuroprotective effect of
rhGLP-1 (7–36) in diabetic MCAO/R rats since anti-oxidative and anti-nitrosative stress
effects can contribute to beneﬁcial effects against ischemia/reperfusion injury.

Introduction

Stroke is the third leading cause of death and paralysis
worldwide and remains a serious challenge to public health
due to its high incidence and life threatening nature (WHO,
2004; Feigin et al., 2014). Close to 60–70% of strokes are
ischemic strokes (Silvestrelli et al., 2002). In addition to
hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, diabetes is another
important risk factor for strokes, especially in patients less
than 65 years of age (Kissela et al., 2005; Lawes et al., 2004;
Towﬁghi et al., 2012). Despite the fact that many mechanisms
leading to cell death during ischemia/reperfusion brain injury
have been identiﬁed in the past decades such as excitotoxicity, calcium dysregulation, oxidative and nitrosative stress,
and inﬂammation (Moskowitz et al., 2010), the underlying
mechanisms are not yet well understood. Recombinant tissue
plasminogen activator rt-PA (alteplase) is the only treatment
approved by the FDA since it has been shown to improve
functional outcomes in randomized trials of patients treated
soon after acute ischemic stroke. However, due to its short
therapeutic window, it is not widely used (Wardlaw et al.,
2012). As a result, developing new treatments and drugs for
ischemia stroke patients is increasingly important.
The glucagon-like peptide-1 (7–36) amide (GLP-1) is a
member of the proglucagon family of incretin hormones
secreted mainly by the enteroendocrine cells of the intestine
in response to the presence of nutrients. GLP-1 and its
analogs facilitate glucose-induced insulin release, suppress
glucagon secretion, slow gastric emptying and suppress
appetite by activating the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), which is
widely expressed in islet cells, the kidney, lungs, brain and
gastrointestinal tract (Dunphy et al., 1998; Lund et al., 2014).
As a result, analogs of GLP-1 have been developed for the
treatment of type 2 diabetes. Endogenous GLP-1 is rapidly
inactivated by cleavage of the NH2-terminal dipeptide by the
widely expressed serine protease dipeptydil peptidase-IV
(DPP-IV) (Meier et al., 2006). Thus, long-acting GLP-1 analogs
have been developed to prolong the effect by changing the
structure of the peptide. Exenatide is the ﬁrst GLP-1 analog
approved by the FDA for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
(Diamant et al., 2014). The absence of amidation of the NH2terminal is the main difference between recombinant human
glucagon-like peptide-1 (7–36) amide rhGLP-1 (7–36) and
endogenous GLP-1. It has been reported that stimulating the
GLP-1 receptor can protect neurons against metabolic and
oxidative insults; as a result, it can be used for the treatment
of stroke and Parkinson's disease (Li et al., 2009; Perry et al.,
2007). In addition, previous studies have suggested that after
ischemia/reperfusion, the expression of GLP-1R protein signiﬁcantly increases, and GLP-1R agonists protect against
ischemia-induced neuronal death possibly by increasing
GLP-1R expression and attenuating microglia activation
against transient cerebral ischemic damage (Lee et al.,
2011). Furthermore, experiments have shown that GLP-1R
agonists have neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia
models, possibly through anti-oxidative effects and increased
intracellular cAMP levels (Sato et al., 2013; Teramoto et al.,
2011). The aim of the current study was to investigate the
protective effects of rhGLP-1 (7–36) on diabetic rats with

ischemia/reperfusion damage to the brain and to explore
the mechanisms responsible.

Results

2.1.

Effects on neurological deﬁcits

After MCAO for 2 h and then followed 46 h reperfusion, the
diabetic rats showed characteristics of circling and rotating to
the left when crawling, falling to the left side when standing,
and even not walking spontaneously. The neurological status
was assessed using a 5-point scale. Sham-operated diabetic
rats showed no neurological symptoms, as indicated by a
neurological status score of zero. As shown in Fig. 1, the
nimodipine and rhGLP-1 (7–36) groups had higher neurological status scores and showed improvements in neurological
deﬁciencies compared to the model group receiving a high
dose of rhGLP-1 (7–36): the best results, although no statistically signiﬁcant different, were found in the low and middle
rhGLP-1 (7–36) groups. These results indicate that both
nimodipine and rhGLP-1 (7–36) reduced neurological dysfunction following diabetes combined with MCAO/R and showed
dose-related alleviation in the rhGLP-1 (7–36) groups.

2.2.

Effects on cerebral infracted volume

As shown in Fig. 2A, normal brain tissue was deep stained red
and the infarcted brain tissue was stained white, large
infarction areas were presented in the model group whereas
no infarctions were observed in the sham group. As seen in
Fig. 2B, we know that compared with the model group, the
nimodipine and rhGLP-1(7–36) groups showed signiﬁcantly
reduced infarction volume percentages during MCAO/R injury
and the rhGLP-1 (7–36) high group showed the best protective
effects of all groups.

Biochemical observations

2.3.1.

Blood glucose observations

As presented in Table 1, there were no statistically signiﬁcant
differences in the various groups prior to injection of the
drugs. Thirty minutes following injection, blood glucose
levels varied in the reduced rhGLP-1 (7–36) groups: the
rhGLP-1 (7–36) middle group showed a decreasing trend with

no statistical signiﬁcance and the rhGLP-1 (7–36) high group
showed a statistical signiﬁcance reduction (Po0.05) compared with the model group, while blood glucose levels were
elevated in the nimodipine group.

2.3.2.

Effects on levels of MDA, SOD and GSH-PX

Table 2 shows a signiﬁcantly increased presence of MDA and
reduced activity of SOD and GSH-PX in the model group

model group after MCAO/R.

density of the surviving neurons and increasing vascular proliferation (Fig. 3c, d, e, and f).

3.
2.3.3.

The data in Table 3 indicate that the activity of iNOS was
signiﬁcantly higher and the activity of eNOS was signiﬁcantly
lower in the other groups compared with the sham group.
Nimodipine signiﬁcantly lowered iNOS activity compared
with the model group, and the rhGLP-1(7–36) dose required
to suppress iNOS activity in the high group was the best.
Meanwhile, levels of eNOS were signiﬁcantly increased in the
nimodipine group, and rhGLP-1 (7–36) at doses of 40 and
80 μg/kg signiﬁcantly upregulated levels of eNOS compared
with the model group (Po0.01).

Discussion

Effects on levels of iNOS and eNOS

Histological observations

H&E staining was used to observe histological features and
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury regions mainly located in
hippocampus, frontoparietal cortex, striatum and preoptic areas.
Representative histological photographs are shown in Fig. 3. As
shown, no histological abnormalities were observed in the sham
group, while the model group showed that most neurons in the
infarct core appeared shrunken and contained eosinophilic
cytoplasm and triangulated pyknotic nuclei with many vacuolars
in the neuron space. The infarct core was surrounded by necrotic
neurons that exhibited pyknotic shapes and condensed nuclei in
the peri-infarct zones (Fig. 3b). Compared with the model group,
the nimodipine and rhGLP-1 (7–36) groups were able to improve
the structure of the cerebral cortex, thereby enhancing the

GLP-1 is secreted by the L-cells of the intestine in response to
food intake. Many studies have shown that GLP-1 can stimulate
the release of insulin in a glucose-dependent manner (Choi and
Lee, 2011; D'Alessio et al., 1995). GLP-1 is also thought to play a
role in the proliferative and anti-apoptotic action on pancreatic
β-cells and intestinal epithelial cells, respectively; it also inhibits
gastric emptying and acid secretion (Ma et al., 2014). Recently,
GLP-1 analogs were found to have protective effects on heart
ischemia/reperfusion damage (Hausenloy et al., 2013; Salling
et al., 2012). In the current study, we demonstrated that rhGLP1 (7–36) could induce neuroprotection by attenuating infarction
volume and by improving neurologic function in a diabetic
combined MCAO/R rat model. The protective effects of rhGLP-1
(7–36) at 80 μg/kg were more potent than those at 20 and 40 μg/
kg, showing a dose response tendency.
Oxidative stress is a key pathological factor in brain
ischemic/reperfusion injuries. It is involved in the cytotoxic
consequences of mismatches between the production of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals and the ability
of cells to defend against them (Ying and Xiong, 2010). ROS's
include oxygen-centered radicals with unpaired electrons
such as the superoxide anion O2 and the hydroxyl radical
OH or covalent molecules such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).

Fig. 3 – Representative histopathology photographs of brain tissue in diabetic rats after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in
different groups (H&E  100). (a) Sham group; (b) model group. Signiﬁcant reversal of injury was observed in the nimodipine
group (c), the rhGLP-1 (7–36) low group (d), the rhGLP-1 (7–36) middle group (e), and the rhGLP-1 (7–36) high group (f).
SOD detoxiﬁes O2 to H2O2, which is converted to H2O by
catalase or GSH-PX (Chan, 2001). Oxidative stress can also be
assessed by measuring the oxidized products of macromolecules such as lipids. Lipid peroxides are derived from
unstable polyunsaturated fatty acids and decompose to form
a complex series of compounds such as MDA. Cerebral
ischemia can cause signiﬁcant amounts of MDA formation
in the ischemia hemisphere (Chen et al., 2009). Measuring the
content of SOD, MDA and activity of GSH-PX in the brain
cortex can show damage levels during the ischemia/reperfusion progress. In the current study, rhGLP-1 (7–36) signiﬁcantly reduced MDA content and increased the activity of
SOD and GSH-PX compared with the model group, indicating
that rhGLP-1 (7–36) inhibited the oxidative stress response
process. Nitric oxide (NO) is an important reactive nitrogen
species that has also been demonstrated to play an important
role in ischemic brain injury. Excessive NO can produce
toxicity in nerve cells in the form of free radicals (Zhao
et al., 2005). NO generated from neuronal nitric oxide syntheses (NOS) is known to exist in three isoforms: nNOS, iNOS
and eNOS. The major regulator of vascular tone is the
endothelium through endothelial NOS (eNOS). nNOS and
inducible iNOS enzymes are expressed in neurons, glial cells
and vascular myocytes, and can contribute to NO production
in ischemic processes (Tajes et al., 2013). In the current
research, dose-related rhGLP-1 (7–36) to suppress the activity
of iNOS in the high group had the best outcomes, and levels
of eNOS were signiﬁcantly increased in rhGLP-1 middle and
high groups compared with the model group. In addition,
iNOS activity was signiﬁcantly greater and eNOS activity was
signiﬁcantly lower in other groups compared with the sham
group; this implies that although rhGLP-1 showed beneﬁts to
brain ischemia/reperfusion injuries, it was still worse than
the sham group. These results show that the effects of rhGLP1 (7–36) on cerebral I/R injuries in diabetic rats could be involved
in regulating iNOS and eNOS activities.

In conclusion, results of the above experiments indicate
that rhGLP-1 (7–36) can decrease blood glucose and protect
the brain from ischemia/reperfusion damage by anti-oxidative
stress and anti-nitric oxide damage in diabetic/MCAO/R rats.
Speciﬁcally, rhGLP-1 (7–36) can dose-dependently reduce blood
glucose, thereby signiﬁcantly improving neurological function
and reduce infraction size two hours after ischemia followed
by 46-hour reperfusion. Additionally, it improved the activities
of SOD, GSH-PX, eNOS and enhanced the density of surviving
neurons and increased vascular proliferation. Anti-oxidant
and anti-nitric oxide damage appears to be a basic and
essential mechanism of the neuroprotective effects of rhGLP1 (7–36). These results suggest that rhGLP-1 (7–36) could be a
promising therapeutic drug for the treatment of diabetes
combined with ischemic cerebrovascular disease. However,
the mechanisms of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injuries are
varied. rhGLP-1 could also play a role in neuroprotection by
other mechanisms. As such, further research is required.

Experimental procedures

4.1.

Animals

Male pathogen free Sprague Dawleys rats (80–120 g) obtained
from the Animal Center of the Academy of Military Medical
Sciences, Beijing, China were housed in a light- (12 h light/
dark cycle) and temperature-controlled (21.5–22.5 1C) environment. The animals and experimental procedures used
were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Peking University People's Hospital (NO: 2011-66).

4.2.

Reagents and chemicals

TTC and STZ were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (Saint
Louis, USA), nimodipine injection was purchased from By-

158

brain research 1602 (2015) 153–159

er Schering Pharma AG (Beijing, China), lyophilizing rhGLP-1
(7–36) powder was manufactured by Shanghai Huayi BioTechnology Co., ltd., (Shanghai, China) and was diluted in
saline to 0.2 mg/ml. The kits for biochemical analysis, including MDA, SOD, GSH-PX, iNOS and eNOS were purchased from
Beijing Fangcheng Bio-Technology Co., Ltd (Beijing, China).
The high-fat diet consisted of standard ﬂour (17.5%), soy ﬂour
(10.0%), bran (7.0%), corn ﬂour (12.0%), ﬁshmeal (2.5%), salt
(0.5%), yeast extract (0.5%), lard (15.0%), sucrose (10.0%), milk
powder (5.0%), sesame oil (5.0%), eggs (10.0%) and peanuts
(5.0%).

4.3.

Diabetic and brain ischemia/reperfusion model

After being fed a high-fat diet for four weeks, rats were given
STZ (30 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. Tail vein blood samples
were obtained to detect fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels;
an FBG Z11.1 mmol/L conﬁrmed diabetic rats (Srinivasan
et al., 2005). In order to conﬁrm the successful induction of
type 2 diabetes-like symptomatology, we also detected the
Lee's index, the HOMA insulin resistance index (HOMA IR),
the HOMA insulin sensitivity index (HOMA ISI), the levels of
total cholesterol (TC), free fatty acid (FFA) and triglyceride
(TG) as reference indexes, more details was attached as
supplementary data (Appendix 1). Next, the diabetic rats
were monitored for blood glucose levels for at least two
weeks to ensure the stability of the animal model. Then,
the middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R, 2/
46 h) model was induced using the intraluminal suture
method. Body temperature was maintained at 3770.5 1C
during and shortly after surgery with a heating lamp. First,
diabetic rats were anaesthetized by chloral hydrate (10%,
0.3 ml/kg). Next, the carotid and external carotid arteries
were ligatured and the internal carotid artery was temporarily closed. A ﬁshing line (0.24–0.26 mm diameter) was
advanced through the internal carotid artery to the origin of
the middle cerebral artery. After that, the carotid artery was
ligatured to prevent the nylon line from falling off. Finally,
the wound was closed and the animal was placed in its cage.
After two hours of occlusion, the line was withdrawn and the
diabetic rats were injected with drugs intraperitoneally.

4.4.

Groups

Rats were randomly divided into the following groups: the
sham-operated group (n¼ 6), the MCAO/R with saline injection group (n¼ 6), the MCAO/R with nimodipine treatment
group (nimodipine, 1 mg/kg weight; n¼ 6), and MCAO/R groups
with low (20 μg/kg), medium (40 μg/kg), and high (80 μg/kg)
rhGLP-1 (7–36) (n¼6). It should be noted that the sham group
was operated with the same surgical procedure except that the
nylon line did not reach the origin of the middle cerebral artery.

4.5.

Assessment of neurological deﬁcit scores

Neurological symptoms after the animals woke up (ischemia
for 2 h) and after 46 h of reperfusion were assessed using
neurological deﬁcit scores (grades 0–4), which were modiﬁed
as described previously (Longa et al., 1989). Neurological
evaluation was scored on a 5-point scale: 0¼ no neurological

deﬁcit; 1¼ failure to extend the left forepaw fully; 2 ¼circling
to the left; 3¼ inability to bear weight on the left; and 4 ¼no
spontaneous walking with depressed level of consciousness.
The neurological deﬁcits were evaluated by two independent
observers blinded to the surgery. Differences in neurological
deﬁcit scores between animal wake up and after 46 h reperfusion were used to evaluate the efﬁcacy of different groups.

4.6.

Evaluation of infarct volume by TTC staining

To analyze infarct volume, rats were sacriﬁced after 46 h
reperfusion. Brains were removed rapidly and frozen at
20 1C for 10 min. Then the brains were sliced into six
coronal slices of about 2 mm thick. Brain slices were immediately stained with 2% TTC solution at 37 1C for 30 min. The
staining images were recorded by a digital camera and
quantiﬁed by ImageJ software. Total infract volumes were
calculated by summation of the infarct area in six brain slices
and integrated by thickness. The percentage of total infraction was calculated as total infarct volumes of six brain
slices/total brain volume  100%. Both surgeon and image
analyzer operator were blinded to the treatment given to
each animal.

4.7.

Biochemical analysis

Before and after 30 min of injection of drugs, rat vein blood
was used to detect blood glucose. Rats were sacriﬁced and
their brains rapidly removed after being assessed for neurobehavior; the ischemia cortex was dissected and stored at
20 1C for analysis. Samples were homogenized with phosphate buffer (PBS, pH¼ 7.4) to a concentration of 10%. The
content of MDA, GSH-PX and the activity of SOD, iNOS and
eNOS were determined using commercial assay kits according to manufacturer instructions (Beijing Fangcheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) method.

4.8.

Histopathology

The brains of the ﬁve groups were ﬁxed with 10% formalin,
embedded in parafﬁn wax and cut into longitudinal sections
of 5 μm thickness. The sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histopathological observation.

4.9.

Statistical analysis

SPSS 16.0 was used to calculate the variance among groups.
Data were expressed as mean7S.D. One-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by Least Signiﬁcant Difference
tests were performed. Signiﬁcant differences were accepted
when P was o0.05 or o0.01.

Conﬂict of interest
The authors have declared that there were no conﬂicts of
interests.
