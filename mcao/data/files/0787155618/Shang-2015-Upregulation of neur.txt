Abstract. Neuroglobin (NGB) is a recently identified protein,
which is localized in the neurons and retinal cells of the
central and peripheral nervous systems in vertebrates. It is
hypothesized to function as a scavenger for reactive oxygen
species, or as a stress‑responsive sensor for signal transduction
in hypoxic‑ischemic brain insults. However, the mechanism
underlying the physiological function of this protein remains
to be elucidated. In the present study, the profiling of changes
in the serum redox index of morphological features of the
hippocampus and cortex, and of the expression of NGB and
hypoxia‑inducible factor‑1α (HIF‑1α), are described in a rat
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. The necrotic
zone of the rat neural tissues increased in size with increasing
reperfusion time, and different brain slices exhibited necrosis
in different regions. The number of NGB‑positive hippocampal
and cortical cells, as well as NGB and HIF‑1α transcript and
protein levels in the ischemic cortex, increased with increasing
reperfusion time. NGB and HIF‑1α mRNA and protein levels
peaked in the group that received reperfusion at 32 h after
MCAO. These findings indicated that HIF‑1α may be involved
in ischemic pathology in an MCAO model and that NGB
expression may be upregulated. Serum superoxide dismutase
(SOD) activity decreased and serum malondialdehyde (MDA)
levels increased with increasing reperfusion time, indicating
that the redox potential increased following MCAO. Serum
SOD and MDA measurements may, therefore, be useful as
biomarkers for the early detection of ischemic injury in a
clinical setting.

Introduction
Neuroglobin (NGB) was identified and initially described by
Burmester et al in 2000 (1). This recently identified protein
is expressed in the tissues of the nervous system, including
those of the retina  (2). It is a member of the hemoglobin
superfamily and is a significant ischemic‑hypoxic biomarker
for brain injury (3‑5). An increase in the expression of NGB
under hypoxic conditions exhibits a neuroprotective function
in vitro and in vivo (6‑8). The oxygen‑binding properties of
NGB are comparable to those of typical vertebrate myoglobin,
suggesting a similar function for NGB in the brain  (9‑11).
Previously, NGB upregulation in the murine brain following
forebrain ischemia, has been demonstrated following carotid
artery occlusion (12). However, compared with extensive brain
ischemia, focal cerebral ischemia, such as basal nucleus infarction, is more frequently observed in clinical settings (13).
Consequently, the determination of whether NGB
is upregulated during focal ischemia, and whether such
upregulation exerts a neuroprotective effect near the ischemic
penumbra, was important. Furthermore, a primary objective
of the present study was to identify upstream proteins, which
exhibit ischemia‑induced changes in expression. In addition,
the variation in serum redox index values in focal brain
ischemic cases was of interest, such as those for superoxide
dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA), as this may
indicate oxygen radical‑induced lipid peroxidation during
hypoxic‑ischemic encephalopathy, thereby providing an index
of neuronal damage and recovery. The present study was
designed to characterize changes in the expression of NGB
and other ischemia‑regulated proteins in brain tissue, as well
as to profile serum redox indices in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia following reperfusion for different time periods.
Materials and methods
Animals. The present study was approved by the ethics
committee of the General Hospital of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army (Beijing, China). A total of 63  male
Sprague‑Dawley rats (weight, 280‑300  g; Vital River
Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd., Beijing, China)
were randomly divided into the following seven groups (each

containing nine rats): The sham group, in which the common
carotid artery (CCA) was exposed, without insertion of a
filament; the 0 h reperfusion group, in which middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed but no reperfusion
treatment was administered; and five ischemic‑reperfusion
groups, in which MCAO was performed and reperfusion treatment was administered for 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64 h, after MCAO
treatment. All experimental procedures and animal handling
protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the General Hospital of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army (approval no. 2008-X1-71). The animals were
allowed ad libitum access to food and water and housed in a
climate‑controlled environment (25˚C).
Construction of rat MCAO model. The MCAO model was
established according to the following procedures. Rats
were anesthetized with 1% sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg;
Sigma‑Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). A midline neck incision was made in order to expose the right CCA and to
enable its separation from the adjacent nerves and tissues.
The internal carotid artery was isolated, following occlusion
of the external carotid artery, and a filament was inserted into
the CCA by scalp acupuncture and slowly advanced until
resistance was felt, while a portion of the filament remained
exposed. The filament was removed following 1.5  h of
mechanical artery blockage. Sham surgery was performed
in an identical manner, but without filament occlusion of the
arteries. The animals in the six groups in which MCAO was
performed were sacrificed using 1% sodium pentobarbital
(80 kg/kg) following reperfusion, 0, 4, 8, 16, 32 or 64 h after
MCAO treatment.
Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Rat brain tissues
were frozen at ‑20˚C for 20 min and cut into 10‑µm sections
using a cryostat (LS-3000; Shenyang Longshou Electronic
Equipment Co., Ltd, Shenyang, China). The sections were
labeled P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5, and were stained with 2% TTC
(Sigma‑Aldrich) at 37˚C for 20 min in complete darkness.
The necrotic areas were analyzed using Image‑Pro Plus 7.0
software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA).
Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. The rat brain tissues
were prepared, fixed and sliced prior to storage. HE staining
was performed according to the following procedure.
Preserved slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated prior to
staining. Frozen or vibratome sections were mounted on slides
and rehydrated prior to staining. A slight over‑staining of the
sections with HE (Sigma‑Aldrich) was performed for 3‑5 min,
depending on the section thickness and quantity of fixative
present. Excessive stain was then removed using tap water.
The differentiation was accomplished with four‑five immersions in acidic alcohol or until sections appeared red. Excess
alcohol was removed by rinsing with tap water. The nuclei were
stained blue by treating the HE‑stained sections with bicarbonate for 2 min, followed by an 8 min rinse with tap water.
The HE‑stained sections were placed in 70% ethanol for 3 min
and then stained with eosin for 2 min in order to resolve the
cellular details. Eosin‑treated sections were subjected to three
consecutive treatments of 5‑min incubations with 95% ethanol
followed by transfer to absolute ethanol for clearing. Images

of stained hippocampus and cortex sections were captured
through a microscope (80i; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) connected
via a charge‑coupled device camera (magnification,  x200;
Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).
Immunohistochemistry. Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated and washed three times with 0.01 M phosphate‑buffered
saline (PBS). Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched
by incubating the sections with 3% H2O2 (Beijing Zhongshan
Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) for 30  min. The
sections were then subjected to sequential incubations in 10%
normal goat serum (Beijing Zhongshan Biotechnology Co.,
Ltd.) in 0.01 M PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The
sections were incubated in polyclonal rabbit anti‑goat NGB
antibody (1:100; cat. no. sc‑22001; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) in PBS, containing 0.3% Triton
X‑100 at 4˚C overnight. Following three washes for 5 min each
with PBS, the sections were incubated in peroxidase‑conjugated goat anti‑rabbit IgG (cat.  no.  111213-96-8; 1:200;
Zymed, San Francisco, CA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature.
Finally, the sections were developed with diaminobenzidine
(Sigma‑Aldrich) in 0.1  M Tris‑buffered saline, containing
0.001% H 2O2 for 30‑50 min. The number of NGB‑positive
cells and total positive area in the assigned sub‑regions was
measured using the Image‑Pro Plus 7.0 software.
Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reac‑
tion (RT‑qPCR) for hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)‑1α
and NGB. The PCR primer pairs used, which were based
on HIF‑1α, NGB, and β ‑actin sequences from rats, were as
follows: Forward: 5'‑GATGCAGCACGATCTCGGCGAA‑3'
and reverse: 5'‑TGGGAGCTCACGTTGTGGGGAA‑3' for
HIF‑1α, forward: 5'‑AAGGGCGGTTCTCTGGGAGCTT‑3'
and reverse: 5'‑AGAGGATGTGCAGGGCCAGCTT‑3' for
NGB and forward: 5'‑GATGCAGCACGATCTCGGCGAA‑3'
and reverse: 5'‑TGGGAGCTCACGTTGTGGGGAA‑3' for
β‑actin.
Rat brain tissues from each group were separated into ischemic and non‑ischemic regions. Total RNA was extracted from
tissues using TRIzol™ reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), and reverse transcribed using the Total
RNA transcription kit (cat. no. R6834‑01; Omega Bio-Tek,
Inc., Shiga, Japan). For RT‑qPCR, 100 ng total RNA was used
as a template quantity in order to determine HIF‑1α and NGB
mRNA expression levels. The results were analyzed using
SDS 1.4 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA),
based on the 2(‑ΔΔCt) method (14).
Western blot analysis of NGB and HIF‑1α expression. The
total brain tissue protein for each group was extracted and
quantified. Approximately 35 mg total protein was separated
by 12.5% SDS‑PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane for overnight hybridization with polyclonal rabbit anti‑rat NGB antibody (1:500; sc‑22001; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse
β-actin (1:1,000; sc-81178; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and
monoclonal rabbit anti‑rat HIF‑1α antibody (1:500; ab51608;
Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). The blotted membranes
were incubated for 2.5 h with horseradish peroxidase‑labeled
goat anti‑rabbit secondary antibody (1:1,000; cat. no. sc‑2004;

analyses were performed using SPSS version 21.0 software
(IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). P<0.05 was considered to
indicate a statistically significant difference.
Results
Necrotic zone areas increase with increasing reperfusion
time and different brain slices exhibit different necrotic zones.
Different brain sections exhibited different necrotic zones, as
indicated by TTC staining. The ischemic‑reperfusion group
exhibited larger necrotic zones than that of the 0 h reperfusion
and sham groups in each brain section (P<0.01; Fig. 1A). The
reperfusion treatment groups exhibited significant damage in
different brain sections, as compared with the sham and 0 h
reperfusion groups (P<0.01; Fig. 1B).
Quantity of hyperchromatic cells in different hippocampal and
cortical regions increases with increasing reperfusion time.
The number of hyperchromatic cells in different hippocampal
regions detected by HE staining, increased with reperfusion
time and peaked in the group that received reperfusion at 32 h
after MCAO (Fig. 2). A similar trend was observed for cortical
regions (Fig. 3).

time; the levels for all five ischemic‑reperfusion groups were
significantly higher than that of the sham group, and levels
peaked in the group that received reperfusion at 32 h after
MCAO (P<0.01; Fig. 5A). For the non‑ischemic regions, NGB
expression levels in the 16 h and 32 h reperfusion groups were
reduced, compared with those in the sham group (Fig. 5A), and
the decrease was significant in the group that received reperfusion at 64 h after MCAO (P<0.01; Fig. 5A). It was also observed
that the HIF‑1α expression level increased in the ischemic
region with increasing reperfusion time, and was significantly
higher in all five ischemic‑reperfusion groups than that in the
sham group. The HIF‑1α expression levels peaked in the group
that received reperfusion at 32 h after MCAO (P<0.01; Fig. 5B).
By contrast, in the non‑ischemic regions, the mRNA transcription level of HIF‑1α was unchanged at 16 h of reperfusion,
although it increased in the group that received reperfusion at
32 h and 64 h after MCAO (P<0.05, P<0.01; Fig. 5B).
NGB protein levels in the ischemic regions markedly increase
with increasing reperfusion time and are significantly higher
for all ischemic‑reperfusion groups compared with the sham
group. The protein levels of NGB peaked in the group that
received reperfusion at 32 h after MCAO (Fig. 6A). The NGB

protein level in the non‑ischemic region also increased with
increasing reperfusion time and was significantly higher for all
ischemic‑reperfusion groups compared with the sham group,
while it was lower than that in the ischemic region (Fig. 6A).
Regarding HIF‑1α protein level in the ischemic regions, low
levels of expression were observed after 4 h reperfusion, and
the expression level markedly increased from 8 h of reperfusion until 64 h reperfusion, with maximal levels observed in the
group that received reperfusion at 32 h after MCAO (Fig. 6B).
However, HIF‑1α protein expression was markedly lower in
the non‑ischemic regions (Fig. 6B).
Changes in SOD activity and MDA levels in the serum
following focal cerebral ischemia. SOD activity decreased
with increasing reperfusion time and rapidly increased in the
group that received reperfusion at 64 h after MCAO. (P<0.05,
P<0.01; Table  I). By contrast, serum MDA concentrations

In the present study, the necrotic zone produced by cerebral
ischemia was characterized, demonstrating an increase in the
number of hyperchromatic cells and NGB‑positive cells in
cortical tissues. It was observed that NGB and HIF‑1α mRNA
and protein expression levels increased with increasing
reperfusion time, with peak expression levels in the group
that received reperfusion at 32 h after MCAO. The expression
levels of the two proteins in the ischemic‑reperfusion groups
were significantly different from those in the sham group.
The measurements of serum redox indices revealed that the
SOD enzyme activity decreased with increased reperfusion
time, although it rapidly increased in the group that received
reperfusion at 32 h after MCAO. The MDA level, by contrast,
increased with increasing reperfusion time and decreased in
the group that received reperfusion at 32 h after MCAO.
The present results indicated that mRNA and protein
levels of NGB increased in rat brain tissues between 4  h
and 64 h following focal cerebral ischemia, with significant
transcriptional and translational upregulation in the ischemic
regions, although not in the non‑ischemic regions. These findings suggested that NGB may be important in sensing and
responding to focal cerebral ischemia. In order to address
whether proteins other than NGB were upregulated in the
MCAO model, HIF‑1α levels were examined, and changes
in its mRNA and protein levels were observed. These results
demonstrated that HIF‑1α expression patterns were similar
to that of NGB. Therefore, it was hypothesized that NGB is
involved in the hypoxic response to MCAO via upregulation
of HIF‑1α. Future studies are required to examine the regulatory interactions between NGB and HIF‑1α, and more closely
examine the signaling pathway governing NGB expression in
the MCAO model.
Redox index assays for SOD activity and MDA concentration, revealed significant changes from 4 h of reperfusion

following focal cerebral ischemia. The direction of change in
SOD activity was opposite to that of MDA levels and similar to
that of changes in NGB expression. Therefore, the serum SOD
and MDA changes may be useful biomarkers for brain focal
cerebral ischemia, as these can be easily measured (15‑17). For
patients with focal cerebral ischemia, the most effective way
to reduce further nerve damage is to administer reperfusion
treatment as soon as possible. However, even with advanced
imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (18) and
magnetic resonance imaging (19,20), early detection of focal
cerebral ischemia is difficult. According to the present experimental results, the measurement of serum SOD activity may
be a novel, accurate and convenient diagnostic approach for
identifying focal cerebral ischemic pathology at an early stage.
In conclusion, NGB levels were upregulated following focal
cerebral ischemia, and were shown to increase with increasing
reperfusion time. The present findings provide preliminary
evidence that serum SOD activity and MDA concentrations
may be used as biomarkers of early focal cerebral ischemia,
due to the simplicity and accuracy of their assay methods.
