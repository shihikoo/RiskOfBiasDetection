Levosimendan limits reperfusion injury in a rat
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model
Marc Hein*, Norbert Zoremba, Chistian Bleilevens, Christian Bruells, Rolf Rossaint and Anna B Roehl

Abstract
Background: Neuroprotective strategies in ischemic stroke are an important challenge in clinical and experimental
research as an adjunct to reperfusion therapy that may reduce neurologic injury and improve outcome. The
neuroprotective properties of levosimendan in traumatic brain injury in vitro, transient global brain ischemia and
focal spinal cord ischemia suggest the potential for similar effects in transient brain ischemia.
Methods: Transient brain ischemia was induced for 60 min by intraluminal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery
in 40 male Wistar rats under general anesthesia with s-ketamine and xylazine and with continuous monitoring of
their blood pressure and cerebral perfusion. Five minutes before inducing reperfusion, a levosimendan bolus
(24 μg kg -1) was administered over a 20 minute period. Infarct size, brain swelling, neurological function and the
expression of inflammatory markers were quantified 24 hours after reperfusion.
Results: Although levosimendan limited the infarct size and brain swelling by 40% and 53%, respectively, no effect
on neurological outcome or mortality could be demonstrated. Upregulation of tumor necrosis factor α and
intercellular adhesion molecule 1 was significantly impeded. Cerebral blood flow during reperfusion was significantly
reduced as a consequence of sustained autoregulation.
Conclusions: Levosimendan demonstrated significant neuroprotective properties in a rat model of transient brain
ischemia by reducing reperfusion injury.

Background
Reperfusion induced by systemic thrombolysis has become
the standard therapy for reducing neurological injury after
acute ischemic stroke. Severe side effects (e.g., cerebral
bleeding), poor reperfusion rates, a limited therapeutic
window and a delayed admission of patients to specialized
units have resulted in an increased use of endovascular approaches, which include intraarterial lysis, thrombectomy
and thromboaspiration [1]. Adjunct therapies are able to
increase ischemic tolerance or limit reperfusion injury and
thus may extend the therapeutic window or improve the
efficiency of reperfusion therapy. Neuroprotective actions
target the brain parenchyma itself or are mediated by
vascular effects. For example, augmentation of collateral
flow may be a promising option [2]. Hypothermia and
several neuroprotective agents (e.g., glutamate antagonists,

free-radical scavengers, calcium antagonists, potassium
channel activators, GABA agonists, and opiate antagonists)
have been investigated in preclinical studies, with none
demonstrating efficiency in clinical practice [3,4]. The
inodilator levosimendan should, in theory, provide neuroprotection, as it has been shown to alter important processes in the biochemical cascade, such as the expression
of inducible nitric oxide synthase and mitochondrial ATPdependent potassium (mKATP) channels which lead to
apoptosis or necrosis following cerebral ischemia and
reperfusion [5,6]. In fact, levosimendan has been shown to
reduce cell death and inflammatory responses and improve
function after transient ischemia of the spinal cord in
rabbits [7,8]. While a dose-dependent protective effect in
an in vitro model of traumatic brain injury could be demonstrated [9], levosimendan failed to improve brain
metabolism or reduce glutamate release, inflammation and
dysfunction of autoregulation in the initial phase after
experimental global ischemic/hypoxic cerebral injury [10].

Its effect on focal transient ischemia has not been investigated in vivo in the brain as it has been in the heart [11].
Therefore, we investigated the application of levosimendan
during ischemia and early reperfusion (postconditioning)
in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
by evaluating infarct size, inflammation, cerebral perfusion
and neurological function.

Methods
Instrumentation

All experiments followed the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals [12] and were authorized by
the German governmental animal care and use office
(Landesamt für Natur-, Umwelt- und Verbraucherschutz
Nordrhein-Westfalen, Recklinghausen, Germany, Protocol
No. 8.87-50.10.37.09.258). Forty male Wistar rats (Charles
River, Sulzfeld, Germany) weighing between 350 and
450 g (400 ± 27 g) [13] underwent MCAO according to a
previously established model. For at least one week prior
to surgery, the animals were housed in standard cages in a
pathogen-free environment, with free access to food
and water and with a 12 hour light/dark cycle. After
induction of anesthesia with an intraperitoneal injection of
100 mg/kg s-ketamine (Ketanest S, Pfizer, New York, USA)
and 10 mg/kg xylazine (Xylazine 2%, Medistar, Ascheberg,
Germany), three ECG electrodes were placed to monitor
heart rate (HR). Animals were orally intubated and mechanically ventilated in a pressure-controlled mode to maintain an end-tidal CO2-tension between 35 and 40 mmHg.
Anesthesia was maintained by repetitive injections of
20 mg/kg s-ketamine if a positive reaction to surgical stress
or intermittent tail pinch could be observed. Body temperature (BT) was adjusted to 37°C using an esophageal
probe and a back-coupled heating plate (MLT1403 and
TCAT-2 Controller, ML 295/R, Physitemp Instruments,
New Jersey, USA). In the prone position, the left parietal
bone was thinned, and a laser Doppler flow probe
(VP10M200ST/P10d, Moor Instruments, Devon, UK) was
fixed 5.5 mm lateral and 1 mm occipital of the bregma to
measure cerebral blood flow (CBF). In the supine position,
the left external jugular was cannulated to administer
3 mL kg-1 h-1 Ringer’s solution. The left common and external carotid arteries were ligated and a pressure catheter
(Micro Tip SPR G71/NR, Millar instruments, Texas, USA)
was threaded into the descending aorta to measure the
mean arterial pressure (MAP). The same incision was used
to insert a filament with a smooth surface, blunted tip and
constant diameter of 300 μm (No 270, VYGON, Aachen,
Germany) into the internal carotid artery (ICA).
Experimental protocol

After stabilization and recording of baseline values for
20 min, the filament was pushed forward until a rapid drop
of CBF to 20-30% of baseline values occurred. Animals

were randomized into the levosimendan or the control
group using a closed envelope system. Fifty-five min after
induction of MCAO, the levosimendan group were treated
with a bolus of 24 μg kg-1 levosimendan (Simdax, Orion
Pharma, Espoo, Finland) and the control group was given
an equal amount of saline over a 20-min period. Sixty min
after MCAO, the filament was removed and parameters
were recorded for an additional 30 min. After removal of
the catheters, wound closure, administration of local
anesthesia with 0.2% ropivacaine (Naropin, AstraZeneca,
Plankstadt, Germany) and an intraperitoneal injection of
20 mg/kg metamizole (Novalgin, Sanofi Aventis, Frankfurt,
Germany), the animals were extubated at the return of
sufficient spontaneous breathing and the righting reflex.
Twenty-four hours later, the animals were neurologically
evaluated and euthanized with an intraperitoneal injection
of 100 mg kg-1 thiopental (Trapanal, Nycomed, Konstanz,
Germany). Serum samples were collected, and the brain
was removed after transcardial perfusion with 100 mL icecold Ringer’s solution.
Hemodynamics

All signals were continuously recorded with a data acquisition system (PowerLab®, ADInstruments, Spechbach,
Germany). HR, MAP, CBF, BT and end-tidal CO2 were
analyzed every 10 minutes. CBF values were normalized
to baseline. The autoregulatory index (ARI) was calculated
as the slope obtained by linear regression from the relative
change in CBF and MAP approximately 20 minutes before
and after MCAO.
Neurological injury

Deficits in basic motor and sensory function were tested
24 hours after reperfusion by a blinded examiner using a
modified 24-point scoring system [14]. Coronal sections
of the brain were stained with 1% 2.3.5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, SERVA, Antwerpen, Belgium) for
15 min at 37°C to delineate the ischemic lesion amongst
the viable tissue. The hemispheric and infarct volumes
of the cortex and striatum were calculated by planimetry
of corresponding areas for each slice and thickness
(2 mm). Swelling corresponded to the differences
between infarcted (left) and non-infarcted (right) hemispheric volumes and infarct volume was corrected for
swelling as follows: corrected infarct volume = infarcted
volume * (1 - swelling/volume non infarcted hemisphere)
[15]. Whereas the corrected cortical and striatal volumes
were detailed for each slice, the swelling data were
reported as the sum of the segmental volumes. Samples
from the cortical penumbra of slice number 3 were used
for semi-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
analysis (TaqMan, Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, California,
USA) as described previously [13]. Gene expression levels
of interleukin-1ß (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis

factor alpha (TNF-α) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1
(ICAM-1) were calculated as a relative quantity (RQ)
according to the ΔΔCt method, which reflects the differences in threshold for each target gene relative to the
housekeeping gene hypoxanthin-guanin-phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and six sham-operated animals. A previous study demonstrated, that TTC staining at 37°C does
not constrict quantitative gene analysis [16]. The concentration of the brain-specific acidic protein S-100ß was
determined in serum probes by a commercially available
ELISA kit (YK151, Sceti, Tokyo, Japan).
Statistical analysis

Animals whose infarcted volume lacked cortical involvement were excluded from the analysis, as this phenomenon
may be accounted for by residual collateral flow through
the circle of Willis. CBF that did not exceed 50% of
baseline values during reperfusion was classified as “failed
reperfusion” and was excluded from the final analysis [13].
The data were displayed as the mean and standard
deviation or as box-and-whisker plots with the 5th and
95th percentile. Differences between the groups were
analyzed using an unpaired t-test and variance analysis for
repeated measurements with the Bonferroni’s post-hoc test.
Welch’s correction was performed if variances were
significantly different between the groups. Effects on
survival were evaluated using a chi-squared test. A one
sample t-test was used to describe the changes in the
RQ values relative to the sham condition (RQ = 1). Statistical significance was set as a p-value of ≤ 0.05 for all
statistical analyses (Prism 6, GraphPad Software, La Jolla,
California, USA).

Results
Twenty-two and 18 animals were assigned to the control
group and the levosimendan group, respectively. Eleven
controls and 13 levosimendan-treated animals survived
24 hours after reperfusion. Subarachnoid hemorrhage
(SAH) led to the death of four animals in the control
group. The cause of death for the remaining seven animals
could not be determined, but may have been related to a
failure of reperfusion. Of the remaining animals, seven in
the control group and nine in the levosimendan group
demonstrated a cortical infarct after reperfusion. The eight
animals with failed reperfusion or lack of involvement of
the cortex in the infarcted area were excluded from
further analysis. There were no significant differences
between the control group and the levosimendan group
with respect to survival, infarct pattern or the rate of
reperfusion (Figure 1).
Hemodynamics

Although HR and MAP did change significantly over
time (p = 0.001), no differences between the groups

could be observed (Figure 2A/B). There was a significant
interaction between time and group for CBF (p = 0.001).
Post-hoc analysis showed significantly lower CBF values
in the levosimendan group at 20 and 30 min after reperfusion (Figure 2C). ARI demonstrated no differences
between the groups (0.37 ± 0.31 vs. 0.32 ± 0.18) before
ischemia. During reperfusion, ARI remained unchanged
after levosimendan treatment (0.35 ± 0.22; Figure 3) but
it increased in the control group (1.71 ± 0.68; p = 0.001),
an indication of abrogated autoregulation.
Neurologic injury

The total infarct volume was 239 ± 83 mm3 in the control group and 128 ± 42 mm3 in the levosimendantreated group (p = 0.01). This difference was discernible
in the cortex (142 ± 79 vs. 72 ± 36 mm3; p = 0.03) and
the striatum (97 ± 38 vs. 56 ± 21 mm3; p = 0.02) in all
slices (Figure 4A). Infarct size reduction was noted in
the cortex medially and temporally and in the striatum
from the center (Figure 4B/C). Total brain swelling was less
pronounced after levosimendan treatment compared to
the control group (63 ± 38 vs. 134 ± 43 mm3; p = 0.004;
Figure 5A). Moreover, significantly lower serum levels of
s-100ß were measured 24 hours after reperfusion in the
levosimendan group versus the control group (1.19 ± 0.64
vs. 2.20 ± 1.75 ng mL-1; p = 0.02; Figure 5B). The low neurological test scores attained by both groups are indicative of
a relevant functional deficit with no statistically significant
differences between the groups (p = 0.12; Figure 5C).
Expression of inflammatory markers in the cortical
penumbra was significantly upregulated (8–18 times) in
both groups at 24 hours after MCAO (Figure 6). While
RQ values of TNFα (p = 0.05) and ICAM-1 (p = 0.04)
remained significantly lower after levosimendan treatment,
there were no differences observed in IL-6 (p = 0.65) and
IL-1ß (p = 0.53) expression between the groups.

Discussion
This study is the first to demonstrate a neuroprotective
effect of levosimendan in the rat brain using a model of
transient MCAO. While structural injury was shown to
be reduced, an improvement of neurological outcome
could not be demonstrated. Postconditioning with
levosimendan reduced infarct size, brain swelling, release
of s-100ß, impairment of cerebral autoregulation and
the inflammatory response 24 hours after reperfusion.
Transient cerebral ischemia led to an extension of the
infarct core despite reperfusion therapy. Although reperfusion restored the energy supply to the neuronal cells
of the penumbra, this effect is limited due to the occurrence of secondary energy failure, impairments of the
blood brain barrier (BBB), abrogated autoregulation of
perfusion and inflammation (reperfusion injury) [3].
Thus, neuroprotective agents may target the neurons or
the vasculature of the brain. Activation of mKATP channels

before ischemia (preconditioning) should preserve energy
status. In fact, pretreatment with levosimendan has been
shown to reduce neuronal injury in traumatic brain injury
in vitro [9] and in the rabbit spinal cord in vivo [8].
Postconditioning with levosimendan also improved function and reduced neurological injury in the spinal cord of
the rabbit [7]. A similar effect could be achieved with
diazoxide in the rat brain after transient ischemia. The
reduction of the infarct size was associated with a partial
inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore
opening, a key mediator of reperfusion injury, without any
effect on oxidative phosphorylation [17]. Accordingly,
levosimendan failed to improve restoration of metabolism
after transient global ischemia in the rat [10]. Thus, improvement of secondary energy failure would not account
for the postconditioning effects of levosimendan.
As cerebral injury affects both the integrity of the BBB
and autoregulation and because the extent of flow during

values before ischemia (baseline) (*** p < 0.001 vs. levosimendan).

reperfusion is correlated with neurological injury [18], the
current findings that CBF was limited during reperfusion
by intact autoregulation may partially explain the neuroprotective properties of levosimendan. A similar effect has
previously been demonstrated for nimodipin [19] and
magnesium sulfate [20]. KATP channels have also been
shown to play a major role in the autoregulation of
CBF [21] and ischemic reperfusion injury has been
reported to reduce N-methyl-D-aspartate mediated
vasodilatation, which could be prevented by diazoxide
[22]. Thus, levosimendan should be able to prevent
regional no-reflow and hyperperfusion. Moreover, studies

have demonstrated an improvement in cerebral perfusion
in critically ill infants with low cardiac output syndrome
[23] as well as the prevention of vasospasm in an animal
model of subarachnoid hemorrhage [24]. However,
improved collateral perfusion by levosimendan could not
be demonstrated during ischemia in the current investigation, which may indicate that effects on autoregulation
during reperfusion play an important role in this model.
However, it remains unclear whether preservation of the
external carotid artery may influence these results [25].
Although long-term effects of levosimendan on global
hemodynamics, which may influence CBF, cannot be

excluded, such effects are rather unlikely after such a short
infusion time and have only been described for dosages
higher than 36 μg/kg [26].
Additionally, the activation of KATP channels should
reduce the permeability of the BBB and thus reduce
cerebral edema and inflammation [3,27]. Indeed, the
results show that levosimendan reduced brain swelling
and the expression of TNFα and ICAM-1. This effect
could not be demonstrated after transient global cerebral
ischemia [10]. As brain injury triggers the inflammatory
response and aggravates the injury [28], the decreased
expression of TNFα and ICAM-1 indicate a diminished
progression of injury. Cytokines such as TNFα will stimulate expression of ICAM-1, leading to leukocyte adhesion
and extravasation [29].
In summary, it is difficult to determine which mechanism mediates the neuroprotective action of levosimendan. Although only low tissue concentrations will have
reached the brain with a single bolus of 24 μg kg-1
levosimendan [10], it is reasonable to assume that it has a
direct effect on neuronal cells, as expansion of the infarct
core from the lateral cortex and lateral striatum reflects
the early stages (4–8 hours) after untreated MCAO [30].
It is nearly impossible to distinguish whether the vascular
effects of levosimendan are a consequence of reduced
brain injury or a primary effect. The inconsistent effects of

levosimendan reported in different studies may be
explained by the differences in the pathomechanisms and
in the extent of neuronal injury [10]. The aim of the
current protocol for levosimendan was to reach the
highest possible serum concentrations during early reperfusion with limited hemodynamic side effects. In contrast,
a delayed and extended application may result in higher
effect-site concentrations and pronounced differences.
In the current investigation, postconditioning with
levosimendan led to a 46% reduction in infarct volume, which concurs with the findings of other studies
(hypothermia = 40%, ischemic postconditioning = 40%,
diazoxide = 54%) [3,17]. This effect may be too small
to allow for the detection of functional effects. Nevertheless, several studies have demonstrated significant
effects of neuroprotective interventions on functional
recovery [31-33], and a review article reported that at
least 80% of the integrity of the ipsilateral hemisphere
should be preserved to provide partial or complete
neurologic recovery [34]. This range could have been
closely approximated by the inhalation of the noble
gas xenon [35]. However, the Stroke Therapy Industry
Roundtable (STAIR) recommends that a longer observational period of at least three days along with repetitive
sophisticated testing is more important in describing
neurological deficits [36]. Even pronounced recovery

within this first week in untreated animals should be
noted [37].
Several limitations related to the study design warrant
mention. No tissue samples were collected to analyze
protein expressions and no further techniques were used
to quantify cell death in the cortex and the hippocampus. The exclusion of 24 animals by the predefined
criteria resulted in a small number of animals per group.
The high mortality rate deserves further discussion. A
current review calculated the average mortality in rat
stroke experiments as 15%, with a range between 0%
and 60% [38]. SAH and failed reperfusion, which could
lead to larger infarcts, may account for the high mortality rate observed in the current study and may be
related to the shape of the filament.
Further studies are needed to determine the sites of
action and the feasibility of levosimendan as a neuroprotective agent. Possible targets may include the reduction
of cerebral injury after resuscitation, ischemic stroke or
cerebral vasospasm [24]. The cardioprotective properties
may also be of interest as brain injury may induce heart
failure [39].

Conclusions
In conclusion, the application of levosimendan during ischemia and early reperfusion limited cerebral reperfusion
injury. Although infarct size, brain swelling, inflammation
and impairment of autoregulation were reduced, no effect
on mortality or neurological function could be observed.
