Abstract The purpose of this study was to determine
whether the antibiotic erythromycin induces tolerance
against focal cerebral ischemia, and the possible underlying
mechanism including the involvement of neuronal nitric
oxide synthase (nNOS) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a
(HIF-1a). In rat focal cerebral ischemia models, we found
that erythromycin preconditioning could significantly
decrease the cerebral infarct volume and brain edema.
Meanwhile, the neurological deficits from day 4 through 7
after surgery were also remarkably decreased after erythromycin preconditioning. Moreover, erythromycin preconditioning induced significantly increased nNOS levels
and decreased HIF-1a levels in both mRNA and protein
expression. This study for the first time indicated that
erythromycin preconditioning could induce focal brain
ischemic tolerance and attenuate brain injury of subsequent
transient focal cerebral ischemia. The potential mechanism
may be due to up-regulation of nNOS, but the HIF-1a
system was not involved.

Introduction
Preconditioning with brief, non-lethal ischemia (ischemic
preconditioning, IPC) can reduce the injury of subsequent
severe ischemia. This phenomenon described in several
organs is called ischemic tolerance [1, 2]. Studies have
demonstrated that IPC is the most robust endogenous protective mechanism [3]. Currently, a major research effort
has been directed at elucidating the cellular mechanisms
underlying this phenomenon with the goal of developing
new and more efficacious treatments for ischemia, and a lot
of substances may have been involved in the process.
In addition, increasing evidence indicates that neural
nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and hypoxia-inducible factor1a (HIF-1a) are involved in process of hypoxic response
and IPC. Atochin et al. [4] reported that nNOS-knockout
mice showed no protection from rapid IPC. Xu et al. [5]
considered that the cardioprotection observed in the final
stage of late phase of IPC was mediated by nNOS or COX2. Feng et al. [6] found that nitric oxide from nNOS could
participate in the induction of mGluR2/3 mediated-brain
ischemic tolerance. Besides, up-regulation of HIF-1a was
confirmed in rat models of renal ischemia–reperfusion
injury, and IPC could reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress
[7]. In neonatal rat models, HIF-1a-regulated gene
expression was found to be involved in the hypoxiainduced tolerance to ischemic cerebral injury [8]. Currently, nNOS and HIF-1a are attracting more interests in
study of IPC, and we believe that they might play important roles in hypoxic response and IPC of the brain.

A variety of factors such as brief episodes of ischemia
and hypoxia, or cobalt chloride (CoCl2) play protective
roles in brain ischemic tolerance [9]. Unfortunately, none
of these substances is suitable for clinical use because of
their serious side effects. Erythromycin has long been in
clinical practice as an antibiotic that has few side effects.
Several previous studies demonstrated that pretreatment
with erythromycin can induce tolerance against transient
global cerebral ischemia in rats [10, 11]. These findings
prompted us a hypothesis that erythromycin preconditioning might exert a protective effect on focal cerebral
ischemia via regulating nNOS and/or HIF-1a. In the
present study, we used rat middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAo) models to determine whether erythromycin preconditioning could induce ischemic tolerance against
ischemic neuronal injury, as well as the possible roles of
nNOS and HIF-1a in these pathophysiological processes.

Methods
Establishment of rat MCAo model
Adult male Wistar rats (8-week-old), weighing 270–300 g,
were purchased from the Center for Experimental Animals,
China Medical University. All animals were maintained in
a specific pathogen-free facility. NIH Guidelines for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals were followed in all
animal procedures.
We induced 2 h of transient right MCAo followed by
24 h of reperfusion (ischemia–reperfusion, I/R) using the
modified intraluminal filament technique as described by
Longa et al. [12].
Experimental protocol and groups
Rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg,
i.p.) and were divided into seven groups randomly (n = 8
for each group): sham group, I/R group and erythromycin
groups which were further subdivided into 3, 6, 12, 24 and
48 h subgroups. We chose 35 mg/kg erythromycin as the
optimal dosage in our experiments according to our preliminary results. In the sham group, rats were injected with
erythromycin (35 mg/kg, i.m.) and then after 12 h they
received the same surgical procedure except that the artery
was not incised and occluded. In the I/R group, rats were
given the same amount of sterile saline, 12 h later they
received 2 h of MCAo and 24 h of reperfusion. In subgroups of 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h erythromycin group
(abbreviated as E-3, E-6, E-12, E-24, E-48 h), erythromycin (35 mg/kg, i.m.) was injected at different time
points before MCAo, respectively, then we induced 2 h
of MCAo and 24 h of reperfusion after erythromycin

preconditioning. There were 8 rats for each group in every
experiment, and specimens from one single donor were not
utilized repeatedly for the same group.
Neurologic deficit evaluation
A neurologic evaluation was performed once daily at the
same time (around 5:00 p.m.) by the same investigator,
who was unaware of the group assignment. A modified
6-point scale was used for assessment [12].
Measurement of infarct volume
Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, rats were sacrificed by
an overdose of chloral hydrate. Brains were rapidly
removed, frozen at -20 °C, sectioned into five coronal
slices (2 mm thick), and then immediately immersed in
2 % of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) saline
solution at 37 °C for 30 min. Stained tissues were fixed in
4 % paraformaldehyde, photographed, and quantified for
ischemic damage with a Motic Images Advanced 3.2
Software (Ted Pella Inc., CA, USA). The degree of brain
damage was corrected for the contribution made by brain
edema/swelling, as described previously [13].
Determination of brain water content
Rats were sacrificed by decapitation 12 h after reperfusion.
After removal of the brains in total, the hemispheres were
separated along the interhemispheric plane. Both hemispheres were weighed to assess their wet weight. Then the
hemispheres were dried for 48 h at 80 °C for the determination of dry weight. Water content in both ischemic and
non-ischemic hemispheres was obtained by the following
calculation: Hemispheric water content (%) = (wet
weight - dry weight)/wet weight 9 100 %.
Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
Rats were anesthetized and decapitated 24 h after reperfusion. Total RNA was isolated from the brain tissue of
ipsilateral peri-ischemic cortex (ischemic penumbra, frozen
in liquid nitrogen) by a single step method using TRIzolÒ
Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and cDNA was synthesized from 1 lg total RNA from each samples. The
forward and reverse primers of each PCR set, the sizes of
PCR products, and annealing temperatures are listed in
Table 1. The amplified products were electrophoresed in
1.2 % agarose/TBE gels. Gels were photographed and
integrated density values (IDV) were calculated by a
Chemi Imager 5500 V2.03 software (AlPha InnCh, Miami,
FL, USA).

Western blotting assay
Rats were anesthetized and decapitated 24 h after reperfusion. Brain tissues of ipsilateral peri-ischemic cortex
(ischemic penumbra) were sampled for protein quantitation. Briefly, the brain tissues were homogenized and
sonicated for 40 s in a lysis buffer and then proteins from
detergent-lysed cells were quantified using a bicinchoninic
acid (BCA) protein assay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Proteins were run on 7.5 % polyacrylamide gels with a 4 %
stacking gel (SDS-PAGE), then transferred to nitrocellulose, and stained with goat polyclonal anti-nNOS primary
antibody (1:300, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and rabbit polyclonal anti-HIF-1a primary antibody (1:300, Santa Cruz,
CA, USA). After washing, the membrane was incubated at
room temperature for 1 h with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody and goat
anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1,000, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA), respectively. Immunoreactive bands were visualized
using chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Santa Cruz). The
protein bands were scanned with a Chemi Imager 5500
V2.03 software (AlPha InnCh, Miami, FL, USA), densitometrically quantitated with a computerized image analysis system (Fluor Chen 2.0, Bio-Rad, CA, USA) and were
normalized with that of b-actin.
Statistical analysis
All results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviations. A Student’s t test was performed to determine the
significant difference between groups. One-way ANOVA
and post hoc comparisons (Bonferroni test) were used for
multiple comparisons. A level of significance of P \ 0.05
or P \ 0.01 was selected.

Results
As designed, the rat right MCAo models were successfully
established, and confirmed by neurological deficit scale, for
the determination of infarct volume and brain water

content. The effects of erythromycin in IPC were further
investigated by evaluating the expression of nNOS and
HIF-1a.
In Fig. 1a, the infarct tissue remained unstained,
whereas the normal tissue was stained red by TTC solutions. The percentage of cerebral infarct volume in the
sham group, I/R group, and E-3, E-6, E-12, E-24 and
E-48 h groups was 0, 27.94 ± 3.62, 25.79 ± 4.63, 18.73
± 3.36, 14.10 ± 2.33, 17.35 ± 3.12, and 29.72 ± 4.30 %,
respectively. There was no statistical difference between
E-3 or E-48 h groups and I/R group (P [ 0.05). But the
infarct volume percentage of E-6, E-12, E-24 h groups was

We further determined the expression of nNOS and
HIF-1a in each group to explore whether these IPC-related
factors were involved in the IPC process induced by
erythromycin. The results proved that the mRNA and
protein levels of nNOS in the sham group and erythromycin groups (E-6, E-12, E-24 h) were greatly increased
compared to I/R group (P \ 0.01, P \ 0.05, P \ 0.01 and
P \ 0.05, respectively), and peaked in E-12 h group. On
the contrary, no statistical difference was found between
E-3 or E-48 h group and I/R group (P [ 0.05, P [ 0.05,
respectively, Fig. 4). However, HIF-1a did not show
obvious involvement in this process. No expression of HIF1a was found in the sham group, either mRNA or protein.
In most erythromycin subgroups (E-3, E-6, E-12, E-24 h),
the mRNA and protein expression levels of HIF-1a were
obviously decreased compared with I/R group (P \ 0.05,
P \ 0.05, P \ 0.01 and P \ 0.05, respectively), in which
E-12 h group presented the lowest level. There was no
difference between E-48 h group and I/R group (P [ 0.05,
Fig. 5).

Discussion

Fig. 3 Neurological scoring of rats in I/R and E-12 h groups (n = 8,
each group). The neurological dysfunction of rats in E-2 h group was
markedly improved compared to rats in I/R group from day 4 through
7 after surgery. *P \ 0.05 vs. I/R group

significantly reduced by 32.96, 49.53 and 37.90 % compared with I/R group, respectively (P \ 0.05, P \ 0.01 and
P \ 0.05, respectively, Fig. 1b). These data demonstrated
that the E-12 h group had the least infarct volume among
the erythromycin preconditioning subgroups.
When detecting the brain water content, we found that
ischemic brain edema in the right hemisphere was significantly reduced in E-12 h group compared with I/R group
(81.13 ± 0.69
and
82.77 ± 0.64 %,
respectively,
P \ 0.05), while there was no statistical difference between
two groups in the non-ischemic (left) hemisphere
(78.41 ± 0.47 and 78.53 ± 0.55 %, respectively, P[0.05),
as shown in Fig. 2.
The above results were also confirmed by evaluation of
neurological deficits. After a continuously daily assessment, we found that rat models in E-12 h group correlated
to less neurological deficits compared to the I/R group from
day 4 through 7 after surgery (P \ 0.05, Fig. 3), indicating
a protective effect of erythromycin pretreatment.

As an antibiotic, erythromycin has long been used in
clinical practice with few side effects, which make it an
elegant representative for a novel regimen of ischemic
tolerance induction. Brambrink et al. [10] and Koerner
et al. [11] have proved that the erythromycin induces tolerance against rat transient global cerebral ischemia, and
the mechanisms are associated with suppression of proinflammatory genes as well as increased expression of the
anti-apoptotic gene B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), suggesting
a potential clinical strategy of neuroprotection. In the
present study, we found that erythromycin preconditioning
could observably decrease ischemic infarct volume and
brain edema after experimental focal cerebral ischemia
in vivo, and the post-ischemic neurological deficits from
day 4 through 7 was also evidently decreased. These results
implied that erythromycin preconditioning was effective in
inducing focal brain ischemic tolerance and attenuated the
brain injury.
However, the molecular mechanisms of this ischemic
tolerance induced by erythromycin are not understood yet.
It has been realized that NO plays an important role in both
initiating and mediating IPC [14]. It is reported that NO
levels rise significantly due to activation of nNOS by
NMDA-receptor-mediated calcium entry in cardiac and
neuronal IPC, and nNOS-knockout mice did not show
protection from rapid IPC, suggesting that nNOS may play
a role in the molecular mechanisms of ischemic protection
[4, 15]. In this study, we also found that the mRNA and
protein expression levels of nNOS were obviously

increased after erythromycin preconditioning, although the
exact mechanisms involved in this process were still
unknown. Lu et al. [16] reported that nNOS is involved in
IR-induced cardiac injury by increasing oxidative/nitrative
stress, and nNOS also participated in IPC-induced cardiac
protection, which might be mediated through the mechanisms of inhibition of oxidative/nitrative stress. Moreover,
NO-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway plays an important role
in the preconditioning-induced neuroprotection against
oxidative stress [17]. NO could activate Ras and stimulate
downstream ERK1/2 cascade, which post-transcriptionally
activates Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) expression
and activity, thus promoting the neuroprotection of cortical
neurons exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)
followed by reoxygenation [18]. But whether these pathways participate in the erythromycin-induced up-regulation
of nNOS needs to be further investigated. In this study, we
successfully established rat right MCAo models and proved
that erythromycin preconditioning could induce ischemic
tolerance after focal cerebral ischemia via up-regulation of
nNOS expression. Several possible nNOS-related signal

pathways should be detected to screen and confirm the
molecular mechanism of this pathophysiological process,
and in vivo NOS inhibition is also demanded to test whether the erythromycin-induced ischemic tolerance would be
mitigated in a future study.
As shown in Fig. 4, we found that erythromycin also
increased the expression level of nNOS in the sham group,
indicating that erythromycin can up-regulate the nNOS
expression in normal brain tissue, although the exact
mechanism needs to be further investigated. Korner et al.
[11] proved that erythromycin-induced ischemic tolerance
distinctively alters the brain’s transcriptional response to
ischemia, and attributed the IPC to de novo protein synthesis via adapted gene transcription. Similarly, other and
our studies indicated that erythromycin could also realize
its effect at a transcriptional level. Several studies have
found that inhibition of NOS system activity mitigates the
ischemic tolerance in rat MCAO model. Aminoguanidine,
as an iNOS inhibitor, has been reported to eliminate the
IPC-induced protection and infarct-sparing effect [19–21].
Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of nNOS might

123

692

also eliminate or block the ischemic tolerance induced by
erythromycin, which will be determined in future research
to give further insights into the mechanism.
On the other hand, accumulating evidence indicates that
HIF-1a might be an important factor in the IPC process
[22–25]. Chang et al. [2] proved that exogenous low-dose
hydrogen peroxide could induce preconditioning protection
against ischemia in primary cortical neurons by increasing
HIF-1a expression. The role of HIF-1a in ischemic tolerance might be related to transactivation between active
form of HIF-1 and the target genes such as vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and erythropoietin
(EPO), thereby regulating neurogenesis [26, 27]. However,
our data demonstrated that HIF-1a expression was
decreased after erythromycin preconditioning, which was
in accordance with the findings of Anders et al. that HIF-1a
mRNA expression was distinctly lower in IPC group
compared to I/R group in liver tissue [28]. These results
suggested that HIF-1a system is not involved in the process
of erythromycin-induced IPC.
In conclusion, our in vivo assays yielded exciting results
that the antibiotic erythromycin might be an optional
candidate for IPC with few side effects. Erythromycin
could induce ischemic tolerance in rat MCAo models to
reduce neurological deficit and protect the ischemic cerebral injury, and this effect is probably achieved by the upregulation of nNOS expression but not the HIF-1a system.
These findings will help better understand the mechanisms
of erythromycin-induced brain ischemic tolerance and help
select appropriate therapeutic agents in the treatment of
brain ischemic reperfusion injury, although more and further investigations are needed in the future.
