Cerebral ischemia is characterized by an early disruption of GABAergic neurotransmission contributing to an imbalance of the excitatory/inhibitory equilibrium and neuronal death, but the molecular mechanisms involved are
not fully understood. Here we report a downregulation of GABAA receptor (GABAAR) expression, affecting both
mRNA and protein levels of GABAAR subunits, in hippocampal neurons subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation
(OGD), an in vitro model of ischemia. Similar alterations in the abundance of GABAAR subunits were observed
in in vivo brain ischemia. OGD reduced the interaction of surface GABAAR with the scaffold protein gephyrin,
followed by clathrin-dependent receptor internalization. Internalization of GABAAR was dependent on glutamate
receptor activation and mediated by dephosphorylation of the β3 subunit at serine 408/409. Expression of
phospho-mimetic mutant GABAAR β3 subunits prevented receptor internalization and protected hippocampal
neurons from ischemic cell death. The results show a key role for β3 GABAAR subunit dephosphorylation in
the downregulation of GABAergic synaptic transmission in brain ischemia, contributing to neuronal death.
GABAAR phosphorylation might be a therapeutic target to preserve synaptic inhibition in brain ischemia.

Introduction
The activity of neuronal networks in the CNS is mainly determined
by the balance between glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, which is up- and down-regulated, respectively, during ischemic insults resulting from an insufﬁcient blood supply to the brain (Choi,
1992; Lipton, 1999). In contrast to the role of glutamate in ischemic
damage, alterations in inhibitory neurotransmission remain poorly
understood.
The down regulation of GABAergic neurotransmission in the ischemic brain occurs at the pre- and post-synaptic levels (Schwartz-Bloom
and Sah, 2001). Exposure of hippocampal slices to oxygen and
glucose-deprivation (OGD) induces an early release of GABA by exocytosis, followed by a delayed phase of neurotransmitter release mediated
by reversal of the plasma membrane transporter (Allen et al., 2004). The
downregulation of vesicular GABA transporters (Gomes et al., 2011)
may contribute to the delayed inhibition of the exocytotic release of
GABA. GABAA receptors (GABAAR) are the major players in fast synaptic
inhibition in the CNS, and a downregulation of the surface expression
of GABAARs has also been shown in different models of ischemia

(Schwartz-Bloom and Sah, 2001). This is likely to play an important
role in the demise process since stabilization of the GABAAR surface
expression is correlated with neuroprotection in neurons subjected to
OGD (Liu et al., 2010; Mielke and Wang, 2005), and inhibition of
AP2/clathrin-dependent internalization of GABA A R also reduces
OGD-induced cell death (Smith et al., 2012). Together, these evidences indicate that the number of cell surface GABAAR and receptor internalization play a key role in ischemic cell death, but the
molecular mechanisms involved in receptor internalization have
not been elucidated.
It is generally assumed that the majority of GABAARs in the brain are
assembled from at least 2 α-, 2 β-, and 1 γ2-subunits (Rudolph and
Mohler, 2004). GABAARs present a dynamic mobility between synaptic
and extrasynaptic localization (Thomas et al., 2005), being the accumulation of the receptor at the inhibitory synapses regulated by its scaffold
protein gephyrin (Jacob et al., 2005). Although the strength of inhibitory
signaling is determined by the number of GABAAR at the synapse, the internalization of these receptors occurs outside the synapse (Bogdanov
et al., 2006). The rate of internalization of GABAARs is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of β3 or γ2 GABAAR subunits on their intracellular loop (Kittler et al., 2005, 2008). Furthermore, NMDAR signaling via
calcineurin and GABAAR phosphorylation also controls the stability of
synaptic GABAARs (Muir et al., 2010), but how brain ischemia affects
the mechanisms of regulation of GABAAR trafﬁcking has not been
investigated.

In the present work we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying GABAAR downregulation during OGD, an in vitro model of global ischemia. Combining cell imaging and biochemical approaches we
show that OGD decreases GABAAR/gephyrin interaction and induces
the internalization of GABAAR via clathrin‐dependent endocytosis. In
addition, we demonstrate that OGD-induced dephosphorylation and internalization of β3 GABAAR subunits contributes to neuronal death.
Overall, we propose that GABAAR/gephyrin dissociation and receptor
dephosphorylation are key steps for GABAergic down‐modulation during cerebral ischemia and the subsequent neuronal cell death.
Material and methods
Hippocampal cultures
Primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons were prepared from
the hippocampi of E18-E19 Wistar rat embryos, after treatment with
trypsin (0.06%, 15 min, 37 °C; GIBCO Invitrogen) in Ca2+- and Mg2+free Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS; 5.36 mM KCl, 0.44 mM
KH2PO4, 137 mM NaCl, 4.16 mM NaHCO3, 0.34 mM Na2HPO4.2H2O,
5 mM glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES and 0.001% phenol red). The hippocampi were then washed with HBSS containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (GIBCO Invitrogen), to stop trypsin activity, and
transferred to Neurobasal medium (GIBCO Invitrogen) supplemented
with B27 supplement (1:50 dilution; GIBCO Invitrogen), 25 μM glutamate, 0.5 mM glutamine and 0.12 mg/ml gentamycin. The cells were
dissociated in this solution and were then plated on 6 well plates
(90.0 × 103 cells/cm2), previously coated with poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg/
ml), or on poly-D-lysine coated glass coverslips, at a density of 80.0 ×
103 cells/cm2. The cultures were maintained in a humidiﬁed incubator
with 5% CO2/95% air, at 37 °C, for 15 days.
Oxygen-glucose deprivation
Hippocampal neurons (15 DIV) were incubated in a glucose-free saline buffer (116 mM NaCl, 25 mM sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, 5.4 mM KCl,
0.8 mM MgSO4, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 25 mM NaHCO3) in an
anaerobic chamber with 10% H2, 85% N2, 5% CO2 (Forma Anaerobic System, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), at 37 °C, for the indicated period of time.
The OGD buffer was then replaced by a conditioned medium and the
cultures were returned to the humidiﬁed 95% air/5% CO2 incubator for
the indicated post-incubation time period. Under control conditions
(Sham) the cells were incubated in the saline buffer described above,
supplemented with 25 mM glucose instead of sucrose, and kept in the
humidiﬁed 95% air/5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. When appropriate the
cells were pre-incubated with glutamate receptor or calpain inhibitors
(20 μM NBQX [Tocris] and 100 μM APV [Tocris] were added 30 min before OGD; 50 μM ALLN [Calbiochem] or 50 μM MDL28170 [Calbiochem],
1 h before OGD), and the drugs were also present during and after the
insult.
Western blotting
Total cell extracts were prepared after washing the cells twice with
ice-cold PBS buffer. The cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (150 mM
NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl, 5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton, 0.5% DOC and 0.1% SDS,
at a ﬁnal pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mM DTT and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (0.1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin,
1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin; Sigma–Aldrich Química). For phosphorylation studies the lysis buffer contained 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM
NaCl, 10 mM EDTA and 1% Triton (pH 7.4), and was supplemented
with phosphatase inhibitors (50 mM NaF and 1.5 mM sodium
orthovanadate). After centrifugation at 16,100 ×g for 10 min, protein
levels present in the supernatants were quantiﬁed using the BCA method (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Samples were then diluted with a 2× concentrated denaturing buffer (125 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mM glycine, 4%

221

SDS, 200 mM DTT, 40% glycerol, 3 mM sodium orthovanadate, and
0.01% bromophenol blue). Protein samples were separated by SDSPAGE, in 10% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to PVDF membranes
(Millipore) and immunoblotted. Membranes were incubated with
primary antibodies (overnight at 4 °C), washed and exposed to
alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:20,000
dilution; 1 h at room temperature) (GE Healthcare or Jackson
ImmunoResearch). Alkaline phosphatase activity was visualized
using ECF on the Storm 860 Gel and Blot Imaging System (GE
Healthcare). The following primary antibodies were used: antiAlpha1 GABAA receptor (1:1000, NeuroMab), anti-Alpha2 GABAA receptor (1:1000, Synaptic System), anti-Beta 3 GABA A receptor
(1:1000, NeuroMab), anti-Phospho-Ser408/409 Beta 3 GABAA receptor
(1:1000, Symansis), anti-Gama 2 GABAA receptor (1:1000, Synaptic
Systems) and anti-Gephyrin (1:1000, Synaptic Systems). AntiSynaptophysin (1:10,000, Abcam) and anti-β-tubulin (1:300,000,
Sigma) antibodies were used as loading controls.
Fluorescence assay of receptor internalization
Cultured living hippocampal neurons (15 DIV) were incubated at RT
for 10 min in the presence of a high concentration (1:100) of an antiAlpha1 GABAA receptor antibody (Millipore), directed against the Nterminus of the α1 subunits, or an anti-myc antibody (1:300, Cell Signaling). The cells were then washed with PBS at 37 °C, to remove the
unbound antibody, and were further incubated in an antibody free conditioned medium at the same temperature (for different periods) to
allow the internalization of antibody-bound receptors. After this incubation neurons were ﬁxed for 15 min in 4% sucrose/paraformaldehyde.
Next, neurons were exposed to a super-saturating concentration
(1:300) of the ﬁrst of two secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 goat
anti-rabbit; Invitrogen) for 1 h at RT. After permeabilization (0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 min) the cells were incubated with the second secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit, 1:500 Invitrogen) for 1 h
at RT. This strategy allows distinguishing the surface receptors from
those receptors that have been internalized before ﬁxation (Goodkin
et al., 2005). The coverslips were then mounted on slides with a ﬂuorescence mounting medium (DAKO). Images were acquired on Axio Observer 2.1 ﬂuorescence microscope (Zeiss) coupled to an Axiocam
HRm digital camera, using a 63 × oil objective and were quantiﬁed
using the ImageJ image analysis software. For each experiment analyzed
the cells were stained and imaged using identical settings. The ratio of
internalization was calculated using the internalized antibody signal/
total antibody signal ratio.
Immunocytochemistry
Hippocampal neurons were ﬁxed in 4% sucrose/paraformaldehyde
(in PBS) and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. The neurons
were then incubated with 10% BSA in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C, and incubated with the primary antibody anti-myc (1:500, Cell Signaling) diluted in 3% BSA in PBS, overnight at 4 °C. The cells were washed with PBS
and incubated with the secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG) conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen), for 1 h at RT. The coverslips were
mounted in a ﬂuorescence mounting medium (DAKO, Denmark). Imaging was performed in an Axio Observer 2.1 ﬂuorescence microscope,
coupled to an Axiocam HRm digital camera, using a 63× oil objective.
The cells to count were chosen by the myc (green) channel to check
for the presence of transfected neurons. Measurements were performed
in three independent preparations, and at least 50 cells were counted
per experimental condition for each preparation.
Surface co-immunoprecipitation assay
After stimulation using the indicated experimental conditions hippocampal neurons were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated

222

with Sulfo-NHS–SS–biotin (0.25 mg/ml in PBS; Thermo Scientiﬁc)
for 15 min on ice. Cells were then washed twice with 50 mM NH4Cl
and two times more with PBS. After biotinylation, the cells were lysed
with RIPA buffer and α1-containing GABAARs were immunoprecipitated.
Protein G Plus-Agarose beads (50 μl; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were
added to Lysis buffer (1 ml) containing 5 μg of an anti-GABAAR alpha 1
subunit (NeuroMab) monoclonal antibody and incubated for 2 h on a
head-over-head shaker at 4 °C. Antibody excess was removed by two
rinses with lysis buffer. Lysed samples (400 μg) were added to the
beads and incubated for 6 h on a head-over-head shaker at 4 °C. Beads
were centrifuged at 800 ×g to remove the antibody, and the samples
were then washed three times with lysis buffer. The residual buffer
was removed and bead–IP–GABAARs were incubated with 50 μl of 1%
SDS (80 min at 37 °C) to disrupt the interaction between the beads
and IP–GABAARs. Finally, beads were centrifuged at 800 ×g, and the supernatants were mixed with 150 μl of lysis buffer before being used in
NeutAvidin pull-downs.
NeutAvidin® Plus UltraLink Resin beads (40 μl; Thermo scientiﬁc)
were added to the samples and mixed on a head-over-head shaker for
4 h. Beads were then centrifuged at 800 ×g and washed three times
with lysis buffer. The residual lysis buffer was removed and then 60 μl
of 2 × loading buffer was added. Samples were heated at 90 °C for
5 min and beads were centrifuged at 800 ×g. The bead supernatants
were used for Western blot analysis.
Neuron transfection with calcium phosphate
Transfection of cultured hippocampal neurons with mychuGABA A R β3 (WT), myc-huGABA A R β3 (p-mimetic) or mychuGABA A R β3 (p-null) constructs was performed by the calcium
phosphate coprecipitation method. Brieﬂy, 2 μg of plasmid DNA
was diluted in Tris-EDTA (TE) pH 7.3 and mixed with 2.5 M CaCl2.
This DNA/TE/calcium mix was added to 10 mM HEPES-buffered saline solution (270 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1.4 mM Na2 HPO4, 11 mM
dextrose, 42 mM HEPES, pH 7.2). The precipitates were allowed to
form for 30 min at room temperature, protected from light, with vortex
mixing every 5 min, to ensure that the precipitates had similar small
sizes. Meanwhile, cultured hippocampal neurons were incubated with
a cultured-conditioned medium with 2 mM kynurenic acid (Sigma).
The precipitates were added drop-wise to each well and incubated for
2 h at 37 °C, in an incubator with 95% air/5%CO2. The cells were then
washed with acidic culture medium containing 2 mM kynurenic acid
and returned to the 95% air/5% CO2 incubator for 20 min at 37 °C. Finally,
the medium was replaced with the initial culture-conditioned medium,
and the cells were further incubated in a 95% air/5% CO2 incubator for
48 h at 37 °C to allow protein expression. Cell cultures were then subjected to OGD for 90 min, and 8 h after the insult the cells were ﬁxed to proceed with the cell death assay. In the case of the ﬂuorescence
internalization assay cells were subjected to 70 min of OGD.
Mutagenesis
The plasmid containing the human WT GABAAR β3 subunit sequence was a kind offer of Doctor Martin Wallner (Department of

Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, David Geffen School of Medicine,
UCLA). In the same vector, two myc-Tag sequences (GAGCAGAAGCTG
ATCTCAGAGGAGGATCTGGAGC AGAAGCTGATCTCAGAGGAGGATCTG)
were added between the 4th and 5th codons of human GABAAR β3
cDNA that code for the amino acids belonging to the N-terminus
of the protein (NZYTech). To obtain the phospho-mimetic and a
phospho-null mutants of the human GABAAR β3 subunit, we performed
a site directed mutagenesis of the serine residues 432/433 (homologous
of mouse 408/409), using QuikChange® II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Kit (Agilent Technology). Brieﬂy, speciﬁc primers were designed to
mutate the two serine residues to two aspartate residues (5′
gcacaagaagacccatctacggaggagggatgatcagctcaaaattaaaatacctgatctaac
3′), in the case of the phospho-mimetic mutant, and to two alanine
residues (5′ gacccatctacggaggagggctgcacagctcaaaattaaaat 3′) in the
case of the phospho-null mutant (primers were synthesized by
Sigma–Aldrich). For each mutagenesis the reaction contained
13.5 ng of dsDNA template (myc-huGABAAR β3), 5 μl of 10 × reaction buffer, 125 ng of each oligonucleotide primer, 1 μl of dNTP
mix, 3 μl of QuikSolution, ddH 2 O to ﬁnal volume of 50 μl and 1 μl
of PfuUltra HF DNA polymerase (2.5 U/μl). The following thermal cycling was then performed: 95 °C for 1 min, 18 cycles (95 °C for 50 s,
60 °C for 50 s, 68 °C for 6 min 30 s) and 68 °C for 7 min. The parental
methylated dsDNA was then digested using 1 μl of Dpn I enzyme
(New England BioLabs) at 37 °C for 1 h. Dpn I digested dsDNA was
used to transform E. coli Top 10 cells to be then ampliﬁed. The obtained plasmid DNA was extracted using Plasmid Mini Kit
(Quiagen) and sequenced to conﬁrm the mutagenesis (STABvida).

Middle cerebral artery occlusion
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by the transient occlusion of
the right middle cerebral artery (MCA), using the intraluminal ﬁlament
placement technique as described previously (Nygren and Wieloch,
2005). Brieﬂy, adult male mice were anesthetized by inhalation of
2.5% isoﬂurane (IsobaVet, Schering-Plough Animal Health) in O2:N2O
(30:70). Anesthesia was subsequently reduced to 1.5–1.8% isoﬂurane
and sustained throughout the occlusion period. Body temperature was
kept at ~37 °C throughout the surgery period. To monitor regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF), an optical ﬁber probe (Probe 318-I, Perimed)
was ﬁxed to the skull at 2 mm posterior and 4 mm lateral to bregma,
and connected to a laser Doppler ﬂow meter (Periﬂux System 5000,
Perimed). A ﬁlament composed of 6–0 polydioxanone suture (PSD II,
Ethicon) with a silicone tip (diameter of 225–275 μm) was inserted
into the external carotid artery and advanced into the common carotid
artery. The ﬁlament was retracted, moved into the internal carotid artery, and advanced until the origin of the MCA, given by the sudden
drop in rCBF (~70% of baseline). After 45 min, the ﬁlament was withdrawn and reperfusion observed. The animals were placed in a heating
box at 37 °C for the ﬁrst 2 h after surgery and thereafter transferred into
a heating box at 35 °C, to avoid postsurgical hypothermia. Thirty minutes and 24 h after the onset of reperfusion, 0.5 ml of 5% glucose was
administered subcutaneously. Temperature and sensorimotor deﬁcits
were assessed at 1, 2 h and 24 h after the surgery. Body weight was controlled daily. In sham surgeries, the ﬁlament was advanced up to the

36 week old C57BL/6J male mice (weight: 23.0 g to 37.9 g; Lund University breeding facility) were housed under diurnal conditions with ad
libitum access to water and food before and after surgery.

Mice were anesthetized 48 h after MCA occlusion (MCAO) or sham
surgery, by inhalation of 2.5% isoﬂurane, and were then perfused
transcardially with 0.9% NaCl for 2 min before decapitation. Upon removal of meninges, brains were rapidly isolated and frozen by immersion in isopentane at − 40 °C, further cooled down to − 70 °C and
stored at −80 °C. The infarct core and remaining ipsilateral tissue (designated as penumbra for simpliﬁcation) were dissected, as well as the
contralateral cortex, from coronal brain sections covering the majority
of damage. More speciﬁcally, consecutive 2 mm, 1 mm and 2 mm
thick brain sections were made, starting at 2 mm from the olfactory
bulb. Dissections were performed at −15 °C, a temperature that allows
an easy detachment of the infarct core and penumbra. The cortical–
striatal infarcts obtained were illustrated in Inacio et al. (2011). Equivalent brain regions were dissected from sham-operated mice, which
were also designated as infarct core and penumbra, and contralateral
cortex. For each animal, corresponding regions from each of 3 consecutive brain sections were pulled together. Samples were then homogenized and processed for Western blotting as previously described
(Inacio et al., 2011). Cellular protein extraction was performed by
mechanical homogenization of the tissue and incubation in lysis buffer:
20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% TritonX100, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mM
orthovanadate and 1 mM PMSF, supplemented with a protease inhibitor
cocktail (P8340, Sigma–Aldrich). Following 30 min incubation at 4 °C,
samples were centrifuged at 18,000 ×, for 15 min. Total protein concentration in lysates was determined by the Bradford assay, using bovine albumin (Sigma) as standard.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA analysis of
variance, followed by Dunnett's or Bonferroni post-hoc test, or using
Student's t test, as indicated in the ﬁgure captions.
Results
OGD induces cell death and downregulates GABAAR subunit total protein
levels by a calpain-dependent mechanism
OGD is a well-established in vitro model of global cerebral ischemia
(Dawson et al., 1996; Goldberg and Choi, 1993; Martin et al., 1994). Exposure of cultured hippocampal neurons to OGD for 60 min‐120 min induced a time-dependent cell death, as determined by analysis of nuclear
morphology 7 h or 12 h after the insult (S. Fig. 1). The short periods of
OGD tested, 60 min or 75 min, induced ~ 20% cell death, while 90 min
or 120 min of OGD induced ~ 30% and ~ 40% cell death, respectively.
We did not observe signiﬁcant differences in cell death between the
two post-incubation times used, 7 h and 12 h.
To assess the effect of OGD on GABAAR subunit total protein levels,
cultured hippocampal neurons were subjected to 90 min of OGD, and
further incubated in the culture conditioned medium for 8 h. GABAAR
subunit protein levels were analyzed by Western blot using speciﬁc antibodies against α1, α2, β3, γ2 and δ subunits. α1, α2, β3, γ2 and subunits are localized preferentially at the synapses (Alldred et al., 2005;
Nusser et al., 1998), mediating phasic inhibition (Brickley et al., 1996),
in contrast with the δ subunit which is extrasynaptic (Nusser et al.,
1998). The results show a downregulation of all the synaptic GABAAR
subunits, of ~40% for α1 subunits, ~20% for α2 subunits, and ~ 35% for
β3 and γ2 subunits (Fig. 1A–D), but no effect was found for the δ subunit
(Fig. 1E). Shorter periods of OGD (60 min) did not affect GABAAR total
protein levels (not shown). Similar to the results obtained in hippocampal neurons subjected to OGD, a downregulation of α1, β3 and γ2 subunits was observed in the infarct core of mice subjected to transient
MCAO, a model of focal brain ischemia, but no effect was found for the
δ subunit. No signiﬁcant changes in GABAAR subunit protein levels
were observed in the penumbra (Fig. 1F).

The OGD-induced [Ca2+]i overload activates calpains (Brorson et al.,
1995; Saido et al., 1994; Vanderklish and Bahr, 2000) which cleave numerous intracellular proteins in the ischemic brain (Bevers and Neumar,
2008). To investigate whether calpains are involved in the OGD-induced
downregulation of GABAAR subunits, hippocampal neurons were subjected to OGD in the presence or in the absence of the chemical inhibitors ALLN or MDL28170. Western blot analysis performed 8 h after
injury showed that MDL28170 fully abrogated the effect of OGD on
α1, β3, α2 and γ2 GABAAR subunits (p N 0.05) (Fig. 1A–E). Furthermore, ALLN clearly prevented the reduction of β3 and α2 subunits in
hippocampal neurons subjected to OGD (Fig. 1B,C).
OGD downregulates the GABAAR subunit mRNA through activation of
glutamate receptors
Considering the effect of OGD on the protein levels of GABAAR subunits, which is maintained 8 h after injury, we hypothesized that
in vitro ischemia could also downregulate the mRNA for the various subunits causing a long-term effect on the synthesis of new receptors.
Quantitative PCR experiments showed a decrease in the expression
levels of α1, α2, β2, β3 and γ GABAAR subunits in hippocampal neurons
subjected to OGD for 90 min, and further incubated in the conditioned
medium for 5 h (S. Fig. 2), but no effect was observed for shorter periods
of in vitro ischemia (75 min), even when determined 7 h after the insult
(S. Fig. 3A–D). The former experimental conditions led to a 70% reduction in the mRNA levels of α1, 50% in α2 and β2, 25% in β3 and 40% in
γ2 subunits, which are typically found in synaptic receptors. In contrast,
no changes in the mRNA levels for the extrasynaptic GABAAR δ subunits
were observed, even for 90 min of OGD (S. Fig. 2 F). The OGD-induced
downregulation of mRNA levels for α1, α2, β2, β3 and γ2 subunits
was prevented by incubation with the NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate receptors inhibitors APV (100 μM) and NBQX (20 μM) (S. Fig. 2A
′–E′). We have previously shown a role for glutamate receptors in
hippocampal neuronal death following OGD, as determined by nuclear
morphology analysis (Caldeira et al., 2013). Although OGD decreased
the mRNA levels for α1, α2, β2, β3 subunits, inhibition of transcription
is unlikely to contribute to the observed downregulation of GABAAR protein levels since transcription blockage with actinomycin D for 9.5 h (the
maximal duration of the OGD experiments) did not affect the abundance
of α1, α2, β3 and γ2 protein levels (S. Fig. 4).
Downregulation of GABAAR α1 subunit/gephyrin interaction during OGD
The number of GABAAR at the synapse determines the strength of inhibitory signaling. These receptors are very dynamic structures in the
cell membrane, moving between synaptic and extrasynaptic sites
(Thomas et al., 2005), and their accumulation at the synapse is regulated by interaction with the scaffold protein gephyrin (Jacob et al., 2005).
To evaluate if GABAAR/gephyrin interaction is altered in ischemic conditions, a surface co-immunoprecipitation protocol was used. Exposure of
hippocampal neurons to OGD for 70 min, which does not affect total
GABAAR α1 subunit protein levels, signiﬁcantly reduced the interaction
between surface-expressed receptor subunit and gephyrin (Fig. 2A,C),
as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of surface subunits followed
by Western blot with an anti-gephyrin antibody (Fig. 2C). This effect
was completely inhibited by cyclosporin A (1 μM), a calcineurin inhibitor, but was insensitive to okadaic acid (0.5 μM), an inhibitor of PP1α
and PP2A phosphatases. In contrast, the decrease in total surface expression of GABAAR α1 subunits induced by OGD was completely abrogated in the presence of okadaic acid (Fig. 2B and C), but was insensitive
to cyclosporin A (1 μM). These results indicate that different protein
phosphatases mediate the effect of OGD on the dissociation of GABAAR
α1 subunits from gephyrin and the decrease in surface expression of
GABAARs, presumably due to an increase in the rate of internalization.
Control experiments showed no changes in total gephyrin (S. Fig. 5B)

Cultured hippocampal neurons were exposed to OGD for 70 min and biotinylated as described in the methods section. Where indicated the cells were incubated with okadaic acid (0.5 μM)
or with cyclosporin A (1 μM) during the OGD period. The surface GABAAR α1 subunits were analyzed by Western blot with a speciﬁc antibody after puriﬁcation with a surface coimmunoprecipitation assay (B). The co-immunoprecipitation of gephyrin with the surface GABAAR α1 subunits was also analyzed by Western blot with a speciﬁc antibody, and the
ratio between gephyrin associated with surface GABAAR α1 and the plasma membrane associated GABAAR α1 subunit is expressed in panel (A). A representative image is shown in
panel (C). Results are means ± SEM of at least 3 independent experiments performed in different preparations, and expressed as percentage of the control. GABAAR α1 protein levels

and GABAAR α1 (S. Fig. 5A) subunit protein levels under the experimental conditions used in these experiments.
Although okadaic acid did not affect the interaction between
gephyrin and GABAAR α1 subunits, Western blot experiments showed
a shift of the band corresponding to gephyrin in extracts prepared
from neurons incubated with okadaic acid (S. Fig. 5B, S. Fig. 6). This
shift did not correspond to an increase of total gephyrin protein levels,
as conﬁrmed by Western blot quantiﬁcation (S. Fig. 5B). To investigate
whether the shift in the gephyrin band was due to phoshorylation of
the scaffold protein, λ-phosphatase assay was performed. Indeed, the
observed shift in the gephyrin band was not observed when cell lysates
were incubated with λ-phosphatase (S. Fig. 6). Also, no shift in gephyrin
immunoreactivity was observed in extracts prepared from hippocampal
neurons subjected to OGD, further suggesting that the phosphorylation
sites regulated by protein phosphatases sensitive to okadaic acid are not
involved in the regulation of the interaction between gephyrin and
GABAAR α1 subunits.
OGD increases α1 GABAAR subunit internalization
From the functional point of view, it is the population of GABAAR associated with the plasma membrane that is expected to play a role in the
modulation of the demise process after OGD. To determine the rate at
which the cell-surface GABAARs are internalized, we used an antibody
feeding technique (Connolly et al., 1999; Lin et al., 2000) that allows
distinguishing the cell-surface and the internalized pools of native
GABAARs. Cell-surface GABAARs on living cultured hippocampal neurons were labeled with an anti-GABAAR-α1 (N-terminus) antibody.
Control experiments showed that astrocytes present in the cultures
(~ 10% of the cells) are not stained with the anti-GABAAR-α1 (Nterminus) antibody (not shown).
Under resting conditions the GABAAR α1 subunit presented a constant rate of internalization for 30 min, when about 80% of the surface
receptors were internalized. This rate of internalization, of about 10%
of the surface receptors/10 min, was calculated both in the soma and
neurites. In both compartments there was a pool of GABAAR α1 subunit,
corresponding to about 20% of the labeled proteins, which was stable
and did not undergo internalization during 60 min (Fig. 3A). Therefore,
in all other experiments the internalization of GABAAR α1 subunits was
followed for 10–20 min.
The effect of OGD on GABAAR α1 subunit internalization was tested
in hippocampal neurons subjected to the ischemic injury for 70 min,

which does not affect the total protein levels of the receptor subunit
(S. Fig. 5). The experimental conditions used induce about 20% cell
death as measured 7 h–12 h after the insult (S. Fig. 1). Labeling of surface receptors was performed immediately after OGD, to capture the
initial alterations in the mechanisms regulating the receptor trafﬁcking,
and receptor internalization was measured for different periods of time
(0–20 min). Immunocytochemistry analysis revealed ~25% increase in
the ratio of α1 subunit internalization compared to the correspondent
sham condition, when tested for 20 min (Fig. 3B and C), both in the
soma and neurite compartments. This effect was abolished when internalization was blocked by a hyperosmolar concentration of sucrose
(350 mM) (Fig. 3D and F), and with the speciﬁc dynamin inhibitor
dynasor (125 μM) (Fig. 3E and G). The OGD-induced internalization of
GABAAR-α1 subunits was fully abrogated (p N 0.05) when the cells
were treated with the NMDA receptor antagonist APV (100 μM), and
similar results were obtained in the presence of NMDA (100 μM APV)
and AMPA (20 μM NBQX) receptor antagonists (Fig. 4). The results obtained with the antibody feeding assay were similar in the soma and
neurites, and show that OGD-induces the internalization of GABAARα1 subunits by a dynamin-dependent mechanism that requires activation of NMDA receptors.
OGD-induced dephosphorylation of GABAAR β3 subunits leads to receptor
internalization and mediates cell death
The internalization of GABAAR is a process negatively regulated by
phosphorylation of β3 or γ2 GABAAR subunits intracellular loop
(Kittler et al., 2005, 2008). The GABAAR β3 subunits are present in a
large proportion of receptor subtypes in the hippocampus and cortex,
regions that are particularly vulnerable to excitotoxicity (Lo et al.,
2003). To evaluate if the observed increase of GABAAR internalization
(Fig. 3) is mediated by receptor dephosphorylation, the levels of GABAAR β3 subunit phosphorylation were evaluated by Western blot analysis
using a phospho-speciﬁc antibody against the β3 subunit serine residues 408/409 (mouse sequence) (Fig. 5). After 70 min of OGD, GABAAR
β3 subunit phosphorylation was reduced by 60% (Fig. 5A,B), and a decrease in β3 subunit phosphorylation was also observed in the infarct
core after transient MCAO (Fig. 5C,D). The effect of OGD on GABAAR
β3 subunit phosphorylation level was reduced when the NMDA receptor inhibitor AP-5 (100 μM) was used (Fig. 5A). These observations are
correlated with the role of NMDA receptors in OGD-induced internalization of GABAAR α1 subunits (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the effect of OGD on

Receptor internalization was assessed through an antibody-feeding assay and analyzed by ﬂuorescence microscopy in cells labelled with an anti-GABAAR-α1 (N-terminus) antibody. A time-course analysis of receptor internalization was performed in basal conditions (in the culture
conditioned medium) to validate the method (A). After quantiﬁcation of the images at the soma and dendritic compartments, the results were expressed as a ratio of internalized receptors/total receptor immunoreactivity. Different internalization periods were also tested in cells subjected to OGD (70 min) or maintained under control conditions (sham) before incubation with the anti-α1 GABAAR subunit antibody (B, C). Panels (D–G) show the effect of an hyperosmolar concentration of sucrose (350 mM) (D, F) and treatment with the dynamin
inhibitor Dynasor (125 μM) (E, G) on the internalization of the α1 GABAAR subunit. Internalization of α1 GABAAR subunits was allowed for 20 min. When the effect of an hyperosmolar
treatment was tested, the cells were incubated with 350 mM sucrose during the incubation period of surface receptor live staining and during the internalization period. The same strategy
was adopted in the experiments with dynasor. Results are means ± SEM of at least 3 independent experiments, performed in different preparations. At least 10 cells were analyzed for
each experimental condition/experiment. Internalization ratio was calculated by the ratio internalized antibody signal/total antibody signal. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way

Fig. 4. OGD-induced GABAAR α1 subunit internalization is mediated by activation of glutamate receptors. Cultured hippocampal neurons were subjected to OGD (70 min) or maintained
under control conditions (sham), and the internalization of GABAAR (20 min) was assessed through an antibody-feeding assay. When the effect of glutamate receptor antagonists was
tested, the cells were pre-incubated (or not) with NBQX (20 μM) and AP-5 (100 μM) for 30 min before OGD, and the inhibitors were also present during the whole experimental period.
Representative ﬂuorescence images are shown in panel (B) and the results in (A) are means ± SEM of at least 3 independent experiments performed in independent preparations. At least

β3 subunit dephosphorylation was prevented when neurons were incubated with 0.5 μM okadaic acid (PP1/PP2A phosphatase inhibitor) but
not in the presence of 1 μ M cyclosporin A (calcineurin inhibitor)
(Fig. 5B).
In vitro studies showed that phosphorylation of GABAAR β3 subunit,
on serine residues 408/409, negatively regulates receptor endocytosis
(Terunuma et al., 2008). These two serine residues are located in an
AP2-binding motif conserved within the intracellular domain of all
GABAAR subunit isoforms (KTHLRRRSSQLK) (Kittler et al., 2005). To
evaluate the role of β3 subunit dephosphorylation in the increase of
GABAAR internalization during OGD, and its contribution to the
excitotoxicity-induced neuronal death, we made phosphomutants of
the GABAAR β3 subunit. Cultured hippocampal neurons (13 DIV) were
transfected with the myc-tagged wild-type or the phospho-mimetic
form (SS432/433DD) (homologous of mouse 408/409) of the huGABAAR β3 subunit, subjected to OGD for 90 min and further incubated in the
culture conditioned medium for 12 h. The transfected cells were identiﬁed by immunocytochemistry with an anti-myc antibody (as shown in
Fig. 6B), and nuclear morphology analysis of transfected cells (Fig. 6A)
showed a protective effect of the phospho-mimetic form of the receptor
that reduced OGD-induced cell death by about 50% when compared
with the wild-type β3 subunit. In contrast, non-transfected cells in the
two types of cultures exhibited a similar rate of OGD-induced neuronal
death (Fig. 6A′), showing the speciﬁcity of the effects resulting from the

expression of the phospho-mimetic form (SS432/433DD) of the
huGABAAR β3 subunit.
The surface expression of the myc-tagged GABAAR β3 subunit mutant was evaluated by immunocytochemistry with an anti-myc antibody under non-permeabilizing conditions (see Fig. 6C). The SS432/
433DD mutant of the GABAAR β3 subunits presented an increased surface expression in transfected hippocampal neurons, both in control
condition and after OGD (70 min), when compared to the WT GABAAR
β3 subunits (Fig. 6D and D′). In contrast, transfection with the phosphonull mutant of GABAAR β3 subunits reduced the surface expression of
the receptor, both in the somal (Fig. 6D) and neuritic compartments
(Fig. 6D′). The total expression of the myc-tagged wild-type, phosphomimetic (SS432/433DD) and phospho-null (SS432/433AA) forms of
the GABAAR β3 subunit was evaluated by immunocytochemistry with
an anti-myc antibody after permeabilization, showing similar expression
level of these proteins (S. Fig. 7). The internalization rate of myc-tagged
wild type, phospho-mimetic and phospho-null GABAAR β3 subunits, in
cultured hippocampal neurons maintained under control conditions or
subjected to OGD, was assessed using the antibody feeding technique
(see Fig. 6F). A decrease in internalization ratio was observed for the
phospho-mimetic mutant when compared with the WT GABAAR β3, in
contrast with the phospho-null mutant which showed no alteration in
internalization. Differential analysis of soma (Fig. 6E) and neurites
(Fig. 6E′) showed similar results for the two cellular compartments.

Discussion
Stroke, or cerebral ischemia, is characterized by an early disruption
of GABAergic neurotransmission due to alterations at both pre- and
post-synaptic sides of the GABAergic synapse (Schwartz-Bloom and
Sah, 2001), but the molecular mechanisms involved are not fully

understood. In this work we show a key role for protein phosphatases
in the regulation of GABAAR α1 subunit interaction with the anchoring
protein gephyrin, which is responsible for receptor clustering at the synapse, and in the internalization of GABAAR in hippocampal neurons subjected to OGD, an in vitro model of global ischemia. In particular, the
dephosphorylation of β3 GABAARs subunits was found to play a key

(A) Cultured hippocampal neurons were transfected with the myctagged wild-type or the phospho-mimetic form (Ser408/409) of the GABAAR β3 subunit and subjected to OGD for 90 min, before incubation in the culture conditioned medium for 12 h.
Where indicated (sham) the cells were treated under control conditions. The transfected cells were identiﬁed by immunocytochemistry with an anti-myc antibody, and the viability of

role in receptor internalization following OGD and the resulting loss of
inhibitory activity contributes to neuronal death.
Using the antibody feeding assay we observed an increased internalization of GABAAR α1 and β3 subunits in hippocampal neurons subjected to OGD. The α1 GABAAR subunit is greatly expressed in the
hippocampus (Hortnagl et al., 2013; Laurie et al., 1992; Wisden et al.,
1992), a brain region that is highly vulnerable to ischemic conditions

229

(Kirino and Sano, 1984; Schmidt-Kastner and Freund, 1991; Sugawara
et al., 1999). The OGD-induced internalization of GABAAR α1 subunits
was mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and required glutamate receptor activation. A similar mechanism was shown to contribute
to the internalization of GABAAR in an in vitro model of epilepsy, a condition also characterized by excitation/inhibition imbalance (Goodkin
et al., 2005).

230

GABAARs are clustered at the synapse through interaction with
gephyrin (Tyagarajan and Fritschy, 2010), and the GABAAR α1 subunits
were shown to interact directly with the scaffold protein (Mukherjee
et al., 2011; Tretter et al., 2011). This is in agreement with the results obtained in the present study showing that surface GABAAR α1 subunits
co-immunoprecipitate with gephyrin. The interaction between α1
GABAAR subunit and gephyrin promotes the receptor accumulation at
inhibitory synapses, by limiting its lateral diffusion, and this interaction
depends on residues 360–375 of the α1 subunit that bind directly to
gephyrin (Mukherjee et al., 2011). Modulating this interaction via covalent modiﬁcations, such as phosphorylation, may be a potent mechanism to control the strength of fast GABAergic signaling. We observed
that OGD signiﬁcantly decreases the co-immunoprecipitation of surface
GABAAR α1 subunits with gephyrin, by a mechanism sensitive to
calcineurin inhibition. Since calcineurin had no effect on the apparent
mobility of gephyrin in SDS-PAGE, the results suggest that the phosphatase may dephosphorylate GABAAR (Kapur and Lothman, 1990). The
induction of long-term depression at CA1 inhibitory synapses also resulted in a reduction in the synaptic GABAAR number by a calcineurindependent mechanism (Wang et al., 2003), while a direct effect of calcineurin on the functional properties of GABAAR was proposed in a different study (Jones and Westbrook, 1997). The effect of calcineurin on
the dissociation of gephyrin-GABAAR α1 complexes induced by OGD
clearly favors the former mechanism of action. However, at this point
it is not possible to rule out an effect of OGD on the activity of protein
kinase(s) responsible for the phosphorylation of the amino acid residues targeted by calcineurin (Chapell et al., 1998; Connolly et al.,
1999; Filippova et al., 2000; Jovanovic et al., 2004).
The possibility that gephyrin phosphorylation might regulate
GABAAR binding to gephyrin, and their post-synaptic localization or
trafﬁcking, has not been investigated. Evidences available for glycine receptors (GlyR) demonstrate that proline-directed phosphorylation of

gephyrin may induce a conformational change favoring GlyR binding
(Tyagarajan and Fritschy, 2010; Zita et al., 2007). Several studies identiﬁed gephyrin as a target for serine/threonine directed phosphorylation
(Beausoleil et al., 2006; Lundby et al., 2012), and a recent study detailed
18 different phosphorylation residues on gephyrin (Herweg and
Schwarz, 2012), suggesting a key role for phosphorylation in the regulation of gephyrin function. Moreover, given that phosphorylation and
[Ca2 +]i rise make gephyrin susceptible to proteolysis by calpain
(Tyagarajan et al., 2013) the neuronal activity-driven gephyrin dynamics could very likely be phosphorylation-dependent. Accordingly,
gephyrin phosphorylation on Ser268 is important for scaling (up or
down) GABAergic transmission (Tyagarajan et al., 2013).
In contrast with the role of calcineurin in OGD-induced dissociation
of gephyrin–GABAAR α1 complexes, the dephosphorylation of GABAAR
β3 subunits under the same conditions is mediated by okadaic acidsensitive protein phosphatases (PP1 and/or PP2A). Recruitment of
GABAARs into the endocytic pathway is facilitated via the interactions
of the intracellular domains of β1–3 and γ2 subunits with μ2-AP2
(Kittler et al., 2005, 2008). This motif incorporates the major sites of
phosphorylation for PKC and PKA, corresponding to serine residues
S408 and S409 in the case of the GABAAR β3 subunit (mouse sequence)
(Brandon et al., 2002; McDonald and Moss, 1997). Phosphorylation of
these sites has been shown to impair GABAAR endocytosis by
preventing the interaction of the β3 subunit with AP2 (Jacob et al.,
2009; Kittler et al., 2005). The role of GABAAR β3 dephosphorylation
in receptor internalization and neuronal death in hippocampal neurons
subjected to OGD is supported by the following evidences: i) OGD reduced the phosphorylation of GABAAR β3 subunit by a mechanism sensitive to okadaic acid, as determined by Western blot with a
phosphospeciﬁc antibody against serine residues 408/409; ii) the
phospho-mimetic mutant of GABAAR β3 subunit (SS432/433AA) was
accumulated at cell surface and showed no OGD-induced

Fig. 7. Model of GABA A R internalization during cerebral ischemia. Ischemic insult (1) over-activates NMDAR signaling (2) and the resulting activation of calcineurin decreases GABA A R/gephyrin interaction (3). In parallel, OGD reduces phosphorylation of the GABA A R β3 subunit by a mechanism sensitive to okadaic acid (4), inducing
the internalization of GABA A R via clathrin dependent endocytosis (5, 6).

M. Mele et al. / Neurobiology of Disease 65 (2014) 220 –232

internalization; iii) the same mutation reduced signiﬁcantly OGDinduced cell death. The neuroprotection provided by the phosphomimetic mutant of GABAAR β3 subunit, resulting from receptor activation by endogenous GABA, is highly remarkable considering that less
than 10% of the cells present in the culture are GABAergic (Baptista
et al., 2010). The triple arginine motif of the β3 GABAAR subunit that
mediates direct binding of the receptor to the clathrin adaptor protein
AP2 plays a key role in regulating the surface distribution of the receptor
(Smith et al., 2012). A peptide overlapping the AP2 binding region in the
β3 subunit, to compete the β3/AP2 interaction, was shown to decrease
OGD-induced cell death. However, this strategy does not rule out nonspeciﬁc effects on the internalization of other plasma membrane proteins, which may interact with AP2 on the same binding motif. This evidence together with our result showing the protective effect of GABAAR
stabilization in the membrane, strongly support the idea that GABAA R internalization is a potential target for ischemia therapy and the
use of a molecule/peptide interacting with the β3 subunit residue
responsible for the receptor internalization could be a good strategy
to test in vivo for the treatment of cerebral ischemia.
In addition to the effect on the surface expression of GABAARs, OGD
also downregulated the total protein levels and mRNA for several
GABAAR subunits, which is likely to have a delayed and long-lasting effect on GABAergic synaptic transmission. At least some of the effects of
OGD on GABAAR subunits (e.g. α2 and β3) are mediated by calpains. In
addition to the effect on GABAAR subunits, the activation of calpains in
ischemic condition results in the cleavage of a number of neuronal substrates that affect neuronal structure and function, leading to inhibition
of neuronal survival mechanisms (Vosler et al., 2008). The OGD-induced
downregulation of the mRNA levels for α1, α2, β2, β3 and γ2 GABAA receptor subunits was mediated by activation of glutamate receptors and
would prevent the replenishment of the GABAAR pool degraded in response to the injury. Interestingly, under the OGD conditions used the
mRNA levels for the GABAAR δ subunit were not signiﬁcantly altered.
Considering that this subunit is found at extrasynaptic regions (Nusser
et al., 1998), the results suggest that OGD has differential effects on
the synaptic and extrasynaptic pools of GABAARs.
In conclusion, we showed that the (de)phosphorylation site of
GABAAR β3 subunits on serines 408/409 (mouse sequence) is a master
regulator of GABAAR surface localization in ischemic conditions, and receptor internalization contributes to the death of hippocampal neurons
after transient OGD. Recruitment of GABAAR for internalization is induced by glutamate receptor activation and follows the impairment in
their interaction with the scaffold protein gephyrin, by a mechanism
that is also regulated by protein phosphatases (Fig. 7). The degradation
of GABAARs and the downregulation of their mRNAs may further reduce
GABAergic synaptic transmission. Taken together, these results suggest
that modulation of GABAAR phosphorylation might be a therapeutic target to preserve synaptic inhibition in brain ischemia.
