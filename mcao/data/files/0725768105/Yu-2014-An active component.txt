Abstract
An active component has been isolated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) from
Achyranthes bidentata Blume polypeptides that are extracted from Achyranthes bidentata Blume, a Chinese medicinal herb.
The active component is called ABPPk based on the order of HPLC elution. In this study, we used in vitro and in vivo
experimental models of cerebral ischemia to investigate the possible neuroprotective effect of ABPPk. ABPPk treatment
promoted neuronal survival and inhibited neuronal apoptosis in primary cortical neurons exposed to oxygen and glucose
deprivation and in rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. The role of ABPPk in protection against
ischemia-induced neuronal damage might be mediated by mitochondrial-dependent pathways, including modulation of
apoptosis-related gene expression, regulation of mitochondrial dysfunction through restoring mitochondrial membrane
potential, reducing release of mitochondrial apoptogenic factors, and inhibiting intracellular ROS production. The
neuroprotective effect of ABPPk may suggest the possible use of this agent in the treatment and prevention of cerebral
ischemic stroke.

uated the glutamate-induced apoptosis in primary hippocampal
neurons, supported recovery from experimental cerebral ischemia
in vivo [3–5], and promoted peripheral nerve regeneration in
rodents with sciatic nerve crush through stimulating release of
growth factors [6,7]. To improve the pharmaceutical value of
ABPP, we used DEAE anion exchange high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) to separate the components of ABPP,
one of which (referred to as ABPP-E4) exhibited protective effects
against serum deprivation-induced neuronal apoptosis in SHSY5Y cells [8]. On the other hand, we used reverse phase HPLC
to separate several active components from ABPP, and one of
these components, called ABPPk according to the elution order on
C18 reverse phase column, showed the best neuroactivity among
all components.
This study was designed to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of ABPPk by using the aforementioned in vitro and
in vivo models of cerebral ischemia. We found that ABPPk
inhibited neuronal insult in primary cortical neurons exposed to

Introduction
Cerebral ischemic stroke is a major cause of death and disability
worldwide. This neurological disease is caused by an obstruction of
blood flow to the brain, which triggers the onset of ischemic
cascades, including energy failure, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress,
inflammation, and apoptosis. To understand the molecular
mechanisms of neuronal damage during ischemic stroke, and
develop neuroprotective drugs/agents against ischemic injury,
oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) are extensively used as in vitro and in vivo
models of cerebral ischemia, respectively.
Achyranthes bidentata Blume (Amaranthaceae family), a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has a range of pharmacological
properties [1]. The aqueous extract of Achyranthes bidentata
Blume has been shown to promote peripheral nerve regeneration
in rabbits with crush injury to the common peroneal nerve [2].
From the aqueous extract of Achyranthes bidentata Blume, we
isolated Achyranthes bidentata polypeptides (ABPP), which attenPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

After exposure to OGD, primary cortical neurons showed
morphological alterations, such as neurite disappearance and
vacuolus emergence around the cell body, but ABPPk treatment
enabled OGD-injured neurons to reestablish the normal cell
morphology (Fig. 1D).
To determine the neuroprotective action of ABPPk in vivo, rats
were subjected to MCAO-induced ischemia. At the end of MCAO
and the start of reperfusion, rats were intravenously (iv)
administered with 1 ml of 0.1, 0.2, or 1.0 mg/kg ABPPk, 1 ml
of 1.0 mg/kg nimodipine, and 1 ml of saline (vehicle), respectively.
The neurological deficits were then evaluated by measuring the
percentage of animal death (mortality), modified neurological
severity score (mNSS), and brain infarct volume. Each of 3 indexes
was significantly higher in MCAO rats treated with saline (control)
than in sham-MCAO rats. ABPPk treatment reversed MCAOinduced increase in 3 indexes in a dose-dependent manner with
significant differences in mNSS and brain infarct volume
occurring between treatment with 0.2 or 1.0 mg/kg of ABPPk
and treatment with saline. However, the reversing effect of all
doses of ABPPk was slightly lower than that of 1.0 mg/kg
nimodipine (Fig. 2).

OGD and in rats subjected to MCAO-induced brain ischemia.
We also explored the mitochondrial regulation mechanisms
responsible for neuroprotection of ABPPk.

Results
ABPPk reduced cell viability loss in primary cortical
neurons exposed to OGD and diminished brain infarct
formation in rats subjected to MCAO
ABPP was separated by reverse-phase HPLC with a photodiode
array (PDA) detector to obtain 12 different HPLC fractions. These
ABPP components were labeled as ABPPa, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k,
l, respectively, according to the elution order. A representative
chromatogram was recorded at 220 nm (Fig. 1A). 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay was used to determine cell survival of primary cortical
neurons after cell treatments. Exposure to OGD decreased cell
viability of primary cortical neurons as compared to control (no
treatment). An equal dose (1.0 mg/ml) of 12 ABPP components
was used to treat OGD-injured primary cortical neurons. MTT
assay compared the effects of 12 ABPP components on cell
viability, and confirmed that only ABPPk treatment significantly
attenuated OGD-induced decrease in cell viability (Fig. 1B).
Furthermore, the effect of ABPPk (dose range, 0.04–1.0 mg/ml)
displayed a dose-dependent pattern, and 0.2 or 1.0 mg/ml of
ABPPk yielded the neuroprotective effect similar to that of 10 mM
nimodipine, a calcium-channel blocker, which was chosen as
positive control in this study (Fig. 1C). It should be mentioned that
treatment with ABPPk alone caused no cytotoxicity on primary
cortical neurons (data not shown).

ABPPk protected primary cortical neurons and rat brain
against ischemia-induced neuronal apoptosis
Hoechst 33342 staining indicated that following OGD, about
31% of primary cortical neurons exhibited apoptotic changes,
such as chromatin condensation, nuclear shrinkage, and/or
formation of apoptotic bodies, while ABPPk treatment reduced
OGD-induced increase in the number of apoptotic cells (Fig. 3).

biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay showed that MCAO
induced a remarkable increase in the number of apoptotic
(TUNEL-positive) cells, while ABPPk treatment significantly
decreased MCAO-induced increase in the number of apoptotic
(TUNEL-positive) cells (Fig. 4).

ABPPk reversed OGD-induced reduction of mitochondrial
membrane potential in primary cortical neurons
A fall in mitochondrial membrane potential (DYM) is one of the
earliest events in apoptosis [9]. Therefore, we examined the effect
of ABPPk on DYM of primary cortical neurons using 5,59,6,69tetrachloro-1,19,3,39-tetraethyl-benzimidazol- carbocyanine iodide
(JC-1), a mitochondrial-specific fluorescent probe. JC-1 staining of
mitochondria caused a typical distribution of red and green
fluorescent signals in primary cortical neurons without any
treatment (control). After exposure to OGD, the DYM in primary
cortical neurons was significantly decreased, as indicated by an
increase in green fluorescence and a decrease in red fluorescence.
Treatment with ABPPk as well as nimodipine protected primary
cortical neurons against OGD-induced decrease in DYM, or
increase in mitochondrial depolarization (Fig. 6A).
Flow cytometry with JC-1 staining was used to confirm that
ABPPk treatment prevented OGD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in primary cortical neurons. The stained cells could be
classified into four subpopulations: group A, those with high red
and low green fluorescence representing normal mitochondrial
polarization; group B, those with low red and low green
fluorescence representing dead cells or debris; group C, those
with high red and high green fluorescence representing normal
mitochondrial polarization and cells with mitochondrial depolarization; and group D, those with low red and high green

ABPPk inhibited caspase-3 activation in primary cortical
neurons and in rat brain after ischemic insult
Western blot analysis was applied to determine the protein
expression of procaspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 in the cell and
tissue sample after ischemic insult.
It is known that ischemic injury triggers proteolytic processing of
procaspase-3, resulting in the formation of a 17 kD subunit of the
cleaved caspase-3 (active caspase-3). In this study, the expression of
cleaved caspase-3 significantly increased in OGD-injured primary
cortical neurons as compared to control cells while the expression
of procaspase-3 was slightly decreased, and ABPPk treatment
significantly antagonized OGD-induced upregulation of cleaved
caspase-3 in primary cortical neurons in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 5A). Similarly, a remarkable increase in cleaved caspase-3
expression was observed in the brain tissue of MCAO rats, and
ABPPk treatment also significantly alleviated MCAO-induced
upregulation of cleaved caspase-3 in the brain tissue in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 5B).

fluorescence representing mitochondrial depolarization. According to flow cytometric analysis, OGD decreased the ratio of red to
green fluorescence (the ratio of mitochondrial polarization to
mitochondrial depolarization) in JC-1 stained primary cortical
neurons, but ABPPk treatment increased the cell population with
normal mitochondrial polarization and decreased the cell population with mitochondrial depolarization in a dose-dependent
manner. In other words, ABPPk could recover OGD-induced
mitochondrial dysfunction in primary cortical neurons (Fig. 6B
and 6C).

ABPPk suppressed release of cytochrome c and
apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) in primary cortical
neurons exposed to OGD
During focal cerebral ischemia, both the loss of DYM and
dysregulation of Bcl-2 family members modulate the apoptosis
pathway and subsequently lead to the release of pro-apoptotic
cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) [11]. In this
study, Western blot analysis indicated that exposure to OGD
induced mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and AIF in
primary cortical neurons (Fig. 8). ABPPk treatment, in a dosedependent manner, suppressed OGD-stimulated release of these 2
cell death mediators. The significant effects of ABPPk were
observed at all 3 doses (0.04, 0.2 and 1.0 mg/ml) for both
cytochrome c release and AIF release.

ABPPk affected protein expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and
Bax in primary cortical neurons exposed to OGD
The intrinsic mitochondrial pathway of ischemia-induced
apoptosis is mainly regulated by caspases and Bcl-2 family
members [10,11]. Bcl-2 family includes anti-apoptotic members
(such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL) and pro-apoptotic members (such as Bax,
Bad, Bak, Bik, and Bcl-xs) [12]. In this study, we determined the
changes in the protein expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bax using
Western blot analysis. Exposure to OGD reduced the expression
of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, but enhanced the expression of Bax. ABPPk
treatment, in a dose-dependent manner, antagonized OGDinduced down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and OGD-induced
up-regulation of Bax, and significant reversing effects of ABPPk
were achieved by 3 doses (0.04, 0.2 and 1.0 mg/ml) for Bcl-xL
expression, 1 dose (1.0 mg/ml) for Bcl-2 expression, and 2 doses
(0.2 and 1.0 mg/ml) for Bax expression (Fig. 7).

ABPPk inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production in primary cortical neurons exposed to OGD
Molecular probe, 29,79-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFHDA), was used to monitor intracellular ROS levels in a microplate
fluorometer [13]. ROS production was measured immediately in
OGD-injured primary cortical neurons at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
30 min after OGD in the presence or absence of 3 doses of ABPPk
or 50 mM vitamin E. Exposure of cortical neurons to OGD insult
caused elevation of ROS production. ABPPk suppressed OGDinduced elevation in ROS production, showing a dose-dependent
pattern (Fig. 9).

inhibited activation and cleavage of caspase-3 in OGD and
MCAO models.
Mitochondria are membrane-bound organelles that oxidize
complex metabolic fuel. It has long been thought that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of various
neurological disorders, including stroke [17–19]. Accordingly,
mitochondria are important in regulating both caspase-dependent
and -independent apoptotic pathways [20]. Mitochondrial alterations, in particular the collapse of DYM, is believed to be an early
event in the apoptotic process and to affect mitochondrial
membrane permeability and release of cytochrome c and AIF
[21–23]. To determine the effect of ABPPk on DYM, the
membrane-permeant JC-1 dye was used to monitor the change
in DYM [24]. JC-1 exhibits DYM-dependent accumulation in
mitochondria, as indicated by a fluorescence emission shift from
green (JC-1 monomer fluorescence, em = 525 nm) to red (Jaggregate fluorescence, em = 590 nm). The green fluorescence
(monomeric form) represents a lower DYM, whereas the red
fluorescence (aggregate form) represents a high DYM. DYM can be
expressed as the intensity ratio of red fluorescence to green
fluorescence. A reduction in the intensity ratio (DYM) represents
mitochondrial depolarization. Confocal microscopy and flow
cytometry of JC-1 staining indicated that ABPPk recovered
OGD-induced mitochondrial depolarization, suggesting that the
neuroprotective effect of ABPPk might be linked to the recovery of
DYM.
Apoptosis-related gene family plays a role in intracellular
apoptotic signal transduction by regulating the mitochondrial

Discussion
ABPPk, an active HPLC fraction from ABPP, was investigated
for its potential neuroprotective action in experimental models of
cerebral ischemia designed both under in vivo and in vitro
conditions. ABPPk itself caused no deleterious effects on primary
cortical neurons, which may be taken as a prerequisite for
examining the protective effect of ABPPk. After exposure of
primary cortical neurons to OGD (an in vitro model used to
mimic cerebral ischemia), MTT assay as well as morphological
observation showed that ABPPk rescued OGD-induced cell
viability loss in primary cortical neurons. Similarly, intravenous
administration of ABPPk to MCAO rats (an in vivo model used to
mimic cerebral ischemia) reduced the mortality of rats and
improved neurological deficit parameters in a dose-dependent
manner.
Although the core of infarct zone exposed to the most dramatic
blood flow reduction undergoes necrotic cell death, many neurons
in the ischemic penumbra or peri-infarct zone may undergo
apoptosis at a considerable period after stroke, and thus they are
potentially recoverable via post-stroke therapy [14,15]. To test the
effects of ABPPk on the nuclear changes associated with apoptosis,
Hoechst and TUNEL staining were performed. The results
indicated that ABPPk was likely to attenuate OGD- or MCAOinduced neuronal apoptosis, or contribute to the delay of neuronal
death. We also measured the expression of cleaved caspase-3
(17 kD) because it is the ultimate executioner caspase causing the
apoptosis-related nuclear changes [16]. We noted that ABPPk

membrane permeability [25,26]. Anti-apoptotic family members
(e.g. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) inhibit apoptosis by preventing mitochondrial depolarization [27], whereas pro-apoptotic family members
(e.g. Bax) promote apoptosis by inducing mitochondrial depolarization and cytochrome c release [28]. In this study, ABPPk
increased the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and decreased the
expression of Bax in primary cortical neurons exposed to OGD.
The results, together with the aforementioned observations about
mitochondrial changes, suggested that ABPPk-induced recovery of
mitochondrial dysfunction might be correlated to its modulation of
apoptosis-related gene expression.
The essential step in the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis
pathway is the formation of the apoptosome, a multimeric protein
complex consisting of cytochrome c, apoptotic protease activating
factor-1 (Apaf-1), pro-caspase 9, and adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) [29]. Cytosolic cytochrome c mediates the oligomerization
of Apaf-1 and the formation of the apoptosome complex, which
cleave the initiator caspase 9, thereby activating the terminal
caspases such as caspase-3, -6, and -7 [30]. At this point, release of
cytochrome c from mitochondria is vital for the formation of the
apoptosome. AIF is a putative caspase-independent effector to
regulate the mitochondrial membrane permeability upon apoptosis [31]. Normally AIF is found behind the outer membrane of the
mitochondrion. When the mitochondrion is damaged, however,
AIF moves to the cytosol and translocates to the nucleus, leading
to a caspase-independent cell death process, including DNA
fragmentation and chromatin condensation [32]. The release of
cytochrome c and AIF from mitochondria triggers downstream
caspase-3 activation and additional caspase-independent cell death
events and likely plays an important role in mediating neuronal
death after cerebral ischemia [33,34]. Blocking the release of
apoptogenic factors into the cytoplasm could prevent cell death
[35,36]. In this study, ABPPk abrogated the release of cytochrome
c and AIF from mitochondria in OGD-injured primary cortical
neurons, suggesting that the neuroprotective effect of ABPPk
might be mediated by mitochondrial blockade of apoptogenic
factors (cytochrome c and AIF).
Although the basic function of mitochondria is to generate ATP
by oxidative phosphorylation through the electron transport chain,
overproduction of ROS by mitochondria is involved in ischemic
injury [37,38], which is caused not only by OGD-induced loss in
energy supply but also by oxidative stress [39]. Mitochondria are
both targets and sources of oxidative stress [40]. ROS production
is involved in the pathogenesis of acute brain injury, and becomes
an important therapeutic target [41,42]. In this study, ABPPk
inhibited OGD-induced ROS production, suggesting that the
neuroprotective effect of ABPPk might be associated with
alleviation of intracellular ROS generation.
To summarize, ABPPk protected primary cortical neurons or
rat brain against OGD or MCAO-induced cell or tissue damage,
and ABPPk inhibition of neuronal apoptosis might be mediated by
mitochondrial-dependent pathways, including modulation of
apoptosis-related gene expression, regulation of mitochondrial
dysfunction through restoring mitochondrial membrane potential,
reducing release of mitochondrial apoptogenic factors, and
inhibiting intracellular ROS production. The neuroprotective
effect of ABPPk may suggest the possible use of ABPPk in the
treatment and prevention of cerebral ischemic insult.

Island, NY).

bovine serum (FBS), and plated onto poly-lysine coated plates at a
density of 1 or 26105 cells/cm2 to allow incubation at 37uC in a
humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 for 4 h. After cells
attached to the substrate, the culture medium was replaced with
neuronal culture medium (serum-free Neurobasal medium with
2% B27 supplement, 0.5 mM glutamine) for 5 d incubation, and
cytosine arabinoside (1 mM) was then added to prevent glial cell
proliferation. The cells were characterized by immunocytochemistry with anti-b-Tubulin III, indicating that primary culture
contained about 93% neurons.
Primary cortical neurons were subjected to OGD insult as
described previously [44,45]. In brief, the cells were transferred to
the glucose-free DMEM bubbled with 95% N2/5% CO2 in a
sealed humidified modular incubator chamber (MIC-101, BillupsRothenberg, Del Mar, CA) for 6 h incubation. For reperfusion,
the exposure medium was replaced with plain neuronal culture
medium, or with neuronal culture medium added with ABPPk
(0.04, 0.2, or 1.0 mg/ml) or nimodipine (10 mM), respectively, and
cell culture was placed in a normoxic incubator for another 24 h
incubation. At the end of cell treatments, cell culture was subjected
to various assessments. The cells cultured in plain DMEM and
then plain neuronal culture medium both with ambient oxygen for
6 and 24 h, respectively, served as control (no exposure to OGD).

HPLC separation of ABPP
The root of Achyranthes bidentata Blume was purchased from a
local Chinese medicine grocery and identified by Professor Haoru
Zhao from China Pharmaceutical University. ABPP was extracted
from Achyranthes bidentata Blume as previously described. For
preparation of ABPPk, HPLC was performed with a Waters
System (Waters, Milford, MA) consisting of Waters Alliance e2695
and Waters 2996 Photodiode Array Detector. A C18 reverse
phase-performance
liquid
chromatography
column
(4.6 mm6250 mm, 5 mm i.d. Waters, Milford, MA) was applied,
and a linear gradient elution was performed with 0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid in water/acetonitrile (water ratio, 80,47%
by volume) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. For characterization, the
eluted 12 fractions, referred to as ABPPa – ABPPl, were monitored
by UV spectrophotometry at 220 nm. They were centrifuged and
concentrated in a vacuum freeze drying machine to yield powders,
which could be easily dissolved in pure water, saline, or culture
medium at a desired concentration for use.

Cell viability assay
Cell culture and treatment

MTT assay was used to determine cell viability of primary
cortical neurons. The MTT solution was added to the cell sample
to make final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and the reaction
mixture was allowed to incubate at 37uC for 4 h before addition of
20% sodium dodecyl sulfide (SDS) to dissolve the resulting
formazan. The absorbance (OD) value was measured by
spectrophotometry at 570 nm with an EIX-800 Microelisa reader

Primary culture of cortical neurons was prepared from
embryonic day 18 (E 18) Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats as described
previously with minor modifications [43]. In brief, animals were
sacrificed by cervical dislocation under anesthesia, and the brain
was quickly removed. The cortex was dissected out on a cold stage
and treated with 0.25% trypsin at 37uC for 10 min. The cortex
cells were suspended in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal

a cryostat into coronal sections at a thickness of 20 mm. TUNEL
procedures were applied to frozen brain sections according to the
kit protocols. In brief, the sections were fixed in 4% methanol-free
formaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, and covered
with equilibration buffer. DNA strand breaks were labeled with
fluorescein-12-dUTP in an equilibration buffer added with
recombinant TdT, avoiding exposure to light. The negative
control was incubated with an incubation buffer without
recombinant TdT. The reaction was terminated with 26SSC
(300 mM sodium chloride and 30 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.4).
Afterwards, the sections were stained with 1 mg/ml propidium
iodide (PI) at room temperature in the dark. Apoptotic (TUNELpositive) cells were detected as localized bright green cells in a red
background under scanning laser confocal microscopy (Leica,
Heidelberg, Germany). Data are expressed as the ratio of
apoptotic cells to total cells.

(Bio-Tek Inc., USA). The cell viability was expressed as a
percentage of control value.

Animals and surgical procedures
Male SD rats, weighing 200610 g, were provided by the
Experimental Animal Center of Nantong University, Nantong,
China. All experimental procedures involving animals were
conducted as per institutional animal care guidelines of Nantong
University and were approved ethically by the Jiangsu administration committee for experimental animals, China.
Surgery was performed as described previously [4]. After
animals were anesthetized, a monofilament nylon suture with
PLL-coated distal end (Sunbio Biotech, Beijing, China) was
inserted into the internal carotid artery to cause transient MCAO.
At 2 h after MCAO, reperfusion was induced by filament
withdrawal, and at the start of reperfusion 1 ml of ABPPk (0.1,
0.2, or 1.0 mg/kg), nimodipine (1.0 mg/kg), or saline (vehicle) was
intravenously (iv) injected into the femoral vein of animals,
respectively (n = 24 per group). Sham-MCAO animals (n = 12)
were subjected to the same surgical procedure except that a
monofilament suture was not advanced beyond the internal
carotid bifurcation. During the whole surgical period, the body
temperature of animals was maintained at 36.5 6 0.5uC by the use
of a heating pad controlled by a rectal probe.

Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential
(nYm)
The fluorescent probe JC-1 was used to measure the nYm of
primary cortical neurons. For fluorescence images, culture slides
were incubated with 2 mM JC-1 at 37uC for 15 min. Slides were
washed and mounted, and fluorescence images were then acquired
in a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany)
For flow cytometry, primary cortical neurons (16106) were
collected by trypsinisation, washed in PBS and incubated with
2 mM JC-1 at 37uC for 15 min. Cells were washed, and analyzed
by flow cytometer (BD FACScalibur, BD Bioscience, San Jose,
CA). Photomultiplier settings were adjusted to detect JC-1
monomer fluorescence signals on the FL1 detector (green
fluorescence, centered at ,390 nm) and JC-1 aggregate fluorescence signals on the FL2 detector (red fluorescence, centered at
,340 nm). The intensity ratio of aggregate to monomer (red/
green) fluorescence was used for data presentation.

Neurological deficit evaluation
After 2 h of MCAO and 24 h of reperfusion, the modified
neurological severity scores (mNSS) were measured by an
investigator who was blinded for treatment assignment. The
mNSS consists of motor, sensory, reflex, and balance tests, and the
items are scored on an 18-point scale (normal score, 0; maximal
deficit score, 18). The higher is the score, the more severe is the
injury [46].
The brain infarct size was measured by riphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) staining as described previously with modifications
[47]. In brief, after 2 h of MCAO and 24 h of reperfusion, animals
were sacrificed under deep anesthesia, and the brain was quickly
dissected and cut into 2-mm-thick coronal sections using a rat
brain matrix (Sunny Instruments, Beijing, China). The slices were
immediately placed in PBS containing 0.5% TTC at 37uC for
20 min, and then fixed in buffered 4% formaldehyde solution for
1 h at room temperature, followed by image capture with a video
camera (Canon PowerShot S60; Canon, Tokyo, Japan), and
analysis of the infarct volumes by the Q550 IW image analysis
system (Leica Imaging System Ltd., Cambridge, UK). The infarct
volume was calculated as [(Vc2Vl)/Vc]6100%, where Vc is the
volume of control hemisphere and Vl is the volume of
noninfaracted tissue in the lesioned hemisphere.

Western blot analysis
The M-PER, T-PER, NE-PER and mitochondria isolation kit
were used for total protein extraction from primary cortical
neurons, brain samples, nucleoprotein, and mitochondrial protein.
The protein samples were subjected to protein quantification with
a Coomassie plus Bradford assay kit.
Identical amounts of protein samples (40 mg per sample) were
separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a PVDF membrane, and
incubated at 4uC overnight with anti-Bax (1:2000), anti-Bcl-2
(1:1000), anti-Bcl-xL (1:1000), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:1000),
anti-caspase-3 (1:500), anti-AIF (1:1000), anti-cytochrome C
(1:500), anti-Histone H1 (1:1000), anti-COX IV (1:1000), anti-bactin (1:2000), respectively. Then, IRDye 800-conjugated affinity
purified goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5000) or donkey anti-rabbit IgG
(1:5000) was applied at room temperature. The images were
scanned with Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR), and the
data were analyzed with PDQuest 7.2.0 software (Bio-Rad). The
data were expressed as the values relative to the control value.

Hoechst staining
Primary cortical neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at
room temperature for 20 min, and then stained with 5 mg/ml
Hoechst 33342 dye for 10 min, followed by observation under
DMR fluorescence microscopy (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar,
Germany) with fluorescence excitation at 340 nm and emission at
510 nm. The cells with fragmented or condensed DNA were
counted as apoptotic cells, and the ratio of apoptotic cells to total
cells was calculated.

Measurement of intracellular ROS
Intracellular accumulation of ROS was measured with DCFHDA as described previously [4,48,49] with minor modifications.
To test the effects of ABPPk on the OGD-induced generation of
ROS, cells were washed twice with Ca2+, Mg2+-free HBSS, then
incubated with 20 mM DCFH-DA in Ca2+, Mg2+-free HBSS for
30 min at 37uC in the dark and washed twice with Ca2+, Mg2+free HBSS. The change of ROS was estimated by the fluorescence
ratio of the dye-loaded neurons after OGD stimulation immedi-

TUNEL assay
Rats were transcardially perfused, and the brain was harvested.
The procured samples were post-fixed in buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated in a graded sucrose series, and then cut on

ately and 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 min during reperfusion period. The
dye-loaded cells were measured for fluorescence with a fluorescence microplate reader (Bio-Tek Inc., USA; excitation, 485 nm;
emission, 535 nm).
