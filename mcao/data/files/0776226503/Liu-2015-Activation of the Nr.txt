Oxidative stress is considered a major contributing factor in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Phloretin, a
dihydrochalcone belonging to the ﬂavonoid family, is particularly rich in apples and apple-derived products. A
large body of evidence demonstrates that phloretin exhibits anti-oxidant properties, and phloretin has potential
implications for treating oxidative stress injuries in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. Therefore, the neuroprotective
and antioxidant effects of phloretin against ischemia/reperfusion injury, as well as related probable mechanisms,
were investigated. The cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury model was reproduced in male Sprague–Dawley rats
through middle cerebral artery occlusion. At 24 h after reperfusion, neurological score, infarct volume, and brain
water content were assessed. Oxidative stress was evaluated by superoxide dismutases (SOD), glutathione
(GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Nrf2 expression was measured
by RT-PCR and western blot. Consequently, results showed that phloretin pretreatment for 14 days signiﬁcantly
reduced infarct volume and brain edema, and ameliorated neurological scores in focal cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion rats. SOD, GSH and GSH-Px activities were greatly decreased, and MDA levels signiﬁcantly increased
after ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, phloretin pretreatment dramatically suppressed these oxidative
stress processes. Furthermore, phloretin upregulated Nrf2 mRNA and protein expression of in ischemia/
reperfusion brain tissue. Taken together, phloretin exhibited neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion, and the mechanisms are associated with oxidative stress inhibition and Nrf2 defense pathway
activation.

1. Introduction
Stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident, is a medical emergency that can cause permanent neurological damage or death. Strokes
can be classiﬁed into ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes [1,2]. Ischemic
strokes are caused by the interruption of the blood supply, while hemorrhagic strokes result from the rupture of a blood vessel or an abnormal
vascular structure. Recent advances in medicine have led to the develop
of thrombolytic agents and intravascular techniques, which markedly
decrease functional deﬁcits [3,4]. However, restoration of blood supply
and reoxygenation after a period of ischemia or lack of oxygen are
frequently associated with an exacerbation of cerebral tissue damage
rather than a return to normal function [5,6]. Various mechanisms are
involved in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, such as energy

failure, elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels, release of excitatory neurotransmitters, production of oxygen-free radicals, inﬂammation, and
apoptosis [2,7]. Recent data support the idea that oxidative stress is
also a powerful mediators of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury [8,
9]. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other free
radicals during stroke is a consequence of excitotoxicity [10]. These
molecules are highly reactive and lead to cell death. Thus, effective prevention and control of oxidative stress in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
injury are of great clinical value.
A basic leucine zipper transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid
2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), is presently documented as the major cellular
defense mechanism under oxidative stress. When activated, Nrf2 specifically binds antioxidant response elements (AREs) and regulates expression of antioxidant proteins, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1),
superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione (GSH), and NADPH
quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1). Under inactivated conditions, Nrf2
interacts with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap l) to form
complexes that are constitutively degraded [11,12]. Recently, studies

Y. Liu et al. / Journal of the Neurological Sciences 351 (2015) 88–92

have provided evidence for the therapeutic potential of targeting the
Nrf2/ARE pathway in oxidative stress injuries after ischemic stroke
[13–15].
Phloretin is a dihydrochalcone that belongs to the ﬂavonoid family
of polyphenols, and presents at high levels in fruits, such as apples,
pears, and strawberries (Fig. 1A). It can exert wide biological and pharmacological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory, whitening, anti-cancer, immune suppression, prevention and treatment of
cardiovascular disease and other beneﬁcial effects to human health
[16–18]. However, little is known about the effects of phloretin on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. Hence, this study identiﬁed the potential
beneﬁts of phloretin pretreatment in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
rats. Furthermore, we investigated the roles of the Nrf2 defense pathway in oxidative stress injuries after ischemic/reperfusion.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Drugs and experimental animals
Phloretin (molecular weight = 274.27, purity N 98%, veriﬁed by
high-performance liquid chromatography; provided by Phytomarker,
China) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to make a
200 mM stock solution and stored at 4 °C for further use.
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (Grade II, No. 140211) of uniform age,
weighing 220 to 280 g, were obtained from the Experimental Animal
Center of Shandong University. All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The protocol was approved
by the Animal Ethics Committee of Shandong University.

2.2. Preparation of focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion model
Rats were randomly assigned to ﬁve experimental groups: shamsurgery group, I/R group, and high-, medium- and low-dose phloretin
groups (20, 40, and 80 mg·kg·day−1 respectively). The phloretin
groups were intraperitoneally administered with drugs for 14 days.
After 1 h of the last administration, the focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion rat model was induced using the method of intraluminal vascular
occlusion as previously reported with slight modiﬁcations [19]. In
brief, under chloral hydrate anesthesia, a 4-0 nylon monoﬁlament
with a rounded tip was inserted into the right common external carotid
artery, and advanced into the internal carotid until it blocked the origin
of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). After 2 h of occlusion, reperfusion
was achieved by a careful ﬁlament withdrawal to restore blood ﬂow.
The sham-surgery rats were subjected to the same surgical procedures,
except that the middle cerebral arteries were not occluded following
neck incision. The cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury model was developed with 2 h MCA occlusion followed by 24 h reperfusion. During
the entire surgical procedure, rectal temperature was monitored and
maintained at 37–38 °C with a heating pad. The room temperature
was controlled in the range of 25–27 °C.

2.4. Assessments of infarct volume
Brain infarction size was evaluated by the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining method [20]. Rats were sacriﬁced after neurological examination, and brains were carefully removed from the skull
and maintained at − 20 °C for 10 min. Then, the frozen brains were
sliced into consecutive 2 mm coronal sections and immersed in a 2%
TTC solution for 30 min at 37 °C. The infarct areas were photographed
using a high-resolution digital camera. Image analysis software (NIH
Image, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA, version 1.63)
was applied to measure the infarcted area.
2.5. Measurements of brain edema
To evaluate brain edema, brain water content was measured using
the standard wet–dry method. After 24 h reperfusion, the brains were
immediately removed. The two hemispheres were weighed
(wet weight) separately, then the tissue was dried at 100 °C for 24 h
to determine the dry weight. The degree of brain edema was calculated
using the following equation: water content = (wet weight − dry
weight) / wet weight × 100%.
2.6. Determination of SOD, GSH, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and
MDA levels
After reperfusion for 24 h, rats were executed and brain samples of
the ischemic hemisphere were collected from the cortex of the middle
cerebral artery (MCA) area on ice and stored at −80 °C for subsequent
analysis. The spectrophotometer method was applied to determine
SOD, GSH, GSH-Px and MDA levels according to the manufacturer's instructions (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing,
China), respectively. The protein concentrations were determined by
the Bradford method.
2.7. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Total RNA from ischemic penumbras of rat brain was extracted with
TRIzol reagent kit (Gibco-BRL, USA). The tissues were collected and
quickly frozen. Then the tissues were transferred into TRIzol in a
1.5 mL tube for 15 min. Chloroform was added into the tube, which
was shaken vigorously and then incubated for 10 min. The reaction
tube was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. The upper portion
was transferred into another tube. An equal volume of isopropyl alcohol
was added, shaken, and incubated for 10 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The RNA pellet was washed with
ice-cold 75% ethanol, and centrifuged at 7500 g for 5 min at 4 °C. The
RNA pellet was air-dried, and then dissolved into RNase-free dH2O.
RNA was stored at − 80 °C for further use. Total RNA was reversetranscribed with RevertAid™, First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Fermentas, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide
and observed under ultraviolet light. β-Actin served as an internal control, to the level of which the amount of target mRNA was normalized.
2.8. Western blot analysis

2.3. Evaluation of neurological deﬁcit
After 24 h of reperfusion, neurological deﬁcit was scored by an investigator blinded to the study protocol according to the 5-point scoring
system of Longa et al. [19]. The scoring system was used as follows:
(1) normal walk or no neurologic deﬁcit = 0; (2) failure to extend opposite forepaw fully or a mild focal neurologic deﬁcit = 1; (3) circling
to the contralateral side or a moderate focal neurologic deﬁcit = 2;
(4) falling to contralateral side or a severe focal neurologic deﬁcit = 3;
and (5) no spontaneous walking with depressed consciousness
level = 4.

Protein extraction for Nrf2 was performed using a nuclear extraction
kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ischemic regions of
cerebral cortices (n = 5 per group) were homogenized in an ice-cold
Radio-Immunoprecipitation Assay (RIPA) buffer. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations
in the resulting supernatants were determined using the Bio-Rad
assay kit. Equal amounts of protein (40 μg/lane) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
and blotted onto 0.22 μm polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). The membranes were blocked by TBST

nonfat dried milk. Membranes were further incubated sequentially
with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. After three
washes, the blots were subsequently incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 1 h, and then developed in electrochemiluminescence (ECL)

reperfusion group, indicating that phloretin ameliorated brain function
in a dose-dependent manner.
Infarct tissue was visualized as an unstained area in the ischemia/reperfusion group, whereas normal viable brain tissue was stained red. As
shown in Fig. 2, no infarction was observed in the sham group, while extensive lesions were visible in the I/R group. After phloretin treatment,
the 40 mg·kg−1 and 80 mg·kg−1 groups exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced
infarcted volume compared with the I/R group (P b 0.05). Similarly,
brain water content also signiﬁcantly decreased in the 40 mg·kg− 1
and 80 mg·kg−1 phloretin groups (P b 0.05).

2.9. Statistics

3.2. Phloretin inhibits oxidative stress in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion

Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation. The Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 13.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL,
USA) was used for statistical analyses including one-way ANOVA and
Student's t-test. A probability (P)-value b 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

To investigate the effects of phloretin on oxidative stress in cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion, we determined SOD, GSH, GSH-Px, and MDA
level using spectrophotometer method. As depicted in Fig. 3, the SOD,
GSH, and GSH-Px levels were signiﬁcantly lower in the I/R group than
the sham group. Compared with the I/R group, phloretin treatment
showed obvious signs of alleviating the decrease in oxidative stress mediators in a dose-dependent manner (P b 0.05). Cerebral I/R injury signiﬁcantly increased MDA levels in cortical areas of the brain in the I/R
group (P b 0.05). However, after phloretin pretreatment, MDA levels
signiﬁcantly decreased compared with the I/R group at 24 h after reperfusion (P b 0.05).

3. Results
3.1. Phloretin protects against cerebral ischemic injury in rats
Neurological deﬁcits were scored on a 5 point scale after 24 h of reperfusion following 2 h of MCA occlusion. The neurological deﬁcit scores
were signiﬁcantly increased in the ischemia/reperfusion group
compared with the sham-surgery group, suggesting that the cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion model was successfully constructed (Fig. 1B).
The neurologic scores of the groups treated with 40 mg·kg−1 and
80 mg·kg− 1 phloretin were signiﬁcantly lower than the ischemia/

3.3. Phloretin upregulated mRNA and protein expression of Nrf2 in cerebral

To further analyze phloretin-induced antioxidant effects, we also examined mRNA and protein levels of Nrf2 using RT-PCR or western blot.

Fig. 3. The effects of phloretin on SOD (A), GSH (B), GSH-Px (C), and MDA (D) in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rats. SOD, GSH, GSH-Px activities, and MDA levels of brain tissues were
detected using spectrophotometer method. Results are expressed as the mean ± SD. ΔP b 0.01, I/R vs. sham group, *P b 0.05, vs. I/R group, n = 8.

The results suggested that relative mRNA expression of Nrf2 was elevated in the I/R group. Treatments with phloretin signiﬁcantly increased
mRNA expression levels of Nrf2 in a dose-dependent manner
(P b 0.05). In accordance with RT-PCR results, western blot analysis
showed that Nrf2 protein expression was upregulated in the I/R
group, and signiﬁcantly increased after phloretin pretreatment, indicating that phloretin exhibited antioxidant effects that were cytoprotective
against ischemic/reperfusion brain injury (Fig. 4).
4. Discussion
It is well known that oxidative stress signiﬁcantly contributes to the
pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Therefore,
several neuroprotective strategies that target oxidative stress can greatly enhance therapeutic efﬁciency in stroke. It has been reported that intake of antioxidants, such as carotenoids or vitamin C, may protect
against atherosclerosis and thus prevent cerebrovascular disease [21].
As a promising antioxidant, phloretin has potential implications for
treating oxidative stress injuries. However, further studies are required
to reveal the neuroprotective mechanism of phloretin on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. In the present study, phloretin exhibited antioxidant properties and an upregulation of Nrf2, subsequently improving
brain function and reducing the injured area in cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion rats. These data suggest that phloretin could be beneﬁcial
for treating ischemic stroke associated with oxidative stress.
Experimental stroke studies have conﬁrmed that oxidative stress
plays an important role in cerebral damage following ischemia [22,23].
Oxidative stress reﬂects an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in favor of oxidants in living organisms [24]. An overproduction
of ROS or other free radicals promotes damage to lipids, carbohydrates,
proteins, and DNA, leading to cell death through multiple mechanisms,
such as respiratory inhibition, Ca2+ imbalance, excitotoxicity, reperfusion injury, and inﬂammation [25].

Cellular antioxidants are composed of oxidant scavengers and antioxidant enzymes that protect organisms from free radical attack, including SOD, GSH, and GSH-Px. They constitute an important antioxidant
defense mechanism in nearly all living cells exposed to ROS or other
free radicals. Their activity levels indirectly respond to the body's ability
to eliminate oxygen-free radicals [26]. MDA, a product of lipid peroxidation, is an oxidative stress marker. The degree of lipid peroxidation can
be estimated by the amount of MDA in tissues [27]. In our study, SOD,
GSH and GSH-Px activity levels signiﬁcantly decreased, whereas MDA
levels increased after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. These results suggest that oxidative stress takes place following focal cerebral ischemic
injury in rats. Phloretin pretreatment signiﬁcantly inhibits the increased
levels of MDA and promotes the production of cellular antioxidants. The
results indicated that phloretin exhibited a protective effect against lipid
peroxidation and attenuated neuronal oxidative stress.
As a pivotal regulator of the antioxidant response element (ARE),
Nrf2 has attracted great attention for preventing the development of oxidative stress by regulating Nrf2-related antioxidants. The upregulated
genes include ones that encode either antioxidant enzymes (SOD, catalase, GST-transferases), or enzymes involved in biosynthesis of antioxidants like gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase [28]. Growing evidence
has demonstrated the protective role of Nrf2-regulated gene products in
central nervous system diseases [29,30]. Results from the present study
have shown increased Nrf2 levels in cerebral I/R rat models, indicating
that the Nrf2/ARE signal pathway may play a vital role in stroke. After
phloretin pretreatment, Nrf2 expression signiﬁcantly increased, which
suggests that the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway was activated. Activation
of the Nrf2 defense pathway results in reduction of oxidative damage in
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.
In summary, our data indicate that phloretin produces neuroprotective effects via attenuated neuronal oxidative stress in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rats. The mechanisms underlying the protection
exhibited by phloretin involve activation of the Nrf2 defense pathway.

Fig. 4. The effects of phloretin on mRNA and protein expressions of Nrf2 in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rats. RNA and protein extracted from the ischemic cortex were analyzed
by RT-PCR or western blot. The mRNA and protein expression of Nrf2 was normalized to β-actin. Results are expressed as the mean ± SD. ΔP b 0.05, I/R vs. sham group, *P b 0.05,
vs. I/R group, n = 3.

These results suggest that phloretin might serve as a promising
therapeutic agent for the treatment of ischemic stroke. However,
additional studies are needed to determine the detailed molecular
targets mediating the neuroprotective action of phloretin.
