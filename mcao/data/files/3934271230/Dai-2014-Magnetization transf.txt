Abstract
Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) is an emerging MRI contrast mechanism that is capable of noninvasively
imaging dilute CEST agents and local properties such as pH and temperature, augmenting the routine MRI methods.
However, the routine CEST MRI includes a long RF saturation pulse followed by fast image readout, which is associated with
high specific absorption rate and limited spatial resolution. In addition, echo planar imaging (EPI)-based fast image readout
is prone to image distortion, particularly severe at high field. To address these limitations, we evaluated magnetization
transfer (MT) prepared gradient echo (GRE) MRI for CEST imaging. We proved the feasibility using numerical simulations and
experiments in vitro and in vivo. Then we optimized the sequence by serially evaluating the effects of the number of
saturation steps, MT saturation power (B1), GRE readout flip angle (FA), and repetition time (TR) upon the CEST MRI, and
further demonstrated the endogenous amide proton CEST imaging in rats brains (n = 5) that underwent permanent middle
cerebral artery occlusion. The CEST images can identify ischemic lesions in the first 3 hours after occlusion. In summary, our
study demonstrated that the readily available MT-prepared GRE MRI, if optimized, is CEST-sensitive and remains promising
for translational CEST imaging.

high field strength. In addition, CEST MRI using rapid
acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE), fast low angle
shot (FLASH) and steady-state free precession (FISP) readout have
been proposed [20,21,22,23]. Importantly, it often requires
extensive sequence development and experimental optimization
in order to address the stringent requirements of CEST MRI on
RF duty cycle, irradiation duration and specific absorption rate
(SAR).
Dixon et al. proposed interleaving short frequency-selective
saturation and spatially selective excitation pulses for CEST
imaging, and demonstrated that for short TR, CEST effect
approaches its steady state over the saturation time [24]. But only
paramagnetic CEST (PARACEST) agent was used to show the
CEST effect and no in-vivo data was reported yet. However, the
PARACEST is relatively straightforward for its negligence of RF
spillover effect, which needs to be revised in vivo. In addition,
because MT-prepared gradient echo (GRE) MRI is readily
available, our study evaluated the dependence of its CEST MRI
effect upon experimental parameters, including the number of
saturation steps (Steps), MT saturation power (B1), GRE readout
flip angle (FA) and repetition time (TR), for optimizing MTprepared CEST MRI both in vitro and in vivo.

Introduction
Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging is a
variant of magnetization transfer (MT) MRI contrast mechanism
that probes the chemical exchange between dilute labile protons
and bulk water [1]. Specifically, a frequency selective offresonance radio frequency (RF) irradiation pulse is applied to
preferentially saturate the exchangeable protons, and the bulk
water signal is attenuated due to its exchange with saturated labile
protons. Because CEST imaging is sensitive to dilute CEST
agents, local pH and temperature, it can be applied in many
different aspects [2]. Indeed, CEST MRI has been shown capable
of detecting a host of biomolecules including glutamate [3],
glycogen [4], glucose [5], glycosaminoglycan [6], esterase enzymes
[7] and gene expression [8] as well as pH and temperature
[9,10,11,12,13,14], complementing the conventional MRI.
For dilute CEST agents undergoing slow and intermediate
chemical exchange, the magnitude of CEST effect is typically a
few percent and therefore, it is important to improve its sensitivity
by optimizing the acquisition and post-processing strategies
[15,16,17,18,19]. The conventional CEST MRI sequence includes
a long irradiation pulse (e.g. continuous wave or RF pulse train)
followed by fast image acquisition such as echo planar imaging
(EPI), which is prone to image distortion, particularly severe at

We also translated the optimized sequence and preliminary
demonstrated endogenous amide proton transfer (APT) MRI
[9,25], a variant of CEST imaging, in permanent middle cerebral
artery occlusion rat brains. To summarize, our study confirmed
and optimized the readily available MT-prepared GRE MRI for
in vivo CEST imaging.

D. MRI Acquisitions
All MRI experiments were conducted using a horizontal bore
(bore size 160 mm) Agilent 7 T animal MRI scanner (Agilent,
VNMRS, USA) with a 63 mm internal diameter standard 1 H
volume coil (one-channel) for RF transmission and reception. Field
gradients: 400 mT/m in maximum 200A. The B0 field was
shimmed using 3D gradient shimming that adjust high-order
gradient shimming currents based on the derived B0 field map.
The RF field and center frequency were calibrated in pre-scan.
MT-prepared GRE MRI sequence was used for CEST imaging.
First, the CEST imaging and Z-spectra were demonstrated by
tissue-like phantoms and normal SD rat brain. Routine GRE MRI
parameters were set: TR/TE = 26/2.3 ms and FA = 20u, unless
specified otherwise. In addition, we had slice thickness = 2 mm,
field of view (FOV) = 34634 mm2, imaging matrix = 64664,
number of average (NA) = 1, dummy scan = 4, and bandwidth = 50 kHz. Total scan time was about 1.6 s for one slice.

Materials and Methods
A. Tissue-like CEST phantom
Tissue-like CEST phantoms were prepared for optimizing
CEST MRI [17]. Briefly, 1% agarose was added to phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) solution. The mixture was microwave
heated, and immersed in a water bath at 45uC. After the
temperature stabilized, the solution was transferred into centrifuge
tubes. Creatine was added to reach final concentrations of 50, 100
and 200 mM, and their pH was titrated to 7.0. Tubes were
inserted into a phantom holder filled with 1% agarose to minimize
the susceptibility mismatch. In addition, another phantom
containing 50 and 100 mM creatine in 1% agarose gel was
prepared for sequence optimization (i.e. Steps, B1, FA and TR).
Both phantoms were solidified under the room temperature prior
to MRI.

E. Phantom Optimization
CEST MRI was optimized as functions of the number of
saturation steps (Steps), saturation power (B1), GRE readout FA
and TR. Specifically, the Steps was varied from 32, 64, 128, 192,
256, and 512 to 1024 while the saturation power and duration
were set to 0.59 mT and 20 ms. In addition, the MT saturation
power was varied from 0.16 mT to 1.12 mT. Specifically, the MT
saturation pulse was chosen as a 20 ms width gauss pulse, with flip
angle varied from 50u to 350u with intervals of 50u, so their
corresponding powers are from 0.16 mT to 1.12 mT with intervals
of 0.16 mT (Steps = 256, FA = 15u and TR = 26 ms). Moreover,
FA was varied from 5u to 60u with intervals of 5u or 10u
(B1 = 0.59 mT, Steps = 256, and TR = 26 ms) and TR was varied
from 26 to 210 ms in five steps (B1 = 0.59 mT, Steps = 256 and
FA = 5u).

B. Animal Preparation
All experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics
Committee of Shantou University Medical College and all
experiments were performed in accordance with guidelines from
the Chinese Animal Welfare Agency. Five adult male Sprague
Dawley (SD) rats (weighted about 200 g) were underwent
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by thread
embolism. First, the rats were anesthetized with 3% pentobarbital,
intraperitoneal injection, and immobilized in a standard rat table.
Then, MCAO models were performed by inserting the 4-0 nylon
suture into the lumen of internal carotid artery to block the origin
of the middle cerebral artery. Animal core temperature, respiration and heart rates were monitored throughout the procedure.
Another normal adult male SD rat was used for multi-slice CEST
imaging. MCAO rats were euthanized with overdose of Phenobarbital by intravenous injection after Scanning. All efforts were
made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of
animals used.

F. In vivo Optimization and application
In order to be better applied in vivo, the same key parameters
(Steps, B1, FA and TR) were also evaluated in five adult male
MCAO SD rats in the first three hours after occlusion. The rat
brain was immobilized in a standard rat cradle. Images were
averaged 64 times to improve its signal to noise ratio caused by the
use of volume coil. First, the number of saturation steps was varied
from 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 to 2048 while the saturation power
and duration were set to 0.39 mT and 15 ms. In addition, the MT
saturation power (gauss pulse, 15 ms pulse width) was varied from
0.39 mT to 1.57 mT with intervals of 0.19 mT with Step = 4096,
TR = 21 ms, and FA = 5u. Moreover, FA was varied from 5u to
20u with intervals of 5u (B1 = 0.39 mT, Step = 4096 and
TR = 21 ms) and TR was varied from 21, 30 to 40 ms
(B1 = 0.39 mT, Step = 4096 and FA = 5u). Regions of interest
(ROI) were manually drawn on the ischemic lesions and
contralateral normal regions by three expert radiologists.
Optimized data were obtained in five MCAO SD rats brains
based on the optimized parameters (saturation step = 4096,
B1 = 0.39 mT, FA = 5u, TR = 21 ms). Total scan time was about
1.4 minutes for one image. Other routine MRI sequences: T2weighted imaging (TR/TE = 2000/30 ms, NA = 8) and ADC
maps (TR/TE = 2000/34 ms, NA = 8) with b-value of 1000 s/
mm2 were acquired for reference.

C. Simulation of MT-prepared GRE CEST MRI
The time-dependent CEST effect for the proposed MTprepared GRE CEST MRI sequence was analyzed by numerical
simulation in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick MA). Specifically, we
used Bloch-McConnell equations to simulate the two-pool proton
exchange model. [26] We assumed representative relaxation
parameters, with T1w = 1500 ms and T2w = 45 ms for bulk
water, and T1s = 1000 ms and T2s = 15 ms for labile proton. A
chemical offset of 1050 Hz was chosen for simulation as it
represents the frequency offset of ensemble amide proton from
endogenous proteins and peptides, observed at 7 T. We examined
two exchange rates of 30 Hz and 500 Hz respectively, with the
same concentrations and RF irradiation power of 1:500 and
0.75 mT. We had TR = Tr+Ts+Ti and saturation time = n*TR.
Where Tr is the relaxation delay time, Ts is the saturation time, Ti
is the image acquisition time and n is the steps of TR. We had
Tr = 10 ms, Ts = 10 ms, Ti = 1 ms. In comparison, we simulated
the conventional continuous wave pre-saturation with EPI
acquisition sequence, with the same physicochemical parameters.

CEST effect was 7.363.4%, 16.763.2%, and 28.463.2% for 50,
100 and 200 mM creatine-gel compartment, respectively.
Fig. 3 shows the phantom optimizations. We evaluate the
CEST effect as functions of Steps, B1, FA and TR in phantoms.
Specifically, CEST effect approached its steady state exponentially
with Steps (Fig. 3A), indicating that CEST effect accumulated as a
function of saturation step duration, that was consistent with the
simulation result. Fig. 3B shows CEST effects as a function of MT
saturation power increasing with B1 up to a peak at about 0.65–
0.98 mT. Fig. 3C–D evaluates FA and TR dependence of CEST
imaging. CEST effect decreased monotonically with FA (Fig. 3C).
In addition, CEST effect decreased with TR (Fig. 3D), suggesting
less effective accumulation of CEST effect at long TR due to
competitive T1 relaxation. The data suggest that for the MTprepared GRE CEST sequence, it is necessary to use small FA and
short TR in order to measure CEST effect with adequate
sensitivity. We propose using 5u and minimum TR at 7 T.
Fig. 4 shows the in vivo optimizations in MCAO SD rat brain
in the first three hours after occlusion. The same four key
parameters, including Seps, B1, FA and TR were evaluated.
Unlike the results of the phantom experiments, The CEST effects
in vivo were negative owning to interference with nuclear
overhauser effects (NOE). We could not distinguish them in the
CEST imaging with the existing technology, so we used the
MTRasym contrast between ischemic lesion and normal region as
the assessment index for optimization. Specifically, Fig. 4A
indicates that CEST effect approached its steady state exponentially with Steps in both normal and ischemic regions. Fig. 4B

phantom compartment. The scatters were drawn with mean
signals as ordinate and RF offset as abscissas, smoothed using a
spline function [27]. CEST images were calculated using the
conventional MTR asymmetry analysis of three images: label
(Ilabel) and reference (Iref) images with RF saturation applied at the
labile proton frequency (1.87 and 3.5 ppm for creatine and in vivo
CEST MRI, respectively) and reference frequency (21.87 and 2
3.5 ppm, respectively), in addition to a control scan without RF
irradiation (I0). The MTRasym was calculated as [9]: MTRasym = (Iref2Ilabel)/I0. Assessment of the contrast between the
ischemic lesion and the contralateral normal region were
performed via paired t-test. Values were presented as mean6SD,
and p,0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

Results
Fig. 1 shows the CEST effect as a function of RF saturation
time for representative exchange rates and sequences. Specifically,
for short TR, the CEST effect increases during the MT duration.
Although it may decrease slightly while the MT pulse is off, the
CEST effect accumulates and approaches its steady state, similar
to that obtainable using the conventional continuous wave
saturation pulse sequence.
Fig. 2 (A) shows Z-spectra from compartments of varied
creatine concentration of the tissue-like CEST phantom. CESTinduced MRI effect can be observed at the labile amine proton
chemical shift of 1.87 ppm. Fig. 2 (B) shows the CEST-weighted
image of the triple-compartment CEST phantom, where the

shows CEST effect as functions of B1. The CEST effect increased
with B1, whereas the contrasts between the normal and ischemic
regions were getting smaller. The contrasts peaked at about
0.39,0.78 mT and disappeared at 1.57 mT. Fig. 4C–D evaluates
FA and TR dependence of CEST imaging. The contrasts between
the normal and ischemic regions were decreased both with FA

(Fig. 4C) and TR (Fig. 4D). The data also suggest that for the MTprepared GRE CEST sequence, the optimized parameters in vivo
for MCAO are as following: Steps $2000, B1 = 0.39,0.78 mT,
FA = 5u, TR = 21 ms.

sequence, and compare them with other routine imaging. The
ischemic region was not seen in the normal T2-weighted images in
the first 3 hours after occlusion. However, it could be identified in
CEST images and ADC images. The CEST effect calculated from
the asymmetry analysis was 29.6%60.9% and 27.0%60.8% for
the ischemic and the contralateral normal region (p,0.05), which
was verified by the Z-spectra (lower left corner). Amide proton
shows a relatively clear CEST effect at about 3.5 ppm in Zspectra. Moreover, the CEST effect was reduced due to the
decrease of pH in the ischemic lesion, which was the mechanism of
the contrast between the ischemic and normal region. Note that
because of the interference of the NOE, there was a signal
decrease on the negative axis, whereas the NOE was almost
identical between the ischemic and normal region.

field strength. Moreover, the interleaved MT saturation and GRE
readout spread the RF energy deposition throughout the scan
when compared to the conventional CEST imaging with fast
image readout, which is significant in clinical application because
SAR is strictly restricted. In addition, it will be very useful for
Metabolite CEST like glutamate, glycosaminoglycan etc., which
requires high saturation B1 that SAR can be an issue.
Furthermore, because the proposed CEST imaging scheme
requires little hardware modification and sequence development,
it can be implemented on routine scanners and remains promising
for clinical translation [28,29].
Our study showed that CEST effects strongly depend on TR
and FA both in vitro and in vivo. Short TR reduces T1relaxation induced loss of CEST effect for more efficient
cumulative effect toward the steady state CEST MRI [30].
Because CEST effect decreases with FA, the appropriate FA
appears to be 5u at 7 Tesla. In addition, we observed strong
dependence of CEST effects on MT saturation power. In creatineagarose CEST phantoms, in which the protons chemical exchange
rate is about 500 Hz at pH 7, the CEST effect increases with
saturation power and peaked about 0.65–0.98 mT, similar to that
found with pulsed-CEST imaging [16,31]. In vivo, the amide
protons chemical exchange rate is about 30 Hz, and we found that
the saturation power may range from 0.39 mT to 0.78 mT for
optimal contrast between the normal and ischemic regions. In
addition, the B1 sensitivity for CEST imaging is relatively small
around the optimal RF amplitude [10], consistent with the study

Discussion
Our study found that although each brief MT pulse generates a
small increase of CEST effect, it cumulates effectively for short TR
over the number of saturation steps, consistent with the conclusion
of Dixon et al. [24] In addition, we assessed the CEST effect for a
number of experimental parameters that should help guide the
experimental optimization of CEST imaging. Because the center
of the k-space determines the image intensity and signal to noise
ratio (SNR), initial high k-space data could be acquired during the
transient period to improve the acquisition efficiency. Besides,
because GRE-based image readout at short echo time is little
susceptible to image distortion, it is suitable for applications at high

sequence, and compares them with other routine images. The CEST effect was verified by the Z-spectra (lower left corner). The CEST effect
was reduced due to the decrease of pH in the ischemic lesion, whereas the NOE was almost the same as in the normal region.

of Jokivarsi et al. [32] Moreover, the spatial resolution and
sensitivity were sufficient so that the apparent CEST contrast
between the ischemic region and normal region could be well
delineated.
It is important to note that throughout all the experiments we
used a standard one channel volume coil, which allowed us to have
better B0 homogeneity than that in smaller coil. The full width at
half maximum were about 15 in phantoms and 30 in rat brains.
Moreover, although the direct saturation effect makes CEST
imaging very sensitive to B0 inhomogeneity, it can be neglected in
the APT imaging due to the small saturation B1. However, for
large saturation B1, it is necessary to have B0 correction. More
importantly, the signal to noise ratio can be improved significantly
if the coil is upgraded, and the CEST effects can be easier to be
observed. In summary, our study demonstrated that optimized
MT-prepared GRE MRI is suitable for in vivo CEST imaging.

MT saturation power, GRE readout FA and TR in tissue-like
phantoms. We have also demonstrated the endogenous amide
proton CEST MRI both in healthy and in MACO SD rat brains
on a 7 T scanner. In conclusion, this method can provide an
alternative, straightforward, and effective way to obtain CEST
images on clinic MR scanners without hardware or software
modifications.
