Abstract We have previously reported that angiotensin type
1 receptor (AT1R) blockade with candesartan exerts
neurovascular protection after experimental cerebral ischemia.
Here, we tested the hypothesis that a low, subhypotensive
dose of candesartan enhances neuroplasticity and subsequent
functional recovery through enhanced neurotrophic factor
expression in rats subjected to ischemia reperfusion injury.
Male Wistar rats (290–300 g) underwent 90 min of middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and received candesartan
(0.3 mg/kg) or saline at reperfusion and then once every 24 h
for 7 days. Functional deficits were assessed in a blinded

manner at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after MCAO. Animals were
sacrificed 14-day post-stroke and the brains perfused for infarct size by cresyl violet. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to assess the expression of growth factors
and synaptic proteins. Candesartan-treated animals showed a
significant reduction in the infarct size [t (13)=−5.5, P=
0.0001] accompanied by functional recovery in Bederson [F
(1, 13)=7.9, P=0.015], beam walk [F (1, 13)=6.7, P=0.023],
grip strength [F (1, 13)=15.2, P=0.0031], and rotarod performance [F (1, 14)=29.8, P<0.0001]. In addition, candesartantreated animals showed significantly higher expression of
active metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), laminin, and
angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1). The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) and its receptor was significantly increased in
the animals treated with candesartan. Also, we observed significant increases in neuroplasticity markers, synaptophysin,
and PSD-95. These results indicate that low-dose candesartan
had a large and enduring effect on measures of plasticity, and
this accompanied the functional recovery after ischemic
stroke.

candesartan did not act as an acute neurovascular protectant
in our model, repeated administration increased the production of neurotrophic factors, which we believe increased vascular remodeling, neuroplasticity, and subsequent functional
recovery after stroke.

Materials and Methods
Introduction
Animals and Treatment Regimen
Ischemic stroke is one of the most common causes of death
and disability in the USA. Although much progress has been
made toward understanding the mechanistic basis of stroke,
the effectiveness of drugs available for stroke patients is
limited. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the only FDAapproved treatment for stroke, has various limitations due to
neurovascular toxicity [1, 2]. Thus, finding an effective therapeutic strategy for stroke remains a high priority.
In stroke patients, acutely elevated blood pressure (BP) is
associated with unfavorable stroke outcomes [3], but lowering
BP acutely is not recommended, due to the potential to worsen
stroke injury [4]. In fact, both the Scandinavian Candesartan
Acute Stroke Trial (SCAST) and the China Antihypertensive
Trial in Acute Stroke (CATIS) demonstrated no benefit of BP
lowering in the acute stroke period [5, 6]. There is preclinical
evidence, however, that supports a neurovascular benefit of
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) beyond lowering BP [7,
8], compared with other BP lowering agents [9]. It remains
possible that low doses of the ARB, candesartan, may have
beneficial effects on long-term recovery after ischemic stroke.
Recent studies showed that activation of endogenous restorative mechanisms, rather than just simply reducing the
area of infarction, may provide better functional recovery after
stroke [10–12]. Several growth factors, including the two
most important neurotrophic factors, vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF), have pleiotropic effects on brain function, including
neuroprotection, vascular remodeling, neurogenesis, neuronal
survival, and neuroplasticity [13, 14]. VEGF has been shown
to stimulate angiogenesis, and this can be beneficial after
ischemic stroke [13]. Additionally, BDNF regulates neuronal
survival, cell migration, and synaptic function [15, 16]. VEGF
and BDNF levels have both been shown to increase in ischemic brain after treatment with candesartan and other
neurorestorative drugs [17–19, 10, 20]. Molecular mediators
underlying the effect of candesartan on the induction of
neuroplasticity and subsequent improvement of functional
outcome after treatment of stroke have not been adequately
determined.
In this study, we examined the effects of low-dose
candesartan treatment on neurotrophic factors, neuronal plasticity, and functional outcome in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Although this low dose of

Male Wistar rats (290–300 g; Charles River Laboratories,
Wilmington, MA) were used according to procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) of the Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center. The
rats were quarantined for at least 5 days before the experiment.
The animals were housed in individual cages in a room
maintained at 21–25 °C, 45–50 % humidity, and 12-h light/
dark cycle with free access to pellet chow and water.
The animals were separated into three groups: group I,
sham-operated saline-treated control (S); group II, MCAO
and saline-treated stroke (MCAO); and group III, MCAO
and candesartan (0.3 mg/kg) (MCAO + cand). Consistent with
previous research, candesartan (Astra-Zeneca) was dissolved
in saline and given in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg by intravenous
injection 90-min postocclusion to ensure rapid delivery following injury. Additional injections of 0.3 mg/kg were administered intraperitoneally every 24 h continuing daily for up to
7 days after MCAO. In this 14-day survival study, we used 90min MCAO to reduce the mortality. A diagram of the experimental design is shown in Fig. 1. A total of 38 rats were used
in the present study; one rat each in the saline and candesartan
groups died at 24 h and 3-day post-MCAO, respectively.
Candesartan Administration and BP Monitoring
Consistent with our previous published studies on 1-mg/kg
dose of candesartan on acute BP after 3-h MCAO and 24-h
survival [9, 21], here in this separate set of experiment, we
wanted to demonstrate the subhypotensive effect of low-dose
candesartan (0.3 mg/kg) under the same conditions, and rats
were sacrificed at 24 h. To examine the effect of 0.3 mg/kg
candesartan on acute BP, we monitored and recorded mean
arterial blood pressure (MABP) every 10 min using telemetry
transmitters (Data Sciences, Inc.) for the 24 h after the onset of
stroke. After 3 h of occlusion, the animals received either
candesartan (Astra-Zeneca) of 0.3 mg/kg or an equal volume
of saline (1 ml/kg) intravenously. Animals were sacrificed at
24 h after stroke (detailed experimental design in Supplement
Fig. 1). In all animals, baseline MAP was between 95 and
97 mmHg and was elevated by 30–35 mmHg upon MCAO.
When compared to our previous data in the dose of 1 mg/kg
candesartan, acute low-dose candesartan (0.3 mg/kg) did not

lower BP within a few hours of administration (Supplement
Fig. 2). In fact, we observed a mild effect on early (24 h) BP
after candesartan treatment at 3-h post-MCAO, a critical time
point, after which the BP starts to decline in MCAO. Mild BP
lowering after a single candesartan dose was found to have no
protective effect on early stroke outcomes. Therefore, we used
0.3-mg/kg dose of candesartan for 7 consecutive days to
determine the effects on neuroplasticity and long-term functional recovery after MCAO.

Sweden) for repeated time interval during 90 min of occlusion. The animals were anesthetized and placed on a stereotaxic frame, and the skull was exposed. A whole brain scan
was performed using the PIM3 to measure blood flow in both
hemispheres. A built-in photo detector assisted with LDPI win
software (PerimedInc) detected the reflected light from moving blood cells within 0.5 cm below of the cortical surface.
Color-coded images were acquired three times consecutively,
and the average blood flow was calculated based on the
concentration and mean velocity of the blood cells using the
LDPI win software. On induction of ischemia, cerebral blood
flow decreased to 30 to 35 %, remaining stable throughout the
90 min of MCA occlusion. Reperfusion was associated with a
restoration of blood flow to 80–90 % of baseline values in
saline-treated control animals (Fig. 2b).

Transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Prior to MCAO surgery, isoflurane anesthesia was induced at
5 % and then maintained at 1.5–2 % during surgery. Focal
cerebral ischemia was induced by occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery as previously described [22]. A midline
incision was made on the ventral surface of the neck, and the
right common carotid arteries were isolated and ligated with
6.0 silk suture. The internal carotid artery and the
pterygopalatine artery were temporarily occluded with a microvascular clip. A 4-0 Doccol filament (Doccol Corporation,
Redlands, CA) was introduced into the internal carotid artery
through the incision in the external carotid artery. The filament
was advanced approximately 20 mm distal to the carotid
bifurcation. The animals were kept under anesthesia for only
15 min for the surgical procedure. Temperature was maintained at 36.5–37.5 °C all the time using a controlled heating
system. After 90 min of MCAO, the occluding filament was
withdrawn back into the common carotid artery to allow for
reperfusion. The rats were allowed to recover from anesthesia
on the heating pad and then returned to their home cages after
full recovery from anesthesia. Sham-operated rats were subjected only to exposure of the MCA without occlusion. Anesthesia duration was similar in all groups.
Cerebral Blood Flow Imaging Using Laser Doppler Imaging
System
To ensure relative uniformity of the ischemic insult, in a
separate subset of animals (N=5), cerebral blood flow was
monitored using the Periscan PIM 3 System (Stockholm,

Assessment of Functional Outcome
The experiment was performed between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00
p.m. All animals underwent neurobehavioral testing before
MCAO and at days 1, 3, 7, and 14 after MCAO. Tests that
were used included Bederson score, beam walk, grip strength,
and rotarod performed in a blinded fashion.
Bederson Score Neurological function was measured using
the Bederson score [21]. An animal with no apparent deficits
obtained a 0; the presence of forelimb flexion, 1; decreased
resistance to push, 2; and circling, 3. A score of 3 is consistent
with eMCAO. Only animals with a score of 3 at the time of
reperfusion were included in the analysis of infarct size,
hemoglobin, and neurological function.
Beam Walk Beam walk in rats was determined as previously
described [23]. Animals were placed on a beam (60 cm long
and 4.5 cm wide) for 1 min and given a score from 0 to 6 as
follows: balances on the beam with a steady posture=0, grasps
side of the beam=1, hugs the beam with 1 limb falling=2,
hugs the beam with 2 limbs falling=3, falls off the beam
within 40–60 s=4, falls off the beam within 20–40 s=5; and
falls off the beam within 20 s=6.

Grip Strength Forelimb grip strength in rats was determined
using a grip strength meter (Columbus Instruments, OH,
USA) as previously described [24]. We used an electronic
digital force gauge that measured the peak force exerted by
the action of the animal while gripping the sensor bar. While
being drawn back along a straight line leading away from the
sensor, the animal released its grip at some point, and the
gauge then recorded the maximum force attained at the time
of release. The digital reading (in Newtons) of three successive trials was obtained for each rat, averaged, and used for
data analysis. The MCAO rats were tested simultaneously
with the shams.

were then averaged and used for data analysis. Rats not falling
off within 5 min were given a maximum score of 300 s.

Rotarod Motor impairment was assessed using an accelerating rotarod (Columbus Instruments Rotamex 4/8 system, OH,
USA). Rotameric tests were performed according to our previous published study [24]. All rats were given three training
sessions, 10 min apart, before surgery to establish baseline
performance. Rats were first habituated to the stationary rod,
and then exposed to the rotating rod. The rod was started at
4 rpm and accelerated linearly to 40 rpm within 300 s. Latency
to fall off the rotarod was then determined before ischemia
(presurgery) and at days 1, 3, 7, and 14 after surgery in all rats.
The rats were required to stay on the accelerating rod up to a
minimum of 30 s. If they were unable to reach this criterion,
the trial was repeated for a maximum of five times. The two
best (long duration) fall latency values achieved by each rat

Histologic and Immunohistochemical Assessment
Cerebral infarct size was evaluated according to previously
applied methods [25]. After completing the behavior tests, rats
were given an overdose of ketamine/xylazine and then
transcardially perfused with cold saline followed by 10 %
buffer-formalin via the ascending aorta. The brains were removed and postfixed in 10 % buffer-formalin (Fischer Scientific) for 48 h and then stored at 4 °C in a solution of 30 %
sucrose–saline for 2 days. The brains were embedded in OCT
and sectioned coronally in 12-μm-thick slices starting from
the frontal pole at an interval of 2 mm. The sections were
stained with 1 % cresyl violet (Nissl staining). The infarct
areas, defined as areas showing reduced Nissl staining under
light microscopy, were traced and quantified with an image
analysis system. Infarct volumes are expressed as a percentage
of the contralateral side ± SEM.
Immunofluorescence was performed to identify the distribution and cell types. Colocalization of VEGF and TrkB with
the different cellular markers [endothelial (CD31, 1:100; BD
Pharmingen, San Jose, CA), astrocytes (GFAP, 1:200; Sigma,
St. Louis, MO), and neurons (NeuN, 1:100; Millipore, Billerica, MA)] was processed simultaneously in 10-μm-thick sections from different animals as described previously [26].

Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C at the
following dilutions: rabbit anti-laminin (1:50; Dako
Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA), rabbit anti-VEGF (1:100;
Calbiochem Gibbstown, NJ), and rabbit anti-TrkB (1:100;
Santa Cruz biotech, Santa Cruz, CA). After washing, slides
were incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies and
cover slipped with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector
Laboratories). Negative controls were prepared by omitting
the primary antibodies. The number of laminin-stained vessels
was counted using ImageJ software (NIH) in five different
fields per section digitized from the ischemic border zone
using a ×20 objective lens (Axio Observer fluorescent microscope, Zeiss). To examine the effect of candesartan on
synaptophysin and PSD-95, after washing with PBS, 12-μm
coronal sections were incubated with 1 % BSA containing
0.3 % Triton-X 100 for blocking for 1 h at room temperature
and incubated with mouse anti-synaptophysin (1:200; Abcam,
Cambridge, MA) and PSD-95 (1:200; Abcam, Cambridge,
MA) at 4 °C overnight. After washing, slides were incubated
with fluorescent secondary antibodies, cover slipped with
Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). All the
sections were viewed using Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 fluorescent microscope.
Western Blot
For WB analysis, we used peri-infarct (penumbra) cortical
regions. By using a brain matrix, the brains were rapidly
dissected into 4.0-mm coronal sections (approximately 0.5
and −3.5 mm from bregma). Brain tissue was homogenized
in lysis buffer (RIPA); after centrifugation, protein concentration was determined. Fifty micrograms of the protein was
subjected to electrophoresis in 4–20 % SDS-PAGE gels
(BioRad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were then blocked at room temperature for 1 h in 5 %
bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated with anti-VEGF
(1:2,000; Calbiochem Gibbstown, NJ), BDNF (1:1,000; Santa
Cruz biotech, Santa Cruz, CA), TrkB (1:500, Santa Cruz
biotech, Santa Cruz, CA), MMP-3 (1:2,000; Abcam Cambridge, MA), angiopoietin-1 [Ang-1 (1:500; Santa Cruz biotech, Santa Cruz, CA)], synaptophysin (1:2,000; Abcam,
Cambridge, MA), and density protein-95 [PSD-95 (1:2,000;
Abcam, Cambridge, MA)]. All blots were stripped and
reincubated with loading control antibodies. Intensity of the
bands was measured by densitometry and quantified using
ImageJ analysis software (ImageJ, NIH).
Statistical Analysis
All results were expressed as mean ± SEM, and calculations
were obtained using GraphPad Prism and SAS® 9.3 (SAS
Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Infarct size and laminin density
were analyzed using the Student’s t test (MCAO vs MCAO

+ cand). Data obtained from Western blot were log transformed prior to analysis by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with three groups (Sham, MCAO, and MCAO +
cand), and contrasts were obtained for planned comparisons
(Sham vs MCAO and MCAO vs MCAO + cand). Bederson
score, beam walk, grip strength, and rotarod performance
were analyzed using multivariate repeated measure analysis
of variance (RMANOVA) to assess group (MCAO or MCAO
+ cand) and day (1, 3, 7, and 14) effects along with the
interaction between group and day. These tests were followed
by a Bonferroni correction for the within-day pairwise comparisons of interest. Percent difference between presurgical
and postsurgical scores for each animal was used to control for
individual differences in grip strength and rotarod performance. Statistical significance was determined at alpha=0.05.

Results
Low-Dose Candesartan Reduces Infarct Size and Promotes
Functional Recovery After MCAO
The infarct size of saline-treated and candesartan-treated animals 14 days after MCAO are presented as a percent of the
contralateral hemisphere in Fig. 2d. Low-dose candesartan
significantly [t (13)=−5.5, P=0.0001] reduced infarct size
by 61 % compared to saline-treated animals.
To examine whether the low-dose candesartan attenuates
neurological deficits, we used Bederson score and beam walk
tests at 24 h and days 3, 7, and 14 after MCAO (Fig. 3a, b). All
rats improved over time in both Bederson [(F (3, 11)=5.8, P=
0.013)] and beam walk score (F (3, 11)=7.3, P=0.0059). Rats
treated with candesartan showed significant improvement in
both Bederson [F (1, 13)=7.9, P=0.015] and beam walk
scores [F (1, 13)=6.7, P=0.023] after MCAO compared with
saline-treated animals.
We also examined the effect of candesartan on grip
strength, using grip strength meter. The maximum digital
reading (in Newtons) of three successive trials obtained for
each animal was used as the dependent variable. Grip strength
following MCAO in Fig. 3c is presented as percentage of
baseline. All rats improved over time [F (3, 10)=7.1, P=
0.0024]. Animals treated with candesartan showed significant
improvement in the grip strength when compared with the
saline group [F (1, 13)=15.2, P=0.0031].
Time spent on the rotarod is expressed as a percentage of
presurgery control value. As with the other measures of behavior, all rats improved with time [F (3, 12)=12.1, P=
0.0006]. Repeated treatments with candesartan resulted in
significant improvement compared with the saline group
across time on latency to remain on the rotarod [F (1, 14)=
29.8, P<0.0001].

Low-Dose Candesartan Preserves Neurovasculature After
MCAO
We considered the potential role of MMP-3 after ischemic
injury, since MMP-3 is associated with neuronal migration
and neurite outgrowth and contributes to neuroplasticity in the
late phase of stroke [27, 28]. To examine the influence of
candesartan on active MMP-3, Western blot analysis was done
14 days after MCAO and showed a significant [F (2, 13)=
13.5, P=0.0011] group difference in active MMP-3 (Fig. 4a).
The saline-treated MCAO group showed significantly decreased active MMP-3 compared to shams while candesartan
administration significantly upregulated MMP-3 compared to
the saline MCAO.
Importantly, MMP-3 levels correlated with increased expression of its target extracellular matrix substrates, molecules
necessary to prepare the local environment for reactive synaptogenesis [29, 30]. Our previous work using a hypotensive
dosage 1-mg/kg candesartan treatment demonstrated significant upregulation of laminin staining, a marker of components
of the extracellular matrix at 7 days after MCAO [21]. Here,
we examine the effect of low-dose candesartan on laminin
density after 14 days of MCAO. Immunoflourescent staining
of brain sections showed significantly higher vascular density
in the ischemic border zone with candesartan treatment [t (8)=
4.15, P=0.0032] compared to saline treatment for number of
vessels per field (Fig. 4b).
We further investigated the effect of candesartan treatment
on angiopoietin 1 (Ang-1) expression after stroke. Ang-1

exerts a barrier protective function as well as a synergistic
angiogenic effect after stroke and contributes to nascent vessel
maturation [31]. There was a significant effect of group [F (2,
13)=27.5, P<0.0001] where Ang-1 expression in the salinetreated MCAO group was significantly higher than the shams
and candesartan treatment significantly increased the Ang-1
compared to the saline-treated MCAO group (Fig. 4c).
Low-Dose Candesartan Enhances Endogenous Mediators
of Neuroplasticity After MCAO
VEGF and BDNF are two important endogenous factors for
vascular remodeling and neuroplasticity. Our previous work
demonstrated a robust increase in VEGF and BDNF in the
ischemic hemisphere at 24 h after MCAO, in animals treated
with candesartan at a dose of 1 mg/kg IV administered at
reperfusion [18, 17]. To determine the influence of low-dose
candesartan (0.3 mg/kg) on VEGF and BDNF expression,
Western blot analysis was done 14 days after MCAO. There
were significant group differences for VEGF [F (2, 13)=7.4,
P=0.0094], ProBDNF [F (2, 13)=16.9, P=0.0004], mature
BDNF [F (2, 13)=15.6], and TrkB [F (2, 13)=23.7, P=
0.0001]. We found a significant increase in VEGF (Fig. 5a),
ProBDNF, and mature BDNF (mBDNF) and its receptor,
TrkB (Fig. 5c), in the ischemic border zone (penumbra) of
animals treated with the low-dose candesartan compared to
the saline-treated MCAO group.
In order to characterize the role of the different brain cells
in VEGF expression, immunohistofluorescence for VEGF

coupled to NeuN (neurons) and GFAP (astrocytes) was performed at 14-day post-MCAO. Following MCAO, repeated
treatments with candesartan increased the immunopositive
signals of VEGF compared to the saline-treated MCAO group
(Fig. 5b). The immunohistochemical expression of VEGF
colocalized with the astrocyte marker, GFAP, in the periinfarct area of brain sections was markedly increased at
14 days following MCAO in the candesartan-treated compared to the saline-treated group. We further explored the
colocalization of TrkB using markers for neurons, astrocytes,
and endothelial cells. TrkB showed strong colocalization with
the neuronal marker, NeuN, in the ischemic penumbra. Compared to saline-treated animals, brain sections derived from
candesartan-treated animals exhibited significantly increased
TrkB expression (Fig. 5d).
To confirm that the observed molecular mediators promoted neuroplasticity, we also examined the expression of
synaptophysin and PSD-95, a key scaffolding protein implicated in excitatory synaptic signaling. There was a significant

group effect for both synaptophysin [F (2, 13)=15.7, P=
0.0006] and PSD-95 [F (2, 13) = 35.3, P < 0.0001].
Synaptophysin expression was increased while PSD-95 was
reduced significantly in the saline-treated MCAO group compared to shams. Candesartan administration significantly upregulated the expression of both proteins compared to the
saline-treated MCAO group (Fig. 6a, b). These findings were
further confirmed by immunohistochemistry, with increased
expression of synaptophysin and PSD-95 in the candesartantreated group (Fig. 6c).

Discussion
Our study demonstrated that a low-dose candesartan enhances
neuroplasticity and subsequent functional neurologic recovery
after ischemic reperfusion injury in rats. Further, we report
here that the beneficial effects of candesartan are mediated

through enhanced expression of VEGF and BDNF and the
subsequent increase in neuroplasticity markers
(synaptophysin and PDS95). We are encouraged that even
the low-dose candesartan had a large and enduring effect on
measures of plasticity, and this accompanied the sensorimotor
recovery at 14 days. These findings are consistent with our
previous studies with candesartan [17–19].
In the present study, the 0.3-mg/kg dose was selected based
on previous findings showing the beneficial effects of
candesartan on BP [32, 33]. Brdon et al. [32] found functional
improvement during treatment with low-dose candesartan
(0.3 mg/kg) consecutive for 7 days after MCAO. We now
document a sustained motor recovery for 14 days even after
the treatment is stopped, and we further elucidate the possible
molecular mechanisms involved. We also reported that an
acute single dose of candesartan (0.3 mg/kg) at 3 h after

MCAO only mildly reduced BP and did not improve early
(24 h) stroke outcomes (Supplement Figs. 1–3). While we can
not rule out an acute neuroprotective effect when the drug was
administered at 90 min, versus 3 h, as in the BP substudy
(Supplement data), the behavior assessment and molecular
data are consistent with a neurorestorative response. Recent
clinical trials suggest that the BP lowering effects of AT1
receptor blockade in the acute stroke period could outweigh
any benefit [5]. Subsequently, we considered it more relevant
to administer candesartan in a low dose (0.3 mg/kg) because it
only mildly affected BP.
Most studies report candesartan to be effective on acute
reduction in lesion size and early behavioral impairments, but
less is known about its long-term neurorestorative effects
following stroke. To address this, we examined candesartan’s
effects on a panel of behavioral tests (Bederson score, beam

walk, grip strength, and accelerating rotarod) sensitive to
unilateral ischemic insult. Consistent with the earlier observations [32, 33], we found that behavioral deficits caused by
MCAO were significantly improved by candesartan treatment
when measured at repeated intervals (1, 3, 7, and 14 days)
after the MCAO. The degree of improvement was substantial
(almost return to normal functioning) at days 7 and 14 postMCAO. Further, treatment with candesartan significantly reduced the infarct size following MCAO in rats.
The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a gene family
of extracellular matrix enzymes which damage the blood brain
barrier (BBB) by degrading extracellular matrix proteins (e.g.,
laminin) and cause neuronal death in the acute injury phase
[34]. However, at a later stage of injury, these same proteases
have a beneficial role in accelerating neurovascular remodeling [35]. A recent study has shown that MMPs may promote
vascular remodeling by accelerating angiogenesis [36] and are
required for improving long-term recovery [37]. Emerging
evidence suggests that inhibition of MMPs during the late
phase is associated with more severe brain injury and worsened functional outcome [38]. Although there are many
MMPs, an important role for MMP-3 (stromelysin-1) in particular has been identified, leading to increased expression of
its target extracellular matrix proteins and plasticity [29, 30,
39]. Our results demonstrate that low-dose candesartan

increased the expression of MMP-3 and prevented the degradation of laminin.
Ang-1 plays a prominent role in angiogenesis as well as
vascular stability [40–42]. Ang-1 exerts a barrier protective
function as well as anangiogenic effect after stroke [31, 43].
The expression of Ang-1 is acutely downregulated after focal
cerebral ischemia [44] and linked to increased BBB permeability and edema [40]. On the other hand, treatment with
recombinant adenoviruses expressing Ang-1 reduces BBB
leakage in ischemic brain and decreases infarction in mice
[45], and transgenic overexpression of Ang-1 increases vascular stabilization [46]. In the present study, Ang-1 expression
was significantly increased after low-dose candesartan administration. Our data is consistent with our previous findings of
candesartan’s vascular protective effects after ischemic stroke
[19, 18]. This sheds light on the possible molecular mediators
involved in such a response.
Neurotrophic factors are crucial in brain development and
cell survival in adults. They participate in protection and
proliferation of neuronal, glial, and endothelial cells. Among
others, VEGF and BDNF are two important neurotrophic
factors with pleiotropic effects on brain function, including
neuroprotection, vascular remodeling, neurogenesis, neuronal
survival, and plasticity [13, 14, 10]. As one of the most
potentangiogenic factors, VEGF is upregulated by focal

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 51:1542–1553

cerebral ischemia not only in animal models but also in human
patients [47, 48] as an angiogenic, neurotrophic, and neuroprotective factor [49, 50]. VEGF also plays a vital role during
neural [50] and vascular remodeling [51] after stroke. BDNF
regulates neuronal survival, cell migration, and neuroplasticity
[15, 16]. Increased production of neurotrophic factors has
been proposed as a mechanism of functional recovery and
neuroplasticity after cerebral ischemia [10, 52].
Neuroplasticity enhances functional recovery after brain injury [53] and is partially regulated by synaptic proteins
(synaptophysin and PSD-95). Synaptophysin, also known as
the major synaptic vesicle protein p38, is a transmembrane
glycoprotein of neuroendocrine vesicles [54]. Synaptophysin
plays an important role in presynaptic plasticity and synaptogenesis [55]. Additionally, PSD-95 plays an important function in the maturation of presynaptic and postsynaptic components [56–58]. The expression of PSD-95 is markedly
decreased in the hippocampus after brain injury including
TBI and stroke [23, 59]. Our results showed that ischemiainduced VEGF expression but candesartan treatment further
increased VEGF expression, resulting in increased
microvessel formation. We also found that candesartan treatment significantly increased the expression of BDNF and
TrkB. Increased expression of BDNF and its receptors after
ischemic injury to the brain can improve synaptic functional
processes. Moreover, candesartan treatment increased the expression of synaptophysin and PSD-95. Our study, which is
the first to document the long-term effect of candesartan on
VEGF, BDNF, and synaptic protein expression after cerebral

1551

ischemia, suggests that candesartan’s induction of neurotrophic factors results in improved post-stroke plasticity.
This study focused on the efficacy of low-dose candesartan
to promote neurotrophic factor involvement in plasticity and
long-term recovery after ischemic injury and did not explore
in detail the underlying mechanisms of this therapy. Further
studies are needed to determine the specific role of VEGF or
BDNF in neurogenesis and functional recovery by using
VEGF or BDNF-targeting methods (such as gene transfer
methods) locally in the brain.
In conclusion, our data suggest that repeated treatments
with a low, subhypotensive dose of candesartan enhanced
neuroplasticity through increased VEGF and BDNF after
stroke, which may be the mechanism by which candesartan
reduced ischemic neuronal damage and enhanced functional
recovery (Fig. 7). Taken together, these data suggest that
blockade of AT1R after stroke promotes stroke recovery when
excessive BP lowering is avoided.
