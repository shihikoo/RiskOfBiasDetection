It has been reported that ischemic postconditioning (PC) changes the reperfusion pattern in permanent
or transient models of stroke and confers neuroprotection. However, the effects of PC and subsequent use
of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for the treatment of embolic stroke have not yet been investigated.
Rats were subjected to stroke by injection of a preformed clot into the middle cerebral artery and randomly assigned to vehicle (saline 0.1 ml/100 g), tPA (3 mg/kg), PC only or PC þ tPA (3 mg/kg). tPA was
injected at 6 h after embolic stroke and PC was conducted at 6.5 h after ischemia by using ﬁve cycles of a
10 s occlusion and 30 s of reopening of the bilateral common carotid arteries. Cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF)
was monitored for 60 min from the time of tPA injection. Infarct size, blood brain barrier disruption,
edema, neurological deﬁcits, reactive oxygen species and apoptosis were measured 2 days later. PC
decreased infarct volume, but PC þtPA was more neuroprotective than PC alone. While tPA alone dramatically increased CBF, conducting PC caused a gradual increase in CBF. A combination of PCþ tPA reduced BBB leakage, brain edema, apoptosis and reactive oxygen species levels. Furthermore, a combination of PC þ tPA improved neurological functions at 48 h after the induced stroke. In conclusion, PC
hampered malignant hyperemia after reperfusion with tPA and extended its therapeutic window up to
6 h. Compared to PC alone, combination of thrombolysis and PC showed a better neuroprotection.

1. Introduction
Reperfusion with thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator
(tPA) remains the only treatment proven to be effective when
administered within 3–4.5 h after ischemia onset (Garcia-Bermejo
et al., 2012; Li et al., 2011; Saver, 2011). The short therapeutic time
window is a major limitation for tPA treatment since delayed reestablishment of circulation may lead to sudden reperfusion injury. Rapid reperfusion following thrombolytic therapy, which is
referred to malignant hyperemia, covers a large part of the ischemic territory and correlates with microvascular damage (Lu
et al., 2010) which contributes to secondary injury through a
cascade of events such as brain edema, hemorrhage, free radical
formation, inﬂammatory responses and BBB disruption (Joo et al.,
2013; Lin et al., 2010; Molina, 2011; Perez-Asensio et al., 2010).
It has been reported that interrupting hyperemia or reperfusion
at the time of reperfusion reduces infarct size after transient (Zhao

et al., 2006) or permanent middle cerebral (MCA) occlusion (Ren
et al., 2008). Despite this, no research has been done to directly
alter the patterns of reperfusion after tPA administration to mitigate reperfusion injury by interrupting the early hyperemic response or malignant hyperemia after reperfusion. The current lack
of clinical treatment for acute stroke requires the exploration of
new treatments that may eventually lead to clinical application.
One of these concepts is ischemic postconditioning (PC). PC is
deﬁned as a series of rapid intermittent interruptions of blood
ﬂow in the early phase of reperfusion that mechanically alters the
hydrodynamics of reperfusion. In brain, ischemic postconditioning
is conducted by a series of brief occlusion and release of the bilateral common carotid arteries (CCA) after reperfusion (Zhao
et al., 2006). Several investigators recently demonstrated that PC
protects the brain from injury in transient or permanent MCA
occlusion models and delayed PC mitigates the adverse effects of
tPA after permanent MCA occlusion (Ren et al., 2008; Xing et al.,
2008; Yuan et al., 2010).
Extending the therapeutic time window of intravenous
thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke beyond the current 4.5 h
time window would be of signiﬁcant importance in the treatment

56

of stroke patients (Garcia-Bermejo et al., 2012). Since reperfusion
injury is one of the major obstacles to extending the time window
of thrombolysis, a strategy is required that reduces the tPA-induced reperfusion injury or malignant hyperemia and potentially
increase the therapeutic window. There is also a need for interventions that may be combined with a low dose of tPA to reduce
neurotoxicity, decrease the risk of hemorrhage and death, and
augment the neuroprotective effects (Turner and Vink, 2012; Zhu
et al., 2010). We report here an evaluation of whether conducting
PC at the time of reperfusion with delayed administration of tPA,
beginning 6 h after ischemic injury onset, could prevent malignant
hyperemia, reduce infarct volume, neurological deﬁcits, BBB
breakdown, oxidative stress, brain edema and apoptosis in the
embolic model of stroke.

2. Material and methods
2.1. Animals and experimental groups
Animals were handled in accordance with the criteria outlined
in the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (US NIH
publication, revised 1996; http://books.nap.edu/readingroom/
books/labrats/). Experimental protocols were approved by the
animal ethics committee of the Rafsanjan University of Medical
Sciences. A total of 92 male Wistar rats weighting 200–250 g were
maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. Four sets of experiments were performed and
animals were randomly divided into each group of experiments. In
the ﬁrst experiment, infarct volume and behavioral outcome were
determined at 48 h after stroke. 32 rats (N ¼ 8 in each group) were
randomly assigned to vehicle (saline 0.1 ml/100 g; i.v.), tPA (3 mg/
kg; i.v.), PC, or a combination of PC þtPA. Saline or tPA was intravenously injected at 6 h after initiation of ischemia and PC was
induced at 6.5 h after stroke induction (Fig.1.). Regional cerebral
blood ﬂow (rCBF) was extracranially monitored using Laser-doppler ﬂowmetry (LDF) from the time of saline or tPA injection for
60 min (see below). Three rats did not show any increase in blood
ﬂow during the 30 min period after tPA therapy. These animals
were excluded from further study and replaced. The dose of tPA
(Actilyse, Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany) was determined from
previous stroke studies (Haelewyn et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2010)

and from our preliminary results in which improved reperfusion
was not observed between 3 mg/kg and the highest dose of tPA
(9 mg/kg). In the second experiment, 20 animals (N ¼5 in each
group) were randomly assigned to vehicle, tPA, PC or PC þtPA to
determine blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability at 48 h after
stroke. In the third experiment, 20 animals (N ¼ 5 in each group)
were randomly assigned to vehicle, tPA, PC or PC þtPA to determine apoptosis and reactive oxygen species levels at 48 h after
stroke. In the forth experiment, the same animals and groups of
the third experiment were used to calculate brain edema formation at 48 h after stroke.
2.2. Surgical preparation
Rats were anesthetized with 1.5% halothane in a 21% O2 and
79% N2 mixture. Normothermic (37 75 °C) body temperature was
maintained throughout the surgery. For preparation of embolus,
the right common carotid artery of the donor rat was catheterized
and blood was transferred directly into a 20 cm length of PE-50
tube, kept at 37 °C for 2 h, to facilitate clotting, and then refrigerated for 22 h at 4 °C prior to use. A two cm segment of clot
ﬁlled PE-50 tube was cut and the clot expelled from the tube and
transferred into another PE-50 modiﬁed tube with an outer diameter of 0.3 mm for injection into the MCA (Allahtavakoli and
Jarrott, 2011). Arterial blood draws were obtained via the catheter
placed in the tail artery, for continuous blood pressure monitoring.
A blood gas, oximetry, electrolyte and metabolic system machine
(Radiometer Medical A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used to
monitor arterial Pao2, Paco2, pH and glucose. For rCBF monitoring
by LDF, the scalp was opened, the right temporalis muscle was
gently separated from the bone, and the right skull bone was
thinned by a cooled-dental drill. For rCBF measurement, the probe
was attached to the bone 1.7 mm posterior and 5 mm mediolateral
to the bregma. rCBF was measured 5 min before clot injection as
the baseline value, at the time of stroke induction, and for up to
60 min after tPA or saline injection.
2.3. Induction of embolic stroke model
The embolic stroke model was induced by injection of a preformed clot into the MCA as previously reported (Allahtavakoli
and Jarrott, 2011). Brieﬂy, a longitudinal incision of 1.5 cm in

length was made in the midline of the ventral cervical skin. The
right common carotid artery, internal carotid artery, and external
carotid artery were exposed. The distal portion of the external
carotid artery was ligated and cut. The modiﬁed PE-50 tube with
the 20 mm clot was connected to a 50-ml Hamilton lock syringe,
and advanced 17–19 mm in the internal carotid artery until its tip
was inside of the MCA. The clot was then injected, and the catheter
was removed. The wound was closed, and the animal was returned to its cage. A minimum initial reduction of 70% in the LDF
reading was considered a successful occlusion of the MCA perfusion territory. Animals that did not show 70% reduction in the laser
Doppler reading were deemed to have had failed successful clot
placement and were excluded from any further study and replaced. For sham-operated animals, the surgery was the same
except 5 μl saline was injected into MCA. The surgeon was blinded
to the drug treatment regimen of the animals. In all cases the
duration of the surgery did not exceed 30 min.

determined at 620 nm using spectrophotometry (UV7500, Spectro
Lab, England) and data were expressed as absorbance per gram of
tissue.
2.7. Behavioral tests

PC was conducted 6.5 h after MCA embolization (Fig.1.) by
temporarily occluding and reopening of bilateral CCAs with 4-0
silk strings that had been previously tied loosely around the CCAs.
PC was performed using ﬁve cycles of a 10 s occlusion and 30 s of
reperfusion (Zhao et al., 2006).

Rats were trained on the adhesive removal test for sensorimotor function daily for 3 days before stroke. Animals were then
tested before surgery and at 24 and 48 h post-stroke. Time taken
to touch and remove each stimulus from the limb was recorded
during 3 trials and averaged. Grasping ability and forelimb
strength were measured using a hanging wire test. Rats used their
forelimbs to suspend their body weight on a wire stretched between 2 posts 60 cm above a foam pillow (Li et al., 2004). The time
(s) until the rat fell was recorded. A score of zero was assigned if
the animal fell immediately whereas 20 s was the time out period.
Two trials were performed for each rat on each testing day and
averaged. Neurological deﬁcits were recorded at 24 and 48 h after
embolic stroke and determined using a 6-point scoring system
modiﬁed from Bederson and coworkers (Bederson et al., 1986) as
follows: 0, no observable deﬁcit; 1, forelimb ﬂexion; 2, forelimb
ﬂexion plus decreased resistance to lateral push; 3, unidirectional
circling; 4, unidirectional circling plus decreased levels of consciousness; and 5, death. Behavioral tests were carried out by an
observer blind to the experimental groups.

2.5. Measurement of infarct volume and brain edema

2.8. Detection of reactive oxygen species generation

All animals were humanly killed 48 h after the onset of embolic
stroke. The brains were removed from the skull and cut into
2-mm-thick coronal sections in a cutting block and stained with
2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C
followed by overnight immersion in 10% formalin. The infarct
tissue remained unstained (white), whereas normal tissue was
stained red. The infarct zone was demarcated and analyzed by
Image J software (NIH Image, version 1.61). Infarct areas of all
sections were added to determine the total infarct area, which was
multiplied by the thickness (2 mm) of the brain sections to obtain
the infarct volume. To compensate for the effect of brain edema,
the corrected infarct volume was calculated as follows: corrected
infarct area¼measured infarct area  (1-[(ipsilateral hemisphere
area-contralateral hemisphere area)/contralateral hemisphere]).
Wet–dry weight technique was used to directly measure brain
edema as reported elsewhere (Gerriets et al., 2004). Brieﬂy, after
euthanization, the rat brains were divided into right (injured) or
left (non-injured) hemispheres and weighted for wet weight
(WW), sectioned, baked at 100 °C for 48 h and weighted again for
dry weight (DW). The percent of water content (%WC) of each
hemisphere was calculated as: [1  (DW/WW)]  100. Finally, the
percentage of edema in each brain was calculated by subtracting
the %WC of the non-injured hemisphere from the %WC of the
injured hemisphere.

Dihydroethidium (DHE) ﬂuorescence can be used to detect
both intracellular and extracellular superoxide (Xiao et al., 2012).
The generation of peri-infarct reactive oxygen species was assessed by DHE (Sigma, USA). Brieﬂy, fresh brain tissue was quickly
frozen and stored at  80 °C until being sectioned by the cryosection (E1100325, SLEE, Germany). The sections (15 μm) were
washed with warm phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution and
then incubated with 5 μM DHE for 30 min at 37 °C in PBS. DHE
speciﬁcally reacts with superoxide anions and converts them to
the red ﬂuorescence compound ethidium. The sections were then
examined and photographed by using an inverted ﬂuorescent
microscope equipped with a digital camera. Three sections
(1.7 mm from Bregma) were measured from each brain and the
mean of the specimens was used for data analysis. Measurements
were taken at 200 μm intervals on each image of peri-infarct areas
using image processing software as previously described (Xiao
et al., 2012). For these analyses, the experimenter was blinded to
the treatment assignations.

2.4. The treatment regime for ischemic postconditioning

2.6. Evaluation of BBB integrity
The permeability of the BBB was determined by using Evans
blue as previously reported (Jiao et al., 2011). Brieﬂy, rats were
given 4 mL/kg of 2% Evans blue (EB; Sigma, Germany) solution
intravenously via the femoral vein. One hour after EB injection, the
deeply anesthetized rats were infused with warm saline (37 °C)
administered through the cardiac ventricle until colorless infusion
ﬂuid was obtained from the atrium. The rats were subsequently
decapitated, the brains were removed from the skull and divided
into right or left hemispheres. After that, both hemispheres were
weighed and ﬁxed in formamide (1 ml/100 mg) at 60 °C for 24 h.
ﬁnally, the concentration of dye extracted from each brain was

2.9. TUNEL (terminal uridine deoxynucleotidyl transferase) assay
Apoptosis in the peri-infarct areas was assessed using an in situ
cell death detection kit from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim,
Germany). Brieﬂy, ﬁfteen micrometer fresh-frozen brain sections
from infarct areas were cut and incubated and permeabilized in a
0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate solution. Subsequently
the sections were incubated with 50 μL of TUNEL reaction mixture
including an enzyme solution (TdT) and a label solution (TRITClabeled nucleotides) in a humidiﬁed chamber for 1 h at 37 °C in
the absence of light. The slides were rinsed three times in PBS and
peri-infarct areas visualized using an inverted ﬂuorescent microscope equipped with a digital camera. Apoptosis was expressed as
the number of positively labeled neurons at 200 μm intervals on
each image of peri-infarct areas.

integrity, brain edema, reactive oxygen species levels, behavioral
tests and apoptosis were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Laser
Doppler data were compared by two-way ANOVA. Individual differences were determined by Tukey’s test. Nonparametric MannWhitney test was used for the comparisons of neurological deﬁcits. A value of P o0.05 was considered to be signiﬁcant.

3. Results
3.1. Blood ﬂow and physiological parameters
There were no signiﬁcant differences in the initial mean laser
Doppler readings between treatment groups. The percentage of
laser Doppler reductions at the time of ischemia induction were
727 6%, 73 75%, 707 7 and 75 78 for the controls, PC, tPA and
PC þtPA treatment groups, respectively. There were no signiﬁcant
differences between groups in any of the physiological parameters
measured (Table1). In two rats of the tPA group and one animal of
PC þtPA group in the ﬁrst experiment hemorrhage was inspected
during sectioning the brains for TTC staining but this difference
was not signiﬁcant among the groups.
3.2. Effects of PC and tPA on infarct volume and blood ﬂow of the
MCA region
We did not observe any cerebral infarction and neurological
deﬁcits in the sham-operated animals. While administration of tPA
at 6 h after stroke increased infarct volume when measured at
48 h after stroke, PC with 10 s occlusion and 30 s reperfusion at
6.5 h after stroke reduced infarct volume compared to the control
and tPA groups (Po 0.05). On the other hand, application of PC at
the time of reperfusion with tPA (30 min after tPA injection) signiﬁcantly reduced the infarct volume by approximately 82%
compared to tPA alone or control treated rats (P o0.001). Combination therapy of PC and tPA also showed better neuroprotection
than PC alone (P o0.05; Fig.2). As expected, tPA (3 mg/kg) alone
dramatically increased rCBF or reperfusion at about 30 min after
injection of the drug (Po 0.01), reaching approximately 78% above
of baseline (P o0.001). rCBF remained signiﬁcantly higher than the
other groups until 60 min after the drug injection (Po 0.05).
Conversely, conducting PC at 30 min after tPA administration,
caused a slow and gradual increase rather than a dramatic increase
in rCBF, which was higher than control and PC only at 60 min after
tPA injection (P o0.05; Fig.3.).

3.3. Effects of PC and tPA on BBB leakage and brain edema

(P o0.001). Compared to the control or tPA groups, PC alone also
reduced BBB disruption when applied at 6.5 h after embolic stroke
(P o0.001; Fig.4.). Furthermore, applying PC with 5 cycles of 10 s
occlusion and 30 s of reperfusion at 30 min after tPA injection
signiﬁcantly reduced brain edema compared to tPA alone or the
control rats (P o0.001). Compared to the control group, applying
PC alone at 6.5 h after stroke also showed a slight but signiﬁcant
reduction in brain edema (P o0.05; Fig.4.).

Injection of tPA at 6 h after stroke disturbed BBB integration but
when combined with PC, it did not cause BBB disruption

physiological parameters.

Although PC or tPA alone did not show any signiﬁcant effect, a
combination of them signiﬁcantly increased grasping ability and
forelimb strength of animals at 48 h after the induced stroke
(P o0.001). In addition, compared to the tPA group, the rats
treated with a combination of PC and tPA showed increased
forelimb strength at 24 h after stroke (P o0.05; Fig.5A.). Compared
to the control and tPA groups, latency to remove sticky labels from
the stroke affected contralateral forepaw was signiﬁcantly reduced
in the PC group (P o0.005) and tPA þPC (P o0.001) treated rats at
48 h following stroke (Fig.5B.). According to Bederson's scoring
system, both PC and a combination of tPA with PC signiﬁcantly
reduced neurological deﬁcits at 48 h following stroke (P o0.01).
Meanwhile, a combination of PC with tPA was neuroprotective at
24 h following ischemia (P o0.05; Fig.6.).

but a combination of tPA with PC or PC alone signiﬁcantly decreased reactive oxygen species levels at 48 h following stroke
(P o0.05; Fig.7. Panel A). Apoptosis was assessed by the number of
TUNEL-positive cells in the peri-infarct areas of the injured

of ischemic postconditioning alone at 6.5 h after the embolic
stroke (using 5 cycles of 10 s occlusion and 30 s reperfusion of the
bilateral common carotid arteries) reduces ischemic damage, BBB
leakage, brain edema, peri-infarct apoptosis and neurological
deﬁcits. Although the mechanisms involved are poorly understood, many studies have are in accordance with the ﬁndings reported here by reporting the neuroprotective properties of postconditioning in permanent, transient (Xing et al., 2008) or global
(Burda et al., 2006) cerebral ischemia. Inhibition of reactive oxygen
species levels (Wang et al., 2009), apoptosis (Wang et al., 2009)
and inﬂammation (Joo et al., 2013) are among the common possible mechanisms of action of ischemic postconditioning in stroke.
Toll-like receptor 4 signaling and innate immunity may also be
involved in the protective mechanisms of postconditioning and
ischemic tolerance (Feng et al., 2011). However, the reperfusion
pattern of embolic stroke used in the current study varies from the
above mentioned models and is induced by the MCA embolization.
This model of cerebral ischemia reﬂects human thromboembolic
stroke from the perspective that both human and rat can be
treated by thrombolysis therapy with tPA. Furthermore, local inﬂammatory responses in experimental thromboembolic stroke
correspond to changes seen in human stroke (Lehmann et al.,
2014). Although adequate and proper reperfusion with tPA is essential to limit the development of ischemic stroke, sudden and
late hyperemia beyond the current 4.5 h time window causes reperfusion injury which may cause hemorrhage, disrupt the neurovascular unit and BBB integrity (Molina, 2011; Wang et al., 2008;
Zhang et al., 2012). In the current study, thrombolysis therapy at
6 h after embolic stroke caused reactive hyperemia at about
20 min after injection of tPA, as measured by extracranial LD-CBF,
and reached more than 50% of the baseline at about 35 min after
thrombolysis. Although it remained more than 20% above the
baseline, LD-CBF gradually declined until 60 min after thrombolysis. Hyperemia above 20% of baseline is called malignant hyperemia and causes damage to the neurovascular unit and is a sign
of reperfusion injury which tends to develop larger infarction and
causes a deterioration of neurological function in both patients
and animal models of stroke (Perez-Asensio et al., 2010). Interestingly, it has been suggested that when patients undergo a
longer time of ischemia, complete recanalization may result in
malignant hyperemia. In this situation, anti-reperfusion injury
measurements should be taken to reduce exacerbation of ischemic
edema caused by post-ischemic hyperemia (Lu et al., 2010).
Several studies have shown that the suppression of reactive
hyperemia by ischemic postconditioning is possible and neuroprotective (Han et al., 2014; Joo et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2011). In
the current study, when ischemic postconditioning was conducted
30 min after tPA therapy, the results showed that the treatment
hampered the abrupt hyperemic response or reperfusion injury
after thrombolysis therapy. Furthermore, application of ischemic
postconditioning at 30 min after tPA therapy allowed a gradual
reperfusion of less than 20% of baseline which was a signiﬁcant
improvement over the non-treated animals at 60 min after tPA
administration (Figs.1. and 3.). An overt reactive hyperemia of the
cerebral ischemic tissue after similar conditions to those in the
present study has been reported by others in ischemia/reperfusion
(Zhao, 2009; Zhao et al., 2006) or permanent MCA occlusion plus
15 min of bilateral CCA occlusion (Ren et al., 2008), which was
improved by ischemic postconditioning. Hence, it is very important from a clinical perspective that ischemic postconditioning
mitigates reperfusion injury of delayed tPA therapy and extends its
therapeutic window. In addition to attenuating malignant hyperemia, it has been shown that ischemic postconditioning reduces
the other adverse effects of tPA in the permanent MCA occlusion
model of stroke (Zhao, 2009). Our data showed that thrombolysis
therapy at 6 h after stroke and application of PC at the time of

A. Esmaeeli-Nadimi et al. / European Journal of Pharmacology 764 (2015) 55–62

reperfusion with tPA signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume and
neurological deﬁcits. This is novel data indicating that ischemic
postconditioning confers better neuroprotection when combined
with tPA.
Based on our data, late ischemic postconditioning reduces brain
edema and BBB disruption measured by Evans blue extravasation.
Interestingly, when conducted after late reperfusion with tPA, ischemic postconditioning more effectively preserved BBB integrity
and signiﬁcantly reduced brain edema compared to ischemic
postconditioning alone. These data, along with other investigations, indicate that neuroprotection with restoration of tissue
perfusion and vascular integrity confer better outcomes (Zhang
et al., 2012). Consistent with our ﬁndings, a recent investigation
aimed at studying the effects of postconditioning on the neurovascular unit showed that PC improved BBB integrity, reduced
injury to neurons, astrocytes and brain endothelial cells. PC also
increased the expression of tight junction proteins claudin-5 and
occludin in brain microvessel endothelium indicating that it preserved the neurovascular unit of brain tissue after stroke insult
(Han et al., 2014).
It is well known that generation of excessive reactive oxygen
species and apoptosis during reperfusion plays a major role in
brain injury associated with cerebral ischemia. The data presented
here indicate that delayed reperfusion, induced by tPA, signiﬁcantly increases reactive oxygen species levels and apoptotic
cells in the ischemic area of the brain. Conversely, application of
ischemic postconditioning at the time of reperfusion signiﬁcantly
eliminates the effects of late tPA administration. These data are in
accord with another investigation showing the neuroprotection of
ischemic postconditioning by reduction of reactive oxygen species
levels in ischemic penumbra (Wang et al., 2009). Furthermore, our
data showed that PC alone or in combination with tPA signiﬁcantly
inhibited apoptosis as assessed by the reduced number of TUNELpositive cells. Hence, the results of our present study conﬁrm the
data of many investigators which show that postconditioning inhibits apoptosis (Xing et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2010).
One may argue that ischemic postconditioning is hard to apply
beyond laboratory investigations. However, brieﬂy occluding the
common carotid artery is a safe and widely used manipulation for
carotid endartectomy in order to prevent stroke (Deriu et al.,
1994). In fact, physicians often manually compress the carotid artery for carotid artery stenting (Egashira et al., 2014). However, in
cases where access to the carotid arteries is difﬁcult, remote ischemic postconditioning could be conducted in a distant organ
which in turn may provide neuroprotection and this could be a
useful substitute as it has been shown that this procedure may
attenuate brain injury after focal ischemia (Ren et al., 2009). These
results should be considered as baseline data that can be used to
validate the beneﬁcial effects of ischemic postconditioning in ischemic stroke therapy. We have opened a new window for further
research in this area which leaves an opportunity for more studies.
Translating of these ﬁndings from bench to bed requires both basic
science and continued clinical research.

5. Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study showing the
effects of ischemic postconditioning, using 5 cycles of 10 s occlusion and 30 s reperfusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries,
on the reperfusion pattern of embolic stroke after thrombolysis
therapy. Based on our data, ischemic postconditioning signiﬁcantly
reduced malignant hyperemia and reperfusion injury after
thrombolysis therapy and extended the therapeutic window of tPA
up to six hours post-stroke. Alternatively, application of ischemic
postconditioning at 30 min after tPA allowed a gradual

reperfusion, reduced infarct volume, BBB leakage, brain edema,
reactive oxygen species levels, apoptosis; and improved neurological functions in the stroke animals. Late ischemic postconditioning also showed a signiﬁcant but lower neuroprotection
than when combined with thrombolysis therapy. Further investigations are necessary to illustrate the exact effects and patterns of ischemic postconditioning on the embolic stroke after
achieving reperfusion by tPA.
