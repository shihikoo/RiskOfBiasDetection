Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), a histone deacetylase, has been suggested to be effective in
ischemic brain diseases. Salvianolic acid B (SalB) is a polyphenolic and one of the active components
of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge. Previous studies suggested that SalB is protective against ischemic stroke.
However, the role of SIRT1 in the protective effect of SalB against cerebral ischemia has not been explored.
In this study, the rat brain was subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Before this surgery,
rats were intraperitoneally administrated SalB with or without EX527, a speciﬁc SIRT1 inhibitor. The
infarct volume, neurological score and brain water content were assessed. In addition, levels of TNF␣ and IL-1␤ in the brain tissues were detected by commercial ELISA kits. And the expression levels of
SIRT, Ac-FOXO1, Bcl-2 and Bax were detected by Western blot. The results suggested that SalB exerted
a cerebral-protective effect, as shown by reduced infarct volume, lowered brain edema and increased
neurological scores. SalB also exerted anti-inﬂammatory effects as indicated by the decreased TNF-␣ and
IL-1␤ levels in the brain tissue. Moreover, SalB upregulated the expression of SIRT1 and Bcl-2 and downregulated the expression of Ac-FOXO1 and Bax. These effects of SalB were abolished by EX527 treatment.
In summary, our results demonstrate that SalB treatment attenuates brain injury induced by ischemic
stoke via reducing apoptosis and inﬂammation through the activation of SIRT1 signaling.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke remains a leading cause of death and is associated with a high incidence of mortality and morbidity worldwide
(Donnan et al., 2008; Hankey, 2012). Ischemic stroke results from
the occlusion of a cerebral vessel and the middle cerebral artery
(MCA) is often involved. When blood supply is damaged, a series
of pathophysiologic events occur, such as glutamate excitotoxicity, calcium overload, oxidative stress, inﬂammation, apoptosis
and mitochondrial dysfunction (Mattiasson et al., 2003; Reiter
et al., 2007; Sahota and Savitz, 2011; Thompson et al., 2015).
Although thrombolytic agents have been used for clinical treatment
of ischemic stroke, their application is limited due to the narrow
therapeutic window and other safety concerns (Mattiasson et al.,

2003; Yepes et al., 2009). Therefore, there is an urgent need for the
development of novel therapeutic agents for treatment of ischemic
stroke.
Danshen, the dried root of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, is a Chinese
medicinal herb. It has been widely used for treatment of hepatitis,
hemorrhage, menstrual abnormalities, as well as ischemic brain
and heart diseases (Ji et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2013). It is one of
the main components of Xinnaoning, a drug used for cardiovascular and cerebral vascular diseases. Salvianolic acid B (SalB, Fig. 1),
the most abundant and bioactive compound of Danshen, has been
suggested to exert various pharmacological effects, such as antioxidation, anti-inﬂammation and anti-tumor (Li et al., 2014; Tang
et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013). Previous studies have suggested
that SalB has protective effects in ischemic stroke. However, the
underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated.
Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) is a histone deacetylase,
and its activity is dependent on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). SIRT1 expression decreases with age and is known

2.3. Rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion
A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was established as previously described (Longa et al., 1989). Brieﬂy, rats
were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg). The right common carotid artery was
then exposed and isolated. The MCA was occluded by inserting
a monoﬁlament nylon suture with a heat-rounded tip into the
internal carotid artery, which was advanced further until it closed
the origin of the MCA. Thirty minutes after induction of ischemia,
reperfusion was initiated by withdrawal of the monoﬁlament.
Sham-operated control rats received the same surgical procedure
without MCA occlusion. Rectal temperature was maintained at
37 ◦ C using a heating blanket and heating lamp during the surgery.

to plays a key role in the longevity effects induced by calorie
restriction (Kilic et al., 2015; Ramis et al., 2015). SIRT1 deacetylates
and activates forkhead box O (FOXO), which synthesizes antioxidants, such as manganese superoxide dismutase and catalase,
promoting cellular resistance against oxidative stress (Brunet et al.,
2004). In addition, SIRT1 has been suggested to be critical in cerebral protection. Ischemia preconditioning (Thompson et al., 2013)
and hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning (Herskovits and Guarente,
2014) reportedly decrease cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury
via SIRT1 activation. Intriguingly, a previous study suggested that
SalB protects against ischemic stroke (Tian et al., 2009; Zhu et al.,
2013). In addition, SalB is suggested to protect against acute
ethanol-induced liver injury through SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53 (Li et al., 2014). However, the role of SIRT1 in
the protective effect of SalB against ischemic stroke remains
unclear.

SalB was dissolved in normal saline and injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 25 mg/kg administrated twice (immediately
after induction of ischemia and at the beginning of reperfusion). As
reported previously (Yang et al., 2013), the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527
was ﬁrst dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and diluted to
the ﬁnal concentration with normal saline (the ﬁnal DMSO concentration <2%). EX527 was intraperitoneally injected at the dose
of 5 mg/kg or the same volume of vehicle was performed every
2 days for four times before MCAO. All the rats were randomly
assigned to the following groups (n = 10 in each group): Sham,
MCAO, MCAO + SalB, MCAO + SalB + EX527 and MCAO + EX527.
2.5. Evaluation of neurological deﬁcit
Neurological deﬁcit scores were evaluated by an observer
blinded to the experimental groups at 24 h after MCAO as reported
previously (Longa et al., 1989). The scores are as follows: 0, no
motor deﬁcits (normal); 1, forelimb weakness and torso turning to
the ipsilateral side when held by tail (mild); 2, circling to the contralateral side but normal posture at rest (moderate); 3, unable to
bear weight on the affected side at rest (severe); 4, no spontaneous
locomotor activity or barrel rolling (critical).

2. Materials and methods
2.6. Evaluation of infarct volume
2.1. Reagents
SalB (purity >98%) was purchased from the National Institute
for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products (Beijing,
China). 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) was purchased
from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). EX527 was purchased
from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). Antibodies against acetylateFOXO1 (Ac-FOXO1), Bcl2, Bax, and ␤-actin were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Antibody against
SIRT1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA, USA). The rabbit anti-goat, goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse
secondary antibodies were purchased from the Zhongshan Company (Beijing, China).

Infarct volume was evaluated by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) at 24 h after reperfusion. Animals were euthanized
and the brains were quickly removed. Then the brain was sliced
into ﬁve coronal sections (3 mm thick each) and stained with 2%
solution of TTC at 37 ◦ C for 20 min, followed by ﬁxation in 4%
paraformaldehyde. TTC-stained sections were photographed and
the digital images were analyzed using image analysis software
(Image-Pro Plus 5.1). The lesion volume was calculated by multiplying the area by the thickness of slices. The percentage hemisphere
lesion volume (%HLV) was calculated by the following formula
(Tatlisumak, 1998): %HLV = ([total infarct volume − (the volume of
intact ipsilateral hemisphere − the volume of intact contralateral
hemisphere)])/contralateral hemisphere volume × 100%.

2.2. Animals
2.7. Brain water content
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (230–280 g), purchased from the
Laboratory Animal Center of Xinxiang Medical University, were
kept under a controlled environment (12/12 h light/dark cycle,
60 ± 5% humidity, 22 ± 3 ◦ C). And they have free access to water
and food. All procedures were carried out in accordance with
the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 80-23), revised
1996.

As described previously (Yang et al., 2015), after the wet weight
of the brain tissues was quantiﬁed, the red and white parts of these
brains were desiccated at 105 ◦ C for 48 h until the weight was constant. The total weight of the dried TTC-stained brains was obtained
by measuring the desiccated red and white parts of these brains
together, and the water content of each brain was calculated as
follows: (wet weight − dried weight)/wet weight × 100%.

2.8. Detection of inﬂammatory cytokines

2.9. Western blot

The inﬂammatory cytokines in brain tissue were measured
using commercially ELISA kits for TNF-␣ and IL-1␤ (Beyotime,
China). All spectrophotometric readings were performed with a
microplate reader (Multiskan MK3, Thermo, USA). All procedures
were performed according to the instructions.

The ischemic penumbra of cerebral cortex was collected. The
brain tissue was then lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl,
1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mMNa3 VO4 , 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol,
1% Triton X-100, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM
sodium ␤-glyceropyrophosphate, 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl

ﬂuoride and protease inhibitor mixture) for 10 min. The lysates
were centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g, and the resulting supernatant was collected and boiled. Protein concentrations of the
extracts were measured by BCA assay. The whole protein 50 ␮g
was resolved on 8–12% SDS polyacrylamide gel, then transferred
onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked
with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris [pH 7.5],
0.1% Tween-20) and then incubated with antibodies against SIRT1
(1:500), Ac-FOXO1, Bcl2, Bax and ␤-actin (1:1000) at 4 ◦ C overnight,
followed by washes with TBST. The membranes were then probed
with the appropriate secondary antibodies (1:5000) at room temperature for 2 h and washed with TBST. The protein bands were
detected using a BioRad imaging system (BioRad, Hercules, CA,
USA) and quantiﬁed using the Quantity One software package
(West Berkeley, CA, USA). The value for the MCAO group was
deﬁned as 100%.
2.10. Statistical analysis
Data were reported as mean ± standard error of the mean
(S.E.M.). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the
Dunnett’s test was performed to compare the differences (SPSS
13.0, Chicago, IL, USA). A value of P < 0.05 was considered to be
statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. SalB reduced brain injury after MCAO
To investigate the potential protective effects of SalB against
MCAO-induced brain injury, we examined the effect of SalB on brain
infarct volume, neurological score and cerebral edema. Compared
with the MCAO group, SalB signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume,
neurological score and brain water content in MCAO + SalB group
(Fig. 2) (P < 0.05).
3.2. Effect of SalB on the expressions of SIRT1, Ac-FOXO1, Bcl-2
and Bax
To investigate the key proteins involved in the protective role of
SalB, we analyzed the expression of SIRT1, Ac-FOXO1, Bcl-2 and Bax.
As shown in Fig. 3, SalB treatment signiﬁcantly increased SIRT1 and
Bcl-2 expression in MCAO + SalB compared with their expression in
MCAO group (P < 0.05). SalB also decreased the Ac-FOXO1, and Bax
expression in MCAO + SalB group compared with their expression
in MCAO group (Fig. 3) (P < 0.05).
3.3. Effect of SalB on the production of inﬂammatory cytokines in
brain tissue
To elucidate the effect of SalB on inﬂammation induce by MCAO,
we evaluated the production of TNF-␣ and IL-1␤ in the brain tissue.
SalB dramatically decreased the production of TNF-␣ and IL-1␤ in
the brain tissue in MCAO + SalB group compared with those in the
MCAO group (Fig. 4) (P < 0.05).
3.4. EX527 abolished the protective effect of SalB
We used EX527, a speciﬁc SIRT1 inhibitor, to investigate
whether SIRT1 is a key molecule in the protective effect of SalB
and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Compared with the
MCAO group, SalB signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume, neurological score and brain water content in MCAO + SalB group. However,
EX527 administration abolished the protective effect of SalB; it
increased the infarct volume, neurological score and brain edema in

MCAO + SalB + EX527 group compared with the MCAO + SalB group
(Fig. 5) (P < 0.05).
Western blot results suggested that SalB treatment signiﬁcantly
increased SIRT1 and Bcl-2 expression. SalB also decreased the
expression of Ac-FOXO1 and Bax. However, EX527 signiﬁcantly
decreased SIRT1 and Bcl-2 expression and increased Ac-FOXO1 and
Bax expression in the MCAO + SalB + EX527 group compared with
that in the MCAO + SalB group (Fig. 6) (P < 0.05).
4. Discussion
The major ﬁndings in the present study are: (1) SalB protects the
brain from ischemia. (2) SalB reduces inﬂammation in the ischemic
brain. (3) SalB decreases apoptosis in the ischemic brain. (4) The
activation of SIRT1 is involved in the neuroprotective effect of SalB.
S. miltiorrhiza has been widely used for treatment of various diseases in China (Zhou et al., 2005). Many studies have demonstrated
that SalB exerts various pharmacological activities, such as antiapoptosis, anti-inﬂammation, anti-diabetes, promotion of cellular
proliferation, differentiation and bone formation and preservation
of normal cell functions (He and Shen, 2014; Huang et al., 2015; Shi
et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2015; Zeng et al., 2010).

MCAO + SalB + EX527 group.

SalB has been shown to be beneﬁcial in the central nervous system. Zhu et al. suggest that SMND-309, a novel derivative of SalB,
protects rat brains ischemia and reperfusion injury by targeting the
JAK2/STAT3 pathway (Zhu et al., 2013). SalB confers neuroprotection via anti-inﬂammatory and anti-oxidative effects in Alzheimer’s
disease (Lee et al., 2013). And SalB attenuates cognitive dysfunctions in Alzheimer’s disease (Kim et al., 2011). In addition, SalB
has been suggested to protect against acute ethanol-induced liver
injury via SIRT1 activation (Li et al., 2014). These ﬁndings suggest
that SalB regulates inﬂammation and apoptosis in many diseases
and SIRT1 may be involved in this activity of SalB.
SIRT1, a member of the class III group of histone deacetylases, has been suggested to be protective in cerebral ischemia
(Yang et al., 2013, 2015). SIRT1 is thought to play an important
role in neuroprotection against brain ischemia by deacetylation
and subsequent inhibition of p53 and nuclear factor ␬B-induced
inﬂammatory and apoptotic pathways (Hernandez-Jimenez et al.,
2013). It also mediates hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning-induced
ischemic tolerance in the rat brain (Herskovits and Guarente, 2014).
Consistent with these ﬁndings, we found that SalB augmented
SIRT1 expression and inhibited apoptosis and inﬂammation. Our
results suggest that SIRT1 activation by SalB plays a critical role in
protection against cerebral ischemic injury.
In this study, we ﬁrst investigated the effect of SalB on infarct
volume, neurological score and brain water content. Our results
suggest that SalB signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume, neurological score and brain water content. Additionally, SalB dramatically
up-regulated SIRT1 expression, leading to down-regulation of AcFOXO1, which is downstream of SIRT1. Moreover, to investigate
the role of SalB in neuronal apoptosis, the expression of Bax and

Bcl-2 was analyzed. The results demonstrate that SalB signiﬁcantly
increased Bcl-2 and decreased Bax expression, indicating that SalB
inhibits apoptosis in ischemic stroke. To further investigate the role
of SIRT1 in the protective effect of SalB, we used EX527, a speciﬁc SIRT1, inhibitor to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Our
results suggest that EX527 abolishes the protective effect of SalB.
EX527 signiﬁcantly increased infarct volume, neurological score
and brain water content. In addition, EX527 abolished the antiapoptotic effect of SalB, as evidenced by the increased Bax and
decreased Bcl-2 expression. Therefore, these results suggest that
SIRT1 activation by SalB contributes to the attenuation of brain
injury induced by ischemic stroke.
Ischemic stroke is associated with the production and release
of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines such as TNF-␣ and IL-1␤ (Palencia
et al., 2015), and this triggers additional inﬂammatory processes
such as activation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), NOS, and NF-␬B
(Mohammadi et al., 2012; Ridder and Schwaninger, 2009). The
inﬂammation in turn may aggravate infarction, brain edema and
neuronal death. The present results suggest that SalB alleviates
inﬂammation as evidenced by the decrease of TNF-␣ and IL-1␤ levels in brain tissue. However, this effect was abolished by EX527,
indicating that the anti-inﬂammatory effect of SalB is associated
with SIRT1 signaling.
In summary, the present study suggested for the ﬁrst time that
SalB has a protective effect against ischemic stroke via the activation of SIRT1. SalB activates SIRT1 signaling, accompanied by
reduced expression of Ac-FOXO1, leading to increased Bcl-2 and
decreased Bax expression. Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest
that SalB may be an important therapeutic strategy for attenuating
brain injury associated with ischemic stroke.
