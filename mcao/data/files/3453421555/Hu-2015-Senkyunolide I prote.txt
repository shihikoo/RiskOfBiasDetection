SEI could signiﬁcantly activate the Nrf2/ARE pathway by up-regulating the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and inducing Nrf2 nuclear translocation with enhanced HO-1 and NQO1
expressions. Additionally, treatment with SEI remarkably promoted the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax
and inhibited the expressions of cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 9. These results suggest
that the neuroprotective mechanisms of SEI are associated with its anti-oxidation and
anti-apoptosis properties.

Introduction

Stroke is one of the most serious cerebrovascular diseases,
leading to signiﬁcant mortality and morbidity worldwide
(Donnan et al., 2008; Mandel et al., 2012). Despite the advanced
intravascular procedures, the most commonly used treatment
currently for ischemic stroke is the administration of chemical
drugs, including thrombolytic agents, tissue-plasminogen activator and calcium ion antagonists (Ginsberg, 2008). However,
the short time window for patients, as well as the frequent side
effects of the drugs, seems to constraint their clinical efﬁcacy,
especially for long-term use (Goldstein and Rothwell, 2008).
Strokes are mostly caused by transient cerebral ischemia
induced by obstruction of blood ﬂow to the brain, causing the
disturbance in the energy metabolism and leading to the
excessive formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), ultimately
resulting in oxidative stress (Chan, 2004; Uzar et al., 2012).
Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription
factor, is considered as an important cytoprotective regulator
against oxidative stress. The activation of Nrf2 can up-regulate
the expression of several antioxidant enzymes and phase II
detoxifying enzymes, such as hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), superoxide dismutase1 (SOD1), glutathione S-transferase (GSTs) and
quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), after binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) (Liu et al., 2004; Shah et al., 2007).
Furthermore, extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) activates Nrf2 under oxidative conditions (Zipper and Mulcahy,
2003). Accumulative evidence has revealed that ROS produced
during ischemia not only contribute to oxidative damage, but
also activate apoptotic cascades by disrupting mitochondrial
function (Chan et al., 1998).
Senkyunolide I (SEI, Fig. 1A) is derived from the Chinese
herb Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort., which has been widely used
for the treatment of apoplexy and migraine in China (Jia et al.,
2009). SEI could protect cultured PC12 cells and human liver
HepG2 cells from oxidative damage induced by hydrogen
peroxide (Qi et al., 2010; Tang et al., 2009). SEI also slightly

reversed morphological changes of red blood cells induced by
concanavalin A (Hong et al., 2003). Our previous research showed
that SEI was a major constituent detected simultaneously in
plasma and cerebrospinal ﬂuid in the rat migraine model. Moreover, SEI was rapidly absorbed and penetrated through blood–
brain barrier, as well as the blood- cerebrospinal ﬂuid barrier
(Yuan et al., 2010). Subsequently, a pharmacodynamic study of
SEI demonstrated its anti-migraine effect (Wang et al., 2011),
although the exact mechanism was unknown. Intriguingly, SEI is
a primary metabolite of Z-ligustilide (Fig. 1B), which protects
against cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury in vivo and in vitro
by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway (Peng et al., 2013). Despite
its better stability and bioavailability compared with Z-ligustilide
(Yan et al., 2008), no information is available with respect to the
possible neuroprotective effect of SEI on cerebral I/R injury.
Herein, the aim of present study was to evaluate the
potential protective effect of SEI on focal cerebral I/R injury
following 2 h of occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA)
and 24 h reperfusion in rats, and to investigate whether the
therapeutic beneﬁts of SEI were associated with anti-oxidation
and anti-apoptosis.

Results

2.1.

Senkyunolide I improved neurological deﬁcits

Neurological deﬁcit was examined and scored on a 6-point
scale 24 h after reperfusion. As shown in Fig. 2A, rats in
Vehicle group got higher scores than in Sham group. Compared with Vehicle group, the scores were signiﬁcantly
reduced in SEI-H group (Po0.05). By contrast, there was also
alleviation in motor function in SEI-L group, but without a
signiﬁcant level (P40.05).

Senkyunolide I attenuated brain edema

Brain water contents in ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres were shown in Fig. 2B. In Sham group, brain water
content in ipsilateral was 78.37%70.37%, while it increased to
86.12%71.67% after 24 h reperfusion following 2 h MCAO in
Vehicle group. The two doses of SEI attenuated brain edema in
ipsilateral hemisphere. The brain water content was markedly
reduced in SEI-H group compared with Vehicle group (SEI-H:
82.30%70.91%, Po0.05). But no signiﬁcant decrease was found
in SEI-L group (SEI-L: 85.35%71.29%, P40.05).

behavior scores were signiﬁcantly reduced in SEI-H group compared with that in Vehicle group (★Po0.05 Mann–Whitney test), but
there was no signiﬁcant difference between SEI-L group and Vehicle group. (B) Senkyunolide I attenuated brain edema. The brain
water content of ipsilateral hemispheres was signiﬁcantly decreased in SEI-H group vs. Vehicle group (★Po0.05), whereas no
signiﬁcant difference was observed between SEI-L group and Vehicle group. (C) Representative images of brain slices stained by TTC.
No infarction (the white region) was observed in Sham group, while extensive lesion was obvious in other groups. (D) Senkyunolide I
reduced infarct volume. The %HLV were signiﬁcantly lower in SEI-L group (★Po0.05) and SEI-H group (★Po0.05) than in Vehicle group.

2.3.

Senkyunolide I reduced infarct volume

No infarction was observed in sham operated group, while
extensive lesion was developed in striatum and lateral cortex
in Vehicle group (Fig. 2C). Compared with Vehicle group, the
infarct volume was signiﬁcantly reduced in both SEI-L (42.20%
78.62% vs. 35.70%75.35%) and SEI-H groups (42.20%78.62%
vs. 27.31%72.40%) (P40.05) (Fig. 2D).

2.4.
Senkyunolide I recovered neuronal morphologic
damages
The histopathological changes in rats’ cerebral cortices and
hippocampus were evaluated after 24 h reperfusion following
2 h MCAO with HE staining. As shown in Fig. 3, the pyramidal
neurons in Sham group were tightly aligned with distinct
nucleoli and moderate size. And those in Vehicle group exhibited obvious pathological abnormalities with loosed arranged
neurons, pycnotic nucleus and loss or dark color staining. By
contrast, these histopathological alterations was dramatically
reduced by SEI at the high dose, while a slighter reduction in
cortical neuron damage by SEI was observed at the low dose.

2.5.
Senkyunolide I inﬂuenced the biochemical indexes in
rats with I/R injury
As shown in Fig. 4A, the MDA level of Vehicle group rats was
enhanced to 4.0971.77 nmol/mg protein compared with that of

Sham group 2.0670.08 nmol/mg protein. In contrast to I/R
group, the treatment with both low and high dose of SEI
(36 mg/kg and 72 mg/kg) could diminish the MDA contents
signiﬁcantly (Po0.05 vs. Vehicle group). Meanwhile, lower activities of SOD were detected in Vehicle group (74.66714.51 U/mg
protein) compared with that of Sham group (120.98715.66 U/mg
protein) from the data in Fig. 4B. Treatment with SEI (36 mg/kg
and 72 mg/kg) could improve the enzymatic activities of SOD
obviously (Po0.05 vs. Vehicle group). There were no signiﬁcant
differences between these two SEI groups on MDA and SOD
levels.

2.6.
Senkyunolide I promoted p-Erk1/2/t-Erk1/2, c-Nrf2,
n-Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1 expressions
We utilized reporter gene technique to investigate the potential
inﬂuence of SEI on Nrf2/ARE pathway by measuring the luciferase activity regulated by ARE in vitro. As shown in Fig. 5A, the
positive compound (5 μM DL-sulforaphane) and various concentrations (25–100 μM) of SEI exerted no signiﬁcant impact on cell
viability and LDH leakage compared with Controls (P40.05). The
ﬂuorescence intensities of the cells were obviously enhanced in
positive group (C) and SEI groups at the concentrations of 50 μM
(E) and 100 μM (F) compared with that of control group (B). The
data from Fig. 5G demonstrated that treatment with SEI could
improve the luciferase activity in a concentration-dependent
manner within a certain range. And a signiﬁcant difference was
observed between 100 μM SEI group and control group (Po0.05).

Fig. 3 – Effect of senkyunolide I on cerebral cortical and hippocampal histopathology in rats after focal cerebral I/R injury with
H&E staining. The representative photomicrographs of cortices and hippocampus from Sham (A, a), Vehicle (B, b), SEI-L (36 mg/
kg) (C, c) and SEI-H (72 mg/kg) (D, d) groups were established. Signiﬁcant reversal of injury was observed in SEI-H group (D, d).
The magniﬁcation was 400  and 200  in cortical and hippocampal photomicrographs respectively and bar¼ 50 μm.

Western blotting analysis was further conducted to investigate the possible effect of SEI on Erk/Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway.
The results showed that the protein levels of c-Nrf2, n-Nrf2 and
NQO1 were increased after I/R injury, while the expressions of pErk1/2/t-Erk1/2 and HO-1 were decreased. Meanwhile, the ratio of
p-Erk1/2/t-Erk1/2 and the expressions of c-Nrf2, n-Nrf2, HO-1 and
NQO1 were remarkably increased in both SEI-L and SEI-H groups
(Po0.05), and SEI-H group got a higher level than SEI-L (Po0.05,
Fig. 6A–C). The ratio of n-Nrf2/c-Nrf2 was promoted by both dose

of SEI (Po0.05) and high dose raised it to a higher level (Po0.05)
(Fig. 6F).

2.7.
Senkyunolide I regulated the expressions of Bcl-2,
Bax and cleaved caspase 3, caspase 9
In this study, the expression changes of Bcl-2 and Bax were
detected. Compared with Sham group, I/R injury decreased
the expression of Bcl-2 and increased the expression of Bax.

Fig. 4 – Effect of senkyunolide I on levels of MDA (A) and SOD
(B) in rats with MCAO-induced cerebral I/R injury. Compared
with Vehicle group, the contents of MDA were signiﬁcantly
decreased in SEI-L group and SEI-H group (★Po0.05), and the
activities of SOD were signiﬁcantly increased in two SEI
groups (★Po0.05). No signiﬁcant differences were observed
between two SEI groups on MDA and SOD levels.

However, administration of SEI (36 mg/kg and 72 mg/kg)
signiﬁcantly reversed the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and the
up-regulation of Bax (Po0.05, Fig. 6D). Moreover, treatment
with high dosage of SEI more effectively down-regulated Bax
protein level than that of SEI-L group (Po0.05). Thus, both
SEI-L group and SEI-H group markedly elevated the ratio of
Bcl-2/Bax (Po0.05, Fig. 6F).
In addition, the expressions of cleaved caspase-3 and
caspase-9 were also examined. Fig. 6E showed that the
protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9 were both
promoted in Vehicle group compared with Sham group.
Administration of SEI (36 mg/kg and 72 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly
down-regulated cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9 protein
expressions (Po0.05). However, there were no signiﬁcant
differences between SEI-L group and SEI-H group (P40.05).

Discussion

Phthalides, a group of important components present in L.
chuanxiong Hort., possess distinct biological activities, such as
anti-migraine, anti-platelet aggregation and anti-thrombosis
effects, and have actions on the central nervous system and
cardiac function modulation, inhibition of smooth muscle cell
proliferation and protection against cerebral ischemia. Among
these phthalides, the cerebral protective effect and the

43

underlying mechanism of butylphthalide and Z-ligustilide have
been widely studied (Liu et al., 2007; Peng et al., 2013). SEI, a
metabolite of Z-ligustilide (Yan et al., 2008) with better solubility
and stability, higher bioavailability and faster penetration of
blood–brain-barrier, has not been studied extensively concerning
its actions on cerebral diseases, although some cellular studies
have suggested SEI’ s protective effects (Qi et al., 2010; Hong et al.,
2003). The present investigation demonstrated the beneﬁcial
effects of SEI on I/R injury in rats induced by tMCAO for 2 h
and reperfusion for 24 h, for the ﬁrst time. The intravenous
administration of SEI 15 min after MCAO could reduce neurological scores, lessen brain water content and infarct volume, and
recover the neural structure.
Oxidative stress is the main pathogenesis involved in brain
injury caused by reduced cerebral blood ﬂow with subsequent
reperfusion. In vivo, endogenous antioxidant enzymes like
SOD, GSH-PX and GSH can scavenge normal amounts of ROS
(Keller et al., 1998). Nevertheless, excess ROS damage lipids,
generating cytotoxic MDA via lipid peroxidation, which sometimes induces cross-linked polymerization of macromolecules,
such as proteins and nucleic acids (Schettler et al., 1999). Our
results showed decreased formation of MDA as well as elevated
activities of SOD in SEI-treated groups, suggesting that SEI could
attenuate oxidative stress via simultaneous up-regulation of
defense enzymes and reductions in lipid peroxidation.
Nrf2, a cap ‘n’ collar (CNC) transcription factor, is a vital
endogenous regulator in neuronal anti-oxidative stress defense
responses (Zhao et al., 2011). In normal non-activated conditions, Nrf2 interacts with Kelch like ECH-associated protein1
(Keap 1). Upon activation, Nrf2 separates from Keap 1, translocates into the nucleus and binds to a speciﬁc sequence in a
promoter termed ARE, coordinately up-regulating the expressions of several antioxidant and detoxiﬁcation genes, including
HO-1, SOD, GST and NQO1 (Kensler et al., 2007). Thus, the Nrf2/
ARE pathway may represent a potential therapeutic target for
neuroprotection. Based on the importance of the Nrf2/ARE
pathway, we preliminarily employed a reporter gene technique
to explore the relationship between SEI’s anti-oxidative effect
and the Nrf2/ARE pathway in vitro. Brieﬂy, a recombinant
plasmid vector pGF1-ARE-Neo was constructed to express
reporter gene luciferase regulated by the promoter ARE, which
was then transfected into Hek293T cells (human embryonic
kidney epithelial cells). The ﬂuorescence produced, accompanied by oxidation of luciferin to oxyluciferin by luciferase,
indicated the biological interaction of Nrf2 and ARE. Our
ﬁndings showed that incubation with SEI at a certain concentration could enhance the ﬂuorescence intensity, indicating
that SEI exerts anti-oxidative stress effect by activation of
Nrf2/ARE pathway. In accordance with the result above, administration of SEI signiﬁcantly increased the expressions of cytoplasmic Nrf2 and nuclear Nrf2, and the ratio of n-Nrf2/c-Nrf2
was increased with the increasing of the dose. In addition, the
expressions of downstream genes, including HO-1 and NQO1
were up-regulated as well. Here we suspected that SEI could upregulate Nrf2’s expression and further promote its nuclear
translocation in cerebral ischemic rats. Despite the molecular
mechanism of activation of SEI on Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway
was under investigation, these ﬁndings provided evidence that
the protective effect of SEI against I/R injury was mediated by
activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway.

Fig. 5 – Effect of senkyunolide I on luciferase activities regulated by Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway. (A) The MTT assay and LDH
leakage assay demonstrated that treatment with 5 μM DL-sulforaphane and various concentrations of SEI (25–100 μM) led to no
signiﬁcant decrease in the viability of cells (% of control) (n ¼ 6, P40.05). The representative ﬂuorescence micrographs of HEK
293T/pGF1-ARE from Control (B), Positive (5 μM DL-sulforaphane-treated) (C), 25 μM SEI-treated (D), 50 μM SEI-treated (E) and
100 μM SEI-treated (F) groups were established. The ﬂuorescence intensities were obviously enhanced in Positive group,
50 μm SEI-treated group and 100 μm SEI-treated group compared with Control group. The subsequent quantitative
determination of luciferase activity (G) further proved the antioxidation of DL-sulforaphane (★Po0.05) and indicated that
treatment with SEI could improve the luciferase activity in a concentration-dependent manner within a certain range.
A signiﬁcant difference was observed between 100 μM SEI-treated group and Control group (★Po0.05).
To date, many studies have demonstrated that activation/
phosphorylation of Erk1/2 contributes to cellular proliferation
and differentiation, morphology maintenance, inhibition of
cell apoptosis and resistance to oxidative stress, despite a few
conﬂicting views (Runden et al., 1998). With regard to oxidative stress induced lesions, the Erk1/2 signaling pathway is
thought to exert a cytoprotective effect, especially in cerebral
tissues (Li et al., 2013). Consistent with above observations,
the present study showed that SEI apparently induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2. Given that p-Erk contributes to the
activation of Nrf2 under conditions of oxidative stress and
neurotoxic injury (Wang et al., 2012), we speculated that the
Erk pathway might be, at least partially, involved in the
antioxidant effects of SEI by activating Nrf2/ARE pathway.
Although the exact mechanism underlying focal cerebral
I/R injury is not clear, neuronal cell death mainly occurs by
necrosis, and apoptosis is a noticeable feature of almost all
neurodegenerative diseases (Yuan et al., 2003). Among many
proteins involved in cell apoptosis, the anti-apoptotic protein
Bcl-2 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax both regulate the
release of cytochrome C, which activates caspase 3 and the
caspase cascades, ultimately causing apoptosis (Benchoua
et al., 2001). Caspase activation is the ﬁnal process of the
death signaling pathway, in which pro-caspase 3 is activated
into cleaved caspase 3 following the autoactivation of procaspase 9 to cleaved caspase 9 (Nagata, 1997). Here, we showed
down-regulation of Bax, cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 9 and
up-regulation of Bcl-2 in ischemic brains after SEI treatment,
indicating an anti-apoptotic effect of SEI on I/R injury.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated the protective
effects of SEI against focal cerebral I/R injury and provided

further insight into its anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic
mechanisms. Further studies focusing on the establishment
of cellular model simulating I/R injury in vivo and exploration
of other potential involved signaling pathways are required.

Experimental procedures

4.1.

Animals

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) were purchased from the
Laboratory Animal Center of Shanghai University of Traditional
Chinese Medicine. Procedures were performed according to the
guidelines of the National Institutes of Health Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the
local Committee of the Experimental Animal Administration.
Free access to forage and drinking water was allowed. Controlled conditions were implemented (12/12 h light/dark cycle
with room temperature of 2572 1C and room relative humidity
of 50710%).

4.2.

Cerebral ischemia–reperfusion model

Transient focal cerebral ischemia rats were prepared as previously described (Kuller, 1989). In brief, animals were anesthetized by intra-peritoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium
(50 mg/kg). Rectal temperature was maintained at 37 1C using
a heating pad. After a median incision of the neck skin, the
right common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA)
and internal carotid artery (ICA) were exposed and isolated
carefully. Occlusion of the right side MCA (MCAO) was achieved

Fig. 6 – Effect of senkyunolide I on the protein levels of p-Erk1/2, t-Erk1/2, c-Nrf2, n-Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, Bcl-2, Bax, caspase 3 and
caspase 9 in brains with MCAO-induced I/R injury. Representative photographs of Western blots and quantitative analysis of
the proteins were presented. (A) The p-Erk1/2/t-Erk1/2 was signiﬁcantly increased in SEI-L group and SEI-H group compared
with Vehicle group (★Po0.05), while the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 reached a higher level in SEI-H group (▲Po0.05). (B) The
protein levels of c-Nrf2 and n-Nrf2 were apparently promoted in SEI-L and SEI-H groups compared with Vehicle group
(★Po0.05). SEI-H group further enhanced n-Nrf2 expression signiﬁcantly (▲Po0.05). (C) Compared with Vehicle group,
signiﬁcant differences on HO-1 and NQO1 protein levels were observed in both SEI-L and SEI-H groups (★Po0.05), and SEI-H
group got higher levels than SEI-L group (▲Po0.05). (D) The administration of SEI at two dosages could signiﬁcantly reverse the
down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax induced by I/R injury (★Po0.05). High does group got a better effect on Bax
expression (▲Po0.05). (E) The expressions of cleaved caspase 3 and caspase 9 were markedly reduced in SEI-L group and SEI-H
group respectively (★Po0.05). Between these two does groups, no signiﬁcant differences were observed. (F) The ratios of nNrf2/c-Nrf2 and Bcl-2/Bax were elevated to higher levels in both SEI-L and SEI-H groups compared with Vehicle group
(★Po0.05), and high dose of SEI acted more effectively (▲Po0.05).

by inserting a monoﬁlament nylon ﬁlament into the ICA
through an incision in the ECA, and the tip of the ﬁlament
was advanced to the origin of the MCA. The surgical wound
was closed and the rat was allowed to recover from the
anesthesia. Reperfusion was started after 2 h of MCAO by
withdrawing the ﬁlament. Sham-operated rats received the
same surgery without inserting the ﬁlament. During the experiments, MCA blood ﬂow was monitored using a Laser Doppler
Flowmetry (Moor Lab, Moor Instruments Ltd, UK). A drop in rate
of cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) was expressed as a percentage of
the baseline value and rCBF more than 85% was excluded.

4.3.

Groups and drug administration

Four groups of rats were included: the sham-operated group
(Sham), in which rats received sham operation; the vehicle
group (Vehicle), in which rats received tMCAO and an equal
volume of saline; the SEI groups (SEI-L and SEI-H), in which
rats received tMCAO and were given SEI (36 mg/kg and 72 mg/
kg, respectively, dissolved in saline) intravenously 15 min
after occlusion. SEI was separated and puriﬁed from L.
chuanxiong Hort. 1H NMR, 13C NMR, MS identiﬁed the structure
of SEI and the purity was above 98%.

Neurological function assessment

A neurological test was performed after reperfusion for 24 h
in a blinded fashion (n¼ 10), based on a modiﬁed scoring
system developed by Longa et al. (1989) as follows: 0 ¼no
deﬁcit; 1 ¼difﬁculty in fully extending the contralateral forelimb; 2¼ unable to extend the contralateral forelimb; 3¼ mild
circling to the contralateral side; 4 ¼ severe circling; and
5¼ falling to the contralateral side. The higher the neurological deﬁcit score, the more severe impairment of motor
motion injury.

4.5.

Measurement of brain water content

Brain water content was measured after neurological function
assessment, using the standard wet-dry method (Hatashita
et al., 1988). Rats were reanesthetized and sacriﬁced by decapitation (n¼ 6). The cerebral ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres were removed quickly and packaged with pre-weighed
tin foil, respectively. The packed hemispheres were immediately weighed to obtain wet weight and then dried for 24 h
at 105 1C to obtain the dry weight. Brain water content was
calculated as [(wet weight dry weight)/wet weight]  100%.

Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s media (DMEM, containing 4.5 g/L
D-glucose and 2 mM L-glutamine), supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). Prior to reporter
gene activity detection, MTT assay and LDH leakage assay
were conducted to evaluate cytotoxicities of positive compound (5 μM DL-sulforaphane) and various concentrations (25–
100 μM) of SEI (n¼6). Non-treated cells served as controls.
The cells were seeded onto 24-well plate at 5  105/well
(n ¼4 per group) and compounds were added into each well,
followed by overnight incubation, after which the microscopical photos were obtained with a laser scanning confocal
microscope (Leica SP2, Leica Microsystems CMS GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Subsequently, the cells were lysed, and the
relative ﬂuorescence intensity of the cell lysate were recorded
according to previously described procedures (Brovko et al.,
1994) and the total protein in each well was measured by BCA
Protein Assay kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology,
China). The luciferase activity of cell lysate was expressed
as relative ﬂuorescence intensity per milligram total protein
(RFI/mg protein).

Measurement of infarct volume
4.10.

Infarct volume was measured 24 h after the start of reperfusion.
Rats were reanesthetized and the brains were removed quickly
(n¼ 6 per group). Coronal brain slices (about 2 mm thick) were
stained with TTC at 37 1C for 20 min (Bederson et al., 1986),
followed by ﬁxation with 4% paraformaldehyde. The stained
sections were photographed and analyzed using Image Pro-Plus
5.1 analysis software (Media Cybernetics Inc. Rockville, Maryland, US). To compensate for the effect of brain edema, the
percentage of infarct volume was calculated as follows, {[total
infarct volume(the volume of intact ipsilateral hemisphere the volume of intact contralateral hemisphere)]/contralateral hemisphere volume}  100%.

Histopathology

After 24 h of reperfusion following 2 h tMCAO, rats were
reanesthetized and perfused with 100 mL precooled normal
saline and subsequently with 250 mL precooled 4% paraformaldehyde. Brain cortices and hippocampus were removed
quickly and then post-ﬁxed for 24 h in the 4% paraformaldehyde (n¼ 6). The tissues were dehydrated in graded ethanol,
cleared in xylene, embedded in parafﬁn wax and cut coronally at 5 μm. The sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) for histopathological observation.

Detection of reporter gene activity

Determination of MDA, and SOD levels

Cortical tissues were collected after 24 h reperfusion and homogenized to obtain supernatant after centrifugation (n¼6 per
group). The contents of MDA and the enzymatic activities of
SOD were measured using assay kits, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Nanjing Jian Chen Bioengineering Institute).

Western blot

Following the neurological function assessment, rats were
randomly chosen for decapitation under anesthesia (n¼ 6 per
group). Total protein extraction and cytoplasmic/nuclear protein extraction were obtained using ice-cold RIPA and Nuclear
and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit containing protease
inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Beyotime
Institute of Biotechnology, China). The protein concentration of
the supernatant was measured by BCA assay. Equal amounts of
proteins per lane were separated by SDS/PAGE and transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5% nonfat
dry milk in TBST, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 1C
with primary antibodies of p-Erk1/2 (1:2000, Cell Signaling
Technology Inc, Beverly, MA, USA), Erk1/2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling
Technology Inc), Nrf2 (1:500, Abcam Inc, Cambridge, UK), HO-1
(1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology Inc), NQO1 (1:500, Cell Signaling Technology Inc), Bcl-2 (1:500, Abcam Inc), Bax (1:1000,
Abcam Inc), caspase-3 (1:1000, Abcam Inc) and caspase-9
(1:1000, Abcam Inc). Antibodies against β-actin (1:5000, Cell
Signaling Technology Inc) and Lamin B1 (1:10,000, Proteintech,
US) were used as internal controls of cytoplasmic and nuclear
protein, respectively. On the second day, membranes loaded
with primary antibodies were washed and incubated with HRP
conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:10,000;
goat anti-mouse IgG, 1:10,000, Abcam Inc) for 1 h at room
temperature. The bands were scanned and the relative density
of each band was analyzed by using the Image Pro-Plus 5.1
analysis software.

4.11.

Statistical analysis

For neurological deﬁcit scores, Mann–Whitney U test was
used for comparisons between two groups. The other data

brain research 1605 (2015) 39–48

were analyzed by One-way ANOVA and followed by StudentNewman–Keuls test for intergroup comparisons. Data were
expressed as mean7SD. All statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 16.0 software and Po0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.
