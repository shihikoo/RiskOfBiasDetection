Editor’s key points

† In a rat model of focal
cerebral ischaemia,
sevoflurane
preconditioning reduced
infarct size and
neurological dysfunction.
† The protective effect
involved preservation of
Akt signalling by
down-regulation of an
endogenous inhibitor.
† Identification of this
inhibitor reveals a novel
target for neuroprotective
drugs.

Methods. Male Sprague –Dawley rats were exposed to 2.7% sevoflurane for 45 min. One hour
later, rats were subjected to 60 min of focal cerebral ischaemia. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase
inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 were administered 10 min before preconditioning. Rats
in the lentiviral transduction group received an intracerebroventricular injection of lentiviral
vector Ubi-MCS-CTMP 3 days before ischaemia. Neurological deficits and infarct volumes
were evaluated 24 h and 7 days after reperfusion. Phosphorylation of Akt, glycogen
synthase kinase-3b (GSK3b), and expression of CTMP were determined at 1, 3, 12, and 24 h
after reperfusion. Akt activity was measured at 3 h after reperfusion.
Results. Sevoflurane preconditioning improved neurological score and reduced infarct
size at 24 h of reperfusion. Pretreatment with wortmannin or LY294002 attenuated these
neuroprotective effects. Expression of CTMP correlated with reduced Akt activity after
ischaemia, while sevoflurane preconditioning preserved Akt activity and increased
phosphorylation of GSK3b. CTMP over-expression diminished the beneficial effects of
sevoflurane preconditioning.
Conclusions. Activation of Akt signalling via inhibition of CTMP is involved in the mechanism of
neuroprotection provided by sevoflurane preconditioning.

More than 2 million major surgical operations are performed
every year worldwide, with increasing frequency of reported perioperative cerebral ischaemia.1 Preconditioning with anaesthetics against ischaemic neuronal injury is effective in vitro
and in vivo. 2 – 4 With few clinical side-effects, the commonly
used volatile anaesthetic sevoflurane has received increasing attention in this domain.5 – 8 Neuroprotective strategies such as ischaemic preconditioning and other neuroprotective strategies
promote neuronal survival by activating the protein kinase
Akt.9 – 13 Upon activation, Akt phosphorylates/inactivates downstream targets such as GSK3b implicated in both caspasedependent and -independent mechanisms of cell death.12 – 15
Carboxy-terminal modulator protein (CTMP), a novel Akt
binding protein,16 binds to the carboxyl-terminal regulatory
†

domain of Akt at the plasma membrane, and thereby negatively
regulates the activity of Akt by inhibiting phosphorylation on
serine 473 and threonine 308.16 During global cerebral ischaemic
injury, CTMP is highly up-regulated and reduces Akt signalling,17
thus contributing to ischaemic neuronal death. The present
study tested the hypotheses that sevoflurane preconditioning
inhibits expression of CTMP triggered by ischaemia, thereby preserving the activity of Akt and decreasing infarct volume.

† The mechanisms by which
sevoflurane
preconditioning protects
against cerebral
ischaemia are unclear.

Background. Sevoflurane preconditioning has a neuroprotective effect, but the underlying
mechanism is not fully understood. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate
whether sevoflurane-induced cerebral preconditioning involves inhibition of carboxyterminal modulator protein (CTMP), an endogenous inhibitor of Akt, in a rat model of focal
cerebral ischaemia.

Experimental protocols
Experiment I

Experiment II
To investigate the role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
pathways in the induction of ischaemic tolerance by sevoflurane preconditioning, we randomly assigned 80 rats to eight
groups: I/R, PC+I/R, sevoflurane preconditioning with PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (WT+PC+I/R), sevoflurane preconditioning with PI3 inhibitor LY294002 (LY+PC+I/R), ischaemia with
wortmannin (WT+I/R), ischaemia with LY294002 (LY+I/R),
and two vehicle (VE-WT+PC+I/R and VE-LY+PC+I/R) groups.

To examine the effect of CTMP in sevoflurane preconditioning
and I/R, we used lentiviral transduction (LV) to augment expression of CTMP before preconditioning. Rats received an
intracerebroventricular (5 ml) injection of either LV-CTMP or
LV-C (scrambled control vector) 3 days before preconditioning.
After 24 h of reperfusion, animals were evaluated for neurological scores and then killed to determine infarct volume
(n¼7) (Fig. 1C). Validation for lentiviral transduction was
carried out at 72 h after intracerebroventricular injection by
determining the expression of CTMP by immunoblotting and
Akt activity with a kinase assay kit (Cell Signalling Technology,
Beverly, MA, USA) in rats without MCAO (n¼3).

Sevoflurane preconditioning
Sevoflurane preconditioning was performed as previously
described, with some modifications.6 Briefly, preconditioned
animals were exposed to 2.7% sevoflurane (Baxter Healthcare
Corporation, Chicago, IL, USA) in 97% oxygen for 45 min in a
chamber. Concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and sevoflurane were continuously monitored (MP-60, Phillips Medical
Systems, Best, The Netherlands). Control group rats were
treated for the same duration with 97% oxygen only.

MCAO model
MCAO was performed as previously described.6 20 Briefly, after
rats were anaesthetized with 3.0% sevoflurane, transient focal
cerebral ischaemia was induced by occlusion of the right
middle cerebral artery using an intraluminal 0.38 mm diameter

To investigate the neuroprotective effect of sevoflurane preconditioning against focal cerebral ischaemia, rats were
divided into four groups: sham operation (Sham), cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R), sevoflurane preconditioning (PC),
and preconditioning followed by cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion (PC+I/R) groups (n¼7 each). Preconditioned animals
were exposed to 2.7% sevoflurane for 45 min at 1 h before ischaemia.6 Focal cerebral ischaemia was induced by middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Neurological deficits and
infarct volumes were evaluated at 24 h and 7 days after
reperfusion (Fig. 1A).
To determine the effect of sevoflurane preconditioning on
the phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream target GSK3b,
and also changes in CTMP levels after ischaemia, rats in the
PC group were killed 24 h after preconditioning. Rats in the I/
R and PC+I/R groups were killed at 1, 3, 12, and 24 h after reperfusion (n¼5 each). Akt activity was determined 3 h after reperfusion (n¼4).

USA) were administered 10 min before preconditioning
(Fig. 1B). Wortmannin (0.6 mg kg21 in saline) or its vehicle
was administered via tail vein;18 LY294002 (25 mg in 5 ml 1%
DMSO) or its vehicle was administered intracerebroventricularly (coordinates: 0.8 mm anteroposterior, 1.5 mm lateral to
bregma, and 3.5 mm in deep).19

nylon monofilament suture (Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co. Ltd,
Beijing, China). After 60 min of occlusion, the monofilament
was removed to allow reperfusion. The left femoral artery
was cannulated to monitor arterial pressure and to draw
blood samples for gas determination (Rapidlab 1260, Bayer
HealthCare, Uxbridge, UK) at the beginning of ischaemia and
at the onset of reperfusion. Regional cerebral blood flow
(rCBF) was measured by a laser-Doppler computerized main
unit (PeriFlux 5000, Perimed AB, Stockholm, Sweden) with a disposable microtip fibreoptic probe placed on the skull (6 mm
lateral and 1 mm posterior to bregma). If rCBF sharply
decreased by more than 70% of the baseline (pre-ischaemia)
after MCAO and was rapidly restored during reperfusion
(in 20 min), the model was considered technically successful.
During the surgical procedure, systemic temperature was monitored with a rectal probe and maintained at 37.0 (0.58C).

Neurological dysfunction was evaluated according to an
18-point scoring system21 by an investigator who was blinded
to the animal grouping. To evaluate infarct volume, animals
were killed for 2,3,5-triphenyltertrazolium chloride (TTC,
Sigma-Aldrich) staining as described.2 Infarct volume was calculated using Swanson’s method: (contralateral hemisphere
volume2ipsilateral hemisphere volume)/contralateral hemisphere volume×100%.22

Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was performed with a routine protocol.23
Briefly, brain tissue from the ischaemic penumbra as defined
by the Ashwal and colleagues24 method was quickly isolated
and snap-frozen. Protein was extracted using RIPA lysis
buffer (Beyotime, Nantong, China). Polyacrylamide–SDS gels
with an equal amount of protein (40 mg) loaded in each lane
were electrophoresed, and the proteins transferred to a PVDF
membrane. After incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin
in Tris-buffered saline solution with 0.05%Tween-20 for 1 h at
48C, the membrane was probed with primary antibodies (Cell
Signalling Technology): rabbit anti-pAkt Ser473 or Thr308 antibodies (1:1000 for both), rabbit anti-Akt antibody (1:2000),
rabbit anti-PGSK3b Ser9 antibody (1:1000), rabbit anti-GSK3b
antibody (1:2000), or rabbit anti-CTMP antibody (1:500). After
rinsing, membranes were probed with HRP-conjugated antirabbit antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive
bands were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK) and
quantified with Bio-Rad Quantity One software (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA).

Akt activity assays
In vitro Akt kinase assays were performed with an Akt kinase
assay kit as described.25 In brief, brain tissue from the ischaemic penumbra (100 –120 mg) was homogenized in seven
volumes of cell lysis buffer. After centrifugation at 14 000g for
10 min at 48C, the supernatant (whole-cell extract) was
taken for the kinase assay. For immunoprecipitation with

Lentivirus-based over-expression of CTMP
Transfection of the CTMP over-expression lentiviral vector
Ubi-MCS-CTMP was performed as described.26 The complete
rat cDNA sequence of CTMP was generated by PCR and inserted
into the Ubi-MCS-3FLAG Vector (GeneChem, Shanghai, China),
linearized with AgeI and NheI. Expression of the resulting 28
kDa protein was confirmed by immunoblotting analysis. The
lentiviral vector was produced by co-transfection into HEK
293T-cells with a helper construct. Titers of 2×109 IU ml21
were routinely achieved.

Statistical analysis
All data, except neurological scores, are expressed as mean
(SD). Neurological scores were expressed by median (range)
and analysed using the non-parametric Mann –Whitney test
in experiment I or the Kruskal –Wallis test followed by Dunn’s
post hoc test in other experiments. Infarct volumes in experiment I were analysed using a two-tailed t-test. Other experiments were analysed using repeated-measures one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post hoc test. Arterial
pressures and blood gases were analysed by a two-way ANOVA
analysis, followed by the Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons. Data analyses were performed with the GraphPad Prism
(Version 6, GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Statistical significance was defined as P,0.05.

Results
Physiological variables were normal and equivalent in all study
groups (Supplementary Tables S1–S3). Rats with inadequate
rCBF decrease in the MCAO model or that died before the observation time point were excluded.

Sevoflurane preconditioning induced neuroprotection
Sevoflurane preconditioning significantly ameliorated neurological dysfunction induced by MCAO at 24 h after ischaemia
[P,0.05, 13.0 (9, 15) vs 9.0 (6, 11), Fig. 2A]. Infarct volume of
rats in the PC+I/R group was smaller than that in the I/R
group at both 24 h and 7 days after ischaemia [P,0.01, 23
(6)% vs 36 (8)% at 24 h; P,0.01, 27 (6)% vs 41 (9)% at 7 days,
Fig. 2B and C]. Sevoflurane preconditioning reduced infarct
volume nearly 13% compared with animals without
preconditioning.

Neurobehavioural evaluation and infarct assessment

immobilized Akt primary antibody, cell lysate (200 ml, 150 mg
of protein) and 20 ml of immobilized antibody bead slurry
were incubated with gentle rocking overnight at 48C. To
confirm that each group had the same amount of extraction,
the upper solution (solution I) was saved for GAPDH detection
by immunoblotting after centrifugation at 14 000g for 30 s at
48C. The pellet was washed twice with cell lysis buffer and
kinase buffer on ice, and then incubated with 50 ml of kinase
buffer supplemented with 1 ml of 10 mM ATP and 1 mg of
GSK3 fusion protein for 30 min at 308C. To terminate the reaction,
25 ml 3×SDS sample buffer was added. After centrifugation for
30 s at 14 000g, the supernatant was taken for immunoblotting
detection of phosphorylated GSK3 fusion protein.

Sevoflurane preconditioning prevented the decrease
in Akt activity and GSK3b phosphorylation and the
increase in CTMP induced by ischaemia
Ischaemia induced a transient increase in the phosphorylation
of Akt at Ser473 (Ser473-Akt), which peaked at 3 h after reperfusion [P,0.01 vs sham, 250 (40)% at 1 h, and 330 (58)% at 3 h
after reperfusion, Fig. 3A] and declined to basal levels 24 h after
reperfusion [P.0.05 vs sham, 110 (44)% at 24 h after reperfusion, Fig. 3A]. Phosphorylation of GSK3b (pSer9-GSK3b), a
downstream target of Akt, was higher in the PC+I/R group
than in the I/R group at 1 and 3 h after reperfusion [P,0.05,
190 (33)% vs 1120 (30)% at 1 h; P,0.01, 150 (24)% vs 60
(44)% at 3 h, Fig. 4B]. Phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3b were
increased at 3 h after sevoflurane treatment compared with
the sham group [P,0.05, 190 (16)% for Ser473-Akt; P,0.05,
160 (21)% for Ser9-GSK3b, Fig. 4A and B].
Akt kinase activity assay showed that sevoflurane preconditioning increased Akt activity 3 h after reperfusion compared
with the I/R group [P,0.01, 200 (47)% vs 81 (33)%, Fig. 3D], parallel to increased pSer9-GSK3b in vivo. No significant differences
were found between the Sham and I/R groups. When rats were
subjected to ischaemia, expression of CTMP in penumbra tissues
began to increase at 3 h after reperfusion compared with the
Sham group [P,0.01, 210 (52)% at 3 h, Fig. 3C] and remained
higher than that of the sham group at 24 h after ischaemia
[P,0.01, 250 (42)% at 12 h and 230 (35)% at 24 h, Fig. 3C]. Sevoflurane preconditioning suppressed the increase in CTMP expression induced by I/R at 3, 12, and 24 h after reperfusion
[P,0.01, 100 (55)% vs 210 (52)% at 3 h; P,0.01, 140 (46)% vs
250 (42)% at 12 h; P,0.05, 140 (34)% vs 230 (35)% at 24 h,
Fig. 3C]. Sevoflurane alone did not inhibit CTMPexpression significantly compared with the Sham group (P.0.05, Fig. 3C).

Activation of PI3K/Akt is involved in the
neuroprotective effect of sevoflurane
Pretreatment with wortmannin or LY294002 totally abolished
the neuroprotective effects of sevoflurane preconditioning.

330

Compared with the PC+I/R group, pretreatment with wortmannin increased infarct sizes [P,0.01 41 (13)% vs 23 (8)%,
Fig. 4B and C] and reached the level of animals without sevoflurane preconditioning [41 (13)% for the I/R group]. Similar results
were found with LY294002 as 41 (13)% infarct size in the
LY+PC+I/R group (P,0.01). However, no significant differences were found in neurobehavioural scores (Fig. 4A).

Over-expression of CTMP by lentiviral transduction
prevented the neuroprotective effect of sevoflurane
Injection of LV-CTMP led to 2.6-fold increase in CTMP protein
expression in the targeted brain regions in rats without MCAO
(P,0.01 vs Sham, Fig. 5A) at 72 h after intracerebroventricular
injection as defined by immunoblot analysis. Akt activity
decreased nearly by half at the same time point (P,0.01 vs
Sham, Fig. 5B). Although it did not further aggravate neurological dysfunction or infarct sizes, CTMP over-expression
markedly attenuated the beneficial effects of sevoflurane preconditioning at 24 h after reperfusion as demonstrated by
infarct volume [P,0.05, 38 (10)% in LV-CTMP+PC+I/R vs 24
(8)% in PC+I/R, Fig. 6B and C]. No significant differences were
found in the neurological scores (Fig. 6A)

Discussion
We show that sevoflurane preconditioning inhibits increased
expression of CTMP elicited by brain ischaemia and thereby preserves the kinase activity of Akt to phosphorylate/inactive its
downstream pro-apoptotic target GSK3b. Thus, inhibition of
the endogenous Akt inhibitor CTMP is crucial for the neuroprotective effect of sevoflurane preconditioning.
Multiple molecules such as free radicals,27 ATP-regulated potassium channels (KATP),2 adenosine A1 receptors,28 mitogenactivated protein kinase, hypoxia-inducible factor-1a,29 and
antioxidant enzymes30 have been implicated in the neuroprotection provided by anaesthetic-induced preconditioning
(APC). These are important neuroprotective mechanisms,6 31
but we are still not clear about whether or not the classical

pro-survival (anti-apoptotic) pathway PI3K/Akt/GSK3b is involved. We found that activation of PI3K/Akt is essential to induction of ischaemic tolerance by sevoflurane preconditioning
in the MCAO model. Cerebral ischaemia induced a transient
robust increase in phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473. Surprisingly,
despite the increase in phosphorylation, the activity of Akt
did not change. Sevoflurane preconditioning inhibited the Akt
hyperphosphorylation evoked by ischaemia and increased
Akt activity, which in turn phosphorylated/inactivated its
downstream target GSK3b, thereby preserving more neurones.
Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is important for sevoflurane preconditioning-induced neuroprotection.
A role for mitoKATP in the neuroprotective effect of sevoflurane preconditioning has been reported.5 32 – 34 It has been

332

proposed that opening of the mitoKATP channel is associated
with a reduction in mitochondrial Ca2+ load to prevent the
opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.35
A study of sevoflurane-induced cardioprotection showed that
mitoKATP activation is mediated by activation of PI3K/Akt,36 indicating crosstalk between Akt and mitoKATP. In addition, PI3K/
Akt is involved in regulation of expression of hypoxia-inducible
factor-1a under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions.37 Prosurvival function of restored PI3K/Akt activity by APC might be
associated with these mechanisms, but further studies are
required.
Akt is phosphorylated on threonine 30, by PDK1, a PI3Kdependent protein kinase, and on serine 473 by a putative
serine 473 kinase. Akt phosphorylation is negatively regulated

by two endogenous inhibitors: CTMP and PTEN (phosphatase
and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10).16 PTEN
inhibits Akt phosphorylation and activation by dephosphorylating phosophatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate.38 In our
study, phosphorylation of PTEN showed no obvious changes
in all groups (data not shown), whereas increased expression
of CTMP in the I/R group mirrored the loss of Akt kinase activity
during reperfusion. Our findings are consistent with a model
whereby ischaemia triggers hyperphosphorylation of Akt,
which in turn promotes induction of CTMP, acting as a brake
to inhibit Akt activity. We found that sevoflurane preconditioning suppressed the increase in CTMP expression after reperfusion, thus restoring the activity of Akt and promoting
phosphorylation/inactivation of its downstream target, GSK3b.
To get further solid evidence, we used lentiviral vectors encoding CTMP to observe the influence of CTMP over-expression on
neuroprotection by sevoflurane preconditioning in vivo. Injection of LV-CTMP in normal animals without MCAO increased
CTMP expression injection, mimicking increase in CTMP in rats
with cerebral ischaemia. In ischaemic animals treated with
sevoflurane PC, administration of LV-CTMP reversed the beneficial effects of sevoflurane preconditioning as assessed by
infarct volume. In addition, sevoflurane alone decreased expression of CTMP at 3 h after treatment, and increased pAkt
and pGSK3b. The underlying mechanism of regulation by sevoflurane of CTMP is currently unknown.
It is necessary to explain the absence of effects on postreperfusion behaviours and infarct volumes in the nonpreconditioned animals with PI3K/Akt or CTMP manipulation.
Cerebral ischaemia induced both an up-regulation of ser473
Akt phosphorylation and increase in CTMP expression.
However, activity of Akt did not show a detectable change
after cerebral ischaemia. As we postulated, increased CTMP expression inhibits Akt activity after cerebral ischaemia, which
resulted in inhibition of the pro-survival function of Akt. This
is supported by lack of change in GSK3b phosphorylation. As

shown in previous reports, the activity of Akt kinase is reflected
by the phosphorylation of GSK3b but not its phosphorylation
level.13 18 39 – 44 Sevoflurane preconditioning reduced CTMP expression and restored Akt activity after cerebral ischaemia,
resulting in amelioration of ischaemic injury. Inhibition of
PI3K by wortmannin or LY294002 or over-expression CTMP by
lentiviral transduction reversed the neuroprotective effect of
sevoflurane preconditioning. However, inhibition of PI3K or
overexpression of CTMP alone in ischaemic animals, without
preconditioning, did not further worsen ischaemia injury. One
tentative explanation is that this pro-survival signalling has
largely lost its function during ischaemia/reperfusion injury
and the injury is serious, such that the effect of further inhibition of this pro-surviving pathway may not be obvious. The unchanged Akt activity and increased CTMP expression support
this possible mechanism.
Several limitations of this study need to be mentioned. First,
no significant differences were found between the groups in
neurological score assessment. Exclusion due to inadequate
rCBF decrease or death might explain the negative results, at
least in part, another more sensitive neurological assessment
system might be more suitable for this situation. Secondly,
the use of a GSK3 fusion protein to examine Akt kinase activity
might not reflect total Akt activity in vivo.
In summary, sevoflurane preconditioning inhibits elevated
expression of CTMP triggered by brain ischaemia, and thus preserves Akt activity and its downstream pro-survival signalling
in a transient focal cerebral ischaemic model. Development
of specific inhibitors to CTMP might provide a possible treatment of cerebral ischaemic damage as in stroke.
