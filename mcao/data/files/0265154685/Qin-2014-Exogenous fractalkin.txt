Fractalkine/CX3CL1, also called neurotactin, has been described as an angiogenic agent, and its expression
is up-regulated in the penumbra after ischemia. This study was conducted to investigate the neovascular
potential of fractalkine on rat models of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Rats receiving intracerebroventricular injections of fractalkine were found to have improved neurological deﬁcits,
reduced cerebral infarct size and increased neuron survival for both doses (100 ng and 1 ␮g). Fractalkine
exerted angiogenic effects that showed dose-dependent higher vascular densities in the peri-infarct area.
Furthermore, exogenous fractalkine increased the proliferation of endothelial cells in a dose-dependent
manner and enhanced the migration of endothelial progenitor cells at the higher dose (1 ␮g) in ischemic
penumbra. In conclusion, intracerebroventricular administration of fractalkine reduces ischemic damage
by promoting neuroprotection and by inducing endothelial cell proliferation and endothelial progenitor
cell migration, thereby enhancing neovascularization in the peri-infarct region.

1. Introduction
Stroke is a major cause of mortality and disability worldwide,
and 80% of it is ischemic stroke [31]. Functional recovery can
signiﬁcantly improve the quality of life of stroke survivors. Interestingly, studies demonstrate that higher blood vessel counts in the

penumbra correlate with better functional recovery after ischemic
stroke [1,13,31,32]. Accumulating data now suggest that neovascularization facilitates highly coupled neurorestorative processes
that consequently lead to attenuation of ischemic brain injury [34].
Therefore, the use of agents and manipulations to stimulate neovascularization that restores oxygen and nutrient supply to the
cerebral infarct area and that provides neurotrophic compounds
to newly generated neurons and neuroblasts may be a potential
therapy for ischemic stroke [1,4,29,34].
Post-ischemic neovascularization consistently includes angiogenesis (sprouting of new capillaries from existing microvessels),
vasculogenesis (blood vessel formation by migration and differentiation of endothelial precursor cells), and arteriogenesis (growth
or maturation of collateral conduits with large enough diameters) [6,19,27,33]. It is a complex process that involves multiple
mechanisms and numerous cytokines, such as vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), erythropoietin and chemokines [1,9].

Fractalkine, the sole member of the CX3 C chemokine family, is expressed constitutively in neurons and can be induced in
microglia, astrocytes and vascular endothelial cells [11,17]. It is primarily described as being the recruiter for inﬂammatory immune
cells in ischemic stroke [8,16]. Recently, it has been described
as an angiogenic chemokine. Previous studies have shown that
fractalkine induced endothelial cell migration and proliferation,
endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) migration and tube-like structure formation in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro, and
stimulated new blood vessel formation in vivo [7,14,15,21,25].
The studies also showed angiogenic effects in ischemic diseases.
For example, in rat models of hindlimb ischemia, intra-muscular
injection of exogenous fractalkine improved blood perfusion by
inducing angiogenesis [14]. However, whether fractalkine can similarly enhance neovascularization and contribute to functional
recovery following ischemic stroke has not been elucidated.
In the present study, we investigated the neovascular and neuroprotective action of fractalkine in the restoration of ischemic injury,
focusing on analyzing the neovascularization through angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, as well as neurological deﬁcits, brain infarct
volume and neuron survival. We found that intracerebroventricular
administration of fractalkine induced endothelial cell proliferation
and EPC migration and, consequently, enhanced neovascularization
in the peri-infarct region that in turn alleviated tissue damage. This
is the ﬁrst conﬁrmation of a neovascular contribution of exogenous
fractalkine in ischemic stroke.

through a micro syringe (RWD Life Science Co., Ltd) into the right
cerebral ventricle (0.8 mm posterior, 1.5 mm lateral to the bregma,
and 4.0 mm below the dura). The needle was retained for 5 min after
each injection, and dental cement was applied to the skull hole to
prevent leakage of the injected solution and cerebrospinal ﬂuid.
One set of rats (n = 5/group) were euthanized 14 days after MCAO
for TTC staining; the other set of rats (n = 8/group) were euthanized
14 days after MCAO for immunostaining.
2.3. Neurological functional tests
Modiﬁed Neurological Severity Scores (mNSS) including motor
tests, sensory tests, bean balance tests, evaluation of absent reﬂexes
and abnormal movements were performed before MCAO and at 1,
7, and 14 days after MCAO [12].
2.4. TTC staining
Fourteen days after MCAO, rats (n = 5/group) were perfused
intracardially with saline. The brain tissue was removed, stowed
at −80 ◦ C for 8 min, and sliced into 2.0-mm-thick sections (six
slices per rat) with brain matrices (RWD Life Science Co., Ltd). The
brain slices were incubated in 2% TTC under no-light conditions for
20 min at 37 ◦ C, and then transferred into 4% paraformaldehyde for
ﬁxation. The areas of each slice were obtained using a digital camera, and the volumes of infarction were calculated using a modiﬁed
method that has been described previously [24,30].

2.1. Materials

2.5. Immunoﬂuorescence staining for neuron and vessel counts

Recombinant rat fractalkine (chemokine domain) was purchased from R &D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, USA). Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) was obtained from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO, USA). Rabbit anti-CD34 was purchased from Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China); mouse anti-NeuN
was obtained from Merck Millipore (Massachusetts, USA); other
primary antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK).
All secondary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, USA).

Fourteen days after MCAO, rats (n = 8/group) were perfused with
saline and phosphate buffered (pH 7.4) 4% paraformaldehyde. Then,
the brains were postﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 h, and
gradient dehydrated in 20% and 30% sucrose. For immunostaining, a series of 10 ␮m-thick sections were cut from bregma −1
to +1 mm on a cryostat (CM1900; Leica, Heidelberg, Germany).
Every 10th coronal section, for a total of 5 sections, was used
for immunoﬂuorescence staining, and the region of interest was
deﬁned in each section as a zone with 800 ␮m width and length
in the peri-infarct region that is immediately outside the infarct
zone as described previously [10]. To quantify cerebral neuron survival and blood vessel density, the brain sections were stained
with mouse anti-NeuN (1:500) or mouse anti-CD31 (1:200), and
conjugated with goat anti-mouse 488 (1:1000). All staining sections were also counterstained with 4 ,6-diamidno-2-phenylindole
dihydrochloride (DAPI) to assist the conﬁrmation of cells. Fluorescence signals were captured with a microscope (BX51; Olympus)
and the numbers of neurons and blood vessels were analyzed with
Image-Pro Plus image analysis software in 8 non-overlapping ﬁelds
(425 ␮m × 320 ␮m) (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA)
under 400× magniﬁcation.

2.2. Animals and treatment
A total of 45 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing
250–280 g were obtained from the Center for Experimental Animals
of Sun Yat-Sen University (Guangzhou, China) and maintained at a
speciﬁc pathogen-free housing facility. All procedures performed
on these animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee at Sun Yat-Sen University and were in accordance
with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
of the National Institute of Health (Publication No. 80-23, revised
1996).
Transient (90 min) right middle cerebral artery occlusions were
induced as previously described [2,22]. Rats were anesthetized
with 0.35 g/kg i.p. chloral hydrate, and then a MCAO monoﬁlament, 0.26 mm in diameter (BEIJING SUNBIO BIOTECH Co., Ltd),
was inserted into the internal carotid artery (ICA) through a small
incision in the common carotid artery (CCA) after ligation of the
external carotid artery (ECA) and the proximal CCA. For the shamoperated group (n = 6), the ﬁlament was not inserted into the
artery. For the experimental groups (n = 13/group), 30 min after
occlusion, the rats received injections stereotaxically with either:
5 ␮l phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for the control group, 100 ng
recombinant rat fractalkine in 5 ␮l PBS for the low dose group and
1 ␮g recombinant rat fractalkine in 5 ␮l PBS for the high dose group

2.6. Double immunoﬂuorescence analysis of endothelial cell
proliferation and EPC homing
To identify whether fractalkine could increase endothelial
cell proliferation and EPC migration in perifocal ﬁelds, double
immunoﬂuorescence labeling for rabbit anti-Ki67 (1:100) with
mouse anti-CD31 (1:200) or rabbit anti-CD34 (1:200) with mouse
anti-KDR (anti-VEGF receptor 2, 1:100) conjugation with goat
anti-mouse 488 (1:1000) and goat anti-rabbit 555 (1:1000) were
performed. Images were acquired using ﬂuorescent microscopy
(BX51; Olympus) with a digital camera and the numbers of
colocalized Ki67/CD31 or CD34/KDR immunopositive cells were

determined using Image-Pro Plus image analysis software under
400× magniﬁcation.
2.7. Statistical analysis
All of the results in this study were presented as mean ± SEM.
Repeated measures ANOVA was used to evaluate mNSS variances.
A nonparametric test was used to analyze infarct volume values.
One-way ANOVA, followed by the Bonferroni’s post hoc test, was
used for comparisons of the numbers of immunostaining positive
cells. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 for windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
when comparisons were made.
3. Results
3.1. Fractalkine administration improved functional recovery,
reduced the infarct volume and attenuated neuron cell death
The effects of intracerebroventricular administration of
fractalkine on neurological function were measured using mNSS
(normal score, 0; maximal deﬁcit score, 18). The mNSS scores
were 8.69 ± 0.29, 6.39 ± 0.33, and 4.85 ± 0.30 in the group with
100 ng fractalkine treatment and 7.77 ± 0.26, 5.15 ± 0.30, and
3.69 ± 0.24 in the group treated with 1 ␮g at 1, 7 and 14 days
after MCAO, respectively. In contrast, the mNSS were 9.39 ± 0.27,
7.39 ± 0.31, and 6.00 ± 0.32 at 1, 7 and 14 days in the control
group after MCAO, respectively. The repeated measures ANOVA
revealed no signiﬁcant interaction between treatment effects and
time effects (p = 0.167), but deﬁnitely revealed signiﬁcant effects
of treatment (p < 0.001) and time (p < 0.001). Furthermore, there
were signiﬁcant differences at 1 (p < 0.001), 7 (p < 0.001) and 14
(p < 0.001) days between the PBS group and the 1 ␮g group, at 14
(p = 0.022) days between the PBS and the 100 ng group, and at
7 (p = 0.026) and 14 (p = 0.022) days between the 100 ng and the
1 ␮g groups (Fig. 1a). The post hoc test certiﬁed that mNSS values
at 7 or 14 days were much lower than those at 1 days in control
group (all p < 0.001, data not shown), indicating the occurrence of
spontaneous recovery after brain ischemia.
The relative infarct volumes were 6.65 ± 1.46% in the 100 ng
group and 4.30 ± 1.61% in the 1 ␮g group at 14 d after MCAO.
In contrast, the relative infarct volume of the control group was
25.52 ± 3.59%. The nonparametric test revealed signiﬁcant differences among the three groups (p = 0.007). Compared with the
control group, fractalkine signiﬁcantly reduced the infarct volumes
in the 100 ng (p = 0.006) and the 1 ␮g (p = 0.001) groups at 14 d.
However, although it showed a visibly decreasing trend, there was
no statistically signiﬁcant difference between the 100 ng and the
1 ␮g groups (p = 0.612) (Fig. 1b).
To further investigate the neuroprotective effects of fractalkine
on the survival of neurons after ischemia, immunoﬂuorescence was
performed to identify NeuN-positive cells (Fig. 1c). At 14 d after
MCAO, the numbers of NeuN-positive cells were signiﬁcantly different in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1d). Compared with the
control, exogenous fractalkine enhanced neuron survival (100 ng:
p = 0.010; 1 ␮g: p < 0.001).
3.2. Fractalkine enhanced neovascularization, stimulated
endothelial cell proliferation and EPC migration in peri-infarct
region
To examine the involvement of neovascularization in the periinfarct region, immunostaining was performed using an antibody
against CD31 (Fig. 2a). At 14 d, there were signiﬁcant differences
in the numbers of CD31-immunoreactive vessels among the three

groups (p < 0.001). The post hoc test revealed that fractalkine injection enhanced the neovascularization compared with the control
(100 ng: p = 0.037; 1 ␮g: p < 0.001) and the larger dose resulted in
higher blood vessel counts (p = 0.022) (Fig. 2d).
Furthermore, to explore the mechanisms for the augmented
neovascularization in the peri-infarct area, the effects of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis were studied. Immunostaining of CD31/Ki67
double-positive cells showed rare proliferation of endothelial cells
in the sham-operated group after MCAO. In contrast, endothelial cells proliferated at accelerated rates in response to ischemia
(Fig. 2b). There were signiﬁcant differences among the three groups
(p < 0.001). The post hoc test revealed that exogenous fractalkine
stimulated endothelial cell proliferation (100 ng: p < 0.001; 1 ␮g:
p < 0.001), and the numbers of proliferative endothelial cells were
more in 1 ␮g group than that in 100 ng group (p < 0.001), indicating action in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2e). Meanwhile,
CD34, a marker of hematopoietic precursors and endothelial cells
as well as KDR, a marker of endothelial cells, certain monocytes
and hematopoietic precursors were used to identify some subpopulations of EPCs [18,26] (Fig. 2c). Compared with the control
group, fractalkine signiﬁcantly increased the numbers of CD34/KDR
double-positive cells in the peri-infarct region at 14 d after 1 ␮g
treatment (p = 0.001), but did not signiﬁcantly increased the numbers of such cells after 100 ng treatment (p = 0.129) (Fig. 2f).

4. Discussion
In this study, we investigated the effects of exogenous
fractalkine on neuron survival, endothelial cell proliferation and
EPC migration in ischemic stroke rats. We found that in addition
to exerting neuroprotective effects that enhanced neuron survival,
fractalkine also increased blood vessel density in the peri-infarct
area by promoting endothelial cell proliferation and EPC migration,
thereby concomitantly improving functional recovery.
The function of fractalkine in ischemic stroke still remains controversial. Recently, the focus has moved from its chemotaxis
properties to its neuroprotective effects [5]. Previous studies have
shown that fractalkine exerted its neuronal survival effects in cultured neurons resulting in suppression of neuronal cell death, and
additionally in rat models of permanent MCAO resulting in reduced
ischemia-induced cerebral infarct size and neurological deﬁcits,
and furthermore in ischemic stroke patients, which resulted in better 6-month outcomes [3,20,23,28]. In this study, we found that
fractalkine treatment 30 min after cerebral ischemia signiﬁcantly
improved neurological function, reduced infarct size and attenuated ischemia-induced neuron death. Therefore, our observations
provided strong evidence that exogenous fractalkine was neuroprotective in rats suffering from cerebral ischemia.
In addition to its neuroprotective activities, our study also ﬁrst
demonstrated that intracerebroventricular injection of fractalkine
signiﬁcantly induced endothelial cell proliferation in a dosedependent manner and increased EPC numbers in the peri-infarct
tissue at the higher dose (1 ␮g), which synergistically contributed to the enhancement of post-ischemia neovascularization.
Fractalkine has previously been shown to increase endothelial
cell proliferation, EPC migration and tube-like structure formation in a concentration-dependent manner [21,25]. Although such
dose dependence was clearly seen in endothelial cell proliferation but not in EPC migration in this study, it is possible that
the range of doses of fractalkine used was too narrow to demonstrate a dose response in EPC migration. Neovascularization in the
penumbra, triggered by ischemia and augmented by interventions
that will stimulate endogenous neurorestorative mechanisms, can
result in enduring recovery from neurological deﬁcits [1,9]. Therefore, together with our ﬁnding, exogenous fractalkine exerted

angiogenic effects in MCAO rats that enhanced blood vessel density
by stimulating proliferation of endothelial cells and increasing EPCs
in the peri-infarct region, which might have triggered endogenous
neurorestorative processes that ultimately improved neurological
functional recovery.
5. Conclusions
Overall, the present study suggested that exogenous fractalkine
promoted neuroprotection and enhanced neovascularization by
inducing endothelial cell proliferation and EPC homing, which consequently attenuated ischemic damage. These ﬁndings indicated
that exogenous fractalkine might be beneﬁcial for alleviation of
ischemic stroke through both neuroprotective and vascular mechanisms.
