Abstract. Peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor  γ
(PPARγ) expression and activity are increased in brain ischemic
injury and its agonists have shown potential for brain injury
protection. The influence of 12/15‑lipoxygenase (12/15‑LOX)
on the activity of PPARγ in oxygen‑glucose deprivation
(OGD) and ischemia‑reperfusion (I/R) was investigated. A
middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion model with
Sprague Dawley (SD) rats was established. For I/R intervention, the rats were treated with the 12/15‑LOX‑derived product
12‑hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12‑HETE) for 30 min before
cerebral artery occlusion. Primary cortical neurons from SD
rats were used to establish an OGD cell model. 12‑HETE or
a 12/15‑LOX antisense oligonucleotide (asON‑12/15‑LOX)
was added to OGD‑treated neurons. Western blots, immunofluorescence and enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assays
detected protein. Reverse transcription‑polymerase chain
reaction analyzed the expression of the PPARγ target genes.
PPARγ‑DNA binding activity was determined by peroxisome
proliferator responsive element luciferase reporter vectors.
12/15‑LOX total protein increased significantly with I/R,
and expression of 12‑HETE was also upregulated. 12‑HETE
treatment increased PPARγ protein expression and inhibited
inducible nitric oxide synthase protein expression, which was
upregulated with I/R. PPARγ nuclear protein and 12/15‑LOX
total protein expression in OGD‑treated neurons increased
significantly. 12‑HETE treatment increased the expression
of PPARγ nuclear protein, upregulated the mRNA levels of
PPARγ target genes (lipoprotein lipase and acyl‑CoA oxidase)
and enhanced PPARγ‑DNA binding activity. asON‑12/15‑LOX
treatment inhibited 12/15‑LOX and PPARγ protein expression

OGD treatment in neurons promoted 12/15‑LOX expression,
and 12‑HETE activated PPARγ. Therefore, PPARγ can be activated by the 12/15‑LOX pathway during cerebral I/R injury.
Introduction
Peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a
transcription factor that controls multiple cellular metabolic
processes and is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor
protein family involved in the regulation of multiple physiological and pathological metabolic processes, such as lipid
and glucose metabolism regulation in vivo and inflammation
regulation (1). PPARγ is mainly expressed in monocytes/macrophages and fat cells, and low levels of PPARγ can be detected
in the central nervous system. Recent studies have revealed that
brain ischemic injury promoted the expression and activity of
PPARγ (2) and that a PPARγ agonist can protect against brain
ischemic injury through PPARγ activation (3,4).
12/15‑lipoxygenase (12/15‑LOX) is a fatty acid dioxygenase
that can oxidize arachidonic acid into 12‑hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12‑HETE) in mammalian cells. In vitro studies
of non‑neuronal cells revealed that 12‑HETE can activate
PPARγ (5). However, no studies have explored the influence of
the 12/15‑LOX pathway and 12‑HETE on PPARγ activity in
neurons damaged by ischemic injury. The present study investigated the changes in 12/15‑LOX and 12‑HETE levels and their
impact on PPARγ activation in rat cortical neurons treated with
oxygen‑glucose deprivation (OGD). Simultaneously, antisense
oligonucleotide technology was used to explore the influence
of 12/15‑LOX inhibition on PPARγ expression and activation
to investigate the regulatory effect of 12/15‑LOX pathway
on PPARγ. The aim of the present study was to understand
these mechanisms. The results may assist in the understanding
of brain ischemic injury and help develop treatments in the
future.
Materials and methods
Animal grouping and drug administration. All the animal
experiments were carried out according to an institutionally
approved protocol, in accordance with the National Institutes
of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals,
and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Tianjin Medical University (Tianjin, China).

HAN et al: 12/15-LOX ACTIVATES PPARγ

Healthy adult male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats weighing
280‑330 g were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center
at the Academy of Military Medical Sciences. All the rats
consumed water freely but were fasted for 12 h before surgery.
The rats were randomly allocated into three groups and were
treated as follows: i) 12 rats in the sham‑operation group
were used for brain tissue homogenates for further analysis.
ii) 6 rats in the ischemia‑reperfusion (I/R) group were used for
tissue sections and 12 rats were used for brain tissue homogenates for further analysis. iii) 12 rats in the I/R intervention
group were used for brain tissue homogenates. 12‑HETE was
purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI, USA)
and dissolved in phosphate‑buffered saline (PBS) at 1 mg/ml.
In the I/R intervention group, rats received stereotactic injections of 15 ml 12‑HETE 30 min before ischemia induction,
whereas the rats in the sham‑operation group or I/R group
received equal volumes of PBS.
Stereotactic intracerebroventricular injection. Rats were
anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate 30 min before the
establishment of the middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model. Subsequently, 15 ml 12‑HETE or
an equal volume of PBS was injected into the right lateral
ventricle at 0.8 mm posterior to bregma, 1.3 mm right lateral
to midline and 3.5 mm deep into the subdural surface.
Injection was performed at a rate of 1 µl/min and finished in
15 min. The needle was retained for 15 min and withdrawn
at a rate of 1 mm/min to prevent overflowing of 12‑HETE or
PBS.
Establishment of MCAO/R model. The rat cerebral artery
was occluded with thread for 60 min and reperfusion was
performed for 24 h. In the sham‑operation group the common
carotid, external carotid and internal carotid arteries were
exposed and separated by surgery without occlusion.
Primary culture of fetal rat cortical neurons and neuronal cell
identification. Day 18‑21 embryonic Sprague Dawley (SD) rats
were sacrificed following anesthesia with ice and 75% ethanol
and the cerebral cortex was isolated under sterile conditions.
Pia mater and blood vessels were removed under a dissecting
microscope. The cerebral cortex were cut into pieces and
digested with 0.125% trypsin at 37˚C for 20 min. Subsequently,
20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added to stop digestion and
the cells were triturated with a Pasteur pipette and filtered with
a 200‑mesh cell strainer to collect single‑cell suspensions. The
cells were counted with a hemocytometer. Cells were seeded
into Petri dishes were pre‑coated with 0.1 mg/ml L‑polylysine
at a final density of 105‑106/ml. Primary cortical neurons were
incubated at 37˚C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere and
high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient
mixture F‑12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 10% horse serum,
1% glutamine and 1% penicillin‑streptomycin was used as
culture medium. The medium was changed to neurobasal
medium (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
supplemented with 2% B27 following cell attachment (3 to
6 h after seeding). Half the volume of neurobasal medium
was refreshed every third day. Neuronal‑specific marker
microtubule‑associated protein 2 (MAP2) was stained at day 9
and >95% cells were MAP2 positive.

Preparation of the neuronal model of oxygen‑glucose
deprivation (OGD) and 12‑HETE or 12/15‑LOX antisense
oligonucleotide (asON‑12/15‑LOX) treatment. Day 9 cortical
neurons were randomly divided into the control, OGD‑treated
and intervention groups. The medium of the OGD‑treated
neurons was changed to neurobasal medium without glucose
(Invitrogen Life Technologies) and the neurons were incubated
in a pre‑adjusted tri‑gas incubator (37˚C, 95% N2, 5% CO2,
<1% O2). After 3 h incubation, neurons were cultured in the
normal medium at the normal conditions for 24 h and were
collected for further analysis. The 12‑HETE intervention
group was treated with 1 µM 12‑HETE 30 min before OGD
treatment and the 12‑HETE concentration was maintained
during the whole culture process. The asON‑12/15‑LOX
intervention group was treated with 4 µM asON 48 h before
OGD treatment and maintained during the whole culture
process. The same volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
was added into the OGD‑treated group. The sequences of the
antisense oligonucleotides used in the study are as follows:
Antisense, 5'‑CTC‑AGG‑AGG‑GTG‑TAA‑ACA‑3' (6); sense,
5'‑TGT‑TTA‑CAC‑CCT‑CCT‑GAG‑3'; and scramble, 5'‑AAG‑
ATT‑GCG‑GCG‑CGA‑CGA‑TGA‑3'.
Analysis of relative OGD‑treated neuron survival rate by
3‑[4, 5‑dimethylthiazol‑2‑yl]‑2, 5 diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. Cortical neurons at day 9 were divided
into 8 replicate blank groups (culture medium without
neurons), control groups and OGD‑treated groups. After treatment with OGD for 24 h, neurons were further cultured in
normal medium and medium only was added into blank wells.
Subsequently, 20 µl 5 mg/ml MTT was added into each well
and incubated for 4 h. After discarding the medium, 100 µl
DMSO was added, mixed thoroughly and incubated at 37˚C
for 15 min. The optical density (OD) of each well was analyzed
with an automatic plate reader and the absorbance at 570 nm
was measured. The relative cell survival rate was calculated
as follows: Relative cell survival rate = (OD OGD‑treated
group ‑ OD blank group)/(OD control group ‑ OD blank
group). The median concentration was used for the model set.
Nuclear protein extraction. Nuclear proteins were isolated
with a nuclear protein extraction kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Western blotting. The primary antibodies were as follows:
Mouse anti‑rat PPARγ monoclonal antibody (1:200; Santa
Cruz, Dallas, USA), rabbit anti‑rat 12/15‑LOX monoclonal
antibody (1:1000; Cayman Chemical Co.); and related horseradish peroxidase (HRP)‑conjugated secondary antibodies
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA; 1:5000)
were used as previously described (2).
ELISA analysis. The level of 12‑HETE in neurons was determined with the 12‑HETE ELISA kit (Assay Design, Ann
Arbor, MI, USA) and performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Total RNA isolation and reverse transcription‑polymerase
chain reaction (RT‑PCR) amplification. Total RNA was
extracted from the cells with TRIzol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO,

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE 35: 195-201, 2015

USA), precipitated with chloroform‑isopropanol and quantified
with absorbance at OD260. cDNA was generated from 1.5 µg
total RNA. PCR amplification was performed using a 20  µl
reaction system, including 1 µl cDNA, 2 µl forward and
reverse primers (5 µM), 200 µM dNTPs and 0.8 U Taq polymerase. Primers for lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were as follows:
Forward, 5'‑TTCCATTACCAAGTCAAGATTCAC‑3'; and
reverse, 5'‑TCAGCCCGACTTCTTCAGAGACTT‑3'. PCR
amplification products were analyzed with 1.2% agarose gel
electrophoresis and a gel imaging system (Tanon Science &
Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) was used to quantify
the band density. Glyceraldehyde 3‑phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) was used as a loading control.
Construction of PGL3‑PPRE and determination of luciferase
activity. pGL3‑basic (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was used
as the vector, which contains the luciferase mRNAs without
promoter. Three peroxisome proliferator responsive element
(PPRE) fragments were inserted upstream of the luciferase
gene in the pGL3‑basic vector to construct the pGL3‑PPRE
vector. Neurons were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen Life Technologies) and 24 h later, 1 µM 12‑HETE
was added, whereas in the control group, the same volume
of DMSO was added. The cells were lysed 24 h later and
luciferase analysis was performed according to the instructions of the luciferase assay system kit (Promega). A Safire2
basic plate reader from Tecan Australia Pty Ltd. (Melbourne,
Australia) was used to measure the ODs of the cell lysates.
The β‑galactosidase enzyme assay system kit (Promega) was
used to measure the β ‑gal activity to adjust the luciferase
value for transfection efficiency. Adjusted fluorescence
value = measured fluorescence value / β‑gal value.
Immunofluorescence staining. Neurons were cultured on sterile
slides precoated with poly‑L‑lysine. To perform immunofluorescence staining, neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
and blocked with serum for 30 min. Neurons were then incubated with a rabbit anti‑rat 12/15‑LOX polyclonal antibody
(1:100; Cayman Chemical Co.) or anti‑PPARγ antibody (1:50;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4˚C overnight. A tetraethyl
rhodamine isothiocyanate‑conjugated secondary antibody was
added the next day and incubated in the dark at 37˚C for 1 h.
Neurons were washed with PBS‑Tween 20 and finally incubated with 4',6‑diamidino‑2‑phenylindole at room temperature
for 10 min to stain the cell nuclei. Slides were treated with
mounting medium and analyzed with a Nikon Eclipse 80i
microscope and Nikon DS‑Ril camera (Nikon, Toyko, Japan).
Statistical analysis. Experimental data was exhibited as
mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed
with SPSS 15.0 statistical package (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL,
USA) and an independent samples t test was performed for
comparison between groups. A χ2 test was used to analyze the
difference in neuron survival rates between groups. P<0.05
was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.

expression of 12/15‑LOX in rat brain tissues from the I/R
injury model. Significant upregulation of 12/15‑LOX expression was induced by I/R injury (Fig. 1A). To explore the activity
changes of 12/15‑LOX, the level of its product, 12‑HETE, was
determined by ELISA and the results showed that I/R injury
clearly induced the production of 12‑HETE (Fig. 1B).

the expression of PPARγ (Fig. 2).
Suppression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expres‑

control group. The difference between the two groups was
significant (P<0.05).
Western blots showed that the 12/15‑LOX protein, the
critical enzyme generating 12‑HETE, increased significantly
with OGD treatment compared with the control group
(Fig. 4A) and immunofluorescence experiments confirmed
that the upregulation of 12/15‑LOX expression was induced
by OGD (Fig. 4B).

asON‑12/15‑LOX treatment inhibited the expression of PPARγ
nuclear protein significantly compared to the OGD‑treated

results of the western blot, showing that the expression of
PPARγ nuclear protein was upregulated with OGD treatment
and the upregulation was inhibited by asON‑12/15‑LOX treatment (Fig. 7B).
Expression of PPARγ target genes by 12‑HETE treatment
and suppression of PPARγ target genes by asON‑12/15‑LOX
treatment in OGD‑treated neurons. RT‑PCR was employed
to analyze the expression of LPL, a PPARγ target gene, in
OGD‑treated neurons and to explore the impact of 12‑HETE
intervention on its expression. The results showed that
12‑HETE intervention markedly increased the expression of
LPL mRNA compared to OGD‑treated neurons (Fig. 8A).
However, treatment with asON‑12/15‑LOX clearly inhibited
the expression of LPL in OGD‑treated neurons (Fig. 8B).

Enhancement of PPARγ binding ability to DNA by 12‑HETE
treatment. Normal cultured cortical neurons were transfected with pGL3‑PPRE and were subsequently treated with
12‑HETE, OGD or OGD plus 12‑HETE. After 24 h, luciferase
activities in the treated neurons clearly increased compared
to control neurons treated with DMSO (t=–10.753, –9.679 and
–21.978, respectively, P<0.05). Luciferase activity increased
similarly in 12‑HETE‑ and OGD‑treated neurons with 4‑fold
changes, but luciferase activity increased by 18‑fold in neurons
treated with OGD plus 12‑HETE (Fig. 9). Furthermore, relative survival rates of neurons were measured with the MTT
assay and the possibility that luciferase activity was enhanced
by cell survival changes derived from 12‑HETE or OGD treatment was excluded (data not shown). Only minor luciferase
activity was detected in 12‑HETE‑treated neurons transfected
with pGL3‑Basic, whereas luciferase activity could not be
detected in neurons transfected with mixtures without any
plasmids or in neuron lysates.
Discussion
The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of
12/15‑LOX on the activity of PPARγ in ischemia reperfusion.
This was of interest as this information may assist with future
treatment of brain ischemic injury. PPARγ is a member of the
nuclear receptor superfamily and a ligand‑dependent transcriptional factor. PPARγ activation leads to its nuclear translocation
in order to regulate the transcription of target genes. Numerous
studies have reported that PPARγ expression and activity
in brain tissues were induced by I/R injury (7‑10), and that
PPARγ activation reduced infarct volume and inhibition of
inflammation mediators including intercellular adhesion molecule 1, interleukin‑β, cyclooxygenase‑2 and iNOS (3,4,11,12).
Therefore, it has been proposed that induction of PPARγ
expression and activation by brain ischemia is a protective
response to damage. This protective response may be attributed
to PPARγ activation induced by endogenous agonists following
ischemia, but the detailed mechanisms remain elusive.

HAN et al: 12/15-LOX ACTIVATES PPARγ

12/15‑LOX, a member of lipoxygenase family, is a lipid
peroxidase encoded by the ALOX15 gene that can oxidize free
polyunsaturated fatty acids and phospholipids in biological
membranes to generate oxidative products. 12‑HETE is
the oxidative derivative of arachidonic acid catalyzed by
12/15‑LOX. In brain tissues, 12/15‑LOX is mainly expressed
in neurons or certain astrocytes in the cerebral hemisphere,
basal ganglia and hippocampus. 12‑HETE is the major
product of 12/15‑LOX in the central nervous system (3).
Previous studies revealed that in brain tissues, 12/15‑LOX
may exert its physiological functions through oxidative modifications of membrane structures and generation of mediators
or signaling molecules with biological activities involved in
synaptic transmission (13,14). In vitro studies confirmed that
12/15‑LOX products, such as 13‑hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid
(13‑HODE), 12‑HETE and 15‑‑HETE served as endogenous
PPARγ agonists. Furthermore, higher expression levels of
12/15‑LOX enhanced the transcriptional activation effect
of PPARγ in specific cell types. For example, in monocytes,
12/15‑LOX products interacted with PPARγ directly to
stimulate the expression of cluster of differentiation 36 and
upregulate PPARγ expression simultaneously (15). The induction of PPARγ and its target genes by IL4 in macrophages
through the 12/15‑LOX pathway has already been shown.
Similarly, 13‑HODE and 15‑HETE PPARγ and increase the
expression of PPARγ mRNA in human vascular smooth
muscle cells (16) and colon tumor cell line (17). Furthermore,
in vivo experiments have confirmed the regulatory effect of
12/15‑LOX on PPARγ and in the mouse uterus, PPARγ activation can occur through the 12/15‑LOX pathway to mediate the
impact of 12/15‑LOX on the pregnant uterus (5). These results
indicate that elevation of PPARγ expression and activation
could be induced by 12/15‑LOX in multiple tissues and cells.
Therefore, we speculate that 12/15‑LOX has similar roles in
the central nervous system.
In the present study, I/R injury has been demonstrated to
induce the expression of 12/15‑LOX and its product 12‑HETE.
A previous study implicated the upregulation of 12‑HETE
level with oxidative stress caused by I/R injury in brain
tissues (18). However, other studies have shown that 12‑HETE
is involved in synaptic transmission as a second messenger
in the central nervous system and that it also participates in
a variety of physiological activities, including learning and
memory (19,20). Notably, 12‑HETE served as an endogenous
agonist of PPARγ to modulate its activity (5).
PPARγ is a nuclear transcription factor and following
activation it transports into the cell nucleus from the cytoplasm to regulate the expression of target genes. Therefore,
the expression of PPARγ protein in the nucleus is associated
with its activity status. Regulation of target gene expression by
PPARγ is through PPARγ binding to a specific DNA element
in the promoters of the target genes (peroxisome proliferator
responsive element, termed PPRE) to promote target gene
expression (21‑23).
The present study revealed that 12‑HETE intervention in
rats with I/R injury elevated the expression of PPARγ total
protein. Furthermore, treatment of OGD‑damaged rat cortical
neurons with 12‑HETE induced the expression of PPARγ,
enhanced its binding ability to DNA and promoted the
expression of target genes, suggesting the stimulatory effect

of 12‑HETE on PPARγ activity. Several associated studies
have reported an inhibitory effect of PPARγ on inflammation
following ischemia. For instance, PPARγ agonists, including
pioglitazone, rosiglitazone and troglitazone, reduced infarct
volume, improved neuron functions, suppressed the expression
of variant inflammatory mediators, reduced neutrophil infiltration, and inhibited the activation of microglias, macrophages
and the inflammation‑associated NF‑κB pathway (4,10‑12).
Furthermore, other studies have reported that the neuroprotective effect of PPARγ is partially achieved through suppression
of iNOS expression and activation (24‑27). In accordance with
these results, it was observed that elevated expression of iNOS
in brain tissues with I/R injury was inhibited by 12‑HETE
intervention and PPARγ activity was stimulated simultaneously, indicating that 12‑HETE‑induced PPARγ activation
inhibited inflammation responses, to achieve a neuroprotective
effect.
Antisense oligonucleotides were also used to inhibit the
expression of 12/15‑LOX and revealed that PPARγ nuclear
expression was negatively regulated by asON‑12/15‑LOX,
confirming the regulatory effect of 12/15‑LOX on PPARγ. Cell
transfection reagents are often used to promote the delivery of
antisense oligonucleotides into cells to enhance the inhibitory
effect. However, cell transfection reagents often damage cells.
As primary cultured neurons in vitro are vulnerable and prone
to injury, the oligonucleotides were dissolved into the culture
medium directly to treat neurons. This method inhibited the
expression of 12/15‑LOX significantly, indicating its feasibility. Previous studies have also proved the efficiency of such
methods in sensory neuron treatment (6,28).
The present study has certain limitations. Rat‑based
models of oxygen‑glucose deprivation and ischemia reperfusion were used, however, it would be noteworthy to observe if
the role of 12/15‑LOX can also be followed in human derived
cells. A number of details of the mechanism of PPARγ protection remain to be revealed and therefore, further work is
required prior to considering these results in terms of clinical
therapy.
In conclusion, the level of the 12/15‑LOX‑derived product
12‑HETE was significantly elevated in OGD‑treated cortical
neurons and confirmed the agonistic effect of 12‑HETE on
PPARγ. The expression of PPARγ nuclear expression could
be blocked with 12/15‑LOX inhibition in OGD‑treated
neurons. These results revealed that PPARγ is activated by the
12/15‑LOX pathway in OGD‑treated neurons and that PPARγ
activation has a neuroprotective effect, indicating that it is a
neuronal self‑protective response to damage and injury.
