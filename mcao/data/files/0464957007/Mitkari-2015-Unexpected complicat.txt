BRIEF COMMUNICATION

Unexpected complication in a rat stroke model: exacerbation
of secondary pathology in the thalamus by subacute
intraarterial administration of human bone marrow-derived
mesenchymal stem cells
Bhimashankar Mitkari1, Erja Kerkelä2, Johanna Nystedt2, Matti Korhonen2 and Jukka Jolkkonen1
This study examined whether human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (BMMSCs) could alleviate the secondary
pathology in the thalamus after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. Atypical accumulation of both amyloid-β (Aβ) and
calcium in the thalamus was signiﬁcantly higher in rats receiving the BMMSCs infusion 48 hours after MCAO as compared with the
vehicle MCAO group. The elevated Aβ/calcium accumulation correlated with the level of impaired sensorimotor function. Although
secondary pathology in the thalamus seems to be rodent speciﬁc, it needs to be taken into account because it may impair
long-term behavioral recovery and negate therapeutic treatment effects.

INTRODUCTION
At present therapeutic options in stroke are extremely limited and
thus much effort is being directed at developing innovative
treatments, such as cell therapies. In particular, intravascular cell
therapy is a promising approach for the treatment of stroke and is
claimed to achieve an efﬁcient and wide cell engraftment in case
of large or multiple lesions.1 Since it is relatively noninvasive,
application of this approach would be feasible in stroke therapy.
We have previously shown that intravenous infusion of human
umbilical cord blood cells in rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) results in the accumulation of cells primarily in the
lungs.2 The lung entrapment can be circumvented by intraarterial
cell infusion, which can target cells to the ischemic brain as shown
by intraarterial infusion of human bone marrow-derived stem cells
(BMMSCs).3
The most effective therapeutic time window for intraarterial cell
transplantation is not known. Acute cell infusion after stroke has
been postulated to be neuroprotective, whereas cell delivery at
later time points (424 hours) may enhance brain repair mechanisms.4 Late cell delivery is also thought to target the delayed
secondary degeneration occurring in remote areas of the brain
such as the ventroposterolateral and ventroposteromedial thalamic nuclei.5,6 In most animal models, the thalamus is spared from
the acute ischemic damage but the region is affected because it
has synaptic connections with the primary injury site. The
widespread corticostriatal damage results in retrograde and
anterograde degeneration,7 which is also associated with atypical
accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid-β
(Aβ) in the thalamus.6 The initially diffuse APP and Aβ staining
becomes later transformed into dense plaque-like deposits in the

thalamus. Interestingly, the APP/Aβ depositions show an overlapping distribution with calcium deposits.8
The secondary pathology in the thalamus takes place in a
delayed manner after the ischemic event and thus represents a
novel target for stroke therapy. The aim of the present work was
to study whether human BMMSCs (1 × 106) infused 2 or 7 days
after MCAO could provide neuronal and/or axonal support and
prevent the secondary pathology in the thalamus.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Sixty male Han:Wistar rats (Harlan, Rehovot, Israel) weighing 313 to 426 g
were used in this study. The rats were housed individually in a controlled
environment (humidity 50% to 60%, temperature 21 ± 1°C, 12:12 hours
light/dark conditions) with free access to fresh water and food. Animals
were handled according to European legislation (86/609/EEC) and all
efforts were made to minimize the number used and animal suffering,
by adhering to the ARRIVE guidelines. The Animal Ethics Committee
(Hämeenlinna, Finland) approved this study.

Transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
The intraluminal ﬁlament technique was used to evoke cerebral ischemia
in the rats.9 Anesthesia was induced by inhalation of 5% halothane in 30%
O2/70% N2O for 2 to 3 minutes and maintained at 0.5% to 1.5% with a nose
mask. Brieﬂy, after a midline neck incision, the right common carotid
artery, internal carotid artery, and external carotid artery (ECA) were
exposed. A heparinized nylon ﬁlament (diameter Ø 0.28 mm) was introduced via the ECA stump into the internal carotid artery until resistance
was experienced (1.8 to 2.1 cm). After a 60-minute occlusion period, the

ﬁlament was gently removed and the ECA was carefully closed by electrocoagulation, leaving a long ECA stump for cell infusion.3

Total Infarct Volume
Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on postoperative days 1 and
43 with a Bruker 7 T horizontal scanner (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) used
for imaging. The ImageJ program was used to analyze infarct volumes
from T2-weighted images.10

Study Design and Experimental Groups
Two rats did not meet pretraining criteria and were excluded. Five of the
operated rats died. Twenty-four hours after surgery, behavioral impairment
of the remaining rats was assessed by the forelimb placing test and then
the animals were subjected to magnetic resonance imaging. Twelve rats
were excluded because of minor behavioral impairment, the presence of
hemorrhage, a very large lesion, or no cortical damage. The exclusion/
inclusion criteria were deﬁned before the experiment. The rest of the
animals were sequentially assigned into the following experimental groups
such that the extent of behavioral impairment and infarct size did not
differ between groups: SHAM+vehicle (n = 11), MCAO+vehicle (n = 12),
MCAO+48 hours BMMSC (n = 11), and MCAO+7 days BMMSC (n = 7). The
cryopreserved and thawed p2 BMMSCs (1 × 106) in 500 μL saline were
infused over a period of 2 minutes into anesthetized rats directly into the
stump of the ECA.3

Sticky Label Test
The sticky label test was used to evaluate sensory function and motor
learning, being performed as previously described.10 Behavioral testing
was performed in a blinded manner. Before testing, the animals were
familiarized with handling and the testing cage. In the test, a white colored
circular label (Ø 9 mm, Tough-Spots, Diversiﬁed Biotech, Dedham, MA,
USA) was placed on the distal–radial region of both wrists and rat was
moved to a test cage. The time until the ﬁrst contact to the label and the
time to remove the label were assessed as the total time. A maximum time
of 120 seconds was set if the rat was not able to remove the label.

Histology
On postoperative day 43, rats were anesthetized with an overdose of
Equithesin (intraperitoneally) followed by perfusion with 0.9% NaCl and 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer. The brains were carefully
removed from the skull, postﬁxed and cryoprotected. Brain sections
(35 μm) were cut using a sliding microtome and stored in antifreeze solution at − 20°C. To assess the thalamic accumulation of Aβ, immunohistochemistry using rabbit anti-rodent antibody (Aβ3-16, #9151, Covance,
Dedham, MA, USA) was performed as previously described.6 Calcium
accumulation in the thalamus after MCAO was assessed by the Alizarin red
method.8

Analysis
Stained brain sections were analyzed in a blind manner with the Adobe
Photoshop CC software (San Jose, CA, USA). Images were captured under
x5 magniﬁcation using Axio Imager.M2 upright microscope (Carl Zeiss
GmbH, Göttingen, Germany) equipped with AxioCam ERc5s camera. In the
analyses, the images were merged together, converted into gray scale, the
thalamus was outlined and area with staining intensity above the
threshold (background) was extracted and measured.

Statistics
The statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS software (IBM,
Armonk, NY, USA). Statistical differences in Aβ and calcium staining
between groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance with
LSD post hoc test, if needed. Correlations between sticky label test and Aβ
and calcium deposition and total infarct size were determined using
Pearson correlation coefﬁcients.

RESULTS
Infarct Size
Variable degrees of cortical infarction usually along with complete
striatal damage were observed in MCAO rats. There were no
differences in the total infarct size detected between the MCAO
groups (100.8 ± 12.7 mm3 in vehicle, 94.5 ± 16.6 mm3 in 48 h cells,
and 112.4 ± 20.3 mm3 in 7 day cells).
Amyloid-β Accumulation in the Ipsilateral Thalamus
We used a rodent-speciﬁc antibody (Aβ3-16) to analyze the
deposition of Aβ in the brains of the experimental animals. The
antibody revealed Aβ-positive deposits varying in size from small,
diffuse granules to large formation (Figures 1B to 1E). There was a
signiﬁcant overall group effect in the Aβ load (F3,32 = 6.481,
Po 0.01). Quantiﬁcation of the area of the deposits showed a
highly signiﬁcant increase in Aβ deposition in the thalamus after
infusion of BMMSCs at 48 hours after MCAO (Figure 1F).
Calcium Accumulation in the Ipsilateral Thalamus
Adjacent brain sections were stained for calcium with the Alizarin
red method. Calcium staining showed an overlapping distribution
pattern in the thalamus as Aβ deposition (Figures 1H to 1K). Also
in the case of the calcium load, there was a signiﬁcant overall
group effect (F3,32 = 3.595, P o0.05), the levels being elevated by
infusion of BMMSCs at 48 hours after MCAO (Figure 1L).
Correlations between Amyloid-β/Calcium and Sensorimotor
Functions
In rats treated with cells 48 hours after MCAO, there was a clear
correlation between impaired forelimb performance on postoperative day 42 and Aβ (Figure 2A) and calcium (Figure 2B)
accumulation in the thalamus. The total time (the time to ﬁrst
contact plus the removal time) correlated with the levels of
accumulation of both Aβ (r = 0.843, P o 0.001) and calcium
(r = 0.780, P o0.01), i.e., more prominent behavioral impairments
were associated with more severe thalamic pathology. No such
correlations were found in the other MCAO groups. There
were no signiﬁcant correlations between total infarct size, Aβ/
calcium load in the thalamus or total time in the sticky label test
(Figure 2C).
DISCUSSION
As far as we are aware, this is the ﬁrst study to have investigated
the effect of cell therapy on delayed secondary pathology after
focal cerebral ischemia. We examined whether intraarterial
infusion of human BMMSCs 48 hours or 7 days after MCAO could
prevent the secondary pathology in the rat thalamus. To our
surprise, we observed an exacerbation of Aβ/calcium aggregation
in the thalamus, particularly when the cells were infused 48 hours
after the MCAO, which may impair long-term behavioral recovery
and mask potentially beneﬁcial therapeutic effects.
This phenomenon was independent of primary lesion size, but
one cannot completely exclude the possibility that there were
secondary lesions caused by BMMSC entrapment in small
capillaries. Instead, it is speculated that altered APP expression,
maturation, and trafﬁcking may contribute to the present results.
Two days after MCAO, APP expression and processing is enhanced
in the perilesional cortex,11 which may be a cellular response to
stress exerting neurotrophic and protective functions.12 Perilesional APP/Aβ labeling disappears with longer follow-up
(≥7 days).6 In addition, APP maturation is enhanced during the
acute phase, indicative of elevations in APP trafﬁcking from the
perilesional cortex via the descending axons to the thalamus.11
Thus, after effective cell homing to ischemic hemisphere after
intraarterial infusion,3 it may be that the presence of BMMSCs at

this particular time point (48 hours) further activates perilesional
corticothalamic neurons, resulting in Aβ and calcium overﬂow in
the thalamus in turn worsening the secondary pathology.
However, one should note that this phenomenon is seen only in
rodent stroke models and thus should not affect patient studies.13

An exacerbation of the secondary pathology in the thalamus is
likely to have detrimental consequences. This is supported by
studies showing treatments that can reduce Aβ accumulation in
the thalamus, e.g., a nonselective calcium channel blocker
(bepridil), are associated with an improved behavioral outcome

in MCAO rats14 and furthermore that thalamus pathology is linked
with the late sensory deﬁcit in MCAO rats.15 The present study is
also consistent with this concept, i.e., the more prominent the
sensorimotor impairment, the more severe the thalamic pathology. More importantly, the intensiﬁed secondary pathology shown
here may mask the therapeutic beneﬁts provided by cell therapy.
Indeed, in our previous study, administration of BMMSCs did not
improve the behavioral recovery in MCAO rats.10
The thalamus is often overlooked in experimental studies of
ischemia. Nonetheless, this region represents a potential target for
therapeutic interventions since it provides an extended time
window for delivery. The present results emphasize the importance of timing of such approaches. While subacute cell therapy
(48 hours) may enhance early brain repair after focal cerebral
ischemia, it also seems to result in a paradoxical exacerbation of
the secondary pathology. This unexpected effect in the rat MCAO
model should be taken into consideration when studying the
optimal therapeutic window as well as in assessments of the
efﬁcacies of cell therapies for stroke.
In summary, the lack of treatment effects in MCAO rats may be
attributable to the abnormal accumulation of Aβ and calcium in
the thalamus, impairing sensory information ﬂow and behavioral
recovery after subacute BMMSC treatment, thus complicating the
assessment of cell therapies in rodent stroke models.
