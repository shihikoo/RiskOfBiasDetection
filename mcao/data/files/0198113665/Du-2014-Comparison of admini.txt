Given that adult adipose tissue is an abundant, accessible and safe source of stem cells, the use of
adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) provides a promising approach in ischemic stroke. The delivery route,
however, for transplantation of ADSCs in clinical application remains controversial regarding the time
window, cell type, safety issues, ‘ﬁrst pass’ effect and therapeutic effect. To determine the optimal administration route in transplantation of ADSCs, we compared the therapeutic effect of the three mainly used
administration routes of ADSCs in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model. Cells isolated
from the adipose tissue of adult rodents were differentiated and characterized in vitro, and further transplanted in vivo by intravenous, intra-arterial or intra-ventricular delivery. The infarct volume, expression
of neurotrophic factors and the neurobehavioral improvements were evaluated after the equal dose of
BrdU labeled ADSCs transplantation. Our results indicated that the equal dose of ADSCs delivered intravenously were effective in improving the neurological outcome and reducing the infarct volume after
ischemic brain injury in long term duration in contrast to intra-arterial and intra-ventricular delivery.
At 1–7 days after transplantation, the increased expression levels of BDNF, VEGF, bFGF, Bcl-2, IL-10 and
decreased levels of caspase-3 and TNF-␣ in the intra-ventricular and intra-arterial groups were signiﬁcant
in contrast to the intravenous group. There was no signiﬁcant difference among the three groups after
7 days. Our ﬁndings suggest that compared with the intra-ventricular delivery, intravascular injection
allows higher dose injection with fewer invasions and appears to be optimal in application with regard
to therapeutic efﬁcacy, safety and feasibility.

Introduction
Stroke is the third leading cause of death worldwide and nearly
half the survivors are left with moderate to severe disabilities that
seriously affect their daily lives (Roger et al., 2011; Lackland et al.,
2014). The lifetime risk of stroke in adults is estimated at 8–10%
(Seshadri et al., 2006). Ischemia accounts for 80% of stroke subtypes. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was once considered an
effective intervention in the treatment of ischemic stroke; however,
fewer than 5% of ischemic patients can receive tPA treatment due to
the risk of hemorrhage and a narrow therapeutic window (Donnan

and Fisher, 2008; Kufner et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014). Therefore, an
effective treatment for ischemic stroke is urgently needed.
With the emergence and development of stem-cell biology and
tissue-engineering technology, grafting stem cells may provide a
means of regenerating nerve tissue damaged by ischemic stroke.
Zuk et al. (2001) isolated a ﬁbroblast-like population of stem cells
with multipotency and self-renewal ability from human adipose
tissue. These are now widely known as adipose-derived stem cells
(ADSCs) (Zuk et al., 2001). As adult adipose tissue is an abundant, accessible and safe source of stem cells, the use of ADSCs
circumvents ethical and immunological concerns and provides
a promising application of stem-cell therapy for stroke patients
(Mitchell et al., 2006; Kim and de Vellis, 2009; Mahmoudifar and
Doran, 2010). However, the choice of delivery route for stemcell transplantation remains controversial among clinicians, with
debate over treatment windows, cell types, safety, the ‘ﬁrst-pass’
effect and therapeutic outcomes (Meamar et al., 2013).

Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the therapeutic effects of three major routes for the administration of ADSCs,
using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model. The
cells were isolated, differentiated and characterized in vitro. Infarct
volume, expression of neurotrophic factors and neurobehavioral
improvements were evaluated after the transplantation of BrdUlabeled ADSCs by intravenous, intra-arterial and intraventricular
delivery routes.
Materials and methods
Animals
Pathogen-free, adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing
260–280 g were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center
of the First Teaching Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University. All
the animals were housed in polycarbonate cages containing wood
shavings in an air-conditioned room (12/12-h light/dark cycle with
humidity of 60 ± 10%, 22 ± 4 ◦ C), with unlimited access to food pellets and water. The protocols for the experimental study received
the approval of the Ethics Committee of the First Teaching Hospital
of Xinjiang Medical University.
Isolation, culturing and characterization of ADSCs
The ADSCs were isolated from the adipose tissue of the rats as
previously described, with some modiﬁcations (Zuk et al., 2002). In
brief, subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained from the inguinal
regions of male SD rats euthanized with 10% chloral hydrate
(350 mg/kg, i.p.). The isolated adipose tissue was washed three
times with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove contaminating debris and blood cells. The washed tissue was minced
and digested with 0.075% collagenase (Type I, Sigma–Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) at 37 ◦ C in a water-bath shaker with gentle agitation for 40 min. Collagenase activity was neutralized with an equal
volume of low-glucose Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (lDMEM, Thermo Scientiﬁc, HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone, USA) and antibiotics (100 U/ml
penicillin G, 100 g/ml streptomycin, Sigma–Aldrich, USA). The undigested tissue was removed by ﬁltration through a 200-mesh ﬁlter.
The ﬁltrate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The pellet was
resuspended in l-DMEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics, then
cultivated for 24 h at 37 ◦ C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After the
unattached cells and debris had been removed, fresh l-DMEM
medium was added to the adherent cells, which were then continuously cultured at 37 ◦ C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The medium was
changed for the ﬁrst time after 24 h, and thereafter every 3 days.
When the cell density of the colonies reached approximately 90%
conﬂuence, the cells were digested with 0.25% Trypsin (HyClone,
USA) and then passaged at a ratio of 1:2. The third generation of
ADSCs was collected for use in subsequent experiments.
Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out to determine
the identity of the isolated cells by assessing their surface markers. Brieﬂy, the cultured ADSC cells (passage 3) were harvested
and washed three times with PBS solution. Next, they were ﬁxed
in cold acetone for 8 min, washed three times with PBS, treated
with 3% H2 O2 for 10 min and again washed three times with
PBS. The diluted primary antibodies (CD34 and CD44, Boster
Bio-engineering, Wuhan, China) were consecutively added to the
sample overnight during incubation in a 4 ◦ C humid-chamber.
Polymer enhancer was added sequentially to the sample at room
temperature for 10 min. After being washed three times with
PBS, the samples were visualized with a fresh preparation of
diaminobenzidine (DAB). The nuclei were stained with hematoxylin, and the samples were mounted in a glycerine-gelatin

mountant and observed under a phase-contrast microscope. Photographs were taken using a digital camera.
Differentiation of ADSCs in vitro
Adipogenic differentiation and identiﬁcation of ADSCs: the cultured ADSC cells (passage 3) were harvested and seeded into 6-well
plates with sterilized coverslips at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well,
and then cultured in an adipogenic-induction medium, namely a
DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 ␮mol/L
dexamethasone (Sigma, USA) and 10 ␮mol/L insulin (Sigma, USA).
The culture medium was changed every 3 days. After 14 days of
induction, the culture slide was stained with Oil Red O. The sample was mounted with glycerine-gelatin mountant and observed
under a phase-contrast microscope. Photographs were taken using
a digital camera.
Neuronal differentiation and identiﬁcation of ADSCs
The cultured cells (passage 3) were harvested and seeded into
6-well plates with sterilized coverslips at a density of 1 × 105
cells per well, and then cultured in a neural stem cell induction
medium. After a week, the neural stem cell induction medium was
exchanged for a DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine
serum for further development. Half of this culture medium was
replaced every 2 days. The expression of non-speciﬁc esterase (NSE)
was identiﬁed by immunohistochemical analysis.
Animal grouping and transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion
One hundred male adult SD rats were randomly divided into ﬁve
groups: (1) a sham group; (2) a middle cerebral artery occlusion
group; (3) a ventricular-transplantation group; (4) an arterialtransplantation group; and (5) a venous-transplantation group
(n = 20 per group). The modiﬁed Longa method was used to establish a transient focal cerebral ischemia model (Longa et al., 1989).
In brief, all of the rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate
(350 mg/kg, i.p.), and a feedback-regulated water-heating system
was used to maintain their rectal temperature at 37 ◦ C. The right
common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA) and
internal carotid artery (ICA) of each rat were exposed via a midline
neck incision. The tip of a 4–0 nylon monoﬁlament was rounded
by heating over a ﬂame and coated with silicone. To occlude the
origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), the monoﬁlament was
moved carefully into the ICA lumen via the ECA lumen until a slight
resistance was felt. After 1.5 h, the suture was slowly withdrawn
to allow reperfusion. The rats in the sham group received all of the
surgical procedures in the absence of a suture.
Cell labeling and delivery routes for transplantation
At passage 3, the attached ADSCs were cultured with 20 ␮mol/L
BrdU at 37 ◦ C and 5% CO2 for 48 h. The ADSCs labeled with BrdU
were collected and counted. Cells at concentrations of 5 × 1010 L−1
and 1 × 109 L−1 were prepared for transplantation.
At 24 h after MCAO modeling, the rats were anesthetized
with i.p. injections of 10% chloral hydrate. The rats in the
intraventricular-transplantation group were ﬁxed in a stereotaxic
apparatus. A 1-mm hole was made in the skull of each rat with a
dental drill, and 10 ␮L of BrdU-labeled ADSCs (5 × 1010 L−1 ) were
injected into the right lateral ventricle at the following coordinates: 0.8 mm posterior, 1.5 mm lateral and 4.0 mm ventral to the
bregma. In the intra-arterial transplantation group, the ECA stump
was exposed and 0.5 mL of BrdU-labeled ADSCs (1 × 109 L−1 ) were

slowly infused through the stump while the blood ﬂow of the common carotid artery (CCA) was blocked by a microvascular clip. In the
intravenous-transplantation group, 0.5 mL of BrdU-labeled ADSCs
(1 × 109 L−1 ) were infused through the tail vein with a 1-mL syringe.
A total of 5 × 105 cells per rat were injected in each group.
Measurement of neurological deﬁcit
All of the animals underwent behavioral tests before transplantation and at 1, 7, 14 and 21 days after transplantation, administered
by an experimenter who was blind to the experimental protocol.
Following Longa et al. (1989), the neurological ﬁndings were scored
on the following 5-point scale. A score of 0 indicated no neurologic
deﬁcit; a score of 1 (failure to extend left forepaw fully) indicated a
mild focal neurologic deﬁcit; a score of 2 (circling to the left) indicated a moderate focal neurologic deﬁcit; and a score of 3 (falling
to the left) indicated a severe focal deﬁcit. Rats that were unable
to walk spontaneously and had a depressed level of consciousness
were given a score of 4. The MCAO rats with scores between 1 and
3 were selected and organized into three transplantation groups.
Measurement of infarct volume
Before transplantation and at 7, 14 and 21 days after transplantation, the rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate
and transcardially infused with heparinised PBS followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brain tissues were rapidly removed,
sliced into six 2-mm-thick coronal sections and stained with 2% 2, 3,
5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA) solution at 37 ◦ C for 30 min. The stained slides were washed in
PBS solution for 5 min and immersed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde. The areas unstained by TTC were identiﬁed as the areas of
infarction. The infarction volume was presented as a percentage
of the volume of the contralateral hemisphere. ImageJ software
(NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used to analyze the percentage of
TTC-stained tissue with respect to the whole piece of tissue.
Immunohistochemistry
At 1, 7, 14 and 21 days after cell transplantation, the rats
were perfused transcardially with heparinized PBS followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for immunohistochemical analysis. The
rat brains were removed and post-ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
at least 24 h. Next, the brain tissue was dehydrated, embedded in
parafﬁn wax and cut into 5-␮m thick sections. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to identify the BrdU-positive cells using
rabbit anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (B8434, Sigma–Aldrich,
USA) at a dilution of 1:250. All of these procedures followed
the manufacturers’ instructions for the use of EliVisionTM and
an IHC kit (Maixin Biological, Fuzhou, China). The reaction products were visualized using 3,3 -diaminobenzidine (DAB Substrate
Kit, SK4100, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Positively
stained cells from ﬁve randomly chosen regions per section at the
edge of ischemic areas were counted manually under high-power

magniﬁcation. An Olympus IX70 microscope was used to acquire
and process the images.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR)
The expression levels of BDNF, VEGF, bFGF, Bcl-2, Caspase-3
TNF-␣ and IL-10 were measured using real-time PCR. Total RNA
was extracted from the tissue of the infarcted border zones using
Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and reverse-transcribed into
cDNA. The genes of the measured cytokines were ampliﬁed using
the primers listed in Table 1. The ampliﬁcation of the housekeeping
gene ␤-actin cDNA was used as an internal control.
Statistical analysis
All the data were presented as mean values ± standard errors.
Signiﬁcant differences were determined by one-way analysis of
variance (one-way ANOVA), followed by Bonferroni-Dunn post hoc
tests or paired t-tests for comparison between groups, using SPSS
17.0 (SPSS Inc., IBM, Chicago, IL, USA). The behavioral scores were
analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U test. A p-value of 0.05 was
considered the threshold for a signiﬁcant difference.
Results
Morphology and surface markers of ADSCs
The primary cultured ADSCs had a rounded, elliptical shape, and
the attached cells were spindle-shaped with large oval nuclei, one
or few nucleoli and multiple extensions. The cells grew in colonies
and were arranged uniformly. The primary cultured cells reached
90% conﬂuence between 7 and 9 days (Fig. 1A). The subculture
cells had become attached within 24 h and were uniformly distributed, approaching conﬂuence between 3 and 5 days (Fig. 1B).
An immunohistochemical method was used to analyze the cellsurface antigens of the ADSCs. The cells were positive for CD44
and negative for CD34 (Fig. 1C and D). The majority of the cells displayed a highly proliferative spindle morphology and mesenchymal
stem-cell characteristics.
Adipogenic differentiation of cultured ADSCs
The induced ADSCs formed polygon shapes at 3 days after adipogenic differentiation (Fig. 2A). After 5 days, the cells produced
small vacuoles containing lipid droplets (Fig. 2B). After 8–10 days,
larger lipid droplets had formed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C). After 14
days, the intracellular lipid droplets were identiﬁed as positive red
loci using Oil Red O. staining (Fig. 2D).
Neuronal differentiation of cultured ADSCs and expression
of NSE
After neuronal differentiation with a neuron-induction medium,
the ADSCs displayed changes in neuronal appearance, such as
the formation of dendrite-like extensions and the development of
multiple-cell processes (Fig. 2E). They also stained positive for NSE
(Fig. 2F).

ADSC transplantation attenuated neurological deﬁcits
At 1 day after ADSC transplantation, there were no signiﬁcant differences in the neurological-deﬁcit scores of the three
transplantation groups and the MCAO group (p > 0.05). In each
of the three transplantation groups, however, neurological deﬁcit
decreased with time, especially at 7 and 14 days after treatment.
The neurological-deﬁcit scores were signiﬁcantly lower in the
intraventricular and intra-arterial transplantation groups than in
the intravenous group (p < 0.05) at 7 and 14 days after transplantation. After 21 days, neurological deﬁcit had decreased signiﬁcantly
in all of the three transplantation groups, compared with the MCAO
group (p < 0.05), but there were no signiﬁcant differences between
the three transplantation groups (Table 2).
ADSC transplantation reduced infarct volume
The lesion volume of cerebral infarction was evaluated by TTC
staining before transplantation and at 7, 14 and 21 days after transplantation. The normal brain tissue showed deep red staining, and
areas of infarction were pale gray and unstained. No infarction was

observed in the sham group (Fig. 3A). In the three transplantation
groups, infarct volume reduced signiﬁcantly at 7, 14 and 21 days
after transplantation in comparison with the volume recorded for
the MCAO group before transplantation (42.65 ± 3.68%; Fig. 3B and
C, p < 0.05). After 7 days, infarct volume in the intraventricular and
intra-arterial transplantation groups decreased signiﬁcantly compared with that in the intravenous group (Fig. 3C, p < 0.05). After
14 days of transplantation, there were no signiﬁcant differences
between the three transplantation groups (Fig. 3C).

BrdU-conjugated ADSCs expressed in vivo
The presence of BrdU-positive cells with brown intracellular
particles in the infarcted border zone (IBZ) was assessed over
time. The number of BrdU-positive cells in the three transplantation groups increased with time and approached its peak at 14
days after transplantation (Fig. 4A). The number of BrdU-positive
cells in the intraventricular and intra-arterial groups increased signiﬁcantly in comparison with the number of BrdU-positive cells
in the intravenous group (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4B–D). There were no

signiﬁcant differences in the number of BrdU-positive cells
between the intraventricular and intra-arterial groups at any of the
time points (Fig. 4A).

ADSC transplantation improved the expression of BDNF,
VEGF, bFGF, Bcl-2 and IL-10 mRNA, and decreased the
expression of caspase-3 and TNF-˛ mRNA in vivo
To investigate the mechanism by which the grafted ADSCs
improved neurological functioning, the expression of factors of
neurotrophy apoptosis and inﬂammation were measured over time
using real-time PCR. The expression of BDNF, VEGF and bFGF in
the three transplantation groups increased with time (Fig. 5). The
mRNA levels of BDNF reached a peak at day 7 and reduced after 21
days; they were higher in the intraventricular and intra-arterial
groups than in the intravenous transplantation group at day 7
(p < 0.05) (Fig. 5A). The mRNA levels of VEGF and bFGF reached peak
values at 14 days and reduced from 21 days onwards, but there

were no signiﬁcant differences in these values between the three
groups (Fig. 5B and C). At 1 day after transplantation, Bcl-2 and IL-10
showed a signiﬁcant increase in expression in the intraventricular and intra-arterial groups, while caspase-3 and TNF-␣ showed a
signiﬁcant decrease in expression; however, the changes in these
values in the intravenous group were not signiﬁcant (p < 0.05)
(Fig. 5D–F). There were no signiﬁcant differences in the expression
of Bcl-2, IL-10 or TNF-␣ between the three groups after 7 days.

Discussion
Necrosis and apoptosis are two types of neuronal death induced
by ischemic stroke. Necrosis usually occurs in the infarct core, while
apoptosis appears in the periphery of the necrotic core region,
deﬁned as the ischemic penumbra (IP), with prolonged ischemic
duration (Kametsu et al., 2003). The subjection of the IP area to
a series of cellular processes such as apoptosis, inﬂammation and
oxidative stress leads to the expansion of the infarct core and the

was unstained, white and with a distinct border (A). In the transplantation groups, infarct volume decreased signiﬁcantly in comparison with infarct volume in the MCAO
group (B). (C) The infarct volumes of the three transplantation groups at 7, 14 and 21 days after transplantation reduced signiﬁcantly in comparison with the volume recorded
for the non-treated MCAO group (# p < 0.05 vs. the MCAO group). The infarct volumes of the intraventricular and intra-arterial groups at 7 days after transplantation decreased
signiﬁcantly compared with that of the intravenous group (*p < 0.05 vs. venous group).

subsequent worsening of neurological function. Therefore, the IP
has been widely accepted as the target of attempts to extend the
time available for therapy and reverse the clinical outcome (RamosCabrer et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013; Pillai et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014).
Recently, however, researchers have emphasized the beneﬁts of
ADSC transplantation in the treatment of experimental ischemic
stroke, due to its neuroprotective effects. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are still poorly understood (Kim
et al., 2007; Fang et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2014).
Previous studies have demonstrated that grafted ADSCs survive
and express neural-lineage markers such as neuron markers
(Synaptophysin, NF) and glia-cell markers (GFAP, Olig-2) in the
brain after experimental MCAO injury (Kang et al., 2003; Leu et al.,
2010; Gutierrez-Fernandez et al., 2013). Some of the inﬂammatory
and apoptosis factors were found to be related to the neurodegeneration and normal aging of human brain (Lu et al., 2005).
Several researchers have reported that ADSC transplantation has

a neuroprotective effect via the secretion of neurotrophic factors
such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF),
as well as IL-1␤, Bcl-2, TNF-␣, caspase-12 et al., which are involved
in anti-apoptotic and anti-inﬂammatory signaling pathways (Sun
et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012; Gutierrez-Fernandez et al., 2013; Jeon
et al., 2013). Transplantation of HGF-transduced mesenchymal
stem cells was more beneﬁcial in functional improvement in
ischemic stroke mice than transplantation of mesenchymal stem
cells alone (Liu et al., 2010). The results of this study demonstrated
that ADSCs isolated from adult rodent adipose tissue display
a highly proliferative spindle morphology and mesenchymal
stem-cell characteristics with positive expression of CD44 and
negative expression of CD34. The cells were also found to be
capable of differentiating into adipocytes with positive Oil Red O
staining and neuron-like cells that stain positive for NSE. Similar
to previous studies, this study showed that ADSCs transplanted

Fig. 4. The expression of BrdU-positive cells in the infarcted border zones was immunohistochemically analyzed for each of the three transplantation groups. (A) In all
three of the transplantation groups, the number of BrdU-positive cells increased with time; signiﬁcant increases were observed in the intraventricular and intra-arterial
transplantation groups (# p < 0.05 vs. venous group; *p < 0.05 vs. venous group). The expression of BrdU-positive cells was observed in the IBZ at 14 days after treatment in
the intra-arterial transplantation group (B), the intraventricular group (C) and the intravenous group (D). All micrographs at same magniﬁcation: scale bar = 100 ␮m.

via different administration routes can migrate into the infarcted
border zone (IBZ) or the ischemic penumbra (IP), where they
attenuate neurological deﬁcit (thereby protecting against ischemic
injury) and reduce infarct volume. In addition, ADSC implantation
was found to markedly increase the expression of BDNF, VEGF,
bFGF, Bcl-2 and IL-10 and to signiﬁcantly down-regulate the
expression of caspase-3 and TNF-␣, which are related to the
inhibition of neuronal apoptosis and inﬂammation. These may
be the very mechanisms whereby grafted ADSCs exert their
therapeutic effects against occlusion due to cerebral ischemic
injury.
With regard to safety and efﬁciency, the choice of delivery routes for cell transplantation is one of the most important
issues in the clinical application of stem-cell therapy. Three main
routes: intraparenchymal, intravascular and intracisternal, have so
far been used in clinical trials. Intraparenchymal transplantation
may involve ipsilateral or contralateral-hemisphere transplantation. Among the possible intravascular routes are intravenous and
intra-arterial delivery routes. Intracisternal transplantation may
be carried out by intracerebroventricular or intrathecal injection.
To date, there is no conclusive evidence for the optimal delivery route for stem-cell therapy. Intraparenchymal transplantation
has been used less often in recent clinical trials due to severe
reported side effects such as seizures, worsening motor symptoms
and chronic subdural hematoma, as well as tumorigenicity concerns (Savitz et al., 2005). The most widely used delivery routes
are intracerebroventricular, intra-arterial and intravenous. According to previous studies, both the intracerebroventricular and the
intrathecal delivery of ADSCs markedly attenuate the damage

caused by cerebral or spinal ischemic injury in rats. Both delivery methods reduce infarct volume, modulate microglia, increase
the expression of neurotrophic factors, improve neurological motor
function and decrease neuronal apoptosis (Kang et al., 2003; Cho
et al., 2012; Chung et al., 2012; Gutierrez-Fernandez et al., 2013;
Moon et al., 2014). In addition, the migration of bone marrow stem
cells were found in the areas of ischemia after ventricular delivery
into the ischemia stroke mice model (Poon et al., 2006). Intraarterial delivery seems the more attractive of the two intravascular
routes, as it is associated with a high cerebral engraftment rate
(Walczak et al., 2008). However, the intra-arterial transplantation
of ADSCs has received less attention in animal studies than intraventricular ADSC transplantation. Using a model of traumatic brain
injury in rats, Lu et al. (2001) found that the intra-arterial implantation of mesenchymal stem cells yields a higher distribution rate
of these cells in the injury boundary zone, corpus callosum and
cortex of the ipsilateral hemisphere. Although concerns have been
raised about the inadequate migration rate of intravenous delivery
due to the ﬁltering effect of the pulmonary vascular system, intravenous routes are commonly used in clinical trials because they are
less invasive and more accessible than other forms of delivery. The
results of animal studies using experimental intracerebral hemorrhage rat models have shown that intravenously transplanted
mesenchymal stem cells migrate to the peri-hematoma areas, differentiate into neurons and astrocytes and improve functional
performance (Jeong et al., 2003). Evidence has also been provided
for the presence of intravenously delivered stem cells in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum of the adult host
(Brazelton et al., 2000).

Fig. 5. ADSC transplantation improved the expression of the neural trophic factor BDNF at 7, 14, and 21 days (A); it improved the expression of VEGF (B) and bFGF (C) at
14 days; and it improved the expression of the inﬂammatory factors Bcl-2 (D) and IL-10 (G) at 1 day. It decreased the expression of the apoptosis factors caspase-3 (E) and
TNF-␣ (F) at 1 day and 7 days (*p < 0.05 vs. MCAO group; # p < 0.05 vs. venous group).

In this study, intra-arterial injected ADSCs were found to
exhibit a greater migratory ability and a larger migration range
in the infarct core and border zone than ADSCs administered by
intraventricular or intravenous delivery routes. ADSCs delivered
intra-arterially, intraventricularly and intravenously were all found
to signiﬁcantly reduce infarct volume and improve neurological
functioning. Although the intra-arterial and intraventricular groups
affected faster functional recovery and greater lesion-area reduction at 7 and 14 days after treatment, there were no signiﬁcant
long-term differences between the three groups.
The results of a qPCR test used to measure the expression of
neurotrophic factors, Bcl-2, IL-10, caspase-3 and TNF-␣ showed
enhanced neurotrophic, anti-apoptotic and anti-inﬂammatory
effects in all three groups, with higher expression levels of BDNF

in the intraventricular and intra-arterial groups than in the intravenous transplantation group during the acute phase (up to day 7).
However, there were no signiﬁcant differences in the expression
of neurotrophic factors, Bcl-2, IL-10 or TNF-␣ between the three
groups after 7 days. The delay in the elevation of expression caused
by intravenous transplantation may be due to the lengthy migration of intravenously delivered cells. However, our results indicated
that in the long term, an equal dose of ADSCs delivered intravenously is equally effective in improving neurological outcome
and reducing infarct volume after ischemic brain injury. Blood brain
barrier damage and chemotactic factors induced by ischemic tissue
may facilitate the migration of intravenously administered ADSCs
from the systemic circulation to the infarct site (Wang et al., 2002).
The up-regulation of neurotrophic factors and the modulation of

G. Du et al. / Acta Histochemica 116 (2014) 1075–1084

Bcl-2, IL-10 and TNF-␣, which are involved in anti-inﬂammatory
and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways, may partially explain the
neuroprotective effect of intravenously transplanted ADSCs in rats
with MCAO. Further study will be needed to identify the exact
mechanisms whereby the grafted cells migrate to the infarct border
zone and activate intracellular response after transplantation.
In summary, intravascular injection allows higher doses to be
administered less invasively than intraventricular delivery, and
appears to be the optimal method for clinical application in terms
of its therapeutic efﬁcacy, safety and feasibility.
