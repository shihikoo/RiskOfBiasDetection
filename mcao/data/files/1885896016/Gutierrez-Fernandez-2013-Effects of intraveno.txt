Abstract
Introduction: Stem cell therapy can promote good recovery from stroke. Several studies have demonstrated that
mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are safe and effective. However, more information regarding appropriate cell type is
needed from animal model. This study was targeted at analyzing the effects in ischemic stroke of acute
intravenous (i.v.) administration of allogenic bone marrow- (BM-MSC) and adipose-derived-stem cells (AD-MSC) on
functional evaluation results and brain repair markers.
Methods: Allogenic MSC (2 × 106 cells) were administered intravenously 30 minutes after permanent middle
cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) to rats. Infarct volume and cell migration and implantation were analyzed by
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and immunohistochemistry. Function was evaluated by the Rogers and rotarod
tests, and cell proliferation and cell-death were also determined. Brain repair markers were analyzed by confocal
microscopy and confirmed by western blot.
Results: Compared to infarct group, function had significantly improved at 24 h and continued at 14 d after i.v.
administration of either BM-MSC or AD-MSC. No reduction in infarct volume or any migration/implantation of cells
into the damaged brain were observed. Nevertheless, cell death was reduced and cellular proliferation significantly
increased in both treatment groups with respect to the infarct group. At 14 d after MSC administration vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), synaptophysin (SYP), oligodendrocyte (Olig-2) and neurofilament (NF) levels were
significantly increased while those of glial fiibrillary acid protein (GFAP) were decreased.
Conclusions: i.v. administration of allogenic MSC - whether BM-MSC or AD-MSC, in pMCAO infarct was associated
with good functional recovery, and reductions in cell death as well as increases in cellular proliferation,
neurogenesis, oligodendrogenesis, synaptogenesis and angiogenesis markers at 14 days post-infarct.

Introduction
Stem cell therapy offers promising results for stroke
patients but its efficacy has not yet been confirmed in
the first clinical trials [1]. Important recommendations
concerning the time of administration, the best routes
of administration and cell sources as well as the use of
different experimental animal models prior to starting
clinical trials have been made in recent years to better
identify the best options for stem cell therapy in stroke
patients [2-4].
Although the optimum administration time is unclear
[5] and previous reports have focused on post acutephase intervention [6], promising experimental animal
data suggest that early stem cell administration can interrupt the initiation of the very beginning of the ischemic
cascade [7,8]. In regard to the type of administration,
experimental animal studies have shown autologous
administration to be safe and effective [9]. The main limitation is that stem cell preparation takes time, so autologous cells can only be administered several weeks after
an unexpected stroke. Nevertheless it is important to act
in the acute phase, so allogenic administration may be a
good alternative. In many experimental animal studies,
the acute use of cells from the same species has been
shown to be safe and has not produced rejection [10].
It was originally thought that stem cells needed to be
placed within the damaged sites of the brain after ischemia in order to promote recovery. From this perspective
putative administration routes have been focused on
intra-arterial [11], intrastriatal [12], intracerebral [13] or
intraventricular alternatives [14]. However, the possibility
that the cells need not be in the brain itself for recovery
to be achieved would allow the use of less invasive methods, such as intravenous (i.v.) administration [8].
In any case, one of the main questions is to identify the
best source for stem cells that can be used after stroke,
and this needs to be addressed by comparative studies
under different conditions. The different stem cell types
to be tested include embryonic, hematopoietic, neural
and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) [7,15-17]. The most
promising of these are MSC since they can be derived
from bone marrow (BM-MSC), or adipose tissue (ADMSC). Both tissues are very abundant, easy to obtain and
do not pose logistic or ethical problems [6,9,12]. In a
recent comparative study of transitory ischemia in mice,
i.v. administration of either BM-MSC or AD-MSC promoted recovery [18]. That study observed higher levels of
angiopoietin-1 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in
the AD-MSC group compared with those receiving BMMSC at 24 h after i.v. cell administration but it only
employed MSC at 24 h and 48 h after transitory ischemia. We have previously shown that administration of
allogenic BM-MSC promotes functional recovery and

Page 2 of 12

also augments expression levels of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) in the brain after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) in adult rats [8].
However, the effects of allogenic BM-MSC and AD-MSC
administration on functional recovery and the levels of
brain repair markers associated with neurogenesis, oligodendrogenesis, synaptogenesis and angiogenesis at 14 d
have not yet been examined in the pMCAO model.
We hypothesize that acute i.v. administration of allogenic AD-MSC would be as effective as that of allogenic
BM-MSC after pMCAO in adult rats.
The present study compared the therapeutic potential
of MSC from both cell sources for improving functional
recovery, decreasing tissue damage and increasing brain
repair associated markers at 14 d after pMCAO in rats.

Materials and methods
Animal ethics

The procedure was carried out at our Cerebrovascular
and Neuroscience Research Laboratory, La Paz University
Hospital, Madrid, Spain. All experiments were performed
in compliance with our medical school’s Ethical Committee for the Care and Use of Animals in Research. The
experiments were designed to use the smallest number of
animals and to minimize their suffering in accordance
with the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration of
1975. The investigators responsible for functional evaluation and the molecular and histological studies were
blinded to the treatment groups.
Study design
Isolation of mesenchymal stem cells

Cultures were made of BM-MSC obtained from the tibia
and femur of adult female Sprague-Dawley (250-300 g)
rats that had been sacrificed by cardiac injection of potassium chloride (0.5 ml) as described previously [8]. First,
both bones were placed in alcohol for 10 minutes and
then in Hank’s (1X) balanced salt solution (HBSS, Gibco,
Paisley, UK) for 30 minutes. The bones were cut and bone
marrow removed, 10 ml of this tissue was placed in 50 ml
of DMEM 1X solution (DMEM Glu/Pyr, Gibco) with
75 μl penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
MO, USA) and 20% FBS (PAA Laboratories, GmbH,
Pasching, Austria). Next, cells were washed and centrifuged twice at 390 g for 8 minutes at room temperature.
The cells were placed in 75-cm2 flasks (Nunc, Roskilde,
Denmark)) and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 3 to
4 weeks. The culture medium was replaced approximately
every 3 days. When cells reached 80 to 90% confluence,
they were trypsinized using Trypsin-EDTA 0. 05% (Gibco)
and expanded in another 75-cm2 flask. On the third pass
they were trypsinized and counted before being administered to the experimental animals.

Lipoaspirates from adult female Sprague-Dawley (250
to 300 g) were washed with sterile PBS and digested with
an equal volume of 0.075% type I collagenase (SigmaAldrich,). The filtered cells were centrifuged at 390 g for
10 minutes and contaminating erythrocytes were
removed to isolate the stromal vascular fraction (SVF).
On the third pass they were trypsinized and counted
before being administered to the experimental animals.

Physiological monitoring

Characterization of MSC

Intravenous injections of 2 × 10 6 MSC in 650 μl saline
were administered over 4 minutes through the femoral
vein. Infarct animals underwent cerebral ischemia as in
the treated animals but received only a saline infusion
through the femoral vein. Sham-operated animals
received the saline infusion through the femoral vein but
did not undergo cerebral ischemia. The sham-operated
and infarct groups both received a single 650 μl saline
infusion without MSCs over 4 minutes. Either the saline
or MSC solution was administered in the acute phase 30
minutes after common carotid artery reperfusion. The
route, dose and timing of administration have been used
in a previous study [8].

At the time the cells were obtained, the cultures were
characterized to confirm the presence or absence of
MSC surface markers using the flow cytometric technique and analyzed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS). The cells were incubated for 20 minutes at 4°C
in the dark with the following antibodies: CD90-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK),
CD29-Phycoerythrin (PE) (AbD Serotec), CD45-PE (AbD
Serotec) and CD11b-PE (AbD Serotec). Matched isotype
controls were purchased from Biolegend (Biolegend, San
Diego, CA, USA). At least 1 × 104 cells per sample were
acquired and analyzed.

In all animals, the femoral artery was cannulated during
surgery and ischemia, to allow continuous monitoring of
physiological parameters (glycemia, blood gases and
blood pressure) (Monitor Omicron ALTEA RGB medical
devices, Madrid, Spain). Cranial and body temperature
were also monitored and maintained at 36.5 ± 0.5°C.
Cell administration

Subjects

Subjects were adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, with an
average body weight range of 250 to 320 g (Harlan Iberica
SL, Barcelona, Spain). Animals were housed with free
access to food and water at a room temperature of 21 ±
SD 2°C, relative humidity of 45 ± 15% and a light/dark
cycle of 12 h (7:00 to 19:00).
Experimental groups

The animals were randomly assigned to one of four
experimental groups with 10 animals in each study group:
group 1, the sham-operated group, underwent surgery
without infarct and received a saline solution via the
femoral vein; group 2, the iInfarct group, underwent surgery with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
(pMCAO) and received the saline infusion via the femoral
vein; group 3, the BM-MSC group, underwent pMCAO
surgery and received a BM-MSC infusion via the femoral
vein; and group 4, the AD-MSC group, underwent
pMCAO surgery and received an AD-MSC infusion via
the femoral vein.
Surgical procedure

Anesthesia was induced by intraperitoneal injection of a
solution of ketamine (25 mg/kg), diazepam (2 mg/kg),
and atropine (0.1 mg/kg) at a dose of 2.5 ml/kg. Analgesia was provided by meloxicam 2 mg/kg by a subcutaneous route. A small craniectomy was made above the
rhinal fissure over the branch of the right middle cerebral
artery (MCA). The MCA branch was permanently ligated
just before its bifurcation into the frontal and parietal
branches with a 9-0 suture. Both common carotid
arteries were then occluded for 60 minutes as previously
described [8].

In vivo analyses
Functional evaluation scales

In all animals functional evaluation scales were performed at baseline and at 24 h and 14 d after surgery. All
rats were evaluated using a variant of the Rogers scale
[8,19-21] and the rotarod test. The Rogers scale scores
functional status as follows: no deficit (0); failure to
extend left forepaw (1); decreased grip of the left forelimb
when the tail is pulled (2); spontaneous movement in all
directions, contralateral circling if pulled (3); circling or
walking to the left (4); movement only when stimulated
(5); unresponsive to stimulation (6); and dead (7). The
rotarod test was used to evaluate the motor performance
of the rats. Beginning three days before pMCAO, rats
were trained on an accelerating (4 to 40 rpm) rotarod.
All animals received a 3-day training program consisting
of three sessions per day, and the time each animal
remained on the rotarod was measured. Before surgery
on the experimental day, the time spent moving on the
rotarod without falling was measured twice per animal
with a 15-minutes interval between each trial. The mean
of the two trials was calculated for each rat [22].
Migration and implantation of stem cells by magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI)

MSC were magnetically labeled using Endorem™
(superparamagnetic iron oxide). (Guerbet, Roissy CdG
Cedex, France). Both migration and implantation of the
stem cells were analyzed at 24 hours and 14 d by MRI
with T2 maps (flash sequence). Endorem™(Guerbet)labeled MSC were transplanted into five animals in each
group.

Measurement of volume of ischemic lesion by MRI

Lesion volume was analyzed at 24 h and 14 days after
surgery by MRI (Bruker Pharmascan, Ettlingen,
Germany), (7 Tesla horizontal bore magnets) using T2
maps (RARE 8 T2, 180° flip angle, three averages). Ten
contiguous coronal slices (thickness, 1 mm) were acquired
with a field of view of 35 × 35 mm and a matrix size of
256 × 256 (repetition time (TR) 3000 ms, echo time (TE)
29.5 ms, imaging time 25.5 minutes, three averages). All
images were processed using the J 1.42 Image program
(NIH software, Bethesda, MD, USA). After contrast adjustment, the contours of the hemispheres were traced manually on each slice. The infarct volumes were estimated by
integrating the partial measurements derived from the
cross-sectional areas and the distance between sections.
To correct for the brain edema effect, lesion volume was
determined by an indirect method:
Infarct area = (Area of the intact contralateral hemisphere) - (Area of the intact ipsilateral hemisphere) [23].
Then lesion volume was expressed as a percentage of
the intact contralateral hemispheric volume.
Post-mortem analyses
Migration and implantation of stem cells by DiI

MSC were labeled with DiI (Celltracker CM-DiI, Molecular Probes ™, Eugene, Oregon, USA) prior to administration and then, migration and implantation were analyzed
at 14 d post-administration using immunofluorescence.
The DiI (Molecular Probes ™)-labeled MSC were administered into five animals in each treatment group.
Measurement of volume of ischemic lesion by H&E

Lesion size was estimated with H&E staining of brain
sections at 14 d. Infarction volume was expressed as the
percentage of brain tissue affected by ischemia in the
right hemisphere as evaluated on 10-μm-thick sections.
Brains were sectioned at the optic chiasma and at the
infundibular stalk. The resultant brain block from
between these two cuts was placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h and 30% sacarose PBS buffer for 3 days.
Optimal cutting temperature (OCT)-embedded samples
were coronally sectioned in 10-μm-thick slices. Every
twentieth slice, that is, a total of four of these slices
(numbers 1, 21, 41 and 61), separated from each other by
100 μm, were stained with H&E, which reveals an
ischemic area as a well-defined pale region. A digitized
image was made of these slices (Epson Perfection 1260
scanner, Suwa, Nagano, Japan) and used to automatically
measure the ischemic area (Image Pro plus 4.0, Media
Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA) [8,20,24]. Lesion
volume was determined using the method described in
MRI measurement of volume of ischemic lesion.
Cell death

Apoptotic cell death was detected by biotin-dUTP nick
end-labeling mediated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl

Page 4 of 12

transferase (TUNEL) staining, using TdT-FragEL DNA
Fragmentation Detection Kit, Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA, USA) following the methodology
indicated by the manufacturer. We chose a single rostral-caudal coronal section per animal and counted the
number of apoptotic cells in the peri-infarct zone using
a 40× objective on the optic microscope (Olympus,
BX41, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and image
analysis software (Image-Pro Plus 4.1, Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). Cells undergoing apoptosis
were identified based on their nuclear morphology and
dark color [8,20].
Immunohistochemistry

All animals were given 50 mg/kg of daily intraperitoneal
BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich) on days 4 to 7 after ischemia. This
administration protocol was based on previous reports
that proliferation peaked 4 to 10 days after injury [25,26].
Animals were sacrificed 14 d after surgery by transcardial
perfusion and decapitation. Their brains were fixed and
stored at 4°C and the following day the tissue was placed
in cryoprotectant solution at -80°C. Serial coronal sections
were cut at 10 μm on a cryostat (LEICA CM1950, Leica
Microsystems, Heilderbeg, Germany) and later studied by
immunohistochemistry for cellular proliferation. Brain sections were treated with BrdU In-Situ Detection kit (BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
Immunofluorescence

The sections were studied using different immunofluorescent antibodies as follows: the neuronal markers, neuronal
nuclei (NeuN) (monoclonal antibody diluted 1:100, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and neurofilament (NF) (monoclonal antibody diluted 1:100, DAKO, Denmark A/S,
Glostrup, Denmark); the astrocyte marker, glial fiibrillary
acid protein (GFAP) (monoclonal antibody diluted 1:400,
Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA); the vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) marker (polyclonal antibody diluted
1:500, Millipore); the oligodendrocyte (Olig-2) marker
(polyclonal antibody diluted 1:500, Millipore); the synaptogenesis marker, synaptophysin (monoclonal antibody
diluted 1:200, Sigma-Aldrich); and the brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (polyclonal antibody diluted
1:1000, Millipore), followed by goat anti-mouse Alexa
Fluor 488 and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (1: 750, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Barcelona, Spain). Also, we used
BrdU (monoclonal antibody diluted 1:50, DAKO) followed
by goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 as a proliferation
marker. All sections were mounted with H-1200 VectaShield mounting medium for fluorescence with diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI, Vector, Atom, Alicante, Spain).
Samples were examined using a LEICA TCS SPE spectral
confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg,
Germany) and the confocal images were analyzed using
LEICA software LAS AF, version 2.0.1 Build 2043. The
images were acquired as a confocal maximum projection.

Western blot

Proteins were isolated from peri-infarct tissue and their
concentrations determined using a BCA protein assay
kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Twenty micrograms of
protein were loaded onto 10% acrylamide SDS-gels. Following electrophoresis at 100 V for 1 h, protein was
transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).
Membranes were blocked in 5% fat-free dry milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline pH 8.0 (TBS) plus 0.1%
Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 1 h and probed overnight at 4°C
with the following antibodies at the designated dilutions:
NF (monoclonal antibody diluted 1:100, DAKO); GFAP
(monoclonal antibody diluted 1:400, Chemicon); VEGF
(polyclonal antibody diluted 1:500, Millipore); Olig-2
(polyclonal antibody diluted 1:500, Millipore); synaptophysin (monoclonal antibody diluted 1:200, SigmaAldrich); BDNF (polyclonal antibody diluted 1:1000,
Millipore) and b-actin (monoclonal antibody diluted
1:400, Sigma-Aldrich), which was used as a control protein. After rinsing with 0.5% TBS-T solution, the membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody, a
donkey anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibody conjugated
with horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Chemicon) for 1 h at
room temperature. Signals were detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL, GE, Healthcare Europe
GmbH, Freiburg, Germany) before exposure on radiographic film. The density of stained bands was scanned
and quantified by the Scion Image and 1-D Manager
Version 2.1 (Scion Corporation, Frederick, Maryland,
USA). To reduce differences between animals, at least
three western blots were performed for each time point
and animal. In addition, at least two or three repeated
samples were always included in every set of experimental samples as internal standards.
Statistical analysis

Quantitative data are shown as mean values ± SD. The
Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Mann-Whitney test
were used to compare the functional evaluation score,
lesion size, cell death and number of BrdU-positive cells,
while VEGF, BDNF, SYP, Olig-2, NF and GFAP levels
were compared between animals receiving MSC from
either cell source among the various groups. Values of P
< 0.05 were considered significant at a 95% CI; we used
statistical software SPSS 16 for Windows for analysis.

Results
Physiological parameters remained within normal limits
throughout the procedure and showed no significant differences between groups.
Characterization of MSCs

We confirmed that CD90-FITC (AbD Serotec) and
CD29-PE (AbD Serotec) surface markers were positive

Page 5 of 12

in MSC, whereas the CD45-PE (AbD Serotec) and
CD11b-PE (AbD Serotec) surface markers were negative
(Figure 1). The MSC showed a typical fibroblast-like cell
morphology.
Allogenic i.v. administration of BM-MSC and AD-MSC
improves functional recovery after pMCAO

Animals were clinically evaluated at 24 h and 14 d and the
corresponding functional score obtained for each group
(Figure 2). The sham-operated group did not show functional deficit. On both the Rogers and the rotarod test, the
treated groups showed good functional recovery regardless
of cell source, bone marrow or adipose tissue, without significant differences in functional scores between treated
groups at either time point. In the Rogers test, the BMMSC (1.57 ± 0.53; 0.43 ± 0.78) and AD-MSC (1.51 ± 0.62;
0 ± 0) groups had significantly improved functional recovery compared with the untreated infarct group (3.4 ± 0.89;
2.6 ± 0.89) at 24 h and at 14 d, respectively (P < 0.05). In
the rotarod test the BM-MSC (37 seconds ± 6.36 seconds;
68.15 seconds ± 6.86 seconds) and the AD-MSC (36.2 seconds ± 6.63 seconds; 60.9 seconds ± 10.04 seconds) groups
had significantly improved functional recovery compared
with the infarct group (6.25 seconds ± 0.35 seconds; 30.45
seconds ± 5.87 seconds) at 24 h and at 14 d, respectively
(P < 0.05).
Migration and implantation of MSC was not observed via
i.v. administration

Migration and implantation of MSC were studied by MRI
and DiI. Labeled MSC were not observed in the infarct
group because they were not administered to this group.
Endorem-labeled and DiI-labeled MSC were only
injected into the treated groups. However, neither migration nor implantation was observed on either MRI or
immunofluorescence images in the injured area after i.v.
administration of either BM-MSC or AD-MSC.
Infarct size after pMCAO measured by MRI and H&E does
not change after systemic MSC administration

Lesion size at 24 h and 14 d after the experimental procedure was evaluated on MRI (Figure 3A). All values were
lower at 14 d than at 24 h because the edema, which
appeared in the first few days after ischemia, had
decreased after two weeks. Neither of the treatments,
BM-MSC (17.65% ± 3.27%; 13.04% ± 3.69%) or AD-MSC
(17.16% ± 9.19%; 12.25% ± 5.97%), reduced lesion volume
significantly with respect to the infarct group (21.89% ±
4.38%; 13.12% ± 3.16%) at either time point on MRI.
Also, the H&E staining at 14 d showed that neither of the
treatments, BM-MSC (14.09% ± 3.19%) or AD-MSC
(13.73% ± 3.20%), had decreased lesion volume significantly with respect to the infarct group (16.98% ± 7.03%)
(Figure 3B).

Figure 2 Acute intravenous (i.v.) administration of allogenic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal (BM-MSC) and adipose tissue-derived
mesenchymal (AD-MSC) cells improved functional recovery at 24 h and 14 d after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
(pMCAO). The scores in the Rogers (left) and rotarod tests (right) are shown. Both treatments significantly improved functional recovery with no
differences in recovery between the two groups (BM-MSC or AD-MSC). Data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 10); *P < 0.05.

Intravenous administration of allogenic MSC decreased
cell death after pMCAO

Sham-operated animals did not show TUNEL + cells.
There were no TUNEL+ cells in the contralateral hemisphere in any operated animal. At 14 d, the infarct
group (41 ± 6.4) showed significantly more TUNEL+
cells than the BM-MSC (26 ± 5.5) and AD-MSC (24 ±
8.79) groups in the peri-infarct zone. In conclusion,
both treatments significantly reduced the number of
TUNEL+ cells compared to the number in the infarct
group at 14 d (P < 0.05) (Figure 3C).
Intravenous administration of allogenic MSC increased
cellular proliferation after pMCAO

Sham-operated animals did not present BrdU-positive
cells in the peri-infarct lesions. Quantitative analysis of
BrdU-positive cells showed that the infarct group (51 ±
9.9) displayed a significantly smaller decrease in the number of BrdU-positive cells in the peri-infarct zone at 14 d
after focal cerebral ischemia than did the BM-MSC (137.5
± 9.2) or AD-MSC (142.81 ± 11.12) groups (Figure 3D).
At 14 d, we observed BrdU co-labeling with GFAP and NF
in the infarct, BM-MSC and the AD-MSC groups in the
peri-infarct zone (Figure 3E).
Intravenous administration of allogenic MSC modified
brain repair markers levels after pMCAO

At 14 d after pMCAO the levels of brain repair markers
were analyzed in confocal microscopy and confirmed by
the western blot protein levels as arbitrary units (A.U.)
(Figure 4). Compared with the infarct group (2.75 (A.U.) ±
1.38 (A.U.)), VEGF levels were significantly higher in the
rat brain after administration of either BM-MSC (4.84 (A.
U.) ± 0.89 (A.U.)) or AD-MSC (5.05 (A.U.) ± 1.16 (A.U.)).
The levels of Olig-2 labeling were also significantly higher
than in the infarct group (2.05 (A.U.) ± 0.46 (A.U.)) after

the BM-MSC (2.89 (A.U.) ± 0.17 (A.U.)) and the AD-MSC
(2.66 (A.U.) ± 0.14 (A.U.) treatments. Compared with the
infarct group (2.15 (A.U.) ± 0.22 (A.U.), SYP levels were
also significantly increased after BM-MSC (3.14 (A.U.) ±
0.16 (A.U.) and AD-MSC (3.06 (A.U.) ± 0.15 (A.U.)
administration. Lastly, NF levels were significantly
increased after either the BM-MSC (2.10 (A.U.) ± 0.54 (A.
U.) or the AD-MSC (1.9 (A.U.) ± 0.48 (A.U.) treatment
compared with the infarct group (1.18 (A.U.) ± 0.29 (A.
U.). The BDNF levels were also higher after stem cell
administration, but this increase did not reach statistical
significance. The GFAP levels were significantly decreased
after treatment with either BM-MSC (2.45 (A.U.) ± 0.05
(A.U.) or AD-MSC (2.075 (A.U.) ± 0.175 (A.U.) in comparison with the infarct group (3.76 (A.U.) ± 0.315 (A.U.).
We did not observe any significant differences in
brain repair markers between the BM-MSC- or AD-MSCtreated groups.

Discussion
In this study we investigated the effects of acute i.v.
administration of allogenic BM-MSC and AD-MSC after
permanent focal ischemia in rats. We found that BMMSC and AD-MSC i.v. administration significantly
improved functional recovery despite the lack of a
reduction in infarct volume, or the apparent absence of
migration or implantation by the administered MSC to
the damaged brain. Animals receiving MSC from either
source showed decreased cell death and increased cell
proliferation, VEGF, Olig-2, SYP and NF levels as well
as reduced GFAP levels in the brain 14 d after pMCAO.
Importantly, in this study of acute administration of allogenic cells there were no differences in the effects of the
treatment between the cells from either source, bone marrow or adipose tissue, that might have clinical implications
for the translation of this treatment to human trials.

BM-MSC and AD-MSC administration improves functional
recovery independently of infarct volume and cell
migration/implantation

The significant improvement in functional scales at 24 h
was even more notable after 14 d of pMCAO, and there
were no significant differences between the effects of
cells from either source (BM-MSC or AD-MSC). In a
recent comparative study of transitory ischemia in mice,
the authors reported better results when administering
AD-MSC than when administering BM-MSC [18]. That
study also reported a reduction in infarct volume that
we did not find after BM-MSC or AD-MSC administration; these differences might be explained by the fact
that we did not recanalize the MCA. In our study,
migration and/or implantation of cells administered i.v.
was not found in the peri-infarct area since we could
not detect any trace of Endorem™ or DiI staining at
either 24 h or 14 d. Previous studies observed that after
i.v. administration, stem cells are detected in the lungs,
liver, spleen and other organs [27-29]. Therefore, it
might not be necessary for stem cells to migrate and
graft onto the lesion site in order to obtain a positive
functional result [8], due to the paracrine effects of
MSC. This good outcome could be a consequence of
the secretion of several growth factors that could act to
enhance endogenous repair mechanisms normally activated in the brain after stroke such as endogenous
neurogenesis, immunomodulation, brain repair and plasticity [8,17,30,31].
BM-MSC and AD-MSC effects on cell death and cell
proliferation

Tissues were better-conserved in animals treated with
BM-MSC and AD-MSC. TUNEL marking was reduced
and cellular proliferation (BrdU-positive cells) increased
in the peri-infarct zone, compared with the infarct
group at 14 d. These results agree with previous studies
that reported reductions in apoptotic cell number and
increases in cellular proliferation after AD-MSC [9] and
BM-MSC administration [8,32]. In line with earlier studies, other reports have demonstrated that administration of MSC promotes cellular proliferation in the
subventricular zone [32] and cell differentiation into
neuroblasts in the peri-infarct area compared to infarct
group [33].
BM-MSC and AD-MSC raise brain repair markers levels in
the ischemic brain

It is thought that MSC secrete a wide array of neurotrophins, growth factors, cytokines and other soluble factors [34] such as VEGF or BDNF, in response to repair
processes, and this could amplify trophic factor levels in
the brain [35]. Studies in vitro and in vivo demonstrate
that such factors can promote cell proliferation, survival

Page 10 of 12

and differentiation [36], and consequently raise the possibility that stem cell administration could promote recovery
by interfering with trophic factor signaling to modulate
brain repair response. In this study we have found that the
expression of neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, angiogenesis
and oligodendrogenesis markers such as NF, Olig-2, SYP
and VEGF was significantly augmented at 14 d after acute
and allogenic BM-MSC and AD-MSC administration
compared with the infarct group. A previous study by our
group found augmented VEGF levels after BM-MSC
administration [8]. However the authors of a recent comparative study did not find significant differences in brain
VEGF levels after the administration of either AD-MSC or
BM-MSC 24 h after transitory ischemia in mice [18]. We
did not observe differences for this marker at 14 d in our
current study either.
Recovery after stroke is a dynamic process [37] and
the growth and trophic factors produced by MSC may
affect synaptogenesis in the ischemic brain [38]. In our
comparative study, we observed that SYP levels in the
peri-infarct zone were significantly increased after BMMSC and AD-MSC administration in comparison with
the infarct group. It is known that levels of NF expression are increased 7 d after focal cerebral ischemia in
the peri-infarct zone [39]. In our study we observed significantly elevated levels of this marker 14 d after MSC
administration. Also, oligodendrocytes are sensitive to
ischemic damage but in several previous stroke studies
BM-MSC administration enhanced oligodendrogenesis
and remyelinization [40,41]. In our comparative study
we detected augmented levels of Olig-2 at 14 d. Another
factor, BDNF, has been shown to be augmented after i.v.
MSC administration [42] and we detected in our study
that it was higher (but not significantly) in the treated
groups than in the infarct group. Finally, we detected a
reduction in the glial marker, GFAP, at 14 d after both
BM-MSC and AD-MSC administration (without significant differences between either cell type), probably
reflecting a reduction in glial scar formation as previously observed [40] and in agreement with a previous
report on AD-MSC administration [9].
Future landmarks for clinical translation

The intrinsic complexity of stroke and the Stem Cell
Therapies as an Emerging Paradigm in Stroke (STEPS)
criteria for translational research underline the importance of further studies that can compare different
experimental conditions and different experimental animal models. From the viewpoint of clinical translation
allogenic stem cells are attractive because they can be
easily obtained from young healthy donors, amplified,
and stored for immediate use when needed after a
stroke. Furthermore, it is known that MSC do not
express MCH-II, minimizing the risk of rejection in

Gutiérrez-Fernández et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy 2013, 4:11
http://stemcellres.com/content/4/1/11

patients [43] and the use of cells from the same species
during the acute phase has been shown to be safe and
effective without signs of rejection in many different
experimental animal studies [8,11,44]. As an administration route in a clinical setting we considered the i.v.
route, which has already shown efficacy in previous studies, to be less invasive than others, such as intra-arterial or intracerebral routes [7-9]. Future comparative
studies are needed to determine cell fate after i.v.
administration, the mechanism of action and the best
dose to be used in patients to eliminate the possibility
of undesired side effects.

Conclusions
In our comparative study, following pMCAO we showed
that AD-MSC are as effective as BM-MSC in promoting
recovery and increasing the levels of brain protection
and repair markers after the experimental ischemic
stroke. Both cell sources are ethically acceptable with
adipose-derived cells being particularly abundant and
easy to obtain without invasive surgery.
