The use of neuroprotective strategies to mitigate the fatal consequences of ischemic brain stroke is a focus of robust
research activity. We have previously demonstrated that thyroid hormone (T3; 3,3′,5-triiodo-L-thyronine) possesses
neuroprotective and anti-edema activity in pre-stroke treatment regimens when administered as a solution or as a
nanoparticle formulation. In this study we have extended our evaluation of thyroid hormone use in animal models
of brain stroke. We have used both transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (t-MCAO) and permanent (p-MCAO)
models of ischemic brain stroke. A signiﬁcant reduction of tissue infarction and a concurrent decrease in edema were
observed in the t-MCAO model of brain stroke. However, no beneﬁt of T3 was observed in p-MCAO stroke setting.
Signiﬁcant improvement of neurological outcomes was observed upon T3 treatment in t-MCAO mice. Further, we
tested T2 (3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine) a natural deiodination metabolite of T3 in MCAO model of brain stroke. T2
potently decreased infarct size as well as edema formation. Additionally, we report here that T3 suppresses the
expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels which could be a likely mechanism of its anti-edema activity.
Our studies provide evidence to stimulate clinical development of thyroid hormones for use in ischemic brain stroke.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of serious long-term disability in the United States [1]. Most brain strokes
(85–87%) are ischemic and results from an occlusion of a major cerebral
artery by a thrombus or an embolism which leads to loss of blood ﬂow in
a speciﬁc brain region. Ensuing neurochemical events rapidly lead to irreversible tissue damage [2]. Concurrently, there is a rapid development
of brain edema. Water channels named aquaporin-4 (AQP4) found at the
foot processes of astrocytes are known to mediate water accumulation in
the cytotoxic edema associated with the onset of brain stroke. Frequently, the cause of mortality in stroke is the cerebral edema that results in
elevated intracranial pressure [3]. Clinical options in ischemic stroke
are currently limited to the use thrombolytic agents. At present, t-PA (tissue plasminogen activator) is the only one approved intervention for the
management of acute ischemic brain stroke. However, t-PA must be used
within 4.5 h of onset of stroke and carries a substantial risk of hemorrhagic transformation [4,5]. Experimentally, in transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion (t-MCAO) model of ischemic stroke, t-PA treatment is

mimicked by the withdrawal of suture from the middle cerebral artery.
Prompt reperfusion of ischemic brain tissue is critical for restoring
normal function. However, the return of blood ﬂow may produce
destruction of preserved or recovered cells, a phenomenon known as
reperfusion injury. Further, it has been clinically observed that only 5%
of ischemic stroke patients actually receive t-PA treatment and fewer receive it in within the 4.5 h time frame [6]. Hence, it is also essential to investigate a potential brain stroke therapeutic strategy in animals without
recanalization. Such scenario is recapitulated in the permanent model of
ischemic stroke (p-MCAO) experimentally.
Experimentally, the use of neuroprotective agents before occlusion
of middle cerebral artery or after reperfusion has been shown to be effective in rodent models of ischemic brain stroke. Commonly described
neuroprotective agents are compounds that interfere with biochemical
cascade of events that lead to cell damage and death. The net result is
the salvation of tissue integrity and improved functional recovery after
stroke in animal models. However, many approaches that were effective
in experimental rodent brain stroke models failed to elicit beneﬁcial effects in clinical trials. Often times, toxicity and the pharmacokinetic proﬁle of drug candidates precluded the preclinical success from being
translated into clinical efﬁcacy [7].
The quest for relatively salubrious neuroprotectants has sparked interest in the use of endogenous hormones in brain stroke. Most notably,
neuroprotective actions of estrogens have been extensively studied [8].
However, large clinical trials failed to demonstrate the beneﬁt of chronic
estrogen replacement on stroke prevention [9]. In a previous study we

demonstrated that thyroid hormone (T3) possesses potent neuroprotective property when administered as a solution or as nanoparticle formulation in t-MCAO model of brain stroke [10].
Thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) play a crucial role in the growth, development, metabolism and cellular energetics [11]. In addition, thyroid
hormones have profound effects on the central nervous system. T3 and
T4 can permeate blood brain barrier directly. T3 is especially required in
the new neuron production and maturation during early brain development [12,13]. Thyroid hormone deﬁciency in speciﬁc time windows of
brain development can lead to irreversible brain damage [14,15]. Thyroid hormones also facilitate normal axonal myelination [16,17]. In
adults, changes in thyroid hormone levels in conditions such as hypoor hyper-thyroidism can lead to mood disorders, dementia or confusion
[18]. T2 (3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine) is an active natural metabolite of T3
formed by 5′ deiodination. Recent studies have identiﬁed potent activity
for T2 in a number of physiological processes.
In the current study we have conducted a systematic evaluation of
anti-edema activity of T3 in both transient and permanent MCAO stroke
models, evaluated the neuroprotective efﬁcacy of T2 and sought to identify the likely mechanism of anti-edema activity of thyroid hormones in
brain stroke.

of post-surgical recovery to prevent hypothermia as described
previously [21].
After 24 h, the animals were deeply anesthetized with isoﬂurane
(4%) and euthanized by decapitation. The brains were quickly removed
and sectioned coronally into slices of 1 mm thickness (McIlwain Tissue
Chopper). Slices were incubated in a 1% solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) in phosphate buffered saline at 37 °C (water
bath) for 15 min and then ﬁxed by immersion in 4% buffered formaldehyde solution. TTC stains viable brain tissue dark red based on intact mitochondrial function [22], whereas infarcted tissue areas remain
unstained (white). Images were acquired by digital camera (Nikon,
Coolpix), and areas of both hemispheres and the infarcted regions
were quantiﬁed for each slice using image analysis software (ImageJ,
NIH). We measured the areas of infarction (volume), and brain edema
(swelling) by area increase in the ipsilateral (ischemic) hemisphere,
and compared these with the contralateral (non-ischemic) hemisphere,
similar to the analyses described previously by us and others Elliot and
Jaspar [23], and subsequently developed by Sydserff et al. [24]. This
allowed a direct comparison of areas of ischemia (volume) with brain
edema, and allowed us to use each animal as its own control in addition
to inter-experimental comparisons.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Transient or permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
(t-MCAO or p-MCAO)
The experiments were conducted in accordance with NIH animal
care guidelines and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Northeast Ohio Medical University. In vivo brain ischemia was induced as described in detail previously [19]. Brieﬂy, two to three month
old (25–30 g) CD-1 male mice was subjected to either t-MCAO or pMCAO. Mice were anesthetized with 1–1.5% isoﬂurane in 30% O2.
Throughout surgery, temperature was maintained at 37 °C by a thermostatic blanket (rectal thermometer), and cerebral blood ﬂow was
monitored by laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (Moor Instruments). The skin
was incised, and the left occipital and superior thyroid arteries, branches
of the external carotid artery (ECA), as well as the pterygopalatine artery,
branch of internal carotid artery (ICA) were exposed, electro-coagulated,
and cut. After occlusion of the common carotid artery by micro-clip, the
left ECA was ligated, coagulated and cut distally to the cranial thyroid artery. A 15 mm monoﬁlament nylon suture (6-0 Harvard Apparatus,
Holliston, MA, USA; diameter of the heat-rounded tip: 0.2–0.3 mm)
was inserted into the ECA and gently advanced through the ICA until
its tip occluded the origin of the MCA. Correct placement of the monoﬁlament suture was indicated by a sudden drop of the local cortical blood
ﬂow in the left MCA territory to 10–20% of basal ﬂow as monitored by
laser-Doppler ﬂowmetry. A sustained reduction of N80% is indicative of
successful MCAO. After successful occlusion, the monoﬁlament was secured in place with ligature and the skin incision was closed by ligature.
For p-MCAO, the monoﬁlament suture was left in place for 24 h. To induce t-MCAO, the monoﬁlament suture was left in place for only
60 min. Afterwards, the monoﬁlament was withdrawn and the skin incision was closed by surgical clips.
For drug treatment, T3/T2 (25 μg/kg) was injected i.v. through the
jugular vein as described previously [20]. T3 or vehicle was either
injected before (pre-stroke treatment) or after (post-stroke treatment) brain stroke induction, whereas T2 was used in a post-stroke
regimen only. For the pre-stroke group, T3 was injected 30 min before brain stroke was induced. For the post-stroke group, T3/T2 was
injected 10–15 min after blood ﬂow reperfusion. Prompt administration (10–15 min) of T3/T2 after reperfusion was carried out to mimic
aggressive clinical manipulation required in management of stroke.
Vehicle (PBS) treated animals served as a control. Animal cages
were placed under a medical infrared heating lamp for the ﬁrst 2 h

Corner test was performed to determine sensorimotor and postural
asymmetries. Corner test was performed as described by Zhang et al.
[25] with minor modiﬁcations of the setup [21]. The animal is placed in
an open rectangle-diamond shape arena (carton box) for observation;
abnormal movements (e.g., turning/circling to one side). Whenever a
mice proceeds into one of the narrow corners (set at about a 30° angle)
with small holes, the narrowing walls cause bilateral stimulation of the
vibrissae. The normal mice typically rear forward and upward, and then
turn back, away from the corner. A naive mouse shows no preference
for either turning left or right, but after a stroke preferentially turns toward the ischemic hemisphere which is the left side in our methodology.
In each session, the procedure will be repeated until 10 proper turns will
be recorded for each animal. The number of left turns in each session was
plotted at each time point (baseline, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h) in conditions of
vehicle or T3 treatment in t-MCAO or p-MCAO operated mice.
2.3. MCAO data analysis and Statistics
Analyses were done according to a protocol adapted from Rorden and
Brett [26], modiﬁed and described previously by Mdzinarishvili et al.
[21]. Brieﬂy, an investigator blinded to the animal group allocations,
outlined the zones of infarction (as a clear demarcation between stained
and unstained areas), as well as the left and right hemispheric contours
seen in each digitized brain slice picture. Measurements were made on
each brain slice to calculate the volume of the lesion, and to correct for
overestimation [27] due to the effects of brain edema (swelling)
where: a = area of infarct (mm2), b = area of the infarcted (ipsilateral)
hemisphere slice (mm2), c = area of the non-infarcted (contralateral)
hemisphere slice (mm2), and d = brain swelling (mm2) = (b − c).
The area (Al) of the lesion (mm2), corrected for swelling, was derived
from the equation Al = a − d. The edema (swelling) area was designated
Ae and quantiﬁed by determining the ratio between the areas of the
infracted and non-infarcted hemisphere slices, thus: Ae = b − c. Infarct
volume and edema ratios of hemispheric areas were expressed as
mean ± standard deviation (SD) and compared using Student's t test.
Values of P b 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
2.4. RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis and real time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from brain tissue or from mouse primary astrocytes using Quick RNA mini prep kit (Zymo Research). 500 ng was
used in reverse transcription reaction using Superscript II (Invitrogen).

25 mg of brain tissue from each hemisphere (ipsilateral and contralateral) was lysed with 150–200 μl of RIPA buffer by sonication and collection after centrifugation. 10 μg of lysate was run on 4–20% SDS PAGE
HEPES gels (Pierce). The proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed for either AQP4 protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
or tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight. The signal was developed using ECL femto-molar kit (Pierce) and imaged on Protein Simple.

To ensure that the brain ischemia induced by transient MCAO we
monitored cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) using laser-Doppler ﬂowmetry
as described [19]. Individual baseline signals obtained in each animal
before induction of MCAO were set to 100%. As shown in Fig. 1A,
MCAO induction resulted in 80% reduction in CBF. Animals were excluded from the experiment if the cerebral blood ﬂow did not recover to at
least 70% of baseline by 10–15 min post-reperfusion. Fig. 1B shows
CBF recovered in both vehicle and T3 treated animals and that T3 did
not cause alteration in cerebral blood ﬂow.
Fig. 2A shows representative brain slices of the control group as well
as the T3 pre-treated group 24 h after t-MCAO. Visual inspection shows
that there is a striking attenuation of the ischemic (stroke) area in those
slices treated with T3 compared with controls. This attenuation was
most visible in the cortical area (where the penumbra was mostly

located), while the internal core (where the umbra was mostly located)
was still affected by ischemia and subsequent cell death.
Pre-treatment with T3 in t-MCAO model resulted in a reduction of
focal ischemia by 32% in comparison to vehicle treated control animals
(statistically signiﬁcant, P b 0.005 versus vehicle controls) (Fig. 2B). Additionally, there was a 55% decreased in brain swelling upon T3 pretreatment as compared to vehicle treated controls (Fig. 2C). These ﬁndings in pre-stroke treatment regimen in t-MCAO were in agreement
with the results we reported earlier [10].
Further, we determined if the neuroprotection would be preserved if
animals were treated with T3 after stroke had been induced as this represents the more relevant clinical scenario. Indeed, as seen in Fig. 3A,
TTC staining shows evident neuroprotection with a greater protection
of the cortex than the core. A 38.4% reduction of infarct area and a
62.79% decrease in brain edema (swelling) was observed in animals receiving T3 treatment after stroke in t-MCAO model (Fig. 3B and C). Thus,
there was in fact a slight improvement in T3 efﬁcacy in post-stroke
treatment condition as compared to pre-stroke treatment.
Next, we evaluated whether the efﬁcacy of T3 observed in t-MCAO
models, extended to the p-MCAO model of brain stroke. Thirty minutes
prior to the artery occlusion, the mice were injected with T3 and the suture was left in place after occlusion. Twenty four hours after artery occlusion, the mice were sacriﬁced and brains were excised and processed
in manner similar to t-MCAO. As seen in Fig. 4A, T3 treatment didn't result in neuroprotection. Indeed, quantitation of infarct area and edema
in vehicle and T3 treated animals didn't reveal any differences (Fig. 4B
and C). Thus, T3 exhibited neuroprotection only in transient occlusion
model and did not in the permanent occlusion.

To assess functional beneﬁt, we determined whether the neuroprotection seen in response to T3 treatment in t-MCAO resulted in functional improvement in the animals. As determined in the corner test,
brain stroke increased the frequency of left turns (the infarcted or injury
side in this case). T3 treatment attenuated the numbers of left turns observed in these animals with signiﬁcant attenuation of left turn frequency at 24 h and 48 h for t-MCAO pretreatment and at 24 h and 72 h for tMCAO post-treatment (Fig. 5A and B). In p-MCAO mice, no T3 effect was
observed which is in agreement with no T3 effect observed in the neuroprotection studies (Figs. 5C and 4).
Next we investigated the effects of T2 (3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine) — an
active metabolite of T3, on brain stroke and edema formation after tMCAO and compared with T3. Mice were treated with T2 (25 μg/kg) the
same dose used with T3, 10–15 min after reperfusion (post-stroke treatment). Neuroprotection and resolution of edema were apparent from
visible examination of TTC stained brain slices (Fig. 6A). Treatment with
T2 decreased infarct size by 42% and edema by 65% (Fig. 6B and C),
which was slightly greater than effects of T3 (ischemia by 38% and
edema by 62%).
Having observed potent anti-edema activity for T3 and T2 led us to
investigate the potential mechanisms of such activity for these hormones. We determined the effect of T3 on the expression of AQP4
water channels in the both hemispheres of the brain. As shown in
Fig. 7A, 24 h T3 treatment resulted in inhibition of expression of AQP4
water channels as determined by real time PCR. To complement the
gene expression data, AQP4 protein levels were determined by western
blotting at two different time points — 1 h and 24 h. Similar trend in suppression of AQP4 protein was observed (Fig. 7B and C). Our data

suggests that a reduction in the expression of the AQP4 channels could
be a potential mechanism of anti-edema activity of thyroid hormones in
brain stroke conditions.
4. Discussion
Neuroendocrine proﬁle has been linked to a number of clinical neurodegenerative conditions [28–30]. Furthermore, relationship between thyroid hormones and cardiometabolic diseases has long been established
[31,32]. Hypothyroidism is associated with dyslipidemias resulting in increased levels of atherogenic lipoproteins and triglycerides [33,34]. Several studies suggest a direct correlation between thyroid hormone levels
and risk or severity of coronary artery disease [35,36] as well as ischemic
stroke [37]. Neuroprotective effect of T3 in ischemic stroke was described
and attributed to eNOS mediated vasodilation [20]. In the current study,
we have extended the ﬁndings to show for the ﬁrst time that: 1) T3 is
neuroprotective in both pre- and post-treatment regimens of brain ischemic stroke with mitigation of both tissue infarction and edema; 2) that T3
is neuroprotective in t-MCAO conditions but not in p-MCAO; 3) that neuroprotection achieved by T3 in t-MCAO translates into functional outcome
improvement as evidenced by our behavior data; 4) that T2 is neuroprotective in post-treatment regimen of brain ischemic stroke and exhibits
greater efﬁcacy than T3; 5) suppression of AQP4 gene expression is a likely mechanism of anti-edema activity of T3.
Interestingly, a number of human clinical studies have started to provide more insight into thyroid hormone function and ischemic brain
stroke susceptibility. Remarkably, there are studies performed in subclinical thyroid disease patients that suggest a detrimental role of thyroid
hormone in stroke susceptibility and outcomes. Subclinical hyperthyroidism has been linked to adverse cardiovascular events including stroke
and atrial ﬁbrillation. It was shown that patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism showed worse functional disability using a modiﬁed Rankin
scale as compared to euthyroid patients (odds ratio: 2.63) [38]. Authors

proposed increased energy demands of ischemic brain in elevated thyroid conditions as well as purported cardiac dysfunction in these patients
as likely explanations for their observations. Other studies have shown
subclinical hypothyroidism to be associated with favorable outcome in
stroke patients [39,40]. Ischemic preconditioning, hypometabolic state
and reduced adrenergic state were proposed as potential protective
mechanisms in these studies. A study performed in gerbils showed that
methimazole induced hypothyroidism delayed but did not prevent the
neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region following transient cerebral ischemia [41].
On the other hand, there is signiﬁcant human clinical evidence to
suggest low T3 as a strong predictor of worse stroke outcome. In a
large study, patients in ﬁrst or lower free T3 (fT3) tertile reported greater neurological impairment and greater 1-year mortality than those in
3rd or higher fT3 tertile [42]. Autoimmune thyroiditis, a common autoimmune disorder characterized by hypothyroidism has also been
shown to increase the risk of stroke [43]. It has been shown that T3
levels positively correlate with cognitive outcome after stroke [44]. In
addition, low T3 patients were shown to present with acute stroke in
greater numbers and that low T3 predicted greater mortality in these
patients at one year [45]. While seemingly contradictory, clinical evidence points to the signiﬁcance of thyroid status in clinical outcomes
post-stroke. It is estimated that 32–62% of patients suffer low T3 syndrome following an acute cerebrovascular event. More speciﬁcally, a
human study has demonstrated a trend toward decrease in T4 and fT4
during ﬁrst seven days after admission post-stroke [46]. T3 values
remained low until day 5 and recovered on days 7 and 9 after stroke.
We hypothesized that exogenous supplementation of thyroid hormone
or its metabolite post-stroke will have neuroprotective activity in
mouse model of ischemic stroke. Lower levels of thyroid hormones
can potentially exacerbate the stroke related neuropathology and
hence we hypothesized that exogenous administration of thyroid hormones will facilitate the recovery of physiological function.

Our studies show potent neuroprotective action of thyroid hormones in t-MCAO. A single dose of T3 is able to attenuate infarction as
well as edema signiﬁcantly. Experimental induction of hyperthyroidism
in mice requires administration of a 250 μg/kg dose for 14 consecutive
days [47]. Thus the dose used in our study (25 μg/kg) will not induce
thyrotoxicity or hyperthyroidism in mice but will transiently elevate
the levels of the hormones in mice. Nevertheless, we believe the potential beneﬁts from the hormone's use in brain stroke outweigh the risk of
thyrotoxicity.
Modestly greater efﬁcacy of T3 was observed when administered
post-stroke. It is likely that T3 activates different neuroprotective

mechanisms as determined by its time of administration prior to or
after brain stroke induction. Induction of brain stroke causes rapid pathophysiological changes in the brain. Rapidly changing neurochemical
proﬁle in the brain suggests that varying or multiple neuroprotective
mechanisms would be at play depending on pre- or post-treatment
with T3. Alternatively, greater efﬁcacy could also be a result of compromised blood brain barrier after brain stroke that would result in increased levels of the hormone reaching infracted area more rapidly.
Additionally, T3 treated animals showed a marked improvement in neurological deﬁcits commonly seen in ischemic brain stroke. Our behavior
assay data conﬁrms the greater survival of functional neurons in T3 treated animals. Thyroid hormone is known to play a signiﬁcant role in early
embryonic human neurogenesis as well as adult neurogenesis [48].
While preservation of surviving neurons is a likely mechanism of improved behavioral outcomes post-stroke, it is also likely that T3 promotes neurogenic machinery in the vicinity of the tissue infarction.
While we observed signiﬁcant neuroprotection in t-MCAO, we did
not see any affect in the permanent model of stroke. As noted above,
p-MCAO simulates the ischemic brain stroke event without t-PA mediated recanalization. It is to be noted that p-MCAO results in much severe
lesions, greater sensorimotor deﬁcits and greater neuronal loss along
with associated astrogliosis than t-MCAO [49]. The fact that T3 demonstrates little efﬁcacy in p-MCAO model reﬂects the severity of the pMCAO phenotype. Further, it is also likely that T3 mediated neuroprotection is against the biochemical events related to reperfusion injury
and not ischemic tissue damage. Similar model speciﬁc neuroprotective
activity had been illustrated for the peroxisome proliferator activated
receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist pioglitazone [50]. Our ﬁndings suggest that while T3 may be a signiﬁcant new tool to administer along
with t-PA treatment in clinical stroke, it is unlikely to afford any beneﬁt
in t-PA untreated or t-PA resistant occlusions of brain arteries.
In our studies, we have determined the effects of T3 treatment 10–
15 min after blood reperfusion which is carried out 60 min after middle
cerebral artery occlusion. Although, the duration of occlusion in our
study is relatively small as compared to commonly seen clinical scenarios, we believe that it is a good starting point for further detailed studies
[51]. Future investigations will shed light on the window of opportunity
for T3 treatment after brain stroke as well as a dose response relationship. Long term studies with frequent T3 administration may also
show further improvement in functional recovery post-brain stroke.
Quite interestingly, we observed potent neuroprotective and antiedema activity for T2 in mouse model of ischemic brain stroke. In recent
years, there has been a considerable interest in bioactive metabolites of
thyroid hormone and other iodothyronines. Our ﬁndings suggest yet another potent activity for T2. Of therapeutic interest is the fact that T2 is
considerably less thyrotoxic than T3 [52]. Our ﬁndings also suggest a possibility that at least part of T3 activity in ischemic stroke could be derived
from its 5′ deiodination to T2 in vivo. While T2 has been shown to have
weak TR binding property, several studies suggest activation of nongenomic signaling pathway downstream of T2 administration including
potent effects on mitochondrial activation. Further research is required
to discern T2 contribution to anti-edema activity of T3.
Edema is generally classiﬁed into two major subtypes i.e., cytotoxic
and vasogenic. Cytotoxic edema refers to the swelling and intracellular accumulation of water due to substrate and energy failure and inability of
cells to regulate their volume. Astrocytes are the main cell types that
swell in cytotoxic brain edema [53], especially the pericapillary foot processes which are the predominant sites of AQP4 expression in the brain.
Astrocyte swelling is likely an important early event predisposing the
brain to further damage. Further, cytotoxic edema is refractory to
osmotherapy (mannitol). Vasogenic edema is a result of breakdown of
the blood brain barrier (BBB) due to increased vascular permeability.
Vasogenic edema is operative later in ischemic and hypoxic events in
the brain and is generally responsive to osmotherapy. AQP4 plays a significant role in cytotoxic edema as AQP4 null mice were shown to be
protected from cytotoxic edema resulting from hyponatremia and

cerebral focal ischemia [54,55]. In contrast, AQP4 increases the rate of
edema ﬂuid elimination in vasogenic brain edema models [56]. However,
mitigation of initial cytotoxic edema via inhibition of AQP4 expression or
activity is a viable strategy to overcome the development of vasogenic
edema and increased intracranial pressure. A number of recent reports
have highlighted the use of AQP4 as a drug target in therapy against
brain edema [57–59]. However, conventional small molecule drug development is always fraught with safety, efﬁcacy concerns along with frequent physiochemical and biophysical barriers to their formulation in
dosage forms. By focusing on endogenous hormones such as thyroid hormone we are able to resolve these translational challenges to a signiﬁcant
extent. The safety and pharmacodynamic–pharmacokinetic proﬁle of thyroid hormone administration is very well known owing to the FDA approved clinical use of thyroxine (T4, synthyroid) and T3 (cytomel) in
hypothyroidism therapy for past several decades.
While we have presented data for the potential anti-edema mechanism of T3 via AQP4 suppression, we want to stress that there are likely
multiple mechanisms of T3 neuroprotection. For example, Hiroi Y et al.
have shown that T3 mediated acute vasodilatory effects in t-MCAO are
likely a signiﬁcant mechanism of neuroprotection [20]. We believe
that such pathway would not be operative in p-MCAO. Our study
showed T3 activity only in t-MCAO whereas no effect was seen in pMCAO. It has been reported that AQP4 deletion is neuroprotective in
p-MCAO [54]. We believe that mechanisms such as those reported by
Hiroi et al. are likely responsible for t-MCAO speciﬁc neuroprotection
observed upon T3 administration. Another study by Genovese et al.,
showed neuroprotective effect of T4 in rat transient ischemia model

[60]. Authors presented data to show anti-inﬂammatory and antiapoptotic effects of T4. While vasodilatory, anti-inﬂammatory and
anti-apoptotic mechanism likely help maintain tissue integrity, we believe that AQP4 suppression likely mediates the thyroid hormone inhibition of edema development.
Thyroid hormone binds to its cognate nuclear receptor, the thyroid
hormone receptor (TR) to modulate gene expression. TR binds to the
thyroid hormone response elements (TRE) in the promoters of target
genes to modulate the expression of target genes. TR has two isoformswith TRα mediating the cardiac and adipose effects of the hormone,
whereas TRβ mediates the liver speciﬁc metabolic actions of T3 [61].
The brain expresses both TRα and TRβ. Interestingly, studies demonstrate that TR expression is subject to regulation post-ischemia in the
brain. In rat permanent MCAO model, it was shown that while TRα1
levels did not alter 14 days post-surgery, the levels of total TRβ1 decreased signiﬁcantly in the infarct area and that of nuclear TRβ1 were
slightly elevated in the peri-infarct area [62]. Cell-type speciﬁc staining
showed that activated macrophages exclusively expressed TRα1, whereas astrocytes showed a prominent TRβ1 signal in the astrocytic scar. In
another acute stroke study, investigators found a decrease in the protein
levels of TRα as early as 2 h after ischemia–reperfusion and a decrease in
TRβ 12 h after ischemia–reperfusion [63]. While the physiological significance of such decrease in receptor levels is yet unclear, the data suggests
a role of thyroid hormone signaling axis in response to stroke and that
exogenous thyroid hormone supplementation can likely mitigate the impact of diminished receptor levels. It should be noted that there exist several isoform speciﬁc TR agonists which can be employed to delineate the

44

role of speciﬁc receptor isoforms in neuroprotective and anti-edema
pathways. While genomic or TR mediated effects likely contribute to
the neuroprotective actions of T3, the rapid onset of brain stroke progression suggests that non-genomic effects of T3 may also be operative.
These non-genomic effects of T3 entail participation of signaling kinases
and result in more rapid alteration of cellular physiology [64]. Although,
neuroprotective actions of thyroid hormone have been ascribed to nongenomic activation of vasodilation via eNOS [20], other probable mechanisms cannot be ruled out.
Thyroid hormones analogs are in clinical development for use in
dyslipidemias. Our studies have shown that thyroid hormone analogs
can potentially also be used to counter a deadly complication of
dyslipidemias, that is, ischemic brain stroke. T3 and T2 can alleviate
brain stroke at multiple levels by preserving tissue integrity as well as
mitigating the extent of edematous swelling. As pointed out in preceding sections, evidence suggests that deviations from euthyroid status in
either direction results in profound impact on stroke pathology. Our
ﬁndings support the concept that the use of exogenous thyroid hormone supplementation has a beneﬁcial effect in the setting of ischemic
brain stroke. Our studies show that T3, T2 and their analogs warrant extensive investigations for this potential therapeutic use.
