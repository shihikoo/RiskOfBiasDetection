Abstract
Background: Enhanced glycolysis leads to elevated levels of the toxic metabolite methylglyoxal which contributes to loss of
protein-function, metabolic imbalance and cell death. Neurons were shown being highly susceptible to methylglyoxal
toxicity. Glyoxalase 1 as an ubiquitous enzyme reflects the main detoxifying enzyme of methylglyoxal and underlies
changes during aging and neurodegeneration. However, little is known about dynamics of Glyoxalase 1 following neuronal
lesions so far.
Methods: To determine a possible involvement of Glyoxalase 1 in acute brain injury, we analysed the temporal dynamics of
Glyoxalase 1 distribution and expression by immunohistochemistry and Western Blot analysis. Organotypic hippocampal
slice cultures were excitotoxically (N-methyl-D-aspartate, 50 mM for 4 hours) lesioned in vitro (5 minutes to 72 hours).
Additionally, permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion was performed (75 minutes to 60 days).
Results: We found (i) a predominant localisation of Glyoxalase 1 in endothelial cells in non-lesioned brains (ii) a timedependent up-regulation and re-distribution of Glyoxalase 1 in neurons and astrocytes and (iii) a strong increase in
Glyoxalase 1 dimers after neuronal injury (24 hours to 72 hours) when compared to monomers of the protein.
Conclusions: The high dynamics of Glyoxalase 1 expression and distribution following neuronal injury may indicate a novel
role of Glyoxalase 1.

toxic D-lactate in the presence of GSH [7,11]. Glo1, a dimeric
metalloenzyme with a molecular mass of 46 kDa, was detected in
human brain and bovine endothelial cell cultures [2,12,13].
However, little is known about the significance of Glo1 following
neuronal lesions. Hence, in the present study we analysed the
temporal dynamics of Glo1 expression and distribution in
secondary neuronal injury by using the in vitro model of
excitotoxically-lesioned rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures
(OHSC) and the in vivo model of permanent middle cerebral artery
occlusion (pMCAO) in rats.

Introduction
Methylglyoxal (MG) is a metabolite derived from ketone and
threonine metabolisms, but is mainly formed non-enzymatically
from triose phosphates degradation along the glycolytic pathway
[1–3]. It was reported that MG exerts cytotoxic effects through
induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage,
apoptosis, protein modifications and depletion of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) and glutathione (GSH) [4–6].
Approximately 0.1–0.4% of the glucotriose flux leads to the
formation of MG. Under anaerobic conditions enhanced glycolysis
occurs and an increased amount of MG is formed reaching
cytotoxic concentrations [7].
In addition, increased MG levels were associated with elevated
release of interleukin 1b (IL-1b) and tumour necrosis factor a
(TNF-a) in primary neuronal cultures [8,9]. Neurons show a
reduced capacity to adopt their glycolytic rate to anaerobic
conditions and are therefore highly susceptible to MG [2,10].
The detoxification of this harmful metabolite is assured by the
ubiquitous glyoxalase system. The system consists of glyoxalase 1
(Glo1) and glyoxalase 2 (Glo2), which convert MG to the non-

Permanent
middle
cerebral
artery
occlusion
(pMCAO). Spontaneously hypertensive rats (Charles River,

Sulzfeld, Germany) were deeply anesthetised by intraperitoneal
injection of ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg), xylacin (10 mg/
kg) and atropine (0.1 mg/kg). Animals were subjected to pMCAO
by thermocoagulation as described previously [17,18]. After
surgery animals were randomly assigned to survival periods of
75 min, 1 d, 7 d, 10 d and 60 d (n = 3 each) after stroke onset.
Animals were sacrificed at given time points by CO2 exposure and
transcardially perfused with phosphate buffered saline solution
(PBS) and formalin solution (4% (w/v)). Brains were removed,
cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution and stored at 280uC until
further use.

Analysis methods
Western Blot. All Western blot analyses were performed
under reducing conditions. At first, hippocampi were transferred
to lysis buffer solution (80 mmol/l Tris, 70 mmol/l sodium
dodecylsulfate (SDS), 0.3 mol/l sucrose, 3 mmol/l sodium orthovanadate and 0.5 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)
at pH 7.4) and stored at 280uC until further use. The tissues were
sonicated in lysis buffer solution and whole cell extracts were
centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min to remove cell debris. Protein
concentrations in supernatants were measured by BCA test.
Subsequently, protein concentrates were treated with 46
Laemmli sample buffer (32% 0.5 mol/l Tris, 15% distilled water,
40% Glycerol, 10% of 10% (v/v) SDS, 2.8% b-mercaptoethanol,
0.2% bromophenol blue). Afterwards, equal protein quantities
were loaded onto the top of 12.5% (v/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels.
After electrophoresis, proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes followed by incubation with blocking buffer
solution (5% (w/v) milk, 25 mmol/l Tris, 150 mmol/l NaCl)
pH 7.5). The membranes were incubated for 16 h with antibodies
for Glo1 (1:1000) and beta-actin (1:40000) in blocking buffer
solution containing 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20). After three washing
steps with Tris buffered saline solution containing 0.05% (v/v)
Tween 20 (TBST) for 10 min the secondary horseradish
peroxidase anti-mouse antibody (1:10000) were added for 1 h.
The membranes were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence and the bands were visualised with X-ray films followed by
semiquantitative analysis using the ImageJ image software (ImageJ
1.43, imagej.nih.gov/ij/). The beta-actin level was used as
reference. Values obtained from the control-group were set
arbitrarily to 100% and alternations in the lesioned-group were
examined in relation to their corresponding time control.
Immunohistochemistry. OHSC were fixed with 4% (w/v)
paraformaldehyde solution in 0.2 mol/l phosphate buffer (PB) for
at least 12 h. Subsequently, OHSC were incubated in 10% (w/v)
sucrose followed by 20% (w/v) and 30% (w/v) sucrose, each step
were performed for at least 24 h. Afterwards, 12 mm thick sections
were prepared by using a cryostat and mounted on superfrost
microscope slides. Cryopreserved brains from pMCAO-experiments were cut in 20 mm thick coronal cryosections and mounted
on coated slides.

Tissue handling and experimental design
Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSC). OHSC
were obtained from seven to nine days (d) old Spargue-Dawley
rats. After decapitation brains were dissected under aseptic
conditions as previously described [14–16]. Frontal lobe and
cerebellum were removed and the remaining brain containing the
temporal lobe was transferred to the preparation medium (MEM,
pH 7.35 containing 1% (v/v) glutamine). Horizontal slices of
350 mm thickness were prepared using a vibratome at 4uC.
Hippocampi were separated and placed on cell-culture inserts with
a pore size of 0.4 mm. Six to eight OHSC were obtained from each
brain. Inserts were transferred to six-well culture dishes and 1 ml
of culture medium containing 50% (v/v) MEM, 25% (v/v) HBSS,
12.5% NHS, 2% (v/v) glutamine, 1.2 mg/ml glucose, 0.1 mg/ml
streptomycin, 100 mg/ml penicillin, 0.8 mg/ml ascorbic acid and
1 mg/ml insulin; pH 7.4 was added. Subsequently, culture dishes
were incubated for six days at 35uC in a fully humidified
atmosphere with 5% (v/v) CO2 and culture medium was changed
every second day.

significant changes between 5 min to 12 h (p.0.05). From 12 h to
24 h we measured a significant increase in intensity (p,0.05)
followed by a progressively decrease of the protein level from 24 h
to 72 h. In addition, significant changes were observed for
monomer at 24 h and dimer values at 24 h and 48 h when
compared to respective time controls (p,0.05, Figure 1C).
Furthermore, changes of Glo1 monomer/dimer-ratios were
investigated by analysing their values in control and NMDAtreated groups (Figure 1D). Examining Glo1 ratio of controlOHSC yielded no significant changes at all-time points investigated (p.0.05). Within the NMDA-lesioned group the Glo1 ratio
became statistically significant at 24 h (p,0.05). The comparison
between ratio values of controls and NMDA-treated slices revealed
a significant increase in intensity at 24 h and 48 h (p,0.0001).

For immunofluorescence, cryosections were dried for 30 min
and washed with PBS containing 3% (v/v) Triton-X 100 (PBS/
Triton) for 5 min. Accordingly, sections were incubated with
normal goat serum (1:20 diluted in PBS/Triton) for 30 min at
room temperature to block unspecific binding sites. Subsequently,
following primary antibodies were added in PBS/Triton containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine albumin serum for at least 16 h by 4uC:
Glo1 (1:150), NeuN (1:500), GFAP (1:400), laminin (1:200), NCadherin (1:100) or Iba1 (1:500). Sections were then washed three
times for 10 min with PBS/Triton followed by the incubation with
Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200) and Alexa 568conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500), respectively. Slides were
then coversliped with Dako fluorescent mounting medium, and
analysed by a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal laser scanning system,
as previously described [19,20]. For ExtrAvidin peroxidase
staining, sections were treated with methanol containing 1.5%
(v/v) of 30% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. Afterwards,
slides were washed three times for 10 min with PBS/Triton
followed by incubation with normal goat serum (1:20 in PBS/
Triton X-100) for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently,
sections were incubated with Glo1 antibody (1:300) in PBS/Triton
containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine albumin serum for at least 16 h at
4uC. Afterwards, slides were washed three times for 10 min with
PBS/Triton and then incubated with biotinylated goat anti-mouse
IgG (1:100) in PBS/Triton X-100 for 60 min. Next, sections were
washed again three times for 10 min with PBS/Triton X-100
followed by adding of ExtrAvidin-Horseradish Peroxidase (1:100)
in PBS/Triton X-100. To visualize the immunoreactivity the
chromogen 3.3-diamino-benzidine was used. Finally, slides were
coversliped with Entellan.
Statistical analysis. Data from at least three independent
experiments are presented as mean 6 standard error of the mean
(SEM).
Statistic analysis were performed using one and two way
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni posttest, p,0.05 was considered
as significant.
Graphs were blotted and analyses were arranged using Graph
Pad Prism software 5 (GraphPad software, La Jolla, USA).

Excitotoxic neuronal lesion triggers redistribution of Glo1
In OHSC, the localisation and cellular allocation of Glo1 in the
dentate gyrus of OHSC were examined by double-immunostaining with NeuN (Figure 2A), GFAP, Iba1 combined with NCadherin (Figure 2B). In non-lesioned OHSC no Glo1 immunoreaction was present in NeuN immunoreactive neurons
(Figure 2A). Until 12 h post ictus no alterations of Glo1
immunoreaction were observed in neurons of lesioned-OHSC as
well. Double staining of Glo1 with GFAP or Iba1 revealed Glo1
immunoreactivity in astrocytes and microglia in control- and
lesioned-OHSC (data not shown). Differences over the time were
not present. At 24 h and 48 h post-lesion small (24 h, diameter = 7.86 mm61.48; 48 h, diameter = 4.45 mm60.94) round Glo1
positive, NeuN-negative cells with karyorrhectic nuclei which were
noticed (Figure 2A). These immunoreactions disappeared at 72 h
post-lesion. Only astrocytic processes were found immunoreactive
for Glo1 at this time point.
At higher magnification a change in the distribution of Glo1
immunoreactivity was observed in neurons. Twelve hours after the
lesion a translocation of Glo1 from cytosol to the cell membrane
was noticed by double labelling with Glo1 and N-Cadherin, a
neuronal cell membrane marker that was not found in the controlgroup. Moreover, a reduction in size and a progressive fragmentation of the nuclei of the small round Glo1 positive cells were
detected (Figure 2B).

Temporal and spatial dynamics of Glo1 after brain
ischemia

The antibody against Glo1 marked two bands with a molecular
mass of 23 kDa and 46 kDa (Figure 1A), respectively, representing
the monomer and dimer of the enzyme [2].
To analyse a possible alteration of the dimer/monomer ratio,
both protein bands were determined semi-quantitatively at
indicated time points (Tab S1).
In the control-group the Glo1 monomer (CTR, Figure 1A)
showed constant levels up to 6 h followed by a slight decrease of
intensity. Subsequently, the monomer increased up to 72 h.
However, all variations did not achieve the level of significance
(5 min, 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, p.0.05, Figure 1B,
Table S1A). The Glo1 dimer remained constant at all-time points
investigated (p.0.05). Statistical analysis between monomer and
dimer at their corresponding time values were statistically
significant at all investigated time points (p,0.0001).
For analyses of the groups after the excitotoxic lesion intensity
values were normalized and presented in relation to their
respective time controls, which were set to 100% (Figure 1C).
For the Glo1 monomer no significant changes of the protein level
were found (p.0.05, Table S1B). Comparing monomer- and
control-values revealed a significant decrease for the Glo1
monomer at 48 h (p,0.05). Values for Glo1 dimer showed no

After pMCAO the contralateral site served as the control-site
and the ipsilateral site were examined for injury-dependent
reactions. Glo1 immunoreactivity was observed in the endothelium of blood vessels at all time points investigated (Figure 3A). In
comparison to the contralateral site Glo1 immunoreaction
increased 75 min after ischemia in the endothelium of blood
vessels. In the time frame between 1 d and 10 d after injury high
Glo1 immunoreactivity was present in neurons at the ipsilateral
site. At 60 d post-injury the Glo1 immunoreactivity was not
detectable in neurons, but observed in perilesional astrocytes.
Double labelling experiments with classical markers for
endothelium (laminin), neurons (NeuN) and astrocytes (GFAP)
(Figure 3B) corroborated our data from immunohistochemistry. At
75 min after the onset of ischemia a clear endothelial localization
on contra- and ipsilateral sites with a higher intensity on ipsilateral
site was detected in sections stained for laminin, Glo1 and DAPI
endothelium of blood vessels showed. Sections stained with NeuN,
Glo1 and DAPI showed 3 d post-injury a positive immunoreaction
especially in neurons of the ischaemic core. On the contralateral
site no Glo1 positive neurons were found. Sixty days after
pMCAO, astrocytes participating in the formation of the ischemic

volume [24] but so far in clinical trials no positive effects were
reached [21]. The relevance of calcium-influx to mitochondria
[25] has extensively been investigated and the thereby related
mitochondrial-dysfunction with caspase-3 activation [26] and
ROS-production [27,28] are believed to maintain apoptosis or
necrosis [29]. Changes in glucose concentration markedly affect
the survival of neuronal tissue. Recurrent glucose deprivation was
found to result in higher neuronal loss [30]. The inhibition of
hexokinase, the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis showed protective effects after excitotoxicity [31]. The inhibition of Glo1 leads to
enhanced MG levels and prolonged induction of caspase-3
activation and alterations in calcium homeostasis as shown in
human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y [32,33]. Higher concentrations of MG attenuated cell viability of hippocampal and cortical
neurons [8,34]. Furthermore, increasing MG levels were paralleled by enhanced mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS, IL-1b, and
TNFa production, DNA fragmentation, GSH depletion, modifi-

scar on the ipsilateral site were identified as the major source for
Glo1 in sections stained for GFAP, Glo1 and DAPI. The reaction
was confined to the ipsilateral site.

Discussion
Beside heart diseases and cancer, stroke is the most frequent
cause of death and permanent disability in adulthood [21]. The
only effective and accepted therapy is the early thrombolysis if
started in the first 4.5 h after ischemia [22].
The illumination of processes in the aftermath of the ischemic
brain injury and the inhibition of downstream events after
ischemia are promising approaches to diminish secondary
neuronal damage. The activation of NMDA-receptor due to high
releases of glutamate after and during ischaemic injury results in
an excitotoxic insult [23]. In animal studies inhibition of NMDAreceptor improved the neurological score and reduced the infarct

to neuronal damage as shown in the model of cerebral ischemia
[39,40]. Glo1 is a NO-responsive protein and nitrosylation
decreases Glo1 activity [41,42]. After nitrosylation Glo1 might
also be phosphorylated at threonine-106 and is subsequently no
longer involved in detoxification of MG. Interestingly, the
modified Glo1 form suppresses TNF-induced transcriptional
activity of NF-kB reporter gene accompanied by increased cell
viability [43]. However, it has to be mentioned that nitrosylation is
also affected and thereby resolved using reducing conditions which
contains SDS and mercaptoethanol [44]. Recently, we have
shown the impairment of Glo1 activity by glutahionylation as
another posttranslational modification [45]. In addition, other
groups reported on changes of Glo1 dimer or oligomer stability by
glutathionylation which was paralleled by dissociation and
decreased protein function [46,47,48,49]. Data about posttranslational modifications leading to Glo1 dimerization and their
involvement and function in neuronal injury are still missing. A
possible link might be calcium dependent covalent cross-links by
transglutaminases, that showed increased activity in the aftermath
of NMDA treatment [50,51,52]. Since dimer formation related to
nitrosylation, glutathionylation or disulfid bridges can be excluded
under reducing conditions, the nature of the observed crosslink
remains to be determined. Further mass spectrometric analysis will
be necessary to bring more light in this issue.
In the control-group time dependent variations of Glo1
monomer were observed presumably representing intrinsic
rhythms as present in most physiological systems. In response to
NMDA application Glo1 dimer levels strongly increased between
12 h and 24 h post injury followed by a progressive decrease to
control levels. Looking at temporal dynamics of glyoxalase 1 and
its ratio, a significant rise from 12 h to 24 h was observed
indicating an increase in Glo1 dimer after excitotoxicity paralleled
by a decrease of the monomer. Taking previous studies into
consideration, the increase in Glo1 levels might presumably be a
part of survival mechanisms within the cells to prevent excitotoxic
death [42,43]. Regarding the redistribution of Glo1 immunoreaction in neurons from cytosol to cell membrane 12 h after lesion
there are no reports in the literature and its possible functional
relevance remains unknown. Nevertheless, the paralleled increase
of Glo1 dimer and the translocation of immunoreaction may
indicate a new function of Glo1 in lesioned neurons. Furthermore,
Glo1 up-regulation in astrocytes was observed 72 h after NMDA
application. This shift of immunoreactivity might represent the
necessity for astrocytic Glo1 up-regulation. Recent results about
the neuronal vulnerability toward changes of glucose metabolism
affirm the relevance of astrocytic Glo1 in metabolic homeostasis
presumptive after neuronal injury and increased MG exposition to
protect surrounding neurons of oxidative stress [10].
Upon MG accumulation on cellular level nuclear fragmentation, formation of DNA-ladder and apoptosis based on capase-3
activation have been reported [9,36,32,5,53]. Alternatively, the
increased Glo1 immunoreactivity in astrocytes may indicate a
metabolic turnover to assist neurons because of their low capacity
to change their metabolism upon oxidative stress [10]. Both
processes might contribute to neuroprotection under stress.
Based on previously described deficits of glucose metabolism
after traumatic brain injury [54] and excitoxicity as an accompanying event of secondary neuronal injury after stroke [24,37] we
conducted pMCAO as a well established in vivo model. In
immunohistochemistry we observed Glo1 immunoreactivity only
on the ipsilateral site with an apparent change of Glo1 expressing
cells. Immunofluorescence analysis with classical markers for
endothelium (laminin), neurons (NeuN) and astrocytes (GFAP) in
vivo support our findings of in vitro experiments. Under

cations of transcription factors and signal transductions being
essential for neurorepair [6,8,9,34,35,36]. However, little is known
about the role and temporal dynamics of Glo1 in secondary
neuronal lesions.
In the present study we examined the role of Glo1 by Western
blot analyses and immunohistochemistry in an in vitro model of
excitotoxically-lesioned OHSC and in the in vivo model of
pMCAO.
Glo1 is a dimeric enzyme which consists of two homologous
monomers which are non covalently bond [2]. The presence of
Glo1 dimers after the injury suppose a modification of Glo1
leading to Glo1 dimerization. It is well accepted, that excessive
NMDA receptor activation results in an excessive formation of
NO [38]. High NO levels and nitrosylsation of proteins contribute

Glyoxalase 1 in Acute Neuronal Injury

Figure 3. Glo1 is expressed in different cell types and underlies a time-dependent changes in immunoreactivity after pMCAO. A
Coronal sections of cerebral cortex of spontaneously hypertensive rats with pMCAO were stained for Glo1. Immunohistochemistry shows the injuryand time-dependent Glo1 immunoreactivity in the different stages of secondary neuronal injury. B Identification of Glo1 immunoreactive cells.
Sections were subjected to immunofluorescence for Glo1, DAPI for the nuclei and typical markers for endothelial cells (75 min; laminin), neurons (3 d;
NeuN) or astrocytes (60 d; GFAP). Scale bars: 300 mm (A), 10 mm (B; 75 min), 20 mm (B; 3 d) and 100 mm (B; 60 d).

physiological conditions the endothelium of blood vessels showed
Glo1 immunoreactivity on the contra- and ipsilateral sites. The
immunoreaction became more intense at the ipsilateral site 75 min
after injury. In the following, neurons showed the strongest Glo1
immunoreaction from 1 d to 10 d after the onset of ischaemia.
Sixty days after vessel occlusion no more Glo1-positive neurons
were noticed. In contrast, astrocytes near the scar displayed
valuable amounts of Glo1. However, the role of Glo1 in scar
formation needs to be elucidated further. We assume an elevated
metabolic flux in endothelial cells by the hypoxic state after the
occlusion to save or restore the integrity of the blood brain barrier.
The upregulation and redistribution of Glo1 might be a
consequence to prevent MG-induced cell death.

temporal Glo1 expression (75 min, endothelium; 1 d–10 d,
neurons; 60 d, astrocytes) might help to determine the onset of
ischemia and clarify the accompanied metabolic imbalance after
acute neuronal lesion. However, the role of the Glo1 dimer and
Glo1 translocation has to be illuminated further.
