Abstract  Recent studies showed that hyperglycemia
enhanced brain damage when subjected to transient cerebral ischemic stroke. However, the etiologic link between
them has been less known. In the present study, based
on an experimental rat’s model of hyperlipidemia combined with cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury (I/R), we
herein showed that hyperlipidemia induced by high-fat diet
(HFD) resulted in considerable increase in serum triglycerides, cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
and remarkable decrease in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which associated with an exacerbation on
neurological deficit, cerebral infarct and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling-positive cells in the ischemic hemisphere of cerebral I/R rats
treated with HFD diet. The data showed that serum superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione peroxides content
were significantly decreased, while malondialdehyde level
was obviously increased by hyperlipidemia or cerebral
I/R alone, especially by coexistence of hyperlipidemia
and cerebral I/R; meantime, hyperlipidemia also enhanced
cerebral I/R-induced protein expression of cytochrome
P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and the levels of pro-inflammatory
factors tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-6 in the ischemic
hemispheres. Furthermore, the combined action of hyperlipidemia and cerebral I/R resulted in a protein increase

expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 compared to hyperlipidemia or
cerebral I/R alone. Meanwhile, this study also showed that
hyperlipidemia significantly enhanced cerebral I/R-induced
transfer of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosolic
and the protein expressions of Apaf-1 and caspase-3, but
also decreased cerebral I/R-induced bcl-2 protein expression. The results reveal that hyperlipidemia exacerbates
cerebral I/R-induced injury through the synergistic effect
on CYP2E1 induction, which further induces reactive oxygen species formation, oxidative stress, inflammation and
neuronal apoptosis by coexistence of hyperlipidemia and
cerebral I/R.

Introduction
Stroke is the third leading cause of death in industrialized
countries and the most frequent cause of acquired adult (Lo
et al. 2003). Although this definition includes the hemorrhagic forms of stroke, 80 % of stroke cases occur due to the
occlusion of arteries carrying blood to the brain and subsequent ischemia. Different mechanisms are involved in the
pathogenesis of stroke, but increasing evidences show that
oxidative stress and inflammation play an important role in
ischemic brain injury (Del et al. 2000; Nita et al. 2001). A
better understanding of stroke risk factors and its outcome
may lead to the emergence of new avenues for therapeutic
intervention in cerebral ischemia.
A number of studies have shown that dyslipidemia is
one of the major risk factors for atherosclerosis affecting
the arteries of large and medium caliber and consequently

13

causing cerebral ischemia injury (Tziomalos et al. 2009).
As a metabolic risk factor, hyperlipidemia plays an important role in the process of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases characterized by the formation of atheromatous plaques. Cholesterol levels below 180 mg/dl may be
a risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke, particularly in hypertensive individuals. About half of ischemic stroke patients
exhibit hyperlipidemia (Lee et al. 2002). There is an abundant evidence that hyperlipidemia has tight relations with
ischemic neurovascular damage. Chronically increased
cholesterol levels activate a number of vascular events,
including oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, blood–
brain barrier disturbances and vascular inflammation,
which in turn have elevated stroke mortality (Ansell 2000).
Additionally, it is well known that systemic or aortic atherosclerosis may also exert negative effect on the evolution
of acute cerebral ischemia (Amarenco et al. 2006; Sharifkazemi et al. 2007).
Oxidative stress triggers overproduction of free radicals which overwhelms the detoxification capacity of
cellular antioxidant enzymes, resulting in a severe and
immediate damage to cellular proteins, DNA and lipids
(Chan 2001). Oxidative stress has been shown to induce
apoptosis by inducing cytochrome c release and activating caspase-9 and caspase-3 (Figueroa et al. 2006), and
lipid peroxidation would be followed by an inflammatory
response (Yan et al. 2006). Many researches show that the
oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) could activate the vascular endothelial cells to enhance expressions
of multiple adhesive factors and cytokines in cells. The
previous study reveals that ox-LDL can greatly increase
the level of TNF-α, IL-6 and sICAM-1 in the supernatant
after the intervention with ox-LDL (Jiang et al. 2012). On
the other hand, inflammatory events are initiated at the
blood–microvessel interface few hours after the onset of
ischemia. Cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, TNF-a and TGFβ, are produced immediately after the onset of ischemia
and consequently causing irreversible damage (Becker
2001). Currently, the impact of hyperlipidemia on cerebral ischemia and its molecular mechanism remains
unclear.
In this study, we hypothesized that hyperlipidemia
could directly induce a series of changes leading to the
oxidant and the inflammatory state, which in turn exacerbated cerebral I/R injury. To verify this assumption, the
rat’s model established by high-fat diet (HFD) rats which
exposed to the surgical operation of middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO)/reperfusion was used to investigate the effect of hyperlipidemia on cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion (I/R) injury through affecting oxidative/antioxidant system, inflammatory cytokines and neuronal
apoptosis.

Materials and methods
Materials
Assays of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were used
to measure MDA, GSH-Px and SOD in serum (Jiancheng
Institute of Biotechnology, Nanjing, China). BSA (kerui
CA), rabbit anti-Apaf-1 (Abcam, USA) and cytochrome c
antibody (Abcam, USA). TUNEL Assay (Sigma, USA),
ICAM-1, VCAM-1 antibody (Abcam, CA), bcl-2 antibody
(sc-7382) (Santa Cruz, CA), caspase-3 antibody (sc-56055)
(Santa Cruz, CA) and NF-κB (sc-372). Goat anti-rabbit or
donkey anti-goat IgG-conjugated AP (1:10,000, Santa Cruz,
CA). FITC-conjugated AffiniPure Goat anti-mouse IgG
(H  + L), TRITC-conjugated AffiniPure Goat Anti-Rabbit
IgG (H + L) (Abcam, CA), Chemiluminescence computerize image processing system (Image Quant 1.19, Molecular
Dynamics, and Sunnyvale, CA).
Animals
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats, weighing 250–300 g, were
obtained from Hubei Laboratory Animals Center for Medical Science and Research (No. 00006231). Housing facilities
and all experimental protocols were carried out according to
the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Animals Care
and Use Committee of Wuhan University of Science and
Technology Medical College which adopts the guideline for
the care and use of laboratory animals published by the US
National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23,
revised 1996).
Experiment design
Rats were fed either a standard low-fat rat chow diet (control diet) or a high-fat diet (HFD) (1 % cholesterol, 10 %
lard, 20 % sugar, 5 % egg yolk, 0.2 % bile salts and 63.8 %
standard chow, finally analyzed by the Laboratory Animal
Centre of Hubei). After 8 weeks of HFD, blood was withdrawn from the tail vein of overnight fasted rats for confirming hyperlipidemia (HL). Serum triglycerides (TG), total
cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were
detected by Beckman Coulter synchron LX20 autoanalyzer
(Beckman Coulter Inc., United States). The animals with
serum TC level >3.87 mmol/L were considered as HL rats
and included in the study (Gong et al. 2012). Subsequently,
normal diet group (fed control diet) and HFD group (HL rat)
were, respectively, divided into two subgroups: sham, HL,
I/R or HL + I/R group (Fig. 1). I/R or HL + I/R rats were

subjected to MCAO (Badr et al. 2001) for 2 h and followed
by 24-h reperfusion to induce cerebral I/R injury, and sham
and HL rats were exposed to the same surgical procedures
without the arteries occlusion. Behavioral score was evaluated at 24 h after reperfusion. And then the brain tissues of
all animals were collected for analyses.

brain according to the following formula: corrected infarct
volume (%) = (left hemisphere volume − (right hemisphere volume − the infarct volume) × 100/left hemisphere
volume.

Focal cerebral I/R injury

Blood samples from the caudal vein of anesthetized rats
were immediately centrifuged at 2000g for 5 min for the separation of serum. Serum was stored at −20°C until assayed.
The serum triglycerides (TG), cholesterol (CHOL), HDL-C
and LDL-C were detected using commercial kits by an autoanalyzer, Beckman Coulter synchron LX20 (Beckman Coulter Inc., USA).

Focal cerebral ischemia was performed as previously
described (Longa et al. 1989). Briefly, a thermoregulated
heating pad and an overhead heating lamp were used to
maintain a rectal temperature of 37 ± 0.5 °C. Rats were
anesthetized with 10 % chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg weight,
i.p.). Cerebral ischemia was induced by an occlusion of the
right MAC for 2 h with a nylon thread (diameter criteria,
0.25–0.28 mm). Then, the animals were undergone a reperfusion for 24 h after the filament was slowly removed.
Neurological assessments and infarct volume
The neurobehavioral tests were carried out according to the
Longa method (Longa et al. 1989). Rats with no neurological defect scored 0, left forepaws of rats with flexion, adduction and failure to extend fully scored 1, rats with circling
and rotating to the left when crawling scored 2, rats with falling to the left when standing scored 3, rats with not walking
spontaneously or coma scored 4 and dead rats scored 5.
The infarction volume was measured by TTC staining (Sun et al. 2012). Brain tissues were obtained after 2-h
cerebral ischemia/24-h reperfusion. Frozen cerebra were
sliced coronally into 2-mm slices from frontal pole incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 1 %
TTC at 37 °C for 20 min and then fixed by immersion in
10 % formaldehyde solution. Infarct areas were identified using an image analysis system (NIH Image, Version
1.61) and were combined to obtain the infarct volumes per

Blood lipids analysis

Measurement of serum SOD, MDA and GSH‑Px
SOD activity and GSH-Px activity were determined by a
commercially available kit (Jiancheng Biological Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China), respectively. SOD activity was
expressed as SOD U/mg protein. GSH-Px activity was measured at 420 nm, and the enzyme activity was calculated as
mg/g protein.
The malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration regarded as a
marker of lipid peroxidation was performed according to the
method of Wills (Wills 1966). Thiobarbituric acid-reactive
substances were quantified using an extinction coefficient of
1.56 × 105 M−1 cm−1 and expressed as nmol of MDA per
mg protein.
Measurement of TNF and IL‑6 in brain tissues
Fresh brain tissue was dropped into ice-cold saline, and the
cerebellum, brain stem, choroid plexus and meninges were
carefully removed. The cortices were chopped with a scalpel for <1 min into uniform 2–3 mm pieces and ground by
homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3000g at

13

	
2756

4 °C for 15 min and then used for assays of TNF-α and IL-6.
The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were determined according to
the radioimmunoassay kit instructions (Pu’er Weiye Institute
of Biotechnology).
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase‑mediated
dUTP‑biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay
TUNEL staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche, USA).The brain tissue was
placed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin
sectioned. After washing, the sections were incubated in TdT
enzyme (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) at 37 °C
for 1 h in a humidified chamber. The reaction was revealed
with 0.06 % 3,3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride
(DAB) and counterstained with hematoxylin. Negative controls were incubated in a TdT enzyme-free PBS solution.
TUNEL-positive cells were counted from an area that contains about 1 mm2 cells in the cortex region of ipsilateral
hemisphere of the brain. Total of five areas from each of the
five sections were evaluated in each animal.
Western blotting
Western blotting analysis was performed as previously
described (Lin et al. 2012). Tissue lysates containing 50 μg
of the total protein were subjected to electrophoresis in
a 15 % SDS PAGE gel, followed by transferring onto a
nitrocellulose membrane in transfer buffer. The membrane
was probed with a primary antibody at 4 °C overnight: the
antibodies of CYP2E1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, cytochrome c
and Apaf-1 (Abcam, CA), bcl-2 antibody (sc-7382) (Santa
Cruz, CA) and caspase-3 antibody (sc-56055) (Santa Cruz,
CA). After washing with 0.1 % Tween 20 in TBS, goat antirabbit or donkey anti-goat IgG-conjugated AP (1:10,000,
Santa Cruz, CA) was applied to the membrane for 1.5 h
at room temperature. Enhanced chemiluminescence detection of the target protein was performed with a computerized image processing system (Image Quant 1.19, Molecular Dynamics, and Sunnyvale, CA) and exposed using an
X-ray film.
Double immunofluorescence staining
Paraffin-embedded tissues were cut into 4-µm sections, after
deparaffinized, rehydrated, antigen retrieval and BSA blocking. Tissue sections were incubated with primary antibodies (cytochrome c mouse, Apaf-1 rabbits) overnight at 4 °C,
followed by incubation with secondary antibodies (TRITC
anti-rabbits, FITC anti-mouse) for 1 h at 37 °C. The nuclei
were counterstained for visualization with 4′, 6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI). Mounting than use confocal laser
scanning microscope to check the fluorescence

Statistical analysis
All values were expressed as mean ± SD. Data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA. The Newman–Keuls comparisons were used to determine the source of significant
differences where appropriate P values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Body weight and blood lipids
The rats’ average body weight was increased from
168.8 ± 8.2 to 281.4 ± 20.7 after 8 weeks of normal diet;
however, the average body weight was significantly increased
by 17.8 % after 8 weeks of HFD in HFD-treated rats. In this
case, an increasing level of TG 376.19 % (P < 0.01), CHOL
421.11 % (P < 0.01) and LDL-C 387.24 % (P < 0.01) and
a decreasing of HDL-C level (>28.59 %) (P < 0.01) were
observed in HFD-treated rats compared to normal diettreated rats (Table 1).
Hyperlipidemia aggravated cerebral I/R-induced neurological deficit and cerebral infarction.
As illustrated in Fig. 2a, no apparent change of neurological score was found between HL group and sham
group, while the significantly neurological deficits were
developed either in I/R (3.22 ± 0.24) or in HL + I/R group
(3.71 ± 0.41) compared with sham or HL group (P < 0.05).
Meanwhile, the obvious brain infarct volume was observed
in the ischemic hemispheres both in I/R (27 % ± 2.863 %)
and HL + I/R (38.114 ± 4.12 %) rats, which was significantly increased compared with sham or HL rats (P < 0.05);
however, extensive infarction was detected in HL + I/R
group (P < 0.05, Fig. 2b).
Hyperlipidemia increased cerebral I/R‑induced
neuronal apoptosis
TUNEL assay was used to assess neuronal apoptosis in the
ischemic hemisphere of I/R and HL + I/R rats or in the ipsilateral hemispheres of sham and HL rats. TUNEL-positive
cells appeared occasionally in the brain tissues of sham or HL
rats, diffused widely in I/R rats and significantly observed in
HL  + I/R rats (Fig. 3). TUNEL-positive cell number in I/R
group (31.97 ± 5.47 apoptotic cells/×20 field) was obviously
raised compared either to sham group (1.5 ± 0.22 apoptotic
cells/×20 field) (P < 0.01) or HL group (4.47 ± 0.45 apoptotic cells/×20 field) (P < 0.01). Interestingly, the apoptotic cell number was even more increased in HL + I/R rats
(43.40  ± 8.52 apoptotic cells/×20 field) compared with I/R
group (P < 0.01), which suggested the synergistic effect of
hyperlipidemia and cerebral I/R on neuronal apoptosis.

TUNEL analysis was performed in the coronal cerebral

Leica Qwin image analysis
software; 4–5 microscopic

and mitochondria (Wang et al. 2011), and GSH-Px had a
major function in the detoxification of peroxides (Fang et al.
2013). Before the surgical operation of cerebral I/R, HFD
inhibited the two enzyme activities both in HL and HL + I/R
rats compared with sham and I/R rats (Fig. 4a, c); however,
the two enzyme activities in I/R and HL + I/R groups steady
decline during the procedure of MCAO/R, especially at the
time point of 2-h ischemia and 2-h reperfusion; in this case,
the lowest activity of SOD was detected in HL + I/R group

13

(P < 0.05 vs sham, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 vs HL, P < 0.01
vs I/R). Consistence with SOD activity, GSH-Px activity was also significantly at the time point of 2-h ischemia
and 2-h reperfusion compared with sham, HL and I/R rats
by the ratio of 80.4 % (P < 0.05), 52.8 % (P < 0.01) and
16.7 % (P < 0.01), respectively, (Fig. 4d, f). MDA, which
indirectly reflects the degree of ROS on membrane lipid peroxidation, is one of the products of membrane lipid peroxidation (Liu et al. 2013). Currently, there was no significant

related to the severity of sepsis (Damas et al. 1997; Marik
and Varon 2001). After 2-h MCAO and 12-h reperfusion,
there was no apparent change on TNF-α level in brain tissues both in HL and sham rats; however, TNF-α level either
in I/R (8.64 ± 0.854) or HL + I/R (12.34 ± 1.791) rats
was significantly increased compared with sham and HL
rats (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), especially in HL + I/R group
(P < 0.05, vs I/R). On the other hand, an increase on IL-6
level was also found in HL (1.92 ± 0.27), I/R (3.06 ± 0.43),
especially in HL + I/R (4.52 ± 0.55) group compared with
sham (P < 0.01), HL (P < 0.01) or (P < 0.05) (Fig. 5a, b).
The result hinted that either HFD or cerebral I/R injury may
raise IL-6 level, particularly by coexistence of hyperlipidemia and cerebral I/R.
The synergistic effect of hyperlipidemia and cerebral
I/R on the protein expression of CYP2E1, adhesion
molecule and apoptosis‑related molecule in rat’s brain
tissue
CYP2E1 protein can be induced by cerebral I/R or hyperlipidemia alone (Tiku et al. 1990). In the present study, as
a key indicator of lipid peroxidation and a source of ROS
contributing to hypoxia injury, CYP2E1 protein expression in brain tissues was detected at 2-h MCAO following 12-h reperfusion in HL or I/R group (P < 0.01 or
P < 0.05, vs sham) (Fig. 6a, b); furthermore, the highest
level of CYP2E1 expression was induced by coexistence of
hyperlipidemia and cerebral I/R injury (P < 0.05, vs I/R;
P < 0.01, vs HL).
Cell adhesion molecules, particularly ICAM-1, are
induced during the early stages of ischemia by TNF-α,
along with other proinflammatory cytokines (De Caterina
et al. 1995; Krunkosky et al. 2000). The protein expressions of ICAM-1and VCAM-1 were further investigated
after 2-h ischemia and 24-h reperfusion to reflect the neutrophil infiltration. The data showed that the levels of ICAM-1
and VCAM-1 in HL, I/R or HL + I/R rats were increased

13

compared with sham rats (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) (Fig. 6c–f),
especially in HL + I/R rats HL or I/R alone (P < 0.01 or
P < 0.05, vs I/R or HL).
Detection of the apoptosis-associated protein expressions is shown in Fig. 7 after 2-h cerebral ischemia and
24-h reperfusion by Western blotting. Release of the apoptogenic protein cytochrome c from the mitochondria into
the cytosol was a hallmark event of cells undergoing apoptosis. It can activate caspase-3, an important pro-apoptotic
protein, while bcl-2 is known as anti-apoptotic protein. No
apparent difference was detected in the protein expressions
of cytochrome c, Apaf-1, bcl-2 and caspase-3 both in HL
and sham group (Fig. 7b–i); however, an obvious transfer of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosolic was
found in I/R, especially in HL + I/R group. Meantime, an
increase in Apaf-1 and caspase-3 expression and a decrease
in bcl-2 expression were also detected in I/R alone compared with sham or HL group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), especially in HL + I/R rats (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), which suggested that hyperlipidemia enhanced cerebral I/R-induced
change of these apoptosis-related molecule although HL
alone seemed to have no effect on these molecules. The
data of multi-label fluorescence immunohistochemistry
also examined that obvious co-localization of cytochrome c
and Apaf-1 was detected in I/R and HL + I/R, especially in

In ischemic stroke, about half of the patients exhibit hyperlipidemia (Zechariah et al. 2013), and subjects with hyperlipidemia in turn have elevated stroke mortality (Leppala et al. 1999; Ansell 2000). However, the etiologic link
between hyperlipidemia and cerebral ischemia has been less
known. Using an experimental hyperlipidemia rat’s model
of cerebral I/R in vivo, we herein showed that hyperlipidemia induced by 8 weeks of HFD resulted in a considerable

increase in serum TG, CHOL and LDL-C, and a remarkable
decrease in serum HDL-C, which in turn associated with
an exacerbation on MCAO/R-induced neurological deficit,
infarct zone and neuronal apoptosis, suggesting the synergistic effect of hyperlipidemia and cerebral I/R on ischemic
brain injury. In the present study, our findings were consistent with the literature stating hyperlipidemia per se is possibly associated with stroke (Meyer et al. 1987). Meanwhile,

our data also showed that although hypercholesterolemia
per se had no direct effect on cerebral ischemic injury, the
synergistic effect on neurological deficit, infarct zone and
TUNEL-positive cell was determined in the rats which fed
with a high-fat diet and following subjected to cerebral I/R
injury.
The previous studies have shown that chronically
increased cholesterol levels trigger a number of vascular

events, such as oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction,
blood–brain barrier disturbances and vascular inflammation
(Duckrow et al. 1985; Steinberg et al. 1997; Takechi et al.
2013), which are closely associated with the development of
cerebral I/R injury (Ishikawa et al. 2004). Although hypercholesterolemia per se is not a direct predictor of stroke, the
condition with high plasma levels of inflammatory-sensitive
proteins links to the increased incidence of stroke (Engstrom
et al. 2002). Our data also showed that although an elevation
on TNF-α and IL-6 levels in brain tissues was caused either
by hyperlipidemia or cerebral I/R alone, the highest level
of TNF-α and IL-6 was induced by coexistence of hyperlipidemia and cerebral I/R, suggesting the synergy effect of
hyperlipidemia and cerebral I/R on circulating inflammatory
process.
Neutrophil infiltration occurs within the first 4–6 h of reperfusion and is mediated by increased expression of local
inflammatory cytokines and cellular adhesion molecules,
including inducible cell adhesion molecule (ICAM), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), etc. (Matsuo et al.
1994). Consistent with the increase in TNF-α and IL-6 levels, we also investigated the protein expressions of ICAM-1
and VCAM-1 in brain tissues. An increase expression of
ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 was existed either in HL or I/R
group. As expected, a strongly increasing on ICAM-1 and
VCAM-1 expressions was induced by coexistence of hyperlipidemia and cerebral I/R.
Ischemia/hypoxia-induced ROS and cytokine can be
scavenged by antioxidants (Clemens 2000). SOD and GSHPx are thought to be two dominant enzymes acting as free
radical scavengers that could prevent the deleterious strokeinduced ROS generation (Cai and Wei 1996). MDA is
increased in acute stroke when SOD is declined, and SOD
and MDA levels correlate well with infarct size, severity and
the outcome of stroke (El Kossi and Zakhary 2000; Gariballa et al. 2002; Polidori and Mecocci 2002). On the other
hand, oxidative stress from hyperglycemia enhances the
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promotes
the impairment of organs (Giugliano et al. 1996; Yoh et al.
2008). Our data showed that cerebral I/R injury obviously
decreased the activities of SOD and GSH-Px and increased
MDA level, which is consistent with the previous studies.
Although hyperlipidemia alone caused no apparent changes
on GSH-Px activity and MDA level, interestingly, it could
promote cerebral I/R-induced effect of SOD, GSH-Px and
MDA levels.
Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is constitutively
expressed in the liver but can also be found in extra hepatic
organs such as the kidneys, lungs and the central nervous system (Renton 2001; Kelicen and Tindberg 2004). It
plays an important role in toxicity of many chemicals and
ethanol, and this enzyme can also generate reactive oxygen

2763

species and substrate-derived radicals that can mediate
lipid peroxidation, protein inactivation and DNA damage
(Cederbaum et al. 2001). Actually, our data showed that an
obvious induction of CYP2E1 was caused by hyperglycemia or cerebral I/R alone, especially in the rats which subjected to HFD combined with cerebral I/R injury. The previous study has also showed that the induction of CYP2E1
oxidizes mitochondrial DNA, protein and lipids and triggers pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, which
further increases mitochondrial ROS (Tiku et al. 1990),
which seemed consistence with the above data in our study.
Increased lipid peroxidation not only damages cell membrane, but also induces secondary intracellular responses
including mitochondria (Oliveira et al. 2006, 35, 41). Since
mitochondria are an important source of ROS (Wigg et al.
2001), mitochondrial dysfunction would promote oxidative stress in turn (Yan et al. 2006) and cytochrome c
would release into the cytosol, cytochrome c, Apaf-1 and
caspase-9 form the holoenzyme that cleaves and activates
downstream caspases such as caspase-3 (Jiang and Wang
2000). Mitochondria play a very important role in regulation of apoptosis by acting as a reservoir for a multitude
of apoptogenic proteins such as cytochrome c and second
mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/direct IAPbinding protein (Yang et al. 1997). Since our data already
showed that the levels of CYP2E1 and TNF-α were
induced by hyperglycemia or cerebral I/R alone, especially
by coexistence of hyperlipidemia and cerebral I/R injury, it
was supposed that more serious mitochondrial dysfunction
was caused under these circumstances. The expressions of
cytochrome c, bcl-2 and caspase-3 in brain tissue were further explored after 2-h ischemia/24-h reperfusion. The data
showed that cytochrome c transfer was observed obviously,
while the increase in Apaf-1 and caspase-3 expression and
the decrease in bcl-2 expression were also detected in I/R
rats. Although hyperglycemia seemed to have no effect on
the levels of cytochrome c, Apaf-1, bcl-2 and caspase-3,
hyperlipidemia could enhance cerebral I/R caused the
change of cytochrome c transfer and the expressions of
Apaf-1, bcl-2 and caspase-3.
In summary, based on an experimental cerebral I/R rat
model combined with hyperlipidemia, the present study
demonstrated that the severe cerebral ischemic injury was
induced by coexistence of hyperlipidemia and acute cerebral I/R injury although hyperlipidemia per se had no direct
effect on cerebral ischemic injury. The mechanism of this
synergistic effect is possibly due to hyperlipidemia enhance
cerebral I/R injury-induced CYP2E1 induction, oxidative
damage, inflammation and neuronal apoptosis. So, it can be
reckoned that the patients of hyperlipidemia have a higher
risk of cerebral neuronal injury when subjected to cerebral
ischemic injury.
