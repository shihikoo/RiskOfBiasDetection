Fibrosis is concomitant with repair processes following injuries in the central nervous system (CNS). Pericytes are
considered as an origin of ﬁbrosis-forming cells in the CNS. Here, we examined whether platelet-derived growth
factor receptor β (PDGFRβ), a well-known indispensable molecule for migration, proliferation, and survival of
pericytes, was involved in the production of extracellular matrix proteins, ﬁbronectin and collagen type I,
which is crucial for ﬁbrosis after ischemic stroke. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated induction of PDGFRβ expression in vascular cells of peri-infarct areas at 3–7 days in a mouse stroke model. The PDGFRβ-expressing cells
extended from peri-infarct areas toward the ischemic core after day 7 while expressing ﬁbronectin and collagen
type I in the infarct areas. In contrast, desmin and α-smooth muscle actin, markers of pericytes, were only
expressed in vascular cells. In PDGFRβ heterozygous knockout mice, the expression of ﬁbronectin and collagen
type I was attenuated at both mRNA and protein levels with an enlargement of the infarct volume after ischemic
stroke compared with that in wild-type littermates. In cultured brain pericytes, the expression of PDGF-B,
PDGFRβ, ﬁbronectin, and collagen type I, but not desmin, was signiﬁcantly increased by serum depletion (SD).
The SD-induced upregulation of ﬁbronectin and collagen type I was suppressed by SU11652, an inhibitor of
PDGFRβ, while PDGF-B further increased the SD-induced upregulation. In conclusion, the expression level of
PDGFRβ may be a crucial determinant of ﬁbrosis after ischemic stroke. Moreover, PDGFRβ signaling participates
in the production of ﬁbronectin and collagen type I after ischemic stroke.

Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Strict
management of its risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
and dyslipidemia, is needed for its prevention. Recent basic and translational studies have demonstrated the efﬁcacy of neural and mesenchymal stem cells for regeneration after injuries of the central nervous
system (CNS) (Honmou et al., 2011; Nakatomi et al., 2002; Parr et al.,
2007). Although such cell therapies are highly promising, the molecular
and cellular mechanisms underlying the regeneration remain to be
shown. Additionally, to induce efﬁcient neural regeneration, the normal
repair processes after ischemic stroke must be shown in detail.

During repair processes after ischemic stroke, most studies have focused on “astrogliosis” that mainly involves reactive astrocytes (Rolls
et al., 2009; Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010). However, it has been
shown that ﬁbrosis occurs primarily in the injured region, while
astrogliosis occurs around the ﬁbrotic lesion after CNS injuries including
ischemic stroke and spinal cord injury (Fernandez-Klett et al., 2013;
Goritz et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2012; Soderblom et al., 2013). The significance of ﬁbrosis still remains unknown. Excessive ﬁbrosis may hinder
regeneration processes, whereas defective ﬁbrosis may delay repair
processes and enlarge injuries. Although it is thought that no ﬁbroblasts
exist in the intact brain, recent evidence has demonstrated that resident
pericytes normally localized in microvessel walls, rather than circulating mesenchymal cells, play a crucial role in mediating ﬁbrosis
(Fernandez-Klett et al., 2013; Goritz et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2012;
Soderblom et al., 2013).
Pericytes were identiﬁed more than one hundred years ago. However, it is quite recently that pericytes have been recognized as important
cells mediating various functions in the CNS (Armulik et al., 2011;
Dufﬁeld et al., 2013; Zlokovic, 2008). Pericytes interact directly with

128

endothelial cells in microvessels (Armulik et al., 2005) at a higher ratio
in the CNS than that in other organs to mediate development and
maintenance of the blood–brain barrier formed by endothelial cells
(Daneman et al., 2010). Furthermore, pericytes regulate angiogenesis,
cerebral blood ﬂow, and immune responses (Armulik et al., 2011;
Kamouchi et al., 2011; Yemisci et al., 2009). Pericytes may also function

as ﬁbrosis-forming cells (Goritz et al., 2011). One of the difﬁculties of
pericyte research in the CNS is the lack of pericyte-speciﬁc markers
(Armulik et al., 2011). Because pericytes exhibit multipotency as a
type of mesenchymal stem cell (Caplan and Correa, 2011; Crisan et al.,
2008), they may be able to alter protein expression proﬁles in response
to changes in the external environment.

Some recent reports demonstrate that platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) can be used as a pericyte marker in the CNS
(Arimura et al., 2012; Renner et al., 2003; Winkler et al., 2010). PDGFRβ
mediates various pericyte functions such as migration, proliferation,
and survival. PDGFRβ homozygous knockout mice display embryonic
lethality because of microvessel dilatation and subsequent hemorrhages
due to defective migration of pericytes toward endothelial cells
(Soriano, 1994). We have recently shown that PDGFRβ might mediate
the survival and proliferation of pericytes in peri-infarct areas after
ischemic stroke (Arimura et al., 2012).
Based on these ﬁndings, it is important to show the signiﬁcance of
ﬁbrosis induced by pericyte-derived cells during repair processes after
ischemic stroke. In the present study, we examined whether PDGFRβ
signaling in pericytes participates in the production of extracellular
matrix (ECM) proteins, an important step in ﬁbrosis. To this end, we examined PDGFRβ heterozygous knockout (PDGFRβ+/−) and their littermates by immunohistochemistry to determine the expression proﬁles
of ﬁbronectin and collagen type I as representative ECM proteins in tissue repair after ischemic stroke. Furthermore, we examined the role of
PDGFRβ signaling in ECM production by cultured pericytes.

Materials and methods
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model
Animal experiments were approved by the animal ethics committee
of Kyushu University. C57BL/6, PDGFRβ heterozygous knockout
(PDGFRβ+/−) and wild-type (WT) S129 littermates were purchased
from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Male mice aged 8–
14 weeks and weighing 20–35 g were used in experiments. Because
the mice with homozygous deletion of PDGFRβ (PDGFRβ−/−) are
dead before birth (Soriano, 1994), we used PDGFRβ+/− mice to characterize the roles of PDGFRβ during the repair phase of ischemic stroke.
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by permanent occlusion of the
right middle cerebral artery (MCA) using a laser-induced photochemical reaction as described previously (Sugimori et al., 2004). Mice were
anesthetized by inhalation of 2% halothane in 70% N2O and 30% O2,
and maintained under anesthesia with 0.8–1% halothane. Rectal temperatures were maintained at 36 °C with a heating lamp. Cerebral
blood ﬂow was measured before and during ischemia by laser Doppler
ﬂowmetry at the ipsilateral bone (~1–2 mm posterior to the bregma).

The right jugular vein was exposed and a catheter was inserted into the
superior vena cava for intravenous administration of a solution. After
the right distal MCA was exposed carefully, a diode-pumped solid
state laser was used to irradiate the distal MCA at a wavelength of
561 nm with 6 mW of emitted power. Upon laser irradiation, a
photosensitizing rose bengal dye solution (20 mg/kg) was administrated intravenously for 90 s. After 4 min of irradiation, the laser beam was
refocused on the MCA just proximal to the ﬁrst position, followed by
another 4 min of irradiation. Then, the right common carotid artery
was ligated with a 6-0 silk suture.

Immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence
Mice were sacriﬁced by deep anesthesia at 3, 7, 14, or 21 days after
MCAO and transcardially perfused with ice-cold saline. Whole brains
were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) for about 1 week. Paraformaldehyde-ﬁxed 2 mm coronal slices
were embedded in parafﬁn and cut into 4 μm thick sections. The sections were then deparafﬁnized, rehydrated through a graded series of
ethanol solutions, and washed in PBS (Arimura et al., 2012). After
blocking with a solution of 5% skim milk powder for 30 min at room
temperature, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies
[rabbit anti-PDGFRβ (1:50–1:100; Cell Signaling Technology, Boston,
MA), goat anti-PDGFRβ (1:50; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN),
mouse anti-desmin (1:100; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), mouse antiﬁbronectin (1:20; BD Transduction Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ),
rabbit anti-collagen type I (1:100–1:200; Acris Antibodies, Herford,
Germany), mouse anti-glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (1:100;
Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-oligodendrocyte lineage
transcription factor 2 (Olig2) (1:50; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), goat
anti-ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) (1:1000;
Immuno-Biological Laboratories, Fujioka, Japan), rat anti-F4/80 (1:50;
Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or mouse anti-microtubule-associated protein
2 (MAP-2) (1:100; Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo, Japan)] at 4 °C overnight. After
thorough washing, the sections were incubated with appropriate
secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor dyes (Invitrogen, Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) or stained with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine
(DAB) using an appropriate kit (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan). For DAB staining, endogenous peroxidase was inactivated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min before blocking with the skim milk solution. Nuclei were

Cell culture
A rat brain capillary pericyte cell line (TR-PCT), conditionally immortalized cells established from tsA58 transgenic rats, was generously provided by Prof. Tetsuya Terasaki (Tohoku University, Japan) (Asashima
et al., 2002; Terasaki et al., 2003). TR-PCT cells were cultured in
Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco, Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Nichirei), 100 U/mL
penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco) at 33 °C in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere with 5% CO2.
PDGF-B treatments
Human recombinant PDGF-B was purchased from Wako (Osaka,
Japan). SU11652, an inhibitor of PDGFRβ, was purchased from
Calbiochem (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). SU11652 is an
ATP-competitive inhibitor of tyrosine kinases and can inhibit some tyrosine kinases other than PDGFRβ. However, IC50, half maximal inhibitory
concentration, of PDGFRβ (IC50 = 3 nM) was considerably lower than
those of other major tyrosine kinases, such as VEGFR2 (IC50 = 27 nM)
and FGFR1 (IC50 = 170 nM). Subconﬂuent TR-PCT cells were incubated
in serum-free DMEM for 24 h and then treated with 10 ng/mL PDGF-B
for 6 h.
PCR and qPCR
Total RNA was prepared from cultured cells or brain tissues using
TRIzol (Invitrogen). A total of 1 μg total RNA was reverse transcribed
with a ReverTra Ace qPCR RT kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Using the reverse transcription product as a template, PCR was performed with
primers speciﬁc for the target genes. After preincubation at 94 °C for

The sections were observed under a BIOREVO BZ-9000 microscope
(Keyence Corporation, Osaka, Japan). Protein quantiﬁcation of immunohistochemistry was performed by assessing ﬁve random, high powered
ﬁelds (×400 magniﬁcation) in the infarct area of each section. The percentages of positive areas were calculated by BZ-II Analyzer software
(Keyence).

Results

5 min, PCR was performed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s,
annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min. Quantitative PCR was performed in duplicate using a LightCycler (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Reaction volumes of 20 μL included 10 μL Thunderbird
SYBR qPCR mix (Toyobo), 0.25 μmol/L primers, and 1 μL cDNA. The
mRNA copy numbers were normalized to 18 s ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
as an internal control. The following primers (Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo,
Japan) were used: PDGFRβ (forward, 5′-TCAACGACTCACCAGTGCTC3′; reverse, 5′-CCACTTCAGAGGCAGGAAAG-3′), ﬁbronectin (forward,
5′-AATGGAAAAGGGGAATGGAC-3′; reverse, 5′-CTCGGTTGTCCTTCTTGC
TC-3′ for mice, forward, 5′-ACCACCCAGAACTACGATGC-3′; reverse, 5′ACACACGTGCACCTCATCAT-3′ for TR-PCT), collagen type I (forward,

AACA-3′ for mice, forward, 5′-AGGCATAAAGGGTCATCGTG-3′; reverse,
5′-ACCGTTGAGTCCATCTTTGC-3′ for TR-PCT), PDGF-B (forward, 5′CTGCCTCTCTGCTGCTACCT-3′; reverse, 5′-GATGAGCTTTCCGACTCGAC3′), desmin (forward, 5′-GGGACATCCGTGCTCAGTAT-3′; reverse, 5′AGAGCATCAATCTCGCAGGT-3′), F4/80 (forward, 5′-TCTGCAGTGTCAGC

rRNA (forward, 5′-AAACGGCTACCACATCCAAG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCTCCA
ATGGATCCTCGTTA-3′).

Temporal and spatial expression proﬁles of PDGFRβ and extracellular
matrix proteins after MCAO
We ﬁrst examined temporal and spatial expression proﬁles of
PDGFRβ after MCAO by immunohistochemistry. Although PDGFRβ expression remained low until day 3, it was increased over 7 days in
peri-infarct areas, which extended toward the ischemic core (Fig. 1a)
and found in all infarct areas after day 14 (Figs. 1a & b). PDGFRβ was
expressed only in vascular walls at earlier phases (day 3–7), but it was
expressed in morphologically ﬁbroblast-like cells after day 7 (Fig. 1a).
We next examined the expression proﬁle of ECM proteins including ﬁbronectin and collagens. The expression patterns of ﬁbronectin and collagens as assessed by Picrosirius-red staining were very similar to that
of PDGFRβ after day 7 (Fig. 1b). In contrast, the expression of desmin
and α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), other representative markers of
pericytes, was restricted to the vascular walls in ischemic areas (Fig. 1b).
PDGFRβ-positive cells extend from peri-infarct areas toward the ischemic
core while expressing ﬁbronectin and collagen type I
To examine whether the PDGFRβ-positive cells produced ﬁbronectin and collagens, we performed dual immunoﬂuorescence staining.
Until day 3 after MCAO, PDGFRβ was co-stained with desmin and collagen type I (Figs. 2a & c), but not ﬁbronectin (Fig. 2b), in the vessel walls
of peri-infarct areas. However, after day 7, PDGFRβ was co-stained with
ﬁbronectin (Figs. 2e & h) and collagen type I (Figs. 2f & i) in whole

ischemic areas and with desmin only in vascular walls of infarct areas
(Figs. 2d & g). These ﬁndings suggested that the PDGFRβ-positive cells
arose from the vascular walls in peri-infarct areas and then extended toward the ischemic core while expressing ﬁbronectin and collagen type I
after MCAO.
To exclude the possibility that PDGFRβ was expressed in cells other
than vascular cells, such as oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC), microglia and astrocytes, after MCAO, we performed immunostaining of
PDGFRβ and Olig2, a marker of OPC, Iba1, a marker of microglia, or
GFAP, a marker of astrocyte. During the repair processes after MCAO,
Olig2 was stained basically outside the areas where PDGFRβ-positive
cells were localized (Fig. 3a). The expression of Iba1 was increased in
peri-infarct areas (Fig. 3b). However, dual immunostaning for PDGFRβ
and Iba1 demonstrated that Iba1-positive microglia accumulated outside the areas PDGFRβ-positive cells were localized and Iba1 did not appear to be co-stained with PDGFRβ (Fig. 3b). Moreover, GFAP-positive
astrocytes were not present in the ischemic core occupied by PDGFRβpositive cells (Fig. 3c) and did not appear to participate directly in the
ﬁbrotic processes. In this context, an interesting ﬁnding was that the ﬁbrotic lesion occupied by PDGFRβ-positive cells (red) appeared to gradually shrink in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3c). This observation
suggested that appropriate formation of ﬁbrotic areas might be beneﬁcial to minimize the infarct volume and induce efﬁcient neural recovery.
Expression of ﬁbronectin and collagen type I is signiﬁcantly attenuated after
MCAO in PDGFRβ+/− mice
To investigate whether PDGFRβ signaling participated in the production of ﬁbronectin and collagen type I after MCAO, we applied
PDGFRβ+/− mice to MCAO and examined the expression of these molecules. In PDGFRβ+/− mice, PDGFRβ expression was signiﬁcantly decreased at both protein (Figs. 4a–c) and mRNA (Fig. 4d) levels with a
signiﬁcantly larger infarct volume at day 7 (Fig. 4e) compared with
those in wild-type mice. In parallel with the decreased expression of
PDGFRβ, the expression levels of both ﬁbronectin and collagen type I
were attenuated at mRNA (Figs. 4h & k) and protein levels (Figs. 4f, g,
i, & j) in PDGFRβ+/− mice compared with those in wild-type mice.
We also examined whether inﬂammatory processes as assessed by
macrophage inﬁltration into infarct areas were affected in PDGFRβ+/−
mice. Immunostaining demonstrated that the inﬁltration of F4/80positive macrophage was not altered in PDGFRβ+/− mice at day 7
after MCAO (Fig. 4l). We have also performed quantitative PCR for F4/
80 using brain homogenates, and found that the expression levels of
F4/80 in infarct areas were not signiﬁcantly different between wildtype and PDGFRβ+/− mice (Fig. 4m).
PDGFRβ signaling participates in the upregulation of ﬁbronectin and
collagen type I in cultured brain pericytes
Finally, we examined whether PDGFRβ signaling participated directly in the upregulation of ﬁbronectin and collagen type I at the cellular
level using cultured brain pericytes. Before the cultured pericytes were
treated with PDGF-B, the cells were cultured under serum-free conditions for 24 h. As a result, we found that serum depletion (SD) signiﬁcantly upregulated the expression of ﬁbronectin (4-fold, p b 0.01)
(Fig. 5a) and collagen type I (5-fold, p b 0.01) (Fig. 5b). We next examined whether the expression of PDGF-B and PDGFRβ was affected by SD.
Both PDGF-B and PDGFRβ were signiﬁcantly upregulated by SD in the
pericytes (Figs. 5c & d). To conﬁrm the involvement of PDGFRβ signaling
in the SD-induced upregulation of ﬁbronectin and collagen type I, we
treated the cultured pericytes with 1 μM SU11652, an inhibitor of
PDGFRβ, under serum-free conditions. The inhibitor signiﬁcantly suppressed the expression of ﬁbronectin and collagen type I (Figs. 5f & g).
In contrast, treatment of the pericytes with PDGF-B (10 ng/mL) under
serum-free conditions further increased the expression of ﬁbronectin
and collagen type I (Figs. 5a & b). However, neither SD nor the PDGFRβ

133

inhibitor affected the expression of desmin in the cultured pericytes
(Figs. 5e & h).
Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that PDGFRβ-expressing
cells appear to arise from vascular wall pericytes in peri-infarct areas
and then extend toward the ischemic core while producing ECM proteins, ﬁbronectin and collagen type I, after MCAO. Results from the experiments using PDGFRβ+/− mice and cultured pericytes indicated
that PDGFRβ signaling was important for the production of these ECM
proteins, and that PDGFRβ-mediated ﬁbrosis may be a determinant of
repair processes after ischemic stroke.
PDGFRβ-positive cells participate in ﬁbrosis of ischemic areas
Based on our results, PDGFRβ-expressing cells were a predominant
cell type and may be responsible for the production of ECM proteins
in ischemic areas during repair processes. In this context, it was important to determine the origin of PDGFRβ-expressing cells. Our detailed
immunohistochemical analyses were consistent with a recent concept
proposed by Goritz et al. (2011). In a spinal cord injury model, they
found two types of pericytes, type A and B, in microvessel walls. Type
A pericytes dissociate from the vascular walls and give rise to ECMproducing stromal cells, whereas type B pericytes remain in the vascular
walls after injury. We considered that this concept may be applicable to
ischemic stroke (Fernandez-Klett et al., 2013), although we cannot
completely exclude the possibility that circulating PDGFRβ-expressing
mesenchymal cells, probably derived from bone marrow, accumulate
and proliferate in ischemic areas (Jung et al., 2011; Kokovay et al., 2006).
Markers of ECM-producing cells derived from type A and B pericytes in the
ischemic brain
Although much attention has been focused on the roles of pericytes
in some disease states of the CNS, including ischemic stroke and
Alzheimer's disease (Arimura et al., 2012; Bell et al., 2010; Zlokovic,
2011), the lack of speciﬁc markers of pericytes makes it difﬁcult to
show the roles of pericytes in the CNS (Armulik et al., 2011). Additionally, the expression levels of candidate pericyte markers may be altered
during the stages of disease states. PDGFRβ, desmin, αSMA, and NG2 are
considered to be markers of pericytes (Armulik et al., 2011; Winkler
et al., 2010). Furthermore, pericytes can produce some extracellular matrix proteins such as ﬁbronectin (Yanqing et al., 2006) and collagen type
I (Lin et al., 2008). The present immunoﬂuorescence analyses demonstrated that PDGFRβ and collagen type I were expressed in vascular
pericytes at low levels even under normal conditions and drastically induced in ﬁbroblast-like cells after MCAO. However, desmin and αSMA
appeared to be expressed only in vascular pericytes and not in
ﬁbroblast-like cells, while ﬁbronectin was hardly expressed in vascular
wall pericytes but was markedly induced in PDGFRβ-expressing
ﬁbroblast-like cells after MCAO.
PDGFRβ signaling participates directly in the production of ﬁbronectin and
collagen type I after ischemic stroke
In the present study, we demonstrated that ﬁbrosis was attenuated
by decreased production of ﬁbronectin and collagen type I in the ischemic areas of PDGFRβ+/− mice. It was originally demonstrated that
PDGFRβ signaling is required for the migration of pericytes to vascular
endothelial tubes during angiogenesis (Soriano, 1994). Thus, PDGFRβ
signaling may be needed to recruit ECM-producing pericytes and/or
ﬁbroblast-like cells into ischemic areas. Additionally, there may be
three possible mechanisms of the participation of PDGFRβ signaling in
ﬁbrosis after ischemic stroke. PDGFRβ signaling may participate in
1) the differentiation of pericytes to ﬁbroblast-like cells, 2) proliferation

134

of pericytes and/or ﬁbroblast-like cells, and 3) production of ECM proteins. Whether PDGFRβ signaling directly mediates the differentiation
of pericytes into ﬁbroblast-like cells may be still controversial and dependent on the tissues/organs (Chen et al., 2011; Rajkumar et al.,
2006). We have recently demonstrated that PDGFRβ signaling mediates
the growth and survival of brain pericytes through Akt activation in
peri-infarct areas (Arimura et al., 2012). In the present study, we demonstrated that PDGFRβ signaling also participated in the production of
ﬁbronectin and collagen type I. Because PDGF-B did not affect the expression of proﬁbrotic molecules transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)
and basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (bFGF) in brain pericytes as demonstrated previously (Arimura et al., 2012), TGFβ and bFGF may not be directly involved in the PDGFRβ-mediated upregulation of ECM proteins.
Fibronectin-mediated ﬁbrosis in ischemic stroke
In general, ﬁbrosis, particularly following chronic inﬂammation, is
considered to be adverse because it hinders normal repair and regeneration processes in various disease states, such as liver and renal ﬁbrosis
(Chen et al., 2011; Peng et al., 2013). Similarly, ﬁbrosis in the CNS may
hinder neural regeneration after ischemic stroke. Thus, there have been
attempts to develop clinically available ﬁbrosis inhibitors (Wynn, 2008).
However, it has been reported that ﬁbronectin plays a crucial role in
tissue repair of the CNS and may induce axonal regeneration (Tom et al.,
2004; Yanqing et al., 2006). Therefore, appropriate ﬁbrotic responses
accompanied by the production of ﬁbronectin, particularly after acute
but not chronic injury, may be needed for neural repair leading to efﬁcient regeneration. Consistently, in PDGFRβ+/− mice, ﬁbrosis was signiﬁcantly suppressed with decreased deposition of ﬁbronectin, which
may be associated with enlargement of the infarct volume (Fig. 4e)
without an increased inﬁltration of inﬂammatory macrophages
(Figs. 4l&m). Thus, we speculate that ﬁbronectin-mediated ﬁbrosis
through PDGFRβ signaling may be necessary to minimize the infarct
volume and elicit prompt repair processes after ischemic stroke, unless
it induces excessive ﬁbrosis. Further studies showing the signiﬁcance of
ﬁbrosis after ischemic stroke will be needed in the future.
In conclusion, the expression level of PDGFRβ may be a crucial determinant of ﬁbrosis that may affect repair processes and the infarct volume after ischemic stroke. Furthermore, PDGFRβ signaling participates
in the production of ﬁbronectin and collagen type I after ischemic stroke.
