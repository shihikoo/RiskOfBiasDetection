Abstract. The profile of microRNAs (miRNAs) altered
following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and
miRNAs are involved in angiogenesis following cerebral
ischemia. miR‑376b‑5p was decreased following MCAO,
however, whether miR‑376b‑5p is important in angiogenesis
remains to be elucidated. The present study was designed to
identify whether miR‑376b‑5p is involved in angiogenesis
following cerebral ischemia and to elucidate the underlying
mechanisms. A rat MCAO model was established and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to analyze
the mRNA expression level of miR‑376b‑5p for 1 to 7 days. In
addition, the density of microvessels and the relative mRNA
and protein levels of hypoxia‑inducible factor‑1 α (HIF‑1α),
vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and Notch1
were measured. The miR‑376b‑5p mimic or the miR‑376b‑5p
inhibitor were transfected into hypoxic human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs), and the proliferation, migration
and tube formation were measured. To further examine the
underlying mechanisms, shRNA was transfected into cells to
knock down HIF‑1α, and angiogenesis and the expression of
associated molecules, including HIF‑1α, VEGFA and Notch1
were compared between each group. Our results demonstrated
that miR‑376b‑5p repressed angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro,
and miR‑376b‑5p inhibited angiogenesis in HUVECs by
targeting the HIF‑1α‑mediated VEGFA/Notch1 signaling
pathway. These findings provide new insights into angiogenesis therapy for cerebral ischemia.
Introduction
Stroke is a life‑threatening disease with a high incidence, high
disability and high mortality rate, causing heavy economic
burden to society and families. Cerebral infarction accounts
for 80% of the total number of strokes (1). In the pathophysiological process of cerebral infarction, the recovery of the
peripheral blood supply is an important factor for nerve cell

prognosis (2). The clinical treatments for cerebral infarction,
include thrombolysis, anticoagulation, blood pressure regulation and microcirculation improvement. The improvement and
increase of blood supply in ischemic brain tissue, particularly
in the ischemic penumbra, thereby improving energy metabolism of ischemic brain cells and saving neurons is one of the
fundamental purposes and fundamental approaches for the
treatment of cerebral ischemia.
In recent years, a series of studies have revealed that good
collateral circulation is able to reduce the infarct volume and
reduce the risk of cerebral infarction recurrence (3,4). Clinical
studies have provided preliminary evidence that promoting
collateral circulation is able to lead to an improved clinical
prognosis (5). Cerebral collateral circulation is blood flow
which arrives in the ischemic area through other vessels
(collateral or the newly formed vascular anastomosis) when
arteries in the brain suffer severe stenosis or occlusion.
Therefore, angiogenesis, as an effective method to improve the
blood supply to the brain, is key for improving the prognosis of
patients with stroke, and has become a major focus of study in
recent years. Therapeutic angiogenesis provides a new therapeutic strategy for revascularization in ischemic stroke (6).
A previous study has demonstrated that a variety of
microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the pathophysiological
process of angiogenesis (7). Since the number of miRNAs is
large and the understanding of their roles is unclear, the role
of miRNAs in the regulation of angiogenesis requires further
study and in depth discussion.
Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the role of
miRNA‑376b‑5p in angiogenesis and the mechanisms mediated by the hypoxia‑inducible factor‑1 α (HIF‑1α) ‑vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)‑Notch1 pathway in cerebral ischemia. To the best of our knowledge, the present study
provides the first demonstration that miR‑376b‑5p is involved
in cerebral ischemia injury and angiogenesis, and also elucidates the regulatory pathway involved.

Committee of Xiangya Medical College, Central South
University (Changsha, China). All procedures involving
animals were performed in accordance with the NIH
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH
Publication no. 86‑23, revised 1986). A pMCAO model was
performed according to a study by Longa et al, however, with

certain modifications  (8). The Sprague-Dawley rats were
provided by the Experimental Animal Center of Central
South University (Changsha, China). Briefly, 48 male adult
Sprague‑Dawley rats aged 6-8 weeks old and weighing
250‑320 g were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of
10% chloral hydrate (4 ml/kg; Xiangya Hospital of Central
South University). Then, the animals were placed in the
supine position and, through a 2‑cm midline incision in the
neck, the right common carotid artery was exposed. Under
an operating microscope, the right external carotid artery
was isolated and coagulated distal to the bifurcation. A 4‑0
nylon suture with a round tip was inserted into the internal
carotid artery through the external carotid artery stump
until mild resistance was felt to occlude the origin of the
middle cerebral artery. Then the wound was closed. Sham
surgery animals were anaesthetized and were subjected to
artery isolation without MCAO. Neurological function was
evaluated following surgery by Longa's score (8). Animals
with scores of 1‑3 were included. Following the duration of
ischemia for 1, 3 and 7 days, rats in the MCAO group were
anesthetized and perfused transcardially with sodium chloride followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Decapitation was
performed to remove the brains quickly.
TTC staining. Male adult Sprague‑Dawley rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate
(4 ml/kg) and decapitation was performed to remove the
brains quickly. The brains were refrigerated at ‑80˚C for
5 min and then cut into sections of ~2 mm thickness. The
brain slices were added to 2% TTC (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA) at 37˚C for 20  min and then stirred to stain
completely. Following staining, the brain slices were fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 24 h.
Immunohistochemistry. The brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h prior to being embedded in paraffin. For
immunohistochemistry, serial sections (4 µm) were mounted
on slides to dewax and rehydrate. Following antigen retrieval
under high pressure in citrate buffer, goat serum (ZSGB-BIO
Company, Beijing, China) was used to inhibit nonspecific
staining and 3% hydrogen peroxide was added to inhibit
endogenous peroxidase activity. The slides were incubated
with primary antibodies [chicken polyclonal to von Willebrand
factor (vWF) antibody; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA, 1:200]
at 37˚C for 1 h followed by incubation with a secondary antibody [goat anti-chicken IgY (HRP), Abcam]. The horseradish
peroxidase reaction was detected using the DAB staining
kit (Maixin, Fuzhou, Fujian, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The slides were counterstained with
hematoxylin and eosin. All the slides were visualized under a
microscope (E200; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).
Cell culture. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs) were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). The cells in the normal
group were maintained in DMEM (Gibco‑BRL, Grand Island,
NY, USA), supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum
(Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37˚C in
a humidified 5% CO2, 95% O2 atmosphere. The medium was
adjusted every 2‑3 days and the cells were routinely split into

two cultures after 4 days. The cells in the hypoxia group were
maintained in DMEM without serum at 37˚C in a humidified
5% CO2, 94% N2, 1% O2 atmosphere.
Transfection. Prior to transfection of the miR‑376b‑5p
mimic/inhibitor and HIF‑1α shRNA, a pre‑experiment was
performed to select the most effective HIF‑1α shRNA fragment. HUVECs were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. After 6 h, the cells were washed and maintained
in the cultures for at least 24 h for further analysis.
MTT assay. HUVECs were seeded into 96‑well plates and
allowed to grow for the appropriate times, and then 10 µl of
MTT solution (0.5 mg/ml; Beyotime, Shanghai, China) was
added to each well and incubated at 37˚C for 4 h. DMSO (150 µl;
Sigma) was added and incubated for 15 min to dissolve the
formazan crystals. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm
by a microplate reader (ELx800NB; BioTek Instruments, Inc.,
Winooski, VT, USA).
Tube formation assay. The tube formation assay was performed
using HUVECs on Matrigel. BD Matrigel matrix (200 µl; BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) was added to 24‑well
plates on ice. Then, it was incubated at 37˚C in 5% CO2 for
30 min to allow gel formation. HUVECs were digested and the
cells were suspended at a density of 4x105/ml. Following gel
solidification for 30 min, 50 µl of cell suspension was added
to each well and the cell culture medium was compensated to
1 ml. The plates were incubated at 37˚C in 5% CO2. Following
incubation for 2, 4 and 8 h, tube formation was observed using
an inverted microscope (TS100; Nikon). Image‑Pro Plus 5.0
(BD Biosciences) software was used and 10 different visual
fields were selected to analyze the tube lengths.
Transwell migration assay. The cell migration experiments
were performed using a 6‑well Transwell system (8  µm;
Corning, Inc., Corning, NY, USA). The cells were digested,
following washing with phosphate‑buffered saline, and
counted and resuspended in media without serum to obtain
a cell density of 5x10 4/ml. Cell media with fetal bovine
serum (1 ml; Invitrogen Life Technologies) was added to the
lower chamber and 2 ml of cell suspension was added to the
Transwell plates. Following incubation for 12, 24 and 48 h,
the upper chamber was fixed in 95% ethanol for 15 min and
stained with hematoxylin for 10 min. The cells were counted
under the TS100 microscope.
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Total RNAs
were isolated from cerebral infarction or HUVECs using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies). According
to the manufacturer's instructions, 2  µg of total RNA was
used for reverse transcription using a cDNA synthesis kit
(RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit; Fermentas,
Vilnius, Lithuania). The samples were quantified by qPCR in a
7300 Sequence Detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA) using an SYBR‑Green PCR kit (Applied
Biosystems). The relative expression level was calculated by
the comparative CT method. The sequences of the amplified miRNA transcripts were as follows: rno‑miR‑376b‑5p,

Western blot analysis. The protein samples were loaded onto
SDS‑PAGE (Beyotime) and separated by electrophoresis.
Then, proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane
(EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) and
incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin (Amresco Inc., Solon,
OH, USA) at 37˚C for 1 h. The blots were probed with specific
primary antibodies (rabbit polyclonal to Notch1 and rabbit
polyclonal to VEGFA, Abcam; rabbit monoclonal to HIF-1α,
EMD Millipore Corporation; mouse monoclonal to GAPDH,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and
then the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase‑conjugated secondary antibody at 37˚C for 1 h. The signals
were visualized using a chemiluminescence‑based detection
system (ECL Western Blotting kit; Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.,
Rockford, IL, USA).

Results
TTC staining certifies that the pMCAO model was established
successfully. As shown in Fig. 1, TTC staining demonstrated
that in the pMCAO groups, the infarction area was white and
the normal brain tissue was red (dark grey in Fig. 1). The
infarction scope in the cerebral tissue was consistent with the
blood‑supply region controlled by the middle cerebral artery.
The brain tissue in the sham group was uniformly red. The
pMCAO model was established successfully.
vWF expression increases following MCAO. vWF immunohistochemistry images of cerebral infarction following
MCAO are shown in Fig. 2. vWF‑positive cells were confined
to the endothelial cells in microvessels of the infarction area.
The results demonstrated that the vWF‑positive cell number

significantly increased following MCAO compared with the
sham group (P<0.05). These data suggested that angiogenesis
was induced following cerebral ischemia.
miR‑376b‑5p is downregulated following MCAO. To examine
the expression changes of miR‑376b‑5p in cerebral ischemia,
qPCR was used to analyze the relative mRNA expression level

530

LI et al: ROLE OF miR-376B-5P IN ANGIOGENESIS in vivo AND in vitro

of miRNA‑376b‑5p following MCAO. The relative mRNA
level in the sham group was designated as 1 and it was revealed
that miRNA‑376b‑5p was gradually downregulated 1  day
(0.79±0.03) after MCAO (P<0.05) and then decreased rapidly
to the minimum 7 days (0.06±0.01) after MCAO (P<0.01).
Therefore, miRNA‑376b‑5p appears to be involved in cerebral
ischemia.
Alterations in the mRNA and protein level of HIF‑1α, VEGFA
and Notch1 following MCAO. To investigate the basis for angiogenesis following cerebral ischemia, the present study examined
the relative expression of HIF‑1α, VEGFA and Notch1 at the
mRNA and protein level following MCAO. As shown in Fig. 3,
qPCR and western blotting results indicated that the mRNA and
protein expression level in the sham group was low, and it was
significantly increased from baseline 1 day after MCAO (P<0.05)
and continued to increase up to 7 days (P<0.01). In addition, the
results demonstrated that the alterations in VEGFA and Notch1
at the mRNA and protein level were significantly increased from
1 day after MCAO (P<0.05) and remained at high levels until
7 days (P<0.01). These data indicated that HIF‑1α, VEGFA and
Notch1 are involved in angiogenesis following cerebral ischemia.
Hypoxia downregulates miR‑376b‑5p in HU VECs.
miR‑376b‑5p was suggested to be downregulated in rat
cerebral ischemia. HUVECs were used as an in vitro model
to further examine whether hypoxia regulates the expression
of miR‑376b‑5p. HUVECs were grown either in normoxia or
hypoxia for different time periods (24 or 48 h) and alterations
in miR‑376b‑5p levels were determined by qPCR. The results
were consistent with the in vivo study; miR‑376b‑5p levels
were decreased in hypoxia for 24 and 48 h compared with
those in normoxia (P<0.05; Fig. 4A).
Hypoxia induces angiogenesis in HUVECs. In the in vivo study,
angiogenesis was induced following MCAO and the role of
hypoxia in angiogenesis in vitro was further investigated. To
examine whether hypoxia was able to affect the viability of
HUVECs, an MTT assay was performed. Compared with the
normoxia group, the viability of HUVECs was repressed in the
hypoxia group at 12 h and then increased up to 48 h (Fig. 4B).
Since tube formation and cell migration were important processes
in angiogenesis, the tube length and migrated cell number of
HUVECs in hypoxia were further examined. The present study
revealed that differences in tube lengths at 2 h between the
normoxia and hypoxia group were not significant (4.73±0.88 
vs. 5.69±1.02 µm; P>0.05); however, with time, the lengths of
the tubes increased in the hypoxia group at 4 and 8 h compared
with the normoxia group (4 h: 37.31±7.98 vs. 22.97±5.12 µm;
8 h: 85.43±19.11 vs. 53.32±9.12 µm; P<0.05) (Fig. 4C). The
cell migration ability was investigated by Transwell migration
assay and it was revealed that the difference in the migration
cell number between normoxia and hypoxia groups was not
clear at 12 h (22±5 vs. 23±4; P>0.05); however, at 24 and 48 h,
the migration cell number in the hypoxia group significantly
increased compared with the normoxia group (24 h: 62±9 vs.
25±6; P<0.05; 48 h: 71±15 vs. 34±8; P<0.01) (Fig. 4D).

following cerebral ischemia, the miR‑376b‑5p mimic and
the miR‑376b‑5p inhibitor were transfected into HUVECs to
study whether the expression level of miR‑376b‑5p was able
to affect the process of angiogenesis in response to ischemia
injury. The transfection efficiency of the miR‑376b‑5p mimic
group and the miR‑376b‑5p inhibitor group was ~80%. The
relative mRNA level of miR‑376b‑5p in hypoxic HUVECs
transfected with negative control miRNA (miR‑NC) was
designated to be 1. The mRNA level of miR‑376b‑5p
increased significantly in miR‑376b‑5p mimic‑transfected
HUVECs (5.54±0.38) compared with miR‑NC‑transfected
cells (P<0.01), and the level of miR‑376b‑5p mRNA decreased

significantly in the miR‑376b‑5p inhibitor group (0.3±0.13)
compared with the miR‑NC group (P<0.01) (Fig. 5A). Using
HUVECs in hypoxia with miR‑NC‑transfected cells as the
control, the data suggested that the miR‑376b‑5p mimic was
able to significantly repress hypoxia‑induced increases in the
cell viability of HUVECs; however, the miR‑376b‑5p inhibitor
enhanced hypoxia‑induced increases in the cell viability of
HUVECs (Fig. 5B). These results indicated that miR‑376b‑5p
represses the cell viability of HUVECs in hypoxia. Next, the
present study investigated the tube lengths in HUVECs and
revealed that the miR‑376b‑5p mimic and miR‑376b‑5p inhibitor did not affect tube formation at 2 h (P>0.05). However, with

532

LI et al: ROLE OF miR-376B-5P IN ANGIOGENESIS in vivo AND in vitro

time, the tube lengths decreased in the miR‑376b‑5p mimic
group at 4 and 8 h compared with the miR‑NC group (P<0.01)
while the miR‑376b‑5p inhibitor reversed this decrease
(P<0.01) (Fig. 5C). In addition, the present study examined
whether the expression level of miR‑376b‑5p was able to affect
cell migration. The results illustrated that the miR‑376b‑5p
mimic significantly decreased the migration cell number
compared with the hypoxia group (P<0.01) and this effect
was reversed by the miR‑376b‑5p inhibitor (P<0.05) (Fig. 5D).
Overall, these results suggest that miR‑376b‑5p represses
angiogenesis in hypoxic HUVECs.
miR‑376b‑5p represses angiogenesis via the HIF‑1α target
gene. To further examine the role of miR‑376b‑5p in angiogenesis during hypoxia and its mechanism of regulation, the present
study predicted the targets of miR‑376b‑5p by PicTar (http://
pictar.mdc-berlin.de/) and focused on HIF‑1α. The protein
expression of HIF‑1α was rare in normoxia, however, it
was induced increasingly under hypoxia (0.035±0.005 vs.
0.146±0.049; P<0.05). shRNA against HIF‑1α was transfected
into hypoxic HUVECs, as shown in Fig. 6A and, following
transfection, HIF‑1α significantly decreased at the protein
level (P<0.01). The MTT assay revealed that cell viability
in the shRNA + inhibitor group was lower than that of the
inhibitor group and the hypoxia group at 24 and 48 h (Fig. 6B).
The tube formation experiment demonstrated that the length
of tubes at 8 h in the shRNA + inhibitor group was decreased
compared with the inhibitor group, also the tube lengths in
the shRNA groups were decreased compared with the hypoxia
group (Fig.  6C). Furthermore, the migration cell number
in the shRNA groups decreased at 24 h compared with the
mimic/inhibitor groups and hypoxia group (Fig. 6D). The same
results were also observed in those at 4 h (data not shown). All
these data suggested that miR‑376b‑5p is able to directly bind
to the HIF‑1α gene, which is important in angiogenesis.
miR‑376b‑5p represses the expression of angiogenesis via
the HIF‑1α mediated VEGFA‑Notch1 pathway. To confirm
that miR‑376b‑5p represses angiogenesis during hypoxia
through the HIF‑1α‑VEGFA‑Notch1 pathway, VEGFA and
Notch1 relative mRNA and protein levels were also measured
by qPCR and western blot analysis. VEGFA relative mRNA
and protein level in the hypoxia group were higher than
in the normoxia group (0.049±0.015 vs. 0.137±0.041 for
protein; P<0.05). Following transfection of the mimic or
inhibitor for 48 h, the miR‑376b‑5p mimic reduced the relative mRNA and protein levels of VEGFA compared with the
miR‑NC group (0.070±0.022 vs. 0.118±0.029 for protein;
P<0.05). The miR‑376b‑5p inhibitor significantly enhanced
hypoxia‑induced increases in the relative mRNA and protein
levels of VEGFA (0.246±0.074 vs. 0.118±0.029 for protein;
P<0.05). The mRNA and protein levels of Notch1 also
increased in the hypoxia group compared with the normoxia
group (0.055±0.015 vs. 0.140±0.040 for protein; P<0.05)
and the miR‑376b‑5p mimic reduced the relative mRNA
and protein levels of Notch1 to low levels (P<0.05). The
miR‑376b‑5p inhibitor had an opposite effect and the relative mRNA and protein levels of Notch1 were significantly
increased in the miR‑376b‑5p inhibitor group compared
with that in the miR‑NC group (NC, 0.128±0.033; mimic,

The relative mRNA and protein levels of VEGFA in the
shRNA groups were lower than those of the mimic/inhibitor
groups, and they were also lower than those in the hypoxia
group (Fig. 7A). The results also demonstrated that the relative mRNA and protein levels of Notch1 decreased in the
shRNA groups compared with the mimic/inhibitor groups
and hypoxia group (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that
miR‑376b‑5p downregulates VEGFA and Notch1 expression
at the mRNA and protein levels and HIF‑1α mediated this
effect.

Discussion
miRNAs are ~22 nt long non‑coding RNAs, which are widely
present in eukaryotic organisms. They control mRNA levels
and function by binding to the 3'‑UTR (9‑13). The binding
of miRNAs is considered to either degrade the mRNAs or
repress translation (14‑15). miRNAs are involved in numerous
complex physiological processes, including growth and
development, organogenesis, cell proliferation and apoptosis.
Kulshreshtha  et  al first reported that hypoxia was able to
induce expression changes in miRNAs in cells in 2007 (16).
Then, a number of studies revealed that the expression profiles
of miRNAs also altered following ischemia and hypoxia in
certain organs, including the retina, myocardium and hippocampus (17‑19).
In a study by Dharap et al (20), the authors profiled miRNAs
following transient MCAO in the adult rat brain. The expression of 238 miRNAs were evaluated between 3 h and 3 days.
Compared with the sham group, eight miRNAs were increased
and 12 miRNAs were decreased in at least four out of five
reperfusion time points. These studies indicate a critical role
of miRNAs in controlling mRNA transcription and translation
in the post‑ischemic brain. Among the 12 decreased miRNAs,
rno‑miR‑376b‑5p was demonstrated to be decreased from 3 h
to 3 days by miRNA microarray analysis. The present study
focused on the expression of miR‑376b‑5p using qPCR.
In our in vivo study, a rat pMCAO model was constructed
and the mRNA expression level of miR‑376b‑5p in the
cerebral infarct area was observed from 1 to 7 days using
qPCR. The results demonstrated that rno‑miR‑376b‑5p
altered following focal ischemia. The mRNA expression level
decreased compared with the sham group, which was consistent with miRNA microarray analysis in the study by Dharap
et al (20). In our in vitro study, the mRNA expression level
of miR‑376b‑5p in the hypoxia group was downregulated
compared with the normoxia group. The results in vivo and
in vitro suggested that miR‑376b‑5p is involved in the regulation of the pathophysiological process following ischemic
brain injury.
Angiogenesis is a process involving the proliferating,
remodeling and sprouting of endothelial cells and subsequent
formation of new blood vessels from pre‑existing vasculature (21). Certain insults, including brain trauma and ischemia
were able to induce angiogenesis (22,23).
vWF is a specific surface marker of endothelial cells. In
the current study, for angiogenesis analysis in vivo, immunocytochemistry was used with the vWF antibody to label
microvessels in the cerebral infarct area following MCAO.

cells; NC, negative control; miR, microRNA.

The in vivo results suggested that the mean microvessel
density was increased 1, 3 and 7 days following MCAO, therefore, it confirmed that responsive angiogenesis was induced
following cerebral ischemia. It has been demonstrated that
the proliferation, migration and morphological differentiation of endothelial cells are important in angiogenesis. In our
in vitro study, the results suggested that the proliferation,
migration and tube formation of HUVECs were increased
under hypoxia. These results also verified that angiogenesis

was induced following hypoxia, which was consistent with the
results in vivo.
Angiogenesis is regulated by activator and inhibitor molecules and signaling pathways (24). These growth factors and
kinases affect vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle
cells, stimulating the migration, proliferation and differentiation of endothelial cells, and then new blood vessels form by
the sprouting of new capillaries.
VEGFA is the most important activator molecule in the
process of angiogenesis. VEGFA is important in angiogenesis
following cerebral ischemia (25). It has been revealed that the
expression of VEGFA is closely associated with microvessel
density and new vascular density in tissue; VEGFA has been
demonstrated to participate in the capillary formation and
improve the blood flood surrounding the infarction area (26).
VEGFA also demonstrated a neuroprotective effect by
improving local microcirculation, promoting the injured nerve
generation and neural proliferation (27‑31).
Numerous studies have confirmed that the Notch signaling
system is important in the proliferation and differentiation of
endothelial cells. There are four Notch genes in mammals,
encoding four Notch receptors, Notch 1, Notch 2, Notch 3
and Notch 4, and five Notch ligands, DII1, DII3, DII4, Jagged
l and Jagged 2. The Notch signaling system is involved in
angiogenesis (32,33). Previous studies have demonstrated that
the Notch signaling pathway is involved in and controls the
formation of new blood vessels accompanied with the VEGFA
pathway (34). VEGFA, as an upstream regulator of Notch (34),
combined with its receptor VEGFR, then induced the expression of Notch 1 and its ligand DII4, and the transcription of
Notch target genes were initiated to promote angiogenesis.
The expression of VEGFA is regulated by numerous
factors and hypoxia is the strongest known regulator. HIF‑1α
is a nuclear transcription factor induced by hypoxia and its
expression can be found in all mammalian cells during
hypoxia. Experimental studies suggested that following
cerebral ischemia, the areas where the expression of HIF‑1α
is found is considered to be the region in chronic hypoxia
around the infarct area  (35,36). HIF‑1α is important in
mediating signal transfer between hypoxia and angiogenesis.
Hypoxic cells induce the expression of VEGFA via activating
HIF‑1α (37). Zhang et al (25) revealed that following focal
cerebral ischemia, the expression of VEGFA and VEGFR
were significantly increased around the infarcted area. The
expression of HIF‑1α was also increased around the infarcted
area. Therefore, hypoxia‑induced HIF‑1α‑VEGFA‑Notch1
angiogenesis is suggested to be an important pathway in
angiogenesis regulation.
In the present study, the in vivo and in vitro results revealed
that the expression of HIF‑1α at the mRNA and protein levels
were rare in normoxia, however, it was increasingly induced
under hypoxia. In addition, the expression of VEGFA and
Notch1 were upregulated in the hypoxia group at the mRNA and
protein levels compared with the normoxia group. These results
illustrated that hypoxia‑induced upregulation of VEGFA and
Notch1 is associated with the increased expression of HIF‑1α.
Studies regarding the regulatory effect of miRNAs on
angiogenesis are increasing. Certain studies demonstrated that
the expression profiles of a series of miRNAs altered following
ischemia, and certain miRNAs are important in angiogen-

esis  (20,38,39). Therefore, identifying miRNA expression
profiles targeting angiogenesis and further studying its regulatory mechanisms are of great significance for the treatment of
stroke.
To further examine the role of miR‑376b‑5p in angiogenesis during cerebral ischemia, the miR‑376b‑5p mimic
and miR‑376b‑5p inhibitor were transfected into hypoxic
HUVECs. The proliferation, migration and tube formation
of HUVECs were measured for estimating angiogenesis. The
results demonstrated that the miR‑376b‑5p mimic downregulated angiogenesis and the miR‑376b‑5p inhibitor upregulated
angiogenesis. These results verified that miRNA‑376b‑5p was
able to regulate angiogenesis.
A functional link between miRNA expression and
HIF‑1α has been identified by certain studies. HIF‑1α is
able to be targeted by the miR‑17‑92 cluster, miR‑424 and
miR‑20b  (40‑42). A specific group of miRNAs have been
reported to be induced in response to hypoxia, at least partially
via a HIF‑1‑dependent mechanism (16).
The present study predicted the targets of miR‑376b‑5p
by target prediction programs and focused on HIF‑1α. Next,
to examine the underlying mechanisms responsible for our
observation, it was suggested that miRNA‑376b‑5p regulates
angiogenesis via the HIF‑1α‑VEGFA‑Notch1 pathway. HIF‑1α
was knocked down by the transfection of shRNA. The results
demonstrated that following transfection, the expression of
HIF‑1α was low. The miRNA‑376b‑5p mimic or miR‑376b‑5p
inhibitor was not able to affect angiogenesis via HIF‑1α, thus
the angiogenesis index, including proliferation, migration,
tube formation and the expression of angiogenesis‑related
molecules VEGFA/Notch1 was significantly different from the
mimic/inhibitor group. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that following shRNA transfection, the angiogenesis
index and the expression of angiogenesis‑related molecules
VEGFA/Notch1 were significantly different from the hypoxia
group. It was suggested that since HIF‑1α expression was
significantly decreased compared with the hypoxia group; the
HIF‑1α mediated signal between hypoxia and angiogenesis was
repressed.
In conclusion, the present study systematically demonstrated that miR‑376b‑5p potently inhibited angiogenesis in the
rat MCAO model in vivo and miR‑376b‑5p was able to effectively inhibit the proliferation, migration and tube formation
of HUVECs in vitro. To the best of our knowledge, the present
study demonstrated for the first time that miR‑376b‑5p inhibits
angiogenesis in HUVECs by targeting the HIF‑1α‑mediated
VEGFA/Notch1 signaling pathway. In view of the important
role of miRNA in the regulation of angiogenesis, identifying
new miRNAs targeting angiogenesis and further examining its
regulatory pathways and mechanisms, making miRNAs a new
target for the treatment of ischemic diseases, are of important
instructive significance in vascular repair for the clinical treatment of ischemic stroke.
