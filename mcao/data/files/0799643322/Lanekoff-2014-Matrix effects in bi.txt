Matrix eﬀects in mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) may aﬀect the
observed molecular distribution in chemical and biological systems. In
this study, we use mouse brain tissue of a middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) stroke model to examine matrix eﬀects in nanospray desorption electrospray ionization MSI (nano-DESI MSI). This is
achieved by normalizing the intensity of the sodium and potassium
adducts of endogenous phosphatidylcholine (PC) species to the
intensity of the corresponding adduct of the PC standard supplied at a
constant rate with the nano-DESI solvent. The use of MCAO model
with an ischemic region localized to one hemisphere of the brain
enables immediate comparison of matrix eﬀects within one ion image.
Furthermore, signiﬁcant diﬀerences in sodium and potassium
concentrations in the ischemic region in comparison with the healthy
tissue allowed us to distinguish between two types of matrix eﬀects.
Speciﬁcally, we discuss matrix eﬀects originating from variations in
alkali metal concentrations and matrix eﬀects originating from variations in the molecular composition of the tissue. Compensation for
both types of matrix eﬀects was achieved by normalizing the signals
corresponding to endogenous PC to the signals of the standards. This
approach, which does not introduce any complexity in sample preparation, eﬃciently compensates for signal variations resulting from
diﬀerences in the local concentrations of sodium and potassium in
tissue sections and from the complexity of the extracted analyte
mixture derived from local variations in molecular composition.

Introduction
MSI provides detailed information on the spatial localization of
molecules in biological systems by recording mass spectra
directly from specic locations on the sample surface.1–7 The
strength of MSI is the ability to reveal regional chemical
changes using diminutive amounts of sample. However, analyte

ionization eﬃciency in MSI is dependent on the chemical
composition of the surrounding matrix at the time of ionization, making it prone to matrix eﬀects.8 The presence of cations
during ionization aﬀects the eﬃciency of adduct formation in
positive mode (e.g. protonation or alkali ion adduct formation)
while the presence of other molecules, originating from the
sampled region, can aﬀect the analyte signal.9 Matrix eﬀects
which arise from the competition of analyte molecules for
charge, have been reported in MSI of drugs in tissue
sections10–16 while matrix eﬀects caused by changes in cation
concentration have been observed in MSI of brain injury and
stroke models.17–21 For example, MSI studies of ischemic brain
tissues report increased ion signals of phosphatidylcholine (PC)
cationized on sodium and decreased signals of protonated PC
and PC cationized on potassium in comparison with normal
brain tissue.17,19,20,22 These observations were attributed to the
diﬀerences in concentrations of sodium and potassium in the
corresponding tissues. To overcome matrix eﬀects caused by
variations in the alkali ion concentration, Wang et al. developed
an approach for desalting brain tissue sections prior to MSI
experiments.20 MSI studies of brain tissue from stroke models
have found an increase of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in the
ischemic region. This increase of LPC may be a result of
degradation of PC by phospholipase A2 activated in ischemic
tissue by the release of glutamate.23–27
Development of MSI approaches that account for matrix
eﬀects is critically important for obtaining accurate spatial
localization of molecules in biological systems. Herein, we
describe an approach that compensates for matrix eﬀects in
nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI) and
enables accurate ambient imaging of tissue sections with
minimal sample preparation. Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique that utilizes gentle localized liquid extraction
of molecules from the sample surface followed by electrospray
ionization.28–32 Nano-DESI has been used for imaging and
quantication of drugs and endogenous lipids in tissue
sections10,33–35 as well as tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)
imaging.36 In this study, we use the middle cerebral artery

occlusion (MCAO) stroke model which produces a localized
ischemic region on one hemisphere of the brain leaving another
side intact.27,37–41 The substantial increase in sodium and
decrease in potassium concentration as a result of ischemia and
their eﬀect on ion images are of particular importance to this
study. Because both the ischemic and the control region are
present in the same sample, MCAO brain tissue sections are
excellent model systems for studying two types of matrix eﬀects:
(1) matrix eﬀects originating from variations in alkali cation
concentrations, and (2) matrix eﬀects originating from variations in the molecular composition of the tissue. PC species are
highly abundant in the mass spectrum of brain tissues and are
therefore excellent targets for evaluation of new MSI
approaches. We have previously shown that endogenous PC can
be quantied in nano-DESI imaging by doping the solvent with
two PC standards and using carbon factors33 but could not
systematically examine matrix eﬀects in MSI. Here, we use the
MCAO mouse model system to identify and compensate for
diﬀerent types of matrix eﬀects in nano-DESI MSI. We demonstrate that doping the solvent with a single PC standard in nanoDESI MSI enables acquisition of ion images of PC and LPC free
of matrix eﬀects. Compensation for matrix eﬀects in nano-DESI
MSI is achieved by normalizing ion images of endogenous
species to the ion image of the corresponding alkali metal
adduct of the standard. This study contributes to a fundamental
understanding of matrix eﬀects in MSI and establishes nanoDESI MSI as a robust tool for lipid imaging in complex tissue
sections.

Experimental section
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in three C57BL/6 mice
(male, 8–12 weeks, Jackson Laboratories, West Sacramento, CA)
by MCAO as previously published.42,43 This model produces a
highly reproducible infarct in C57BL/6 mice and has been used
extensively as a model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.41
Mice were briey induced with 3% isourane and maintained
with 1.5–2% throughout the surgery. The middle cerebral artery
(MCA) was blocked by threading silicone-coated 7-0 monolament nylon surgical suture through the external carotid to
the internal carotid, and nally blocking its bifurcation into the
MCA and anterior cerebral artery. The lament was maintained
for 60 min while the mice were maintained under anesthesia.
The lament was removed, and blood ow restored. Cerebral
blood ow (CBF) was monitored with Laser Doppler Flowmetry
(Transonic System Inc.). Any mouse that did not maintain a CBF
during occlusion of <20% of baseline or failed to reach >80% of
baseline following removal of suture was excluded from the
study. Temperature was maintained at 37  C  0.5  C with a
rectal thermometer-controlled heating pad and lamp (Harvard
Apparatus). Two hours following restoration of blood ow, the
mouse was perfused with cold, heparinized saline, the brain
was removed, ash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
80  C prior to coronal cryo-sectioning (Cryostar NX70, Thermo
Scientic). 12 mm thick tissue sections were thaw-mounted onto
regular glass slides and three sections from each mouse were
imaged.

The nano-DESI probe was assembled using two fused silica
capillaries (50  150 mm, ID  OD, Polymicro Technologies)
mounted in a capillary holder, as described elsewhere.36 The tip
of the primary capillary was beveled using a microbeveler
(Microbeveler 48000, World Precision Instruments, Inc.) to
avoid scratching the surface during MSI. Two standards, PC
12:0/13:0 and PC 21:0/22:6 (Avanti Polar Lipids), were diluted in
methanol to a nal concentration of 4.69 mM and 4.31 mM,
respectively, and supplied through the primary capillary at 0.5
mL min1 using a syringe pump (Legato 180, KD Scientic). The
sample was continuously moved in lines, spaced by 200 mm,
under the nano-DESI probe at a velocity of 40 mm s1. The
distance between the sample and the probe was controlled
using a motorized XYZ stage programmed to account for the tilt
of the plane in which the sample resided, as described elsewhere.34 Mass spectra were continuously acquired in a full scan
mode (m/z 100–2000, mass resolution of m/Dm ¼ 60 000) using
an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientic). A
high voltage of 3 kV was applied to the primary capillary and the
heated inlet was kept at 250  C. Raw data were obtained with
XCalibur (Thermo Scientic) and processed using MSI-Quickview, a program developed at PNNL and described in detail
elsewhere.34 PC species were identied using MS/MS.

Results and discussion
Spectra comparison between healthy and ischemic region
In MCAO mouse models, brain ischemia is induced on one
hemisphere of the brain with the other hemisphere presenting
a control tissue largely unaﬀected by stroke. As a result, imaging
of coronal brain tissue sections facilitates direct comparison of
healthy and ischemic tissue in one experiment.40 Nano-DESI
spectra from healthy and ischemic striatum are shown in
Fig. 1A and B, respectively. The spectra are dominated by PC
species cationized on sodium and potassium while protonated
PC species are observed as minor peaks. The most abundant
peaks found in the spectrum from the healthy side of the brain
are m/z 798.54, [PC 34:1 + K]+, and m/z 772.52, [PC 32:0 + K]+. The
most abundant peaks found in the spectrum from the ischemic
region originate from the same PC cationized on sodium
instead of potassium; m/z 782.57, [PC 34:1 + Na]+, and m/z
756.55, [PC 32:0 + Na]+. This shi in cationization between the
healthy and the ischemic region observed for all the peaks in
the mass spectrum can be rationalized assuming that there is a
signicant diﬀerence in the amount of sodium and potassium
in healthy and ischemic tissues, which is consistent with
previous studies.17,19–21,37,38,44–46 Specically, atomic spectroscopy
analysis demonstrated signicantly elevated sodium and
reduced potassium concentrations at the ischemic site of MCAO
rats.37
Because ion signals in MSI experiments depend both on the
concentration of alkali cations and the molecular composition,
accurate determination of analyte localization in MSI is challenging. In this study, we examine signal suppression in MSI by
adding standards into the nano-DESI solvent and monitoring
the signal of the standard as a function of the position on the
tissue sample. Furthermore, we show eﬃcient compensation

for matrix eﬀects by normalizing ion images of endogenous PC
and LPC species extracted from the tissue sample to the ion
image of an appropriate adduct of the PC or LPC standard. In
this experiment, we added four standards of known concentration, LPC 13:0, LPC 17:1, PC 12:0/13:0 (hereaer referred to
as PC 25:0) and PC 21:0/22:6 (hereaer referred to as PC 43:6), to
the nano-DESI solvent. These standards have similar ionization
eﬃciency as endogenous LPC and PC, respectively,47 and the
m/z values of the standards do not overlap with m/z of endogenous lipids, as shown in Fig. S1 of the ESI.†
Matrix eﬀects in MSI
To investigate matrix eﬀects in MSI, we imaged brain tissue
sections from MCAO treated mice. The MCAO mouse model was
chosen because it enables investigation of matrix eﬀect originating both from chemical heterogeneity and from large variations in alkali cation concentration.27,37 The optical image of
one imaged tissue section is shown in Fig. 2A; in Fig. 2B the
ischemic region is marked pink and the white matter regions
are marked blue. Ion images of [M + Na]+ and [M + K]+ ions of
endogenous LPC 16:0, PC 34:1, PC 34:0, PC 38:6, PC 38:4 and
the standard PC 43:6 for this section, are shown in Fig. 2C. The
ion images are normalized to the total ion current (TIC) in the
le column and to the standard PC 25:0 in the right column.
Note that [M + Na]+ are normalized to [PC 25:0 + Na]+ and [M +
K]+ are normalized to [PC 25:0 + K]+. Since the standard and the
endogenous PC experience the same signal suppression eﬀects,
the ion images of [M + K]+ and [M + Na]+ normalized to the
corresponding standards are expected to be the same and
reect the actual distribution of the endogenous PC.
Two important observations transpire from the images
shown in Fig. 2C. First, ion images normalized to the TIC show

matrix eﬀects caused by changes in alkali cation concentration:
signals of endogenous PC cationized on sodium are enhanced
in the ischemic region while signals of endogenous PC cationized on potassium are suppressed. Similar eﬀects were
observed in MALDI MSI.17,19,21 In the absence of matrix eﬀects,
the standard (PC 43:6), which is supplied at a constant rate,
should show a uniform distribution over the tissue section.
However, Fig. 2C shows that, when normalized to TIC, the
signal of [PC 43:6 + Na]+ is enhanced and the signal of [PC 43:6 +
K]+ is suppressed in the ischemic region – similar to endogenous PC. When instead normalized to the standard PC 25:0, ion
images of the second PC 43:6 standard, show the expected
uniform distribution across the tissue section for both [PC 43:6
+ Na]+ and [PC 43:6 + K]+. Furthermore, when ion images of
endogenous PC are normalized to the standard they no longer
show a clear localization or anti-localization to the ischemic
site, regardless of cationization. Instead, remarkably similar
distributions are obtained for both alkali metal adducts of
endogenous PC species. This is also true for protonated PC
(Fig. S2B†) which has a similar distribution as PC cationized on
sodium when normalized to TIC. Due to the similarity in ionization eﬃciency between LPC and PC, normalization of LPC
16:0 to PC 25:0 gives the qualitative matrix free ion image shown
in Fig. 2. This is conrmed by the almost identical ion image of
LPC 16:0 normalized to LPC 13:0 shown in Fig. S2A† of the ESI
and the uniform distribution of LPC 13:0 standard normalized
to PC 25:0 standard as shown in Fig. S2D.† Of note, LPC 13:0
experiences higher ion suppression eﬀects on the tissue
compared to PC 25:0 resulting in the increased signal outside
the tissue observed in Fig. S2D.†,33 Nevertheless, similar signal
suppression of both LPC and PC on the tissue enables the use of
one PC standard in the nano-DESI solvent for obtaining matrixfree images of both lipid classes. The observed increase of LPC
16:0 in the ischemic region (Fig. 2C) is a biological consequence
of ischemia in which membrane degradation results in formation of free fatty acids and LPC from PC.20,23–27,48,49
Second, ion images of the standard normalized to TIC show
increased signal intensity in the white matter regions of the
tissue. This is due to matrix eﬀects caused by diﬀerences in the
molecular composition of the analyte mixture extracted from
the white and the gray matter regions. The white matter has a
high amount of glycolipids, which are abundant in myelinated
axons, while the gray matter has high amounts of phospholipids.50–52 The higher ionization eﬃciency of phospholipids
increases ion suppression eﬀects of molecules in the gray
matter, while the lower ionization eﬃciency of glycolipids
enhances the ion yield in the white matter. Although the analyte
signal in MSI may be aﬀected by diﬀerences in the extraction
eﬃciency of molecules from the tissue, our recent study indicates that in nano-DESI imaging the extraction eﬃciency of
endogenous PC is independent of the brain tissue region.33
Because both PC standards and endogenous PC molecules
experience similar suppression during ionization, normalization to the standard compensates for matrix eﬀects. Ion images
normalized to the standard reveal clear morphological structures including the dorsal 3rd and lateral ventricles and several
white matter regions. Furthermore, the endogenous PC 38:4

traces Fig. S3† shows non-normalized traces displaying very
similar results as the TIC-normalized data.

Conclusions
Matrix eﬀects in MSI may aﬀect the observed localization of
molecules in biological systems. In this study, we show that
doping the nano-DESI solvent with appropriate standards
enables identication of and compensation for matrix eﬀects in
nano-DESI MSI. Using MCAO mouse brain tissue as a model
system, we identify suppression of potassium adducts and
enhancement of sodium adducts of PC in the ischemic region of
the brain, and an overall enhancement of PC in white matter
regions. Compensation for matrix eﬀects is achieved by
normalizing ion signals of endogenous PC to the signal of the

corresponding adduct of the PC standard. The resulting ion
images show identical distributions of [PC + Na]+ and [PC + K]+
and enhancement of LPC ([M + Na]+ and [M + K]+) in the
ischemic region. The increase of LPC in the ischemic region is
in agreement with previously published data conrming eﬃcient compensation for matrix eﬀects in nano-DESI imaging of
biological tissues.
