Abstract
Ischemic stroke induces microglial activation and release of proinflammatory cytokines, contributing to the expansion
of brain injury and poor clinical outcome. Propofol has been shown to ameliorate neuronal injury in a number of
experimental studies, but the precise mechanisms involved in its neuroprotective effects remain unclear. We tested
the hypothesis that propofol confers neuroprotection against focal ischemia by inhibiting microglia-mediated
inflammatory response in a rat model of ischemic stroke. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Propofol (50 mg/kg/h) or vehicle was infused
intravenously at the onset of reperfusion for 30 minutes. In vehicle-treated rats, MCAO resulted in significant cerebral
infarction, higher neurological deficit scores and decreased time on the rotarod compared with sham-operated rats.
Propofol treatment reduced infarct volume and improved the neurological functions. In addition, molecular studies
demonstrated that mRNA expression of microglial marker Cd68 and Emr1 was significantly increased, and mRNA
and protein expressions of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 were
augmented in the peri-infarct cortical regions of vehicle-treated rats 24 h after MCAO. Immunohistochemical study
revealed that number of total microglia and proportion of activated microglia in the peri-infarct cortical regions were
markedly elevated. All of these findings were ameliorated in propofol-treated rats. Furthermore, vehicle-treated rats
had higher plasma levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein 24 h after MCAO, which were decreased after
treatment with propofol. These results suggest that propofol protects against focal cerebral ischemia via inhibition of
microglia-mediated proinflammatory cytokines. Propofol may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of
ischemic stroke and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with microglial activation.

Introduction

Microglia are major immune cells in the central nervous
system, which are activated rapidly in response to brain injury
[4] or during neurodegenerative processes and produce
proinflammatory cytokines, growth factors, reactive oxygen
species, nitric oxide, and glutamate [5,6]. Although activation of
microglia is necessary and crucial for host defense, the overactivation of microglia results in deleterious and neurotoxic
consequences. Experimental studies have shown that resident
microglia in the brain are activated within minutes of ischemia
onset and release multiple proinflammatory cytokines, such as
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and
interleukin-6 (IL-6), which play a crucial role in the progression

Stroke is the leading cause of death and the most frequent
cause of long-term disability in the adult population worldwide
[1]. Ischemic strokes are the most common type of stroke,
representing about 87% of all strokes [2]. Cerebral ischemia
induces acute inflammation by triggering excessive production
of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain as well as in
peripheral blood, which exacerbate brain damage and are
related to poor clinical outcome in patients with ischemic stroke
[3].

Propofol and Neuroprotection

Induction of MCAO

of neuronal loss and brain injury following ischemic stroke [7-9].
Thus, development of agents that reduce microglial activation
in the brain and inhibit the release of proinflammatory cytokines
is considered to be an important therapeutic strategy for
ischemic stroke.
Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) is an intravenous hypnotic
agent widely used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia
during surgeries. In addition, Propofol has antiinflammatory
properties, reducing production of proinflammatory cytokines,
altering expression of nitric oxide, and inhibiting neutrophil
function [10]. An in vitro study recently showed that propofol
almost
completely
inhibits
lipopolysaccharide-induced
activation of microglia and the production of proinflammatory
cytokines [11]. A number of experimental studies have reported
that propofol ameliorates neuronal injury in animal models of
ischemic stroke [12-14]. However, the precise mechanisms
involved in its neuroprotective effects remain unclear. In this
study, we tested the hypothesis that propofol attenuates
cerebral ischemic injury by inhibiting microglia-mediated
inflammatory response in a rat model of ischemic stroke.

Transient MCAO was induced by the intraluminal suture
method as previously described [16-18]. Briefly, rats were
anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of
pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg). Body core temperature was
maintained within a normothermic range (37°C to 38°C) with a
temperature-controlled heating pad. A 4/0 surgical nylon
monofilament with a silicone-beaded tip was introduced into the
right internal carotid artery through the external carotid artery to
occlude the origin of the middle cerebral artery. After 2 h of
occlusion, the monofilament was removed to allow reperfusion
for 24 h. In addition, the left femoral artery was cannulated for
monitoring blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) and for
arterial blood gas measurements. The left femoral vein was
cannulated for the administration of drugs. BP and HR were
continuously recorded on a computer using the PowerLab
software (PowerLab/8SP, Chart 5.0; ADInstruments Pty, Ltd.,
Castle Hill, Australia). Blood gas measurements were
performed 15 min after the onset of ischemia or reperfusion
using a blood gas analyzer (Compact 3, AVL Medizintechnik).

Methods

Assessment of neurological outcome
Eight rats from each group were used for assessment of
neurological outcome. Neurological deficit scores were
evaluated 24 h after ischemia using an eight-point scale as
described previously [17]. The score was 0 for no apparent
deficits; 1 for failure to extend left forepaw fully; 2 for decreased
grip of the left forelimb; 3 for spontaneous movement in all
directions, contralateral circling only if pulled by the tail; 4 for
circling or walking to the left; 5 for walking only if stimulated; 6
for unresponsiveness to stimulation and with depressed level of
consciousness; and 7 for death.
Measurement of motor coordination was performed 24 h
before and after ischemia, respectively. The experimental
procedure was described previously [19]. Briefly, the time that
the rats stayed on a rotating rod was recorded automatically in
each case for up to 3 minutes. The trial was conducted five
times for each rat, and the mean riding time was used as the
mean value for this test. When the time of riding was over 3
minutes, the rat was released from the rod, and the riding time
was recorded as 3 minutes.
At the end of the observation period, these rats were
euthanized with an overdose of anesthesia and brains were
quickly removed for assessment of infarct volume, as
previously described [20]. Briefly, brains were sectioned at 2mm intervals throughout the rostrocaudal axis of the striatum.
Slices were then staining with 2% 2,3,5 triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) for 15 min at 37°C. Slice images were
digitalized and infarct areas were analyzed using NIH Image
1.60. The Complete lack of staining with TTC was defined as
the infarct lesion. The infarct volume was expressed as a
percentage of the contralateral hemisphere.

Animals
Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300 g were
purchased from Beijing Laboratory Animal Research Center
(Beijing, China). Animals were housed and cared for in the
Animal Resource Center and allowed free access to food and
water. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Chongqing
Medical University and were performed in accordance with the
“Guiding Principles for Research Involving Animals and Human
Beings”.

Experimental protocol
The animals were randomly assigned to 3 groups (n=20 for
each group) as follows: (1) middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) group treated with propofol (MCAO+PRO). Rats were
subjected to MCAO for 2 h followed by 24 h of reperfusion and
infused intravenously with propofol (50 mg/kg/h) using syringe
pump at the onset of reperfusion for 30 minutes; (2) MCAO
group treated with vehicle (saline) (MCAO+VEH). Same as
group (1), but these rats were infused intravenously with saline
at the onset of reperfusion for 30 minutes; (3) sham-operated
group (SHAM). Rats were subjected to sham MCAO without
treatment. The dose for intravenous infusion of propofol was
derived from a previous study in which such dose of propofol
significantly reduced infarct size 24 h after MCAO in rats [13].
Based on a formula for dose translation from animal to human
[15], a dose of 50 mg/kg/h of propofol in rats is roughly
equivalent to a dose of 8.1 mg/kg/h in human, which is within
the infusion rates of propofol for clinical use in human. At the
end of the protocol (24 h after MCAO and reperfusion),
neurological deficit scores and motor coordination were
evaluated. Rats were then sacrificed, the blood samples were
collected for biochemical measurements and the brains were
removed for infarct volume assessment, molecular analysis or
immunohistochemical study.

Real-time PCR analysis
The mRNA expression of microglial markers (CD68 and
Emr1) and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6)
in the peri-infarct cortical tissue was measured with real-time
PCR. Rats (n=8 for each group) were euthanized 24 h after

antibody penetration. Subsequently, the sections were
incubated for 72 h with a mouse monoclonal primary antibody
directed against CD11b (clone OX-42) (1:100, Chemicon,
Temecula, USA) in 2% normal horse serum and 0.2% Triton
X-100 in phosphate buffered saline. This was followed by
incubations in a biotinylated antimouse secondary antibody
raised in horse (1:100, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, USA)
for 2 h. The sections were exposed to DAB reagent (Vector
Laboratories,
Burlingame,
CA),
counter-stained
with
hematoxylin, dehydrated in ethanol, cleared with xylene, and
coverslipped with mounting medium.
Morphological analysis and quantification of microglia were
performed with a light microscope as described [22]. Nonactivated microglia were distinguished by their small soma from
which there emanated extensive, highly branched, long, thin
processes, a morphology termed ramified. Activated microglia
were
defined
by
the
following
criteria:
stronger
immunohistochemical staining for the marker CD11b (clone
OX-42), the presence of a clearly enlarged soma and marked
changes in the appearance of the processes which were now
reduced in number, but considerably thicker and shorter giving
a stubby appearance. The number of activated and nonactivated microglia was counted in several 0.2 × 0.2 mm
squares and the average was calculated.

MCAO, and the brains were removed and cut into seven serial
2-mm-thick coronal sections. The peri-infarct cortical tissue
was dissected from the coronal brain sections for extraction of
total RNA and protein using an operating microscope as
described previously [21]. The total RNA was extracted using
TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc) and reverse
transcribed into cDNA. mRNA levels for CD68, Emr1, TNF-α,
IL-1β, IL-6 and GAPDH were measured with SYBR green realtime PCR. The sequences for primers used were summarized
in Table 1. Real-time PCR was performed using the ABI prism
7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems,
Carlsbad, CA). The values were normalized to GAPDH and
expressed as a fold change relative to the SHAM group.

Western blot analysis
The protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β
and IL-6 in the peri-infarct cortical tissue were measured by
Western blot. The peri-infarct cortical tissue was dissected from
the coronal brain sections and homogenized in lysis buffer. The
protein concentration in the supernatant was measured with
the BCA protein assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).
Equivalent amounts of protein were separated on 12% SDSpolyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA). The
membranes were blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk and then
incubated using primary antibody to TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and βactin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4°C
overnight. After three washing, the membranes were incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at
room temperature. The signal was visualized using the
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system
(Amersham) and the densities of the immunobands were
quantitated. All data were corrected and normalized to β-actin.

Biochemical assays
Blood samples were collected 24 h after MCAO for
measurements of plasma proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α,
IL-1β, IL-6 and C-reactive protein) by ELISA kits (Biosource
International Inc, Camarillo, CA or R&D Systems Inc,
Minneapolis, MN).

Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean±SEM. The significance of
differences in mean values was analyzed by one-way or twoway repeated-measure ANOVA followed by Fisher's post hoc
test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Immunohistochemistry
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, four rats from each group
were perfused transcardially with heparinized saline followed
by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline.
Brains were removed and fixed overnight in 4%
paraformaldehyde at 4°C and then immersed in 30% sucrose.
Brain tissue was sliced into 20-μm serial coronal sections using
a cryostat. Standard immunohistochemical procedures were
performed according to a previous study [22]. Briefly, the
sections were blocked by 0.5% H2O2 for 30 min and then
incubated in 10% normal horse serum for 60 min to facilitate

Results
Hemodynamic and physiological variables
To eliminate potential confounding factors on neurological
outcomes, hemodynamic and physiological variables, including
BP, HR and arterial blood gases, were monitored and

sham rats, but there were few microglia with an activated
morphology (Figure 3A). The average number of total microglia
(Figure 3B) and the proportion of activated microglia (Figure
3C) counted in the peri-infarct cortical tissue were significantly
increased in vehicle-treated rats 24 h after MCAO compared
with those in sham rats. In contrast, both the number of total
microglia and the proportion of activated microglia in the periinfarct cortical tissue were reduced in rats treated with propofol.

HR, arterial pH, carbon dioxide tension (Pco2) and arterial
oxygen tension (Po2) were observed at each time point before,
during MCAO and during reperfusion.

Propofol ameliorated MCAO-induced neuronal injury
A 2-h MCAO followed by 24 h reperfusion induced an infarct
volume of 23 ± 2% in vehicle-treated rats (Figure 1A and 1B).
In contrast, treatment with propofol after MCAO reduced infarct
volume significantly by approximately 35% (p < 0.05).
The time spent on rotarod among three groups was similar
before MCAO (average time on rotarod was 154 ± 17 sec).
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, vehicle-treated rats exhibited
markedly higher neurological deficit scores (Figure 1C) and
reduced time on rotarod (Figure 1D) than sham rats. Whereas
rats treated with propofol after MCAO demonstrated significant
decrease in neurological deficit scores and improvement in
rotarod performance compared with vehicle-treated rats.

Propofol attenuated MCAO-induced proinflammatory
cytokines
Multiple proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in
the regulation of inflammation. TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 are major
early response cytokines that trigger a cascade of inflammatory
mediators, including other cytokines, chemokines, reactive
nitrogen or oxygen intermediates [23]. In the brain, microglia
produce all 3 cytokines. C-reactive protein is an exquisitely
sensitive systemic marker of inflammation and tissue damage.
In the present study, the neuroprotective actions of propofol
administrated after MCAO could be due to its inhibitory effects
on microglia and subsequent production of proinflammatory
cytokines in the brain and periphery. To test this hypothesis,
we measured the levels of above proinflammatory cytokines in
the brain and plasma. The mRNA (Figure 4) and protein
(Figure 5) expressions of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α,
IL-1β and IL-6 were significantly augmented in the peri-infarct
cortical tissue of vehicle-treated rats compared with sham rats.
After treatment with propofol, mRNA and protein expressions of
IL-1β and IL-6 were significantly reduced, and mRNA and
protein expressions of TNF-α were normalized in the periinfarct cortical tissue of rats at 24 h following MCAO.
There were no differences in plasma levels of TNF-α and
IL-1β across the 3 experimental groups (Figure 6A and 6B).

Propofol inhibited MCAO-induced microglial activation
Real-time PCR showed that mRNA expression of Cd68 and
Emr1, two microglia specific markers, markedly increased by
178% and 290%, respectively, in the peri-infarct cortical tissue
in vehicle-treated rats 24 h after MCAO as compared to those
in sham rats (Figure 2). Compared with vehicle-treated rats,
propofol-treated rats had significantly decreased mRNA
expression of Cd68 and Emr1 in the peri-infarct cortical tissue
24 h after MCAO.
OX42 antibody is a specific microglial marker and stains all
microglia. Activated microglia were defined as cells that exhibit
strong OX-42 immunoreactivity, an enlarged soma, fewer and
shorter processes. Using immunohistochemical study, we
found that microglia were presented in the cortical tissue of

However, vehicle-treated rats had higher plasma levels of IL-6
and C-reactive protein, which were significantly reduced after
treatment with propofol (Figure 6C and 6D).

[12-14], but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the
present study, we found that a 2-h MCAO followed by 24 h
reperfusion elicited large brain infarct in the frontoparietal
cortex. Administration of propofol early after MCAO reduced
infarct volume, improved neurological outcome as evidenced
by decrease neurological deficit scores and increased time in
rotarod performance. These results are consistent with
previous studies, suggesting a protective effect of propofol on
ischemic brain injury. More importantly, our data extend
previous findings by revealing that the beneficial effects of
propofol on ischemic brain injury are associated with
suppression of microglial activation and proliferation in the periinfarct
cortical
areas
and
reduction
in
releasing
proinflammatory cytokines.
The inflammatory responses in the brain to ischemic stroke
are characterized by a rapid activation and proliferation of
microglial cells, followed by the infiltration of circulating
inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, T cells, monocyte/
macrophages, and other cells in the ischemic brain region, as
demonstrated in animal models and in stroke patients
[4,30,31]. The microglia are activated within minutes after onset
of focal cerebral ischemia and may last for several weeks after
initial injury [4]. Activated microglia produce a plethora of
proinflammatory mediators in the brain, including TNF-α, IL-1β
and IL-6, which contribute to the expansion of brain injury and
the delayed loss of neurons [3,7-9,32]. It has been shown that
intraventricular injection of IL-1 and TNF-α increases infarct
volume and brain edema after MCAO in rats, whereas the
injection of microglial inhibitor minocycline [33,34] or PPAR-γ
agonist pioglitazone that suppresses microglial activation and
expression of proinflammatory cytokines [35], or administration
of antibodies against IL-1 and TNF-α [8,36] reduces brain
injury. The data of present study showed that, at 24 h after

Discussion
The novel finding of this study is that treatment with propofol
early after ischemic stroke suppressed microglia activation and
proliferation in the peri-infarct cortical regions, reduced the
production of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain as well as
in peripheral blood, and improved neurological outcome. To our
knowledge, this is the first study in vivo to demonstrate that the
propofol confers neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury
by modulating microglial function. Our finding provides new
understanding of the protective mechanisms of anesthetic
propofol, which may be applicable in the immediate aftermath
of stroke as well as to patients with a stroke history undergoing
surgery, patients in the intensive care unit under sedation, and
patients undergoing neurosurgery.
Propofol has become the most widely used anesthetics in
neurosurgery. More recently, the anti-inflammatory functions of
propofol have been received much attention because this
agent has been shown to exert protective effects during acute
inflammatory in neurologic and cardiovascular diseases
[10,24]. For example, experimental studies in animals showed
that propofol inhibits cytokine release during sepsis [25,26] and
decreased neutrophil-mediated inflammation in acute
pulmonary injury [27]. Clinical studies revealed that propofol
attenuates myocardial reperfusion injury and pulmonary
dysfunction following cardiopulmonary bypass by reducing free
radical release and modulating the inflammatory process
[28,29]. In addition, a number of studies have reported that
propofol protects against ischemic brain injury in animal models

MCAO, mRNA expression of microglial markers Cd68 and
Emr1 in the peri-infarct cortical tissue was augmented, and the
number of total microglia and the proportion of activated

results in microglial activation and proliferation in this brain

TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in this brain area was also increased.
These results are consistent with previous findings showing
that cerebral ischemia substantially activates microglia and

cytokines is mostly co-localized with activated microglia
[21,37], indicating that activated microglial cells are the main
source of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain after ischemic
stroke. Furthermore, we found that early treatment with
propofol reduced mRNA expression of Cd68 and Emr1,
decreased the number of total microglia and the proportion of
activated microglia in the peri-infarct cortical tissue,
accompanied by decreased mRNA and protein expressions of
proinflammatory cytokines 24 h after MCAO. These findings
provided evidence for suppressive effects of propofol on
microglial activation and release of proinflammatory cytokines

supported by recent in vitro studies showing that propofol
dramatically reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-1β and IL-6, and activation of microglia induced by
lipopolysaccharide [11,38] or extracellular pressure [39]. Taken
together, these observations demonstrate that the beneficial
effects of propofol on infarct volume and neurological outcome

important, as they may be valuable tools in the search for an
optimal management of stroke patients. It is notable that
cerebral ischemia did not change the levels of plasma
proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β, but significantly
increased the levels of plasma IL-6 and C-reactive protein,
which were attenuated by propofol treatment. Inflammation in
the brain is known to modulate inflammation in the periphery in
ischemic stroke, and measurement of peripheral inflammatory
response has been suggested to be a far more practical
approach in clinical research [40]. Elevations of
proinflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein in plasma

after ischemic stroke have been reported in both clinical and
experimental studies [3,41-43]. The acute-phase response,
characterized by elevated plasma concentrations of IL-6, Creactive protein and neutrophil leukocytosis, is induced within
hours of ischemic stroke [42]. Parameters of the acute-phase
response, particularly plasma IL-6 and C-reactive protein
concentrations, are positively associated with stroke severity
and infarct volume, and predict a higher risk of early clinical
worsening [3,40].Thus, reductions in plasma proinflammatory
cytokines IL-6 and C-reactive protein after treatment with
propofol in our study are likely to reflect decreased risk of early
clinical deterioration.
Two major limitation of the present study should be
acknowledged. First, it has been reported that cerebral

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

ischemia also induces activation of astrocytes, another resident
cells in the brain, which can produce the proinflammatory
cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. Intervention to
inhibit astrocyte activation has been shown to enhance
neuronal survival and improve outcome following cerebral
ischemia [44,45]. However, the present study focused only on
the role of microglia activation in ischemic brain injury, further
studies are needed to determine whether neuroprotective
effects of propofol observed in this study are partially due to
inhibition of astrocyte activation. Second, although propofol
treatment suppressed microglia activation and reduced the
production of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain as well as
in peripheral blood, accompanied by decreased infarct size and
improved neurological outcome, but the finding of decreases in

these inflammatory markers does not prove that these cause
the decrease in infarct size. Other important mediators
associated with ischemic neuronal injury might also be reduced
by propofol and contributed to the decrease in infarct size.
Further research is necessary to determine whether there is a

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

direct relationship between the levels of these proinflammatory
cytokines and infarct size after ischemic stroke.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that
administration of propofol early after cerebral ischemia reduces
infarct volume and improves neurological function by inhibition
