Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a well-known antipsychotic drug, still widely being used to treat symptoms of
schizophrenia, psychotic depression and organic psychoses. We have previously reported that CPZ
activates the BKCa (KCa1.1) channel at whole cell level. In the present study, we demonstrated that CPZ
increased the single channel open probability of the BKCa channels without changing its single channel
amplitude. As BKCa channel is one of the molecular targets of brain ischemia, we explored a possible new
use of this old drug on ischemic brain injury. In middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) focal cerebral
ischemia, a single intraperitoneal injection of CPZ at several dosages (5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg)
could exert a signiﬁcant neuroprotective effect on the brain damage in a dose- and time-dependent
manner. Furthermore, blockade of BKCa channels abolished the neuroprotective effect of CPZ on MCAO,
suggesting that the effect of CPZ is mediated by activation of the BKCa channel. These results demonstrate
that CPZ could reduce focal cerebral ischemic damage through activating BKCa channels and merits
exploration as a potential therapeutic agent for treating ischemic stroke.

1. Introduction
Drugs rarely act speciﬁcally to a single target in a disease
process and elicit a cure with few side effects. Indeed, recent
analyses of drug and drug-target networks show a rich pattern of
interactions among drugs and their targets, where drugs acting on
a single target are the exception. Side-effects are the unintended
consequence of therapeutic treatments, but they can also provide
valuable information for repositioning old drugs to bring new
therapies (Duran-Frigola and Aloy, 2012; Yang and Agarwal, 2011).
The main advantage of drug-repositioning strategies is that, since
it starts from approved compounds with well-characterized pharmacology and safety proﬁles, it should drastically reduce the risk
of attrition in clinical phases (Duran-Frigola and Aloy, 2012).
Several drugs have been successfully repositioned to new indications. For example, sibutramine and milnacipran were initially
developed for depression but now they are used for treating
obesity and ﬁbromyalgia syndrome, respectively (Novac, 2013).

Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a neuroleptic antipsychotic agent with
a long history of clinical use (Shen, 1999; McNaughton et al., 2001;
Carpenter and Koenig, 2008). Its therapeutic effect is commonly
attributed to its ability to potently inhibit dopamine D2 receptors
(Carpenter and Koenig, 2008). However, the psychiatric beneﬁt
of CPZ is accompanied by numerous side effects, such as
antiserotonergic activity (Croll et al., 1997) and post-synaptic α1
adrenoceptor-blockade (Nedergaard and Abrahamsen, 1988).
Besides, CPZ has been reported to interfere with a number of
receptors and ion channels, such as Ca2 þ channels (McNaughton
et al., 2001), K þ channels (Ogata and Tatebayashi, 1993; Nakazawa
et al., 1995), nicotinic receptor channels (Benoit and Changeux,
1993), and Cl- channels (Quamme, 1997).
Previously, we have shown that CPZ activates the largeconductance, Ca2 þ -activated potassium (BKCa, KCa1.1) channel at
the whole cell level (Qi et al., 2005). In the present work, we
showed that CPZ increased the single channel open probability of
the BKCa channels without change in its single channel amplitude.
Activation of BKCa channels has been shown to have neuroprotective effect on brain ischemia (Gribkoff et al., 2001; Chi et al., 2010),
because BKCa channel activation would act to limit Ca2 þ entry,
reduce excessive release of excitatory neurotransmitter and energy
expenditure. Therefore, trying to reposition this old drug for new

use, we explored the possibility of using CPZ for treating focal
cerebral ischemia.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Electrophysiology
The single channel current recordings were performed in the
inside–out conﬁguration at room temperature. Currents were ampliﬁed using EPC-10 patch-clamp ampliﬁer (HEKA), sampled at 2–5 kHz
and ﬁltered at 1.5–2.9 kHz via a 4-pole low-pass Bessel ﬁlter. A
program package Patchmaster 2.1 and TAC 4.1 (HEKA, Germany) were
used for data acquisition and analysis. Pipettes had resistances in a
range of 2–5 MΩ in the recording solution. Patch electrode and bath
solutions were the same (in mM): 140 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES
(pH 7.3), 320–335 mOsm, CaCl2 adjusted to free Ca2þ of 1 mM on the
basis of calculations using a free software CALCON3. All experiments
were performed at room temperature (20–25 1C). The value of the
single channel open probability (Po) in a patch with multiple channels
was calculated by using TAC 4.1 (HEKA, Germany), based on the
equation: Po¼(1 Pc1/N), where Pc is the probability when all of the
channels are in the closed state and N is the number of channels in
the patch.
2.2. Focal ischemia
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 200–250 g, Xiamen University Animal Experiment Center) were used throughout the
study. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced by
using intraluminal ﬁlament insertion technique as previously
described (Chi et al., 2010). Brieﬂy, the ﬁlament thread (4/0 gauge
with the tip heat blunted to a diameter of 0.104 mm) was inserted
through the left common carotid artery and advanced into the
internal carotid artery to occlude the origin of the middle cerebral
artery (approximately 18–20 mm). Body temperatures were monitored and controlled at 377 0.5 1C with a homeothermic blanket.
To keep the condition as same as possible, only the rats with
postoperative neurological score of 2 (circling to the right), a
moderate focal neurologic deﬁcit, were selected according to the
Longa 5-point scale scoring system (Longa et al., 1989). The shamoperated animals were treated identically, except that the middle
cerebral artery was not occluded after the neck incision. Animals
were given unrestricted access to food and water. Animals were
killed 24 h post-MCAO. Brains were rapidly removed. Brain slices
were prepared by sectioning the brain coronally at 2 mm intervals,
and stained by immersion in vital dye (2%) 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium hydrochloride (TTC). The slices were photographed, and
analyzed with Image-J software (NIH freeware) and presented
with Photoshop software (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, California,
USA). Unstained areas were deﬁned as ischemic lesions. An edema
index was calculated by dividing the total volume of the hemisphere ipsilateral to MCAO by the total volume of the contralateral
hemisphere. The actual infarct volume adjusted for edema was
calculated by dividing the infarct volume by the edema index.
Relative infarct volume is given as infarcted volume as the
percentage of the total brain volume (Reglodi et al., 2000). All
manipulations and analyses were performed by individuals
blinded to all groups. Animal care and experiments were performed in accordance with procedures approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee of Xiamen University.
2.3. Drug administration
CPZ diluted in 0.9% saline was administered intraperitoneally
(i.p.) at a concentration of 0.5, 1, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg. Saline (0.9%)

39

with 2% DMSO was used as a vehicle. Paxilline (Pax), a hydrophobic blocker of BKCa channels, was dissolved in DMSO and
applied by i.p. injection. Charybdotoxin (CTX), a hydrophilic
blocker of BKCa channels, was dissolved in 0.9% saline and injected
into the intracerebroventricle (i.c.v.). I.c.v. injection was performed
by stereotaxic technique using a tepper-motorized micro-syringe
with cannula inserted stereotactically at 0.8 mm posterior to
bregma, 1.5 mm lateral to midline, and 3.8 mm ventral to the dura.
Corresponding solutions were injected at a rate of 1 μl/min (ﬁnal
volume ¼ 5 ml/rat). Rats in the control group were given an equal
volume of the vehicle.
2.4. Statistical analysis
All the data are expressed as mean 7S.E.M. (standard error of
mean). Experimental results were compared among groups by
ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test. Differences at
Po 0.05 were considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.

3. Results
3.1. Effect of CPZ on BKCa channel at the single channel level
We have reported that CPZ could increase the whole cell
current of the BKCa channel in a dose-dependent manner (Qi
et al., 2005). However, it is not known whether cytosolic factors
are involved in the channel activation, whether the increased
current is due to increase in single channel open probability or
single channel amplitude. To address these questions, we turned
to the inside–out patch-clamp conﬁguration. In the inside–out
patch conﬁguration, the single channel current traces at different
membrane potentials with or without 20 μM CPZ showed that CPZ
increased the Po of the channel at every corresponding membrane
potential (Fig. 1A and B). Fig. 1C shows the statistical data on the
Po of the channel in the control condition and in the presence of
20 μM CPZ. In the control condition, Po was 3.6 71.3%, while it
increased to 13.7 70.7% in the presence of 20 μM CPZ. The
current–voltage relationship of the single BKCa channel indicated
that CPZ increased the single channel open probabilities without
changing the single channel amplitude (Fig. 1D), suggesting that
the increase in the whole cell current by CPZ was due to increase
in the single channel open probabilities but not its single channel
conductance. As the excised membrane patch is not affected by the
cytosolic factors, the result also indicated that cytosolic factors are
not involved in increasing the single channel open probabilities
by CPZ.
3.2. Effect of CPZ on brain infarct size after MCAO
To determine the effect of CPZ against focal cerebral ischemia
induced injury, we tested the protective effect of CPZ on MCAO
rats. The brain slices were stained with TTC, which stains healthy
tissue red and leaves infarct tissue pale white. At 24 h post-MCAO,
the percentage of infarct size was 23.8 71.4% in the vehicle
injected MCAO rat (n ¼23). A single injection of CPZ, at dosages
of 0.5, 1.0, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg immediately following MCAO, dosedependently reduced the percentage of the infarct size to
20.1 71.2% (n ¼6), 19.4 71.8% (n ¼11), 14.8 72.6% (n ¼5),
13.9 7 1.3% (n ¼9) and 17.1 72.5% (n ¼5), respectively (Fig. 2),
indicating that CPZ could reduce the cerebral infarct induced by
MCAO. The same level of dosage has been shown to be effective in
neuronal apoptosis induced by ethanol (Wu et al., 2011). As CPZ at
a dosage of 10 mg/kg gave the best protective effect on ischemic
damage, this dosage is used in the following study. Furthermore,

experiments.

we found that CPZ has an effect even when injected 1 h postMCAO (Fig. 3).
3.3. Blockade of BKCa channels abolishes the neuroprotective effect of
CPZ on MCAO
If BKCa channel is the molecular target, then its speciﬁc blockers
should suppress the neuroprotective effect of CPZ. To determine
whether the neuroprotection of CPZ is associated with the BKCa
channel activation, CTX (400 nM), a water soluble speciﬁc BKCa
channel blocker, was given by i.c.v. injection 30 min post-MCAO
accompanied by i.p. injection of CPZ (10 mg/kg) at 1 h post-MCAO.
In the vehicle-treated group, the percentage of the infarct size was
27.6 þ2.7% at 24 h post-MCAO (n ¼7). In the CPZ-treated group, the

percentage of the infarct size was 17.6þ1.6% (n¼ 8). In contrast, the
percentage of the infarct size was 25.2þ2.4% (n¼11) for the CPZtreated group with i.c.v. injection of CTX (400 nM) (Fig. 4). Therefore,
the blockade of BKCa channel by CTX signiﬁcantly suppressed the
neuroprotective effect of CPZ.
To further conﬁrm whether BKCa channels are involved, we
selected a hydrophobic blocker Paxilline (Pax). In the vehicletreated group, the percentage of the infarct size was 25.6 þ3.6% at
24 h post-MCAO (n ¼6). In the CPZ-treated group, the percentage
of the infarct size was 15.6 þ1.7% (n ¼7). In contrast, the percentage of the infarct size was 22.2 þ1.7% (n ¼11) for the CPZ-treated
group with i.p. injection of Pax (2.2 mg/kg) (Fig. 5), indicating that
Pax could suppress the effect of CPZ. These two blockers have very
different properties and different mechanisms of action: One is
hydrophobic, another is hydrophilic; one was applied by i.c.v.
injection, the other was applied by i.p. injection. However, both
blockers could abolish the effect of CPZ, which strongly suggests
that CPZ protects ischemia-induced brain injury via activation of
BKCa channels and gives further evidence that the BKCa channel is
the molecular target of CPZ.

4. Discussion
CPZ is a widely used antipsychotic drug. It is highly lipophilic
and would pass readily through lipid bilayers and the blood brain
barrier. Even though the steady state plasma levels of CPZ are in
the range of 10–230 ng/ml when patient received 200 mg bid
(Cooper, 1978), the concentration of CPZ in the brain might be
much higher because CPZ has been shown to be highly bound to
plasma proteins (Curry, 1970). It has been reported that brain
uptakes 6.04 71.6% of the injected CPZ 15 min after the injection,
and the concentration remains constant for 45 min (Comar et al.,
1979). The brain to body weight ratio for adult rats is approximately 2%. Therefore, CPZ is substantially concentrated within the
brain (Tsuneizumi et al., 1992). In schizophrenic patients, the
average serum levels of CPZ in the plasma are in the range
of 3.5–21.5 μg/ml (Huang and Ruskin, 1964), which is roughly
1–60 μM. In our study, we demonstrated that a single i.p. injection
of CPZ at dosages of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, which is several tens of
micromole concentration, could exert signiﬁcant neuroprotective
effect on the brain damage. This is in the concentration range that
could activate the BKCa channels. These results suggest that CPZ is
capable of activating BKCa channels at therapeutic concentrations
and in so doing plays a neuroprotective role in brain ischemia. In
consistence with our result, CPZ has been shown to be able to
exert neuroprotective effect on spinal cord ischemia (Sader et al.,
2002), glutamate-induced neurotoxicity (Stone and Pilowsky,
2007), neuronal apoptosis induced by ethanol (Wu et al., 2011)
and primary hippocampal neuronal cell death induced by growth
medium deprivation (Bastianetto et al., 2006). Based on our results, we
infer that patients that frequently take CPZ would have lower
possibility of getting ischemic brain injury. An epidemiological

investigation on ischemia occurrence in patients will help to address
this issue.
