G-protein coupled receptor 3 (GPR3), GPR6, and GPR12 belong to a family of constitutively active Gs-coupled receptors that activate 3′-5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and are highly expressed in the brain. Among
these receptors, the endogenous expression of GPR3 in cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) is increased following
development. GPR3 is important for neurite outgrowth and neural maturation; however, the physiological functions of GPR3 remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the survival and antiapoptotic functions of
GPR3 under normal and apoptosis-inducing culture conditions. Under normal culture conditions, CGNs from
GPR3-knockout mice demonstrated lower survival than did CGNs from wild-type or GPR3-heterozygous mice.
Cerebellar sections from GPR3−/− mice at P7, P14, and P21 revealed more caspase-3-positive neurons in the
internal granular layer than in cerebellar sections from wild-type mice. Conversely, in a potassium-deprivation
model of apoptosis, increased expression of these three receptors promoted neuronal survival. The antiapoptotic
effect of GPR3 was also observed under hypoxic (1% O2/5% CO2) and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced
apoptotic conditions. We further investigated the signaling pathways involved in the GPR3-mediated
antiapoptotic effect. The addition of the PKA inhibitor KT5720, the MAP kinase inhibitor U0126, and the PI3 kinase
inhibitor LY294002 abrogated the GPR3-mediated antiapoptotic effect in a potassium-deprivation model of
apoptosis, whereas the PKC inhibitor Gö6976 did not affect the antiapoptotic function of GPR3. Furthermore,
downregulation of endogenous GPR3 expression in CGNs resulted in a marked reduction in the basal levels of
ERK and Akt phosphorylation under normal culture conditions. Finally, we used a transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion (tMCAO) model in wild-type and GPR3-knockout mice to determine whether GPR3 expression
modulates neuronal survival after brain ischemia. After tMCAO, GPR3-knockout mice exhibited a signiﬁcantly
larger infarct area than did wild-type mice. Collectively, these in vitro and in vivo results suggest that the developmental expression of constitutively active Gs-coupled GPR3 activates the ERK and Akt signaling pathways at the
basal level, thereby protecting neurons from apoptosis that is induced by various stimuli.

G-protein coupled receptor 3 (GPR3), GPR6, and GPR12 belong to a
family of constitutively active Gs-coupled receptors that are highly
expressed in the brain compared to other organs (Eggerickx et al.,
1995; Saeki et al., 1993; Tanaka et al., 2007; Uhlenbrock et al., 2002).
A unique feature of these receptors is their constitutive activation of
adenylate cyclase, which results in increased basal levels of intracellular
cAMP (Song et al., 1994). In neurons, cAMP plays an important role in
diverse functions, such as survival and differentiation, axon guidance,
neurite outgrowth and axonal regeneration. We have previously

216

demonstrated that neuronal expression of these receptors enhances
neurite outgrowth (Tanaka et al., 2007) and that GPR3 expression modulates the proliferation of cerebellar granule cell precursors (Tanaka
et al., 2009). Recently, it has also been reported that neuronal expression of GPR3 plays a role in amyloid-beta generation (Thathiah et al.,
2009, 2013), emotional-like responses (Valverde et al., 2009), neuropathic pain (Ruiz-Medina et al., 2011), and the early phases of cocaine
reinforcement (Tourino et al., 2012). However, the physiological functions of these receptors in neuronal survival have not been fully
elucidated.
Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death, which is observed in
the developing neuron. During the development of the cerebellum,
cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) receive afferent input from mossy ﬁbers and extend axons to form synapses with the dendrites of Purkinje
neurons. Apoptosis of CGNs has been suggested to contribute to this
mechanism, which enables accurate connections between CGNs and
Purkinje cells (Herrup and Sunter, 1987). In addition to neurotrophic
factors, increase in the intracellular cAMP level counteracts neuronal
apoptosis and promotes the survival of cerebellar granule neurons
(D'Mello et al., 1993). Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide
(PACAP) is a member of the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)
family of peptides and increases intracellular cAMP via the Gs-coupled
receptor PAC1 (Harmar et al., 1998). PACAP and PAC1 are expressed
in the developing cerebellum (Basille et al., 1993) and participate in
the survival of CGNs (Falluel-Morel et al., 2007, 2008; Gonzalez et al.,
1997). GPR3 is also expressed in CGNs during cerebellar development
and stimulates neuronal differentiation (Tanaka et al., 2009). However,
a potential role for GPR3 in promoting neuronal survival in the developing cerebellum has so far not been established.
Apoptotic neuronal death has also been implicated in acute neurological injuries (e.g., ischemic stroke and hypoxic brain injury) and
chronic neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease)
(Friedlander, 2003). After focal brain ischemia, the rapid depletion of
oxygen and glucose in brain tissue leads to necrosis at the infarct core,
while increased caspase expression is observed in the penumbral area,
which surrounds the ischemic core. The inhibition of caspase-3 results
in a reduction in the infarct volume after focal or global ischemia, suggesting that apoptosis occurs in the ischemic penumbra (Hara et al.,
1997; Namura et al., 1998). Similarly, caspase-3-mediated neuronal
damage has been observed after neonatal hypoxia–ischemia, which is
a common form of perinatal brain damage (Hu et al., 2000; Rossiter
et al., 2002). Furthermore, ischemia/reperfusion brain injury causes an
overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby accelerating
neuronal damage via apoptosis (Chan, 2001; Niizuma et al., 2010).
Thus, the inhibition of apoptotic neuronal death induced by hypoxia
and ROS is considered a potential therapeutic strategy for acute ischemic disorders.
Several growth factors (Guegan et al., 1999; Kooijman et al., 2009;
Miyazaki et al., 1999; Nicole et al., 2001) and hypoxia-related hormones
(Ruscher et al., 2002; Schabitz et al., 2008; Schneider et al., 2005; Siren
et al., 2001) have been implicated in counteracting such hypoxic and
ROS-induced neuronal injuries. In addition to these factors, the activation of the cAMP pathway has been shown to induce antiapoptotic functions in CGNs (D'Mello et al., 1993; Yan et al., 1995). Furthermore, in a
rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, the administration
of PACAP protects neurons from brain ischemia via multiple signaling
pathways that are dependent on cAMP and PI3 kinase. Moreover, the
upregulation of cAMP also increases the phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB),
thereby inducing survival-related gene expression (Lonze et al., 2002;
Riccio et al., 1999). However, it is not known whether constitutively
active Gs-coupled GPCRs maintain neuronal homeostasis and survival
in the presence of apoptosis-inducing stimuli in vitro or in vivo.
In the present study, we hypothesized that a constitutively active
Gs-coupled receptor, GPR3, and its signaling play an important role in

the survival of neurons exposed to apoptotic stimuli. We utilized a variety of in vitro and in vivo models of apoptosis and demonstrated that
GPR3 exerts a signiﬁcant neuroprotective effect on neurons. Furthermore, we investigated the signaling pathways that modulate GPR3mediated neuronal survival. Our results demonstrate the involvement
of GPR3 in the basal phosphorylation of ERK and Akt in the neuronal
survival pathways. The neural expression of GPR3 may be a unique
intrinsic target for neuroprotective strategies in acute and chronic
neurological disorders.
Materials and methods
Generation of GPR3-knockout mice
All animal experiments and procedures were approved and conducted in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committee of Hiroshima University (JAPAN) and The Ohio State University (USA). C57BL/6
mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA),
and Wistar rats were obtained from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis,
IN). Cryopreserved embryos of GPR3-knockout mice were obtained
from MMRRC (Bar Harbor, ME) and resuscitated at the Institute of
Laboratory Animal Science, Hiroshima University under the license of
Deltagen (San Mateo, CA).
Chemicals, proteins, siRNAs, and vectors
The protein kinase inhibitors KT5720, Rp-cAMP, U0126, LY294002,
and Gö6976 as well as forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP)
were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). All other chemicals
were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO), unless indicated otherwise.
The G Silencer siRNA against rat GPR3 (5′-CCUACUACUGAGAGAC
AACtt-3′/5′-GUUGUGUCUGAGUAGUAGGtg-3′) and the negative control #1 siRNA were purchased from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). The engineering of the GPR3, GPR6, and GPR12 expression vectors (pHGC-GPR3,
pHGC-GPR6, and pHGC-GPR12) has been previously described (Tanaka
et al., 2007). The expression of GPR3, GPR6, and GPR12 is transcriptionally controlled by a CMV promoter. The vectors also encode GFP, under
the control of an IE4/5 promoter, to allow the visualization of transfected
neurons using ﬂuorescent microscopy. To generate the GPR3 D133A
mutant, the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent,
Cedar Creek, TX) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Residues 220–222 of the DRY motif of mouse GPR3 were mutated to AAY
using the primers 5′-gctggccattaccgttgaccgctacctttccctgtaca-3′ and 5′tgtacagggaaaggtagcggtcaacggtaatggccagc-3′.
Isolation of cerebellar granule neurons and DNA electroporation
Cerebellar granule neurons were isolated from Wistar rats or C57BL/6
mice according to established procedures (Hatten, 1985) with modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, pups were sacriﬁced at postnatal day 7 (P7), and
the entire cerebellum was removed. The meninges were carefully
stripped off, and the cerebellum was subsequently washed in
calcium- and magnesium-free PBS and dissociated into single cells
using the Worthington Papain Dissociation System (Worthington
Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ). Dissociated cerebellar
cells were immediately separated by a two-step gradient (35%/60%
Percoll in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich). After centrifugation at 2000 ×g for
10 min at 4 °C, a fraction enriched with granule neurons was collected
from between the 35% and 60% Percoll layers. Isolated neurons were
washed once with PBS and suspended in DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and plated onto 24-well culture plates (BD
Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ) coated with 100 μg/mL of poly-D-lysine and
2 μg/mL of laminin (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) or onto glassbottomed dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) coated with 0.03%
polyethyleneimine at a concentration of 5 × 105/cm2. Using this protocol,
95–99% of the cultured cells were neurons (Hatten, 1985).

S. Tanaka et al. / Neurobiology of Disease 68 (2014) 215–227

For the DNA electroporation into CGNs, we utilized the Amaxa™
Nucleofector™ system (Lonza, Cologne, Germany). Brieﬂy, 5 × 106
dissociated neurons were centrifuged at 138 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 100 μL of Rat Neuron Nucleofector™ solution that was stored
at room temperature, combined with 3 μg of plasmid DNA, and then
transferred into a cuvette and electroporated using program G-13 of
the Lonza system. For the RNA interference experiments, the neurons
were co-electroporated with 1.5 μg of siRNA and 2 μg of a GFP expression plasmid. The transfected neurons were immediately resuspended
in 600 μL of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
plated onto either 24-well culture plates (BD Falcon) or chamber glass
slides (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) coated with 100 μg/mL
of poly-D-lysine (PDL; Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 μg/mL of laminin (BD Biosciences). Four to six hours after electroporation, the culture medium
was replaced with Neurobasal A medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
with 200 μM L-glutamine and 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Pharmacological agents, such as protein kinase inhibitors and
cAMP analogs, were added 24 h after plating the neurons and incubated
for 24 h.
Cell viability assay
Cell viability was evaluated using the WST-1 assay reagent (Roche
Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Rat cerebellar neurons from P7 neonates were isolated and transfected with GPR expression vectors using
the Amaxa™ Nucleofector™ system as previously described. After electroporation, the cells were plated onto PDL-coated 96-well plates (BD)
at a density of 5 × 105/cm2. Six hours after plating, the medium was
changed to Neurobasal A medium supplemented with 26 mM KCl,
200 μM L-glutamine, and 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Twenty-four hours after electroporation, apoptosis was induced
by reducing the extracellular potassium concentration from 26 to
5 mM. The control cultures were treated identically but were maintained in the identical hyperkalemic medium. As a positive control,
forskolin or dbcAMP was included in the medium. Forty-eight hours
after electroporation, the viability of the neurons was assessed using
the WST-1 assay (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Brieﬂy, the WST-1 reagent was added to the medium and incubated
for 4 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The colorimetric signal of each
sample was detected and analyzed using a FLUOstar OPTIMA microplate
reader (BMG LABTECH Inc., Durham, NC).

the cells were returned to normocarbia and normoxia conditions. For
the paraquat challenge, different concentrations of paraquat were administered to GPR3- or mock-expressing neurons 8 h after transfection.
Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were ﬁxed, and the
apoptotic neurons were detected as previously described.
Focal ischemia model
The surgical procedures were performed on mice as previously
described (Namura et al., 1998) but with modiﬁcations. The mice
were anesthetized with 1.0% isoﬂurane in a 2:1 ratio of N2O/O2 with a
vaporizer using an open face mask. Regional cerebral blood ﬂow was
monitored using laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (FLO-C1; OMEGAWAVE,
Tokyo, Japan) throughout the entire procedure. A probe for the ﬂowmeter was attached to the left skull (2 mm posterior and 5 mm lateral to
the bregma). The rectal temperature was also monitored and maintained at 37 °C using a heating pad and a heating lamp. The left middle
cerebral artery was occluded using an 8-0 nylon monoﬁlament suture
(Ethilon; Somerville, NJ) coated with silicone resin (DENTSPLY, Tokyo,
Japan). The diameter of the coated portion was measured using a
micrometer (Mitutoyo, Kawasaki, Japan). A microaneurysm clip was
temporally placed onto the left common carotid artery, and the coated
ﬁlament was introduced into the internal carotid artery until the tip occluded the middle cerebral artery blood ﬂow, as monitored by a laser
ﬂowmeter. Sixty minutes after occlusion, the ﬁlament was withdrawn,
and the middle cerebral artery was reperfused. Animals were maintained at 34 °C for at least 4 h. The infarct volume was analyzed 48 h
after ischemia. Brieﬂy, the animal was euthanized and the brain was
then removed. The brain was placed on a brain slicer (Muromachi
Kikai, Tokyo, Japan) and coronally sliced into 2-mm sections. The
brain was then stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) at 37 °C for 15 min and was post-ﬁxed using 10% paraformaldehyde. The infarct area was traced using ImageJ software, and the infarct
size was assayed relative to the entire area of the section.
Statistical analysis
The data are expressed as the means ± SEM. The statistical analyses
were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher's PLSD
test unless otherwise indicated. A value of p b 0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant.

Detection of apoptosis-positive neurons

Results

Apoptotic cells were detected using the In Situ Cell Death Detection
Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Brieﬂy, rat CGNs from P7 neonates were isolated and transfected with
GPR expression vectors using the Amaxa electroporation system.
After electroporation, the cells were plated onto a PDL-coated, glassbottomed dish (MatTek, Ashland, MA) at a density of 5 × 105/cm2. Six
hours after plating, the medium was changed to Neurobasal A medium
supplemented with 26 mM KCl, 200 μM L-glutamine, and 2% B27
supplement (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after electroporation, apoptosis was induced by reducing the potassium concentration, as previously described. The control cultures were identically treated but were
maintained in the high-potassium medium. Forty-eight hours after
electroporation, the cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde–PBS
for 60 min at room temperature. Then cells were then rinsed in 0.1%
Triton–PBS for 2 min on ice and incubated with the TMR Red TUNEL
reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere in
the dark. Some neurons were counterstained with Hoechst 33342
(Invitrogen). Fluorescent-positive neurons were imaged using a Zeiss
LSM510 META confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.,
Thornwood, NY). For the hypoxic challenge, 24 h after transfection,
GPR3- or mock-expressing neurons were incubated in a hypoxic chamber (1% O2, 5% CO2) (ASTEC, Fukuoka, Japan) for 4 or 8 h. Subsequently,

Endogenous GPR3 expression is associated with neuronal survival in
cerebellar granule neurons
In our previous report, we clariﬁed that knockdown of endogenous
GPR3 expression in CGNs results in a signiﬁcant inhibition of neurite
extension (Tanaka et al., 2007). During these knockdown studies, we
noted the possibility that a reduction in GPR3 expression may be associated with neuronal vulnerability. Subsequently, we investigated whether endogenous GPR3 expression was involved in CGN survival. The level
of GPR3 expression in CGNs has been reported to gradually increase
after birth until P7, whereas GPR6 and GPR12 were minimally detected
in these neurons (Tanaka et al., 2007, 2009). We thus prepared CGNs
from P7 pups of wild-type or GPR3-knockout mice and cultured them
in a normokalemic culture medium. Twenty-four hours after plating,
the CGNs were ﬁxed, and apoptosis was detected using terminal dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining (Gavrieli et al., 1992). The number
of TUNEL-positive neurons was signiﬁcantly greater in the GPR3knockout mice than in the wild-type or the heterozygous mice (Fig. 1A).
We then investigated whether endogenous GPR3 expression is associated with neuronal survival during neuronal development. In the
postnatal cerebellum, granular neuron progenitors proliferate in the external granular layer (EGL). These granule cells migrate inwards

218

through the Purkinje neuron layer (PL) and then ﬁnally settle into the
internal granular cell layer (IGL) where they differentiate into mature
neurons. During this period, the apoptotic elimination of various cell
types may be a critical mechanism for the development of a functioning
anatomical and physiological network (Hatten, 1993). We have recently
shown that GPR3 is expressed in the IGL of the developing cerebellum
(Tanaka et al., 2007, 2009) and hypothesized that GPR3 plays an
antiapoptotic role in developing cerebellar granule neurons. To address
this hypothesis, cerebellar sections from wild-type and GPR3−/− pups,
aged postnatal day 7, day 14, and day 21, were stained with an antibody
speciﬁc for cleaved caspase-3. In wild-type mice, caspase-3-positive
apoptotic cells were observed in the EGL, molecular layer (ML), and IGL
in the cerebellum at P7 and P14, but were scarcely observed in all layers
of the cerebellum at P21 (Fig. 1B). However, the number of caspase-3positive cells was signiﬁcantly increased in the IGL of the cerebellum in

Upregulated expression of GPR3, GPR6, and GPR12 in rat primary neurons
facilitates neuronal survival
We sought to determine whether the expression of GPR3, GPR6, or
GPR12 improved neuronal survival. To address this question, we chose
an in vitro potassium-deprivation model (D'Mello et al., 1993). Primary
cultured CGNs are known to survive and differentiate at high potassium
concentrations (hyperkalemia), whereas they undergo apoptosis when
supplied with a normal concentration of potassium ions (normokalemia).

cells in the EGL between wild-type and GPR3−/− mice. These results indicate that intrinsic GPR3 expression is involved in neuronal survival both
in vitro and in vivo during cerebellar development.

Rat CGNs were prepared from P7 pups and electroporated with GPR
expression vectors using the same method we have previously reported.
Using our transfection method to CGNs, the transfection efﬁciency was
approximately 50% and when the exogenous GPR3-expressing vector
was transfected, recombinant GPR3 mRNA was expressed at levels 10fold higher than those of endogenous GPR3 (Tanaka et al., 2007, 2009).
We then applied this transfection method for the WST-1 assay.
Electroporated cells were plated onto PDL/laminin precoated plates
with a medium containing a high potassium concentration (26 mM).
Twenty-four hours after the transfection, the medium was changed to
one with a normal potassium concentration (5 mM). Forty-eight
hours after transfection, the WST-1 assay was performed. The viability
of the GPR3-, GPR6-, and GPR12-transfected neurons was signiﬁcantly
enhanced compared with that of the neurons transfected with the control vector (Fig. 2A). The addition of the adenylate cyclase activator,
forskolin, and the cAMP analog, dbcAMP, also improved the survival of
the CGNs in normal potassium medium.
Next, we evaluated apoptotic neurons transfected with GPR3, GPR6,
and GPR12 expression vectors that simultaneously express GFP. The
transfected neurons were then exposed to the potassium-deprivation
model and visualized using TUNEL staining. We used electroporation
as the transfection method for CGNs because of its efﬁciency of transduction. However, this method also produces neuronal damage to
some extent. For this reason, we ﬁrst evaluated the rate of apoptotic
neurons in electroporated or non-electroporated conditions. When
non-electroporated CGNs are cultured in normokalemic or hyperkalemic
conditions, the rate of apoptotic cells was around 2–4% at 2 DIV in both
conditions (Supplemental 1A). Next we determined the viability of
neurons after electroporation in the potassium-deprivation model. In
all CGNs kept in hyperkalemic conditions (both GFP-positive transfected
neurons and not-transfected neurons), approximately 10% of the neurons were apoptotic from 2 to 4 DIV (Supplemental 1B). Because the
rate of apoptotic cells was around 2% at 2–3 DIV in non-electroporated
CGNs, around 8% of neuronal death might be attributed to cytotoxicity
by electroporation. After stimulation by potassium deprivation, approximately 25% of the neurons were apoptotic at 2–3 DIV and 40% at 4 DIV
(Supplemental 1B). Further, when we focused on transfected neurons
(GFP-positive neurons), almost all GFP-positive neurons were not
apoptotic from 2 DIV to 4 DIV which could be because the neurons damaged by electroporation did not produce GFP or leakage of GFP occurred
in damaged neurons at this time-point (Supplemental 1C). Upon the
stimulation of potassium deprivation, the number of GFP-positive neurons was increased, approximately 15% at 3 DIV and 22% at 4 DIV (Supplemental 1C). Hence, we conclude that apoptosis of electroporating
neurons can be evaluated in this model. CGNs were transfected with
pHGC (mock), pHGC-GPR3, -GPR6, or -GPR12, which simultaneously
express GFP. Forty-eight hours after potassium deprivation, TUNEL
staining (red) was performed to assess apoptotic neurons. Only 5% of
the neurons were found to undergo apoptosis in the presence of high
potassium, whereas approximately 23% of the neurons became apoptotic after being changed to normokalemic conditions (Figs. 2B and C).
Conversely, the number of TUNEL-positive CGNs was signiﬁcantly
decreased in GPR3-, GPR6-, or GPR12-transfected CGNs. These results
indicated that these GPRs enhanced neuronal survival and modulated
neuronal apoptosis in rat primary neurons.
GPR3 protects neurons from apoptosis induced by various stimuli
It has been reported that apoptotic neuronal cell death is induced
following brain ischemia (Hara et al., 1997; Namura et al., 1998). We
subsequently investigated whether GPR3 additionally mediated
the survival of CGNs under hypoxic conditions. Rat P7 CGNs were
electroporated with a GPR3/EGFP expression vector or a control GFP
expression vector. Twenty-four hours after the electroporation, the
transfected CGNs were incubated in a low oxygen chamber (1% O2, 5%
CO2) for 4 h and then returned to a normal oxygen incubation chamber.

219

As a positive control, dbcAMP was added to the CGNs that expressed
EGFP alone. Thirty-six hours after electroporation, the cells were ﬁxed,
and apoptotic neurons were assayed using TUNEL staining. The number
of CGNs stained positive for both GFP and TUNEL was signiﬁcantly
reduced in GPR3-transfected or dbcAMP-treated CGNs in comparison
to control CGNs (Figs. 3A and B). These ﬁndings demonstrate that exogenous GPR3 expression protects postnatal CGNs from hypoxia-induced
apoptosis. We further examined whether the inhibition of endogenous
GPR3 expression abolishes the protective effect of GPR3 on hypoxiainduced apoptosis. CGNs were electroporated with GPR3 siRNA or
control siRNA. Our previous reports demonstrated that siRNA knocks
down GPR3 expression to 60% of control mRNA levels (Tanaka et al.,
2007, 2009). To visualize transfected cells, an EGFP expression vector
was also co-transfected with each siRNA. Twenty-four hours after
electroporation, the cells were exposed to low oxygen conditions
for 4 or 8 h. Thirty-six hours after electroporation, the CGNs were
ﬁxed, and TUNEL staining was performed. After a four-hour exposure
to low oxygen, the number of neurons stained positive for both EGFP
and TUNEL was signiﬁcantly greater in the GPR3 siRNA-treated CGNs
than in the control siRNA-treated CGNs (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the
number of TUNEL-positive neurons in the GPR3 siRNA-treated
CGNs was increased when the period of hypoxia was extended.
These results suggest that knockdown of endogenous GPR3 expression in CGNs is associated with the vulnerability of neurons to hypoxic conditions.
Subsequently, we investigated whether GPR3 helps CGNs to tolerate
oxidative stress caused by ROS. We therefore treated GPR3-transfected
neurons with paraquat, because several studies have suggested the involvement of ROS in paraquat-mediated cell toxicity (González-Polo
et al., 2004; Mollace et al., 2003). The number of apoptotic neurons
increased with increasing paraquat concentrations in the CGNs
transfected with the control vector (Figs. 4A–B). Additionally, for the
CGNs treated with 1.0 mM paraquat, the number of apoptotic neurons
was lower in the GPR3-transfected CGNs than in the mock vectortransfected CGNs (Figs. 4A–B), whereas the inhibition of endogenous
GPR3 by siRNA resulted in a signiﬁcantly higher proportion of apoptotic
cells compared with the controls (Figs. 4C–D). Moreover, the difference
in the number of apoptotic neurons between control siRNA- and GPR3
siRNA-treated neurons increased with increasing paraquat concentrations (0.04 mM–1.0 mM) (Figs. 4C–D). These ﬁndings indicate that
GPR3 expression in CGNs exerts a cell protective effect against paraquat,
in addition to hypoxia.

The antiapoptotic effect of GPR3 is mediated via the PKA, MAP kinase and
PI3 kinase pathways
We previously reported that the stimulatory G protein Gs and the
activation of PKA are essential for GPR12-mediated neurite outgrowth
(Tanaka et al., 2007). Therefore, we speculated that the GPR3mediated antiapoptotic effect may also be mediated by the Gs–PKA signaling pathway. To test this idea, we evaluated the extent of apoptosis
in rat CGNs cultured with or without various inhibitors of signaling
pathways. In neurons transfected with the control vector, the number
of apoptotic neurons increased under normokalemic conditions
(Fig. 5). This effect was inhibited by the upregulation of GPR3 expression. However, upon the addition of the PKA inhibitors, Rp-cAMP or
KT5720, to the medium, the number of apoptotic neurons increased
compared with the PBS control group (Figs. 5A–B). Surprisingly, in
addition to the PKA inhibitors, the MAP kinase inhibitor, U0126, and
the PI3 kinase inhibitor, LY294002, inhibited the GPR3-mediated
antiapoptotic effect (Figs. 5C–D). However, the PKC inhibitor, Gö6976,
did not demonstrate an effect when compared to the PBS controls
(Fig. 5E). These results indicate that the antiapoptotic effect of GPR3 is
mediated via the MAP kinase and PI3 kinase signaling pathways in
CGNs using a potassium-deprivation model.

2013; Zhou et al., 2009). We thus speculated that the intrinsic expression of GPR3 in neurons is associated with neuronal survival
via basal level activation of the MAP kinase and PI3 kinase signaling
pathways.
To test this idea, CGNs were transfected with GPR3 siRNA or control
siRNA, and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt was assessed 24 h
after transfection using Western blot analysis and a speciﬁc antibody
against phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-Akt. The phosphorylation
state of ERK1/2 and Akt was signiﬁcantly reduced when endogenous
GPR3 expression was inhibited using GPR3-directed siRNA (Figs. A–C),
whereas upregulated expression of GPR3 in CGNs signiﬁcantly
increased the phosphorylation of ERK2 and Akt. The phosphorylation
of ERK1 also tended to increase with the upregulation of GPR3, but
this increase was not signiﬁcant. These results suggest that an increase in GPR3 expression during neuronal development increased
the basal phosphorylation of ERK and Akt under normal culture
conditions.
We further investigated whether basal ERK1/2 activation is regulated by a PKA-dependent pathway. As shown in Fig. 6G, the administration of the PKA inhibitor KT5720 decreased the GPR3-mediated basal
ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Conversely, the basal level of phosphorylated
Akt was not affected by KT5720 (data not shown). To further conﬁrm
the involvement of PKA in basal ERK1/2 regulation by GPR3, we constructed a GPR3 mutant containing a mutation in the Asp-Arg-Tyr
(DRY) motif (GPR3 D133A). The DRY motif in the second loop of
GPR3 has been reported to be important for the interaction of GPR3
with Gs, and the substitution of Asp to Ala (GPR3 D133A) results in
a decrease in the intracellular cAMP level (Thathiah et al., 2013).
The transfection of GPR3 D133A in CGNs abrogated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in comparison to that of wild-type GPR3 24 h after transfection
(Fig. 6H). These results indicated that Gs-mediated upregulation of
cAMP may be involved in the basal level activation of ERK1/2 by GPR3
in CGNs.

GPR3 gene is substituted by a β-galactosidase gene under the control
of the endogenous GPR3 promoter. X-gal staining revealed that GPR3

were incubated in hyperkalemic medium (26 mM) for ﬁrst 24 h, then the medium was
changed to normokalemic medium (5 mM) to induce apoptosis. As a control, some neurons

transfection. The mean ± SEM was calculated for each condition (n = 3), and the values
are expressed as a percentage of the value of the control vector-transfected neurons in

22–25 g, were anesthetized and ischemia was induced by middle
cerebral artery occlusion using a silicone-coated nylon suture for
60 min, followed by reperfusion. The infarct area was evaluated 48
h after ischemia using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)
staining. The GPR3 −/− mice demonstrated a signiﬁcantly larger infarct volume compared with that of the wild-type mice, 48 h after
brain ischemia (Figs. 7B and C). To further examine the vulnerability
of neurons in GPR3 −/− mice under these ischemic conditions, Nissl
staining was performed. The GPR3−/− mice indicated larger neuronal
loss in the cortex and the striatum in the ischemic hemisphere, 24 h
after ischemia. These results indicate that GPR3 protects the brain
from ischemia in vivo.

Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that the expression of GPR3 modulates the viability of cultured P7 rat CGNs and
mediates an antiapoptotic effect in various apoptosis-inducing models
using rat cerebellar granule neurons. Studies using pharmacological
inhibitors suggest that this effect is mediated by the MAP kinase and
PI3 kinase signaling pathways. These novel ﬁndings suggest a possible
neuroprotective function of GPR3 against a variety of apoptotic stimuli
in vitro and in vivo.
GPR3, GPR6, and GPR12 constitute a family of constitutively active,
Gs-coupled receptors and are highly expressed in the brain (Eggerickx
et al., 1995; Saeki et al., 1993; Song et al., 1994; Tanaka et al., 2007).
Among these receptors, GPR3 is also expressed in oocytes, causing the
constitutive upregulation of intracellular cAMP, thereby contributing
to the maintenance of oocytes in a prophase I meiotic arrest phase
(Mehlmann et al., 2004). Conversely, the physiological function of
GPR3 in the brain has been poorly understood. In the brain, GPR3 is
highly distributed in the hippocampus, the medial habenular nucleus,
and the cerebellum (Saeki et al., 1993; Tanaka et al., 2007, 2009). In
the cerebellum, GPR3 expression increases in rat granule neurons during development, and its expression contributes to neuronal development (Tanaka et al., 2009). In the current study, we clariﬁed that
GPR3 also functions in CGNs in neuronal survival during cerebellar
development. Interestingly, PACAP and its receptor PAC1 are also
expressed in the developing cerebellum, suggesting their involvement
in its ontogenesis. The inhibition of PACAP caused an increased number
of apoptotic neurons in the IGL (Allais et al., 2007), and PAC1-deﬁcient
mice demonstrated an increased number of apoptotic neurons in the
EGL and the IGL (Allais et al., 2007; Falluel-Morel et al., 2008). PAC1 is
primarily expressed in the EGL of the developing cerebellum (Basille
et al., 2000), whereas GPR3 is predominantly expressed in the IGL during development after birth (Tanaka et al., 2009). The difference in the
layer of apoptotic neurons may be attributed to the timing and
location of Gs-coupled receptors during cerebellar development. The
expression of GPR3 in CGNs increased during development, and is
maintained thereafter in neurons (Tanaka et al., 2009). However,
GPR3-knockout mice do not exhibit apparent developmental defects
in the morphology of the central nervous system (Tanaka et al., 2009;
Valverde et al., 2009). Thus, redundant mechanisms, such as growth
factors and other GPCRs, may rescue the function of GPR3 in cell survival
in CGNs during neuronal development.

Fig. 3. GPR3 is involved in the survival of CGNs under hypoxic conditions. CGNs were
transfected with either pHGC (mock) or pHGC-GPR3 that simultaneously expressed GFP.
Subsets of pHGC-transfected neurons were treated with 1 mM dbcAMP for 18 h after electroporation. Twenty-four hours after transfection, neurons were exposed to a low oxygen
atmosphere (1% O2, 5% CO2) for 4 h and then were returned to a normal oxygen incubator.
Thirty-six hours after transfection, apoptotic neurons were assessed using ﬂuorescent
TUNEL staining (red). (A) Representative images from dishes of neurons transfected with
the control vector (left), neurons transfected with the GPR3 vector (middle), and neurons
transfected with the mock vector that were treated with dbcAMP (right) are shown. The
arrow heads indicate apoptotic cells in neurons transfected with the mock vector that
stained positive for both GFP and TUNEL (yellow). (B) Five random ﬁelds were selected
per dish (n = 3). The values are expressed as the percentage of cells stained positive for
both GFP and TUNEL out of the total number of GFP-positive cells in GPR3-transfected
or dbcAMP-treated neurons compared with control neurons, i.e., the percentage of the
control vector-transfected neurons. The mean ± SEM was calculated for each condition.
The asterisk (*) represents p b 0.001 compared with neurons transfected with the control

Fig. 4. GPR3 protects neurons from apoptosis in paraquat-treated CGNs. CGNs were transfected with either pHGC (mock) or pHGC-GPR3. Eight hours after the transfection, neurons were
exposed to different concentrations of paraquat (0–1.0 mM) for 16 h (A–B). Apoptotic neurons were assessed using Hoechst 33342 staining. (A) Representative images from dishes

In the current study, the suppression of intrinsic GPR3 expression
during development resulted in signiﬁcantly reduced basal levels of
ERK and Akt phosphorylation, which was associated with apoptosis in
neurons under normal culture conditions. Basal activation of ERK during
neuronal development was also reported in rat cortical and hippocampal neurons (Zhou et al., 2009). These authors suggested that calcium
channel- or NMDAR-mediated ERK phosphorylation correlated with
neuroplasticity following neuronal maturation. Moreover, GPR3 is also
upregulated in cortical and hippocampal neurons during maturation
(unpublished results). The present study revealed that the basal level
activation of ERK is correlated with neuronal survival in CGNs. Thus, in
addition to NMDAR, GPR3 may be generally associated with neuronal
survival in the central nervous system.
In addition to ERK, the basal level activation of Akt was decreased by
the suppression of endogenous GPR3 in CGNs. Many reports have demonstrated the involvement of Akt phosphorylation in the antiapoptotic

response against various stimuli (Brunet et al., 2001; Niizuma et al.,
2009). However, the mechanism underlying the GPR3-mediated basal
level activation of Akt remains unclear from the current study. Recent
reports have indicated that GPR3 interacts with β-arrestin2 (Lowther
et al., 2013; Thathiah et al., 2013). Classically, β-arrestins are well
known as signal terminators for GPCRs. However, accumulating evidence indicates that β-arrestins also function as signal transducers in
various signaling pathways, including ERK and Akt (Shenoy and
Lefkowitz, 2011). Several GPCRs, such as angiotensin II type 1A (AT1a)
(Wei et al., 2003), β2-adrenergic receptors (Shenoy et al., 2006),
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (Zheng et al., 2012), vasopressin
V2 (Ren et al., 2005), and parathyroid hormone (Gesty-Palmer et al.,
2006), activate the ERK cascade and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in a
β-arrestin-dependent manner. Ligand stimulation of the AT1a receptor
in rat vascular smooth muscle cells results in β-arrestin2-mediated activation of the ERK/p90RSK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, thereby

with either pHGC (mock) or pHGC-GPR3. Transfected neurons were kept in hyperkalemic medium (HK; 26 mM). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was changed to

exerting antiapoptotic effects via the phosphorylation of BAD (Ahn
et al., 2009). Conversely, the stimulation of IGF-1 resulted in the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway via β-arrestin1, thereby
preventing apoptosis (Povsic et al., 2003). However, it remains unclear
whether constitutively active Gs-coupled receptors also recruit βarrestins, thereby activating the ERK and/or the PI3K/Akt signaling
pathways.
Alternatively, a receptor–receptor transactivation mechanism has
also been reported for GPCR-mediated signal transduction (Rajagopal
et al., 2004). Bertelson et al. demonstrated that ligands of Gs-coupled receptors can rapidly transactivate the EGF receptor through a signaling

cascade that involves cAMP/PKA signaling (Bertelsen et al., 2004).
Delcourt et al. also conﬁrmed that PACAP stimulates the phosphorylation
of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in cultured neurons (Delcourt et al., 2007).
These reports suggest that GPR3-mediated activation of the ERK and the
PI3 kinase pathways may be mediated by transactivation through EGFR
or IFG-1R.
In the present study, we found that the expression of GPR3 in CGNs
exerted prosurvival effects against apoptosis-inducing stimuli, such as
potassium deprivation, hypoxia, and ROS. It has been reported that
several growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)

(GDNF) (Miyazaki et al., 1999; Nicole et al., 2001), nerve growth factor
(NGF) (Guegan et al., 1999) and hypoxia related hormones, such as
erythropoietin (Ruscher et al., 2002; Siren et al., 2001) and granulocyte
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (Schabitz et al., 2008;
Schneider et al., 2005), have been implicated to counteract hypoxiaand ROS-induced neuronal injuries. However, even in the absence of
such trophic factors, the elevation of intrinsic cAMP has been known
to induce antiapoptotic effects in various types of neurons (D'Mello
et al., 1993; Hanson et al., 1998; Michel and Agid, 1996; Nakao, 1998;
Rydel and Greene, 1988). Furthermore, the ligand-dependent Gscoupled GPCR, PAC1, has been reported to protect neurons from apoptosis (Mei et al., 2004; Yan et al., 1995). These reports are consistent with
the current ﬁndings that the constitutively active Gs-coupled receptor
GPR3 plays potentially antiapoptotic roles in the cellular response to
different stimuli. Thus, Gs-mediated signaling is thought to contribute
to the survival of neurons against various neuronal injuries.

We further clariﬁed that PKA-, ERK- and Akt-dependent signaling
pathways are important for the GPR3-mediated antiapoptotic effect in a
potassium-deprivation model. The activation of PKA, which is the downstream effector of cAMP, induces the phosphorylation of BAD at Ser112 or
Ser155 (Datta et al., 2000; Harada et al., 1999), whereas Akt phosphorylates BAD at Ser136 to promote cell survival (Datta et al., 1997). Phosphorylated BAD promotes the dissociation of BAD from Bcl-XL, resulting in an
antiapoptotic effect (Scheid et al., 1999). Moreover, the ligand-dependent
Gs activator PACAP exerts an antiapoptotic effect via ERK and Akt
phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of BAD in cardiomyocytes and
neurons (Gasz et al., 2006; Racz et al., 2006, 2007, 2008). In addition to
the inhibition of BAD, PKA may also contribute to neuronal survival
through the activation of CREB, via increased transcription of CREBrelated survival genes (Lonze et al., 2002; Riccio et al., 1999). Further studies are necessary to clarify the involvement of BAD phosphorylation and
CREB activation in the GPR3-mediated antiapoptotic response in CGNs.

adult mouse brain, GPR3−/−; LacZ+/+ mice, with the β-galactosidase gene substituted into the GPR3 locus, were utilized. X-gal staining revealed activation of the transcriptional activity
of the GPR3 promoter in the olfactory bulb, the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, the striatum, and the medial habenular nucleus of the forebrain. (B–C) Adult male, wild-type or GPR3knockout, mice were anesthetized and ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 60 min (n = 5 for wild-type mice and n = 3 for GPR3-knockout mice). The infarct area
48 h after ischemia was evaluated using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. The infarct areas were traced and calculated using NIH image software. The means ± SEM were
calculated for each condition. The asterisk (*) represents p b 0.05 compared with wild-type mice. (D) Nissl staining was performed in the sections from wild-type or GPR3-knockout, mice

In the current study, we clariﬁed for the ﬁrst time that the constitutively active, Gs-coupled receptor, GPR3, is neuroprotective against
brain ischemia. In in vivo brain ischemia models, caspase-mediated
neuronal death has been reported to be involved after ischemic brain injury or excitotoxic neuronal damage (Hara et al., 1997; Le et al., 2002; Li
et al., 1995; Namura et al., 1998; Velier et al., 1999) and is attenuated by
the inhibition of the caspase pathway (Hara et al., 1997). Furthermore,
the exogenous administration and endogenous expression of PACAP
counteract hypoxia-mediated (Vaudry et al., 2002, 2005) or ischemiamediated (Ohtaki et al., 2006; Stumm et al., 2007) apoptotic neuronal
death via the MAP kinase pathway. Thus, constitutively active Gscoupled receptors may play a role in neuronal survival under ischemic
conditions. However, the speciﬁc pathway that mediates the neuroprotection conferred by GPR3 under ischemic conditions remains unclear.
Further studies are required to clarify the mechanism underlying the
GPR3-mediated antiapoptotic effects following brain ischemia.
Conclusion
In summary, constitutively active Gs-coupled GPCRs may act as
neuroprotective factors against various neurological conditions, such
as stroke and traumatic brain injuries, and increasing their activity or
expression may be a promising therapeutic approach.
