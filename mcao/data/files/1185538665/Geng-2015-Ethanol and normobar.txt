Background and Purpose—Ischemic stroke induces metabolic disarray. A central regulatory site, pyruvate dehydrogeanse
complex (PDHC) sits at the cross-roads of 2 fundamental metabolic pathways: aerobic and anaerobic. In this study,
we combined ethanol (EtOH) and normobaric oxygen (NBO) to develop a novel treatment to modulate PDHC and
its regulatory proteins, namely pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, leading to
improved metabolism and reduced oxidative damage.
Methods—Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to transient (2, 3, or 4 hours) middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by
3- or 24-hour reperfusion, or permanent (28 hours) middle cerebral artery occlusion without reperfusion. At 2 hours after
the onset of ischemia, rats received either an intraperitoneal injection of saline, 1 dose of EtOH (1.5 g/kg) for 2- and 3-hour
middle cerebral artery occlusion, 2 doses of EtOH (1.5 g/kg followed by 1.0 g/kg in 2 hours) in 4 hours or permanent
middle cerebral artery occlusion, and EtOH+95% NBO (at 2 hours after the onset of ischemia for 6 hours) in permanent
stroke. Infarct volumes and neurological deficits were examined. Oxidative metabolism and stress were determined by
measuring ADP/ATP ratio and reactive oxygen species levels. Protein levels of PDHC, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase,
and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase were assessed.
Results—EtOH induced dose-dependent neuroprotection in transient ischemia. Compared to EtOH or NBO alone,
NBO+EtOH produced the best outcomes in permanent ischemia. These therapies improved brain oxidative metabolism
by decreasing ADP/ATP ratios and reactive oxygen species levels, in association with significantly raised levels of PDHC
and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase, as well as decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase.
Conclusions—Both EtOH and EtOH+NBO treatments conferred neuroprotection in severe stroke by affecting brain
metabolism. The treatment may modulate the damaging cascade of metabolic events by bringing the PDHC activity back
to normal metabolic levels.   (Stroke. 2015;46:492-499. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.006994.)

troke is one of the most debilitating vascular diseases
worldwide, which is keeping our healthcare costs as high
as $38.6 billion each year.1 Systemic thrombolysis with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator and in situ clot retrieval
remain the only reperfusion strategies approved by the Food
and Drug Administration. However, after nearly 2 decades of
tissue-type plasminogen activator use in the United States, most
patients with acute ischemic stroke have not benefited from a
reperfusion strategy, with <10% of patients actually receiving systemic thrombolysis. This is attributed to tissue-type

plasminogen activator’s contraindications, and most importantly, its narrow therapeutic time window. Furthermore, while
a small portion of patients (17%) undergo spontaneous lysis
by 6 to 8 hours,2 many patients experience permanent artery
occlusion.3 In addition, even if recanalization is successful,
outcome is often poor because of reperfusion injury.4
Although energy failure and oxidative stress with reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation after ischemia are
well-documented pathophysiologies of neural injury, recent
research has failed to develop targeted therapies to address

these dysfunctions that may confer neuroprotection acutely
after stroke. Immediately after brain stroke, a shift from
aerobic to anaerobic metabolism occurs in ischemic tissue.
Pyruvate dehydrogeanse complex (PDHC), a key element in
cellular metabolism, as well as its strategic regulators, is the
link between aerobic and anaerobic energy metabolism. It is
composed of multiple subunits that altogether convert pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A to eventually make ATP needed for
different cellular functions.5 PDHC’s vast size and strict regulation makes it sensitive to inactivation and downregulation
in stroke. Two key regulators of PDHC are pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP). Notably, PDK actively phosphorylates various
sites on the E1α subunit of PDHC resulting in the inhibition
of the entire enzyme complex. Conversely, PDP removes the
phosphate group off the serine residues and thus activates the
enzyme.6 Ultimately, PDHC, PDK, and PDP changes after
stroke would provide important indexes to assess oxidative
metabolism underlying ischemic injury after stroke.
Previous studies have demonstrated that EtOH decreases
brain catabolism,7,8 raising its potential as a clinical neuroprotectant in ameliorating metabolic dysfunction after stroke. In
rats with 2-hour middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), we
previously showed that a postischemia moderate but not a lower
dose of EtOH reduced brain infarction and improved functional
outcome in rats.9 Oxygen administration has been identified as
a rational strategy for stroke therapy, and normobaric oxygen
(NBO) is readily available, inexpensive and can be quickly
applied. However, the time window for NBO is short, and its
therapeutic effect is relatively low in both transient and permanent focal ischemia.3,10 Considering the brain metabolic depressive and protective effects of EtOH, and the beneficial effects
of NBO on metabolic stress after stroke, as well as the fact that
both agents can be easily delivered through the blood brain barrier into the ischemic brain, we aimed at determining the therapeutic effect of EtOH or EtOH+NBO in stroke by normalizing
oxidative metabolism through various regulatory mediators of
PDHC. Because an early reperfusion strategy may not be available for most patients, and because the proposed treatments can
be effectively administered and delivered to ischemic regions
through the collateral circulation that remains patent in patients
with stroke,11–15 we used more clinically relevant stroke models
with longer ischemia periods (4 versus 2 or 3 hours) or without
reperfusion (permanent stroke).

Materials and Methods
Subjects
All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal
Investigation Committee of Wayne State University in accordance with
the National Institutes of Health guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals. A total of 176 adult, male Sprague–Dawley rats (Charles
River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were randomly divided into the
following groups such as (1) a sham-operated group without MCAO
(n=8), (2) 2-hour MCAO (n=8×2), (3) 3-hour MCAO (n=8×2), (4)
4-hour MCAO (n=8×9), and (5) permanent MCAO (28 hours; n=8×8).
The 2- and 3-hour MCAO groups were randomly assigned to receive
either saline (sham treatment) or an intraperitoneal injection of EtOH
(1.5 g/kg) at 2 hours after the onset of ischemia. For the 4-hour MCAO,
rats in total 9 groups were randomly assigned to receive 3 different
treatments (saline, 1 dose [1.5 g/kg] or 2 doses [1.5 g/kg at 2 hours after

the onset of MCAO followed by 1.0 g/kg in 2 hours] of EtOH), and animals were analyzed at 3 time points (24 hours of reperfusion for infarct
volume, 3 and 24 hours of reperfusion for protein, and biochemical
measurements). For permanent stroke, rats in 8 groups were randomly
assigned to receive 4 treatments (saline, 2 doses of EtOH [1.5 g/kg at 2
hours after the onset of MCAO followed by 1.0 g/kg in 2 hours], 95%
NBO [at 2 hours after the onset of ischemia for 6 hours], or EtOH+95%
NBO); and were processed for infarct volume and biochemical analyses, respectively, at 28 hours after ischemia. The mortality rate was low
(<9%) and was about equal in each group. All data were analyzed in a
blind manner. Animals were fed the night before.

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Rats were subjected to MCAO for either 2, 3, 4, or 28 hours using
the intraluminal filament model.16 Reperfusion was achieved by the
withdrawal of the filament at each corresponding time point as mentioned above. Blood PCO2 and PO2, and mean arterial pressure were
monitored throughout the procedure. Heating lamps and pads were
used to maintain rectal temperature at 36.5 to 37.5°C. See online-only
Data Supplement for details.

EtOH Treatment
In transient ischemic stroke with 2-hour MCAO, the treatment was
given immediately before reperfusion both to mimic actual scenarios
encountered in clinical settings and to prevent reperfusion injury. In
other MCAO groups, all ischemic rats received 1 EtOH dose (1.5 g/
kg IP) at 2 hours after ischemia onset (the time point with a confirmed
EtOH neuroprotective effect).9 Rats in the 4 hours and permanent
MCAO groups received a second EtOH dose (1.0 g/kg) at 2 hours
after the first dose.

NBO Treatment
To receive NBO treatment, rats at 2 hours after the onset of ischemia
were placed in a sealed chamber (50×25×25 cm) full of 95% oxygen for
6 hours. To maintain oxygen concentration, an oxygen controller (PROOX110; Reming Bioinstruments Co, Redfield, NY) was used and the
oxygen flow rate was 2 L/min.17 In addition, carbon dioxide was removed
by placing a container of soda lime (Sigma) at the bottom of the chamber.

Combination Treatment With NBO and EtOH
At 2 hours after the onset of ischemia, animals that received IP injections
of EtOH as described above were then placed into a sealed chamber full
of 95% oxygen to undergo consecutive NBO treatment for 6 hours.

Neurological Deficit
The scoring system proposed by Belayev et al18 was used to examine the severity of deficit in rats before surgery, during MCAO after
24-hour reperfusion or 28-hour MCAO without reperfusion.

Cerebral Infarct Volume
Twenty-four hours after reperfusion or 28 hours after MCAO without
reperfusion, brains were obtained from ischemic rats and cut into a
2-mm thick slices and treated with 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma) for staining. An indirect method for calculating infarct
volume was used to minimize error caused by edema.9

ADP/ATP Ratio
Brain metabolism was measured with the BioVision ApoSENSOR
Assay Kit (Mountain View, CA), as described by us.8 See online-only
Data Supplement.

ROS Production
ROS was detected as described previously by us.17 See online-only
Data Supplement.

Figure 1. Infarct volume. A, middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2,
3, and 4 hours, as well as permanent
stroke induces substantial infarct volume. EtOH administration significantly
(##P<0.01) reduces infarct volume in
both the 2- and 3-hour MCAO, but not
in the 4 hour and the permanent MCAO
groups. B, Whereas in the 4-hour MCAO
group, infarct volumes were significantly
(##P<0.01) reduced by 2 EtOH doses
(1.5 g/kg at 2 hours after the onset of
ischemia followed by 1.0 g/kg in 2 hours),
treatment with 1 dose of EtOH did not
significantly decrease infarct volume. C,
In permanent ischemia (28-hour MCAO
without reperfusion), 2-dose EtOH (1.5 g/
kg at 2 hours after the onset of ischemia
followed by 1.0 g/kg in 2 hours), or normobaric oxygen (NBO) administration for
6 hours only slightly decreased (#P<0.05)
infarct volume, whereas the combination
of EtOH+NBO produced the most significant (##P<0.01) reduction. Associated
with every infarct volume figure is a representative brain section with and without
the treatment. Most of our treatments'
effects were observed in the penumbra
region, showed by reduced infarction in
the peripherally perfused regions.

Protein Expression

Results

Western blot was used to detect protein levels of PDHC, PDP, and
PDK. Brain tissue samples containing frontoparietal cortex and dorsolateral striatum, the MCA supplied territories, were processed as
described previously by us8,19 using primary antibody incubation
(PDHC, 1:250; PDP1, 1:1000; PDP2, 1:1000; PDK, 1:1000; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) at 4°C. See online-only Data
Supplement.

There were no significant differences in blood pH and PCO2 in
each group. However, a significantly (P<0.05) increased arterial blood PO2 was found in the NBO-treated groups. Body and
brain temperature remained at ≈37°C. See online-only Data
Supplement.

Therapeutic Window of EtOH, NBO, and
Combined Treatment

All the data were described as mean±SE. Differences among
multiple groups were assessed using both the 1- and 2-way
ANOVA with a significance level at P<0.05. Post hoc comparison between groups was detected using the least significant difference method.

Physiological Parameters

In ischemic rats with 2- or 3-hour MCAO, a single dose of
EtOH (1.5 g/kg) significantly (P<0.01) decreased infarct volumes as compared with no-treatment groups (Figure 1A).
Only a mild but nonsignificant decrease in infarct volume was
obtained using 1 dose of EtOH in the 4 hours and permanent

MCAO groups. Furthermore, when 2 doses of EtOH were
used, a significant (P<0.01) reduction in infarct volume was
observed in the 4-hour MCAO ischemic group (Figure 1B).
In the permanent stroke groups, infarct volume (#P<0.05;
Figure 1C) was only mildly reduced by either monotherapy
with EtOH (although 2 doses) or 95% NBO (Figure 1A and
C). The most significant reduction (P<0.01) in brain infarction was obtained when EtOH and 95% NBO were combined
(Figure 1C). Examples of 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
histology show the reduction in penumbral region of ischemic
territory supplied by MCA as hypothesized (Figure 1A–C). In
addition, compared with control, neurological deficits in both
the 2- and 3-hour MCAO groups were decreased significantly
(P<0.01) after single EtOH treatment (Figure 2A). However,
neither a single EtOH dose in 4-hour MCAO (Figure 2B) nor
in tandem EtOH doses in permanent stroke (Figure 2C) were
sufficient to reduce neurological deficits (P=0.068). Similarly
after permanent MCAO, EtOH+NBO therapy again most
effectively (P<0.01) diminished the neurological deficits.

Cerebral Metabolic Disorder and Its Attenuation
Rats in the 4-hour MCAO group showed a significant (P<0.01)
increase in ADP/ATP ratio at 3 and 24 hours of reperfusion
(Figure 3A), suggesting a reduced energy production. The
2-dose EtOH therapy was able to further (P<0.01) decrease
this ratio. This ratio was also significantly (P<0.01) elevated
in permanent stroke (Figure 3B). Conversely, the monotherapy
of NBO or EtOH only mildly (P<0.05) reduced this ratio as
compared with the no-treatment group. In contrast, EtOH and
95% NBO therapy additively (P<0.01) decreased this ratio.

Oxidative Stress
As compared with sham-operated group, ischemia for 4 hours
significantly (P<0.01) increased ROS production at 3 and
24 hours of reperfusion (Figure 4A). In tandem EtOH doses
significantly (P<0.01) reduced ROS levels. Likewise, a significant (P<0.01) increase in ROS levels was observed in the
permanent stroke (Figure 4B). Neither NBO nor EtOH alone
was able to significantly decrease ROS. However, combined
treatment induced a large (P<0.01) reduction in ROS levels,
suggesting an attenuated oxidative damage.

PDHC and PDK Protein Expression
Compared to the sham-operated group, 4-hour ischemia followed by 3-hour reperfusion caused a decrease (P<0.05) in
PDHC protein expression (Figure 5A). This decrease was
even more significant (P<0.01) at 24-hours reperfusion.
EtOH was able to restore PDHC protein expression back
to normal levels (P<0.01) at both time points. Permanent
stroke significantly (P<0.01) reduced PDHC expression
(Figure 5B). Although EtOH or NBO alone were only able
to slightly reverse this reduction, EtOH nevertheless raised
the level of PDHC expression better than NBO. In contrast,
the EtOH+NBO combination substantially (P<0.01) raised
PDHC expression. In correlation with decreased PDHC, PDK
protein expressions were increased (P<0.01) in ischemic rats
with 4-hour MCAO followed by 3- and 24-hour reperfusion,
respectively (Figure 5C). In tandem EtOH doses significantly

Figure 2. Neurological deficit. A, Ischemic stroke caused neurological deficits. EtOH administration significantly (##P<0.01)
reduces these deficits after 2- and 3-hour middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) but not 4 hours and permanent ischemia.
B, Afte 4-hour MCAO, neurological deficits were significantly
(##P<0.01) reversed by EtOH monotherapy with 2 but not 1
doses. C, Although 2 doses of EtOH and monotherapy of normobaric oxygen (NBO) did not produce a significant decrease in the
deficits, combination therapy with both produced a large reduction (##P<0.01). PMCAO indicates permanent MCAO.

(P<0.01) decreased PDK expression. Likewise, permanent
MCAO significantly (P<0.01) increased PDK (Figure 5D). In
addition, the monotherapy with NBO or EtOH only mildly
reduced PDK levels. Similarly to its effects on PDHC, EtOH
alone induced greater reduction in PDK as compared with
NBO alone. As above, the combined treatment was successful
in decreasing these levels (P<0.01).

PDP Protein Expression
Compared to sham-operated control, PDP1 protein expression after 4-hour MCAO was hardly changed at 3 and 24
hours of reperfusion (Figure 6A), whereas EtOH significantly (P<0.01) increased PDP1 levels. After permanent
stroke, PDP1 expression was slightly increased (Figure 6B).
Although EtOH but NBO alone slightly altered PDP1
expression, EtOH+NBO combination significantly (P<0.01)
increase PDP1. In addition, we assessed another PDP protein level, that of PDP2 (Figure 6C and D). The results further confirm the beneficial effects of EtOH alone or EtOH in

3- and 24-hour reperfusion, there was a significant (**P<0.01)

this ratio. B, After PMCAO, there was a significant (**P<0.01)
increase in ADP/ATP ratio. Monotherapy with either EtOH or normobaric oxygen (NBO) alone mildly reduces this ratio (#P<0.05).

combination with NBO in both the transient (4-hour MCAO)
and permanent stroke.

Discussion
EtOH, NBO, and Neuroprotection
This study revealed a dose-dependent neuroprotection of EtOH
after transient ischemia. In permanent stroke, this neuroprotection was augmented when EtOH was therapeutically combined
with NBO. Because reperfusion therapy within a clinically
realistic time window is not available to most patients with
stroke, a goal of the study was to assess EtOH and NBO neuroprotection under severe ischemic conditions with longer time
frames, in contrast to those used in a previous study with moderate stroke (2-hour occlusion or less) and shorter therapeutic window.9,17 Our analysis after treatment with EtOH alone
in transient ischemia or NBO+EtOH with permanent ischemia improved ATP production and reduced ROS generation.
Although the measures here cannot definitely explain the better
outcomes, our findings support a role of EtOH in stabilizing
dysfunctional metabolic pathways mediated by PDHC, PDK,
and PDP in ischemia. In addition, NBO may enhance EtOH
effects by ameliorating ischemia-induced anaerobic metabolism and attenuating the generation of ROS. In this study, the
infarct volume among the brains was variable; the dissected
tissues may have included some undamaged tissue, which perhaps would have been rescued by the treatments. In fact, most
of our treatments' effects were seen in the penumbra region.
Oxygen has been used in the treatment of stroke as a logical
approach to counteract the hypoxic state induced by ischemia.3

Figure 4. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. A, In 4-h
ischemic stroke followed by 3- or 24-hour reperfusion, ROS levels were significantly (**P<0.01) increased. Two EtOH doses (1.5
g/kg followed by 1.0 g/kg) significantly (##P<0.01) reduced ROS
levels. B, In permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO),
there was a significant (**P<0.01) increase in ROS level. Administered as monotherapy, neither EtOH nor normobaric oxygen
(NBO) was able to significantly decrease ROS production. However, combination therapy produced a great reduction (##P<0.01)
in ROS levels. PMCAO indicates permanent MCAO.

Clinically, NBO has been shown to protect the ischemic brain
from damage.20–24 However, in both transient and permanent focal
ischemia, NBO has a relatively short time window and low therapeutic effect.3,10 The recent clinical trial for NBO in acute ischemic stroke was terminated because of unclear efficacy. There
was a high mortality rate in the controlled arm of the study that
was attributed to external causes (http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/
NCT00414726). Thus, it is possible that NBO alone may not
fully resolve ischemic injury because of its multifactorial, deleterious mechanisms. Although EtOH therapeutic potential lies on
its ability to ameliorate the metabolic and oxidative distress during ischemia, especially in the case of short transient ischemia as
confirmed by us.8,9 Our present results show that EtOH alone was
no longer effective in ischemia without reperfusion. The addition
of oxygen as an oxidative compliment is thus deemed essential
to confer neuroprotection. Finally, this study also reveals that,
although when used alone EtOH effect in permanent stroke was
minor, it produced better outcome than NBO on ROS, as well as
on PDHC, PDK, and PDP expressions. The mechanism by which
EtOH achieves its effect may be because of its ability to induce
a hibernation state and minimize oxidative damage by partially
inhibiting glycolysis and other metabolic pathways.7,25 These
effects in turn may slow down energy depletion and extend the
survival time of cells in the penumbra region.26 Thus when metabolic dysfunction was inhibited by EtOH, oxygen may be better
able to ameliorate the hypoxic state of cells.

PDHC Mechanism in Ischemia
PDHC is regarded as a central regulatory site of cellular oxidative metabolism in the mitochondrial matrix. PDHC sits

referenced as 1. Treatment with 2 doses of EtOH (1.5 g/kg followed by 1.0 g/kg) significantly (##P<0.01) increased PDHC protein expression at both time points. B, Permanent MCAO caused a significant (**P<0.01) reduction in PDHC protein expression. A slight (#P<0.05)
increase in expression of PDHC was observed in the EtOH-only and normobaric oxygen (NBO)-only treated groups. However, combination of EtOH+NBO largely increased (##P<0.01) PDHC expression. C, There was a significant (**P<0.01) increase in PDK expression
from rats with 4-hour ischemia followed by 3- and 24-hour reperfusion. Using 2 doses of EtOH (1.5 g/kg followed by 1.0 g/kg) led to a
significant (##P<0.01) reduction at both time points. D, After permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), there was a significant
(**P<0.01) increase in PDK protein levels. EtOH but not NBO alone slightly (#P<0.05) reduced this expression. The combined treatment
significantly (##P<0.01) reversed the reduction in PDK expression. Representative immunoblots are illustrated. PMCAO indicates permanent MCAO.

at the cross-roads of the aerobic citric acid cycle, oxidative
phosphorylation, anaerobic glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis.
PDHC is a multienzyme complex composed of 6 subunits
and 2 regulatory kinase molecules, PDK and PDP.5 Any dysfunction of PDHC and its regulators would result in metabolic crisis, such as a decline in ATP and phosphocreatine,
inability to generate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and
accumulation of lactic acid.5 Specifically, targeted regulation
of PDHC occurs primarily via site-specific phosphorylation.6
After ischemic stroke, a severe oxygen deprivation leads to a
large impairment of oxidative phosphorylation, thus limiting
the production of ATP. This, in turn, raises the production of
ROS after reperfusion which exacerbates cell and tissue injuries.17,27 Our present results support previous study,5 where
large increase in ADP/ATP ratio led to significant rise in ROS
production, which in turn exacerbates impairment of PDHC
expression. Other studies have shown that PDHC deficiency
is related to decreased activity of critical enzymes required for
free radical removal, such as MnSOD.28 As such, there may be
a spiraling feedback cycle where ROS could inactivate PDHC

which then would further augments ROS production in mitochondria. Using ATP production as an index here, decreased
ROS generation by EtOH in transient or EtOH+NBO in permanent stroke suggests an overall better cellular metabolic
status. We, therefore, would advance that EtOH and NBO
may be clinically useful to restabilize cellular metabolism by
modulating 2 pathways of ROS damage—the direct pathway
for ROS generation and an indirect one for ROS generation
via PDHC.

PDHC and Its Regulators
Because PDK and PDP are major regulators of PDHC, another
major goal of the study was to assess how these regulators
might be affected in severe ischemia, and how EtOH and NBO
therapies could affect the regulators. Our results on increase in
PDK protein expression after ischemia confirm previous studies showing a rise in PDK expression from ischemia as a signal
of low energy state pushing the cell to use fatty acids or ketone
bodies as a major energy source.29 Our therapy decreased the
levels of PDK protein, which led to disinhibition of PDHC

Figure 6. Pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP) protein expression. A, Compared to the sham-operated group referenced as
1, there was no change in PDP1 level in rats with 4-hour ischemia followed by 3- or 24-hour reperfusion. EtOH significantly (##P<0.01)
increased the expression of PDP1 to levels more than its normal physiological ones, at both reperfusion time points. B, After permanent
stroke, there was a small increase in the expression of PDP1 in the stroke group; EtOH but not normobaric oxygen (NBO) slightly further
increased (#P<0.05) these levels. Combined (EtOH+NBO) treatment largely (##P<0.01) increased the protein expression. C, There was
a small (#P<0.05) increase in PDP2 levels in 4-hour ischemia followed by 3- or 24-hour reperfusion. PDP2 levels were further increased
(##P<0.01) by ETOH. D, Again, a slight (#P<0.05) increase was observed in permanent stroke after monotherapy of EtOH and NBO. This
increase was significantly (##P<0.01) enhanced by the NBO+EtOH combination. Representative immunoblots are illustrated. MCAO indicates middle cerebral artery occlusion; and PMCAO, permanent MCAO.

by increasing its expression, thus helping to stabilize the
cell after ischemic insult. In addition, we observed a small
increase in the expression of PDP1 and PDP2 after ischemia,
even before treatment. These findings stand in contrast to the
PDP isoenzyme declines previously observed after traumatic
brain injury.30 Such increases could be a mild compensatory
mechanism whereby the cell attempts to self-modulate and
stabilize the concentration of PDHC, although this compensatory mechanism seems to be insufficient. Our therapy (EtOH
or EtOH+NBO), however, was able to further increase PDP
levels beyond its compensatory physiological levels, leading
to neuroprotection. Taken together, these results strongly support the concept that anaerobic metabolism after stroke may
have been stabilized through the effects of PDHC expression by EtOH or EtOH+NBO which led to decreased PDK,
whereas simultaneously increasing PDP levels.

Clinical Potential of EtOH and NBO Therapy
Collateral perfusion, widely recognized to remain functional
after stroke, may exert a dramatic effect on the time course

of ischemic injury, stroke severity, imaging findings, as well
as therapeutic opportunities and subsequent neurological outcomes after stroke.11–15 Because EtOH and NBO are widely
available, readily cross the blood brain barrier and easily diffuse through the collateral circulation into ischemic regions,
even before reperfusion is established, their clinical potential
as therapeutics is apparent. Future implementation of EtOH
and NBO in a clinical setting may move us closer toward the
development of an efficacious neuroprotective therapy.
Although the primary focus here is centered on treatment
effects on ischemic brain tissues, additional mechanistic studies
are needed to assess the correlation between functional outcomes
and the regulatory roles of PDP and PDK. At a more fundamental level, future studies will also aim to determine the cause/
effects relations between EtOH/NBO outcomes and PDHC and
its regulators in ischemic as well as nonischemic brain tissues.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
Materials & Methods
MCA Occlusion (with additional information). Rats were subjected to MCAO for either
2, 3, 4, or 28 h using the intraluminal filament mode1. Briefly a 4.0 nylon suture with a blunted
tip coated with poly-L-lysine was inserted into the right external carotid artery and lodged in the
narrow proximal anterior cerebral artery to block the MCA at its origin. Reperfusion was
achieved by the withdrawal of the filament at each corresponding time point as mentioned above.
Blood pCO2 and pO2, mean arterial pressure (MAP), as well as rectal and brain temperature were
monitored throughout the procedure. In addition, heating lamps and pads were utilized to
maintain rectal temperature at 36.5-37.5 °C.
ADP/ATP Ratio (with additional information). Brain metabolism was measured with
the BioVision ApoSENSOR Assay Kit (CA, USA)2. Briefly right cerebral hemispheres of the
rats were extracted and homogenized in cold PBS buffer. Next, the sample (10 µL) was
transferred into a luminometer plate and 100 µL of the Nucleotide Releasing Buffer was added.
The mixture was then incubated for 10 min at room temperature with gentle shaking and brain
ATP levels in the brain were measured by adding 1 µL of the ATP Monitoring Enzyme into the
brain cell lysate. A luminometer (DTX 880 Multimode Detector, Beckman Coulter) was used to
read the samples after 1 min (Data A). After 10 mins, ADP levels were measured again (Data
B). One µL of ADP Converting Enzyme was then added and the samples were read once more
after 1 min (Data C). ADP/ATP ratio was calculated as: (Data C – Data B)/Data A.
ROS Production (with additional information). The method for detection of ROS was
described previously by us3. This method tests H2O2 levels with hydrogen peroxidase linked to a
fluorescent compound. Brain samples taken from the animals were diluted to 10 mg/ml based on
protein concentration (BCA method) and incubated for 30 min after 100 µg/ml of digitonin
addition. H2O2 levels in brain homogenates were determined using 50 µM Amplex red, 0.1 U/ml
horse radish peroxidase (HRP), and respiratory substrates (4 mM pyruvate, 2 mM malate, 2 mM
glutamate, and 0.8 µM complex V inhibitor oligomycin) at 37ºC on a DTX-880 multimode
detector.
Protein Expression (with additional information). Western Blot analysis was used to
detect protein levels of PDHC, PDP, and PDK. Briefly, extracted protein from the brain issue of
fronto-parietal cortex and striatum were loaded onto a single 10% sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis. Forty µg of protein was loaded per well. Samples were
transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Primary
antibody incubation (PDHC, 1:250; PDP1, 1:1000; PDP2, 1:1000; PDK, 1:1000, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas) was then carried out overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibody
incubation (anti-goat, anti-rabbit, 1:1250; 1:5000; 1:5000; 1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Dallas, Texas) was done for one hour at room temperature. An ECL system was used to detect
immunoreactive bands by luminescence and to quantify protein expression profiles, with the
relative density of Western blot images being obtained by using an image analysis program
(ImageJ 1.48, National Institutes of Health, USA). As a reference, the mean amount of protein
expression from the sham-operation group was assigned a value of 1. The expressions of target
proteins were represented as fold-differences compared to the control.
