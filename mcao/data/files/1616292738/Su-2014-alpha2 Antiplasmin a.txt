troke occurs in 2 forms, ischemic and hemorrhagic, with
≈87%, being of ischemic origin.1 Ischemic strokes are
characterized by the rapid onset of focal neurological symptoms, and the prompt restoration of blood flow should be the
most effective approach for treating ischemic stroke. Currently,
tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), a highly specific serine protease of the fibrinolytic cascade, is the only thrombolytic agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
for the treatment of ischemic stroke.2 However, emerging evidence has suggested that the beneficial effects of reperfusion
associated with thrombolytic treatment are counterbalanced
by potentially harmful activities of tPA,3–7 including a significant increase in the risk of hemorrhagic conversion, a serious
complication that is associated with high mortality.2,8 Thus,
although treatments, such as thrombolysis and thrombectomy,
have been successful, it is estimated that <5% of ischemic
stroke patients receive treatment,9 and 1 major reason for this
low percentage is the risk of hemorrhagic conversion.

clinical trial has been reported testing the safety of the latter
approach.14 Nonetheless, the idea of targeting α2AP has not
received much attention. This may be because α2AP supplementation was shown to reduce bleeding complications in a
rabbit model of thrombolysis with tPA,15 or possibly because
it is counterintuitive that reducing a systemic plasmin inhibitor would be a safe alternative to thrombolysis.16 What Reed
et al12 add to the story is the importance of secondary microvascular thrombosis to infarct size and how α2AP affects
this process. Their data suggest that secondary microvascular
thrombosis in the ischemic penumbra plays a critical role in
infarct expansion, and that enhancing endogenous fibrinolysis
by reducing α2AP activity can significantly improve stroke
outcome. To achieve this, plasma α2AP activities were modulated either genetically with α2AP−/− mice, or via intravenous
infusion of recombinant α2AP, creating different circulating
levels of α2AP in mice.
In addition, the authors elegantly differentiate the effects of
circulating and thrombus-bound α2AP on stroke.12 To accomplish this, the authors generate artificial thromboemboli made
from normal plasma or α2AP-deficient plasma and then inject
these into the middle cerebral artery of α2AP−/− mice. Their
data indicate that thrombus-bound α2AP is less important than
circulating α2AP for infarct size, even if clot bound α2AP is
critical for dissolution of the primary thrombus. This result
further illustrates the importance of secondary microthrombi
formed downstream of primary thrombus for stroke evolution.
Despite this interesting and important concept, several limitations of the study should be taken into account. For instance,
this study does not differentiate between possible effects of
α2AP in the vascular compartment or in brain parenchyma.
In addition, this thromboemboli stroke model is an extreme
example of ischemic stroke with high mortality rates. For
example, in tPA-treated mice mortality reached 100% by 50
hours after treatment, whereas control mice, mortality reached
>65%, both of which are much higher than in other experimental models or in the clinic.
Still, the study by Reed et al provides the reader with the
interesting and important concept that inhibiting circulating
α2AP may promote endogenous fibrinolysis in downstream
areas of secondary thrombosis and that this may reduce infarct
expansion. Finally, it is interesting to note that hemorrhage
in this model was significantly worse in mice receiving tPA
than in mice completely deficient in α2AP. This suggests that
the simple concept that tPA induces hemorrhage by promoting unregulated plasmin activity may not be correct and supports the hypothesis that the association of thrombolytic tPA
with an increased risk of hemorrhage may be because of tPA’s
action on substrates other than plasminogen.17 Whether inhibiting α2AP may be useful for treating ischemic stroke in the

See accompanying article on page 2586
The mechanism by which tPA works to restore vascular
patency and reperfusion is straightforward and well understood.10 tPA activates plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn
dissolves the occluding thrombus to recanalize the blocked
the vessel (Figure). Factors that modulate plasmin activity
would therefore be expected to act in the same pathway as
tPA and to contribute to the fate of clot dissolution and stroke
outcome in a manner consistent with modulation of tPA activity. However, an earlier study in mice genetically deficient in
either tPA or the plasmin inhibitor, α2-antiplasmin (α2AP),
had paradoxically suggested that removing profibrinolytic,
tPA, or antifibrinolytic, α2AP, has similar beneficial outcomes
in a murine model of stroke.11 The report by Reed et al12 in
this issue addresses the role of α2AP in a model of embolic
stroke and provides important new mechanistic insight into
how α2AP affects stroke outcome.
Previous studies of α2AP in stroke have been relatively
limited and focused primarily on following hemostatic factors
during stroke. One exception is the work of Nagai et al11,13 who
have studied the effects of reducing α2AP in animal models
of stroke with antibodies or with microplasmin, and a phase 1

of plasmin and reduces endogenous fibrinolysis
in ischemic stroke. This promotes microvascular
thrombosis in the ischemic penumbra and leads to
infarct expansion. tPA indicates tissue-type plasminogen activator.

evolution is dependent on microvascular thrombi formation,
than agents promoting endogenous fibrinolysis are certainly
worth further study.
