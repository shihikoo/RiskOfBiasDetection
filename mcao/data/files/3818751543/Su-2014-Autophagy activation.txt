Abstract Remote ischemic perconditioning (RIPer) has
been proved to provide potent cardioprotection. However,
there are few studies on neuroprotection of RIPer. This study
aims to clarify the neuroprotective effect of RIPer and the
role of autophagy induced by RIPer against cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury in rats. Using a transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rats to imitate
focal cerebral ischemia. RIPer was carried out 4 cycles of
10 min ischemia and 10 min reperfusion, with a thin elastic
band tourniquet encircled on the bilateral femoral arteries at
the start of 10 min after MCAO. Autophagy inhibitor
3-methyladenine (3-MA) and autophagy inducer rapamycin
were administered respectively to determine the contribution
of autophagy in RIPer. Neurologic deficit scores, infarct
volume, brain edema, Nissl staining, TUNEL assay, immunohistochemistry and western blot was performed to analyze
the neuroprotection of RIPer and the contribution of
autophagy in RIPer. RIPer significantly exerted neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury in
rats, and the autophagy-lysosome pathway was activated by
RIPer treatment. 3-MA reversed the neuroprotective effects
induced by RIPer, whereas rapamycin ameliorated the brain
ischemic injury. Autophagy activation contributes to the
neuroprotection by RIPer against focal cerebral ischemia in
rats.

Introduction
Decrease the degree of ischemia–reperfusion (I–R) has
great practical significance, taking into account the clinical
problem with high morbidity and high mortality.
Kitagawa et al. [1] first discovered that a brief episodes of
sublethal I–R had strong protective effect against the following episode of lethal cerebral I–R, the brief episodes was
named ischemia preconditioning (IPC). However, IPC is
limited to the selectable situations in which the onset of
ischemia can be predicted. So postconditioning [2, 3] which
is applied after reperfusion is more suitable for the unpredictable ischemic events and provides protective effect. For
clinical application, conventional preconditioning and
postconditioning requires occluding and releasing the artery
of the target organ, which is the invasive procedure,
increases both frequency of complications and the technical
risks [4]. Thus, the method of procedure and the operative
time point are the two most important criteria to be selected,
to achieve the best clinical efficacy [5].
One of the most significant breakthroughs in the ischemic
conditioning field came with the discovery that ischemic
conditioning can be performed at a distance or remote from the
ischemic target organ. When the site of conditioning is located
remotely, the conditioning cycles can be applied after reperfusion (remote ischemic postconditioning; RIPost) [6], or
during the ischemia and before reperfusion (remote ischemic
perconditioning; RIPer) [7]. RIPost and RIPer, which can
apply with simple blood pressure cuffs placed around the
proximal part limb [8], become the most feasible to perform in
clinical application. There are some advantages of RIPer in
clinical value than RIPost. RIPer can be operated immediately
as a pre-hospital emergency measures according to above
methods at a sudden onset of ischemia stroke or en route to the
hospital. With the characteristics of easy-to use and low-risk,

Neurochem Res (2014) 39:2068–2077

RIPer can be applied by ambulance personnel or anyone
without medical knowledge in every unpredictable situation,
by which the patients may retain more brain function and have
better prognosis. So far, lots of data have shown that RIPost
play a protective role in ischemia stroke [6, 9], while there are
scarce studies on brain protection by RIPer and its neuroprotection mechanisms.
Autophagy plays an important role in certain diseases
such as cancer [10], neurodegenerative diseases [11], and
infectious diseases [12]. Autophagy was also reported to be
involved in cerebral ischemia [13, 14], but the role of
autophagy in neuroprotection was still controversial. Some
reports have indicated that autophagy activation offer
neuroprotective effects by IPC [15, 16] and RIPost [17]
treatment. However, Gao et al. [18] reported that inhibition
of autophagy could induce neuroprotection in ischemic
postconditioning treatment. And little is known about the
involvement of autophagy in RIPer.
Autophagy is a highly regulated process by numerous
molecules, in which LC3 (the microtubule-associated
protein 1A light chain 3) is an important biomarker for
detection of autophagosomes. The formation of autophagosome involves the conversion of LC3 from LC3I to
LC3II, and the increase of LC3II/LC3I ratio can be used as
a hallmark of up-regulated autophagy [19]. Another critical
molecule, Beclin 1, a component of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, has a key role in the early
stage of formation autophagosomal membranes. Subsequently autophagosome fuses with lysosomes where their
contents are degraded by lots of lysosomal enzymes, in
which cathepsin B is an important participant [20].
In the present study, we tested whether RIPer, which was
induced by limb noninvasive ischemia conditioning, could
reduce cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury in rats, and
clarify the role of autophagy in neuroprotection of RIPer.

Methods
Animal Preparation and Administration
All studies were carried out in accordance with the National
Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (NIH Publications No. 80-23) revised 1996.
Experimental protocols used for animals were evaluated and
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of General Hospital of Shenyang Military Command.
Male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 280–320 g were used.
They were maintained on a standard diet and water ad libitum, and kept in a temperature-controlled environment with
alternating 12 h light and dark cycles.
Rats were randomly assigned into seven experimental
groups. Sham group (n = 24); rats were subjected to same

2069

surgery procedures except for the middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO). I–R group (n = 30); rats were subjected
to MCAO for 120 min and reperfusion 3 h and 24 h, respectively. I–R ? Rap (n = 18) group; rats were treated with
intracerebral ventricle injection rapamycin (35 pmol; Sigma,
MO, USA) before the onset of ischemia to determine the
contribution of autophagy inducer in ischemia. I–R ? Vehicle
group (n = 18); rats was received intracerebral ventricle
injection same volume of vehicle as control. RIPer group
(n = 30); rats were subjected to MCAO for 120 min, but at the
beginning of 10 min after MCAO given perconditioning and
reperfusion 3 h and 24 h, respectively. RIPer ? 3-MA group
(n = 24); rats were treated with intracerebral ventricle injection 3-methyladenine (3-MA, 400 nmol; Sigma, MO, USA)
before the onset of RIPer to determine the contribution of
autophagy in RIPer treatment. RIPer ? Vehicle group
(n = 24); rats also was received intracerebral ventricle injection same volume of vehicle as control. 3-MA was dissolved in
normal saline by heating solution to 60–70 °C immediately
before injection. Rapamycin was first dissolved in ethanol and
then diluted to the final concentration with normal saline (the
final ethanol concentration\2 %).
Focal Cerebral Ischemia Model
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced using an intraluminal
filament technique [21]. Briefly, Rats were anesthetized with
intraperitoneal injection of 10 % chloral hydrate (0.35 ml/
100 g). Via a midline neck incision, the right common carotid artery and the external carotid artery (ECA) were
exposed. A diameter of 0.32 mm fishing line with its tip
rounded by heating near a flame was inserted into the right
the ECA stump and gently advanced into the internal carotid
artery to occlude the origin of MCA, nearly 17–19 mm from
the carotid bifurcation. After 120 min of occlusion, the
suture was gently removed to allow reperfusion.
Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was analyzed by laser-Doppler flowmetry recordings. Rats in which ipsilateral blood
flow was not reduced to \20 % of the baseline after placement of the intraluminal filament and whose CBF signal was
not rapidly restored during reperfusion were excluded from
subsequent experiments. Cranial temperature was monitored
with a rectal probe and maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C with a
surface heating pad and lamps during and after surgery until
the recovery from anesthesia. About 20–30 % of rats died
24 h after ischemia onset were excluded for further analysis.
Remote Ischemia Perconditioning
In the RIPer group and RIPer ? inhibitor group, RIPer was
carried out four cycles of 10 min ischemia and 10 min
reperfusion, with a thin elastic band tourniquet encircled on
the bilateral femoral arteries at the start of 10 min after

123

2070

MCAO. Limb ischemia was confirmed by a change in the
color of the skin and a decrease in under-skin limb temperature. Following limb reperfusion, the skin color
returned to pink and the skin temperature to baseline.
Neurological Deficit Score
We assessed post-ischemic neurological deficits using motor
and sensory behavioral tests with minor modifications as
described [22]. Six rats in each group survived for 7 days after
reperfusion. Behavioral tests were conducted 1 day before
surgery and continued at 1, 2, 3 and 7 days after surgery by a
blind and experienced observer. The following six tests were
performed respectively: spontaneous activity, symmetry of
movements, and forepaw outstretching climbing ability, body
proprioception, and sensory function. After adding all individual scores of all tests, the minimum neurobehavioral score
is three that represents the rats have serious nerve function
injury and the maximum is 18 that represents the rat is normal.
Infarct Volume Measurement
At 24 h after reperfusion, six rats from each group were
randomly killed by staff blinded with an overdose of
chloral hydrate. Brains were quickly removed, and were
cut into 2 mm thick coronal sections, and stained in 1 %
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma, MO,
USA) at 37 °C for 30 min and then fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 24 h. The area stained white represents the
infarction area, red was normal area. The infarct volume was
calculated by summing infarction areas of all sections and
multiplying by slice thickness. To correct edema volume
effect, the exact infarct volumes were calculated using the
following equation: percentage of corrected infarct volume = (normal hemisphere volume - non-infarct volume
of infarct side)/normal hemispheric volume 9 100 %. After
brain extraction, animals observed to have experienced a
subarachnoid hemorrhage were excluded from the study.
Brain Water Content
After the wet weight of the brain tissues was quantified, the red
and white parts of these brains were desiccated at 105 °C for
48 h until the weight was constant. The total weight of the
dried TTC-stained brains was obtained by measuring the
desiccated red and white parts of these brains together, and the
water content of each brain was measured as follow: (wet
weight - dried weight)/wet weight 9 100 % [23].
Nissl Staining and Neuron Counts
At 24 h after reperfusion, rats under anesthesia were perfused with physiological saline and 4 % paraformaldehyde

123

Neurochem Res (2014) 39:2068–2077

in 0.1 mol/L phosphate-buffered saline from the heart into
aorta. Brains were removed quickly and fixed in 4 %
paraformaldehyde for 24 h. Then, a brain slice 4 mm
behind the optic chiasma was coronally excised and
embedded in paraffin wax. Embedded brain tissues were
sectioned (8 lm thick) and Nissl stained. The number of
morphologically normal (surviving) neurons in the cortex/mm2
and the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1)/mm was quantified using
Image Pro plus 6.0 by an investigator who was blind to the
experimental condition.
TUNEL Assay
For TUNEL assay, tissue sections were treated according to
the In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Boster, Wuhan, China).
In brief, sections were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with
proteinase K. Sections were respectively incubated in
TUNEL reaction mixture which contained TdT and DIGdUTP for 3 h at 37 °C, anti-DIG-dUTP for 2 h at 37 °C and
SABC-FITC ? POD for 30 min at 37 °C. For negative
control, sections were incubated without TdT. The slides
were incubated with 4,6,diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)containing medium. TUNEL staining was detected under a
fluorescence microscope (Nikon 50i) and the TUNEL
positive cells per mm2 in penumbra regions were counted in
10 non-overlapping high-power field (magnification 2009).
Immunohistochemistry Analysis
Immunohistochemistry was carried out at 3 and 24 h of
reperfusion in I–R group and RIPer group. Sections were
deparaffinized and rehydrated in graded concentration of
ethanol to distilled water. Endogenous peroxidase activity
was blocked with 3 % H2O2 for 10 min followed by a brief
rinse in distilled water and a 15 min wash in PBS. Sections
were placed in 10 mmol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0), and
repaired high pressure 3 min. Sections were naturally
cooled to room temperature and rinsed in PBS. Nonspecific
protein binding was blocked by 30 min incubation in goat
blocking serum. Sections were incubated with mouse antiLC3II (1:200; Sigma, MO, USA), cathepsin B (1:200;
Abcam, MA, USA) for overnight at 4 °C temperature.
Sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. DAB was
used as chromogen and counterstaining was done with
haematoxylin. Sections incubated in the absence of primary
antibody were used as negative controls. For quantification
of immunostaining of positive cells, ten microscopic field
(magnification 2009) in each section across ischemic
cortical penumbra regions were analyzed. The number of
LC3II and cathepsin B positive cells per mm2 in penumbra
regions was counted by an examiner who was blinded to
the experimental conditions.

Western Blot Analysis
At 24 h after reperfusion in each group, deeply anesthetized rats (n = 6) were perfused with normal saline. Brains
were removed, and tissues from the ischemic penumbra
cortex of the right MCA territory (parietal cortex) and the
corresponding area of sham-operated rats were dissected
rapidly and were frozen in liquid nitrogen at -80 °C. The
tissue was homogenized with RIPA lysis buffer, and then
centrifuged at 12,000 r/min for 10 min at 4 °C. The total
protein concentration of the supernatant was determined
using bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Abcam, MA,
USA). Took protein sample to subject to electrophoresis on
10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto a
nitrocellulose membrane, which was then blocked with
5 % nonfat milk in Tris buffered saline with 0.1 % Tween
20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature. Afterwards, the
membranes were incubated with antibodies against LC3
(1:400; Sigma, MO, USA), Beclin1 (1:400; Abcam, MA,
USA), cathepsin B (1:500; Abcam, MA, USA), Bcl-2
(1:500; Abcam, MA, USA), and Bad (1:500; Abcam, MA,
USA) at 4 °C overnight. After complete washing with
TBS-T, the membrane was incubated with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG for
1 h at room temperature. An anti-rat b-actin antibody
(1:1,000; Abcam, MA, USA) was used as an internal
control. The antigen–antibody complexes were observed
using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system
(ECL; Trans, Beijing, China). The amount of detected
protein was quantified by Scion Image 4.03 software
(Scion). Autophagosome formation involves the conversion of LC3 from LC3I to LC3II and the increase in the
LC3II/LC3I ratio can be used as a hallmark of up-regulated
autophagy [19]. Other protein was normalized for differences in loading based on the intensities of b-actin.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 17.0),
expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD). The neurologic deficit scores among different groups were compared by Kruskal–Wallis test. Other data were compared
by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the
Newman–Keuls method. Significant differences were
accepted when a value of P \ 0.05.

measured at different time points (Fig. 1). CBF of RIPer
had a slight fluctuation compared with I–R group. But
there were no statistical significance among different time
points. Variation tendency of CBF in I–R ? Rap and
I–R ? Vehicle was similar with that of I–R. And variation
tendency of CBF in RIPer ? 3-MA and RIPer ? Vehicle
was similar with that of RIPer. So only I–R group and
RIPer group was shown in the figure in order to avoid the
curve overlap. Comparisons of CBF revealed no significant
difference between the two groups.
RIPer Played a Neuroprotective Role in Cerebral I–R
Rats
To clarify the effects of RIPer in I–R rats, the infarct volume
were compared among different groups. As data shown,
RIPer group (28.7 ± 3.7 %) significantly reduced infarct
volume compared with the I–R group (49.6 ± 5.8 %;
Fig. 2a, b). The degree of brain edema (Fig. 2c) and the
neurologic deficit (Fig. 2d) were also decreased in RIPer
group compared with I–R group (P \ 0.05). And I–R injury
caused neuron loss both in cortex (Fig. 3a, c) and CA1
(Fig. 3b, d), which was also inhibited by RIPer treatment
(P \ 0.05). Similarly, RIPer markedly reduced the apoptosis
in the penumbra region at 24 h after reperfusion. The
number of TUNEL-positive neurons in penumbra of the
RIPer group was significantly less than that in I–R group
(P \ 0.05; Fig. 4b). But, the TUNEL positive cells cannot
be detected in CA1 area. In the RIPer group, Pro-apoptotic
protein Bad was markedly decreased (0.66 ± 0.13) and the
anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was significantly increased
(1.27 ± 0.16) by western blot analysis compared with I–R
group (1.45 ± 0.09, 0.46 ± 0.18, P \ 0.05; Fig. 4c).

results of immunohistochemistry (Fig. 5d–h). The expression of LC3II, Beclin1 (autophagosome biomarker of early
stage formation) and cathepsin B in RIPer group significantly increased compared with I–R group after 24 h
reperfusion, which indicated autophagy was activated
induced by RIPer (P \ 0.05; Fig. 5d–h).

To assess the activation of autophagy-lysosome after I–R
injury and RIPer treatment, immunohistochemistry staining
for autophagosome biomarkers-LC3II and the lysosomeassociated protein cathepsin B was performed in 3 h and
24 h reperfusion. LC3II and cathepsin B immunoreactivity
was mainly present in the neurons (Fig. 5a). There were a
few LC3II or cathepsin B positive cells in sham group.
While in I–R and RIPer group, the positive cells of LC3II
or cathepsin B were significantly increased after 3 h
reperfusion compared with the sham group (P \ 0.05;
Fig. 5b, c). However, the expression of LC3II or cathepsin
B in RIPer group was significantly stronger than that in I–R
group in 24 h reperfusion (P \ 0.05; Fig. 5b, c).
Quantitative analysis by Western blot showed that the
expressions of LC3II and cathepsin B were consistent with

Activation Autophagy Reduced the Cerebral I–R Injury
To detect the role of activated autophagy induced by RIPer
after cerebral I–R injury, we used autophagy inhibitor 3-MA
pretreatment to examine the correlation between the
autophagy and RIPer. The data showed 3-MA partially
reversed the protective effects of RIPer. Infarct volume
significantly increased after 3-MA treatment (46.5 ± 3.5 %)
compared with RIPer ? Vehicle group (30.1 ± 5.4 %,
P \ 0.05; Fig. 2b). Similarly, 3-MA could significantly

diminished the improvements of brain edema and the neurological deficit induced by RIPer (P \ 0.05; Fig. 2c, d).
Moreover, 3-MA pretreatment induced more seriously the
morphological damage in cortex and CA1 compared with
vehicle group and mitigated the number of surviving neurons by 43 and 65 %, respectively (Fig. 3c, d). The number
of TUNEL-positive neurons in the penumbra increased, and
the expression of apoptosis-related protein were detected, Bad
was increased (1.23 ± 0.16) and Bcl-2 was decreased
(0.57 ± 0.15) after 3-MA administration, compared with
RIPer ? Vehicle group (0.68 ± 0.15, 1.19 ± 0.12, P \ 0.05,
Fig. 4b, c). Compared with RIPer ? Vehicle group, 3-MA
significantly inhibited the protein expression of LC3II, Beclin1
and cathepsin B (P \ 0.05; Fig. 5d–h).
On the other hand, if the neuroprotective effect of RIPer
was involved in autophagy activation, then autophagy
inducer rapamycin could mimic neuroprotective effects
induced by RIPer. The data of rapamycin pretreatment
group showed that the values of the infarction volume were
significantly lower than that of vehicle pretreatment and

mitigated infarction by 41 % (Fig. 2a, b). The degree of
brain edema and the neurologic deficit were improved in
the rapamycin pretreatment group compared with the
vehicle pretreatment group (P \ 0.05; Fig. 2c, d). Bad
was decreased and Bcl-2 was increased by western blot
analysis compared with I–R ? Vehicle group (P \ 0.05;
Fig. 6a–c), which suggest rapamycin could decrease
apoptosis. Similarly, rapamycin significantly up-regulated
the protein levels of LC3II, Beclin1 and cathepsin B
(P \ 0.05; Fig. 6d–h) compared with I–R group.

Discussion
The present study demonstrated that RIPer conducted by
limb noninvasive ischemia conditioning following I–R significantly reduced brain infarct size in model of cerebral
ischemia, which was consistent with Hahn’s research [7].
Further, we expanded to research the pathological feature
and the mechanism of neuroprotection after RIPer by

determination of brain edema, apoptosis detection, morphological and biochemical analysis, and provided the further evidences of neuroprotective effect induced by RIPer.
Our data showed that RIPer did not improve the CBF
after MCAO compared with the I–R group. However,

Hoda’s research [24] showed RIPer therapy alone or in
combination with IV tPA treatment improved the CBF. The
diverging findings may be explained by the different of
ischemia models, RIPer intervention methods and the
species of animals.

Surviving neurons was determined by Nissl staining in
ischemic penumbra region and CA1 at 24 h after reperfusion, RIPer could significantly increase the number of
surviving neurons. In TUNEL detection, RIPer could significantly decrease the number of TUNEL positive cell in
ischemia cortex penumbra. But in hippocampus CA1,
TUNEL positive cells can not be detected at 24 h after
reperfusion. It has been reported no nuclear change
occurred in CA1 pyramidal neurons until 48 h after
ischemic insult [25], which may be due to cell programmed
death that was regulated by a specific mechanism [26].

Another meaningful results showed that, at 3 h after
reperfusion, the expression of LC3-II and cathepsin B were
both significantly upregulated in I–R and RIPer group, and
there were no significant difference between the two
groups. However, at 24 h after reperfusion, the upregulation of LC3-II and cathepsin B were dectectd only in the
RIPer group, but not in the I–R group, Which suggested
that, in early stage of cerebral ischemia, autophagy could
be activated by both RIPer and ischemia itself. But with
time, ischemic could not continuously activate autophagy,
which could be remedied by RIPer. Then, to determine the

sustained activation of autophagy is beneficial or detrimental, the inhibitor of autophagy, 3-MA, could partially
reversed the neuroprotective effects induced by RIPer at
24 h after reperfusion. These results suggested that activation of autophagy was involved in the neuroprotection
induced by RIPer.
If autophagy activation plays a role in the RIPer’s
neuroprotection, autophagy activators would mimic the
neuroprotective effects of RIPer. The results by the
autophagy inducer rapamycin pretreatment showed that the
activation of autophagy by RIPer ameliorated the brain
ischemic injury which was similar to the effects of rapamycin. It has been reported that rapamycin provided neuroprotection against neonatal brain ischemia and this effect
was mediated by the concomitant activation of autophagy
[27], which implied that rapamycin may be used for
reducing damage of I–R injury and provide novel strategies
for clinical prevention or treatment of ischemic stroke. But
compared with RIPer, the use of rapamycin has some
limitations such as side effect of rapamycin as immunosuppressive agents [28], the dosage of rapamycin and the

123

time of administration, etc. A randomized controlled trial
reported that the perconditioning stimulus which was
operated by ambulance personnel using a blood pressure
cuff during transportation to hospital for emergency coronary angioplasty resulted in a significant reduction in final
infarct size in patients with anterior myocardial infarcts
compared with controls [29]. These results suggest RIPer
possesses important clinical value.
RIPer-induced activation of autophagy may be due to an
increase in autophagosome formation. Autophagosome
formation as a cellular repair and anti-injury process after
cerebral ischemia plays a key role in neuronal survival
[27]. One study demonstrate that loss of autophagy in the
central nervous system causes neurodegeneration in mice,
the neurons require basal levels of autophagy for the
maintenance of health and function [14]. The activation of
autophagic pathways represents a potential protective
mechanism in the early stages of brain injury.
Our present studies demonstrate that RIPer plays the
neuroprotection role in cerebral I–R injury. The neuroprotective effect of RIPer is associated with the activation

of autophagy/lysosomal pathway. In conclusion, RIPer
following cerebral I–R is promising treatment and warrant
more research.
