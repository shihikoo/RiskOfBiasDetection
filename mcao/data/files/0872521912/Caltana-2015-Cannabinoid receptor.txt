Abstract
Brain ischemia produces neuronal cell death and the recruitment of pro-inﬂammatory cells. In turn, the search for
neuroprotection against this type of insult has rendered results
involving a beneﬁcial role of endocannabinoid receptor agonists in the Central Nervous System. In this work, to further
elucidate the mechanisms associated to this neuroprotective
effect, focal brain ischemia was generated by middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAo) in C57Bl/6 mice. Three, 24 and 48 h
after MCAo, animals received CB1R agonist ACEA (1 mg/kg),
CB1R antagonist AM251 (1 mg/kg) or vehicle. To assess
motor activity, neural deﬁcit scores and motor tests were
performed 1 day before and 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after

MCAo. At 7 and 28 days post lesion, cytoskeleton structure,
astroglial and microglial reaction, and alterations in synapsis
were studied in the cerebral cortex. ACEA treatment reduced
astrocytic reaction, neuronal death, and dendritic loss. In
contrast, AM251 treatment increased these parameters. Motor
tests showed a progressive deterioration in motor activity in
ischemic animals, which only ACEA treatment was able to
counteract. Our results suggest that CB1R may be involved in
neuronal survival and in the regulation of neuroprotection
during focal cerebral ischemia in mice.

Stroke ranks as the fourth cause of death and one of the
leading causes of long-term disability (American Heart
Association Statistics Committee and Stroke, 2014). It is
soon followed by inﬂammation, with microglia and mast
cells acting as early responders (Silver and Curley 2013),
whereas additional late-phase responses include reactive
astrocytosis and the resulting glial scar formation in the
boundary zone of the ischemic core, which plays a critical
role and may have beneﬁcial or detrimental effects
(Sofroniew and Vinters 2010).
The endocannabinoid system consists of lipid-based
mediators, endocannabinoids (eCB), their target receptors,
associated synthesizing and metabolizing enzymes and
transporter proteins. Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R)
is expressed in neurons and glial cells in many brain regions,
where it plays neuromodulatory roles in brain function
(Sanchez-Blazquez et al. 2014), whereas Cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2R) is mainly expressed by cells of the
immune system. eCB act as retrograde messengers and
regulate synaptic transmission through pre-synaptic CB1R.
They have also been identiﬁed as triggers for short- and

long-term plasticity at synapses throughout the brain (Heifets
and Castillo 2009).
Cannabinoids (including eCB, phytocannabinoids, and
synthetic compounds) could reduce the effects of diverse
pathologies in liver, heart and also protect the brain against
hypoxia/ischemia (Pacher and Hasko 2008), although the
molecular mechanisms are still unclear. Evidence suggests
that eCB signaling can regulate excitotoxicity by reducing
glutamate release (Parmentier-Batteur et al. 2002).
In this context, the aim of this work was to evaluate eCB
potential effects in a mouse model of permanent middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) by analyzing motor

Fluoro-Jadeâ B staining procedure
Brain sections mounted onto gelatin-coated slides were stained with
Fluoro-Jadeâ B (Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA) (Balan et al.
2006).

Materials and methods
Animals
Adult male C57/Bl6 mice (25–32 g) obtained from the Animal Facility
at the National Center of Atomic Energy were used in this study. Sixty
mice were housed in a humidity- and temperature-controlled environment (12 h/12 h light/dark cycle), with free access to food and
water. Animal treatments were in accordance with CICUAL protocols
(Institutional Committee for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals,
School of Medicine, University of Buenos Aires).
Mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo)
Mice were deeply anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose of
ketamine/xylazine (100 lg/g 10 lg/g in 10 lL saline) and the MCA
was exposed and permanently occluded by electrocoagulation
(Wagner et al. 2011, modiﬁed for mice). Sham procedure was
performed as described above except for coagulation of the MCA.
Animal survival rate was 100%.
Cannabinoid agonist/antagonist treatment
Adult mice were randomly assigned to six groups (n = 10 in each
group) per recovery time (3, 24, and 48 h after surgical procedure)
and i.p. injected CB1R agonist ACEA (arachidonyl-2-chloroethylamide) 1 mg/kg (Garcıa-Arencibia et al. 2007) or CB1R antagonist
AM251 1 mg/kg (Price et al. 2009). Both drugs were ﬁrst dissolved
in dimethylsulfoxide and diluted in saline. The control groups were
injected the same volume of dimethylsulfoxide dissolved in saline
solution at the same time points.
Behavioral tests: motor activity
Neurological score
Neurological examinations were performed on Day 1 (D1) 3 h after
surgical procedure, D2–D4, D7, D14, D21, and D28 (Longa et al.
1989). The neurological ﬁndings were scored on a ﬁve-point scale:
0-no neurological deﬁcit, 1-failure to fully extend left forepaw, 2circling to the left, 3-falling to the left, 4-no spontaneous walking,
and a depressed level of consciousness.
Corner and cylinder tests
Motor activity tests were performed according previous studies, for
corner test details see Zhang et al. 2002 and for cylinder test Li
et al. 2004 and Schallert et al. 2000).
Morphological analysis
After 7- to 28-day recovery (D7 and D28), ﬁve animals in each
group were ﬁxed by intracardiac perfusion with 4% (w/v)
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.4, and
coronal sections of the brains were cut with a vibratome (25 lm).
Toluidine blue staining
Brain sections were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then
incubated in toluidine blue 0.5% (w/v) dissolved in sodium
carbonate 2.5% (w/v).

Immunohistochemical staining
Immunohistochemistry was performed with primary antibodies:
rabbit anti-glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 1 : 3000, Dako,
Carpinteria, CA, USA); mouse anti-synaptophysin (Syn, 1 : 1000;
Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA); mouse anti-microtubule-associated
protein type2 (MAP-2, 1 : 1000, Sigma); rabbit anti-CB1R (1 : 5000,
Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA); rabbit anti-vesicular
transporter glutamate (VGlut1, 1 : 2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA); rabbit anti-subunit 4 of a-amino-3-hydroxy-5methylisoxazole-4-propionate receptors (GluR4, 1 : 1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), mouse anti-SMI311 (PAN,
1 : 4000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). For immunoﬂuorescent
labeling, after incubation with primary antibodies, brain sections were
washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 4 h with
ﬂuorescent secondary antibodies anti-mouse, anti-guinea pig and antirabbit IgG conjugated with FITC or Texas Red (1 : 500, Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) (Caltana et al. 2009). Sections
were later counter-stained with Hoechst 33342 (2 lg/mL, Sigma).
Lectin staining
Brain sections were incubated for 48 h at 4°C with the biotinylated
lectin Lycopersicon esculentum lectin (6 lg/mL, Sigma) (for details,
see Caltana et al. 2009).
Ultrastructural analysis
A set of 12 animals (2 per group) was ﬁxed by intracardiac perfusion
with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.25% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in
PB at D7, and tissue was then processed for electron microscopy.
Images were acquired on a Zeiss 109 transmission electron
microscope (TEM) (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and photographed with a GATAN CCD camera (Pleasanton, CA, USA). For
TEM images, the synapse number per 100 lm2 was measured.
Morphometric digital image analysis
Images were acquired on an Axiolab epiﬂuorescence microscope
(Carl Zeiss) equipped with a Q-Color3 CCD camera (Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan). Counting and morphometry were performed using
Image Pro PLUS 4.5 (Media Cybernetics, Warrendale, PA, USA)
and Image J (NIH, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) software.
The brain area analyzed was the primary motor cortex (M1/M2)
(Franklin and Paxinos 2007). In each coronal section, each
microscopic ﬁeld was selected within the limits of the penumbra
ischemic area and morphometrically analyzed. The intensity of Syn,
VGlut1, and Glur4 immunoreactivity (ir) was evaluated by means of
a relative optical density (ROD) value as previously described
(Evrard et al. 2006). Color images were randomly acquired and then
transferred to black and white images (Jung et al. 2009).
Lectin+ and Fluorojade B+ cells were quantiﬁed. For astrocyte
GFAP-ir, the cell area was evaluated by interactively determining
each cell limit. To evaluate CB1R-ir, MAP-2-ir, and PAN ﬁbers, the
total area of the immunolabeled ﬁbers was related to the total area of
the corresponding microscopic ﬁeld (209 primary magniﬁcation),
rendering a relative area parameter.

At D0, none of the groups showed behavioral asymmetries
in the corner test (similar number of turns toward either side).
Control and MCAo-ACEA groups maintained the same
tendency during the experimental period, whereas the other
MCAo groups showed a signiﬁcant increase in right turns
compared with Control-Saline. MCAo-Saline and MCAoAM251 showed an elevated number of right turns until D28
(Fig. 1b).
Meanwhile, in the cylinder test, all groups showed similar
scores at D0 and Control groups did not show differences
after surgery. After MCAo, the MCAo-Saline and MCAoAM251 groups showed a signiﬁcant increase in cylinder test
scores, reﬂecting asymmetrical behavior. The MCAo-ACEA
group did not show differences with Control-Saline
(Fig. 1c).

Statistical analysis
Reported values represent the mean  SEM of experiments
performed for each marker. Differences among the means of the
six groups were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s test (for morphological
analysis) or Dunnet’s test (for motor activity tests), p < 0.05, using
GraphPad Prism v5.00 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San
Diego, CA, USA). To simplify graphic presentation, values of the
different groups are expressed as percentages of the sham-operated
saline-treated group (Control-Saline) (value = 100%).

Results
CB1R agonist ACEA facilitated motor activity recovery
During the ﬁrst 4 days after MCAo, ischemic mice exhibited
signiﬁcantly elevated neurological deﬁcit scores compared to
the control groups. From D7 to D28, MCAo-Saline and
MCAo-AM251 groups showed an elevated score, which
persisted until D21 and D28. The MCAo-ACEA group
showed a reduction in neurological deﬁcit scores since D5
(Fig. 1a). All experimental groups were evaluated prior to
MCAo in the corner and cylinder tests to assess basal
parameters.

CB1R agonist ACEA reduced infarct area size and neuronal
degeneration
Brain sections were stained with toluidine blue to measure
lesion size. Control groups did not show any evidence of
lesion at D28 post surgery (data not shown). After MCAo,
MCAo-Saline showed a reduction in lesion size after ACEA
treatment and an increase with AM251 administration
(Fig. 2).
To determine whether the improvement in motor activity
and the reduction in infarct size were related with decreased
neuronal damage, Fluoro-Jade B was used to stain cell
bodies, dendrites, axons, and axon terminals of degenerating
neurons and Fluoro-Jade B+ cells were analyzed in the
penumbra cortex, surrounding the ischemic core. At D7,
there were no Fluoro-Jade B+ cells in the control groups (data
not shown) but, in the MCAo groups (Fig. 3a), the number
of Fluoro-Jade B+ neurons in the cortex was signiﬁcantly
higher in the Saline- and AM251-treated animals than in
ACEA-treated ones, which shows the protective effects of
CB1R stimulation against neuronal degeneration after
ischemic insult (Fig. 3b).
CB1R agonist ACEA reduced astroglial reaction after MCAo
Astrocytic reaction was evaluated by measuring the area
occupied by GFAP+ astrocytes. No changes were observed
in the cerebral cortex in astrocytic cell area, astrocytic
shape or their organization pattern in any of the control
groups. Astrocyte cell area increased after MCAo at D7
and D28 and did not change in the AM251-treated group
(Fig. 4a). Treatment with ACEA induced a reduction in
astroglial reaction. Indeed, astrocytes showed normal shape
with thinner and shorter projections at D7 and D28 as
compared to MCAo-Saline and MCAo-AM251 (Fig. 4b
and c).
CB1R agonist ACEA reduced microglial response after MCAo
The level of microglial activation was assessed by determining the number of lectin+ cells with stellate and ameboid

shape. There were no differences across Control groups in
the number of lectin+ cells (stellate or ameboid) and
microglial cells were typically ramiﬁed with multiple
branches (Fig. 5a). A robust microglial response was
observed after MCAo because of a signiﬁcant increase in
the number of lectin+ cells (Fig. 5b and c). Moreover,
changes were detected in cell shape (becoming ameboid and
round). The ACEA-treated group presented lower microglial
activation compared with Saline- or AM251- treated groups
in relation with the number of stellate and ameboide lectin+
cells at D7 (Fig. 5b) and ameboid lectin+ cells at D28
(Fig. 5c).

CB1R stimulation modified the effects of ischemia on
neuronal cytoskeleton
MAP2 is a microtubule-associated protein present in
neuronal dendritic processes, commonly used to analyze
the dendritic tree and its extension. MCAo produced a
signiﬁcant reduction in the relative area covered by the
MAP2-ir dendrites (Fig. 6), which recovered with ACEA
treatment at D7 and D28. The MCAo-ACEA group
displayed an increase in the area covered by MAP2-ir
dendrites, mainly because of enhanced length, branching,
and thickness; the area covered by MAP2+ ﬁbers did not
show different values to those observed in the control

groups. The dendrite area obtained in MCAo groups treated
with Saline or AM251 did not present differences (Fig. 6b
and c).
PAN immunostaining was used to label total neuroﬁlaments, the main determinant factor in axonal diameter. At
D28, the area covered by PAN+ ﬁbers in control groups
showed thin and regular PAN-immunostained ﬁbers (Fig. 7a
and 7b). MCAo groups treated with Saline or AM251
showed changes in the morphology of PAN+ ﬁbers – thicker,
irregular and wavy (Fig. 7b) – and a decrease in the tissue
area covered by these PAN+ ﬁbers. The MCAo-ACEA group
showed no changes in PAN+ ﬁber pattern, presenting features
similar to the control, but with an increase in the area covered
(Fig. 7b).

623

CB1R agonist ACEA modified CB1R expression after MCAo
The expression of CB1R was assessed by measuring the area
covered by CB1R-ir ﬁbers. In control groups, no changes in
CB1R expression were observed. After MCAo, ACEA
treatment increased CB1R expression, whereas the MCAoAM251 group showed a decrease in this parameter (Fig. 8a
and b).
MCAo produced changes at synaptic level
Electron microscopy was used to assess the number of
synapses, calculated per 100 lm2 in the penumbra. MCAo
reduced the number of synapses, probably because of
neuronal death and tissue damage. After ACEA treatment, the number of synapses increased compared to

Control, MCAo-Saline and MCAo-AM251 groups (Fig. 9a
and b).
For Syn, Vglut1, and GluR4 ROD measurements, color
images were acquired randomly in the cerebral cortex and
then transferred to black and white images. The data were
transformed to percentages, considering Control-Saline
groups as 100%.
Syn is a speciﬁc marker for pre-synaptic boutons and is also
considered a marker for synaptogenesis. Exposure to CB1R
agonists or antagonists did not produce signiﬁcant changes in
Syn ROD in control groups; after MCAo, Syn ROD increased
only in the MCAo-Saline group, whereas MCAo-ACEA and
MCAo-AM251 showed no differences with respect to the
Control-Saline group (Fig. 10a and b), which suggests that
CB1R stimulation reduces synaptogenesis.
Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS and it is packaged in vesicles for later release
during synaptic transmission. These vesicles contain Vglut1,
which is expressed in the adult brain. It has been proposed
that Vglut1 levels are critical to the balance between
excitatory and inhibitory transmission (Todd et al. 2003).
The expression of Vglut1 increased in MCAo-Saline and
MCAo-AM251 groups with respect to the control group, but
decreased in the MCAo-ACEA group (Fig. 10a and c),
changes which could be related to modiﬁcations in the
synthesis or release of glutamate.

The a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate
receptors are ionotropic glutamate transmembrane receptors
formed by four types of subunits (GluR1, GluR2, GluR3, and
GluR4) which mediate rapid synaptic transmission in the
CNS (Mayer 2011). The expression of ionotropic glutamate
receptor type 4 was analyzed and no changes were observed
in GluR4 ROD, either in Control or MCAo groups (Fig. 10a
and d).

Discussion
The eCB signaling system, integrated by its ligands,
membrane receptors and regulatory proteins, has been
described as a potential therapeutic target for obesity, drug
abuse, pain, and stroke. Moreover, cannabinoid agonists
have become potentially attractive neuroprotective agents in
medical research.
CB1 agonists, like WIN-55212-2, ACEA, HU210, THC,
and AM404, have presented potential neuroprotective effects
(Docagne et al. 2007; Garcıa-Arencibia et al. 2007; Zani
et al. 2007) and are useful in the treatment of neuronal
disorders, acting through the inhibition of excitotoxicity, cell
death, inﬂammation, and oxidative stress (Vendel and de
Lange 2014). In particular, ACEA is a cannabinoid agonist
with neuroprotective properties in different animal models of
CNS injury (Bahremand et al. 2009). In this context, this

ﬁbers at D7. Signiﬁcance between treatments after one-way

study was designed to further ascertain the neuroprotective
properties of this CB1 agonist following ischemic stroke in a
model of MCAo in mice. The treatment scheme was
designed to avoid undesirable effects and the doses used
were lower than those producing psychotropic effects.
We show here that ACEA protected brain regions affected
by ischemia and ameliorated the deterioration of motor
activity after MCAo, reducing asymmetric motor alterations
and spontaneous activity. ACEA also reduced neuronal
degeneration and death, dendrite loss, and microglial reaction. These ﬁndings are in agreement with previous reports
where a variable level of neuroprotection was induced by CB
agonists (Mauler et al. 2003; Youssef et al. 2007).
We also show important changes in the neuronal
cytoskeleton following MCAo. We found a decrease in
the relative area covered by neuronal processes in the
cerebral cortex, probably indicating a reorganization of the
cytoskeletal structure related with neuronal suffering.
MAP2-immunostained dendrites from the cortical area
(M1/M2) were thicker and presented an irregular structure,
whereas the MAP2+ relative area was reduced. After
ACEA treatment, this relative area increased to reach
control levels, probably reﬂecting an increased dendrite

thickness and/or increased branching, characteristic of
sprouting phenomena. CB1R antagonist AM251 did not
produce alterations in the Control groups, whereas the
MCAo group showed a decrease in dendritic arborization
after ischemic insult which had not recovered by D28.
Results obtained in PAN immunostaining showed that
MCAo induced a decrease in the area covered by
neuroﬁlaments, a parameter which recovered after ACEA
treatment.
Neuronal differentiation, synapse formation and the
preservation of tissue microenvironment in nervous tissue
are regulated by astrocytes (Wang and Bordey 2008).
Reactive astrogliosis consists of morphological changes
including an increase in cell size with thicker and longer
cellular processes related with alterations in cytoskeletal
proteins, speciﬁcally GFAP. In our studies, MCAo was
observed to produce astrocytic reaction at D7, characterized
by an increase in the number of astrocytes and cell area in
cortex which persisted at D28, but was reversed by ACEA
treatment.
Cerebral ischemia induces an inﬂammatory reaction with
activation of astrocytes and microglial cells. Damaged tissue
releases different cytokines and neurotransmitters and acts on

the immune system to recruit peripheral leukocytes through
systemic circulation (Macrez et al. 2011). MCAo produced a
robust inﬂammatory reaction, mainly because of an increase
in stellate microglial cells at D7 and with the predominance
of ameboid and round lectin+ microglial cells at D28.
Treatment with ACEA decreased the number of microglial
cells with stellate and ameboid morphology, whereas AM251
did not modify the inﬂammatory reaction produced by
ischemia.
The neuronal degeneration, astroglial reaction and inﬂammatory response triggered by MCAo, as well as the recovery
induced by treatment with CB1R selective agonist ACEA,
might correlate with CB1R expression at D7, which is
reduced in ischemic conditions – except for its selective

stimulation – and demonstrates the importance of neural
plasticity. CB1R has been implicated in synaptic plasticity
through the coupling of post-synaptic activation with
decreases in the release of pre-synaptic neurotransmitters
(Alger 2014) and may play an important role in the control of
neuronal circuits.
Degenerated neurons activate microglial cells, which
induce normal neurons to form new synapses. This neosynaptogenesis is induced by cytokines, such as tumor necrosis
factor-a, and neurotrophic factors released by activated
microglia. The process named ‘synaptic stripping’, in which
microglial cells remove pre-synaptic terminals from dendrites, allows neurons to survive and restores normal
neuronal function (Trapp et al. 2007).

Syn, expressed at the pre-synaptic terminal, constitutes a
speciﬁc marker of pre-synaptic boutons. An increase in Syn
immunoreactivity correlates with synaptogenesis, whereas its
quantiﬁcation is a useful tool in the estimation of synaptic
density (Jung et al. 2009). In this study, we observed
increased Syn immunoreactivity at D7 after MCAo, which
correlates with levels of microglial activation. Treatment with
ACEA reduced Syn immunoreactivity to normal levels, which
also correlates with a reduction in microglial activation. This
result is in agreement with previous studies indicating that
activated microglia could exert different effects inﬂuenced by
the microenvironment, thus generating beneﬁcial or harmful
impacts (Trapp et al. 2007). The reduction in neuronal
degeneration, glutamatergic pre-synaptic vesicles and microglial activation observed in the MCAo-ACEA group, as well
as the subsequent increase in the number of synapses
observed by TEM at D28, could explain how CB1R agonist
protects the injured area by reducing glutamate excitotoxicity
and inducing new synapse formation.

Conclusions
In summary, CB1R agonist ACEA improved motor activity
affected by MCAo. At histologic levels, ACEA preserved the
neuronal cytoarchitecture, decreased astroglial and microglial
reaction and increased synaptogenesis. Therefore, it is
possible to conclude that cannabinoid agonist ACEA exerts
its neuroprotective effects by acting on CB1R expression in
neurons.

Syn, expressed at the pre-synaptic terminal, constitutes a
speciﬁc marker of pre-synaptic boutons. An increase in Syn
immunoreactivity correlates with synaptogenesis, whereas its
quantiﬁcation is a useful tool in the estimation of synaptic
density (Jung et al. 2009). In this study, we observed
increased Syn immunoreactivity at D7 after MCAo, which
correlates with levels of microglial activation. Treatment with
ACEA reduced Syn immunoreactivity to normal levels, which
also correlates with a reduction in microglial activation. This
result is in agreement with previous studies indicating that
activated microglia could exert different effects inﬂuenced by
the microenvironment, thus generating beneﬁcial or harmful
impacts (Trapp et al. 2007). The reduction in neuronal
degeneration, glutamatergic pre-synaptic vesicles and microglial activation observed in the MCAo-ACEA group, as well
as the subsequent increase in the number of synapses
observed by TEM at D28, could explain how CB1R agonist
protects the injured area by reducing glutamate excitotoxicity
and inducing new synapse formation.

Conclusions
In summary, CB1R agonist ACEA improved motor activity
affected by MCAo. At histologic levels, ACEA preserved the
neuronal cytoarchitecture, decreased astroglial and microglial
