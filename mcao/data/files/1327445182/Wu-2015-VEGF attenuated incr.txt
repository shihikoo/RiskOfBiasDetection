INTRODUCTION

Abstract—We recently indicated that the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protects neurons against hypoxic
death via enhancement of tyrosine phosphorylation of
Kv1.2, an isoform of the delayed-rectiﬁer potassium channels through activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3-K) signaling pathway. The present study investigated
whether VEGF could attenuate ischemia-induced increase
of the potassium currents in the hippocampal pyramidal
neurons of rats after ischemic injury. Adult male Sprague–
Dawley rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) to induce brain ischemia. The
whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to record the
potassium currents of hippocampal neurons in brain slices
from the ischemically injured brains of the rats 24 h after
MCAO. We detected that transient MCAO caused a signiﬁcant increase of voltage-gated potassium currents (Kv)
and outward delayed-rectiﬁer potassium currents (IK), but
not outward transient potassium currents (IA), in the ipsilateral hippocampus compared with the sham. Moreover, we
found that VEGF could acutely, reversibly and voltage-dependently inhibit the ischemia-induced IK increase. This
inhibitory eﬀect of VEGF could be completely abolished by
wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3-K. Our data indicate that
VEGF attenuates the ischemia-induced increase of IK via

Voltage-gated potassium channels are crucial mediators
of neuronal excitability and its network function
(Hoﬀman et al., 1997; Liu et al., 2007). It has been
demonstrated that the activity of voltage-gated potassium
currents (Kv), especially outward delayed-rectiﬁer potassium currents (IK), is altered in the pathological process
of various neurological diseases, such as stroke (Wei
et al., 2003; Deng et al., 2011), Alzheimer’s disease
(Alonso et al., 2012) and seizures (Meier et al., 2014).
Further studies also indicate that abnormalities of Kv
and IK play pivotal roles in neuronal apoptosis after
ischemic injury (Bortner et al., 1997; Yu et al., 1997).
However, the administration of tetraethylammonium
(TEA), a potassium channel blocker, can protect hippocampal CA1 neurons against ischemic cell death
(Huang et al., 2001) and reduce brain infarct volume
induced by focal ischemia (Wei et al., 2003). Therefore,
the regulation of IK has been recognized as a potential
therapeutic approach to protect neurons against ischemic
injury.
Recent studies have shown that the neuroprotective
mechanisms of berberine (Wang et al., 2004), carvedilol
(Duan et al., 2010), humanin (Liu et al., 2014), and
brain-derived neurotropic factor (Cao et al., 2010;
Takeda et al., 2014) are also related to their inhibitory
eﬀects on IK. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
an angioneurin (Zacchigna et al., 2008), can increase
angiogenesis and neurogenesis in ischemically injured
brains (Greenberg and Jin, 2005; Sun and Guo, 2005).
Furthermore, we have found that VEGF protects neurons
against hypoxic and ischemic injury by up-regulating the
tyrosine phosphorylation of Kv1.2, an isoform of the
delayed-rectiﬁer potassium channels, through activation
of the PI3-K) signaling pathway (Qiu et al., 2003).
Additionally, VEGF can inhibit IK in the acute isolated hippocampal neurons of neonatal rats under physiological
conditions (Xu et al., 2003). Therefore, we asked whether

VEGF could modulate the activity of potassium channels
on the neuronal membrane of adult mammalian brains
after ischemic injury.
In the present study, we used the whole-cell patchclamp technique to observe the eﬀects of VEGF on the
potassium currents in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal
neurons of adult rats following a transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Furthermore, we
used a combination of electrophysiological recording
and pharmacological analysis to see if the eﬀects of
VEGF on the potassium currents were related to the
activation of the PI3-K signaling pathway.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Materials and animals
VEGF, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), tetrodotoxin (TTX),
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and guanosine-5’triphosphate (GTP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA). Wortmannin was purchased from
Merck Schuchardt (Haar, Germany). Other reagents in
AR grades were products of the Shanghai Chemical
Plant (China).
Male Sprague–Dawley (S.D.) rats weighing 220–
250 g (n = 51) were from the Experimental Animal
Center of the Shanghai Medical College, Fudan
University. The study was conducted in accordance with
the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals. The protocols were
approved by the Ethics Committees of Experimental
Research of the Shanghai Medical College of the Fudan
University (Permit Number: 20120302-128). All eﬀorts
were made to minimize animal suﬀering and reduce the
number of animals used.
MCAO
Rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate
(360 mg/kg, intraperitoneally [i.p.]). Rectal temperatures
were monitored and maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C using a
heating pad. Transient MCAO procedure was carried
out according to the method described previously
(Longa et al., 1989). In brief, a 4–0 nylon monoﬁlament
with a rounded tip was introduced into left external carotid
artery lumen and gently advanced into the internal carotid
artery until slight resistance was felt. The ﬁlament was left
in place for 30 min and then withdrawn. Sham-operated
controls were subject to the same surgery but without
advancement of the suture into the middle cerebral artery.

chamber. The slices were submerged and superfused
continuously with oxygenated ACSF at a ﬂow rate of 3–
4 ml/min. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells were
chosen for electrophysiological recording. Whole-cell
currents were recorded using electrodes pulled from
borosilicate glass capillaries on a puller (P-97, Sutter
Instrument Co., Novato, CA, USA). Patch electrodes
had an open-tip resistance of 6–10 MX when ﬁlled with
intracellular solution (mM): K gluconate 150,
MgSO47H2O 2, CaCl2 0.1, EGTA 1, K2ATP 2, Na3GTP
0.1, HEPES 10, pH was adjusted to 7.4 with KOH.
Currents were recorded under whole-cell voltage clamp
with an AXOPATCH 200 A patch-clamp ampliﬁer,
ﬁltered at 2 kHz, digitized at 5 kHz and stored on a PC
using a DigiData 1322A interface (Axon Instruments,
Foster City, CA, USA) and pCLAMP software (Version
6.0.4). After seal formation (>1 GX) and membrane
rupturing, the cells were allowed to stabilize for 3–5 min
before starting pulse protocols.
To record the potassium currents, TTX (1 lM) and
cadmium chloride (CdCl2, 0.3 mM) were added into the
solution to block the activity of sodium and calcium
channels respectively. Two types of voltage-gated
outward potassium currents known as IA and IK were
studied based on previously described protocols (Klee
et al., 1995; Liu et al., 2014). With the holding potential
at 60 mV, Kv were elicited by a series of 400-ms
depolarizing pulses from 80 mV to +70 mV in 10 mV
increments following a 300-ms hyperpolarizing prepulse
to –120 mV. IK was separated in the presence of 4-AP
1 mM. IA was isolated by subtracting current traces of IK
from Kv utilizing the signal subtraction procedure in
Origin 8.5 software. Current density of potassium currents
of hippocampal neurons was calculated by dividing the
amplitude of the peak current by the cell membrane
capacitance (Cm), which was represented as the ratio
of pA/pF. To observe the time course of changes in IK
amplitude, a 450-ms depolarizing pulse to +60 mV following a 150-ms hyperpolarizing prepulse to 110 mV
was delivered every 20 s, and the holding potential was
60 mV. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–24 °C).
VEGF (100 ng/ml) dissolved in bath solution was
locally applied to cells via DAD-12 superfusion system
(ALA Scientiﬁc Instruments Inc., New York, NY, USA).
Wortmannin (30 nM) was diluted directly in the ACSF,
and applied via the perfusion system for 180 s before
VEGF application.

Whole-cell recordings

Measurement of cerebral infarct volume

Brain slices were prepared from rats 24 h after ischemic
operation. Animals were anesthetized with 10% chloral
hydrate (360 mg/kg, i.p.). The brain was quickly
removed
and
immersed
in
ice-cold
artiﬁcial
cerebrospinal ﬂuid (ACSF) which included (in mM): NaCl
130; KCl 3; CaCl2 2; MgCl2 2; NaHPO4 1.25; NaHCO3
26; Glucose 10. Hippocampal slices (300 lm) were cut
using a VT1000S (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). The slices
were incubated in ACSF equilibrated with 95% O2, 5%
CO2 for 1 h at 37 °C before transferring to a recording

The animals were deeply anesthetized 24 h after the
ischemic operation. The brains were rapidly dissected
out and the forebrains were cut into ﬁve coronal sections
(2 mm thick). The sections were stained by incubating
them in a solution of 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) at 37 °C for 30 min. The crosssectional
areas with or without infarction in each brain slice were
measured using Image J 1.37 software (National
Institutes of Health). Brain infarct volume (%) was
presented according to the following equation: % Infarct

96

K. W. Wu et al. / Neuroscience 298 (2015) 94–101

volume = (white infarct area  thickness) / (whole slice
area  thickness)  100%.
Immunohistochemistry
The animals were deeply anesthetized and quickly
subjected to transcardial perfusion with freshly prepared
0.9% saline solution followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) in phosphate-buﬀered solution (0.1 M, pH 7.4,
PBS). Coronal sections of the brains were sectioned
with a freezing microtome (Jung Histocut, Model 820-II,
Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) at a thickness of 30 lm and
stored at 20 °C in cryoprotectant solution for further
histological analysis.
For double staining of NeuN and activated caspase-3,
free-ﬂoating sections were incubated with mouse
monoclonal anti-NeuN (1:500; Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA) and then incubated with anti-mouse IgG-FITC
secondary antibody (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA). After washing in PBS, sections
were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-activated
caspase-3 antibody (1:20; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and
then incubated with anti-rabbit IgG-rhodamine secondary
antibody (1:500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Fluorescent signals were detected using a confocal laser
scanning microscope (TCS SP5, Leica, Wetzlar,
Germany) at 535-nm excitation and 565-nm emission
(Rhodamine) or 488 and 525 nm (FITC), respectively.
Quantiﬁcation and statistical analysis
Positive cell counting was performed by an investigator,
who was unaware of the treatment conditions, using
Image J 1.37 software (National Institutes of Health).
For each rat, cells were counted in the linear part of the
CA1 ﬁeld from four nonoverlapping images (with a ﬁxed
thickness of 1.72 lm for confocal pictures) and
expressed as the average of positive cells per 1 mm of
CA1 length. The counting frame sizes were
395 lm  120 lm for immunoﬂuorescent analysis under
a 40  confocal microscope object lens.
All electrophysiological recording data were stored
and analyzed using Clampﬁt 10.2 (Axon Instruments,

Foster City, CA, USA) and ﬁgures were generated using
Origin 8.5 (MicroCal, Northampton, MA, USA). Stata,
version 12 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) was
applied for the statistical analyses. The signiﬁcance of
the diﬀerences among multiple groups was analyzed via
a one-way ANOVA followed by LSD. The signiﬁcance of
the diﬀerences between two groups was statistically
analyzed using unpaired Student’s t-test. All data were
represented as the mean ± S.E.M. and statistical
signiﬁcance was set at p < 0.05.

RESULTS
Focal brain ischemia changed membrane properties
of pyramidal neurons and increased activation of
caspase-3 in hippocampal CA1 region
To conﬁrm the reliability of the ischemic model, we
performed TTC staining. The results showed that a
large infarct area appeared in the cerebral cortex and
striatum of the left cerebral hemisphere of rats in the
MCAO group (5.16% ± 0.66%, n = 4), whereas no
infarct was observed in rats of the sham group
(Fig. 1A). Considering that transient MCAO did not
cause infarct in the hippocampus, we further tested
whether the present model could aﬀect the hippocampal
CA1 region; we performed double immunostaining for
NeuN and activated caspase-3 in brain sections of rats
24 h after MCAO. The results showed that NeuNpositive (NeuN+) neurons and activated caspase-3+
cells could be detected in the hippocampal CA1 region
of sham-operated rats (Fig. 1B). However, transient
MCAO may have signiﬁcantly increased the number of
activated
caspase-3+
cells
in
the
ipsilateral
hippocampal CA1 region although it did not change the
number of NeuN+ neurons compared with the shamoperation (Fig. 1C). We also noticed that some
hippocampal neurons showed apoptosis as indicated by
double labeling of NeuN and activated caspase-3
(Fig. 1B). This result suggested that transient MCAO
caused cell damage in the hippocampal CA1 region.
We then performed electrophysiological recording and
analyzed the membrane properties of pyramidal neurons

in fresh hippocampal slices from the rats 24 h after MCAO
or sham-operation. The neurons chosen for recording
displayed health morphology, including distinct neuronal
body and dendrite outlines, no swelling or shrinkage of
the cell body and dendritic fragmentation (Fig. 2A).
When whole-cell recording was formed, under a current
clamp, normal action potentials could be elicited by a
depolarizing current (Fig. 2B). Under such experimental
conditions, we recorded the membrane parameters of
hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. The results
showed that ischemia caused changes in the resting
membrane potential (RMP), Cm and spike width (SpkD),
but not in input resistance (Rin) and spike height (SpkH),
as shown in Table 1.

Focal brain ischemia increased voltage-gated
potassium currents and IK in the hippocampal
neurons
The Kv were elicited by a series of 400-ms depolarizing
pulses from 80 mV to +70 mV in 10-mV increments
following a 300-ms hyperpolarizing prepulse to –120 mV
with the holding potential at 60 mV (Fig. 2E). The
average of Kv current density was 40.18 ± 6.29 pA/pF
in the sham and 82.69 ± 10.79 pA/pF in the ipsilaterals
to the MCAO (measured at +70 mV, p < 0.01,
Fig. 2F), indicating that the Kv current density
signiﬁcantly increased in the hippocampal neurons of
brains after MCAO.

4-aminopyridine was added to external solution to abolish transient outward potassium currents (IA). IA (E) were isolated by subtracting current
traces of IK from Kv utilizing the signal subtraction procedure in Origin 8.5 software. The current density–voltage curves of Kv (F), IK (G) and IA (H)

The voltage-gated potassium currents consist of IK and
IA. To determine whether focal ischemia aﬀected either IA
or IK, we added 4-AP at a concentration of 1 mM into the
perfusion medium to block the fast transient components
of the potassium currents. We found that the IK
density of the ipsilateral hippocampal neurons
signiﬁcantly increased compared with the sham
(Fig. 2G). The average IK current density increased from
19.33 ± 4.73 pA/pF to 58.77 ± 8.77 pA/pF under
ischemic injury (measured at +70 mV, p < 0.01,
Fig. 2G). However, we observed that the current density
of IA was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between the sham
and the ischemia groups (Fig. 2H).

VEGF acutely and reversibly inhibited ischemiainduced increase of the IK in the hippocampal
neurons
To demonstrate whether VEGF could modulate the
increase of IK induced by ischemic injury, we
administered VEGF (100 ng/ml) locally to hippocampal
neurons in the brain slices. IK were elicited by a 450-ms
depolarizing pulse to +60 mV following a 150-ms
hyperpolarizing prepulse to 110 mV with the holding
potential at 60 mV (Fig. 3A). We found that VEGF
could reduce the current density of IK by 11.96 ± 0.96%
and 21.52 ± 1.70% at 60 s and 120 s after the
perfusion, respectively (Fig. 3). The maximal inhibition
of VEGF on the IK current density was 35.87 ± 2.84%.
Moreover, the current density of IK returned to
80.90 ± 2.32% of the control at 120 s after removing
VEGF perfusion (Fig. 3). These results reveal that
VEGF acutely and reversibly inhibited ischemia-induced
increase of neuronal IK in the hippocampal slices of the
rat brain after ischemic injury.
To study the eﬀects of VEGF on the current–voltage
response of IK, we recorded the current–voltage traces of
IK elicited by the protocol described previously (Fig. 2E)
in the presence or absence of VEGF (100 ng/ml). As

shown in Fig. 4, VEGF shifted the IK current density–
voltage curve downward. Moreover, this inhibitory eﬀect
of VEGF gradually increased as the membrane potential
increased from +10 mV to +70 mV. These results
suggest that VEGF voltage-dependently inhibited the
ischemia-induced increase of neuronal IK in the
hippocampus of the rat brain after MCAO.
Wortmannin blocked the inhibitory eﬀects of VEGF
on the ischemia-induced increase of the IK in the
hippocampal neurons
To determine whether VEGF inhibited ischemia-induced
increase of IK via the PI3-K pathway, we added
wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3-K, into the perfusion
medium at a concentration of 30 nM for 180 s before
VEGF application. We observed that pretreatment with
wortmannin signiﬁcantly reduced the inhibitory eﬀects of
VEGF on ischemia-induced increase of IK in the
hippocampal neurons as shown in Fig. 5. These results
clearly indicate the inhibitory eﬀects of VEGF on the
increase of the neuronal IK induced by ischemic injury
via activation of the PI3-K signaling pathway.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we used the whole-cell patch-clamp
technique to record the potassium currents of
hippocampal neurons in brain slices of rats after a
transient MCAO operation. We found that VEGF could
inhibit ischemia-induced increase of neuronal potassium
currents via activation of the PI3-K signaling pathway.
These results provide direct evidence of neurovascular
function coupling, which may be an important event for
neuronal repair in the brains following ischemic injury.
In the present study, we performed a transient MCAO
to induce focal brain ischemic injury. By TTC staining, we
found that MCAO caused the obvious infarct in the
cerebral cortex and striatum (Fig. 1A), indicating that
present ischemic model induced direct severe injury to
both the cerebral cortex and the striatum. As previously
reported, a transient MCAO also can cause mild
secondary damage to the hippocampus (Butler et al.,
2002; Danielisova et al., 2011). However, TTC staining
is not suitable for identifying the perilesional-aﬀected
regions after transient MCAO, such as the hippocampus

(Popp et al., 2009; Danielisova et al., 2011).
Considering that the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway is activated early after ischemic injury (Cho et al.,
2003; Chen et al., 2014), we performed immunostaining
of activated caspase-3, a key mediator in apoptotic cascades (Salvesen, 2002; Ghavami et al., 2009), to demonstrate whether MCAO induced damage to the
hippocampus. In consistence with previous studies
(Namura et al., 1998; Cho et al., 2003), we observed
the activated caspase-3-positive cells in the hippocampal
CA1 region of MCAO rats (Fig. 1B). Moreover, we found
that MCAO changed the membrane properties of hippocampal neurons by electrophysiological recording,
speciﬁcally causing membrane depolarization, which further conﬁrmed the previous report (Chi and Xu, 2000).
The membrane depolarization induced by ischemia can
lead to the activation of potassium channels, thereby
reducing intracellular potassium (Ekholm et al., 1993;
Haddad, 1997) and accelerating activation of the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway (Hughes et al.,
1997; Yu et al., 1998). In summary, the present ischemic
model caused damage to hippocampal neurons.
Furthermore, we observed changes in the potassium
currents in the hippocampal neurons of brain slices of
rats after a transient MCAO operation. We found that
MCAO could signiﬁcantly increase the hippocampal
potassium currents, including Kv and IK (Fig. 2). This
phenomenon is consistent with previous reports in
several experimental models, such as serum deprivation
(Yu et al., 1997), forebrain ischemia (Chi and Xu, 2000;
Xuan Chi and Xu, 2000), and Ab-induced neuronal injury
(Yu et al., 1998). Based on the present knowledge,
increased IK will accelerate injured neurons to undergo
apoptotic death (Yu et al., 1998, 1999) because the
reduction of intracellular potassium can activate caspase-dependent apoptotic signaling as stated above.
With this model, we found that VEGF could eﬀectively
inhibit the increase of IK in the hippocampal neurons
induced by ischemic injury (Figs. 3 and 4).
In a previous study, we showed that endogenous
VEGF expression in the neurons plays a compensatory
neuroprotective role against ischemic cell injury because
VEGF antibody treatment deteriorates brain damage
after MCAO (Bao et al., 1999). The exogenous administration of VEGF exhibits many beneﬁcial eﬀects in the processes of neuronal damage and repair in brains following

ischemic stroke, including angiogenesis (Sun et al.,
2003), neuroprotection and neurogenesis (Sun and
Guo, 2005), as well as regulating neural plasticity via
the regulation of the activities of calcium and sodium ion
channels (Ma et al., 2009; Sun and Ma, 2013). The present study found that VEGF could acutely, reversibly
and voltage-dependently inhibit ischemia-induced
increase of IK (Figs. 3 and 4). Previous studies have
shown that the activities of potassium channels play
major roles in regulating neuronal excitability via maintenance of resting potentials on the membrane of intact
brains as well as in processing pathogenesis in injured
brains (Yu et al., 1997; Huang et al., 2001; Wei et al.,
2003). In our previous study, we showed that VEGF protects neurons against hypoxic injury via enhancement of
ischemia-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of potassium
channel protein using in vitro assays (Qiu et al., 2003).
Combined with the previous study, we found that the
changes of electrophysiological activity of potassium
channels caused by VEGF concur with the changes of
protein modiﬁcation noted above (Qiu et al., 2003).
In the present study, we found that activation of the
PI3-K signaling pathway plays an important role in
VEGF inhibition of ischemia-induced increase of
neuronal IK because blockade of PI3-K signaling by
wortmannin reduced this inhibition (Fig. 5). It has been
demonstrated that VEGF may protect neuronal cells
against death induced by hypoxia (Qiu et al., 2003) and
glucose deprivation (Jin et al., 2000) via activation of the
PI3-K signaling pathway in cell culture models.
Moreover, Qiu and her colleagues found that VEGF’s
neuroprotection depends on phosphorylated modiﬁcation
of tyrosine residues on the potassium channel Kv1.2 protein via activation of the PI3-K signaling pathway (Qiu
et al., 2003). In the present study, the results demonstrate
that VEGF inhibited ischemia-induced increase of IK on
the membrane of hippocampal neurons via activation of
the PI3-K signaling pathway. Collectively, the results suggest that VEGF inhibition of IK may be associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of potassium channel protein via
activation of the PI3-K signaling pathway, and that this
inhibition plays neuroprotective roles in the pathophysiological development of neurons in adult brains after
ischemic injury.

CONCLUSION
The present results revealed that VEGF inhibited the
increase of IK by ischemic injury via activation of the
PI3-K signaling pathway. The inhibitory eﬀects of VEGF
on IK increase partially explain its neuroprotection
against ischemic injury, combined with our previous
observation (Qiu et al., 2003). Moreover, the ﬁnding that
VEGF acutely and reversibly regulated the potassium currents on the neuronal membrane provides further direct
evidence of neurovascular function coupling, which may
be an important event for neuronal repair or reconstruction in the brain following ischemic injury. However, the
mechanism of this coupling requires further investigation.
