Alterations in the time course of expression of the Nox family in
the brain in a rat experimental cerebral ischemia and reperfusion
model: effects of melatonin
Abstract: Ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury induces the generation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), which results in a poor prognosis for ischemic stroke
patients. This study was designed to evaluate the time course of expression of
the Nox family, a major source of ROS, and whether melatonin, a potent
scavenger of ROS, inﬂuences these parameters in a rat model of cerebral I/R
caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). After 2-hr occlusion, the
ﬁlament was withdrawn to allow reperfusion. At 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hr
after reperfusion, brain tissue samples were obtained for assays. Among the
Nox family, the mRNA and protein levels of Nox2 and Nox4 were increased
both in the ischemic hemisphere and contralateral counterpart in the
experimental I/R rats at 0 hr after reperfusion, peaked at 3 hr, and then
returned to the basal level at 24 hr. Double-immunoﬂuorescence staining
further conﬁrmed the expressions of Nox2 and Nox4 in three major types of
brain cells, including neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells. In addition,
melatonin (5 mg/kg) or its vehicle was injected intraperitoneally at 0.5 hr
before MCAO. Compared with I/R + vehicle group, melatonin pretreatment
diminished the increased expression of Nox2 and Nox4, reduced ROS levels,
and inhibited cell apoptosis. Our ﬁndings suggested that the inhibition of
Nox2 and Nox4 expressions by melatonin may essentially contribute to its
antioxidant and anti-apoptotic eﬀects during brain I/R.

Introduction
Stroke and its complications are becoming the leading
cause of disability and the third leading cause of death in
adults worldwide [1]. In this study, we focus on ischemic
stroke (87% of all stroke cases). As neurons start dying
already 5 min after being deprived of oxygen [2], the therapeutic time window for ischemic stroke is very short and
early recanalization by intravenous administration of
thrombolytics is currently the only approved treatment for
stroke [3]. Unfortunately, because the newly arriving oxygen in the reperfusion process generates massive numbers
of ROS, even if blood ﬂow is restored, ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury induced by ROS leads to an unfavorable
clinical outcome of the therapy [4].
Although multiple enzymes contribute to oxidative
stress in diﬀerent tissues or cells, Nox family of NADPH
oxidases has been identiﬁed as the only known enzyme
family that has no other function than to produce ROS
[2]. The mammalian Nox family consists of seven members, identiﬁed as Nox1 to Nox5, dual oxidase (Duox)-1,
and Duox-2 [5]. Within recent years, with the growing
interest in NADPH oxidases, the role of this family in
pathophysiological dysfunction of cerebral cells during I/R
has attracted considerable attention. Studies have suggested that Nox family proteins act as important generators of ROS in several cell types in the brain, including in

neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells under physiological and pathophysiological conditions in general and during I/R in particular [1]. Additionally, even in the
nonischemic arteries from the contralateral hemisphere of
the brain, NADPH oxidase activity is temporarily
enhanced after cerebral ischemia [6]. However, the time
course of expression of the Nox family in the brain, especially in the contralateral hemisphere, during I/R is still
not well known.
As a radical scavenger, melatonin (N-acetyl 5-methoxytryptamine) exerts beneﬁcial eﬀects in a rat model of renal
I/R [7, 8] and in animal and human models of myocardial I/R [9, 10]. Meanwhile, melatonin has a very short
half-life, from 45 to 60 min [11]. Besides melatonin functioning as a radical scavenger, some of its ability to protect
against I/R injury may relate to its metabolites, which are
equally eﬀective in reducing oxidative stress [12]. Melatonin is also known to signiﬁcantly reduce hypoxic injury to
the brain [13, 14], an action not mediated by melatonin
receptors and known to rely on the ability of melatonin as
a radical scavenger [15]. Melatonin has been shown to
reduce the expression of NADPH oxidase in the brain and
protect the blood–brain barrier in bile duct-ligated young
rats [16]; it also mitigates the increased expression of
NADPH oxidase in the thoracic aorta induced by chronic
intermittent hypoxia [17]. Finally, as noted above, melatonin is well documented to play a neuroprotective role in a

rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
stroke model [18–22]. However, information as to the
mechanism for the protective role of melatonin during
brain I/R injury is still limited.
In the intraluminal MCAO model, there are two ischemic regions: ischemic core and penumbra (peri-infract)
region [23]. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
time course of expression of the Nox family and whether
melatonin inﬂuences these parameters in the penumbra
region in a rat brain I/R injury model, because the ischemic lesion in this region could be rescued [24]. Nox5, however, was not investigated because it is absent from the rat
and mouse genomes [5].

Materials and methods
Animal treatment

ICA until the tip occluded the proximal stem of the middle
cerebral artery (MCA). Rectal temperature was maintained between 36.5 and 37.5°C with a heating pad. After
2 hr of ischemia, the ﬁlament was withdrawn to allow reperfusion. At 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hr after reperfusion,
brain tissue samples were obtained for assays.
TTC staining
Forty-eight hours after reperfusion, rats were deeply anesthetized by urethane (1000 mg/kg body weight) and decapitated. The brain was removed quickly and frozen in
stainless steel brain matrices (20°C) for 10 min. The
brain was subsequently sectioned coronally into 2-mmthick slices starting from the frontal pole. The cerebellum
and olfactory bulb were discarded. Slices were then
immersed in 10 mL of 2.0% TTC (T8877; Sigma) for
30 min at 37°C. After staining, the slices were washed
three times with saline, ﬁxed in 10% formalin, and then
captured with a digital camera. Then, the infarct volume
was calculated as described previously [20]. Brieﬂy, the
total mean infarct area of each section was calculated as
the average of the area on the rostral and the caudal side.
The total area was calculated by adding the average area
from each section. Multiplication of the total area by
2 mm (thickness of the sections) was calculated as infarct
volume. The infarct volume was expressed as a percentage
of the ipsilateral hemispheric volume.

All experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee
of the First Aﬃliated Hospital of Soochow University and
were in accordance with the guidelines of the National
Institutes of Health on the care and use of animals. Adult
male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats (250–300 g) were purchased from Animal Center of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. The rats were housed in
temperature- and humidity-controlled animal quarters
with a 12-hr light/dark cycle. Firstly, 18 SD rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham group (n = 6), I/R
+ vehicle group (n = 6), and I/R + melatonin group
(n = 6). At 48 hr after reperfusion, brain tissue samples
were obtained separately from rats for 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Secondly, 46 SD rats
were randomly divided into sham group (n = 8) and I/R
group (n = 48). In the I/R group, brain tissue samples
were obtained separately from rats at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and
48 hr after reperfusion (n = 8 for each time point) for the
time course study for the expression of the Nox family. In
the third set of the study, another 32 SD rats were divided
into two groups: I/R + vehicle group (n = 16) and I/R +
melatonin group (n = 16). As described in our previous
study [25], melatonin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Inc., (M-5250; St. Louis, MO, USA) and dissolved in normal saline containing 1% ethanol as the vehicle. A single
dose of melatonin (5 mg/kg) or equal volumes of vehicle
were injected intraperitoneally at 0.5 hr before MCAO.
Based on the results of the time course study, brain tissue
samples were obtained from rats of I/R + vehicle group
and I/R + melatonin group at 3 and 24 hr after reperfusion (n = 8 for each time point).

After indicated treatment, the rats were deeply anesthetized by urethane (1000 mg/kg body weight) and transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS. Then, in each animal,
the cerebellum and olfactory bulb were discarded, and the
brain was removed quickly and frozen in stainless steel
brain matrices (20°C) for 10 min. The ischemic penumbra was determined according to the method described by
Ashwal et al. [23]. Brieﬂy, the brain was subsequently sectioned into three slices beginning 3 mm from the anterior
tip of the frontal lobe. The front and back slices were
3 mm in thickness. The middle slice was 4 mm in thickness, which was cut longitudinally in the ischemic hemisphere 2 mm from the midline. A transverse diagonal cut
was made at the 2 O’clock position to separate the core
from the penumbra. The cerebral cortical penumbra and
the analogous contralateral region were harvested for
reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR), Western blot, and immunoﬂuorescence assay.

Rat model of focal cerebral ischemia

RT-PCR

Following the intraperitoneal anesthesia with chloral
hydrate (36 mg/100 g body weight), under an operating
microscope, focal cerebral ischemia was achieved by rightsided endovascular MCAO. In brief, the right common,
external, and internal carotid arteries (CCA, ECA, and
ICA) were revealed via a midline cervical incision. Then, a
piece of 4.0-monoﬁlament nylon suture with the tip
rounded by heating before coating with polylysine was
inserted through the right CCA and advanced it along the

After tissues were collected, total RNA of the brain from
each rat was separately extracted with RNA Trizol (15596026; Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Brieﬂy, the aqueous was reacted with chloroform and centrifuged at
10,000 g for 15 min. The supernatants were incubated with
isopropanol for 5 min and were centrifuged at 13,000 g for
15 min. The pellets were dissolved in RNase-free water,
and the concentrations of RNA were tested using a

spectrophotometer. Then, RNA was then reverse transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (K1622; Fermentas/
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc., Rockford, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The PCR primers were
listed in Table 1. RT-PCR was performed using DreamTaq
Green PCR Master Mix (K1081; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc
Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). In addition, ampliﬁcation of
GAPDH sequences from the same samples served as loading controls. All PCR reactions were performed with a
Gene Amp PCR system 2004 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham,
MA, USA). The PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed
under ultraviolet illumination. The relative densitometric
intensity of the bands was quantitated using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) and normalized to the
loading control.

12,000 g for 10 min at 4°C, the supernatants were collected. The protein concentration was determined using
the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit (Beyotime, P0012). Then,
protein samples (20 lg/lane) were loaded on a 15% SDSpolyacrylamide gel, separated, and electrophoretically
transferred to a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane
(IPVH00010; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membrane was blocked with PBST (10 mM sodium phosphate,
pH 7.2, 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) containing 5%
skim milk powder for 1 hr at 37°C. Subsequently, the
membrane was probed with the primary antibody overnight at 4°C and then incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody for 2 hr at 37°C and
washed with PBST. Then, the membrane was revealed
with use of an enhanced chemiluminesence detection kit.
The relative quantity of proteins was analyzed by use of
Image J program and normalized to that of loading
controls.

To identify the mechanisms of the protective eﬀect of melatonin, TUNEL-staining slides were then incubated with
Nox2 or Nox4 antibody overnight. Results were visualized
by a ﬂuorescence microscope (OLYMPUS BX50/BXFLA/DP70; Olympus Co.). Three sections per rat were
examined and photographed in parallel for TUNEL-positive cell counting.

Statistical analyses
Data are expressed as mean  S.E.M. SPSS 11.5 (SPSS

Assay of ROS
The level of ROS was measured by the Reactive Oxygen
Species Assay Kit (E004; Nanjing Jiancheng Biotechnology Institute, Nanjing, China). Brieﬂy, after tissues were
collected, the brains were homogenized and centrifuged at

collected for ROS assay. ROS concentrations were
assessed using the oxidant-sensitive probe 2,7-dichloroﬂuorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The ﬂuorescence intensity was measured
using a ﬂuorimetric microplate reader (FilterMax F5;

Results
Firstly, TTC staining displayed the stability and reproducibility of the ischemia model used in this study and the
beneﬁt of melatonin pretreatment in the infarct area
(Fig. 1). Then, a time course study for the expression of
the Nox family after I/R was performed by RT-PCR and
Western blot (Figs 2 and 3). Among the Nox family, the
expressions of Nox2 and Nox4 in the ischemic hemisphere

and reached a peak level at 3 hr, decreased at 24 hr, and
then were similar to the levels in the sham group. Interestingly, the expressions of Nox2 and Nox4 were also
increased in the contralateral nonischemic brain. As well,
(A)

a similar trend was detected in the expression of Duox1,
but only in the ischemic hemisphere of the brain. As alterations in the expressions of Nox2 and Nox4 were more
signiﬁcant than that of Duox1, we focused on Nox2 and
Nox4 in the following study.

To determine the cell identity for Nox2 and Nox4
expressions, double-immunoﬂuorescence staining with the
corresponding cell-type-speciﬁc marker antibodies was
performed at 3 hr after reperfusion (Figs 4–6). The results
revealed that both Nox2 and Nox4 expressions were
signiﬁcantly increased in three major types of brain cells,
including neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells.
Similarly, ROS production in the ischemic hemisphere
was obviously higher than that of sham group at 3 hr after

(A)

reperfusion and remained so to 48 hr or longer, while in
the contralateral counterpart of the brain, ROS production was also signiﬁcantly enhanced at 12 and 24 hr after
reperfusion (Fig. 7).
To understand the mechanism for the protective role of
melatonin during brain I/R injury, we then tested the
eﬀect of melatonin pretreatment on the level of ROS at
24 hr after reperfusion (Fig. 8). Consistent with previous
reports in other disease states [7–9], melatonin pretreatment

In addition, we explored the eﬀect of melatonin pretreatment on the cell death in the brain at 24 hr after reperfusion by TUNEL staining (Fig. 9A). Compared with

the sham group, signiﬁcant increase in TUNEL-positive
cells was observed in I/R group, especially in the ischemic
hemisphere of the brain, while the number of TUNELpositive cells was reduced by melatonin, showing an
anti-apoptotic eﬀect of melatonin. To further elucidate the

Melatonin reduces Nox2 and Nox4 during I/R
anti-apoptotic properties of melatonin, we costained brain
sections for Nox2 and TUNEL or Nox4 and TUNEL
under indicated treatments (Fig. 9B). The results demonstrated that many TUNEL-positive cells were colabeled
with high ﬂuorescence intensity of Nox2 or Nox4. More
interestingly, both the number of Nox2/TUNEL-positive
cells and the number of Nox4/TUNEL-positive cells were
reduced by melatonin pretreatment in the brain. In line
with the results described above, Western blot analyses
showed the high levels of Nox2 and Nox4 at 3 hr after
reperfusion, which were signiﬁcantly inhibited by melatonin (Fig. 10). Taken together, these data suggested that
melatonin might reduce the ROS level, at least in part, via
inhibition of the expressions of Nox2 and Nox4, and subsequently inhibit cell apoptosis induced by I/R.

Discussion
It is noteworthy that, although there is accumulating evidence that Nox family acts as a main source of ROS production during reoxygenation [1] and melatonin plays a
neuroprotection role against I/R injury [18–22], this is the
ﬁrst study to speciﬁcally examine the time course of
expression of the Nox family and the eﬀect of melatonin
on these parameters following brain I/R. In this study, we
found that Nox2 and Nox4 expressions peaked at 3 hr
after reperfusion, which was inhibited by melatonin. In
addition, we found that melatonin reduced the ROS levels
and inhibited cell apoptosis induced by I/R. Furthermore,
previous observations demonstrated that, as a thrombolytic, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) increased neuronal damage after focal cerebral ischemia in mice [27],
while intraperitoneal administration of melatonin reduced
disseminate neuronal injury after mild focal ischemia in

data suggested that melatonin and its metabolites are
potent ROS scavengers and may be useful during recanalization therapy for ischemic stroke patients. Collectively,
the key novel ﬁndings of this study were the following: (i)
time course study for the expression of Nox family may
provide a new index for the theoretical considerations of
therapeutic time window for thrombolytic stroke therapy
and (ii) pretreatment of melatonin may improve the prognosis of thrombolytic stroke therapy.
Previous works have demonstrated that melatonin plays
a neuroprotective role in ischemic brain injury [13]. Melatonin signiﬁcantly reduced the volume of cerebral infarction and NO levels in a rat MCAO stroke model [18, 19].
It has been also reported that melatonin treatment diminished the loss of neurons and decreased the infarct volume
via inhibition of the mtPTP in transient brain ischemia
[20]. In addition, melatonin is in fact a well-known antiinﬂammatory agent [29]. Other reports claimed that melatonin treatment mediates neuroprotection against I/R
injury partly via inhibition of the consequential inﬂammatory response [21] or activation of Raf/MEK/ERK/
p90RSK cascade [22]. Furthermore, melatonin also could
suppress hepatic reperfusion injury through inhibition of
IKK and JNK pathways and modiﬁcation of cell proliferation [30]. Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest that melatonin may serve as more than a ROS scavenger and its other
roles await further studies.
A large number of research, including the current study,
focused on the expression of Nox family. However, the
activation of the NADPH oxidase, essential for ROS generation, is tightly controlled through regulated assembly of
the individual oxidase subunits into a functionally active
complex. In addition, melatonin has been reported to inhibit ROS generation in amyloid-b1–42-activated microglia
by impairing NADPH oxidase assembly [31]. Whether or
how melatonin aﬀects the assembly of NADPH oxidase
underlies brain I/R injury still needs further investigtions.
Intriguingly, we found that the expressions of Nox2 and
Nox4 were enhanced in the nonischemic hemisphere of the
brain during I/R. Indeed, ROS production in the contralateral hemisphere of cerebral I/R was substantially elevated at 12 and 24 hr after reperfusion. Analogous
ﬁndings have been reported. These studies showed that
Nox4 expression in neuronal cells was enhanced in the
nonischemic hemisphere following MCAO [32], and the
activity of NADPH oxidase was elevated in cerebral arteries from the nonischemic hemisphere of stroke rats [6]. In
addition, previous works have revealed that, following the
ischemia insult, there is an increase in inﬂammatory cytokines [33, 34], which can increase the activity of NADPH
oxidase [35]. Therefore, such observations may indicate
that there was a systemic inﬂammatory response occurring
in both cerebral hemispheres ipsilateral and contralateral
to occlusion, leading to an upregulation of the expression
of the Nox family or NADPH oxidase activity. Furthermore, as shown in this study, both the increased expressions of Nox2 and Nox4 and the high level of ROS in the
contralateral hemisphere of cerebral I/R were inhibited by
melatonin, which may be due to the anti-inﬂammatory
property of melatonin as reported previously [21, 29].

The unfavorable clinical outcome of the recanalization
therapy under the current situation suggests a clear need
for development of new and more eﬀective therapies for
controlling ROS generation after reperfusion. Existing
agents, or novel compounds that manipulate key factors
regulating ROS generation after reperfusion, may eventually be shown to have eﬃcacy for improving the prognosis
of ischemic stroke patients. In summary, to the best of our
knowledge, this study provides evidence that pretreatment
with melatonin could inhibit ROS generation by reducing
the expressions of Nox2 and Nox4 after reperfusion,
which would provide a new clue for development of new
and more eﬀective therapies for controlling ROS generation after reperfusion.
