Abstract. Propofol, an intravenous anesthetic, inhibits
neuronal apoptosis induced by ischemic stroke, protects the
brain from ischemia/reperfusion injury and improves neuronal
function. However, whether propofol is able to protect the
blood brain barrier (BBB) and the underlying mechanisms
have remained to be elucidated. In the present study, a rat
model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion was established, using
a thread embolism to achieve middle cerebral artery occlusion.
Rats were treated with propofol (propofol post‑conditioning)
or physiological saline (control) administered by intravenous
injection 30 min following reperfusion. Twenty-four hours
following reperfusion, neurobehavioral manifestations were
assessed. The levels of cephaloedema, damage to the BBB
and expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP‑9),
aquaporin-4 (AQP‑4) and phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal
kinase (pJNK) were determined in order to evaluate the effects
of propofol on the BBB. In comparison to the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion group, the levels of brain water content and
Evans blue content, as well as the expression levels of MMP‑9,
AQP‑4 and pJNK were significantly reduced in the propofol
post‑conditioning group. These results indicated that propofol
post‑conditioning improved the neurobehavioral manifestations and attenuated the BBB damage and cephaloedema
induced following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. This effect
may be due to the inhibition of MMP‑9 and AQP‑4 expression,
and the concurrent decrease in JNK phosphorylation.

Introduction
Reperfusion of ischemic brain tissues is an effective protocol
for the treatment of stroke. However, the aggravation of ischemia and hypoxia as well as the necrosis/apoptosis of neurons in
the peripheral zone destroys the normal structure and function
of brain tissues (1). The underlying mechanism of this effect
involves the release of oxygen free radicals and excitatory
amino acids as well as the activation of apoptosis‑associated
genes (including an increase in the expression of pro-apoptotic
and a decrease in anti‑apoptotic genes) (1). The destruction of
the blood brain barrier (BBB) further induces cerebral edema
and normal brain‑tissue damage. These effects have markedly
influenced the efficacy of therapies for cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (2). Numerous studies have shown that during
cerebral ischemia in the BBB, matrix metalloproteinase-9
(MMP‑9) and aquaporin-4 (AQP‑4) have crucial roles (3,4) in
the development of cerebral edema. MMP‑9 is able to degrade
the extracellular matrix and BBB, influence the permeability
of blood vessels and participate in the induction of vasogenic
brain edema (3). AQP‑4 regulates water metabolism, water
distribution and osmotic pressure (4). Furthermore, the c-Jun
N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is involved in the activation
of MMP-9 and AQP-4 (5,6).
Propofol, which is clinically used as an anesthetic, reduces
cerebral blood flow, oxygen consumption and intracranial pressure (7). A previous study has indicated that propofol pre‑ and
post‑conditioning treatments may protect tissues from cerebral
ischemia‑reperfusion injury. Propofol inhibits the activation of
proapoptotic genes, thereby reducing neuronal apoptosis and
improving prognosis (7-9). However, previous studies have
focused on the protective effects of propofol on neurons and
the mechanisms underlying these effects, whereas there are
few studies regarding the effects of propofol on the BBB and
its underlying mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, no
study has been performed investigating the effects of propofol
on the expression of MMP‑9, AQP‑4 and phosphorylated JNK
following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.
In the present study, an established rat model of cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion was treated with propofol administered
via intravenous injection. The condition of the BBB, level of

cephaloedema and neural functions of propofol-treated rats
were assessed and scored to evaluate the protective effects of
propofol post-conditioning. The expression levels of MMP‑9
and AQP‑4 and the phosphorylation level of pJNK were also
determined in order to elucidate the mechanism underlying
the protective effects of propofol on the BBB.
Materials and methods
Drugs and reagents. The drugs and reagents used in the
present study included propofol (Diprivan; AstraZeneca,
London, UK), Evans blue (EB) and dimethylformamide
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Antibodies included
rabbit anti‑mouse MMP‑9 polyclonal antibody and JNK/pJNK
polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas,
TX, USA) rabbit anti‑mouse AQP‑4 antibody (Chemicon®,
EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and rabbit anti‑mouse
β‑actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). A western blotting kit was
purchased from KPL (Gaithersburg, MD, USA).
Experimental animal selection and grouping. Ninety-six
healthy adult Wistar rats, weighing 260-300 g and aged
4-6 weeks (Experimental Animal Centre of Zhongshan
University, Guangzhou, China) were kept in a 12 h/12 h
light/dark cycle at 28-32˚C with free access to food and water.
Rats were randomly divided into four groups: The sham
operation group (group S, n=24), the ischemia reperfusion
group (group I, n=24) and two propofol‑treated groups, which
included group P1 (20 mg/kg/h profopol, n=24) and group P2
(40 mg/kg/h profopol, n=24). The study was approved by
the Animal Care Committee of Sun Yat-sen University
(Guangzhou, China) and performed in strict accordance
with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Use of
Laboratory Animals.
Preparation of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rat model and
assessment of neural function. The rats were subjected to
fasting without drinking for 12 h prior to surgery. Anesthesia
was induced in a Plexiglass chamber with 4% halothane
(Sigma‑Aldrich), followed by tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation with 1.3% halothane in 30% O2/70% N2O. The
left femoral artery was cannulated to monitor blood pressure
and spontaneous breath was conserved. The rat was prepared
for surgery by the removal of hair in the middle of the neck in
the supine position. Subsequently the skin was prepared with
75% alcohol and a surgical incision was made at the flank of the
neck. The right common carotid artery, right external carotid
artery, right internal carotid artery and wing palatal artery
were isolated. The external carotid and wing palatal arteries
were ligatured and the right common carotid artery was
blocked by a bulldog clamp, while the right external carotid
artery was punctured 0.5 cm from the ligation at the proximal
end to heart. A nylon thread was inserted into the wound and
pushed through the right internal carotid artery in the direction of the brain and the opposite side of the artery was pierced
18‑20 mm further down. The middle cerebral artery was then
blocked. Following surgery, cerebral blood flow was required
to be reduced to ~30%; otherwise, the rat model was considered unsuccessful and removed (10). Two hours following the
arterial block, the thread was removed, the residual end of the

artery was fastened and the skin and subcutaneous tissue were
sutured. Once the rats regained consciousness, behavioral
disorders were assessed according to the Longa method (11)
using the following scale: No visible neural function loss, 0;
left forepaw unable to straighten, 1; walking impaired with
an inclination towards ischemic hemisphere, 2; repeated left
turning, 3; falling left, 4; unable to walk, 5.
Drug treatment. The P1 and P2 groups were treated with
20 mg/kg/h or 40 mg/kg/h propofol, respectively, for 30 min
via the tail vein, 30 min following reperfusion. Group I was
treated with an equal amount of physiological saline (SigmaAldrich)and in group S, the incision was made but no arterial
occlusion was performed.
The water content of the ischemic hemisphere of the brain
was detected using the wet/dry weight ratio method with the
following formula: Water content (%)=100x[(wet weight)‑(dry
weight)]/wet weight.
Detection of EB. The permeability of the BBB was determined
according to the protocol described by Uyama et al (12), by the
detection of EB fluorescence. Twenty-three hours following
reperfusion, rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate
and 2% EB (3 ml/kg) was injected into the femoral vein. One
hour later, the ventriculus sinister was washed with physiological saline for 0.5 h. The brain was removed by decollation and
surface moisture was blotted with filter paper. The cerebral
cortex of the ischemic side was excised and the wet weight was
measured with an electronic balance prior to incubation with
4 ml dimethylformamide (Sigma-Aldrich) at 50˚C for 48 h
followed by centrifugation at 1509 x g for 15 min. The absorbency of the supernatant at 620 nm was determined using a
Hitachi U2001 (Hitachi, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The content of EB
(µg/g) was subsequently calculated according to the standard
curve method (12).
Immunohistochemical examination. Half of the animals
in each group were randomly selected to be sacrificed by
administration of 5% halothane (Sigma‑Aldrich) and fixed in
the dorsal position immediately following behavioral testing.
The rat hearts were exposed by opening the chest from the
xiphisternum and were perfused through the ascending aorta
with 150 ml saline followed by 400 ml 4% paraformaldehyde.
Following perfusion, the brain was removed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight and subsequently
transferred to 30% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated
for 3‑5 days. The damaged brain area was dissected into
1‑mm coronal sections. Sequential 10‑µm coronal sections
were cut from the sections (from bregma -2.3 to -2.45 mm)
by cryomicrotomy (CM1900; Leica Microsystems GmbH,
Wetzlar, Germany), the sections were treated with 0.3% H2O2
(Sigma-Aldrich) in methanol for 30 min, hydrated gradually
in distilled water and incubated for 2 h with 5% goat serum
(Sigma-Aldrich) to block nonspecific immune reactions.
The sections were subsequently incubated at 4˚C overnight
with rabbit polyclonal anti-MMP‑9 or anti-AQP‑4 antibodies
(1:2,000). Following washing with Tris-buffered saline
(Sigma-Aldrich), the sections were incubated with biotinylated
goat anti‑rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (1:200; Zhongshan
Golden Bridge Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) for 2 h

(1:200; Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology Co.) for 2 h.
Finally, the sections were exposed to 0.01% 3,3'‑diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 0.5‑2 min, followed by examination
under a light microscope (Olympus BX51; Olympus Corp.,
Tokyo, Japan). The optical density of MMP‑9 and AQP‑4
immunoreactivity was evaluated in an area of 1x1 mm2 in the
boundary zone.

Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using SPSS 16.0

mean ± standard deviation. Differences between groups were
analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and multiple
comparisons were made using the least significant difference
test. Data of skewed distribution are presented as the median.
P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant
difference between values.

Western blot analysis. Twenty-four hours following reperfusion, rats were sacrificed. The brains were removed and
immediately cut into two 2‑mm sections on dry ice, excluding
4 mm of the rostral tissue. Slices were cut into the right and left
hemispheres, and the right striatum and parietal cortex were
isolated and homogenized in tissue lysate buffer (10 ml/mg
tissue) containing a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Thermo
Fisher Scientific China Co., Ltd, Beijing, China), prior to
dispersion by sonication. The homogenate was centrifuged at
2,250 x g for 30 min at 4˚C, and the supernatant was saved. A
bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.; Thermos
Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) was used to determine
the protein concentration. Proteins (30 µg/well) were separated
on using 10% SDS‑PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (Sigma-Aldrich) at 100 mV. The membranes
were blocked with 5% non‑fat milk (Sigma-Aldrich) in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween‑20 (Sigma-Aldrich) for
1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4˚C with
rabbit anti‑mouse MMP‑9 polyclonal antibody (1:2,000; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), rabbit anti‑mouse AQP‑4 antibody
(1:2,000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) or rabbit polyclonal
anti‑pJNK antibody (1:2,000; Santa Crux Biotechnology, Inc.).
Following three washes in Tris‑buffered saline for 5 min, the
blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the
appropriate horseradish peroxidase‑conjugated secondary
antibody (1:3,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). MMP‑9,
AQP‑4 and pJNK were subsequently visualized by incubation
with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 1 min, and exposure onto
hyperfilm (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1‑10 min. Membranes which
were positive for JNK were re‑blocked with 5% non‑fat milk
for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti‑JNK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.)
overnight at 4˚C. Visualization of JNK was performed as
described above. Image J 1.35 software (National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used to analyze the relative
density values.

Results
Propofol post‑conditioning improves neurobehavioral
scores and decreases water- and EB content 24 h following
reperfusion. The assessment of neurological function indicated that all experimental animals exhibited post‑ischemic
neurological deficits. Rats in groups I, P1, and P2 scored
significantly higher than those in group S (P<0.05).
Compared with the rats in group I, those in groups P1 and
P2 scored significantly lower (P<0.05). The experimental
groups demonstrated higher water content and EB content
in the ischemic hemisphere in comparison to that of group S
(P<0.05). The water and EB content were significantly
reduced in groups P1 and P2 compared to those in group I
(P<0.05; Table I).
MMP‑9 and AQP‑4 expression in the ischemic hemi‑
sphere are attenuated following propofol treatment.
Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the expression
levels of MMP‑9 and AQP‑4 in ischemic brain tissue in group I
were significantly increased compared to those in group S
(P<0.05). Following propofol post-conditioning, the expression levels of MMP‑9 and AQP‑4 were significantly decreased
in groups P1 and P2 compared with those in group I (P<0.05),
although expression levels remained significantly higher than
those in group S (P<0.05; Figs. 1 and 2).
Propofol post-conditioning decreases the expression of
MMP‑9, AQP‑4 and pJNK in brain tissues. Twenty-four
hours following ischemia/reperfusion, the expression levels
of MMP‑9, AQP‑4 and the levels of pJNK were significantly
increased. Following treatment with propofol, the expression
levels of MMP‑9, AQP‑4 and pJNK in groups P1 and P2 were
significantly decreased (P<0.05). Furthermore, the expression levels of MMP‑9, AQP‑4 and pJNK were significantly
decreased in group P2 compared with those in group P1
(P<0.05; Figs. 3-5).

Discussion
The middle cerebral artery is prone to ischemic cerebrovascular disease. In a previous study, a model of
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion was established using the Longa
method (11), which was selected for the high success rate,
reproducibility and low risk of complications. This established
model effectively simulated the clinical and pathological

characteristics of cerebral infarction. In the present study, rats
with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion scored significantly lower
in the assessment of neural function. Cerebral infarction was
observed in the ischemic hemisphere, which indicated that the
model reflected the clinical and pathological characteristics
of cerebral infarction. Vascular occlusion resulted in cerebral
circulatory dysfunction, and therefore cerebral ischemia
and hypoxia irreversibly damaged neurons in the affected

part of the brain. Furthermore, damage to the BBB induced
successive cerebral edema, which further impaired brain
tissues. A significant improvement in neural function was
observed following propofol post‑conditioning in cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion rats and the water content of the brain
was also decreased. These results demonstrated that propofol
treatment may protect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
damage, which was in agreement with the results reported in
a previous paper (9).

nervous system, and localizes to the membrane of astrocytes,
subarachnoid space, glial cells surrounding vessels, ependymal
cells and the choroid plexus (13). AQP‑4 is a critical component
of integrated water and potassium homeostasis (14), and has
important roles in water metabolism, localization and osmotic
pressure (4). AQP‑4 knock‑out rats were found to have improved
cephaloedema following cerebral ischemic stroke (15). MMP‑9
is a type of matrix metalloproteinase that is able to degrade
the basal lamina and disrupt the BBB. MMP‑9 is involved in
the pathophysiological process of cerebral ischemia via
the degradation of tight junctions between the basal lamina
and endothelial cells, which results in the destruction of the
BBB (16). MMP‑9 has a pivotal role in BBB proteolysis (17),
and increased MMP-9 expression and activation increases the
permeability of the BBB and may therefore exacerbate cephaloedema (3,18,19). Furthermore, during cerebral ischemia
hypoxia‑inducible factor‑1α may damage the BBB by activating
the expression of AQP‑4 and MMP‑9 and aggravating cerebral
edema. Inhibitors of AQP‑4 and MMP‑9 may protect the BBB
to a certain extent (20). The extent of brain edema observed
in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion animals was significantly
reduced following inhibition, and the animals demonstrated
an improved prognosis (21-23). These results indicated that
the mechanism underlying BBB protection may be associated
with the inhibition of AQP-4 and MMP-9 function. Studies
have additionally demonstrated that propofol inhibited the
expression of AQP‑4 in astroglia in vitro (23) and decreased
the expression of MMP‑9 in vivo (24). In the present study,
the expression levels of AQP‑4 and MMP‑9 were markedly
lower in groups P1 and P2 than those in group S, indicating
that treatment with propofol inhibited the expression of these
proteins.

The activity of AQP‑4 and MMP‑9 is influenced by
numerous factors. Studies have indicated that damage to the
central nervous system may activate the expression of MMP‑9
and AQP‑4 via the JNK pathway (5,6). JNK is a member of the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, which are
involved in mediating the inflammatory response following
cerebral ischemia, cell factors, cell proliferation and differentiation as well as the process of oxidant stress (5,6). The activation
of JNK induces the phosphorylation of downstream factors,
including c‑Jun, protein 53 and activator protein 1, as well as
modulating gene expression, protein synthesis and neuronal
apoptosis (25-28). Animal experiments have revealed that the
phosphorylation of JNK is involved in neuronal apoptosis, and
that the inhibition of JNK phosphorylation is beneficial for
reducing the infarct area and improving prognosis following
cerebral ischemia (29). In vitro experiments demonstrated that
propofol inhibited the activation of JNK and reduced the levels
of cell death induced by oxidative stress (30). Previous studies
demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of l50 mg/kg
propofol or intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg propofol
significantly alleviated cerebral edema, decreased the infarction size during ischemia/reperfusion injury and improved the
National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score in a
rat model (9). Therefore, the dosage of propofol selected for use
in the present study was reasonable and effective in accordance
with previous experiments. The results of the present study
indicated that the levels of pJNK in groups P1 and P2 were
markedly lower than those in the ischemia/reperfusion group.
Due to their similar chemical structures, propofol has analogous biochemical functions to those of Vitamin E, including
anti-oxidative, mitochondrial protective and free‑radical
scavenging activity (31-33). Furthermore, propofol inhibits
the phosphorylation of JNK (30,34). These results therefore
indicated that the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect
of propofol on AQP‑4 and MMP‑9 may be via inactivation of
the JNK pathway.
The function of the BBB is to maintain the central nervous
system and following ischemia/reperfusion, the structure and
function of the BBB is altered. When the BBB is damaged,
its permeability is increased, which allows factors that
cannot cross the barrier under physiological conditions to
cross the BBB (2). This process may induce or aggravate
cephaloedema. The increased permeability of the BBB will
additionally further increase leukocyte infiltration in the
ischemic brain tissue, enhancing inflammation (35). EB is a
classical indicator of BBB permeability (12). The complex
of EB and plasma albumin (ESA) is unable to cross the BBB
under normal conditions; however, when the BBB is damaged,
ESA is able to invade and stain the brain. The infiltration of
EB across the BBB is positively correlated with the extent of
BBB destruction (12). Propofol decreased the expression of
AQP‑4 and MMP‑9 in ischemia/reperfusion rats and downregulated the phosphorylation of JNK, therefore protecting the
integrity of the BBB. The lower water content of groups P1
and P2 compared with that of group I indicated that propofol
treatment may protect the brain by reducing the damage to the
BBB and the extent of cephaloedema.
Propofol reduced the levels of cephaloedema and the
destruction of the BBB following ischemia/reperfusion and
improved the score on the NIHSS. The underlying mechanism

involved the inhibition of AQP‑4, MMP‑9 and phosphorylation of JNK. In conclusion, the results of the present study
indicated that propofol exerts a neuroprotective effect via
protection of the BBB.
