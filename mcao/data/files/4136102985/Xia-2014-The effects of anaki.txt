The inflammatory immune response plays an important role in
the pathophysiological process of cerebral ischemic injury, especially during the enlargement of damage and the secondary damage after cerebral ischemia. There are high cytokine expression
and proinflammatory infiltration in damage area after ischemic
cerebral injury, which aggravates brain injury especially in reperfusion period [1,2]. Interleukin-1b (IL-1b) is an inflammatory factor regulating the complex pathologic changes in acute ischemic
brain injury. Increase in IL-1b mRNA and protein level was
observed after cerebral ischemia–reperfusion. IL-1b plays an
important role in inflammation of focal cerebral ischemia. IL-1b
contributes to brain tissue injury following cerebral ischemia–reperfusion [3,4].
Anakinra, a recombinant, nonglycosylated form of human
interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (rhIL-1ra), is identical to a
native IL-1 receptor antagonist except for a methionine residue
that has been added to the beginning of the amino acid sequence
[5]. Intracerebroventricular injection of IL-1ra (10 mg) significantly reduced the lesion volume after middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) in rats [6]. There are no articles about animal
studies of anakinra being administered i.v. and therapeutic time
window in cerebral ischemia. This study was designed to document the therapeutic effect and therapeutic time window of anakinra after transient focal MCA occlusion and its mechanism at
molecular level.
Male Wistar rats (250–350 g) were divided into 18 groups,
normal groups, sham groups, control groups, and anakinra
groups (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg, i.v.) at 3, 6, or 12 h after ischemia,

respectively. Twenty-four hours after cerebral ischemia, rats
were euthanized and decapitated. The brains were removed,
and then, RNA was extracted. The mRNA primer of intercellular
adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), IL-1b, and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) were
synthesized.
Anakinra decreased infarct percentage and improved neurological deficits induced by MCAO in male Wistar rats dose dependently and time dependently in Figure 1A–C. Significant
difference was found between anakinra 5 mg/kg i.v. at 3 or 6 h
after ischemia and the control group. Similar findings were
observed in anakinra 10 or 20 mg/kg i.v. at 3, 6, or 12 h.
The effect of anakinra on ICAM-1 mRNA, iNOS mRNA, IL-1b
mRNA, and TNF-a mRNA was assessed by semiquantitative
reverse transcription PCR [7]. The integral gray value of normal
group was set as 1, and the values of other groups were expressed
as a ratio versus normal group. As shown in Figure 2A–D, ischemia–reperfusion upregulated ICAM-1, iNOS, IL-1b, and TNF-a
mRNA level. Anakinra 5~20 mg/kg i.v. at 3, 6, or 12 h after ischemia could significantly downregulate their mRNA levels (P < 0.01
or P < 0.05, vs. control group). Results have demonstrated that
anakinra has an inhibitory effect on these overexpression
cytokine.
Anakinra is a kind of biomacromolecule, which is composed of
153 amino acids, and it cannot cross blood–brain barrier by i.v.
administration in normal animals. It has been reported that natural IL-1ra could improve brain injury resulting from focal cerebral
ischemia through cerebral ventricle injection [8]. In this study,

Figure 1 Effects of anakinra on neurological deficits in transient focal MCA occlusion rats. A nylon suture was advanced from the lumen of the ECA into
the ICA to block the origin of the right MCA. After 2 h ischemia, the nylon suture was withdrawn to establish reperfusion. Animals were treated with
shamoperation, or given saline control or 5/10/20 mg/kg. Anakinra was administrated i.v. via the tail vein at 3, 6 or 12 h after occlusion. Twenty-four hours
later, animals were killed and the brains were removed and stained by TTC, which stains viable tissue red but does not stain infarcted tissue. (A)

anakinra can significantly decrease the damage of neural function
and brain tissue by i.v. administration. This result has indicated
that anakinra can cross blood–brain barrier and then generate
therapeutic effects in transient MCAO rats. The center necrotic
region came into being quickly when cerebral ischemia occurred,
but the ischemic penumbra came slowly and lasted for a longer
time. In this study, we have found that anakinra remained having
therapeutic effects at 12 h after ischemia by i.v. administration.
And the therapeutic time window was much longer than that of
known drugs, which had been clinically applied to cure ischemic
stroke. This might be related to the antiinflammatory response
mediated by interleukin of anakinra. From these results, we can
conclude that the drugs with the character of antiinflammatory
response will have longer therapeutic time window against cerebral ischemic injury.
In this study, we have found that the mRNA expression of
ICAM-1, iNOS, IL-1,b and TNF-a was significantly upregulated in
cerebral tissue after ischemia. These results indicated that these
inflammatory factors were involved in the neuronal injury

induced by cerebral ischemia and ischemia–reperfusion. The
mRNA expression of ICAM-1, iNOS, IL-1,b and TNF-a was significantly decreased after intravenous injection of anakinra, which
demonstrated that anakinra could decrease the infiltration of leukocyte and could improve focal perfusion. Anakinra can inhibit
the expression of ICAM-1 and iNOS and decrease the generation
of oxygen free radical and leukocytic infiltration in cerebral ischemia. And then, it would lessen the cerebral injury and the expression of IL-1b and TNF-a, which were induced by ischemic injury.
Therefore, these results indicate that anakinra’s therapeutic effects
might result from the inhibitive effects of IL-1R and the generation of inflammatory cytokine and/or the expression of iNOS and
then inhibit the extension of inflammatory reactions or inflammatory cytotoxicity and toxicity which was induced by oxygen free
radical.

Figure 2 Effects of anakinra on mRNA levels in cerebral tissues after transient focal MCA occlusion in rats. Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) markedly increased
mRNA level in cerebral tissues after IR. Compared with control group, when administrated 3, 6, or 12 h after ischemia, anakinra of three doses (5, 10 or
20 mg/kg, i.v. via the tail vein) significantly decreased (A) ICAM-1 mRNA, (B) iNOS mRNA, (C) IL-1b mRNA, and (D) TNF-a mRNA levels. A: normal; B: sham;
