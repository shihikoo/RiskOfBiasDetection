Abstract
Background: A recent study suggests that patients with persistent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) following
treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) have better outcomes than patients with MCA occlusion
not receiving rt-PA. We performed a study to elucidate possible mechanisms of this finding in a new model of
thromboembolic stroke closely mimicking human pathophysiology.
Methods: Thromboembolic stroke was induced by local injection of thrombin directly into the right MCA of C57 black/6J
mice. Rt-PA was administered 20 and 40 min after clot formation. The efficiency of rt-PA to induce thrombolysis was
measured by laser Doppler. After 24 h, all animals were euthanized and interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, Caspase-3, hsp 32 and hsp 70 protein levels were investigated by immunofluorescence. Presence of hemorrhage was verified and infarct volume was measured using histology.
Results: Thrombin injection resulted in clot formation giving rise to cortical brain infarction. Early rt-PA treatment starting at
20 min after the clot formation resulted in 100% recanalization. However, rt-PA-induced thrombolysis dissolved the clot in
only 38% of the animals when administered 40 min after clot formation. Protein levels of IL-6, TNF-a, MMP-9, Caspase-3, hsp
32 and hsp 70 were increased after MCAO, whereas treatment with rt-PA attenuated the expressions of inflammatory
markers in those animals where the thrombolysis was successful. In addition, the infarct size was significantly reduced with
rt-PA treatment compared to non-treated MCAO, regardless of whether MCA thrombolysis was successful.
Conclusions: The present study demonstrates a clear correlation of the protein expression of inflammatory mediators,
apoptosis and stress genes with the recanalization data after rt-PA treatment. In this model rt-PA treatment decreases the
infarct size regardless of whether vessel recanalization is successful.

metalloproteinases (MMPs) [7], adhesion molecules ICAM-1, Pselectin, E-electin and toxic molecules such as nitric oxide, free
radicals, apoptosis (Caspase 3), and stress genes (hsp 70 and hsp
32) occurs.
The only approved therapy for acute thromboembolic stroke
remains thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen
activator (rt-PA) within the first 4,5 hours after symptom onset
[8–10]. However, recanalization efficacy is far from optimal, as
only 20–40% of the patients treated with rt-PA achieve partial or
full recanalization [11,12]. On the other hand, rt-PA may
provide additional benefits besides clot lysis. Indeed, it was
recently shown that patients receiving rt-PA treatment had a
better outcome even in cases of persistent MCA occlusion as
compared to patients with persistent occlusion not receiving rtPA [13]. This study aims to elucidate possible mechanisms of this

Introduction
Sudden occlusion of a cerebral blood vessel by a thrombus or
embolism initiates a complex process of events that includes
excitotoxity, oxidative stress, microvascular injury, blood brain
barrier dysfunction and postischemic inflammation that ultimately
leads to cell death. Although several mechanisms are involved in
the pathophysiology of stroke, increasing evidence shows that
inflammation is a key contributor to the pathophysiology of
cerebrovascular diseases [1–3] and this correlates with the
outcome of the patient. Inflammation contributes to breakdown
of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which promotes the formation of
brain edema and contributes to acute mortality in stroke [4]. In
the acute phase of stroke activation of cytokines [interleukin-1 beta
(IL-1ß), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa)] [5], chemokines [monocyte chemostatic protein-1 (MCP-1)
and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha], [6] matrix

(20–30 g) as originally described by Orset et al [14]. The mice
were anaesthetized using 5% isoflurane and thereafter maintained
with 1–2% isoflurane during the surgical procedure. An electric
temperature probe was inserted into the rectum of the mouse to
record the temperature, and found to be maintained at 37uC. A
catheter was placed in the tail vein to allow the intravenous
administration (200 ml) of vehicle or rt-PA.
The mice were placed in a stereotaxic device and the temporal
muscle was retracted. A small craniotomy was performed, the dura
was excised, and the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was exposed.
The laser Doppler flow probe to measure cortical CBF was placed
on the skull in the MCA territory. Finally, a micropipette filled
with 1 ml of purified murine alpha-thrombin (1.5 UI) was
introduced into the lumen of the MCA bifurcation and injected
carefully to induce the formation of a clot in situ. The pipette was
removed 10 minutes after the injection at which time the clot had

CBF was measured throughout the duration of the experiment
(135 min). After 24 hours mice were euthanized and the brains
were removed and frozen in isopentane.

CBF velocity was measured continuously by laser Doppler
flowmetry allowing determination of spontaneous clot dissolution.
A clot was defined as successful when the cerebral blood velocity
decreased to a minimum of 60% from baseline at the time of
thrombin injection and remained stable during at least 20 minutes.
To induce thrombolysis, rt-PA (10 mg/kg;Actilyse) was intravenously administrated 20 or 40 minutes after thrombin injection. It
was injected as 10% bolus and 90% perfusion during 40 minutes.
The ability of rt-PA to induce thrombolysis was defined as effective
when the cerebral blood flow returned to 60–100% of basal values.

They were then sectioned into 10 mm thick slices in a cryostat.
The cerebral cryosections were fixed for 10 minutes in ice cold
acetone and thereafter rehydrated in phosphate buffer solution
(PBS) containing 0.25% Triton X-100 for 15 minutes. The tissue
was then permeabilized and blocked for 1 hour in blocking
solution containing PBS, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1% BSA and 5%
normal donkey serum. The sections were incubated over night at
4uC with the following primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal IL-6
(Abcam, ab6672), diluted 1:200, rabbit polyclonal hsp 32 (Abcam,
ab13243), diluted 1:50, rabbit polyclonal hsp 70 (Abcam, ab2787),
diluted 1:50, rabbit polyclonal Caspase 3 (Abcam, ab4051), diluted
1:50, rabbit polyclonal TNF-a (Abcam, ab6671), diluted 1:200,
rabbit polyclonal MMP9 (Abcam, ab7299), diluted 1:400. All
dilutions were done in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X- 100, BSA
1% and 2% normal goat serum. Sections were subsequently
washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody for 1
hour at room temperature. The secondary antibody used was
goat-antirabbit Alexa 488 conjugated (Invitrogen), diluted 1:400 in
PBS containing 0.2% TritonX-100 and BSA 1%. In addition,
double staining with DAPI (KPL) 1:5000 was performed. The
sections were washed subsequently with PBS and mounted with
mounting medium (Moviol). The same procedure was used for the
negative controls but primary antibodies were omitted. The
immunoreactivity of the antibodies were visualized and photographed with a Nikon confocal microscope A1R fitted with
fluorescence optics at the appropriated wavelength.
Immunohistochemistry images were analysed using the ImageJ
software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). The fluorescence in different
areas in each section was measured and a mean value was
calculated. The ROI for the ipsilateral and contralateral sides was
identical. These values are presented as percentage fluorescence in

(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). With the experimental setup and the described protocol it is possible to acquire
T2- weighted images, ADC maps and TOF-MIPs within a
measurement time of 28 min.

Determination of Infarct Size
All animals were euthanized 24 hours after ischemia. Postmortem, 10 mm coronal cryosections were cut at 400 mm intervals and
stained with the high contrast silver infarct method [16]. Focal
edema in the ischemic hemisphere was determined according to
Swanson et al [17]. Photographs of each coronal section were
taken and analyzed using Image J. In addition, MRI was used
exemplarily.

Histological Examination
To evaluate the presence of hemorrhage after rt-PA treatment
cresyl violet (Nissl staining) and diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining
was performed on 10 mm coronal cryosections. In addition,
hematoxylin-eosin-saffron staining was carried out for further
neuropathological analysis. The neurons in the ischemic area were
classified as intact or necrotic. The neurons were classified as
necrotic when the cell showed swelling and demonstrated
karyolysis, pyknosis, karyorhexis, cytoplasmic eosinophilia or loss
of affinity for hematoxylin [18–20].

(Figure 2a). However, rt-PA-induced thrombolysis only dissolves
the clot in 38% of the animals (n = 8) when administered 40 min
after clot formation (Figure 2a, b).

Discussion
The present study demonstrates a clear correlation of the
functional CBF data and protein expression of inflammatory
mediators, apoptosis and stress genes after rt-PA treatment.
MCAO significantly increase the activation of IL-6, TNF-a, hsp
70 and Caspase-3. However this activation of protein expression
did not occur in those animals that recanalized with rt-PA
treatment as opposed to animals that showed no recanalization
after rt-PA treatment. Quite intriguing is our observation that
inhibition of the inflammatory factors, stress genes and apoptosis
correlates with CBF. Furthermore, the infarct sizes do not
correlate with the CBF data. As in the human situation there is
a significant decrease in infarct size in all animals treated with rtPA regardless of whether thrombolysis was successful or not [13].
These data indicate that even if we cannot observe a recanalization after rt-PA treatment it still has an effect. We postulate that
this effect is mediated through an improvement in microcirculatory flow, which appears to be below the threshold for detection by
laser Doppler. This is in agreement with the data reported by
Nedelmann et al, which demonstrates that rt-PA treatment both
alone and in combination with contrast-enhanced ultrasound
provides beneficial effects at the level of the microvasculature [21].
Previous experimental studies have demonstrated that ‘‘no reflow’’
of the microvascular compartment promotes infarct development
after MCAO [22,23]. Even low doses of rt-PA might be beneficial
since it might affect the infarct size which in turn can affect the
functional outcome. In an experimental study with the intraluminal transient MCAO model in rats it was demonstrated that low
doses of rt-PA (2,5–7,5 mg/kg) reduced the infarct volume,
diminished the activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and
decreased blood-brain barrier disruption. However, the degree of
which thrombolytic therapy may improve the functional outcome
is uncertain in this model. In patients receiving rt-PA treatment a
better outcome was shown even if the MCA remained occluded
[13]. Garcı́a-Yebenes et al [24] found that the infarct size is
dependent on reperfusion (62% of animals) after treatment with rtPA given 20 minutes after induction of MCAO. In our study we
rather obtained 100% reperfusion when rt-PA was administered at
the same time point. However, when giving rt-PA at 40 minutes
after MCAO, we observed a reduction of infarct size independent
of persistent occlusion or vessel reperfusion. Apart from different
times of rt-PA administration, the different results in these studies
may be related to the use of the thromboembolic model in
different mouse strains with possible differences in the efficacy of
rt-PA or variable tissue collateralization. Our recanalization data is
in agreement with the clinical situation where only 20–40% of the
patients receiving rt-PA treatment recanalize [25,26].

Effect of rt-PA on Infarct Volume
Injection of thrombin resulted in an infarct that was restricted to
the cortex with a mean lesion volume of 38,467,5 mm3.
Treatment with rt-PA resulted in a significant reduction in infarct
size in all groups, regardless of whether MCA thrombolysis was
successful or not. (Figure 3). No edema was detected for any of the
groups.

Effect of rt-PA on Hemorrhage
Hemorrhages were examined histologically by Nissl and
diaminobenzidine staining. In the MCAO group 78% of the
animals showed no haemorrhage, while in the other 22% of the
animals only very mild signs of hemorrhage were seen at 24 hours
after stroke onset. Tissues of the group treated with rt-PA 20
minutes after clot formation showed similar results as the MCAO
group, with mild signs of hemorrhage in 25% of the animals and
no hemorrhage in 75% of the animals. Administration of rt-PA 40
minutes after clot formation resulted in mild signs of bleeding in
42% of the animals and no hemorrhage in 58% of the animals.
The mild bleeding was similar in all groups examined, and mainly
detected in the boundary of the infarct.

Effect of rt-PA on Inflammation, Stress Factors,
Metalloproteinase and Apoptosis
The localization and activation of the protein levels were
examined by confocal microscopy and immunocytochemistry
using selective antibodies towards inflammatory mediators (IL-6,
TNF-a), apoptosis (Caspase 3) metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and
stress factors (hsp 70, hsp 32. Double immunohistochemistry
staining versus nucleus, were performed to verify the localization.
IL-6, TNF- a, Caspase-3 and hsp 70 protein expressions were
significantly increased in the infarct area as compared to the
contralateral side (Table 1, Figures 4 and 5). There was a tendency
of increase of MMP-9 and hsp 32 protein expression in the
MCAO, however it was not significant. Treatment with rt-PA
starting with administration at 20 min after stroke reduced the
stroke-induced activation of IL-6, TNF-a, Caspase 3, hsp 32, hsp
70 and MMP-9 significantly in the MCAO. Similar results were
obtained with rt-PA treatment starting at 40 min after MCAO in
those animals that recanalized after rt-PA treatment (Table 1,
Figures 4 and 5). The inflammatory factors, apoptosis and stress
genes that are activated after MCAO were not reduced by rt-PA
treatment in those animals that did not recanalize after the
treatment. (Table 1, Figures 4 and 5).

Response to rt-PA in Thromboembolic Stroke Model

Several experimental studies have documented deleterious
effects of rt-PA, which may offset the beneficial effects of rt-PA
upon the microcirculation that we have observed in this study.
These include interactions of rt-PA with the low density
lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), the N-methyl–aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and annexin-II both in glial cells and in
neurons resulting in parenchymal cell death [27]. Further evidence
indicates that rt-PA mediates an increase in the permeability/
leakage of the BBB [28]. Clinically, the most serious complications
after rt-PA treatment are hemorrhage and blood-brain barrier
breakdown [28]. Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion leads to release of
pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-a and IL-6) which in turns
leads to production of MMP by resident and infiltrating cells,
which altogether increase BBB permeability [29]. One marker for
BBB permeability is MMP-9 and studies have shown that MMP-9
is responsible for rt-PA induced parenchymal hemorrhages after
stroke. Our results indicate that there is a tendency of increased
MMP-9 after MCAO, which is significantly reduced after rt-PA
treatment given at 20 min after induction of MCAO. However, rtPA treatment after 40 min decreased the protein levels of MMP-9,
but not significantly as compared to MCAO. We did not observe
any increase in BBB permeability after rt-PA treatment at 20 or
40 min after MCAO.
A limitation of our study is the lack of definitive information on
the status of the microcirculation following treatment with rt-PA.
Application of MR perfusion-weighted imaging and arterial spin

labeling techniques could provide more insight into understanding
the pathophysiology of perfusion changes during persistent MCA
occlusion under rt-PA therapy. However, MRI may not have the
spatial resolution needed to visualize and quantify changes in the
microvasculature [30]. High-resolution 3D nano-CT imaging,
which allows analysis of the vasculature in microscopic detail [31],
may be useful for quantification of alterations in the cerebral
microcirculation after rt-PA therapy [21]. The simultaneous
implementation of such imaging procedures with laser Doppler
monitoring of CBF was not technically feasible in our study,
however.
In conclusion, this study shows that rt-PA treatment decreases
ischemic lesion volume, which indicates that the success of
thrombolysis therapy is not limited to the recanalization of the
arterial main stem occlusion. In addition, there is a clear
correlation between the protein expression of inflammatory
mediators, apoptosis and stress genes with the recanalization data
after rt-PA treatment.
