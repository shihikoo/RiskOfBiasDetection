Abstract Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) has been demonstrated to provide a neuroprotection against brain damage
produced by focal cerebral ischemia. However, it is elusive
whether ischemic preconditioning attenuates ischemic brain
damage through modulating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/
Akt (PI3K/Akt) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2
(ERK1/2) signaling pathway. In the present study, we first
explored the best scheme of repetitive ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) to protect rat brain against ischemic damage and
then further investigated the underlying mechanisms in
RIPC’s neuroprotection. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats
underwent ischemic preconditioning or (and) middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO). LY294002 or (and) PD98059 were
injected intracerebroventricularly to selectively inhibit the
activation of PI3K/Akt or ERK1/2. Neurological deficit
scores, cerebral infarct volume, and morphological characteristic were detected at corresponding time after cerebral ischemia. The enzymatic activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was
measured 24 h after cerebral ischemia. Expressions of p-Akt,
t-Akt, p-ERK1/2, t-ERK1/2, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)
p65, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in ischemic brain were
determined by Western blot. The release of tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α) in blood was examined by ELISA. In the
various schemes of RIPC, IPC2×5 min causes less neuronal
damage in the cortex and subcortex of ischemic brain and
provides an obvious alleviation of cerebral infarction and
neurological deficit after lethal ischemia. IPC2×5 min significantly reduces cerebral infarct volume, neurological deficit

scores, and MPO activity; all of which were diminished by
LY294002 or (and) PD98059. IPC2×5 min significantly
upregulates the expressions of p-Akt and p-ERK1/2, which
were inhibited by LY294002 or (and) PD98059. IPC2×5 min
significantly downregulates the expressions of NF-κB p65
and COX-2 and attenuates the release of TNF-α; all of which
were abolished by LY294002 or (and) PD98059. IPC2×5 min
is the best scheme of RIPC to protect rat brain against cerebral
ischemia. IPC2×5 min attenuates brain damage in rats subjected to lethal ischemia, and this neuroprotection is associated with inhibition of neuroinflammation through modulating
PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathway.

Introduction
Cerebral ischemia produced by transient or permanent focal
cerebral ischemia develops a series of pathological processes
that results in mediating ischemic brain damage. Postischemic neuroinflammation has been demonstrated to be
involved in the process of ischemic brain damage, eventually
leading to the aggravation of neuronal damage and extension
of cerebral infarction (Cuartero et al. 2013). Inhibition of
inflammatory reaction and the expression of inflammatory
mediators have been reported to play a neuroprotection
against brain damage following an ischemic stroke (Liesz
et al. 2013). Inflammation has been considered to be an
important therapeutic target for acute ischemic stroke (del
Zoppo 2010).
Several reports demonstrated that ischemic preconditioning (IPC) reduces ischemia-induced brain damage after permanent of transient focal cerebral ischemia (Sommer 2008;
Thompson et al. 2013; Zhan et al. 2013). Various schemes of
IPC have been reported to induce ischemic tolerance and
protect brain against ischemic damage. To our best knowledge, however, whether repetitive ischemic preconditioning
(RIPC) provides more neuroprotection than IPC remains unknown until now.
Moreover, the neuroprotective mechanisms of IPC against
ischemic brain damage also needed further investigation in the
future. Thompson et al. (2012) showed that IPC attenuates
ischemia-induced brain damage via inhibiting the oxidative
stress. Xia et al. (2013) demonstrated that hypoxic preconditioning exits a neuroprotective role in a rat cerebral ischemic
injury model through autophagy activation and apoptosis
inhibition. Zhang et al. (2006) showed that IPC reduces ischemic brain damage by increasing the expression of matrix
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and improving the blood-brain
barrier (BBB) permeability in rat brain. However, never was
explored that whether RIPC attenuates ischemic brain damage
by inhibiting inflammatory reaction.
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) pathway
and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway are the two most important signaling pathways involved
in the neuroprotection against ischemic brain damage, likely
playing a critical role in promoting neuronal survival after
ischemia (Kilic et al. 2005; Zhu et al. 2013). Classically, the
neuroprotective properties of PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 have
been primarily attributed to the anti-apoptotic actions (Sirén

913

et al. 2001) or the anti-oxidative actions (Wang et al. 2012).
Leptin was demonstrated to protect against ischemic neuronal
death in rat hippocampal CA1 by activating the pro-survival
states of PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways (Zhang
and Chen 2008).
In the present study, we demonstrated that RIPC exerts a
neuroprotective role in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia.
Then, we explored the inhibitory effect of RIPC on neuroinflammation following an experimental stroke. To further confirm the molecular mechanisms underlying the RIPC’s neuroprotection and anti-neuroinflammation, we investigated
whether RIPC attenuates the inflammatory reaction in rat
brain by activating PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. The expressions of downstream inflammatory mediators were also determined.

Materials and Methods
Animals and Experimental Design Flow
All animal experiments were conducted according to the
National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats
weighing 250–300 g were obtained from Shanghai
Laboratory Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Animals were housed in a colony room under controlled
temperature (22 °C) and a 12:12 light-dark cycle, with food
and water available. The flow of experimental designs is
present in Figs. 1 and 2.

IPC Schemes
To explore which RIPC was the best scheme of RIPC
protecting rat brain against focal cerebral ischemia, the experimental design was separated into two parts (Fig. 1). In the
first part, to observe the histopathological characteristic produced by various RIPC schemes, adult male SD rats
underwent different cerebral IPC by occluding bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) involved repeatedly in transient
cerebral ischemia with a 15 min intermission, which includes
sham IPC, IPC 1×5 min, IPC 2×5 min, IPC 3×5 min, and
IPC 1×15 min groups. Then, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining
were performed 72 h after simple IPC. In the second part, to
explore the best scheme of RIPC against ischemic brain
damage, SD rats received various sublethal IPC schemes
respectively and then underwent lethal middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) after 48-h reperfusion. Neurological deficit scores and cerebral infarct volume were measured 24 h
after lethal ischemia.

schemes by occluding bilateral CCA involved repeatedly transient cerebral ischemia with a 15-min intermission, including sham IPC, IPC 1×
5 min, IPC 2×5 min, IPC 3×5 min, and IPC 1×15 min groups. Then,

cerebral infarction and neuronal injury were estimated 72 h after IPC. In
the second part, rats that received various IPC schemes were subjected to
lethal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) after 48-h reperfusion.
Neurological deficit scores (NDS) and cerebral infarct volume were
measured 24 h after lethal ischemia

MCAO

filament was inserted only 10 mm and withdrawn a minute
later. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37.0 °C with a
heating pad and warm light during the surgical procedure.

After 48-h reperfusion, rats were anesthetized again with an
intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg) and
subjected to MCAO as described previously (Shi et al. 2013).
In brief, the right CCA, external carotid artery (ECA), and
internal carotid artery (ICA) were carefully exposed. A monofilament suture with a distal cylinder (0.32 mm in diameter)
was inserted from the ECA into the ICA and advanced to
occlude the origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The
sham-control rats underwent the same surgery, except that the

To investigate whether PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling mediates the IPC’s neuroprotection, LY294002 (selective Akt
inhibitor) or PD98059 (selective ERK1/2 inhibitor) was
injected intracerebroventricularly 15 min before IPC to inhibit
PI3K/Akt or ERK1/2 signaling pathway (Fig. 2). In brief,

produced by occluding bilateral common carotid artery twice with a 15min intermission. After 48-h reperfusion, rats were subjected to middle
cerebral artery occlusion. Twenty-four hours after lethal ischemia, the rats
were sacrificed and rat brains were collected

J Mol Neurosci (2015) 55:912–922

LY294002 or PD98059 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and diluted with PBS to 10 μM. With use of a
stereotaxic device (Reward, Shenzhen, China), 10 μL of
LY294002 or (and) PD98059 solution was injected into the
right ventricle of rats. The stereotactic intracerebroventricular
(ICV) injection site was chosen at the following sites from
bregma: anteroposterior, 0.8 mm; lateral, 1.5 mm; and depth,
3.5 mm.
Histological Examination
After 72 h of IPC, rats were anesthetized and perfused with
4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Then,
brains were removed, fixed, and embedded in paraffin.
Coronal sections (4 μm thick) were obtained from embedded
paraffin and deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with
graded alcohol. To detect whether simple IPC produces neuronal damage, HE staining was performed to observe the
morphological characteristic of neurons in the cortex and
subcortex of rat brains.
TTC Staining
To detect whether simple IPC produces cerebral infarction in
the cortex and subcortex of rat brains. After 72 h of IPC, rats
were sacrificed and brains were rapidly removed and
coronally sliced into 2.0-mm-thick sections. Brain slices were
incubated in 2 % TTC for 20 min. The infarcted brain tissue
will appear white, whereas the noninfarcted region will appear
red.
Assessment of Neurological Deficit Scores
Neurological deficit scores were estimated at 24 h after lethal
ischemia according to the previous method described by
Bederson et al. (1986), as follows: 0, no observable deficit;
1, contralateral forelimb flexion; 2, decreased resistance to
lateral push without circling; and 3, circling to the contralateral side.
Assessment of Cerebral Infarct Volume
Rats were sacrificed under deep anesthesia, and brains were
rapidly removed and coronally sliced into 2.0-mm-thick sections. Brain slices were incubated in 2 % TTC for 20 min. The
infarcted brain tissue appeared white, whereas the
noninfarcted region appeared red. The sections were digitized,
and the infarct areas were measured using Photoshop software
by tracing around the white area in each brain section. Infarct
volume was calculated according to the following formula:
V=t×(A1 +A2 +. . . An). V is the infarct volume, t is the
thickness of slice, and A is the infarct area. Correction for

915

edema of infarct area was performed as described by Lin et al.
(1993).
Biochemical Analysis
The neutrophil infiltration, an index of neuroinflammation in
ischemic brain, was determined by measuring the enzymatic
activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO). The activity of MPO in
rat brain was measured according to the manufacturer’s instructions from the assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng
Bioengineering Institute, China). The results were expressed
as units per gram tissue.
Western Blot
Samples from ischemic brain were used for experiments, and
total protein was extracted using protein extraction kit
(Beyotime Biotech. CO., China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein samples (50 μg) were separated on
10 % SDS polyacrylamide gels, then transferred to nitrocellulose (NC) membranes, and blocked in 5 % nonfat dry milk
buffer. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with
a rabbit polyclonal antibody against p-Akt (1:200, Santa Cruz,
USA), or a rabbit polyclonal antibody against t-Akt (1:1,000,
Santa Cruz, USA), or a mouse monoclonal antibody against pERK1/2 (1:1,000, Santa Cruz, USA), or a rabbit polyclonal
antibody against t-ERK1/2 (1:2,000, Santa Cruz, USA), or a
mouse monoclonal antibody against NF-κB p65 (1:200, Santa
Cruz, USA), or a rabbit polyclonal antibody against COX-2
(1:200, Wuhan Boster Biological Technology, LTD, Wuhan,
Chian), followed by incubation with horseradish-peroxidase
conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2,000, KPL Inc.). Protein
expression was detected with an ECL detection system and
exposed on an X-ray film. GAPDH was used as a loading
control. The optical densities of protein bands on the X-ray
film were quantitatively analyzed with Quantity One software.
ELISA Assay
After 24 h of lethal ischemia, blood samples (1 ml) were
drawn from femoral vein of rats. After centrifugation at
3,000 r/min for 15 min, the supernatant was collected
and stored at −80 °C in the refrigerator. Serum level
of TNF-α was measured using a rat TNF-α immunoassay enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits
(R&D system).
Statistical Analysis
Experimental data were presented as mean±SD. Statistical
analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by LSD test
for individual comparisons between group means. A value of
P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

rat brains, TTC staining and HE staining were performed 72 h
after simple RIPC. Experimental results showed that IPC 1×

IPC1×5 min (P>0.05, Fig. 4c). All of IPC1×5 min, IPC2×
5 min, IPC3×5 min, and IPC1×15 min could significantly
reduce cerebral infarct volume after cerebral ischemia (P<0.05
or P<0.01, Fig. 4b). Cortex infarction was significantly reduced

To investigate the potential roles of PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2
signaling pathway in the IPC2×5 min neuroprotection against
ischemic brain damage, LY294002 (selective Akt inhibitor) or

intracerebroventricularly to inhibit the activation of PI3K/Akt
or ERK1/2 signaling. The experimental results showed that
IPC2×5 min reduced cerebral infarct volume in rats after focal
cerebral ischemia (P<0.01, Fig. 5a), which was abolished by
administration of LY294002 or (and) PD98059 (P<0.05 or
P<0.01, Fig. 5b), demonstrating that IPC2×5 min provides a
neuroprotective role in cerebral ischemia through modulating
PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathway. IPC2×5 min reduced
neurological deficit scores in rats after focal cerebral ischemia

Time-Course Expression of PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 in Rats
of Focal Cerebral Ischemia
Experimental results showed that the expression of p-Akt was
upregulated 12 h after cerebral ischemia (P<0.01) and then
downregulated 24–72 h (P<0.01, Fig. 6). The expression of pERK1/2 was upregulated 6 h in ischemic rat brains (P<0.01)
and decreased 12–72 h after cerebral ischemia (P<0.01,
Fig. 6). The expressions of t-Akt and t-ERK1/2 were sustained
from 6 to 72 h after cerebral ischemia (P>0.05).

and p-ERK1/2 in rat brain (P < 0.01), both of which
were abolished by administration of LY294002 or (and)
PD98059 (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01, Fig. 7), demonstrating
that LY294002 and PD98059 could inhibit the activation of PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 in rats of cerebral ischemia, respectively. The expressions of t-Akt and tERK1/2 were not changed.

The enzymatic activity of MPO was measured as an
indicator of the accumulation of granulocytes and neuroinflammation in ischemic brain. MCAO caused the

Discussion

IPC2×5 min downregulated the over-expression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 and cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2) in rat brain produced by ischemic stroke
(P<0.01), both of which were inhibited by administration of LY294002 or (and) PD98059 (P < 0.05 or
P<0.01, Fig. 9).
IPC2×5 min Decreases the Release of TNF-α in Blood via
PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 Signaling Pathway
MCAO caused the elevated release of TNF-α in blood 24 h
after focal cerebral ischemia (P<0.01). IPC2×5 min decreased the release of TNF-α in blood (P<0.01), which was
significantly inhibited by administration of LY294002, but not
PD98059 (P<0.05 or P<0.01, Fig. 10).

Stroke is the second to third most common cause of mortality
and the leading cause of adult neurological disability.
Thrombolytic therapy (TT) and neuroprotective therapy
(NT) are the two most important treatments for acute ischemic
stroke (AIS) (Durukan and Tatlisumak 2007). In the ischemic
penumbra surrounding the infarct core following an ischemic
stroke, neuronal viability is time-dependent (Smith 2004). To
date, tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) is the only FDAapproved thrombolytic therapeutic drug for AIS within a
3–4.5-h time window (Hacke et al. 2008; Chavez et al.
2009). However, only 1.8–2.1 % of patients receive
thrombolytic therapy in USA, which might be attributed
to the short time window (Kleindorfer et al. 2008). In
animal models of AIS, neuroprotective therapy targeted at
enhancing neuronal viability to widen the time window of
thrombolytic therapy has been investigated (Fisher and
Albers 2013).

Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) has been widely reported
to reduce ischemia-induced brain damage after focal cerebral
ischemia (Sommer 2008; Thompson et al. 2013; Zhan et al.
2013). To our best knowledge, however, it is unknown whether repetitive IPC (RIPC) also provides a neuroprotective effect
against permanent focal cerebral ischemia. In the present
study, we first demonstrated that various RIPCs exert neuroprotective effect in rats of permanent focal cerebral ischemia.
IPC2×5 min is the best scheme of RIPCs to protect rat brain
against cerebral ischemia. Moreover, IPC2×5 min reduces
neuronal injury more obviously than other RIPC schemes.
Neuroinflammation, one of the most important pathological mechanisms in the process of ischemia-induced brain
damage, has been widely considered to be the major therapeutic target for ischemic stroke. Previous studies from our
laboratory demonstrated that inhibition of inflammatory reaction would reduce ischemic brain damage in rats of focal
cerebral ischemia (Tu et al. 2009, 2010a, 2011). Ischemic
preconditioning has been demonstrated to exert a protective

et al. 2010), renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (Kinsey et al.

(Aksöyek et al. 2002), limb ischemia-reperfusion injury
(Mansour et al. 2012), and acute pancreatitis (Warzecha
et al. 2007). Bowen et al. (2006) showed that IPC induced
neuroprotection against focal cerebral ischemia by preventing
inflammatory reaction. The present study showed that a novel
ischemic preconditioning scheme, repetitive IPC, attenuates
the enzymatic activities of MPO in ischemic rat brain, suggesting that RIPC’s neuroprotection might be associated with
the inhibition of neuroinflammation.

release of TNF-α in blood, which was inhibited by administration of
LY294002, but not PD98059. n=6, *P<0.05, and **P<0.01 compared
to IPC2×5 min group

(Thompson et al. 2012), inhibiting neuronal apoptosis (Xia
et al. 2013), attenuating ubiquitin aggregation (Lee et al.
2014), and improving the blood-brain barrier permeability
(Zhang et al. 2006). IPC was reported to attenuate ischemic
injury of the neuron or brain by activating PI3K/Akt signaling
pathway in vitro and in vivo (Bhuiyan et al. 2011; Prasad et al.
2011; Gao et al. 2010). Similarly, IPC was also reported to
protect brain damage by activating ERK1/2 signaling pathway
following an experimental stroke (Jones and Bergeron 2004;
Autheman et al. 2012). The present study showed that IPC2×
5 min attenuates neurological deficit scores, cerebral infarct
volume, and the enzymatic activity of MPO in rats subjected
to focal cerebral ischemia, which were abolished by administration of LY294002 or (and) PD98059, suggesting that PI3K/
Akt and ERK1/2 mediates IPC2×5 min neuroprotection and
anti-neuroinflammation.
To further explore the molecular mechanisms underlying
RIPC’s anti-neuroinflammation, we detected the expression
changes of inflammatory mediators that involved in the pathological process of ischemic brain damage under the inhibitory condition of PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2. NF-κB signaling
pathway, which initiates the expression of inflammatory genes
and leads to expansion of cerebral infarction, has been considered to be an important therapeutic target for ischemic
stroke (Dong et al. 2013). Inflammatory mediators such as
COX-2 and TNF-α were the downstream signaling of NF-κB
pathway. NF-κB has been shown to regulate the expression of
COX-2 and TNF-α that contributes to the evolution of ischemic brain damage (Tu et al. 2010b). Attenuation of COX-2
expression and TNF-α production has been demonstrated to
protect brain against ischemic damage (Zhou et al. 2013). The
present study showed that IPC2×5 min attenuates the NF-κB
activation, COX-2 expression, and TNF-α release in rats
subjected to focal cerebral ischemia, all of which were

J Mol Neurosci (2015) 55:912–922

inhibited by administration of LY294002 or (and) PD98059,
suggesting that IPC2×5 min inhibits the expression and activation of inflammatory mediators through activating
PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathway.

Conclusions
The present studies were performed to evaluate the effect of
repetitive ischemic preconditioning on focal cerebral ischemia
in rats. In the first stage of research, we found that IPC2×
5 min is the best scheme of RIPCs to protect rat brain against
focal cerebral ischemia. Then, we found that IPC2×5 min
reduces ischemic brain damage and neuroinflammation via
modulating PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathway.
Furthermore, IPC2 × 5 min attenuates the expression of
NF-κB/COX-2/TNF-α inflammatory pathway through activating PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathway. These results suggest that PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathway
might be the therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke in the
future.
