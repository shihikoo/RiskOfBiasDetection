Abstract
Introduction: Intra-arterial cell infusion is an efficient delivery route with which to target organs such as the
ischemic brain. However, adverse events including microembolisms and decreased cerebral blood flow were
recently reported after intra-arterial cell delivery in rodent models, raising safety concerns. We tested the hypothesis
that cell dose, infusion volume, and velocity would be related to the severity of complications after intra-arterial cell
delivery.
Methods: In this study, 38 rats were subjected to a sham middle cerebral artery occlusion (sham-MCAO) procedure
before being infused with allogeneic bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cells at different cell doses (0 to 1.0 × 106),
infusion volumes (0.5 to 1.0 ml), and infusion times (3 to 6 minutes). An additional group (n = 4) was infused with
1.0 × 106 cells labeled with iron oxide for in vivo tracking of cells. Cells were infused through the external carotid
artery under laser Doppler flowmetry monitoring 48 hours after sham-MCAO. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
was performed 24 hours after cell infusion to reveal cerebral embolisms or hemorrhage. Limb placing, cylinder, and
open field tests were conducted to assess sensorimotor functions before the rats were perfused for histology.
Results: A cell dose-related reduction in cerebral blood flow was noted, as well as an increase in embolic events
and concomitant lesion size, and sensorimotor impairment. In addition, a low infusion velocity (0.5 ml/6 minutes)
was associated with high rate of complications. Lesions on MRI were confirmed with histology and corresponded
to necrotic cell loss and blood-brain barrier leakage.
Conclusions: Particularly cell dose but also infusion velocity contribute to complications encountered after
intra-arterial cell transplantation. This should be considered before planning efficacy studies in rats and, potentially,
in patients with stroke.

Introduction
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and chronic
disability in adults in the industrialized countries. Only
limited treatment options are available in the acute
phase of stroke. Thrombolysis is the only established
treatment, but is hampered by the narrow time window

of 4.5 hours and very strict indications [1], thus leaving
more than 90% of patients untreated.
Cell-based therapy is a promising experimental approach to enhance poststroke recovery. Positive treatment effects have been seen in stroke models by using
different sources of cells and different delivery routes
[2]. In particular, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are
safely and readily obtainable [3,4]. Several delivery routes
are available, but the intravenous transplantation technique is the most commonly used in both preclinical
and clinical trials [5-8]. However, the current treatment

strategies are far from optimal. For example, most of the
infused cells are rapidly trapped in the lung, followed by
their relocation to the internal organs [8,9]. The pulmonary circulation can be circumvented by giving an
intra-arterial infusion to increase the cell homing to the
ischemic hemisphere, which has been claimed to enhance therapeutic outcome [10-12]. However, some adverse events related to intra-arterial cell infusion, such
as micro-occlusions, have been reported [12,13], raising
safety concerns. Therefore, a careful optimization of the
intra-arterial infusion procedures is needed before efficacy studies.
The complications encountered after intra-arterial stem
cell transplantation seem to depend, to some extent at
least, on the infusion technique, cell size, and infusion
velocity [14,15]. Janowski et al. [15] proposed that cell size
and infusion velocity would be major determinants of
micro-occlusion after intra-arterial cell injection, whereas
cell dose should be adjusted when using different types of
cells. In this study, we hypothesized that (a) complications
of intra-arterial cell delivery would be dose dependent
(that is, a lower cell dose would be safer for cell delivery);
and (b) complications would be related to both infusion
volume and velocity (that is, extending the infusion
volume or time might mitigate some of the complications). A safety assessment was performed with laser
Doppler flowmetry (LDF), magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), behavioral testing, and histology.

Methods
Animals

Forty-two adult male RccHan:Wistar rats (249 to 306 g;
Laboratory Animal Centre, Kuopio, Finland) were maintained in a controlled environment (temperature, 20°C ±
1°C; humidity, 50% to 60%; light period, 07:00 to 19:00),
with free access to food (2016S, Teklad) and water
throughout the experiment. Animal care procedures
were conducted according to the guidelines set by the
European Community Council Directives 86/609/EEC,
and this work was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee (Hämeenlinna, Finland).

NCR cryopreservation medium (Cyagen Biosciences Inc.,
Cat.No. NCPF-10001). The cryopreserved cells were
thawed in a water bath at 37°C before being decanted
into the thawing medium containing α-MEM (Life
Technologies Ltd., Cat. No. 41061-029) and 10% human
serum albumin (octapharma, albunorm™). The cells
were centrifuged, and medium was removed. The cells
were then resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), and trypan blue staining was used to determine
cell viability and number by Countess™ automated cell
counter (Invitrogen, Cat.No. C10281). For in vivo MRI
tracking of transplanted cells, cells were incubated overnight with 25 μg/ml Molday ION Rhodamine B (BioPAL, CL-50Q02-6A-50), a superparamagnetic iron
oxide formulation. The labeling efficiency was confirmed by Zeiss Axio inverted fluorescent microscope
(Vert.A1).

Sham-operation

The in vivo study design is shown in Figure 1. All rats
were sham-operated to mimic the procedure of the
filament-induced middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO). Under isoflurane anesthesia (2.0% to 2.5%) in
30% O2 and 70% N2O, the right common carotid artery
(CCA), external carotid artery (ECA), and internal carotid artery (ICA) were exposed. The ECA was then cut
with microscissors, and a heparinized nylon filament of
0.35 mm diameter was inserted into the stump of the
ECA and advanced into the ICA. The filament was immediately retracted and the ECA was carefully closed by
electrocoagulation, leaving a long ECA stump for cell infusion. Buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg) was administered to
relieve postoperative pain.

Preparation and characterization of rat bone marrow
mesenchymal stem cells for transplantation

Oricell™ male Wistar rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem
cells (BMMSCs; Cyagen Biosciences, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA,
USA; Cat. No. RAWMX-01001, passage 2) were cultured
according to the manufacturer’s instructions in OriCell
MSC growth medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (all
reagents from Cyagen Biosciences Inc., Cat. No. GUXMX90011). The medium was changed twice weekly, and cells
were passaged when subconfluent (80% to 90% confluence).
Rat BMMSCs (p5) were cryopreserved in the OriCell™

Figure 1 Study design. Cells were transplanted 48 hours after the
sham-operation, and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) was used to
monitor the cerebral blood flow during the infusion. MRI was
performed on postoperative day 3, followed by the limb-placing test,
the cylinder test, and the open field test. At the end, rats were
perfused for histology.

Intra-arterial cell transplantation

Forty-eight hours after the sham-operation, rats were infused with different doses of rat BMMSCs (0.25 × 106,
0.5 × 106, and 1.0 × 106; n = 6 per group) in 0.5 ml PBS
during 3 minutes through the stump of the ECA with
the blood flow maintained in the ICA. Control subjects
(n = 8) were infused with 0.5 ml PBS. The infusion
needle was removed after transplantation, and the ECA
stump was electrocoagulated. An additional group of
rats (n = 4) was infused with 1.0 × 106 iron-labeled cells
in 0.5 ml PBS within 3 minutes before MRI tracking. To
explore the effects of infusion volume and velocity, 0.5 ×
106 cells were infused in 0.5 ml over either 3 minutes or
6 minutes, and in 1.0 ml over either 3 minutes or 6 minutes
(n = 4 per group).
Monitoring of cerebral blood flow with laser Doppler
flowmetry

A PeriFlux System 4000 (Perimed, Sweden) with probe
407 was used to monitor the local cerebral blood flow
(CBF). Before cell transplantation, an incision was made
to expose the skull. The probe was placed above the sensorimotor cortex (1 mm posterior, 3 mm lateral to
bregma). CBF signals were recorded starting 5 minutes
before cell infusion and subsequently continuing for
30 minutes. Mean values of signal were measured before
cell infusion (baseline), during cell infusion, and in
5-minute periods during 30 minutes of follow-up after cell
infusion. CBF signal changes were expressed relative to
baseline. The laser Doppler signal was recorded and analyzed by using PeriSoft for Windows 2.50. Area under the
curve (AUC) was calculated to reveal the overall CBF
changes.
Behavioral testing

The limb-placing, cylinder, and open field tests were
conducted in a blinded manner before sham-operation
and 24 hours after cell transplantation to detect possible
behavioral deficits related to cell infusion.
A limb-placing test was used to assess the fore- and
hindlimb responses to tactile and proprioceptive stimulation [16,17]. The test contained seven limb-placing
tasks, which were scored as follows: 2 points, the rat
performed normally; 1 point, the rat performed with a
delay (>2 s) and/or incompletely, and 0 points, no
response.
The cylinder test was used to assess possible imbalance between the impaired and the nonimpaired forelimbs [18]. The rat was placed in a transparent cylinder
(Ø 20 cm) and videotaped via a mirror placed at a
45-degree angle below the cylinder. Exploratory activity
was analyzed for 1 to 3 minutes. Left or right forelimb contacts or the use of both forelimbs were

Page 3 of 9

counted. The score for impaired forelimb was calculated as
½ðuse of impaired forelimb þ 0:5  both forelimb useÞ
ðtotal contactsÞ  100%:

The open field test was used to measure locomotor
activity under dimmed lighting conditions to avoid the
inhibitory effect of light [19]. The open field apparatus
consisted of a circular arena surrounded by a 25 cm high
wall. The location and movement of the experimental
animal were recorded by an infrared-sensitive video
camera-computer linkup. The field was divided into eight
preprogrammed areas. The test lasted 10 minutes. The rat
was considered moving, if the velocity was more than
1.5 cm/s. EthoVision XT 7.0 (Noldus, The Netherlands)
was used to record and analyze the data.
Magnetic resonance imaging

MRI was performed 24 hours after cell transplantation by
using a Bruker 9.4 T horizontal scanner to detect micro-occlusions or hemorrhages. The rats were anesthetized with
2% to 2.5% isoflurane (5% for induction) in a gas mixture of
30% O2/70% N2, delivered via a nose mask. A RARE sequence with the following parameters was used to acquire
T2-weighted images: repetition time (TR) = 3.0 s, echo time
(TE) = 32 ms, average = 16, matrix size of 256 × 128, fieldof-view (FOV) = 30 mm × 30 mm; 15 slices with 1-mm slice
thickness. T2*-weighted multislice images were acquired
with the following parameters: TR = 750 ms, TE = 3.0 ms,
TE2 = 6.0 ms, average = 6, FOV = 25.6 mm × 25.6 mm, 15
slices with 1-mm slice thickness. Lesion volumes were
analyzed with MATLAB R2012a, Aedes 1.0. MRI images
were also scored by using the following semiquantitative
scaling: 0 point, no lesions; 1 point, one to five focal
lesions (≤2 mm); 2 points, five to 10 focal lesions; 3 points,
more than 10 focal lesions or confluent lesions.
Histopathology

One day after MRI, the rats were perfused with 0.9%
NaCl followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate
buffer (PB) (pH 7.4). The brains were carefully removed
and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, and then
kept in 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PB for 5 days. Brain sections
(35 μm) were cut by using a sliding microtome, with the
sections being stored in antifreeze solution at -20°C.
Nissl staining and modified Gallyas silver staining [20]
were used to detect lesions and to visualize degenerating
terminals and cell bodies in sections matched with MRI
images.
IgG staining was used to assess the blood-brain barrier
leakage [21]. The sections were washed in PB 3 times,
incubated in 1% H2O2 for 15 minutes, blocked in 2%
normal goat serum for 2 hours, followed by incubation

with biotinylated sheep anti-rat IgG (1:200; AbD Serotec,
Oxford, UK) for 48 hours at 4°C. The sections were then
rinsed with Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Triton X-100
and incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase
conjugate (1:1,000; GE Healthcare, UK) for 1 hour, and
developed with diaminobenzidine for 4 to 6 minutes.
Prussian blue staining was used to visualize the ironlabeled BMMSCs in the brain [22]. The sections were
incubated with 2% potassium ferrocyanide in 2% HCl for
5 minutes and counterstained with neutral red.
All images were captured by using a Zeiss Axio Imager
M2 microscope (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Germany), with an
AxioCam ER camera.
Statistical analysis

The analyses were performed with SPSS software (version
19). CBF changes, lesion size, MRI scores, and results
from behavioral tests were compared by using a KruskalWallis test followed by a Mann-Whitney test. The Spearman
rank correlation coefficient was used to evaluate correlations
between lesion size, behavioral results, and cell dose.
The level of significance was P <0.05. Data are presented
as mean ± standard deviation (SD).

Results
LDF monitoring of cell transplantation

A cell dose-related reduction occurred in the CBF in rats
after cell transplantation. In contrast, CBF seemed to

Page 4 of 9

increase slightly in the control group (Figure 2A). In the
0.25 × 106 group, a slight decline was noted in the CBF
at the beginning, but the flow did return to a level similar to that in control group by the end of the 30-minute
follow-up. Instead, CBF remained reduced in the groups
receiving the two higher cell doses in comparison to the
control group throughout the follow-up. The AUC value
of the 1.0 × 106 group (-407.02 ± 566.58) was significantly
lower than that in controls (243.46 ± 378.07; P <0.05).
The AUC value correlated negatively with the cell dose
(r = -0.48; P <0.05). When different infusion volumes
and velocities were tested, CBF decreased extensively in
0.5 ml/6-minute group (Figure 2B). The AUC value in
the 0.5 ml/6-minute group (-1,069.01 ± 547.21) was significantly lower than that in the 0.5 ml/3-minute group
(-225.99 ± 495.80; P <0.05). No significant difference was
found between the other groups.
MRI monitoring of embolisms and hemorrhage after cell
transplantation

In all of the cell infused groups, ischemic lesions were detected. They were located mainly in the cortex and subcortical white matter (Figure 3), but some were also detected
in the striatum and even the brain stem. No signs of
hemorrhage were observed. In rats receiving PBS or 0.25 ×
106 cells, only one microembolism in one rat of each group
was observed in the white matter. The number of embolisms increased with cell dose, and in some cases, they even

(r = 0.807; P <0.001) and MRI score (r = 0.846; P <0.001)
(Table 1). No significant difference was found between the
groups with different infusion volumes and velocities, although the MRI score was the highest, and lesion size was
the greatest in the 0.5 ml/6 minute group (Table 2).

Behavioral results after cell transplantation

In groups with different cell doses, the mean limb-placing
score for left fore/hindlimbs in 1.0 × 106 group (11.17 ±
5.04) was significantly lower than the mean score (14) in
the other groups (P <0.01). No significant difference was
found between groups in the cylinder test. With respect to
the open field test, no significant difference was observed
between groups after cell transplantation, but velocity,
total distance moved, and moving duration all negatively
correlated with cell dose (r = -0.423; r = -0.423; r = -0.494,
respectively; P <0.05) (Figure 4).
In groups with different infusion volumes or velocities, the
mean limb-placing score of left limbs (10.75 ± 3.95) in
0.5 ml/6-minute group was significantly lower than the mean
score (14) in both 0.5 ml/3-minute and 1.0 ml/3-minute
group (P <0.05), but not in 1.0 ml/6-minute group (11.25 ±
5.50). No significant differences in the performance in the
cylinder or open field tests were found between groups.
Histologic changes after cell transplantation

Nissl and silver staining revealed focal ischemic damage
in the same region in which the lesion was detected with

The extent of intravascular cell entrapment 24 hours
after cell infusion (T2* images) was associated with lesion
number and size (T2 images). The T2* signal was found
primarily in the ipsilateral hemisphere, and it was located
mainly in close proximity to the lesions (Figure 6A,B).
The T2* signal was rarely seen in rats without embolisms.
Prussian blue staining (Figure 6C,D) revealed results
consistent with the T2* images, that is, cells being
trapped in the microvessels, but no major aggregates
were found.

Discussion
Intra-arterial cell delivery has been postulated to enhance the homing efficiency to the target organ, which
may be associated with additional therapeutic benefits,
particularly in the brain. However, adverse events after
intra-arterial cell delivery, such as micro-occlusions and
compromised CBF, were recently reported in rodent
models, raising safety concerns. Cell size, infusion velocity, and technique seem to be important determinants
of safety [14,15,23]. Our study reveals the relation particularly between cell dose and the severity of complications, as detected by LDF, MRI, behavioral testing, and
histology.

Lower cell dose is safer for intra-arterial delivery of
BMMSCs

In our study, we used ECA for cell transplantation with
preserved blood flow in the ICA. Previously, an infusion
velocity of 0.2 ml/min or lower has been postulated to
be safe for rats [15]; thus we applied the rate of 0.5 ml/
3 minutes to test different cell doses. When PBS was infused at a rate of 0.5 ml/3 minutes, the average LDF signal did not change or slightly increased, probably as a
result of hemodynamic changes after the injection of vehicle into the cerebral artery. In contrast, an increasing
cell dose evoked a reduction in CBF, which resulted in
an increase in the numbers of ischemic lesions, as detected by MRI and sensorimotor function impairment.
Therefore, lower cell doses were associated with fewer
adverse events. Both MRI, 24 hours, and histology,
48 hours, after infusion revealed microembolisms as being the most likely explanation for the observed CBF
decline.
Thrombi formed at damaged endothelium after filament retraction may have caused the minor downstream
ischemic lesions occasionally observed in the control
group. This would be a technical complication in the
filament model that should be taken into account. The
size of BMMSCs is relatively large (diameter approximately 20 μm), and thus the cells may be trapped in the
cerebral microvessels and cause focal ischemic lesions.

Despite attempts to avoid cell aggregation by suspending
the cells rigorously before infusion, it is not possible to
be sure that single-cell aggregates are not formed before
or during the infusion. Those aggregates may also have
caused microemboli in some individual cases.
In both scenarios, reducing the cell dose seems to be
one way to prevent such events. In the present study, we
found a dose of 0.25 × 106 to be safe (that is, the complication rate was similar to that found with controls). Filtering
cells before infusion might prevent aggregations, but
might also result in a loss of cells. Three-dimensional
spheroid cultured MSCs or flow cytometry-based pulsewidth assay can also be considered as techniques to reduce or detect cell aggregates in the future [24,25].
Infusion velocity is closely related to the safety of
intra-arterial cell delivery

Our data suggest that increasing the infusion volume
(1.0 ml/3 minutes versus 0.5 ml/3 minutes) in an attempt to reduce the cell concentration, did not reduce
CBF drop or lesion size. One may speculate that a rapid
infusion could affect the hemodynamics, and then trigger endothelial injury, microthrombosis, or forced opening of the blood-brain barrier. Hence, we prolonged the
infusion time in an attempt to prevent such adverse
events. However, extending the infusion time (0.5 ml/
6 minutes versus 0.5 ml/3 minutes) worsened CBF

between the groups, the motor function after cell transplantation seemed to decrease as the cell dose increased, which was confirmed with
Spearman correlation analyses.

may not be necessarily beneficial despite preventing the
hemodynamic complications encountered with high injection velocities. When we extended both infusion volume and infusion time (1.0 ml/6 minutes), CBF was
similar to that seen in the 0.5 ml/3 minute group (same
net infusion velocity), although with a higher MRI score
and a larger lesion, which might be due to the greater
variation (Table 2). Thus, infusion velocity, rather than
simply infusion volume or infusion time, should be considered to be more responsible for the development of
microembolisms after intra-arterial MSC delivery.
Open field test is sensitive at detecting randomly
distributed microembolisms

decrease. This may be explained by the higher probability of cell aggregates forming during the prolonged
infusion times, which may ultimately result in even
greater complications than with rapid infusion.
In line with the LDF results, the MRI score and lesion
size seemed to increase in the 0.5 ml/6 minute group, although no significant difference was found, which might
be due to the rather small number of animals per group
and the extensive variations. Hence, a slower infusion

In the present study, microembolisms were found
mainly within the ICA territory, but some were also observed in the posterior circulation (brain stem) and occasionally even in the contralateral hemisphere. Given
the random distribution of microembolisms and location
in the white matter, it was a challenge to find a sensitive
behavioral test that could assess possible functional consequences. This was also reflected as an apparent discrepancy in the occurrence of complications in 1.0 × 106
and 0.5 × 106 groups (that is, some of the rats were not
found to have any apparent impairment in the limbplacing test or in the cylinder test, despite the presence
of MRI lesions). With respect to the open field test, although no significant group difference was found in the
rats infused with different doses of cells, which might be
due to the high variation between animals, a significant
correlation appeared between cell dose and locomotor
activity. Therefore, the open field test appears to be the
most sensitive technique for detecting a minor, cell
dose-related decrease in motor activity [19,26].

Only limited information is available about the intraarterial delivery of allogeneic cells [9,14,27,28]. Recently
Khabbal [27] reported different clearance rates of rat
and human BMMSCs from the brain after intra-arterial
infusion, with human BMMSCs disappearing more rapidly
than rat cells. However, it is unclear whether the differential cell behavior has any functional impact. Moreover,
despite initial effective homing to the brain, both rat and
human cells disappeared almost completely within 1 or
2 days [27,29]. Similarly, the T2* signal extinctions were
observed in the brain with MRI at 24 hours after infusion
in the present study, but histology at 48 hours after infusion revealed fewer cells in the brain. More important, the
brief presence of MSCs was associated with permanent
damage with high cell doses.
Thus, one major task for future studies will be to reduce the effective therapeutic dose and to improve

engraftment, which should be reflected in functional
improvements.
Limitations of the present study

The present study has several limitations. First, only
sham-operated rats were used because the microembolisms caused by MSC infusion might be masked by the
large corticostriatal lesions typical of most MCAO
models. In addition, one cannot exclude the possibility
that cells behave differently under postischemic circumstances. Another limitation is that we used the
preoperated ECA for cell infusion. It might be possible
that reopening the artery releases some blood emboli,
causing technical micro-occlusion such as that occasionally observed in the control group. Moreover, because of the random location of lesions, LDF might not
be sensitive enough to detect CBF changes in deep
white matter and brain structures out of the ICA territory. For the same reason, it was challenging to detect
sensorimotor impairment.
Finally, the follow-up period was limited to 3 days
(that is, no assessment was made of the long-term outcome). As the observed functional deficits may be transient or minor with respect to the potential therapeutic
improvements achieved by MSC, long-term efficacy
studies with a safe dose of rat BMMSCs are warranted
in stroke rats.

Conclusions
The safety of allogeneic intra-arterial BMMSC transplantation is dose dependent. Infusion velocity is also
closely related with safe intra-arterial administration.
Therefore, cell dose and infusion velocity should be
carefully optimized, according to which cell types are being delivered, as well as to the study design when planning future preclinical and clinical efficacy studies.
