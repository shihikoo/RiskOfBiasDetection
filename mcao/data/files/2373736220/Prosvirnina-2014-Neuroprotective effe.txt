Neuroprotective effect of erythropoietin administered before ischemia has been previously
demonstrated. The efficiency of erythropoietin administration after ischemia was not studied,
though in case of success these protocols would be applied in clinical neurology. In our experiments on the model of transitory focal ischemia, erythropoietin was injected intraperitoneally
during the early and delayed postischemic period (3 and 12 h). The size of the necrotic zone,
neurological deficit, and the severity of brain edema were evaluated in 48 h. Injection of
erythropoietin in 3 and 12 h after ischemia significantly reduced the size of necrosis (p=0.0007
and p=0.0016, respectively), neurological deficit (p=0.0013 and p=0.0062, respectively), and
brain edema (p=0.02 and p=0.0186, respectively). Injection of erythropoietin after transitory
focal cerebral ischemia produced a pronounced neuroprotective effect.

In Russia, the incidence of strokes is 450,000 cases per
year. The mortality and disability rates over the first
month after stroke are 30 and 55%, respectively [3]. In
light of this, the search for means reducing the severity of ischemic and reperfusion damage to the brain
remains the pressing problem of modern medicine.
Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein synthesized in the kidneys, brain, liver, and other organs
[14]. EPO production is stimulated by hypoxia, hypoglycemia, and inflammation [10]. In the brain, EPO
receptors are detected in neurons, astrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, and arterial and venous myocytes [15]. EPO can cross the blood–brain barrier and
produce a protective effect in brain ischemia due to
blockade of cell apoptosis [7,11], attenuation of the
toxic effects of glutamate [12], lowering of intracellular calcium concentration [12], and nerve cell reparation [7,9]. It is also known that the concentration of
endogenous EPO in the brain increases after ischemia.

Neuroprotective effect of erythropoietin administered before ischemia has been previously demonstrated [6,13]. The efficiency of EPO administration
after ischemia was never studied.
Here we evaluated the protective effects of EPO
injected 3 and 12 h after focal cerebral ischemia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experiments were carried out on male Wistar rats
anesthetized with chloral hydrate (450 mg/kg). Transitory focal ischemia of the brain was modeled in rats
by 30-min endovascular occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery followed by reperfusion for 48 h
(Koizumi, 1986; Belayev, 1996) [1,5]. This technique
used in our previous experiments [1,2] provides wellreproducible ischemia. Neurological deficit was scored
in 48 h by the Garcia scale including 5 parameters
evaluating total motor activity, coordination, sensitivity, and muscle strength (18 points corresponded
to healthy animals and 3 points indicated maximum
neurological deficit). In all rats, initial score was 18
[2,8]. The size of ischemic damage [1] was evaluated

by staining of brain sections with 0.1% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (MP Biomed). The severity of brain
edema was evaluated by the coefficient of asymmetry,
i.e. by the ratio of the left and right hemispheres [2].
EPO (Jansen-Silag) was injected intraperitoneally in
a dose of 5000 U/kg. The animals were divided into
3 groups. In the control group (n=8), occlusion of the
left middle cerebral artery followed by 48-h reperfusion was performed. In two experimental groups, the
rats were subjected the same manipulations plus EPO
was injected in 3 (experimental group 1, n=5) or 12 h
(experimental group 2, n=6) after ischemia modeling.
The quality of manipulations and ischemia modeling
were verified by high-frequency Doppler ultrasonography (MM-Doppler-K; 25 MHz) in the basin of the
left middle cerebral artery [4]. The animals in whom
ischemia was not verified or the blood circulation was
not restored were excluded from the study.
Statistical processing of the results was performed
using SPSS 12.0 software. Significance of differences
between the two non-related samples was evaluated
using Mann–Whitney test. The data are presented as
the median and 25 and 75% percentiles.

experimental group 1; III: experimental group 2.

RESULTS
The infarct size in the brain (Fig. 1) in the control
group was 12.65% (10.6; 15.21), in experimental
group 1 — 3.97% (3.18; 4.69), i.e. significantly lower
than in the control (p=0.0007), and in experimental
group 2 — 3.58% (3.39; 3.71; p=0.0016 in comparison
with the control). There were no differences between
the experimental groups by the infarct size (p=0.5368).
Hemispheric asymmetry (Fig. 2) in the control
group was 1.095 (1.08; 1.135). In experimental group
1 this parameters was significantly below the control
(1.045 (1.03; 1.05), p=0.02). In experimental group
2, hemispheric asymmetry was 1.03 (1.02; 1.05;
р=0.0186 in comparison with the control). There were
no differences between the experimental groups by the
asymmetry coefficient (p=0.5368).
Neurological deficit (Garcia score) in the control
group was 12 (9.5; 13) (Fig. 3), in experimental group
1 — 16 (15; 18), i.e. significantly below the control
(p=0.0013), and in experimental group 2 — 17 (14;
18) (p=0.0016 in comparison with the control). There
were no differences between the experimental groups
by the infarct size (p=1.0693).
Thus, injection of EPO in a dose of 5000 U/kg
to rats in 3 and 12 h after modeling focal brain ischemia produced a pronounced neuroprotective effect
that manifested in reduced infarct size and severity
cerebral edema and neurological deficit.
