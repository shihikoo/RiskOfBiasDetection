Yonkenaﬁl is a novel phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor. Here we evaluated the effect of yonkenaﬁl on
ischemic injury and its possible mechanism of action. Male Sprague–Dawley rats underwent middle cerebral
artery occlusion, followed by intraperitoneal or intravenous treatment with yonkenaﬁl starting 2 h later.
Behavioral tests were carried out on day 1 or day 7 after reperfusion. Nissl staining, Fluoro-Jade B staining and
electron microscopy studies were carried out 24 h post-stroke, together with an analysis of infarct volume
and severity of edema. Levels of cGMP-dependent Nogo-66 receptor (Nogo-R) pathway components, hsp70,
apaf-1, caspase-3, caspase-9, synaptophysin, PSD-95/neuronal nitric oxide synthases (nNOS), brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) and nerve growth factor (NGF)/tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA) were also measured after 24 h. Yonkenaﬁl markedly inhibited infarction and
edema, even when administration was delayed until 4 h after stroke onset. This protection was associated
with an improvement in neurological function and was sustained for 7 d. Yonkenaﬁl enlarged the range of
penumbra, reduced ischemic cell apoptosis and the loss of neurons, and modulated the expression of proteins
in the Nogo-R pathway. Moreover, yonkenaﬁl protected the structure of synapses and increased the expression
of synaptophysin, BDNF/TrkB and NGF/TrkA. In conclusion, yonkenaﬁl protects neuronal networks from injury
after stroke.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke, one of the leading causes of death and adult disability worldwide, has two major therapeutic approaches: recanalization
and neuroprotection. Thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator,
limited by the risk of hemorrhagic complications occurring and its narrow therapeutic time window, is not commonly used (Ye et al., 2011).
The development of neural protectants is challenging, because many
neuroprotective interventions that have demonstrated efﬁcacy in
preclinical studies have so far failed to provide similar curative effects
in a clinical setting (Ginsberg, 2008; Savitz and Fisher, 2007; Ye et al.,
2011). Recent studies have shown that phosphodiesterase type 5
(PDE5) inhibitors have remarkable therapeutic effects on many
diseases, such as pulmonary hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, erectile
dysfunction, and stroke (Bivalacqua et al., 2000; Puzzo et al., 2009;
Weimann et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2005). Several studies have been

published which describe distinct effects of PDE5 inhibitors in animal
models of stroke (Chen et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2002, 2005, 2006).
Although most of them refer to a beneﬁcial effect of PDE5 inhibitor
treatment on neurological outcome and cerebral blood ﬂow, the
ﬁndings concerning infarct size are controversial. Because the extent
of infarction in rats stabilizes within 24 h of stroke onset, PDE5 inhibitors have no effect on infarction if treatment is delayed for several
days (Zhang et al., 2002). In our previous study, we found that the
PDE5 inhibitor sildenaﬁl enhanced neurological recovery and inhibited
infarction, even when administration was delayed until 4 h after stroke
onset (Chen et al., 2014). This engendered the hypothesis that PDE5 inhibitors promote functional reorganization after acute stroke. A number
of possible molecular mechanisms that may account for this effect have
been proposed, including enhanced neurogenesis and augmentation of
cerebral blood ﬂow (Zhang et al., 2002). However, causality has yet to
be established.
Besides neurogenesis, the approach of promoting the generation of
new neurons to compensate for tissue lost to injury, enhancing neuronal networks and restructuring the extracellular matrix are also necessary strategies for functional rehabilitation after stroke (Chen et al.,

268

2014). A group or several groups of chemically connected or functionally associated neurons constitute a neuronal network, so strengthening
of synaptic connections among neurons leads to enhanced neuronal
networks (Hopﬁeld, 1982; Rich and Wenner, 2007).
In clinical, the most common adverse effects of sildenaﬁl use included headache, ﬂushing, dyspepsia, nasal congestion and impaired vision,
including photophobia and blurred vision (Moreira et al., 2000). The
sildenaﬁl analog yonkenaﬁl (2-(2-ethoxy-5-(4-ethylpiperazin-1-yl
sulfonyl) phenyl)-5-methyl-7-propyl-3H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin4(7H)-one) is a novel PDE5 inhibitor that can be used for low-dose,
short-term administration. Yonkenaﬁl (IC50: 2.0 nM) is more potent
than sidenaﬁl (IC50: 4.5 nM) and shows fewer side effects (Wang
et al., 2008). The objective of this study was to determine the effects
of yonkenaﬁl on the neuronal network, besides its possible mechanism
of action, in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rats.
Our results demonstrate that yonkenaﬁl is effective for reducing cerebral infarction, neurologic deﬁcits, edema and neuron damage in the
infarct area. Yonkenaﬁl also inhibited neuronal loss by reducing Nogo66 receptor (Nogo-R), RhoA, and p-PTEN expressions and increasing
p-Akt and PI3K levels via a cGMP-dependent pathway. In addition,
yonkenaﬁl was able to improve the structure of synapse, increase levels
of synaptophysin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), and nerve growth factor (NGF)/tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA), and reduce levels of PSD-95/neuronal
nitric oxide synthases (nNOS). The results in rodent model of transient
focal strokes support the hypothesis that the neuroprotective properties
of yonkenaﬁl contribute to this drug's therapeutic efﬁcacy possibly.

Materials and methods
Administration of drugs and chemicals
Yonkenaﬁl (yonkenaﬁl hydrochloride, purity 99.4%, kindly supplied
by Zhuhai Oxforston PharmTech Co. Ltd., Zhuhai, P.R. China) was dissolved in normal saline and administered by the intraperitoneal (i.p.)
or intravenous (i.v.) route. A speciﬁc PKG inhibitor DT-3 (Sigma-Aldrich
1 mg/kg, i.p.), a soluble GC inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]
quinoxalin-1-1 (ODQ, Sigma-Aldrich, 3.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and a PKA inhibitor fragment 5–24 amide triﬂuoroacetate salt (IP-20, Sigma-Aldrich,
0.34 mg/kg, i.p.) were administered in combination with yonkenaﬁl
(16 mg/kg) (Chen et al., 2014).
Animals and experimental design
Male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats weighing 270–300 g (age 8 weeks
approximately), supplied by the Experimental Animal Centre of Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, were maintained under standard housing conditions (22 ± 2 °C, 50 ± 10% relative humidity, a 12 h light/dark
cycle, light on at 06:30 a.m.) with food and water available ad libitum.
Animals were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, i.p.) and
subjected to 2 h of right MCAO and reperfusion (I/R) for 1 d or 7 d
(Chen et al., 2014). The external carotid artery was coagulated distal
to the carotid bifurcation. A 4-0 nylon ﬁlament (the diameter of the ﬁlament is 0.25, but the diameter of the tip is 0.34 mm to create an embolus) was inserted through the external carotid artery stump and
advanced into the right internal carotid artery until it blocked the origin
of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The ﬁlament was removed to restore blood ﬂow after 2 h. Rats were eliminated from cohorts if they
died. Mortality in each group was approximately 20%. All experiments
and procedures were in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 80-23, revised
1996).
For the beam walking and rotarod tests, animals were randomly
assigned to the following experimental treatment groups (Table 1): a
sham-operated group (natural saline, 10 ml/kg daily for 7 d); an
MCAO group (rats suffered I/R and normal saline daily for 7 d); and an

For the other tests, the remaining animals were randomly assigned
to the following experimental treatment groups (Table 1): a shamoperated group (natural saline, 10 ml/kg); an MCAO group (rats suffered I/R and normal saline); MCAO + yonkenaﬁl groups (rats suffered
I/R, followed by i.v. yonkenaﬁl 4, 8, 16 and 32 mg/kg starting 2 h later in
the dose–response experiment; rats suffered I/R, followed by i.v.
yonkenaﬁl 16 mg/kg starting 2 h, 4 h or 6 h later in the therapeutictime window experiment; rats suffered I/R, followed by i.v. yonkenaﬁl
16 mg/kg starting 2 h later in the transmission electron microscopy
experiment; rats suffered I/R, followed by i.v. yonkenaﬁl 8, 16 and
32 mg/kg starting 2 h later for the other experiments); and MCAO + inhibitor + yonkenaﬁl groups (rats suffered I/R and inhibitors were administered immediately after MCAO, followed by yonkenaﬁl 2 h later).

Behavioral testing
Neurological functional deﬁcits were evaluated 22 h after reperfusion using a modiﬁed six-point scoring method applied by an investigator who was blinded as to the experimental treatment groups
(Minematsu et al., 1992). The scale was: 0: no neurological deﬁcit; 1:
failure to extend the forepaw fully; 2: circling; 3: falling to one side; 4:

X. Chen et al. / Experimental Neurology 261 (2014) 267–277

no spontaneous walking with a depressed level of consciousness; and 5:
dead.
Two tests were used to evaluate the behavioral outcome: a beam
walking test and a rotarod test after administration of yonkenaﬁl (or
vehicle) for 7 d consecutively.

Nissl staining

The rotarod test was carried out as described previously (Guzman
et al., 2008). Pre-stroke training was performed on a rat rotarod three
times a week prior to the MCAO. On testing days, each rat performed
the test twice in a row and then the cohort was cycled and the test
repeated. The length of time each rat was able to stay on the rotarod,
up to 300 s, was recorded.

Nissl staining was also employed as previously described (Han et al.,
2012). Initially, tissue sections were defatted by passing through graded
dilutions of ethanol, rehydrated by passing back through decreasing
concentrations of ethanol, and stained with cresyl violet. The sections
were soaked in ethanol to differentiate the stain and cleared by immersion in xylene for 2 min before cover slipping with mounting medium,
and then digitized using a 40 × objective (Olympus BX40) using a 3CCD color video camera DP 72 interfaced with an MCID computer imaging analysis system. Four sections and four views in each section were
measured per rat. The number of Nissl-positive cells was measured in
each section. Data were analyzed in a blinded manner and presented
as the number of positive cells in one ﬁeld.

Beam walking test

Fluoro-Jade B staining

The beam walking test was carried out as described previously
(Feeney et al., 1982; Goldstein and Davis, 1990). Pre-stroke training
was performed for 3 d and the test was performed on the seventh day
after surgery. During training and testing, rats were placed on one end
of the beam and exposed to noise and light until they entered the goal
box. The performance of the rats was evaluated using a seven-point
scoring method by an investigator who was blinded as to the experimental treatment groups.

Staining was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol
(Histo-Chem Inc., Jefferson AR). Sections were dried on slides at 50 °C
for 30 min, immersed in a solution containing 1% sodium hydroxide in
80% alcohol for 5 min, followed by 2 min in 70% alcohol and 2 min in distilled water. Slides were transferred to a solution of 0.06% potassium
permanganate for 10 min on a shaker table, then washed in distilled
water for 2 min. After 20 min in Fluoro-Jade B staining solution, the
slides were rinsed for 1 min in each of three distilled water washes,
then placed on a slide warmer at 50 °C in the dark until they were
completely dry. Sections were cleared by immersion in xylene for
1 min before cover slipping with DPX (Sigma). These sections were
digitized using a 40 × objective (Olympus BX40) using a 3-CCD color
video camera DP 72 interfaced with an MCID imaging analysis system
(Suh et al., 2003).

Rotarod test

Measurement of cerebral infarct volume and cerebral edema
Rats were killed 22 h after reperfusion, and their brains were quickly
removed, weighed accurately, and then sliced into ﬁve coronal sections,
each of 2 mm thickness. The slices were incubated in a 2% solution of
tetrazolium chloride (Sigma) at 37 °C for 20 min, and then photographic images were taken. Afterwards the slices were dried at 100 °C for 24 h
and then weighed accurately. The brain water content was determined
as an indicator of cerebral edema using a wet/dry method as previously
described (Vink et al., 2003). The cross-sectional areas, with or without
infarction, in each brain slice were measured using Image J analysis software (version 1.6, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
The total mean infarct area of each section was examined by the change
in coloration (Jiang et al., 2010).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
TEM was carried out as previously described (Alfonso-Loeches et al.,
2012). Brains were ﬁxed by transcardial perfusion with saline, followed
by perfusion and immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde. Small blocks from the striatum and cortex were processed for
electron microscopy and embedded in Epon resin. The sections were
then examined by TEM (JEM-1200EX, Jeol Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at an
accelerating voltage of 80 kV.

Immunohistochemical assessment
Western blot analysis
Brains were ﬁxed by transcardial perfusion with saline, followed by
perfusion and immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde. A standard tissue
block was obtained from the center of the lesion (bregma − 1 mm to
+ 1 mm). A series of 15 μm thick sections was cut from the block.
Every 10th coronal section for a total of 4 sections was used for staining.
Antibody immunostaining for tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB),
tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA) (1:300, Abcam, Cambridge, UK.),
and Nogo-66 receptor (Nogo-R) (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA) was performed. Control experiments consisted of
staining brain coronal tissue sections as outlined above, but nonimmune
serum was substituted for the primary antibody. The sections were digitized using a 40× objective (Olympus BX40, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan.)
and a 3-CCD color video camera DP 72 interfaced with a Micro Computer Imaging Device (MCID) computer imaging analysis system (ImagePro 3D Plus Workstation, Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA).
The areas that were positively stained with TrkA, TrkB and Nogo-R
were measured in each section. Positive areas in four random ﬁelds
(400× magniﬁcation) across the cortex (forelimb forelimb region, jaw
region, dysgranular region, upper lip region and barrel ﬁeld region of
the primary somatosensory cortex) and striatum (dorsal region) were
quantiﬁed. The data obtained from four sections were averaged for
each animal. Data were analyzed in a blind manner and presented as
the percentage of positive areas per ﬁeld.

Tissues from the cortex and striatum including the infarct area were
homogenized in lysis buffer. Protein extracts were separated by sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The following
primary antibodies were used: anti-RhoA (1:500, Abcam), anti-heat
shock 70 kDa protein (hsp70), anti-apoptotic protease activating
facter-1 (apaf-1), anti-caspase-9, anti-caspase-3, anti-Akt, anti-p-Akt,
anti-PTEN, anti-p-PTEN (1:500, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-NogoR, anti-PI3K, anti-β-actin (1:500, Santa Cruz), anti-synaptophysin or
anti-PSD-95 (1:1500, Millipore).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
Elisa kits were used according to the manufacturer's instructions
(R&D) to measure the levels of nNOS, BDNF and NGF in the striatum
and cortex.
Statistical analysis
Quantitative data from the experiments are expressed as the
mean ± SE. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 13.0 software
for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical signiﬁcance was determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Least

270

Signiﬁcant Difference analysis followed by Dunnett's test. In all cases,
differences were considered signiﬁcant if P b 0.05.

Results
Yonkenaﬁl improves behavioral outcome and reduces cerebral
infarct volume
Ischemia leads to severe behavioral disorder in rats. Our results
showed that yonkenaﬁl-treated rats obtained higher beam walking
scores (4.5 ± 0.6 vs 2.4 ± 0.7) and took longer to fall from a rotating
rod (194.8 ± 36.5 s vs 84.3 ± 33.8 s) than the MCAO animals
(Fig. 1D). Furthermore, yonkenaﬁl signiﬁcantly reversed the strokeinduced neurological deﬁcits and cerebral edema, which were signiﬁcantly higher in the MCAO group than in the sham group (Neurological
scores: 1.1 ± 0.1 vs 2.7 ± 0.3; brain water content: 78.3 ± 0.4% vs
80.7 ± 0.5%), even after a 4 h delay in administration post-stroke (Neurological scores: 1.1 ± 0.1 vs 2.7 ± 0.3; brain water content: 79.4 ± 0.2%
vs 80.7 ± 0.5%, Figs. 1A and B). In addition, the yonkenaﬁl-induced reduction of the infarct volume was dose dependent with an ED50 of
12.27 mg/kg. These results suggest that yonkenaﬁl was able to improve
behavioral outcome and reduce cerebral infarct volume after stroke.

In the present study, the expressions of hsp70, apaf-1, caspase-9 and
caspase-3 were signiﬁcantly increased after stroke. We found that
yonkenaﬁl increased the expression of hsp70, reduced the expression
of apaf-1, and inhibited the cleavage of caspase-3 and caspase-9
(Fig. 2A). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that a
number of dying neurons in MCAO rats displayed features of apoptosis,
including nuclear breakdown and chromatin condensation which could
be reversed by yonkenaﬁl (Fig. 2C). These data showed that yonkenaﬁl
could signiﬁcantly enlarge the range of penumbra, and reduce ischemic
cell apoptosis.

Yonkenaﬁl increases neuronal survival via a cGMP-dependent
Nogo-R pathway
The number of surviving neurons is a reliable indicator of cerebral
injury. After stroke, the number of surviving neurons was reduced in
both the cortex and the striatum (Fig. 3A). Our results suggest that
yonkenaﬁl signiﬁcantly prevented neuronal damage and increased
the number of surviving neurons after stroke (Cortex: 8 mg·kg−1
139.0 ± 4.5, 16 mg·kg− 1 156.7 ± 3.8, 32 mg·kg−1 125.2 ± 5.0 vs
96.4 ±14.8; Striatum: 8 mg·kg−1 135.0 ± 4.3, 16 mg·kg−1 151.9 ±
4.3, 32 mg·kg−1 116.3 ± 6.2 vs 62.5 ± 3.9) (Figs. 3A and D).

DT-3 is an inhibitor of protein kinase G (PKG). 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo
[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-1 (ODQ) inhibits nitric oxide-sensitive guanylyl cyclase (GC) to reduce cGMP generation. A PKA inhibitor fragment 5–24
amide triﬂuoroacetate salt (IP-20) binds to the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), mimicking the protein substrate (Chen et al., 2014).
These inhibitors reduce the level of cGMP or inhibit the binding of PKA/
PKG to the downstream substrate. Our previous study reported that
ODQ, DT-3 or IP-20 alone did not inﬂuence stroke-induced injury
(Chen et al., 2014). To explore whether a cGMP-dependent pathway is
involved in yonkenaﬁl-induced neuroprotection, rats were simultaneously treated with yonkenaﬁl and ODQ, IP-20 or DT-3. The reduction
in brain water content and the increase in surviving neurons induced by
yonkenaﬁl were signiﬁcantly reversed by ODQ, DT-3 or IP-20 (brain
water content: IP-20 79.9 ± 0.5%, ODQ 80.3 ± 0.5%, DT-3 79.4 ± 0.7%

vs 78.3 ± 0.4%; surviving neurons: cortex IP-20 116.6 ± 4.8, ODQ
117.4 ± 5.5, DT-3 133.0 ± 5.4 vs 156.7 ± 3.8; striatum IP-20 72.4 ±
4.4, ODQ 73.7 ± 4.1, DT-3 104.7 ± 4.1 vs 151.9 ± 4.3, Figs. 1 and 4).
The yonkenaﬁl-induced reductions in neurological deﬁcit scores and infarct volume were signiﬁcantly reversed by ODQ or IP-20 (Neurological
scores: IP-20 1.9 ± 0.2, ODQ 1.9 ± 0.2, DT-3 1.2 ± 0.3 vs 1.1 ± 0.1; Infarct volume: IP-20 22.1 ± 3.9%, ODQ 24.1 ± 6.0%, DT-3 16.4 ± 5.0% vs
10.8 ± 3.0%, Figs. 1 and 4).
To further investigate the molecular mechanism of yonkenaﬁlinduced neuroprotection, we examined the expression levels of proteins in the Nogo-R pathway. After MCAO, Nogo-R, RhoA and p-PTEN/
PTEN expression levels were signiﬁcantly increased in the cortex and
striatum, while p-Akt/Akt and PI3K expression levels were markedly reduced. Yonkenaﬁl reduced the expression of Nogo-R, RhoA and p-PTEN,

and increased p-Akt and PI3K (Figs. 4D and 5). When rats were treated
simultaneously with yonkenaﬁl and cGMP/PKG/PKA inhibitors, the reduction in Nogo-R expression was signiﬁcantly reversed (Cortex IP-20
11.3 ± 0.5, ODQ 12.7 ± 0.7, DT-3 9.5 ± 0.5 vs 8.4 ± 1.0; Striatum IP20 12.8 ± 0.8, ODQ 13.2 ± 0.7, DT-3 9.4 ± 0.5 vs 7.7 ± 1.0, Fig. 4).
These results indicate that yonkenaﬁl reduced the loss of neurons
through a cGMP-dependent Nogo-R pathway after stroke.
Yonkenaﬁl improves synaptic dysfunction via BDNF/TrkB and NGF/TrkA
TEM was used to examine morphological defects in neurons which
displayed structural degeneration following ischemic stroke (Fig. 6A).
Synaptic abnormalities included a reduction in synaptic vesicles, disappearance of the synaptic cleft, and fusion of the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes. Local damage, swelling, and demyelination were
evident in many of the axonal processes. These defects were reversed

by yonkenaﬁl treatment, suggesting that yonkenaﬁl had a protective effect on synapse structure.
Synaptophysin is a marker for quantiﬁcation of synapses (Chen et al.,
2014). PSD-95 and neuronal nitric oxide synthases (nNOS) are coupled
on the postsynaptic membrane. Importantly, ischemia often causes a reduction in the level of synaptophysin and an increase in the level of coupling PSD-95 to nNOS (Chen et al., 2014). Our results showed that
yonkenaﬁl blocked the reduction of synaptophysin levels and the elevation of PSD-95 and nNOS levels (nNOS: Cortex: 8.0 ± 1.7 pg/μg vs 35.1
± 4.9 pg/μg; Striatum: 16.8 ± 5.1 pg/μg vs 126.6 ± 25.2 pg/μg) (Figs. 5
and 6B). These data suggest that yonkenaﬁl signiﬁcantly increased the
quantity of synapses and alleviated synaptic damage in the ischemic
brain.
Furthermore, yonkenaﬁl signiﬁcantly increased tropomyosinrelated kinase B (TrkB) protein expression (Cortex: 8.9 ± 0.4 vs 5.6 ±
0.4; Striatum: 9.9 ± 0.6 vs 5.9 ± 0.4, Figs. 7A and C) and brain-

vs 1.7 ± 0.2 pg/μg; Striatum: 13.9 ± 2.4 pg/μg vs 2.7 ± 0.5 pg/μg,
Fig. 7D) compared with the MCAO group. In addition, compared with
the MCAO group, yonkenaﬁl (16, 32 mg/kg) increased tropomyosinrelated kinase A (TrkA) protein expression in the cortex (10.7 ± 0.7 vs
5.7 ± 0.5, Figs. 7B and C), but not in the striatum, while yonkenaﬁl
(32 mg/kg) also increased nerve growth factor (NGF) protein expression in the striatum (3874.5 ± 1629.9 pg/μg vs 193.8 ± 23.7 pg/μg),
but not in the cortex (Cortex: 2376.3 ± 632.0 pg/μg vs 230.8 ±
17.8 pg/μg, Fig. 7D). These data suggest that yonkenaﬁl signiﬁcantly enhanced synaptic function in the ischemic brain by modulating the expression of BDNF/TrkB and NGF/TrkA.

Discussion
After central nervous system (CNS) injury, restructuring of the extracellular matrix and modiﬁcation of neuronal networks are restricted,
thus limiting functional recovery (Chen et al., 2014). Recent experimental studies in rodents suggest that treatment with different PDE5 inhibitors can improve functional recovery after stroke (Chen et al., 2014;
Royl et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2006). However, the extent of activity of
these inhibitors and the underlying mechanisms are still not completely
understood. In our study, the beneﬁcial effects and possible mechanism
of yonkenaﬁl on the structure and function of neuronal networks were
investigated.

X. Chen et al. / Experimental Neurology 261 (2014) 267–277

We found ﬁrstly that yonkenaﬁl had a signiﬁcant salutary effect on
behavioral outcome and reduced cerebral infarct volume. This is the
ﬁrst preclinical study to report the inhibitory effect of yonkenaﬁl on
stroke-induced infarct volume. Another important observation was
the therapeutic time window for yonkenaﬁl administration. Although
the therapeutic time window in animal models is not an exact predictive marker of that in humans, determination of the time window in
rats is thought to be relevant to clinical practice (Fisher et al., 2009; Ye
et al., 2011). We found that yonkenaﬁl treatment was beneﬁcial even
when the compound was given 4 h after stroke. In the present study,
the expressions of hsp70, apaf-1, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were signiﬁcantly increased after stroke. These results are consistent with the previous reports (Gao et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2001; Matsumori et al.,
2006). Absence of hsp70 in neurons and glia could distinguish core
from penumbra after stroke (Weinstein et al., 2004). The ischemic penumbra, which can be marked by hsp70, is a diagnostic target to extend
the therapeutic windows and a target for brain plasticity, neuroprotection and neurorepair (Sharp et al., 2000). Furthermore, hsp70 could prevent cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and prevent apoptosis by
reducing the level of apaf-1, leading to the inhibition of caspase-9 and
caspase-3 cleavages (Chelluboina et al., 2014; Matsumori et al., 2006;
Zhang et al., 2012). We found that yonkenaﬁl could increase the expression of hsp70, reduce the expression of apaf-1, and inhibit the cleavage
of caspase-9 and caspase-3. TEM study revealed that yonkenaﬁl could
inhibit the features of apoptosis in neurons. These data showed that
yonkenaﬁl could signiﬁcantly enlarge the range of penumbra, and reduce ischemic cell apoptosis. Moreover, yonkenaﬁl increased the number of surviving neurons, and this effect was observed in both cortex
and striatum, implying a potential role of yonkenaﬁl for white matter
protection. The blood ﬂow in the striatum as well as deep white matter
is lower than in the cortex; as a result the striatum is more severely affected by stroke than the cortex (Lo et al., 2003; Ye et al., 2011). As noted
by the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable, if a remedy protects both neurons and white matter, it is more likely to have clinical relevance (Fisher et al., 2009). The white matter supports messages that
pass between neurons and nerve ﬁbers within the nervous system. Because the striatum has a highly packed structure, striatal lesions can
lead to serious neurological deﬁcits (Ye et al., 2011). This strengthens
the importance of our ﬁnding that yonkenaﬁl signiﬁcantly attenuates
neuronal damage in the striatum.
PDE5 is the main cGMP-speciﬁc enzyme that hydrolyzes cGMP
(Zhang et al., 2002). Binding of cGMP to allosteric sites could regulate
PKG or PKA (Nakagawa et al., 2002). The cGMP–PKG cascade not only
inhibits a proapoptotic pathway to promote neuron survival, but also
activates substrates that are involved in cellular proliferation and vascular smooth muscle relaxation (Fiscus, 2002; Wang et al., 2008). DT-3 is a
speciﬁc PKG inhibitor (Chen et al., 2014; Ramchandran et al., 2012). PKA
promotes glutamate uptake and inhibits Ca2+ release to prevent neuronal injury (Ballestas and Benveniste, 1997; Pisano et al., 1996). IP-20 is a
speciﬁc PKA inhibitor. It has been reported that DT-3 or IP-20 alone cannot inﬂuence stroke-induced injury (Chen et al., 2014). The present
study could not distinguish between the relative contributions of PKA
and PKG to neuronal survival and reduced edema. However, the
yonkenaﬁl-induced reductions in neurological deﬁcits, infarct volume
and Nogo-R expression were signiﬁcantly reversed by the PKA inhibitor
IP-20 but not the PKG inhibitor DT-3. These results show that yonkenaﬁl
reduces neurological deﬁcits, infarction and Nogo-R expression mainly
through the cGMP/PKA pathway.
Accumulating evidence indicates that when the inhibitory ligands
Nogo, MAG, and OMgp are present on the surface of oligodendrocytes,
they activate RhoA via the Nogo-R receptor complex (Tönges et al.,
2011). RhoA, a downstream substrate of PKA, further activates ROCK
to phosphorylate several effectors that participate in cell motility and
survival (Tkachenko et al., 2011). PTEN, which is the downstream target
of ROCK, antagonizes PIP3 to negatively regulate Akt signaling, and ﬁnally results in decreased protein synthesis and simultaneous inhibition

275

of neurite outgrowth and growth factor-mediated cell survival (Shin
et al., 2007; Song et al., 2005; Tönges et al., 2011). Therefore inhibiting
the expression of Nogo-R could promote axon sprouting after neuron
injury. After stroke, the expression of Nogo-R is increased in the ischemic brain, and as a result the regeneration of axons is hindered (Cui
et al., 2010). Our results indicate that yonkenaﬁl reduces the expression
of Nogo-R, RhoA and p-PTEN, but increases the expression of PI3K and
p-Akt. When rats were treated with yonkenaﬁl and cGMP/PKG/PKA inhibitors, the increase in surviving neurons and the decrease in Nogo-R
expression were markedly reversed. Accordingly, a novel ﬁnding
was that yonkenaﬁl reduced the loss of neurons through a cGMPdependent Nogo-R axis.
Evidence suggests that after a stroke, a time-limited window opens,
during which the biggest therapeutic effect occurs (Murphy and
Corbett, 2009). This gives us great hopes for improving recovery; the
big challenge is how to determine ways of enhancing neuronal networks within this window and new response pathways that compensate for the tissue lost to injury (Chen et al., 2014). Cerebral ischemia
can lead to the loss of neurons and synaptic connections (Murphy and
Corbett, 2009). The association between synaptic connections and neuronal function in stroke is supported by more and more evidence (Puzzo
et al., 2009). In our study, yonkenaﬁl protected synaptic vesicles,
prevented the fusion of the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes,
increased the expression of synaptophysin and reduced the level of coupling of PSD-95 to nNOS. This indicated that yonkenaﬁl protects the synapse structure in the ischemic brain. Furthermore, there is growing
evidence that neurotrophic factors play an essential role in behavioral
recovery following brain injury (Chen et al., 2014; Sofroniew et al.,
2001). It is known that BDNF reduces infarct volume in different stroke
models, prevents neuronal loss, promotes neuronal migration and differentiation, and regulates synaptic function and synaptic plasticity
(Chen et al., 2014; Cui et al., 2010; Greenberg et al., 2009; Song et al.,
2005). NGF/TrkA regulates growth cones, motility, and biosynthesis of
enzymes for neurotransmitters, and prevents neuron death after stroke
(Chen et al., 2014). Yonkenaﬁl increases the levels of BDNF/TrkB and
NGF/TrkA. This indicated that yonkenaﬁl protects synapse function in
the ischemic brain. Thus, we propose a model in which yonkenaﬁl enhances neuronal function by protecting synapses via up-regulation of
BDNF/TrkB and NGF/TrkA in acute stroke (Fig. 8).
The previous studies conﬁrm a robust effect of PDE5 inhibition on
stroke recovery. For example, PDE5 inhibitors can reduce neurological
deﬁcits, increase cerebral blood ﬂow, inﬂuence endothelial function
and improve functional recovery by increasing the brain level of cGMP
and triggering neurogenesis after stroke (Menniti et al., 2009; Zhang
et al., 2002, 2005, 2006). Moreover, we have demonstrated that sildenaﬁl has a signiﬁcant protective effect on neuronal network potentiation
in acute stroke (Chen et al., 2014). These studies suggest that PDE5 inhibitors have the potential to be developed into an effective therapeutic
agent in treating ischemic disorders, but the mechanism still needs further investigation.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that yonkenaﬁl protects
against the effects of ischemic injury, ranging from neurological deﬁcits
to edema. Yonkenaﬁl protects neuronal networks during stroke by increasing neuronal survival and enhancing the connections between
neurons, and this is mediated by cGMP-dependent Nogo-R, BDNF/
TrkB, and NGF/TrkA pathways.

Fig. 8. Proposed mechanisms for the neuroprotective role of yonkenaﬁl. In this model, yonkenaﬁl activates RhoA through a cGMP-dependent Nogo-R pathway. RhoA further activates
PTEN, which negatively regulates Akt signaling. Meanwhile, Akt signaling promotes NGF/TrkA and BDNF/TrkB to modulate neuronal survival and control synaptic function.
