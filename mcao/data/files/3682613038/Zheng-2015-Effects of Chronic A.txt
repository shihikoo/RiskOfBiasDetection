Eﬀects of Chronic Alcohol Exposure on the Modulation
of Ischemia-Induced Glutamate Release via Cannabinoid
Receptors in the Dorsal Hippocampus
Lei Zheng, Xiaoda Wu, Xiao Dong, Xinli Ding, and Cunfeng Song

Background: Chronic alcohol consumption is a critical contributing factor to ischemic stroke, as it
enhances ischemia-induced glutamate release, leading to more severe excitotoxicity and brain damage.
But the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood.
Methods: We evaluated the eﬀects of chronic alcohol exposure on the modulation of ischemiainduced glutamate release via CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors during middle cerebral artery
occlusion, using in vivo microdialysis coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography, in alcohol-na€ıve rats or rats after 1 or 30 days of withdrawal from chronic ethanol intake (6% v/v for 14 days).
Results: Intra-dorsal hippocampus (DH) infusions of ACEA or JWH133, selective CB1 or CB2
receptor agonists, respectively, decreased glutamate release in the DH in alcohol-na€ıve rats in a dosedependent manner. Such an eﬀect was reversed by co-infusions of SR141716A or AM630, selective
CB1 or CB2 receptor antagonists, respectively. After 30 days, but not 1 day of withdrawal, ischemia
induced an enhancement in glutamate release in the DH, as compared with non-alcohol-treated control
group. Intra-DH infusions of JWH133, but not ACEA, inhibited ischemia-induced glutamate release in
the DH after 30 days of withdrawal. Finally, 1 day of withdrawal did not alter the protein level of CB1
or CB2 receptors in the DH, as compared to non-alcohol-treated control rats. Whereas 30 days of withdrawal robustly decreased the protein level of CB1 receptors, but failed to alter the protein level of CB2
receptors, in the DH, as compared to non-alcohol-treated control rats.
Conclusions: Together, these ﬁndings suggest that loss of expression/function of CB1 receptors, but
not CB2 receptors in the DH, is correlated with the enhancement of ischemia-induced glutamate release
after prolonged alcohol withdrawal.

EAVY ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION increases the
risk for hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke (Caicoya
et al., 1999; Gill et al., 1986, 1991; Hansagi et al., 1995;
Hillbom and Kaste, 1983), which leads to high mortality and
long-term disability in humans. Furthermore, excessive
chronic ethanol (EtOH) consumption is associated with
more severe ischemic strokes in humans (Ducroquet et al.,
2013). Similarly, animal studies have shown that chronic
alcohol intake aggravates ischemia-induced brain damage
(Sun et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2010, 2011), partly due to
enhanced glutamate release during ischemia (Favalli et al.,
2002; Goyagi et al., 2011; Masoero et al., 2000). However,
the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are
poorly understood.

Various studies have shown that endocannabinoids are
released following brain injury, and stimulation of cannabinoid receptors, including CB1 and CB2 receptors, may
protect against excitotoxic damage during the acute stage of
injury (Hillard, 2008; Mechoulam and Shohami, 2007;
Shohami et al., 2011). Activation of neuronal CB1 cannabinoid receptors attenuates excitotoxic glutamatergic
neurotransmission. For instance, stimulation of CB1 receptors reduces presynaptic glutamate release in various brain
regions, including the hippocampus (Domenici et al., 2006).
Furthermore, while acute stimulation of CB2 receptors in
the hippocampus has little eﬀect on the excitatory synaptic
transmission (Kim and Li, 2015), stimulation of CB2
receptors on the microglia cells protects striatal neurodegeneration against excitotoxicity (Ashton and Glass, 2007;
Palazuelos et al., 2009). Given that CB1 and CB2 receptors
are located in neurons and glia cells (Gong et al., 2006;
Moldrich and Wenger, 2000; Stella, 2010), and ischemia
likely induces glutamate release from both neuronal and non
neuronal pools, which are critical for excitotoxicity, it will be
necessary to investigate the role of CB1 and CB2 receptors in
modulation of ischemia-induced glutamate release per se.
Furthermore, both human and animal studies have
shown that chronic alcohol intake alters the function of
cannabinoid receptors. Speciﬁcally, alcohol dependence is

associated with a widespread reduction of cannabinoid CB1
receptor binding in the human brain, which persists at least 2
to 4 weeks into abstinence (Hirvonen et al., 2013). Additionally, chronic alcohol exposure leads to down-regulation of
CB1 receptor function and its signal transduction in laboratory animals (Hungund and Basavarajappa, 2004; Moranta
et al., 2006). Moreover, mice that developed alcohol
preference have shown reduced CB2 gene expression in the
ventral striatum (Ishiguro et al., 2007). Therefore, given this
dynamic inﬂuence of CB1 and CB2 receptor expression and
function by chronic alcohol exposure, it will be necessary to
evaluate the eﬀects of chronic alcohol exposure on the
putative role of CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors in
modulation of ischemia-induced glutamate release in vivo.
The dorsal hippocampus (DH) is characterized by high
density of CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors (Gong et al.,
2006; Moldrich and Wenger, 2000). Given that the
hippocampal formation is the brain region most sensitive to
ischemic damage (Akai and Yanagihara, 1993; Ordy et al.,
1993; Schmidt-Kastner and Freund, 1991; Sugawara et al.,
2002), this study ﬁrst evaluated the role of CB1 and CB2
receptors in the DH in modulation of ischemia-induced
glutamate release. To this end, CB1 or CB2 receptor selective
agonists ACEA or JWH133, respectively, were infused into
the DH via reverse dialysis, during middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO), and the dose-dependent eﬀects of
ACEA or JWH133 on ischemia-induced glutamate release in
the DH were assessed in alcohol-na€ıve rats. To eliminate the
putative nonselective eﬀects of these pharmacological agents,
we also assessed the eﬀects of co-infusion of ACEA with
SR141716A, selective CB1 receptor antagonist, or co-infusion of JWH133 with AM630, selective CB2 receptor
antagonist, on ischemia-induced glutamate release in the
DH. Furthermore, we assessed the eﬀects of the lowest
pharmacologically eﬀective dose of ACEA and JWH133 on
ischemia-induced glutamate release in the DH in alcohol-fed
rats, following either 1 or 30 days of withdrawal. Finally, we
examined the protein level of CB1 and CB2 receptors in the
DH in alcohol-na€ıve and alcohol-fed rats following 1 or
30 days of withdrawal.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 218) that weighed 275 to 300 g at
the time of surgery were housed individually under 12-hour light/
dark cycle and had free access to food and water. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Liaocheng Third People’s Hospital. The housing and
treatment of the rats followed the guidelines of the “Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Rats” (Institute of Laboratory Animal
Resources, Commission on Life Sciences 2011).
Stereotaxic Surgery
Prior to surgery, animals were anesthetized with isoﬂurane
(Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL), and their heads were
placed into a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA).

1909

The body temperature of the rats was controlled by a rectal thermometer and maintained at +37°C using a CMA 450 temperature
controller (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). The scalp was
incised to expose the skull, and bregma and lambda were aligned in
the same horizontal plane. All animals received microdialysis guide
cannulae (20 gauge, 14 mm) aimed at the DH (AP 3.8 mm; M/L
1.8 mm; D/V 2.0 mm). The A/P, M/L, and D/V coordinates
were based on bregma, midline, and dura, respectively (Paxinos and
Watson, 1998). Cannulae were anchored with 3 stainless steel screws
and dental acrylic. Obturators (25 gauge, 14 mm) were inserted into
the cannulae to prevent their occlusion. Animals were allowed at
least 1 week to recover from surgery.
Chronic Alcohol Administration
Once animals recovered from surgery, some of the rats (n = 89)
were randomly separated into 2 treatment groups. One group of rats
received a dextrose-containing liquid diet, and a second group
received a nutritionally complete liquid diet containing 6% (v/v)
EtOH (Abbott Laboratories) in their home cages for 14 days. All
group of rats received the diet without EtOH during the ﬁrst 3 days
of treatment. Water was available ad libitum throughout the treatment. On the day of withdrawal, the diet was removed, and about
100 ll of tail blood samples were immediately collected from animals followed by analysis of blood alcohol concentration using
AM1 Analox Analyzer (Analox Instruments, Lunenburg, MA).
The rats were then continuously fed with laboratory chow for the
rest of the experiments. This chronic alcohol administration protocol was modiﬁed based on an established method, which has been
previously shown to reliably induce EtOH dependence (Bertotto
et al., 2006; Devaud et al., 1996; Weiss et al., 1996), and it produced
blood EtOH concentrations ranging from 91 to 131 mg/dl at the
end of the treatment in this study. The average amount of diet (ml)
consumed and the average body weights for each group of rats are
provided in Tables S1 and S2.
Cerebral Ischemia Model
The MCAO protocol was modiﬁed based on the method
described earlier (Laing et al., 1993). Brieﬂy, a ventral neck incision
was made and the right common carotid artery, the external carotid
artery, and the internal carotid artery were exposed and carefully
isolated. A monoﬁlament nylon ﬁlament was then introduced into
the internal carotid artery and gently advanced about 19 mm to
block the blood ﬂow of the right middle cerebral artery. The wound
was closed with surgical glue immediately after the ischemia procedures were completed. The microdialysis samples were collected
during the 120 minutes of occlusion. After microdialysis experiment
was completed, rats were euthanized with ketamine/xylazine (300
and 30 mg/kg, respectively), and the brains were dissected out, postﬁxed with 10% formaldehyde, sectioned at 75 lm, and stained with
cresyl violet (Kodak, Rochester, NY). The most ventral point of
each probe track was mapped onto schematics from the rat brain
atlas (Paxinos and Watson, 1998).
In Vivo Microdialysis
On the experiment day, rats were anesthetized with isoﬂurane
(Abbott Laboratories) using a nose cone and a microdialysis probe
with 1 mm membrane was introduced into the guide cannulae
2 hours prior to the beginning of the dialysis experiments. The
probe was continuously perfused with dialysis buﬀer (KCl 2.7 mM,
NaCl 140 mM, CaCl2 1.2 mM, MgCl2 1.2 mM, plus 0.2 mM phosphate-buﬀered saline to achieve a pH = 7.4). The ﬂow rate was
2 ll/min during the whole experiments. Following collection of 4
baseline samples, MCAO was introduced and simultaneously
ACEA (0, 10, 20, 50 lM; selective CB1 receptor agonist) or

JWH133 (0, 10, 50, 100 lM; selective CB2 receptor agonist) alone
or with SR141716A (100 lM; selective CB1 receptor agonist) or
AM630 (100 lM; selective CB2 receptor agonist) was infused into
the DH via reverse dialysis in separate groups of rats. Four
additional samples were collected from the DH. Microdialysis
samples were collected every 15 minutes into 10 ll of 0.05 mM HCl
in 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and either immediately underwent
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of glutamate or were stored at 80°C. Samples were stored no more than
2 weeks.
High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
The glutamate HPLC system consisted of a 25 cm (5 lm) octadecylsilane column, a Shimadzu LC-10AD solvent delivery system
(Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan), a Shimadzu SIL-10AD
autosampler, and a ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer (Shimadzu RF10AXL). Samples underwent derivatization (20 ll sample + 20 ll
ﬂuoraldehyde) before being injected onto the column via the
autosampler. The ﬂow rate of the mobile phase (62 mM NaH2PO4,
0.5% v/v tetrahydrofuran and 40% v/v methanol, pH = 6.3 with
6 N NaOH) was 1.0 ml/min. The ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer
detected glutamate with an excitation wavelength of 260 nm and an
emission wavelength of 455 nm. The external standard curve ranged
from 0.5 to 25 pmol for quantiﬁcation.
Western Blot
Rats were randomly separated into 2 withdrawal groups. After 1
or 30 days of withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure, rats
(n = 64; 8/group) were euthanized via rapid decapitation. Brains
were dissected out, ﬂash frozen in isopentane at 20°C, and stored
at 80°C. DH punches were taken with 19 Ga neuropunches (Fine
Science Tools, Heidelberg, Germany). Punched tissue was stored at
80°C in lysis buﬀer, containing 10 mM HEPES, 1% SDS, and 19
protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma Aldrich,
Shanghai, China). Tissue samples were homogenized manually and
boiled in a dry heat block at 100°C for 10 minutes. The protein concentration of the samples was determined using the Biorad DC ProteinTM Assay kit (Hercules, CA). Five micrograms of total proteins
was added to each lane, separated on 10% Tris–HCl polyacrylamide gel at 120 V for 1 hour, and transferred to a polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride membrane (Millipore Co., Billerica, MA) for 1 hour at
100 V. Membranes were then blocked in 5% milk for 1 hour and
incubated with rabbit anti-CB1 polyclonal antibody (1:1,000, SC20754; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Dallas, TX) overnight (16 to
20 hours) at 4°C. Membranes were then incubated in donkey antirabbit polyclonal secondary antibody (1:10,000; GE Healthcare,
Piscataway, NJ), conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 hour
at room temperature, followed by development with an enhanced
chemiluminescence system (Pierce Biotech, Rockford, IL). CB1,
CB2, and b-actin protein levels were quantiﬁed by densitometry,
using NIH ImageJ software (Bethesda, MD). CB1 and CB2 levels
were normalized to the levels of the loading control,
b-actin, and to CB1 and CB2 levels in non-alcohol-treated controls.

using unpaired t-tests. Alpha was set at 0.05.

RESULTS
Histology
A schematic illustrating microdialysis probe placements
showing representative probe tracts is shown in Fig. 1. The
most ventral point of the microdialysis probe tracks was
located within the DH (n = 154) unilaterally and was
counterbalanced between 2 hemispheres across all rats. The
resulting sample sizes per group are reported in the ﬁgure
captions of Figs 2–4. Animals with incorrect dialysis probe
placements were removed from the study.

Statistical Analysis
Microdialysis data were converted to percentage of baseline in
order to avoid variability associated with diﬀerences in probe placement and probe recovery. To this end, extracellular basal levels of
glutamate were obtained from the average of the ﬁrst 4 samples
collected prior to induction of MCAO. The glutamate levels were
then expressed as percentages of basal values. A 2-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) with 1 repeated measure (time) was used to analyze neurochemical data. Signiﬁcant ANOVA main and interaction
eﬀects were further investigated using a modiﬁed least signiﬁcant

Withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure diﬀerentially
altered protein level of CB1 and CB2 receptors in the DH.
Speciﬁcally, as shown in Fig. 5A, the protein level of CB1
receptors in the DH was reduced after 30 days of
withdrawal, t(14) = 13.32, p = 0.0001, but not after 1 day of
withdrawal, t(14) = 0.12, p = 0.91. In contrast to CB1
receptors, the protein level of CB2 receptors in the DH was
not altered after either 1 day (Fig. 5B), t(14) = 0.18,
p = 0.86, or 30 days, t(14) = 0.22, p = 0.71, of withdrawal.
DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrated that intra-DH infusions
of ACEA or JWH133, selective CB1 or CB2 receptor
agonists, respectively, dose-dependently decreased glutamate
release in the DH in alcohol-na€ıve rats. Such an eﬀect was

CB1 or CB2 receptor antagonists, respectively, suggesting
that CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors play an inhibitory
role to regulate ischemia-induced glutamate release in the
DH. Furthermore, after 30 days of withdrawal, but not
1 day of withdrawal, ischemia induced an enhancement in
glutamate release in the DH, as compared with non-alcoholtreated control group. Intra-DH infusions of JWH133, but
not ACEA, inhibited ischemia-induced glutamate release in
the DH after 30 days of withdrawal. Finally, 1 day of withdrawal did not alter the protein level of CB1 or CB2 receptors in the DH, as compared to non-alcohol-treated control
rats. However, 30 days of withdrawal robustly decreased the
protein level of CB1 receptors, but failed to alter the protein
level of CB2 receptors, in the DH, as compared to non-alcohol-treated control rats. These results suggested that a loss of
expression/function of CB1 receptors, but not CB2 receptors,
caused a loss of inhibitory control of excitotoxicity within
the DH, thereby likely resulting in enhanced excitotoxicity in
the DH upon ischemia during a prolonged withdrawal from
repeated alcohol intake.
Consistent with previous studies (Choi, 1996; Lipton,
1999; Ogawa et al., 2007; Szydlowska and Tymianski, 2010;
Zheng et al., 2003), the present study demonstrated that
ischemia induced a robust release of extracellular glutamate
in the DH in na€ıve rats during the ischemic period. While
extracellular glutamate release within the DH may arise from
glutamatergic terminals via vesicular release, as well as from
glia via cystine/glutamate antiporters, it is still not clear how
ischemia aﬀects these releasing pools of glutamate. Some
studies have shown that nonsynaptic release of neurotransmitter was increased during ischemia (Milusheva et al.,
2003). Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the
cystine/glutamate antiporter attenuated ischemia-gated
currents and cell death after oxygen and glucose deprivation
(Soria et al., 2014). Additionally, optogenetic inactivation of
glia cells led to cessation of glutamate release and relief of
ischemic brain damage in vivo (Beppu et al., 2014).
However, other studies also demonstrated that, instead of
removing extracellular glutamate to protect neurons,
neuronal glutamate transporters can release glutamate
during ischemia, triggering neuronal death (Rossi et al.,
2000). Furthermore, presynaptic silencing of glutamatergic
terminals is suﬃcient to reduce excitotoxic damage resulting
from hypoxia and oxygen/glucose deprivation (Hogins et al.,
2011). Thus, we cannot ascribe the eﬀect of MCAO on the
glutamate release in the DH to a speciﬁc glutamate releasing
pool in the present study.
The present study provided the direct evidence that CB1
and CB2 receptors play an inhibitory role in modulation of
ischemia-induced glutamate release in the DH. However, the
mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unknown.
CB1 receptors are mainly localized presynaptically (Hill
et al., 2007; Katona et al., 1999; Kawamura et al., 2006;
Varma et al., 2001; Wilson et al., 2001), and CB2 receptors
are mainly postsynaptic in the hippocampus (Brusco et al.,
2008). Both CB1 and CB2 receptors are present on the non-

neuronal cells (Han et al., 2012; Navarrete and Araque,
2008, 2010). While acute activation of CB2 receptors has
little eﬀect on synaptic activity in the hippocampus (Kim and
Li, 2015), stimulation of CB1 receptors reduces presynaptic
release of glutamate in the hippocampus (Katona et al.,
1999; Wang, 2003), increases intracellular Ca2+ level in
astrocytes (Navarrete and Araque, 2010), and likely triggers
an exocytotic release of glutamate (Halassa et al., 2007;
Navarrete and Araque, 2008, 2010). In addition to triggering
robust release of glutamate, ischemia can also enhance
endocannabinoids release (Hillard, 2008) and alter the
expression of cannabinoid receptors. For example, both
hypoxia–ischemia and MCAO can induce CB2-positive
microglia in rat brains (Ashton et al., 2007). Furthermore, it
is possible that the ischemia may alter the normal physiological functions of CB1 and CB2 receptors. To support this
hypothesis, a previous study has demonstrated that ischemia
reversed the function of glutamate transporter (Rossi et al.,
2000). Future studies using more selective tools other than
pharmacological manipulations will certainly help to
elucidate the important role of the cannabinoid receptors in
modulation of ischemia-induced glutamate release.
However, adding more complexity to this puzzle, alcohol
intake is likely able to alter ischemia-induced glutamate
release. While a previous study reported that 24-hour withdrawal from chronic EtOH treatment (10% v/v in drinking
water for 28 days) was able to robustly increase glutamate
release in frontoparietal cerebral cortex (Favalli et al., 2002),
the present study demonstrated that a long-term, but not
short-term, withdrawal from repeated alcohol exposure
potentiated the ischemia-induced glutamate release in the
DH. Meanwhile, the inhibitory eﬀects of CB2 receptors on
ischemia-induced glutamate release in the DH seem to be
enhanced after a long-term, but not short-term, withdrawal.
While this phenomenon is unlikely due to the changes in
CB2 receptor expression in the present study, it cannot be
ruled out that long-term withdrawal induced adaptations
after chronic alcohol exposure may alter CB2 receptor-mediated signaling. Hence, these results together suggest that
adaptive changes following the withdrawal from chronic
alcohol intake can lead to an increased ischemia-induced
excitotoxicity.
While the present study demonstrated that only longterm withdrawal from chronic alcohol intake is correlated
with a loss of CB1 receptor function/expression in the DH,
previous studies have shown that chronic alcohol exposure
per se reduced the expression/function of CB1 receptors.
For instance, CB1 receptors’ expression and signaling were
down-regulated in synaptic plasma membranes isolated
from mouse brain immediately after chronic alcohol exposure (Basavarajappa and Hungund, 1999; Basavarajappa
et al., 1998). Additionally, using a higher alcohol concentration and more prolonged treatment period (i.e., 10% v/
v, 52 days), chronic alcohol exposure has been shown to
reduce mRNA expression of CB1 receptors in the rat hippocampus (Ortiz et al., 2004). However, 24-hour with-

drawal from a subchronic alcohol treatment (2 g/kg,
intraperitoneally, 7 days), but not acute alcohol or subchronic alcohol per se, can desensitize CB1 receptors in the
hippocampus of rats (Moranta et al., 2006). Interestingly,
while withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure did not
alter the expression of CB2 receptors in the DH in the present study, it has been demonstrated that mice that developed an alcohol preference have shown reduced CB2 gene
expression in the ventral striatum (Ishiguro et al., 2007).
Hence, it seems that the eﬀects of chronic alcohol exposure
on the expression/function of CB1 or CB2 receptors are
likely dependent on animal species, alcohol treatment procedure, speciﬁc brain regions, or withdrawal period. Given
the complex in vivo localization and function of CB1 and
CB2 receptors, it is still not clear which subpopulations of
CB1 and CB2 receptors are aﬀected by alcohol withdrawal.
Thus, future studies will be necessary to examine the eﬀects
of chronic alcohol exposure on subpopulations of cannabinoid receptors.
In summary, the present study provided direct evidence
that CB1 and CB2 receptors in the DH play an inhibitory
role in the modulation of ischemia-induced glutamate
release. Furthermore, long-term withdrawal from chronic
alcohol intake can enhance ischemia-induced glutamate
release, which is correlated with a loss of expression/function
of CB1 receptors, but not CB2 receptors, in the DH. Given
the complex localization and function of these cannabinoid
receptors in vivo, it will be necessary to dissect the role of
speciﬁc subpopulation of cannabinoid receptors in the
process of ischemia-induced excitotoxicity. Such a line of
research would not only enhance our understandings of the
mechanisms of ischemia-induced brain injury, but also help
the development of eﬀective pharmacotherapies for the
treatment and prevention of ischemia-induced brain damage
in certain human populations who may have a higher risk
for stroke.
