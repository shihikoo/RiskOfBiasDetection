Introduction

Ischemic stroke is an acute cerebrovascular event associated
with brain tissue damage due to signiﬁcant deprivation of
oxygen and glucose caused by a reduction or complete
blockade of artery supplying blood to the brain (Chen et al.,
2011). Already ﬁve minutes after the onset of ischemia
neurons begin to die (Radermacher et al., 2013). Therefore,
early restoration of cerebral blood ﬂow by using recombinant
tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is crucial for sustaining
neuronal viability (Radermacher et al., 2013). Unfortunately,
reperfusion is believed to contribute to delayed secondary
brain injury because the freshly arriving oxygen will serve as
a substrate for excessive reactive oxidative species (ROS)
production (Chen et al., 2011; Radermacher et al., 2013;
Schaller and Graf, 2004).
Mitochondria have long been known to play a critical role
in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury,
via ROS generation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and mitochondrial (type II) apoptosis (Christophe and Nicolas, 2006;
Turrens, 2003). Mitochondria are abundant in cerebral tissue,
and mitochondrial complex I is a major source of cerebral
intracellular ROS (Turrens, 2003). Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury promotes secondary mitochondrial dysfunction,
which is characterized by reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), depletion of ATP synthesis, and
inducing a sudden increase in permeability of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). Finally, excessive
amounts of ROS are released (Heo et al., 2005; Sanderson
et al., 2013; Siesjo et al., 1999). Imbalance between generation
and degradation of ROS collectively leads to oxidative stress
(Radermacher et al., 2013). Much evidence suggests that
oxidative stress is a fundamental mechanism of cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion injury (Chen et al., 2011; Schaller and
Graf, 2004). Therefore, improving mitochondrial dysfunction
and inhibiting oxidative stress are beneﬁcial in the treatment
of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.

MPTP is considered to be one of the most important
targets for modulating mitochondrial dysfunction following
cerebral ischemic injury (Schinzel et al., 2005; Tsujimoto
et al., 2006; Vaseva et al., 2012). MPTP is formed at contact
sites between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes
and consists of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC),
the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), and Cyclophilin D
(CypD), the mitochondrial isoform of the peptidylprolyl cistrans isomerase cyclophilin chaperone family located on the
inner membrane of mitochondria (Elrod and Molkentin, 2013).
According to Halestrap, MPTP is closed during the ischemic
period and opening has been shown to occur during reperfusion (Halestrap, 2009). In response to opening of MPTP, MMP
is dissipated and the death effector proteins such as Cytochrome C (Cyt C) are released from the inter-membrane
space, which initiate mitochondrial (type II) apoptosis
(Gómez-Crisóstomo et al., 2013). In addition, the neuroprotective effect of ischemic post-conditioning or treatment with
cyclosporin A (CsA) in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury
contributes to inhibition of MPTP opening (Cho et al., 2013;
Siesjo et al., 1999; Sun et al., 2012). However, as an immunosuppressant drug, the serious adverse reaction of the
immune system limits its clinical application (Rezzani, 2006).
Gallic acid (GA, 3, 4, 5-trihydroxybenzoic acid, Fig. 1) is one
of the most important plant polyphenolic compounds, which
can be abundantly found in natural plants, tea, and red wines
(Shahrzad et al., 2001). Recent research ﬁnd that GA attenuates streptozotocin-induced memory deﬁcits by inhibiting
oxidative stress and activating related enzyme-dependent
signaling systems (Kade and Rocha, 2013; Mansouri et al.,
2013). In addition, as the impact of GA on the regulation of
systems energy metabolism in rat, the relationship between
GA and mitochondria has become an active topic of exploration (Shi et al., 2013). However, no study has tested the effects
of GA on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, and the
mechanisms are also barely known. In the current study,
we have investigated the potential roles and mechanisms of
GA in hypoxia/reoxygenation induced by sodium hydrosulﬁte
(Na2S2O4) in vitro and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion induced
by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in vivo.

Na2S2O4-induced hypoxia/reoxygenation decreased cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner. As shown in
Fig. 2A, the viability of the cells exposed to Na2S2O4 at
concentrations of 1–5 mM for 2 h and replacing the normal
medium for an additional 2 h decreased to 98.3276.58%,
98.0372.59%, 89.3076.08%, 70.7178.78%, and 69.2178.48%
of the control value, respectively. Compared to the control
group, Na2S2O4 signiﬁcantly decreased the cell viability (% of
control) at 4 mM (Fig. 2A, n¼ 5, Po0.01). Based on this result,

a treatment of 4 mM Na2S2O4 for 2 h and replacing the normal
medium for an additional 2 h was used to induce SH-SY5Y
cell hypoxia/reoxygenation injury in subsequent experiments. Compared to the model group, pretreatment with
GA at 0.1 and 1 μM did not attenuate hypoxia/reoxygenationinduced cytotoxicity (Fig. 2B, n ¼5, P40.05). We therefore
increased the amount of GA to 10 μM. Compared to the model
group, the cell viability signiﬁcantly increased to 92.9872.79%
of the control value at 10 μM (Fig. 2B, n¼ 5, Po0.05). These

data demonstrate that GA protects SH-SY5Y cells against
hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cytotoxicity in a concentrationdependent manner.
In another experiment, 48 h of treatment with various
concentrations (0.1–10 μM) of GA alone did not lead to any
apparent increase in the viability of cells (% of control) (Fig. 2B,
n¼ 5, P40.05). Consequently, 0.1, 1 and 10 μM of GA were chosen
as drug treatment concentration in subsequent experiments.

2.2.
GA reverses hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced
oxidative stress
Oxidative stress is known to cause secondary neuronal damage
in hypoxia/reoxygenation injury, which is the result of an
imbalance between the generation and degradation of ROS
(Radermacher et al., 2013). In this study, a ﬂuorescent probe,
Dichloroﬂuorescin diacetate (DCF-DA), was used as a speciﬁc
marker for quantitative intracellular ROS formation. In comparison to the control group, the intracellular DCF-ﬂuorescence
intensity in the model group signiﬁcantly increased (Fig. 3A-a, b;
B, n¼ 3, Po0.01). Compared to the model group, pretreatment

with either 1 or 10 μM GA for 24 h before Na2S2O4 exposure
dramatically decreased the intracellular DCF-ﬂuorescence
intensity (Fig. 3A-b, d, e; B, n¼ 3, Po0.01); moreover, the
intracellular DCF-ﬂuorescence intensity was not signiﬁcantly
changed in the GA 0.1 μM group (Fig. 3A-b, c; B, n¼ 3, P40.05).
Lipid peroxidation product is also widely used as a marker
of cell membrane damage induced by oxidative stress (Sies,
1997). In the present study, we also tested the level of
malondialdehyde (MDA) after pretreatment with GA. As
shown in Fig. 3C, the levels of intracellular MDA signiﬁcantly
increased in the control group (0.658570.2538 nmol/mg protein) compared with the model group (8.021971.2785 nmol/
mg protein) (Fig. 3C, n¼ 5, Po0.01). Compared to the model
group, pretreatment with either 1 or 10 μM GA for 24 h before
Na2S2O4 exposure signiﬁcantly decreased the levels of intracellular MDA to 0.880670.3887 and 0.325970.1142 nmol/mg
protein, respectively (Fig. 3C, n ¼5, Po0.01). There was no
signiﬁcant charge between the model group and the 0.1 μM
GA group (Fig. 3C, n¼ 5, P40.05). Taken together, these
ﬁndings suggest a role for GA in promoting SH-SY5Y cell
survival partially through inhibiting oxidative stress.

and then incubated with the MitoSOX Red. (A) Intracellular red ﬂuorescence of MitoSOX Red was determined by ﬂuorescent

ﬂuorescence of MitoSOX Red was measured by ﬂow cytometry. Histogram showing the intracellular ﬂuorescence intensity

2.3.
GA inhibits hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced
mitochondrial ROS accumulation
During reoxygenation after hypoxia, increased oxygen supply
results in overproduction of ROS in mitochondria (Christophe
and Nicolas, 2006; Heo et al., 2005; Siesjo et al., 1999). In the
current study, a ﬂuorescent probe, MitoSOX Red, was used as
a speciﬁc marker for quantitative mitochondrial ROS accumulation. Compared to the control group, the MitoSOXﬂuorescence intensity in the model group was signiﬁcantly
increased (Fig. 4A-a, b; B, n ¼3, Po0.01). Pretreatment with GA
10 μM effectively suppressed the level of mitochondrial ROS
by signiﬁcantly decreasing the MitoSOX-ﬂuorescence intensity (Fig. 4A-b, e; B, n¼3, Po0.05). There was no signiﬁcant
charge between model group and 0.1 or 1 μM GA group
(Fig. 4A-b, c, d; B, n¼ 3, P40.05). These data indicate that GA

2.4.
GA reverses hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced
mitochondrial dysfunctions
To establish whether GA attenuated hypoxia/reoxygenationinduced mitochondrial ROS accumulation by modulating
mitochondrial dysfunctions, the level of MMP, oxygen consumption, and ATP synthesis was evaluated. The lipophilic
cationic probe 5, 50 , 6, 60 -tetrachloro-1, 10 , 3, 30 -tetraethylbenzimidazol carbocyanine iodide (JC-1) was used to evaluate
MMP. As shown in Fig. 5A-a, b; B, the control cells clearly
appeared red. However, hypoxia/reoxygenation injury rapidly
caused MMP dissipation, as shown by the increase in green

Fig. 5 – GA reverses hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions. Cells were treated as described in Fig. 3 and
then incubated with the membrane potential indicator JC-1. (A) Intracellular red and green ﬂuorescence of JC-1 was
determined by ﬂuorescent inverted microscope. A-a: control; A-b: model; A-c: 0.1 μM GA; A-d: 1 μM GA; A-e: 10 μM GA. (B) The

ﬂuorescence and the concomitant disappearance of red
ﬂuorescence, which signiﬁcantly decreased the red/green
ﬂuorescence intensity ratio (% of control) at 43.4877.22%
(Fig. 5A-a, b; B, n¼ 3, Po0.01). Compared with the model
group, pretreatment with either 1 or 10 μM GA signiﬁcantly
attenuated the changes in MMP as indicated by the repression of green ﬂuorescence and restoration of red ﬂuorescence. The red/green ﬂuorescence intensity ratio was
increased to 71.7177.54% and 85.7973.95% of control, respectively (Fig. 5A-b, d, e; B, n ¼3, Po0.01). Moreover there was no
signiﬁcant charge between model group and 0.1 μM GA group
(Fig. 5A-b, c; B, n¼ 3, P40.05).
Clark electrode was used for determining the level of
oxygen consumption. Compared with the control group, the
level of oxygen consumption (nmol/min/104 cells) signiﬁcantly
decreased from 0.090370.0125 to 0.062270.0019 (Fig. 5C, n¼5,
Po0.01). Compared with the model group, the level of oxygen
consumption (nmol/min/104 cells) in the 10 μM GA group was
increased to 0.075170.0055 (Fig. 5C, n¼5, Po0.05). Moreover
there was no signiﬁcant charge between model group and 0.1
or 1 μM GA group (Fig. 5C, n¼5, P40.05).
Consistent with the oxygen consumption data, the ATP
content was signiﬁcantly decreased in model group
(27.1870.01 nmol/mg protein) in comparison with control
group (58.3172.94 nmol/mg protein). (Fig. 5D, n ¼3, Po0.01).
It was observed that pretreatment with either 1 or 10 μM GA
showed a protective response in terms of signiﬁcantly
increased ATP content to 47.6770.67 and 51.3273.31 nmol/
mg protein, respectively, when compared with model group
(Fig. 5D, n¼ 3, Po0.01). These data suggest that GA exerts
antioxidative activity partially by modulating hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions.

2.5.
GA prevents calcium-induced MPTP opening
in isolated mitochondria
The MPTP opening leads to dissipation of the MMP and a
sudden decrease in ATP levels, which is considered to be one
of the most important signs of mitochondrial dysfunction
following cerebral ischemic injury (Schinzel et al., 2005;
Vaseva et al., 2012). To investigate the effect of GA on MPTP
viability, mitochondria isolated from rat livers were subjected
to be treated with 100 μM CaCl2 to induce MPTP opening. The
ΔA540 value in the model group was signiﬁcantly higher than
control groups, while ΔA540 value in the CsA group was
signiﬁcantly lower than model groups (Fig. 6B, n¼5, Po0.01).
This observation conﬁrmed in our system that mitochondrial
swelling resulted from calcium-induced opening of the MPTP.
Mitochondria pretreatment with either 1 or 10 μM GA for 5 min
before CaCl2 exposure failed to swell under identical conditions. The ΔA540 value in the GA 1 and 10 μM group was
signiﬁcantly lower than model groups (Fig. 6B, n¼5, Po0.01).
These data suggest that MPTP is one of the key targets of GA
regulation of mitochondrial dysfunctions.

2.6.
GA protects rats against transient focal cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion injury
To further assess the neuroprotective effects of GA on
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, a model of transient

focal ischemia produced by MCAO was employed. According
to the doses of treatment of streptozotocin-induced cerebral
oxidative stress (Mansouri et al., 2013), we designed the doses
of three groups in preliminary experiments as 50 mg/kg,
37.5 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg respectively. Compared with the
MCAO group, the infarct volume (% of the contralateral
hemisphere) in the GA (50 mg/kg) group was signiﬁcantly
smaller than that of the MCAO group (Supplementary Fig. 2,
n ¼5, Po0.01). However, there was no signiﬁcant difference in
the infarct volume between GA (37.5 or 25 mg/kg) and MCAO
groups (Supplementary Fig. 2, n ¼5, P40.05). Consequently, 50
and 25 mg/kg of GA were chosen as drug treatment dose in
the formal experiment.
After MCAO for 2 h, followed by a 24 h reperfusion, the
ischemic infarctions appear white and regularly include the
neocortex and basal ganglia as conﬁrmed by TTC staining
(Fig. 7A). The mean arterial blood pressure, glucose and heart
rate of all animals were all monitored and maintained within
normal ranges in each of the experimental animal (Supplementary Table 1, n¼ 26). No neurological deﬁcits were
observed in the sham-treated rats, whereas rats subjected
to MCAO were scored 2, 3 or 4 in the neurological assessment
following 2 h of reperfusion (Supplementary Fig. 3A, n ¼16,
P40.05). After 24 h of reperfusion, compared with the MCAO
group, the neurological deﬁcits score in the GA 50 mg/kg
group was signiﬁcantly reduced (Supplementary Fig. 3B,
n ¼16, Po0.01), while the GA 25 mg/kg group and CsA
10 mg/kg were not (Supplementary Fig. 3B, n¼ 16, P40.05).
Compared with the sham group, the total infarct volume
(% of contralateral hemisphere) in the MCAO group was
signiﬁcantly increased to 42.0373.22% (Fig. 7A; B, n¼ 8,
Po0.01). Furthermore, compared to the MCAO group, an intravenous injection of GA 50 mg/kg signiﬁcantly reduced the total
infarct volume (% of contralateral hemisphere) to 27.2872.52%
(Fig. 7A; B, n¼ 8, Po0.01). There was no signiﬁcant difference
between the MCAO group and the GA 25 mg/kg group (Fig. 7A; B,
n¼8, P40.05). Of note CsA is thought to be an inhibitor of the
MPTP, and pretreatment with CsA 10 mg/kg decreases infarct
volume after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (Cho et al.,
2013; Muramatsu et al., 2007). In the present study, compared to
the MCAO group, an intravenous injection of CsA 10 mg/kg
signiﬁcantly reduced the total infarct volume (% of contralateral
hemisphere) to 26.4273.03% (Fig. 7A; B, n¼ 8, Po0.01).
We also examined the anti-apoptotic effect of GA using
the dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay in various groups.
Consistent with the infarct volume data, the number of
TUNEL-positive cells (% of DAPIþ cells) signiﬁcantly increased
in the per-infarct region in the MCAO group (27.6570.61%),
whereas TUNEL staining was negative in sham-operated rats
(Fig. 7C-a, b; D, n¼4, Po0.01). Compared with the MCAO
group, pretreatment with GA (50 or 25 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly
reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells (% of DAPIþ
cells) in the per-infarct region to 13.6472.01% and 18.977
2.51%, respectively (Fig. 7C-b, c, d; D, n¼4, Po0.05). In
comparison to the MCAO group, pretreatment with CsA
10 mg/kg signiﬁcantly reduced the number of TUNELpositive cells (% of DAPIþ cells) to 17.6573.61% (Fig. 7C-b, e;
D, n¼ 4, Po0.05).
It is generally accepted that Cyt C released from mitochondria is dependent on opening of the MPTP (Gómez-Crisóstomo

Fig. 6 – GA prevents calcium-induced MPTP opening in isolated mitochondria. (A) The curve is a typical sample of
mitochondrial swelling induced by 100 μM CaCl2. Mitochondrial swelling was measured by monitoring mitochondrial size at
an absorbance of 540 nm. GA (1 μM or 10 μM ﬁnal concentration), CsA (1 μM ﬁnal concentration), and buffer were added to the
mitochondrial suspension 5 min before CaCl2 exposure in each groups. A change of absorbance within 10 min with a
spectrophotometer indicated mitochondrial swelling. (B) The difference (ΔA540) between the maximum A540 reading

et al., 2013; Naranmandura et al., 2012). The data showed that
the expression of Cyt C in mitochondria was signiﬁcantly
reduced in the MCAO group compared to that in sham groups
(Fig. 7E; F, n¼4, Po0.01). In contrast, its cytosolic expression
was signiﬁcantly enhanced in the MCAO group compared with

sham groups (Fig. 7E; G, n¼4, Po0.01). Compared with the
MCAO group, pretreatment with GA 50 mg/kg or CsA 10 mg/kg
signiﬁcantly increased the expression of Cyt C in mitochondria
and reduced the expression of Cyt C in cytosolic (Fig. 7E; F; G,
n¼4, Po0.01). There was no signiﬁcant difference between the

MCAO group and the GA 25 mg/kg group (Fig. 7E; F; G, n¼ 4,
P40.05). The cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury did not
induce any appreciable alteration of the protein levels of COX
Iv and β-actin (Fig. 7E). These data further assessed that GA
exerted neuroprotective effect partially via modulating MPTP
opening. Altogether, these ﬁndings suggest that GA provides
neuroprotection on focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury
in rats.

Discussion

In this study, we have investigated the role of GA in cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion injury both in vitro and in vivo, and
highlighted for the ﬁrst time that modulating of the mitochondrial dysfunction was an important mechanism by GA
attenuating oxidative stress following hypoxia/reoxygenation
insult. In addition, using a model of Ca2þ-induced mitochondrial swelling, we identiﬁed that MPTP probably was one of
the key targets of GA regulation of mitochondrial dysfunctions mentioned above.
Although pathology-associated ROS production emanates
from various different sources, several studies support the
assertion that mitochondrial dysfunctions and nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (NOX)
related to oxidative damage are the major contributors to
neurodegenerative diseases (Christophe and Nicolas, 2006;
Sorce and Krause, 2009). Our results are partially consistent
with this phenomenon, which showed that the level of
mitochondrial ROS in the model group was more increased
than the control group. GA effectively decreased the level of
the mitochondrial ROS and reversed the mitochondrial
respiratory dysfunction, indicating that GA exerts antioxidative activity partially by modulating hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions. We will further
elaborate the antioxidant effect of GA under NOX inhibited
conditions, and the model of ethidium bromide (EB)-induced
mitochondrial DNA depletion will also be used to investigate
the mechanisms of antioxidative effects of GA (Nacarelli
et al., 2014).
MPTP is considered to be one of the most important
targets of mitochondrial dysfunction following cerebral
ischemic injury (Schinzel et al., 2005; Tsujimoto et al., 2006;
Vaseva et al., 2012). In response to opening of MPTP, swollen
mitochondria exhibit an increase in volume, and MMP is
dissipated in response to the arrest of the function of the
respiratory complexes (I–V), which contributes to an inhibition of ATP biosynthesis (Martel et al., 2012). Although the
above data strongly suggested that GA reversed hypoxia/
reoxygenation-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions by inhibiting the MPTP opening, direct proof was necessary to
substantiate its local action of mitochondria.
Mitochondrial swelling was often considered an artifact
until seminal studies by Douglas Hunter and Robert Haworth
in the late seventies who established the MPTP as a tightly
regulated and reversible phenomenon, and a pore formation
was suggested (Haworth and Hunter, 1979). As known, mitochondria are important in regulating the Ca2þ homeostasis,
and Ca2þ is believed to trigger a conformational change of the
responsible proteins in MPTP formation (Eliseev et al., 2009;

135

Rizzuto et al., 2012). Therefore, this process has been investigated in association with Ca2þ-induced mitochondrial swelling. Moreover, there seems to be differences in Ca2þ
sensitivity for comparing brain and liver mitochondria. Grancara et al. found that not brain mitochondria but rat liver
mitochondria could amplify the mitochondria swelling
induced by calcium, and it was concluded that brain mitochondria are insensitive to MPTP induction and swelling by
calcium (Grancara et al., 2012). Furthermore, several studies
have used Ca2þ-induced liver mitochondrial swelling to
evaluate the status of MPTP in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
injury (Schinzel et al., 2005; Vaseva et al., 2012).
To investigate whether the protective effect of GA against
mitochondrial dysfunction was associated with inhibition of
MPTP opening, in this study mitochondria isolated from rat
livers were subjected to be treated with 100 μM CaCl2 to
induce MPTP opening. CsA is a speciﬁc MPTP inhibitor, which
is thought to limit reperfusion injury by antagonizing MPTP
opening and inhibiting mitochondrial (type II) apoptosis (Cho
et al., 2013; Muramatsu et al., 2007). In the current study, we
did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant charge in ΔA540 value between the
CsA pretreatment group and the control group. This observation conﬁrmed in our system that mitochondrial swelling
resulted from calcium-induced opening of the MPTP. Mitochondria pretreatment with either 1 or 10 μM GA for 5 min
before CaCl2 exposure failed to swell under identical conditions, suggesting that GA effectively inhibited the Ca2þinduced MPTP opening. Moreover, it remains controversial
whether mitochondria swelling is associated with MPTP opening. Of note, transient opening of MPTP could be involved in
recombinant Bax-induced proton dissipation without any identiﬁable mitochondria matrix swelling (Jürgensmeier et al., 1998).
In any case, a mere model of mitochondrial swelling for MPTP
formation is inadequate. The MPTP has been suggested as one of
the mechanisms of release of Cyt C from mitochondria during
apoptosis (Gómez-Crisóstomo et al., 2013; Naranmandura et al.,
2012). Consistent with the mitochondrial swelling data, western
blot results demonstrated that the cytosolic concentration of Cyt
C was dramatically reduced in the GA pretreatment group.
Taken together, these data indicate that GA protects against
mitochondrial dysfunction partially through inhibiting the MPTP
opening.
To establish whether GA protected against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in vivo, we analyzed the infarction volume
and cell apoptosis using the model of MCAO. The results of
our in vivo studies ﬁrst showed that GA effectively attenuated
ischemia injury by decreasing the infarct volume and the
number of TUNEL-positive cells in MCAO rats. According to
the references, the rats were administered CsA (10 mg/kg,
intravenous injection) 20 min before ischemia onset (Cho
et al., 2013; Muramatsu et al., 2007). The results clearly
showed the infarct volume and the number of TUNELpositive cells in the CsA treatment group were signiﬁcantly
less than the MCAO group. However, as an immunosuppressor drug, no clinical trial evaluated the impact of CsA in
ischemic stroke (Rezzani, 2006). GA protects against hypoxia/
reoxygenation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and
MCAO-induced cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, indicating that GA is useful as a potential mitochondrial-targeted
protective agent against ischemic stroke.

In conclusion, we highlighted for the ﬁrst time that GA
provides neuroprotection on focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in MCAO rats, and protects against hypoxia/
reoxygenation insult partially through regulation of the
mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, the molecular
mechanisms of GA inhibition of MPTP opening and the
relationship with the effects against mitochondrial dysfunction will be studied in the further experimental investigation.

Cell cultures

Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium (DMEM) and 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS). All cultures were maintained in 10 cm
tissue culture dishes to approximately 90% conﬂuence in a
humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2–95% air at 37 1C.

4.3.2.

Hypoxia/reoxygenation model and GA pre-treatment

Hypoxia/reoxygenation model was measured by Na2S2O4 as
described by Wei et al. (2013) with some modiﬁcations . The
cells were treated with Na2S2O4 at a concentration of 4 mM in
the glucose-free Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS, pH 7.4)
medium for 2 h (hypoxia). Hypoxia/reoxygenation procedure
was terminated by replacing the anoxic medium for an
additional 2 h (reoxygenation). Various concentrations of GA
(0.1, 1, 10 μM) were added into the cultures 24 h before the
onset of Na2S2O4-inducing hypoxia/reoxygenation. Control
cultures were treated in an identical way without inducing
hypoxic injury.

4.3.3.

Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Brieﬂy, MTT was
added to the culture medium at a ﬁnal concentration of
0.5 mg/ml and incubated at 37 1C for 4 h. Then the medium

Measurement of intracellular ROS

DCF-DA (Molecular Probes, Beijing, China) was used to estimate intracellular ROS. Brieﬂy, cells were loaded with 30 μM
DCF-DA at 37 1C for 30 min. The results were visualized using
ﬂuorescent inverted microscope (Nikon, Ti-E Live Cell Imaging System, Japan). Alternatively, ﬂuorescence intensity was
monitored using ﬂow cytometry (BD Immunocytometry Systems, USA) at excitation/emission maxima of 488/525 nm.

measured by a method based on a reaction with thiobarbituric acid. The optical density at 532 nm was measured with a
microplate reader (Molecular Device, Spectra Max 190, USA).

4.3.6.

Determination of mitochondrial ROS levels

MitoSOX Red (Molecular Probes, Beijing, China) was used to
monitor mitochondrial ROS state as recommended by the
manufacturer. Brieﬂy, cells were incubated with 5 μM MitoSOX Red in culture medium for 10 min at 37 1C. Finally, the
results were visualized using a ﬂuorescent inverted microscope (Nikon, Ti-E Live Cell Imaging System, Japan). Alternatively, ﬂuorescence intensity was monitored using ﬂow
cytometry (BD Immunocytometry Systems, USA) at excitation/emission maxima of 510/580 nm.

4.4.1. Assessment of mitochondrial membrane potential
(MMP)
A cationic dye, JC-1 (Molecular Probes, Beijing, China), was
used to monitor the MMP. Brieﬂy, cells were treated with JC-1
10 μM for 30 min incubation at 37 1C. The results were
visualized using a ﬂuorescent inverted microscope (Nikon,

intravenous injection) or CsA (10 mg/kg, intravenous injection)
20 min before ischemia onset. The dosage, administration route
and timing of treatment of CsA and GA were based on previous
literature (Cho et al., 2013; Muramatsu et al., 2007) and our
preliminary experiment. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced
by MCAO (see later). The mean arterial blood pressure, glucose
and heart rate were measured at 30 min before the insertion of
the suture, insertion of the suture, and in the initial 30 min of
reperfusion. After model assessment (Dirnagl, 2010), 40 male SD
rats were used in the experiment (n¼ 8). All animals were
humanely sacriﬁced 24 h following reperfusion under
anesthesia.

Isolation of mitochondria

Mitochondria were isolated from the livers from rat according
to the method of Schinzel et al. (2005). In brief, mitochondria
were isolated from the livers of mice by standard differential
centrifugation and resuspended in isolation buffer (0.2 M
sucrose/10 mM Tris-Mops, pH 7.4/0.1 mM EGTA–Tris) and
stored on ice. Mitochondrial protein content was quantiﬁed
by using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Beyotime, Haimen, Jiangsu, China).

4.4.5. Measurement of mitochondrial permeability transition
pore (MPTP) activity
To estimate MPTP activity, the calcium-induced mitochondrial swelling was carried out using methods previously
published by Schinzel et al. (2005). The isolated mitochondria
were diluted in swelling buffer (120 mmol/L KCl, 10 mmol/L
Tris–HCl, 20 mmol/L MOPS, 5 mmol/L KH2PO4, pH 7.4) to a
ﬁnal concentration of 100 mg protein/ml at 251C. The swelling
was induced by adding 100 μM CaCl2 and measured with a
spectrophotometer (Molecular Device, Spectra Max 190, USA)
as a decrease in light scattering at 540 nm for 10 min. GA
(1 μM or 10 μM ﬁnal concentration) and CsA (1 μM ﬁnal
concentration) were added to the mitochondrial suspension
5 min before CaCl2 exposure in the treatment groups. The
difference (ΔA540) between the maximum A540 reading
(immediately after CaCl2 addition) and the minimum A540
reading (10 min after CaCl2 addition) was used for statistical
analysis.

Animal preparation and experimental groups

Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250–300 g were
purchased from Jiangsu University Laboratory Animals Center,
Zhenjiang, China, and kept under standard housing conditions
at a temperature between 20 1C and 23 1C, with a 12 h light–
dark cycle and a relative humidity of 50%. All animal tests and
experimental procedures were approved by the Administration Committee of Experimental Animals in Jiangsu Province
and the Ethics Committee of Jiangsu University. The design for
part 3 is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.

4.5.1.1. Experiment I: Evaluation of infarct volume. A total of
60 male SD rats, weighing 250–300 g, were randomly assigned to
ﬁve groups (n¼ 12): sham group, MCAO group, GA (50 mg/kg)
group, GA (25 mg/kg) group, and CsA (10 mg/kg) group. The GA
and CsA-treated group was administered GA (25 and 50 mg/kg,

4.5.1.2. Experiment II: Anti-apoptotic effect of GA in MCAO
rats. The grouping and administration methods of the drugs
were identical to Experiment I. 70 male Sprague-Dawley rats,
weight 250–300 g, were randomly assigned to ﬁve groups
(n¼ 14). After model assessment (Dirnagl, 2010), 40 male
Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the experiment (n ¼8).
Four rats in each group were used for TUNEL assay, and the
remaining four rats in each group were used to determine the
expression of Cyt C.

4.5.2.

Induction of focal cerebral ischemia

Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by MCAO according to
the method of Longa et al. (1989). To block the origin of the
middle cerebral artery, the nylon suture (diameter of approximately 0.26 mm) was introduced through the external carotid
artery into the internal carotid artery and advanced approximately 18–20 mm intracranially from the common carotid
artery bifurcation. After 2 h of MCAO, the suture was removed
to restore blood ﬂow. The rats in the sham operation group
underwent vessel exposure without MCAO. Body temperature
was regulated at 37.070.5 1C with a heating pad and lamp
when necessary.
The following exclusion criteria were applied during the
experiment (Dirnagl, 2010):
– Mortality of animals.
– No stroke (The rat with neurological deﬁcits score of 0
point will be excluded).
The method of neurological deﬁcits evaluation is according to Longa et al. (1989). Score 0: No apparent neurological
deﬁcits; Score 1: Contralateral forelimb ﬂexion; Score 2:
Decreased resistance to lateral push; Score 3: Spontaneous
movement in all directions and contralateral circling when
pulled by tail; Score 4: did not walk spontaneously and had
depressed levels of consciousness.
– Problems during induction of MCAO (excessive bleeding,
prolonged operation time Z15 min, thread placement).

4.5.3.

Assessment of cerebral infarct volume

To analyze the cerebral infarction, TTC staining was carried
out using methods previously published by Leker et al. (2003).
The sections were stained with 2% TTC (Sigma Aldrich,
Beijing, China) in saline for 30 min at 37 1C and photographed.
Then photographs of the ﬁve sections were analyzed for
infarct volume by a blinded observer using image analysis
software (Image-Pro Plus 6.0). Brain Infarct volumes were
calculated according to the following formula: (contralateral
volume undamaged ipsilateral)/contralateral volume (%).

Histopathological analysis

Rat brains were removed, ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde in
phosphate-buffered saline for 72 h at room temperature,
dehydrated through a graded ethanol series, and embedded
in parafﬁn. Sections that were 4–5 μm thick were cut in the
coronal plane and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H &
E) staining, which was performed as previously described
(Fischer et al., 2008).

TUNEL staining was measured with the respective commercial kits (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China). In brief,
the sections were treated with protease K (20 mg/ml) for
15 min at room temperature. Reaction buffer containing
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was directly applied
to tissue sections and incubated for 1 h at 37 1C. After being
washed with PBS, sections were incubated with 40 ,
6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Molecular Probes, Beijing,
China) for 10 min at room temperature to detect nuclei. Data
are expressed as the ratio of TUNEL-positive cells to
total cells.

4.5.6. Sample preparation and Western blot analysis
for Cytochrome C (Cyt C)
The protocol of isolating brain samples from the penumbra
has been published previously by Kramer et al. (2010). Tissues
homogenate was prepared to isolation of mitochondria and
cytosolic protein by a Mitochondria Isolation Kit according to
the manufacturer's guidelines (Beyotime, Haimen, Jiangsu,
China). Thirty-microgram protein samples were sizefractionated by 8% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a
monoclonal rabbit anti-Cyt C antibody (1:1000, Cell Signal
Technology, Shanghai, China). β-Actin detected by mouse
anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (1:2000, Cell Signal Technology, Shanghai, China), and COX IV detected by mouse
anti-COX IV monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Cell Signal Technology, Shanghai, China) served as control for the amount of
protein loaded.

Statistical analysis

Except neurological deﬁcit scores, all values are expressed as
the mean7S.D., and the statistical signiﬁcance of difference
between groups was determined by a two-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) test. Neurological deﬁcit scores were
expressed as the median, and the statistical signiﬁcance of
difference between groups was determined by a nonparametric Mann–Whitney test. A P-valueo0.05 was considered to indicate statistical signiﬁcance.
