Abstract
Objective
Intra-arterial stem cell transplantation exerts neuroprotective effects for ischemic stroke.
However, the optimal therapeutic time window and mechanisms have not been completely
understood. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the timing of intra-arterial transplantation of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in ischemic stroke model
in rats and its efficacy in acute phase.

Methods
Adult male Wistar rats weighing 200 to 250g received right middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) for 90 minutes. MSCs (1×106cells/ 1ml PBS) were intra-arterially injected at either
1, 6, 24, or 48 hours (1, 6, 24, 48h group) after MCAO. PBS (1ml) was intra-arterially
injected to control rats at 1 hour after MCAO. Behavioral test was performed immediately
after reperfusion, and at 3, 7 days after MCAO using the Modified Neurological Severity
Score (mNSS). Rats were euthanized at 7 days after MCAO for evaluation of infarct
volumes and the migration of MSCs. In order to explore potential mechanisms of action, the
upregulation of neurotrophic factor and chemotactic cytokine (bFGF, SDF-1α) induced by
cell transplantation was examined in another cohort of rats that received intra-arterial

transplantation at 24 hours after recanalization then euthanized at 7 days after MCAO for
protein assays.

Results
Behavioral test at 3 and 7 days after transplantation revealed that stroke rats in 24h group
displayed the most robust significant improvements in mNSS compared to stroke rats in all
other groups (p’s<0.05). Similarly, the infarct volumes of stroke rats in 24h group were
much significantly decreased compared to those in all other groups (p’s<0.05). These
observed behavioral and histological effects were accompanied by MSC survival and
migration, with the highest number of integrated MSCs detected in the 24h group. Moreover, bFGF and SDF-1α levels of the infarcted cortex were highly elevated in the 24h group
compared to control group (p’s<0.05).

Conclusions
These results suggest that intra-arterial allogeneic transplantation of MSCs provides poststroke functional recovery and reduction of infarct volumes in ischemic stroke model of rats.
The upregulation of bFGF and SDF-1α likely played a key mechanistic role in enabling
MSC to afford functional effects in stroke. MSC transplantation at 24 hours after recanalization appears to be the optimal timing for ischemic stroke model, which should guide the
design of clinical trials of cell transplantation for stroke patients.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, with only a few therapeutic
options. Stem cell transplantation has emerged as a new approach of treatment for ischemic
stroke [1–5]. To date, intracerebral, intravenous and intra-arterial routes of transplantation of
stem cells are effective for ischemic stroke [3, 5–23]. The advantage of intracerebral transplantation is the targeted deposition of stem cells into the lesioned brain, compared to intra-arterial
or intravenous transplantation resulting in majority of the cells being lodged in peripheral
organs [9, 24]. However, intravascular (intra-arterial or intravenous) transplantation is less
invasive than intracerebral transplantation, allowing grafting of cells without creating new
injury of brain tissue, thus means less trauma to the stroke patient. Furthermore, while not
locally deposited into the discrete ischemic regions, such peripheral route might guide stem
cells to wider distribution into the stroke brain (albeit throughout the penumbra region). Thus,
intravascular transplantation is considered as relatively simple, safe, and effective method of
delivering stem cells to stroke brain [9]. To this end, intra-arterial transplantation may resolve
the main problem of intravenous transplantation, with which transplanted cells must pass
through the systemic and pulmonary circulation systems, ultimately many of the grafted cells
being lodged into the peripheral organs and few cells reaching the injured brain [1, 9]. Recent
studies indicate that intra-arterial stem cell transplantation for ischemic stroke could induce
functional recovery in ischemic stroke animals [3, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26], with a clinical phase I/II trial demonstrating its safety and feasibility in stroke patients [4].
Neuroprotective effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation have been demonstrated in animal models of stroke [1–3, 6, 8, 12, 14, 15, 19, 20, 23, 26–29]. MSCs can differentiate into endothelial cells or neuronal cells [2, 27], although controversial. Alternatively, the

benefits of MSC transplantation has been ascribed to the secretion of neurotrophic factors or
chemotactic cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), nerve growth factor
(NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and
stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) from transplanted MSCs [1, 2, 22, 27, 29]. In addition
to the secretory function, migration of MSCs into the infarct lesion and reduction of the infarct
volumes after transplantation may mediate the neuroprotective effects [1–3, 12, 27]. However,
it remains unclear how the timing of intra-arterial MSC transplantation to ischemic stroke
affects the functional recovery.
In this study, we examined the acute therapeutic window of intra-arterial allogeneic MSC
transplantation in ischemic stroke model in adult rats. Furthermore, we investigated whether
the optimal timing of transplantation was associated with the postulated neuroprotective
mechanisms of stem cell therapy by focusing on the secretory function of MSCs.

Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine. The protocol was
specifically approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine (protocol #OKU- 2014282). Adult male Wistar rats were
used in this study. For euthanasia, pentobarbital was used. MCAO was carried out under general anesthesia (1% halothane in 69% N2O and 30% O2). All efforts were made to minimize
suffering.

Animals
Adult male Wistar rats (CLEA JAPAN, Inc., Tokyo, Japan; n = 82) weighing 200 to 250g at the
beginning of the experiment were used in this study, according to approved guidelines of the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Okayama University. They were singly
housed per cage in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room, maintained on a 12-hour
light/dark cycle, with free access to food and water.

Culture of MSCs
Rats were euthanized by sodium pentobarbital (200mg/kg) with subsequent removal of the
femoral bones (n = 12). After the femoral bone marrow was flushed, cells were cultured at
2×104 cells/cm2 in DMEM (Gibco, Cergy Pontoise, France) supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (Gibco) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). Cells were cultured at 37°C in a
fully humidified atmosphere with 10% CO2 for 2 weeks. The medium was changed twice a
week. The MSCs were isolated on the basis of their ability to adhere to the culture plates [18,
22]. After second passage, MSCs were used for transplantation.

Transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
MCAO was carried out according to the intraluminal suture method (n = 62) [3, 12, 20].
Under general anesthesia (1% halothane in 69% N2O and 30% O2), the right common carotid
artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) were exposed.
Subsequently, the ECA was cut with a microscissor and a 4–0 monofilament nylon suture with
silicone-coated tip (Xantopren L blue & ACTIVATOR Universal Liquid, Heraeus Kulzer
GmbH & Co. KG, Hanau, Germany) was inserted through an arteriotomy of the right ECA

into the right MCA. After MCAO for 90 minutes, the filament was withdrawn and ECA was
ligated with 3–0 silk suture.

Cell Labeling and Intra-arterial MSC Transplantation
Before cell transplantation, MSCs were labeled with Q-Tracker 625 Cell Labeling kit (Q-dot
nanocrystal, a red fluorescent marker; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for characterization of MSCs
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Once MSCs were cultured using Q-Tracker 625 Cell
Labeling kit, Q-dot nanocrystals were delivered into the cytoplasm of MSCs. We evaluated cell
labeling rate at 2 hours after cell labeling using counterstaining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in vitro. Thereafter, cells were detached with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA, and one million cells were diluted with 1ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The procedures of intraarterial transplantation in rats (n = 45) were as follows. Under general anesthesia (1% halothane in 69% N2O and 30% O2), proximal part of the right CCA was ligated by 5–0 silk suture
and distal part of the right ICA was clamped by temporary clip. Subsequently, a 23G winged
needle (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted upward through an arteriotomy in the ICA. Then,
ICA was declamped and cells were injected very slowly (1ml/ 2min) into ICA through the needle. After transplantation, the distal part of the ICA was ligated by 5–0 silk suture for hemostasis due to block the blood flow of ICA including an arteriotomy. Rats were divided into 4
groups by manipulating the timing of cell transplantation, in that transplantation was initiated
at either 1, 6, 24, or 48 hours after recanalization. Rats in control group received 1ml PBS into
the right ICA at 1 hour after recanalization as shown in Fig 1A.

Behavioral Test
Behavioral test was performed immediately after reperfusion, and at 3 and 7 days after MCAO
using the Modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS) (n = 62). The mNSS was used to assess
motor function, sensory disturbance, reflex, and balance. In this score, one score point is
awarded for the inability to perform the test or for the lack of reflex. Therefore, the higher
score indicates more severe injury. Neurological function was graded on a scale of 0 to 18 (normal score: 0; maximal deficit score: 18) [19, 27, 28]. Rats showed 8–12 points in the mNSS
immediately after reperfusion were used in this study.

Histological analyses
Measurement of the infarct volumes. Rats were euthanized under deep anesthesia using
pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) with following saline perfusion and brains were quickly removed at
7 days after MCAO for 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Thereafter, two
serial coronal sections of 2-mm thickness (at 0 and 2 mm anterior to the bregma) were prepared. Brain slices were incubated in a 0.2% solution of TTC (Kanto Chemistry Co., Tokyo,
Japan) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 37°C for 30 min and fixed by immersion in 4%
buffered formaldehyde solution. The normal area of brain was stained dark red based on intact
mitochondrial function, whereas infarct area remained unstained. Infarct area was measured
using a computerized image analysis using Image J software. We evaluated infarct area ratio by
the following method. Infarct area ratio = LT—(RT—RI) / LT %, where LT is the area of the
left hemisphere in mm2, RT is the area of the right hemisphere in mm2 and RI is the infarct
area in mm2. We evaluated the mean infarct area ratio of 2 sections (n = 29) [11, 30, 31].
Detection of integrated MSCs in vivo. At 7 days after MCAO, rats were euthanized and
brains were removed. Coronal sections were cut at 30μm-thickness with a freezing microtome
(-20°C) at the level of -2, 0, 2 mm anterior to the bregma. Three sections were counterstained
with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and then were visualized with fluorescence

microscopy (Keyence, Osaka, Japan) to detect MSCs labeled by Q-dot. We counted total number of nuclei of labeled MSCs in three sections, and calculated the mean number of nuclei of 3
sections. Then, we compared the mean number of nuclei of MSCs in each transplanted groups
(n = 32).

ELISA analyses
For protein assay, fresh brains from rats of control and 24h groups were quickly removed after
decapitation using anesthesia with an overdose of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p.) at 7 days after
MCAO. Brains were sliced at the thickness of 2 mm. The brain tissues of bilateral penumbra

area of the cortex and bilateral striatum were punched out using a biopsy punch tool (3 mmhole, Kai corporation and Kai industries co., ltd, Tokyo, Japan). Brain tissues were then homogenized in T-PER (Pierce, Rockfold, IL, USA) and centrifuged at 10,000G for 10 minutes at 4°C,
and the supernatant was obtained. The bFGF and SDF-1α levels of tissues were measured by
the usage of rat bFGF ELISA assay kit and mouse SDF-1α ELISA assay kit (R&D Systems,
USA) (n = 8) as shown in Fig 1B.

Statistical Analyses
Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. The data of the mNSS were statistically evaluated using
repeated measures ANOVA followed by post hoc Fisher’s test. The data of histology, and
ELISA were evaluated using one-factor ANOVA, followed by post hoc Fisher’s test. Statistical
significance was preset at p value< 0.05.

Results
Detection of labeled MSCs in vitro
After cell labeling, MSCs were visualized with fluorescent microscope on the culture plate.

intra-arterial MSCs at 24h and 48h transplantation groups was better than that of control group. Rats in 24h group showed significant recovery, compared to
all other groups at 3 and 7 days after MCAO (* p value<0.05 vs. control; ** p value<0.05 vs. all other groups, n = 17 in control group, 10 in 1h group, 11 in 6h

significant improvements in neurological function compared to all other groups at 3 and
7 days after MCAO.

Reduction of infarct volumes after intra-arterial MSC transplantation
ANOVA revealed significant treatment effects in infarct volume outcomes (one-factor
ANOVA; F (4, 24) = 3.16, p = 0.03). Posthoc analyses revealed that the infarct area ratio of stroke
rats in 24h group significantly decreased compared to stroke rats in control, 1h, and 6h groups
at 7 days after MCAO (control group: 22.1±3.3; 1h group: 20.9±5.1; 6h group: 20.9±3.4; 24h
group: 4.6±1.5; 48h group: 9.9±7.0%, at 7 days after MCAO respectively, p’s<0.05, Fig 4C and
S2 Data). There was no significant difference of infarct area ratio between rats in 24h and 48h
groups (p = 0.41). The infarct area ratio of rats in 48h group showed a trend of reduction in
infarct volume compared to control group, 1h group, and 6h group, but there was no statistical
differences detected (p = 0.068 vs. control; p = 0.11 vs. 1h; p = 0.099 vs. 6h group; p’s >0.05).

Correlation between neurological function and infarct volumes
There was significant correlation between neurological function at 3 and 7 days after MCAO
and infarct volumes (3 days after MCAO: Y = 5.283+0.091 X, R^2 = 0.287, correlation efficiency: 0.536, p = 0.0015; 7 days after MCAO: Y = 2.302+0.143 X, R^2 = 0.449, correlation efficiency: 0.670, p = 0.0012, Fig 5).

Migration of integrated MSCs in vivo
ANOVA revealed treatment effects on MSC migration (one-factor ANOVA; F (3, 28) = 4,251,
p = 0.0135). MSCs were detected in the brain of all transplanted groups at 7 days after MCAO
(Fig 6A and 6B). MSCs mainly migrated into the ischemic penumbra. Posthoc analyses
revealed that the number of integrated MSCs was significantly higher in stroke rats of 24h
group than that of all other groups. (1h group: 170.3±29.7; 6h group: 203.0±29.8; 24h group:
332.9±34.9; 48h group: 212.5±45.5 cells/slice, at 7 days after MCAO respectively, p’s<0.05,
Fig 6C and S3 Data).

Protein assay for neurotrophic factor and chemotactic cytokine
ANOVA revealed significant treatment effects on bFGF cortical expression (one-factor
ANOVA; F (3, 32) = 2.628, p = 0.0361). Posthoc analyses revealed that the bFGF level of the
infarcted cortex of stroke rats in 24h group significantly increased compared to the infarcted
cortex of rats in control group and the contralateral intact cortex of stroke rats in 24h group
and control group at 7 days after MCAO (24h group: infarcted cortex 262.2±37.3, intact cortex
176.3±25.6; control group: infarcted cortex 190.3±9.6, intact cortex 193.3±15.0 pg/ml, respectively, p’s<0.05, Fig 7A and S4 Data). In contrast, ANOVA revealed no significant treatment
effects on bFGF striatal expression (one-factor ANOVA; F (3, 24) = 0.395, p = 0.7575) indicating
that the bFGF level of the infarcted striatum of stroke rats in 24h group did not increase compared to that of control group and the intact striatum of rats in both groups (Fig 7B and S4
Data).
ANOVA revealed significant treatment effects on SDF-1α cortical expression (one-factor
ANOVA; F (3, 26) = 3.658, p = 0.0253). Posthoc analyses revealed that the SDF-1α level of the
infarcted cortex of stroke rats in 24h group significantly increased compared to the infarcted
cortex of rats in control group and the contralateral intact cortex of stroke rats in 24h group
and control group at 7 days after MCAO (24h group: infarcted cortex 0.29±0.052, intact cortex
0.18±0.002; control group: infarcted cortex 0.18±0.004, intact cortex 0.19±0.004 ng/ml, respectively, p value<0.05, Fig 7C and S5 Data). On the other hand, ANOVA revealed no significant
treatment effects on SDF-1α striatal expression (one-factor ANOVA; F (3, 22) = 1.609,
p = 0.216), indicating that the SDF-1α level of the infarcted striatum did not increase compared
to that of control group (Fig 7D and S5 Data).

Discussion
The present study demonstrated that intra-arterial allogeneic MSC transplantation in ischemic
stroke model of rats induced functional recovery with transplantation at 24 hours after MCAO
being most effective. The robust behavioral recovery exhibited by stroke rats in the 24h transplanted group was paralleled by reduced infarct volumes and a high number of integrated
MSCs successfully migrating towards the ischemic cortex and coinciding with elevated levels of
bFGF and SDF-1α in the infarcted cortex.

Functional effects of intra-arterial MSC transplantation
To date, the efficacy of intravenous MSC transplantation has been well-documented in animal
models of ischemic stroke [9, 12, 14, 15, 23, 27, 28]. The neuroprotective effects of intravenous
transplantation have been mainly ascribed to secretion of neurotrophic factors but not migration of cells [3, 7, 32]. Recently, intra-arterial MSC transplantation in animal models of ischemic stroke has been similarly shown to induce functional recovery [3, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, 19, 20,
21]. Interestingly, the migration of intra-arterially delivered cells to the stroke brain has been
implicated as a pivotal factor in the observed therapeutic effects. Comparing intra-arterial and
intravenous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) transplantation following ischemic

stroke in rats, results revealed that intra-arterial transplantation resulted in less infarct volumes, better functional recovery, and higher number of BMMCs surviving in the stroke brain
than intravenous transplantation [12]. Similarly, a much higher number of human MSCs
migrated into the infarct lesion with intra-arterial transplantation than that with intravenous
transplantation, further lending support to the notion that the migration of cells to the injured
brain contributes to the functional recovery [3]. In the present study, we showed that many
integrated MSCs migrated to the infarct lesion, especially in the 24h transplanted group that
coincided with functional recovery in stroke rats. Along this line of investigations, intracerebral
transplantation could result in higher number of cells deposited into the ischemic brain than
intravenous and intra-arterial transplantation [2, 9]. However, intracerebral transplantation is
most invasive transplantation method, and there are some risks of hemorrhage or injury of tissue due to transplantation. On the other hand, intravascular transplantation offers a minimally

peripherally transplanted cells get trapped in peripheral organs, including the liver, spleen, and
lungs [1, 2, 9, 33], indicating that intravenous transplantation does not ensure satisfactory
migration of cells into the stroke brain. In this regard, intra-arterial transplantation while also a
relatively less invasive intravascular transplantation method, can promote the deposition of a
large number of peripherally delivered cells directly into the lesion site. Nevertheless, intraarterial transplantation carries the risks of cerebral embolism and reduction of cerebral blood
flow associated with microstrokes [33]. Similar to intracerebral stereotaxic guided surgical procedure, intra-arterial transplantation may require a certain level of skill to safely and effectively
perform the procedure. Despite these limitations, additional studies are warranted to optimize
intra-arterial transplantation as a promising transplantation method from the viewpoint of aiding in the successful migration of peripherally integrated cells into the stroke brain.

Therapeutic window of intra-arterial MSC transplantation
Because the primary cerebral infarct triggers multiple secondary cell death processes in the
stroke brain over time, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction,
the timing of cell transplantation should be carefully considered [3, 9]. Intra-arterial MSC
transplantation at 1 and 4 days after MCAO in rats at led to neuroprotective effects, but transplantation at 7 days after MCAO was less effective [3]. The efficacy of this early transplantation
was thought to involve cell migration, reactive astrocyte enhancement, angiogenesis, and
reduced inflammatory response. In our study, we further characterized the acute therapeutic
time window of intra-arterial transplantation in stroke, and showed that transplantation at 24
hours after MCAO significantly improved neurological function and reduced infarct volume.
The highest number of MSCs that migrated to the ischemic brain was also detected in the brain
of stroke rats in 24h transplanted group. On the other hand, the number of integrated MSCs
was relatively low in 1h and 6h groups, resulting in observable no reduction of infarct volumes.
That the supra-acute timing post-stroke was not amenable to MSC migration into the stroke
brain suggests that blood-brain-barrier (BBB) may still be intact immediately after cerebral
infarct and may be prohibitive to the entry of peripherally delivered MSCs. Indeed, the BBB
has been implicated as one of the major limiting factors obstructing MSCs from reaching
injured regions of the brain [18, 34]. MSCs delivered by intra-arterial injection need to pass
through the BBB before they can successfully migrate and survive into an injured site [18, 35].
Previous studies reported that the approximate time estimate of BBB disruption from onset of
ischemia was around 3.8 hours [36, 37]. In view of this observation, the initiation of intra-arterial MSC transplantation after BBB disruption has progressed may be advantageous if the
desired goal is to facilitate the engraftment of MSCs towards functional recovery in stroke.

Neurotrophic factors secreted by transplanted MSCs and their
neuroprotective effects
Several neurotrophic factors have been demonstrated to contribute to the therapeutic outcomes
of stem cell therapy in experimental stroke. bFGF is one of the most potent neurotrophic factors for the protection of neurons [1, 2, 27, 29, 38]. We previously demonstrated that grafting
of encapsulated bFGF-secreting cells protected against ischemic injury after MCAO in rats by
directly exerting cytoprotection through suppression of apoptosis in tandem with enhanced
angiogenesis at the border of ischemic infarct [38]. Functional recovery after intravenous MSC
transplantation in ischemic stroke rats also details the secretion of bFGF from MSCs, which
reduces apoptosis and promotes proliferation of endogenous stem and progenitor cells within
the peri-infarcted tissue [27, 29]. Intravenous MSC transplantation was reported to promote
the production of endogenous bFGF in ischemic stroke model in rats [29]. On the other hand,

MSC Transplantation for Ischemic Stroke Model in Rats

intravenously transplanted MSCs might be able to secret bFGF in the brain and provide functional recovery [27, 29]. In the present study, bFGF increased in the infarcted cortex of rats in
24h transplanted group, which showed the most robust migration of cells, suggesting that
MSCs that migrated to the injured brain secreted bFGF, and in turn reduced lesion volume and
contributed to functional recovery. Additionally, SDF-1α also significantly increased in the
infarcted cortex of rats in 24h transplanted group. SDF-1α is one of the chemotactic cytokines
and the unique ligand for a CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR4) [22, 39]. In addition, SDF-1α
may exert neuroprotective effects, in that rats that received intracerebral administration of
SDF-1α displayed functional recovery coupled with reduced infarct volumes through upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins [40]. The expression of SDF-1α increase in the ischemic penumbra due to stroke-induced activation of astrocytes and locally produced SDF-1α induced the
migration of intravenously transplanted MSCs into the ischemic hemisphere in ischemic stroke
model in rats [40, 41]. On the other hand, several reports suggested that bone marrow stromal
cells might secrete SDF-1α [22, 39, 40]. We previously reported that MSCs secreted SDF-1α in
vitro and intravenous transplantation of MSCs engineered to secrete SDF-1α led to neuroprotective effects through anti-apoptotic mechanisms in a Parkinson’s disease model of rats [22].
For these reasons, we speculate that the combination of bFGF and SDF-1α likely secreted by
the intra-arterially transplanted MSCs, which successfully honed in the ischemic brain, might
have contributed to the observed therapeutic outcomes. However, there is a possibility that
intra-arterially transplanted MSCs promoted the production of endogenous bFGF and
SDF-1α.

Clinical application of intra-arterial MSC transplantation for ischemic
stroke
Clinical studies have been initiated to evaluate stem cell therapy in patients with ischemic
stroke. Transplantation of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) for ischemic stroke has
been initiated [4, 42–44]. Preliminary results [4, 42, 43] have shown that intra-arterial transplantation of autologous BMMCs in ischemic stroke patients at subacute phase was safe and
feasible without adverse events, death, and stroke due to procedure in follow up time. In one
study [43], patients with moderate to severe ischemic stroke were treated within 3 to 7 days,
with no observable complications, and 40% of patients showed good clinical outcome at
chronic phase. However, the optimal time window is unclear. Because the condition of patients
with ischemic stroke remarkably changes over time, determining the therapeutic window is
important for improving stroke treatments. Autologous transplantation in acute phase may be
indicated, but in clinical settings the time-consuming expansion of autologous MSCs presents
as a challenge, although the safety of intra-arterial cell transplantation has been reported [4, 42,
43]. Alternatively, autologous MSC stem cell banking (e.g., from umbilical cord or placenta)
and allogeneic cell transplantation may be options for intra-arterial transplantation in patients
with ischemic stroke in acute phase. Clearly, more basic and clinical studies are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of intra-arterial transplantation of MSCs within the acute time window of stroke.

Conclusions
This study demonstrates that intra-arterial allogeneic MSC transplantation in rats exposed to
transient ischemic stroke model improves neurological function and reduces infarct volumes,
likely due to robust migration of peripherally delivered cells into the ischemic brain resulting
in upregulated CNS levels of bFGF and SDF-1α. Intra-arterial transplantation at 24 hours after
MCAO may be optimal timing for stroke.
