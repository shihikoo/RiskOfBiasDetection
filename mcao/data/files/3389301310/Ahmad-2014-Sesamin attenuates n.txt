Stroke is a severe neurological disorder characterized by the abrupt loss of blood circulation into the
brain resulting into wide ranging brain and behavior abnormalities. The present study was designed to
evaluate molecular mechanism by which sesamin (SES) induces neuroprotection in mouse model of
ischemic stroke. The results of this study demonstrate that SES treatment (30 mg/kg bwt) signiﬁcantly
reduced infarction volume, lipid per-oxidation, cleaved-caspase-3 activation, and increased GSH activity
following MCAO in adult male mouse. SES treatment also diminished iNOS and COX-2 protein
expression, and signiﬁcantly restored SOD activity and protein expression level in the ischemic cortex of
the MCAO animals. Furthermore, SES treatment also signiﬁcantly reduced inﬂammatory and oxidative
stress markers including Iba1, Nox-2, Cox-2, peroxynitrite compared to placebo MCAO animals.
Superoxide radical production, as studied by DHE staining method, was also signiﬁcantly reduced in the
ischemic cortex of SES treated compared to placebo MCAO animals. Likewise, downstream effects of
superoxide free radicals i.e. MAPK/ERK and P38 activation was also signiﬁcantly attenuated in SES
treated compared to placebo MCAO animals. In conclusion, these results suggest that SES induces
signiﬁcant neuroprotection, by ameliorating many signaling pathways activated/deactivated following
cerebral ischemia in adult mouse.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide
with a high incidence of permanent disability in surviving
individuals (Liu et al., 2014). Ischemic stroke is caused by
reduction or complete blockade of cerebral blood ﬂow owing to

thrombi or embolic which reduces oxygen and energy supply to
the critical tissues of the brain, resulting in rapid cell death and a
corresponding loss of neurologic function (Pradeep et al., 2012).
Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion insult produces damage of brain
tissues via complex rapid pathophysiological mechanisms including
glutamate excitotoxicity, inﬂammation as a result of the blood–
brain barrier disruption, oxidative damage, loss of ionic homeostasis,
phospholipase activation (Nito et al., 2008), neuronal depolarization
(Sun et al., 2013) and ﬁnally apoptosis (Diaz-Ruiz et al., 2014).
Because of the devastating consequences and disabilities
associated with stroke survivors that cause a signiﬁcant social
and economic burden on societies worldwide, ischemic stroke is

S. Ahmad et al. / NeuroToxicology 45 (2014) 100–110

nowadays a major public health concern (Yuen et al., 2011).
Despite current advances in thrombolytic therapy for acute
ischemic stroke, its clinical application is limited because of
possible association with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage
and poor functional outcomes (Whiteley et al., 2014), therefore
there is a great need for designing new therapeutic strategies,
which can provide neuroprotection in stroke.
Recently, attention has been focused on natural products as
natural sources to develop safe and potent agents for enhancing
the survival of neurons and preventing ischemia-induced neuronal
death (Lim et al., 2013). Sesamin (SES) is one of the most abundant
ligand in sesame seeds (Phitak et al., 2012). It has been shown to
exhibit multiple biological functions, such as inhibition of
inﬂammation (Lin et al., 2014), carcinogenesis (Deng et al.,
2013) and oxidative stress (Hsieh et al., 2011). In addition,
sesamin has been reported to attenuate hypertension (Matsumura
et al., 1995), serum and hepatic cholesterol (Hirata et al., 1996),
serum triglycerides (Fukuda et al., 1998), cerebral thrombogenesis
(Noguchi et al., 2004), and neuroinﬂammation (Bournival et al.,
2012b). Further, sesamin also exhibited neuroprotective effects in
various models of neuronal cell injuries caused by ischemia or
oxidative stress (Hou et al., 2003, 2004; Zhang et al., 2012a). Earlier
we demonstrated neuroprotective effect of sesamin in ischemiareperfusion injury induced in rats by reversible middle cerebral
artery occlusion (Khan et al., 2010) however a detailed mechanism
has not been presented. In the present study, we have elucidated
detail mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of
sesamin, which will help in understanding potential pathogenic
pathways and therapeutic mechanisms of SES in ischemia-induced
brain injury.
2. Methods
2.1. Animals and experimental design
Male mice in C57BL/6 (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME)
background were used in all experiments. The mice were kept
under standard environmental and nutritional conditions throughout the investigation. Animals had free access to standard rodent
pellet diet and water ad libitum. 12 h before the surgical procedure
food was withdrawn. This study was performed in accordance with
the Public Health Service Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, National
Institutes of Health), Georgia Regents University, and King
Abdulaziz university guidelines. Sesamin dose was already
established in our earlier study (Khan et al., 2010). Mice were
randomly distributed into 3 major groups (15 mice each group) as
follows: Group I: Sham operated mice and vehicle was given as i.p.,
Group II: Ischemic mice were middle cerebral artery occluded
(MCAO), i.e., ischemia was induced for 2 h followed by reperfusion
for 22 h, Group III: Ischemic mice treated with sesamin (SES,
30 mg/kg bwt in 0.1% DMSO, i.p.) 30 min before the onset of
ischemia and 12 h after reperfusion (MCAO+ SES).
2.2. Surgical procedure and collection of sample
Middle cerebral artery occlusion, (MCAO) was performed
according to the method described previously by (Ahmad et al.,
2006). In brief, Mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate
(400 mg/kg bwt, i.p.); silicone rubber (4 0-3033REPK10, DOCEOL,
USA) coated monoﬁlament has a smooth, soft, and ﬂexible tip was
introduced into the external carotid artery (ECA) and advanced
into the middle cerebral artery via the internal carotid artery (ICA)
(17–20 mm) until a slight resistance was felt. Such resistance
indicated that the ﬁlament had passed beyond the proximal
segment of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA). At this point, the

101

intraluminal suture blocks the origin of MCA and occluded all
sources of blood ﬂow from ICA, anterior cerebral artery and the
posterior cerebral artery. Two hours after the induction of
ischemia, the ﬁlament was slowly withdrawn and the animals
were then returned to their cages.
After the completion of the reperfusion period, the animals
were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg bwt, i.p.) and
perfused transcardially through ascending aorta, with in cold
phosphate buffer saline (PBS; 0.1 M, pH 7.2). The brains were
collected for biochemical estimations. For histological study we
perfused the mice with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1 X PBS and brains
were collected for the sectioning (Ahmad et al., 2012).
2.3. Preparation of brain homogenate
The brains were homogenized according to previously described method (Ahmad et al., 2006) to prepare 5% (w/v)
homogenate (10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 having 10 mL/mL
protease inhibitors: 5 mM leupeptin, 1.5 mM aprotinin, 2 mM
phenylethylsulfonylﬂuoride (PMSF), 3 mM peptastatin A, 10 mM
EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM benzamidine and 0.04% butylated
hydroxytoluene) and were centrifuged at 1000  g for 5 min at 4 8C
to separate debries. This supernatant was used for the assay of
TBARS. The rest of the supernatant was centrifuged at 10,500  g
for 15 min at 4 8C to separate post mitochondrial supernatant
(PMS), which was used for the estimation of GSH and superoxide
dismutase activity.
2.4. Estimation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)
TBARS activity assay was done according to method described
previously by us with slight modiﬁcation (Ahmad et al., 2012). The
homogenate 0.25 mL was incubated at 37  1 8C in a metabolic
shaker (120 strokes/min) for 1 h. Similarly, 0.25 mL of the same
homogenate was pipetted in a test tube and incubated at 0 8C. After
1 h of incubation, 0.5 mL of 5% chilled trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was
added followed by 0.25 mL of 0.67% thiobarbituric acid (TBA) in each
test tube and proper mixing was done after each addition. The
mixture was centrifuged at 3000  g for 10 min and supernatant was
transferred to another test tube and placed in boiling water bath for
10 min. The test tubes were put to cool and the absorbance of the
color was read at 535 nm. The rate was expressed as nmol TBARS
formed/h/mg protein using a molar extinction coefﬁcient of
1.56  105 M1 cm1.
2.5. Reduced glutathione (GSH) content measurement
GSH content was determined according to the previously
described method (Jollow et al., 1974) with slight modiﬁcation
(Ahmad et al., 2006). PMS was mixed with 4.0% sulfosalisylic acid
in a 1:1 ratio (v/v). The samples were incubated at 4 8C for1 h, and
later centrifuged at 1200  g for 15 min at 4 8C. The assay mixture
contained 0.1 mL of supernatant, 1.0 mM 5-50 -dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) and 0.1 M PB (pH 7.4) in a total volume of
1.0 mL. The yellow color developed was read immediately at
412 nm using a spectrophotometer (UV-1601, Shimadzu, Japan).
The GSH content was calculated as nmol of DTNB conjugate
formed/mg protein using a molar extinction coefﬁcient of
13.6  103 M1 cm1.
2.6. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity assay
SOD activity was measured according to the method described
previously (Stevens et al., 2000) by monitoring the auto oxidation
of ()-epinephrine at pH 10.4 for 3 min at 480 nm. The reaction
mixture contained glycine buffer (50 mM, pH, 10.4) and 0.2 mL of

102

S. Ahmad et al. / NeuroToxicology 45 (2014) 100–110

PMS. The reaction was initiated by the addition of ()-epinephrine.
The enzyme activity was calculated in terms of nmol ()epinephrine protected from oxidation/min/mg protein using molar
extinction coefﬁcient 4.02  103 M1 cm1.
2.7. Infarct volume estimation
Mice brain was sliced into ﬁve coronal sections of 2.0 mm
thickness (from olfactory bulb to the cerebellum) by using brain
matrix (Activational Systems, MI, USA), and stained in 1.5%
solution of TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride; Sigma, St.
Louise, MO) for 15–20 min at 37 8C. The stained coronal sections
from each group were rinsed twice with 10 mM phosphate
buffered saline (pH 7.4) before submerging in ethanol:dimethylsulfoxide (1:1, v/v) to give a 10% (w/v) soluble solution of formazan
for 24 h. Staining pictures were taken by digital camera (Nikon,
Japan). Infarct area was measured in blind manner using Image J
software (NIH). In brief, Infarction zones were measured and the
percentage infarct size was calculated and expressed as a
percentage of the contralateral side  SEM (Liu et al., 2009). Infarct
size calculation with edema correction was performed using the
following formula: 100 (volume of ipsilateralhemisphere  volume
of contralateral hemisphere)/volume of contralateral hemisphere.
2.8. Histopathological studies
Immunohistochemical study was performed according to
previous method (Ahmad et al., 2013). Perfused mice brains were
removed quickly and then transferred into 30% sucrose in 0.1 M 1X
PBS for overnight or until they sank for cryoprotection for parafﬁn
or frozen section. The tissues were then stored at 4 8C in 70%
ethanol solution till sectioning. The brain was processed for frozen
(in O.C.T. compound) or parafﬁn embedding. Microtome or
cryostat was used to cut the brain sections (7–10 mm). Mouse
on Mouse (M.O.M.) kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was
used for immunohistochemistry analysis. In brief, slides were used
for antigen retrieval and then treated with 3% H2O2 followed by
blocking with protein blocker serum free (Dako, Japan). Thereafter
slides were reacted with primary antibodies (activated caspase-3,
Cell Signaling Technology, USA; Iba-1, Wako, Japan; Nox-2, Cox-2
and nitrotyrosine from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA). Sections were washed with 1  0.1% TBS-T, and reacted with
M.O.M. biotinylated anti-mouse Ig reagent (1:250), followed by
M.O.M. ABC reagent. Color was developed with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine (DAB) as substrate. Hematoxylin was used for nucleus
counter staining. Immunoﬂuorescence analysis was performed
using frozen brain sections. Brieﬂy, cryostat sections (10 mm)
were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked with Dako protein
block serum-free and then incubated overnight at 4 8C with
primary antibodies (NeuN, Abcam, USA; p-ERK1/2 and p-P38, Cell
Signaling Technology, USA. Thereafter, sections were brieﬂy
washed with 1  0.1% PBS-T or Triton X-100 and incubated with
appropriate secondary antibodies (Oregon Green, Biorad, USA).
DAPI (Vector Lab, CA) or NeuN was used for nucleus staining.
Slides were examined by ﬂuorescent microscope. Speciﬁcity of
the reaction was conﬁrmed by omitting the primary antibody, or
by using non-immune IgG.
2.9. Quantitative real time-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from ischemic brain tissue using SV
Total RNA Isolation kit (Promega, Madison,WI) following manufacturer’s instructions, and the quality of the RNA preparations was
monitored by absorbance at 260 and 280 nm (Helios-Gamma,
Thermo Spectronic, Rochester, NY). The extracted RNA was
reverse-transcribed into complementary deoxyribonucleic acid

(cDNA) using iScript reagents from Bio-Rad on a programmable
thermal cycler (PCR-Sprint, Thermo Electron, Milford, MA). 50 ng
of cDNA was ampliﬁed in each qRT-PCR using a Bio-Rad iCycler,
ABgene reagents (Fisher scientiﬁc) and appropriate primers
(Table 1). Average of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) and 18S ribosomal RNA was used as the internal control
for normalization.
2.10. Western blot analysis
Dissected brains were homogenized in modiﬁed RIPA buffer
(Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), containing 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, Supplemented
with 40 mM NaF, 2 mM Na3VO4, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
ﬂuoride and 1:100 (v/v) of proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma).
Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000  g at
4 8C for 30 min. Protein was determined by DC Protein Assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and 100 mg was boiled in Laemmli sample
buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE on a gradient gel (4–20%) (Pierce,
Rockford, IL), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with speciﬁc antibodies. Antibodies for iNOS, COX-2, CuZnSOD
and MnSOD (Santcruz Biotechnology Inc., CA, USA) were detected
with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham BioSciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). The same membrane was re-probed with
control antibodies, such as those for the actin. Intensity of
immunoreactivity was measured by densitometry analysis by
using Image J software (version 1.42; National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD).
2.11. DHE Staining in brain section
The production of superoxide as oxidative stress was measured
in frozen frontal cortex and hippocampus sections using the
oxidative ﬂuorescent dye dihydroethidium (DHE). DHE (2 mM)
(Sigma–Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada) was applied to 10 mm brain
sections and the slides were then incubated in a light protected
humidiﬁed chamber at 37 8C for 30 min. In the presence of
superoxide, DHE is oxidized to ﬂuorescent ethidium, which is
trapped by intercalation with DNA. Ethidiumis excited at 518 nm
with an emission spectrum of 605 nm. The intensity of the
ﬂuorescence was quantiﬁed by Image J software.
2.12. Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean  SEM and Prism GraphPad1
software was used for statistical analysis. Data were analyzed by
applying ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s Kramer post-test for all
parameters. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

3. Results
3.1. Effect of SES on TBARS level, GSH content, cleaved caspase-3,
antioxidant enzymes activity and protein levels as well as infarction
volume in ischemic brain
Oxidative stress is know to causes brain damage by increasing
reactive oxygen or nitrogen species (ROS or RNS) dependent lipid
peroxidation in a number of neurological disorders including
Parkinson’s disease and stroke (Andersen, 2004). In this study,
TBARS level in brain tissue was measured as an indication of lipid
peroxidation following MCAO and the results are shown in Fig. 1A–
D. A signiﬁcant (p < 0.001) increase in TBARS level was observed in
MCAO animals compared to the sham group (Fig. 1A). Ischemic
mice treated with SES exhibited signiﬁcant (p < 0.01) decrease in
TBARS level compared to ischemic untreated mice (Fig. 1A).
Further, we measured reduced glutathione (GSH), which acts as
potent antioxidant in cells defense mechanism, following MCAO.
The level of GSH was markedly (p < 0.001) reduced in MCAO group
as compared to sham group (Fig. 1B). SES treatment signiﬁcantly
(p < 0.01) increased the GSH level in ischemic mice as compared to
untreated ischemic mice (Fig. 1B). Since, free radicals activate
various proteins/enzymes involved in neuronal cell death such as

103

caspase-3, which is a known marker for apoptosis we therefore,
measured caspase-3 activation in the ischemic cortex of MCAO
animals using immunohistochemistry. As can be seen from the
Fig. 1C, that there was a signiﬁcant increase in caspase-3 activity in
the ischemic cortex following MCAO in the untreated animals,
which suggest increased neuronal cell death. SES treated MCAO
animals showed signiﬁcant (p < 0.01) reduction in the caspase-3
positive cells (Fig. 1C and D). These results indicate that SES
treatment may reduce neuronal cell death caused by apoptosis
following MCAO. Antioxidant enzymes such as SOD and catalase
play important role against free radical induced cell death
following cerebral ischemia. Fig. 1E and F shows that SOD level
following MCAO was markedly reduced in the ischemic brain
tissue as compared to sham group (p < 0.001). More speciﬁcally,
western blot analysis revealed that MCAO signiﬁcantly reduced
both CuZnSOD and MnSOD levels in mice brain tissue as compared
to sham group. Treatment with SES signiﬁcantly increased SOD
activity and CuZnSOD and MnSOD protein expression levels in
ischemic brain tissue compared with untreated ischemic mice.
Further, the reduction in SOD activity was correlated with the
infarct size as evaluated by TTC staining after 24 hours MCAO and
SES treatment signiﬁcantly reduced infarct size compared with
untreated MCAO animals (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1G and H).

SES on infarct size was evaluated by 1.5% TTC staining after MCAO for 2 h following by 22 h reperfusion. MCAO group produced signiﬁcant infarct area (white region) as
compared to contra lateral side (red region). SES treated group showed a signiﬁcant (40%) reduction in tissue damage (white area) as compared with MCAO. Values are
expressed as mean  SEM (n = 6). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of

3.2. SES treatment attenuated inﬂammation in ischemic brain tissue
We next analyzed ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1
(Iba-1), a useful protein for distinguishing microglia, using
immunohistochemistry. Additionally, mRNA levels of Iba-1, TNFa and IL-6 as markers of microglia activation, and inﬂammation in

brain tissues were also studied. MCAO animals showed marked
increase of activated microglia with morphological change into the
activated ameboid form as revealed by Iba-1 immunostaining
(Fig. 2A), and increased brain pro-inﬂammatory genes as revealed
by higher mRNA levels of Iba-1 (p < 0.01), TNF-a (p < 0.001) and
IL-6 (Fig. 2C and D respectively) in brain tissue as compared to

Fig. 2. Effect of sesamin (SES) on Iba1, TNF-a and IL-6 expression level in mouse model of ischemic brain stroke. SES treatment attenuated retinal microglial activation and
inﬂammation in brain tissue of MCAO mice as compared with MCAO. Effect of sesamin on (A) Iba1 expression in brain tissue sections of sham, MCAO and MCAO + SES mice
determined by Immunohistochemistry. (B) Iba-1 mRNA levels in brain tissue of sham, MCAO and MCAO + SES mice (C) TNF-a mRNA levels in brain tissue of sham, MCAO and
MCAO + SES mice. (D) IL-6 mRNA levels in brain tissue of sham, MCAO and MCAO + SES mice. GAPDH and 18S were used as reporter genes. mRNA levels were determined by RTPCR. The results represent the means  SEM of fold changes calculated using expression level, normalized to the level of the sham mice (n = 4–6). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.

S. Ahmad et al. / NeuroToxicology 45 (2014) 100–110

sham group (same ﬁgures). Treatment with SES signiﬁcantly
(p < 0.05) reduced mRNA levels of Iba-1, TNF-a, and IL-6 compared
to the untreated ischemic mince (Fig. 2A, B and D).
3.3. SES treatment mitigated Nox-2 expression levels and superoxide
anion in ischemic brain tissue
NAD(P)H oxidase subunit Nox-2 has been implicated in free
radicals generation in brain during ischemia reperfusion injury
(Brennan et al., 2009). We measured Nox-2 expression and DHE
oxidation in the ischemic cortex of untreated and treated MCAO
animals using immunohistochemistry and the result are presented
in Fig. 3A–E. As can be seen from Fig. 3 that there was a signiﬁcant
increase in Nox-2 protein and mRNA expression in the ischemic
region following MCAO. SES treatment signiﬁcantly reduced
ischemia-induced increase in Nox-2 expression level compared
to untreated ischemic mice (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3A–C). In addition,
MCAO group showed a signiﬁcant increase in DHE staining in
cortex (p < 0.001) sections compared to sham group and treatment
with SES reduced DHE staining compared to untreated ischemic
mice (Fig. 3D and E).
3.4. SES treatment reduced inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) protein and
m-RNA levels, and nitrotyrosine immunostaining in ischemic brain
tissue
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important intercellular messenger in
central nervous system. NO is synthesized by three forms of NO
synthase (iNOS, eNOS and nNOS). NO formed by iNOS expressed
due to inﬂammatory mediators and is implicated in neurodegeneration (Toda and Nakanishi-Toda, 2007). iNOS induction increases
the production of nitrotyrosine. MCAO signiﬁcantly elevated both
iNOS protein and mRNA levels in the ischemic cortex compared to
sham group (p < 0.01). SES treatment markedly reduced ischemiainduced elevation in iNOS protein and mRNA levels (p < 0.01 and

105

p < 0.05) as compared to untreated ischemic mice (Fig. 4A–C).
Moreover, immunostaining of nitrotyrosine, a stable product
formed from the reaction of peroxynitrite with tyrosine residues
and an index of nitrosative damage, was elevated in MCAO group
as compared with that in sham group. SES-treated ischemic mice
showed decreased nitrotyrosine staining as compared with
untreated ischemic mice (Fig. 4D).
3.5. SES treatment reduced COX-2 levels in ischemic brain tissue
Several studies have implicated COX-2 in the inﬂammatory
mechanism and cell death process (Minghetti, 2004). We
analyzed COX-2 expression in the ischemic brain using Western
Blot, RT-PCR and immunostaining and the results are presented
in Fig. 5A–E. The data revealed that MCAO signiﬁcantly elevated
COX-2 levels in the ischemic brain tissue as compared to sham
(p < 0.05, p < 0.001). Treatment with SES markedly reduced
COX-2 mRNA levels and number of COX-2 positive cells in
ischemic brain tissues as compared to untreated ischemic mice
(Fig. 5A–E).
3.6. SES treatment reduced p-ERK1/2 and p-P38 immunoﬂouroscence
staining in ischemic brain tissue
Free radicals activate a number of downstream signaling
molecules including MAPKinases (Ahmad et al., 2013). These
activated MAPKinases have been implicated in the neurdegenerative pathways. We investigated SES effect on the activation
of ERKs and p-38, which are the main candidates of MAPK family
of proteins. Immunoﬂouroscence studies showed signiﬁcant
increase in p-ERK1/2 and p-P38 levels following MCAO
compared to sham group (p < 0.01). Treatment with SES
signiﬁcantly reduced p-ERK1/2 p-P38 expression level ischemic

4. Discussion
The present investigation was prompted by our previous
encouraging results with SES and sesame oil, which show that
sesame oil and SES is able to mitigate neurological deﬁcits in
reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the rats
(Ahmad et al., 2006; Khan et al., 2010) In this study, we have
demonstrated that SES attenuated brain damage induced by MCAO
in mice by antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory and anti-apoptotic
mechanisms (Fig. 7).
Oxidative stress is a well-known factor that exacerbates brain
damage induced by cerebral ischemia (Wang and Cui, 2013). Brain
tissue is particularly susceptible to oxidative damage, due to high
rate of oxidative metabolic activity, intense production of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and high content of polyunsaturated fatty
acids. ROS are one of the most studied neurotoxic factors that can be
released by microglia under ischemic conditions. ROS attack DNA,
membrane lipids, transcription factors, and proteins to exert cell
toxicity (Nathan and Ding, 2010). Therefore, the reducing oxidative
damage could be beneﬁcial in preventing or alleviating neuronal
toxicity. Our results demonstrate that SES reduced lipid peroxidation and superoxide anion levels and restored ischemia-induced
depletion of reduced glutathione and SOD enzyme activity and
protein expression in ischemic brain of MCAO animals. These results
indicated that antioxidant properties of SES might act as a protective
mechanism, by increasing the levels of defense molecules such as
SODs and GSH, which combat oxidative stress induced by MCAO.

Apoptotic cell death is the hallmark of the ongoing ischemia
reperfusion injury. In fact, a signiﬁcant loss of neurons caused by
apoptosis has been reported in the ischemic cortex of the adult rats
following MCAO (Zhao et al., 2001). Major pathways leading to
apoptosis are initiated in the mitochondria and, including the
activation of procaspase-3, -8 and -9 (Zhang et al., 2012b). Our
results showed that SES reduced cleaved caspase-3 expression
(activation of procapase-3) in the ischemic brain tissue. This result
is consistent with other studies that reported antiapoptotic effect
of SES (Bournival et al., 2012a; Liu et al., 2013). Further, evidence
suggests that several pathological mechanisms can leads to
apoptosis including oxidative stress, ionic imbalance and excitotoxicity caused by excess glutamate release (Xu et al., 2014;
Matute et al., 2006). Also, MCAO activated microglia that secrete
cytokines, which can impair glutamate uptake can further
aggravate excitotoxicity. Our results indicate that SES induces
neuroprotection not only by reducing oxidative stress but also by
inhibiting apoptosis via reducing the activation of microglia.
Microglia is the main cell type in the brain that triggers innate
immune response and play important roles in both physiological
and pathological conditions. Activated microglia can damage
cerebral neurons through production of neurotoxins including ROS
and inﬂammatory cytokines (Wu, 2014). It has been shown that
ischemic brain injury elicits an inﬂammatory response that
involves activation of microglia (Tang et al., 2014). In addition
to neuronal damage, microglia potentiate endothelial damage and
contribute to post-ischemic blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption

(Yenari et al., 2006). Our results revealed that MCAO-induced brain
injury was associated with microglia activation in mice and that
treatment with SES reduced activated microglia. These observations are consistent with other studies that reported regulatory
effect of SES on activated microglia (Ohnishi et al., 2012).
ROS production by microglia occurs mainly by NADPH oxidase
subunit NOX activation. Several studies have demonstrated
increased expression of NOX, especially Nox-2 in the brain

following ischemia-reperfusion injury (Chen et al., 2011). Interestingly, it was reported that NOX-2 activity is required for
microglial activation in vitro and in vivo (Kauppinen et al., 2008). It
was also reported that NOX-2 not only plays a role in oxidant
generation in the post-ischemic brain but also involve in other
pathophysiological process, such as angiogenesis after ischemia
(Abramov et al., 2007). Accordingly, our results demonstrate
increased NOX-2 immunostaining in ischemic brain tissue and its

reduction by SES treatment. In contrast, it was reported that NOX
targeting reduced the oxidative stress in neurons and glia,
protected the endothelium, ameliorated the inﬂammatory
process, and reduced brain damage in experimental stroke (Chen
et al., 2011).
The results on the effect of SES on nitrosative stress induced by
nitric oxide and reactive nitrogen oxide species are also in
agreement with other reports (Cui et al., 2012; Iadecola et al., 1997;
Koh, 2012). The inducible isoform of NOS (iNOS) is expressed in
response to inﬂammatory process in cells, and thus, it is well
appreciated that iNOS produces neurotoxic NO that causes
neuronal cell death and exacerbates glutamate toxicity after
cerebral ischemia (Cui et al., 2012). However, inhibition of iNOS in
cerebral ischemia was reported to improve neurological deﬁcits,
reduces infarct volume, and reduces sensitivity to focal cerebral
ischemia (Iadecola et al., 1997; Koh, 2012). We found in the current
study that MCAO increases iNOS mRNA and protein levels in the
ischemic brain. This increase was markedly reduced by SES
treatment, which suggest iNOS pathway is involved in SES induced

neuroprotection. TTC staining also revealed signiﬁcant reduction
in the MCAO-induced infarct volume in SES treated mice brain
supporting neuronal protection. Further, collective evidence
suggests that the harmful effects of NO are mainly attributed to
its combination with superoxide, forming the strongly oxidative/
nitrative molecule peroxynitrite (ONOO) in cerebral ischemic
stroke (Kim et al., 2006). Our results indicated that SES treatment
attenuated ischemia-induced increase in peroxynitrite level thus
supporting the above ﬁndings.
Brain ischemic neurons are reported to express increase
cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, an enzyme that worsens the ischemic
injury by producing superoxide and prostaglandins (Candelario-Jalil
et al., 2005). The superoxide’s and prostaglandins activate excitotoxic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (Miettinen et al., 1997)
causing excitotoxicity. Moreover, COX-2 can directly damage
neurons (Graham and Hickey, 2003), and in fact reports suggest
that COX-2-deﬁcient mice are less susceptible to ischemic brain
injury and the NMDA mediated neurotoxicity (Sasaki et al., 2004). In
addition, speciﬁc inhibition of COX-2 attenuated the post-ischemic

in the ischemic brain, and thus provide further evidence for the
neuroprotective potential of SES in MCAO-induced brain injury.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that SES has potent
antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory properties and may be beneﬁcial in stroke patients. The possible underlying mechanisms are
inhibition of stroke-induced microglial activation and oxidative
stress, which subsequently lead to inhibition of MAPK activation,
inﬂammation and neuronal cell apoptosis.

prostaglandin accumulation and reduced ischemic damage (Candelario-Jalil et al., 2005). In line of these results, our data show that
MCAO increased COX-2 levels in brain tissue and SES treatment
reduced COX-2 levels in MCAO animals following SES treatment.
These results support previous studies that reported suppressive
effect of SES on COX-2 level in different experimental models
(Chiang et al., 2014; Hsieh et al., 2011). Post-ischemic inﬂammation
is triggered by activation of pro-inﬂammatory genes such as tumor
necrosis factor (TNF-a) and interleukin (IL-6), promoting accumulation of neutrophils, macrophages and activated microglia at the
site of injury (Tang et al., 2014). Activation of microglial cells further
ampliﬁes the inﬂammatory process and contributes to tissue
pathology (Jin et al., 2010). Therefore, targeting inﬂammatory
pathways may provide effective therapeutic intervention for
treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Recent studies have shown
the potential anti-inﬂammatory properties of SES against neuroinﬂammation and inﬂammatory mediators (Bournival et al., 2012b;
Lin et al., 2014). In agreement with these investigations, our results
indicated that SES treatment suppressed TNF-a and IL-6 mRNA
levels in ischemic brain and therefore may act as anti-inﬂammatory
agent.
Further, our results on the MAPKinase pathway including the
phosphorylation of ERK ½ and P38 in the ischemic brain are in
agreement in various earlier reports (Maddahi and Edvinsson,
2010; Zhao et al., 2013). Inhibition of the ERK pathway has been
found to down-regulate the expression of pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines and subsequent inﬂammatory response leading ultimately to neuroprotective effects against brain injury in cerebral
ischemia (Maddahi and Edvinsson, 2010). Further, studies have
shown that cerebral ischemia increases phosphorylation of P38 in
the brain (Zhao et al., 2013). These two proteins when activated
further aggravate ischemia-induced brain injury. Our results
showed that SES treatment reduced ERK ½ and P-38 activation
