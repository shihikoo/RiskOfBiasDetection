models of ischemic stroke. Levels of Ang 1–7 and expression
of ACE2 and Mas increase after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats.11 Several groups have shown that intracerebroventricular administration of Ang 1–7, administered
before and during MCAO, may attenuate neuronal damage in
rats after MCAO.12–14 Similarly, indirect approaches to increase
brain Ang 1–7 levels have been developed using intracerebroventricular administration of an ACE2 activator (diminazene),
which also may protect the brain against ischemic damage.14
Thus, several lines of evidence suggest that the ACE2/Ang
1–7/Mas receptor axis plays a protective role in pathophysiology of cerebrovascular disease and stroke.
In the current issue of Hypertension, Bennion et al15 extend
previous studies and demonstrate that the ACE2 activator, diminazene, when given intraperitoneally, attenuates brain damage and neurological deficit after ischemic stroke. The authors
used an MCAO model in which endothelin 1 is injected in the
proximity of the MCA and induces vasoconstriction. Using
this model, the authors report several findings. First, brain
ACE2 activity increases shortly after ischemic stroke. Second,
circulating ACE2 activity is also increased 3 days after ischemic stroke. Third, inhibition of cerebral ACE2 by intracerebroventricular injection of an ACE2 inhibitor (MLN-4760)
did not increase infarct volume, but resulted in aggravation
of neurological deficit after MCAO. Fourth, intraperitoneal
injection of an ACE2 activator decreased infarct volume and
neurological deficit after MCAO. Fifth, the beneficial effects
of the ACE2 activator after MCAO were attenuated by intracerebroventricular injection of a Mas receptor antagonist
(A779). Collectively, these results suggest that the formation
of Ang 1–7 and stimulation of Mas receptors are associated
with the beneficial effects of ACE2 activation in ischemic
stroke (Figure). The mechanisms by which ACE2 activation
protects the brain after ischemic stroke are not clear, but seem
to be independent of changes in blood pressure or cerebral
blood flow. Protective effects of ACE2 may involve modulation of neuroinflammation, as suggested by previous studies.
Importantly, although the authors used intraperitoneal injections, they demonstrated effects of the ACE2 activator in the
brain. The finding is important, with the potential for translation of these findings to the patient.
The long-term impact of interventions that target ACE2 and
Ang 1–7 in stroke is not clear. Is the early decrease in neurological deficit associated with better prognosis and survival?
Is circulating ACE2 activity a valid marker of brain damage
after stroke? Would increased circulating ACE2 activity be
associated with better prognosis or would it be associated with
systemic inflammation and increased shedding of ACE2 by

apid progress in relation to cardiovascular effects of
angiotensin 1 to 7 (Ang 1–7), the Mas receptor, and the
angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) is an example
of basic biomedical research, which may eventually lead to an
advance in care of patients.
When one of us (D.H.) first attended the meeting of the
Council for High Blood Pressure Research about 1970, the
future of studies of the renin/angiotensin system seemed limited. It looked like there was not much more to be learned and
was not a promising area of research. That judgment was comparable to the initial impression that Furchgott’s endothelium–
derived relaxing factor was not important.1 Obviously, the
renal/vascular/central renin/angiotensin system has proven to
be important in normal cardiovascular regulation, pathophysiology, and as an enormously important therapeutic target.
Another chapter of the renin/angiotensin system story has
been written during the past 2 decades as the ACE2/angiotensin Ang 1–7/Mas receptor axis has emerged. The first stage
was the discovery of Ang 1–7 by Ferrario,2 the role of ACE2
on enzymatic formation of Ang 1–7 by Penninger,3 and identification of the Ang 1–7 receptor, Mas, by Santos and Bader.4
The second stage was the finding that administration of exogenous Ang 1–7 is sufficiently potent to produce effects on the
cardiovascular system, and that the endogenous system is sufficiently potent to affect responses to several pathophysiological states.5
One of the important effects of ACE2/Ang 1–7/Mas receptor
axis is its effects on the brain and cerebral blood vessels. ACE2
and Ang 1–7 are important modulators of cerebrovascular
function.6,7 Treatment with Ang 1–7 seems to protect the brain
from inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress induced
by hypertension.8 Ang 1–7 also may play an important role
in cerebrovascular disease. In stroke-prone hypertensive rats9
and in a mouse model of rupture of intracranial aneurysms,10
Ang 1–7 seems to increase survival. The ACE2/Ang 1–7/Mas
receptor axis also seems to be modulated and be beneficial in

Figure. Brain ischemia induces neuroinflammation,
apoptosis, and oxidative stress and causes brain
damage. Recent studies revealed that brain
ischemia may increase the circulating and local
angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2)
activity. Increased ACE2 activity may lead to
increased formation of angiotensin 1 to 7 (Ang 1–7)
and stimulation of Mas receptors, which may be
neuroprotective. Similar effects can be obtained
after local or intraperitoneal administration of an
ACE2 activator (diminazene). Ang II indicates
angiotensin II.

TACE? Would systemic administration of Ang 1–7 protect the
brain after brain ischemia?
The future? These studies suggest that Ang 1–7/ACE2 Mas
axis may protect against stroke; an enormous word of caution,
however. Many studies have observed that a wide variety of
interventions reduce the size of ischemic strokes in experimental models (especially in rats and mice). But these interventions have failed to reduce the size of strokes in humans.
As a minimum, this area of research is clarifying mechanisms
by which endogenous Ang 1–7/ACE2 protects against stroke.
We are far from knowing however whether Ang 1–7 will be
the first peptide to protect against stroke in humans.
