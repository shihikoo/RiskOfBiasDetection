Background and Purpose—Temporary immunosuppression has been identified as a major risk factor for the development
of pneumonia after acute central nervous system injury. Although overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system
was previously shown to mediate suppression of systemic cellular immune responses after stroke, the role of the
parasympathetic cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in the antibacterial defense in lung remains largely elusive.
Methods—The middle cerebral artery occlusion model in mice was used to examine the influence of the parasympathetic
nervous system on poststroke immunosuppression. We used heart rate variability measurement by telemetry, vagotomy,
α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor–deficient mice, and parasympathomimetics (nicotine, PNU282987) to measure and
modulate parasympathetic activity.
Results—Here, we demonstrate a rapidly increased parasympathetic activity in mice after experimental stroke. Inhibition
of cholinergic signaling by either vagotomy or by using α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor–deficient mice reversed
pulmonary immune hyporesponsiveness and prevented pneumonia after stroke. In vivo and ex vivo studies on the role
of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor on different lung cells using bone marrow chimeric mice and isolated primary
cells indicated that not only macrophages but also alveolar epithelial cells are a major cellular target of cholinergic antiinflammatory signaling in the lung.
Conclusions—Thus, cholinergic pathways play a pivotal role in the development of pulmonary infections after acute central
nervous system injury.   (Stroke. 2015;46:3232-3240. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.008989.)

central nervous system injuries like stroke, spinal cord injury,
or traumatic brain injury disturb the normally well-balanced
interplay between these 2 supersystems, resulting in a profound
and long-lasting immunodepression.6,7 Overactivation of the
sympathetic nervous system after stroke was shown to mediate
suppression of peripheral cellular immune responses and to contribute to development of poststroke bacterial lung infections.8–10
However, changes in the pulmonary immune compartment
and the underlying mechanisms of impaired antibacterial lung
immune responses after stroke are currently not understood.

of stroke patients experience at least one relevant medical

complication after stroke.2 Among these, pneumonia is the
most relevant poststroke infection,3 accounting for the highest
attributable mortality after stroke.4
To maintain body homeostasis in response to challenges
from the environment, the nervous and immune systems are
closely interconnected in an intense bidirectional communication.5 Recent experimental and clinical evidence indicates that

a variety of receptors recognizing pathogens or their products.11 Rapid activation of MΦ and airway epithelium are of
crucial importance for effective host defense during bacterial
lung infections.12 Both MΦ and lung epithelial cells have been
shown to express the α7 nicotinergic acetylcholine receptor
(α7nAChR),13 which has been identified as a crucial downstream element of the so-called cholinergic anti-inflammatory
pathway.14 This neuronal pathway, involving the parasympathetic vagus nerve and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine
(ACh), was shown to act as a negative feedback loop to prevent
a potentially harmful overreaction of the immune system during inflammatory conditions, such as bacterial infections, by
suppressing the production of proinflammatory cytokines by
activated macrophages on binding of ACh to the α7nAChR.15
Here we demonstrate that stroke directly activates cholinergic
anti-inflammatory pathways, which are crucially involved in
the development of poststroke lung infections.

Materials and Methods
A detailed description of all materials and methods can be found in
the online-only Data Supplement.

Animals and Housing
Male specific pathogen free C57Bl6/J mice (Charles River
Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany), sex-mixed α7nAChR knockout
(KO) mice,16 and wild-type (WT) littermates, respectively (B6.129S7Chrna7tm1Bay/J; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor) were housed in
cages lined with chip bedding and environmental enrichment (mouse
tunnel and igloo) on a 12 h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to
food and water. Experiments were performed using 11- to 14-weekold mice in a­ ccordance with the European directive on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and all other applicable
regulations and approved by the relevant authority, Landesamt für
Gesundheit und Soziales, Berlin, Germany.

Experimental Stroke
Under general isoflurane anaethesia, a small silicon-coated filament
was temporarily introduced via the left common carotid artery into
the circle of Willis blocking the origin of the middle cerebral artery
for 60 min (middle cerebral artery occlusion [MCAo])17 following the
standard operating procedures of our laboratory. Success of MCAo
was verified by Bederson score, and animals without neurological
deficit after operation were excluded from the study.

Vagotomy
Five days before MCAo surgery and under isoflurane anesthesia, the
left cervical vagus nerve was carefully and bluntly dissected from the
common carotid artery and, in the vagotomy but not sham-operated
group, transected.

Broncho-Alveolar Lavage and Measurement of
Bacterial Burden
Under anaethesia with midazolam (5 mg/kg body weight) and medetomidin (0.5 mg/kg body weight) IP (antagonization with flumazenil 0.5 mg/kg body weight and atipamezol 5 mg/kg body weight, if
needed), mice were intubated with a 22G peripheral venous catheter.
Afterward, 0.4 mL of saline plus 0.2 mL air were applied over the
tubus and immediately withdrawn.18 For the determination of colony-forming units, broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was serially
diluted, plated on LB agar plates, and incubated at 37°C for 18 h,
and bacterial colonies were counted.8 The cut-off value (<104 colonyforming units/mL) has been determined by investigating BAL fluid
of naïve mice.

Drug Preparation and Administration
Nicotine (Sigma Aldrich) was given via drinking water in a concentration of 100 μg/mL. The effects on heart rate (HR) were monitored
by pulse oximetry (MouseOx; STARR life sciences Corp.).

Creation of Bone Marrow Chimeric Mice
For generation of bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice, BM cells
were isolated under sterile conditions from the tibias and femurs
of donor mice. 5×106 BM cells were IV injected into 6- to 8-weekold lethally irradiated recipient mice 24 h after total body irradiation (1100 cGy) using a 137Caesium Gammacell 40 Exactor
(Theratronics).

Telemetry
Blood pressure (BP) and HR were measured by telemetry combined
with fast Fourier transform analysis of BP and HR, as described
elsewhere.19 In mice aged 8 to 10 weeks, transmitters (TA11PA-C10
BP; Data Sciences International) were implanted in a subcutaneous
pocket along the right flank with the pressure-sensing catheter in the
abdominal aorta. After 7 days recovery, baseline was recorded using DATAQUEST software (A.R.T. 2.1, Data Sciences International),
and sympathetic and parasympathetic activities were verified pharmacologically by applying metoprolol (4 mg/kg) and atropine (2 mg/
kg), respectively. Parasympathetic activity was assessed via spectral
analysis using PV-wave software (Visual Numerics). The power spectra of systolic BP, pulse interval time series, and the cross spectra
were calculated using fast Fourier transformation. Low-frequency
components of pulse intervals spectrum (LF), root mean square of
successive differences between adjacent normal pulse intervals, total
power, and the baroreflex sensitivity (BRS-LF) were calculated. The
baroreceptor HR reflex was investigated using sequence technique
and spectral function analysis of spontaneous changes in systolic
BP and HR, and BRS was defined as the mean magnitude value of
transfer function between systolic BP and R-R interval in the lowfrequency band (BRS-LF).

Flow Cytometry
Cell phenotyping was performed on an LSRII flow cytometer using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software
(Tree Star Inc.) with the following anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies: CD45-PE-Cy7, CD3-APC, CD4-A700, CD8-PB, NK1.1-PE,
CD11b-APC-Cy7, B220-FITC, SiglecF-PE, F4/80-A700, CD11cFITC, CD11b-PE-TR, Gr1-PB, and MHCII-APC-Cy7 (Biolegend).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorter–based cell sorting was performed
on a FACSAria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences).

Isolation of Primary Alveolar Macrophages and
Alveolar Epithelial Cells
MΦ were obtained by repeated gentle flushing of tracheotomized
lungs from naïve C57Bl6/J mice with NaCl, centrifugation (300g,
10 min), and resuspension in Roswell Park Memorial Institute
medium. For purification of AEC,20 lungs were flushed after perfusion and BAL with 1500 μL dispase followed by intratracheal
injection of 500 μL of 1% low melting temperature agarose. Lung
single-cell suspension (homogenization in DMEM) underwent
magnetic cell separation for depletion of nonepithelial cells using
anti-CD45, anti-CD31, and anti-CD16/CD32 mAb (BioLegend).
Purity of macrophages and epithelial cells was confirmed by flow
cytometry (>95% and >90%, respectively).

Analysis of Ex Vivo Cytokine Production
Lung single-cell suspensions (2×106/mL), isolated primary MΦ
(1×105/mL), or primary AEC (1×10E5/mL) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 μg/mL; Sigma) or Pam3CSK4 (200 ng/
mL; Invivogen) in the absence or presence of different concentrations
of nicotine or PNU282987 (both from Sigma) for 12 h at 37°C.

Analysis of Cytokines in BAL and Cell Culture
Supernatants
Cytokines in BAL and cell culture supernatant were measured by
magnetic bead–based assay on a Bio-Plex 200 System (Luminex
xMAP Technology) with Bio-Plex Manager 6.0 software (Bio-Rad)
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase
Chain Reaction
RNA was extracted from fluorescence-activated cell–sorted or
Dynabead-purified lung cells using the NucleoSpin RNA II Kit
(Macherey-Nagel). cDNA synthesis was done using the QuantiTect
kit (Qiagen) and measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (7500 Sequence Detection System,
Applied Biosystems) with β-Actin as housekeeping gene.

Treatment allocation was performed randomly and remained completely blinded for the examiners. Appropriate 2-sided statistical tests
were used to compare groups for significant differences (P<0.05; SPSS
Statistics 18.0, IBM). Closed testing procedure was applied in telemetry experiments, putting the comparisons at different time points in
a hierarchical order. A priori sample size calculation (G*Power3.021)
assumed a change in bacterial burden by 100-fold as relevant or a doubling of HR variability (HRV) parameters, respectively. Prespecified
inclusion and exclusion criteria and detailed report on flow of animals through the experiments are reported in the online-only Data
Supplement (Tables I and II in the online-only Data Supplement).

Results
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Reduces HR and
Increases Blood Pressure
To obtain unbiased data on physiological responses after experimental stroke in mice, we established a telemetric approach
to measure HR and BP in a quiet, undisturbed environment. In
MCAo mice, HR was decreased during the first 3 days after
surgery compared with baseline and sham-operated animals.
BP rose in both groups, but remained significantly elevated
for 5 days in MCAo animals compared with sham controls
(Figure IA and IB in the online-only Data Supplement).
Physical activity was slightly reduced in both groups compared with baseline with no group differences in the first 2
weeks (Figure IC in the online-only Data Supplement).

Increased HRV and Baroreflex Sensitivity Indicates
Parasympathetic Activation After Experimental
Stroke
In contrast to sham-operated animals, we observed a strong
increase in the LF power component of HRV reflecting
increased parasympathetic activity in MCAo-treated mice on
day 1, 3, and 5 after surgery (Figure 1A). These findings were
corroborated by changes in 2 time domain parameters describing parasympathetic activity in HRV, the standard deviation of
RR intervals (Figure 1B), and the root mean square of successive RR differences (Figure 1C).
BRS is the ability to adapt the sinus frequency in response
to BP changes. Cross spectral analysis of the BRS-LF, calculated as mean value of the transfer function between systemic
BP and pulse intervals in the LF band, revealed a significant
increase within the first 5 days after experimental stroke
(Figure 1D). One, 3, and 5 days after experimental stroke, the

adaptation time for up slopes and down slopes of systemic
BP were increased compared with baseline and sham controls
(Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement).

Unilateral Vagotomy Reduces Bacterial Burden by
Restoring Pulmonary Immune Function
MCAo animals develop spontaneous bacterial pneumonia
between day 1 and day 3 after experimental cerebral ischemia.8 To investigate the influence of parasympathetic activation on poststroke infections, we first performed unilateral
cervical vagotomy. In mice that underwent vagotomy 5 days
before MCAo, we observed a significant reduction in bacterial load on day 3 after MCAo compared with sham vagotomized stroke animals (Figure 2A). Importantly, administration
of nicotine in drinking water reversed the beneficial effect of
vagotomy on bacterial pneumonia after stroke (Figure 2A).
Infarct volumes and HR did not significantly differ between
the groups (Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement).
Assessment of ex vivo cytokine secretion by lung cells isolated 1 day after MCAo revealed reduced release of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-α after stimulation with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
agonist LPS (Figure 2B and 2C) and the TLR1/2 agonist
Pam3CSK4 (Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement) in
MCAo mice compared with sham controls. In contrast, lung
cells isolated from mice vagotomized 5 days before MCAo
released similar amounts of IL-6 and TNF-α after Pam3CSK4
and LPS stimulation as lung cells from sham-operated controls.
Treatment of MCAo animals with nicotine in drinking water
decreased ex vivo proinflammatory cytokine production after
TLR stimulation of lung cells isolated from vagotomized mice
to levels observed in non- or sham-vagotomized animals (Figure
2B and 2C; Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement).

Role of α7nAChR in Diminished Antibacterial
Defense in Lung After Experimental Stroke
The α7nAChR receptor has been described as mediator of
cholinergic anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages.14
Similar to the effects of vagotomy in WT animals, mice lacking the α7nAChR showed significantly less bacterial load in
lungs after MCAo compared with WT littermates (Figure 3A).
Nicotine did not further increase lung bacterial burden in WT
mice. In α7nAChR KO mice, bacterial loads in lung increased
only slightly by nicotine treatment but remained at lower levels compared with WT animals. Infarct volumes and HR did
not significantly differ between the groups (Figure 3B and
3C). The rather small number of male compared with female
animals per group does not allow a definitive conclusion on
sex-related differences of α7nAChR KO mice in response to
stroke. However, subgroup analysis of infarct volumes and
bacterial burden in lung does not suggest sex-specific differences (data not shown).

Figure 1. Markers of parasympathetic activity in heart rate (HR) variability are increased during the first days after experimental stroke.
Heart rate variability was assessed by frequency domain analysis (low-frequency HR variability oscillation [LF-HRV], A), time domain analysis as the standard deviation of RR intervals (SD-RRI, B), and the root mean square of successive RR differences (RMSSD, C). Baroreflex sensitivity reflects the ability of the body to adapt the heart rate to changes of blood pressure, and less sensitive after middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAo) in low-frequency oscillations (BRS-LF, D). Data from 2 independent experiments with n=14 (baseline), n=11 (d1),
n=11 (d3), n=9 (d5) to n=7 (d14) animals; *indicates P<0.05 (Mann–Whitney U test in closed testing procedure).

immunodepression, we investigated the development of poststroke pneumonia in mice responding to α7nAChR-mediated
cholinergic signaling either in BM-derived cells (WT→KO)
or resident lung cells (KO→WT). For control, we transplanted
BM cells from WT into WT animals (WT→WT) and from
KO into KO animals (KO→KO). After experimental stroke,
bacterial burden in lung was significantly reduced in KO→KO
mice compared with WT→WT mice (Figure 4A), corroborating findings observed in α7nAChR KO and WT mice (compare Figure 3A). Both KO→WT and WT→KO chimeric mice
showed an intermediate phenotype regarding susceptibility to
pneumonia compared with syngeneic controls (Figure 4A).
Lung cells isolated 3 days after MCAo from ischemic
WT→WT mice produced significantly lower TNF-α levels after
LPS stimulation than lung cells from KO→KO mice, whereas
lung cells from WT→KO and KO→WT chimeric mice again
exhibited an intermediate phenotype compared with KO→KO
and WT→WT mice (Figure 4B).

mRNA Expression Pattern of α7nAChR in Alveolar
Macrophages and Alveolar Epithelial Cells
To determine the cellular expression pattern of α7nAChR in
lung tissue, we sorted single cell suspensions from WT mice
by magnetic cell sorting. α7nAChR was ≈50-fold higher
expressed in AEC compared with MΦ. In contrast, α7nAChR

expression was not observed in endothelial cells, NK-, B-, and
T-lymphocytes, dendritic cells, or granulocytes (Figure 5).

Diminished Cytokine Production in AEC and MΦ
upon α7nAChR Stimulation
To investigate cell type–dependent α7nAChR-mediated
effects, we assessed TLR ligand–induced IL-6 release in primary AEC and MΦ. Nicotine diminished LPS-induced IL-6
production in AEC isolated from WT but not α7nAChR KO
mice in a dose–dependent manner (Figure 6A). Likewise,
α7nAChR-specific agonist PNU282987 suppressed IL-6
release in LPS-stimulated AEC from WT but not α7nAChR
KO mice (Figure 6C). In contrast, nicotine and PNU282987
dose-dependently reduced LPS-induced IL-6 secretion in
MΦ from WT and to lesser extent also in α7nAChR KO mice
(Figure 6B and 6D). These data suggest that cholinergic control of TLR-induced proinflammatory cytokine release by MΦ
is partly independent from α7nAChR.

Discussion
Besides neurological deficits leading to dysphagia and aspiration, suppression of peripheral immune responses because of an
overactivation of stress pathways has been recognized as a critical risk factor for the development of infectious complications
after stroke. Previous studies in experimental stroke models have

Figure 2. A, Vagotomy prevents poststroke pneumonia. In contrast to sham vagotomy, vagotomy 5 days before middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAo) significantly reduced bacterial load in the lung at day 3 after experimental stroke. This effect is abrogated if animals
were treated before MCAo with the acetylcholine receptor agonist nicotine in drinking water. Dashed line: bacterial load in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from naïve mice (n=32; winsorized; Kruskal–Wallis test P=0.026; *indicating P<0.05 in Dunn’s post hoc test; pooled

sham vagotomy (Sham) was performed 5 days before MCAo, and nonvagotomzied animals (−) served as controls. Lung cells (2×106/mL)
were isolated on day 1 after MCAo or Sham surgery and stimulated ex vivo for 12 h with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Vagotomy significantly
increased Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced interleukin (IL)-6 (B) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (C) production after MCAo. Again, treatment of animals with nicotine in drinking water reversed the beneficial effect of vagotomy on ex vivo TLR-induced cytokine release. Bar
graphs show mean±SD; n=39; 1-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test using vagotomy MCAo without Nicotine as group of comparison (*indicates P<0.05, **P<0.01, and ***P<0.001; pooled data from 2 independent experiments).

provided evidence that an increased activity of the sympathetic
nervous system after cerebral ischemia leads to rapid impairment of peripheral cellular immune responses, in particular natural killer cell and T cell responses. These experimental findings
were corroborated by clinical studies showing increased levels
of catecholamines and reduced T cell counts in peripheral blood,

as well as impaired ex vivo T cell function in stroke patients
before the onset of infectious complications.6,10 Thus, although
pathophysiological responses in human diseases and respective
mouse models may markedly differ as recently shown for the
genomic response in acute inflammatory conditions,22 the MCAo

Figure 4. α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) on bone marrow–derived and resident lung epithelial cells is involved in cholinergic anti-inflammatory effects after stroke. To assess the relative contribution of α7nAChR expression on bone marrow–derived and
resident lung epithelial cells in antibacterial defense after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), we generated bone marrow chimeras
between α7nAChR knockout mice (α7 KO) and wild-type (WT) littermates, as described in Materials and Methods. A, Bacterial burden in
lung was significantly reduced only if α7nAChR was absent on both bone marrow–derived and epithelial cells (n=52; Kruskal–Wallis test
P=0.01 with * indicating P<0.05 in Dunn’s post hoc test, pooled data from 2 independent experiments). B, Lung cells (2×106/mL) were isolated at day 3 after MCAo and stimulated ex vivo with lipopolysaccharide (1 μg/mL). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α concentration in cell
culture supernatants was measured 12 h after stimulation. TNF-α release was significantly increased only if α7nAChR was absent on both
bone marrow–derived and epithelial cells (n=21; Kruskal–Wallis test P=0.01 with * indicating P<0.05 in Dunn’s post hoc test).

mechanisms of increased susceptibility to infection and to
develop preventive treatment strategies.23 However, it remained
unclear whether cerebral ischemia affects resident lung cells,
which mediate first-line pulmonary immune responses during
respiratory infections. Our data suggest that lung innate immune
responses are suppressed after stroke by increased cholinergic
signaling, which is relayed by the parasympathetic vagus nerve
and the α7nAChR expressed on AEC and MΦ. Hence, both an
impaired early T/NK-cell dysfunction mediated by sympathetic
nervous system and an impaired innate immune response in the
lung mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system seem to
be important additive mechanisms leading to decreased antibacterial defense and poststroke bacterial infections.
The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway has been
described as a protective mechanism that prevents potentially

harmful overactivation of the immune system in response to
infections or inflammation-induced tissue damage. Sensing
of peripheral inflammatory processes via vagal afferent fibers
was initially proposed to trigger an anti-inflammatory response
via release of acetylcholine from vagal efferent fibers, which
acts on α7nAChR on macrophages to suppress the release of
proinflammatory cytokines.14 Recent evidence suggests, however, that the neural reflex that is triggered by and dampens
systemic inflammatory responses may be more complex and
involve non-neural cholinergic and noradrenergic sympathetic
mechanisms.24 Nevertheless, vagus nerve stimulation by centrally acting muscarinic agonists, such as CNI-1493, has been
shown to suppress peripheral inflammatory responses that can
be prevented by vagotomy, demonstrating that the vagus is
an essential efferent pathway of the central cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway.25
Assessment of HRV has been recognized to provide reliable, noninvasive information on the activity of the autonomic
nervous system, including its vagal and sympathetic components. Using a telemetry system, we observed an immediate
and long-lasting activation of the parasympathetic nervous
system after cerebral ischemia, which is in line with previous
observations showing a similar increase in root mean square
of successive RR differences and LF-HRV after experimental
stroke in mice.26 Because HRV parameters have been shown
to differ between species with respect to the influence of parasympathetic and sympathetic outflow,27 we have verified the
specificity of selected HRV measures by pharmacological
blockade of sympathetic and parasympathetic input using the
selective antagonists metoprolol and atropine, respectively.19
According to the few clinical data, autonomic dysfunctions in
stroke patients occur in the acute phase with a predominance
of parasympathetic rather than sympathetic dysfunction.28–30
Although measurement of HRV reflects primarily autonomic influences on the cardiovascular system, several
human studies have linked changes in HRV with markers of

LPS-induced IL-6 production in AEC from WT
but not α7nAChR KO mice in a dose-dependant manner. In contrast, nicotine (B) reduced
the LPS-induced IL-6 secretion in MF isolated
from both WT and α7nAChR mice, whereas
PNU282987 (D) at lower concentrations
selectively suppressed IL-6 secretion in MF
from WT, but not α7nAChR KO mice. Data
are presented as mean±SD with *P<0.05 and
**P<0.01 (2-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post
hoc test, n=4–12 per group, pooled data from
2 independent experiments).

inflammation and immunity.31,32 An increase in sympathetic
and parasympathetic HRV parameters is associated with
worse outcome after stroke.9,33,34
In the present study, we demonstrated that increased
parasympathetic activity after cerebral ischemia plays a crucial role in mediating increased susceptibility to bacterial
pneumonia after stroke. Although MCAo animals developed
spontaneous bacterial infections, either disruption of parasympathetic signaling in WT mice by vagotomy or inhibition of cholinergic effects by using α7nAChR-deficient mice
reduced bacterial burden in BAL fluid almost completely to
levels observed in naïve mice (<104 colony-forming units /
mL).35 Furthermore, vagotomy resulted in the restoration of
inflammatory responses triggered by TLR agonist in lung
cells in stroke animals. Moreover, treatment of MCAo animals
with the nonselective nAChR agonist nicotine prevented the
beneficial effect of vagotomy on lung bacterial burden and on
ex vivo cytokine secretion by lung cells in WT mice but only
slightly increased bacterial load in α7nAChR mice, indicating
that suppression of pulmonary antibacterial responses after
stroke by cholinergic signals involves α7nAChR. Because we
have not assessed all physiological parameters under parasympathetic control in these experiments, other than immune
mechanisms might be involved in poststroke pneumonia.
However, vagotomy resulted in the restoration of inflammatory responses triggered by TLR agonist in lung cells in stroke
animals. Recently, Lafargue et al made the important observation that mice deficient in α7nAChR showed reduced lung
injury and mortality compared with WT mice in an aspirationinduced Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia model after
experimental stroke.36 However, the Pseudomonas aspiration
pneumonia model does not reflect the pathophysiological
course of lung infections in stroke patients because it requires
a high bacterial inoculum, which by itself may trigger (neural) mechanisms to perturb pulmonary immune defense other
than those induced by central activation of cholinergic antiinflammatory mechanisms after acute central nervous system

-injury.37 Our study provides direct evidence for the crucial
role of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway in the
development of spontaneous pneumonia after MCAo in mice.
Both, MΦ and AEC play a crucial role in the first-line
defense against pulmonary infections.11,12 Cholinergic signals
transmitted via the α7nAChR have been previously shown to
limit inflammatory responses in these cells.38 Accordingly,
we examined whether resident lung immune competent cells
or BM-derived immune cell are predominantly targeted by
cholinergic anti-inflammatory signaling after stroke. Our
results using a model of BM chimerism between WT and
α7nAChR-deficient mice suggest that the inhibitory effects of
α7nAChR-mediated cholinergic signaling are exerted on both
lung-resident cells and BM-derived immune cells because
chimeric mice showed an intermediate phenotype in terms
of bacterial burden and ex vivo cytokine secretion capacity
of whole lung cells compared with syngeneic WT→WT and
KO→KO controls.
To further elucidate pulmonary cellular targets of cholinergic anti-inflammatory signaling, we determined α7nAchR
expression in sorted cells isolated from lung. We observed
α7nAChR expression only in AEC and MΦ but not in endothelial cells or other leukocyte subsets. Ex vivo functional
analysis revealed that the anti-inflammatory effects of cholinergic signaling on AEC were largely dependent on the
presence of the α7-subunit nAChR because suppression of
TLR-induced proinflammatory cytokine production by the
nonselective nAchR agonist nicotine and the selective α7
agonist PNU282987 was observed in primary AEC from
WT but not α7nAChR-deficient mice. In contrast, although
PNU282987 showed α7nAChR-dependent inhibitory effects
on MΦ, nicotine dose-dependently suppressed IL-6 production in these cells also in the absence of α7nAChR. Although
α7nAChR was consistently detectable in MΦ, expression levels were ≈100-fold lower compared with primary AEC. These
data suggest that nicotinic receptors other than α7nAchR may
be involved in cholinergic anti-inflammatory signaling in MΦ.

Several studies suggested that stimulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway via vagus nerve and α7nAChR
may also be a neuroprotective strategy.39–41 However, our data
strongly suggest that inhibition of peripheral parasympathetic
actions is beneficial in terms of medical complications after
stroke, whereas an additional stimulation of the cholinergic
pathway might exacerbate the risk for life-threatening bacterial infections. Thus, immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies
will have to consider and keep the balance between reversal of
the peripheral stroke-induced immunodepression and concurrent preservation of its putative neuroprotective effects.
In summary, although activation of cholinergic antiinflammatory mechanisms during local and systemic inflammatory responses may be a protective feedback mechanism to
limit potentially harmful effects of overt inflammation, central
nervous system injury–induced activation of such pathway in
the absence of an inflammatory stimulus may inappropriately
inhibit first-line antimicrobial responses and increase susceptibility to infectious complications after acute central nervous
system injury.

Detailed Materials and Methods	  
Animals and Housing
Male SPF C57Bl6/J mice (Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany), gender mixed α7
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) knockout (ko) mice 1 and wild type (WT)
littermates respectively (B6.129S7-Chrna7tm1Bay/J; JAX-stock 003232; The Jackson
Laboratory, Bar Harbour, USA) were housed in cages lined with chip bedding and
environmental enrichment (mouse tunnel and igloo; Plexx B.V., Elst, The Netherlands) on a
12 h light/dark cycle (change 7 o’ clock) with ad libitum access to food (standard chow) and
water. At the time of the experiment, mice were 11 – 14 weeks old.
Experimental stroke
The surgical procedure of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) was performed as
described 2 according to the standard operating procedures of our lab 3. In brief, after a ventral
cervical midline incision a small silicon-coated filament was introduced over the left common
carotid artery and the internal carotid artery into the circle of Willis blocking the origin of the
Middle Cerebral Artery. The filament was left in place for 60 min. Body temperature was
controlled throughout the whole procedure and isoflurane (Abott, Wiesbaden, Germany) in a
1:2 mixture oxygen/nitrous oxide was used for anaesthesia. Success of MCAo was verified by
Bederson score, and animals without neurological deficit after operation were excluded from
the study.
Vagotomy
Left cervical vagotomy was performed 5 days before MCAo surgery. In brief, under
isoflurane anaesthesia the left cervical vagus nerve was carefully and bluntly dissected from
the common carotid artery and transected. In sham-operated mice, the left vagus nerve was
exposed and isolated from the surrounding tissue but was not transected.
Broncho-alveolar lavage and measurement of bacterial burden
Mice were anaesthetized using midazolam (5,0 mg/kg BW ) and medetomidin (0,5 mg/kg
BW) i.p. and then suspended at an 60° angle by the two front upper teeth by a wire attached to
a plexiglas support. 4 A 22G peripheral venous catheter (BD, Heidelberg, Germany) was used
as tubus and a 0.5-mm optical fiber (Communication grade plastic fiber #NT02-542, Edmund
Optics, Karlsruhe, Germany) attached to a cold light source was used for illumination. 5 The
tongue is pulled out with a small spatula (custom build, Medizinisch-technische Labore
Charité, Berlin, Germany) and the mouse is intubated. Afterwards, 0.4 ml of saline plus 0.2
ml air were applied over the tubus and immediately withdrawn. 6 Where re-awaking was
intended, anesthesia was antagonized by s.c. administration of flumazenil (0,5 mg/kg BW; )
and atipamezol (5 mg/kg BW; ). For the determination of colony forming units (CFU), BAL
fluid was serially diluted, plated on LB agar plates, incubated at 37° C for 18 h and bacterial
colonies were counted as described elsewhere in detail. 7 As characterized before study start,
low levels of bacteria (<104 CFU/ml) in BAL fluid of naïve mice are detected with this
method, maybe related to flushing also tracheal segments.
Drug preparation and administration
Nicotine (Sigma Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) was given via drinking water in a
concentration of 100 µg/ml. The effects on heart rate of all drugs were monitored. After
having trained mice to stay in a restrainer, heart rate was measured by pulse oximetry
(MouseOx; STARR life sciences Corp., Allison Park, PA, USA) in conscious, non-sedated
animals.

Creation of bone-marrow chimeric mice
Bone-marrow (BM) chimeric mice were generated as described previously 8. Briefly, BM
cells were isolated under sterile conditions from the tibias and femurs of WT α7nAChR-/mice. 5x106 BM cells were i.v. injected into 6 to 8 week old lethally irradiated α7nAChR-/- or
WT recipient mice 24h after total body irradiation (1,100 cGy) using a 137Caesium
Gammacell® 40 Exactor (Theratronics, Ottawa, Canada). BM engraftment was assessed by
flow cytometric analysis and PCR analysis of α7nAChR in peripheral blood and spleen 8
weeks after transplantation. In two mice, the PCR analysis did not allow a definitive
confirmation (mice are included).
Telemetry
Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were measured by telemetry combined with fast
Fourier transform analysis of BP and HR, as described elsewhere. 9, 10 In brief, TA11PA-C10
BP devices (Data Sciences International, St. Paul, MN, USA) were implanted in mice aged 810 weeks. Mice were anesthetized by isoflurane. Then, we advanced the pressure-sensing
catheter of the TA11PA-C10 device through the right femoral artery into the abdominal aorta
and placed the transmitter in a subcutaneous pocket along the right flank. Mice recovered for
7 days before baseline BP and HR values were recorded. By this time, the mice had regained
their circadian BP and HR rhythm; and surgery and anaesthesia-induced changes in blood
pressure and HR had abated. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP),
mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded using the DATAQUEST
software (A.R.T. 2.1, Data Sciences International). Appropriate recording of sympathetic and
parasympathetic activities was verified pharmacologically by applying metoprolol (4 mg/kg)
and atropine (2 mg/kg), respectively. Fourteen days after baseline measurements, mice
underwent MCAo or Sham operation, and BP and HR recordings were restarted immediately
after the operation.
To exclude influences of different levels of activity of mice on heart rate and blood pressure
related parameters, locomotor activity was measured throughout the experimental period, by
measuring spatial movement of the transmitter over the receiver unit.
Spectral Analysis
For evaluation of cardiovascular function, the baroreceptor heart rate reflex and HRV in the
low frequency range (HRV-LF) were investigated using spontaneous changes in BP and HR.
The power spectra of SBP, pulse interval time series, and the cross spectra were calculated
using fast Fourier transformation (FFT). Low-frequency components of pulse intervals
spectrum (LF), root mean square of successive differences between adjacent normal pulse
intervals (RMSSD), total power and the baroreflex sensitivity (BRS-LF) were calculated.
Beat-to-beat values of detected R-R intervals and BP values were interpolated, lowpass
filtered (cut-off 6 Hz) and re-sampled at 12 Hz. Data segments of 43 seconds were used for
spectral analysis. Linear trends were removed and power spectral density was estimated with
the FFT-based Welch algorithm using segments of 512 data points with 50% overlapping and
Hanning window. The power in the frequency range of low frequencies (LF: 0.25 to 0.6 Hz)
was calculated. Five representative intervals were chosen for spectral analysis and averaged
according to the following criteria: 1) steady state conditions, 2) no large sudden BP changes,
3) no artefacts. The frequency bands were adapted for analysis in mice considering the ranges
of HR and breathing frequencies.

Baroreceptor heart rate reflex
The baroreceptor heart rate reflex was investigated using sequence technique and spectral
function analysis of spontaneous changes in SBP and HR. Applying sequence technique,
spontaneous baroreflex slope was calculated as the slope of the linear regression line between
SBP and the subsequent R-R intervals using sequences defined as an episode of at least three
heart beats with more than 0.01 mmHg SBP per beat. Mean values of slopes with a
correlation coefficient greater than 0.85 were calculated for sequences with rising BP (BRSup). Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was defined as the mean magnitude value of transfer
function between SBP and R-R interval in the low-frequency band (BRS-LF) with negative
phase and squared coherence value greater than 0.5. A negative phase indicates that BP leads
R-R interval and a coherence value greater 0.5 indicates a dominating linear relationship. The
data analysis was performed with the PV-wave software (Visual Numerics, Houston, TX,
U.S.A.). 11
Flow cytometry
For flow cytometric analysis the following fluorochrome-conjugated anti-mouse monoclonal
antibodies were used: CD45-PE-Cy7, CD3-APC, CD4-A700, CD8-PB, NK1.1-PE, CD11bAPC-Cy7, B220-FITC, SiglecF-PE, F4/80-A700, CD11c-FITC, CD11b-PE-TR, Gr1-PB and
MHCII-APC-Cy7 (Biolegend). Cell phenotyping was performed on a LSRII flow cytometer
using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software
(Tree Star Inc.). FACS-based cell sorting was performed on a FACSAria III cell sorter (BD
Biosciences) using the following combination of lineage markers: epithelial cells (CD45CD16/CD32-CD31-EpCam+), myeloid cells (CD45+CD11b+), endothelial cells (CD45CD16/CD32-CD31-EpCam+), NK cells (CD45+CD3-NK1.1+), B cells (CD45+CD11b-CD3B220+), T cells (CD45+CD11b-CD3+B220-), granulocytes (CD45+CD11bhighGr1+),
dendritic cells (CD45+CD11b+CD11c+F4/80-SiglecF-), macrophages (CD45+CD11bF4/80+SiglecF+).
Isolation of primary alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells
Alveolar macrophages were obtained by repeated gentle flushing of the tracheotomized lungs
from naïve C57Bl6/J mice with 500µl NaCl resulting in a final volume of 5ml. BAL fluid was
centrifuged at 300g for 10 minutes, cell pellet resuspended in RPMI and an aliquot analyzed
by flow cytometry to assess purity of alveolar macrophages (>95%). Purification of alveolar
epithelial cells was performed after perfusion and BAL, as described 12. Briefly, lungs were
flushed with 1500µl dispase and followed by intra-tracheal injection of 500 µl of 1% low
melting temperature agarose. Subsequently, lung tissue was homogenized in DMEM. To
obtain alveolar epithelial cells, lung single-cell suspension was then incubated with biotinlabeled anti-CD45, anti-CD31, and anti-CD16/CD32 mAb (BioLegend) followed by
incubation with streptavidin-labeled magnetic beads and magnetic cell separation for
depletion of non-epithelial cells. Purity of alveolar epithelial cells (EpCAM+) was >90% as
confirmed by flow cytometry.
Analysis of ex vivo cytokine production
Lung single cell suspensions (2x10E6/ml), isolated primary alveolar macrophages
(1x10E5/ml), or primary alveolar epithelial cells (1x10E5/ml) were stimulated with LPS
(1µg/ml; Sigma) or Pam3CSK4 (200ng/ml; Invivogen) in the absence or presence of different
concentrations of nicotine or PNU282987 (both from Sigma) for 12h at 37°C. Culture
supernatant was stored at -80°C until analysis of cytokine expression.

Analysis of cytokines in BAL and cell culture supernatants
Cytokines in BAL and cell culture supernatant were measured by magnetic bead-based assay
(Plex-Bezeichnung) on a Bio-PlexTM200 System (Luminex xMAPTM Technology). Samples,
standards and controls were run in duplicates according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Data were analyzed using Bio-Plex Manager 6.0 software (Bio-Rad).
qRT-PCR
RNA was extracted from FACS-sorted or Dynabead-purified lung cells using the NucleoSpin
RNA IITM Kit (Macherey-Nagel). cDNA synthesis was done using the QuantiTectTM kit
(Qiagen) and measured by Real-Time qRT-PCR (7500 Sequence Detection System, Applied
Biosystems). We used ß-Actin as a housekeeping gene. Primer sequences: α7nAChR exon1-3
Fwd: gaggcatctggctggctctg, Rev: cagggagaagtacacggtgag; α7nAChR exon3-4 Fwd:
ctcaccgtgtacttctccctg, Rev: gtactcagacatgttccactgc and α7nAChR exon9-10 Fwd:
gtgctgcgatatcaccaccatg, Rev: ctcagctccacactggccag.
Inclusion and Exclusion
All analyses are based on the Full-Analysis-Set, including all animals that were alive at the
respective time points (Supplementary table I). Beside mortality, animals were sacrificed to
prevent inacceptable suffering according to predefined criteria which include weight loss
≥30%; severe motor dysfunction (e.g. loss of ability to stand); severe pain; apathy and no
food uptake for more than 1 day; severe infection (one of following signs: acute change in
body temperature by >2° C, dehydration, acute loss of body weight ≥20%); generalized and
repeated seizures; or behavioral abnormalities prohibiting species-appropriate behavior. In the
bone marrow chimera experiment, one animal was included in error and had to be excluded
(genotype of recipient was heterozygous).
Statistics
Treatment allocation was performed randomly (prepared lists or schemes) and remained
completely blinded for the examiners. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD)
and presented as Box plots with whiskers Minimum to Maximum or – where applicable –
with whiskers plus outliers. Not normally distributed data were analysed by Kruskal Wallis
analysis and pairwise Dunn’s method or Mann-Whitney-U Test respectively, using SPSS
Statistics 18.0 software (IBM Somers, NY, USA). Where applicable, we used Student’s TTest and ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. All tests were two-sided. Closed testing
procedure was applied in telemetry experiments, putting the comparisons at different time
points as separate hypothesis in a hierarchical order. In the vagotomy experiment (bacterial
burden), winsorising was applied due to outliers. A priori sample size calculation was
performed with G*Power 3.0 13 assuming a change in bacterial burden by 100 fold as
relevant, or a doubling of HRV parameters respectively.
In case that the drop-out rate was higher than estimated prior to the experiment, statistical
analysis was performed after completion of the planned experiment and actual power was
determined. Only in a few groups, sample sizes were smaller than initially planned due to an
higher than expected mortality. However even with the smaller number of animals statistical
analysis revealed statistically meaningful effects. In accordance with the 3R principles and
European and German laws and regulations on protection of laboratory animals we have not
increased the number of animals to reach the initially planned sample size and stopped the
experiment under these circumstances.

Supplementary Figure I Experimental stroke alters heart rate, arterial blood pressure und
activity. A telemetry transmitter was implanted 14 days before MCAo or Sham surgery (day
0). Baseline was recorded starting 3 days before surgery. MCAo increased mean arterial
blood pressure for a prolonged time (MAP, A) and reduced heart rate for the first three days
(HR, B). Activity was reduced in both groups compared to baseline but did not differ between
groups for the first two weeks. However, MCAo mice showed a marked overactivity starting
2 weeks after stroke onset. (C, measured in arbitrary units). Data are from 2 independent
experiments with n = 14 (baseline) to n = 7 (d14) animals and presented as mean +/- SD, *
indicates p < 0.05 in Mann-Whitney-U test in closed testing procedure.

increased during the first days after experimental stroke. Baroreflex sensitivity reflects the
ability of the body to adapt the heart rate to changes of blood pressure. Response to blood
pressure changes were delayed upwards (BRS up, A) as well as downwards (BRS down, B).
Data from 2 independent experiments with n = 14 (baseline) to n = 7 (d14) animals are
shown; * indicates p < 0.05 in Mann-Whitney-U test in closed testing procedure.

Supplementary Figure III Vagotomy five days prior to stroke did not affect stroke volume
and heart rate significantly. Histological assessment of infarct volume (direct measurement of
infracted area) was performed from fresh-frozen brains (p = 0.21 in Kruskall-Wallis-Test)
(A). In a separate experiment, vagotomy five days before stroke onset did not affect heart rate
(measured by pulseoximetry) two days after MCAo significantly (mean +/- SD, n = 14) as
compared to sham vagotomy (B).

Supplementary Figure IV Vagotomy improves ex vivo cytokine release by lung cells
following stroke. Vagotomy (+) or sham vagotomy (Sham) was performed 5d before MCAo,
non-vagotomzied animals (-) served as controls. Lung cells (2x106/ml) were isolated on day 1
after MCAo or Sham surgery and stimulated ex vivo for 12h with Pam3CSK4. Vagotomy
significantly increased TLR-induced IL-6 (A) and TNF-a (B) production after MCAo. Again,
treatment of animals with nicotine in drinking water reversed the beneficial effect of
vagotomy on ex vivo TLR-induced cytokine release. Bar graphs show mean +/- SD; n= 1 - 9
mice per group; one way ANOVA with Dunnett’s posthoc using vagotomy MCAo without
Nicotine as group of comparison. * indicates p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001. Pooled
