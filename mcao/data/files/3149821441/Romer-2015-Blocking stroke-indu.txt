Stroke-induced immunodepression (SIDS) is an essential cause of poststroke infections. Pharmacological inhibition of SIDS appears
promising in preventing life-threatening infections in stroke patients. However, SIDS might represent an adaptive mechanism preventing autoreactive immune responses after stroke. To address this, we used myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) T-cell receptor
transgenic (2D2) mice where ⬎80% of peripheral CD4 ⫹ T cells express a functional receptor for MOG. We investigated in a murine model
of middle cerebral artery occlusion the effect of blocking SIDS by inhibiting body’s main stress axes, the sympathetic nervous system
(SNS) with propranolol and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) with mifepristone. Blockade of both stress axes robustly
reduced infarct volumes, decreased infection rate, and increased long-term survival of 2D2 and C57BL/6J wild-type mice. Despite these
protective effects, blockade of SIDS increased CNS antigen-specific Type1 T helper cell (Th1) responses in the brains of 2D2 mice 14 d after
middle cerebral artery occlusion. One month after experimental stroke, 2D2 mice developed signs of polyradiculitis, which were diminished by SIDS blockade. Adoptive transfer of CD4 ⫹ T cells, isolated from 2D2 mice, into lymphocyte-deficient Rag-1KO mice did not
reveal differences between SIDS blockade and vehicle treatment in functional long-term outcome after stroke. In conclusion, inhibiting
SIDS by pharmacological blockade of body’s stress axes increases autoreactive CNS antigen-specific T-cell responses in the brain but does
not worsen functional long-term outcome after experimental stroke, even in a mouse model where CNS antigen-specific autoreactive
T-cell responses are boosted.

Introduction
Despite stroke being one of the major and increasing burdens to
global health (Global Burden of Disease Study, 2012), therapeutic
interventions in cerebral ischemia continue to be a challenge.
Today, thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator is the only
approved causal treatment but due to a narrow time window of
3 h (4.5 h in European countries), can only be applied in 1%–
8.5% of patients (Millan and Davalos, 2006). In the acute course

of the disease, stroke patients often develop complications (Kumar et al., 2010), such as pneumonia (Emsley and Hopkins,
2008), increasing morbidity and mortality (Katzan et al., 2003;
Finlayson et al., 2011; Koennecke et al., 2011; Westendorp et al.,
2011; Rocco et al., 2013). Susceptibility to infection after stroke is
facilitated by systemic immunodepression, described as strokeinduced immunodeficiency syndrome (SIDS) (Prass et al., 2003;
Meisel et al., 2005; Chamorro et al., 2012). This crosstalk between the
CNS and immune system is mediated by sympathetic nervous system (SNS), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), and vagus
nerve (Tracey, 2002; Meisel et al., 2005; Chamorro et al., 2007).
Recently, immunomodulatory therapies targeting SIDS have
been identified to prevent harmful poststroke infections (Meisel
and Meisel, 2008). However, immunodepression after acute CNS
injury may represent an adaptive response limiting tissue damage
and preventing detrimental immune responses against CNS antigens (Meisel and Meisel, 2011). Thus, stimulating immune system after stroke might boost inflammation in the ischemic brain,
worsening functional outcome.
CNS trauma has been associated with increased autoreactivity
for ⬎80 years (Rivers et al., 1933). Disruption of the blood– brain

barrier and damage to brain parenchyma during stroke deliberates myelin and exposes brain antigens to peripheral immune
cells (Wang et al., 1992; Kuchroo et al., 2002). The autonomic
nervous system mitigates inflammation by reducing proinflammatory cytokine (IL-12, TNF-␣, IFN-␥) production, dampening
innate and adaptive immune responses and immune memory
(Livnat et al., 1985; Whalen and Bankhurst, 1990; Tuosto et al.,
1994; Sanders et al., 1997; Woiciechowsky et al., 1999; Vega et al.,
2003; Meisel et al., 2005). In particular, SNS and HPA regulate
adaptive immunity and might therefore mitigate detrimental autoimmune responses mediated by Th1 and Th17 cells (Ando et
al., 1989; Cua et al., 2003; Langrish et al., 2005).
Only a few pioneering experimental studies have addressed
autoreactive immune responses and long-term consequences after stroke (Gee et al., 2008; Gee et al., 2009). One of the likely
targets for CNS antigen-specific autoreactivity is myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) in the outer layer of myelin
(Brunner et al., 1989) capable of inducing pathogenic B- and
T-cell responses with demyelination (Genain et al., 1996).
Here, we hypothesized that blocking SIDS enhances CNS
antigen-specific autoreactivity and worsens functional outcome
in a murine model of middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAo). We used 2D2 mice in which the majority of peripheral CD4 ⫹ T cells express functional receptor for MOG (Bettelli et al., 2003) and prevented SIDS by blocking SNS and
HPA mediated SIDS simultaneously with ␤-blocker propranolol and anti-glucocorticoid mifepristone (modified from
Prass et al., 2003).

Materials and Methods
Animals and housing. Female C57BL/6J (Charles River Laboratories;
RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664), 2D2 T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice
(strain name: C57BL/6-Tg(Tcra2D2,Tcrb2D2)1Kuch/J; stock number
006912; The Jackson Laboratory; RRID:IMSR_JAX:006912), and
gender-mixed Rag-1KO mice (strain name: B6.129S7-Rag1tm1Mom/J;
stock number 002216; The Jackson Laboratory; RRID:IMSR_JAX:
002096) were used in the study. Mice were 9 –16 weeks old when entering
the study. Animal division into groups was randomized, and experiments were performed in a blinded manner. Mice were housed in Charité
animal facility with a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on from 7:00 until
19:00). Cages were lined with chip bedding, enriched with a mouse tunnel and igloo (Plexx BV). Mice had ad libitum access to food (standard
chow) and water (where study design indicates, water was replaced with
an antibiotic solution). All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the European Community Council Directives 86/609/EEC
and German national laws and approved by local authority (Landesamt
für Gesundheit und Soziales, Berlin, Germany).
Drug administration. Preventive antibiotic (enrofloxacin; Baytril
2.5%) was administered to minimize interdependencies between infection and outcome parameters (Engel and Meisel, 2010; Hetze et al.,
2013). Enrofloxacin was diluted in drinking water (0.35 mg/ml) and
provided 24 h before MCAo surgery until 7 d after MCAo. Mice received
additional 10 mg/kg of enrofloxacin intraperitoneally once a day for the
first 3 d after MCAo. SNS and HPA (SNS/HPA) were blocked with propranolol and mifepristone, respectively (both from Sigma-Aldrich).
Original injection scheme, drug preparation, and dosage for single treatments (Prass et al., 2003) were optimized for the current experiment.
Mifepristone was dissolved in 100% ethanol (Rotipuran, Carl Roth) at 30
mg/ml on a heated water bath and diluted in sesame oil (Fluca Analytical,
Sigma-Aldrich) until final concentration of 3 mg/ml. Mifepristone was
injected intraperitoneally (20 mg/kg) 24 and 5 h before MCAo as well as
at reperfusion (60 min after MCAo). Propranolol was dissolved in 0.9%
NaCl (Fresenius Kabi Deutschland) at 3 mg/ml and administered intraperitoneally (30 mg/kg) at MCAo, 4 and 8 h after MCAo (see Fig. 1A).
The vehicle group received diluents without active substance according
to the same injection scheme.

Animal model of stroke. MCAo was performed according to the standard operating procedures of the laboratory (Dirnagl, 2012). In brief,
anesthesia was induced with 2.5% isoflurane (Forene, Abbott) in 1/2
mixture of O2/N2O and maintained at 1.0%–1.5% isoflurane. Siliconrubber-coated monofilament with a diameter of 0.19 ⫾ 0.01 mm (Doccol) was introduced into the common carotid artery, advanced along the
internal carotid artery to the origin of the MCA, and left there for 60 min
until reperfusion. Body temperature was maintained with a heating pad.
A drop of 2% lidocaine gel was applied to the wound for pain relief.
Success of MCAo was verified applying the modified Bederson score
(Bederson et al., 1986). After surgery, animals were allowed to recover in
a heated cage before returning to home cages. Soft pellet food was provided postoperatively for 3 d.
Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) measurement with MRI. As soon as the filament entered the origin of MCA,
the head of the mouse was fixed using a stereotactic frame in magnet
bore. Anesthesia was maintained at 0.8%–1.0% isoflurane in 1/2 mixture
of O2/N2O. Body temperature was maintained at physiological range
with a heated water jacket. During scan time, rectal temperature, electrocardiogram, and respiration rate were monitored with Small Animal
Monitoring and Gating System (model 1025; SA Instruments; RRID:
SciRes_000157). 1H (300 MHz) mouse head surface radiofrequency coil
was used as a receiver and a 72 mm linear volume resonator for transmission. Flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR)-MRI and
DWI were performed on a 7T Bruker PharmaScan 70/16 magnet using
Bruker Paravision 4.0 software (both from Bruker, software RRID:SciRes_000158) as described in detail elsewhere (Leithner et al., 2008).
Briefly, pilot images were collected using a Fast Low Angle Shot sequence
(TE 5 ms, TR 307.7 ms, FOV 25 mm, a total of 27 slices with a thickness
of 600 ␮m in three views, 128 ⫻ 128 in plane resolution) to select an area
between the olfactory bulb and the cerebellum. FAIR-MRI images were
collected with a spin echo planar imaging (TE 42.55 ms, TR 9122.7 ms,
FOV 20 mm, imaging slice thickness 2 mm, 64 ⫻ 64 in plane resolution,
inversion slab thickness 6 mm, inversion recovery time 15.55 ms, increment of inversion recovery time 800 ms). Together, three slices 2 mm
apart were selected; and for each slice, two series of 11 images (alternating
slice selective inversion and slice nonselective inversion) were collected
and hemispherical CBF calculated (Leithner et al., 2010). FAIR-MRI was
followed by DWI using spin echo-echo planar imaging sequence (TE
40.93 ms, TR 3000 ms, FOV 20 mm, imaging slice thickness and interslice
distance 1 mm, 128 ⫻ 128 in plane resolution, total of 10 slices and 6
averages). FAIR-MRI and DWI were repeated 3 h after MCAo.
Hemispheric CBF was calculated from FAIR-MRI data as described
previously (Leithner et al., 2008; Royl et al., 2009) using custom script
routines based on MATLAB (The MathWorks; RRID:nlx_153890).
From DWI imaging, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were
calculated. Lesions visible in the ADC images were delineated with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health; RRID:nif-0000-30467) and lesion
volumes calculated by multiplying with voxel size.
T2-weighted imaging for infarct volume determination. For quantification of ischemic lesion, animals were subjected to MRI 24 h, 48 h, or 7 d
after the MCAo surgery. Anesthesia was applied and physiological characteristics monitored as described above. T2-weighted images were acquired with a 7T Bruker PharmaScan 70/16 magnet, 20 mm quadratum
volume resonator radiofrequency coil, and Bruker Paravision 4.0 software (Bruker) using Rapid Acquisition with Relaxation Enhancement
(RARE) sequence (TE 36 ms, TR 4200 ms, FOV 28 mm, 20 slices with a
thickness of 500 ␮m and interslice distance 500 ␮m, 256 ⫻ 256 in plane
resolution). Axial slices covered the distance between the olfactory bulb
and the cerebellum. Acquired images were analyzed semiautomatically
with Mayo Clinic Analyze software version 5.0 (Biomedical Imaging Resource, Analyze Direct, Analyze Software System; RRID:nif-000000263). The difference between hemispheric volumes (excluding the
lesion) was divided with the volume of ipsilateral hemisphere and converted into percentage to obtain edema-corrected infarct volumes.
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and microbiology. Three days after
MCAo, mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of
midazolam (5.0 mg/kg; Roche Pharma AG) and medetomidin (0.5 mg/
kg; Orion Pharma) and intubated with a 22 G venous catheter (BD Bio-

Dual blockade of stress axes with propranolol and mifepristone resulted in significantly smaller infarct volumes compared
with vehicle treatment (Fig. 2A). Approximately three times
smaller infarct volumes were sustained for at least 1 week after
stroke onset (measurements were performed at 24 h, 48 h, and 7 d
after MCAo). Combined treatment effect of propranolol and
mifepristone is therefore sustained and not explained by mere
delayed infarct volume maturation.
To exclude mouse strain-specific effects, we next investigated
the effect of stress axes blockade on infarct volume in wild-type
C57BL/6J mice. In accordance with the data from 2D2 mice,
SNS/HPA blockade resulted in a robust reduction of infarct volumes (Fig. 2B).
Ischemic lesions in vehicle-treated mice affected striatum,
hippocampus, and cortex. Lesions in mice with SNS/HPA blockade involved the cortex only rarely. Another difference between
the groups was the uniformly large ischemic lesion in the vehicle
group compared with the combination of small focal lesions in
mice with SNS/HPA blockade (Fig. 2C,D).
The dynamic changes in ischemic lesion were investigated in
surviving wild-type C57BL/6J (Fig. 2 E, G) and 2D2 (Fig. 2 F, H )
mice 24 h and 7 d after MCAo. In surviving animals, the ischemic
lesions tended to be smaller in C57BL/6J mice compared with

2D2 mice from both vehicle and SNS/HPA block groups (Fig.
2E–H ). However, average reduction in ischemic lesion size
within 7 d after MCAo was similar between C57BL/6J (⫺4.8 ⫾
6.3%) and 2D2 (⫺4.1 ⫾ 7.0%) mice from vehicle as well as from
SNS/HPA block group (C57BL/6J, ⫺3.1 ⫾ 1.4%; 2D2, ⫺3.6 ⫾
3.4%).
Reduction of infarct volume by SIDS blockade was not due to
altered CBF
The most straightforward cause for reduced infarct size is increased CBF because it relates inversely with lesion size after cerebral ischemia (Dalkara et al., 1994). To investigate whether the
observed infarct volume reduction was due to altered CBF by
SNS/HPA blockade, we performed FAIR-MRI combined with
DWI in 2D2 and C57BL/6J mice immediately after filament insertion to the MCA and again 3 h after MCAo surgery (Fig. 3).
DWI lesions did not differ significantly between the groups (Fig.
3A). During cerebral ischemia sustained by MCAo, a large lesion
on ADC map was observed ipsilaterally that shrank 2 h after
reperfusion. The size of this lesion did not differ between
treatment groups (Fig. 3A). Hemispheric CBF was greatly reduced ipsilateral to MCAo in all groups but was not affected by
stress blockade either 0 h or 3 h after stroke onset (Fig. 3 B, C).

Differences between the CBF and its dynamics within the 3 h

Blocking stress axes improved long-term survival and
temperature maintenance of mice
In addition to decreasing infarct volume, propranolol and mifepristone treatment improved survival of 2D2 mice until the end
of the observation period 30 d after MCAo (Fig. 4A). Compared
with only 52% of mice surviving in the vehicle group, the longterm survival of mice with SNS/HPA blockade was 73%.
Although mice from the SNS/HPA block group did not differ
statistically from vehicle-treated mice in terms of general health
score (Fig. 4B) and had only minor differences in body weight
(Fig. 4D), they were better at maintenance of body temperature
(Fig. 4C).
In a post hoc analysis of vehicle-treated 2D2 mice, we compared smaller (⬍20%; N ⫽ 14) with larger edema-corrected infarct volumes (⬎20%; N ⫽ 39). Survival of mice with smaller
lesions over the 30 d-follow-up after stroke was better (86%)

Blocking stress axes promoted recovery from infections
Many hypothermic mice in the vehicle group died 4 d after
MCAo (Fig. 4A), reminiscent of severe poststroke infections,
such as bacterial pneumonia (Prass et al., 2003; Meisel et al.,
2004). To verify this, 2D2 mice (vehicle, N ⫽ 11, SNS/HPA block,

Blocking SIDS increased the CNS antigen-specific T-cell
response in ischemic brain 14 d after MCAo
Infiltration of CD4 ⫹ T cells into ischemic brain peaks 14 d after
MCAo (Stubbe et al., 2013). Hence, we chose this time point to
follow immune cell infiltration and CNS antigen-specific T-cell
responses to investigate whether inhibition of SIDS by SNS/HPA
blockade affects CNS-directed autoreactivity in ischemic brain.
The average number of ipsilateral and contralateral hemisphereinfiltrating MNCs 14 d after MCAo was similar in the vehicle and
SNS/HPA blockade group of 2D2 mice (Fig. 5A).
To investigate the CNS antigen-specific autoreactivity of
brain-infiltrating MNCs, we performed an Elispot assay to quantify the frequency of pMOG35–55-specific T cells and investigate
their cytokine profile. SNS/HPA blockade increased the frequency of MNCs responding to pMOG35–55 with IFN-␥ secretion
from 598 per 3.25 ⫻ 10 5 total brain MNCs in vehicle-treated
mice to 1122 per 3.25 ⫻ 10 5 of total brain MNCs (Fig. 5B).
Despite similar numbers of MNCs infiltrating ischemic brain after MCAo, a higher number of total brain MNCs responded to
pMOG35–55 stimulation with IFN-␥ production in SNS/HPA
blockade compared with the vehicle group of 2D2 mice (Fig. 5).
These findings support our hypothesis that inhibiting SIDS by
SNS/HPA blockade increases CNS antigen-specific Th1 cell response of brain-infiltrating MNCs. When blocking only the SNS
but not the HPA axis, the difference in the frequency of MOGspecific autoreactive Th1 cells among ipsilateral hemisphereinfiltrating MNCs became smaller between the SNS block (360
per 1.75 ⫻ 10 5 ipsilateral hemisphere brain MNCs) and the vehicle group (220 per 1.75 ⫻ 10 5 ipsilateral hemisphere brain
MNCs) (Fig. 5C), suggesting an additive function of the SNS and
the HPA axis in preventing the autoreactive T-cell responses after
acute brain injury. We measured multiple cytokines (IL-4, IL-10,
IL-17, IFN-␥, TGF-␤1) from ex vivo MOG stimulated braininfiltrating cells by multiplex immunoassay and ELISA. Corroborating our data from Elispot analysis, we observed an
upregulation of IFN-␥ production in the SNS/HPA blocked
group compared with the vehicle group. In addition to autoreactive Th1 responses, we analyzed the production of multiple cytokines, including regulatory cytokines, TGF-␤1, and IL-10, upon
MOG stimulation in brain MNCs of 2D2 mice 14 d after MCAo
using ELISA. Whereas IL-10 production was reduced in SNS/
HPA blockade compared with vehicle groups of mice, TGF-␤1
levels upon MOG stimulation were increased in the SNS/HPA
block group of mice (Fig. 5E).
Next, we questioned whether increase in autoreactive T-cell
responses after SIDS blockade in stroke animals was confined to
the CNS. For this, we harvested splenocytes 14 d after MCAo and
quantified the number of IFN-␥ (Th1 cell signature cytokine),
IL-4 (Th2 cell signature cytokine), and IL-17 (Th17 cell signature
cytokine) secreting cells after pMOG35–55 stimulation by Elispot
assay and regulatory-type cytokine production by ELISA. Blocking SIDS with propranolol and mifepristone did not change the
numbers of Th1, Th2, or Th17 effector cytokine-producing cells
or the amount of TGF-␤1 and IL-10 secretion by pMOG35–55stimulated splenocytes significantly (Fig. 5 D, F ). Ratios between

Blocking SIDS did not augment EAE-like symptoms and
locomotor deficits
We next investigated whether increased autoreactive immune
responses in ischemic brain after blocking SIDS were associated
with worse functional outcome. Mice recover from sensorimotor
deficits typically within 1 week after MCAo. Whereas stroke affects immediately and predominantly the contralateral side and
in particular the contralateral forepaw, we observed a progressive
and ascending paralysis affecting the tail and limbs of both sides
symmetrically beginning from 1 week after MCAo. This phenotype observed in 2D2 mice is reminiscent of EAE. Therefore, we
applied the modified EAE score starting assessment from day 7
after MCAo. Interestingly, EAE score of 2D2 mice 30 d after
MCAo correlated positively with infarct volume 24 h after MCAo
among vehicle-treated (N ⫽ 11, Spearman-Rho correlation coefficient 0.665, p ⫽ 0.026) but not mifepristone/propranolol-

treated mice (N ⫽ 18, Spearman ␳ correlation coefficient ⫽
0.089, p ⫽ 0.726). These findings suggest that EAE-like phenotype depends on ischemic lesion size and SIDS. Following experimental stroke, the majority of 2D2 mice from vehicle (87%) and
SNS/HPA block groups (91%) developed EAE-like symptoms
within the 30 d observation period. Median disease onset in mice
after SNS/HPA blockade on day 14 was compared with day 9 in
the vehicle group (Fig. 6). Additionally to applying modified EAE
score, gait parameters were assessed using the semiautomated
CatWalk gait analysis system.
Previously, we have identified sensitive gait parameters typically affected by stroke in male C57BL/6J mice (Hetze et al.,
2012). Here, stroke mice from vehicle and SNS/HPA block
groups displayed typical alterations in spatial and kinetic characteristics of gait without significant differences between the groups
(Table 1).
Together, SIDS blockade boosted CNS antigen-specific immune response in the brain but, compared with vehicle treatment, did not worsen functional long-term outcome measured
by modified EAE score or gait analysis.
Blocking SIDS reduced immune cell infiltration into spinal
nerve roots
In the long-term course and beyond the initial hemiparesis after
experimental stroke, 2D2 mice suffered from paralysis affecting
hindpaws and tail. Hence, we hypothesized myelitis caused by
CNS antigen-specific immune cell infiltration into the spinal
cord. To investigate this phenomenon, we performed immuno-

that blockade of SIDS influences long-term
outcome of stroke detrimentally. In an attempt to prove whether autoreactive immune response has detrimental effects on
long-term outcome after stroke, we needed
to exclude the bias introduced by the protective effect of stress blockade with propranolol and mifepristone on infarct volume.

demonstrated that blocking SNS not only
blocks stroke-induced immunodepression but also prevents poststroke infections
(Prass et al., 2003, 2006). Finally, we have
identified spontaneous poststroke infections as a contributing factor for CNS
antigen-specific autoreactive immune responses in the mouse MCAo model (Klehmet et al., unpublished). Thus, poststroke
infection is an interfering factor for investigations on CNS antigen-specific
autoreactive immune responses in stroke.
Therefore, we performed all experiments
under preventive antibiotic treatment
with enrofloxacin. We cannot exclude direct immunomodulatory effects by enrofloxacin. However, these effects would
rather underestimate the observed CNS
antigen-specific autoreactive immune responses because fluoroquinolones might exert anti-inflammatory effects (Dalhoff and
Shalit, 2003), and our results suggest that
coping with infections is more efficient
when SIDS is blocked.
In line with previous studies on laboratory rodents (Vandeputte et al., 2010;
Hetze et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013), mice
displayed typical stroke-induced alterations in gait: asymmetry, increased stand
duration and base of support, shorter
stride lengths, reduced maximal contact
area, and normalized swing speed. Additionally, with a median onset 9 –14 d after
stroke, 2D2 mice developed an EAE-like
phenotype. MOG-specific T cells, in particular CD4 ⫹ Th1 and Th17 cells, can mediate EAE (Linington et al., 1993; Genain

modulatory properties, the smaller infarct volumes might be due
to effects on early infiltrating immune cells and brain resident
cells. Furthermore, different subsets of lymphocytes can exert
detrimental as well as protective functions in cerebral ischemia
(Yilmaz et al., 2006; Hurn et al., 2007; Liesz et al., 2009, 2011;
Shichita et al., 2009; Kleinschnitz et al., 2010, 2013). However,
because stress blockade prevented the development of large infarcts very early after stroke onset, immune-mediated mechanisms as primary sources for this are unlikely. Mechanistically,
we excluded delayed infarct maturation, which has been observed
in experimental stroke when studying mechanisms of inflammation and apoptosis (Du et al., 1996; Becker et al., 1997; Frenkel et
al., 2003). CBF has been shown to inversely correlate with infarct
volume (Dalkara et al., 1994). Propranolol might affect CBF
(Edvinsson et al., 1979; Ley et al., 2009). CBF, measured by
FAIR-MRI, was not altered by SNS/HPA blockade. However, we
cannot exclude that mild but prolonged CBF elevations, which
are below the detection threshold of FAIR-MRI (Leithner et al.,
2008), contribute to the neuroprotective mechanism of SNS/HPA
blockade. Further possibilities might include induction of Heat
shock protein 72 by ␤2-adrenoreceptor antagonist (Han et al., 2009)
and antioxidant properties of mifepristone (Parthasarathy et al.,
1994; Roberts et al., 1996; Behl et al., 1997; Antonawich et al., 1999;
McCullers et al., 2002). Our data suggest that both mifepristone and
propranolol are required to elicit neuroprotection in the SNS/HPA
blockade group.

A limitation of our study is that we have measured CNS
antigen-specific autoreactivity only at one time point after experimental stroke. Although the Elispot is considered a very sensitive
method, this assay requires a high number of brain-infiltrating T
cells to reliably measure CNS antigen-specific T-cell responses.
Therefore, we performed Elispot experiments only at that time
point where the number of brain-infiltrating T cells was sufficiently high to receive robust data. In the MCAo model, T-cell
infiltration into the brain parenchyma is highest at day 14 and day
30 but relatively low at day 7 after stroke onset (Stubbe et al.,
2013). Moreover, we considered this time window to be sufficient
for MOG-specific CD4 ⫹ T cells to get primed (Janeway, 1989)
and to differentiate into effector/memory T cells (Jäger et al.,
2009). Another limitation of our study is that the main findings
are based on investigations in 2D2 mice. Because the majority of
their CD4 ⫹ T cells carry a functional receptor for MOG, finding
on CNS antigen-specific autoreactivity is most likely an overestimation of the situation in wild-type mice. We observed, even in
wild-type C57BL/6J mice, Th1 responses against MOG in brain
infiltrating lymphocytes 14 d after MCAo. However, the frequencies were much lower compared with 2D2 mice and only observed in animals with accompanying poststroke infections
(Klehmet et al., unpublished).
The concept of SIDS has promoted the development of immunomodulatory treatment approaches for stroke (Shichita et
al., 2009, 2012; Wong et al., 2011; Chamorro et al., 2012; Kamel

7792 • J. Neurosci., May 20, 2015 • 35(20):7777–7794

and Iadecola, 2012). Modulating SIDS, however, might be a
double-edged-sword approach reducing the risk for infection at
cost of boosting detrimental autoimmune response against CNS
antigens and worsening functional long-term outcome (Meisel
and Meisel, 2011). Here we provide evidence that reversing SIDS
by blocking body’s stress axes increases autoreactive CNS
antigen-specific immune responses in the brain but does not impair long-term functional outcome in our murine model of experimental stroke compared with vehicle treatment.
