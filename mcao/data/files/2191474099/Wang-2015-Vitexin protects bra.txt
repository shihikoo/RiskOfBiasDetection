Vitexin is a major bioactive ﬂavonoid compound derived from the dried leaf of hawthorn (Crataegus pinnatiﬁda), a widely used conventional folk medicine in China. Recent studies have shown that vitexin presents
neuroprotective effects in vitro. Whether this protective effect applies to the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
(I/R) injury remains elusive. In the present study, we examined the potential neuroprotective effect of vitexin
against cerebral I/R injury and underlying mechanisms. A focal cerebral I/R model in male Kunming mice was
induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h followed by reperfusion for 22 h. The neurological
function and infarct volume were assessed by using Long’s ﬁve-point scale system and triphenyl-tetrazolium
chloride (TTC) staining technique, respectively. Neuronal damage was evaluated by histological staining.
Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38 phosphorylation, and apoptosis were measured via Western blot at 24 h after reperfusion. As a result, systemic vitexin
treatment signiﬁcantly reduced neurological deﬁcit, cerebral infarct volume and neuronal damage when
compared with the I/R group. Western blot analyses revealed that vitexin markedly upregulated p-ERK1/2
and downregulated p-JNK and p-p38. Meanwhile, vitexin increased Bcl-2 expression and suppressed the
overexpression of Bax in the I/R injury mice. In conclusion, the results indicate that vitexin protects brain
against cerebral I/R injury, and this effect may be regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and
apoptosis signaling pathways.

most common type of stroke (Liu et al. 2011). With an unprecedented
rapid global population aging, the incidence, mortality, and disability rates of ischemic stroke are gradually elevating to the top among
all the diseases, especially in developing countries. Prolonged cerebral ischemia leads to irreversible neuronal death, and reperfusion is
essential to rescue neurons from irreversible necrosis. Although the
current clinical treatment for ischemic stroke is to restore the blood
ﬂow to the affected area through thrombolytic therapy, the reperfusion injury and the narrow time window for thrombolysis restricts
its application for the majority of stroke patients (Jivan et al. 2013).
Past decades have witnessed a tremendous advance in understanding the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury
(Jivan et al. 2013; Lo et al. 2003), however, therapeutic options for
acute cerebral I/R injury are still limited, suggesting that novel drug
candidates should be explored.
Vitexin (apigenin-8-C-β -d-glucopyranoside) is a ﬂavonoid compound present in the dried leaf of hawthorn (crataegus pinnatiﬁda), a conventional folk medicine for health care in China (Wu
et al. 2014). (Prabhakar et al. 1981) ﬁrst reported that vitexin has

anti-hypertensive and anti-inﬂammatory effects. Recently, accumulating evidence demonstrates that vitexin can protect cardiac hypertrophy (Lu et al. 2013), platelet aggregation and vascular smooth
muscle contractility (Aﬁﬁ and Abu-Dahab 2012). Our previous studies have demonstrated that vitexin can protect the heart against
myocardial I/R injury via regulating the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and inhibiting cardiomyocyte inﬂammation and apoptosis (Dong et al. 2011, 2013). The dysregulation of apoptosis and MAPK including extracellular signal-regulated
kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38
signaling pathways are involved in neuronal dysfunction and death
under cerebral I/R (Broughton et al. 2009; Hu et al. 2012). A more
recent study reveals that vitexin has a neuroprotective effect against
NMDA-induced neuronal apoptosis by regulating a balance between
Bcl-2 and Bax expression in vitro (Yang et al. 2014a) and has antidepressant-like effects in mice (Can et al. 2013). Although there are
a number of studies reported the multifaceted pharmacological activities of vitexin, its neuronal protective effect against cerebral I/R
injury remains elusive.
In the present study we aimed to explore the potential neuroprotective effect of vitexin on cerebral I/R injury and its underlying
mechanisms. We predicted that vitexin exhibited a signiﬁcant neuroprotective effect through regulating MAPK and apoptosis signaling
pathways. Breviscapine (PubChem CID: 185617; molecular formula:
C21 H18 O12 ) injection is a standard medication in China for patients
with I/R injury and its therapeutic effect has also been demonstrated
in rodents (Wang et al. 2010; Yiming et al. 2008). Breviscapine is a
common positive control for preclinical studies. Accordingly, breviscapine was used as a positive control in this study.
Materials and methods

Induction of focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury
Focal cerebral I/R injury mouse model was developed by the intraluminal ﬁlament method as described previously (Hata et al. 1998;
Ruan et al. 2013) with minor modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, mice were anesthetized and secured in a supine position. After a lateral neck incision,
the right common carotid artery and external carotid artery were
carefully exposed and ligated. A microvascular clip was temporarily
applied to the internal carotid artery before a paraﬃn-coated nylon monoﬁlament suture with a rounded tip was inserted from the
common carotid artery to the internal carotid artery through a small
incision in the common carotid artery. After the internal carotid artery
clamp was removed, the suture was advanced 9 mm from the carotid
bifurcation to occlude the middle cerebral artery. After 2 h occlusion,
the suture was withdrawn to allow blood reperfusion. During the
surgery, the body core temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C.
Sham-operated mice received the same surgical procedure without
an occlusion of the middle cerebral artery.
Regarding previous reports (Can et al. 2013; Demir Ozkay and Can
2013) and our pilot study, we found that vitexin elicited maximal
effect at 15 mg/kg. Seventy-eight mice were divided into six groups
randomly (13 mice in each group): sham-operated control (sham),
ischemia/reperfusion group (I/R), I/R mice treated with breviscapine injection at a dose of 15.00 mg/kg (BRE), and I/R mice treated
with vitexin at low (3.25 mg/kg), medium (7.50 mg/kg) and high
(15.00 mg/kg) doses. Breviscapine and vitexin in saline were administered via tail vein beginning at reperfusion. The sham group and I/R
group received equal volumes of saline treatment.
Neurological function assessment
Neurological function assessment was performed at 24 h after
I/R as described previously on a ﬁve-point scale system as follows:
0, no neurological deﬁcit; 1, failure to extend left forepaw fully; 2,
circling to contralateral side; 3, falling towards contralateral side;
4, no spontaneous walking with a depressed level of consciousness
(Longa et al. 1989).

Measurement of cerebral infarct volume
Brains were sliced coronally into 2 mm-thick slices and stained
with 1% TTC for 15 min at 37 °C and then ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde.
TTC stains viable brain tissue deep red but infarcted tissues keep
the original pale color. Infarct volume and total brain volume were
quantiﬁed with an Image J analysis system. Cerebral infarct volumes
were expressed as the percentage of infarcted tissue relative to total
brain tissue.
Hematoxylin–eosin staining
Mice were deeply anesthetized and perfused transcardially with
saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffered
saline (PBS, pH 7.4, 4 °C). The brains were immediately removed and
post-ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for another 24 h before processing paraﬃn embedding and sectioning at 5 μm-thick on a rotary
microtome. All slices were stained with hematoxylin–eosin (HE) for
histological analysis. There were four mice in each group.
Western blot
Twenty-four hours after cerebral I/R, brain tissues obtained from
the cortex and hippocampus of ischemic cerebral hemisphere (right
side) were homogenized in ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer. The supernatant
was collected as total proteins and protein concentration of each supernatant sample was determined using a BCA protein assay kit. Equal
amounts of protein samples (30 μg) were separated by 12% SDSpolyacrylamide gel and transferred on to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
(PVDF) membranes. After blocking with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, the
membranes were loaded with protein samples and were incubated
with primary antibodies (1:1000 dilution) at 4 °C overnight, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
(goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit). Bands were detected by an
enhanced chemiluminescent substrate and visualized by a Bioshine
ChemiQ4600 imaging system (Shanghai Bioshine Scientiﬁc instrument Co., Ltd). Densitometry values were normalized to β -actin immunoreactivity in the same lane to correct for any loading and transfer
differences among samples with Image J software, n = 3 in each group.
All data were triplicated in different times and different animals.
Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± S.E.M. Statistical signiﬁcance between treatment and vitexin doses was determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). If signiﬁcance was found, post hoc Tukey’s
multiple comparison was used. For neurological deﬁcit, Kruskal–
Wallis one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons
and Mann–Whitney U test were used for comparisons between two
groups. P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
Results
Vitexin reduced cerebral infarct volume and neurological deﬁcit
After TTC staining, normal tissue presented deep red while the
infarct area was pale gray (Fig. 2A). No infarction was observed in
the sham group. The cerebral I/R caused a signiﬁcant increase in infarct volume and drug treatment signiﬁcantly altered infarct volume
(Fig. 2B, F4,25 = 48.3, P < 0.01). The percentage of cerebral infarct
volume of I/R alone group, low, medium and high dose vitexin groups
was 27.97 ± 1.36%, 24.46 ± 2.88%, 12.21 ± 1.17% and 3.75 ± 0.77%, respectively. As compared to the I/R alone group, breviscapine, 7.50 and
15.00 mg/kg vitexin signiﬁcantly reduced the cerebral infarct volume
(Ps < 0.01). There was no signiﬁcant difference between breviscapine,
7.50 and 15.00 mg/kg vitexin groups.

Vitexin treatment ameliorated neurological deﬁcits. All mice except sham ones presented neurological deﬁcits (Fig. 2C). The score of
I/R group was 2.83 ± 0.17. Scores were reduced by treatment with
breviscapine (1.33 ± 0.21, P < 0.01), medium vitexin (1.67 ± 0.21,
P < 0.01), or high vitexin (1.16 ± 0.17, P < 0.01). Vitexin at 3.25 mg/kg
did not affect the neurological deﬁcit compared to I/R alone group.
Vitexin attenuated neuronal damage
Vitexin treatment attenuated cortical (Fig. 3A) and hippocampal
CA1 (Fig. 3B) histopathological damage. Hippocampal CA1 neurons in
I/R group exhibited pyknosis and anachromasis of nucleus as well as
shrunken cell bodies. Breviscapine and vitexin (7.50 and 15.00 mg/kg)
markedly attenuated the neuronal damages. The cortical cellular morphology exhibited normally in sham group. There were deformation
and swelling of nerve cells, interstitial edema, and tissue damage in I/R
group. The neurons were sparse and showed disordered structures.
Moreover, a large number of neurons lost structural integrity with
obvious karyopyknosis and disintegration of nucleoli. Breviscapine
and vitexin (7.50 and 15.00 mg/kg) alleviated neuronal damages.
Vitexin increases p-ERK1/2 accumulation and decreases p-JNK
and p-p38 accumulation in cortex and hippocampus
Vitexin and breviscapine treatment signiﬁcantly altered protein expression in cortex and hippocampus (Ps < 0.01). In cortex,
medium and high vitexin groups had signiﬁcantly increased p-ERK1/2

382

Medium and high vitexin groups presented a signiﬁcant increase
in hippocampal p-ERK1/2 production compared to the I/R alone group
(Ps < 0.01). I/R injury signiﬁcantly increased the levels of p-JNK and
p-p38 compared with sham group (Ps < 0.01), which were attenuated
by breviscapine and vitexin treatment (Ps < 0.05) (Fig. 5). Vitexin at
3.25 mg/kg did not signiﬁcantly affect p-ERK1/2 level compared to
I/R alone group. Also vitexin at 3.25 and 7.5 mg/kg did not affect the
p-JNK and p-p38 levels compared to I/R alone group.
Vitexin treatment increases Bcl-2 and decreases Bax expression
in cortex and hippocampus
Breviscapine and vitexin (7.50 and 15.00 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly increased the Bcl-2 protein level in cortex and hippocampus compared
with the I/R alone group (Ps < 0.05). Meanwhile, breviscapine and
vitexin (7.50 and 15.00 mg/kg) inhibited the increase in cortical and
hippocampal Bax expression induced by I/R injury (Ps < 0.01) (Fig. 6).

production compared to the I/R alone group (Ps < 0.01). I/R injury
signiﬁcantly increased the levels of p-JNK and p-p38 compared with
sham group (Ps < 0.01), which were attenuated by breviscapine and
vitexin treatment (Ps < 0.01) (Fig. 4). Vitexin at 3.25 mg/kg did not
signiﬁcantly affect p-ERK1/2 and p-JNK levels compared to I/R alone
group. Also, vitexin at 3.25 and 7.5 mg/kg did not affect the p-p38
level compared to I/R alone group.

In this study we found that vitexin effectively reduced cerebral
infarct volume and ameliorated neurological deﬁcit and histopathological damage in a preclinical mouse MCAO model. We also found
that vitexin altered the MAPK signaling pathway by increasing ERK1/2
phosphorylation and decreasing JNK and p-38 phosphorylation in ischemic cortex and hippocampus. Additionally, vitexin inhibited apoptosis by downregulating Bax and upregulating Bcl-2 from cerebral
I/R. This study provides the evidence that vitexin protects neurons
against cerebral I/R insults and may pave a new avenue for developing a promising therapeutic compound against cerebral I/R injury.
Our ﬁndings indicate for the ﬁrst time that vitexin can effectively protect the brain against I/R injury. Stroke-related I/R injury
is a leading cause of disability and mortality across the world. Currently, except thrombolytic treatment for highly selected patients,
there is no effective treatment approved in clinic (Alexandrov et al.
2004). With a preclinical MCAO mouse model, we conﬁrmed previous
reports that I/R causes brain infarcts and impairments in neurological performance and histopathology (Khaksari et al. 2012; Yang et al.
2014b). Remarkably, vitexin attenuated the infarct volume and neurological deﬁcits in a dose-dependent manner. 15.00 mg/kg vitexin
signiﬁcantly attenuated the increase in infarct volume and neurological deﬁcits from cerebral I/R. Morphological studies further revealed

that vitexin ameliorated neuronal damage from I/R, including cell
swelling, karyopyknosis and disintegration of nucleoli. This provides
solid evidence that vitexin presents a neuroprotective effect against
cerebral I/R injury.
Vitexin presents a plethora of bioactivities that may underlie the
neuroprotective effect. MAPK signaling pathway is involved in I/R injury (Kovalska et al. 2012). We found that vitexin potentiated ERK1/2
phosphorylation and inhibited p-JNK and p-p38 over accumulation to
I/R. MAPK is a family of serine/threonine kinases that serve as signal
transduction mediators to regulate a diversity of cellular functions.
ERK1/2, c-JNK and p38 are three major components in the MAPK
pathway that function against neuronal damage and are activated
in response to cerebral I/R (Guo et al. 2012; Kovalska et al. 2012). Increases in ERK1/2 phosphorylation inhibit cerebral I/R injury, whereas
increases in JNK and p38 phosphorylation exacerbate the injury (Zhu
et al. 2014). The ERK1/2 pathway participates in cell proliferation,
and increase in neurogenesis by potentiation of ERK1/2 signaling is a
promising therapeutic approach for treating ischemic stroke. In contrast, the activation of p38 and JNK pathways facilitates neuronal

apoptosis triggered by focal ischemia (Lennmyr et al. 2003). It is
posited that a dynamic balance between ERK1/2 and p38/JNK must
exist to ﬁnely regulate cellular survival and apoptosis to adapt I/R. We
found that vitexin potentiated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and inhibited
p-JNK and p-p38 over accumulation to I/R in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that vitexin produces a neuroprotective effect via a
MAPK signaling pathway.
Cell apoptosis is a severe consequence to cerebral ischemia and
prevention of apoptosis is a critical step for clinical treatment (Ferrer
and Planas 2003). Ischemia can initiate apoptotic signaling cascades
by targeting a number of genes, in particular the members of Bcl-2
family (Broughton et al. 2009). Bcl-2 and Bax are two major modulators of apoptosis, and their relative levels determine the fate of
target cells. Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptosis protein that can prolong cell
survival. The mitochondrial pathway is initiated by release of cytochrome C. Bcl-2 resides in the outer mitochondrial membrane and
inhibits cytochrome C release. Bax resides in the cytosol but moves
to the mitochondria following death signaling, where it promotes the
release cytochrome C and activates caspase-3 and caspase cascades.

Upregulation of Bcl-2 presents a protective effect against cerebral
I/R injury (Ferrer and Planas 2003). In contrast, Bax is a pro-apoptotic
protein that reverses Bcl-2 function by serving as a Bcl-2-binding protein (Oltvai et al. 1993). In the present study, we found that vitexin
could signiﬁcantly suppress the overexpression of Bax and increase
Bcl-2 expression in ischemic brain tissue. These results indicate that
vitexin can protect neurons against cerebral ischemia-induced neuronal damage through modulating the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax.
Breviscapine (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) extracted from
Erigeron breviscapus (Vaniot) Hand.-Mazz. (http://www.theplantlist.
org) has been used in Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of
certain cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases due to its antithrombus, anti-platelet aggregation, and increase in ﬁbrinolytic activity (Wang et al. 2010). Breviscapine protects the brain against
ischemia damage by attenuating neuroapoptosis via the Nrf2/HO-1
pathway (Guo et al. 2014; Yiming et al. 2008). There are some potential advantages of vitexin over breviscapine. Erigeron breviscapus (Vaniot) Hand.-Mazz. is a wild herbal plant of Yunnan Province,
China, while Crataegus pinnatiﬁda is widely distributed in the north of
China. The enrichment of Crataegus pinnatiﬁda provides the supply of
vitexin and reduces the medical cost. There were some case reports
that breviscapine can induce allergic reaction, especially anaphylactic shock. While vitexin is a chemical with deﬁned structure and may
reduce the allergic reaction. the dried leaf of hawthorn where vitexin
comes from has been a conventional folk medicine in China for hundreds of years. Our group successfully extracted and puriﬁed vitexin,
and has ﬁnished the preclinical evaluation of vitexin and is waiting
on China FDA’s approval for clinical phase I trial.
In summary, the study demonstrates that vitexin can reduce cerebral infarct volume and ameliorated neurological deﬁcit and neuronal
damage. The mechanism of this protective effect is likely through
modulating MAPK signaling pathway and inhibition of neuronal apoptosis. To our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst to report the therapeutic
application of vitexin against cerebral I/R injury and may pave a new
way for developing a novel drug candidate against cerebral I/R injury
in stroke patients.
