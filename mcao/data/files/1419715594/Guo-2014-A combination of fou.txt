SMXZF is a combination of Rb1, Rg1, schizandrin, and
DT-13 (6:9:5:4) derived from Sheng-mai San, a widely
used Chinese traditional medicine for the treatment of
cardiovascular and cerebral diseases. The present study
explores the inhibitory effects and signaling pathways of
SMXZF on autophagy induced by cerebral ischemia–
reperfusion injury. Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to
ischemia–reperfusion insult by right middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) for 1 hr with subsequent 24 hr reperfusion. Three doses of SMXZF (4.5, 9, and 18 mg/kg) were
administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) after ischemia for 1 hr.
An autophagic inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA; 300 lg/
kg), was administered i.p. 20 min before ischemia as a
positive drug. We found that SMXZF significantly
increased cerebral blood flow and reduced the infarct volume, brain water content, and the neurological deficits in
a dose-dependent manner. Similar to the positive control,
SMXZF at 18 mg/kg also significantly inhibited autophagosome formation. Immunofluorescence staining and
Western blotting demonstrated that SMXZF could significantly decrease the expression levels of beclin1 and
microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3. SMXZF
also remarkably inhibited the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as well as
the expression of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and its
phosphorylation induced by 24 hr reperfusion. Finally, we
demonstrated that the optimal administration time of
SMXZF was at the early period of reperfusion. This study
reveals that SMXZF displays neuroprotective effect
against focal ischemia–reperfusion injury, possibly associated with autophagy inactivation through AMPK/mTOR
and JNK pathways. VC 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Stroke is one of the most common neurological disorders and is a major cause of disability and death worldwide. Nearly 87% of strokes are caused by ischemia (Shi

et al., 2009; Truong et al., 2012). To date, the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is the only therapeutic agent available for ischemic stroke treatment.
However, only small numbers of stroke patients can
recover because of its narrow administration time, the risk
of intracerebral hemorrhage, and the multiple contraindications (Adams et al., 2007; Culman et al., 2012). Over
the past decade, revealing a novel target to prevent neuronal damage has been a focus in stroke research (Ginsberg,
2008; Auriel and Bornstein, 2010). Numerous studies
have demonstrated a significant role of cellular death in
the progression of ischemic brain injury (Krmpotić et al.,
2013; Zhan et al., 2013). Generally, cellular death occurs
in three ways, necrosis, apoptosis, and autophagy. Recent
studies have shown that autophagy plays a key role in the
neural death pathway following cerebral ischemia (Xu
and Zhang, 2011; Balduini et al., 2012; Zheng et al.,
2012).

Autophagy is a highly evolutionarily conserved
intracellular process of macromolecule and organelle degradation (Mizushima and Komatsu, 2011; Xu et al.,
2012). Autophagy can regulate cell growth, survival,
death, and development. Recent evidence suggests that
autophagy is activated, with peak response at 12–24 hr, in
a live animal model following cerebral ischemia (Tian
et al., 2010). However, suitable autophagy may provide
neuroprotection, whereas excessive activation of autophagy could induce cell death. Therefore, a balanced level
of autophagy is a potential therapeutic target of stroke
treatment (Mizushima et al., 2008; Xu and Zhang, 2011;
Viscomi et al., 2012). Additionally, abundant evidence
has demonstrated that adenosine monophosphateactivated protein kinase (AMPK)-mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) C1 (Liang et al., 2007; Wang et al.,
2012), beclin 1-Bcl-2 complex (Pattingre et al., 2005;
Maiuri et al., 2010), and the expression of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK; Wei et al., 2008; Ginet et al., 2009) signaling pathways can control the activation of autophagy
in neuronal death following cerebral ischemia. Therefore,
modulating autophagy and its related pathways may be
beneficial in ischemic stroke.
Nevertheless, ischemia stroke is often caused by multiple molecular abnormalities. In this regard, the application
of combinational drugs is considered an efficient form of
therapy (Keman et al., 2010; Carey et al., 2012). Many
researchers have demonstrated that Sheng-mai San, a recipe
of traditional Chinese medicine, which is composed of
three herbs (Panax ginseng, Ophiopogon japonicus, Schisandra
chinensis), showed effectiveness in the treatment of stroke
(Ichikawa and Konishi, 2002; Wang et al., 2005; Li et al.,
2013). Previous studies have demonstrated that ginsenoside
Rb1, Rg1, schizandrin, and ruscogenin from the three
herbs of Sheng-mai San have neuroprotective effects
because of their antioxidant, antiapoptosis, and antiinflammatory actions (Cheng et al., 2008; Huang et al.,
2008; Chen et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2011; Guan et al.,
2013). DT-13, (25(R,S)-ruscogenin-1-O-[b-D- glucopyranosyl-(1!2)][b-D-xylopyranosyl-(1!3)]-b-D-fucopyranoside), a saponin with ruscogenin as the parent nucleus
also showed significant anti-inflammatory activity with low
toxicity (Ma et al., 2011; Tian et al., 2011). Previously, we
selected these four compounds and optimized their proportions in animal models and found that these four compounds combined in a certain ratio (6:9:5:4, called
SMXZF) showed neuroprotective activity comparable to
that of Sheng-mai injection, one modern preparation of
Sheng-mai San. This combination has obtained an authorized patent in China (Zhang et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2009).
However, its possible mechanisms in acting against stroke
remain unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we
explored whether SMXZF could regulate the neuronal
autophagy and its related AMPK/mTOR and JNK pathways in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model
in mice. Additionally, we also investigated the optimal
administration time of SMXZF to provide some further
pharmacological evidence for its potential application for
stroke prevention.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
C57BL/6 mice weighing 18–22 g were purchased from
the Model Animal Research Centre of Yangzhou University
(Yangzhou certificate No. SCXK 2012-0004). Prior to experiments, animals were randomized into experimental groups. All
procedures and assessments were approved by Animal Ethics
Committee of the School of Chinese Materia Medica, China
Pharmaceutical University. These experiments were carried out
in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for
the care and use of laboratory animals (NIH Publication No. 80-23,
revised 1996), and the indices were measured blind.
Focal Cerebral Ischemia and Reperfusion
C57BL/6 mice were subjected to MCAO and reperfusion as reported previously (Dittmar et al., 2003; Li et al.,
2004). Briefly, after anesthesia with 4% chloral hydrate (0.1 ml/
10 g body weight) intraperitoneally (i.p.), neck vessels were
exposed with a a midline incision, and branches of the right
external carotid artery were isolated and cauterized. A blunt-tip
6-0 nylon monofilament was inserted into the proximal external carotid artery stump and advanced 8–10 mm into the internal carotid artery to occlude the middle cerebral artery. Rectal
temperatures were carefully monitored, and temperature was
maintained with heating pad 37.5 C 6 0.5 C during surgery
and ischemia. Mice in the sham condition underwent the same
surgical procedure, but the suture was not advanced into the
internal carotid artery. A laser Doppler flowmeter (LDF;
FLPI2, Moor, England) was used to confirm the decrease of the
middle cerebral artery blood flow immediately after the occlusion to below 30% of the basic cerebral blood flow (Culman
et al., 2012). Those animals with decreased blood flow to below
30% of preischemia levels were used for further study.
Chemical Structure of the Four Compounds in SMXZF
and Experimental Protocol
SMXZF is a mixture of ginsenoside Rb1, Rg1, schizandrin, and DT-13 (6:9:5:4), whose specific chemical structures
are shown in Figure 1A. SMXZF was dissolved in ethanol and
diluted with normal saline to a final ethanol concentration of
5% (Li et al., 2012). SMXZF (4.5, 9, and 18 mg/kg) was
administered i.p. at the onset of reperfusion. 3-MA (SigmaAldrich; M9281) was dissolved in 5% ethanol and was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 300 lg/kg 20 min before the
onset of ischemia (shown in Fig. 1B). Meanwhile, 5% ethanol
in normal saline as vehicle was administered i.p. to sham and
ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) groups at a volume of 10 ml/kg.
Evaluation of Infarct Volume, Neurological Deficits,
and Brain Water Content
After 24 hr of reperfusion, mice (six animals/group) were
anesthetized with 4% choral hydrate (i.p.), the brains were dissected and sliced, and five slices of 1.5-mm thickness were sectioned and stained with 1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) for 30 min and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde.
Lesioned areas not stained red with TTC were quantitatively
analyzed in Bio-Rad Quantity One. Infarct volume was

calculated by using slice thickness and the measured areas of the
lesion. Data are expressed as a percentage of total hemispheres
(Clark et al., 1997).
The neurological deficits (six animals/group) in mice
subjected to cerebral I/R were evaluated blinded using the
scales as described by Longa et al. (1989): 0 point, mice behave
normally; 1 point, mice cannot fully stretch their left front legs;
2 points, mice turn around into a circle; 3 points, mice fall
down to the left side; 4 points, mice cannot move by themselves, losing their consciousness. Brain water contents (six animals/group) were determined 24 hr after reperfusion; infarct
brain hemispheres were quantified with an electronic scale (wet
weight), dried overnight at 105 C in a desiccating oven, and
weighed (dry weight). The total brain water was calculated as
[(wet weight 2 dry weight)/wet weight] 3 100% as described
previously (Mdzinarishvili et al., 2007).
Cerebral Blood Flow Measurement
Cerebral blood flow (CBF; 6 animals/group) was measured by using laser Doppler flowmetry. A computer-controlled
optical scanner directed a low-power laser beam over the
Journal of Neuroscience Research

exposed cortex. The scanner head was positioned in parallel to
the cerebral cortex at a distance of about 20 cm (Huang et al.,
2012). A color-coded image to denote specific relative perfusion levels was displayed on a video monitor. The images were
acquired from the onset of ischemia to reperfusion for 24 hr.
Transmission Electron Microscopic Examination
The mouse brains (three animals/group) were perfused
with 100 ml normal saline, then perfused with a fixative made
of 4% formaldehyde and 0.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/liter
phosphate buffer (PBS; pH 7.4). A coronal slice in the cortex
penumbra area approximately 1 mm thick was taken and kept
in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/liter PBS (pH 7.4) overnight
at 4 C. After rinsing with 0.1 mol/liter PBS three times, the
tissue block was postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 mol/
liter PBS for 2 hr at 4 C, dehydrated in graded ethanol, and
embedded in epoxy resin. Polymerization was performed at
80 C for 24 hr. Blocks were cut on a Reichert ultramicrotome
into ultrathin sections (60–70 nm), which were poststained
with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined under a JEM1011 electron microscopy.

Immunofluorescence Staining
Mice (three animals/group) were anesthetized with 4%
chloral hydrate and transcardially perfused with 100 ml normal
saline, followed by 100 ml PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde
(pH 7.4). Perfusion-fixed brains were postfixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, followed by 40% sucrose
dehydration. Coronal brain sections (20 lm thick) were cut on a
cryostat (CM1950; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), and the sections
were preincubated for 30 min in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS and
then incubated overnight at 4 C with the primary antibody in
3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PBS.
After rinsing three times with PBS, sections were incubated for 2
hr in fluorochrome-coupled secondary antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After being rinsed with PBS,
the sections were mounted with a fluorescence microscope
(Leica). The antibodies used were anti-LC3 (1:100; Abcam,
Cambridge, MA) and anti-beclin 1 (1:200; Abcam).
Western Blot
Western blotting (four animals/group) was performed
according to a previous report (Gao et al., 2012). The proteins
extracted from the cortex of the ischemia side and the corresponding areas of sham-operated mice were used for Western
blot analysis. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 C with
the appropriate primary antibodies: p-AMPKa at Thr 172
(1:1,000; CST), AMPKa (1:1,000; CST), p-mTOR at Ser
2448 (1:1,000; CST), mTOR (1:1,000; CST), p-JNK (1:1,000;
CST), JNK (1:1,000; CST), beclin1 (1:1,000; CST), LC3
(1:1,000; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and GAPDH (1:5,000; KangCheng, Shanghai, China). After washing, the membrane was
incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody for 1.5 hr. Immunoreactive bands were detected by a
chemiluminescence system (ECLplus; Amersham, Arlington
Heights, IL) and analyzed by Quantity One software. GAPDH
was used as the loading control according to previous reports
(Cui et al., 2012; Z.R. Huang et al., 2013). Each sample was
first normalized against the GAPDH level in the sample. Then,
we normalized it against the level of sham sample according to
prior descriptions (Huang et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2012).
Statistical Analysis
All results are expressed as mean 6 SD. Statistical analysis
was carried out by using Student’s two-tailed t-test for comparison between two groups and one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s test when the data involved
three or more groups. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant (Gu et al., 2012).

RESULTS
Effects of SMXZF on Infarct Volumes, Behavioral
Outcomes, Water Content, and CBF Following
Cerebral I/R Injury
To evaluate the effectiveness of SMXZF on cerebral
I/R injury in the mouse model of MCAO, we treated
the mice with three different doses of SMXZF (4.5, 9,
and 18 mg/kg body weight, i.p.). Mouse brains were
evaluated for infarct volume by using TTC staining. As

shown in Figure 2A,B, the infarct volume was significantly increased in the I/R group (31.76% 6 2.31%)
compared with the sham group (4.67% 6 2.16%,
P < 0.01). When given 60 min after occlusion, SMXZF
significantly reduced the infarct volumes caused by I/R at
three doses, with the highest inhibition rate of 61.42%. 3MA, an autophagy inhibitor, also significantly reduced I/
R-induced infarct volume.
In addition to infarction, neurological scores and
brain water content were quantitatively determined to
evaluate the effects of SMXZF following focal I/R.
Results demonstrated that cerebral I/R significantly
increased the neurological scores (3.67 6 0.51) and brain
water content (84.1% 6 1.97%), which were significantly
attenuated at the doses of 9 and 18 mg/kg but not 4.5 mg/
kg of SMXZF (Fig. 2C,D). Finally, CBF was determined
by a laser Doppler perfusion image system in different
groups as shown in Figure 3. Results demonstrated that
CBF was significantly decreased to about 15% of basic
CBF after ischemia and was restored to approximately 80%
of baseline after reperfusion in all groups of mice. Administration of 18 mg/kg SMXZF resulted in a significant
increase in CBF 24 hr after reperfusion (88.63% 6 2.32%,
P < 0.05), but no statistical significance was observed in the
I/R 1 3-MA group. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of SMXZF against cerebral I/R injury.
Effect of SMXZF on the Formation of
Autophagosomes Following Cerebral I/R Injury
We then evaluated the typical autophagosome formation in the neurons of cortex by transmission electron
microscopy. Figure 4 shows that the sham-group neurons
had relatively healthy-looking endoplasmic reticulum,
mitochondria, lysosomes, and nucleus. However, neurons
24 hr after reperfusion were moderately vacuolated, the
mitochondria were broken, and many lysosomes and
autophagosomes had appeared. SMXZF and 3-MA alleviated the injury of neurons and decreased the number of
autophagosomes and lysosomes (Fig. 4).
Effect of SMXZF on the Expression of LC3 and
Beclin1 Following Cerebral I/R Injury
Given that beclin1 and LC3 are commonly used
biomarkers of autophagy activation, we next observed the
protein expression of LC3 and beclin1 in ischemic cortex.
We found that the level of beclin1 and ratio of LC3 II/I
were significantly increased in the model group compared
with the sham group. SMXZF and 3-MA could significantly inhibit the increased expression of beclin1 and LC3
at 24 hr of reperfusion (P < 0.01, Fig. 5).
Immunofluorescent staining also confirmed that the
number of LC3- or beclin1-positive cells was significantly
increased in the ischemic penumbra of cortex, an area
close to the ischemia core, after cerebral I/R, as reported
previously (Xu and Zhang, 2011). SMXZF and 3-MA
treatment markedly decreased the numbers of both LC3positive cells and beclin1-positive cells induced by cerebral I/R (Fig. 6).

Effect of SMXZF on the Activation of AMPK/
mTOR and JNK Signaling Pathways Following
Cerebral I/R Injury
To explore possible mechanisms that could activate
autophagy, we examined JNK and AMPK-mTOR signaling pathways after cerebral I/R. Western blotting analysis revealed the levels of p-AMPKa at Thr172, p-JNK,
and JNK in the MCAO groups were significantly higher
than in the sham group, and p-mTOR at Ser 2448 in the
I/R group was significantly lower than in the control
group (P < 0.01, Fig. 7). SMXZF reduced the levels of pAMPKa at Thr172, JNK, and p-JNK but increased the
level of p-mTOR at Ser 2448. Similarly, 3-MA decreased
the phosphorylation level of p-JNK and JNK and
increased the p-mTOR at Ser 2448. In contrast to
SMXZF, 3-MA showed no obvious effect on p-AMPKa
at Thr172. These results suggest that SMXZF could
inhibit the activation of AMPK/mTOR and JNK signaling pathways following cerebral I/R injury.

content. Results showed that SMXZF could dramatically reduce the infarct volume if introduced between
the onset of ischemia and 4 hr reperfusion (P < 0.01,
Fig. 8). SMXZF also markedly reduced the neurological
scores if introduced before 4 hr of reperfusion after
ischemia (Fig. 8). In addition, treatment with SMXZF 1
hr before reperfusion can restore the I/R-induced
reduction of the brain water content (P < 0.05, Fig. 8).
Thus, we demonstrated that the best administration time
of SMXZF in relation to ischemic stroke is within 4 hr
of reperfusion.

Optimal Administration Time of SMXZF
Finally, we observed the effect of SMXZF on cerebral I/R injury when given at several time points to
explore the best stage for treatment. We investigated the
infarct volume, neurological scores, and brain water

DISCUSSION
Ischemic stroke is often caused by multiple molecular
abnormalities; excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis are all involved in ischemic stroke
(Moskowitz et al., 2010). Recent research has shown that
autophagy is involved in cellular death following cerebral
I/R injury (Tian et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2012). However, the role of autophagy in ischemic stroke is still
debated. Both harmful and protective potentials of
autophagy have been reported (Xu et al., 2012; Wirawan
et al., 2012). Increasing evidence suggests that autophagy
activation contributes to ischemic neuronal injury after
cerebral I/R (Puyal et al., 2009; Zheng et al., 2009).

SMXZF is derived from a traditional Chinese medicine, Sheng-mai San, which has been widely used in the
clinic for treating cardiovascular and cerebral diseases
(Ichikawa and Konishi, 2002; Wang et al., 2005; Li et al.,

2013). In this study, we confirmed that SMXZF could
significantly ameliorate the abnormalities of infarct volume, neurological scores, and brain water content following cerebral I/R injury in mice, which is similar to the

These findings indicated that neuronal autophagy might
be a promising therapeutic target for cerebral I/R treatment and might be involved in the mechanism of
SMXZF’s action against stroke.

Autophagy (self-digestion) is a dynamic intracellular
process consisting of four steps, autophagy induction, vesicle formation, autophagosome and lysosome fusion, and
autophagosome degradation (Ameeta, 2005). To date,
many methods have been developed to measure

autophagy in cells and in animals (Sandra et al., 2010).
We chose transmission electron microscopy to detect
autophagy to gain structural insight into the unique interrelationship between phagophore membranes and other
organelles (Holt et al., 2011). We found a remarkable
increase in autophagosomes and vacuolation of neurons in
the I/R group compared with the sham group. SMXZF
and 3-MA could inhibit autophagosome formation (Fig.
3). This finding gave us the first evidence of SMXZF acting against autophages induced by cerebral I/R in mice.
Additionally, beclin1 (Atg6) can promote the nucleation
of the autophagic vesicle and recruit proteins from the
cytosol in the early stages of autophagy. LC3 (Atg8) is
modified to LC3 I, and then LC3 II (the membranebound form) forms by posttranslational modification and
binds to the outer membrane of autophagosomes
(Ameeta, 2005). Both beclin1 and LC3 are reliable biomarkers of autophagosomes. Given the importance of
beclin1 and LC3 for autophagosome formation and function (Tanida et al., 2008; Wirawan et al., 2012), we
detected the protein levels of LC3 and beclin1 by Western blot and fluorescence microscopy. In our experiment,
the levels of beclin1 and LC3 II were significantly
increased in the I/R group, and SMXZF could decrease
the expression of beclin1 and LC3 II as well as the levels
of LC3 and beclin1 binding to the autophagic membranes
(Figs. 5, 6). In addition, we detected the levels of beclin1
and LC3 II in the contralateral hemispheres of ischemia,
and there were no obvious differences between sham and
I/R mice, which is consistent with previous research

(Rami et al., 2008; J. Huang et al., 2013). Furthermore,
SMXZF at the highest dose showed no inhibition of the
levels of beclin1 and LC3 II (data not shown), which
indicate that the suppression of autophagy by SMXZF
might be ischemia specific. Our results demonstrate that
SMXZF alleviated cerebral I/R injury and was correlated
with inhibiting autophagy.
Abundant studies have demonstrated that autophagy
is regulated by numerous different signal pathways, such
as PI3K-Akt, AMPK-mTOR, beclin1-Bcl2, JNK, and
p38 signal pathways (Liang et al., 2007; Mehrpour et al.,
2010; Wang et al., 2012). Atg1/unc-51-like kinase
(ULK) complex and the beclin1/class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex can regulate autophagy. In
the ischemic stroke model, AMPK is an intracellular
energy sensor to maintain hypothalamic energy balance,
and mTOR is a nutrient sensor to regulate nutrient
homoeostasis (Shang and Wang, 2011; Dunlop and Tee,
2013); prolonged AMPK activity leads to neuronal cell
death during ischemia (Manwani and McCullough,
2013). Additionally, the activation of JNK could promote
beclin1 transcription to induce autophagy. Inhibition of
the JNK pathway by SP600125 could block autophagy
activation (Ren et al., 2010). JNK1 could disrupt becin1Bcl2 complex by multisite phosphorylation of Bcl-2 (Wei
et al., 2008). According to previous reports, the activiation of phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser 2448 continued
to increase at 24 hr after reperfusion and could be
detected at 48 hr or 72 hr after reperfusion (Ayuso et al.,
2010; Xie et al., 2013). The phosphorylation of AMPK
was transiently increased at 24 hr after I/R (Nam et al.,
2013). In addition, the expression of JNK and its activation were also significantly increased at 24 hr of reperfusion after cerebral ischemia (Liu et al., 2012; Z.R. Huang
et al., 2013). Thus, we examined three complex, related
pathways at 24 hr after reperfusion to investigate the effect
of SMXZF on cerebral I/R injury-induced autophagy.
Our findings show that SMXZF could decrease the phosphorylation of AMPKa at Thr172, the expression of
JNK, and the activation of JNK and increase the phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser 2448 compared with the I/
R group (Fig. 7). Therefore, we have proved that
SMXZF might suppress autophagy linked to modulation
of the AMPK/mTOR and JNK pathways.
According to previous demonstrations, ginsenoside
Rg1 could regulate the activation of JNK in cerebral I/R
injury rats and inhibit autophagy and apoptosis by regulating AMPK/mTOR pathways in H9c2 cardiomyocytes
exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (Zhang et al., 2012;
Wang et al., 2013). AMPK and JNK pathways participated in the antihypoxic activity of ginsenoside Rb1 in
PC12 cells (Kong et al., 2009; Hashimoto et al., 2012). In
addition, schizandrin could protect primary rat cortical
cells from glutamate-induced apoptosis by inhibiting activation of JNK (Lee et al., 2012). Our study demonstrates
that SMXZF suppressed autophagy linked to modulation
of both AMPK/mTOR and JNK pathways in cerebral I/
R mice, which might be the integrated action of these
four compounds. In addition, 3-MA is an inhibitor of the

Fig. 8. Administration time course of SMXZF. Mice were subjected

reperfusion, and 12 hr of reperfusion. A: Brain sections. B: Infarct

PI3K-beclin1 complex, which could inhibit autophagosome formation and the activation of LC3 and beclin1
(Qin et al., 2010; Sheng et al., 2010). Both 3-MA and
SMXZF could decrease JNK and the phosphorylation of
JNK and increase the phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser
2448 compared with the model group. The activity of 3MA on mTOR might be due to the relationship between
the mTOR complex and the beclin1 complex, but determining this will require further investigation. However,
we found that 3-MA and SMXZF display their activity
through overlapping yet distinct signaling pathways.
SMXZF controlled AMPKa at Thr172, but 3-MA did
not. This probably is due to SMXZF acting on the
upstream pathways of AMPK or directly affecting AMPK.
The discrepancy also will require further study.
Finally, for clinical relevance, we detected the optimal administration time of SMXZF by addition of
SMXZF at different point followed ischemia. The results

show the effectiveness of SMXZF only when it was introduced in the ischemic period and the early period of
reperfusion. These results provide some evidence for its
potential clinical application. Apart from these findings,
this study also had some limitations. First, whether
SMXZF can regulate I/R-induced autophagy by other,
related signal pathways should be determined. Second,
whether SMXZF can attenuate cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury via other mechanisms such as excitotoxicity,
oxidative stress, and neuronal inflammation has to be
studied further. Third, the effects of monomer of ginsenoside Rb1, Rg1, schizandrin, DT-13, and SMXZF on
regulation of autophagy and its related signaling pathways
must be compared.
With their relatively large molecular weight and
amphiphilic molecular structure, saponins usually have
difficulty in penetrating the blood–brain barrier (BBB).
Some studies have demonstrated that Rb1, Rg1, and their

Journal of Neuroscience Research

metabolites have poor BBB permeability in both normal
and cerebral I/R mice (Wang et al., 2009; Feng et al.,
2010; Lu et al., 2011). However, SMXZF could significantly ameliorate cerebral I/R injury. We assumed that
the neuroprotective effects of SMXZF might be associated with the direct effects of these four components on
the BBB, microvascular endothelial cells, or peripheral
leukocyte according to some reports (Wang et al., 2009;
Hua et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2013). Whether the interaction of these four compounds would affect their BBB
permeability also should be studied further.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that
SMXZF treatment recovers cerebral ischemia–reperfusion
injury-induced abnormalities and is correlated with inhibition of autophagy and modulationg ofAMPK/mTOR
and JNK pathways. The signaling pathways for SMXZF
are overlapping with yet distinct from those of 3-MA.
These findings suggest that inhibiting excessive autophagy
might be a useful therapeutic intervention in cerebrovascular diseases. These data also demonstrate the possible
pathways of SMXZF’s prevention of ischemic strokeinduced neuropathology.
