Isoﬂavone calycosin is a typical phytoestrogen extracted from Chinese medical herb Radix Astragali. It has been
reported that estrogens could provide neuroprotective effects, and dietary intake of phytoestrogens could reduce
stroke injury in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) animal models. In the present study, we investigate the
molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of calycosin on middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) rats. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in male rats by MCAO, neurological deﬁcits and brain
edema was evaluated after 24 h of reperfusion. The results shown calycosin signiﬁcantly reduced the infarcted
volume and the brain water content, and improved the neurological deﬁcit. To provide insight into the functions
of estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated signaling pathway in neuroprotection by calycosin, the expression of miR375, ER-α, RASD1 (Dexamethasone-induced Ras-related protein 1) and Bcl-2 was determined by RT-PCR or
western blot assay. Calycosin exhibited a downregulation of RASD1, and an upregulation of ER-α, miR-375 and
Bcl-2. Our ﬁnding illustrated that calycosin had been shown neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion rats, and the molecular mechanisms may correlate with the positive feedback between ER-α and
miR-375, along with the regulation of downstream targets.

1. Introduction
Stroke, also called cerebrovascular accident, is the third leading
cause of death in developed countries [1] and the most common reason
for permanent disability [2]. And it is considered that cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion (I/R) can lead to aggravated brain injury in the development
of stroke and other cardiovascular diseases, which is induced by generation of reactive oxygen species [3], phospholipase activation [4,5],
energy failure [6], inﬂammatory response [7,8] and programmed cell
death [9,10], etc.
In recent years, data from different studies support the idea that estrogens provide neuroprotective effects in a variety of cerebral ischemia
animal models [11–13]. However, due to the undesirable side effects of
estrogen therapy (such as increased risk of cancers and irregular bleeding), phytoestrogens have received considerable attention as an alternative [14,15]. Phytoestrogens are estrogen-like molecules widely found
in many natural products, especially soy. Because of their structural similarity with estrogen and ability to selectively bind estrogen receptors
(ERs), phytoestrogens can produce estrogenic and/or anti-estrogenic

effects [16]. In recent years, phytoestrogens have been intensively investigated as potential protective treatment in many diseases [17,18].
For example, it is reported that dietary intake of phytoestrogens could
reduce stroke injury in animal model of focal and global cerebral ischemia [19–21]. However, an understanding of the underlying protection
mediated by phytoestrogens from ischemic injury remains incomplete
[22].
As a soy isoﬂavone phytoestrogen, calycosin (C16H12O5) is proven to
have properties of antioxidant, antivirus and apoptosis-modulation
[23–25]. In our previous study, it is suggested that low concentrations
of calycosin (b16 μM) had stimulatory effects on the proliferation of
ER-positive cells in vitro and in vivo [26], which might be related
to the expression of ERα (a subtype of ER) [27]. Next, we conﬁrmed
that, at relative low concentrations, calycosin upregulated the level of
miR-375 and downregulated the level of Dexamethasone-induced
Ras-related protein 1 (RASD1) protein in nerve cells. Notably, it has
been reported that there exists a positive feedback regulation between
miR-375 and ERα in breast cancer [28]. These results, combined with
our previous ﬁndings, make us hypothesize that the positive feedback loop of miRNA-375/ERα and RASD1 may also be involved in the
proliferative effect induced by calycosin in ERα-positive cells. Thereby,
here we focused on the relationship between miRNA-375 and ERα, as
well as their possible downstream effectors.

2. Material and methods
2.1. Drugs and animals
Calycosin (purity N 98%, veriﬁed by high performance liquid chromatography; purchased from Phytomarker, China) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to make a 200 mM stock solution and stored
at 4 °C for further use. All Sprague–Dawley rats (male, 225–285 g, Grade
II, No. 130217) were supplied by the Experimental Animal Center of
Guilin Medical University. All the experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Experimental Research
Institute of Guilin Medical University.
2.2. Focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion model
Rats were randomly divided into sham-operated, I/R and calycosin
groups. The calycosin groups were respectively injected intraperitoneally with high-dose (20 mg·kg·d−1), medium-dose (10 mg·kg·d−1)
and low-dose calycosin (5 mg·kg·d−1) for 14 days. All rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate 1 h after the last drug administration.
After skin incision, the right common carotid artery and external carotid
artery were exposed. Then a nylon monoﬁlament with a round tip was
inserted into the external carotid artery and advanced into the internal
carotid artery, until mild resistance was felt. Such resistance indicated
that the ﬁlament had reached the circle of Willis. During these procedures, the rectal temperature was maintained at 37–38 °C with a
heating lamp and heating pad. After ischemia for 2 h, the ﬁlament was
gently removed and the animals were allowed to recover. While for
the sham-operated group, rats underwent a neck dissection and surgical
preparation of the external carotid artery, but not insertion of ﬁlament.
2.3. Neurological evaluation and infarct volume measurement
After ischemia (2 h), followed by reperfusion (24 h), rates were
evaluated for neurological deﬁcits using a 5-point scale system previously described [29]. Then rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal
injection of 10% chloral hydrate (350 mg·kg−1). Brains were carefully
removed and sliced to 2 mm thickness. The slices were stained with
TTC for 30 min at 37 °C. The infarct areas were photographed on line,
as previously depicted in detail [30]. Image analysis software (NIH
Image, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, version 1.63) was used
for the measurement of the infarct areas.
2.4. Brain edema measurement
After 24 h of reperfusion, rats were decapitated and brains were
immediately removed from the skull. Each hemisphere was weighed
(wet weight), dried at 160 °C heater and then reweighed (dry weight).
The degree of brain water content was calculated by the following
equation: water content = (wet weight − dry weight) / wet weight ×
100%.
2.5. RT-PCR
The ischemic regions of right cerebral cortices were collected and
quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Then the tissues were transferred
into Trizol (Gibco-BRL, USA) in a 1.5 mL tube for 15 min. Chloroform
was added to the tube, shaken vigorously and then incubated for
10 min. The reaction tube was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at
4 °C. The upper portion was transferred into another tube. An equal
volume of isopropyl alcohol was added, shaken and incubated for
10 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C.
The RNA pellet was washed with ice-cold 75% ethanol, and centrifuged
at 7500 g for 5 min at 4 °C. The RNA pellet was air-dried, then dissolved
into RNase-free dH2O. RNA was stored at −80 °C for further use. Total
RNA was reverse transcribed with the RevertAid™, First Strand cDNA

Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel stained with
ethidium bromide and observed under ultraviolet light.
2.6. Western blot analysis
The ischemic regions of right cerebral cortices were prepared in icecold lysis buffer. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min
at 4 °C, and protein concentrations in the resulting supernatants were
determined by Bio-Rad assay kit. Equal amounts of protein (40 μg/lane)
were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto 0.22 μm polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). The membranes were blocked in TBST (Tris-buffered solution, pH 7.6, 0.05%
Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dried milk at 4 °C overnight. Membrane
were further incubated sequentially with primary antibodies including,
RASD1 (1:1000), and β-actin (1:1000). After three washes, the blots
were subsequently incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies
coupled to horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 1 h and
then developed in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) western blot detection reagents (Beyotime, China).
2.7. Statistics
Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. The Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 13.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was
used for statistical analyses including one-way ANOVA and Student's
t-test. A probability (p)-value b 0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Calycosin protected brain function from ischemia/reperfusion injury
As shown in Table 1, compared with I/R group, calycosin markedly
improved neurological function, which manifested as decreased neurological score (p b 0.01). Accordingly, we found that the brain water content was signiﬁcantly reduced with treatment of calycosin (p b 0.01)
(Fig. 1B). When the brain was stained with TTC, infarct tissue was visualized as an area of unstained part in ischemia/reperfusion rats, whereas
stained red in viable tissue. As expected, there was no infarct part in
sham-operated group, and the infarct volume decreased in calycosin
groups (p b 0.01), as shown in Fig. 1A. In addition, calycosin was
shown to act in a dose-dependent manner to protect neuron cells
from ischemia/reperfusion injury.
3.2. Effects of calycosin on miR-375, ER-α, RASD1 and Bcl-2 mRNA
expression in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rats
As shown in Fig. 2, more RASD1 and less Bcl-2 mRNA expression were
observed in I/R group compared with those in sham group (p b 0.01).
And with the treatment of calycosin, there was a gradual decrease
in the RASD1 mRNA expression and a progressive increase in Bcl-2.

Meanwhile, calycosin enhanced ER-α and miR-375 mRNA expression in
a dose-dependent manner.

3.3. Effects of calycosin on ER-α, RASD1 and Bcl-2 protein expression in
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rats
In accordance with mRNA expression, levels of RASD1 protein was
signiﬁcantly higher in I/R group than sham group, while Bcl-2 protein
was lower (p b 0.01), as shown in Fig. 3B and C. And calycosin exerted
a repressive effect on RASD1 and a promotive effect on Bcl-2 in a
dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, calycosin was found to dosedependently upregulate ER-α protein expression (Fig. 3A).

4. Discussion
It has been well established that estradiol and estrogen-like
compounds exert neuroprotective effects in cerebral focal and global
ischemia by binding the classical estrogen receptors. However, the
precise mechanisms underlying these protective effects are still under
investigation. In the present study, calycosin, a typical phytoestrogen,
has been shown to improve the brain function and injured area in
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rats, which could be mediated by downregulation of RASD1 and upregulation of ER-α, miR-375, Bcl-2.
It has been reported that exogenous administration of 17β-estradiol
could reduce infarct volume following MCAO in ovariectomized
female rats [31]. One potential mechanism for estradiol-induced

neuroprotection is that it modulates expression of genes involved in
cell death and apoptosis, such as anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family. However, given the possible negative health consequences of hormone
therapy, the clinical application of phytoestrogens has increased as
an appealing alternative to estrogen. Phytoestrogens regulate gene
expression through interaction with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)
and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), which are both expressed in the
brain [32,33]. ERα and ERβ are principally localized in the nucleus
of cells, but extra-nuclear localization has also been found in the cytoplasm and membrane of cells. Both ERs have been demonstrated to
mediate nuclear receptor-signaling, as well as non-genomic extranuclear signaling pathways [34,35]. Activation of nuclear ER leads to
genomic signaling in which the expression of pro-survival/antiapoptotic genes increased and pro-death/apoptotic genes decreased.
In contrast, activation of extra-nuclear ER is suggested to regulate
correlative kinases and post-translationally modify other proteins'
activation to exert neuroprotective effects [36]. At present, the predominant view suggests that ER-α play a primary role in neuroprotection
against cerebral ischemia mediated by estrogen and estrogen-like
compounds [37,38].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs
of 19 to 25 nucleotides, which have emerged as important posttranscriptional regulators of gene involved in many biological processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, apoptosis and
metabolism. miR-375 is ﬁrstly identiﬁed from murine pancreatic βcell and characterized as a regulator of insulin secretion that participates in glucose homeostasis by controlling the growth and morphogenesis of the pancreatic islet [39]. Further studies have conﬁrmed
that miR-375 is widely present in various tissues or organs including
brain [40–42]. Especially, de Souza et al. identiﬁed that miR-375 had
the capacity to enhance ERα signaling in ERα (+) breast cancer cells,
and there existed a positive loop between ERα and miR-375 [28].
Similarly, in the present study, we identiﬁed the expression of ERα
mRNA and proteins in rat brain, which was signiﬁcantly upregulated
by calycosin. Moreover, accompanied with changes in ERα, the enhanced expression of miR-375 mRNA was achieved with treatment of
calycosin, indicating the existence of positive loop between ERα and
miR-375 in nervous system.
Ras proteins, characterized as small GTP-binding proteins, function as
key regulator for diverse cellular processes such as cell proliferation,
survival, differentiation, motility, and so on [43–45]. RASD1 (also called
dexRas) is a member of the Ras superfamily and considered as a transcript
that shows strong, rapid, and transient induction after treatment with
Dexamethasone. RASD1 is a regulator in mitogen-activated protein

kinase (MAPK)-mediated cascade leading to cell proliferation or apoptosis [46,47]. In recent report we have demonstrated that relatively high
concentration calycosin triggered cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by down-regulating the expression of Bcl-2 and
up-regulating Bax in MCF-7 cells, which was signiﬁcantly correlated
with elevated expression of RASD1 [25]. On the contrary, in this study,
our data implied that calycosin lowered RASD1 expression and raised
Bcl-2 expression, contributing to protection of nerve cells and amelioration of ischemia/reperfusion injury. These contradictory results may
be explained by concentration-dependent effects. We speculated that
calycosin can act either pro-apoptotic at relatively high concentration
or anti-apoptotic at relative low concentration, which needs further
investigation.
In conclusion, our studies indicate that calycosin has shown neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rats. Calycosin significantly reduced the infarct volume and the brain water content, and
improved the neurological deﬁcit. And the mechanisms underlying
the neuroprotection exhibited by calycosin seem to involve, at least in
part, estrogen receptor activation, positive feedback regulation by
miR-375, deregulation of RASD1 and upregulation of Bcl-2 leading. Additional investigations are needed to determine the detailed molecular
targets and signaling pathways mediating the neuroprotective action
of calycosin.
