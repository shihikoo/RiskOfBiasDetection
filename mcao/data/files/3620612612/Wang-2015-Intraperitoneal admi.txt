in a signiﬁcant decrease in carbonyl contents and HO-1 against oxidative stress, which
turned to be fast reduction during the ﬁrst 24 h and tended to be stable from 24 h to 72 h
after MCAO. The study shows that rhTrx-1 exerts an neuroprotective effect in cerebral
ischemia injury. The anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic and anti-inﬂammatory properties of
rhTrx-1 are more likely to succeed as a therapeutic approach to diminish oxidative stressinduced neuronal apoptotic cell death in acute ischemic stroke.

injury in cerebral ischemia, the mechanisms underlying of
cerebral stroke are not yet illuminated completely for effective therapy.
Thioredoxin (TRX) is a 12-KDa small multifunctional
protein, which exchanges disulﬁde to dithiol to maintain its

90

brain research 1615 (2015) 89–97

reducibility (Holmgren, 1985) so that the TRX system can
improve the cellular oxidation and deoxidation status by
interconnecting the other signiﬁcant glutathione (GSH) system. Although the amount of TRX is much less than that of
GSH, the efﬁciency of binding transcription factors to the
target DNA is more productive, and TRX can be induced by
various types of oxidative stress, such as viral infection, X-ray
irradiation, UV, antineoplastic agents, ischemic/reperfusion
injury (Holmgren, 1985; Nakamura et al., 1994; Takagi et al.,
1998). TRX, the component of the TRX system, not only can
scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Das and Das, 2000)
against the acute oxidative stress, but also plays a vital role in
redox state to maintain the balance of internal environment
of the body cooperating with peroxiredoxin (Tamura and
Stadtman, 1996). Furthermore, TRX also shows a signiﬁcant
cytoprotective effects in anti-inﬂammation and anti-apoptosis, as well as the redox regulation of transcription factors
such as nuclear factor-kappa B (Nakamura et al., 2001) and
activator protein-1 (Hirota et al., 1997). In addition, overexpression of Trx-1 and exogenous intravenous administration of rhTrx have both been reported to ameliorate brain
damage after transient focal ischemia (Hattori et al., 2004; Ma
et al., 2012; Takagi et al., 1998; Zhou et al., 2009).
In spite of the above diverse properties, the speciﬁc
mechanisms of Trx's protective effects have not been completely elucidated and a plenty of researches about TRX
nearly were demonstrated on cardiology. Therefore in this
experiment, we explore if there is a neuroprotective role of
recombinant human Trx-1 (rhTrx-1) in transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion in mice, in which rhTrx-1 was
delivered intraperitoneally.

Results

2.1.

Physiological parameters

2.3.

The brain water content of the ischemic ipsilateral hemisphere of the vehicle-treated MCAO group was differently
higher than that of the sham group (Fig. 2). However, the
brain edema was signiﬁcantly ameliorated with rhTrx-1
10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg than the vehicle-treated mice, and
no difference was found between the rhTrx-1 5 mg/kg group
and the vehicle-treated group and the same nondistinctive
result was similarly revealed between the dose of 10 mg/kg
and 20 mg/kg (Fig. 2)

2.4.

2.2.
rhTrx-1 improves neurological deﬁcits and reduces
infarct volume after acute ischemia/reperfusion injury
The neurological deﬁcit and infarct volume were determined
24 h after MCAO. There is no infarct and neurological deﬁcit
in the sham-operated group of mice (Fig. 1), on the contrary,
the neurological deﬁcit of mice was signiﬁcantly aggravated
in the vehicle-treated ischemia/reperfusion group (Fig. 1C).
Pretreatment with 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg of rhTrx-1obviously
decreased cerebral ischemic infarct volume and neurological
deﬁcit scores; however, the infarct volume and neurological
deﬁcit showed no signiﬁcant difference between the vehicletreated group and the rhTrx-1 5 mg/kg group (Fig. 1). As
shown in Fig. 1, the rhTrx-1 20 mg/kg group presented
improving trend relatively compared with the rhTrx-1
10 mg/kg group, but no signiﬁcant statistic difference.

rhTrx-1 decreases neuronal apoptosis

Apoptotic cells were nearly no found in the cortical area of
the shame-operated mice and emerged largely signiﬁcantly
in ischemic penumbra areas of the vehicle-treated MCAO
mice (Fig. 3). The percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was
more signiﬁcantly reduced at the dose of the rhTrx-1 10 mg/
kg and 20 mg/kg than that of the MCAO mice, and no statistic
difference was found between the rhTrx-1 5 mg/kg group and
the vehicle-treated group (Fig. 3).

2.5.

rhTrx-1 suppresses the expression of casepase-3

As shown in the results of western blot in Fig. 4, the
expression quantity of casepase-3 and cleaved casepase-3
in the vehicle-treated MCAO mice was signiﬁcantly increased
after ischemia/reperfusion; and the activity of casepase-3 and
cleaved casepase-3 was signiﬁcantly inhibited at the dosage
of the rhTrx-1 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg vs. the MCAO mice
(Fig. 4), but no difference was found again at the dose of the
rhTrx-1 5 mg/kg versus the MCAO group (Fig. 4).

2.6.

No difference was found for these variables of physiological
parameters (mean arterial blood pressure. PaCO2, PaO2, pH,
rectal temperature and blood glucose) before ischemia and
after ischemia (Table 1).

rhTrx-1 attenuates brain water content

rhTrx-1 attenuates oxidative stress

As shown in Fig. 5A, the protein carbonyl contents were
signiﬁcantly lower in the rhTrx-1 10 mg/kg group and rhTrx-1
20 mg/kg group than that of the vehicle-treated MCAO group,
and no signiﬁcant difference was found between the rhTrx-1
10 mg/kg group and the rhTrx-1 20 mg/kg group. The expression trend of HO-1 further conﬁrmed the results of the
protein carbonyl contents (Fig. 5C).

2.7.
rhTrx-1 attenuates oxidative stress at different time
windows after the MCAO
To demonstrate the time effect of MCAO and neuroprotective
effect of rhTrx-1, we tested the expression of protein carbony1 and HO-1 in the vehicle and 10 mg/kg rhTrx-1-treated
groups at different time windows after MCAO. The protein
carbony1 contents in the vehicle increased fast in the ﬁrst
24 h and reached to the peak at 24 h of MCAO I/R (Fig. 6A and
C). As shown in Fig. 6B and C, the protein carbony1 contents
in treated groups decreased signiﬁcantly from 12 h of MCAO
I/R and reached to a relatively stable status from 24 h to 72 h.
The expression of HO-1 was consistent the results of the
protein carbonyl contents at different time windows, which
changed in the similar trend (Fig. 7).

Discussion

In this study, we showed that rhTrx-1 by intraperitoneally
administering signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume, brain

water contents and neurological deﬁcits in a mouse MCAO
model after cerebral I/R injury. In addition, the study suggests
that rhTrx-1 probably attenuated oxidative stress and
decreased neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting the casepase-3
activities. The neuroprotective effect of rhTrx-1 had some

92

brain research 1615 (2015) 89–97

time-dependent effect in different time windows, which was
most effective at 24 h after MCAO and tended to be stable
from 24 h to 72 h.
After cerebral ischemia, multiple observations suggest
that ischemic injury is associated with neuronal apoptosis
and necrosis (Endres et al., 1998; Li et al., 2007; Saito et al.,
2005; Williams et al., 1996; Yanagisawa et al., 2008). The

pathogenesis of cerebrel ischemia implating oxygen-derived
free radicals and gene regulation has been widely discussed
(Chan, 1994; Eliasson et al., 1997; Hara et al., 1997; Martinou
et al., 1994; Siesjo, 1984). Increasing evidence shows that
radical scavenger has protective effects in cerebral ischemia
models (Amemiya et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005). Trx is a
small multifunctional protein with a disulﬁde/dithiol
(Holmgren, 1985, 1989), and regulate various intracelluar
molecules such as NF-B, activator protein 1 (AP-1), and
mitogen-activated kinase (Abate et al., 1990; Hirota et al.,
1997; Saitoh et al., 1998; Schenk et al., 1994). Furthermore, Trx
is able to scavenge ROS from brain tissue, cerebral vascular
endothelial cells, and neutrophils, and negative regulation of
cellular apoptosis (Hattori et al., 2004; Matsuda et al., 1991;
Mitsui et al., 1992). Multiple literatures indicate that Trx plays
a series of signiﬁcant biological roles in both intra- and
extracellular compartments. In our study, I/R injury increase
neuronal apoptosis and the level of casepase-3 as previously
described (Ni et al., 1998; Xu et al., 2006), and rhTrx-1 with
intraperitoneal administration attenuated neuronal apoptosis in the cortex in the ischemic hemisphere.
Most peptides and protein drugs have limited access to
permeating BBB in according to their size and charge. However,

such as basic ﬁbroblast growth factor and hybridized Cu/Zn
superoxide dismutase (SOD) were detected in brain tissue after
transient focal ischemia (Fisher et al., 1995; Francis et al., 1997;
Kuroiwa et al., 1985), and Trx is a 12-KDa protein less than the
above substance to permeate the BBB more easily. Heme oxygenases (HO) are cytosolic enzymes that participate in hemedeoxiﬁcation by binding and degrading the free heme group, the
products of HO activity have important beneﬁcial antioxidation

effects. HO-1, one isoforms of HO, is induced by a variety of
conditions of environmental stress. In this study, rhTrx-1 that
decreased protein carbonyl contents and the expression of HO-1
may show protective effects on the ischemic area with the
abilities of antioxidation and antiapoptosis.
Severe middle cerebral artery infarction is commonly
associated with diverse degrees of brain edema and has a
high mortality (Aiyagari and Diringer, 2002). However, the

brain research 1615 (2015) 89–97

underlying mechanisms that breakdown of BBB leading to
vasogenic edema in cerebral ischemia are not fully elucidated. In experimental study, several modulators and mediators such as aquaporins, free radicals, inﬂammatory cells,
and vascular endothelial growth factor have been identiﬁed
(Ayata and Ropper, 2002; Simard et al., 2007), and the brain
edema growth is associated with increased neurological
worsening (Gebel et al., 2002; Xi et al., 2002). In our study,
rhTrx-1 may signiﬁcantly ameliorate neurological deﬁcits and
attenuate brain water contents of ischemic hemispheres via
scavenging free radicals and increasing the local cerebral
blood ﬂow of the ischemic area (Hattori et al., 2004).
In summary, we demonstrate that rhTrx-1 intraperitoneal
administration decreases brain damage against I/R injury in a
murine transient focal ischemic model. As a result of reducing brain edema, thioredoxin may have a signiﬁcant clinic
implication against stroke. However, a therapeutic time
window is important to provide neuroprotection effectively
during ischemic stroke, and so the certain optimal time of
rhTrx-1 need to be elucidated for the further study. At the
same time, the associated neuroprotective mechanisms of
Trx need to be explored and expounded.

Experimental procedures

4.1.

Animals

Male C57BL/6 mice, 25–30 g, were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center of the Fourth Military Medical University.
All experiment procedures were according with the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines on the Use of Laboratory
Animals, and were approved by the Fourth Military Medical
University Committee on Animal Care. All animals were fed
freely regular mouse chow with access to water, and housed
in a temperature-controlled room with an alternating 12-h
light-dark cycle.

4.2.

Experiments groups and rhTrx-1 treatment

Animals were randomly divided into different groups (n¼ 6–
8): (1) sham group; (2) vehicle-treated cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion (I/R) group (I/R group); (3) rhTrx-1-treated I/R
group (I/RþrhTrx-1group). (4) Time-dependent vehicle-treated groups of I/R were tested at 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h
after MCAO in mice. (5) Time-dependent 10 mg/kg rhTrx-1treated I/R groups were detected at 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h,
72 h after MCAO in mice. The rhTrx-1-treated animals
received rhTrx-1 (the cytosolic form of Trx; Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louise, MO) at a total dose of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg
respectively dissolved in 0.2 ml of 0.9% saline at 30 min before
the operation by intraperitoneal injection. Vehicle-treated
groups were administered 0.9% saline 0.2 ml IP.

4.3.

Model of transient focal cerebral ischemia

Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed as
previously described (Clark et al., 1997; Gursoy-Ozdemir et al.,
2000). Brieﬂy, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg i.p.). A 6-0 rounded tip nylon monoﬁlament

95

was gently advanced from the right common artery to the
internal carotid artery until a faint resistance was felt,
signifying MCAO. Focal cerebral ischemia for 2 h was induced
by MCAO and reperfusion was administrated by withdrawing
the suture. The same surgical procedures were performed on
sham animals without MCAO. The physiologic parameters
were measured at baseline before ischemia and at reperfusion, and the blood pressure and arterial blood sampling were
also monitored continuously by cannulating the right femoral
artery. Regional cerebral blood ﬂow monitoring was achieved
using a laser Doppler blood ﬂowmeter. The rectal temperature was maintained at 3770.5 1C with the use of a
thermostat-controlled heating blanket and a lamp from the
start of the surgery until the animals recovered from anesthesia. The mice were allowed to recover from surgery in a cage
with free access to food and water in a temperaturecontrolled and air-ventilated room during the experiment.

4.4.

Neurological deﬁcit scoring evaluation

Neurological deﬁcits based on a four-tiered grading system
was assessed 24 h after MCAO I/R by a blinded investigator as
previously described(Hara et al., 1997): 0, no apparent deﬁcits
(normal); 1, failure to extend forepaw (mild); 2, circling to the
left side (moderate); and 3, loss of walking or righting reﬂex
(severe).

4.5.

Measurement of infarct size

After neurological assessment of the mice, they were deeply
anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, i.p.) and
euthanized by cervical dislocation. Decapitate the mice and
remove the brains immediately; and then slice the brain
coronally into 5 slices (1 mm thick) with a brain matrix on ice
and incubate the brain slices in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC, Sigma) at 37 1C for 20 min in the dark. Furthermore ﬁx the brain slices in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 1Cfor
24 h until imaging and photographed. The infarct volume was
measured using an image analysis system, Image-Pro Plus6.0,
and calculated as previously described: left hemisphere
area (right hemisphere area infarct area) (Schabitz et al.,
2003). Infarct size was showed as a percentage of the
contralateral structure.

4.6.

Brain water contents measuring

The mice were deeply anesthetized by sodium pentobarbital
(60 mg/kg i.p.) and decapitated after 24 h of MCAO I/R. The
brains were rapidly removed and divided into 2 hemispheres
along the midline and the cerebellum on the ice. The brain
samples was immediately weighed on an electronic analytical balance to achieve the wet weight and were weighed
again to obtain the dry weight after 24 h dried in an oven at
100 1C. Water content was calculated as follows: (wet
weight dry weight)/(wet weight)  100 (Chu et al., 2004;
Jung et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2006).

TUNEL staining

After 24 h of MCAO I/R, the mice were anesthetized and
perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline followed by icy 4%
paraformaldehyde solution, and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24–48 h for parafﬁn embedding. TUNEL staining was
performed according to the manufacturer's protocol, and
slices were labeled with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase
and TUNEL-positive cells emitted a green ﬂuorescent color.
TUNEL-positive cells were quantiﬁed using light microscopy
at 40  magniﬁcation, and 8–10 ﬁelds for each section were
selected from the ischemic adjacent cortex, the ischemic
penumbra area. The average percentage of TUNEL-positive
cells were determined and expressed through a scale
calibration.

4.8.

Western blot

After 24-h MCAO I/R, the mice were deeply anesthetized and
decapitated; the brains were rapidly removed and the
ischemic penumbra was achieved for western blotting. The
tissue samples were homogenized and centrifuged for protein
extraction. Protein levels were quantiﬁed using a BCA protein
assay, and then the proteins (40–60 μg) were electrophoresed
and electrotansferred to nitrocellulose membrane; and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 1C, involving
casepase-3 (1:800, CST), cleaved casepase-3 (1:600, CST), HO-1
(1:250, abcam). After washing, blots were incubated with
corresponding HRP-conjugated second antibody and developed ﬁlms with the ECL chemiluminescence system.

4.9.

Protein carbonyl content

Protein carbonyl content of the ischemic penumbra was
measured by western blotting with the OXYBLOTTM Protein
Oxidation Detection Kit (Millipore) and basically followed the
procedure as outlined in the brochure kit.

4.10.

Statistical analysis

All data are expressed as mean7SEM. The inter-group differences of all groups were statistically analyzed by Wilcoxon
signed rank test with SPSS 16.0 software. Differences were
considered statistically signiﬁcant if Po0.05.
