The ‘long jump test’ can assess potential psychosomatic deﬁcits produced by stroke.
Male and female mice differ in latency to jump, but not in jump success rate.
Cerebral stroke does not affect jump success rate, but increases latency to jump.
Higher jump latencies could not be explained by increased anxiety.
Acute ﬂuoxetine did not have any effect on jump latency or success rate.

Background: Stroke survivors suffer from persistent disability, as well as severe sensorimotor and cognitive deﬁcits. The preclinical assessment of such deﬁcits is important for the development of novel
interventions and therapeutics.
New method: The aim of this study was to develop a quantitative behavioral measure of hindlimb functionality in rodents, which could be used to assess deﬁcits after a neural injury, such as stroke. Here we
introduce a test to measure long jump behavior in mice.
Results: Using this test we ﬁrst showed that while male and female mice exhibited no differences in jump
success rate, the female mice showed lower baseline jumping latencies. Next we demonstrated that the
induction of a cerebral stroke via middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 45 min did not affect the
jump success rate in either group; however, it did signiﬁcantly increase jump latencies in both male and
female mice. Finally, we used therapeutic interventions to explore mechanisms that may be involved in
producing this increase in jump latency by administering the anti-depressant ﬂuoxetine prior to the long
jump assay, and also tested for potential changes in anxiety levels after stroke.
Comparison with existing methods: Other methods to assess hindlimb functionality are not speciﬁc,
because they measure behaviors that rely not only on hindlimbs, but also on forelimbs and tail.
Conclusions: This study introduces a novel assay that can be used to measure a stroke induced behavioral
deﬁcit with great sensitivity, and raises interesting questions about potential mechanisms regulating this
effect.

Stroke is a debilitating neural injury resulting in persistent
disability, as well as severe sensorimotor and cognitive deﬁcits
(Bouët et al., 2007). Interventions directed at treating these outcomes are important in reducing the overall impact of stroke
in patients and in restoring their ability to carry out normal

day-to-day functions (Schallert, 2006). Rodents have served as
important models in studying the pathophysiology of, and the functional behavioral deﬁcits arising from a variety of neural injuries,
such as cerebral stroke. The middle cerebral artery occlusion
method of stroke induction in rodents has been an invaluable tool
in studying the short and long term neurological deﬁcits resulting
from cerebral stroke (Rosell et al., 2013). The preclinical assessment
of such deﬁcits allows for a better understanding of the progression of this injury and is important for the development of novel
interventions and therapeutics.
Many behavioral assays have been designed to evaluate a wide
array of functional outcomes following focal cerebral ischemia
induced injury in rats and mice (Schaar et al., 2010). Some such tests
include composite scores of general welfare such as the Benderson Neurological Scoring Scales, the Modiﬁed Neurological Severity
Scores (Bederson et al., 1986; Zhang et al., 2002), and tests for cognitive deﬁcits such as the Modiﬁed Morris Water Maze and the
Radial Arm Maze (Volpe et al., 1984; Schallert, 2006). Furthermore,
a battery of tests have been developed to measure sensorimotor
deﬁcits, some of which are speciﬁc for forelimb use, such as: the
Cylinder Test, the Reaching Pellet Retrieval Task, the Staircase Test,
the Vibrissae Elicited Forelimb Placing Test, the Corner Test, the
Accelerated Rotarod Test and the Adhesive Removal Test (Schallert
et al., 2000, 1982; Montoya et al., 1991; Markgraf et al., 1992; Baird
et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2001; Gharbawie et al., 2004; Schallert,
2006; Allred and Jones, 2008; Allred et al., 2008; Bouet and Freret,
2012); and others that are speciﬁc for hindlimb use, such as: the
Grid Walking Test, the Ledged Tapered Beam Test and the Ladder Rung Walking Test (Metz and Whishaw, 2002; Schallert and
Woodlee, 2005; Allred and Jones, 2008). While it is apparent that
there are various tests measuring deﬁcits in forelimb use, there
are far fewer tests that measure hindlimb functionality. Moreover,
these hindlimb assays are not very speciﬁc, because they measure
behaviors that rely not only on hindlimbs, but also on forelimbs and
tail.
Improved limb mobility, and walking in particular, are considered to be the primary goals of many patients recovering from
stroke (Bohannon et al., 1991; Mayo et al., 1999). Therefore, it is
important to develop reliable and valid assays of hindlimb function in animals, which can then be useful for designing therapeutic
interventions directed at achieving these goals. One of the difﬁculties with designing ways to measure hindlimb use is that rodents
usually do not use their hindlimbs, as often as they use forelimbs,
for complex motor functions. Moreover, the assays that have been
shown to be associated with hindlimb use, typically measure balance and walking ability, both of which are markedly different
in rodents. This is because they are able to use their forelimbs
as well as their tails for balance, something that is not applicable to humans. Identiﬁcation of behaviors that rely primarily on
hindlimbs, and that cannot be easily compensated with forelimbs
or tail, may be required for the development of novel assays to measure hindlimb function. One such behavior may be the innate ability
to jump in mice and rats alike (Hart et al., 2009). Jumping requires
the animal to kick off with the hindlimbs in a fashion that cannot easily be compensated. As such, it may be possible to quantify
the jumping ability of rodents and measure changes in this ability
following a neural injury.
Here we introduce a novel test to measure long jump behavior
in mice. We hypothesized that the induction of stroke will produce
a deﬁcit in the jumping ability of mice, and that this deﬁcit will
represent a loss of hindlimb functionality. In order to test this idea,
we quantiﬁed the long jump ability in mice using two variables over
four distances: (1) the percent of successful jumps at each distance
and (2) the latency to initiate a jump per trial. Using this test we
ﬁrst established baseline measures of jumping ability in mice, and
sought to identify any basal sex differences that may exist. Next, we

213

tested the mice for potential deﬁcits in these measures after the
induction of stroke via middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
Lastly we sought to identify potential neural mechanisms that may
regulate long jump behavior in mice.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
All mice in the study were purchased from Charles River
(Wilmington, MA); male and female C57BL/6 mice between 18
and 24 g of weight were used. The animals were group housed
in a 12/12 h light/dark cycle, and the housing room temperature
was maintained between 75 and 85 ◦ F. For behavioral studies, the
experimenter was blinded to the treatment. All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with, and pre-approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
2.2. Ischemia
Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced via right middle cerebral occlusion (MCAO) as previously described, with some
modiﬁcation (Pan et al., 2014). Reversible right MCAO was induced
for 45 min, using the intraluminal ﬁlament technique (6-0 suture)
under isoﬂuorane anesthesia. Core and temporalis muscle temperatures were maintained between 35.5 and 37.5 ◦ C throughout the
procedure with the use of a heating lamp. Occlusion, and subsequent reperfusion, were conﬁrmed via laser-doppler ﬂowmetry
(LDF). Sham operations were conducted in a similar fashion, with
the exception of cauterizing the common, external, and internal
carotid arteries. The animals were monitored for food and ﬂuid consumption, as well as general health status, for three days following
the procedure.
2.3. Cylinder test
The cylinder test was used to conﬁrm stroke induced forelimb
bias in animals, as previously described (Schallert et al., 2000). The
animal was placed in a transparent plastic cylinder (H: 15 cm, D:
7 cm), and independent use of right or left forelimb to touch the
cylinder during a full rear was measured using video recordings.
The test was carried out for at least 15 touches or a maximum
of 10 min. Data are represented as the percent of right forepaw
touches following the MCAO or sham procedure vs. the baseline touches. A Student’s t-test was used for statistical analyses
(StatView, Cary, NC).
2.4. Elevated plus maze
The elevated plus maze test (EPM) was used as previously
described (Pellow et al., 1985), with some modiﬁcations. The apparatus was a ‘+’ shaped maze, which was raised 52 cm from the ﬂoor.
The four arms were 34 cm long and 9.5 cm wide. The ‘closed’ arms
were surrounded by plywood walls 14 cm in height, while the open
arms had no walls. The animals were placed in the middle of the
maze facing either the open or the closed arm at random. Each
test was carried out for 5 min. The total time spent in the open
and the closed arm, and the number of entries into each arm were
measured. The data are represented as the percent of time spent
or entries into the open arm, over total time spent and entries
into both arms. For male vs. female experiments, a Student’s t-test
was conducted to determine signiﬁcant differences. For the treatment experiments, a repeated measures ANOVA, with Fisher’s PLSD
post hoc test was used to asses group by interaction differences. A
higher ratio suggests increased anxiety, while a lower ratio suggests

214

N. Mittal et al. / Journal of Neuroscience Methods 256 (2015) 212–219

decreased anxiety according to previous research sources (Pellow
et al., 1985).
2.5. Long jump test
The long jump test was performed using a wooden beam with
dimensions H: 1.5 cm × W: 4.5 cm × L: 100 cm. The beam was raised
80 cm from the ﬂoor using a saw horse, and one end of the beam
was covered with a surgery drape to provide additional padding for
the jump. An empty plastic housing cage was placed on its side, on
a table, at level with the beam (80 cm from the ﬂoor), such that the
open end was facing the beam. A bag of bubble wrap and packing
peanuts was placed on the ﬂoor between the beam and the cage to
provide cushion for any potential falls due to failed jump attempts.
The cage was covered to occlude the mice’s view of the surrounding
areas. The bottom edge of the cage was lined with a strip of drape
to allow the mice to better grip the cage after a successful jump.
All the cage mates, along with saw dust from the home cage and a
food pellet coated with peanut butter, were included to make the
cage more appealing for the mice.
All mice underwent a training session, during which they were
trained to jump up to 30 cm. 10 min before the beginning of the
session, all the cage mates were placed in the testing cage for habituation. Then, at the beginning of the training session, the beam was
placed in a way such that it was touching the cage and the mice
were placed on the beam such that they could simply walk into the
cage. After three successful entries at each distance, the beam was
slowly moved further away from the cage in 5 cm increments (see
schematic in Fig. 1a). Two days after the training session, a pretest was conducted to acquire baseline data. Success rate and jump
latency data were measured at 10, 20, 25, and 30 cm distances. At
each distance the mice were given a maximum of ﬁve attempts to
complete three successful jumps. The success rate at each distance
was calculated as the total number of successful jumps divided by
the total number of attempts. The latency to jump was measured
from the moment the mouse reached the edge of the beam until
the initiation of a jump. The mice were gently tapped, at the base of
their tail, at 30-s intervals to encourage them to jump. A maximum
cut off time of 105 s was used. If a mouse did not initiate a jump
within 105 s, the base of their tail was lightly tapped repeatedly
until a jump was made, and the mouse received a latency score of
105 s. The mice were retested using the same parameters 3 days
after induction of stroke. The data are represented as the percentage of successful jumps and the average latency to jump in seconds.
A repeated measures ANOVA was used, with Fisher’s PLSD post hoc
test for multiple comparisons (StatView). The statistical comparisons are shown as group by interaction effects for all experiments.

provided in the online supplements.
3. Results
3.1. Focal cerebral ischemia and cylinder test
Focal cerebral ischemia was successfully induced via middle
cerebral artery occlusion for 45 min. Occlusion decreased local
blood ﬂow to 10.66 ± 0.26% of basal levels, as conﬁrmed by laser
doppler ﬂowmetry (LDF). The core and temporalis muscle temperatures were maintained at 36.3 ± 0.1 ◦ C. Please refer to Table 1
for the total number of animals that underwent MCAO or sham
procedure, and their respective day 3 survival rates. Three days
after the ischemia procedure all mice underwent long jump testing. On post-surgery day 4, one day after the long jump test,
cylinder test was performed as a marker of functional deﬁcits
produced by stroke. As expected, stroke produced a signiﬁcant

increase in ipsilateral forelimb use in both female (MCAO vs. sham:
p < 0.01, F1,11 = 10.766; Fig. 1b), and male mice (MCAO vs. sham:
p < 0.01, F1,17 = 10.648; Fig. 1c). There were no sex differences in
stroke-induced forelimb asymmetry (male vs. female: p = 0.140,
F1,18 = 2.380). Moreover, treatment with either saline (untreated vs.
saline: p = 0.432, F1,23 = 0.640), or ﬂuoxetine (untreated vs. ﬂuoxetine; p = 0.263, F1,22 = 1.132) prior to long jump test on day 3 did not
affect the functional outcome of stroke, as measured by the cylinder test on day 4. It should be noted that since our focus was on
behavioral and functional outcomes of stroke, we did not perform
histological analysis of ischemia-induced infarction in the present
study. We have previously shown that the occlusion measured by
LDF, and the behavioral deﬁcits measured by the cylinder test are
at least sufﬁcient functional markers of stroke, and correlate well
with infarctions produced by the MCAO procedure (Li et al., 2004;
Craft et al., 2006; Akiyoshi et al., 2011; Pan et al., 2014).
3.2. Basal sex differences in long jump
We ﬁrst sought to identify potential sex differences in baseline
jumping ability in mice. While we did not expect to ﬁnd any sex
differences, we thought it was prudent to collect these data, so
that they are available as reference for future studies. For this purpose, we measured the basal success rate and latency to jump in
these mice. As expected, male (n = 19) and female (n = 15) subjects
exhibited similar success rates across all distances (male vs. female:
p = 0.504, F1,32 = 0.457; Fig. 2a). However, they markedly differed in
their latency to jump. Female mice demonstrated a shorter latency
to jump as compared to male mice, at 20, 25, and 30 cm distances
(male vs. female: p < 0.001, F1,32 = 15.420; Fig. 2b). These mice were
then re-tested on the same task after the MCAO procedure to assess
stroke-induced deﬁcits.
3.3. Stroke induced deﬁcits in long jump
Although the stroke procedure successfully produced a functional deﬁcit, as measured by the cylinder test, no signiﬁcant
deﬁcits in jump success rate were observed three days after
the MCAO (n = 21) or sham (n = 13) surgery (sham vs. MCAO:
p = 0.193, F1,30 = 1.769; Fig. 3a). Furthermore, there were no significant sex × procedure interactions on this measure (sex × success
rate: p = 0.6018, F1,30 = 0.278). However, the induction of stroke did
produce a signiﬁcant increase in the latency to jump as compared to
the sham mice (sham vs. MCAO: p < 0.001, F1,30 = 40.554; Fig. 3b).
Moreover, this increase was seen in both male and female subjects, and no further sex × procedure interactions were observed
(sex × latency: p = 0.673, F1,30 = 0.182). These data suggest that the
long jump test is not able to sufﬁciently assess potential strokeinduced deﬁcits in hindlimb functionality in mice. However, the
lack of a deﬁcit in success rate, coupled with the increase in jump
latency may reﬂect a cognitive or affective, rather than a sensorimotor, deﬁcit in these mice.
3.4. Acute ﬂuoxetine treatment does not alleviate stroke induced
deﬁcits in long jump
One affective pathology that has frequently been associated
with stroke is post-stroke depression. Therefore, we tested whether
the acute administration of an anti-depressant, ﬂuoxetine, before
the long jump test would be sufﬁcient to blunt the increase in jump
latency produced by stroke. Given the basal sex differences in jump
latency, all treatment studies were conducted in male mice in order
to remove any confounding effects of sex on stroke induction or
ﬂuoxetine administration.
On post stroke day 3, male mice were treated with either saline
(n = 13) or ﬂuoxetine (10 mg/kg, n = 14) 30 min before the long jump

cylinder test conducted on day 4. Student’s t-test was used for statistical analyses. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Line represents pre-stroke baseline.

test. For statistical analyses, the data for all three post-stroke groups
(untreated, saline treated or ﬂuoxetine treated) were combined,
and a three way repeated measures ANOVA was used. There was
no effect of treatment on success rate (treatment × success rate:
p = 0.8874, F2,36 = 0.120; Fig. 4a). However, a main effect of treatment was observed in the latency to jump (treatment × latency:
p = 0.022, F2,36 = 4.232; Fig. 4b). Post hoc analyses revealed that
while the latency to jump for the untreated group was signiﬁcantly
higher than both the saline treated (p < 0.05) and ﬂuoxetine treated
(p < 0.01) groups, there were no further differences between the
saline and ﬂuoxetine treated mice (saline vs. ﬂuoxetine: p = 0.5073).

3.5. No differences in the elevated plus maze test
While these data suggest that the change in jump latency may
not necessarily be a marker of post-stroke depression, it is possible that this represents a shift in another affective modality, such
as anxiety. To explore this possibility, we used an EPM test to
measure differences in anxiety levels. First we tested for potential sex differences in basal anxiety between male (n = 12) and
female (n = 12) mice. Both groups spent an equal time exploring
the arms (total time: males: 253.8 ± 5.1 s, females: 252.1 ± 4.1 s)
and there were no signiﬁcant differences in either the ratio of

(untreated vs. ﬂuoxetine: **p < 0.01) groups, there were no further differences between the saline and ﬂuoxetine treated mice (saline vs. ﬂuoxetine: p = 0.5073). For statistical
analyses, the data for all three post-stroke groups (untreated, saline treated or ﬂuoxetine treated) was combined, and a three way repeated measures ANOVA was used. Post
hoc differences were determined using a Student’s t-test. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Gradient represents untreated post stroke male group from Fig. 3b.

open arm (males: 40.50 ± 2.16%, females: 37.12 ± 1.41%; p = 0.203;
Fig. 5b). Next we explored the effect of ischemia-induced stroke
on anxiety levels. In a cohort of male mice, we observed no effect
of stroke in either the time spent (baseline: 30.21 ± 3.21%, MCAO:
37.91 ± 8.14%; Fig. 5c), or the entries (baseline: 40.50 ± 2.16%,
MCAO: 46.45 ± 4.55%; Fig. 5d) into the open arm. Moreover,
ﬂuoxetine treatment did not further affect EPM behavior. All
groups spent an equal amount of time exploring both arms (baseline: 253.8 ± 5.1 s; MCAO + saline: 246.5 ± 8.5 s; MCAO + ﬂuoxetine:
248.9 ± 10.0 s). There was no effect of procedure or treatment on
the ratio of time spent in the open arm (procedure × treatment:
p = 0.635, F2,38 = 0.460), nor the ratio of entries into the open arm
(procedure × treatment: p = 0.330, F2,38 = 1.141).
4. Discussion
The aim of this study was to develop a novel long jump task
which could be used to assess deﬁcits in hindlimb functionality in
rodents after a neural injury, such as stroke. First we demonstrated
that although male and female mice exhibited no differences in
jump success rate, the female mice showed lower baseline jumping latencies at all distances measured. Moreover, this difference
in jump latency was not associated with any differences in basal
anxiety levels between the male and female mice. Next we tested

the effect of stroke on this behavior and found that while the induction of stroke did not affect the jump success rate in either group, it
signiﬁcantly increased jumping latencies in both male and female
mice. We then sought to identify the factors contributing to this
increase in jump latency by administering anti-depressants prior to
the long jump assay, as well as testing for potential changes in anxiety levels after stroke. Contrary to our hypothesis, the long jump
test was unable to detect stroke-induced sensorimotor deﬁcits in
hindlimb function. However, it did detect a potential psychological or cognitive deﬁcit, resulting in an increased latency to jump,
with great sensitivity. Although we were unable to attribute this
stroke-induced increase in jump latency to either depression or
anxiety in the current study, these results raise interesting questions about the potential mechanisms regulating this change that
may be addressed by future investigations.
The presence of a stroke induced deﬁcit in jump latency, but
not success rate, was an interesting ﬁnding. One explanation for
this phenomenon might be that the stroke induced by a unilateral
45 min MCAO procedure was not sufﬁcient to induce measurable
damage to the hindlimbs, and therefore did not affect the ability
to jump in these mice. Although, previous studies have shown that
strokes produced by transient and focal MCAO procedures can sufﬁciently induce measurable hindlimb damage, we did not use a
speciﬁc assay to directly measure hindlimb deﬁcits in the current
study (Schallert et al., 2000; Lim et al., 2008). Therefore, it is possible that future studies using longer occlusion times or a bilateral

vs. females: 25.01 ± 2.41%; p = 0.204) or (b) the ratio of entries into the open arm (males: 40.50 ± 2.16% vs. females: 37.12 ± 1.41%; p = 0.203). In male mice, all treatment
groups spent an equal amount of time exploring both arms (baseline: 253.8 ± 5.1 s; MCAO + saline: 246.5 ± 8.5 s; MCAO + ﬂuoxetine: 248.9 ± 10.0 s). There was no effect of
procedure or treatment on (c) the ratio of time spent in the open arm (baseline: 30.21 ± 3.21%, MCAO + saline: 37.91 ± 8.14%, MCAO + ﬂuoxetine: 36.61 ± 5.10%; p = 0.635,
F2,38 = 0.460), or (d) the ratio of entries into the open arm (baseline: 40.50 ± 2.16%, MCAO + saline: 46.45 ± 4.55%, MCAO + ﬂuoxetine: 47.70 ± 3.05%; p = 0.330, F2,38 = 1.141).

occlusion may be able to detect changes in jump success rate. Furthermore, the change in jump latency, but not success rate, may
also suggest that the stroke-induced damage could have produced
a cognitive rather than a sensorimotor alteration. Indeed, studies
have shown that ischemic insults can result in cognitive decline
(Shih et al., 2013). Therefore, it is possible that this shift in jump
latency may be a marker of altered cognitive function, resulting
from the induction of ischemic stroke, in these mice.
Post-stroke depression has been shown to increase cognitive
impairment and mortality after stroke. Furthermore, it has also
been shown to be the single strongest correlate of impairment in
activities of daily living (Robinson and Spalletta, 2010; Cojocaru
et al., 2013). As such, we sought to determine whether the increase
in jumping latency may be a marker of post-stroke depression.
Fluoxetine is one of the most widely used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) for the treatment of depression. There is also
evidence, both clinical and preclinical, that ﬂuoxetine treatment
may induce neuroprotection and attenuate stroke-induced spatial cognitive deﬁcits in rodents (Jolkkonen et al., 2000; Windle
and Corbett, 2005; Li et al., 2009; Lim et al., 2009), as well as,
improve motor recovery in human patients (Pariente et al., 2001;
Fruehwald et al., 2003; Choi-Kwon et al., 2006; Chollet et al., 2011)
alike. Moreover, acute ﬂuoxetine treatment has been shown to produce antidepressant effects in rodents (Liu et al., 2010). As such, we
tested whether the administration of ﬂuoxetine 30 min prior to the
long jump test was sufﬁcient to blunt the increase in long jump

latency in mice. We did not ﬁnd an effect of acute ﬂuoxetine on
long jump latency at a 10 mg/kg dose. While the saline and ﬂuoxetine treated mice displayed similar jump latencies, the untreated
mice had higher jump latencies, than both the saline and ﬂuoxetine
treated mice. This alteration may be a result of stress caused by the
i.p. administration of treatment solutions 30 min before the experiment. This observation further sheds light upon the sensitivity of
this test to potential changes in stress and anxiety levels following
the induction of ischemic stroke. In an additional cohort of animals
we tested the effects of a double dose of ﬂuoxetine (20 mg/kg) on
this measure, but this dose was also without effect on the strokeinduced increase in jump latency (data not shown).
While these results may suggest that the change in jump latency
is not a marker of post-stroke depression, it is also possible that
a single administration of ﬂuoxetine may not be sufﬁcient to
eliminate all depression-like symptoms in these mice. Indeed,
ﬂuoxetine is usually prescribed chronically for the treatment of
clinical depression and it often takes several weeks for the antidepressive effects to manifest themselves (Blier, 2003; Dulawa
et al., 2004). Such chronic treatment would entail daily ﬂuoxetine
injections over 14 or 21 days, which was not feasible in the current
study due to the low survival rates in post-ischemic mice over such
a long timeline. It is possible that the use of a rapid acting antidepressant such as ketamine (Browne and Lucki, 2013; Kavalali
and Monteggia, 2015) may yield better results in the post-stroke
mice. However, known models of depression, such as social defeat,

218

learned helplessness or chronic mild stress (McArthur and Borsini,
2006), which are not nuanced by added sensorimotor deﬁcits, and
can allow for chronic pharmacological treatment may serve as better tools to investigate the role of depression in the long jump
test.
Several studies have reported post-stroke anxiety as a widely
recognized disorder with a prevalence of 12–28% (Sharpe et al.,
1990; Burvill et al., 1995; Astrom, 1996). Moreover, there is also
evidence of sex-based differences in various measure of anxiety
in rodents (Johnston and File, 1991; Palanza, 2001; Võikar et al.,
2001), which could potentially explain the baseline differences
in jump latency between male and female mice. Therefore, we
sought to investigate whether the differences in jump latency can
be explained by concomitant differences in anxiety levels in these
mice. At baseline, we found no differences between the male and
female mice in either the ratio of time spent, or the ratio of entries,
into the open arms. Moreover, there were no measureable effects
of stroke induction or ﬂuoxetine treatment on the anxiety levels of
these mice. Thus, it is likely that the increase in jump latency cannot be explained by potential changes in anxiety levels. However,
it is also well known that tests of anxiety can vary in their reliability, and that despite its popularity as a classical test of anxiety, the
EPM test is certainly not a comprehensive measure of all types of
anxiety. Some deﬁciencies of the EPM test are discussed in the cited
reviews (Ramos, 2008; Haller and Alicki, 2012). Thus it is possible
that in this case the EPM test may not be sensitive enough to identify stroke-induced differences in anxiety, and that such differences
may be detected with greater sensitivity by other assays such as the
open ﬁeld test or the light/dark box test (Ramos, 2008). However,
given that MCAO induced stroke is not typically considered to be a
reliable model of anxiety, we did not pursue further investigation of
a potential role of anxiety in regulating long jump latency with this
model. Future studies employing established models of anxiety, or
pharmacological manipulations, aimed at increasing or decreasing
anxiety, will be better suited for this purpose.
In this study, we introduced a new test to measure long jump
behavior in mice. We showed that male and female mice differ in
their latency to initiate a jump. We found that while stroke did not
produce differences in jumping ability, it increased the latency to
jump in both male and female mice. We then tested whether these
differences could be attributed to post-stroke depression, using
pharmacological anti-depression treatment, or to anxiety, by measuring open arm exploration on the EPM test, but we were unable
to attribute the differences in latency to changes in these measures. It is clear that the long jump test measures a stroke-induced
behavioral change with great sensitivity. However, we have not
yet identiﬁed the mechanisms responsible for this change. Additional studies are needed to systematically explore the mechanisms
involved in the jump-making process. Once fully understood, the
long jump test may serve as an important addition to the battery
of assays used to assess neurological functions in rodents.
