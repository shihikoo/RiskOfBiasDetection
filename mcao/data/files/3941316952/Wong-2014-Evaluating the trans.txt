Evaluating the translational potential of
progesterone treatment following transient
cerebral ischaemia in male mice
Raymond Wong1, Claire L Gibson2*, David A Kendall3 and Philip MW Bath1

Abstract
Background: Progesterone is neuroprotective in numerous preclinical CNS injury models including cerebral
ischaemia. The aim of this study was two-fold; firstly, we aimed to determine whether progesterone delivery via
osmotic mini-pump would confer neuroprotective effects and whether such neuroprotection could be produced in
co-morbid animals.
Results: Animals underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. At the onset of reperfusion, mice were
injected intraperitoneally with progesterone (8 mg/kg in dimethylsulfoxide). Adult and aged C57 Bl/6 mice were
dosed additionally with subcutaneous infusion (1.0 μl/h of a 50 mg/ml progesterone solution) via implanted
osmotic minipumps. Mice were allowed to survive for up to 7 days post-ischaemia and assessed for general
well-being (mass loss and survival), neurological score, foot fault and t-maze performance. Progesterone reduced
neurological deficit [F(1,2) = 5.38, P = 0.027] and number of contralateral foot-faults [F(1,2) = 7.36, P = 0.0108] in adult,
but not aged animals, following ischaemia. In hypertensive animals, progesterone treatment lowered neurological
deficit [F(1,6) = 18.31, P = 0.0001], reduced contralateral/ipsilateral alternation ratio % [F(1,2) = 17.05, P = 0.0006] and
time taken to complete trials [F(1,2) = 15.92, P = 0.0009] for t-maze.
Conclusion: Post-ischemic progesterone administration via mini-pump delivery is effective in conferring functional
improvement in a transient MCAO model in adult mice. Preliminary data suggests such a treatment regimen was
not effective in producing a protective effect in aged mice. However, in hypertensive mice, who received
post-ischemic progesterone intraperitoneally at the onset of reperfusion had better functional outcomes than
control hypertensive mice.

Background
Stroke is the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and cancer, in the UK and the leading cause of
adult disability [1,2]. Few effective pharmacological treatments currently exist for acute ischaemic stroke. Although tissue plasminogen activator is effective, its use
is limited by its narrow treatment window [3]. Thus, a
main focus of stroke research is the development of
novel neuroprotective strategies to reduce the progression of neuronal damage.

Pre-clinical studies have shown progesterone to be
neuroprotective following cerebral ischaemia [4-13].
However, these pre-clinical stroke studies have tended to
administer it via repeated intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections
[14]. Although, a couple of studies have administered
progesterone subcutaneously via slow release pellets this
has only been the case where treatment commenced
prior to the onset of stroke [15,16]. Continuous postinjury progesterone administration has been shown to
produce enhanced benefit in traumatic brain injury
(TBI) as compared to repeated injections in a rat model
after neuronal damage [17]. Whether this benefit of continued post-ischemic administration is also true in a
model of stroke has not been demonstrated previously.

In addition, the majority of previously published studies investigating the potential protective effects of progesterone have focused on young, healthy adult animals.
However, co-morbidities are common in patients with
stroke and have been shown to be negatively correlated
with functional outcome [18]. Age is the single most important risk factor for stroke and the incidence of stroke
increases with age [19-21]. Another well recognised risk
factor for stroke is hypertension and pre-existing hypertension may be present in more than half of stroke patients [22,23]. Hypertension affects both small and large
vessels supplying the brain [24], and there is a strong association between hypertension and mortality following
stroke [25,26]. The impact of these co-morbidities has
not been fully investigated. Therefore, further investigation is required to explore the neuroprotective effectiveness of progesterone in these co-morbid animals.
The aim of the current study was to evaluate if progesterone would be effective in conferring neuroprotection
after the onset of experimental stroke when administered
via osmotic mini-pump in adult mice. In a prior study
from our laboratory, the pharmacokinetics of progesterone in mice using this dosing method were investigated,
and found it to be effective in delivering progesterone
to the target area of the brain [27]. The delivery of progesterone via osmotic mini-pumps in an experimental
stroke model, induced via middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), has not been demonstrated previously;
mini-pump delivery could offer a more suitable dosing

method with the advantages of reducing peaks and troughs
in drug levels, the stress associated with repeated injections, and diminishing levels of release over time as
seen with pellet implants. Infusion methods are commonly used clinically to maintain drug concentrations
and osmotic mini-pump release of agents at a constant
rate mimics this approach. In addition, we conducted
some proof-of-principle experiments to determine if progesterone administration, via mini-pump or intraperitoneal administration, was effective in aged or hypertensive
mice subjected to focal cerebral ischemia.

Results
Effect of progesterone infusion treatment on outcome
following MCAO in adult C57 Bl/6 mice

During the post-operative period a number of animals
were sacrificed for welfare reasons; 1 sham-operated
mouse (>20% body mass loss), 6 vehicle-treated animals
(4 for >20% body mass loss, 2 for barrel rolling), and 5
progesterone-treated animals (1 > 20% body mass loss,
3 for barrel rolling and one found dead the day following surgery). Analysis of survival data revealed no significant differences in survival rate between treatment
groups (P = 0.3286, Figure 1A). Table 1 shows the number of animals in each experimental group at each time
point. All animals lost body mass for the first few days
following either MCAO or sham surgery before beginning
to gain body mass. Both the progesterone- [F(1,7) = 27.03,
P = 0.0001] and vehicle-treated [F(1,7) = 13.79, P = 0.0004]

(A). Mortality data expressed using the Kaplan-Meier curve and analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel log-rank test revealed no significant difference
in survival between groups (P = 0.3286). In terms of body mass gain following surgery (B), both progesterone and vehicle treated groups gained
body mass at significantly slower rate compared to shams (P = 0.0004). Neurological deficit scoring (C) revealed that MCAO resulted in a significant
neurological deficit regardless of whether mice had received progesterone (P = 0.0049) or vehicle (P = 0.0002) treatment compared to shams.
Progesterone treatment reduced neurological deficit compared to vehicle treatment (P = 0.0271). Assessment of motor performance, using the
foot-fault test (D) revealed that progesterone treatment resulted in significantly fewer contralateral foot-faults compared to vehicle treated animals
(P = 0.0108). Number of animals per group is shown in parentheses, all data (B-D) are expressed as mean ± SEM, and * = P < 0.05.

groups gained body mass at a significantly slower rate
compared to shams. There were no significant differences
in body body mass gain between the progesterone and vehicle treated groups [F(1,7) = 1.23, P = 0.2699] (Figure 1B).
Following MCAO, a significant increase in the neurological score, indicative of a neurological deficit, was
observed in comparison to sham-operated controls, regardless of whether animals had received progesterone
[F(1,2) = 9.34, P = 0.005] or vehicle [F(1,2) = 19.12, P = 0.0002]
treatment. However, progesterone treatment significantly
reduced the neurological deficit present following MCAO
compared to vehicle treatment [F(1,2) = 5.38, P = 0.027
(Figure 1C). Unilateral foot-faults were expressed by the
number of contralateral foot-faults as a percentage of the
total errors made; a value of 50% represents an equal
number of errors made by both sides. For example, on day
1, shams revealed no functional deficit as they made, on
average, 51.27 ± 6.62 (mean ± SEM) errors on the contralateral side, whereas, following MCAO, a functional deficit
was observed. By day 7, progesterone treatment was
found to be beneficial in that it reduced the number of

contralateral foot-faults in comparison to vehicle treatment [F(1,2) = 7.36, P = 0.0108] (Figure 1D). The T-maze is
a test of cognition, including spatial learning and working
memory. There was no difference in T-maze performance
following either MCAO surgery (in comparison to shams)
or by drug treatment. The outcome measures used were:
alternation rate %, contralateral/ipsilateral ratio % and
time taken to complete trials (Table 2).
Effect of aging on the effectiveness of progesterone
treatment following MCAO

Ten aged C57 Bl/6 mice (five progesterone treated and
five vehicle treated) were subjected to 30 minutes of occlusion. In the progesterone treated group only one animal survived to the intended end of study, i.e. day 7
post-MCAO, one was found dead the following day
after surgery, and 3 were killed for welfare reasons (barrel rolling). The vehicle-treated group comprised two
animals surviving to day 7, one found dead the next day
after surgery, and two animals killed for welfare (one for
barrel rolling after surgery and another on the same day

groups in t-maze alternation %, but progesterone treated animals had a significantly greater contralateral goal arm preference than non-treated groups (P = 0.0006).

for inability to recover from surgery). There was no difference between treatment groups for overall survival
and body mass loss (Figure 2A and B). Also, no difference between treatment groups for neurological deficit
score the day after surgery (progesterone n =2, vehicle
n =4) was found (Figure 2C).
Effect of hypertension on outcome following MCAO and
progesterone treatment

All progesterone treated animals (five animals) survived
to the end of all functional end-points on day seven and
one untreated animal died on day three post-surgery
(four animals in untreated group prior surgery). Analysis of survival found no significant difference between
progesterone and non-treated animals (Figure 3A). All
animals lost body mass following surgery [F(1,7) = 13.53,
P = <0.0001], but no significant difference was found
between groups (Figure 3B). Neurological deficit analysis found progesterone treated mice had significantly
lower neurological deficit compared to non-treated animals [F(1,6) = 18.31, P = 0.0001] (Figure 3C). There was
no difference in contralateral foot slips between groups
in the foot fault test (Figure 3D). Analysis of t-maze
tasks found no difference in treatment groups in % alternation rate, but did find progesterone treatment to lower
contralateral/ipsilateral alternation ratio % [F(1,2) = 17.05,
P = 0.0006] and reduce the time taken to complete trials
for T-maze [F(1,2) = 15.92, P = 0.0009] (Table 2). Bonferroni
analysis of day 6 shows progesterone treatment significantly increased % left/right ratio (P = <0.05*). Nontreated animals took longer to complete t-maze than
progesterone treated animals on days 6 and 7 (P = 0.0009).
Bonferroni post-hoc analysis shows day 6 and 7 to be significant (both P = <0.05*).

Discussion
The current study shows that progesterone treatment,
initiated following the onset of MCAO and delivered
continually is beneficial in terms of promoting functional
recovery in young, adult healthy male mice. In the present study, our outcomes have focused on functional
measures, as clinical trials of novel stroke therapies use
functional measures as their primary end-point. In humans, the amount of structural damage resulting from
the stroke does not always correlate well with functional
impairment [28]. Thus, it is important for pre-clinical
studies to have functional measures relevant to stroke
outcome in patients. A major goal for the treatment of
stroke is for patients to be functionally independent and
so pre-clinical studies need to reflect the importance of
functional outcomes. Restoration of behavioural function needs to be demonstrated in the pre-clinical evaluation of any putative stroke therapy and from the results

reported here further longer-term assessments of recovery
are warranted.
Previous studies have reported the ability of progesterone to improve functional deficit following MCAO using
neurological deficit scales [5,10,15,29-31]. However, these
studies have tended to use a much simpler neurological
deficit scale which simply grades function by 5 (rats) or 6
(mice) levels ranging from ‘normal’ to ‘severely impaired’
[32,33]. In the current study, we utilised a 28-point neurological deficit score, first developed by Clark et al. [34],
which we believe is a more sensitive measure of neurological deficit. Functional deficits, as measured by the
foot-fault test, found progesterone treatment to be beneficial over time, by reducing the number of contralateral
foot-faults in comparison to vehicle treatment. In the
current study we chose a relative short occlusion time, in
comparison to other studies [6,7,15,16,29], in an attempt
to maximize survival following MCAO.
As well as affecting motor behaviours cerebral stroke
also commonly disrupts cognitive processes. In rodents,
cognitive processes can be assessed by a variety of tasks
including the T-maze which is a test of spatial learning
and working memory [35]. This behavioural test allows
the detection of one-sided spatial neglect and enables

both unchallenged locomotion and exploratory motivation to be observed [35]. It’s ability to detect differences
in cognitive processing following ischemic stroke have
been previously demonstrated [36-40]. For example, animals with ischaemic brain injury have a tendency to turn
ipsilaterally towards the damaged side during the t-maze
test and display behavioural asymmetry [41,42]. However, in the current study, thirty minutes of MCAO did
not appear to affect any of the outcome measures (e.g.
alternation rate, goal arm preference) associated with the
T-maze in in healthy adult animals. However, in comorbid animals where the effect of ischemia is exacerbated a deficit in T-maze performance was observed.
However, future studies using an extended range of behavioural tests, for example to assess sensorimotor neglect, grip strength etc., are also warranted following
progesterone treatment.
Although a number of published studies have reported
the protective effects of progesterone treatment for ischemic stroke very few report mortality data. One study
reported progesterone treatment to increase survival
after ischaemia [7], while others have reported no effect [4,15,29]. In the present study, no difference in
survival was found between treatment groups. In terms of

Wong et al. BMC Neuroscience 2014, 15:131
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/15/131

welfare measures, body mass can be a useful indicator of
general well-being and progesterone has been shown to
reduce body mass loss in some studies [7,9,10]. However,
in accordance with our study, some have reported that
body mass loss, although significant following MCAO, is
unaffected by progesterone treatment [5,15,29].
One aim of this study was to determine if sustained
progesterone delivery was able to offer neuroprotection
following cerebral ischemia as had been previously demonstrated for repeated administrations [6,7,43]. Our
previous pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that progesterone delivered via i.p. injection has a very short
half-life in both plasma and brain [27] but high progesterone concentrations in the brain can be achieved via
mini pump infusion. There have only a few studies, involving progesterone and experimental stroke, which
have reported infusion delivery in rats [4] and mice [15].
However, both of these studies initiated progesterone
treatment prior to the onset of MCAO whereas in the
current study progesterone treatment began following
occlusion. The current study demonstrates this method
of administration to be beneficial in terms of reducing
neurological deficit and improving motor function. Lack
of protection in some outcome measures, but not others,
may be due to either a dose effect or the length of initial
occlusion. Although, increasing the progesterone dose
might not necessarily result in greater neuroprotection
as some studies have used higher doses of progesterone
(10-32 mg/kg via i.p. injection) but found no greater
beneficial effect [5,11,44]. Chen et al. found 8 mg/kg
but not 4 mg/kg or 32 mg/kg to be neuroprotective [5],
indicating a relatively narrow dose–response window.
Clearly it will be important to determine, in future experiments, whether there is a similar narrow therapeutic window when progesterone is delivered by loading dose and
mini-pump infusion, avoiding the peaks and troughs in
tissue concentrations produced by repeated injections.
A second purpose of this study was to conduct some
proof-of-principle studies in co-morbid animals. In humans, age is a predictor of worse outcome following
stroke and this investigation has also shown this to be
true in aged animals. Aged animals were very susceptible
to MCAO and the majority of aged animals were found
dead or were killed for welfare reasons the following day
after surgery. Mortality is expected to be higher in older
animals compared to younger ones and this has been
shown in rats, where mortality immediately post-stroke
was found to be low in young animals (6%, 3–4 months)
but high in old rats (44%, 18–20 months) [45]. In the
current study, the majority of deaths were due to animals being killed for welfare reasons (60%), rather than
animals found dead. There was no difference in outcomes between treatment groups in aged animals, although this may be due to lack of statistical power from

Page 6 of 10

high mortality in aged animals. Studies have not been previously performed in aged mice that are as old as the ones
investigated here (15–16 months of age), which is a phase
leaving middle to old age. Middle age, in both mice and
rats, is considered to be 10–15 months and old age is considered to be 18–24 months. A limited number of studies
have investigated neuroprotection of progesterone in
rodents at middle and old age, but most have initiated
treatment prior to occlusion and found conflicting results. For example, Toung et al. found female rats aged
14–18 months did not benefit from pre-MCAO treatment with progesterone [46], while Alkayed et al. using
16 month old female rats found progesterone to be
beneficial when administered prior to MCAO [4]. In
addition, Gibson et al. [29] used 12 month old female
mice in which post-MCAO treatment with progesterone was found to be protective in terms of reducing the
lesion volume but didn’t improve neurological outcome.
In aged (24 months) rats, administration of progesterone
post-occlusion did improve both infarct damage and neurological function [30]. Studies of progesterone and experimental stroke involving aged animals are limited,
particularly for the dosing of animals after the start of
occlusion.
In terms of co-morbidities hypertension is also an important risk factor for ischemic stroke and thought to
be present in more than half of stroke patients [22,23].
There is a strong association between hypertension and
mortality following stroke [25,26], thus we conducted
some preliminary experiments in hypertensive animals.
As the outcome in hypertensive mice was expected to be
worse we chose a protocol believed to reduce the impact
on animal welfare which included a shorter duration
time and a one-off intraperitoneal administration of progesterone. This is supported by the fact that hypertensive animsl did display a high percentage loss of body
mass in comparison to other animal groups although only
showed a relative low neurological deficit in response to
the stroke. Progesterone treatment in hypertensive animals was found to be beneficial in reducing neurological
deficit, which concurs with work found in hypertensive
rats [16]. Although the foot-fault and T-maze tests did not
show any significant difference following progesterone
treatment in hypertensive mice progesterone treated animals had a preference to turn towards the contralateral
side whereas the prediction would be that animals with ischaemic brain injury have a tendency to turn ipsilaterally
towards the damaged side during t-maze and other tests
of behavioural asymmetry [41,42]. Care must be taken
with these findings in hypertensive animals, as our comparison group did not receive vehicle. Progesterone was
dissolved in DMSO, which has been shown to have neuroprotective properties [47]. Hence, it cannot be confirmed
on the level neuroprotection is attributed to progesterone

Wong et al. BMC Neuroscience 2014, 15:131
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/15/131

or DMSO and so further investigation is required to determine this. In addition, alternative mouse models of
hypertension, e.g. rennin-dependent, may be worth investigating in comparison to the BPH/2 mice used here.
Studies investigating the neuroprotective potential of
drugs in adult healthy animals in experimental stroke do
not represent the demographic of patients, which frequently have co-morbidities [18]. Therefore, is important
to utilise co-morbid animals in the research of experimental stroke. Also, the presence of co-morbidities, might
attenuate neuroprotective effects in some drugs, as seen
with hypertension and the experimental neuroprotective
agent NXY-059 [48]. In this current preliminary study,
only the risk factors of age and hypertension were investigated but other significant risk factors of stroke that were
not investigated here include; obesity [49], diabetes [50]
and gender [51], which are also overlooked in experimental stroke studies. Also, this study has failed to take into
account the combination of risk factors such as age and
gender. It would be useful to consider, that whilst premenopausal females represent the population group with
the lowest risk of stroke, post-menopausal females represent the group at higher risk [51]. Therefore, further investigation is needed in aged female animals along with
long-term functional/pathological assessment of outcome
which will also permit the study of the effect of neuronal
plasticity on recovery.

Conclusions
Progesterone treatment, initiated post-ischemia, was effective on conferring functional improvement in healthy,
adult mice. In addition, such protective effects were observed when delivery of progesterone was sustained thus
negating the requirement for repeated injections which
results in peaks and troughs of progesterone levels. Any
future clinical trials evaluating neuroprotection of progesterone in stroke would need to use a method of dosing that achieved a steady state concentration lasting
several days, e.g. infusion or long-acting vaginal/rectal
administration. Aged animals have an increased sensitivity to MCAO and did not display, in the outcomes measured here, any benefit from progesterone treatment.
Hypertensive BPH/2 mice are a potential hypertensive
model and had better functional outcomes after treatment with intraperitoneally administered progesterone,
compared to non-treated hypertensive animals.
Methods
Animals

Experiments were carried out in accordance with the
UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 (Project
License 40/3207) and were approved by the University
of Nottingham ethics review process. Twenty five adult
male C57 Bl/6 mice (15–25 weeks) were used, weighing

Page 7 of 10

between 25.9 and 41.2 g at the time of injection. The
aged group was comprised of 15 aged male C57 Bl/6
mice (61–65 weeks), weighing between 34.10 and 46.5 g
at the time of injection. Nine male BPH2/2 (hypertensive) mice (28–37 weeks) were used, weighing between
21.9 and 34.8 g at the time of occlusion (5 progesterone
treated and 4 non-treated animals). No differences were
seen in body weight between treatment groups. All mice
were assigned a code by a non-experimenter and assigned randomly to different treatment groups. During
all surgical procedures and behavioural tests the experimenter was blinded to treatment.
Focal cerebral ischaemia

Anaesthesia was induced by inhalation of 4% isoflurane
(in 100% Oxygen) and maintained by inhalation of 1.5%
isoflurane. Body temperature was monitored throughout
surgery (via rectal probe) and maintained at 37°C ± 0.5°C
using a heating blanket (Harvard Apparatus, Edenbridge,
Kent, UK). Laser Doppler flowmetry (Moor Instruments,
Sussex, UK) was used to monitor cerebral blood flow.
Focal cerebral ischaemia was induced by middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) as previously described [6].
Briefly, a small incision was made in the skin overlying
the temporalis muscle and a 0.7-mm flexible laser-Doppler
probe (model P10) was positioned on the superior part
of the temporal bone (6 mm lateral and 2 mm posterior
from bregma), secured by superglue (Loctite). A midline incision was made on the ventral surface of the
neck and the right common carotid artery isolated and
ligated. The internal carotid artery and the pterygopalatine artery were temporarily occluded using a microvascular clip (Ohwa Tsusho Co., Tokyo, Japan). A nylon
filament (Drennan, Stridgewarer, UK), exposed to heat
to give a diameter of 180 μm, was introduced into the
internal carotid artery via an incision in the common
carotid artery. The filament was advanced approximately
10 mm distal to the carotid bifurcation, beyond the origin
of the middle cerebral artery. Relative cerebral blood flow
(CBF) was monitored for the first 5 minutes following
MCAO, during which time relative CBF had to reduce to
at least 70% of pre-ischaemic values for inclusion, before
mice were allowed to return to their home cage. After 15
(hypertensive animals) to 30 minutes of occlusion (adult
and aged animals), mice were re-anesthetised and the occluding filament was withdrawn back into the common
carotid artery to allow reperfusion to take place. At this
stage drugs were administered and osmotic mini-pumps
implanted (see drug treatment below). Relative cerebral
blood flow was monitored for an additional 5 minutes before the wound was sutured and mice were allowed to recover from the anaesthesia at 22°C. The relative cerebral
blood flow had to rise to at least 50% of pre-ischaemic
values for mice to be included in the study and subject to

Wong et al. BMC Neuroscience 2014, 15:131
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/15/131

further analyses (and independent of which treatment they
received). Sham-operated mice underwent the same surgical procedure, except that the filament was not advanced
far enough to occlude the middle cerebral artery and they
received empty mini-pumps.
Drug treatment

Following random allocation, mice were injected intraperitoneally, at the onset of reperfusion, with a ‘loading
dose’ of either progesterone (USP grade, 8 mg/kg in a
solution of 16 mg/ml in 100% DMSO, Sigma, St Louise,
MO, U.S.A) or vehicle (100% DMSO). Mini-pumps, with
an infusion rate of 1.0 μl/hr and a reservoir with up to
3 days delivery capacity (Alzet 1003D), were loaded with
progesterone solution (50 mg/ml progesterone dissolved
at 37°C in 100% DMSO only) or 100% DMSO (placebo)
as previously described [27]. The pumps were submerged
in 0.9% sterile saline solution at 37°C over night in order
to prime them so that progesterone was delivered immediately after implantation. Mini-pumps were implanted
subcutaneously in the back immediately following the onset of reperfusion and administration of the initial loading
dose (progesterone or vehicle) as stated above. Hypertensive BPH/2 mice only received the intraperitoneal injection of the ‘loading dose’ of progesterone at the onset of
reperfusion.
Assessment of general well-being

After surgery, mice were weighed every day for 7 days as
an indication of their general well-being [7]. Body mass
data are presented as a percent change compared with
body mass on the day of surgery. Survival rates of animal
groups are also presented as % compared to the number
of animals undergoing surgery.
Neurological deficits

Animals were scored neurologically for focal deficits
with the use of a 28-point neurological scoring system
based from Clark et al. 1998 [34]. This 28-point scale
awards a score of 0–4 (0 = normal, 4 = most severely affected) on 7 different characteristics by a variety of assessment methods: (i) body symmetry – assessed by
observation on open bench, (ii) gait – assessed by observation on open bench, (iii) climbing – assessed by observing gripping at 45°, (iv) circling behaviour – assessed
by observation on open bench, (v) front limb symmetry –
assessed via tail suspension, (vi) compulsory circling –
assessed by allowing front limbs to be placed on bench
during tail suspension, and, (vii) whisker response –
assessed via light touch from behind.
Foot fault

As previously described [7] at 24 h, 48 h and 7 days after
MCAO or sham surgery, mice were placed on an elevated

Page 8 of 10

grid surface (30 × 35 × 31 cm) with grid openings of
2.5 cm2. During locomotion on the grid, the number of
foot faults made by the ipsilateral and contralateral limbs
was counted. Ipsilateral refers to those limbs on the same
side of the body i.e. right, as which the vessel occlusion
took place whereas contralateral limbs refers to those on
the side of the body opposite to where vessel occlusion occurred. Tests consisted of 3 trials of 1 minute each with
an interval of 1 minute between trials. The foot faults are
expressed as the number of errors made by the contralateral side limbs in % of the total errors made.
T-maze

The T-maze consists of 3 arms made of grey Perspex,
each 41.5 cm long and 6 cm wide, surrounded by walls
of transparent Perspex (15 cm high). The start box
(6 cm x 7.5 cm) is located at the bottom of the central
arm. The start box and the entrance of each arm can be
closed by vertical sliding doors. Mice were subjected to a
series of 1 habituation period and 7 trials separated by
5 second intervals. The habituation period consists of
1 minute during which the mouse was left to explore the
entire maze and allowed to return to the start position.
At the start of a trial the door is opened and the mice
have the option of entering either the left or right arm.
The mice were then left in the arm of choice for 5 seconds and recorded before being allowed to return to the
start box. If they did not freely return to the start box
or remained stationary for 15 seconds, they are gently
nudged to avoid stress of handling. Alternation rate
(% alternation), which assesses the willingness of mice
to explore a new environment, i.e. whether they prefer
to visit a new arm of the maze rather than a familiar
arm, along with contralateral/ipsilateral (% contralateral
ipsilateral ratio) of arm choice relative to stroke hemisphere were measured. The total time was recorded on
how long the animals took to complete the 7 trials. T-maze
was conducted on day 7 after surgery for adult and aged
mice and days 5, 6 and 7 for hypertensive mice.
Statistical analysis

All data are expressed as means ± standard error of the
means (SEM). Survival data was analysed by KaplanMeier curve and Mantel-Haenszel log-rank test to identify differences. All other experiments conducted over a
period of days (body mass, neurological score and foot
fault) were analysed by two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) for differences according to time and treatment. The data from the T-maze was analysed using
one-way ANOVA to identify differences according to
treatment. Table 1 shows the number of animals in each
experimental group at each time point. Post hoc analyses
were carried out using Bonferroni tests. Data analysis

Wong et al. BMC Neuroscience 2014, 15:131

was conducted using GraphPad Prism Version 5.0 for
windows (GraphPad Software). The criterion for statistical significance was P <0.05.
Compliance with ethics requirements

All institutional and national guidelines for the care and
use of laboratory animals were followed.
