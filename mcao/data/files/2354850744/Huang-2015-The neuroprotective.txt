Ischemic stroke is the third leading cause of death and the main reason for severe disabilities in the
world today. N2, 4 e (2 e (1H e imidazol e 1 e yl) ethoxy) e 3 e methoxybenzoic acid is considered as
a novel potent agent for cerebral ischemia due to its effect in preventing neuronal cell death after
ischemic stroke.
In the present study, we investigated the post-ischemic neuroprotective effect of N2 and its underlying
mechanisms. Using a MCAO rat model, we found that N2 reversed brain infarct size, reduced cerebral
edema and decreased the neurological deficit score signiﬁcantly. Moreover, N2 diminished TUNEL positive cells, down-regulated bax expression and up-regulated bcl-2 expression notably. In addition, we
evaluated the oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury induced neuron cell death in rat
primary cortical neuron and assessed the neuroprotective effect of our drug. N2 increased cell viability,
ameliorated neuron cell injury by decreasing LDH activity, and inhibited cell apoptotic rate while suppressed apoptotic signaling via inhibiting the bax expression, and elevating the bcl-2 expression.
Furthermore, the neuroprotective effect of N2 was associated with the PI3K/Akt pathway which was
proved by the use of PI3K inhibitor LY294002.
The combination of our ﬁndings disclosed that N2 can be used as an effective neuroprotective agent for
ischemic stroke due to its signiﬁcant effect on preventing neuronal cell death after cerebral ischemia
both in vivo and in vitro and the effectiveness was dose dependent.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke, which accounts for 85 percent of all stroke
cases (Gouriou et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2012) is one of the leading
causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide (Zhao et al., 2013) and
it is disastrous for the afﬂicted individual. Despite of considerable
advances have been achieved in the understanding of ischemic
stroke, it is still one of the focus areas of current cardiovascular
researches today because of its limited therapeutic options (Lv
et al., 2011).

Within a certain time after ischemia, reperfusion can lead to
profound cerebral microcirculatory damage and even death of
neurons (Sun et al., 2010). Furthermore, the damage and even death
of neuron cells are important causes of subsequent disability and
mortality after ischemic stroke (Wang et al., 2014). Among all the
leading causes of neuronal cell death after brain ischemia/reperfusion, apoptosis is an important factor (Wang et al., 2014), thus
agents that can prevent neuron apoptosis are believed to have
therapeutic potentials toward brain ischemia/reperfusion.
N2 has a chemical name 4 e (2 e (1H e imidazol e 1 e yl)
ethoxy) e 3 e methoxybenzoic acid (Fig. 1) (284.24 g/mol, purity e
99.2%, water soluble) and the similar structure as Ozagrel, which is
a selective thromboxane synthetase inhibitor that can reduce the
production of TXA2. So we predicate that, N2 may also have the
same ability to reduce the production of TXA2 and in turn suppress
the apoptotic pathway after ischemia/reperfusion.
In the pathogenisis of cerebral ischemia, thromboxane A2 (TXA2)
is produced from AA via the actions of cyclooxygenase (COX) and

incision was made into external carotid artery near bifurcation, to insert a nylon
monofilament (0.26 mm external diameter). The nylon monofilament was advanced
up to approximately 18 mm from bifurcation to occlude the middle cerebral artery.
After 2 h of MCAO, reperfusion was accomplished by withdrawing the filament. The
body temperature of rats was maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5  C by using a heating pad and
lamp. The rats of the control group received all the surgical procedures without the
filament inserted.

thromboxane synthetase (TXS), while the bond of thromboxane A2
and its receptor can result in the activation of different signaling
cascades that regulate the cell adhesion, proliferation, cell survival
and apoptosis (Cathcart et al., 2010). The excessive formation of
TXA2 can inhibit the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt)
pathway, that can cause the neuron cell death. So the reduction of
TXA2 can up-regulate the activity of the PI3K/Akt pathway and in
turn prevent cell apoptosis in the cell culture (Ninomiya et al.,
2010). Neuronal apoptosis, one of the core cellular mechanisms of
cell death after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury can be
prevented by the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway (Ma et al.,
2013). Moreover, the anti-apoptosis mechanisms of Akt involve in
inhibition of certain proteins, such as bcl-2 and bax (Sun et al.,
2011). Bcl-2, a downstream component of the PI3K/Akt signaling
pathway, play a key role in modulating cellular survival/death that
is caused by ischemia/reperfusion injury (Adams and Cory, 2007).
Conversely, bax, a pro-apoptotic protein is expressing abundantly
during the cell death. Therefore, the balance of protein levels between the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 protein and pro-apoptotic bax
protein is very important in modulating apoptotic cell death (Sun
et al., 2011).
In the experimental researches of ischemic stroke, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) is considered as one of the best
models to mimic human ischemic stroke and has been widely used
in numerous studies in gerbils and rats (Carmichael, 2005), while
the oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model was
used as the in vitro model to mimic ischemia/reperfusion (Vieira
et al., 2014).
In this study, we aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect
of N2 using rat MCAO model, and further elucidated the possible
molecular mechanism of N2 by performing OGD/R model on rat
cortical neurons, in order to provide information for the future
studies of the agents that could prevent neuronal cell death caused
by ischemia/reperfusion.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Male Sprague Dawley (200e250 g body weight) rats were purchased from
Jiangsu Province Laboratory Animal Center. All animals were acclimated for at least 1
week before the study, under the standard laboratory animal facility (25  C, 12 h
light/dark cycle) with free access to food and water. All studies were in compliance
with institutional guidelines of China Pharmaceutical University (Nanjing, China),
and all experiments were approved by Animal Ethics Committee of China Pharmaceutical University.

Brain infarct area was evaluated by using 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) (Lingjin Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China) staining method as previously described (Lv
et al., 2011). In brief, 24 h after reperfusion, rats were sacrificed under deep anesthesia and brains were removed promptly. Then 5 pieces of (2-mm thick) coronal
sections were collected from the brain. The brain sections were stained in 2% TTC at
37  C for 15 min in the dark and photographed. Viable brain tissue areas turned into
dark red because of the intact mitochondrial function and the infarct areas remain
unstained. The infarct tissue areas were measured by Image-Pro Plus software and
obtained the ﬁnal results using following formula: The infarct area ¼ (total infarct
area/whole brain section area)  100%.
The cerebral edema was detected using previously published methods with a
few modiﬁcations (Mdzinarishvili et al., 2007). The wet weight of brain samples
were weighed on an electronic analytical balance immediately, while the dry weight
of the samples was obtained after dried in an oven at 110  C for 24 h. The cerebral
edema ¼ (wet weight  dry weight)/wet weight  100%.
Twenty four hours after MCAO, neurological deﬁcit scores in the control group,
vehicle group, Clopidogrel group, and N2 treated groups were measured according
to the method of Bederson et al. (Bederson et al., 1986) by an individual who was
blinded to the experimental treatment groups. Five categories of motor neurological
functions were scored: 0: no observable neurological deﬁcits, 1: torso turning to the
contra lateral side when lifted by the tail, 2: decreased resistance to lateral push, 3:
circling or walking to the right side, 4: unable to walk spontaneously and a
depressed level of consciousness.
2.4. TUNEL assay
Twenty four hours following MCAO, in situ detection of apoptotic cell death after
ischemia was performed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining according to previously published
methods with a few modiﬁcations (Lee et al., 2014). Rats of each group were
anesthetized and under-went perfusion with normal saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to ﬁx the tissue. Brain of
each animal was removed and post-ﬁxed in 4%paraformaldehyde for 24 h. Coronal
brain sections (5-mm thick) were cut by a microtome for subsequent use. For TUNEL
assay, brain sections were stained using TUNEL kit according to the manufacturer's
instruction by a person who was blinded to the group assignment of the experimental animals. Photographs were taken at a magniﬁcation of 400  and the images
were analyzed using Image-Pro Plus software.
2.5. Immunohistochemical staining of bcl-2 and bax in the rat brain
Twenty four hours following MCAO, the detection of bcl-2 and bax was performed using immunohistochemical staining according to previously published
methods with a few modiﬁcations (Li et al., 2010). Each rat was anesthetized and
perfused with normal saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The brain of each rat was removed and preserved in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 24 h. Brain sections (5-mm) were sequentially washed with
water and incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 10 min. After washing with
PBS, each section was blocked with 0.5% normal goat serum for 30 min before using.
The brain sections were incubated with the diluted (1:100) primary antibodies
(Anti-bax and Anti-bcl-2) overnight at 4  C. After washing in PBS, the brain sections
were exposed to the secondary antibody, and then visualized using 3, 3’-diaminobenzidine hydrochloride (DAB). Brain slices were then counterstained using
hematoxylin, dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylene and mounted. Photographs
were taken at a magniﬁcation of 400 and the analyses of the results were performed using Image-Pro Plus software.
2.6. Culture of rat cortical neuron cells

2.2. Implementation of MCAO model
All animals were fasted for 8e12 h prior to the surgery with free access to water.
Forty eight male rats (250e300 g) were divided into 6 groups randomly: N2 (15 mg/
kg), N2 (7.5 mg/kg), N2 (3.75 mg/kg), Clopidogrel (7.5 mg/kg) group, control group
and vehicle group. N2 and Clopidogrel were administrated orally and 30 min after
the last administration, rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg, i.p.)
and MCAO surgery was performed according to Longa et al. with a few modiﬁcations
(Longa et al., 1989). The right common carotid artery, internal carotid artery and
external carotid artery were exposed by a midline incision of the neck with careful
protection of the vagus nerve. External carotid artery was ligated close behind carotid bifurcation and a temporary clip was applied to common carotid artery. An

The experiment was performed using a previously described method (Brewer
et al., 1993) with a few modiﬁcations. The primary cultures of cortical neurons
were obtained under sterile conditions from E15e18 embryos of pregnant SpragueeDawley rats. Then neurons were digested in 1000 mL cysteine (0.25%), stopped
by adding 200 mL fetal bovine serum (FBS) and gently resuspended in MEM medium
containing 10% (v/v) FBS, and dissociated properly. After ﬁltration, the cortical tissues were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and then resuspended in MEM þ10%
(v/v) FBS. Discarded the supernatant and then cortical neuron cells were plated at
1  106 g/ml onto 24 or 6 well culture plates pre-coated with cell adhesion solution
(0.5%) (Applygen Technologies Inc, Beijing, China). The culture plates were stored in
a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37  C, for 6 h (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA). Then,

14

the culture media was replaced by Neurobasal Media supplemented with 2% B27 (v/
v). Cortical neurons were maintained in primary culture for 6e8 days for use in the
following experiments.
2.7. In vitro implementation of OGD/R model
After 6e8 days in culture, the cortical neurons could be used in the following
experiments. The OGD/R model was performed according to Caughlan with a few
modiﬁcations (Caughlan et al., 2004). Cortical neurons were divided into 6 groups:
control group, vehicle group, Ozagrel (10 mM) group and N2 (3 mM, 10 mM and 30 mM)
group. Cells were cultured in Neurobasal Media and except the vehicle and control,
other groups were incubated with drugs. One day later, the Neurobasal Media was
drawn from each well, and then cells were washed twice using EBSS (Earle's
balanced salt solution). Twenty four hours later the control group was replaced by
EBSS containing 6 mM glucose while other groups were replaced by Na2S2O4
(20 mM, PH 7.2) and incubated for 1.5 h at 37  C. Finally, all the groups were replaced
by normal Neurobasal Media and incubated for 2 h.
2.8. MTT assay
After OGD/R model was made in cortical neurons, cell viability was assessed using
a phase contrast microscopy. MTT assay was performed according to the method of
Mosmann (Mosmann, 1983) with a few modiﬁcations. 50 mL of MTT solution (5 g/L)
(Sigma, MO, USA) was added to each well and incubated at 37  C for 4 h. After that, each
well was replaced by 200 mL DMSO and MTT-formazan crystals were dissolved. Finally,
the absorbance of 150 mL of liquid in each well was measured at 570 nm using a
microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd., China) and compared with control group.
2.9. LDH assay
LDH release in the supernatant was detected as an index of cell membrane
integrity. The LDH assay was performed according to methods described previously
with a few modiﬁcations (Zhang et al., 2012). After OGD/R model was performed in
cortical neurons, LDH release was measured using a rat LDH assay kit (Jiancheng,
Nanjing, China) following manufacturer's instructions.
2.10. Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis
After OGD/R model was established, cortical neuron cells were collected from
each group. Apoptosis assay was performed according to previously published
methods with a few modiﬁcations (Xu et al., 2013). The cells were washed twice
with cold PBS (4  C), and resuspended in 200 mL staining buffer at a density of
1  l06/mL. 5 mL of Annexin V-FITC (20 mg/mL) (Beijing Bowlinman Sunshine Science
& Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) was added to the neuron cells under gentle
mixing and incubated at room temperature for 15 min in the dark. Then 10 mL PI
solution (50 mg/mL) (Beijing Bowlinman Sunshine Science & Technology Co., Ltd,
Beijing, China) was added to the neuron cells and incubated for 5 min. The preincubated cells were detected by ﬂow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur, Becton, Dickinson and Company, USA) and the percentage of apoptotic and normal cells were
calculated by CellQuest Pro software.
2.11. Western blot
The cortical neurons induced by OGD/R injury and rat brains tissues after MCAO
surgery was used for detecting the protein expression (Chen et al., 2014). Cells and

tissues were lysed in a RIPA lysis buffer with PMSF and phosphatase inhibitor (v/
v ¼ 98:1:1) separately. The amount of protein was determined by BCA protein assay
kit. An equal amount of sample (50 mg) was electrophoresed in 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes. The blots were blocked with TBST buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM TriseHCl,
and 0.05% Tween-20) containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h and incubated with diluted
primary antibody bcl-2 (1:1000) (Bioworld Technology, Inc, Nanjing, China), bax
(1:1000) (Bioworld Technology, Inc, Nanjing, China), b-actin (1:1000, internal control), phospho-Akt (1:1000) (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, USA), Akt (1:1000)
(Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, USA). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai, China)
was used as 2dry antibody. The membranes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. The analyses of the results were performed using
Quantity One program, and the bcl-2 and bax expression levels were normalized to
b-actin, while the p-Akt level was expressed as a ratio of p-Akt to total Akt.
After the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (25 mM) (SigmaeAldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO,
USA) was added, bcl-2, bax and p-Akt were detected again by the same method as
previously described.
2.12. Statistical analysis
All data were represented as means ± SD. Statistical analysis of more than two
groups was performed using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by
Dunnett's test. The statistical analysis of two groups was performed using the Student t-test. *P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

3. Results
3.1. The effect of N2 on cerebral infarction
TTC staining was used to detect the cerebral infarct rate in the
rat brain after 24 h of reperfusion. The cerebral infarct area of rats in
the vehicle group increased signiﬁcantly (33.85 ± 0.05%) compared
with the control group. The cerebral infarct area of N2 (3.75 mg/kg,
7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg) groups were 27.88 ± 0.03, 19.81 ± 0.05 and
14.30 ± 0.03 respectively. The data showed that, the cerebral infarct
area of rats in all groups of N2 decreased signiﬁcantly compared
with the vehicle group (Fig. 2). Moreover, the positive drug Clopidogrel also signiﬁcantly decreased the cerebral infarct area of rats,
but compared with the high dose of N2 (15 mg/kg), the function of
Clopidogrel was less signiﬁcant.
3.2. The effect of N2 on cerebral edema
After MCAO, the ratio of cerebral edema in the vehicle group
was increased signiﬁcantly (80.89%) compared with the control
group. Cerebral edema of N2 administered groups, 3.75 mg/kg,

Fig. 2. The effect of N2 on cerebral infarction After orally administrated with different concentrations of N2 (15 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/kg, 3.75 mg/kg) or Clopidogrel (7.5 mg/kg), the MCAO
was performed in rats. The vehicle group, N2 group and Clopidogrel group underwent MCAO while the control group underwent the same surgical procedure without the filament
inserted. (a) The photos of rat brain were taken by a digital camera after 24 h of the MCAO. A was the control group, B was the vehicle group, C was the Clopidogrel group, D was the

(n ¼ 8). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 compared with vehicle group, q P < 0.05, qq P < 0.01 compared with Clopidogrel group.

J. Huang et al. / Neuropharmacology 95 (2015) 12e21

7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg were 77.89%, 77.62% and 77.12% respectively, demonstrating that N2 could attenuate the edema signiﬁcantly compared with the vehicle group (Fig. 3).
3.3. The effect of N2 on neurological deﬁcit score
After MCAO, the neurological deﬁcit score increased notably in
the vehicle group compared with the control group. The neurological deﬁcit score of rats in the N2 (3.75 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/kg and
15 mg/kg) groups were 2.1, 1.9 and 1.8 respectively. Therefore, the
neurological deﬁcit score of rats in the N2 administrated group
decreased signiﬁcantly compared with the vehicle group (Fig. 3).
3.4. The effect of N2 on TUNEL assay
TUNEL staining was performed to identify neuronal DNA damage in the present study. TUNEL-positive cells were observed in the
cerebral cortex of the rats after MCAO. The TUNEL-positive cells
increased markedly in the vehicle group (79.00) compared with the

15

control group (5.75). Pre-administration of N2 (3.75 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/
kg and 15 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly reduced the percentage of TUNELpositive cells (67.75, 30.75, and 20.50 respectively) (Fig. 4)
demonstrating that N2 has the ability to prevent apoptotic cell
death after cerebral ischemia.
3.5. The effect of N2 on immunohistochemical analysis
Bcl-2 and bax are crucial proteins involved in the process of
apoptosis. Activation of apoptotic pathways leads to increased
expression of bax and decreased expression of bcl-2 showing that,
the expression of bcl-2 and bax are directly related to neuronal cell
apoptosis. To detect the expression of bcl-2 and bax, immunohistochemistry analysis was applied on parafﬁn embedded sections of rats after cerebral ischemia. Occlusion of the middle
cerebral artery decreased the expression of bcl-2 and increased
the expression of bax notably compared with the control group.
Conversely, Pre-administration of N2 markedly elevated the bcl-2
expression (22.75, 53.63 and 69.13, respectively for the 3.75 mg/
kg, 7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg dose of the N2) and reduced the bax
expression (66.63, 34.63 and 25.38, respectively for the 3.75 mg/
kg, 7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg dose of the N2) after arterial occlusion
(Fig. 5).
3.6. The effect of N2 on MTT assay
The result of the MTT assay indicated the cell survival rate in
response to the drug administration. After OGD/R injury, the cell
viability of cortical neurons in the vehicle group decreased significantly compared with the control group. However, pretreatment
with different concentrations of N2 (3 mM, 10 mM and 30 mM) for
24 h had a dose-dependent protective effect on cell viability
against OGD/R induced damage of cortical neurons (Fig. 6).
Furthermore, 30 mM and10 mM of N2 (85.09% and 74.59% respectively) showed superior protective ability via sustaining a higher
cell survival rate when compared with Ozagrel (66.05%) in OGD/R
model.
3.7. The effect of N2 on LDH assay
In order to detect the protective effect of N2 on cortical neuron
cells, LDH assay kit was used to evaluate the LDH activity which is
considered as an index of cell injury. The LDH release of cortical
neurons in the vehicle group signiﬁcantly increased to 366.62 while
the LDH level of the control group was 90.58. Pretreatment with
different concentrations of N2 (3 mM, 10 mM and 30 mM) for 24 h
signiﬁcantly decreased LDH release in cortical neurons in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 7). Interestingly, the N2 30 mM and
10 mM groups (145.15 and 194.66 respectively) had fewer LDH
release than the Ozagrel treated group (253.16), indicating that N2
30 mM and 10 mM groups had a better effect in protecting the
neuron cell.
3.8. The effect of N2 on OGD/R-induced neuronal apoptosis

Fig. 3. The effect of N2 on cerebral edema and neurological deficit score After orally
administrated with different concentrations of N2 (15 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/kg, 3.75 mg/kg) or
Clopidogrel (7.5 mg/kg), the MCAO was performed in rats. The vehicle group, N2 group
and Clopidogrel group underwent MCAO while the control group underwent the same
surgical procedure without the filament inserted. (a) The cerebral edema data. (b) The
neurological deficit score data. The cerebral edema data and neurological deficit score
data are presented as mean ± SD (n ¼ 8). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 compared with vehicle
group.

To determine whether pre-incubation of N2 could effectively
suppress neuronal apoptosis in rat cortical neuron cells, the
apoptotic rate in each group of rats was detected by Annexin V/PI
-FITC stain. As shown in Fig. 8, the apoptotic rate in vehicle group
was 66.03%, which is signiﬁcantly higher than the apoptotic rate in
normal control group (7.6%). After incubation of N2 with different
concentrations (3 mM, 10 mM and 30 mM), the apoptotic rate of
cortical neurons were increased signiﬁcantly (54.67%, 50.73% and
45.5% respectively) compared with the vehicle group.

performed in rats. The vehicle group, N2 group and Clopidogrel group underwent MCAO while the control group underwent the same surgical procedure without the filament
inserted. (a) Representative photographs of TUNEL staining of the rat brain. A was the control group, B was the vehicle group, C was the Clopidogrel group, D was the N2 15 mg/kg

3.9. The effect of N2 on bcl-2 and bax protein expression
Since N2 markedly reduced the apoptotic rate in rat cortical
neuron cells and TUNEL-positive cells in rat brains (Figs. 4 and 8), we
further examined its inﬂuence on the expression of the anti-apoptotic
protein, bcl-2, and the pro-apoptotic protein, bax both in vivo and
in vitro. Both in vivo and in vitro expression level of bcl-2 protein in
the vehicle group decreased significantly compared with the control
group. Similarly, the expression of bax protein in the vehicle group
increased signiﬁcantly compared with the control group. Preadministration of N2 both in vivo and in vitro could increase the
expression level of bcl-2 protein and decreased the expression of bax
protein (Fig. 9). Furthermore, after the PI3K inhibitor was added, the
expression of both bcl-2 and bax proteins were decreased compared
with the untreated groups of cortical neuron cells (Fig. 11).
3.10. The effect of N2 on Akt phosphorylation
To further reveal the molecular pathway that is responsible for
the neuroprotective effect of N2 after OGD/R injury, we sought to
investigate the effect of N2 on AKT phosphorylation in rat cortical
neuron cells using western blot analysis both in vivo and in vitro.
In vitro phosphorylation of Akt in the vehicle group decreased
significantly to 17.43% while the phosphorylation of Akt in the
control group was 64.46%. After pre-incubation of N2 with different

concentrations (3 mM, 10 mM and 30 mM), the phosphorylation level
of Akt increased significantly (28.47%, 45.96% and 53.27% respectively) (Fig. 10). For in vivo assay, pre-administration of N2 with
different concentrations (3.75 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg)
signiﬁcantly increased the phosphorylation of Akt (30.42%, 52.86%
and 64.00% respectively) which was similar to the in vitro result.
Moreover, after the PI3K inhibitor was added, the Akt phosphorylation was down-regulated compared with the neuron cells that
were untreated (Fig. 11).
4. Discussion
Stroke has become the second leading cause of death and the
most important cause of disability in many countries which accounts for more than 5 million deaths (Chen et al., 2014; Wu et al.,
2014). In spite of the high prevalence and severe consequences of
ischemic stroke, development of new agents in more safer and
effective manner that can treat ischemic stroke is highly warranted
(Jaffer et al., 2011). Emerging evidences indicated that neuronal cell
death via different mechanisms may occur after cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion injury that may lead to cerebral ischemic stroke (Kim
et al., 2014). Moreover, among the mechanisms of neuron injury
after brain ischemia/reperfusion, apoptosis is one of the key
mechanisms that is preventable (Chen et al., 2012; Cheng et al.,
2012; Sun et al., 2013). Therefore, prevention of neuron cell

apoptosis has been considered to be one of the prominent targets of
neuroprotective strategies in the treatment of ischemic stroke
(Bielewicz et al., 2010). N2, a novel drug which is still under preclinical investigations, is designed for the management of ischemic
stroke. As N2 has the ability to reduce the TXA2 formation (Zhou
et al., 2014) which could prevent the neuronal cell apoptosis by
regulating the PI3K pathway, in this study we mainly focused on
the regulatory effects on PI3K pathway with the administration of
N2. Further studies that are directly related with TXA2 were under
investigation and some studies were already published by our
study group (Zhou et al., 2014). Therefore in this study we focused
to investigate the mechanism of N2 on neuroprotection in the
management of ischemic stroke.
In our study, we performed both in vivo and in vitro experiments to investigate whether N2 could show the neuroprotective
effect as we expected. MCAO is the most frequently used model to
mimic the ischemic stroke in patients, because the pathophysiology
presented in MCAO follows the similar pattern as in human brain
(Liang et al., 2011). Our study revealed that pre-administration of
N2 could decrease the elevated infarct size, the brain edema and
the neurological deﬁcit score in rat brain after MCAO. The results of
our study support the notion that occlusion of rat middle cerebral
artery can lead to increased brain infarct size, cerebral edema and
neurological deﬁcient score which is in line with Fang et al. (Lv
et al., 2011). Moreover, we used the TUNEL assay to further
conﬁrm the effect of N2 in preventing neuronal cell death after
MCAO. TUNEL assay was designed to detect the DNA fragmentation

which is the characteristic manifestation of apoptosis and a marker
of neuronal cell death after cerebral ischemia (Briyal et al., 2014).
The reduction of TUNEL positive cells revealed that administration
of N2 effectively reduced the apoptotic rate in rat brain after MCAO.
To further investigate the capability of N2 on preventing neuronal
cell death after ischemia in vitro, we studied the protective effect of
N2 in rat cortical neurons. N2 decreased the LDH activity which was
considered as an index of cell injury in the OGD/R induced cortical
neurons (Wu et al., 2014) demonstrated that pre-incubation of N2
could attenuate the cell injury notably, and these results are
consistent with previously published studies (Zhou et al., 2014).
Furthermore, neuron cell apoptosis is initiated upon ischemia and it
is considered as a critical consequence of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (Sun et al., 2010), and this impairment could be prevented by the pre-incubation of N2. The results of the cell apoptotic
rate assay in cortical neuron cells demonstrated that preincubation of N2 could decrease the cell apoptotic rate signiﬁcantly after ODG/R injury. Both the in vivo and in vitro study
revealed that, N2 effectively prevent the neuronal cell death indicated that N2 can be developed as an effective drug for preventing
neuron death after cerebral ischemia.
Cerebral ischemia can induce the imbalance of apoptosisassociated proteins, such as bcl-2 and bax in the cortex and hippocampus neuron cells (Koistinaho and Hokfelt, 1997; Chen et al.,
2014). Bcl-2 protein is an anti-apoptotic factor which is important
for cell survival while bax is the protein that can promote apoptosis,
and neuroprotective agents are supposed to be able to down

involvement in the mechanism of anti-apoptotic effect of N2 we
further evaluated the effect of N2 on bax and bcl-2 proteins. The

western blot results of our in vivo and in vitro experiments showed
similar effects with each other as administration of N2 in vivo and
pre-incubation of N2 in the cortical neurons both significantly
increased the expression of bcl-2 protein and decreased the
expression of bax protein. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry
assay of rat brain after MCAO surgery showed the similar effect,
which was in accordance with the in vivo and in vitro study.
Therefore, the results revealed that N2 could prevent the cortical
neuron death against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by its
anti-apoptotic effect.
Unlike necrotic cell death, the process of neuron apoptosis was
often accompanied by the activation of associated genes and the
synthesis of their encoded proteins (Chen et al., 2014). PI3K is a
conserved family of signal transduction enzymes which play a key
role in regulating cell survival and apoptosis (Xu et al., 2011). PI3K
and its downstream serine/threonine kinase Akt (also known as
proteinkinase B, PKB) regulate several cellular processes, such as
cellular activation, inﬂammatory response, and apoptosis (Chen
et al., 2014). In response to stimulations such as cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion injury, the Akt pathway is activated by PI3K,
which leads to the production of phosphatidylinositol (3, 4, 5)trisphos- phate (PIP3), and activation of Akt (Manning and Cantley,
2007).To further explore the possible mechanisms that responsible
for the neuroprotective effects of N2 in OGD/R induced injury, the

involvement of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/Akt signaling
pathway was investigated in our study. In the present study, N2
significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt compared with
the vehicle group both in vivo and in vitro, indicated that N2 could

prevent the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury via the PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway. Therefore, N2 could induce the phosphorylation
of Akt which is a downstream effector of PI3K that can suppress
apoptosis and promote cell survival.

In our study, pre-incubation of N2 at the doses of 3e30 mM,
signiﬁcantly increased the cell viability, and reduced the cell
apoptotic rate in the primary cultured cortical neurons, and this
phenomenon was thought to be through the PI3K/Akt pathway.
To further clarify the signal pathway of N2, PI3K inhibitor
LY294002 was used to block the function of Akt. Although N2
exert neuroprotective effect of cortical neuron cells as low as
3 mM, the best effect was obtained at the dose of 30 mM. Based on
the studies, the 30 mM of N2 was considered as the most effective
dose in further clariﬁcation of the mechanism of action. After the
incubation of LY294002, the expression level of Akt, bcl-2 and
bax decreased signiﬁcantly in the vehicle and N2 treated group
compared with the other groups that are managed without
LY294002. It is disclosed that, phosphorylation of Akt S473 was
signiﬁcantly inhibited by PI3K inhibitor and in turn down
regulated the expression of bcl-2 and bax protein veriﬁed that
N2 can prevent neuron cell apoptosis through the PI3K/Akt
pathway.
Ozagrel and Clopidogrel are two positive control drugs that we
used respectively in the in vitro and in vivo experiment. Ozagrel has
a clinical efﬁcacy in the treatment of early-and chronic stage of
cerebral ischemia (Kaneko et al., 2006) and is indicated for stroke
interventions. Ozagrel and N2 are similar in structure and operated

by similar mechanisms. Moreover, Ozagrel is not an oral drug which
could be more suitable for the in vitro study of drug comparison.
Based on these facts we used Ozagrel as the positive control drug in
our study to get a better comprehensiveness of the action and
effectiveness of N2. Clopidogrel is used in the in vivo stroke intervention (Zhou et al., 2014) and generally indicated for cerebral
ischemia via oral administration. In our study, N2 is also an oral
drug and we also focused on cerebral ischemia. Therefore, we used
Clopidogrel as the positive control drug in our in vivo study to give
a better insight of the functional capability of our drug. Interestingly, based on our in vitro study, the high and middle dose of N2
showed superior neuroprotective effect than Ozagrel did (Figs. 6
and 7) and for the in vivo study, the high dose of N2 was more
effective than the Clopidogrel in decreasing the infarct area and
TUNLE positive cells after MCAO (Figs. 2, 4 and 5). All the results
suggested that N2 would provide a better solution in the management of ischemic stroke.
In conclusion, N2 could signiﬁcantly prevent apoptotic cell
death via regulating bax and bcl-2 expression in the PI3K/Akt
pathway which was further evidenced by using the PI3K inhibitor,
LY294002. All the results of the study disclosed that N2 could be a
potential therapeutic agent for the prevention of ischemic brain
injury.
