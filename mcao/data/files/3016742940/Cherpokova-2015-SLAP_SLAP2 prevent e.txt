platelets into wild-type mice. Our results establish SLAP and SLAP2 as critical inhibitors of platelet (hem)ITAM signaling in the setting of

Key Points

Introduction
Platelet activation at sites of vascular injury is essential for hemostasis,
but is also a major pathomechanism underlying myocardial infarction
and stroke.1,2 The central platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein (GP)
VI/FcRg-chain complex3,4 critically contributes to this activation, and
its loss or functional inhibition provides profound antithrombotic
protection, but only moderately increased bleeding in vivo.4,5
GPVI signals through an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) pathway in a similar manner to the T- and B-cell
antigen receptors (TCR, BCR) and some Fc receptors. Ligand-induced
crosslinking of GPVI leads to phosphorylation of the two tyrosine
residues within the ITAM on the FcRg-chain predominantly by the Src
family kinase (SFK) Lyn,6,7 followed by the recruitment, phosphorylation, and activation of the tyrosine kinase Syk, which initiates a
downstream signaling cascade ultimately resulting in the activation of
effector enzymes, including phosphoinositol-3-kinases and phospholipase C (PLC) g2.8 These signaling events downstream of Syk also
occur upon stimulation of the platelet C-type lectin-like receptor
2 (CLEC-2) either by its endogenous ligand, the transmembrane
GP podoplanin, or by the snake venom toxin rhodocytin. CLEC-2 is

an ;30 kilodalton (kDa) type II membrane protein that contains
a single conserved cytosolic YXXL sequence (hemITAM) which
initiates signaling upon CLEC-2 dimerization or oligomerization.8
CLEC-2 is highly expressed on megakaryocytes and platelets and
at lower levels on a number of leukocytes.9-11 CLEC-2 has been
identiﬁed as a critical player in a plethora of (patho-)physiological
processes, including thrombus formation and stability, lymphatic
development, and tumor metastasis, and similar to GPVI, in the maintenance of vascular integrity during inﬂammation.10,12,13
Src-like adapter proteins (SLAP and SLAP2) constitute a family
of adapter molecules of 34 kDa and 25/28 kDa, respectively, that
share structural similarities with SFKs, characterized by the presence
of a unique N-terminal region, an SH3-, and an SH2-domain.14
Unlike SFKs, SLAP and SLAP2 do not possess a C-terminal kinase
domain.14 Overexpression studies in T- and B-cell lines indicated
that SLAP and SLAP2 act as negative regulators of TCR and BCR
signaling,15-19 and contribute to TCR and BCR surface expression
levels.18-21 The latter mechanism involves the interaction of SLAP
proteins with phosphorylated components of the TCR or BCR

complex, followed by the recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase
c-Cbl to the receptor complex which promotes its degradation.19,21,22
In this way, SLAP plays an important role in the regulation of
T- and B-cell maturation and development.18,20
Little is known about the function of SLAP proteins in platelets,
other than upon platelet stimulation speciﬁcally with the GPVI-activating
snake venom protein convulxin, SLAP2 co-immunoprecipitates with
c-Cbl, Syk, and LAT.23 The functional consequences of these putative
interactions are unknown and form the aim of this study.

Methods
Animals
Slap2/2, Slap22/2, and Slap2/2/Slap22/2 mice were generated as previously
described,20,24 and these mice were backcrossed for 10 generations onto the
BALB/c background. Gp62/2 mice13 were crossed with Slap2/2/Slap22/2 mice.
Slap2/2/Slap22/2/Gp61/2 and litter-matched Slap2/2/Slap22/2/Gp61/1 mice
on a mixed BALB/c/Sv129/C57BL/6 background were used in this study.
Animal studies conducted were approved by the district government of
Lower Frankonia (Bezirksregierung Unterfranken, Germany).
Transfections and luciferase assays
The DT40 B-cell line was transfected by a previously published electroporation
method,25 which is described in detail in the supplemental Methods on the
Blood Web site.

extent of infarction was quantitatively assessed 24 hours after reperfusion
on 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride stained brain sections. Global neurologic function and motor function were evaluated by the Bederson score30 and
the grip test,31 respectively. The percentage of ipsilesional occluded vessels
24 hours after tMCAO was determined on hematoxylin and eosin stained brain
section as previously described.32
Platelet depletion
Thrombocytopenia was induced in BALB/c WT mice by IV injection of an
anti-GPIba antibody (0.15 mg/g body weight). Peripheral platelet counts were
determined by ﬂow cytometry 12 hours after platelet depletion as previously
described.33
Platelet transfusion
Washed platelets from several donor mice were pooled and 109 platelets in
200 mL Tyrode’s buffer were transferred IV into WT mice. Purity of the platelet
suspension was conﬁrmed by ﬂow cytometry and microscopical inspection, and
contamination by other blood cell types was further excluded using a fully
automated hematology analyzer (Sysmex KX-21N). Peripheral platelet
counts were determined 30 minutes after platelet transfer, and mice were
subsequently subjected to FeCl3-injury of the carotid artery, or 30 minutes of
tMCAO.
Chemicals and data analysis
A list of antibodies and reagents, and statistical data analysis are provided in
the supplemental Methods.

In vitro platelet studies
Immunoprecipitation is described in the supplemental Methods. Platelet
preparation, western blot analysis, aggregometry, ﬂow cytometry, adenosine 59-triphosphate (ATP) release, quantiﬁcation of phosphatidylserine
(PS) exposure, and thrombin generation were performed as described
previously. 26-28
Tail bleeding time
Mice were anesthetized, 1 mm of the tail tip was removed with a scalpel, and the
tails were immersed in 0.9% isotonic saline (37°C). The time until cessation
of bleeding (no blood ﬂow for 1 minute) was determined.
Mechanical injury of the abdominal aorta
An ultrasonic ﬂow probe (0.5PSB699; Transonic Systems) was placed around
the abdominal aorta of anesthetized mice and thrombus formation was induced by a single ﬁrm compression with a forceps for 10 seconds. Blood ﬂow
was monitored until complete blood vessel occlusion occurred for at least
5 minutes, or for a maximum of 30 minutes.
Thrombus formation in FeCl3-injured carotid arteries
An ultrasonic ﬂow probe (0.5PSB699; Transonic Systems) was placed around
the exposed carotid artery of anesthetized mice and thrombosis was induced
by topical application of 2.5% FeCl3 for 90 seconds. For animals subjected
to FeCl3–induced injury of the carotid artery after adoptive platelet transfer,
7.5% FeCl3 for 1 minute was used. Blood ﬂow was monitored until complete
blood vessel occlusion occurred for at least 2 minutes, or for a maximum of
30 minutes.
Transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion model
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in wild-type (WT) and Slap2/2/Slap22/2
mice by a transient MCA occlusion (tMCAO) as described.29 Brieﬂy, a siliconcoated thread was advanced through the carotid artery up to the origin of the
MCA causing an MCA infarction. After an occlusion time of 30 minutes,
the ﬁlament was removed allowing reperfusion of the MCA territory. The

Results
SLAP and SLAP2 independently prevent GPVI and CLEC-2
signaling in a cell line model without affecting surface
expression levels

SLAP proteins have been identiﬁed as negative regulators of TCR
and BCR expression levels and signaling.14 Platelet GPVI/FcRg
signaling resembles the signaling pathways downstream of the TCR
and BCR complexes. Therefore, we hypothesized that SLAP and
SLAP2 might have the capacity to regulate GPVI signaling. SLAP
proteins were expressed in the DT40 B-cell line model system that
we have previously used to study GPVI/FcRg signaling.25 In this
assay, an NFAT/AP-1 transcriptional reporter produces luciferase
in response to combined Ca21 and mitogen-activated protein kinase
signaling, both of which are downstream of GPVI/FcRg activation.
Strikingly, SLAP and SLAP2 almost completely inhibited GPVI signaling in response to collagen (Figure 1A), without affecting the
expression levels of transfected GPVI (Figure 1B). Cells transfected
with SLAP and SLAP2 responded normally to phorbol myristate
acetate and ionomycin stimulation (data not shown), indicating that
the SLAP proteins were not nonspeciﬁcally inhibiting cell signaling
in a global manner.
To test the possibility that SLAP or SLAP2 might also negatively
regulate signaling via the hemITAM receptor CLEC-2, the NFAT/
AP-1-luciferase assay in DT40 B cells was again used, since it is an
effective model system to study hemITAM signaling.34 SLAP and
SLAP2 each almost completely inhibited CLEC-2 signaling in response to rhodocytin (Figure 1C), without signiﬁcantly reducing the
expression levels of transfected CLEC-2 (Figure 1D). Responses to
phorbol-12-myrisate-13-acetate and ionomycin were not affected by
the SLAP proteins (data not shown). Together, these data suggested
that SLAP and SLAP2 can serve as negative regulators of both ITAM
and hemITAM signaling.

exposure. Stimulation of platelets with GPVI-speciﬁc agonists
(collagen-related peptide [CRP], the snake venom protein convulxin),
or the CLEC-2 agonist rhodocytin, resulted in slightly elevated
integrin activation and a-granule release, in particular at high agonist
concentrations (supplemental Figure 1B-E). In contrast, activation
responses to low concentrations of (hem)ITAM-speciﬁc agonists or
to soluble agonists operating via G protein-coupled receptors, such
as adenosine 59-diphosphate (ADP), the thromboxane A2 analog
U-46619, and thrombin, were normal. These results suggested a
potential negative regulatory function for SLAP family proteins
downstream of (hem)ITAM receptors in platelets, but this could
be largely masked by functional compensation in the single
knockouts.
Slap2/2/Slap22/2 platelets are hyperreactive to
(hem)ITAM-specific agonists

Figure 1. SLAP and SLAP2 inhibit GPVI/FcRg and CLEC-2 signaling in the
DT40 B-cell line model. (A) The DT40 B-cell line was transfected with a Ca21/
mitogen-activated protein kinase-responsive NFAT/AP-1-luciferase reporter construct,
a b-galactosidase construct, a GPVI, an FcRg, a SLAP or SLAP2 expression construct,
or empty vector control. Cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated with 5 mg/mL
collagen, lysed, and assayed for luciferase and b-galactosidase. Luciferase data
were normalized for b-galactosidase values. (B) The expression of GPVI was
confirmed by flow cytometry with an anti-GPVI mAb. (C) The experiment was conducted as described in (A), with the exception that cells were transfected with
a myc-tagged CLEC-2 expression construct and stimulated with 50 nM rhodocytin.
(D) The experiment was performed as for (B), except that CLEC-2 was detected by
an anti-myc mAb. Results in all panels are expressed as mean 6 standard deviation

SLAP and SLAP2 are expressed in mouse platelets

We set out to extend our data obtained in a heterologous system and
to further investigate the role of SLAP family proteins in platelet
biology by analyzing mice deﬁcient for SLAP or SLAP2.20,24
Western blot analysis conﬁrmed the absence of SLAP in Slap2/2 and
of SLAP2 in Slap22/2 platelet lysates (Figure 2A). We observed
upregulation of SLAP in Slap22/2 platelets (increase of ;35%
compared with WT platelets) (Figure 2A). The two SLAP2 protein
bands of 25 kDa and 28 kDa are in line with previous reports which
indicate that alternative translation leads to the expression of two
SLAP2 isoforms (Figure 2A, arrowheads).16,17 Slap2/2 and Slap22/2
mice had normal platelet counts and size (supplemental Table 1).
Flow cytometric measurement of prominent platelet surface receptors and western blot analysis showed slightly increased surface
expression of GPVI in Slap2/2 platelets, whereas CLEC-2 levels
were slightly elevated in Slap22/2 platelets (supplemental Table 1 and
supplemental Figure 1A). The effect of SLAP or SLAP2 deﬁciency on
platelet activation was analyzed by aggregation studies and ﬂow
cytometry measurements of agonist-induced inside-out activation of
aIIbb3 integrin and degranulation-dependent P-selectin surface

To assess a potential functional redundancy of the two adapter proteins,
we generated SLAP/SLAP2 double-deﬁcient mice. Slap2/2/Slap22/2
platelets exhibited a signiﬁcant (P , .001) ;23% increase in surface
expression of GPVI and ;15% increase in CLEC-2 compared with
WT controls, as determined by ﬂow cytometry (supplemental Table 2)
and conﬁrmed by western blot analyses (Figure 2B). Expression of
all other major platelet surface receptors was unaltered (supplemental Table 2).
Slap2/2/Slap22/2 platelets displayed a marked hyperreactivity
in response to GPVI or CLEC-2 stimulation (Figure 2C-E). This
effect was best evident at subthreshold concentrations of GPVI agonists (CRP, convulxin and collagen) as well as the CLEC-2 agonist
rhodocytin, which did not induce activation of WT platelets, but
resulted in integrin activation, a- and dense-granule secretion, and
robust aggregation of the mutant platelets. Importantly, activation
responses to G protein-coupled receptor-speciﬁc agonists were
unaltered in Slap2/2/Slap22/2 platelets (Figure 2C-E). Together,
these results indicated that SLAP and SLAP2 have redundant
functions in the regulation of (hem)ITAM signaling in platelets.
To examine whether increased GPVI/ITAM signaling in Slap2/2/
Slap22/2 platelets can be explained by the elevated GPVI surface
expression levels in SLAP/SLAP2 deﬁcient mice, Slap2/2/Slap22/2
Gp61/2 were generated by crossing Slap2/2/Slap22/2 mice with
Gp62/2 mice.13 Flow cytometric analysis conﬁrmed that GPVI expression levels in Slap2/2/Slap22/2/Gp61/2 platelets were reduced
by approximately 50% compared with platelets of Slap2/2/Slap22/2/
Gp61/1 litter-matched mice and were also signiﬁcantly lower than in
WT platelets (Figure 3A). Despite reduced GPVI surface expression
levels, Slap2/2/Slap22/2/Gp61/2 platelets were markedly hyperreactive to GPVI agonists, as shown by analysis of integrin aIIbb3
activation, P-selectin exposure, and aggregation in response to GPVIspeciﬁc agonists, most notably at low and intermediate concentrations
(Figure 3B-C). These results clearly demonstrated that the enhanced
GPVI activation in SLAP/SLAP2 deﬁcient platelets occurred independently of increased GPVI expression levels in these cells, and
indicate a speciﬁc defect in the inhibition of GPVI signaling.
To study the function of SLAP/SLAP2 in ITAM signaling in
more detail, we assessed changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation in WT, Slap2/2/Slap22/2/Gp61/2, and Slap2/2/Slap22/2/
Gp61/1 platelets upon stimulation with convulxin (Figure 3D).
We detected enhanced and sustained tyrosine phosphorylation of
key signaling molecules in the GPVI/ITAM activation pathway,
including FcRg-chain, Syk (Y519/520), and PLCg2 (Y759) in
SLAP/SLAP2 deﬁcient platelets, which was also seen in Slap2/2/
Slap22/2/Gp61/2 platelets, and thus largely independent of GPVI

expression levels (Figure 3D and supplemental Figure 2A). Notably,
markedly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation was observed also
upon stimulation of SLAP/SLAP2 deﬁcient platelets with rhodocytin
(Figure 3E and supplemental Figure 2B).
To address the mechanism by which SLAP proteins inhibit
GPVI signaling, we hypothesized that SLAP proteins might compete with SFKs for binding to the GPVI/FcRg signaling complex.
This is because Lyn and other SFKs are known to interact with
GPVI,6,35 and because of the sequence similarity between Lyn
and SLAP/SLAP2 (33% to 34% identity for SH3 and 51% identity for
SH2 domains). Indeed, we detected strongly increased binding of
Lyn to activated GPVI in the absence of SLAP/SLAP2 compared with
control (Figure 3F), consistent with the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins (Figure 3D).

Markedly enhanced GPVI-dependent procoagulant activity in
Slap2/2/Slap22/2 platelets

We next investigated consequences of SLAP/SLAP2 deﬁciency on
platelet adhesion to collagen and aggregate formation under ﬂow
using a whole blood perfusion system. Unexpectedly, WT and
Slap2/2 /Slap22/2 platelets formed large aggregates to the same
extent and with the same kinetics at intermediate shear rates of
1000 s21 (supplemental Figure 3A-B).
GPVI signaling leads to a marked increase in cytosolic Ca21
concentrations, subsequent surface exposure of procoagulant PS,
and resultant thrombin generation.4,36 To test whether SLAP/SLAP2
regulate coagulant activity of platelets, blood from WT and Slap2/2 /
Slap22/2 mice was anticoagulated, perfused over immobilized

of the respective nonphosphorylated proteins and actin served
as loading control. (E) WT and Slap2/2/Slap22/2 platelets were

proteins immunoprecipitated (IP) with Lyn were resolved by sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions and immunoblotted (WB) for GPVI or Lyn. An immunoblot of whole-cell lysate (WCL) loaded at 0.4% of Lyn

by Annexin-A5 staining. The surface covered by collagen-adherent
platelets was similar in WT and mutant samples, whereas PS exposure
was markedly increased in Slap2/2/Slap22/2 blood (Figure 4A-B).
Enhanced GPVI-dependent procoagulant activity of Slap2/2/Slap22/2
platelets was conﬁrmed by ﬂow cytometric analysis of Annexin-A5positive cells upon stimulation with different agonists (Figure 4C and
supplemental Figure 3C). In agreement with enhanced PS-exposure,
lack of SLAP/SLAP2 resulted in altered maximal amount of newly
generated thrombin and signiﬁcantly accelerated response upon stimulation with (hem)ITAM-speciﬁc agonists, whereas the overall amount

of thrombin produced was comparable to the values in WT control
samples (Figure 4D). Importantly, SLAP/SLAP2 deﬁciency did not
affect plasma coagulation, as conﬁrmed by unaltered activated plasma
thromboplastin time and prothrombin time in Slap2/2/Slap22/2 mice
compared with the WT control (supplemental Figure 4).

To assess the extent to which the above-described defects affect
thrombotic events in vivo, Slap2/2/Slap22/2 and WT mice were
subjected to two models of occlusive arterial thrombus. In the ﬁrst
model, the abdominal aorta is mechanically injured and thrombus
formation occurs mainly through collagen-dependent mechanisms.
The severity of injury was adjusted to achieve stable vessel occlusion
in only 20% of the WT mice. In marked contrast, the majority (89%)
of Slap2/2/Slap22/2 mice formed stable vessel occlusion, which also
occurred considerably faster (282 6 151 seconds in Slap2/2/Slap22/2
mice vs 713 6 131 seconds in WT mice) (Figure 5B). In a second
model, the carotid artery was injured by topical application of a low
concentration of FeCl3. Stable vessel occlusion occurred in 93% of all
tested Slap2/2/Slap22/2 mice, whereas 60% of the WT mice (9 out of
15) were not able to form occlusive thrombi within the observation
period of 30 minutes (P , .01); mean time to occlusion: 607 6 146
seconds in WT mice vs 483 6 149 seconds in Slap2/2/Slap22/2 mice
(Figure 5C). Importantly, similar results were obtained upon adoptive
platelet transfer of Slap2/2/Slap22/2 platelets into platelet-depleted
WT mice, thus excluding a contribution of other cell types than
platelets to the observed phenotype (stable vessel occlusion in 30%
of mice transfused with WT platelets, vessel occlusion in 92% of
mice transfused with Slap2/2/Slap22/2 platelets; P , .01) (Figure 5D).
Notably, application of a very low concentration of FeCl3 resulted in
the formation of occlusive platelet-rich thrombi in Slap2/2/Slap22/2
mice, which did not differ morphologically from those observed in
WT control mice treated with a higher concentration of FeCl3,
demonstrating that thrombus formation in Slap2/2/Slap22/2 mice
follows the same mechanisms as in WT mice, but occurs at a markedly
lower threshold stimulus (supplemental Figure 5). Together, these
ﬁndings demonstrated that SLAP/SLAP2 deﬁciency in platelets

resulted in a prothrombotic phenotype, conﬁrming the notion that
these adapter proteins limit platelet activation in vivo, and thereby
efﬁciently prevent occlusive thrombus formation and infarction.
SLAP/SLAP2 deficiency in platelets dramatically aggravates
neurologic damage after focal cerebral ischemia

Ischemic stroke is a complex disease with multiple cellular interactions
involved in the progression of thromboembolic vessel occlusion to
infarct development.2 Although the exact mechanisms by which
platelets contribute to the development of ischemic brain infarction are
still poorly understood, there is increasing evidence that GPVI (and
GPIb) plays a major role in this process.29,37 To determine the effect of
SLAP/SLAP2 deﬁciency on cerebral infarct development, Slap2/2/
Slap22/2 and WT mice were subjected to the tMCAO model of acute
stroke where the MCA is occluded by a ﬁlament for 30 minutes,
thereby reducing cerebral ﬂow by .90%.29 In agreement with
previous reports,38 WT mice developed only small infarctions after
this short ischemia. In sharp contrast, infarct volumes in Slap2/2/
Slap22/2 mice were increased by ;92% compared with WT mice
(58.8 6 33.5 mm3 in WT mice vs 113.1 6 14.3 mm3 in Slap2/2/
Slap22/2 mice; P , .001) (Figure 6A). The increase in infarct size
was functionally relevant, as it was associated with an overall
impairment of neurologic and motor function, demonstrated by the
signiﬁcantly worsened outcome in the Bederson score and grip test,
respectively (Figure 6B-C). The dramatic increase in infarct volume
was accompanied by enhanced intracerebral thrombosis, as demonstrated by the markedly elevated number of occlusive vessels
(Figure 6D). In agreement with the higher proportion of thrombotic
vessels, immunohistochemical and western blot analyses revealed
increased accumulation of ﬁbrin(ogen) in the infarcted basal ganglia
and cortices of Slap2/2/Slap22/2 mice (data not shown).

were comparable in WT and Slap2/2 /Slap2 2/2 mice for 24 hours
after 30 minutes of tMCAO (data not shown). Together, these results
further corroborated the notion that enhanced thrombotic, rather than
proinﬂammatory activity, is a major determinant of the increased
susceptibility of the mutant mice toward ischemic brain infarction.

To speciﬁcally investigate the role of platelet SLAP and SLAP2
in the progression of ischemic stroke, we performed adoptive platelet
transfer into platelet-depleted WT mice. Importantly, the transfused platelet populations were free of leukocytes, as tested by ﬂow
cytometry, microscopical inspection, and automated blood cell
analysis. Furthermore, ﬂow cytometric and transmission electron
microscopy analyses conﬁrmed that the platelet suspensions were
also free of (leukocyte- or platelet-derived) microparticles. Strikingly,
infarct volumes in WT mice transfused with Slap2/2/Slap22/2 platelets
were dramatically increased by ;97% compared with WT mice
transfused with WT platelets (123.0 6 23.4 mm3 vs 62.6 6 31.8 mm3;

SLAP/SLAP2 activity in platelets is critically involved in limiting
infarct growth following focal cerebral ischemia.
In a control experiment, WT mice received leukocytes isolated
from blood of Slap2/2/Slap22/2 or WT mice, and were then subjected to 30 minutes of tMCAO. Both groups of mice developed only

responsible for the increased susceptibility of Slap2/2/Slap22/2
mice toward ischemic stroke (supplemental Figure 6). Furthermore,

Discussion
In this study, we have shown that SLAP and SLAP2 negatively regulate surface expression levels and signaling of the ITAM receptor
GPVI and the hemITAM receptor CLEC-2 in platelets. However,
single deﬁciency of either adapter protein had only a minor effect
on platelet (hem)ITAM signaling, whereas the combined loss of
SLAP and SLAP2 resulted in a marked platelet hyperreactivity
to (hem)ITAM-coupled agonists in vitro, which translated into a
signiﬁcant prothrombotic phenotype and dramatically increased
susceptibility to focal cerebral ischemia in vivo. Our results clearly
demonstrate a functional redundancy of the two adapter proteins in
the regulation of platelet (hem)ITAM signaling and reveal a crucial
function of SLAP and SLAP2 in the control of thrombotic and
thrombo-inﬂammatory events.
Involvement of SLAP in the regulation of surface expression levels
of ITAM-coupled immune cell receptors, such as the TCR and BCR,
is well-established.14 In vivo studies have demonstrated an important
role for SLAP in regulating TCR expression during a speciﬁc
T lymphocyte developmental stage at which repertoire selection
takes place.20 Similarly, SLAP is required for the ﬁne tuning of BCR
levels and signal strength during B-cell development.18 Importantly,
our data clearly demonstrate that increased GPVI receptor density
was not responsible for the marked hyperreactivity, as this was also
seen in SLAP/SLAP2 deﬁcient Gp61/2 platelets, which expressed
lower GPVI surface levels than WT control platelets (Figure 3A-D).

BLOOD, 1 JANUARY 2015 x VOLUME 125, NUMBER 1

This was supported by observations in a model cell line, in which expression of either SLAP or SLAP2 almost completely inhibited GPVI
signaling without affecting expression levels (Figure 1A-B). We
propose that the mechanism by which GPVI signaling is inhibited
by SLAP proteins involves, at least in part, competition with SFKs
for binding to the GPVI/FcRg signaling complex. In support of this
model, immunoprecipitation of the SFK Lyn contained substantially more GPVI in the absence of SLAP/SLAP2 (Figure 3F), and
tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins was also
elevated (Figure 3D). Collectively, these results establish SLAP/
SLAP2 as negative regulators of ITAM signaling in platelets,
presumably through competition with Lyn for binding to the GPVI
cytosolic tail, and a similar mechanism may also apply to CLEC-2
signaling.
Our data further demonstrated that SLAP/SLAP2 signiﬁcantly
contributed to dampening collagen-induced procoagulant activity in
platelets and ensuing thrombin generation (Figure 4). These results
are in line with earlier studies indicating that key components of
the GPVI/ITAM signaling cascade, including the FcRg-chain, LAT,
Syk, and PLCg2, as well as GPVI-induced increase in cytosolic
Ca21 concentration, are critically involved in collagen-dependent PS
exposure.28,36,41 Increasing evidence suggests that platelet procoagulant activity, in particular by propagation of the contact phase of
coagulation, plays an important role in initiating arterial thrombus
formation.1 Our results revealed that SLAP and SLAP2 are essential
to prevent overshooting thrombotic and thrombo-inﬂammatory processes in vivo (Figures 5B-D, 6, and 7). Remarkably, using
adoptive platelet transfer, we were able to unambiguously attribute
this function to SLAP/SLAP2 expression in platelets and the
contribution of both adapter proteins to attenuation of (hem)ITAM
signaling.
Compelling evidence suggests that platelets are essentially involved in the progression of ischemic stroke, presumably by
orchestrating a complex thrombo-inﬂammatory process, in which
interactions between platelets, immune cells, and the contact activation system result in the disruption of the blood-brain barrier
and neurologic damage.37,38 Although the underlying mechanisms of platelet contribution to infarct development are not
completely understood, integrin aIIbb3-dependent platelet aggregation was shown to be dispensable.29 By contrast, the importance
of initial platelet adhesion and activation steps involving GPIb-von
Willebrand factor interactions is now well-established.29,37,42-44
Likewise, GPVI also appears to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of acute stroke, as shown by profound protection of
GPVI-depleted mice in the tMCAO model of ischemic stroke,29
and indirect evidence indicating increased GPVI activity in acute
stroke patients.45,46 Our ﬁndings further corroborate the hypothesis that GPVI/ITAM-mediated activation processes are of central
importance during stroke progression. Signiﬁcantly, GPVI has
emerged as an attractive potential target for antithrombotic therapy, as its blockade or antibody-induced depletion provided powerful protection from experimental arterial thrombosis without
affecting platelet hemostatic functions.4,5,47 Together, these experimental and clinical data emphasize a central role of GPVI in
the course of acute ischemic disease states, and thereby establish
modulators of GPVI activity, such as SLAP/SLAP2, as central
factors in the pathology of atherothrombosis and ischemic stroke.
Taken together, our studies establish two distinct roles for the adapter proteins SLAP and SLAP2 in platelets. Firstly, SLAP/SLAP2
negatively regulate expression levels of two major platelet-activating
receptors: the ITAM-containing collagen receptor GPVI/FcRg-chain,
which parallels SLAP/SLAP2 regulation of BCR and TCR levels, and

the hemITAM-containing CLEC-2 receptor. Secondly, SLAP/SLAP2
are central regulators of (hem)ITAM signaling in platelets that are
essential to limit arterial thrombus growth and thrombo-inﬂammatory
processes.
