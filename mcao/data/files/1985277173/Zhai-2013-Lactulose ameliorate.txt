Molecular hydrogen has been proven effective in ameliorating cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by
selectively neutralizing reactive oxygen species. Lactulose can produce a considerable amount of hydrogen
through fermentation by the bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. To determine the neuroprotective effects of
lactulose against cerebral I/R injury in rats and explore the probable mechanisms, we carried out this study.
The stroke model was produced in Sprague–Dawley rats through middle cerebral artery occlusion.
Intragastric administration of lactulose substantially increased breath hydrogen concentration. Behavioral
and histopathological veriﬁcations matched biochemical ﬁndings. Behaviorally, rats in the lactulose
administration group won higher neurological scores and showed shorter escape latency time in the Morris
test. Morphologically, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride showed smaller infarction volume; Nissl staining
manifested relatively clear and intact neurons and TUNEL staining showed fewer apoptotic neurons.
Biochemically, lactulose decreased brain malondialdehyde content, caspase-3 activity, and 3-nitrotyrosine
and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine concentration and increased superoxide dismutase activity. The effects of
lactulose were superior to those of edaravone. Lactulose orally administered activated the expression of NF-E2related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the brain as veriﬁed by RT-PCR and Western blot. The antibiotics suppressed the
neuroprotective effects of lactulose by reducing hydrogen production. Our study for the ﬁrst time demonstrates
a novel therapeutic effect of lactulose on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and the probable underlying
mechanisms. Lactulose intragastrically administered possessed neuroprotective effects on cerebral I/R injury in
rats, which could be attributed to hydrogen production by the fermentation of lactulose through intestinal
bacteria and Nrf2 activation.

preventive treatments intended to control the risk factors, such as
diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, have been
demonstrated to be beneﬁcial, there is a lack of efﬁcient curative
treatments, except for thrombolytic treatments [2].
The hypothesis that oxidative stress resulting from free radical
production, especially during the postischemic reperfusion stage, is
involved in ischemic damage caught the world′s attention for the ﬁrst
time in the mid-1980s [3]. Since this period, evidence has accumulated
that excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), which could cause
substantial damage to cellular components, are closely related to
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in stroke [4–6]. Therefore, antioxidants have been considered in prevention and treatment of stroke
[2].
In recent years, molecular hydrogen (H2) has been proven
effective in reducing ischemia/reperfusion injuries in various diseases
as a novel antioxidant [7]. Multiple studies have demonstrated that

732

hydrogen possesses the ability to selectively neutralize ONOO  and
d
OH, the most cytotoxic ROS [8,9], and protected the tissue from
oxidative stress injuries via the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway
[10].
Lactulose orally administered can be bacterially fermented in
the colon and induce dramatic amounts of endogenous H2. Therefore, we hypothesized that lactulose orally administered could
ameliorate brain damage from ischemia reperfusion injury (I/R) in
stroke. To determine the possible protective effects of lactulose on
stroke and the underlying mechanisms, we carried out this study.

Materials and methods
Animal model
All procedures with animals were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committees of the Second Military Medical
University and conformed to the U.S. National Institutes of Health
guidelines for use of animals in research. Male Sprague–Dawley
rats, 180–220 g, were obtained from the Experimental Animal
Center of the Second Military Medical University (certiﬁcation:
SCXK (Shanghai) 2007-0003). Animals were kept in a climatecontrolled vivarium with a 12-h light–dark cycle with free access
to food and water. Rats were acclimated to the environment for
7 days before the study.
For sample size, we calculated that ﬁve rats per experimental
index would be enough to detect among-group differences based
on our preliminary experiments with 90% power and a 5% risk of
type 1 error and a total of 170 rats allowing for 30% death and

exclusion rate. The formula was as follows:

As the ﬂow chart in Fig. 1 shows, rats were randomly assigned to
the following six groups: sham operation group (sham, n¼ 25),
I/R group (MCAO, n ¼30), lactulose group (LAC, n¼ 30), lactulose
plus antibiotics group (ANTI, n ¼30), hydrogen group (H2, n¼ 30),
and edaravone group (Ed, n ¼ 25). Except that 30 mg/kg metronidazole (Sine Wangxiang Pharma, China), 100 mg/kg amoxicillin
(Lunan Pharmaceutical Group Corp., China), and 15 mg/kg azithromycin (Salubris Co. Ltd., China) [11] were given intragastrically
to rats in the ANTI group 24 h in advance, and 10% chloral hydrate
(Fortuneibo-Tech Co. Ltd., China) was used at 2 ml/100 g for
peritoneal anesthesia before the surgery, all drugs were given
intragastrically at the start of ischemia as follows: rats in the LAC
and ANTI groups received 0.25 g/kg (diluted to 0.75 ml/kg) lactulose (Solvay Pharmaceuticals BV, The Netherlands); in the sham
and MCAO groups rats were given 0.75 ml/kg normal saline; in the
Ed and H2 groups rats were given 0.75 ml/kg edaravone (Simcere
Co. Ltd., China) and 5 ml/kg saturated hydrogen saline (generated
by ourselves [12]).
Middle cerebral artery occlusion model establishment
MCAO followed by reperfusion was conducted with an intraluminal monoﬁlament as previously described [13]. Brieﬂy, ﬁrst the right
external carotid artery (ECA), internal carotid artery (ICA), and
pterygopalatine artery of the ICA were identiﬁed. A monoﬁlament

nylon suture was inserted into the ICA via a small incision on the ECA
into the ICA (about 18–20 mm from the bifurcation). At the end of a
1.5-h ischemia period, reperfusion was produced by gently removing
the nylon suture until the nylon tip reached the bifurcation of the
ECA and ICA, and the incision on the ECA was closed. After recovering
from anesthesia the animals were allowed food and water ad libitum.
During and after surgery, animals were maintained at a constant
body temperature of 39 1C by a thermal insulation pad (TC-1000,
Man Pu Biotechnology Co. Ltd., China).
A Doppler laser blood ﬂow meter (Periﬂux 5010, Perimed,
Sweden) was positioned at 1 mm posterior and 3 mm lateral to
bregma to measure the local cerebral blood ﬂow and monitor the
occlusion and reperfusion.
Hydrogen concentration measurement
The exhaled H2 concentration was determined with a precision gas
detector (Oldham EX2000, Hatech Gasdetectietechniek BV, Ramsdonksveer, The Netherlands) and was expressed as parts per million
(ppm). The animals were enclosed in a hermetic container (4.5 L,
20  15  15 cm) with one tube connected to the gas detector and
another to an oxygen cylinder. Carbon dioxide adsorbent was furnished in the container. H2 concentration was determined every 10 min
after lactulose administration until the concentration stayed stable.
Neurological deﬁcit evaluation
According to the Zea Longa standard [14], neurological deﬁcits
were blindly evaluated 24 h after reperfusion based on a 5-point scale
system as follows: 0, no deﬁcit; 1, not being able to completely stretch
the contralateral torso and forelimb; 2, turning to the ipsilateral side
when held by the tail; 3, falling over to the affected side; 4, not being
able to walk and no spontaneous locomotor activity.
Morris water maze test
The Morris water maze test consisted of two parts, a black 1.5m-diameter 30-cm-deep water pool and an automatic video
recording and analytical system. A submerged and hidden 9-cmdiameter platform was located in one quadrant and remained
unchanged throughout the test. On postoperative day 1, rats were
habituated to water. During the following 4 days, the rats were
trained for four trials per day (60 s/trial), starting at four locations
randomly. On postoperative day 6, the time, referred to as latency,
was calculated as learning and memory score [15].
Measurement of infarct size by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) staining
After anesthesia, the brains were removed and those with clot
formation and/or subarachnoid hemorrhage were eliminated. The
brains were sectioned into 2-mm slices, which were then incubated
in a 0.2% solution of TTC at 37 1C for 30 min and then ﬁxed in 10%
formalin. For analysis, the TTC sections were photographed using a
high-resolution digital camera (SONY DSC-W170) and measured in a
blinded manner with an image analysis software, Image-Pro [16]. The
infarct volume was calculated by Swanson′s method [17] to correct for
edema. The total volumes of both contralateral (VC) and ipsilateral
hemisphere (VL) were measured, and the infarct percentage (%I) was
calculated as %I¼100  (VC VL)/VC to avoid mismeasurement secondary to edema.
Nissl staining
Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, the rats were executed
and ﬁxed by formaldehyde perfusion. Parafﬁn-blocked brains were

733

cut into 4-μm sections, hydrated in 1% toluidine blue at 50 1C for
20 min, and rinsed with double-distilled water. After dehydrating
and mounting with Permount, the cortex and the CA1 area of the
hippocampus from each animal were captured.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling
(TUNEL) staining
By using the in situ cell death detection kit (Roche), TUNEL
staining was performed on parafﬁn-embedded sections. According to
standard protocols, the sections were dewaxed and rehydrated at
60 1C. After incubating in a 20 μg/ml proteinase K working solution
for 15 min at room temperature, the slides were rinsed three times
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated in the
TUNEL reaction mixture for 1 h at 37 1C. Samples were dried and
Converter-AP was added for 1 h at 37 1C before rinsing with PBS
(5 min, three times). The samples were stained in the dark with
nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate.
Measurement of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and
malondialdehyde (MDA) content
The bilateral cerebral cortexes were homogenized in cold saline
with a weight-to-volume ratio of 1:9, and then the homogenate
was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 1C. The supernatant
was assayed for protein concentration using the Enhanced BCA
protein assay kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China). Both
measurements of SOD activity and MDA content in tissue homogenates were performed in accordance with the technical manual
of the detection kits (Jianchen Biological Institute, China).
Immunohistochemistry of caspase-3, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine
(8-OHdG), 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), and Nrf2
The parafﬁn sections, 5 mm thick, which were drawn 24 h after
reperfusion, were ﬁrst deparafﬁnized in xylene, rehydrated with
various grades of ethanol, and pretreated with 10 μg/ml proteinase K
for 30 min at 37 1C (to permeate the nucleus). By incubating the
sections in 10% bovine serum albumin, nonspeciﬁc binding of
immunoglobulins was blocked for 20 min. Then the sections were
incubated overnight at room temperature in with anti-caspase-3
(1:200, Jianchen Biological Institute), anti-8-OHdG antibody (1:200),
anti-3-NT antibody (1:200), and anti-Nrf2 (1:100, Beyotime Institute
of Biotechnology). After being washed with PBS, the caspase-3
sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody and the 8-OHdG and 3-NT sections with alkaline
phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology) for 1 h and ﬁnally incubated with diaminobenzidine
for 30 min. The caspase-3 plate was read in a ﬂuorimeter with a 400nm excitation ﬁlter and a 505-nm emission ﬁlter. Other slide ﬁelds
were examined randomly using a deﬁned rectangular ﬁeld district
with magniﬁcation (  40). For quantiﬁcation, 8-OHdG- and 3-NTpositive cells were counted in each ﬁeld, and integral optical
densities of Nrf2 were calculated with Image-Pro Plus 6.
Quantitative reverse transcription–PCR (qRT-PCR) for Nrf2
Total RNA was extracted with the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA)
following the manufacturer′s instructions. The reverse transcription
reaction was carried out in a 20-μl volume with 1 μg of total RNA,
16 1C for 30 min, 42 1C for 42 min, and 85 1C for 5 min. One microliter
of the RT product was used in the PCR. The PCR cycling began with
template denaturing at 95 1C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 1C
for 10 s, 60 1C for 20 s, 72 1C for 20 s, and 78 1C for 20 s. The Nrf2
primers were as follows: upstream, 5′-ACACGGTCCACAGCTCATC-3′,
and downstream, 5′-TGCCTCCAAGTATGTCAATA-3′ [18].

Western blot analysis
Anti-Nrf2 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). On a 10% SDS–PAGE gel 20 μg of total
protein was electrophoresed, transferred onto to a polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride membrane, blocked, incubated with primary antibody and
then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody.
According to the manufacturer′s instructions, enhanced chemiluminescence reaction with ECL detection reagents (Amersham, Little
Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) was conducted [18]. The membranes
were visualized by exposure to X-ray ﬁlm in the dark and densitometric analysis was performed using Image-Pro Plus 6.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as means 7SD and were analyzed by SAS
9.1 software. Differences between groups were compared with
one-way ANOVA followed by SNK test for multiple comparisons.
Hydrogen concentration was followed by mixed model for repeatedly measured data for multiple comparisons. Po 0.05 was
regarded statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Hydrogen breath test
Accumulated H2 concentration within the hermetic container
in the LAC group increased after intragastric administration of
lactulose, reached the peak at 100 min, and then decreased slowly
because of consumption by breathing. When combined with
antibiotics, administration of lactulose induced only a small
amount of H2. The accumulated H2 concentration at 100 min in
the LAC group (0.11 72.76  10  3 ml) was signiﬁcantly higher
than that in the ANTI (0.02 70.76  10  3 ml, nP o0.001) and sham
groups (0.00 70.07  10  3 ml, #P o0.001; Fig. 2).
Neurological score
The neurological score indicated no deﬁciency in the sham
group. A signiﬁcant increase in neurological score (3.707 0.48)
was found in animals 24 h after focal cerebral ischemia (Fig. 3A).
Intragastric administration of lactulose decreased the neurological
score (1.00 70.67), and after antibiotics administration, the score

Escape latencies
In the Morris water maze test, rats in the sham group landed on
the platform in 15.50 73.03 s. Observed on the 6th day after
MCAO, the escape latency of the LAC group (24.00 74.40 s) was
signiﬁcantly shorter than that of the MCAO group (52.10 74.77 s),
ANTI group (48.80 75.47 s), H2 group (23.00 73.40 s), and Ed
group (29.6 7 7.00 s) (n#Po 0.001 vs MCAO and ANTI, nnP o0.001

TTC staining

increased in the lactulose (LAC) group after intragastric administration, boomed
up at 100 min, and then decreased slowly. Rats produced a small amount of H2 after
the administration of antibiotics. The H2 concentration at 100 min in the LAC group
(0.117 2.76  10  3 ml) was signiﬁcantly higher than that of the antibiotics (ANTI)
group (0.02 7 0.76  10  3 ml, Po 0.001) and the sham group (0.007 0.07 

Infarct volumes determined by postmortem TTC staining at 24 h
were 22.9772.93% in the MCAO group, 22.1572.91% in the ANTI
group, 10.7871.86% in the H2 group, and 14.9273.28% in the Ed

sparsely distributed and the cell outline was fuzzy. The cells of

eumorphism were signiﬁcantly reduced (b2, d2). Lactulose treatment reduced cell loss and preserved the intact structure of most
neurons (b3, d3) and antibiotics inhibited the protective effects of
lactulose (b4, d4). Edaravone treatment (b6, d6) had similar effects

Discussion
Our study shows for the ﬁrst time that lactulose has protective
effects against cerebral I/R injury in an MCAO model demonstrated
by improved neurologic scores and escape latencies, reduced
infarct volume and ameliorated neuronal apoptosis, increased
SOD activity, and decreased MDA, 8-OHdG, and 3-NT content by
inducing endogenous H2 production. The mechanism is possibly
attributed to activating Nrf2 expression.
An ischemic stroke is due to ischemia (lack of blood ﬂow)
caused by blockage (thrombosis, arterial embolism), which may
lead to rapid development of brain function loss as a result of
disturbance in the supply to the brain [19]. Stroke can affect
patients physically, mentally, emotionally, or in a combination of
the three and bring heavy burdens to society, remaining the third
leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability in adults
[20]. During cerebral ischemia, cerebral blood ﬂow is partially or
completely cut off in brain regions supplied by the occluded
vessels. Reoxygenation due to spontaneous or thrombolytic reperfusion offers oxygen as a substrate for a number of enzymatic
oxidations, constantly generating ROS such as superoxide anion
radicals (O2d  ) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) [21]. Thus, oxidative
stress injury occurs.
Although the mechanism of cerebral I/R injury is complicated,
the overproduction of free radicals (especially ONOO  and dOH) is
one of the most important start factors, which can cause severe
damage of biological macromolecules and lead to the apoptosis of
cells and tissues [22,23]. Therefore, antioxidants have been considered for the prevention and treatment of stroke and certain

739

agents with antioxidant effects did have neuroprotective effects
[24].
Hydrogen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas, the simplest
element in nature, features a certain antioxidant activity. In 2007,
Ohsawa et al. [7,25] proved that hydrogen could selectively reduce
hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite anions and neutralize cerebral
and hepatic I/R injury, attracting the world′s attention. A number
of studies on various models have demonstrated that hydrogen
has protective effects on intestinal I/R injury [26], lung I/R injury
[27], myocardium I/R injury [28], type 2 diabetes [29], hepatic
encephalopathy [30], and so on. Particularly, recent years have
witnessed the protective effects of hydrogen on the nervous
system, especially on the brain injury, such as neonatal hypoxia/
ischemia [31] and focal [32] and global [33] cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion.
Interestingly enough, a certain amount of endogenous hydrogen, generated by anaerobes from the large intestine, exists within
human and animals. Hydrogen levels in normal mice have been
studied. In the large intestine, spleen, liver, and gastric mucosa, the
hydrogen level is very high. For example, in the liver it reaches 42
μmol/L [34]. The normal hydrogen level of terminal respiratory gas
is 5–10 ppm, but the levels in patients with lactose intolerance,
ﬂora imbalance, and other diseases can be signiﬁcantly increased
to 90 ppm [35]. A study showed that in the oxidative damage
model of PC12 cells, as long as the medium hydrogen concentration reached 25 μmol/L (maximum solubility, 600 μmol/L in water
and 1200 μmol/L in fat), it showed signiﬁcant antioxidant effect
[7]. Some of the recent ﬁndings further imply the potential
therapeutic effects of endogenous hydrogen. Acarbose, which
inhibits glucose absorption and often causes abdominal distention
in diabetes mellitus treatment, shows a cardiac protective effect,
and one of the main gases generated, which causes the abdominal
distention, is hydrogen [36]. Oral administration of curcumin could
also promote the production of endogenous hydrogen, which may
be one of the mechanisms for curcumin treatment of some
diseases [37]. Moreover, it is reported that oral administration of
bacteria producing hydrogen gas can prevent concanavalin
A-induced hepatitis. And after antibiotics treatment, the protective
effect disappeared, indicating that hydrogen produced by intestinal bacteria was the key for the therapeutic effects [38]. Therefore,
to mobilize the endogenous hydrogen becomes feasible and
provides an important clue for exploring hydrogen use.
Lactulose is a disaccharide composed of fructose and galactose.
It cannot be absorbed by the human digestive system but can be
digested by bacteria colonizing within the gastrointestinal tract,
especially in the colon. Clinically, it is used in the treatment of
constipation [39] and hepatic encephalopathy [40]. Meanwhile,
lactulose can dramatically induce hydrogen by bacterial decomposition [41] and a study showed that 20-g administration could
increase the exhaled hydrogen signiﬁcantly at the same level as
intragastric administration of 300 ml hydrogen-rich saline, with a
longer maintenance time of hydrogen concentration [39]. Lactulose has been used in hydrogen breath tests to determine smallbowel bacterial overgrowth for several decades [42].
In 2012, it was reported that lactulose efﬁciently increased
breath hydrogen levels in Parkinson disease (PD) patients and rats,
marginally ameliorating development of PD in rats. And continuous inhalation of hydrogen gas had marginal effects, whereas
intermittent inhalation had variable but overt effects [43].
Recently, we have demonstrated that lactulose had some protective effects on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis,
including reduction of the severity of colonic lesions, prevention
of colon shortening, amelioration of histological inﬂammation, and
attenuation of MPO activity as well as lipid peroxidation induced
by DSS in mice through induction of endogenous hydrogen
production [12,44]. Based on this, we hypothesized that lactulose

740

X. Zhai et al. / Free Radical Biology and Medicine 65 (2013) 731–741

could potentially ameliorate cerebral infarction injury by inducing
intestinal hydrogen [45], which was veriﬁed in this study.
With regard to the exact mechanisms of the protective effects
of hydrogen, various studies revealed some clues from different
aspects, such as reducing HMGB1 release [46], inhibiting JNK and
NF-κB activation [47], inducing hepatic FGF21 [48], and so on.
However, the answer still remains uncertain.
Previous studies have proven that hydrogen increased the
levels of HO-1, CAT, and SOD [10,49], main downstream antioxidant enzymes regulated by Nrf2. And we found that lactulose and
molecular hydrogen could activate the expression of Nrf2, a pivotal
molecular in the endogenous antioxidant system. Based on the
previous and current studies, two major mechanisms might be
involved: selectively neutralizing excessive ROS and activating an
intracellular antioxidant system.
Temperate ROS can activate the expression of Nrf2, e.g., preconditioning hyperbaric oxygenation increased the expression of
Nrf2 [50]. However, excessive toxic ROS could directly induce
apoptosis and even necrosis [51]. The expression of Nrf2 would be
signiﬁcantly compromised, which was demonstrated in the study.
PCR showed that the Nrf2 mRNA level was signiﬁcantly lower in
the MCAO group than in the lactulose or hydrogen saline group.
It has been proven that toxic ROS such as hydroxyl radicals can be
selectively neutralized by H2 [7], so the remaining relatively mild
ROS might activate the intracellular antioxidant system. By neutralizing highly toxic ROS, hydrogen protects cells from immediate
initiating apoptosis and indirectly activates the endogenous antioxidant system through the Nrf2 pathway.
Nrf2, a positive regulator of the human antioxidant response
element discovered by Venugopal and Jaiswal in 1996 [52], modulates the expression of hundreds of genes, including the familiar
antioxidant genes conferring protection against ischemia/reperfusion
injury [53]. A clinical trial of Protandim (a composition of multiple
synergistic phytochemical Nrf2 activators), showed an average
increase in erythrocyte SOD of 34% in each individual. As the entire
human body contains approximately 7 g SOD, the 34% increase
would result in a steady-state increase of more than 6,000,000 U of
SOD activity distributed throughout the body [54]. Nrf2 activators
have been demonstrated effective in various diseases. Protandim (Life
Vantage Corp.) induced Nrf2 and HO-1 in a rat model of SU5416/
hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, alleviating oxidative
stress and cardiac ﬁbrosis, preserving right-ventricular microcirculation, maintaining right heart function, and reducing the expression of
osteopontin-1 [55]. Lisk et al. in 2013 [56] showed that prophylactic
activation of the antioxidant genome with Nrf2 activators attenuated
high-altitude-induced ROS formation and cerebral vascular leak, and
some drugs currently used to treat acute mountain sickness symptoms had an additional trait of Nrf2 activation. A recent study
showed that hydrogen gas could ameliorate hyperoxic lung injury
through induction of Nrf2-dependent genes, such as HO-1, and
hydrogen did not mitigate hyperoxic lung injury or induce HO-1 in
Nrf2-deﬁcient mice [10].
As the intracellular redox state is chieﬂy regulated by Nrf2
closely related to various diseases [57,58], we examined Nrf2
mRNA and protein levels as well as SOD activity by immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, and Western blot. Lactulose oral administration signiﬁcantly activated Nrf2 expression and increased SOD
activity in the brain compared to the MCAO group, which is most
probably attributed to the induced hydrogen production. Furthermore, we determined the Nrf2 expression of hydrogen, which
manifested modestly higher than lactulose. Therefore, we concluded that hydrogen could not only neutralize the excessive toxic
oxygen species, but also mobilize the internal antioxidant system
by activating Nrf2 expression.
The results of this study have demonstrated that the treatment
of cerebral I/R rats with lactulose markedly increased hydrogen

production and improved antioxidant status and histopathological
properties in brain tissue. And intragastric administration of
antibiotics signiﬁcantly decreased breath hydrogen concentration
and attenuated the treatment effects of lactulose. Therefore, it is
most probable that lactulose is therapeutic against I/R complications and ameliorates neuropathy through the antioxidant activity
of produced hydrogen.
Still some questions need to be clariﬁed. First, because it takes
about 60–90 min to steadily produce hydrogen after oral administration of lactulose, we decided to deliver drugs at the start of
ischemia. However, how fast and how much hydrogen concentrated within the brain and its metabolic half-life remain
unknown. Second, we conﬁrmed the protective effects of lactulose
on the acute phase of stroke. Nevertheless, the possible long-term
curative effects of lactulose on different doses remain to be
clariﬁed. Third, whether lactulose can decompose into other gases
such as methane and hydrogen sulﬁde by bacteria in the gut
remains unclear. Therefore further exploration of the biological
effects of these possible gases will be taken into consideration.
Fourth, we proved that hydrogen generated through the gastrointestinal duct could activate Nrf2. Nevertheless, the exact molecular mechanism still needs to be further explored.
For elderly people under high risk of stroke, lactulose could
improve the general oxidative stress condition and prevent constipation, one of the common causes of stroke. For patients
suffering acute stroke, lactulose could protect the brain tissue
from I/R injuries to some extent, ameliorate the intestinal tract
functions, and prevent constipation, one of the common complications of stroke [59].
This study demonstrated that lactulose has neuroprotective
effects in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury rats. Many questions related to the antioxidant effects of lactulose remain unanswered. Much more work is needed before lactulose therapy for
stroke can be advanced to the clinic.
