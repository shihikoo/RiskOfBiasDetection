SUMMARY
Aims: Brain ischemia activates astrocytes in a process known as astrogliosis. Although this
process has beneficial effects, excessive astrogliosis can impair neuronal recovery. Polyinosinic–polycytidylic acid (Poly IC) has shown neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia–
reperfusion injury, but whether it regulates reactive astrogliosis and glial scar formation is
not clear. Methods: We exposed cultured astrocytes to oxygen–glucose deprivation/
reoxygenation (OGD/R) and used a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)/reperfusion model to investigate the effects of Poly IC. Astrocyte proliferation and proliferation-related molecules were evaluated by immunostaining and Western blotting.
Neurological deficit scores, infarct volumes and neuroplasticity were evaluated in rats
after transient MCAO. Results: In vitro, Poly IC inhibited astrocyte proliferation, upregulated Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) expression, upregulated interferon-b, and downregulated
interleukin-6 production. These changes were blocked by a neutralizing antibody against
TLR3, suggesting that Poly IC function is TLR3-dependent. Moreover, in the MCAO model,
Poly IC attenuated reactive astrogliosis, reduced brain infarction volume, and improved
neurological function. In addition, Poly IC prevented MCAO-induced reductions in soma
size, dendrite length, and number of dendritic bifurcations in cortical neurons of the infarct
penumbra. Conclusions: By ameliorating astrogliosis-related damage, Poly IC is a potential
therapeutic agent for attenuating neuronal damage and promoting recovery after brain
ischemia.

Introduction
Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). They are essential for maintaining a
homeostatic environment in the CNS and for supporting normal
neuronal function. All forms of brain injury can induce astrocyte
activation known as reactive astrogliosis [1,2]. Astrogliosis is characterized by hypertrophic morphology, cell proliferation, and a
rapid increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression.
These morphologic changes are accompanied by secretion of
many cytokines and growth factors. Although this reactive process
is thought to be beneficial in certain pathologic conditions, excessive and persistent astrogliosis with compact glial scar formation
inhibits interaction between neurons and obstructs neuronal axon
regeneration, an effect that is detrimental to recovery from CNS
injuries [3]. In this regard, moderating astrogliosis at the subacute
stage might promote brain repair after injuries such as cerebral
ischemia and trauma [4].
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize distinct pathogen-associated
molecular patterns as well as damage-associated molecular patterns

and play an important role in immune and inflammatory responses.
Reports show that TLRs, especially TLR2 and TLR4, trigger deleterious inflammatory effects in cerebral ischemia–reperfusion (I/R)
injury by activating the TLR/myeloid differentiation factor 88
(MyD88)/NF-kB pathway [5]. By contrast, preconditioning with
ligands of TLR4 or TLR2 attenuated brain ischemic injuries [6–12],
possibly by modulating TLR-related inflammatory signals or inducing production of neuroprotective cytokines such as transforming
growth factor (TGF)-b and interleukin (IL)-10.
Unlike all other Toll-like receptors, TLR3 ultimately signals
through the MyD88-independent pathway to activate interferon
(IFN) regulatory factors and generate type I interferons. Although
TLR3 deficiency in mice does not alter outcome after stroke [9],
reports have shown that TLR3 activation by ligand polyinosinic–
polycytidylic acid (Poly IC) is associated with neuroprotection
against brain ischemic injury [13–17]. However, the mechanistic
details remain unknown. It has been shown that Poly IC-conditioned medium reduces proliferation of cultured human astrocytes under normoxic conditions [18], but it is unclear whether
Poly IC regulates reactive astrogliosis and glial scar formation

under postischemic conditions; thus, we do not know whether
Poly IC affects ischemic outcome. To address this issue, we used
ischemic models in vitro and in vivo to detect the effect of Poly IC
on astrogliosis and determine its underlying mechanism.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Postnatal and adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were provided by
the Center for Experimental Animals, Tongji Medical College,
Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Animal experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of Huazhong University of Science and
Technology and complied with the National Institutes of Health
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Primary Cortical Astrocyte Culture
Primary astrocyte cultures were prepared from cortex of 1-day-old
neonatal rats as reported previously [19]. Briefly, the cerebral cortices were digested with 0.25% trypsin, and the dissociated cells
were plated in flasks at a density of 1 9 106 viable cells/mL. Cells
were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 20%
FBS, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin at 37°C
in a 5% CO2, humidified incubator. The culture medium was
changed every 2–3 days. On day 14 in vitro, the confluent cultures
were incubated with 5 mM L-leucine methyl ester and shaken at
200 rpm with a thermostatic shaker for 6 h to reduce microglial
cell contamination. Then, astrocytes that adhered to the flasks
were collected, suspended in medium to a density of 1–
2 9 105 cells/mL, and seeded on tissue culture plates or dishes
coated with poly-D-lysine (100 lg/mL). We determined the purity of astrocytes by immunofluorescent staining with mouse antiGFAP (Epitomics, Cambridge, UK). Counterstaining with DAPI
was used to indicate nuclei. Results showed that more than 95%
were GFAP-positive cells. All experiments were performed on
cultures at 21–22 days in vitro.

Oxygen–Glucose Deprivation/Reoxygenation
We subjected astrocyte cultures to oxygen–glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) to simulate ischemia in vitro [20,21]. Briefly,
cultured astrocytes were incubated in serum- and glucose-free
DMEM/F12 medium in an anaerobic acrylic jar that was continuously supplied with a mixture of 95% N2 and 5% CO2. After 6-h
OGD, the cells were transferred to standard culture conditions for
an additional 24 h as the reoxygenation period. Poly IC (1 and
10 lg/mL) or normal saline was applied to the media at the beginning of reoxygenation. Cultures supplied with standard medium
and maintained in normoxic conditions served as controls.

sulfoxide. The absorbance value at 570 nm was determined with
a microplate reader. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate,
and the results were expressed as percentages of control values.
To assess cell proliferation, we incubated astrocytes with 10 lM 5ethynyl-20 -deoxyuridine (EdU) during OGD or reperfusion [23].
Cells were then fixed and permeabilized, and EdU that had been
incorporated into newly synthesized DNA was detected with the
fluorescent azide probe (Cell-Light, EdU Alexa Fluor 567 Imaging
Kit, Ruibo, Guangzhou). In addition, we labeled the cells with fluorescent Hoechst 33342 to assess the total cell number. Three random fields for each coverslip were scanned with a 409 objective,
and EdU-positive cells were counted and presented as a percentage of the total cell number. Each experiment was carried out in
triplicate and the results expressed as mean  SD.

In vivo I/R Model
Transient brain ischemia was induced by the middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) model as described previously [24–26].
In brief, rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and placed on
a heating pad to maintain the body temperature at 37°C during
surgery. A 3-0 monofilament nylon suture with a rounded tip was
advanced from the external carotid artery into the internal carotid
artery until it blocked the origin of the middle cerebral artery.
Occlusion was confirmed by a reduction in regional cerebral blood
flow to 15–20% of baseline as recorded by a laser Doppler
flowmeter (MoorVMS-LDF, Axminster, UK). After 90 min of
occlusion, the suture was withdrawn to restore blood flow. The
wound was sutured, and the rat was allowed to recover from
anesthesia before being returned to its cage. Sham-operated rats
underwent the same procedure but without arterial occlusion.
Animals were excluded from the study if laser Doppler flow metry
indicated unsuccessful MCAO or if they died prematurely.
Poly IC (1.25 mg/kg) or normal saline was administrated
intraperitoneally at the onset of reperfusion and at 1, 3, and
5 days after reperfusion. Two investigators blinded to groups evaluated the neurological deficits of each rat at 7 days of reperfusion
using the Zea-Longa method [26] After neurological deficit evaluation, the rats were anesthetized, and the brains were removed
and cut into seven 2-mm coronal slices. Then, the slices were
incubated in 2% 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride monohydrate (TTC) at 37°C for 10–20 min, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde fixation. The brain slices were photographed, and the infarct
area was analyzed by NIH ImageJ software. The total infarct volume was calculated by integration of the infarct areas in sequential 2-mm-thick brain sections [27]. To control for the interference
of brain edema, the infarcted volume was corrected by subtracting
the volume of ipsilateral hemisphere that was not infarcted from
the contralateral hemisphere volume and expressing it as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere volume [28].

Assessment of Cell Viability and Proliferation

Immunocytochemistry for GFAP and Neurocan
Expression

Cleavage of the tetrazolium dye MTT into formazan is used as an
indication of cell viability [22]. In short, 0.5 mg/mL MTT was
added into each well and incubated at 37°C for 4 h. Then, the blue
reaction product, formazan, was solubilized in 100 lL dimethyl

Brain sections and astrocytes cultured on coverslips were
immunostained for GFAP or neurocan as previously described
[19,29,30]. The sections or cells were permeabilized with 0.1%
Triton X-100 for 1 h at 37°C after formaldehyde fixation. Mouse

anti-GFAP (1:200; Epitomics) or goat antineurocan (1:100, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) primary antibody was
applied in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) overnight at 4°C.
After repeated washes, the cells or brain sections were incubated
with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody in 5% BSA for 1 h at
37°C. The coverslips or tissue sections were mounted on glass
microscope slides and photographed under fluorescent microscopy (Olympus BX51, Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan).

Western Blot Analysis for GFAP, TLR3, and TLR4
Protein Expression
Total protein was isolated from the cultured astrocytes or ischemic
cortex after various treatments. Equal amounts of protein (30 lg)
per lane were separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated with
mouse anti-GFAP antibody (1:1000; Epitomics), goat anti-actin
antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-TLR3
antibody (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit anti-TLR4 antibody (1:1000; Abcam), or mouse anti-GAPDH antibody (1:500;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4°C overnight, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The
blots were scanned and quantified with ImageJ software, and the
protein levels were normalized to actin or GAPDH.

Western Blot Analysis for Neurocan Secreted by
Astrocytes
Identical amounts of supernatant (500 lL) from each astrocyte
sample were condensed using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters
(100 kD, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) as described previously.
After protein concentration was determined, the protein samples
were digested with 0.02 U/mL chondroitinase ABC (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA). Equal amounts of protein were separated by
10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Goat
anti-neurocan (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG were used to detect the neurocan expression.

Golgi Staining
Seven days after ischemia, three animals from each group were
deeply anesthetized, perfused transcardially with normal saline
solution, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains
were removed and stained by the modified Golgi-Cox method
[31,32]. Coronal sections of 50 lm thickness were obtained with
a vibratome (Campden Instruments, MA752, Leicester, UK). A
Zeiss fluorescence microscope with 40 9 objective was used to
obtain images under differential interference contrast. Ischemic
penumbral regions were defined as described previously [33]. The
midline between the two hemispheres was identified and then
two longitudinal cuts were made at approximately 2 mm from the
midline. A transverse diagonal cut at approximately the “2
o’clock” position (as shown in Figure 6) was made to separate the
core from the penumbra in the adjacent cortex. We studied the
golgi-impregnated neurons in the region of ischemic penumbra

and measured dendritic branching and length using NIH ImageJ
software [31].

Statistical Analysis
In vitro data are expressed as mean  SD, and in vivo data are
expressed as mean  SEM. Statistical analysis of the results was
carried out by one-way ANOVA with SPSS. Ranked data of neurological deficit scores were analyzed by the nonparametric Kruskal–
Wallis test. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05.

Results
Effects of Poly IC on Astrocyte Proliferation
After OGD/R
Compared with normoxic control, exposure of astrocytes to 6-h
OGD resulted in a significant decrease in MTT reduction, indicating a decrease in cell viability. However, 6-h OGD followed by 24h reoxygenation caused a significant increase in MTT reduction,
indicating astrocyte activation after OGD/R. Poly IC treatment (1–
10 lg/mL) dose dependently reduced OGD/R-induced astrocyte
activation (Figure 1A). Various concentrations of Poly IC had no
effect on astrocyte viability under normoxic conditions, as indicated by MTT reduction (Figure 1B). We examined changes in
EdU-positive cells to further evaluate astrocyte proliferation. Edu
labeling revealed an increase in astrocyte proliferation after 24 h
of reoxygenation; the EdU-positive cell population was approximately 150% that in the control group. Poly IC treatment also
inhibited astrocyte activation and proliferation, as indicated by a
decline in the percentage of EdU-positive cells as compared with
that in the OGD/R group (Figures 1C and D). The effects of Poly
IC on astrocyte viability and proliferation were blocked by a TLR3
neutralizing antibody (Figures 1C, D).

Effect of Poly IC on Astrocyte Morphology and
GFAP Expression After OGD/R Injury
Astrocytes in the control group had a flat, polygonal morphology,
whereas in the OGD group, the cells were clustered and stellate,
with extended processes. At 24 h after reoxygenation, the astrocytes showed a hypertrophic morphology with increased GFAP
immunoreactivity (Figure 2A). In addition, Western blot analysis
showed that GFAP expression was upregulated in the OGD/R
group compared with that in the OGD group. When treated with
Poly IC (1–10 lg/mL), the cells became flat and small. Moreover,
Poly IC dose dependently reduced GFAP expression in astrocytes
after OGD/R injury compared with that in the vehicle-treated
astrocytes (Figure 2B).

Effect of Poly IC on Astrocytic Neurocan
Expression and Secretion After OGD/R
To further evaluate whether Poly IC inhibits glial scar formation, we
examined the expression of neurocan, one of the main scarassociated markers. Based on immunocytochemistry results, the
expression of neurocan did not change significantly after OGD compared with that of control cells. However, the expression of neurocan

Poly IC treatment (1–10 lg/mL) downregulated neurocan expression
compared with that of the vehicle-treated group. Western blot analysis of secreted neurocan levels in the conditioned medium showed
similar results. OGD/R caused a significant increase in neurocan
secretion that was reduced by Poly IC treatment (Figure 3B).

of OGD/R astrocytes induced a significant increase in TLR3
expression (Figure 4A) but did not affect TLR4 expression (Figure 4B). Reactive astrocytes might secrete cytokine IL-6, which is

associated with astrogliosis through a positive autocrine loop, and
another cytokine, IFN-b, was able to suppress glial scar formation
[34–37]. ELISA showed that IL-6 level in the medium was
increased, but that IFN-b level did not change after OGD/R compared with levels in the normoxic control group. Treatment with
different concentrations of Poly IC decreased IL-6 secretion and
increased IFN-b secretion compared with that in the vehicle-treated group. However, the actions of Poly IC were neutralized by
addition of an anti-TLR3 antibody (Figure 4C and D).

Discussion
In this study, 6-h OGD followed by 24 h of reoxygenation induced
cultured astrocytes to exhibit the typical manifestation of a glial
scar, as evidenced by increased cell viability and increased EdUpositive astrocytes. OGD/R also upregulated the expression of
GFAP and neurocan. Notably, TLR3 agonist Poly IC depressed activation and proliferation of astrocytes. We found corresponding
results after a focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Treatment of rats
with Poly IC significantly suppressed astrogliosis around the
infarct tissue.
Several days to 1 week or even longer after ischemia is
regarded as the subacute phase of ischemic injury. During this
time, astrocytes are activated, proliferated, and secreted various
extracellular matrix molecules [20,38]. The period of 16–24 h
after reoxygenation of astrocytes that have undergone OGD
in vitro parallels the in vivo subacute phase of cerebral ischemia
[20,21]. Indeed, we observed scar-forming activity at 24 h.

in vivo and in vitro are consistent with those of previous reports
[4,20,21,39]. Astrocytes are thought to protect the penumbra
during the acute phase of brain ischemia by shielding neurons
from oxidative stress [40]. However, reactive gliosis has inhibitory effects on CNS regeneration and functional recovery when
it is not resolved within the early chronic stage after injury
[41,42].
Our results showed that TLR3 ligand Poly IC depressed astrocyte
activation and proliferation caused by 6-h OGD and 24-h reoxygenation. In addition, Poly IC administration after cerebral I/R in
rats suppressed astrogliosis in the peri-infarct zone and improved
recovery after stroke. These findings are in line with reports that
Poly IC preconditioning reduces cerebral ischemia injury in vivo
and in vitro [14–16,19] and that Poly IC treatment after stroke
exerts therapeutic effects [13]. The neuroprotective effects of Poly
IC were associated with regulation of cerebral I/R inflammatory
injury. Our results demonstrate that the therapeutic effects of Poly
IC against cerebral ischemia may occur partly through inhibition
of glial scar formation.

CNS Neuroscience & Therapeutics 21 (2015) 905–913

To determine the underlying mechanism of Poly IC-mediated
inhibition of astrocyte proliferation, we measured astrocytic
expression of TLR3 and TLR4 and release of cytokines after
OGD/R injury. We observed an increase in the expression of
TLR3 and IFN-b, accompanied by a decrease in the expression of
IL-6. IFN-b is a type I interferon that displays multiple biological
effects and acts as a cell cycle regulator [43,44]. It has shown
neuroprotective effects that are associated with reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and increased anti-inflammatory
cytokine expression in sites of injury. Recently, it was reported
that IFN-b gene delivery suppresses astrocyte activation and glial
scar formation after spinal cord injury [45,46]. In contrast to
IFN-b, IL-6 is thought to contribute to astrogliosis in response to
brain injuries [34,35]. In addition, increased concentration of IL6 in cerebrospinal fluid is correlated with poor stroke outcome
[47]. Reactive astrocytes can induce IL-6 secretion that in turn
leads to further astrocyte activation in a positive autocrine feedback loop [37]. Continuous IL-6 application in vivo via macroencapsulation of IL-6-expressing COS-7 cells induced massive

Figure 5 Poly IC attenuates cerebral ischemia–reperfusion (I/R)-induced brain damage and astrocyte proliferation in rats. Poly IC (1.25 mg/kg) or normal
saline was administrated by intraperitoneal injection at the onset of reperfusion and at 1, 3, and 5 days after cerebral I/R (I/R+Poly IC and I/R+vehicle [Veh],
respectively). (A) Representative 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride-stained brain sections (2 mm thick) and quantification of the total infarct volume at

astrogliosis, and increased IL-6 expression in transgenic mice
caused reactive astrocytosis [34,36]. Downregulation of the IL-6/
IL-6 receptor signaling pathway in astrocytes by IL-6 siRNA
reduced OGD/reoxygenation-induced astrogliosis [21]. Here, we
found that IFN-b was increased in astrocytes, whereas IL-6 was
decreased, after Poly IC treatment, indicating that Poly IC might
suppress astrocyte proliferation by enhancing the expression of
IFN-b and lessening the expression of IL-6. Those actions of Poly
IC were blocked by TLR3-neutralizing antibody, indicating that
Poly IC inhibited OGD/R-induced astrocyte proliferation in a
TLR3-dependent manner. Once stimulated, TLR3 is known to
activate TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-b (TRIF)
adaptor protein, which in turn leads to production of antiinflammatory molecules such as IFN-b and IL-12. TLR3 activation can modulate the TLR4/NF-kB signaling pathway and thus

may inhibit generation of proinflammatory cytokines such as
TNF-a and IL-6 [6,13,19,48].
Studies in experimental spinal cord injury models showed that
TLR4 expression is increased in the gliosis lesion site and that
TLR4 mutant mice exhibit sustained locomotor deficits and
increased demyelination, astrogliosis, and macrophage activation
[45,49]. In addition, it was suggested that TLR4 signaling in the
spinal cord is required for exogenous IFN-b to suppress glial scar
formation [45,49]. These data suggest that TLR4 is important for
regulating gliosis as well as inflammatory processes after CNS
injury. In our study, we also found increased expression of TLR4
in activated astrocytes. Although it has been reported that Poly IC
downregulates TLR4 expression and its downstream signaling
molecules [13,48], our results showed no effect of Poly IC on
TLR4 expression in activated astrocytes.

Results from our study and previous reports indicate that TLR4,
as well as TLR3, is important for modulating inflammation and
gliosis after CNS injury. We hypothesize that Poly IC inhibition of
I/R-induced astrocyte proliferation is mediated by upregulation of
the TLR3/IFN-b signaling pathway and concurrent downregulation of IL-6 production, although the detailed mechanism has not
been explored. Our study demonstrates that TLR3 ligand Poly IC
reduces astrogliosis-associated injuries, thus improving functional
recovery after ischemia in rats. This is the first study to show that
the therapeutic effect of Poly IC involves inhibition of astrogliosis
after I/R injury and that this reduction in astrogliosis may be
mediated in part by regulation of the TLR3 signaling pathway.
Additional research will be needed to identify the exact role of

TLR3 activation after cerebral ischemia, likely in transgenic animals such as TLR3 conditional knockout mice.
