Abstract—MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a major
regulator in neurological diseases, and understanding their
molecular mechanism in modulating cerebral ischemic
injury may provide potential therapeutic targets for ischemic
stroke. However, as one of 19 diﬀerentially expressed miRNAs in mouse brain with middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO), the role of miR-134 in ischemic injury is not well
understood. In this study, the miR-134 expression level
was manipulated both in oxygen–glucose deprivation
(OGD)-treated N2A neuroblastoma cells in vitro and mouse
brain with MCAO-induced ischemic stroke in vivo, and its
possible targets of heat shock protein A5 (HSPA5) and
HSPA12B were determined by bioinformatics analysis and
dual luciferase assay. The results showed that overexpression of miR-134 exacerbated cell death and apoptosis both
in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, downregulating miR-134
levels reduced cell death and apoptosis. Furthermore, nonexpression of miR-134 enhanced HSPA12B protein levels
in OGD-treated N2A cells as well as in the ischemic region.
It could attenuate brain infarction size and neural cell damage, and improve neurological outcomes in mice with ischemic stroke, whereas upregulation of miR-134 had the

INTRODUCTION
Ischemic stroke has been the leading cause of long-term
adult disability and the secondary cause of death in
industrialized nations (Lakhan et al., 2009; He et al.,
2014). As per American Heart Association, stroke is
reported in one person every 40 s and one person dies
of stroke every 4 min in the United States (Lloyd-Jones
et al., 2010). Thus, ﬁnding eﬀective therapeutic targets
that protect the brain against ischemic injury is of paramount importance. Extensive studies have shown that
ischemia is followed by a highly complex series of spatial
and temporal events, such as energy failure, neurotoxicity
of excitatory amino acid, inﬂammatory reaction, and
depolarization of penumbra and apoptosis, which ﬁnally
leads to apoptotic and necrotic neuronal death in the
ischemic core (Dirnagl et al., 1999). Unfortunately, due
to poor understanding of the delicate mechanism of
stroke-induced neuronal death, we still have only few
eﬀective therapies (Endres et al., 2008). Therefore, the
elucidation of molecular mechanisms of neuronal death
can provide new insights into the understanding of neuroprotection, which is indispensable for developing eﬀective
pharmacotherapy.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a set of endogenous singlestranded, non-coding RNA molecules (21–22 nt) found in
eukaryotic organisms. They negatively modulate protein
expression by degradation or repression of their target
mRNAs, depending on the degree of sequence
complementarity (Bartel, 2004). This discovery adds a
new level of posttranscriptional regulatory control to our
understanding of the regulation of gene expression. With
the rapid developments in the ﬁeld of miRNA research,
miRNAs have intensively been studied and have proved

to be important for several processes such as cell growth,
proliferation, diﬀerentiation, development, and apoptosis,
which may in turn serve essential roles in the research
of gene function, disease detection, prevention, and treatment (Liu et al., 2012a; Liu et al., 2012b; Tsai et al., 2013;
Barca-Mayo and De Pietri, 2014; Avci and Baran, 2014).
Recent studies, including those from our laboratory,
have found diﬀerentially expressed miRNAs, which were
identiﬁed using large-scale miRNA microarrays in
mouse/rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
models as well as in stroke patients (Jeyaseelan et al.,
2008; Dharap et al., 2009; Tan et al., 2009; Liu et al.,
2010; Yuan et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012a; Liu et al.,
2012b). More importantly, studies have suggested that
miRNAs are involved in the pathophysiology of ischemic
stroke (Buller et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2010; Peng et al.,
2013). These studies suggested that, following a stroke,
miRNAs showed diﬀerential expression, which resulted
in altered neurotransmitter function, apoptotic process,
oxidative metabolism, and protein chaperones. In our previous results, miR-134, one of the 19 diﬀerentially
expressed miRNAs, was downregulated in the peri-infarct
region of MCAO mice (Liu et al., 2012a; Liu et al., 2012b).
In addition, our preliminary experiment found that miR134 might target heat shock protein A12B (HSPA12B)
and HSPA5 (members of HSP70 family), which was predicted by bioinformatics analysis. It is well known that
members of HSP70 family are ubiquitously expressed,
and structurally and functionally highly conserved across
species. Evidence have suggested that activation of the
heat shock response (HSR), in particular elevation of
HSP70 levels, provides neuroprotection in experimental
models of cerebral ischemic injury (Giﬀard and Yenari,
2004; van der et al., 2005; Ouyang et al., 2012). The protective eﬀects were primarily due to its chaperone role
and ability to protect against various types of stresses.
Further, recent studies have shown that HSP70 may also
directly interfere with immune regulatory eﬀects and cell
death pathways such as apoptosis and autophagy
(Ouyang et al., 2012; varez-Erviti et al., 2013; Kim
et al., 2014). All the evidence suggested that miRNAs,
such as miR-134, might play an important role in neuronal
death or reorganization in ischemic brain. However, the
functional signiﬁcance of miR-134 in cerebral ischemic
injuries still remains unclear.
In this study, we investigated the role and molecular
mechanism of miR-134 in the regulation of neural cell
ischemic injuries using the N2A neuroblastoma cell with
oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) of ischemic injury
in vitro and the mouse transient MCAO model of
ischemic stroke in vivo.

EXPERIMENTAL
Animals and surgery
Adult (8–10 weeks old), male C57BL/6J mice (18–22 g)
were purchased from Experimental Animal Center of
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. To minimize the
number of animals used and their suﬀering, all animal
experiments in this study were carried out in accordance
with the NIH Guide for care and use of laboratory

animals (NIH Publication No. 80-23) and were
consistent with the principles set by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Capital Medical
University.
Before conducting the mouse MCAO model of ischemic
stroke, lentiviral vector (LV)-pre-miR-134 inhibitor-GFP or
LV-pre-miR-134 inhibitor control-GFP (purchased from
Genepharma, Shanghai, PR China) was injected into the
mouse cortex using a stereotaxic instrument under
anesthesia with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg i.p.).
Each mouse was given three cortical injections in the left
hemisphere: the ﬁrst point, 0.3 mm anterior to the
bregma, 3 mm lateral, 2 mm deep; the second point,
0.8 mm posterior to the bregma, 3 mm lateral, 2 mm
deep; the third point, 1.9 mm posterior to the bregma,
3 mm lateral, 2 mm deep. Each point was injected 1.0 ll
of lentivirus suspension containing 1.0  109 TU/ml at a
ﬂow rate of 0.2 ll/min. The needle was left in place for
additional 2 min and withdrawn over a course of 5 min
(Zhou et al., 2010; Papadakis et al., 2013).
After 72 h of lentivirus injection, the mouse MCAO
model of ischemic stroke was performed as described
previously, with minor modiﬁcations (Yin et al., 2010;
Ouyang et al., 2012; Peng et al., 2013). Brieﬂy, mice were
deeply anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection (i.p.)
of pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg). A blunt dissection
was performed, under a stereomicroscope (Stemi 2000,
Carl Zeiss, Dresden, Germany), to expose the left common carotid artery (CCA), left external carotid artery
(ECA), and left internal common carotid artery (ICA).
The CCA artery was temporarily occluded using a suture,
while the ECA artery was permanently sutured as distally
as possible, and another was sutured distal to the bifurcation. This was followed by a small incision in the CCA
artery between permanent and temporary sutures, a 5-0
surgical nylon ﬁlament with a round tip (0.23 mm in diameter) was inserted into the internal carotid artery about
12 mm beyond the carotid bifurcation, thereby occluding
the origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). After 1-h
MCAO, the mice were allowed to recover for 24 h by
removing the suture. In the sham group, all procedures
were identical except for the insertion of an intraluminal ﬁlament. During the surgical procedures, the core body
temperature was maintained at 36.5–37.0 °C using a
heating pad and the respiratory rate was monitored continuously. All the mice had neurologic deﬁcit assessment
at 24 h of reperfusion, and the brains were removed
quickly for later analysis.
N2A cell culture and OGD
Mouse N2A neuroblastoma cells were kindly oﬀered by
Dr. Yun Wang (Peking University, PR China). Cells
were plated in 96-well or six-well plates grown in
Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco,
Grand island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and 100 lg/ml penicillin/
streptomycin and cultured in a 37 °C humidiﬁed
chamber (Thermo Electron LED GmbH, Langenselbold,
Germany), which contained 5% CO2/95% O2. To mimic
the ischemic-like condition in vitro, N2A cells were
exposed to OGD conditions. In brief, the cells were

W. Chi et al. / Neuroscience 277 (2014) 111–122

incubated in glucose-free DMEM media (Gibco) after
three washes with PBS buﬀer and transferred into the
anaerobic chamber with an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and
95% N2 for 3 h (Peng et al., 2013). After OGD exposure,
N2A cells were continued to be cultured in DMEM containing glucose under normoxic condition for reoxygenation for 24 h. Control cell cultures were not deprived of
oxygen and glucose and always placed in norm-oxygenated DMEM containing glucose.

which included miRs from N2A cells. The concentration
of RNAs was detected by NanoDropND-1000
spectrophotometry (NanoDrop Tech, Wilmington, DE,
USA). Reverse-transcription (RT) reactions were
performed using miRCURY LNA Universal RT
microRNA PCR (Exiqon A/S, Vedbaek, Denmark). The
20-ll RT reaction solutions were composed of 25–50 ng
RNAs in 14 ll, 5 reaction buﬀer in 4 ll, and enzyme
mix in 2 ll, which were incubated for 60 min at 42 °C,

Cell transfection and cell viability assay
N2A cells were plated in 96-well or six-well plates. When
cells were 60% conﬂuent, they were transfected with premiR-134, pre-miR negative control, pre-miR-134 inhibitor,
or pre-miR inhibitor control (GenePharma, Shanghai, PR
China) at a ﬁnal concentration of 75 nM and HSPA12B
short interfering RNA (siRNA) and its negative control
(GenePharma, Shanghai, PR China) at a ﬁnal
concentration of 20 lM. To improve transfection
eﬃciency, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) was added in transfection medium according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Five hours later, the
transfection medium was replaced by growth culture
medium. After 48 h, the cells were exposed to 3-h OGD
and 24-h reoxygenation. The cells were then harvested
for cell death assay, RT-PCR, or Western blot analysis.
Cell viability assay was accomplished using 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide
(MTT; 0.5 mg/ml; Applichem, Omaha, NE, USA), as per
the manufacturer’s instructions. Data are shown as
average percentages of viable cells versus the
corresponding normal control.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining
As described previously (Abnosi and Jafari, 2012; Peng
et al., 2013), the TUNEL staining kit (In Situ Cell Death
Detection Kit, POD; Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) was
used to assess programed cell death (PCD), which could
label the nicked TdT-mediated dUTP. The kit was used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions with small
modulations. We seeded N2A cells onto poly-L-lysinecoated glass coverslips and ﬁxed these cells in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 60 min when they have grown to
60% conﬂuence. Equilibration buﬀer was added to the
coverslips before incubating them with nucleotide mix
and rTdT enzyme at 37 °C for 60 min. After stopping the
reaction with a 23 saline–sodium citrate buﬀer, the ﬂuorescence signal was transformed to a diaminobenzidine
signal using the addition of converter-POD at 37 °C for
60 min. Three randomly selected regions from each coverslip were visualized using light microscopy (Nikon 50i;
Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).
Reverse transcription for quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction of mRNAs and miRNAs
We used the miRCURY RNA Isolation Kit (Exiqon A/S,
Vedbaek,
Denmark), in
accordance
with
the
manufacturer’s instructions, to extract the total RNAs,

measured using quantitative RT-PCR. U6 was used as internal
control for quantiﬁcation of miRNAs; 48 h transfection of pre-miR-134

group. (B, C) Downregulating miR-134 by pre-miR-134 inhibitor

opposite eﬀect, which was detected by MTT assays. ⁄P < 0.05,
n = 8 per group.

and then the reverse transcriptase was inactivated by
heat for 5 min at 95 °C.
We performed real-time PCR ampliﬁcation with
Mx3000P (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA)
using the kit mentioned above. Each of these reactions
involved 10 ll SYBR Green master mix, 2 ll LNA PCR
primer mix, and 8-ll diluted cDNA template in a total
volume of 20 ll. Sequences of primers for quantitative

real-time PCR were as follows: HSPA12B forward:
50 -AGGAAGCTCTAGGCAATCGT-30 ; reverse: 50 -TGAC
TTCAGGAACTTCAAGGCTC-30 ; b-actin forward: 50 -ATA
TCGCTGCGCTGGTCGTC-30 ; Reverse: 50 -AGGATGGC
GTGAGGGAG AGC-30 . Below is the guidance of the
real-time PCR protocol: polymerase activation/
denaturation (95 °C for 10 min), 40 ampliﬁcation cycles
(95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 1 min). The b-actin and U6

quantitative analysis results also showed that pre-miR-134 could enhance cell apoptosis, whereas pre-miR-134 inhibitor could reduce cell
apoptosis. ⁄P < 0.05 versus OGD control.

snRNA were used as internal controls to normalize
expression of mRNAs and miRs, respectively, and their
relative expression levels were compared using the
2DCt (DCt sample  DCt control) method (Schmittgen
and Livak, 2008).
Luciferase reporter assay
The 30 untranslated region (30 -UTR) of HSPA5 or the 30 UTR of HSPA12B gene including miR-134 binding sites
was synthesized from RiboBio (Guangzhou, PR China)
and the PCR product was then cloned into the pmiRRB-ReportTM vector (Guangzhou RiboBio Co.,
Guangzhou, PR China). They also provided the mutant
30 -UTR of the HSPA5 and HSPA12B genes from seed
region of the predicted pre-miR-134 binding site. Both
wild type and mutant insert were conﬁrmed by
sequencing.
For luciferase reporter assay, N2A cells were planted
in 24-well plates with 2  104 cells per well. When the
cells were 70% conﬂuent, cells were co-transfected with
100 ng of either the luciferase vector-Wt or pmiR-RBReportTM luciferase vector-Mut and 50 nM of either
pre-miR-134 or 100 nM of pre-miR-134 inhibitor. After
48-h transfection, cells were harvested and assayed
using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega, Madison, WI USA) according to the

115

manufacturer’s handbook. All assays were performed at
least in triplicate. Each experiment was independently
repeated more than three times.
Western-blot analysis
Total protein was extracted from the brain or N2A cells as
reported previously (Kang et al., 2013). Protein samples
(30–60 lg per lane) were separated on 10% sodium
dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS–PAGE) or 12% SDS–PAGE and then transferred
to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes (GE Healthcare,
Little Chalfont, UK). Blots were blocked with 10%
skimmed milk in tween/tris-buﬀered salt solution (TTBS)
for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then
incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies:
HSPA12B (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA) or Caspase-3 (1:1000; Cell Signaling,
Danvers, MA, USA). After incubating with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, goat antirabbit (Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada) or
donkey anti-goat IgG (1:4000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc), signal bands were visualized by chemiluminescence
(GE Healthcare). Western blot was used for quantitative
analysis using the GelDoc-2000 Imagine System (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). We used b-actin as a loading
control to normalize the protein levels.

Fig. 3. miR-134 directly recognized the 30 -UTR of HSPA12B mRNAs. (A, B) Design of a miR-134 reporter vector containing a T7-driven expression
of a luciferase cDNA fused to a HSPA5 30 -UTR, HSPA12B 30 -UTR, mutated HSPA5 30 -UTR, or mutated HSPA12B 30 -UTR. The miR-134-binding
sites in the 30 -UTR of HSPA5 and HSPA12B are shown. (C) There were no detectable changes in luciferase activity after cotransfection of the
luciferase reporter containing 30 -UTR of HSPA5 with pre-miR-134 or pre-miR-134 inhibitor. (D) Luciferase reporter assay results demonstrated that
cotransfection of the luciferase reporter containing 30 -UTR of HSPA12B with pre-miR-134 resulted in a decrease in luciferase activity, whereas
cotransfection with pre-miR-134 inhibitor caused a signiﬁcant increase of luciferase activities. Both pre-miR-134 and pre-miR-134 inhibitor had no
eﬀect on the mutated reporter vectors. ⁄P < 0.05 versus mutant, n = 6 per group.

Measurement of neurological deﬁcit and infarct
volume
The neurological deﬁcits were evaluated after 24 h of
reperfusion, as reported previously (Palmer et al., 2001;
Reglodi et al., 2003). The indicators of the incipient phase
of undisturbed observation were as follows: hypomobility,
lateralized posture, ﬂattened posture, hunched back, piloerection, ataxic gait, circling, tremors, twitches, convulsions, and respiratory distress, while the latish
manipulative phase laid emphasis on the changes in passivity, hyperreactivity, irritability, ptosis, urination,
decreased body tone, forelimb ﬂexion, decreased muscle
strength, body rotation, and motor incoordination. On the
basis of the observations, we graded the neurological
behavior on a 10-point scale. If the criteria for the accurate grade were not matched, the most appropriate number was given as 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.
We measured the infarct volume using 0.5% 2,3,5triphenyltetrazoliumchloride (TTC) staining, as described
previously (Nazari et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012). Each
brain was removed and sliced into ﬁve coronal sections
(1.5-mm thick) using a mouse brain matrix at 24 h after
MCAO. Sections were stained with 0.5% TTC (Sigma,
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37 °C for 15 min in the
dark; normal brain tissues were stained red, while infarct
tissues were not stained (white). We soaked these sections in 4% PFA phosphate buﬀer for 30 min and
scanned. Areas of infarct tissues were measured using
the image-proplus software. The percentage of infarction
was calculated using the formula: infarct volume/total volume of ischemic cerebral hemisphere  100% (Hacioglu
et al., 2005; Ouyang et al., 2012).
Nissl staining
Neural cell damage in brain sections were determined by
Nissl staining. After neurologic deﬁcit score, the mice
were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg
i.p.) and perfused with 0.9% saline and subsequently
with 4% PFA. Mice brains were removed and post-ﬁxed
for 24 h in the same ﬁxative solution at 4 °C, and then
successively immersed in 20% and 30% sucrose
solution at 4 °C to dry-protect. The brains were
sectioned coronally (20-lm thick). Sections were
stained with 0.04% cresyl violet (Sigma–Aldrich)
dissolved in acetate buﬀer for 1 h. After rinsing with
distilled water, sections were dehydrated in a graded
series of ethanol (70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%), cleared
in xylene, ﬁtted with coverslips, and evaluated using
light microscopy (Nikon 50i). Five brain sections were
selected for each animal and three images per section.
Neurons that had shrunken cell bodies or surrounding
empty spaces were considered destined to die and
excluded from the counting. The data were expressed
as the number of surviving cells per ﬁeld.

results of Western blotting show the changes of HSPA12B protein
levels after being transfected with pre-miR-134 control, pre-miR-134,
pre-miR-134 inhibitor control, or pre-miR-134 inhibitor in OGD-treated
N2A cells. (B) Quantitative analysis showed that pre-miR-134
reduced HSPA12B protein levels, whereas pre-miR-134 inhibitor
signiﬁcantly increased HSPA12B protein levels in N2A cells after 3 h
OGD/24 h reoxygenation. ⁄P < 0.05 versus non-OGD normal,
#
P < 0.05 versus OGD normal, n = 5 per group. (C) HSPA12B
mRNA levels were measured by using quantitative real-time RTPCR. b-actin was used as internal control for quantiﬁcation of mRNA
levels. There were no signiﬁcant changes in pre-miR-134 control, premiR-134, pre-miR-134 inhibitor control, or pre-miR-134 inhibitor
groups compared with normal control after 3 h OGD/24 h
reoxygenation.

Statistical Analysis
All data were expressed as mean ± SD, and statistical
analysis was performed using SPSS version 11.5 (SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA). Diﬀerence was assessed by a one-

way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Scheﬀfe
tests. P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

RESULTS
Eﬀect of miR-134 on OGD-induced cell death in
mouse N2A cells
To assess the contributory role of miR-134 in regulating
OGD-induced N2A cell death, pre-miR-134 and premiR-134 inhibitors were used to alter miR-134 levels in
cultured N2A cells. MiR-134 expression levels were
conﬁrmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. As shown
in Fig. 1A, miR-134 expression level was signiﬁcantly
increased (more than sevenfold compared with the

117

normal group) after transfection with pre-miR-134 and
was markedly decreased after being treated with premiR-134 inhibitor (P < 0.05, n = 5 per group). OGDinduced N2A cell death was assayed by MTT method,
and the results clearly showed that upregulated miR-134
substantially aggravated 3 h OGD/24 h reoxygenationinduced N2A cell death, whereas downregulated miR134 eﬀectively reduced 3 h OGD/24 h reoxygenationinduced N2A cell death compared with the normal group
under OGD conditions. The data also indicated that
although miR-134 level was changed, there was no

apparent cell death under normal conditions (Fig. 1B, C;
P < 0.05, n = 8 per group). The data indicated that
increased miR-134 levels worsen ischemia-like injury,
while decreased miR-134 levels mitigate ischemia-like
injury.
To explore whether miR-134 could aﬀect N2A cell
apoptosis, TUNEL assay was used. As shown in
Fig. 2A, C, transfection of pre-miR-134 could
signiﬁcantly enhance 3 h OGD/24 h reoxygenationinduced N2A cell apoptosis compared with OGD-treated
control (non-transfected with miRNA), whereas
transfection of pre-miR-134 inhibitor could attenuate 3 h
OGD/24 h reoxygenation-induced N2A cell apoptosis
(P < 0.05, n = 5 per group). In addition, transfection
with either pre-miR-134 control or pre-miR-134 inhibitor
control had no signiﬁcant diﬀerence compared with the
OGD-treated control. To further verify that miR-134
played a role in N2A cell apoptosis, we also examined
cleaved-caspase-3 protein using Western blotting. It is
well known that cleaved-caspase-3 is an important
indicator of apoptosis. Consistent with the TUNEL
results, the cleaved-caspase-3 protein was remarkably
decreased after transfection of pre-miR-134 inhibitor,

and signiﬁcantly increased after transfection of pre-miR134 (Fig. 2B, D; P < 0.05, n = 5 per group). The data
showed that miR-134 perhaps played an important role
in OGD-induced cell death as well as apoptosis in vitro.
HSPA12B was a target gene of miR-134 in mouse N2A
cells after OGD
Inspired by the result that miR-134 participated in cell
death, we hypothesized that miR-134 might target some
proteins to regulate its process. Through bioinformatics
analysis, we found that miR-134 potentially targeted 30 UTR of two HSP70 family members, HSPA5 and
HSPA12B (Fig. 3A, B). To study whether miR-134 could
directly recognize the 30 -UTR of HSPA5 and HSPA12B
mRNA, we constructed reporter vectors in which T7driven luciferase cDNA was followed by a fragment of
the 30 -UTR from HSPA5 and HSPA12B mRNA
containing the putative miR-134 binding sequence. We
also generated two vectors carrying mutation in binding
sites. These vectors with wild-type or mutant miR-134
binding sequence were co-transfected with pre-miR
control (ctrl), pre-miR-134, pre-miR inhibitor ctrl, or

pre-miR-134 inhibitor into N2A cells. As shown in Fig. 3D,
the luciferase activity assay showed that pre-miR-134
leads to a reduction in luciferase expression in N2A
cells cotransfected with 30 -UTR of HSPA12B, whereas
pre-miR-134 inhibitor caused a signiﬁcant increase of
luciferase activities (P < 0.05, n = 6 per group). As
expected, the pre-miR-134 or pre-miR-134 inhibitor had
no signiﬁcant eﬀect on the mutated reporter vectors.
However, cotransfection of the reporter vectors
containing 30 -UTR of HSPA5 with pre-miR-134 or premiR-134 inhibitor had no eﬀect on the luciferase
expression (Fig. 3C). All the data indicated that miR-134
targeted HSPA12B by directly binding to the 30 -UTR of
HSPA12B mRNA.
To verify the role of miR-134 in regulating HSPA12B
protein, Western blotting and quantitative real-time RTPCR were performed in N2A cell samples in which N2A
cells were subjected to 3 h OGD/24 h reoxygenation
after 48-h transfection with pre-miR ctrl, pre-miR-134,
pre-miR inhibitor ctrl, or pre-miR-134 inhibitor,
respectively. Western blot analysis showed that
HSPA12B protein levels were increased after 3 h OGD/
24 h reoxygenation compared with non-OGD. Of note,
the HSPA12B protein levels transfected with pre-miR134 signiﬁcantly dropped after 3 h OGD/24 h
reoxygenation compared with its OGD control, and the
HSPA12B protein levels transfected with pre-miR-134
inhibitor was remarkably elevated (Fig. 4A, B; P < 0.05,
n = 5 per group), which was consistent with the
luciferase reporter results. However, no detectable
changes were observed for HSPA12B mRNA levels
(Fig. 4C). The inconsistency between mRNA and
protein levels of HSPA12B indicated that miR-134 might
regulate HSPA12B protein by a post-transcriptional
modulation under ischemic-like condition in vitro.

MCAO group and the infarct volume of the brain at 24 h
after transient 1-h MCAO (Fig. 6A–D; P < 0.05, n = 5
per group). Further, pre-miR-134 inhibitor improved neurological deﬁcit compared with MCAO models (Fig. 7A,
B; P < 0.05, n = 5 per group). The results indicated that
downregulation of miR-134 could induce neuroprotection
in ischemic brain insult by upregulating HSPA12B protein
levels.
HSPA12B siRNAs blocked pre-miR-134 inhibitorinduced neuroprotection in vitro
To further verify the hypothesis that miR-134 targeting
HSPA12B perhaps was involved in the biological eﬀects
of miR-134 in OGD-induced N2A cell injury and MCAOinduced ischemic injury, we transfected HSPA12B
siRNA into N2A cells to inhibit its expression. As shown
in Fig. 8A and B, HSPA12B protein levels decreased
following 48-h transfection of HSPA12B siRNAs
compared with normal group both in normal condition
and OGD treatment (P < 0.05, n = 5 per group).
HSPA12B siRNA control had no eﬀect on HSPA12B

Downreglulation of miR-134 increased HSPA12B
protein levels and induced neuroprotection against
ischemic injury in vivo
To evaluate biological role of miR-134 in cerebral
ischemic injury, we injected LV-pre-miR-134 inhibitorGFP or LV-pre-miR-134 inhibitor control-GFP into the
mouse cortex, and the miR-134 levels were conﬁrmed
by quantitative real-time PCR. All samples were taken
from the peri-infarct region of mice after 1 h MCAO/24 h
reperfusion. As shown in Fig. 5E, miR-134 expression
level was signiﬁcantly decreased compared with MCAO
samples (P < 0.05, n = 5 per group). In addition, miR134 level was downregulated in MCAO samples
compared with sham, which was consistent with our
previous results (Liu et al., 2012a; Liu et al., 2012b). We
analyzed the eﬀect of pre-miR-134 inhibitor on HSPA12B
protein level. Western blot analysis showed that pre-miRNA-inhibitor could eﬃciently enhance HSPA12B protein
level compared with MCAO samples, as expected
(Fig. 5A, B; P < 0.05, n = 5 per group). In addition,
pre-miR-134 inhibitor signiﬁcantly reduced the cleaved
caspase-3 level, which suggested that pre-miR-134 inhibitor could attenuate neural cell apoptosis (Fig. 5C, D;
P < 0.05, n = 5 per group). Consequently, pre-miR-134
inhibitor reduced neural cell loss compared with the

protein levels. MTT results showed that downregulation of
HSPA12B by siRNA could signiﬁcantly aggravate N2A
cell injury, and it also blocked the neuroprotection
mediated by pre-miR-134 inhibitor after cotransfection
with pre-miR-134 inhibitor in OGD-treated N2A cells
(Fig. 8C, D; P < 0.05, n = 6 per group).

DISCUSSION
The major ﬁnding of the study is that downregulation of
miR-134 could induce neuroprotection against ischemic
injury by upregulation of HSPA12B protein expression
in vivo and in vitro. In addition, miR-134 was
downregulated following transient MCAO of ischemic
stroke in the brains of mice, which was consistent with
our previous results from a large-scale miRNA
microarray in the peri-infarct region in MCAO mice (Liu
et al., 2012a; Liu et al., 2012b).
Neuronal cell death is a critical part of stroke
pathophysiology, and growing evidence suggest that
miRNA is an important regulator of cell death
(Baczynska et al., 2013). For instance, inhibition of miR124 reduced neuron loss in mouse focal cerebral ischemia by enhancing inhibitor levels of apoptosis-stimulating
protein of p53 (iASPP) (Liu et al., 2013). Peng et al. also
showed that downregulation of miR-181b could reduce
ischemic neuronal death by inhibiting its target mRNA

translation in vitro and in vivo (Peng et al., 2013). However, in brain injury, neuronal cell death was classically
viewed to occur by autophagy, apoptosis, and necrosis.
Cell apoptosis is a physiological process of programed
cell, which is associated with development and in
response to stress to help maintain homeostasis. In this
study, we chose MTT method to assess cell survival rate,
and TUNEL assay to detect cell death, which is not a truly
speciﬁc test for apoptosis, including apoptotic cell death
or programed necrotic cell death. We also detected
cleaved caspase-3 protein levels by Western blotting,
which is a major indicator for cell apoptosis. All these
assays have the ability to reﬂect cell apoptosis in general.
In our previous study, miR-134 content was
downregulated in the peri-infarct region of MCAO mice.
However, the function of miR-134 has been still
unknown in cerebral ischemic injuries. Schratt et al.
showed that miR-134 negatively regulated the size of
dendritic spines, and its inhibition might contribute to
synaptic development, maturation, and plasticity (Schratt
et al., 2006). The downregulation of miR-134 could suppress evoked seizures and occurrence of spontaneous
seizures in mice (Jimenez-Mateos et al., 2012). In addition, the potential role of miR-134 had attracted much
attention in cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and stem
cells, which suggested global expression and importance
of miR-134 (Li et al., 2012; Niu et al., 2013; Poitz et al.,

2013). Recently, serum miR-134 was found to be upregulated in rats after cerebral ischemia, mild cognitive
impairment, and acute myocardial infarction, suggesting
its potential role as a biomarker for diseases
(Jeyaseelan et al., 2008; Sheinerman et al., 2013;
Shwetha et al., 2013). MiR-134 could target a large number of mRNAs (Li et al., 2012; Niu et al., 2013; Poitz et al.,
2013), including limk1, nanog, and mgi2. Hence miR-134
perhaps had diverse and complex roles in brain ischemia.
This study indicated that overexpression of miR-134
aggravated OGD-induced N2A cell death, whereas its
non-expression inhibited OGD-induced N2A cell death.
Furthermore, downregulation of miR-134 eﬀectively
reduced neural cell loss and improved neurological outcomes of mice in transient MCAO model of ischemic
stroke. Of note, our results showed that apoptosis was
obviously decreased in OGD-induced N2A cells and in
the stroke model of MCAO mice transfected with premiR-134 inhibitor. These results indicated that miR-134
might contribute to cell apoptosis by targeting some protein in cerebral ischemia.
HSP70 family particularly plays a key role in cellular
protection and has been detected in various tissues
subject to stress. HSPA12B is a newly discovered
member of the HSP70 family proteins. It was ﬁrst
discovered in human atherosclerotic lesions by Han
et al. in 2002 (Han et al., 2003). Subsequently, studies
revealed that HSPA12B was predominantly expressed in
the endothelial cells. In addition, HSPA12B was also found
in the brain, heart, kidney, and lungs (Hu et al., 2006;
Steagall et al., 2006). Recent studies indicated that
HSPA12B expression was strongly induced in active
microglial cells in inﬂamed spinal cord and in PC12 cells
after OGD exposure (Cui et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2013),
and evidence showed that HSPA12B was involved in
ischemic injury of organs (Li et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2013;
Kang et al., 2013). Overexpression of HSPA12B could
reduce cell apoptosis and improve neurological deﬁcits following cerebral ischemic/reperfusion and promote angiogenesis after myocardial infarction. Interestingly,
miRNAs could bind to the 30 -UTR of its target gene mRNA
to generate either mRNA degradation or protein translation inhibition. Therefore, we speculated that there might
be some interaction between miR-134 and HSPA12B.
As expected, miR-134 regulated HSPA12B by directly
binding to the 30 -UTR of HSPA12B mRNA. Upregulation
of miR-134 resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease of HSPA12B
expression after OGD exposure, whereas downregulated
miR-134 enhanced the expression of HSPA12B.
HSPA12B mRNA levels had no detectable change with
upregulation or downregulation of miR-134. Based on currently available data, we inferred that miR-134 might negatively regulate HSPA12B expression and inhibit its
translation. Fortunately, HSPA12B siRNA could block
miR-134 inhibitor-induced-protection against N2A cell
injury after OGD exposure, which further testiﬁed the interaction between miR-134 and HSPA12B. HSPA12B protein content was increased in the focal cerebral ischemia
by downregulation of miR-134, and increased HSPA12B
induced neuroprotection against cell injury in OGD-treated
N2A cells and MCAO mice of ischemic stroke model.

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, the results of the study indicated that
downregulation of miR-134 could induce neuroprotection
against ischemic injury in vivo and in vitro by negatively
upregulating HSPA12B protein expression. In the future,
the roles of miR-134 in primary cortical neuron, MCAO
mice, and stroke patients would be studied under diﬀerent
control conditions. Further studies in molecular pathway
may perhaps provide new therapeutic opportunities to
promote neuronal survival in ischemic stroke.
