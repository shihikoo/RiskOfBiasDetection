Nuclear-translocated Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
Dehydrogenase Promotes Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase-1
Activation during Oxidative/Nitrosative Stress in Stroke*
Received for publication, December 28, 2014, and in revised form, March 31, 2015 Published, JBC Papers in Press, April 16, 2015, DOI 10.1074/jbc.M114.635607

Background: The link between poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and nuclear-translocated glyceradehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in neurons under oxidative/nitrosative stress remains unknown.
Results: The N terminus of nuclear GAPDH binds with PARP-1, and this complex promotes PARP-1 overactivation both in
vitro and in vivo.
Conclusion: Nuclear GAPDH is a key PARP-1 regulator.
Significance: GAPDH/PARP-1 signaling underlies oxidative/nitrosative stress-induced brain damage such as stroke.
In addition to its role in DNA repair, nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) mediates brain damage when it is
over-activated by oxidative/nitrosative stress. Nonetheless, it
remains unclear how PARP-1 is activated in neuropathological contexts. Here we report that PARP-1 interacts with a
pool of glyceradehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) that
translocates into the nucleus under oxidative/nitrosative stress
both in vitro and in vivo. A well conserved amino acid at the N
terminus of GAPDH determines its protein binding with
PARP-1. Wild-type (WT) but not mutant GAPDH, that lacks
the ability to bind PARP-1, can promote PARP-1 activation.
Importantly, disrupting this interaction significantly diminishes PARP-1 overactivation and protects against both brain
damage and neurological deficits induced by middle cerebral
artery occlusion/reperfusion in a rat stroke model. Together,
these findings suggest that nuclear GAPDH is a key regulator of
PARP-1 activity, and its signaling underlies the pathology of
oxidative/nitrosative stress-induced brain damage including
stroke.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1)2 is a nuclear protein that plays roles in DNA repair, transcription, cell cycle,

proliferation, and cell death (1, 2). Upon activation, PARP-1
consumes ␤-NAD to form poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) on specific
acceptor proteins including PARP-1 itself as the major target
via automodification (3). PARP-1 overactivation is likely to
underlie some neurological conditions; its involvement has
been well characterized in brain damage due to stroke as a
result of DNA strand breakage after exposure to oxidative/nitrosative stress (4, 5). Recent studies have elucidated novel
mechanisms for PARP-1 activation in physiological conditions;
the current body of knowledge suggests that PARP-1 activation
is also regulated by alternative mechanisms (6 – 8). Thus, it is
important to further explore the regulatory mechanisms of
PARP-1 in both physiological and pathological conditions.
Glyceradehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is
also multifunctional (9, 10) in the brain (11, 12). Upon exposure
to oxidative/nitrosative stressors, the active site cysteine 152
residue is oxidized/S-nitrosylated, which triggers GAPDH to
translocate to the nucleus together with Siah (seven in absentia
homolog), an E3-ubiquitin ligase with a nuclear localization
signal (NLS) (13). Additionally, binding of nuclear GAPDH to
acetyltransferase p300/CBT (CREB-binding protein) leads to the
acetylation of GAPDH at lysine 162, which mediates cellular dysfunction in a p53-dependent manner (14). In pathological contexts, this nuclear GAPDH cascade is initiated in stroke models
(15). Thus, posttranscriptional modifications of GAPDH are likely
to play a crucial role in brain damage (16).
Here we report a novel protein interaction between GAPDH
and PARP-1 in the nucleus both in vitro and in vivo. Our data

Nuclear GAPDH Promotes PARP-1 in Stroke
indicate that nuclear-translocated GAPDH is an important regulator of PARP-1 activation in the pathological context of a rat
stroke model. We used an adeno-associated virus 2 vector
(AAV2) to replace or augment endogenous GAPDH in the
adult rat brain by introducing siRNA co-expressing either
exogenous GAPDH or a mutant lacking the ability to bind
PARP-1, and our findings demonstrate that protein binding
ability is required for PARP-1 regulation in the setting of stroke.

Constructs—For bacterial expression, GAPDH or PARP-1
cDNA was cloned into pBAD-HisA (Invitrogen), pGEX-5X-2,
or pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare). For mammalian expression,
the cDNA was cloned into pcDNA4-TO-Myc/HisA (Invitrogen). Deletion constructs or site-directed mutant constructs for
GAPDH or PARP-1 were generated as described in our previous publications (13, 14, 17, 18).
Antibodies—Goat polyclonal anti-PARP-1 antibody (1:2500,
R&D Systems), mouse monoclonal anti-PARP-1 antibody
(1:1000, Enzo Life Sciences), mouse monoclonal anti-PAR antibody (1:500, Enzo Life Sciences), mouse monoclonal anti-myc
antibody (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1:300, Millipore), goat polyclonal
anti-GST antibody (1:5000, GE Healthcare), rabbit polyclonal
anti-His antibody (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit
polyclonal anti-H2B (1:5000, Upstate Biotechnology), mouse
monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine (1:200, StressMarq Bioscience,
Inc.), and rabbit polyclonal anti-dinitrophenyl antibody (SHIMA
Laboratories) were used in the present study. Rabbit polyclonal anti-triosephosphate isomerase antibody (1:1000) was
kindly provided by Drs. Yamaji and Harada (Osaka Prefecture University).
Cell Culture—The generation of stable SH-SY5Y cells for
inducible expression of human GAPDH (hGAPDH) was previously described (17). SH-SY5Y cells were purchased from the
ATCC.
LC-MS/MS—Proteins were separated by 5–20% SDS-PAGE
and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Gel pieces were
digested in 1 mg/ml trypsin, 100 mM NH4HCO3 at 37 °C for
12 h. Tryptic peptides were analyzed using a NanoFrontier L
liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer (Hitachi High-Technologies). Peptides were trapped on MONOLITH TRAP
(Kyoto Monotech) and separated on a MonoCap for fast flow
(GL Sciences). MS and MS/MS analysis with the NanoFrontier
L included the following parameters: the electrospray ionization spray potential was 1100 V in positive-ion mode, curtain
gas flow was 1.0 liter/min, atmospheric pressure temperature
was 140 °C, and scan mass range was m/z 200 –2000 in auto
MS/MS scan mode.
Biochemistry—All of the biochemical techniques were carried out according to existing methods. Production and purification of His- and GST-tagged recombinant proteins were conducted according to published protocols (13, 14, 17, 18).
Subcellular fractionation (isolation of nuclear extracts) and coimmunoprecipitation were performed as described previously
(3, 13, 19). GAPDH glycolytic and PARP-1 catalytic activities
were measured according to our published protocols (17, 20).

The GST pulldown assay was performed as described previously (13, 14).
StructureModeling—AribbondiagramofthehGAPDHmonomer was prepared using the atomic coordinates of hGAPDH
(PDB code 1U8F) with a molecular graphics program, the
PyMOL Molecular Graphics System Version 0.99 software
(DeLano Scientific LLC). A ribbon diagram of the rGAPDH
monomer was prepared using SWISS-MODEL with the crystal
structure of hGAPDH as a template structure (21).
Animal Surgery—Experiments were performed in accordance with the institutional guidelines of the Animal Ethical
Committee. Left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in
male Wister rats (220 –300 g) was performed as described previously (20, 22). Rats were anesthetized with 1.0 –1.5% isoflurane (MSD Animal Health) in 70% N2O and 30% O2 delivered
through a facial mask. The rectal temperature was monitored
using a rectal probe and maintained around 37 °C using a thermostatically controlled heating blanket and an overhead lamp
(Fine Science Tools). Under an operating microscope, a 4-0
monofilament nylon suture (NESCO, Nichi-in Bio Sciences
Ltd.) coated with low viscosity silicone (XantoprenTM, Heraeus
Kulzer) was inserted into the left internal carotid artery through
the left external carotid artery and advanced ⬃18 –18.5 mm
intracranially from the common carotid artery bifurcation to
occlude the origin of left middle cerebral artery. After 1-h ischemia, the rats were re-anesthetized, and reperfusion was performed by the withdrawal of the thread. Physiological characteristics were measured according to published protocols (20,
22); the rats were anesthetized with 1.0 –1.5% isoflurane in 70%
N2O and 30% O2 delivered through a facial mask. Rectal temperature was measured using a rectal probe (Fine Science
Tools). The right femoral artery was cannulated with PE-50
tubing for continuous monitoring of mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate in the polygraph system (RM-6000, Nihon
Kohden). The left common carotid artery was also cannulated
to measure pH, pO2, and pCO2 in the 288 Blood Gas System
(Ciba Corning Diagnostics). Cerebral blood flow was monitored by a laser-Doppler flow meter FLO-N1 (Omegawave)
with a probe placed on the burr hole (2 mm) of thinned skull
over the left lateral cortex 2–3 mm posterior to the bregma and
5 mm lateral to midline. PARP-1 activation and GAPDH
nuclear translocation were assessed by immunofluorescent tissue staining with the anti-PAR and anti-GAPDH antibodies as
described above. The percentages of PAR-positive cells (in
⬎500 DAPI-positive cells) captured by confocal microscopy
were determined. Three or four images in different striatal
regions were counted in each experimental group.
Introduction of siRNA and AAV2-mediated Expression Constructs into Rat Brain—Recombinant AAV2 vectors expressing
either human WT or G10A mutant GAPDH were constructed
according to a previously published protocol (23). To prepare
recombinant AAV2 vectors harboring either the human WT
GAPDH or G10A-GAPDH, each cDNA was cloned into pAAVMCS using the pAAV-MCS vector of the AAV Helper-Free
System (Agilent Technologies). Briefly, hGAPDH cDNA (WT
or G10A) was amplified using the pcDNA4-TO-Myc/HisA harboring WT or G10A as a template for the EcoRI-BamHI sites.
The sequences of the primers were 5⬘-CCGGAATTCCGTTA-

was intracerebroventricularly introduced according to a previously published method (26). The AAV2-injected rats were placed
in a stereotaxic instrument (Narishige). A single 28-gauge
stainless steel injection cannula (Eicom) was lowered into the
left lateral ventricle (coordinates: ⫺0.8 mm posterior to bregma, ⫺1.5 mm lateral to midline, and ⫺4.6 mm ventral to the
skull surface). The rats then received an acute intracerebroventricular injection of Accell siRNA (5 ␮g/rat) in 5 ␮l of Accell
siRNA delivery media (Thermo Scientific) at a rate of 0.5
␮l/min using a microinfusion pump (type ESP-32, Eicom) and a
10-␮l Hamilton microsyringe. After infusion was complete, the
cannula was left in place for 5 min and then removed at a rate of
1 mm/min.
Immunohistochemical Staining in Rat Brain—Frozen coronal sections (10 –15 ␮m) were incubated with 10% goat serum
in PBS for 30 min at room temperature to block nonspecific
binding. For assessment of production of nitrosative stress in
MCAO brains, the sections were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C
with mouse monoclonal anti-nitrotyrosine (1:200, StressMarq
Biosciences Inc.). After three PBS washes, the sections were
treated with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody
(Histofine Simplestain MAX PO, Nichirei) for 1 h at room temperature. The signal was visualized using a 3,3-diaminobenzidine substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). For identification of

Results and Discussion
We initially investigated nuclear proteins that exhibited
enhanced or specific binding with GAPDH when exposed to
the nitric oxide generator NOC18 (also termed DETA

14498 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY

NONOate) in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing exogenous myc-tagged GAPDH (Fig. 1A, left). We analyzed the immunoprecipitates of the nuclear fraction with an
anti-myc antibody and observed that ⬃116-kDa protein(s)
preferentially precipitated with myc-GAPDH (Fig. 1A,
right). We then performed MS and identified 20 peptides
whose sequences perfectly matched those of PARP-1 (Fig.
1B). These results suggest that PARP-1 and GAPDH may
interact in the nuclei of cells exposed to oxidative/nitrosative stressors. We further confirmed the endogenous protein
interaction of PARP-1 and GAPDH in the nuclear fraction
(Fig. 1C).
We next tested the roles for oxidative/nitrosative stress,
nuclear localization, and two major posttranslational modifications of GAPDH: Cys-152 required for GAPDH nuclear translocation in response to oxidative/nitrosative stress (13) and
Lys-162 essential for its interaction with p300/CBP (14). ThereVOLUME 290 • NUMBER 23 • JUNE 5, 2015

fore, we used SH-SY5Y cells stably and ectopically expressing
myc-tagged GAPDH with six different characteristics (Fig. 1, D
and E). Although the exposure to NOC18 significantly elicited
its interaction of WT- and K162R-GAPDH-myc with PARP-1,
replacement of Cys-152 did not even under NOC18-exposure
(Fig. 1D). Then, the addition of a NLS to GAPDH was sufficient
to augment its interaction with PARP-1, and further exposure
to NOC18 did not lead to an additional change (Fig. 1E).
Replacement of Cys-152 or Lys-162 did not affect the interaction in the presence of the NLS (Fig. 1E), indicating that the
JUNE 5, 2015 • VOLUME 290 • NUMBER 23

interaction is critical only for the existence of GAPDH in the
nucleus. Thus, oxidative/nitrosative stressors are likely to facilitate the GAPDH-PARP-1 interaction by inducing the nuclear
translocation of GAPDH.
By utilizing recombinant proteins in vitro, we further
characterized direct binding between PARP-1 and GAPDH
and observed no influence of ␤-NAD (a substrate for both
proteins) (Fig. 2A). Mutagenesis of GAPDH and PARP-1 was
performed to define the critical domains required for the
interaction (the 20 N terminus amino acids of GAPDH (Fig.

2B) and the short C terminus of PARP-1 (Fig. 2C)). The N
terminus of GAPDH contains the Rossmann glycine motif
(GXGXXG) (30), which is highly conserved among species
(Fig. 3A). Among three glycine residues (Fig. 3B), human
Gly-10 and Gly-12 were determined to be crucial for the
binding, as replacement of either amino acid with alanine
abolished binding between GAPDH and PAPR-1 (Fig. 3C).
Replacement of Gly-10 did not affect GAPDH glycolytic
activity (Fig. 3D). Importantly, we observed that GAPDH
activated PARP-1; this activation is likely to depend on their
interactions, as WT, but not Gly-10 mutant, GAPDH activated PARP-1 (Fig. 3E). Although PARP-1 poly-ADP ribosylates many proteins including mainly PARP-1 itself (3),
GAPDH is not a PARP-1 substrate (Fig. 3F). The interaction
and functional influence of GAPDH was observed for both
the human and rat proteins (Fig. 3, G and H).
Oxidative/nitrosative stress-induced PARP-1 activation and
its pivotal role in brain damage have been established in an

14500 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY

MCAO stroke model (4, 27). Furthermore, the nuclear translocation of GAPDH has also been reported in the MCAO model
(15). To examine whether GAPDH-PARP-1 interaction and
nuclear GAPDH-induced PARP-1 activation occurred in vivo,
we conducted the MCAO rat stroke model. We first confirmed
production of both nitosative stress (Fig. 4A) and oxidative
stress (Fig. 4B) in the striatum (ischemic core) of MCAO brain
at 1 h after reperfusion. At this time point, we tested whether
the interaction between GAPDH and PARP-1 occurred in this
stroke model. Protein extracts from MCAO, but not sham rats,
revealed an endogenous interaction significantly (Fig. 4C). Histological examination revealed that GAPDH had translocated
to the nucleus and activated PARP-1, as indicated by augmented PAR levels in the MCAO brain (Fig. 4D). To determine
whether the GAPDH-PARP-1 interaction is indeed crucial for
PARP-1 activation in vivo, we replaced endogenous rGAPDH
by introducing a corresponding siRNA and co-expressing exogenous hGAPDH via an AAV2 (Fig. 5A). Under this experimenVOLUME 290 • NUMBER 23 • JUNE 5, 2015

tal condition, we did not observe any change in cerebral blood
flow or major physiological characteristics (Fig. 5, B and C). We
confirmed successful knockdown of endogenous rGAPDH and
did not observe degradation of exogenous hGAPDH following
the application of rGAPDH siRNA (Fig. 6A). These GAPDH
activities were maintained in each genetically modified brain
(Fig. 6B). We also validated that human WT, but not Gly-10
mutant, GAPDH interacted with rat PARP-1 in vitro (Fig. 6C).
Exogenous hGAPDH was expressed in the neurons of both the
rat striatum and cortex in vivo (Fig. 6, D and E). Both exogenous
WT and Gly-10 mutant hGAPDH were found in the nucleus 1 h
after reperfusion (Fig. 6F). Under these experimental conditions, we examined PARP-1 activation in the striatum of
MCAO rats and investigated the impact of the GAPDHPARP-1 interaction. As reported (4), robust PARP-1 activation

was observed in the MCAO model (Fig. 6G). Interestingly,
replacement of exogenous rGAPDH with the Gly-10 hGAPDH
mutant lacking the ability to bind PARP-1 abolished the activation (Fig. 6G). The GAPDH-PARP-1 interaction is likely to play
a pivotal role in this process, as replacement of endogenous
rGAPDH with exogenous WT hGAPDH failed to abolish
PARP-1 activation.
To further address whether the PARP-1-GAPDH interaction mediates MCAO/reperfusion-induced brain damage in
a rat stroke model, we measured infarct volumes and neurological functions under the same conditions. At 23 h after
reperfusion, intense infarctions were observed in MCAO
model rats (Fig. 7A), but replacement with Gly-10 mutant
hGAPDH significantly reduced MCAO/reperfusion-induced infarct volumes. No significant reduction of infarct

volume was observed for exogenous WT hGAPDH (Fig. 7A).
Notably, the neurological test results were better in rats with
smaller infarct volumes (Fig. 7B). Thus, our findings indicate
that nuclear GAPDH is likely to contribute MCAO/reperfusion-induced brain damage via regulation of PARP-1 activity
in a rat stroke model.
In the present study we demonstrated that nuclear-translocated GAPDH mediates PARP-1 activation in the setting of
oxidative/nitrosative stress in a rat stroke model. Our data
from mutant GAPDH lacking the ability to bind PARP-1
indicate that this interaction is necessary to promote
PARP-1 activity. These results suggest that PARP-1 overactivation requires both DNA strand breakage and binding to
nuclear GAPDH. A recent review postulated that PARP-1
binding to DNA strand breaks is not the only mechanism for
PARP-1 activation; protein-protein interactions are also
considered to be involved (8).
GAPDH-induced PARP-1 activation is thought to depend on
the interaction between the two proteins. Langelier et al. (31)
proposed a PARP-1 activation model in which conformational
distortions of the C terminus catalytic domain of PARP-1
(amino acids 656 –1014) leads to PAR formation regardless of
its DNA binding ability. Our data indicate that GAPDH specifically binds to the short C terminus of PARP-1 (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, a docking model of GAPDH-PARP-1 confirmed that
their interaction is possible (Fig. 8).
Our results also demonstrate that the interaction between
GAPDH and PARP-1 is involved in brain damage. When
massive oxidative/nitrosative stress occurs after a stroke,
nuclear-translocated GAPDH may play a crucial role in the
PARP-1-dependent cell death cascade (32, 33). Thus, the
findings in this study reveal a possible method for combating
brain damage caused by the PARP-1-dependent cell death
