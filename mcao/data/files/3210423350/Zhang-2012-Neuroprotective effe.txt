Abstract: The therapeutic effect of stroke is hampered by the lack of neuroprotective drugs
against ischemic insults beyond the acute phase. Carnitine plays important roles in
mitochondrial metabolism and in modulating the ratio of coenzyme A (CoA)/acyl-CoA.
Here, we investigate the neuroprotective effects of L-carnitine (LC) and Acetyl-L-carnitine
(ALC) pre-treatment on ischemic insults under the same experimental conditions. We used
a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model to evaluate the protective roles
of LC and ALC in acute focal cerebral ischemia in vivo and to understand the possible
mechanisms using model of PC12 cell cultures in vitro. Results showed that ALC, but not
LC, decreased infarction size in SD rats after MCAO in vivo. However, both LC and ALC
pretreatment reduced oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell injury and decreased
OGD-induced cell apoptosis and death in vitro; at the same time, both of them increased
the activities of super oxide dismutase (SOD) and ATPase, and decreased the concentration
of malondialdehyde (MDA) in vitro. Thus, our findings suggested that LC and ALC
pre-treatment are highly effective in the prevention of neuronal cell against ischemic injury
in vitro, however, only ALC has the protective effect on neuronal cell injury after
ischemia in vivo.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke is considered as one of the leading causes of death and disability all over the
globe [1]. A considerable proportion of strokes result from thromboembolic occlusion of major
intracerebral vessels including the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Following focal cerebral ischemia,
neuronal cell death is caused by both the core necrosis and the penumbra apoptosis within minutes to
days [2–4]. The neuronal death after ischemia is closely linked to the essential role of mitochondrial
metabolism. Cerebral ischemia leads to mitochondrial dysfunction due to lack of oxygen, leaving the
glycolytic metabolism as a main pathway for energy production. Inhibition of mitochondrial
respiratory chain triggers generation of lactate and hydrogen ions and dramatically reduces ATP
generation leading to a dysregulation of cellular ion metabolism with subsequent intracellular calcium
accumulation [5]. Although many efforts were made to develop novel drugs in order to rescue neurons
from delayed neuronal death (DND) in the penumbral region, few drugs have shown efficacy currently
in stroke patients [6]. Therefore we sought to elucidate the therapeutic benefits of prophylactic drugs to
help reduce the severity of the stroke.

(4-N-trimethylamino-3-hydroxybutyric acid, LC) (Figure 1a) is an essential co-factor in
the metabolism of lipids and consequently in the production of cellular energy [7]. This molecule plays
important physiological roles in the β-oxidation of fatty acids by facilitating the transport of long-chain
fatty acids across the mitochondrial inner membrane as acylcarnitine esters and the modulation of
intracellular co-enzyme A homeostasis [8]. Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC), an ester of LC (Figure 1b),
serves as a source of acetylcholine and L-glutamate, and also contributes to energy-producing reactions.
Several studies have suggested that LC and ALC may play a neuroprotective role in hypoxic-ischemic
brain injury [9,10]. The early report demonstrated that LC significantly decreased infarct size
compared with saline [11], but this result could not be replicated in the subsequent experiments.
Recent studies have shown that LC pre-treatment ameliorated brain injury after hypoxia-ischemia in
newborn rats through reducing apoptotic cell death and inhibiting the production of platelet-activating
factor (PAF) [12]. Others studies have also shown ALC may be of benefit in reducing the infarct size
and striatal glutamate outflow following focal cerebral ischemia in rats [13]. It is postulated from

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13

2080

references that LC and ALC have different effects on different brain regions as well as different
treatment methods of them have different effect on neuronal apoptosis. As ALC is an ester of LC, the
question is which one is better to reduce the brain injury following focal cerebral ischemia? We have not
seen the comparative study for LC and ALC under the same experimental conditions to clarify its
neuroprotective effects against ischemic injury.
This study was therefore designed to determine the effects of LC and ALC administration on brain
infarct size under the same experimental conditions in vivo and to understand the possible mechanism
using in vitro model of PC12 cell cultures.
2. Results
2.1. ALC, But Not LC, Decreases Infarction Size in SD Rats after MCAO
To illuminate the protective effects of LC and ALC in acute focal cerebral ischemia, we performed
MCAO in male SD rats. MCAO model group rats received intraperitoneal injection of PBS only, as
well as LC and ALC group rats received intraperitoneal injection of LC or ALC (100 mg/kg) 24 h
prior to MCAO, respectively. Animals were sacrificed 6 h after MCAO or sham surgery for
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. A typical TTC staining is shown in Figure 2a. No
infarction was found in any rats with sham surgery group. ALC (n = 6) pre-treatment obviously
decreased the infarction size of cortical infarction compared to PBS pretreatment (n = 5) (p ＜ 0.05).
However, LC pre-treatment had no significant effect on infarct size compared to control group
(p ＞ 0.05, Figure 2a,b).

2.2. LC and ALC Pretreatment Reduces Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation-Induced Cell Injury
To elucidate the different protective role of LC and ALC on the infarction size in rats after MCAO,
oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell injury, a popular neuronal cell injury model in vitro

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13

was used. We firstly detected the effect of OGD on PC12 cells. After the PC12 cells were incubated in
hypoxic conditions in the absence of glucose for 30, 60, 90, and 120 min, the effects of such conditions
on the cell viability were determined. The results showed that OGD caused progressive reduction in
the cell viability time-dependently as determined by thiazolyl blue terazolium bromide (MTT) assay
(p ＜ 0.05, Figure 3a). After a 120 min exposure to OGD, the cell viability had dropped to ~60%. The
effects of LC and ALC on the cell viability of non-OGD PC12 cells were also observed. The results
showed that the cell viability of the non-OGD PC12 cells were not affected by pretreatment with LC
and ALC (p ＞ 0.05, Figure 3b). However, both LC and ALC pretreatment increased dose-dependently
the viability of PC12 cells exposed to OGD (p ＜ 0.05, Figure 3c).

2.3. Pretreatment with LC or ALC Decreases OGD-Induced Cell Apoptosis and Death
To further illuminate the possible mechanisms responsible for the increase in OGD-induced PC12
cell viability by LC and ALC pre-treatment, the cell apoptosis and death rate were detected by TUNEL,
SYTOX, and PI staining, respectively. The positive stained cells were calculated by counting 5
randomly selected fields, and results were expressed as % positive cells/total cells ± SEM. As shown
in Figure 4, the percentage of positive TUNEL cells induced by OGD was significantly reduced by LC
and ALC pre-treatment (p ＜ 0.05), suggesting that LC and ALC inhibit OGD-induced PC12 cell
apoptosis (Figure 4a). The percentage of positive SYTOX and PI stained cells were calculated as
above. The results showed that the percentage of positive SYTOX and PI cells induced by OGD was
significantly reduced by LC and ALC pre-treatment (p ＜ 0.05), suggesting that LC and ALC inhibit
OGD-induced PC12 cell death (Figure 4b, c). Taken together, LC or ALC pre-treatment increased the
cell viability by decreasing OGD-induced cell apoptosis and death.

2.4. Effects of LC or ALC on the SOD, MDA, and ATPase in OGD-Induced PC12 Cells
Because super oxide dismutase (SOD) is considered as a primary antioxidant defense in cells, we
observed the SOD activity in the PC12 cells to determine whether LC and ALC had regulatory effects
on SOD activity after OGD. The results showed that LC or ALC pre-treatment increased the SOD
activity after OGD (p ＜ 0.05). ATPase, which involves in fluid, electrolyte, and nutrient transport [14],
was also measured. As shown in Figure 5, the incubation of PC12 cells in OGD conditions could
decreased obviously the ATPase activity (p ＜ 0.05). When the cells were pretreated with LC or ALC
for 24 h, the ATPase activity was significantly increased in OGD PC12 cells (p ＜ 0.05). The levels of
malondialdehyde (MDA), which is a byproduct of a free radical attack on lipids, increased
significantly after PC12 cells exposure to OGD compared to normal control. LC or ALC pre-treatment
for 24 h could decrease MDA levels significantly in OGD PC12 cells (p ＜ 0.05).

3. Discussion
LC and ALC cross the blood-brain barrier and are widely distributed in the central nervous system.
They have wide roles in brain metabolism [7]. The previous study showed that carnitine has a
protective effect on hypoxia-ischemia injury [9]. Moreover, carnitine play essential roles in inhibiting
glutamate-mediated toxicity in vivo via decreasing the affinity of glutamate to its receptor and
increasing glutamate transport [15,16]. Due to different isomers or modification of the drugs play
different roles in medical treatment [17], the effects and underlying mechanisms of LC and its acetyl
ester ALC on the infarction size in rats after MCAO, were tested in the same experimental conditions.
Clinically, stroke patients need to receive most effective therapy within 6 h. Consequently, in the
present study, we focused on the effects of LC and ALC pretreatment on the infarct size at 6 h after
MCAO. We found that pretreatment with ALC, but not LC, decreased the infarction size significantly
in rats after MCAO, suggesting that ALC was better to reduce the brain injury following focal cerebral
ischemia. Plasma concentration of free LC is in dynamic balance with ALC and both of them are
actively transported into cells via the organic cation/carnitine transporter (OCTN) system [18]. It is
reported that OCTN2 is functionally expressed in rat astrocytes, and is responsible for LC and ALC
uptake in these cells. The subsequent kinetic analysis showed the Michaelis-Menten constant of LC
was higher than that of ALC, suggesting that the affinity of LC to its transporter is lower than that of
ALC [19]. So it is postulated that the different affinity of LC or ALC might play an important role in
exerting its neuroprotective effects on ischemic injury. A most recent report suggested that ALC
elevate the glucose uptake and the glucose transporter protein expression level, and the acetyl moiety
of ALC is metabolized for energy in both astrocytes and GABAergic neurons, which may also
contribute to its effect of reducing neurotoxicity and neuronal degeneration [20,21]. To elucidate the
different mechanisms of LC and ALC on the infarction size in rats after MCAO, an in vitro ischemic
model (oxygen glucose deprivation, OGD) in PC12 cells were used as reported previously [22]. It is
well known that PC12 cells are the most widely used cellular model for studying neuronal diseases
including Alzheimer, Parkinson, stroke, and ischemia. In the present study, in vitro ischemia (OGD)
was delivered by incubating PC12 cells with a medium in which glucose was omitted and oxygen was
replaced with N2. The viability of PC12 cells decreased progressively when exposed to OGD for
different times, which indicated that OGD could induce ischemic injury under our experimental

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13

2085

conditions. It is reported that ALC played a role in neuroprotection during hypoxia, which is attributed
to mitochondrial biosynthesis regulated by ERK1/2-Nrf2 signaling [23]. We found that LC or ALC
itself did not affect the viability of PC12 cells under normal cultural conditions, but pre-incubation
with LC or ALC increased the PC12 cell viability when exposed to OGD. Our data suggest that LC
and ALC both are capable of protecting the PC12 cells from OGD-induced damage in vitro.
Lately, it is reported that necrotic and apoptotic cell death of many neurons in the ischemic areas
was found after a stroke event [24]. We hypothesized that LC and ALC would increase the cell
viability by decreasing OGD-induced cell apoptosis and death. In agreement with this hypothesis, our
studies in vitro showed that LC and ALC reduced the cell apoptosis and death rate by TUNEL,
SYTOX, and PI staining, respectively. It is indicated that the reduction of cell apoptosis and death rate
by LC or ALC might contribute to its neuroprotective role following in vitro ischemia.
Oxidative stress has been involved in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases including
acute stroke. Dysfunctional mitochondria exposed to oxygen in the penumbral area of the infarct
generate higher amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) than can be scavenged by the antioxidant
systems, leading to oxidative stress [25]. Ischemic damage is induced by the accelerated formation of
reactive oxygen species including superoxide and nitric oxide (NO) radicals. These ROS can damage
cellular components such as proteins, lipids, and DNA, resulting cell apoptosis and death. Recent
reports demonstrated that LC supplementation has a protective role on exhaustive exercise-induced
oxidative stress [26]. Previous studies have demonstrated that SOD has a significant role in
neuroprotection in nature [27], and ALC may lead to SOD stabilization [28].
Moreover, as is well known, carnitine prevents free radical formation via inhibiting the activity of
enzymes involving their generation and via inducting antioxidant mechanisms [29]. Our study showed
the activity of SOD was significantly decreased in OGD PC12 cells as compared to non-OGD cells,
and both LC and ALC significantly prevented the decrease of the activity of SOD. The same changes
did occur in the activity of ATPase. In addition, we also estimated the content of MDA, which is a
byproduct of a free radical attack on lipids. These results suggested that LC and ALC have the
neuroprotective effect by improving the state of oxidative stress during ischemic injury.
Although the exact mechanisms responsible for the inhibition of ischemic injury by ALC in vivo are
still unclear at this time, at least, our results provide the evidences that LC and ALC pre-treatment are
highly effective in the prevention against neuronal cell injury in vitro in the same test condition, which
is consistent with a previous report [30]. Based on our results, we speculated that the different
pharmacokinetics, mechanism and time of action may result in the different effects of LC and ALC on
ischemic injury in vivo. Thus, further studies will be required to elucidate the exact mechanisms.
4. Experimental Section
4.1. Experimental Animals
All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Hebei
medical University. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300 ± 30 g were kept under constant
environmental conditions (temperature, 22 ± 2 °C; humidity, 55 ± 5%; 12-/12-h light/dark cycle) in the
Animal Research Center of Hebei medical University. Before and after all experimental procedures, all

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13

2086

animals had free access to food and water. Before the experimental procedures, all animals were
clinically normal and without infection or inflammation, and had no neurological deficits. Rats were
divided into four groups (sham, MCAO, LC and ALC group). Anesthesia was induced by 4.5%
halothane in N2O:O2 (70%:30%) and was maintained by inhalation of 1.5% halothane by mask.
4.2. Transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO)
An intraluminal filament model was used to induce transient MCAO. Briefly, through a midline
neck incision, the right common, external, and internal carotid arteries were dissected and exposed.
The common and external carotid arteries were ligated by sutures. A silicone-coated nylon filament
(diameter: 0.37 mm, Doccal Corporation, Redlands, CA, USA) was then inserted into the external
carotid artery and gently advanced into the internal carotid artery, until mild resistance was felt,
indicating that occlusion of the origin of the middle cerebral artery in the Willis circle was achieved.
The wound was sutured, and the rats were returned to their cages. To understand the protective effects
of LC and ALC (Sigma, St. Louis, MS, USA) on MCAO model, intraperitoneal injection of LC or
ALC (100 mg/kg) 24 h before MCAO. MCAO group rats received intraperitoneal injection of PBS only.
4.3. Measurement of the Infarct Size
All animals were decapitated 6 h after MCAO. Their brains were quickly removed, placed in cold
saline solution for 10 min, and then cut into 2-mm-thick coronal slices using a rodent brain matrix.
Five selected sections were stained in a 2% solution of TTC (Sigma, St. Louis, MS, USA) at 37°C for
30 min. Areas ipsilateral to the occlusion, which could not be stained, were recorded as infarcted. After
the sections were fixed with 10% formaldehyde, infarct size was measured by using an imaging system
(AIS, Imaging Research Inc.), The corrected infarct size was calculated by using an indirect method in
order to compensate for the effect of brain edema [31].
4.4. Cell Culture and Treatments
Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, USA)
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 kU/L of penicillin, and
100 mg/L of streptomycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MS, USA) at 37 °C with a 5% CO2 atmosphere in a
humidified incubator. All treatments were performed on cells at 60% to 80% confluence.
4.5. Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation (OGD)
In order to mimic ischemic-like conditions in vitro, PC12 cells were incubated with glucose-free
buffer contained 154 mmol/L NaCl, 5.6 mmol/L KCl, 3.6 mmol/L NaHCO3, 2.3 mmol/L CaCl2 and
5.0 mmol/L HEPES at 37 °C for 15 min in an oxygen-free N2/O2 (95%/5%) atmosphere, and then the
chamber was sealed and the cells were culture in the hypoxic conditions for 30, 60, 90, and 120 min.
After incubation for 120 min, cells were removed from the anaerobic chamber to normal culture
conditions. The cells were divided into control, OGD, OGD plus LC pretreatment and OGD plus ALC
pretreatment groups. Glucose (1.0 g/L) was added to make glucose containing buffer. The control

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13

2087

group were incubated in glucose containing buffer, and maintained under normoxic conditions. Other
groups which pretreated with PBS (OGD group), LC (200 µmol/L) or ALC (200 µmol/L) for 24 h,
respectively, were exposed to OGD for 3 h.
4.6. Cell Viability Assay
Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. PC12 cells were seeded at 1 × 104 cells/well in 96-well
plates and allowed to grow in the DMEM medium for 24 h. After LC/ALC and OGD treatment, cells
were incubated with 5 mg/mL MTT (Sigma, St. Louis, MS, USA) for 4 h, and subsequently solubilized
in DMSO. The absorbency at 570 nm was then measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) reader. Experiments were repeated at least three times, and the data were expressed as
the means ± SEM.
4.7. Measurement of Cell Death and Apoptosis
The TUNEL method was used to identify the DNA fragmentation of apoptotic cells. The procedure
was performed following the manufacturer’s instruction (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Briefly, PC12
cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and washed with PBS 3 times. Then the cells
were incubated with 3% H2O2 in 70% methanol for 10 min and washed with PBS twice. After that, the
cells were incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min on ice. The slides were
washed with PBS twice and the areas around specimens were dried. Subsequently, TUNEL reaction
mixture (50 μL) was added to each sample. And then, slides were incubated in a humidified atmosphere
for 60 min at 37 °C without light. After washing with PBS 3 times, stained sections were analyzed
with fluorescence microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). SYTOX green (Invitrogen, Springfield, OR,
USA) and propidium iodide (PI, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used to stain the cells with
disrupted membranes (dead cells). Briefly, for SYTOX green staining, SYTOX green (25 nmol/L) was
added to the PC12 cell cultures. After 10 min at room temperature, specimens were observed with a
fluorescence microscopy. For PI staining, PC12 cells were incubated in the PI staining solution
(5 μg/mL in 10 mmol/L PBS) for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. Then, the specimens were
washed with PBS and mounted on slides. All the specimens were observed with a microscope. Thus,
this assay includes apoptotic, dead, and viable cells.
4.8. Measurement of SOD, ATPase Activities and MDA Content
Neuroprotective effect of LC and ALC was confirmed in terms of excitotoxicity (ATPase activity)
and oxidative stress (malondialdehyde, MDA; super oxide dismutase, SOD) in the PC12 cells. Briefly,
total protein was isolated and the protein content was determined with the Bio-Rad Bradford protein
assay. SOD, ATPase activities and content of MDA assays were performed using the commercial assay
kits (Jiancheng Institute of Biotechnology, Nanjing, China), following the manufacturer’s protocols.

4.9. Statistical Analysis
All data are expressed as mean ± SEM. One-way ANOVA and Duncan’s multiple comparison test
of the means were done using the software SPSS 16.0 [32] to compare the data obtained. A p-value < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
5. Conclusions
In this work, we studied the effects of carnitines, LC and ALC, in protecting hypoxia-ischemia
injury. The principal findings of this study can be summarized as follows: (1) ALC pre-treatment
decreased the infarct size in the model of MCAO, however, LC pre-treatment had no effect on the
infarct size in the model of MCAO; (2) both LC and ALC pre-treatment reduced OGD-induced PC12
cell injury in vitro; (3) both LC and ALC pre-treatment decreased OGD-induced PC12 cell apoptosis
and death in vitro. These findings suggested that LC and ALC pre-treatment are highly effective in the
prevention of neuronal cell against ischemic injury in vitro; however, only ALC pre-treatment has a
protective effect on neuronal cell injury after ischemia in vivo.
