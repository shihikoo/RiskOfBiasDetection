Leonardo CC, Mendes M, Ahmad AS, Doré S. Efficacy of
prophylactic flavan-3-ol in permanent focal ischemia in 12-mo-old

consumption of flavan-3-ol-containing foods, including (⫺)-epicatechin (EC), has been linked to lower incidence of cardiovascular
disease and stroke. We previously demonstrated nuclear transcription
factor erythroid 2p45-related factor-2 (Nrf2) -dependent EC efficacy
in reducing stroke-induced deficits in 2-mo-old mice; yet stroke is
primarily a disease of the elderly. Because neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular dysfunction are hallmarks of aging, we
tested whether Nrf2 mediates EC efficacy in aging mice through
modulation of glial responses and blood brain barrier permeability.
First, we compared anastomosis in naïve wild-type and C57BL/6
Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice to identify potential differences in cerebrovascular
architecture. Data showed no significant differences in the number of
anastomoses or mean intersection points, indicating similar gross
vascular physiology. To assess efficacy and mechanisms of protection, wild-type or Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice were administered the minimum
effective EC dose established in our previous studies before the
permanent distal middle cerebral artery occlusion. Similar to previous
results with young mice, 12-mo-old wild types also showed significant
reductions in infarct volume (41.01 ⫾ 29.57%) and improved performance in removing adhesive tape relative to vehicle-treated controls,
whereas a trend toward protection was observed in Nrf2⫺/⫺. However, EC did not reduce immunoreactivity for the microglia/macrophage marker anti-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1, suggesting that dampened activation/recruitment did not account for EC
protection. Furthermore, there were no differences in mouse IgG
extravasation or spontaneous hemorrhage between EC-treated groups.
These data demonstrate that EC protection occurs independent of
microglia/macrophage modulation or blood brain barrier preservation,
suggesting that the glial cell responses in young mice are compensatory to another, and potentially novel, protective mechanism.

THE ONLY VIABLE TREATMENT for ischemic stroke, aside from
supportive care, is thrombolytic therapy, which must be initiated within 4.5 h of stroke onset (1, 21, 32). In the aging
population, however, health risks due to preexisting medical
conditions often prohibit this therapeutic option. Because high

blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and other factors
limit clinical treatment options in a majority of patients, the
ability to mitigate stroke injury through prophylactic neuroprotective “priming” is currently an area of great interest. Complementary and alternative medicinal (CAM) therapy represents a distinct approach whereby the consumption of natural
compounds induces protective pathways that enable the brain
to mitigate injury when an ischemic event arises. The success
of such approaches would therefore benefit patients by eliciting
a neuroprotective response, regardless of whether or not they
are eligible for clinical treatment after stroke onset.
Our laboratory and others have been investigating the potential of CAM therapies, particularly (⫺)-epicatechin (EC)
and resveratrol, in protective priming against ischemic stroke
injury. These natural bioactive compounds are enriched in
many food sources, thus representing a safe, noninvasive
therapeutic option to bolster endogenous protection against
vascular injury and stroke. Indeed, studies have documented
improvements in vascular function (13, 52, 56, 60), reduced the
risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke (18, 19, 28, 45), and
heightened cognition following neurodegenerative conditions
(35, 36).
EC and other flavan-3-ols are extensively metabolized in the
small intestine and in the liver in humans and rodents following
oral consumption (4, 37), which has generated questions as to
whether the parent compound or bioactive metabolites are
responsible for its beneficial effects. We and others have
hypothesized an alternative mechanism of protection involving
activation of the nuclear transcription factor erythroid 2p45related factor-2 (Nrf2). This transcriptional activator regulates
cell defense/survival in multiple organ systems throughout the
body (25). In response to injury and oxidative and xenobiotic
stress, Nrf2 regulates the production of cytoprotective proteins
that protect cells from the deleterious microenvironment (31,
64) which persists in various pathological states (39, 40),
including stroke (26, 68). Interestingly, the beneficial effects of
EC and resveratrol in protecting against vascular dysfunction
and cerebral ischemia have been linked to Nrf2 induction (28,
29, 45, 62, 63).
Our laboratory has previously shown that EC effectively
reduced infarct volume and basic neurological deficits when
measured 72 h after transient brain ischemia (45). Additionally,
we have recently documented Nrf2-dependent improvements
in anatomical outcomes and complex sensorimotor function in

young mice after permanent cerebral ischemia (28). However,
no studies have evaluated the prophylactic efficacy of EC in
aging mice subjected to experimental stroke. Because the aging
brain exhibits heightened inflammation and vascular vulnerability, we subjected 12-mo-old mice to permanent cerebral
ischemia to ask the question of whether EC can protect the
aging brain from permanent focal ischemia and, if so, whether
the benefits of EC are associated with glial cell reactivity and
cerebrovascular preservation.

Animal care. All experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Florida, in
accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals and the guidelines laid down by the National Institutes of
Health regarding the care and use of animals for experimental procedures. For all experiments, male wild-type (WT) and Nrf2 knockout
(Nrf2⫺/⫺) C57BL/6 mice were housed in a climate-controlled facility
(23 ⫾ 1°C) on a 12-h:12-h reversed light-dark cycle and were
provided food and water ad libitum. Mice (4 mo old) were used for
anastomosis and hemorrhage evaluations, and 12-mo-old (aging) mice
were used for all outcomes measured.
EC treatment and permanent distal middle cerebral artery
occlusion. WT or Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice were randomized and administered
either methylcellulose vehicle (WT ⫽ 8; Nrf2 ⫽ 9) or 15 mg/kg of
freshly prepared EC (WT ⫽ 7; Nrf2 ⫽ 9) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) by gavage 90 min before permanent distal middle cerebral artery
(MCA) occlusion (pdMCAO), as previously described (28, 45). The
pdMCAO procedure was performed under halothane anesthesia (4%
induction and 2% maintenance, 1.5/3.0% oxygen/air balance). All
possible measures were taken to minimize pain and discomfort, and
mice showed no overt signs of stress. Halothane was used because
isoflurane has been shown to induce Nrf2-responsive protein expression (42), which would potentially confound the interpretation of
results. Complete occlusion was confirmed by severance of the vessel.
Because 15 mg/kg was determined to be the minimum effective dose
in previous studies using young, healthy mice (28), the same dose was
used in the present study for comparative purposes.
Behavioral testing. Because of the relatively mild functional deficits produced by pdMCAO cortical injury, mice were tested for
performance on the adhesive removal test and were subjected to a
DigiGait (Mouse Specifics, Framingham, MA) gait analysis evaluation.
Adhesive removal test. The adhesive removal task requires forelimb
strength, sensation, and complex sensorimotor coordination. Impaired
animals mimic clinical pathology in which stroke patients often report
weakness and/or loss of function in one or more extremities. For
testing, adhesive tape was placed on the planar surface of the forepaw
and latency to remove was recorded. Mice were trained for 3 days,
tested for baseline performance before stroke, and posttested 1 day
after stroke.
DigiGait. For motor sensory testing using the DigiGait testing,
mice were placed on a treadmill, which was set at 20 rpm and
activated. Mice were then recorded while running for 3 to 5 s on the
treadmill. Paw print placement for each trial was recorded by the
DigiGait tracking system. The interfaced software evaluated various
parameters associated with swing and stride. Mice were tested once
before stroke and again at 1 day poststroke. For analysis, each
parameter was first expressed as a ratio of the opposing side (left/
right), and those ratios were expressed relative to baseline gait values.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Lesion volume and total
immunoreactivity were calculated from 16 brain sections collected at
even intervals throughout the expanse of the cortical infarct. At 7 days
poststroke, mice were perfused, brains were fixed and cryosectioned,
and sections were stained with Cresyl violet for lesion volume

quantification. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate reactive gliosis by using anti-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule
1 (Iba1) (1: 1,000; Wako, Richmond, VA) for microglia/macrophages.
This antibody is listed and cited in the Journal of Comparative
Neurology database. Primary antibody was omitted in control experiments to validate antibody selectivity. Blood brain barrier permeability was assessed using mouse IgG secondary antibody (peroxidaselabeled mouse IgG, 1: 300) (30). For gliosis, biotinylated secondary
antibodies were complexed using an elite ABC kit (Vector) and
visualized using diaminobenzidine with nickel enhancement (Vector).
Images were acquired using an Aperio ScanScope XT, and quantifications were performed using ImageScope software (Aperio, Vista,
CA). The ImageScope algorithm “positive pixel count” was used to
quantify pixel numbers corresponding to weak positive, positive, and
strong positive signal based on preset criteria. Because of the abundance of quiescent microglia/macrophages and resting astrocytes,
strong positive pixels were used to identify staining that reflected
activated glial cells. The positive pixel counts were expressed as a
ratio of the total cortical area measured, and ipsilateral calculations
were then expressed relative to the contralateral hemisphere for each
section to control for potential variations in antibody penetrance or
tissue processing.
Anastomosis. To examine potential variations in the cerebral vasculature of WT and Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice, animals were deeply anesthetized
with isoflurane and perfused with PBS followed by 1 ml of black latex
paint. Flow rates of both PBS and latex paint did not exceed 1 ml/min.
Brains were harvested immediately following perfusion and postfixed in 10% paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4°C before imaging of the
dorsal surface. Images were obtained using a desktop endoscope/
microscope (Oasis Scientific, Greenville, SC). For analysis, the distal
branches of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and the MCA were
traced to the point of anastomosis, which was defined as the narrowest
point along the vessel connecting the ACA and MCA (or the midpoint
between the nearest branching points in cases of no connecting point).
All anastomoses points were then connected to form a line (Fig. 1),
and the distance from the midline was determined by measuring the
distance from the midline to the anastomosis line. Measurements were
taken at 1-mm intervals from the frontal pole to the end of the dorsal
surface.
Hemorrhage frequency. For evaluations of rebleeding following
stroke, Cresyl violet-stained sections collected throughout the entire
cortical infarct were evaluated for intraparenchymal blood. Because of
the nature of the occlusion at the cortical surface, traces of surface
blood were discounted from the analysis. Only sections showing
intraparenchymal blood within or lateral to the cortical infarct were
counted, and hemorrhage was recorded as “absent” or “present” for
each animal. Hemorrhage frequency was then expressed as the number of mice showing intraparenchymal blood within each experimental group.
Statistical analyses. All analyses were performed blinded such that
experimenters performing surgery, behavioral testing, anatomical
measures, and data analysis were unaware of the genotypes and
treatments. Power analysis was completed based on previous data
using the same model. Data are expressed as means ⫾ SE, except in
the case of anastomosis, where mean ⫾ SD was used. Statistical
significance was set at P ⬍ 0.05. Bartlett’s tests showed no significant
differences in group variances; therefore, data were evaluated using
parametric statistics. Data from experiments evaluating a single factor
between two groups were analyzed by two-tailed, unpaired Student’s
t-test. For experiments with greater than two groups, significance was
determined using one-way ANOVA. Where main effects occurred,
Bonferroni post hoc analyses were then used to evaluate multiple
group comparisons. For behavioral experiments, the use of a two-bytwo factorial design [treatment (vehicle or EC) and time (pretest or
posttest)] required analysis by two-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post hoc analyses. The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was
used to evaluate hemorrhage frequency. All statistical analyses were

RESULTS

Cerebrovascular architecture is similar in WT and Nrf2⫺/⫺
mice. Anastomosis was evaluated in naïve WT and Nrf2⫺/⫺
mice to determine whether variations in the cerebral arterial
vasculature might account for differences in severity of stroke
injury or treatment efficacy. Mice were perfused with black
latex paint and the cerebral vasculature was analyzed (Fig. 1)
to determine the total number of ACA/MCA intersection
points, as well as the mean distances of anastomoses from the
dorsal midline. The method for identifying intersection points
and line tracing is illustrated in representative macrographs
from WT and Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice (Fig. 1, A and B). Quantification
showed no significant differences in the mean intersection
distance from the midline (Fig. 1C) or the total number of
anastomoses (Fig. 1D) between WT and Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice.
EC improves anatomical and functional outcomes in aging
mice. We previously documented the efficacy of EC in young,
healthy animals such that a single oral dose of 15 mg/kg 90 min
before pdMCAO reduced infarct volume and functional recovery in WT but not in Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice (28). Therefore, the present
study was conducted to determine whether the same prophylactic dose of EC also elicits protection in the aging brains of
12-mo-old mice. Cresyl violet staining revealed expanses of

pyknotic nuclei and cellular degeneration in vehicle-treated
mice (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas the cortical infarction zones of
EC-treated mice showed larger numbers of viable cells and less
tissue degradation (Fig. 2, C and D). Quantification showed
that EC significantly reduced infarct volume in WT mice
relative to vehicle-treated controls (P ⫽ 0.04), consistent with
our previous study in young mice. Of note, EC treatment in
12-mo-old Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice show a trend toward reductions in
infarct volume relative to vehicle-treated Nrf2⫺/⫺ group; however, this effect did not reach a significant level (P ⫽ 0.12).
In addition to infarct volume, mice were evaluated for
performance on the adhesive removal test, which demonstrates
sensitivity in detecting forelimb sensorimotor deficits. The
results from WT mice (Fig. 3A) showed a main effect of time,
with vehicle-treated mice showing significant elevations in
removal time relative to presurgical baseline scores (P ⫽

pre- and poststroke removal time in EC-treated mice. Furthermore, results from Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice (Fig. 3B) showed a main
effect of time, and subsequent analyses showed significant

Gait analysis was also evaluated on these mice to determine
whether milder deficits could be captured, as the DigiGait
system was designed to identify impairments with high sensitivity. Although WT mice showed clear forelimb deficits in
removing adhesive tape, no major gait deficits were detected
upon analyzing various parameters designed to reflect asymmetries associated with stance/stride length, frequency, etc.
(data not shown).
EC does not alter microglia/macrophage activation 7 days
after stroke. Our previous report in young, healthy mice documented reductions in microglia/macrophage activation and
recruitment following EC treatment (28). To determine
whether the protective effects of EC in aging mice are associated with alterations in gliosis, sections were subjected to
immunohistochemical staining for the microglia/macrophage
marker Iba1 (Fig. 4). In sections from vehicle-treated mice,
Iba1-positive cells displayed partially to fully activated morphology and were distributed abundantly throughout the cortical infarction zone. Furthermore, there was no observable
distinction between the quantity or relative activation state

when comparing WT and Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice (Fig. 4, A and B).
Similarly, sections from EC-treated WT and Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice
contained regions of abundant Iba1-positive cells throughout
the cortical infarct, although EC-treated Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice appeared to show less microglia/macrophage recruitment (Fig.
4D) relative to EC-treated WT mice (Fig. 4C). Quantification
(Fig. 4E) revealed no significant differences in Iba1 immunoreactivity across treatment (P ⫽ 0.17). Astrogliosis was also
estimated by quantifying glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity to determine whether an astrocytic response might
be associated with EC protection, and there were no significant
differences across treatments or genotypes (data not shown).
EC does not alter gross vascular permeability or hemorrhage frequency. Because the protective effects of EC were not
associated with alterations in gliosis 7 days after pdMCAO, we

to determine whether hemorrhage frequency differed in response to age, treatment, or genotype (Fig. 6). In the 4-mo-old
WT mice (young mice group), there was only a single case of
intraparenchymal bleeding in the vehicle group, with no events
detected in EC-treated animals. In contrast, hemorrhage was
detected in four cases with 4-mo-old Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice, three of
which belonged to the EC-treated group. A similar pattern was
observed in 12-mo-old mice, with a single case of hemorrhage
in a vehicle-treated WT mouse, and four cases in Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice
that were equally distributed across treatments. Despite a trend
toward increased hemorrhage in Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice, there was no
significant differences between groups (P ⫽ 0.586).
DISCUSSION

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that prophylactic EC
administration would elicit protection from permanent focal
ischemia in aging mice and that the benefits of EC would be
associated with dampened glial cell reactivity and cerebrovascular preservation. Taken together, data here extend the benefits of prophylactic EC consumption to 12-mo-old mice, thus
lending further support for flavan-3-ol use to protect against
cerebrovascular disease and stroke. Similar to our previous
reports (28, 45), a single prophylactic dose 90 min before
pdMCAO effectively reduced infarct volume and reduced
behavioral deficits in WT mice. The timing of EC treatment
was selected based on peak plasma concentrations previously
documented in rodents following oral administration (5, 49),
which mirror the timing of stroke onset in the present study.
The 15 mg/kg dose represents the minimum effective dose in
diminishing microglia/macrophage activation and recruitment,
decreasing infarct volume, and improving functional outcomes
from our previous report using young mice (28). Consistent
with previous data, EC was ineffective in improving histological and behavioral outcomes in aging Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice, indicating that this transcriptional factor may also partially regulate
protection in the aging phenotype.
Although the lack of functional recovery in EC-treated
Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice was pronounced, a trend toward reduced infarct
volume in EC-treated Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice was noted. Based on
power analysis from previous experiments using 2-mo-old
Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice, the animal number used was sufficient to
achieve adequate statistical power. However, the use of 12mo-old mice in this study is an important difference that may
reflect the need to adjust the animal number, which could not
be further extended at this time. Given that these mice did not
display an overt aged phenotype either in terms of behavior or
anatomical measures, it is likely that the variance arose from
deletion of the Nrf2 gene.
Previously, we have shown in young mice that pretreatment
with 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg EC resulted in 54.5 ⫾ 8.3, 40.1 ⫾
14.2⶿, and 50.4 ⫾ 10.1% reductions in infarction volume,
respectively. In the present study, use of 15 mg/kg EC extended its beneficial effect in aging mice and reduced infarct
volume by 41.01 ⫾ 29.57%. Because polyphenolic compounds
have been shown to improve outcomes in models of ischemia
(7, 27, 29, 50, 58, 59), the goal here was to evaluate possible
effects on immune cell activation and cerebrovascular integrity. Interestingly, results did not support the hypothesized
mechanisms. Although our previous study showed that the
protective effects of EC in young mice were accompanied by

sought to determine whether protection might occur through
preservation of cerebrovascular integrity. Immunohistochemistry for mouse IgG was performed on sections from WT and
Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice treated with vehicle or EC (Fig. 5). Consistent
with the microglia/macrophage profile, animals treated with
vehicle (Fig. 5, A and B) showed intense IgG staining throughout the cortical infarction zone that resembled sections from
EC-treated mice (Fig. 5, C and D) within each genotype.
Quantification of the area occupied by IgG showed no significant differences across treatments (P ⫽ 0.27) or genotypes
(P ⫽ 0.92).
Despite the finding that there were no significant differences
in IgG extravasation into the brain parenchyma, an additional
comparison was performed to address whether EC protection
could be explained by reductions in spontaneous bleeding after
stroke. Because weakening of the cerebral vasculature is a
hallmark of the aging process, Cresyl violet-stained sections
from 4- and 12-mo-old WT and Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice were examined

reductions in microglia/macrophage activation and recruitment, there were no significant differences in these outcome
measures in 12-mo-old mice, despite modest qualitative differences. The aging brain is generally considered to display a
heightened glial response to insult (8, 34, 54, 65), which may
account for the inability of EC to dampen microglia and
macrophage activation. However, despite the fact that the
aging process is widely assumed to include weakened vascular
integrity (10, 16, 23, 24), spontaneous hemorrhage was not
significantly altered in any of the experimental groups.
These data beg several questions as to why these outcomes
were not altered by treatment, and a few important points may
account for these observations. First, underlying differences in
vascular permeability and gliosis may not have been captured
because of the 7-day time point examined. Additional studies
with multiple time points, encompassing both early and late
phases of neurodegenerative events, are currently planned. It is
also possible that 12-mo-old mice, while considered to be older
relative to young mice, have not yet developed the “fully” aged
neuropathology that renders them susceptible to heightened
glial responses and vascular dysfunction. Importantly, blood
brain barrier disruption has been documented in aged (24 mo
old) mice (61), supporting the notion that 12-mo-old mice do
not yet display the fully aged phenotype. This would explain
the lack of associated alterations in IgG extravasation with EC
efficacy, and it is an important point to consider when investigating these mechanisms of injury/protection. Therefore, future studies with aged mice (at least 1.5 years) are necessary to
fully investigate this possibility, and indeed, several other
studies have documented vascular abnormalities in aged rodents (14, 17, 38). Finally, the protective effects of EC may not
be contingent on microglia/macrophage responses or blood
brain barrier permeability per se. Instead, these outcome
measures may simply reflect biological processes that occur
in response to other signals within the ischemic microenvironment. Although the nature of such alterations was not

uncovered here, these data fill a gap in the literature regarding the mechanisms of flavan-3-ol protection in mice that
are transitioning between young and fully aged. Because the
neural phenotype changes over time and appears to be
species specific to some extent, repeated investigations
using multiple ages and animal strains are necessary to
validate experimental research (55).
Notably, several key pathways have been identified within
the context of CAM therapies. For example, activation of the
Nrf2 and pathways by polyphenols has been linked to neuroprotection from oxidative damage (6). In vitro, primary neuronal cultures treated with EC upregulated the expression of
the Nrf2-responsive, cytoprotective proteins ferritin light
chain, and biliverdin reductase, in addition to heme oxygenase
1. Although we have previously documented the involvement
of these pathways in regulating the response to focal ischemia
(46, 67), other signaling pathways may mediate the extended
benefits observed here. For example, direct antioxidant effect
of EC treatment on oxidative stress, as reported in several
studies, cannot be ruled out (9, 41, 43), although we do not
think it is likely simply on the basis of stoichiometry. It has
been proposed that NDAPH oxidase activity augments with
aging, thereby it participates in accentuating the oxidative
stress and making aging brain more vulnerable to diseases (22,
66). On the other hand, it has been shown that EC inhibits
NADPH oxidase in endothelial cells and thereby elevates the
level of endothelial nitric oxide and induces vasodilation (53).
Moreover, EC may have similar beneficial effects as reported
for resveratrol and Gingko biloba, natural compounds that have
been extensively studied by our laboratory and others because
of its multiplicity of health benefits and pleiotropic actions (44,
46, 57). These natural compounds have been shown to elicit
neuroprotection, in part, through downregulation of apoptotic
enzymes (2, 20, 44, 48, 51, 57). Additionally, the neuroprotective effects of these natural compounds are also linked with

the reductions in hypoxia-inducible factor-1␣ mRNA expression (11, 15).
With these emerging lines of evidence, future studies investigating the cell-specific, temporal alterations of these pathways may lead to identification of the key player(s) that
mediate protection from delayed degenerative injury following
brain ischemia. For example, it is possible that endothelial cell
death and subsequent disruption of the neurovascular unit at
early time points initiates a series of apoptotic signaling events
that lead to delayed neurodegeneration, possibly through hypoxia-inducible factor 1␣. Such events are known to occur
after cerebral ischemia (3, 12, 33) and would fit with both the
injury profile and the effects of EC observed in the present
study. Notably, resveratrol has been shown to exert beneficial
effects on endothelial cell function, which in turn promotes
vascular function (60, 62, 63). Therefore, detailed studies
investigating these signaling events throughout the neurodegenerative process will be essential in elucidating the mechanism of action that accounts for EC protection in both the
young and aging brain.
Conclusion and potential limitations. Although this study
shows the efficacy of prophylactic EC in attenuating permanent
focal ischemic brain damage in 12-mo-old mice, there are
certain caveats associated with this study. To fully understand
and determine the role of EC in regulating ischemic brain
damage in aged populations (one of the most common and
strong risks factor for stroke), a study on ⬎26-mo old mice is
needed. In our young animal studies, we have shown that the
beneficial effect of EC is regulated partially through Nrf2
pathways; however, in the current study where we used 12mo-old mice, the use of EC in Nrf2⫺/⫺ shows a trend toward
beneficial outcomes in Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice. This suggests that perhaps with aging, the effect of Nrf2 is weakened and the
primary beneficial effect of EC treatment in the aging brain is
mediated through regulating the antioxidant defense system.
Although WT and Nrf2⫺/⫺ mice show similar vascular anastomosis system, the vascular protective effect of Nrf2 affecting
stroke outcomes cannot be ruled out. To fully explore this
avenue, studies with relative and absolute cerebral blood flow
changes and vasomotor activity following EC treatment with or
without stroke should be performed. To fully understand the
role of EC treatment on gliosis on the final outcomes after
stroke, the role of microglia should be tested in a timedependent manner, and costaining of CD68 with Iba-1 could
potentially provide further evidence. Nevertheless, it can be
safely concluded from our previous studies, along with this
current study, that consumption of EC protects the young and
aging brain from ischemic brain damage. The exact mechanism(s) pertaining to the beneficial effect of EC is yet to be
fully understood.
