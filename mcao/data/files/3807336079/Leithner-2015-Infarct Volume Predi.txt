Background and Purpose—Despite standardization of experimental stroke models, final infarct sizes after middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) vary considerably. This introduces uncertainties in the evaluation of drug effects on stroke.
Magnetic resonance imaging may detect variability of surgically induced ischemia before treatment and thus improve
treatment effect evaluation.
Methods—MCAO of 45 and 90 minutes induced brain infarcts in 83 mice. During, and 3 and 6 hours after MCAO, we
performed multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. We evaluated time courses of cerebral blood flow, apparent
diffusion coefficient (ADC), T1, T2, accuracy of infarct prediction strategies, and impact on statistical evaluation of
experimental stroke studies.
Results—ADC decreased during MCAO but recovered completely on reperfusion after 45 and partially after 90-minute
MCAO, followed by a secondary decline. ADC lesion volumes during MCAO or at 6 hours after MCAO largely
determined final infarct volumes for 90 but not for 45 minutes MCAO. The majority of chance findings of final infarct
volume differences in random group allocations of animals were associated with significant differences in early ADC
lesion volumes for 90, but not for 45-minute MCAO.
Conclusions—The prediction accuracy of early magnetic resonance imaging for infarct volumes depends on timing of
magnetic resonance imaging and MCAO duration. Variability of the posterior communicating artery in C57Bl6 mice
contributes to differences in prediction accuracy between short and long MCAO. Early ADC imaging may be used to
reduce errors in the interpretation of post MCAO treatment effects on stroke volumes.   (Stroke. 2015;46:3249-3259.

xperimental studies in models of disease are the underpinning of modern biomedicine. Worryingly, robustness, reproducibility, and thus predictiveness of experimental medicine have
recently been questioned,1–3 a discussion which lead to a widespread concern about rigor in science (eg, Economist October
19, 2013, "How science goes wrong"). Stroke research has been
the epitome of these concerns because it experienced an almost
complete failure to transfer successful treatments in experimental models of stroke to more effective treatment of patients at a
grand scale.4 This apparent lack of predictiveness of biomedical
research has been attributed to many factors, but poor experimental design, statistical quality, and bias feature top of the list.5–7
In most animal stroke studies, the treatment effect is evaluated by statistical comparison of infarct sizes of treatment

versus placebo groups. Group means are compared, and treatment is declared effective depending on a predefined type I
error level (α), most commonly P<0.05. Notably, experimental stroke studies, in contrast to clinical stroke trials, almost
never predefine criteria for the type II error (β). Given α and
β, the acceptance of a treatment effect (ie, the rejection of
the null hypothesis) depends on the effect size, which relates
to a property of the experimental drug, and the variance of
the measured infarct sizes, which relates to biological factors as much as to the properties of the model and its execution. A distinct advantage of experimental stroke models is
that parameters with high variability in the clinical setting,
such as onset, location and duration of vessel occlusion as
well as timing of lesion size determination (eg, by magnetic

resonance imaging [MRI]) can be standardized, potentially
reducing variability of results. Despite these advantages, variability of infarct sizes is substantial, owing to the variability of the surgical procedure8,9 and interanimal variability of
brain blood vessel anatomy10–12 among other factors. Because
of the substantial infarct size variability (SDs usually ≈30%
of the mean) and small group sizes (between 4 and 10) in
experimental stroke research, it is likely that false-positive
results and an overestimation of effect sizes abound in publications.6 At the same time, treatment effects may frequently
remain undetected.
What can we do to cope with the large variability of infarct
sizes besides increasing group sizes and improving our experimental paradigm and skill of experimentalists? One approach
would be to measure the early ischemic lesion volume before
onset of treatment with noninvasive brain imaging and then
compare early ischemic lesion volumes between treatment
and placebo groups or infarct volumes predicted by early
ischemic lesion volumes with those observed. Furthermore,
pretreatment determination of early lesion volumes may allow
unbiased exclusion of outliers, such as animals with failed
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or extreme variations of early ischemia volumes.
Here, we tested whether a pretreatment MRI approach
may be used to gain information on pretreatment ischemic
lesion variability in a common murine stroke model and to
what extent early ischemic lesions predict final infarct sizes.
We characterized the early time courses of commonly used,
widely available MRI parameters for 2 different MCAO durations and 3 early measurement time points. We subsequently
used these data to evaluate the potential of pretreatment MRI
to improve the analysis of experimental stroke treatment
studies.

Materials and Methods
We performed all animal experiments in accordance with international guidelines. The local official committee approved all animal
experiments (Landesamt für Arbeitsschutz, Gesundheitsschutz und
technische Sicherheit, Berlin, Germany). Eighty-three males, 8- to
10-week-old C57Bl/6 (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) or 129S6/
SvEv (BfR, Berlin, Germany) mice were used. All experiments
were performed according to Standard Operating Procedures of the
Department of Experimental Neurology.

MCAO

MRI and Image Processing
Details on acquisition and processing of MRI are provided as onlineonly Data Supplement. Cerebral blood flow (CBF; a flow sensitive
alternating inversion recovery protocol),13,14 apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and T1 and T2 MRI were acquired. Early lesion
volumes were delineated by 2 raters blinded to final infarcts. Rater
independent evaluation of early lesion volumes was performed for
validation of rater-dependent results. Final infarcts were delineated
on T2-weighted (T2w) images obtained 48 hours after MCAO.

Infarct Probability Analysis and Contribution of
Posterior Slices
From T2w images at 48 hours, coregistered to a standard brain, we calculated maps, which show the percentage of animals exhibiting infarction
for each voxel (Figure 2). In the following, we refer to these as spatial
infarct frequency maps.15 As mice of the 45-minute MCAO group with
MR during MCAO were SV129 and all other C57Bl/6, we restricted
this analysis to the 4 groups with MRI 3 or 6 hours after MCAO.
To evaluate the contribution of infarcts in posterior slices to variability of infarct sizes, we determined the contribution of infarct volumes
of individual brain slices to the total infarct volume (infarct volume in
single slices divided by total infarct volume, Figure 2, C1). The same
analysis was performed for the contribution to the SD (Figure 2, C2).
The number of animals needed to detect a difference in infarct volumes
of 30% was calculated separately for all slices using mean and SD of
infarct volumes of the respective slice (with α set to 0.05 and the power
to 0.8, Figure 2, C3). To evaluate whether ADC measurement during
MCAO could detect involvement of posterior slices, we analyzed the
correlation of early ADC lesion volumes with final infarcts for slices ≈3
to 5 mm from the rhinal fissure (Figure 2, C5, core MCA territory), versus ≈6 to 8 mm from the rhinal fissure (MCA/posterior cerebral artery
[PCA] watershed and PCA territory, Figure 2, C6).

Coefficient of Determination of Infarct Sizes by
Early MRI Lesion Sizes
We calculated the coefficients of determination (r2) of visually delineated lesion sizes for early MRI with T2w imaging at 48 hours for all
groups. To assess reliability of this procedure, 2 raters, blinded to the
results of each other, evaluated lesion sizes and coefficients of determination were compared. Animals with no infarct on T2w imaging at
48 hours were excluded.

Infarct Volume Prediction
We determined receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curves and
calculated area under the curve (AUC) for the following prediction
models: (1) early ADC lesion, (2) spatial infarct frequency, and (3) a
combination of both. ROC curves were generated from infarct probability maps by calculating sensitivity and specificity of infarct prediction on a voxel-wise basis for each probability threshold. A detailed
description of the calculation of infarct probability maps is provided

Mice were placed on a heating pad and anesthetized with isoflurane
in a mixture of oxygen and dinitrogen monoxide (N2O). A coated
5.0-nylon monofilament was introduced into the left external carotid
artery (ECA) and carefully advanced to the origin of the left MCA
via the internal carotid artery. The common carotid artery as well as
the ECA were ligated and remained occluded during reperfusion. A
single, experienced surgeon performed MCAO.

Experimental Groups
To evaluate the effect of MCAO duration and timing of MRI on infarct prediction accuracy, we performed experiments on 6 experimental groups (Figure 1). MCAO durations of 45 and 90 minutes were
chosen to induce moderate and large infarct sizes, respectively. MRI
was performed during MCAO or at 3 or 6 hours after MCAO onset.
Group sizes were 10 to 20 animals (Table I in the online-only Data
Supplement).

Figure 1. Experimental paradigm. Experiments were performed
on 6 groups. Groups 1 to 3 were subjected to 90 minutes
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and groups 4 to 6 to
45 minutes MCAO. Early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was
performed either during MCAO (groups 1 and 4), 3 hours after
MCAO (groups 2 and 5), or 6 hours after MCAO (groups 3 and
6). T2-weighted MRI was performed at 48 hours after MCAO for
lesion size determination in all groups.

variability of lesions in anterior slices in the core middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. B, The vascular supply of the mouse brain. The
posterior cerebral artery (PCA) arises from the internal carotid artery (ICA). Therefore, blood supply to the PCA territory depends largely on
the posterior communicating artery (PComA) during MCA occlusion (MCAO). The posterior slices that contain the PCA territory contribute
less to the mean infarct volume (C1), but largely to the SD (C2). This results in a high number needed to detect a 30% treatment effect
(at α =0.05 and power=0.8), if isolated slices would be analyzed (C3). Analyzing total infarct volumes (all slices together) yielded required
sample sizes of ≈30 to 40 (15–20 animals per group). The difference of infarct volumes between 45 and 90 minutes MCAO is large in
posterior slices (C4). Correlation for early apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) with late T2 lesion is high for 90-minute MCAO in posterior
slices (C6) compared with anterior slices (C5) indicating that early magnetic resonance imaging can predict involvement of posterior slices
in the final infarct for 90 minutes, but not for 45-minute MCAO. ACA indicates anterior cerebral artery; BA, basilar artery; CCA, common

in the online-only Data Supplement. We did not apply the mismatch
concept (prediction of lesion growth by mismatch between early
ADC and CBF lesions) because early ADC lesions did not represent
infarct core, our CBF method could not distinguish between benign
oligemia and critical hypoperfusion on an individual animal basis and
4 of our 6 groups had MRI after reperfusion.

Analysis of the Impact on Treatment Effect
Evaluation
To illustrate possible effects of the variance in early ADC lesions on experimental stroke studies, we created an artificial 2 group design from
our data by using permutations resulting in data sets with all possible
assignments of animals of 1 of our experimental groups to 2 groups (eg,
for division of 11 animals of experimental group 1 in 2 groups of 5 and
6 animals, respectively, there are 462 different possible allocations):
The T2w lesions at 48 hours of these 2 groups were then compared
using a t test. If a significant difference was detected (P<0.05), this
was considered a type I error, as all animals had been treated equally
and the detected difference was, therefore, a chance finding. In case of
a significant difference, we subsequently compared early ADC lesion
volumes using a t test. If P<0.05 in this comparison, we considered that
early MRI had identified a difference in early ADC lesion volumes as

a confounder leading to a type I error. We used this simple approach to
illustrate more intuitively the effect of early ADC lesion differences on
chance findings of infarct sizes differences for different MCAO durations and MR measurement time points. For comparison of 2 small
samples, Janusonis et al16 have suggested ANCOVA to correct for pretreatment baseline variability. We therefore added ANCOVA as an additional test to evaluate the impact of early ADC lesion volume.

Results
Lesion Sizes and Variability of Lesion Sizes
Of 83 animals, 3 (3.6%) died before imaging at 48 hours and
1 had artifacts on T2w imaging precluding reliable lesion volume determination at 48 hours. These 4 animals were excluded
from further analysis. Of the remaining 79 animals, 8 (10%)
had no T2w lesion at 48 hours, indicating failed MCAO.
Excluding animals with failed MCAO reduced the coefficient
of variation from 56% to 44% for 45-minute MCAO and from
51% to 36% for 90-minute MCAO. Final lesion sizes along
with SD and coefficient of variation are shown in Table I in
the online-only Data Supplement.

Of the 8 animals with no lesion, 4 had ADC imaging during MCAO and none of the 4 had an early ADC lesion. In contrast, all 24 animals with MRI during MCAO and infarcts at
48 hours exhibited an early ADC lesion, indicating that early
ADC can be used to exclude animals with failed MCAO. As
evidenced by the reduction of coefficients of variation, exclusion of animals with failed MCAO improves statistical assessment of treatment studies.
Figure 2 shows infarct probability maps for 45-minute
MCAO, 90-minute MCAO, and the difference in infarct
probability for these MCAO durations. The anterior slices
covering the core MCA territory showed similar infarct areas
with little variability. This is reflected in a high contribution of these slices to infarct volume and low contribution
to SD (Figure 2, C1 and C2). In contrast, posterior slices
contributed less to mean infarct volume, but substantially
to SD of infarct volumes. Hence, analyzing single slices,
the number needed to detect a significant difference in an
experimental stroke study is low in anterior slices but much
higher in posterior slices (Figure 2, C3). The difference in
mean infarct volumes between 45- and 90-minute MCAO
was low in anterior slices—7% ≈3 to 4 mm from the rhinal
fissure—but increased to 81%, ≈9 mm from the rhinal fissure. The initial ADC lesion during MCAO correlated well
with the ischemic T2w lesion at 48 hours in posterior slices
for 90-minute MCAO, but not for 45-minute MCAO because
most mice did not develop infarctions in the posterior slices

despite substantial initial ADC lesions in the 45-minute
MCAO group.

Early MRI Characteristics
In-group average MRI (coregistered to an average brain
template) of early ADC, CBF, T1map, and T2w along with
T2w images at 48 hours are shown in Figure I in the onlineonly Data Supplement. As visible on these images, ADC and
CBF deliver discernable lesions in the early phase, whereas
T2-weighted imaging shows pronounced hyperintense lesion
areas at 48 hours after MCAO. The ADC lesion largely disappears at 3 hours after 45 minutes of MCAO. For 90-minute MCAO, a part of the ADC lesion recovers although ADC
further decreases in the core MCA territory. The ADC lesion
reappears at 6 hours after 45-minute MCAO.
Figure 3 illustrates changes in lesion volume and absolute
values of ADC and CBF in the early phase during or shortly
after MCAO. ADC dropped to values below those of the nonischemic hemisphere within minutes after MCAO. Again,
ADC lesion shrinkage at 3 hours and regrowth at 6 hours is
visible. During reperfusion, at 3 hours after onset of MCAO,
ADC had recovered completely (45-minute MCAO) or partly
(90-minute MCAO, Figure 3; Figure II in the online-only Data
Supplement).
The complete recovery of ADC lesions at 3 hours after
45-minute MCAO is reflected not only in visually determined
lesion volumes and absolute ADC values of the ischemic

Figure 3. Time courses of lesion volumes, absolute apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and cerebral blood flow (CBF). ADC exhibited
large ischemic lesion volumes during middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with partial (90-minute MCAO) or complete recovery
(45-minute MCAO, top). This is reflected in recovery of absolute ADC values for the ischemic hemisphere and in the area that later proceeded to infarction (middle). CBF was largely reduced during MCAO in the ischemic hemisphere, but recovered to ≈60% of the contralateral hemisphere after reperfusion. Of note, recovery of CBF did not significantly differ between the entire hemisphere and the area that
later proceeded to infarction (bottom). T2w indicates T2 weighted.

hemisphere but also in the absolute ADC values in the region
that later developed a T2w lesion (Figure 3, middle row)
and in ADC histograms (Figure II in the online-only Data
Supplement). At 6 hours after MCAO, ADC declined again
in both groups (Figure 3; Figure II in the online-only Data
Supplement). CBF was largely reduced during MCAO in the
ischemic hemisphere and recovered only partly on reperfusion at 3 and 6 hours after onset of MCAO. The perfusion
deficit persisting after removal of the thread that occludes the
MCA is explained by the permanent occlusion of the common
and ECA. Reperfusion occurs via collaterals, for example, the
posterior and anterior communicating arteries. At 6 hours after
MCAO, average hemispheric CBF reached ≈60% of the nonischemic hemisphere regardless of occlusion time. CBF within
the later ischemic T2w lesion did not differ relevantly from
CBF of areas, which did not proceed to infarction (Figure 3).
This provides evidence that reperfusion in the MCA territory
was complete to the degree possible when ECA and common
carotid artery remain occluded. Furthermore, we found no
relevant correlation of average hemispheric CBF with ADC
values at 3 or 6 hours after MCAO. We have no clear explanation for the overall reduced CBF in group 2 compared with
the other groups, but repetitive anesthesia with short recovery
period may have contributed to this finding.

Correlation of Early MRI With Final Infarcts
To evaluate which parameter could best be used in the early
evaluation of ischemia, visually determined lesion volumes of
early ADC, CBF, T1map, and T2w imaging were compared
with T2w lesion volumes determined 48 hours after MCAO.
Lesion delineation was performed blinded to final infarcts.
Correlation of early lesion sizes with T2w lesion sizes at 48
hours was consistently high for MR during (r2=0.87 and 0.79
for 2 raters, respectively) or at 6 hours (r2=0.85 and 0.78) after
90-minute MCAO (Figure 4). There was a weak-to-moderate
correlation of early ADC lesions with late T2w lesions for
45-minute MCAO and measurement at 6 hours after MCAO
(r2=0.35 and 0.54). Of note, when excluding animals with no
T2w lesion at 48 hours, there was no significant correlation
of ADC lesions during MCAO with T2w lesions at 48 hours
for 45-minute MCAO. The other parameters did not correlate
well with late T2w lesions for all time points. For CBF, the
reason is most likely the fact that persisting occlusion of common carotid artery and ECA caused a persisting CBF reduction covering the entire hemisphere. T1map and T2w imaging
did not show robust lesions in the early phase in our study.

Infarct Prediction by Early MRI
We evaluated 3 different models predicting infarction (T2w
lesion at 48 hours) 3-dimensionally (3D) on a voxel-wise
basis. ROC curves were determined for prediction via early
ADC, spatial infarct frequency, and a combination of early
ADC and spatial infarct frequency. Figure 5A shows the
AUCs for different occlusion times, MRI measurement time
points, and prediction models. AUCs were high (consistently
>0.90) for prediction by spatial infarct frequency or a combination of spatial infarct frequency and ADC. Prediction
by early ADC alone was good for MRI during MCAO and

at 6 hours after MCAO, with AUC values ≈0.8. In a further step, we calculated the root mean square deviation of
predicted infarct volumes from measured infarct volumes
for optimal infarction probability thresholds as determined
from ROC curves. The results were compared with the root
mean square deviation derived from linear regression analysis of visually obtained ADC lesion volumes (Figure 5B).
The best prediction was obtained for visually determined
ADC lesions for 90-minute MCAO when MRI was obtained
during MCAO or at 6 hours after MCAO. At first glance,
there is a discrepancy between highest AUC (Figure 5A) for
prediction via spatial infarct frequency maps and the smallest root mean square deviation obtained from linear regression analysis of visually determined ADC lesions. However,
this is explained by the fact that voxels with equal ADC
may or may not proceed to infarction, which reduces AUC
for a voxel-wise prediction model. However, if the number
of voxels that proceed to infarction despite normal ADC (or
number of voxels which recover despite reduced ADC) is
proportional to the final infarct, prediction by linear regression can still perform well. Furthermore, it has to be kept in
mind that AUC depends equally on sensitivity and specificity. In a model that produces small infarcts, ROC analysis
may suggest a good prediction if infarcts sizes are generally
overestimated, as sensitivity will be high, but specificity
not much reduced because of a high number of voxels correctly identified not to proceed to infarction (true negatives).
Then, the root mean square deviation of predicted infarcts
may nevertheless be relatively high with respect to average
infarct volume.

(T2-weighted [T2w] lesion at 48 h) by early magnetic resonance
imaging for visual lesion delineation by 2 independent raters
(left and right), blinded to the groups, final infarct sizes, and
the results of each other while delineating the lesions. A high
coefficient of determination for final infarct size was observed
consistently among raters for apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)
lesions evaluated during or at 6 hours after 90 minutes middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). For 45 minutes MCAO, the
coefficients of determination were weak to moderate. When
measured 3 hours after MCAO, early ADC lesions did not correlate well with final infarct size. White fields indicate no delineable
lesion in that particular measurement sequence. CBF indicates
cerebral blood flow.

Impact on the Evaluation of Treatment Effects in
Experimental Stroke Studies
By simulation we assessed, whether early MRI may identify
differences in early ischemic lesion volumes as a confounder
for differences in final infarct sizes. To this end, all theoretically possible ways of partitioning 1 experimental group (ie,
from 1 population) into 2 groups (samples) were tested for a
chance finding of a significant difference of T2w lesion sizes
at 48 hours (ie, falsely concluding that the 2 samples come
from different populations). The results are shown in Table.
For example, group 1 (MCAO 90 minutes and MRI during
MCAO) contained 11 animals and thus 462 different divisions
in 2 groups of 5 and 6 animals, respectively, were possible. A
t test revealed a significant difference (P<0.05) of T2w lesions
sizes in 23 (5.0%) of these 462 possible divisions. As the animals came from the same population, these represent chance
findings of a treatment effect.
In case of significant chance findings, we evaluated further
the impact of early ADC to the finding by (1) a t test comparing early ADC lesion volumes and (2) ANCOVA with early
ADC lesion volumes as covariate.16
In 15 of these 23 cases, early ADC lesions were significantly different, thus indicating that the detected difference
at 48 hours was because of a difference of the early ischemic
lesion. ANCOVA failed to confirm allocation treatment effect
in the majority and indicated a significant effect of early ADC

on final infarct volume in all 23 cases. Using these strategies,
significant confounding by early ADC was present and after
adjustment for confounding, significant group differences disappeared in the majority of cases for groups 1 and 3, but not
for the other groups (Table).

Discussion
The main findings of our study are: (1) ADC decreases within
minutes during transient MCAO in mice, but shows a triphasic
time course with full or partial recovery after reperfusion and
secondary decline within a few hours, depending on duration
of MCAO. The secondary decline in ADC is not paralleled by
a secondary decline in CBF. (2) In C57/bl6 mice, the posterior
slices covering MCA/PCA watershed and PCA territory have
a major contribution to infarct size variability and infarct size
differences between 45- and 90-minute MCAO. (3) Accuracy
of infarct size prediction using ADC depends strongly on timing of MRI and duration of MCAO. Early ADC lesion volumes during MCAO and at 6 hours after MCAO accurately
predict infarct volumes for 90 minutes MCAO. (4) Chance
findings of infarct volume differences can be explained by differences in early ADC lesion volume for 90-minute MCAO,
but not for 45-minute MCAO. Hence, depending on MCAO
duration and timing of MRI, one potential confounder leading
to type I errors in treatment effect evaluation may be identified
using early ADC imaging.

As expected, this yielded significant effects (by chance) in ≈5% of possible allocations (simulating a type-I error, the absolute number is shown in row 6). In case of
a chance finding of a significant difference, further tests were performed: for the majority of cases, early ADC lesion volumes differed significantly (t test) in groups 1
and 3, but not in the other groups (row 7). ANCOVA failed to confirm an effect of group (ie, the putative treatment effect) in the majority of cases in groups 1 and 3, but
confirmed it in the other groups. ANCOVA confirmed an effect of ADC in the vast majority of cases for groups 1 and 3. ADC indicates apparent diffusion coefficient; MCAO,
middle cerebral artery occlusion; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; and T2w, T2 weighted.
*In group 5, 13 of 18 animals were randomly selected for analysis.

Characteristics of Early MRI in Mouse Stroke
The observed triphasic ADC time course with an initial rapid
decline, followed by recovery after reperfusion and secondary decline within hours confirms earlier reports in rats.17–21
Full recovery of ADC at 3 hours after MCAO onset has been
reported for MCAO duration of 8 to 30 minutes in rats and
mice.22–24 Of note, this does not reflect complete tissue recovery, as MR spectroscopy may still detect significant changes
in neurochemical profiles.22,25 The initial as well as the secondary decline of ADC has been shown to be associated with ATP
depletion but not secondary deterioration of perfusion in rats.26
Our CBF data at 6 hours after reperfusion (Figure 3; Figure II
in the online-only Data Supplement) confirm this notion for
mice. Reperfusion was not relevantly different in areas proceeding to infarction when compared with those that did not.
This indicates complete reperfusion to the degree possible
with persisting common and external carotid artery occlusion
(with CBF at ≈60% of the contralateral hemisphere). We cannot rule out the possibility, however, that the persisting hypoperfusion, although safely above levels of immediate ischemic
threat, may have contributed to secondary ischemic damage.
ADC recovery was largely complete 3 hours after MCAO
onset for 45-minute MCAO (Figure 3; Figure II in the onlineonly Data Supplement). This may indicate almost exclusive secondary ischemic damage (with temporary restoration of energy
metabolism and reversal of cytotoxic edema after reperfusion)
for this occlusion duration. A similar ADC time course (with
temporary ADC recovery) has been demonstrated in patients
with stroke undergoing successful intra-arterial thrombolysis.27
Interestingly, ADC reversal28,29 as well as ADC lesion growth30
have both been well described in human stroke studies using
MRI, but reports on secondary ischemic injury after early ADC
reversal are rare. This may be because of imaging protocols of
stroke studies, which do not include repetitive MRI in the first
hours after reperfusion. Hence, temporary ADC reversal may
simply occur undetected. However, it could also indicate that
secondary ischemic damage after initial temporary restoration

of energy metabolism is less frequently encountered as pathophysiological sequence in patients with stroke when compared
with experimental stroke studies.
The reversal of ADC on reperfusion has implications for
infarct prediction: although ADC lesion volumes determined
during 90-minute MCAO accurately predicted T2w ischemic
lesions at 48 hours, ADC reversal largely prohibited infarct
prediction by ADC when lesions were determined at 3 hours
after MCAO onset. Secondary ADC decline again permitted
accurate prediction when ADC lesions were determined 6
hours after 90-minute MCAO (Figure 4). The time course of
ADC after reperfusion has to be taken into account when planning an experimental stroke study that includes infarct prediction via early ADC measurement. Our data on 45-minute
MCAO indicate that accurate prediction of infarct sizes may
not be possible for short occlusion times. One tempting interpretation is that for short occlusion times, variability of pathophysiological events leading to secondary ischemic damage
but not initial ischemic lesion volumes determine final infarct
volume variability.

Involvement of Posterior Slices/PCA Territory
In contrast to most humans, the PCA is supplied via the internal carotid artery in mice. As ECA, common carotid artery,
and MCA are occluded in the most commonly used MCAO
models, tissue fate in the PCA territory depends on collateral
supply from the posterior communicating artery (Figure 2)
and details of the MCAO model used.31 The high variability
of the posterior communicating artery calibre and patency in
C57Bl/6 mice32 explains our observation of high variability of
infarct volumes in posterior slices (Figure 2). This observation
is also in line with studies demonstrating large SDs compared
with mean infarct volumes in posterior slices in mice.11,33,34
Evaluating only anterior slices in experimental stroke studies may, therefore, improve treatment effect detection, if the
evaluated treatment effect equally reduces infarct volumes in
anterior when compared with posterior slices. However, in our

3256  Stroke  November 2015
study the difference in anterior slice infarct volumes between
45- and 90-minute MCAO was low compared with posterior
slices. This may indicate that the time course of ischemic
damage is different for the PCA/MCA watershed and PCA
territory in our MCAO model. A potential explanation is that
collateral flow via the posterior communicating artery may be
sufficient to prevent permanent ischemic damage commonly
in 45-minute MCAO but variably in 90-minute MCAO, in line
with results reported by McColl et al.35 It could be that not
only variability of infarct volumes in control groups but also
neuroprotective treatment effects are larger in the posterior
slices in the MCAO model. Our data therefore indicate that
posterior slices should routinely be evaluated in experimental
stroke treatment studies in mice.

Infarct Prediction Strategies
Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

We compared 2 different infarct prediction strategies: voxelwise prediction using ROC analysis and prediction by linear
regression analysis of lesion volumes. AUC values from ROC
analysis in our study were largely in line with previous reports
for prediction by early ADC or a combination of early ADC
with spatial infarct frequency data in rats.15,36–38 Interestingly,
prediction by spatial infarct frequency alone yielded AUCs
consistently higher than those determined from early ADC.
One shortcoming of our study, which may contribute to this
finding, is the fact that we measured T2w lesions 48 hours after
MCAO, when significant edema was noted for large infarcts
(42±12 μL, ≈20% of the average volume of a hemisphere,
for 90-minute MCAO). Infarct prediction by spatial infarct
frequency alone as judged by AUC was also superior for
45-minute ischemia, where the average volume of edema was
lower (21±12 μL). A factor that might have decreased prediction accuracy by early MRI is inaccuracy of coregistration of
early MRIs with T2w images at 48 hours. Of note, an almost
perfect correlation has been demonstrated between infarcts
determined by T2w MRI at 48 hours and triphenyltetrasodiumchloride histology (r=0.94)39 and T2w images between 48
and 168 hours after MCAO and hematoxylin/eosin histology
(r=0.98).40 We found an almost perfect correlation of edema
with infarct volume, indicating that edema did not relevantly
reduce infarct size prediction by linear regression.
To our knowledge, previous reports have not published
AUCs derived form spatial infarct frequency prediction alone
(a strategy that does not use early MRI). Our data indicate that
prediction via early MRI does not necessarily outperform prediction by spatial infarct frequency, which can be generated
from late MR or histology without the need for early MRI.
However, as equal infarct volumes are then predicted for all
animals, there is no correlation of predicted with measured
infarct volumes for this approach.
We found that linear regression of visually determined
ADC lesions achieved the smallest root mean squared deviations of predicted from measured infarct volumes for 90-minute MCAO when MRI was performed during MCAO or at
6 hours after MCAO (Figure 5B). This finding was consistent between 2 independent raters blinded to final lesions and
experimental group. This indicates that depending on MCAO
duration, MRI time point and prediction model, regression

analysis of early with late lesion sizes may be superior to
voxel-wise prediction by ROC analysis. One possible explanation is that the volume with initially normal ADC that proceeds to infarction as well as the volume of initially decreased
ADC that does not proceed to infarction is correlated to final
lesion volume. Although ROC would classify these volumes
as false-negative or false-positive, thereby decreasing sensitivity, specificity, and AUC, the prediction accuracy by regression analysis may not be relevantly reduced.

Type-I Errors and Early MRI
Our study suggests that depending on MCAO duration and
timing of MRI, early ADC lesion volume determination
could contribute to avoiding type I errors. We evaluated this
by randomly allocating animals of 1 experimental group to 2
groups and testing for a chance finding of a significant infarct
volume difference. We found such differences for 5% of possible allocations, as expected at a significance level of 0.05
(Table). For 90-minute MCAO and MRI during MCAO or at
6 hours after MCAO, in about two thirds of such chance findings of final infarct volume differences, early ADC volumes
also exhibited significant differences. ANCOVA confirmed an
effect of group in only a small minority of these cases and
indicated an effect of early ADC lesion volumes in nearly all
(Table). Thus, in a treatment study with no effect of the treatment, early MRI would have indicated that chance differences
in early ischemic lesion volume had confounded final infarct
volume differences in 90-minute MCAO groups with MRI
performed during or at 6 hours after MCAO.
In contrast, for 45-minute MCAO, chance findings of final
infarct volume differences could not be uncovered by early
ADC imaging reliably (Table). One possible explanation may
be derived from our 3D analysis of infarct volumes. ADC
lesions variably detected in posterior slices during 45-minute MCAO frequently did not exhibit infarctions at 48 hours
(Figure 2, C6), in contrast to animals with 90-minute MCAO.
Correlation of infarct sizes with early ADC lesions in 45-minute MCAO was also weak in the anterior slices. Thus, variability of transformation of an early ADC lesion into final infarct
beyond 6 hours after transient ischemia may play a larger role
for 45-minute MCAO than for 90-minute MCAO and this cannot be detected by early ADC imaging.

Implications for Experimental Stroke Studies
Our results do not argue for routine early MRI in experimental stroke studies. However, our data indicate that early imbalances in ischemic lesion volumes are a major source of type I
errors for long duration MCAO. Thus, detecting differences in
early ischemic lesion volumes may help to reduce these errors
and could be used as one tool among others to improve quality
of experimental stroke studies. Although imbalances in early
ischemic lesion volumes can also contribute to type I errors for
short MCAO, our data indicate that other factors may play a
larger role. Thus, early MRI is less promising for experimental
stroke studies with short occlusion times. When MCAO duration is short enough to leave some animals with no infarction
despite successful occlusion of the MCA, early MRI may still
be used to confirm successful MCAO. However, confirming

Leithner et al   Stroke Volume Prediction by Early MRI    3257
successful MCAO may also be done more easily using LaserDoppler-Flowmetry. Our data show that reduction of variability
by exclusion of animals with failed MCAO can be substantial.
In any case, if MRI is performed for other reasons before
treatment, ADC imaging may be added and timing may be
adapted to enable evaluation of early ADC lesion volumes.
When performed during MCAO, the confounding factor of
anesthesia necessary for MRI can be minimized by rapid
transfer to the MR scanner after MCAO and a short imaging
protocol. Finally, early MRI may deliver important information in experimental stroke studies with relevant mortality.
In these studies, early ADC can clarify whether deaths were
related to infarct size and thus help to improve interpretation
of a potential treatment effect in surviving animals.

Weaknesses of Our Study
Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

We started performing the experiments in SV129 mice (group
4), but had to switch to C57Bl/6 mice for logistical reasons.
Hence, the results of this group have to be compared with
the other groups with care. It has been shown that infarct
volumes and cerebrovascular anatomy vary with genetic
background11,12 and larger infarcts have been observed in the
C57Bl/6 compared with the SV129 strain.41 However, a study
by Pham et al found no differences of infarct sizes, ADC, or
CBF at any time point between SV129 and C57Bl/6 mice after
transient MCAO.42
MRI was performed using isoflurane anesthesia for noninvasiveness and easier handling of animals. Isoflurane can
increase CBF13 and reduce infarct sizes. It cannot be excluded
that a substantial CBF increase alters the ADC time course
and that altered ADC time courses or infarct volumes influence the accuracy of infarct prediction using early ADC measurements. This may increase or decrease prediction accuracy.
When applying our protocol to experimental studies, it should
therefore be kept in mind that anesthesia may influence the
correlation between early ADC lesions and final infarcts.
We measured T2w lesion sizes 48 hours after MCAO
onset. Although determination of the infarct volume at this
time point enabled low mortality (only 3 mice died before 48
hours after MCAO), significant edema was noted. This may
have contributed to inaccuracy of voxel-by-voxel infarct prediction by early ADC. Infarct determination at a later time
point, or a more sophisticated coregistration procedure could
have reduced this error. Correction of lesion sizes for edema
did not significantly alter infarct size prediction by linear
regression analysis, as edema volume was highly correlated
with infarct volume (r2=0.93).
We used simple prediction models that are easy to implement but may be less accurate when compared with more
sophisticated models. Using complex mathematical analyses (artificial neural networks and support vector machines),
Huang et al15 demonstrated increased prediction accuracy in
rats when combining CBF, ADC, and spatial infarct frequency
information. In line with our study, prediction was more
accurate for ADC than for CBF and accuracy increased with
MCAO duration.38 Desai et al43 showed that prediction could
be improved by measuring ADC changes at multiple time
points. Wu et al37 and Bouts et al44 found high prediction accuracy in rats using a general linear model combining perfusion

and diffusion information. Christensen et al45 have demonstrated increased prediction accuracy of perfusion imaging by
more sophisticated CBF parameter analysis.
Our goal was not to achieve the highest AUC for a voxel-byvoxel infarct prediction model. Rather, we aimed at most accurately predicting overall infarct sizes (with accuracy defined as
lowest difference between predicted and measured infarct sizes).
Our data show that highest AUC does not necessarily translate
in minimal mean difference between predicted and measured
infarct sizes. In contrast, although infarct prediction by spatial
infarct frequency yielded high AUCs comparable with those of
sophisticated prediction models for rats,15,37,38 the mean difference
between predicted and measured infarct sizes was smaller when
prediction was simply derived from linear regression for visually
determined early ADC lesions. These arguments notwithstanding
improvements in MRI measurement and prediction algorithms
can further strengthen the potential for early MRI to improve the
statistical evaluation of experimental stroke studies.

Summary
Despite standardized procedures in animal experiments,
infarct sizes show considerable variability in the intraluminal
thread model in mice. This variability is larger in the posterior parts of the brain in C57Bl/6 mice, most likely because
of variability of the posterior communicating artery territories. Early MRI may be used to partly control this variability.
ADC is the most promising parameter. The accuracy of early
ADC lesions to predict final infarcts depends on the timing of
MRI and duration of MCAO. Our data suggest that accuracy is
highest for MRI during or at 6 hours after 90-minute MCAO.
Transient ADC recovery precludes accurate infarct prediction
by ADC for a few hours after reperfusion, and infarct prediction is less accurate for shorter occlusion times.
Prediction of final infarct volumes using early ADC measurement may be used to improve power of experimental
designs, specifically by detecting imbalances in early ischemic lesion volumes, by excluding animals with failed MCAO
from further analysis and by improving the evaluation of treatment studies with relevant mortality.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging
We performed MRI using a 7 Tesla rodent scanner (Pharmascan 70 ⁄ 16, Bruker BioSpin,
Ettlingen, Germany). For early MR imaging a 1H-Phased-Array mouse head surface coil
(Rapid Biomed, Rimpar, Germany) and a linear 72-mm volume resonator were used. For late
imaging a linear 20mm-1H-RF-quadratur-volume resonator was used. We used Paravision 4.0
for data acquisition and primary image processing. Mice were placed on a heated water
blanket to ensure constant body temperature of 37 °C. Anaesthesia was induced with 3 %
isoflurane and maintained with 1.2-1.5 % delivered in O2 / N2O mixture (30/70 %) via a
facemask under ventilation monitoring. For T2 weighted (T2w) and ADC imaging, 10 slices
with a slice thickness of 1mm and a field of view of 2 x 2 cm were positioned over the mouse
brain. For CBF imaging, three slices with a slice thickness of 2 mm were measured covering
the six middle slices of the T2w and ADC measurement. Imaging parameters for diffusion
weighted imaging were: TR/TE = 3000 / 40.9 ms, 3 diffusion directions, diffusion duration
(δ) = 5 ms, diffusion separation (Δ) = 25 ms, b-values 0 and 1300 s/mm2, matrix 128x128. For
T2 imaging at 48 hours, a T2 weighted turbo-spin echo sequence with fat suppression and the
following parameters was used: TR/TE = 4200/36 ms, rare factor 8, 4 averages, matrix
256x256. CBF imaging was performed as described previously1 with the modification that a
mouse head surface coil and a 128x128 image matrix were used. For quantification, a brainblood partition coefficient of 0.89ml/g was used2. In a relevant minority of animals (~ 20%)
imaging artifacts precluded reliable quantification of CBF; these animals were excluded from
further analysis of CBF data, but included in analysis of the other MRI parameters.
	  
Image processing
All image data were processed using custom written Matlab scripts. Brain surface was
manually or semi-automatically delineated in all slices. Early MR images of each mouse were
then co-registered to T2w images at 48 hours using bicubic interpolation to a 256x256 matrix
for ADC and CBF/T1map images. For co-registration of CBF images (slice thickness 2 mm)
to T2w images (slice thickness 1 mm), CBF values of one CBF image were co-registered to
the two corresponding T2w images. An average brain surface template was calculated from
all mice and all individual images co-registered to this average template for spatial infarct
frequency analysis (see below) and calculation of average MR images.
Edema correction
In animals with large ischemic lesions, T2w images at 48 hours showed relevant edema. We
therefore determined the volume of ischemic and non-ischemic hemispheres for all animals
and corrected T2w lesion sizes at 48 hours for edema following the equation provided by
Gerriets and coworkers3: LVc = HVc + HVi – (HVc + HVi – Lvu)*((HVc + HVi)/2*HVc)).
LVc - lesion volume, corrected for edema, HVc – hemispheric volume contralateral to the
infarct, HVi – hemispheric volume ipsilateral to the infarct, LVu – lesion volume uncorrected
for edema).

Lesion volume determination
Visual lesion determination or visual artifact exclusion after automated lesion selection is still
widely used in human studies. We determined lesion volumes by manual delineation for all
modalities (CBF, ADC, T2w, T1map), aided by a script that suggested lesion contours based
on voxels with equal values. We performed determination of early lesion volumes with
random order of animals and MR sequences blinded to late MRI. To assess the reliability of
this procedure, results of two independent raters (CL and GR) were compared. The procedure
has a low vulnerability to imaging artifacts but might introduce bias. To obtain
complementary unbiased lesion volumes, we determined ADC lesion volumes both absolute
and relative to the non-ischemic hemisphere. Thresholds of 0.0006 mm2/s and 80 % of the
average ADC of the non-ischemic hemisphere were used.
Further ADC analysis
To further characterize early ADC changes and corroborate findings of our lesion volume
analysis, we calculated the changes in ADC histograms for all experimental groups. Voxels
were assigned to ADC bins with 0.00001 mm2/s width and volumes for each bin of the
ischemic hemisphere were subtracted from volumes of the nonischemic hemisphere.
Furthermore, the coefficients of determination of early T2w lesion volumes at 48 hours by
ADC lesion volumes were calculated for a wide range of ADC thresholds (figure 5). To
calculate ADC lesion volumes at each threshold, the volume of voxels below this threshold in
the nonischemic hemisphere was subtracted from the volume in the ischemic hemisphere.
Differences smaller than 15 µl were set to zero and outliers (more than two standard
deviations from the mean) removed prior to correlation analysis.
Prediction models and infarct probability maps
1) ADC prediction of infarct probability: First, ADC values of all voxels of all ischemic
hemispheres of one experimental group were divided in bins with 0.00001 mm2/s width. For
all ADC bins the percentage of voxels, which proceeded to infarction, was calculated.
Thereby a function was generated, which related absolute ADC value to infarct probability.
Second, for each voxel, the infarct probability predicted for its ADC value was obtained from
this curve, added to the infarct probability obtained from the visually delineated ADC lesion
(assumed to be 1 for voxels within the lesion and 0 for all other voxels) and the result divided
by 2.
2) Prediction by spatial infarct frequency: The method of generating spatial infarct frequency
maps is described above. Infarct probability was directly obtained from these maps for
prediction by spatial infarct frequency alone. Note that this prediction strategy does not use
early MRI but solely T2w imaging at 48 hours and thus predicts the same infarct for every
animal (the ‘average’ infarct for this model). This prediction strategy may be viewed as a
control which enables us to determine the additional information that is gained by early MRI
as compared to the assumption that every animal will develop an ‘average’ infarct determined
from other animals with the same MCAO duration.
3) Combination of ADC with spatial infarct frequency maps: The infarct probability maps
generated for ADC and spatial infarct frequency were added and the result divided by 2.
In a second step, infarct sizes predicted by all three models were calculated for all infarct
probability thresholds and the root mean squared error for predicted infarcts was calculated.
The lowest root mean squared error achieved was compared to the root mean squared error
for prediction by visually determined ADC lesion volumes and linear regression analysis
(Figure 5B).

Supplementary figure II. Comparison of ADC lesion size determination methods. A)
Two raters, blinded to the final infarct and to the results of each other visually delineated
ADC lesion (green and blue). This yielded largely the same lesion volumes as determination
by absolute (0.0006 mm2/s) or relative (80% of average contralateral ADC) thresholds (upper
panels). B) ADC histograms (difference non-ischemic – ischemic hemisphere) demonstrate
the complete recovery of ADC for 45 minutes MCAO (middle panels). C) ADC lesions
determined via an ADC threshold correlated well with final infarcts for 90 minutes MCAO
and MRI performed during or at six hours after MCAO. The best ADC threshold was detected
at around 0.00055-0.00065 mm2/s (lower right panel).

Supplementary Table I. Final ischemic lesion sizes after MCAO. Lesion sizes were
visually determined from T2w MRI at 48 hours and corrected for edema. The table gives
mean and standard deviations in µl for different MCAO durations and early MRI
measurement time points. Three animals which died prior to imaging at 48 hours and one
animal with artifacts on T2w imaging at 48 hours were excluded. Numbers in parentheses
denote analysis omitting all animals with no (<3µl) T2w lesion at 48 hours (failed MCAO).
Note that exclusion of animals with no T2w lesion significantly reduces the coefficient of
variation of infarct sizes.
