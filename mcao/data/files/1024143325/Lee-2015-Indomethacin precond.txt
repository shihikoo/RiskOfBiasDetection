Intracellular zinc overload causes neuronal injury during the course of neurological disorders, whereas mild
levels of zinc are beneﬁcial to neurons. Previous reports indicated that non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs,
including indomethacin and aspirin, can reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. This study found that chronic
pretreatment of rats with indomethacin, a non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, provided tolerance to ischemic injuries in an animal model of stroke by eliciting moderate zinc elevation in neurons. Consecutive intraperitoneal injection of indomethacin (3 mg/kg/day for 28 days) led to modest increases in intraneuronal zinc as well
as synaptic zinc content, with no signiﬁcant stimulation of neuronal death. Furthermore, indomethacin induced
the expressions of intracellular zinc homeostatic and neuroprotective proteins, rendering the brain resistant
against ischemic damages and improving neurological outcomes. However, administration of a zinc-chelator,
N,N,N′,N′-tetra(2-picolyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN; 15 mg/kg/day), immediately after indomethacin administration eliminated the beneﬁcial actions of the drug. Therefore, indomethacin preconditioning can modulate intracellular zinc availability, contributing to ischemic tolerance in the brain after stroke.

Introduction
Zinc participates in diverse neuronal and synaptic functions in the
central nervous system (CNS) as both a neurotransmitter and a signaling molecule. Zinc is also essential for constituting or regulating numerous proteins, including enzymes and transcriptional factors (Choi and
Koh, 1998; Cuajungco and Lees, 1997). In neurons, a large fraction of
intracellular zinc is present in tight association with metalloproteins,
and a certain amount of the metal is conﬁned within vesicular
endosomes (Sensi et al., 2011). Therefore, the concentration of free
zinc in the cytosol is normally low. However, as the labile pool of free
or loosely bound zinc becomes involved in neuronal signaling, the
metal is transiently released or liberated from them on demand. Synaptic vesicular zinc, which is closely sequestered by the activity of zinc

transporter-3 [ZnT-3; solute carrier (SLC) 30A3], is of special interest
in the CNS due to its unique involvement in synaptic and intraneuronal
functions (Choi and Koh, 1998; Palmiter and Huang, 2004).
Meanwhile, excessive amounts of labile zinc are detrimental to neurons. Animal models of acute neurological diseases, such as cerebral
ischemia, epilepsy, and trauma (Koh et al., 1996; Lee et al., 2002; Lee
et al., 2000a; Lee et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2000b; Suh et al., 2000), have
demonstrated that an overload of zinc occurs in vulnerable neurons of
the brain, commencing neurodegeneration. On the other hand, zinc
chelation interrupts the neuronal death process by reducing the intracellular levels of free zinc.
By contrast, moderate zinc load is beneﬁcial to neurons even under
conditions of brain injury; e.g., subjection of the brain to kainateinduced seizures precipitates mild zinc accumulation in certain neurons, eliciting the neuronal expression of heat shock protein 70
(Hsp70) that prevents or reduces neurodegeneration (Lee et al.,
2000b). Along the same lines, physical stimulation with two-photon
illumination can trigger a moderate buildup of intracellular zinc to
counteract subsequent hypoxic neuronal damage (Buchner et al.,
2002). Additionally, previous work attributed “cerebral ischemic preconditioning” (a phenomenon whereby mild ischemic injury engenders
tolerance toward consequent challenging insults) to mild zinc elevation
following the initial injury (Lee et al., 2008).
Despite some controversy concerning their clinical efﬁcacy (Nilsson
et al., 1995; Ricci et al., 2006), clinical and experimental animal studies

J.-Y. Lee et al. / Neurobiology of Disease 81 (2015) 186–195

have indicated that the prior use of non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., indomethacin and aspirin) may protect neurons
against ischemic injury. In this way, NSAIDs can potentially mitigate
stroke severity (Rist et al., 2013; Wilterdink et al., 2001), lessen ischemic
lesioning (Iadecola et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2010), and ameliorate neuronal injury (Candelario-Jalil and Fiebich, 2008; Sasaki et al., 1988).
Although the neuroprotective capacity of NSAIDs has been accredited
to their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenases (COXs) (Iadecola et al.,
2001), it may be exhibited irrespective of their anti-inﬂammatory
actions (Grilli et al., 1996).
NSAIDs can moderately mobilize intraneuronal zinc and produce a
chemical preconditioning effect that avoids neuronal injuries (Buchner
et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2001; Love et al., 2005). The current in vivo
study investigated the hypothesis that chronic drug pretreatment/
chemical preconditioning of the rat with indomethacin, a nonselective COX inhibitor, can modify intraneuronal zinc availability in
the brain to raise the expression of neuroprotective and zinc homeostatic
proteins and rescue the brain from ischemic injury.
Materials and methods
Animal study
This animal study was performed in accordance with the Guidelines
of the Asan Institute for Life Sciences for Laboratory Animal Care and
Use (Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea). Male Sprague–Dawley rats
(Orient Bio, Seoul, Korea) were used in the study. The animals were
given free access to standard rat chow and water throughout the
experiment.
Drug administration
Immediately prior to drug administration, NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, ﬂurbiprofen, and indomethacin) and N,N,N′,N′-tetra(2picolyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) were freshly
prepared in 0.5% carboxy methylcellulose in saline (Sigma) and 10%
ethanol (ethyl alcohol) in normal physiological saline (0.9% NaCl)
(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), respectively. Five-week-old male
Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into groups based on body weight
directly before the ﬁrst drug treatment. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid;
100 mg/kg body weight; Sigma), ibuprofen (100 mg/kg; Sigma),
naproxen (10 mg/kg; Sigma), ﬂurbiprofen (10 mg/kg; Sigma), or indomethacin (3 mg/kg; Sigma) was then intraperitoneally administered to
the rats everyday for 28 consecutive days by using an Ultra-Fine™ II
insulin syringe (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ), where the respective dosages
for each drug were determined by referring to long-term NSAID administration animal studies (Townsend and Pratico, 2005; McGeer and
McGeer, 2007a,b). At 1 h after each NSAID treatment, TPEN was injected
at a dosage of 15 mg/kg/day into the nape of the neck (Cho et al., 2010).
For the sham control group, equivalent volumes of vehicle solution
(0.5% carboxy methylcellulose in saline) were administered in the
same way as the drug solutions. Untreated rats served as an additional
group of control animals.

mirror, 400 nm; excitation ﬁlter, 330–380 nm; excitation ﬁlter,
420 nm; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a DS-Fi1/DS-U2 digital
camera and NIS-Elements imaging software (F 2.20; Nikon).
To quantify the labile zinc content, the area of interest (AOI) was
manually selected in mossy ﬁber area of the hippocampus, representing
the synaptic vesicular zinc. The average intensity of TFLZn-ﬂuorescence
was determined within the AOI with the help of Image Pro, a computerassisted image analysis program (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring,
MD, USA) (Lee et al., 2011). After subtracting background TFLZnﬂuorescence originating from a tissue-free area on the same microscope
slide under the constant imaging conditions, the level of labile zinc was
expressed as the arbitrary unit. Measurements were performed in ﬁve
tissue sections per animal.
Assessment of neuronal cell death
To detect neuronal death in the damaged brain, after staining brain
sections with 1% acid fuchsin, the cortex and striatum, the areas which
are vulnerable to focal ischemia, were examined and photographed at
the magniﬁcation of 100 × with a light microscope (Eclipse 80i). The
total number of acidophilic dead cells was counted in ten AOIs (area
size, 1.25 × 0.95 mm2) taken from 5 evenly spaced slices per animal,
using the image-analysis program Image Pro.
Immunohistochemistry
The following primary antibodies were used for the immunohistochemical staining of brain tissues: rabbit anti-ZnT-3 (kindly provided
by Dr. R.D. Palmiter, Department of Biochemistry, University of
Washington, Seattle, WA, USA), mouse anti-metallothionein (MT)-1/2
(E9; Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA), rabbit anti-Hsp70 (StressGen,
Victoria, BC, Canada) and mouse anti-hypoxia-inducible transcription
factor 1α (Hif-1α; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) antibodies. To
detect healthy neurons, we brieﬂy stained the tissue sections with
NeuroTrace 530 red ﬂuorescent Nissl stain™, which is selective for the
Nissl substance characteristic of neurons (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA, USA).
Brain sections were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2). After incubation with 3% hydrogen peroxide in absolute methanol, the sections were blocked with blocking buffer (3% normal donkey serum plus 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS). The
blocked sections were then reacted with the indicated primary antibody, followed successively by a biotinylated secondary antibody
(1:500; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), avidin-horseradish
peroxidase, and diaminobenzidine (0.015%)/hydrogen peroxide
(0.001%) (Vector Laboratories). After counterstaining with hematoxylin, the tissues were examined and photographed under an Eclipse 80i
light microscope.
Anti-ZnT-3 antibody-immunoreacted tissues were stained with an
Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) and examined under an Eclipse 80i ﬂuorescence microscope
equipped with a ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ﬁlter.
Western blot analysis

Staining and measurement of labile zinc in brain tissues
Three hours after the ﬁnal NSAID and/or TPEN application, the brains
were removed and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sagittal sections of
the right hemispheres (12 μm thick) were prepared on poly-L-lysinecoated slides by using a cryostat (HM550; Microm, Walldorf, Germany).
Labile zinc in the sagittal brain sections was histoﬂuorescently stained
with the zinc-speciﬁc probe, N-(6-methoxy-8-quinolyl)-pcarboxybenzoylsulphonamide (TFLZn, 0.1 mM in Tris buffer, pH 8.0;
Sigma), for 90 s (Cho et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2011). After a brief wash
in physiological saline, the TFLZn-stained tissues were examined and
photographed under an Eclipse 80i ﬂuorescence microscope (dichroic

Protein expression levels were evaluated by western blot analysis, as
described previously (Cho et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2011). The primary
antibodies included goat anti-ZnT-1 (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit
anti-ZnT-3, goat anti-ZnT-4 (Santa Cruz), goat anti-ZnT-5 (Santa Cruz),
goat anti-ZnT-6 (Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-Hsp70 (StressGen), rabbit
anti-metal-responsive transcription factor-1 (MTF-1; Santa Cruz),
rabbit-anti-MT-1 (Santa Cruz), mouse anti-synaptophysin (Sigma),
mouse anti-Hif-1α (Novus Biologicals), rabbit anti-COX 1 (Santa
Cruz), rabbit anti-COX 2 (Santa Cruz), and mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma)
antibodies. Immunoreacted proteins were visualized by using an
enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (Immobilon Western

Induction of transient focal cerebral ischemia

Evaluation of neurological outcomes

Drug- and vehicle-treated rats underwent surgery for transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) according to the intraluminal
ﬁlament method (Longa et al., 1989; Lee et al., 2012). The rats were
anesthetized intraperitoneally with a combination of ketamine
(40 mg/kg; Yuhan, Seoul, Korea) and xylazine (10 mg/kg; Rompun®;
Bayer Korea, Seoul, Korea). After exposure of the right common carotid
artery, the external carotid artery (ECA), and the internal carotid artery
(ICA), a 4-0 monoﬁlament nylon suture (Ethylon® surgical monoﬁlament polyamide; Ethicon, Edinburg, UK) with an enlarged end (diameter, 0.37–0.38 mm) was inserted into the ICA via the ECA and situated at
the beginning of the middle cerebral artery, a site located 20–22 mm
from the carotid bifurcation. Ninety minutes later, the suture ﬁlament
was withdrawn from the ICA to generate reperfusion. Sham-treated
control animals underwent the same operation without the nylon
ﬁlament insertion.
Throughout the duration of the surgery, core body temperature was
monitored and maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5 °C with the aid of a heating
blanket (Homeostatic Blanket System; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston,
MA, USA) and a heating lamp, and temporalis muscle temperature
was monitored by using a thermocouple thermometer (52II; Fluke,
Everett, WA, USA). In addition, the mean arterial blood pressure was
monitored at the left femoral artery by using a Research Grade Blood
Pressure Transducer (Harvard Apparatus), and blood was collected for
the analysis of hematological and biochemical parameters by using an
i-STAT® Analyzer installed with a CG8+® blood gas cartridge (Abbott,
East Windsor, NJ, USA). To ascertain cerebral blood occlusion, cerebral
blood ﬂow was investigated at a site 2 mm posterior and 6 mm lateral
to bregma via laser Doppler blood ﬂowmetry by using a moorVMSLDF™ Laser Doppler Perfusion and a Temperature Monitor (Moor,
Axminster, UK). After surgery, the animals were allowed to recover
from the anesthesia under a heating lamp.

Neurological deﬁcits were evaluated immediately before the
animals were killed and were based on the slight modiﬁcation of a
previously described ﬁve-point scale (Bederson et al., 1986; Lee et al.,
2012) to a four-point scale, as follows: score 0, normal function (no
deﬁcits); score 1, mild forelimb weakness; score 2, severe forelimb
weakness with consistent turns to the side of the deﬁcit when lifted
by the tail; score 3, compulsory circling or rolling; and score 4, no spontaneous walking or unconsciousness. Muscle strength and neuromuscular performance were also evaluated by using a grip/cling-strength
meter (Panlab, S.L.U., Cornellà, Spain), as previously described (Meyer
et al., 1979; Lee et al., 2012). After three successive trials, the value of
the cling and grasping force was calculated as [(the maximum grip
force of the paretic forepaw) / (the maximum grip force of the nonparetic normal forepaw)].

Assessment of ischemic injury
Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, the animals were killed under
deep anesthesia. The brains were removed, coronally sectioned into
six 2 mm thick sections on the rat brain matrix (PY2 72-529; Harvard
Apparatus), and stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride
(TTC; Sigma). Infarct areas were measured on the TTC-stained sections,
and infarct volume was calculated by multiplying the total infarct area
taken from six sections by the section thickness.
The presence of edema was assessed and quantiﬁed in six 20 μm
thick, cresyl violet-stained coronal sections, taken every 2 mm, as

Statistical analysis
Data were given as the mean ± the standard error of the mean
(SEM). Statistical signiﬁcance was determined at p b 0.05 by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Student–Newman–
Keuls post-hoc test.
Results
Health condition after daily administration of NSAIDs for
28 consecutive days
We initially chose the ﬁve non-selective COX inhibitors, aspirin
(100 mg/kg/day), ibuprofen (100 mg/kg/day), naproxen (10 mg/kg/day),
ﬂurbiprofen (10 mg/kg/day), and indomethacin (3 mg/kg/day), for
this study because all are well known for their neuroprotective capacity
to lower Alzheimer's pathogenesis in animal models of disease with
chronic application at the indicated dosages. In addition, the drugs are
not associated with any special concern regarding health condition
(e.g., gastrointestinal toxicity, reduced body weight, and attenuated
growth rate) (McGeer and McGeer, 2007a; McGeer and McGeer,
2007b; Townsend and Pratico, 2005). In the current study, a total of
28 daily NSAID treatments were administered to rats via intraperitoneal
injection. All animals survived the regimen and showed no morbidity or
gastrointestinal toxicity, as assessed by gross necropsy. Furthermore,
the drug-treated animals rarely demonstrated stunted growth when
compared with the sham-treated controls by body weight (Table 1).

Alterations in the free zinc pool following consecutive
administration of NSAIDs
After the daily administration of NSAIDs for 28 consecutive days, we
examined cerebral zinc content in the brain by staining brain tissues
with TFLZn (Fig. 1) (Lee et al., 2011). Measurement of the synaptic
vesicular pool of free zinc in the mossy ﬁber area of the hippocampus,
which represents the most abundant pool of free zinc in the brain,
revealed a prominent elevation (more than 2-fold) in zinc-reacted
TFLZn ﬂuorescence levels in indomethacin-treated rats relative to vehicle
(0.5% carboxy methylcellulose in saline)-treated rats or untreated control rats (Figs. 1G and I). However, consecutive administrations of the

189

other NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and ﬂurbiprofen), as well
as a single dose of indomethacin, failed to alter the zinc content. On the
other hand, treatment with the zinc-chelator, TPEN (15 mg/kg/day),
subsequent to indomethacin treatment (indomethacin + TPEN) dramatically lowered the TFLZn ﬂuorescence intensity to approximately
17% of the level in untreated control rats (Figs. 1H and I). These results
show that indomethacin altered the free zinc pool in the rat brain when
given chronically via intraperitoneal injection.
Because synaptic vesicular zinc pool is determined by ZnT-3, a vesicular membrane-integrated transporter protein that sequesters free zinc
into presynaptic vesicles in the axon terminals (Lee et al., 2011; Palmiter
et al., 1996), we brieﬂy performed western blot assay using the

Fig. 1. Changes in the histoﬂuorescently reactive zinc pool following consecutive daily treatment with non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs. Untreated control rats are shown in (A).
After a total of 28 daily intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (0.5% carboxy methylcellulose in saline) (B), aspirin (100 mg/kg/day) (C), ibuprofen (100 mg/kg/day) (D), naproxen
(10 mg/kg/day) (E), ﬂurbiprofen (10 mg/kg/day) (F), indomethacin (3 mg/kg/day) (G), or indomethacin (3 mg/kg/day) followed by N,N′,N′-tetra(2-picolyl)ethylenediamine
(TPEN) (15 mg/kg/day) (indomethacin + TPEN) (H), synaptic vesicular zinc content was detected in the hippocampal mossy ﬁber area (mf; asterisked area) of N-(6-methoxy-8quinolyl)-p-carboxybenzoylsulphonamide (TFLZn)-stained rat brain tissue sections. (I) Synaptic vesicular free zinc levels were quantiﬁed by measuring the intensity of TFLZn ﬂuorescence in the hippocampal mossy ﬁber area (mf; asterisked area in A–H). Five tissue sections per animal were evaluated for the quantiﬁcation (n = 7 animals per experimental group;
***p b 0.001 and ###p b 0.001 for the corresponding comparisons). Scale bar, 150 μm. (J) Western blots detected the protein expressions of ZnT-3 and Hsp70 in the hippocampi in the
context of various drug treatments.

hippocampal tissues to compare the expressions of ZnT-3 between the
drug-treated brains. In the absence of the quantiﬁcation, we solely
witnessed the substantial increase in the protein expression of ZnT-3
in the group of consecutive indomethacin treatment than the other
treatments (Fig. 1J). Furthermore, we also found the higher expression
of Hsp70 in the hippocampus of the rat with the consecutive indomethacin treatment (Fig. 1J).
We next evaluated the expression of ZnT-3 in the whole brain via
ﬂuorescence immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Both
assays showed increased ZnT-3 immunoreactivity after chronic indomethacin application (Figs. 2B, D, E) compared with vehicle treatment
(Figs. 2A, D, E), but TPEN administration after indomethacin treatment
reduced the expression levels of ZnT-3 (Figs. 2C–E).

Alterations in the expression levels of ZnT proteins
Expressions of zinc transporter (ZnT) proteins are responsive to
metals (Gaither and Eide, 2001; Lichten and Cousins, 2009). To determine whether ZnT expression is altered by the modiﬁcation of free
zinc levels following chronic indomethacin or indomethacin + TPEN
treatment, we evaluated the expressions of ZnT-1/-3/-4/-5/-6 proteins,
which collectively promote zinc efﬂux from cells and/or zinc sequestration into intracellular vesicles to reduce intracellular zinc content in
brain neurons (Liuzzi and Cousins, 2004; Palmiter and Huang, 2004).
The protein expression levels of ZnT-1/-3/-4/-5/-6 and MTF-1 were all
increased in the brains of the indomethacin-treated group compared
with the vehicle-treated group, and reduced in the brains of the
indomethacin + TPEN-treated group (Figs. 2D and E); however, the
extent of the expressional changes varied according to the protein

tested. By contrast, COX1/2 and synaptophysin expression levels were
seldom altered in the rat brain by drug treatment (Figs. 2 and 4).

Chronic indomethacin treatment causes a moderate elevation of
intraneuronal zinc content and induces the expression of
neuroprotective proteins
High magniﬁcation ﬂuorescence photomicrographs were employed
for the evaluation of TFLZn-reacted free zinc content in rat brain neurons. In parallel with the level of synaptic vesicular zinc (Figs. 3A–C),
they found neurons with a mild accumulation of free zinc in selected
neocortical area in the brains of indomethacin-treated rats compared
with vehicle-treated animals, as assessed by a moderate emission of
TFLZn ﬂuorescence in the former (Figs. 3D–E). Instead, the increase in
TFLZn ﬂuorescence was lost with indomethacin + TPEN treatment
(Figs. 3C, F). The ensuing staining of the TFLZn-stained tissues with
acid fuchsin (Figs. 3G–I) or the neuron-speciﬁc Neuro-Trace (Figs. 3J–L)
revealed a very rare loss of neuron in the indomethacin-treated rat
brain, suggestive of the absence of neuronal death, regardless of
intraneuronal zinc accumulation.
Previous studies showed that zinc can induce MT-1/2 and Hsp70
expressions, both of which protect neurons from various injuries,
including oxidative stress and metal toxicity (Gasull et al., 1994;
Kramer et al., 1996; Lee et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2000b). In this study,
chronic indomethacin treatment stimulated an increase in the number
of neurons in the neocortical area with strong immunoreactivity for
MT-1/2 and/or Hsp70, but the immunoreactive neuronal numbers
were signiﬁcantly attenuated by TPEN after indomethacin treatment
(Fig. 4). Elevated MT-1 and Hsp70 protein levels were similarly detected

N-(6-methoxy-8-quinolyl)-p-carboxybenzoylsulphonamide (TFLZn) staining (A–F) not only reveals the alteration in the level of the hippocampal synaptic vesicular zinc (A–C), but also demonstrates the appearance of moderate zinc-containing neurons (E), which remain healthy and viable based
on the absences of acid fuchsin-reactivity (G–I) and the loss of Neuro-Trace-reactive neurons (J–L), after consecutive daily indomethacin treatment (3 mg/kg/day; 2nd row). TFLZn

levels of Hif-1α, a neuroprotective protein that renders neurons resistant to injury after hypoxic preconditioning (Liu et al., 2005; Semenza,

Animals underwent MCAO/reperfusion surgery 3 h after ﬁnal drug
administration. Thirty minutes before and 1 h after the MCAO/

reperfusion procedure, various physiological parameters were assessed,
including body weight, arterial blood pressure, hemoglobin, blood pH,
and blood glucose, oxygen and carbon dioxide contents (Table 1).
Chronic drug administration yielded no statistical differences among
the experimental groups in terms of physiological parameters, although
arterial blood pressure was slightly reduced in the indomethacin- and
indomethacin + TPEN-treated groups relative to the vehicle control
group (Table 1). In addition, no variations were observed between the
assorted parameters before vs. after MCAO/reperfusion in any of the
groups (Table 1).

After chronic treatment with vehicle, indomethacin (3 mg/kg/day), or indomethacin (3 mg/kg/day) + N,N′,N′tetra(2-picolyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) (15 mg/kg/day), rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)/reperfusion surgery. Twenty-four hours later, 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was performed (A), and infarct volume was evaluated for each experimental group (B) (n = 7 animals per experimental group; **p b 0.01 and ***p b 0.001

experimental groups. Signiﬁcant reductions in both types of ischemic
injuries were found in rats that were chronically treated with
indomethacin compared with vehicle (infarct volume = 228.4 ±
8.3 mm3 for vehicle vs. 121.3 ± 6.7 mm3 for indomethacin treatment;
size of edema = 4.94 ± 0.43% for vehicle vs. 2.17 ± 0.43% for indomethacin treatment) (Figs. 5 and 6). However, treatment with
indomethacin + TPEN increased the severity of cerebral infarction and
edema in the drug-treated animals to 169.1 ± 12.33 mm3 and 3.54 ±
0.50% for infarct volume and edema size, respectively.
We next stained brain tissues with acid fuchsin to detect neuronal
death. Signiﬁcant differences were observed in the number of acidophilic dead neurons between the drug- and vehicle-treated ischemic brains
in the striatal core and the cortical penumbra (Fig. 7). The incidence of
acid fuchsin-stained degenerating neurons was as follows: vehicle-

treated group N indomethacin + TPEN-treated group N indomethacintreated group.
Lastly, neurological evaluations were conducted immediately before
the animals were killed to obtain neurological scores (Fig. 8A) and forepaw cling/grip strength (Fig. 8B). MCAO/reperfusion surgery induced
severe neurological dysfunction in the affected rats compared with
sham-operated control animals, as expected. However, indomethacin
treatment improved the neurological scores, whereas subsequent
TPEN treatment reversed the beneﬁcial actions of indomethacin
(Fig. 8A). Concerning the cling/grip-strength test (Lee et al., 2012;
Meyer et al., 1979), MCAO/reperfusion signiﬁcantly weakened the
grasping force of the affected forepaw. Grasping force was again improved by indomethacin, and decreased by subsequent TPEN treatment
(Fig. 8B).

Twenty-four hours later, the brains were coronally dissected into 20 μm thick slices, stained with cresyl violet, and evaluated for enlargement of the ipsilateral hemisphere relative to the

Discussion
A large body of evidence has substantiated the causative role of zinc
in neuronal injury following ischemic stroke. According to previous
studies using animal models of global or focal cerebral ischemia, an
overload of free zinc appears within vulnerable neurons in the hippocampus or the cortex after stroke, causing the neurons to undergo cell
death and precipitating cerebral infarction (Koh et al., 1996; Lee et al.,
2002; Park et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2014). The source of neurotoxic
zinc encompasses synaptic vesicular zinc (Koh et al., 1996) and intracellularly liberalized zinc from metalloproteins (Lee et al., 2000a; Lee et al.,
2003) or zinc-containing endosomes (Hwang et al., 2008; Jiang et al.,
2001). The genetically innate depletion of zinc, such as that occurring
in ZnT-3- or MT-3-null mice, as well as zinc chelation with CaEDTA,
TPEN, or clioquinol defends the brain or the neuron from ischemic injury (Koh et al., 1996; Lee et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2000b;
Zhao et al., 2014).
However, a contradictory report showed that the zinc-chelator
CaEDTA aggravated rather than lessened ischemic injury following
MCAO/reperfusion, and suggested the protective capacity of low-level
zinc against ischemic damage and neuronal insult (Kitamura et al.,
2006). Similarly, an earlier study found that a mild elevation in intracellular zinc content following prior physical stimulation rendered neurons less vulnerable to hypoxic insult, so it indicated the possibility
that low zinc levels may paradoxically mitigate the intracellular zinc
overload to prevent neuronal death (Buchner et al., 2002). We previously demonstrated that the moderate zinc increase during kainate-

induced epileptogenesis promoted Hsp70 expression that suppresses
neuronal death (Lee et al., 2000b).
In the present study using a subchronic application, a non-selective
NSAID, indomethacin, mildly increased intracellular zinc and stimulated
the expressions of zinc homeostatic and neuroprotective proteins.
Indomethacin-induced moderate zinc load in turn mitigated ischemic
injuries (i.e., neuronal death, infarction, and edema) and improved
neurologic outcomes in an animal model of ischemic stroke. The zinctriggered expressions of neuroprotective and zinc homeostatic proteins
were likely essential for the chemical preconditioning effect of indomethacin, because the zinc-chelating agent, TPEN, reversed the
enhanced expression of the beneﬁcial proteins and alleviated ischemic
tolerance. Accordingly, we hypothesize that indomethacin drives the
intracellular mobilization of zinc in neurons, and that the metal then
promotes the expression of zinc-regulating proteins (e.g., ZnTs or
MTs). ZnTs and MTs preserve cytoplasmic free zinc levels within a
moderate range, which is still too low to provoke neuronal injury.
Indomethacin-induced mild zinc also facilitates the upregulation of
neuroprotective proteins, including Hsp70 and Hif-1α, so they shield
neurons from ischemic or hypoxic injury due to excitotoxicity, oxidative
stress, or excessive zinc load. Taken together, the preconditioning
actions of indomethacin protect the brain from neuronal death, cerebral
infarction, and edema following ischemic stroke. Here, it is notable that
the neuroprotective proteins MTs (Westin and Schaffner, 1988), Hsp70
(Wu et al., 1986), and Hif-1α (Murphy et al., 2005), and ZnTs (Sekler
and Silverman, 2012) are all induced in response to zinc. The induced
and zinc-bound form of MTF-1 translocates into the nucleus, where it

binds to metal-response element (MRE) promoter sequences to activate
the transcriptional expression of the zinc homeostatic proteins and
neuroprotective proteins in a zinc-dependent manner (Palmiter, 2004).
Earlier work suggested that chronic treatment with aspirin and
other NSAIDs may reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. Indomethacin
given before challenge may also have a neuroprotective effect against
ischemic injury (Furlow and Hallenbeck, 1978; Miyamoto et al., 2003).
Although a few presumptions have been made regarding NSAIDstimulated intracellular zinc mobilization and the creation of a chemical
preconditioning effect in neurons (Buchner et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2001;
Love et al., 2005), our study is the ﬁrst to explicitly detail the mechanism
underlying the in vivo program of NSAID preconditioning against
ischemic challenge in the brain.
However, it is still obscure why, among the NSAIDs tested, only indomethacin modulated zinc availability to protect the brain from ischemic
stroke. COX expression seems to be excluded from the involvement
in the zinc-mediated preconditioning because we found no alteration
in the level of COX1/2 proteins after the indomethacin and
indomethacin + TPEN treatments. Instead, the enzymatic action of
each NSAID to inhibit COX1/2 may be contributable to the alteration
of intracellular zinc level. In comparison with other NSAIDs that
commonly inhibit COX, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of
arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, a distinct property of indomethacin
is its tighter binding to the different portions of the active site of COX
enzyme to prevent arachidonic acid from approaching the active site.
Indomethacin also inhibits phospholipase A2 to block the release of
arachidonic acid from phospholipids (Franson et al., 1980). Therefore,
the different actions of COX inhibitors toward the lipid metabolism
may differentially trigger the zinc mobilization from zinc-bound
phospholipids abundant in the brain (Binder et al., 2001), determining
the capability of mild zinc-induced preconditioning. Indeed, there are
previous ﬁndings that aspirin, a non-selective COX inhibitor/NSAID,
provoked a mild increase in neuronal zinc levels, followed by a druginduced hypoxic tolerance (Buchner et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2001;
Love et al., 2005). Currently, a plausible assumption or expectation is
that the NSAID-induction of zinc-mediated preconditioning effect
could depend on the drug application method (e.g., route, dosage, and
duration). Otherwise, the neuroprotective activity of the other NSAIDs
against stroke may be more highly attributed to mechanisms aside
from the intracellular zinc signals (Grilli et al., 1996; Choi et al., 2009).
It remains to be determined whether inﬂammation modulates zinc
homeostasis or vice versa in the CNS. We have noted previous studies
employing mouse models of allergic inﬂammation that inﬂammation
is accompanied by a reduction in labile zinc (Truong-Tran et al., 2002)
and that the low levels of zinc exert anti-inﬂammatory actions by modifying the expression of zinc homeostatic proteins (Lang et al., 2007).
These studies demonstrated that Zip (Zrt- and Irt-like protein;
SLC39A)- and ZnT-driven zinc buffering may play a role in allergic
inﬂammation, suggesting a possible correlation between NSAID administration and zinc homeostasis.
In conclusion, together with the studies described above, our ﬁndings suggest that indomethacin and other NSAIDs might be capable of
modulating intracellular zinc availability in the brain. If so, these drugs
would be clinically applicable to the management of various brain diseases stemming from zinc dyshomeostasis, comprising ischemic stroke,
Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, hypoglycemia-induced brain injuries, and
so on (Frederickson et al., 2005; Sensi et al., 2009; Sensi et al., 2011).
