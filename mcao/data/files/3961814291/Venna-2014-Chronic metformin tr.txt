Abstract
Metformin is currently the first-line treatment drug for type 2 diabetes. Metformin is a well-known activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In experimental studies, metformin has been shown to exert direct vascular effects by increasing vascular
endothelial growth factor expression and improving microvascular density. As stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability
and angiogenesis is implicated as an important mechanism in functional recovery, we hypothesized that chronic metformin treatment would improve post-stroke functional recovery by enhancing functional microvascular density. For this study, C57BL/6N
male mice were subjected to a 60-min middle cerebral artery occlusion, and were given 50 mg/kg/day metformin beginning 24 h
post-stroke for 3 weeks. Behavioral recovery was assessed using adhesive-tape removal and the apomorphine-induced turning
test. The role of angiogenesis was assessed by counting vessel branch points from fluorescein-conjugated lectin-perfused brain
sections. Importantly even if metformin treatment was initiated 24 h after injury it enhanced recovery and significantly improved
stroke-induced behavioral deficits. This recovery occurred in parallel with enhanced angiogenesis and with restoration of endogenous cerebral dopaminergic tone and revascularization of ischemic tissue. We assessed if the effects on recovery and angiogenesis were mediated by AMPK. When tested in AMPK a-2 knockout mice, we found that metformin treatment did not have the
same beneficial effects on recovery and angiogenesis, suggesting that metformin-induced angiogenic effects are mediated by
AMPK. The results from this study suggest that metformin mediates post-stroke recovery by enhancing angiogenesis, and these
effects are mediated by AMPK signaling.

Introduction
More than 750 000 new strokes occur each year in the USA alone.
Worldwide, stroke is responsible for ~4.4 million deaths (9% of
total deaths) annually (Strong et al., 2007; Meyers et al., 2012). As
life expectancy increases, the incidence of stroke will continue to
rise (Strong et al., 2007) and improvements in medical care will
increase survival rates, leading to increased numbers of stroke survivors in our communities (Towﬁghi & Saver, 2011; Burke et al.,
2012). Due to the fact that stroke survivors often experience
profound, life-long deﬁcits, stroke remains the primary cause of
adult-onset disability (Towﬁghi & Saver, 2011). Therefore, novel
post-stroke interventions to improve functional recovery and quality
of life for stroke patients are urgently needed.
Post-stroke functional recovery is thought to occur by the compensation of lost capabilities by functionally related regions in the
intact hemisphere or by the restoration of structural rewiring within
the ischemic region (Chopp et al., 2007; Ergul et al., 2012). Clinical
imaging studies suggest that lost functions are initially shifted to the
spared hemisphere and later, as inﬂammation subsides and blood

ﬂow improves, these functions are taken over by the peri-infarct cortex (Rossini et al., 2003; Johnston et al., 2012). It has been reported
that the restoration of blood ﬂow by enhanced angiogenesis and
revascularization of ischemic tissue is an important mechanism for
long-term functional recovery (Rossini et al., 2003; Chopp et al.,
2007; Ergul et al., 2012; Johnston et al., 2012).
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine protein kinase, is activated by phosphorylation of threonine 172 in the catalytic a-subunit when energy supply
is limited, such as occurs in stroke. AMPK signaling is a critical
sensor of peripheral energy balance, and may be an important determinant of blood vessel recruitment to tissues subjected to ischemic
stress (Nagata et al., 2003). The catalytic subunit alpha (a) of
AMPK is expressed in most cell types including endothelial cells,
and is a major metabolic regulator at both the cellular and organismal level. AMPK activation has also been shown to signiﬁcantly
promote vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression (Ouchi et al., 2005) and neurogenesis (Wang et al., 2012). Metformin
is a well-recognized AMPK activator both in vitro and in vivo
(Zhou et al., 2001). Acute activation of AMPK by metformin is detrimental in experimental stroke models (Li et al., 2010), secondary
to lack of substrates such as glucose in the ischemic brain. However, little is known about the role of metformin in chronic stroke

recovery after experimental stroke. Recent research suggests that
metformin contributes to energy regulation and anti-inﬂammatory
effects in an AMPK-independent manner (Viollet et al., 2012), and
clinical studies suggest that chronic treatment with metformin may
also reduce stroke incidence (UKPDS Group, 1998).
Metformin is the ﬁrst-line treatment for glycemic control as it
reduces hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity
in type 2 diabetic patients without causing additional weight gain
(Nathan et al., 2009). Interestingly, studies have shown that metformin has other beneﬁcial properties, including favorable cardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects (Zimmet & Collier, 1999; Roussel
et al., 2010). Previous studies demonstrate that acute treatment with
metformin worsens ischemic injury by enhancing AMPK activity
and lactic acidosis. However, chronic metformin treatment prior to
stroke offers potent neuroprotective effects similar to preconditioning (Venna et al., 2012a) by downregulation of AMPK by a negative feedback mechanism, blunting ischemia-induced AMPK
activation (Li et al., 2010). To date, the effect of metformin treatment on long-term functional recovery in experimental stroke has
not yet been investigated except in diabetic animals (Prakash et al.,
2013). In this study, we examined whether post-stroke metformin
treatment could improve functional recovery and revascularization
after ischemia, and investigated the role of AMPK in chronic metformin treatment.

Materials and methods
Focal cerebral ischemia model
The present study was conducted in accordance with NIH guidelines
for the care and use of animals in research, and under protocols
approved by the Center for Laboratory Animal Care at University of
Connecticut Health Center (UCHC). Focal transient cerebral ischemia was induced in male mice (20–25 g) by right middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion as described previously (Li et al., 2010; Venna et al., 2012b). To perform surgery,
mice were rapidly sedated with 4% isoﬂurane anesthesia, and the
level of sedation was conﬁrmed by the lack of response to tail
pinch. Surgery was performed under 1% continuous isoﬂurane anesthesia. At the end of ischemia (60 min MCAO), the animal was
brieﬂy re-anesthetized and reperfusion was initiated by ﬁlament
withdrawal. Cortical perfusion (laser Doppler ﬂowmetry) was evaluated throughout MCAO and early reperfusion as described previously (Li et al., 2010; Venna et al., 2012b). One group of mice was
given metformin or vehicle treatment beginning at 24 h after stroke,
and killed for infarct analysis after 72 h of reperfusion. A second
group of mice was given metformin or vehicle treatment for
3 weeks initiated at 24 h after stroke. Mice were subjected to behavioral tests for 30 days prior to death. Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6N
mice were purchased from Charles River (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) and randomly assigned to treatment
groups. An additional cohort of AMPK a-2 knockout (KO) mice
and WT littermates (C57BL6 background) was treated with metformin or vehicle, and assessed for long-term behavioral recovery and
histological outcomes at 30 days post-stroke. These mice were originally obtained from Dr Benoit Viollet in France, and re-derived and
bred in-house at UCHC.
Drug treatment
Metformin was dissolved in saline (vehicle) and given in a dose volume of 0.2 mL/20 g body weight by intraperitoneal route (i.p.). The

treatment group was administered metformin once daily (50 mg/kg/
day) starting 24 h after the onset of MCAO. The cohort used for
infarct analysis received two doses, while the long-term survival
cohort was treated for 3 weeks. The control group received an equal
volume of saline for the same duration.
Infarct analysis and blood glucose analysis
The infarct analysis cohort was subjected to stroke, and received
delayed metformin treatment at 24 and 48 h post-stroke. At 72 h of
reperfusion, all animals were killed by cervical dislocation. Brains
were removed and cut into ﬁve 2-mm coronal sections and stained
with 1.5% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) for 8 min at
38 °C. Slices were formalin-ﬁxed (4%), digitalized and infarct volumes were analysed (Sigma Scan Pro) as previously described (Venna et al., 2012b). The ﬁnal infarct volumes are presented as a
percentage (percentage of contralateral structures with correction for
edema)  SD, as previously described (Li et al., 2010; Venna
et al., 2012b; n = 10/group). For atrophy measurement in long-term
survival cohorts, mice were killed at 30 days post-stroke and perfused transcardially with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde, and the brains were cyroprotected
in 30% sucrose. The brains were cut into 30-lm sections on a freezing microtome, and every eighth slice from the appearance of corpus
callosum was stained with Cresyl violet for evaluation of atrophy.
Analysis was performed from digitized images of brain sections.
Due to the chronic nature of this study, cerebral atrophy was used
as an indirect measure of cell death in long-term survival cohorts.
The volume of tissue atrophy was determined by measuring both
hemispheres, the cystic cavity and lateral ventricles as previously
described with n = 10 in each group (Bland et al., 2000; Li et al.,
2004, 2010). Blood glucose levels were assessed at day 30 with a
VetScan iSTAT analyser (n = 9/group).
Neurological deficit scores
Neurological deﬁcit scores (NDS) were evaluated in both the intraischemic period and at 72 h post-stroke (n = 10/group). The scoring
system was as follows: 0, no deﬁcit; 1, forelimb weakness and torso
turning to the ipsilateral side when held by tail; 2, circling to
affected side; 3, unable to bear weight on affected side; and 4, no
spontaneous locomotor activity or barrel rolling (Venna et al.,
2012b).
Adhesive-tape removal test
The adhesive-tape (sticky-tape) removal test is a measure of somatosensory dysfunction after cerebral ischemia in mice (Bouet et al.,
2009). Adhesive-backed tape (30 9 40 mm) was used as tactile
stimuli placed on the distal–radial region of the left wrist, and the
mean time to remove the tape was recorded. Animals were trained
for 5 days once a day prior to stroke, and the latency to remove
adhesive tape was measured on days 7, 14 and 28 after stroke
(n = 9/group).
Apomorphine-induced rotational activity
Spontaneous motor asymmetry and increased rotational bias toward
the lesion side after injection of the dopamine agonist apomorphine
(2 mg/kg i.p.) was quantiﬁed using an automated rotometer (RotaCount 8 Rotation Counter; Columbus Instruments) in which mice
were harnessed to swivels for 5 min of habituation before being

injected with drug. Apomorphine was ﬁrst dissolved in 0.1% ascorbate (in H2O) and then buffered with 10 9 PBS to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.3 mg/mL in 1 9 PBS. I.p. injection volumes were
100 lL/10 g body weight. After apomorphine injection, animals
were monitored for 60 min. Mean turning bias is expressed as the
difference between the right and left turns over a 60-min period.
This test was performed on days 3 and 30 after stroke (n = 9/
group). Data are presented as rotational bias (total right turns  total
left turns).
Fluorescein-labeled lectin injections and histological analysis
Mice were anesthetized under isoﬂurane anesthesia and the femoral
artery was exposed by a small incision. Fluorescein-labeled lycopersicon esculentum lectin (Vector Labs, CA, USA) was diluted 1 : 1
with saline, and 200 lL was injected into the femoral artery 5 min
before death. To obtain sections for histology, animals were deeply
anesthetized and perfused transcardially with ice-cold PBS followed
by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were harvested, cryoprotected in
30% sucrose and cut on a freezing microtome into 30-lm sections.
Floating sections were stored at 20 °C. For bromodeoxyuridine
(BrDU) staining, a cohort of mice (n = 6/group) was injected with
50 mg/kg of BrDU (Sigma) once a day from days 3 to 7. BrDU colabeling was performed on lectin-perfused brain sections.
Immunohistochemistry
To perform immunohistochemistry, 30-lm sections obtained at
30 days after reperfusion were slide-mounted and incubated in
blocking solution followed by microwave irradiation for 5 min in
0.1 M, pH 6 citrate buffer solution. Newborn cells were visualized
by co-labeling with BrDU in FITC-conjugated lectin-perfused
brains. Co-labeling was done on irradiated lectin brain sections
using CD31 (1 : 200; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and were subsequently incubated for 60 min with rhodamine-conjugated antimouse Ab, after washes sections were examined. Staining for VEGF
and glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP) quantiﬁcation was performed on subsequent sections following an overnight incubation
with a rhodamine-conjugated GFAP antibody (1 : 250; DAKO) or
VEGF antibody (1 : 200; Abcam), and slices were subsequently
incubated in secondary antibody for 60 min before washing and
coverslipped using Fluromount. Sections were visualized under an
inverted light Zeiss axiovert ﬂuorescence microscope; n = 9/group.
Histological quantification
Thirty-micrometer brain sections were mounted on Superfrost Plus
slides (Fisher). Sections were imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M ﬂuorescence microscope under a 209 objective, and images were processed with a 1.3 gamma setting. Three images were taken from
three pre-speciﬁed areas in the peri-ischemic region of coronal brain
per animal (n = 9 animals/group) and stained. Vessel branch points
were quantiﬁed at ~0.7 mm from bregma (lateral ~1.2–1.8 mm and
a depth of ~1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 mm), and GFAP and VEGF expression
quantiﬁed at ~0.2 mm bregma (lateral ~1.2–1.8 mm and a depth of
~1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 mm) in each brain by a blinded investigator in the
peri-infarct area adjacent to the ischemic region (see schematic in
Fig. 4). A branch point was deﬁned as a single ﬂuorescein-labeled
vessel noticeably separating into two distinct and separate vessel
tracks. GFAP-positive cell bodies were quantiﬁed from GFAPstained sections, and numbers were obtained from counting GFAP+
cell bodies from each image by a blinded investigator (n = 9/group).

Statistics
Data were expressed as mean  SEM except for infarct and NDS,
which were presented as mean  SD and median  interquartile
range, respectively. All animals were tail marked and assigned to
one of the treatments using a randomized number assigned to one of
the treatment conditions by SPSS software. Statistics were performed
by either univariate analysis for two groups or two-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) for repeated-measures using SPSS version 17. The
Mann–Whitney U-test was used for non-parametric tests (NDS). A
P-value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant. Investigators performing MCAO, behavioral, histological and infarct size
analysis were blinded to the treatment group.

Results
Metformin administration has no effect on infarct size or NDS
72 h after MCAO
In order to investigate whether delayed post-stroke metformin
administration could inﬂuence ischemic infarct volume, mice were
subjected to a 60-min MCAO and reperfusion. Mice were treated 24
and 48 h after stroke with either metformin or a vehicle control. At
72 h post-stroke, animals were killed and infarcts were evaluated
with TTC staining (Fig. 1B). Infarct analysis revealed that metformin-treated stroke animals had a total infarct volume of
40.03  5.3% (n = 10), and vehicle-treated animals had an infarct
area of 38.5  4.8% (n = 10); power analysis from the using G
POWER ver. 3.1.7 conﬁrmed no statistical difference between the two
groups. In addition, no signiﬁcant differences were seen in the striatum or cortical infarct areas (P > 0.05; Fig. 1C). There was no signiﬁcant effect of delayed metformin treatment on the NDS at 72 h
post-stroke (metformin 2.5  1, vehicle 2.5  0.75; P > 0.05;
n = 10/group; Fig. 1D). One animal from the metformin group was
excluded due to subarachnoid hemorrhage, and one from the vehicle
group was excluded due to excessive weight loss. No mortality was
seen in either group at 72 h.
Metformin treatment reduced latency of adhesive-tape
removal
In parallel to the treatment with 50 mg/kg/day metformin or vehicle,
pre-trained animals were tested for latency in the adhesive-tape
removal test. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a signiﬁcant effect
of stroke (F1,26 = 173.7, P < 0.001) and of metformin treatment
(F1,26 = 6.0, P = 0.02), and a signiﬁcant stroke 9 treatment interaction (F1,26 = 5.7, P = 0.02). These results suggest that stroke signiﬁcantly increased the latency in tape removal, and that the strokeenhanced latency in tape removal was signiﬁcantly improved by
metformin treatment (Fig. 2).
Metformin treatment reduced apomorphine-induced rotational
activity
We next investigated whether chronic metformin treatment reduced
apomorphine-induced rotational behavior in mice subjected to 60min MCAO. Data are expressed as the difference between the right
and left turns over a 60-min period (Fig. 2). Although no signiﬁcant
differences between vehicle- and drug-treated groups were seen in
rotational behavior at day 3, repeated-measures ANOVA showed a signiﬁcant effect of treatment (F1,26 = 5.3, P = 0.03), a signiﬁcant
effect of stroke (F1,26 = 126.5, P < 0.01) and an interaction between

Blood glucose levels and body weights were analysed at day 30,
1 week following 3 weeks of treatment with metformin. There were
no signiﬁcant differences in body weight in the metformin-treated
stroke group compared with vehicle (metformin 33.9  3 g, vehicle
30.6  5 g; P > 0.05; n = 9/group). Similarly, no signiﬁcant differences were observed in blood glucose levels (metformin

of surgery (F1,78 = 56.8, P < 0.001) and a signiﬁcant effect of treatment (F1,78 = 9.06, P = 0.004). Similarly, BrDU co-labeling at day
30 showed BrDU+ cells incorporated into blood vessels in metformin-treated stroke brains (n = 6/group; Fig. 4C). Together, these
ﬁndings suggest that long-term metformin treatment promotes angiogenesis after stroke. To further conﬁrm that the increased number of
perfused blood vessels in metformin was not secondary to microthrombosis in the vehicle group, we performed co-labeling with
CD31. Signiﬁcant differences between vehicle and metformin
groups were seen, conﬁrming increased angiogenesis in metformintreated animals (Fig. 5).
Metformin increased VEGF expression and reduced glial
scaring
Metformin-treated animals had increased expression of VEGF, and a
signiﬁcant difference in integrated optical density was observed
when compared with vehicle in the ipsilateral striatum
(F1,54 = 26.68, P < 0.001) (Fig. 6A and B). In addition, the glial
scar area was signiﬁcantly larger in the vehicle group compared with

metformin-treated animals (F1,18 = 6.05, P = 0.026; n = 9/group)
(Fig. 6C and D). A statistically signiﬁcant reduction in the number
of GFAP-positive cells was seen in the metformin-treated group
compared with vehicle controls (F1,54 = 10.5, P = 0.002; n = 27
images from nine brains per group and 3 images/brain from the ipsilateral region were used for analysis) (Fig. 6E and F).
Metformin treatment effects on recovery and angiogenesis are
mediated by AMPK
AMP-activated protein kinase a-2 KO mice were treated with vehicle or chronic metformin to investigate the role of AMPK in metformin-induced recovery. Mice treated with vehicle or metformin
starting 24 h after stroke did not show signiﬁcant differences
between groups either in the adhesive-tape removal test (even at day

metformin groups (vehicle 8.4  1.4, metformin 9.1  1.7;

contrast to the beneﬁcial effects of metformin in WT mice, metformin treatment did not reduce post-stroke atrophy in AMPK a-2 KO
mice when compared with vehicle-treated KO mice (13  3.2 vs.
metformin 12  4.4; n = 10/group). Mortality was 2 in each group.

Discussion
This study demonstrates the beneﬁts of chronic post-stroke metformin treatment on behavioral recovery and post-stroke angiogenesis.
Delayed post-stroke metformin treatment improved functional recovery, as measured by the adhesive-tape removal test and the apomorphine-induced turning test. Although mice tested 3 days post-stroke
showed no behavioral beneﬁt, chronic metformin treatment signiﬁcantly reduced rotational bias at day 30 post-stroke, suggesting that
metformin treatment ameliorated the abnormal dopaminergic tone
that occurs following stroke. We also observed that chronic metformin treatment signiﬁcantly enhanced angiogenesis, conﬁrmed by an
increased number of branch points in functional blood vessels and
BrDU co-labeling. This suggests that chronic metformin treatment
enhances functional recovery in parallel to the induction of angiogenesis.
The intra-arterial suture occlusion of the MCA used in this study
is the most commonly used focal stroke model in the mouse (Liu &
McCullough, 2011). This ischemic injury model mimics a clinical
MCAO, the most prevalent form of human stroke (Liu & McCullough, 2011). A blockage in this vessel leads to obstruction of collateral blood supply, and produces focal ischemic lesions in the
striatum and motor cortex (Liu & McCullough, 2011; Truong et al.,
2012). Previous studies have reported that with prolonged reperfusion and survival times, the infarct gradually spreads to the other
parts of the MCA territory. In this model, the time-dependent

increase in infarct volume peaks after 24 h of reperfusion, and is
consistent with several other magnetic resonance imaging experiments of transient MCAO (van Lookeren Campagne et al., 1999;
Hoehn et al., 2001; Liu & McCullough, 2011). To evaluate recovery independent of ischemic damage, we initiated metformin treatment after ischemic damage had peaked. As pre-stroke acute
metformin treatment has been shown to increase ischemic damage
(Li et al., 2010), we used an independent cohort to analyse changes
in ischemic volume at 72 h. Former studies have indicated that
lesion development slows considerably or ceased altogether by 24 h
after the onset of ischemia (Dereski et al., 1993; Garcia et al.,
1993). Consistent with this, our histological analysis conﬁrmed that
no signiﬁcant difference in infarct size was seen at 72 h with
delayed metformin treatment.
Neurological deﬁcits induced by cerebral ischemia typically
improve in the ﬁrst few days or weeks after a stroke. Previous studies have demonstrated that functional beneﬁts can be achieved independently of reduction in the gross infarct volume (Thiyagarajan
et al., 2008). Motor deﬁcit and recovery is greatly variable, even
among patients with identical clinical severity in the acute phase.
Multiple explanations for these differences have been proposed,
including degree of edema reabsorption, rate of intracranial pressure
change (which can contribute to secondary ischemic damage), variability in the extent to which collateral vessels from adjacent arteries
supply blood to the penumbra region (Rossini et al., 2003; Murphy
& Corbett, 2009), differences in organization of neuronal connections in different cortical areas (Newton et al., 2006) and variability
of functional appropriation by surviving brain regions (Murphy &
Corbett, 2009; Fridriksson, 2010). Although activation of AMPK by
metformin has been well described, its effect on the post-stroke
recovery is not understood. Chronic AMPK activation has been
shown to promote VEGF, which appears to be an important player
in regulating angiogenesis (Nagata et al., 2003; Ouchi et al., 2005).
Consistent with this, we found increased VEGF expression in

metformin-treated animals, suggesting this is an important underlying mechanism in metformin-induced recovery.
Recovery from post-stroke motor deﬁcits has been associated with
cerebral plasticity, the ability of the brain to compensate for loss of
function through reorganization and rewiring of neuronal networks.
It has been previously reported in both experimental and clinical
studies that these restoration processes may take several days or
weeks. The adhesive removal task is a sensitive indicator of deﬁcits
caused by sensorimotor cortex damage after MCAO-induced focal
ischemia (Bouet et al., 2009). Impairment of the contralateral limb
contributes to increased latency in removal of the adhesive tape,
indicating a deﬁcit in sensorimotor function and a possible impairment in motor control. In this study, metformin-treated mice tested
7 days after stroke showed no signiﬁcant difference in latency compared with vehicle. But when tested at day 14 and day 28 after
stroke, chronic metformin-treated animals were signiﬁcantly faster at
removing the adhesive tape, indicating enhanced recovery compared
with vehicle-treated animals despite equivalent initial infarct volumes. Consistent with earlier studies, the delay in the recovery of

adhesive removal may be due to the time required for restoration of
functional and structural plasticity. Metformin has been shown to
promote cell proliferation and improve neuronal plasticity, and new
cells take several weeks to mature and incorporate into functional
networks (Menendez & Vazquez-Martin, 2012; Potts & Lim, 2012;
Wang et al., 2012).
Hemiparesis and unilateral spatial neglect following cerebral
ischemia are common and disabling conditions. Stroke disrupts the
integrity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system (Kronenberg et al.,
2012), causing affected mice to circle to one side, possibly reﬂecting
a stronger push or pull strength of the unaffected limb. Although
this rotation behavior deﬁcit is normalized in the ﬁrst few days poststroke, mice with unilateral lesions induced by stroke respond to an
acute injection of the dopamine agonist apomorphine by exhibiting
a pronounced and continuous rotation behavior to the right side.
This is consistent with an ipsilateral rotation, presumably because an
increased amount of striatal dopamine interacts with dopaminergic
receptors on the intact side of the brain. Beneﬁcial effects of the
restoration of dopaminergic tone have been previously reported.

Normalization of rotation bias may therefore have an important role
in restoration of functional recovery in stroke survivors (Veizovic
et al., 2001).
Chronic metformin treatment is associated with a signiﬁcant
improvement in the endogenous dopaminergic tone while simultaneously maintaining glycemic control (Uehara et al., 2001; OrtegaGonzalez et al., 2005). Chronic metformin treatment consistently
reduced rotation behavior in stroke mice compared with vehicle, an
effect not observed at the 3 days of treatment. One possible explanation is that metformin-induced increases in angiogenesis may contribute to restoration of dopaminergic tone in the ischemic
hemisphere (Potts & Lim, 2012; Sun et al., 2012; Wang et al.,
2012). It is also possible that reduced rotation may be caused by
non-speciﬁc sedative effects of apomorphine (Muller et al., 2004) or
a drug interaction with metformin. We did not ﬁnd any visual evidence of sedation at day 3 or day 30 while testing, and did not
observe any differences in spontaneous locomotor activity between
the metformin and vehicle groups when tested in open ﬁeld following the apomorphine rotation test (data not shown). In addition, the
metformin treatment was stopped at day 21 post-stroke and the apomorphine test was performed on day 30. Another possible explanation for reduced rotation behavior is that chronic metformin
treatment caused overstimulation of dopamine receptors and
sensitized dopaminergic tone, resulting in a downregulation of
those receptors (Uehara et al., 2001). Further studies are needed to
investigate how chronic treatment with metformin eliminated
stroke-induced rotation bias, but restoration of neural networks via
angiogenesis is a plausible explanation.
Metformin has been shown to rapidly penetrate the blood–brain
barrier and differentially accumulate in the brain, where it helps to
attenuate vascular inﬂammation (Labuzek et al., 2010b; Kim &
Choi, 2012). Surprisingly, metformin treatment resulted in functional
beneﬁts without a signiﬁcant change in the initial gross infarct volume or in blood glucose levels. It has been shown previously that

metformin treatment increases phagocytosis of dead tissue, which
could potentially contribute to a reduced rate of intracranial pressure,
increasing the percentage of living cells and potentially contributing
to enhanced recovery (Lelekov-Boissard et al., 2009; Labuzek et al.,
2010a). We have previously reported that delayed post-stroke metformin treatment consistently reduces atrophy (Li et al., 2010).
Angiogenesis and remodeling of vessels in the peri-infarct region
after stroke also contributes to stroke recovery (Chopp et al., 2007;
Johnston et al., 2012). In general, enhancement of angiogenesis has
been reported in the ischemic border zone of human brain autopsy
sections, an effect that was decreased in aged patients (Szpak et al.,
1999). Evidence from experimental studies supports a role for angiogenesis in functional recovery (Chopp et al., 2007; Menendez &
Vazquez-Martin, 2012; Potts & Lim, 2012; Sun et al., 2012; Wang
et al., 2012). Angiogenesis and neurogenesis genes are upregulated
within minutes of cerebral ischemia onset in rodents; these proteins
can remain elevated in the ischemic hemisphere for hours to weeks
after the insult (Font et al., 2010; Ergul et al., 2012). VEGF is an
important regulator of angiogenesis that has been shown to regulate
cell proliferation, migration and differentiation of endothelial cells
(Shibuya & Claesson-Welsh, 2006; Stahmann et al., 2010). Metformin is a potent AMPK activator, and the increased VEGF with metformin treatment in our study suggests that AMPK-induced VEGF
expression might be an important mediator of angiogenesis that then
contributes to functional recovery (Stahmann et al., 2010). Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest that AMPK signaling is essential for
the pro-angiogenic effects of metformin and that contributes to
reduced atrophy seen at 30 days seen in metformin-treated animals.
This was conﬁrmed by studies using AMPK KO mice, which
showed neither enhancement in angiogenesis nor a reduction in
chronic tissue atrophy after metformin treatment.
The correlation between angiogenesis and improved functional
outcome after ischemic stroke has been reported in both experimental and clinical stroke studies (Chopp et al., 2007; Font et al., 2010;

Ergul et al., 2012). In experimental stroke, angiogenesis occurred
transiently in the penumbra of the ischemic hemisphere, implying
that the new vessels may play an important role in the clearing debris after stroke (Manoonkitiwongsa et al., 2001). Interestingly, we
observed reduced glial scar formation in metformin-treated brains.
Glial scaring is associated with inhibition of angiogenesis (Rocamonde et al., 2012). In parallel, we observed an increased number
of reactive astrocytes that were identiﬁed by their size and upregulation of GFAP immunoreactivity, The reduction in the glial scar may
possibly contribute to enhanced tissue-remodeling processes (Rocamonde et al., 2012). Consistent with our results, a very recent study
demonstrated that metformin treatment improved the level of vascularity by increasing non-perfused vessel islands in diabetic rats
(Prakash et al., 2013). This study showed that a signiﬁcant increase
in angiogenesis in metformin-treated groups paralleled improved
glucose control (Prakash et al., 2013). However, it is unclear if the
effects of metformin are simply secondary to an improvement in
blood glucose control, and the maintenance of blood glucose by
metformin can be achieved independently of activation of AMPK
(Viollet et al., 2012). Therefore, we examined the possible mechanistic role of AMPK in metformin-induced recovery in AMPK KO
mice. Our ﬁndings suggest that the behavioral recovery and angiogenic effects of chronic metformin treatment required AMPK, as
these effects were absent in AMPK KO mice.
Collectively, our data show that delayed chronic metformin treatment improved post-stroke functional recovery in mice by enhancing
angiogenesis after stroke and restoring dopaminergic tone. This
effect appears to be mediated by AMPK signaling. Our ﬁndings
suggest that chronic metformin treatment improves recovery after
focal ischemia in non-diabetic mice and the effect is mediated by
AMPK. Therefore, enhancing angiogenesis by metformin may have
future translational potential even in patients without diabetes by
promoting functional recovery in stroke survivors.
