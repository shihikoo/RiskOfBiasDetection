N-METHYL-D-ASPARTATE SUBTYPE of glutamate receptor
(NMDAR) serves critical roles in physiological and pathological processes in the central nervous system (CNS) (7, 9, 17,
20). The receptor activity regulates fast excitatory neurotransmission, contributes to the regulation of neuronal gene expression, and plays key roles in the formation of neural networks
and the formation of long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory
(18). NMDAR is composed of proteins derived from the
GluR1 (NR1) family and the GluN2 (NR2) family of genes.
The GluN1 family has a variety of splice variants, and the
GluN2 family is comprised of four subunit classes, GluN2A,
GluN2B, GluN2C, and GluN2D. The gene expression of both
families shows temporal and spatial distributions in the brain
(13, 15, 22). NMDAR may also contain an inhibitory subunit,
GluN3A (NR3A, NMDAR-L, or chi-1) and GluN3B (NR3B)
(2, 6, 19, 26). Incorporation of GluN3A with GluN1/GluN2
subunits suppresses NMDAR activity. For example, coexpression of GluN3A results in decreased NMDAR single channel
conductance, Ca2⫹ permeability, and the receptor Mg2⫹ sen-

sitivity, which may limit synaptic strengthening and stabilization (3, 6, 8, 25, 26). On the other hand, genetic knockout (KO)
of GluN3A in mice results in enhanced NMDA currents and
increased dendritic spines in early postnatal cerebrocortical
neurons compared with wild-type (WT) mice (8). In addition,
increases of intracellular Ca2⫹ concentration in the neuronal
cells from GluN3A KO mice contribute to cell death (3, 5, 14).
It is well known that GluN3A is a developmentally regulated
NMDAR subunit. GluN3A mRNA and protein levels peak at
the end of the first postnatal week but decrease to a low level
by adulthood (6, 26). Based on these findings, studies on
GluN3A have been almost exclusively focused on the developing brain of neonates (26, 30). In a hypoxic-ischemic stroke
model of neonatal mice, deletion of GluN3A caused enlarged
infarct formation while overexpression of GluN3A decreased
the brain damage (24). On the other hand, the significance of
endogenous GluN3A in the adult brain has been largely ignored, most likely due to the fact that the GluN3A level is
downregulated in the adult brain and due to the assumption that
the low level GluN3A has no or little functional role. The
pathological role of GluN3A in the adult brain, ironically, has
never been directly tested, and no quantified experimental data
from adult animals have been reported before.
We recently demonstrated that even though the GluN3A
expression level declines to lower levels from the neonatal
period to the adulthood, significant protein levels of GluN3A
are still detectable in the adult brain (21). An important role of
GluN3A in locomotion, pain perception, and cognitive functions was observed in adult animals (21). The results indicate
that even if at relatively lower expression level, GluN3A still
can act as an imperative player in the adult brain. In the present
investigation, we extended the examination into the pathological condition of ischemic stroke and tested the hypothesis that
a role of GluN3A in the adult stroke brain might have been
overlooked before. We also hypothesized that a neuroprotective role of GluN3A in the adult brain could indicate a receptor
subunit target for the development of therapeutic treatment of
stroke.
METHODS

Animals. NMDA receptor GluN3A (NR3A) constitutive KO mice
(kindly provided by Dr. Stuart A. Lipton and Dr. Nobuki Nakanishi at
Stanford University) and littermate WT mice at different postnatal
days were used in the experiments. The animals were maintained at a
constant temperature of 21°C with a 12-h light-dark cycle in the
Laboratory Animal Center for Research, Medicine School of Emory
University. All experimental and surgical procedures were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Emory
University (Animal Protocol No. 208-2008). No human tissue or
sample was tested in this study.

Lee JH, Wei ZZ, Chen D, Gu X, Wei L, Yu SP. A neuroprotective role
of the NMDA receptor subunit GluN3A (NR3A) in ischemic stroke of the
adult mouse. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 308: C570–C577, 2015. First
published February 4, 2015; doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00353.2014.—GluN3A or
NR3A is a developmentally regulated N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor
(NMDAR) subunit, showing a unique inhibitory role that decreases
NMDAR current and the receptor-mediated Ca2⫹ influx. In the
neonatal brain, GluN3A is shown to associate with synaptic maturation and spine formation and plays a neuroprotective role. Its functional role in the adult brain, however, is largely unknown. We tested
the hypothesis that, disrespecting the relatively lower expression level
of GluN3A in the adult brain, this inhibitory NMDAR subunit shows
a protective action against ischemia-induced brain injury. In littermate
wild-type (WT) and GluN3A knockout (KO) mice, focal cerebral
ischemia was induced by permanent occlusion of right distal branches
of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) plus 10-min ligation of both
common carotid arteries (CCAs). Twenty-four hours after focal cerebral ischemia, the infarction volume assessed using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was significantly larger in
GluN3A KO mice compared with WT mice. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining demonstrated enhanced cell death in GluN3A KO mice. Moreover, the
deletion of GluN3A hindered sensorimotor functional recovery after
stroke. It is suggested that, although the expression level is relatively
lower in the adult brain, GluN3A is still a noteworthy regulator in
ischemia-induced excitotoxicity and brain injury.

NMDA toxicity and assessment of neuronal cell death. Excitotoxicity was induced by a 10-min exposure to NMDA (300 ␮M) alone or
in the presence of z-VAD-fmk (100 ␮M), carried out at room
temperature in a HEPES buffer solution (HBSS) containing the
following (in mM): 120 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.8 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 20
HEPES, 15 glucose, and 0.01 glycine (pH 7.4). The exposure solution
was then washed away and replaced by media stock (MS) supplemented with 10 ␮M glycine before returning cultures to the incubator
for 20 –24 h.
Neuronal cell death was estimated by examination of the cultures
under phase-contrast microscopy and quantitated by measurement of
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release by damaged cells into the
bathing medium 24 h following the experimentation (14). The LDH
level corresponding to near-complete neuron death (without glial
death) was determined by assaying sister cultures exposed to 300 ␮M
NMDA for 24 h in MS supplemented with glycine. The percent
neuronal death was normalized to the mean LDH value released 24 h
after a sham wash (defined as 0%) and continuous exposure to 300
␮M NMDA (defined as 100%). Background LDH levels were determined in sister cultures subjected to sham washing and subtracted
from experimental values to yield the signal specific to experimentally
induced injury.
Focal cerebral ischemia in mice. Focal cerebral ischemia, confined
to the sensorimotor cortex in the right middle cerebral artery (MCA)
territory of WT and GluN3A KO male mice, was induced by permanent occlusions of distal branches of the right MCA and temporary
(10 min) ligations of both common carotid arteries (CCAs) (29). In

Genotyping. The genotyping of GluN3A KO and WT animals was
performed as described previously (21). DNA for genotyping was
extracted from tail snips (⬃2– 4 mm). The separately primers were
5=-CCA CGG TGA GCT TGG GGA AG (NN494), 5=-GCC TGA
AGA ACG AGA TCA GC (NN506), and 5=-TTG GGG AGC GCC
CTG CAT GG (NN507; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The 251-bp
product (NN494 and NN506) confutes GluN3A KO mice and 200-bp
product (NN494 and NN507) confutes WT mice. DNA (2 ␮l) was
amplified on a thermocycler (MJ minim; Personal Thermal Cycler,
Bio-Rad, CA) for 40 cycles (95°C for 60 s, 58°C for 30 s, and 72°C
for 60 s). After additional incubation at 72°C for 10 min and being
transferred to 4°C, PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in
1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide. Relative intensity of PCR
bands was analyzed using the InGenius3 manual gel documentation
system (Syngene, Frederick, MD).
Neuronal cell cultures. The preparation of nearly pure cortical
neurons was previously described (31). Briefly, neurons were harvested from the cortex of gestational 14- to 16-day mouse embryos.
The pregnant mouse was killed using overdosed isoflurane, and brain
dissection was performed soon after heartbeat stopped and no response to pawn stimuli. The cortex was dissociated in trypsin and
plated on poly-D-lysine and laminin-coated tissue culture dishes. Cells
were maintained in neurobasal media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with
B27 supplement and L-glutamine until the time of the experiment.
Cytarabine (Ara-C) was added on the third day to prevent the
proliferation of glial cells. Mature neuronal cultures [12–14 days in
vitro (DIV)] were used for cell death assays.

incubated in 2% TTC solution at 37°C for 5 min, then stored in 10%
buffered formalin for 24 h. Digital images of the caudal aspect of each
slice were obtained by a flatbed scanner. Infarct, ipsilateral hemisphere, and contralateral hemisphere areas were measured using
ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethasda, MD). The
indirect method (subtraction of residual right hemisphere cortical
volume from cortical volume of the intact left hemisphere) will be
used for infarct volumes calculation. Infarct measurements were
performed under double-blind conditions.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was used to detect the
expression of NMDAR subunits. Brain cortical tissue was lysed in a
lysis buffer containing 0.02 M Na4P2O7, 10 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.4),
100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 1% Triton, 1 mM EGTA, 2
mM Na3VO4, and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). The
supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 15,000 g for 10 min
at 4°C. Protein concentration was determined with a bicinchoninic
acid assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Equivalent amounts
of total protein were separated by molecular weight on an SDSpolyacrylamide gradient gel and then transferred to a PVDF membrane. The blot was incubated in 5% bovine serum albumin for at least
1 h and then reacted with primary antibodies at 4°C for overnight. The
primary antibodies, and the dilutions for each, were as follows: rabbit
anti-GluN2A antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) at 1:2,000,
rabbit anti-GluN2B antibody (Cell Signaling) at 1:2,000, rabbit antiGluN3A antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) at 1:1,000, and mouse

brief, 8- to 10-wk-old male mice (25–28 g) were anesthetized by 4%
chloral hydrate (100 mg/kg ip). Chloral hydrate has been widely used
as a sedation agent in human and animal surgeries/procedures for a
number of years. It was chosen in this investigation due to its stable
and well-controlled anesthetic action and negligible effect on NMDA
receptors (4). The right MCA branches were permanently ligated
using a 10-0 suture (Surgical Specialties, Reading, PA) accompanied
by a bilateral 10-min ligation of CCAs. Body temperature was
monitored during surgery and maintained at 37.0 ⫾ 0.3°C using a
temperature control unit and heating pads. The mortality rate due to
ischemic surgery and/or anesthesia failure was ⬃7% in these experiments. Free access to food and water was allowed after recovery from
anesthesia. All mice were kept in air-ventilated cages with room
temperature maintained at 24 ⫾ 0.5°C. Animals were euthanized and
decapitated at different time points after ischemic stroke. Brains were
immediately removed, mounted in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA), and stored at ⫺80°C for
further processing.
2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining of infarct volume
measurement. Twenty-four hours after onset of middle cerebral artery
occlusion, animals in different groups were killed for assessment of
brain infarct formation. 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC;
Sigma-Aldrich) staining was used to reveal damaged/dead brain tissue
as previously described (29). Brains were removed, placed in a brain
matrix, and then sliced into 1-mm coronal sections. Slices were

in the analysis. In this behavioral study, 16 animals were randomly
assigned to WT and GluN3A KO groups before ischemia and 3 days
after ischemia. At 7 days after stroke, six animals were used in each
group. All testing trials were conducted during the day time.
Locomotor activity test. Behavioral changes of experimental mice
were monitored and analyzed using the TopScan System (Clever Sys,
Reston, VA). Mice were allowed to freely move in an open field
container (50 ⫻ 50 ⫻ 50 cm). For locomotor activity, travelled
distance and velocity were recorded for 1 h before surgery and at 3
and 7 days after focal cerebral ischemia. After the recording, the
videos were analyzed by the TopScan Realtime Option Version 3.0
(Clever Sys).
Cylinder test. A unilateral injury to the motor cortex results in an
asymmetry in the forelimb used for support the body during rearing,
which can be measured using the cylinder test. The mice were placed
in a glass cylinder (9.5-cm diameter and 11-cm height), and the
number of times each forelimb or both forelimbs were used to support
the body on the wall of the cylinder was counted for 5 min. The
animals were evaluated before surgery and at 3 and 7 days after focal
cerebral ischemia. Two mirrors were placed behind the cylinder to
view all directions. The numbers of impaired and nonimpaired forelimb contacts were calculated as a percentage of total contacts.
Statistical analysis. All results are expressed as means ⫾ SE.

anti-␤-actin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1:5,000. After being washed with
Tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBST), membranes were incubated
with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) for 1–2
h at room temperature. After a final washing with TBST, the signals
were detected with bromochloroidolylphosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium
(BCIP/NBP) solution (Sigma-Aldrich) or film. Signal intensity was
measured by ImageJ and normalized to the actin signal intensity.
Immunohistochemical assessment. Frozen brain tissues were sliced
into 10-␮m-thick coronal sections using a cryostat vibratome (Leica
CM 1950; Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Sections were
dried on the slide warmer for 30 min, fixed with 10% formalin buffer,
washed with ⫺20°C precooled ethanol:acetic acid (2:1) solution for
10 min, and finally permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X 100 solution for
5 min. All slides were washed three times with PBS (5 min each) after
each step. Then, tissue sections were blocked with 1% fish gelatin
(Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently
incubated with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4°C:
mouse anti-GluN1 antibody (1:200; Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY), rabbit anti-GluN2A antibody (1:200; Abcam), rabbit antiGluN2B (1:200; Abcam), rabbit anti-GluN3A (1:200; Abcam), and
mouse anti-NeuN (1:400; Millipore, Billerica, MA). The next day, the
slides were washed three times with PBS for 5 min, then reacted with
the secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor488 goat anti-mouse or -rabbit
(1:300; Life Technologies) and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit
(1:300; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) or
Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or -rabbit (1:400; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 80 min at room temperature. After three
washes with PBS, nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (1:20,000;
Life Technologies) for 5 min as a counterstain. Then, the brain
sections were mounted, coverslipped, imaged, and photographed under a fluorescent microscope (BX51; Olympus) and laser scanning
confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NY).
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling
staining and positive cell quantification. A terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay kit was used to
examine cell death by detecting fragmented DNA in 10-␮m-thick
coronal fresh frozen sections as described previously (n ⫽ 8 per
group) (16). After fixation [10% buffered formalin for 10 min and
then ethanol:acetic acid (2:1) solution for 5 min] and permeabilization
(0.2% Triton X-100 solution), brain sections were incubated in the
equilibration buffer for 10 min. A recombinant terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (rTdT) and nucleotide mixture was then added on the
slide at 37°C for 60 min in the dark. Reactions were terminated by 2⫻
SSC solution for 15 min. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst
33342 (1:20,000; Molecular Probes) for 5 min.
Cell counting. Cell counting was performed following the principles of design-based stereology (16). Systematic random sampling
was employed to ensure accurate and nonredundant cell count. Every
section under analysis was at least 90 ␮m apart from the next. Three
10-␮m thick sections spanning the entire region of interest were
selected for cell quantification. Counting was performed on five to
eight nonoverlapping randomly selected 20⫻ fields per section in the
specified region of the cortex. ImageJ (National Institutes of Health)
was used to analyze each picture. All analysis was performed in a
double-blinded fashion.
Adhesive removal test. The adhesive removal test measures sensorimotor function as previously described (1, 10). Briefly, a small
adhesive dot was placed on each forepaw, and the amount of time
(seconds) needed to contact and remove the tape from each forepaw
was recorded. Mice were trained three times for 3 days (1–2 trials per
day) before ischemia induction to ensure that they were able to
remove the tape within 12 s to get a basal level of performance. Mice
that show no response or prolonged time to remove the tape (⬎20 s)
during training period were excluded from future experiments. Animals were tested before ischemia and 3 and 7 days after ischemia by
an investigator who was blind to the experimental groups. The test

GluN3A expression patterns and cellular distribution in the
mouse brain. To characterize the expression of GluN3A, we
measured the expression level of GluN3A at postnatal day
(P)5, 15, 30, and 70 in WT mice using Western blot analysis.
As reported before, the highest level of GluN3A was observed
in the P5 brain and the GluN3A expression was then declined
to lower levels in the following days (Fig. 1, A and B).
However, even if the GluN3A level was relatively lower in the
adult brain (P30 –P70) than that in the neonatal brain (P5–P15),
the GluN3A expression was readily detectable. In WT and
GluN3A KO brains, Western blotting confirmed that this
NMDAR subunit was largely eliminated or undetectable in the
KO brain tissues (Fig. 1D). Immunohistochemical analysis
revealed that GluN3A was observed in the neuron of cortex
including sensorimotor cortex from WT adult brain (Fig. 1C).
We and others showed before that deletion of GluN3A does
not affect the expression levels of GluN1 and GluN2 (21,

24). Since GluN2 subunits especially GluN2B are specifically linked to excitotoxicity (27), we measured the GluN2A
and GluN2B protein levels in the adult WT and GluN3A KO
brains and the expression in cortical neurons. There was no
change in GluN2A and GluN2B levels in the absence of
GluN3A (Fig. 1, D and E). Also, the number of GluN2Bpositive cells did not show any difference between WT and
GluN3A KO mice (Fig. 1F).
Using immunocytochemical staining, we specifically examined the cellular distribution of GluN3A in cultured cortical
neurons. It was clear that GluN3A localized to the cell membrane and dendrites (Fig. 2, A–C). Moreover, they were colocalized with the GluN1 subunit, suggesting formation of functional NMDARs in these locations (Fig. 2D).
Neuroprotective effects of GluN3A expression against in
vitro ischemic insult in cortical cultures. We next examined
NMDA-induced neuronal cell death in cortical neuronal cultures of 12–14 DIV. The neuronal culture was exposed to 300
␮M NMDA for 10 min and washed out with normal culture
media. This short-term NMDA insult caused marked cell death
24 h later. The neuronal cell death showed apoptotic features
such as cell body shrinkage and sensitivity to the block by the

Effect of GluN3A on functional recovery after focal cerebral
ischemia. Several behavior tests measured the functional outcomes after focal cerebral ischemia. In the adhesive dot removal test, the latency times to contact and remove the sticky
dot from the right and left forelimbs were recorded at 3 and 7
days after focal cerebral ischemia (Fig. 5, A and B). Before
ischemic insult, the contact and removal times were similar
between WT and GluN3A KO mice. After focal cerebral
ischemia, animals showed prolonged times in response to the
sticky dot attached to their left paws due to impaired sensorimotor function on the right side of the sensorimotor cortical
area. GluN3A KO mice showed significantly hindered performance at 3 days after ischemia on both time to contact and time
to remove sticky dot activities (Fig. 5, A and B). TopScan
system analysis was used to measure the locomotor activity
after focal cerebral ischemia. GluN3A KO mice showed significantly less travelled distance and lower velocity than WT
mice at 3 days after focal cerebral ischemia (Fig. 5, C and D).
Consistently, GluN3A KO mice showed significant worse
performance in cylinder test at 3 days after focal cerebral
ischemia (Fig. 5E).

Fig. 5. GluN3 KO mice hindered functional recovery after focal cerebral ischemia. The adhesive removal test was performed to examine the effect of
GluN3A on functional recovery before surgery and
at 3 and 7 days after focal cerebral ischemia. A: all
animals showed increased time to contact after focal

caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 3, A and B). Compared
with WT neurons, GluN3A KO neurons showed enhanced
vulnerability to the NMDA insult; there was significant more
neuronal death in GluN3A KO cultures (Fig. 3B).
Neuroprotective effects of GluN3A expression against ischemic damage in the adult brain. The focal cerebral ischemia in
our experiments selectively damaged the somatosensory cortex
of adult mice. Twenty four hours after the ischemic insult,
brain sections were stained with TTC solution to identify the
damaged/died brain tissue (Fig. 4A). The infarction volume of
the cerebral cortex in GluN3A KO mice was significantly
larger than that in WT mice (Fig. 4B). Using Western blotting,
we compared the levels of GluN3A before and after ischemia
in WT mice and did not observe significant change (data not
shown).
To confirm the difference in the ischemia-induced injury
between the two groups at cellular levels, TUNEL staining
was applied to evaluate the cell death in the penumbra
region 24 h after focal cerebral ischemia. The number of
dead/injured cells measured as TUNEL-positive cells was
noticeably higher in GluN3A brain than that in WT stroke
mice (Fig. 4, C and D).

This investigation reveals that, even at a relatively lower
level than in the neonatal brain, the NMDAR inhibitory subunit
GluN3A in the adult brain exhibits a neuroprotective effect in
ischemic stroke. We demonstrate that deletion of this subunit
results in enlarged infarct volume and increased cell death in
the ischemic cortex of the adult mouse brain. Also, GluN3A
KO mice exhibited hindered functional recovery compared
with WT mice. These observations, on one hand, are surprising
based on the common belief that GluN3A has little, if any,
functional role in the adult brain due to its low expression level
(26, 30). On the other hand, the result is consistent with our
previous investigation showing that GluN3A plays an imperative role in pain perception, locomotion, and cognitive function in adult mice (21). Taking together, it is suggested that
although the expression level of GluN3A in the adult brain is
downregulated from its peak level at the neonatal stage, this
subunit in the adult brain still has a significant impact on
multiple brain activities under physiological and pathological
conditions such as in ischemic stroke. We noticed that the
difference in the infarct volume between WT and GluN3A KO
mice is relative moderate, which is consistent with the low
level of GluN3A in the adult brain. The present investigation,
however, is not an investigation of stroke treatment, which is
largely judged by how big the protective effect is. Instead, we
aimed to reveal whether GluN3A could play a functional role
in cerebral ischemia of the adult brain. The observation provides important information for a previously unidentified function of the GluN3A subunit after ischemic stroke in adults. It is
expected that genetic manipulations and other strategies of
increasing the GluN3A level in the adult brain can amplify the
endogenous defense mechanism against ischemic stroke.
A neuroprotective role of the GluN3A subunit was demonstrated in an earlier investigation in cortical cultures subjected
to excitotoxic insults and in a neonatal hypoxia-ischemia
model of mice (24). It was mentioned in the abstract of the
report that a neuroprotective effect against ischemic stroke was
only observed in neonatal but not in adult GluN3A KO mice
(24). Unfortunately, no experimental data on the adult stroke
experiment were presented in the report (24). On the other
hand, the authors did show a neuroprotective effect of the
GluN3A subunit in adult animals subjected to NMDA-induced
retina injury and in the GluN3A-overexpressing transgenic
mice after transient ischemic stroke (24). The protective effect
of overexpressing GluN3A was also shown in a recent study on
cultured hippocampal neuronal cell death induced by oxygen
glucose deprivation (28). We show in adult animals that the
basal level of this subunit already shows a moderate neuroprotection, supporting that increasing the GluN3A level can be an
effective therapeutic target for the treatment of stroke.
Recent studies raise an intriguing possibility that NMDAR
hypofunction in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may arise
from an excess increase or decrease of GluN3A expression.
GluN3A mRNA levels are significantly elevated in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic patients and decreased in that of bipolar disorder patients (23). Altered
GluN3A expression levels regulate the development of spine
densities in schizophrenic patients (11, 12). Taken together,
these findings suggest that GluN3A expression can be an
important regulator on the development of schizophrenia and

bipolar disorder and a key target gene for treating the patients
with psychotic disorders.
In conclusion, the present study shows a NMDAR subunitmediated endogenous neuroprotective action after focal cerebral ischemia in the adult brain. Together with the previous
reports of the GluN3A regulation on pain sensation, cognitive
activities, locomotion, and retina excitotoxicity in adult animals (21, 24), the expression of GluN3A thus shows significant
physiological and pathophysiological roles in adults. In this
study, we used conventional GluN3A KO mice. It is possible
that the loss of GluN3A activity during the development stage
may mask and change the role of the gene in the adult stage.
Therefore, further studies using conditional KO approach may
be needed to provide more inside information on the developmentally regulated neuroprotective mechanism.
