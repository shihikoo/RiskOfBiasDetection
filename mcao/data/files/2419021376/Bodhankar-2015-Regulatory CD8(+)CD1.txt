Abstract Clinical stroke induces inflammatory processes
leading to cerebral and splenic injury and profound
peripheral immunosuppression. IL-10 expression is elevated during major CNS diseases and limits inflammation in the brain. Recent evidence demonstrated that
transfer of IL-10+ B-cells reduced infarct volume in
male C57BL/6J (wild-type, WT) recipient mice when
given 24 h prior to or 4 h after middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO). The purpose of this study was to
determine if passively transferred IL-10+ B-cells can
exert therapeutic and immunoregulatory effects when
injected 24 h after MCAO induction in B-cellsufficient male WT mice. The results demonstrated that
IL-10+ B-cell treated mice had significantly reduced
infarct volumes in the ipsilateral cortex and hemisphere
and improved neurological deficits vs. Vehicle-treated

control mice after 60 min occlusion and 96 h of reperfusion. The MCAO-protected B-cell recipient mice had
less splenic atrophy and reduced numbers of activated,
inflammatory T-cells, decreased infiltration of T-cells
and a less inflammatory milieu in the ischemic hemispheres compared with Vehicle-treated control mice.
These immunoregulatory changes occurred in concert
with the predominant appearance of IL-10-secreting
CD8+CD122+ Treg cells in both the spleen and the
MCAO-affected brain hemisphere. This study for the
first time demonstrates a major neuroprotective role for
IL-10+ B-cells in treating MCAO in male WT mice at a
time point well beyond the ~4 h tPA treatment window,
leading to the generation of a dominant IL10+CD8+CD122+ Treg population associated with spleen
preservation and reduced CNS inflammation.

Introduction
Stroke still remains the fourth leading cause of death and one
of the major causes of disability in the United States (Minino
et al. 2011). Although treatment with recombinant tPA is the
only approved therapy for acute stroke, less than 5 % of the
stroke patients benefit from this intervention (Fang et al. 2010)
due to a very limited therapeutic window and a probable risk
of hemorrhagic transformation. It is therefore paramount to
understand the endogenous mechanisms that are activated in
response to acute stroke, so that novel therapies that take
advantage of this understanding can be developed for the
treatment of this devastating condition. Inflammation plays a
critical role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke and other
forms of ischemic brain injuries. Key features of this
neuroinflammatory reaction are the invasion of peripheral
immune cells across the damaged blood–brain barrier, the
activation of resident innate immune cells (microglia) and
the production of inflammatory humoral mediators such as
cytokines and chemokines (Iadecola and Anrather 2011).
Various immunotherapeutic strategies have been tested for
dampening the secondary inflammatory reaction after brain
injury in order to improve stroke outcome. Besides blocking
the cellular immune infiltration to the ischemic, damaged
brain (Becker et al. 2001; Liesz et al. 2011; Zhou et al.
2013), exploiting endogenous regulatory and immunosuppressive pathways has been intensively investigated (Iadecola
and Anrather 2011; Li et al. 2013; Liesz et al. 2013). However,
attempts to translate these approaches into clinical practice
will benefit from a better understanding of the complexities of
molecular mechanisms responsible for these immune
responses.
Interleukin (IL)-10 is one of the key anti-inflammatory
cytokines produced by the various regulatory immune subpopulations, including B- and T-cells and monocytes/microglia. The neuroprotective properties of IL-10 administration in
experimental stroke models have already been demonstrated
(Spera et al. 1998; Strle et al. 2001). However, little is known
about the cellular source and kinetics of IL-10 production after
induction of ischemic stroke. Recent experimental data demonstrate the complexities of modulating the immune response
after stroke and suggest that immune cells can have both
beneficial and detrimental effects. Given that the experimental
model influences the time course and number of infiltrating
immune cells as well as the degree of microglial activation
(Zhou et al. 2013), it becomes paramount to know the timing
and duration of interventions aimed at modulating inflammation. Hence, one of the rapidly evolving areas of stroke research involves defining the molecular and cellular bases for
the augmented tissue injury and inflammation associated with
transient cerebral ischemia.
Our laboratory has been actively investigating these postischemic inflammatory mechanisms and the interaction of

Metab Brain Dis (2015) 30:911–924

activated immune cells with ischemic brain tissue. Notably,
we have demonstrated that B-cells are critical for governing
infarct size and that MCAO-induced changes can be
prevented in B-cell-deficient (μMT−/−) mice after transfer of
highly purified IL-10+ B-cells, but not IL-10-deficient B-cells.
These studies clearly implicated IL-10-secreting B-cells as a
major regulatory cell type in ischemic stroke (Offner and Hurn
2012; Ren et al. 2011). The critical role played by IL-10+ Bcells was confirmed with the demonstration that B-celldeficient mice replenished with IL-10-rich B-cells 24 h prior
to MCAO had a significant decrease in infarct volumes
(Bodhankar et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2012). The transferred
IL-10+ B-cells also mitigated pro-inflammatory responses
both in the brain and the periphery. Moreover, our most recent
study demonstrated the immunoregulatory role of IL-10enriched B-cells in reducing the infarct size in B-cell-sufficient
mice. IL-10-rich B-cells were efficient in limiting infarct
volumes when given prophylactically (24 h before) or therapeutically (4 h after) MCAO-induction (Bodhankar et al.
2014). The primary purpose of the present study was to
determine whether IL-10-rich B-cells can still elicit immunoregulation upon treating B-cell-sufficient mice at a more amenable, therapeutically relevant time-point as late as 24 h after
the induction of MCAO. Our results very clearly demonstrate
that treatment with IL-10+ B-cells significantly reduces infarct
volume and partially reverses splenic atrophy when administered 24 h after the onset of stroke. The protection provided
could be attributed largely to the dominant changes in the
CD8+CD122+ regulatory T (Treg) populations in male WT
mice treated with IL-10+ B-cells compared to Vehicle, leading
to a decreased pro-inflammatory milieu both in the periphery
and the MCAO-affected hemisphere of the brain. Our studies
are the first to demonstrate a major immunoregulatory role for
IL-10+ B-cells in rendering protection in male WT mice as late
as 24 h post-stroke and in generating another highly potent
regulatory subset (CD8+CD122+ Treg cells), which in turn
appears to play a dominant role in attenuating proinflammatory reactions generated upon reperfusion-based cerebral injury.

Materials and methods
Animals
Male C57BL/6J (wild-type, WT) mice 8 to 12 weeks of age
(Jackson Laboratory, Sacramento, CA, USA) and weighing
20 to 25 g were used as recipients for adoptive transfers and
induction of transient focal cerebral ischemia. All WT mice
were housed at the Oregon Health and Science University.
Male IL10-GFP reporter mice (on a C57BL/6J background)
were used at 8 to 10 weeks of age as donors for adoptive
transfers. These mice were bred and housed in the Animal

Metab Brain Dis (2015) 30:911–924

913

Resource Facility at the Portland Veterans Affairs Medical
Center in accordance with institutional guidelines. The IL10GFP reporter mice have a floxed neomycin-IRES eGFP cassette (Madan et al. 2009) inserted between the endogenous
stop site and the poly (A) site of the Il10 gene to help track IL10 producing cells in vivo. The mice, designated as Vert-X,
are homozygous, develop normally and are viable and fertile
without any obvious phenotype. All experimental protocols
were approved by Oregon Health and Science University and
Portland Veteran Affairs Medical Center Animal Care and Use
Committees.

occlusion was initiated, the incision was closed with 6–0
surgical sutures (ETHICON, Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA).
Each mouse was then awakened during occlusion and placed
in a separate cage with a warm water pad and heating lamp. At
the end of the 1 h ischemic period, mice were briefly reanesthetized with isoflurane, the LDF probe was repositioned
over the same site on the skull, the occluding filament was
withdrawn for reperfusion and the incision was closed with 6–
0 surgical sutures (ETHICON, Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA).
Each mouse was then awakened and recovered in a separate
cage with a warm water pad.

Cell sorting and adoptive transfer of B-cells

Neurological deficit scores

Male IL-10-GFP reporter mice served as donors of B-cells.
Splenic CD19+ B-cells were purified using paramagnetic
bead-conjugated antibodies (Abs) from the CD19 cell isolation kit and subsequently separated by AutoMACS (Miltenyi
Biotec, Auburn, CA). The negative fraction of the cells thus
separated were CD19+ B-cells with a purity of≥92 %. CD19+
B-cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium with 2 % Fetal
Bovine Serum (FBS) and cultured in the presence of 1 μg/mL
lipopolysaccharide (LPS, E. coli strain K12). After 48 h of
culture, B-cells were harvested from culture plates, washed
free of LPS and viable cells were counted using a hemocytometer with the trypan blue exclusion method. Five million
purified IL-10-GFP+ B-cells from the donor mice were
suspended in 100 μL RPMI 1640 medium and were transferred intravenously (i.v.) via tail vein injection into recipient
WT mice (experimental group) 24 h after MCAO while the
Vehicle control group received 100 μL RPMI 1640 medium.

Neurological deficit scores were determined at 1, 24, 48, 72,
and 96 h of reperfusion to confirm ischemia and the presence
of ischemic injury using a 0 to 4 point scale as follows: 0, no
neurological dysfunction; 1, failure to extend left forelimb
fully when lifted by tail; 2, circling to the contralateral side;
3, falling to the left; and 4, no spontaneous movement or in a
comatose state (Chen et al. 2012). Any animal without a
deficit at 1 h of reperfusion was excluded from the study.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model
Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in male WT
mice for 1 h by reversible right MCAO under isoflurane
anesthesia followed by 96 h of reperfusion as previously
described (Bodhankar et al. 2014). The individual performing
all MCAO surgeries was blinded to treatment group. Head and
body temperature were controlled at 36.5±1.0 °C during
surgery, MCAO and early reperfusion with warm water pads
and a heating lamp. Occlusion and reperfusion were verified
in each mouse by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) (Model
DRT4, Moor Instruments, Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA). Occlusion was achieved by introducing a 6–0 nylon monofilament (ETHICON, Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA) with a siliconecoated (Xantopren comfort light, Heraeus, Germany) tip
through an external carotid artery stump distal to the internal
carotid artery to the origin of the middle cerebral artery.
Adequacy of MCAO was confirmed by monitoring cortical
blood flow at the onset of the occlusion with an LDF probe
affixed to the skull. Animals were excluded if intra-ischemic
LDF was greater than 25 % pre-ischemic baseline. After

Infarct volume analysis
Individual performing infarct volume analysis was blinded to
treatment group. Mice were euthanized and brains collected at
96 h of reperfusion for 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
histology and then digital image analysis of infarct volume
as previously described (Chen et al. 2012). Images were
analyzed using Sigma Scan Pro 5.0 Software (Systat, Inc.,
Point Richmond, CA). To control for edema, regional infarct
volume (cortex, striatum, and hemisphere) was determined by
subtraction of the ipsilateral non-infarcted regional volume
from the contralateral regional volume. This value was then
divided by the contralateral regional volume and multiplied by
100 to yield regional infarct volume as a percent of the
contralateral region.
Isolation of leukocytes from spleen and brain
Spleens from individual control and B-cell recipient WT mice
were removed and a single-cell suspension was prepared by
passing the tissue through a 100 μm nylon mesh (BD Falcon,
Bedford, MA). The cells were washed using RPMI 1640. Red
cells were lysed using ×x red cell lysis buffer (eBioscience,
Inc., San Diego, CA) and incubated for 3 min. Cells were then
washed twice with RPMI 1640, counted and resuspended in
stimulation medium (RPMI containing 10 % FBS, 1 % sodium pyruvate, 1 % L-glutamine and 0.4 % βMercaptoethanol). The brain was divided into the ischemic
(right) and nonischemic (left) hemispheres, dissociated mechanically through a 100 μm nylon mesh screen, resuspended

914

in 80 % Percoll (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) overlaid with
40 % Percoll and subjected to density gradient centrifugation
for 30 min at 1600 rpm, according to a method described
previously (Campanella et al. 2002). Inflammatory cells were
removed from the interphase for further analysis. Cells were
then washed twice with RPMI 1640, counted and resuspended
in stimulation medium. Cells from individual brain hemispheres were evaluated by flow cytometry.
Analysis of cell populations by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS)
All antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences (San
Jose, CA) or eBioscience, Inc. (San Diego, CA) as published
(Offner et al. 2006b, c). Four-color (FITC, PE, APC and PI/
PerCP/PECy7) fluorescence flow cytometry analyses were
performed to determine the phenotypes of splenocytes and
brain leukocytes as previously published (Offner et al. 2006a).
Single-cell suspensions were washed with staining medium
(PBS containing 0.1 % NaN3 and 0.5 % bovine serum albumin, Sigma, Illinois) and incubated with combinations of the
following monoclonal antibodies: CD4 (GK1.5, BD
Pharmingen), CD8a (53–6.7, BD Pharmingen), CD11b (M1/
70, eBioscience), CD45 (Ly-5, BD Pharmingen), CD19 (1D3,
BD Pharmingen), CD1d (1B1, BD Pharmingen), CD122
(TM-β1 BD Pharmingen), MHCII (2G9, BD Pharmingen),
CD69 (H1.2 F3, BD Pharmingen) for 10 min at 4 °C. One mL
of staining buffer was added to wash the cells. Propidium
iodide (PI) was added to identify dead cells whenever only 3
channels on the FACSCalibur were used for detection of
fluorescent antibody staining. The FoxP3 staining kit was
used according to the manufacturer’s protocol (eBioscience)
as previously described (Zhang et al. 2010). FACS data acquisition was performed on FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and data were analyzed using FCS
express software (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, CA).

(all reagents from Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h. Fc receptors were
blocked with anti-FcR mAb (2.3G2; BD PharMingen) before
cell-surface staining and fixed and permeabilized with the
Fixation/Permeabilization buffer (eBioscience) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Permeabilized cells were
washed with 1× Permeabilization Buffer (eBioscience) and
were stained with tumor necrosis factor-α (MP6-XT22, BD
Pharmingen), IL-17A (TC11-18H10, BD Pharmingen),
Interferon-γ (XMG1.2, eBioscience) and/or APC-conjugated
anti-IL-10 mAb (JES5-16E3, eBioscience). Isotype matched
mAb served as negative controls to demonstrate specificity
and to establish background TNF-α, IL-17, IFN-γ and IL-10staining levels.
RNA isolation and reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction
Total RNA was isolated from brains of control and IL-10+ Bcell recipient WT mice using the RNeasy mini kit protocol
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and converted into cDNA using
oligo-dT, random hexamers and Superscript RT II (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY, USA). Quantitative real time PCR was
performed using TaqMan Gene Expression Array FAST
plates for mouse immune response on a StepOnePlus Real
Time PCR System. cDNA from mice from each group (control vs. treated) was pooled for the gene array analysis.
GAPDH housekeeping gene was used as an endogenous
control. Fold change in the expression of genes was calculated
using the formula 2-ΔΔCt. Reverse transcription-PCR was
performed using TaqMan PCR master mix and pre-designed
Taqman primers for IL-4, IL-10, CXCL10 (IP-10), CXCR3,
ICAM-1, IL-33 and MMP-9 primers (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). mRNA was quantified in reactions
conducted on the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) and data represented as relative
units compared with the GAPDH reference gene.

Intracellular staining
Statistical analysis
Intracellular staining was visualized using a published immunofluorescence protocol (Subramanian et al. 2011). Briefly,
2× 106 cells/mL were resuspended in complete medium
(RPMI 1640 containing 10 % fetal calf serum, 1 mM/L
pyruvate, 200 μg/mL penicillin, 200 U/mL streptomycin,
4 mM/L L-glutamine, and 5 × 10−5 mol/L 2-βmercaptoethanol) with PMA (50 ng/mL), ionomycin
(500 ng/mL), and Brefeldin A (10 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich)
for 4 h. For intracellular IL-10 detection, a modification was
followed for the immunofluorescence staining protocol
(Yanaba et al. 2008). Briefly, isolated leukocytes or purified
cells were resuspended (2×106 cells/mL) in complete medium
and cultured with LPS (10 μg/mL) in addition to PMA (50 ng/
mL), ionomycin (500 ng/mL), and Brefeldin A (10 μg/mL)

Infarct volume data are presented as mean±SEM. Differences
in regional infarct volumes were determined with Student’s ttest. Functional outcomes for neurological deficit scores were
analyzed by Mann Whitney Rank Sum test. Statistical significance was p<0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism version 6.00 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla,
CA). Statistical significance for the differences between percentages of cellular subtypes by FACS analysis for
splenocytes was analyzed with Student’s t-test. Statistical
significance for data obtained by FACS analysis for brain
leukocytes was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by a post hoc Tukey’s test. The criterion
for statistical significance was p≤0.05. All values are reported

Mortality and exclusions

Results
Adoptive transfer of IL-10+ B-cells, 24 h after MCAO,
reduces infarct volume in male WT mice
As shown in Fig. 1a, WT mice that received IL-10+ B-cells
(n=11) 24 h after MCAO exhibited significantly reduced
cortical (p=0.025) and total hemisphere (p=0.043) infarct
volumes after 1 h MCAO followed by 96 h of reperfusion
compared to no-cell transferred Vehicle (RPMI) controls (n=
11). No differences were seen in striatal (p=0.753) infarct
volumes between mice that received IL-10+ B-cells (n=11)
24 h after MCAO compared to Vehicle (RPMI)-treated controls (n=11). Representative cerebral sections from WT mice
treated with RPMI or IL-10+ B-cells are shown in Fig. 1b.

Overall mortality from MCAO for infarct volume and immunology studies was 12 mice out of a total of 71 mice, with
mortality ranging from 4 to 8 mice within the experimental
groups. Overall number of mice excluded due to intraischemic LDF greater than 25 % pre-ischemic baseline was
1 mouse out of a total of 71 mice, with exclusions ranging
from 0 to 1 mouse within the experimental groups.
Treatment with IL-10+ B-cells, 24 h after the induction
of MCAO, ameliorates splenic atrophy

Median neurological deficit scores evaluated for mice in both
the infarct and immunology treatment groups 96 h after
MCAO showed a significant improvement (p=0.0235) in
mice receiving adoptively transferred IL-10 + B-cells
(n=30) vs. Vehicle controls (n=28) treated 24 h after

Our lab has repeatedly established the phenomenon of strokeinduced splenic atrophy (Offner et al. 2006a), a process that
could be partially prevented by transfer of IL-10+ B-cells 24 h
before MCAO (Bodhankar et al. 2013, 2014). The question
was whether splenic atrophy could also be impacted by treatment of mice with IL-10+ B-cells given 24 h after MCAO. As
expected and previously demonstrated (Bodhankar et al.
2013; Offner et al. 2006b), MCAO resulted in large reductions
in spleen cell numbers in Vehicle-treated mice. The spleen
counts in mice receiving Vehicle averaged ~20 million cells
after 1 h of MCAO and 96 h of reperfusion (Fig. 2a), a ~70 %
reduction compared to spleens from naïve mice. In contrast,
viable spleen cell counts in the recipients of IL-10+ B-cells

were significantly higher (~30–40 million cells/mouse, p=
0.049) 96 h following MCAO (Fig. 2a).
Given the partial restoration of splenic cell numbers in the
IL-10+ B-cell-treated group, we further evaluated the frequencies of specific surviving splenic cell types. As shown in
Fig. 2a, none of the spleen cell subpopulations (percentages
or absolute cell numbers) were significantly different between
the B-cell vs. Vehicle treated MCAO mice, although CD4+ Tcells, CD11b+ monocytes and CD11c+ dendritic cells trended
higher, CD19+ B-cells did not change and CD8+ T-cells
trended lower. Since the transferred IL-10-GFP+ B-cells comprised only ~1–2 % of the total splenocytes from WT recipient
mice (data not shown), it was evident that the increase in
spleen cell numbers was not contributed by the transferred

cells, but rather due to the influence of the transferred cells on
recipient splenocyte distribution. Moreover, recipients of IL10+ B-cells had more viable splenocytes 96 h after reperfusion
compared to Vehicle control mice (~70 % vs. 45 % propidium
iodide (PI)− cells, data not shown). Thus, splenic atrophy was
partially prevented upon transfer of IL-10+ B-cells 24 h after
MCAO induction.

B cell-sufficient mice (Bodhankar et al. 2013, 2014). To
determine whether the delayed transfer of IL-10-GFP+ Bcells to WT mice similarly reduces cellular infiltration into
brain after MCAO, we enumerated the total number of live
leukocytes obtained from the left (contralateral, MCAO-

unaffected) and right (ipsilateral; MCAO-affected) hemispheres. The Vehicle-treated MCAO mice demonstrated a
massive infiltration of leukocytes in the ischemic hemisphere
after 96 h of reperfusion, but this cellular infiltration was
significantly reduced (p=0.042) in the MCAO-affected hemispheres of the IL-10-GFP + B-cell-recipient WT mice

(Fig. 3a). Further flow cytometric evaluation of the leukocyte
composition in the brains of the IL-10-GFP+ B-cell-treated vs.
Vehicle-treated mice after 96 h of reperfusion revealed reduced frequencies of activated CD11b + CD45high MG/
macrophages (p=0.047) and infiltrating CD19+ B-cells (p=
0.003) and an increased frequency of resting MG cells (p=
0.020) in the ipsilateral hemispheres of the MCAO-induced
B-cell-transferred group (Fig. 3b).
Treatment with IL-10+ B-cells, 24 h post-MCAO, results in a
significant increase in CD8+ T regulatory cells and reduced
inflammation in both the spleen and the ischemic brain
hemisphere of recipient mice after 96 h reperfusion
Our previous studies demonstrated that prophylactic treatment
with IL-10+ B-cells given 24 h prior to MCAO induced
immunoregulation in the periphery but not locally in the
affected brain hemisphere, potentially mediated in part by a
recently identified CD8+ regulatory T-cell sub-population
called CD8+CD122+ Tregs (Bodhankar et al. 2013, 2014).
We thus addressed whether therapeutic treatment of MCAO
mice with IL-10+ B-cells 24 h post MCAO could also induce
CD8+CD122+ Tregs. As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, treatment
with IL-10+ B-cells resulted in a significant increase in the
frequency of CD8+CD122+ Tregs in both the spleen (Fig. 4a,
p=0.002) and the ipsilateral brain hemisphere (Fig. 5a, p=
0.039) after 96 h reperfusion. Moreover, there were significant
increases in the spleen and the ischemic brain hemisphere in
percentages of total recipient GFP − IL-10 + leukocytes
(Fig. 4b, p=0.025 in spleen; and Fig. 5b, p=0.049 in brain)
and IL-10+CD8+CD122+ Tregs (Fig. 4b, p=0.007 in spleen;
and Fig. 5b, p=0.005 in brain). It is noteworthy that the IL10+CD8+CD122+ Tregs comprised ~10 % of CD8+ cells in
the spleen and >40 % of CD8+ cells in the ischemic brain
hemisphere after 96 h reperfusion in IL-10+ B-cell treated
mice with MCAO. Moreover, in spleen, the increase in IL10+CD8+CD122+ Tregs appeared to have anti-inflammatory
activity, potentially accounting for a significant reduction in
percentages of IFN-γ+ and IL-21+ CD8+ T-cells (Fig. 4c, p=
0.037).
Comparatively, other regulatory cell types were less apparent in MCAO mice treated therapeutically vs. prophylactically
with IL-10+ B-cells. We previously demonstrated significant
increases in the frequencies of Foxp3+CD4+ Tregs as well as
CD1dhiCD19+ Bregs in IL-10+ B-cell recipient vs. control
mice when the IL-10+ Bregs were transferred 24 h before
the induction of MCAO. As shown in Fig. 6a, the frequencies
of CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs were significantly higher in the spleens
of IL-10+ B cell-recipient mice, but there was no difference in
the frequency of CD1dhiCD19+ Bregs. Having previously
demonstrated that B-cells are the major producers of IL-10
post-MCAO (Ren et al. 2011), we here similarly evaluated IL10 production by splenic Breg cells. As shown in Fig. 6b, the

919

total recipient GFP− IL-10+ percentage expressed by recipient
Breg (CD1dhiCD19+) cells in spleens was not significantly
different (p=0.106) in the B-cell-recipient vs. control mice
with MCAO. However, unlike the IL-10+CD8+CD122+
Tregs, there was no significant increase in the CD4+Foxp3+
Tregs or IL-10+CD1dhiCD19+ Bregs in the ischemic hemisphere of the brain of MCAO mice after 96 h reperfusion
(Fig. 6c, d). Notably, a low percentage of transferred GFP+IL10+CD19+ B-cells was also found in both the spleen (~1 %)
and ischemic brain hemisphere (~3 %) of the recipient mice
(Fig. 6b, d), indicating their persistence in the periphery and
infiltration into the brain after MCAO.
IL-10+GFP+ B-cells, transferred 24 h after MCAO, inhibit
the activation and suppress the pro-inflammatory states
of T-cells and monocytes in the periphery
To further evaluate the possible regulatory effects of the
dominant CD8+CD122+ suppressor Tregs generated after the
transfer of IL-10+ B-cells, 24 h post-MCAO, we evaluated
changes in expression of activation markers and cytokines by
splenic monocytes and T–cells that might be influencing the
splenic milieu by Flow Cytometry. CD11b+ splenic monocytes from IL-10+ B-cell treated mice had significantly lower
expression of MHCII (p=0.003), TNF-α (p=0.026) and IL1β (p=0.0002) and similarly, splenic T-cells had lower expression of CD69 (p=0.049 for CD4+ and p=0.046 for CD8+
T-cells) and IL-21 (p=0.01 for CD4+ T-cells) (Fig. 7a, b)
compared to splenocytes from Vehicle-treated mice.
Transfer of IL-10+ B-cells, 24 h after MCAO induction,
reduces the overall pro-inflammatory milieu in the ischemic
brain hemisphere
In order to assess the treatment effect of IL-10+ B-cells on the
expression of immune-related genes in the ischemic hemisphere of the brain, a 96-gene real time PCR assay was
performed. mRNA was isolated from the MCAO-affected
brains of three Vehicle-treated and four IL-10+ B-cell-treated
mice. Equivalent amounts of cDNA were pooled and the
expression levels of various immune-related genes in the Bcell-treated samples were analyzed relative to the Vehicletreated (control) samples. The immune array data indicate
>2-fold upregulation of the CD8, IL4 and IL10 genes as well
as several genes in the cell death (Agtr2, a blood flow regulator) and signal transduction pathways (Stat1 and transcription
factors Tbx21, Nfatc3 and Nfatc4) in the MCAO-affected
brain hemispheres of B-cell treated vs. Vehicle-treated mice
(Fig. 8a). Two notable downregulated genes were Icam1, an
adhesion molecule, and a chemokine receptor, Cxcr3. Expression of five of these genes were validated using RT-PCR on
individual samples, and as demonstrated in Fig. 8b, the expression trends confirmed the changes observed in the gene

920

array. Moreover, the expression level for IL33, which can
induce IL-10-producing B-cells that counteract mucosal inflammatory responses in the gut (Sattler et al. 2014), was
shown to be significantly increased (p=0.0012), whereas the
expression level of MMP9, known to be closely implicated in
cerebral ischemia (Clark et al. 1997; Rosenberg et al. 1996),
was significantly decreased (p=0.048) (Fig. 8c) in the CNS of
B-cell treated vs. Vehicle-treated MCAO mice. Finally, CD3+
T-cells but not CD11b+ monocytes from in the ipsilateral brain
hemispheres of the B-cell transferred group demonstrated a
significantly reduced capacity to produce TNF-α after 96 h of
reperfusion (p=0.008; data not shown).

Discussion
The results presented above demonstrate for the first time a
major neuroprotective role for IL-10-producing B-cells in

Fig. 6 Treatment with IL-10+ B-cells, 24 h post-MCAO, leads to a
significant increase of the FoxP3+CD4+ T-cells in spleen but not the
ischemic brain hemisphere, with no changes in recipient Breg cells in
spleen or brain. Splenocytes and brain leukocytes from RPMI and IL-10GFP+ B-cell transferred WT recipient mice were harvested 96 h after
MCAO and assessed for: a. expression of FoxP3+CD4+ T-cells and
CD1dhighCD19+ regulatory B-cells in the spleens. Data are representative
of 2 independent experiments with spleens processed from 6 to 7 individual mice (mean±SEM); b. analyzed for IL-10-production on GFP−
cells using IL-10 APC mAb for detection and/or detecting the

treating MCAO in WT male mice 24 h after occlusion, a time
point well beyond the ~4 h tPA treatment window. This
therapeutic approach resulted in the generation of a dominant
IL-10+CD8+CD122+ Treg population associated with reduced
CNS inflammation.
IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, is produced mainly
by Th2-lymphocytes, Treg and Breg cell subsets and also by
other cells such as monocytes, macrophages and microglial
cells. It can inhibit IL-1 and TNF-α and decrease both cytokine receptor expression and receptor-induced activation. IL10 is increased in brain tissue after stroke (Pelidou et al. 1999;
Strle et al. 2001) and acts locally to limit stroke pathogenesis.
Pre-clinical data indicated that IL-10 deficient mice have a
larger lesion size after MCAO (Grilli et al. 2000), and systemic administration (Spera et al. 1998) and gene transfer of IL-10
(Ooboshi et al. 2005) in animal models could decrease brain
injury after stroke (Kim et al. 1996). Clinical data showed that
low IL-10 levels predict an increased risk of stroke (van Exel
et al. 2002). Taken together, IL-10 delivered in a biologically

Fig. 7 IL-10+GFP+ B-cells, transferred 24 h after MCAO, inhibit the
activation and suppress the pro-inflammatory states of T-cells and monocytes in the periphery. Splenocytes were isolated from RPMI or IL-10GFP+ B-cell recipient WT mice, 96 h after MCAO and assessed for: a.

of activation marker, CD69, on gated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells; and b

compatible manner by regulatory B- and T-cells could be a
highly effective therapy for the treatment of ischemic stroke
(Jin et al. 2013).
Transfer of IL-10+ B-cells 24 h after MCAO-induction led
to a significant reduction in infarct volumes. Protection from
MCAO-induced damage was observed mainly in the cortex
and ischemic hemisphere but not in the striatum, perhaps
reflecting the difficulty of IL-10-secreting B-cells to reverse
early MCAO-induced damage in moderately vascularized
brain regions. Also, from the neurological deficit scores, it
was apparent that the protection rendered to the MCAO mice
that received IL-10+ B-cells only became significant at the
96 h time-point. This delay in the treatment effect suggests
that the nature of the immune changes generated in the recipient mice may involve adaptive as well as innate responses.
To further discern the regulatory role of IL-10+ B-cells on
the developing infarct, we focused on the fate of the transferred IL-10-secreting B-cells and their impact on peripheral
responses and the infiltrating leukocytes and resident cells
within the ischemic hemisphere. Due to their derivation from

GFP+ donor mice, it was possible to distinguish the GFP+ IL10-secreting donor B-cells from GFP− recipient pathogenic
and regulatory cells in mixed populations by FACS after 96 h
reperfusion in MCAO mice. Indeed, the donor GFP+ B-cell
population (5 million were injected 24 h after MCAO) constituted only about 0.6 % of the splenocyte population and
about 0.3 % of the cells in the ischemic brain hemisphere of
MCAO mice. The result of this delayed transfer had an
enormous impact on the outcome of the MCAO insult, however, reducing stroke lesion size by >20 %, ameliorating
survival of splenocytes from 20 to >30 million cells (>50 %
improvement) and inhibiting infiltration of B-cells and activated macrophages and enhancing numbers of resident MG
cells in the ispilateral brain hemisphere (Fig. 3).
The relatively small numbers of surviving GFP+ IL-10secreting donor B-cells suggested that other recruited regulatory cell types might be selectively induced after treatment
with the donor B-cells, including CD4 +Foxp3+ Tregs,
CD8+CD122+ Tregs and CD19+CD1dhi Bregs observed in
previous studies (Bodhankar et al. 2013, 2014; Offner et al.

Fig. 8 Transfer of IL-10-GFP+ B-cells, 24 h after MCAO-induction,
reduces the overall pro-inflammatory milieu in the ischemic brain hemisphere 96 h after MCAO. Brains were collected from RPMI and IL-10GFP+ B-cell recipient WT mice, and mRNA prepared from ipsilateral
(right) hemispheric brain tissue for RT-PCR analysis. a. Gene expression
profile of ischemic brain tissue from IL-10-GFP+ B-cell vs. Vehicletreated mice was carried out. Relative expression of mRNA of inflammatory genes was analyzed by real-time PCR from pooled ischemic brain
samples from IL-10-GFP+ B-cell recipient (n=4) vs. Vehicle-treated (n=
3) mice. Values <1, 1, >1 represent down-regulated, unchanged or up-

regulated genes, respectively. ND, not detected. b. Relative expression

3 to 4 mice of each group, from at least 2 separate experiments. Significant differences between the right ischemic hemispheres of IL-10-GFP+
B-cell-treated vs. Vehicle-treated groups were determined using Student’s
t-test. (*p≤0.05 and **p≤0.01)

2006b). Of these three regulatory cell types, the best candidate
was the IL-10+CD8+CD122+ subpopulation. These cells were
significantly increased in B-cell vs. Vehicle treated MCAO
mice in the spleen and the ischemic brain hemisphere (Figs. 4
and 5), constituting ~1.5 % of both total splenocytes and
ipsilateral brain cells. In contrast, CD4+Foxp3+ Treg-cells
were significantly increased in the spleen but not the brain
of B-cell treated vs. Vehicle-treated MCAO mice and
CD19+CD1dhi Breg-cells although present, were not different
in B-cell treated vs. Vehicle-treated MCAO mice.
By calculating the percentages of total recovered cells for
each regulatory subset, it is possible to compare the actual
numbers of each subtype present in spleen and ipsilateral brain
hemisphere from MCAO mice. Thus, in spleen there were
~165,000 donor IL-10-secreting B-cells, ~360,000
CD8+CD122+ Tregs, ~330,000 CD19+CD1dhi Bregs and 1.9
million CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs. In ipsilateral brain tissue there
were ~1,500 donor IL-10-secreting B-cells, ~5,600
CD8+CD122+ Tregs, ~3,500 CD19+CD1dhi Bregs and ~400
CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs. From this information, it is clear that
although all the different regulatory subsets were present and
could contribute to immunoregulation in spleen and brain of
MCAO mice, the CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs were predominant in
spleen, whereas the CD8+CD122+ Tregs were predominant in
ischemic brain. Unlike the appearance of CD8+CD122+ Treg
cells in spleen but not CNS after prophylactic treatment with
IL-10+ B-cells 24 h prior to MCAO (Bodhankar et al. 2013,
2014), the appearance of the CD8+CD122+ Treg cells in the
ischemic brain hemisphere in mice treated 24 h after MCAO
indicated an important new activity of the transferred IL-10+
B-cells; that is, their ability to induce migration of the
CD8+CD122+ Treg cells from the periphery into the CNS
where local immunoregulation could take place.
CD8+CD122+ T-cells are naturally occurring regulatory Tcells that secrete copious levels of IL-10 that has been shown
to be the key effector molecule for transducing regulatory
activity (Endharti et al. 2005; Rifa’i et al. 2004). The in vivo
relevance of CD8+CD122+ regulatory T-cells has been proven
by experiments involving cell transfer into lymphocytedeficient mice (Endharti et al. 2011; Lee et al. 2008;
Mangalam et al. 2012). CD8+CD122+ regulatory T-cells are
known to recognize activated T-cells through direct cell-tocell contact involving conventional class I MHC molecules
(Okuno et al. 2013) and to inhibit the target T-cells without
additional antigen-presenting cells (Suzuki et al. 2008). Consistent with this description, our studies demonstrated reduced
expression of the CD69 activation molecule on both CD4+
and CD8+ splenic T-cells as well as significantly inhibited
levels of IL-21 by CD4+ T-cells and IFN-γ and IL-21 by
CD8+ T-cells from spleen (Figs. 4 and 7). Such inhibition of
IL-21 could indeed be beneficial to stroke outcome as indicated in a recent report showing that T-cell production of this
cytokine can induce brain injury after MCAO (Clarkson et al.

923

2014). Additional regulatory effects observed included reduced expression of MHCII, TNF-α and IL-1β by splenic
CD11b+ monocytes and enhanced expression of IL-4, IL-10
and IL-33, but reduced expression of ICAM-1, CXCL10,
CXCR3 and MMP-9 in the ischemic brain hemisphere
(Figs. 7-9).
Taken together, our present study demonstrates that transfer
of IL-10+ B-cells, 24 h after MCAO, markedly reduced infarct
volume in recipient mice. The MCAO-protected B-cell recipient mice had reduced numbers of activated, inflammatory Tcells, decreased infiltration of T-cells, increased regulatory
subpopulations, predominantly the CD8+CD122+ Treg subset, and a less inflammatory milieu in the ischemic hemispheres as compared to the control mice. Our studies for the
first time demonstrate a major immunoregulatory role for IL10+ B-cells in treating MCAO in WT mice even at a time point
well beyond the tPA treatment window, leading to the generation of a dominant CD8+CD122+ Treg population in the
ischemic brain hemisphere, thus implicating their potential
role in post-stroke immunoprotection. The effective treatment
of MCAO recipient mice with IL-10+ B-cells that fostered not
only a favorable stroke outcome but also decreased associated
degenerative factors known to worsen stroke adds promise to
this treatment for the future.
