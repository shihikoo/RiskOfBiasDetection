Intracranial pressure elevation reduces ﬂow through collateral
vessels and the penetrating arterioles they supply. A possible
explanation for ‘collateral failure’ and infarct expansion after
ischemic stroke
Daniel J Beard1, Damian D McLeod1, Caitlin L Logan1, Lucy A Murtha1, Mohammad S Imtiaz1,2, Dirk F van Helden1 and Neil J Spratt1,3
Recent human imaging studies indicate that reduced blood ﬂow through pial collateral vessels (‘collateral failure’) is associated with
late infarct expansion despite stable arterial occlusion. The cause for ‘collateral failure’ is unknown. We recently showed that
intracranial pressure (ICP) rises dramatically but transiently 24 hours after even minor experimental stroke. We hypothesized that
ICP elevation would reduce collateral blood ﬂow. First, we investigated the regulation of ﬂow through collateral vessels and the
penetrating arterioles arising from them during stroke reperfusion. Wistar rats were subjected to intraluminal middle cerebral artery
(MCA) occlusion (MCAo). Individual pial collateral and associated penetrating arteriole blood ﬂow was quantiﬁed using ﬂuorescent
microspheres. Baseline bidirectional ﬂow changed to MCA-directed ﬂow and increased by 4450% immediately after MCAo.
Collateral diameter changed minimally. Second, we determined the effect of ICP elevation on collateral and watershed penetrating
arteriole ﬂow. Intracranial pressure was artiﬁcially raised in stepwise increments during MCAo. The ICP increase was strongly
correlated with collateral and penetrating arteriole ﬂow reductions. Changes in collateral ﬂow post-stroke appear to be primarily
driven by the pressure drop across the collateral vessel, not vessel diameter. The ICP elevation reduces cerebral perfusion pressure
and collateral ﬂow, and is the possible explanation for ‘collateral failure’ in stroke-in-progression.

INTRODUCTION
The term stroke-in-progression has been used to describe patients
who present with mild or rapidly improving symptoms and then
show a decline in neurologic function within 24 to 72 hours
after stroke onset.1 It occurs in approximately 10% to 40% of
patients2 and has a poor prognosis, with over 50% of patients
requiring assistance with daily tasks at 3 months.3 Until recently,
the assumed pathophysiology of stroke-in-progression was that
patients experience clinical improvement then subsequent
deterioration due to spontaneous reperfusion, then rethrombosis
of the initially occluded artery.4 This is the basis for the frequent
use of anticoagulants such as heparin in these patients, despite
lack of evidence of clinical beneﬁt.5 Recent use of sequential
advanced imaging has permitted identiﬁcation of patients with
early infarct expansion as the cause for their neurologic
deterioration, and for these patients to be distinguished from
those with a 2nd stroke (in a separate arterial territory) and those
with deterioration from other factors such as brain swelling. Such
studies have shown ﬂuctuating symptoms that occur in patients

with infarct expansion despite stable arterial occlusion.6 Infarct
expansion typically occurs within the ﬁrst day post admission, and
is associated with reduced ﬂow through pial collateral vessels.7,8
Pial collaterals provide anastomoses between distal branches of
adjacent arterial territories, and permit retrograde residual perfusion of the ischemic penumbra after stroke.9 They also provide
perfusion to penetrating arterioles at the ‘watershed’ between
different arterial territories under normal circumstances.10,11 Good
collateral supply is strongly associated with better clinical outcome post-stroke.12 Adequacy of preformed collaterals is strongly
inﬂuenced by genetics.13 However, failure of ﬂow through
adequate preformed collaterals has been recognized as occurring
in some patients.7 Proposed mechanisms include collateral
vessel thrombosis,14 venous steal,15 reversed Robin Hood
syndrome,16 and blood pressure ﬂuctuations secondary to
autonomic dysfunction.17 However, evidence has not been strong
for any of these mechanisms. Recent data obtained by our group
indicate that there is a transient but dramatic elevation of
intracranial pressure (ICP) 24 hours after minor experimental

stroke.18 Perhaps surprisingly, we can ﬁnd no published data
regarding ICP in patients with small strokes. We hypothesize that a
similar transient elevation in ICP 24 hours after minor stroke may
occur in patients and cause ‘collateral failure’ leading to
neurologic deterioration in stroke-in-progression. The aims of this
study were to (1) investigate the key regulators of collateral and
associated penetrating arteriole blood ﬂow during stroke and
reperfusion; (2) investigate changes in anterior cerebral arterymiddle cerebral artery (ACA–MCA) ‘watershed’ perfusion during
stroke and reperfusion; (3) determine the effect of ICP elevation on
collateral and ‘watershed’ penetrating arteriole blood ﬂow during
stroke.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics Statement
All animal experiments were performed on male outbred Wistar rats (aged
7 to 12 weeks, body weight 300 g to 500 g; ASU breeding facility University
of Newcastle, Australia). Experiments were approved by the Animal Care
and Ethics Committee of the University of Newcastle (Protocols # A-2011131 and # A-2011-112) and were in accordance with the requirements of
the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for
Scientiﬁc Purposes. The studies were conducted and the manuscript
prepared in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines.19

minutes after MCAo. Then, artiﬁcial ICP elevation was started by infusing
artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid (aCSF) (SDR Scientiﬁc, Sydney, Australia) into
the lateral ventricle, starting at a rate of 4 μL/min. The rate of aCSF infusion
was gradually increased to raise ICP in 5 mm Hg increments (infusion
rates needed for each 5 mm Hg increase are presented in Supplementary
Table 1). At each 5 mm Hg ICP increment, a recording of collateral and
'watershed' penetrating arteriole ﬂow was made. These incremental
increases in ICP were continued until ICP reached 30 mm Hg above
baseline (Figures 1C and 2A), equivalent to the values that occur naturally
24 hours after stroke in this model.18

Anesthesia and Monitoring
The anesthetic and monitoring protocols were as previously reported.20
Rats were anesthetized with 5% isoﬂurane in O2/N2 (1:3) and maintained
with 1% to 2% isoﬂurane. Core temperature was maintained at 37°C by a
thermocouple rectal probe (RET-2, Physitemp Instruments Inc., Clifton, NJ,
USA) and warming plate (HP-1M, Physitemp). Incision sites were shaved,
cleaned, and injected subcutaneously with 2 mg/kg 0.05% Bupivacaine
(Pﬁzer, Sydney, Australia). Blood gases were monitored intermittently
throughout study I and at baseline in study III. Blood samples (0.1 mL) were
taken from a right femoral arterial line. This line was also used for
continuous arterial pressure monitoring. Heart rate and respiratory rate
were calculated from the clearly discernible cardiac and respiratory
waveforms on the arterial pressure tracing.21

In Vitro Microsphere Flow Validation

Surgical Procedures

The ﬂuorescent microsphere method for blood ﬂow calculation was
validated in vitro by comparison with the weighed volume of blood
through the same system over a 10-minute time interval. Fluorescent
microspheres (1 μm in diameter) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA)
diluted in heparinized rat blood (0.03% w/v) were infused via an
automated syringe driver (Pump 11 Elite, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston,
MA, USA) through polyurethane tubing (internal diameter 127 μm).
Multiple ﬂow rates (0.25 μL/min to 10 μL/min) were tested. At each rate,
the end of the tubing was positioned inside an Eppendorf tube. Eppendorf
tubes were weighed before the experiment and reweighed after exactly
10 minutes infusion to calculate the volume of ﬂuid in the tube, i.e.,
‘Measured Blood ﬂow’ (Qm), calculated in μL/min. Microsphere ﬂow (Qmicro)
was imaged at the midpoint of the 10-minute collection interval.
Microspheres passing through the tube were recorded at 300 frames
per second with a digital camera (Genie HM640, Teledyne Dalsa, Waterloo,
ON, Canada) connected to a × 10 objective ﬂuorescent microscope (BX60,
Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Microsphere blood ﬂow was calculated using the
following equation: Blood Flow = πr2 × v, where v is microsphere velocity in
μm/s and r is the radius (half the diameter) of the vessel (tubing) in μm.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion. Middle cerebral artery occlusion was
induced using the silicone-tipped intraluminal thread occlusion method,
using 4-0 monoﬁlament occluding threads with 3.5 mm length × 0.35 mm
diameter silicone tips, as previously reported.22,23 For CT studies, ﬁnal
thread advancement to produce MCAo was performed on the CT scanning
table, as previously reported.20

Experimental Protocols
Study I. In Study I, we investigated the relative importance of changes in
blood ﬂow velocity and collateral vessel diameter in determining collateral
blood ﬂow during MCA occlusion (MCAo) and reperfusion. Animals
underwent baseline recordings of ACA–MCA pial collateral and ‘watershed’
penetrating arteriole blood ﬂow before induction of experimental stroke
(90 minutes MCAo, n = 6). Collateral and ‘watershed’ penetrating arteriole
blood ﬂow recordings were then taken every 10 minutes throughout
occlusion and every 5 minutes for 15 minutes after reperfusion (Figure 1A).
Study II. The aim of study II was to measure tissue perfusion in the
‘watershed’ region supplied by the penetrating arterioles arising from ACA–
MCA collaterals, using computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging.
Animals were subjected to either permanent MCAo (n = 6), or 1 hours (n = 8)
or 2 hours (n = 7) temporary MCAo. CTP scans were taken at baseline and
immediately after MCAo. For temporary strokes, CTP scans were taken every
30 minutes during occlusion, immediately after reperfusion, and at 30
minutes after reperfusion. For permanent strokes, CTP scans were taken
every 30 minutes for the ﬁrst 2 hours after occlusion (Figure 1B).
Study III. In study III, our aim was to determine the effect of ICP elevation
on collateral and ‘watershed’ penetrating arteriole ﬂow during MCAo. After
pre-MCAo baseline measurements (collateral and 'watershed' penetrating
arteriole ﬂow, ICP, and mean arterial pressure (MAP)), rats were subjected
to permanent MCAo (n = 6). A post-occlusion baseline measurement of
collateral and 'watershed' penetrating arteriole ﬂow was conducted 30

Collateral and ‘watershed’ penetrating arteriole blood ﬂow quantiﬁcation
method. A jugular venous line was placed for the constant infusion of
microspheres, used to quantify collateral and associated penetrating
arteriole blood ﬂow.23,24 A portion of the right parietal bone overlying the
MCA–ACA ‘watershed’ territory was removed using a high speed dental
drill (Forte 100, Saeshen, Daegu, Korea) to create a cranial window
extending 5 mm caudal × 5 mm lateral from a point at bregma and 1 mm
lateral to midline (Figure 2B). Care was taken to leave the dura intact. The
hole was ﬁlled with aCSF and sealed with a glass coverslip. A laser Doppler
probe (LDF) (Moore Instruments, Sussex, UK) was placed just lateral to the
cranial window to monitor the tissue perfusion of the MCA territory
(Figure 2B). Middle cerebral artery occlusion was conﬁrmed by 450%
decrease in LDF signal. Prespeciﬁed exclusion criteria were lack of LDF
drop, suboptimal cranial window, or subarachnoid hemorrhage on
postmortem.
Placement of intracranial pressure monitor and intraventricular catheter.
Two hollow PEEK (poly-ethyl ether ketone) screws (Solid Spot LLC, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) of 2 mm diameter × 5 mm length were inserted for
monitoring of epidural ICP and for insertion of an intraventricular catheter
for artiﬁcial elevation of ICP by aCSF infusion (Figure 2B), according to our
published method.18,21 Intracranial pressure was measured using a ﬁber
optic pressure transducer (420-LP, SAMBA Sensors, Gothenburg, Sweden)18
sealed into a saline-ﬁlled screw with biocompatible caulking material
(Silagum, DMG Dental, Hamburg, Germany). Recent studies indicate
negligible differences between ICP measurements taken epidurally or
intraparenchymally in rats, and the epidural method avoids brain trauma
and the risk of creating a CSF leak.25,26 Probe location was validated by
ensuring clear cardiac and respiratory waveforms and responsiveness of
signal to abdominal compression.21 Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was
calculated using the formula CPP = MAP − mean ICP. In the more rostral
screw, an intraventricular catheter was inserted 8 mm, so that the tip was
in the lateral ventricle (Figure 2B). The catheter was also sealed into the
screw with caulking material before aCSF infusion.

and 15 minutes reperfusion. (B) Study II. CTP imaging (vertical dotted lines) was performed to measure whole brain perfusion changes during
both permanent and temporary (1 hours or 2 hours) MCAo. After baseline CTP scans, scans were taken every 30 minutes during MCAo. Further
scans were taken immediately after reperfusion (R) and at 30 minutes after reperfusion. Images obtained from these scans were then used to
assess changes in ‘watershed’ perfusion during occlusion and reperfusion. (C) Study III. ICP was artiﬁcially elevated by ﬂuid infusion into the

could be seen transiting vessels within the cranial window. Pial collateral
arterioles were identiﬁed as vessels between the ACA and MCA territories
with microspheres entering from both ends, and exiting at the midpoint of
the vessel (bidirectional ﬂow). Microspheres exit the vessel at the conﬂuence
of ACA and MCA origin ﬂow down a ‘watershed’ penetrating arteriole,
typically with a diameter of ~ 30 μm (illustrated in Figure 2C, Supplementary
Figure 1A, shown in Supplementary Video 1). In each experiment, one
collateral vessel and one ‘watershed’ penetrating arteriole were visualized.
The collateral vessel selected was the ﬁrst vessel in which ﬂuorescent
microspheres could be visualized ﬂowing in the characteristic bidirectional
pattern previously reported.10,11 The ‘watershed’ penetrating arteriole
located at the conﬂuence of the bidirectional baseline collateral vessel ﬂow
was used to demarcate the ACA and MCA portions of the vessel for the
duration of the study. The exact location of each vessel relative to bregma
varied, since, as in much of the cerebral vasculature in rats and humans,
there is signiﬁcant interindividual anatomic variability. The available human
imaging and animal experimental evidence indicates that in the setting of
complete MCAo, the collateral vessels are the major source of residual
perfusion to the entire ischemic penumbra. Moreover, infarcts expand
toward these vessels from the more centrally located infarct core
(Figure 2D).27 Proximal branches of the MCA receive collateral ﬂow from
multiple collaterals via distal branches (Figure 2E). Therefore, both pressure
and vasodilation effects are anticipated to be equal in all of the ACA–MCA
collateral vessels. Therefore, we did not focus on the exact location of the
individual vessel studied, since the above data indicate that all ACA–MCA
collateral vessels are likely to respond and contribute similarly.
Tracking of microspheres and calculation of blood ﬂow were performed
as per the in vitro microsphere ﬂow validation (Figure 2F). Blood ﬂow was

calculated in both the ACA and MCA portions of the collateral vessel at
each time point. To calculate ‘watershed’ penetrating arteriole ﬂow, the
following equations were used, dependent on the type of ﬂow:
1. During bidirectional ﬂow, penetrating arteriole ﬂow = ACA ﬂow
+MCA ﬂow;
2. During unidirectional ﬂow, penetrating arteriole ﬂow = proximal ﬂow—
distal ﬂow (proximal and distal ﬂow were deﬁned relative to the
direction of ﬂow, Figure 2C).

Computed Tomography Perfusion ‘Watershed’ Image Acquisition,
Processing, and Analysis
Detailed methods and CTP data have previously been reported for this
cohort of animals;20,23,24 however, the ‘watershed’ territory perfusion was
not previously analyzed. Imaging was performed using a Siemens 64 slice
CT scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 512 × 512 matrix, 50 mm
ﬁeld of view with twelve 2.4 mm slices. Radio-opaque contrast for
perfusion imaging was injected through a jugular venous catheter.20
Post-processing of perfusion data was performed using the MIStar
imaging software (Apollo Medical Imaging Technology, Melbourne,
Australia), as previously described with some minor modiﬁcations.20 In
brief, cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) maps were generated from CTP images.
The 2.4 mm CTP slice at 0 mm bregma was analyzed for each animal. Two
1 mm × 1 mm regions of interest (ROIs; 1 superﬁcial, 1 deep relative to
skull) were generated and placed 2.5 mm lateral to the sagittal sinus
(corresponding to the location of the ‘watershed’ penetrating arterioles

(right) and contralateral (left) cortex (Figure 2G). This allowed assessment
of perfusion changes in the ‘watershed’ territory between the ACA and the
MCA. The CBF from the superﬁcial and deep ROIs was then averaged.

animals included in our analysis but without MCAo. Serial arterial blood gas
analyses were undertaken while PaCO2 was increased in a stepwise
manner by incremental increases in inhaled isoﬂurane concentration and
accompanying reduction in respiratory rate. A recording of the diameter of
a collateral vessel was made at each PaCO2.

Testing Cerebral Vasoreactivity
A control animal was subjected to isoﬂurane+endogenous CO2 challenge
to ensure collateral vessel reactivity was preserved under experimental
conditions. This animal underwent the same surgical procedures as the

including visual examination of histograms as calculated skewness and
kurtosis between +1 and − 1, was analyzed. Linear regression analysis was
performed to assess the correlation between microsphere blood ﬂow and
measured blood ﬂow in vitro. Accuracy was calculated using the standard
error of the estimate divided by the mean. Changes in collateral blood
ﬂow, collateral blood ﬂow velocity, collateral vessel diameter, ‘watershed’
penetrating arteriole blood ﬂow, CTP-determined ‘watershed’ perfusion,
and physiologic variables during MCAo reperfusion or during ICP elevation
were assessed using repeated measures one-way ANOVA with post hoc
Dunnett’s test. Repeated-measure observations during MCAo reperfusion
or ICP elevation were analyzed by repeated-measures linear regression,
using Stata 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). We planned study III
with six animals. We anticipated ICP elevation would reduce collateral ﬂow
by 35% with a standard deviation of 0.25. We were able to reject the null
hypothesis that ICP does not reduce collateral ﬂow with probability
(power) 0.80. The type I error probability associated with the test of this
null hypothesis (alpha) was 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± standard
deviation (s.d.). Statistical signiﬁcance was accepted at Po0.05.

RESULTS
In Vitro Microsphere Blood Flow Validation
Regression analysis indicated that the relationship between
measured blood ﬂow (Qm) and microsphere blood ﬂow (Qmicro)
was signiﬁcant and linear (r2 = 0.99, Po 0.0001). There were no
signiﬁcant differences between the regression line and the line of
identity with respect to the intercept or slope. The Qmicro
calculation was accurate to 9.1% (Supplementary Figure 2).
Study I—Key Determinants of Collateral Blood Flow During Middle
Cerebral Artery Occlusion and Reperfusion
Seven animals were excluded. Reasons for exclusion were
subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 1) or suboptimal cranial window
(n = 6). Physiologic variables for all studies are listed in Table 1.
During MCAo and reperfusion, mean heart rate was higher than
baseline (389 ± 22 BPM baseline, 451 ± 74 BPM during MCAo and
471 ± 64 BPM reperfusion).
At baseline, slow bidirectional ﬂow was observed in all collateral
vessels (99 ± 53 nL/min and 99 ± 32 nL/min in ACA and MCA
segments, respectively; Figure 3A). Flow was toward the center of
the collateral from both directions, meeting at the central
‘watershed’ penetrating arteriole, which microspheres from both
ACA and MCA segments were seen to enter (illustrated in
Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure 1A, shown in Supplementary Video 1). After MCAo, ﬂow switched from bidirectional ﬂow to
unidirectional. Flow from the ACA segment remained anterograde;
ﬂow in the MCA segment became retrograde (illustrated in
Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure 1B, shown in Supplementary

Video 2). Flow increased dramatically in both segments, to
696 ± 331 nL/min and 453 ± 179 nL/min on the ACA and MCA
sides of the vessel, respectively (699% and 458% of baseline, both
P o0.01, Figure 3A). Further gradual increase in ﬂow occurred,
peaking 80 minutes after MCAo (1,066 ± 469 nL/min and
825 ± 617 nL/min; 1071% and 834% of baseline, respectively; both
P o0.001, Figure 3A).
At reperfusion, three different blood ﬂow patterns were
observed within the ACA and MCA segments of the collateral
vessel: return to bidirectional ﬂow (anterograde on both sides,
toward the center of the collateral), a complete reversal of ﬂow so
that ﬂow was from MCA to ACA side (illustrated in Supplementary
Figure 1C, shown in Supplementary Video 3) or persistent ACA to
MCA ﬂow (Figures 3B and 3C). Responses varied between animals,
and within animals at different time points post-reperfusion.
Regardless of the direction of ﬂow, there was an immediate
reduction in mean blood ﬂow upon reperfusion, (from 924 ±
353 nL/min pre-reperfusion to 316 ± 424 nL/min post-reperfusion
on the ACA side of collateral vessels and from 697 ± 334 nL/min to
337 ± 243 nL/min on the MCA sides, both P o 0.01; Figure 3A).
Collateral blood ﬂow was calculated from blood ﬂow velocity
and vessel diameter. The contributions of each were examined to
explore the major determinants of the dramatic changes in ﬂow
that were observed at the times of vessel occlusion and
reperfusion. The velocity of collateral blood ﬂow increased
signiﬁcantly immediately post-MCAo to 10,336 ± 6,965 μm/s and
7,041 ± 5,443 μm/s on the ACA and MCA sides of the collateral
vessel, respectively (600% and 395% of baseline, respectively, both
Po0.001). Velocity remained signiﬁcantly above baseline throughout MCAo and peaked 80 minutes after MCAo (Figure 4A). The
diameter of collateral vessels increased only gradually after MCAo,
to 44.1 ± 6 μm and 45.2 ± 6 μm on the ACA and MCA side of the
vessel, respectively (125% and 126% of baseline, respectively,
Po0.05 versus baseline at all time points) (Figure 4B). Collateral
blood ﬂow velocity was strongly correlated, and collateral vessel
diameter weakly correlated with collateral blood ﬂow (within
subject r = 0.86 and 0.36, respectively, both Po0.0001; Figures 4C
and 4D).
In the control experiments to determine the effects of isoﬂurane
and PaCO2 on collateral vasomotor reactivity, the collateral vessel
exhibited a stepwise increase in diameter in response to
incremental increases in endogenous CO2 concentrations. Diameter increased from 32.42 μm at a PaCO2 of 38 mm Hg (low
normal range) to 38.60 μm at 44 mm Hg (high normal range) and
46.04 μm at 60 mm Hg (hypercapnia) (Supplementary Figure 3).

Figure 2. Surgical and experimental procedures. (A) Representative intracranial pressure (ICP) trace. ICP was increased by infusion of artiﬁcial
cerebrospinal ﬂuid (aCSF) into the left lateral ventricle of a rat post-stroke. The infusion rate was increased stepwise from 4 μL/min to 40 μL/min.
This resulted in an increase in ICP with no signiﬁcant change in arterial blood pressure, so cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) (not shown)
mirrored ICP changes. (B) Schematic of skull surgery and monitoring: cranial window used to measure collateral ﬂow (Qc), laser Doppler ﬂow

Schematic of collateral blood ﬂow direction before and after MCA occlusion (MCAo). The ‘watershed’ penetrating arteriole at the conﬂuence
of the bidirectional collateral vessel blood ﬂow (top panel) was used to demarcate the anterior (ACA) and middle (MCA) cerebral artery
portions of the vessel (vertical line). This same landmark was also used after MCAo (bottom panel). Blood ﬂow was measured in both ACA and
MCA portions of the vessel at each imaging time point. (D) Schematic showing the relationship of the collateral and 'watershed' penetrating

infarct expansion into the penumbra toward the collateral vessel. Area of infarction is based of infarct probability maps 24 hours after

‘Watershed’ Penetrating Arteriole Flow and Tissue Perfusion
During Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion and Reperfusion
‘Watershed’ penetrating arteriole ﬂow—microsphere technique.
Mean ‘watershed’ penetrating arteriole blood ﬂow remained relatively
constant throughout MCAo and reperfusion. It was 198 ± 83 nL/min at
baseline, and ranged from 186 ± 170 nL/min to 312 ± 217 nL/min
during MCAo, and from 219 ± 123 nL/min to 266 ± 71 nL/min during
reperfusion, with no clear trend of change over time (Figure 5A).
‘Watershed’ tissue perfusion—computed tomography perfusion
technique. Mean ‘watershed’ CBF in the ipsilateral and contralateral cortex pre-MCAo were 105 ± 63 mL/100 g per minute and
112 ± 57 mL/100 g per minute, respectively. These values showed
little variability immediately post-MCAo (95 ± 67 mL/100 g per
minute and 97 ± 60 mL/100 g per minute, respectively). In the
individual experimental groups, CBF in the ‘watershed’ also varied
very little after reperfusion after either 1-hour or 2-hour MCAo
(Figures 5B–E). In the permanent occlusion group, values also
varied little within 2 hours of occlusion (Figures 5F and 5G) There
was a nonsigniﬁcant trend to reduction in perfusion to both the
ipsilateral and contralateral ‘watersheds’ at 24 hours in the 1-hour
MCAo group (75 ± 44 mL/100 g per minute and 84 ± 12 mL/100 g
per minute, respectively; Figures 5B and 5C). (Supplementary

Study III—Effect of Intracranial Pressure Elevation on Collateral
and ‘Watershed’ Penetrating Arteriole Blood Flow
Two animals were excluded because of suboptimal cranial
window. Heart rate was higher at post-MCAo baseline compared
Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2015), 861 – 872

with pre-MCAo baseline (434 ± 65 BPM versus 368 ± 22 BPM;
Table 1). Both blood pressure and heart rate were not
signiﬁcantly different between post-MCAo baseline and
at peak ICP. Progressive elevation of ICP above baseline resulted
in progressive reduction of CPP and signiﬁcantly reduced
collateral blood ﬂow (1,337 ± 900 nL/min at post-MCAo baseline
versus 915 ± 640 nL/min at 10 mm Hg and 605 ± 872 nL/min
at 30 mm Hg above baseline, Po0.05; Figure 6A. ‘Watershed’
penetrating arteriole ﬂow decreased dramatically even with a small
increase of ICP to 5 mm Hg above baseline (Figure 6B).
Flow reductions were statistically signiﬁcant at ICPs of 5, 10, and
20 mm Hg above baseline (40 ± 31, 75 ± 88, and 30 ± 56 nL/min,
respectively, versus 303 ± 210 nL/min at post-MCAo baseline,
Po0.05). There was a signiﬁcant correlation between CPP and
collateral blood ﬂow (within subject r = 0.58, Po0.0001, Figure 6C)
but not ‘watershed’ penetrating arteriole blood ﬂow (r = 0.35, P40.05;
Figure 6D).
Elevation of ICP to between 15 and 30 mm Hg above baseline
signiﬁcantly reduced collateral blood ﬂow velocity (10,393 ±
4,533 μm/s at post-MCAo baseline versus 6,939 ± 4,508 μm/s at
15 mm Hg, and 4,668 ± 4611 μm/s at 30 mm Hg above baseline,
Po 0.05; Figure 6E), but did not signiﬁcantly alter collateral vessel
diameter (47 ± 13 μm at post-MCAo baseline versus 50 ± 18 μm at
15 mm Hg, and 40 ± 16 μm at 30 mm Hg; both P40.05; Figure 6F).
There was a signiﬁcant correlation between CPP and collateral
blood ﬂow velocity (within subject r = 0.69, P o0.0001; Figure 6G)
but no signiﬁcant correlation with diameter (within subject r = 0,
P40.05; Figure 6H).

DISCUSSION
Several ﬁndings from this study shed new light on the regulators
of collateral ﬂow and advance our understanding of the potential
cause of ‘collateral failure’ associated with infarct expansion in

stroke patients. Changes in collateral blood ﬂow after stroke were
associated with only modest changes in vessel diameter, but large
changes in blood ﬂow velocity. From our knowledge of
hydrodynamics, we know that the latter is a surrogate for changes

Figure 3. Collateral ﬂow increases during ischemia and decreases during reperfusion. (A) Collateral blood ﬂow: absolute blood ﬂow in the
anterior cerebral artery (ACA) segment of the collateral vessel (solid columns) and blood ﬂow in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) segment of
the collateral vessel (hollow columns) during MCA occlusion (M) and reperfusion (R); **Po 0.01, ***P o0.001 for post-RM-ANOVA Dunnett’s
test compared with baseline (B); #Po0.05, ##P o0.01, ###P o0.001 for post-RM-ANOVA Dunnett’s test compared with 90 minutes MCAo (n = 6).
Average blood ﬂow is represented irrespective of direction. Flow direction varied after reperfusion, therefore averaging both + and − ﬂows
would leave the impression that there was little to no ﬂow through these vessels, which was not the case. Panels (B and C) illustrate the
importance of directionality of ﬂow post-reperfusion in the ACA and MCA segments of the collateral vessel. (B) Individual animal analysis of

in the pressure drop across the collateral vessel in response to
MCAo. This appears to be the key factor affecting ﬂow during
MCAo and reperfusion, rather than collateral diameter changes.
Blood ﬂow through ‘watershed’ penetrating arterioles supplied by
collaterals was maintained during the early phases of ischemia
when ICP is known not to be elevated. We were also able to
conﬁrm that tissue perfusion to the ‘watershed’ territory supplied
by these vessels was also stable during ischemia and reperfusion.
Intracranial pressure elevation, to levels equivalent to those we
have recently shown to occur 24 hours after stroke in this model,18
caused a progressive reduction in collateral blood ﬂow and a
dramatic and immediate reduction in penetrating arteriole
blood ﬂow.
Collateral vessels exhibited slow, bidirectional ﬂow at baseline.
Bidirectional ﬂow has previously been observed in the collateral
circulation of mice.10,11 We show here that this also occurs in rats.
At odds with these ﬁndings are the results from studies using laser
speckle imaging that reported no ﬂow under basal conditions.28,29
Those studies were interpreted as indicating that these vessels do
not ‘open up’ until major vessel occlusion occurs. However in light
of our current ﬁndings and the previous mouse data, a likely
alternative explanation is that laser speckle imaging is unsuited to
detection of the slow and bidirectional baseline ﬂow seen in
collateral vessels. Similarly, we saw that collateral blood ﬂow
continued after reperfusion, although at much lower velocities,
and with variation in ﬂow direction both between animals and
within individuals over time. Again these ﬁndings contrast to
those obtained with the laser speckle technique,28 likely for similar
reasons. Our data indicate that collaterals have an important
physiologic role under basal conditions, providing tissue perfusion

to the ‘watershed’ region located between the two vascular
territories.
Immediately after MCAo, collateral ﬂow became unidirectional,
toward the ischemic MCA territory. Flow increased dramatically,
however counter to our expectations, vessel diameter changes
were only modest. Collateral vessels have larger diameters relative
to vessels with similar ﬂow velocities elsewhere in the cerebral
circulation.30 The importance of this larger diameter becomes
apparent during experimental stroke, when there are many-fold
increases in velocity and absolute blood ﬂow, which becomes
unidirectional toward the occluded territory.10 This aspect of the
structure of collateral vessels appears to be optimized to maintain
stable baseline perfusion, while allowing for rapid increases of
ﬂow into the occluded arterial territory at onset of ischemia. The
indication that vessel diameter changes had a relatively modest
impact on the ﬂow increase post-MCAo suggests that the CPPdriven pressure differential across the collateral vessel is the major
driver of collateral blood ﬂow during stroke.31 This is quite
different to ﬂow regulation of vascular beds under physiologic
conditions, where vessel diameter is the key regulator of ﬂow. The
distinction is important conceptually, in optimizing our efforts to
manipulate collateral ﬂow therapeutically.
Flow through the ‘watershed’ penetrating vessels arising from
collaterals, and perfusion of the ipsilateral and contralateral
‘watershed’ remained relatively constant throughout stroke.
Consistent with our results, Toriumi et al11 showed that red cell
velocity in penetrating arterioles associated with collateral vessels
did not signiﬁcantly change from baseline after MCAo. However in
contrast to these ﬁndings, Shih et al32 reported a reduction in red
blood cell ﬂux in penetrating arterioles (driven by a reduction in

red blood cell velocity) during MCAo. The likely explanation for
these apparent discrepancies is that Shih et al32 did not specify
whether the penetrating arterioles measured in their study arose
directly from the collateral vessels, or from within the ischemic
MCA territory. In the latter case, a reduction in ﬂow would be

‘watershed’ penetrating arterioles most likely gives rise to an area
of oligemic tissue that borders the penumbra in stroke patients.33

CPP can alter perfusion of the ischemic penumbra is long
established.34–36 Most of the residual perfusion to the penumbra
travels via collateral vessels.12 A number of recent studies in
animal models of stroke have sucessfully enhanced penumbral
perfusion by increasing dilation of hypoxic arterioles using
inhaled nitric oxide.34,35 Others have increased ﬂow within the
terminal branches of the ACA or the pial collaterals between ACA
and MCA by using pressor therapy or partial aortic occlusion,
respectively.37,38 A number of small clinical studies have
attempted to enhance perfusion to the penumbra using
pressor therapy. However, the efﬁcacy of these approaches is
yet to shown in large randomized trials.39 The effects of ICP on
collateral perfusion are less often considered. We provide the ﬁrst
empirical evidence that elevation of ICP to levels equivalent to
those occurring naturally after experimental stroke causes a
signiﬁcant stepwise reduction in CPP and collateral blood ﬂow.18
We were unable to directly measure the pressure gradient
between the adjacent territories. However, our data strongly
suggest that elevation of ICP, by reducing CPP, reduced the
driving pressure across the collateral vessel. This is the explanation
for the observed stepwise reduction in blood ﬂow velocity
and ﬂow.
As soon as ICP was elevated to as little as 5 mm Hg above
baseline, ‘watershed’ penetrating arteriole ﬂow decreased dramatically and remained low thereafter. This result may be explained
by the differing responses to ischemia of the pial MCA arterial
branches (downstream of the retrograde collateral ﬂow during
MCAo) and the ‘watershed’ penetrating arterioles. Penetrating
arterioles are known as the ‘bottleneck’ of perfusion to the cortex.
They have been shown to maintain basal tone even after 2 hours
temporary MCA occlusion reperfusion, whereas the pial MCA
branches lose tone after even short durations of ischemia.40
Therefore, small reductions in CPP will have a much greater effect
on ‘watershed’ penetrating arterioles, since a greater driving
pressure (CPP) is required to maintain ﬂow across high resistance
vessels. The lack of further ﬂow reductions in the ‘watershed’
penetrating arterioles with further ICP elevation may in part
represent the counteracting effects of ‘watershed’ penetrating
arteriolar vasodilation (over a many minutes timescale) and
concurrent progressive experimental elevation of ICP. Conversely,
the maximally dilated pial MCA vasculature downstream of the
collateral vessel is a low resistance circuit.41 Therefore, incremental
changes in CPP would be expected to result in the observed linear
reduction in collateral blood ﬂow. The apparent selective
sensitivity of the ‘watershed’ penetrating arterioles arising from
collateral vessels to changes in perfusion pressure is also a
potential contributor to the selective sensitivity of this region to
infarction in the setting of vessel stenosis, in which local
ﬂuctuations in perfusion pressure are also implicated.
Recent serial advanced imaging studies have revealed that
patients with late infarct expansion have persistent arterial
occlusion and good collateral status at baseline. The subsequent
infarct expansion is associated with reduced collateral status or
‘collateral failure’.6,7 Intracranial pressure is known to increase in
patients with large malignant infarctions (480% of the MCA
territory),42 however because ICP monitoring is invasive it is not

performed in patients with small strokes. We do not know
whether these patients experience a transient ICP rise similar to
that seen in rats with experimental stroke.18 Clinical data obtained
for the CATCH study strongly highlighted the similarities in timing
between the ICP elevation seen in our stroke model and clinical
deterioration in stroke-in-progression, i.e., 53% of patients with
stroke-in-progression deteriorated on day 1 (ﬁrst full day in
hospital).8 The ﬁndings of the current study suggest that ICP
elevation is a very plausible mechanism for the ‘collateral failure’
and subsequent late infarct expansion in ischemic stroke patients.
Our method for collateral blood ﬂow quantiﬁcation permits a
degree of real-time quantiﬁcation not available with other
currently available techniques, and this provided us with
tremendous insights regarding the regulation of collateral ﬂow
during stroke reperfusion and the response to ICP elevation.
However, measurements were limited to a single collateral vessel
in each animal. To date, there is no method to quantify total
collateral blood ﬂow through all collateral vessels in real time.
However, we used CT perfusion imaging of tissue perfusion as a
surrogate for this and to conﬁrm our ﬁndings that stable
‘watershed’ penetrating arteriole ﬂow during MCAo reperfusion
is accompanied by stable tissue perfusion of the ‘watershed’
territories. The use of isoﬂurane anesthetic allowed optimal
control of anesthetic depth and blood gases in freely breathing
animals. However, isoﬂurane is known to dilate cerebral vessels.
Our validation study supported the experimental data indicating
that under the conditions the experiments were conducted,
signiﬁcant collateral vasodilatory potential remained. Using these
data we have estimated potential effects of greater vasodilatory
reserve to determine whether this would be likely to inﬂuence our
primary ﬁndings. Even if vasodilation was assumed to be more
than twice that seen under the inﬂuence of isoﬂurane, our
estimates indicate that the effects of greater vasodilation on
collateral blood ﬂow would still be an order of magnitude less
than the approximately 500% increase in ﬂow that was seen
immediately after MCAo.
In conclusion, we have shown that collateral vessels provide
retrograde perfusion of the occluded arterial territory during
stroke, while maintaining stable perfusion to the ‘watershed’
territory. Change in collateral vessel diameter had little effect on
changes in ﬂow, which appeared to be primarily driven by
changes in the pressure drop across the collateral vessel after
arterial occlusion. Supporting the key role of this pressure
differential, incremental elevation of ICP resulted in decreasing
CPP, and caused a stepwise reduction in collateral blood ﬂow.
Coupled with our recent ﬁndings showing a dramatic but
transient ICP elevation after minor experimental stroke, and
human imaging studies indicating that ‘collateral failure’ rather
than thrombus extension is the likely mechanism for most strokein-progression, these ﬁndings have important potential clinical
implications. They suggest that ICP elevation is a likely explanation
for ‘collateral failure’ and may be the mechanism responsible for
late infarct expansion in ischemic stroke patients.
