Background: For stroke patients the recovery of cognitive and behavioral functions is often incomplete.
Functional recovery is thought to be mediated largely by connectivity rearrangements in the peri-infarct
region. A method for manipulating gene expression in this region would be useful for identifying new
recovery-enhancing treatments.
New method: We have characterized a way of targeting adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to the
peri-infarct region of cortical ischemic lesion in rats 2 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo).
Results: We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to show that the altered properties of post-ischemic
brain tissue facilitate the spreading of intrastriatally injected nanoparticles toward the infarct. We show
that subcortical injection of green ﬂuorescent protein-encoding dsAAV7-GFP resulted in transduction of
cells in and around the white matter tract underlying the lesion, and in the cortex proximal to the lesion.
A similar result was achieved with dsAAV7 vector encoding the cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor
(CDNF), a protein with therapeutic potential.
Comparison with existing methods: Viral vector-mediated intracerebral gene delivery has been used before
in rodent models of ischemic injury. However, the method of targeting gene expression to the peri-infarct
region, after the initial phase of ischemic cell death, has not been described before.
Conclusions: We demonstrate a straightforward and robust way to target AAV vector-mediated overexpression of genes to the peri-infarct region in a rat stroke model. This method will be useful for studying
the action of speciﬁc proteins in peri-infarct region during the recovery process.

1. Introduction
Despite advances in modern medicine and risk factor control
contributing to the decreased mortality rate associated with acute
ischemic brain injury in developed countries (Go et al., 2014),
stroke remains the leading cause of long-term disability because
the functional recovery is often incomplete. The positive effect of
physiotherapy and cognitive therapy, or other stimulatory experience, on the recovery process is well known. However, these
are currently the only ways to accelerate the recovery process
in stroke patients, as there are no drug therapies to promote it.
Recovery of cognitive and behavioral functions results largely from
the remodeling of neuronal connectivity in the peri-infarct region
(Brown et al., 2007, 2009; Li and Murphy, 2008). The peri-infarct
region is deﬁned as the region surrounding the necrotic core of
the ischemic lesion. It largely overlaps with the penumbra area
– the area that undergoes temporary damage induced by partial
loss of perfusion and harmful inﬂuence of the adjacent infarct core.
By understanding the biological mechanisms of recovery in the
peri-infarct region, we may be able to identify pharmacological
targets for enhancing the recovery process. Toward this end, it
is necessary to experimentally manipulate gene expression in the
peri-infarct region. One approach is to use viral vector-mediated
gene delivery in rodent models of ischemic brain injury, and target the viral vectors to the area surrounding the infarct. A variety
of viral vectors have been used for intracerebral delivery, such as
lenti-, herpes-, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses (AAVvectors) (Lim et al., 2010). Out of these, AAV-vectors are the most
widely used, both in clinical studies and as research tools, as
AAVs do not cause any known disease and AAV-vectors do not
elicit any cellular immune reaction (Logan and Alexander, 2012).
AAV-mediated gene delivery before the ischemic period has been
used to assess the neuroprotective effect of vector-encoded proteins in cerebral ischemia (Airavaara et al., 2010; Harvey et al.,
2011). Similar attempts to modulate the recovery process have
been less frequent. There are some studies where virus particles
have been injected after reperfusion (Sun et al., 2011; Watanabe
et al., 2004), but only rarely has it been done after the initial phase
of massive neuronal death has passed (Sugiura et al., 2005). Comparably, expression of viral vector-delivered genes in the peri-infarct
region has been reported only in a few studies (Shen et al., 2011;
Sun et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2009). Unfortunately, in these studies the peri-infarct region targeting is not well documented and
the injections have been done during the initial ischemic events.
Thus, the aim of our study was to fully characterize the method
of AAV vector-mediated gene delivery to the peri-infarct region in
the brain of rats in which MCAo has resulted in differently sized
focal ischemic lesions. Here we describe the details and robustness of this approach so that it can be reproducibly used in future
studies.

2. Materials and methods

was made in the right hemisphere. The right MCA was ligated
with a 10-0 suture and CCAs were ligated with non-traumatic
arterial clamps for 60 min. After 60 min of ischemia, the suture
around the MCA and arterial clips on CCAs were removed. After
recovery from anesthesia, the rats were returned to their home
cage.
2.2. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining
The infarction area was measured by TTC staining 2 days after
MCAo, as described previously (Airavaara et al., 2010).
2.3. Nanoparticle injection
Dextran-coated magnetic iron oxide particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of 50 nm (ﬂuidMAG-DX from Chemicell, product
no. 4104-1) were injected into two sites at a concentration of
0.2 mg/mL (in phosphate-buffered saline solution, PBS, pH 7.4). The
injection volume, speed and stereotaxic coordinates were the same
as described below for the AAV injections.
2.4. Nanoparticle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
MRI studies were performed with a 4.7 T scanner (PharmaScan, BrukerBioSpin, Ettlingen, Germany) using a 90 mm shielded
gradient capable of producing a maximum gradient amplitude of
300 mT/m with an 80 ␮s rise time. The linear birdcage RF coil
used had an inner diameter of 38 mm. The head was ﬁxed in a
holder with tooth bar to minimize motion artifacts during imaging. The rats were imaged 10 min and 3 h after the injection
of dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticles. T2-weighted images
were acquired using a rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence (repetition time = 3100 ms, effective echo
time = 60 ms, matrix size = 256 × 256, ﬁeld of view = 40 × 40 mm,
with slice thickness = 1.0 mm).
2.5. AAV production
Viral stocks of AAV7-eGFP, AAV7-hMANF (mesencephalic
astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor, GenBank: NM 006010.5)
and AAV7-hCDNF (GenBank: NM 001029954.2) were prepared
using the triple-transfection method (Howard et al., 2008; Xiao
et al., 1998). Twenty 15 cm dishes containing HEK293 cells at
85–95% conﬂuency were transfected by the CaCl2 method with
pHelper (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), pdsAAV-GFP, pdsAAV-MANF
or pdsAAV-CDNF and a plasmid containing rep/cap genes for
serotype7, pAAV7 (Gao et al., 2002). Approximately 48 h posttransfection, cells were harvested, lysed by freeze/thaw, and
puriﬁed by centrifugation on a CsCl gradient. Final samples
were dialyzed in PBS containing 12.5 mM MgCl2 , aliquoted and
stored at −80 ◦ C until use. All vectors were titered by quantitative PCR using the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter as the
target sequence. Viral titers are recorded as viral genome/mL
(vg/mL).

2.1. Animals and surgery
2.6. AAV injection
All animal experiments were approved by Finnish National
Ethics Board and carried out according to the National Institute of
Health (NIH) guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals.
The ligation of the right MCA and common carotid arteries (CCAs)
bilaterally was performed as described previously (Chen et al.,
1986). Brieﬂy, male Sprague Dawley rats (RGD: 737903, average
weight 300 g, from Harlan, Netherlands) were anesthetized with
intra-peritoneal chloral hydrate injection and the bilateral CCAs
were identiﬁed and isolated through a ventral midline cervical incision. Rats were placed in stereotaxic apparatus and a craniotomy

Animals were anesthetized with isoﬂurane and placed into
stereotaxic frame. AAVs were injected intracerebrally into two
subcortical sites with the following stereotaxic coordinates: site 1
A/P +1.6; L/M +2.2; D/V −5.0 (from the surface of the skull) and site
2 A/P −0.4; L/M +4.0; D/V −5.0 (from the surface of the skull). Two
and a half microliters of AAV7-eGFP (titer 1.1 × 1013 vg/mL), AAV7hCDNF (3.9 × 1012 vg/mL) or AAV7-hMANF (8.1 × 1013 vg/mL)
were injected using a 10 ␮l Hamilton syringe with a 30 G blunt
needle. The injection was started 30 s after lowering the needle,

K. Mätlik et al. / Journal of Neuroscience Methods 236 (2014) 107–113

and the needle was kept in place for 2 min after the injection. The rate of infusion (1.0 ␮l/min) was controlled using a
microprocessor-controlled injector mounted to a stereotaxic
frame (UMP4; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA).
2.7. Perfusion and tissue processing
Twelve days after AAV injections, rats were perfused transcardially with 0.9% NaCl solution followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) in PBS. The brains were dissected out and post-ﬁxed for 2 days
in 4% PFA in PBS. After dehydration and clearing with xylene, the
brains were embedded in parafﬁn wax and sectioned into 5 ␮m
coronal sections.
2.8. Immunohistochemistry
Rabbit anti-GFP (sc-8334, Lot # H101, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, AntibodyRegistry: AB 641123) and afﬁnity-puriﬁed rabbit
anti-hCDNF antibody (DDV1, a gift from Dr. Johan Peränen and
Prof. Mart Saarma) were both used at 1:500 dilution. Sections
were deparafﬁnized and rehydrated through graded alcohol series.
After heat-induced epitope retrieval in microwave oven (10 min
95 ◦ C in 5.5 mM citraconic anhydride solution, pH 7.4) the samples were allowed to cool down to room temperature and rinsed
3 times 5 min with TBS buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM
NaCl), followed by H2 O2 quenching of endogenous peroxidase
activity and two washes in TBS-T (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5,
150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20). Primary antibodies were incubated in TBS-T at +4 ◦ C overnight, followed by three washes
with TBS-T. Biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:200, BA1000, AntibodyRegistry: AB 2313606), Vectastain ABC kit (PK4000)
and DAB Peroxidase Substrate Kit (SK-4100) were used for the
detection of primary antibody (all from Vector Laboratories,
Inc.). After dehydration in graded alcohol series and clearing
in xylene, the sections were mounted with DePeX mounting
medium and imaged with Pannoramic 250 Flash II slide scanner (3DHistech Ltd.) using the combined 20×/0.8 NA objective
(in Genome Biology Unit, Institute of Biotechnology, Helsinki).
The contrast was increased slightly and equally in all images of
immunostained sections to make the unstained regions more easily
visible.

3. Results
In this study, we used the rat model of focal cerebral ischemic
stroke, performed by extravascular ligation of the distal middle
cerebral artery together with clip-occlusion of the common carotid
arteries for 60 min (Chen et al., 1986). We chose this stroke model
because it is rather commonly used and results in a cortical lesion.
However, as in other MCAo-based models, the size and position of
the lesion varies from animal to animal (Fig. 1A–D) (Howells et al.,
2010), causing the exact position of the cortical peri-infarct region
to be different. This makes it unfeasibly difﬁcult to target the periinfarct region by direct injections into the cortex. On the other hand,
the exact position of the subcortical peri-infarct region is far less
variable compared to the cortical peri-infarct region (Fig. 1A–D)
(Chen et al., 1986). Therefore, we decided to analyze how widely
and reproducibly the peri-infarct region can be targeted by injecting AAV into the underlying subcortical structures, such as external
capsule/corpus callosum/striatum (Fig. 1E).
First we wanted to characterize the spreading of virus particlesized molecules in the ischemic rat brain. For that, we used
magnetic resonance imaging to follow the spreading of magnetic
nanoparticles injected into the subcortical areas of ischemic rat
brain. The rats had undergone a 60 min temporary MCAo 2 days
before the injection. We chose to do the injections on day 2
after the MCAo, since, when studying potential therapeutic agents,
injections before MCAo or closer to the MCAo could have neuroprotective effects that can confound studies of recovery-enhancing
treatments (Liu et al., 2009). We focused on the rostral part of
the ischemic lesion to minimize the number of injection sites and
also to target the cortico-striato-thalamic pathway. Nanoparticle
solution was injected into two subcortical sites in the lesioned
hemisphere, namely the lateral striatum (Fig. 1E) and external
capsule. When examined 10–20 min after the injections, the particles had spread toward and along the white matter underlying
the rostral lesioned cortex (Fig. 2A–C). This pattern of distribution remained largely unchanged over 3 hours (data not shown).
To compare the spreading and diffusion of virus-sized particles
in ischemic and unlesioned brain, we also injected nanoparticles
into the brain of a naïve rat using the same stereotaxic injection coordinates. The intrastriatally injected nanoparticles were
mostly conﬁned to the striatum in the naïve animal (Fig. 2D),
and, therefore, had spread differently compared to the lesion brain

represented by example images from four different animals, showing relatively large (A and C) and small (B and D) cortical lesions, as determined by T2-weighted magnetic
resonance imaging (A and B) or TTC staining (C and D) on day 2 after surgery. Note that the lesion is limited to the cortex. The images are taken from position approx. 1.0 mm
anterior to bregma (A/P +1.0). (E) Schematic representation of the cortical infarct (black area), peri-infarct region (hatched area) and the approximate position of injection

rat brain injected with dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticles into the striatum (A, site 1, A/P +1.6) and, in a more caudal position, into external capsule (B, site 2, A/P
−0.4). (C) The spreading of nanoparticles along the white matter is also evident when imaged in the horizontal plane. (D) Distribution of injected magnetic nanoparticles in
unlesioned brain. The injection sites are marked with arrows. The MRI scans were taken 10–20 min after injection into the second site.

(Fig. 2C). The difference in the distribution of nanoparticles in
unlesioned versus lesioned brain can be partly due to the edema
which is causing a midline shift (misalignment of the brain midline relative to bregma, most clearly seen on Fig. 2B), but there is
also a clear difference in the spreading of nanoparticles injected
into the striatum (compare site 1 on Fig. 2C and D) (see discussion).
Next, we used the same stereotaxic coordinates to inject adenoassociated virus expressing enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein
(dsAAV7-eGFP) into the brains of rats with cortical ischemic lesion
from the MCAo surgery done 2 days earlier. A double-stranded
rather than single-stranded AAV vector was chosen, based on the
improved speed of transduction, higher level of gene expression
and expression stability of the former (Wang et al., 2003). After the
injection, the animals were left to recover for 12 days, after which
they were sacriﬁced and the pattern of eGFP expression was determined by immunohistochemical staining. Based on the anti-GFP
immunoreactivity, virus-transduced cells were detected mostly
around the cortical ischemic lesion and also in a ventrally extending
area around the external capsule (Fig. 3). More speciﬁcally, coronal
sections proximal to the injection sites had eGFP-positive cells in
the external capsule and in the adjacent lateral striatum (Fig. 3M).
eGFP expression could also be seen above the external capsule in
the peri-infarct cortex, mostly in the deeper cortical layers adjacent
to the necrotic tissue of the core region (Fig. 3A, B, D, E, G, H and
M). However, on some coronal brain sections eGFP expression was
absent in the dorsal part of peri-infarct cortex (Fig. 3D, indicated by
*). eGFP-expressing cells could be seen in the proximity of external
capsule in coronal sections taken from positions 3–4 mm caudal to
the injection site (Fig. 3F and I) and in some cases at positions even

farther (approx. 6 mm caudal to the bregma; data not shown). The
extent of eGFP expression in the caudal direction was apparently
dependent on the size of the lesion, as smaller lesions resulted in
more restricted distribution of eGFP-positive cells (compare Fig. 3C
to Fig. 3F and I). On these more caudal sections eGFP expression
could also be detected in the thalamus (Fig. 3C, F and I). In the
unlesioned rat brain, dsAAV7-eGFP transduced cells almost exclusively in the striatum (Fig. 3J), just as predicted by the distribution
of injected nanoparticles. In summary, when the AAV-vectors were
injected into subcortical areas in lesioned rat brain, they transduced
cells in both the subcortical and cortical areas of the peri-infarct
region.
We next examined whether the peri-infarct targeting was speciﬁc for eGFP or could be used for other genes as well. We chose
to study whether a potentially therapeutic protein could be similarly targeted to the peri-infarct region. For this we injected
an AAV-vector encoding the human cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (dsAAV7-hCDNF), a protein that has been shown
to be neurorestorative and to reverse the neurological deﬁcits
in the rodent models of Parkinson’s disease (Airavaara et al.,
2012; Lindholm et al., 2007; Ren et al., 2013), but is yet to be
tested in models of cerebral ischemia. The observed distribution
of hCDNF-expressing cells indicated that the expression of other
genes besides eGFP can also be targeted to the peri-infarct region
(Fig. 4).
By now we have used these injection coordinates in the injection
of 34 rats with ischemic lesion, and seen a similar AAV-transduction
pattern in all of them. The infarct volumes have ranged from 188 to
426 mm3 (average +/− SEM; 281 +/− 13.5 mm3 ) as determined by
T2-weighted MRI on day 2 after MCAo. In summary, the method of

with dsAAV7-eGFP (A–I) or control AAV (dsAAV7-hMANF, human mesencephalic
astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor) (K) into two sites on day 2 after MCAo surgery
and sacriﬁced 12 days after the injection. Coronal sections of the lesioned cerebral
hemisphere were immunostained using anti-GFP antibody. Sections from positions
close to site 1 at approx. A/P +1.6 (A, D, G, J), site 2 at approx. A/P −0.4 (B, E, H, K) and
more caudal from the injection site (C, F, I) are presented. The core of the ischemic
lesion is outlined. (J) anti-GFP immunostaining in unlesioned rat brain injected

In this study we have characterized a straightforward and practical way to target different genes to the peri-infarct region of rats
without the need to analyze each rat’s stroke volume individually.
This was achieved by combining a cortical ischemic injury model
with subcortical injection of AAV-vector near the infarct on day
two after the stroke surgery. This method, described here in detail,
can potentially be useful for studying the role of human and rodent
proteins in the recovery process after stroke.
Recovery from stroke, on the level of cognitive and behavioral
ability, reﬂects both behavioral compensation (Whishaw, 2000)
and true recovery in sensory or motor function e.g. regain of control
over a certain limb muscle. Changes that underlie recovery from
cortical ischemic lesion can take place in areas distant from the
site of ischemic infarct, such as rearrangements in the contralesional hemisphere or brainstem (Reitmeir et al., 2011; Takatsuru
et al., 2009). Perhaps even more important to the recovery of
function is the remodeling of connections made by neurons that
reside in the peri-infarct region (Brown et al., 2009; Winship and
Murphy, 2008), which may also include connections to distant
sites e.g. thalamus or contralateral cortex. The method of AAVmediated targeting of genes to the peri-infarct region, which we
have characterized here, could be used to study neuronal repair
and remodeling of connections in this region directly e.g. by overexpressing or knocking down expression of a neurotrophic factor or

112

a neurite guidance cue molecule. Furthermore, the method may be
used to inﬂuence neuronal repair and connectivity in a more indirect manner e.g. by inﬂuencing local inﬂammation, angiogenesis or
remyelination. Our ﬁndings could be especially useful for modulating recovery mechanisms that involve changes in the peri-infarct
white matter, as most of the AAV-transduced cells were observed
in or adjacent to the external capsule. The corpus callosum, for
example, is a source of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (Roy et al.,
1999) and an increased density of these cells and myelinating
oligodendrocytes in the peri-infarct striatum has been shown to
correlate with recovery of motor function in rat MCAo model
(Zhang et al., 2010). As additional examples, functional recovery
has been shown to correlate with increased thickness of corpus
callosum and white matter remodeling (Liu et al., 2011; Shen et al.,
2006).
Regardless of which cellular process is affected, restricting the
targeting to the peri-infarct region allows one to attribute the
resulting functional changes with greater certainty to alterations
to that area. In addition, the restricted targeting helps to minimize
possible side-effects of the injected agent. As a limitation of our
method, the distribution of AAV-transduced cells was not uniform
in the peri-infarct cortex, being especially variable in the cortical
area dorsal to the ischemic lesion. We have focused on the rostral
part of the lesion and, therefore, do not know whether injecting
into more caudal positions would result in a similar distribution
of virus-transduced cells. However, even with the injection sites
used in this study, we saw viral vector-transduced cells in subcortical peri-infarct region several millimeters caudal to the site
of injection. It is left for future studies to reveal whether varying
the needle insertion coordinates results in altered distribution of
transduced cells. Similarly, we leave it to future studies to determine the importance of the time of injection i.e. the optimal time for
injection and whether there is a critical time-window for achieving the peri-infarct distribution. In this study we have only done
injections on day 2 after the MCAo surgery to show that it is possible to achieve the expression of AAV vector-delivered genes in the
peri-infarct region at the time when most of the ischemic cell death
has already taken place (Liu et al., 2009). Thereby one can exclude
the possible effects of the treatment on cell survival and get a more
correct estimate of its effect on the above-mentioned mechanisms
of recovery. It is possible that injections done on day 1 or after day
2 can result in different distribution of the vector, since the edema
is decreased over time (see below). It should also be emphasized
that the onset of expression can vary depending on the AAV type
used (Lim et al., 2010).
The appeal of the method presented here lies in our observation that AAV injections, using the same coordinates for all rats,
resulted in comparable transduction patterns in all MCAo-lesioned
brains that presented a range of lesion sizes (34 animals have been
analyzed so far). Thus, the consistent spreading of AAV particles
to the peri-infarct region, despite the variability in the lesion size
and position, offers great promise for vector delivery in the MCAo
model. This consistency is remarkable because the actual position
of the injection needle was dependent on the midline shift, which is
caused by the edema and is itself dependent on the size of the lesion.
The similarity of AAV-transduction pattern in all lesioned rats can
partly be explained by the altered properties of brain tissue on day
2 after the ischemic insult, which facilitate the spreading of intrastriatally injected virus-sized particles toward and along the white
matter tract. In our experiments this manifested in the observations
that the spreading of intrastriatally injected virus-sized nanoparticles was different in unlesioned versus lesioned brain. This was
well in agreement with the different AAV-eGFP transduction patterns seen in unlesioned versus lesioned brain. These results show
that the changed properties of post-ischemic brain make it possible to target the expression of AAV vector-delivered genes to

the peri-infarct region by subcortical injections. We want to stress
that, despite the robust and consistent delivery by our method,
it is unlikely that the speciﬁc injection site coordinates we have
used will be applicable to targeting the peri-infarct region in
other models of focal cerebral ischemia. For example, targeting the
peri-infarct region in models of lacunar stroke, requires empirical
determination of injection coordinates as the direction and extent
of virus particle spreading is likely dependent on the extent of the
edema and orientation of nearby white matter tracts. However,
given the apparent prominence of spreading along the corpus callosum/external capsule, it is probable that the peri-infarct region
can be comparably targeted in other ischemic models in which the
lesion occurs in the cortex. Targeting the expression of therapeutic
genes to the peri-infarct region could perhaps be a way to enhance
functional recovery in focal ischemia patients. However, translation
of this approach from animal experiments is difﬁcult because of the
challenges that intracranial injection in human patients imposes.
5. Conclusion
We demonstrate a straightforward and robust way to target AAV
vector-mediated over-expression of genes to the peri-infarct region
in a rat stroke model. This method will be useful for investigating
the role of speciﬁc proteins in the peri-infarct region during the
recovery process after stroke.
