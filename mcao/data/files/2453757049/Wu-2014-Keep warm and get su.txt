Intraluminal suture middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model is the most frequently used model
for ischemic stroke. However, the success rate of this model is variable among different research studies. This study aimed to investigate the effect of postischemic temperature on the success rate. A total
of 100 C57BL/6 mice were randomized into two groups: control group (n = 50), body temperature was
allowed to self-regulate after MCAO; temperature-controlled group (n = 50), mice were kept warm in an
incubator for 12 h after MCAO. The body temperature of animals was measured before, during, and for
12 h after MCAO. Neurological deﬁcits and infarct volumes were measured at 24 h after MCAO. There was
signiﬁcant difference (P < 0.05) of the body temperature between the two groups from 0.5 h to 3.5 h post
ischemia. Moreover, there was obvious difference between the success rates of the two groups (control
group: 52%, temperature-controlled group: 84%, P < 0.05). In the successful models, infarct volume was
signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) higher in temperature-controlled group (53.44% ± 9.83%, n = 42) than control group
(45.63% ± 10.24%, n = 26). There was signiﬁcant difference of the modiﬁed neurological severity scores
(P < 0.05), left adhesive tests (P < 0.05) between the two groups. Our data demonstrated that postischemic
warming contributed to the success of mouse MCAO model.

1. Introduction
Stroke, 87% of which is ischemic stroke, is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity (Go et al., 2013; Liu,
2013). However, there is only one evidence-based effective treatment, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, in current clinical
practice for ischemic stroke (Abou-Chebl, 2012; Jiang et al., 2012b).
To elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke, many
kinds of animal models have been developed during last decades
(Jiang et al., 2012a). The intraluminal suture middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) model ﬁrstly developed in rats by Koizumi

et al. (1986) has become the most widely used stroke model. This
model is easy to perform, minimally invasive, and does not require
craniectomy (Carmichael, 2005).
The intraluminal suture MCAO model was introduced into
mouse by Chan et al. (1993). Due to the genetically modiﬁed
(transgenic or knockout) mouse strains which provide a unique
opportunity to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of
ischemic stroke, this mouse model has attracted increasing attention. Although many efforts have been made to improve this model
(Ansari et al., 2011; Belayev et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2008; Xue
et al., 2001), the success rate remains unsatisfying and is diverse
among different studies. This might contribute to bias in preclinical
research studies which led to the failure of many neuroprotective
therapeutics.
Previous research studies found that hypothermia reduced
(Florian et al., 2008; Miyazawa et al., 2003; Ohta et al., 2007) and
hyperthermia exacerbated (Noor et al., 2003; Noor et al., 2005)
ischemic brain injury; accordingly, ﬂuctuation in animal temperature would inﬂuence the outcome of stroke. Barber et al. (2004)
found that after intraluminal suture MCAO, mild hypothermia
occurred in mice and alleviated ischemic injury. However, most
of research studies just kept the mouse warm during surgery by
heating pad while few of them controlled temperature in the
postischemic period (Barber et al., 2004). Therefore, we intended

to investigate whether postischemic body temperature of mice
(controlled temperature or spontaneous hypothermia after MCAO
procedure) had an impact on the success rate and outcome of
mouse intraluminal suture MCAO model.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animal preparation
One hundred adult male C57BL/6 mice weighing 23 g to 25 g
(7–8 W) were used in the present study. Animals were purchased
from Model Animal Research Institute of Nanjing University (Nanjing, Jiangsu, China). All protocols were approved by the animal
subjects review board of Jinling Hospital. All procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No.
80-23, revised 1996). All efforts were made to minimize the number
of mice used and their suffering.
All animals were fasted overnight before surgery, but were
allowed free access to water. Mice were housed in controlled environment with ambient temperature of 25 ◦ C, relative humidity of
65% and 12 h light/dark cycle. Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).
2.2. Experimental groups
The mice used in this study were randomized into two groups,
temperature-controlled group (n = 50), in which mice went through
90-min brain ischemia during which body temperature was controlled at 37 ◦ C, and subsequently were kept warm at >35 ◦ C for 12 h
in an incubator (Guohua Instruments Corp., Changzhou, China);
control group (n = 50), in which mice received 90-min MCAO during which body temperature of mice was also controlled at 37 ◦ C,
thereafter mice were allowed to self-regulate body temperature
in the cages at 25 ◦ C. The whole experiment design was shown in
Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. Schematic of the experimental design. One hundred mice were randomized
into two groups: control group (n = 50) and temperature-controlled group (n = 50).
All of the mice underwent MCAO. The body temperature was monitored before,
during and for 12 h after the MCAO procedure. A battery of behavioral tests were
performed in all mice at 1 day after MCAO. At 24 h post ischemic onset, infarct
volumes were detected by 2, 3, 5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC). Infarction
involving only the striatum but not cortex was regarded as failed model. Only data
of successful models was used for the statistical analysis of neurological deﬁcits and
infarct volume.

incubator set at approximately 42 ◦ C to keep warm or put back into
the cage at 25 ◦ C to allow self-regulate body temperature.
2.4. Physiological monitoring

2.3. Transient focal ischemia
The MCAO procedure has been described before (Jiang et al.,
2010). Mouse was anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium
(50 mg/kg i.p.) and placed in an operating table with a feedback
regulated heating pad (RS Biomedtech). After cutting off hair in
the cervix and sterilizing the skin, we cut open the skin along the
cervical midline and dissected the paratracheal muscles bluntly
under the operating microscope (Reward Technology Crop., Shenzhen, China). When the right common carotid artery (CCA), external
carotid artery (ECA), and internal carotid artery (ICA) were exposed
and isolated, two 6-0 sutures were tied at the proximal and distal
end of the ECA. The ECA was then cut distal to the superior thyroid artery after two microclips were temporarily placed on the
right CCA and ICA. Thereafter, a small hole was cut in the right ECA
between the two locations tied with sutures, a silicone-coated 60 nylon monoﬁlament was gently inserted from the hole into the
right ECA. After the suture tied at the proximal end of the ECA was
loosed, the silicone-coated 6-0 nylon monoﬁlament was advanced
from ECA into the lumen of ICA until the ipsilateral blood ﬂow of
middle cerebral artery supply territory decreased to below 30% of
the baseline monitored by a laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (LDF; Perimed
PF 5000, Stockholm, Sweden). Then the suture at the proximal was
tied again and skin was sewed up. During the whole procedure,
rectal temperature was maintained at 37 ◦ C. After 90 min, mouse
was brieﬂy reanesthetized and the ﬁlament was removed to allow
reperfusion. At the onset of reperfusion, mouse was put into an

Animal weight was recorded before and 24 h after MCAO via
a small animal balance (Jinling Technology Crop., Nanjing, China).
After the ventral tail artery was isolated and cannulated, arterial
blood pressure was measured during surgery. One sample of arterial blood (0.3 ml) was acquired before reperfusion for the test of
PaO2 , PaCO2 , pH and blood glucose (Table 1).
2.5. Temperature monitoring
Rectal temperature was monitored continuously and maintained at 37.0 ◦ C during MCAO procedure via a thermostatically
feedback-regulated heating pad. Rectal temperature was monitored and recorded before surgery, and at 0 h, 5 h, 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h,
2.5 h, 3 h, 3.5 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 7 h, 8 h, 9 h, 10 h, 11 h, 12 h after MCAO

China).
2.6. Behavioral test
In all mice, a battery of behavioral tests was performed 1 day
after MCAO by two coworkers who were blind to the experimental
design. Only the data of successful models was used for analysis.
2.6.1. Accelerated rotarod test
The accelerated rotarod test was used to assess motor coordination and balance alterations after brain ischemia. Brieﬂy, mice were
placed on an rotarod cylinder (NatureGene Crop., Beijing, China),
which rotating from 4 rpm to 40 rpm over two min, the time the
animals remained on the rotarod was measured (maximum record
time: 120 s). A trial ended if the animal fell off the rotarod or gripped
the device and spun around for two consecutive rotations without
walking on the rotarod. The animals were trained one time per
day since 5 days before MCAO. Each mouse was tested three times
a day (inter-trial interval, ITI: 5 min) at Day −1 (one day before
MCAO) and Day + 1 (one day after MCAO). The mean duration on
the device was recorded. The results were presented as percentage of mean duration on the rotarod compared with the internal
baseline control (Day −1).
2.6.2. Adhesive removal test
To evaluate sensorimotor deﬁcits after MCAO, the adhesive
removal test was performed. Before each test, the mouse was
placed into a transparent box (15 cm × 25 cm) for a 60 s habituation period. Thereafter, two adhesive tapes of equal size
(0.3 cm × 0.4 cm) were applied on the hairless part of each forepaw
(i.e. the three pads, thenar and hypothenar) with an equal pressure. The mouse was then replaced in the transparent box, and the
earliest time to perceive and to remove each adhesive tape were
collected simultaneously by two investigators. Mice were trained
twice daily for 5 consecutive days before surgery to obtain an optimal level of performance limited inter-individual variations. One
day after MCAO, mice received this test again. The results were
presented as the time (seconds) to perceive and remove tapes.

blind to this experiment using Image J (Wayne Rasband, NIH, USA).
The infarct volume was then calculated via Swanson’s method and
presented as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere volume
according to our previous manuscript (Jiang et al., 2011). Infarction
involving only the striatum but not cortex was regarded as failed
model.
2.8. Statistical analysis
Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 17.0;
SPSS, Chicago, IL). The differences between the two groups were
analyzed by t-test. Statistical signiﬁcance was deﬁned as P < 0.05.
Histograms and diagrams were constructed with Graphpad Prism
(version 5.0; GraphPad Software, Inc., CA).
3. Results

2.6.3. Modiﬁed neurological severity scores (mNSS)
Each mouse was subjected to a set of mNSS to evaluate neurological function at 1 day before and 1 day after the onset of
ischemia, and the scores were assessed by two investigators blind
to the experimental groups. mNSS is a functional test used to assess
motor, sensory, reﬂex and balance deﬁcits, detailed score points
could be found in a previous study (Chen et al., 2001). The score was
graded on a scale of 0 to 18 (normal score, 0; maximal deﬁcit score,
18). In the severity scores of injury, 1 score point was awarded for
the inability to perform the test or the lack of a tested reﬂex; thus,
the higher score, the more severe the injury was. Mild injury was
indicated by a score of 1 to 6, moderate injury 7 to 12, and severe
injury 13 to 18.

3.1. Physiological monitoring

2.7. Evaluation of infarct volume

Baseline body temperature, which was collected prior to
MCAO, was similar between the two groups (control group:
37.30 ± 0.20 ◦ C, temperature-controlled group: 37.27 ± 0.22 ◦ C,
P > 0.05) .In the control group, the rectal temperature decreased
after MCAO (from 0.5 h to 10 h, P < 0.05) compared to the baseline
and it was declined to its bottom (33.23 ± 0.57 ◦ C) at 1 h after MCAO
and elevated thereafter. At 12 h after MCAO, the temperature of
control group eventually returned to normal without signiﬁcant
difference compared to baseline (37.11 ± 0.30, P = 0.156).Though
the mice in the temperature-controlled group were kept in the
incubator set at 37 ◦ C, it was lower than baseline (P < 0.05) from
0.5 h to 7 h after MCAO. There was signiﬁcant difference in the

At 24 h after MCAO, mice were deeply anesthetized and sacriﬁced. The brains were quickly removed and frozen at −80 ◦ C for
two min. Frozen brains were sliced into uniform sections of 1 mm
thickness via a mouse brain matrix (Activational Systems, MI, USA).
These slices were incubated in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4)
containing 2% 2, 3, 5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) at 37 ◦ C
for 20 min and ﬁxed by immersion in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Then slices were neatly arranged, captured with a scanner
(Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P., Palo Artaud, CA,
USA). The infarct area of each slice was measured by a investigator

There was no signiﬁcant difference of weight between the control and temperature-controlled group both before (25.85 ± 1.60 g
vs. 25.80 ± 1.82 g, P > 0.05) and 24 h after MCAO (23.40 ± 1.64 g
vs. 22.64 ± 1.87 g, P > 0.05). After MCAO, cortical blood ﬂow (CBF)
decreased to 17.54 ± 2.30% of the baseline and there was no
signiﬁcant difference between control group (17.68 ± 2.22%) and
temperature-controlled group (17.40 ± 2.43%, P = 0.709). The blood
pressure, blood gas and blood glucose recordings were presented
in Table 1.

temperature from 0.5 h to 3.5 h (P < 0.05) after MCAO between control group and temperature-controlled group. The ﬂuctuation of
body temperature was shown in Fig. 2.
3.3. Success rate and mortality rate
Twenty-six out of 50 mice in control group were modeled successfully (52%) while forty-two (84%) in temperature-controlled
group (n = 50). There was signiﬁcant difference between the success rates of two groups (P < 0.05, Fig. 3A). Though three mice died in
control group (6%) and six in temperature-controlled group (12%),
no obvious difference (P = 0.487, Fig. 3B) was found.
3.4. Infarct volume
Infarct volume at 24 h was signiﬁcantly (P > 0.05, Fig. 4B) higher
in temperature-controlled group (53.44 ± 9.83%, n = 42) than that
in control group (45.63 ± 10.24%, n = 26). Representative photos
demonstrating (Fig. 4A(a)) failed modeling and (Fig. 4A(b) and (c))
different degrees of brain infarct were shown in Fig. 4A.
3.5. Behavioral deﬁcits
The mean mNSS of temperature-controlled group was higher
than the score of control group (8.80 ± 3.24 vs. 6.67 ± 2.61, P < 0.05,
Fig. 5A). Although the duration of accelerated rotarod test trended
to be improved in control group, there was no signiﬁcant difference between the two groups (control group: 12.71 ± 4.91%,
temperature-controlled group: 10.09 ± 4.55%, P = 0.072, Fig. 5B).
The time to perceive (P = 0.006) and remove (P = 0.015) left adhesive tapes was signiﬁcantly longer in temperature-controlled group

(perceive: 46.35 ± 21.31 s, remove: 75.86 ± 27.97 s) than the time in
control group (perceive: 29.40 ± 12.59 s, remove: 55.87 ± 19.97 s).
However there was no obvious difference on the right side
between the two groups (control group, perceive: 10.73 ± 4.53 s,
remove: 53.27 ± 23.01 s; temperature-controlled group, perceive:
12.16 ± 5.90 s, remove: 66.49 ± 28.66 s, Fig. 5C).
4. Discussion
In this study, our results revealed that postischemic
temperature-controlled process improved the success rate
while spontaneous hypothermia occurred after MCAO reduced
success rate of mouse MCAO model and infarct volume and even
improved sensorimotor function after ischemia.
In the present study, we found that rectal temperature of mice
decreased after MCAO even put in the incubator set at 37 ◦ C. And the
temperature-controlled mice recovered to normal temperature 8 h
after MCAO while spontaneous hypothermia needed at least 12 h
to restore the physiological temperature. These results were consistent with previous research (Barber et al., 2004). The underlying
mechanism of spontaneous hypothermia might be hypothalamus
insult. Hypothalamic damage occurs in both rat and mouse species,
but the large surface area/volume of the mouse leads to temperature loss in the postoperative period (Carmichael, 2005). Although
hypothalamus damage was not counted the in this study, we indeed
detected hypothalamus injury in some mice.
The signiﬁcant difference of temperature led to different
successful rates. We observed much higher success rate in
temperature-controlled group (84%) than control group (52%)
while there was no obvious difference of mortality between the
two groups. In other words, controlled temperature guaranteed

high enough success rate without increasing the mortality rate. The
success rate is quite important for the intraluminal suture MCAO
model to be extended to the studies using expensive genetically
manipulated animal research subjects.
A very interesting and important phenomenon in our study was
that controlled temperature not only increased the successful rate,
but also the infarct volume. We assessed the infract volume in
successful MCAO models and found that the infarct volume was
signiﬁcantly higher in temperature-controlled group than that in
control group.
Moreover, our data showed that neurological function was
also inﬂuenced by temperature. For the evaluation of neurological deﬁcits, there was obvious difference of the mNSS, the time to
perceive and remove left adhesive tapes between the two groups.
The histological results and assessment of neurological deﬁcits conﬁrmed reduced injury in spontaneous hypothermia group (control
group). These results were supported by other studies (Horn et al.,
2013; Kim et al., 2013; Park et al., 2013; Zgavc et al., 2013). Inducible
exogenous hypothermia is considered as one of the most powerful
therapeutic strategies in acute ischemic stroke (Lyden et al., 2006;
Wu and Grotta, 2013), and it is the only neuroprotective treatment
that has been shown to improve neurological outcomes in clinical
trials.
In addition to its metabolic effects, hypothermia could activate
numerous pathways simultaneously through several mechanisms
during the ischemic and reperfusion window, and attenuate damage beyond the neuron to include the entire neurovascular unit
(Lampe and Becker, 2011; Zhao et al., 2007). Busto et al. (1989)
showed that cooling of the ischemic rat brain to 33 ◦ C suppressed
almost all glutamate release and inhibited more than half of
dopamine release. Hypothermia could also reduce the number
of 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazol-4-yl) propanoic acid
(AMPA) and N-Methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors expressed

on hippocampal neurons after global ischemia, and this action has
been reported to be associated with reduced infarct size in some
studies (Friedman et al., 2001; Li et al., 2011). In addition, hypothermia could exert neuroprotective function through modulating the
inﬂammatory and apoptotic pathways of ischemic stroke (Alam
et al., 2011; Ceulemans et al., 2010; Li and Wang, 2011).
In summary, our results demonstrated that post ischemic temperature was the key issue of successful intraluminal suture MCAO
model.
