The treatments for ischemic stroke can only be administered in a narrow time-window. However, the ischemia onset time is
unknown in ~ 30% of stroke patients (wake-up strokes). The objective of this study was to determine whether MR spectra of
ischemic brains might allow the precise estimation of cerebral ischemia onset time. We modeled ischemic stroke in male ICR-CD1
mice using a permanent middle cerebral artery ﬁlament occlusion model with laser Doppler control of the regional cerebral blood
ﬂow. Mice were then subjected to repeated MRS measurements of ipsilateral striatum at 14.1 T. A striking initial increase in
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and no increase in glutamine were observed. A steady decline was observed for taurine (Tau), N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and similarly for the sum of NAA+Tau+glutamate that mimicked an exponential function. The estimation of the
time of onset of permanent ischemia within 6 hours in a blinded experiment with mice showed an accuracy of 33 ± 10 minutes. A
plot of GABA, Tau, and neuronal marker concentrations against the ratio of acetate/NAA allowed precise separation of mice whose
ischemia onset lay within arbitrarily chosen time-windows. We conclude that 1H-MRS has the potential to detect the clinically
relevant time of onset of ischemic stroke.

INTRODUCTION
The time of symptom onset is a critical parameter for the
management of acute ischemic stroke patients as the therapeutic
window is limited to 4.5 hours for thrombolysis,1 6 hours for
intraarterial recanalization procedures2 and 9 hours for desmoteplase (Desmoteplase in Acute Ischemic Stroke Trial, DIAS).3 However, a signiﬁcant number of patients have an unknown time of
onset as the stroke occurred during their sleep, which disqualiﬁes
them for thrombolytic treatment. Therefore, knowing the precise
onset time of the ischemic insult would help determine whether a
given patient can be treated or not.4,5
We have previously shown in mice that 1H magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (1H-MRS)6 can reliably estimate at a very early time
point the severity of cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) and distinguish transient ischemic attacks
from minor strokes or moderate strokes based on metabolite
concentrations in the ipsilateral striatum,7 the ischemic core.8 In
particular, a scatter plot of a combination score of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), glutamate (Glu), and taurine (Tau) against
glutamine (Gln), accurately measured in the infarcted striatal
region 3 hours after ischemia onset, allowed the separation of
moderate strokes, resulting from 30-minute MCAO, from minor

strokes and transient ischemic attacks induced by 10-minute
MCAO and shams.7
We now applied the same noninvasive approach7,9–11 to a more
severe model of stroke, permanent ischemia (MCAO without
reperfusion) in mice. Permanent ischemia is a condition observed
in stroke patients in need of revascularization.1–3,12 Our aim was to
follow the evolution of spectral changes in the ischemic core13
after MCAO without reperfusion by examining animals at different
time points after ischemia and correlating spectral changes to the
progression of ischemic damage. This allows the identiﬁcation of
potential biomarkers, which might be further used to estimate the
time of ischemia onset.

technique as previously described.14 Speciﬁcally, mice were anesthetized
and kept in 1.5% to 2% isoﬂurane with 30% oxygen and 70% nitrous oxide
using a facemask. At 0 hours, permanent ischemia was induced by
inserting a silicone-coated nylon ﬁlament (diameter: 0.17 mm, Doccol,
Redlands, CA, USA) through the left common carotid artery into the
internal carotid artery. Throughout surgery and until awakening, the blood
ﬂow was monitored with a laser Doppler (Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden)
and the rectal temperature of the animal was maintained at 37 ± 0.5°C with
a temperature control unit (FHC, Bowdoin, ME, USA). Ischemia induction
was considered successful if the blood ﬂow dropped under 20% of the
baseline.
Four mice died and were not measured. Four were excluded because of
the loss of Doppler monitoring signals during the ischemia period, absence
of elevated creatine levels within 1 hour of ischemia onset, or no ischemic
lesion detected by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging at 24 hours
(described later). In addition, the sham group, which underwent the same
procedure without any artery ligation or suture insertion, was taken from a
previous study.7

Magnetic Resonance Instrumentation and Methods
After permanent MCAO, animals were carefully prepared, positioned, and
placed in a horizontal bore (inner diameter 26 cm) 14.1 T magnet (Magnex,
Oxford, UK).

T2-weighted images (fast spin echo imaging, ETL = 8, effective echo time
and repetition time: TEeff/TR = 50/5,000 ms, four scans) were acquired to
measure the anatomic structure to localize accurately the volumes of
interest and also to monitor the development of T2-hyperintensive
vasogenic edema. After ﬁeld homogeneity optimization for the target
volume, localized 1H-MR spectra11 were obtained from the ipsilateral
striatum (6 to 8 μL volumes of interest) at different time points up to
25 hours after permanent MCAO. To compare with previous transient
MCAO studies,7 the current 1H-MRS studies were carefully arranged to
obtain a sufﬁcient population (i.e. n ⩾ 5) for the selected time points after
permanent MCAO: 1, 3, 8, and 24 hours.
Brain swelling reﬂects the edema formation after stroke.15 Brain swelling

Data Analysis
The acquired 1H-MR spectra were processed as previously described.7,11
Speciﬁcally, all spectra were frequency corrected, summed, and compensated for eddy currents for further quantiﬁcation using a home-developed
Matlab package. Previous studies showed that brain swelling with a
hemispheric volume increase of 20% corresponds to a water content
increase of ~ 4% to 5%.15 Such an increase would only contribute

H-MRS measurement errors, i.e. 10%. Therefore, the MR spectra were
quantiﬁed using LCModel (Linear Combination MODEL16) assuming 80%
water content and were scaled accordingly only in the case of brain swelling
beyond 20%.15 Unaltered patterns of macromolecules were assumed based
on previous transient ischemia and results,7,11 and thereafter conﬁrmed by
evaluating whether the spectrum ﬁt residues were ﬂat.
All statistical tests, i.e. Student's t-test and two-way analysis of variance,
and ﬁtting procedures were carried on GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA, USA). P values less than 0.05 were considered
signiﬁcant.

Ischemia Onset Time Estimation
To evaluate the feasibility of ischemic onset time estimation within timelimited treatment windows,5 eighteen permanent ischemia or shamoperated mice were measured by 1H-MRS by an observer blinded to the
time of ischemia onset and who estimated ischemia onset time based on
the acquired metabolite contents. Among these mice, three were excluded
because of unsatisfactory blood ﬂow, i.e. 420% of the baseline, which
attenuated the induced ischemic damage.17 One mouse was measured at
two different time points. The ischemia onset time was calculated based
Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2014), 1848 – 1855

on the measured metabolite content and the corresponding best ﬁt. The
estimation error for each predicted value was calculated using error
propagation, calculated error.
MR measurement times of mice in this blinded experiment were set to
00:00 (hh:mm), both real permanent ischemia onset (PIO) time and the
estimated PIO time were expressed relative to the MR measurement
time point.

RESULTS
T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and 1H-MRS were
carried out on 32 mice subjected to permanent MCAO at various
time points. Permanent ischemia induces a T2-hyperintensive
signal due to edema in the striatum and cortex; visible by 3 hours
and thereafter, both the edema size and T2-weighted signal
intensity increase at 8 hours and 24 hours (Figure 1A). Brain
swelling was not observed at 1 hour (−0.1 ± 0.9% of contralateral
hemisphere volume), became visible after 3 hours (7.6 ± 2.7%),
continued increasing at 8 hours (11.2 ± 2.5%) and increased
to 20.0 ± 2.6% at 24 hours, indicating that our metabolite

measurements were not signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by variable water
contents due to edema.
Spectral analysis was carried out in the ipsilateral striatum,
which was identiﬁed in the T2-weighted images (Figure 1A, inset
images). Upon visual inspection, MR spectra showed highly
elevated γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and more so increased
lactate already 1 hour after ischemia, which remained elevated
until 8 hours and 24 hours after ischemia, respectively (Figure 1).
Elevated lactate concentration was accompanied by diminished
glucose (Glc) (Figure 1B).
Furthermore, the increased ratio of creatine to phosphocreatine
was visible 1 hour after permanent MCAO (Figure 1, Supplementary
Table 1).
In our study, both Tau and myo-inositol were noticeably
reduced after permanent ischemia (P values o 0.05, Figure 1,
Supplementary Table 1).
The presumed neuronal marker NAA decreased gradually over
time conﬁrming it as a sensitive neuronal viability marker to
ischemia (Figure 1B). The sum of NAA+Tau+Glu decreased
gradually after permanent ischemia (Figure 2D) suggesting this
score could be used as a marker of neuronal damage after both
transient and permanent focal cerebral ischemia.
Acetate (Ace) becomes detectable and rises further after
permanent ischemia (Figure 1B), whereas aspartate does not rise.
This was further veriﬁed at a moderate echo time, i.e., TE = 40 ms,
in which an Ace resonance remained, whereas the GABA signals
were minimized because of J-evolution (Supplementary Figure 1).
After ischemia onset, the Glu and Gln decreased, with a steeper
decline for Gln (Figure 1B). However, both GABA and glycine
increased and remained above those of the sham-operated mice
© 2014 ISCBFM

at 8 hours (Figure 1B). Particularly, GABA rose within 1 hour,
peaked at ~ 3 hours, and returned to normal levels by 24 hours
(Figure 1B and Supplementary Table 1).
Spectral changes also suggested disturbed cellular proliferation
and membrane integrity, shown by the reduction in total choline,
phosphorylethanolamine, and macromolecule. Antioxidants
(ascorbate and glutathione) also decreased, especially from 8
hours after ischemia onset for glutathione. During the entire study
period, we observed no striking alterations in macromolecule
patterns.
To identify potential biomarkers that might allow the estimation
of the onset time of ischemia, we investigated the evolution over
time of metabolite concentrations.
The concentrations of Tau and NAA, as well as the NAA+Tau
+Glu composite score declined in a nearly monoexponential
fashion (Figures 2A, 2B and 2D, goodness-of-ﬁt, R40.95; Supplementary Table 2) while interestingly, GABA showed a two-phase
associated exponential evolution (R = 0.95) (Figure 2C). In contrast
to aspartate, another hydrolytic degradation product of NAA, Ace
displayed an exponential increase (Figure 2E, R = 0.88). When
plotting the evolution of Ace/NAA after permanent MCAO, a linear
correlation with time after ischemia is clearly seen for the entire
time studied (Figure 2F, Pearson R = 0.88), and even more so for
the ﬁrst 10 hours after permanent MCAO (Pearson R = 0.95).
In stroke patients, the therapeutic time-windows are 4.5 hours
for intravenous thrombolysis, 6 hours for intraarterial recanalization, and 9 hours has been used in recent trials such as DIAS.
Arbitrarily and well aware of differences between rodent models
and stroke patients, we chose 6 hours and 9 hours after
permanent MCAO time points to test whether individual MCAOJournal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2014), 1848 – 1855

All MR measurement times of mice used in the permanent ischemia onset (PIO) prediction study were set to 00:00 (hh:mm), as described in Methods. Each
table row contained one set of data analysis based on N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), taurine (Tau), and NAA+Tau+Glu from each blinded measurement. Glu,
glutamate; Conc, measured metabolite contents; Est PIO time, estimation of ischemia onset times using NAA, Tau, and NAA+Tau+Glu decay curves (Figure 3,

operated animals could be classiﬁed using their 1H-MR spectra
within these set time-windows. The Tau and GABA metabolite
changes from all permanent MCAO-operated mice were plotted
against the ratio Ace/NAA. Mice were then separated into three
groups: (1) up to 6 hours (Figure 3, open green circles), the
threshold used for intraarterial recanalization procedures, (2) up to
9 hours (open black triangles), the threshold used in DIAS and (3)
after 9 hours (open red triangles). A clear separation of the three
groups was observed for both the Tau vs Ace/NAA (Figure 3A) and
GABA vs Ace/NAA plots (Figure 3B). Interestingly, an equally good
separation was achieved using Tau and myo-inositol concentrations (Tau+myo-inositol) and the composite concentration score
(NAA+Tau+Glu), shown in Figures 3C and 3D, respectively.
To test the precision of separating mice as either before or after
6 hours, we subjected mice to either permanent MCAO or sham
operation and presented them to a masked observer who carried
out the 1H-MRS analysis. Ten of 1H-MR spectral time points (solid
purple squares and stars in Figure 3), clearly situated the mice to
the within-6-hour (Figure 3, open green circles) group. Among the
ten mice, we observed that one data set did not present high
GABA or lowered Tau (Figure 3, solid purple stars), similar to
neurochemical proﬁles of healthy control mice (white bars in
Figure 1B). We identiﬁed this proﬁle as belonging to a shamoperated animal, without permanent MCAO thereby establishing
that the technique allows us to determine if there was an ischemic
event or not. Three mice showed notably low metabolite contents
exhibiting similar neurochemical proﬁles to mice at 24 hours after
permanent MCAO (solid black bars in Figure 1B) and were
assigned to the 49 hours group, shown as solid black circles in
Figure 3. The remaining two mice were assigned to the 6- to
9-hour group (solid black diamonds in Figure 3). All the estimated
MCAO time points from the spectral analysis agreed exactly with
the ischemia onset time recorded by the mouse surgeon.
We then determined whether we were able to produce a good
estimate of the PIO time based on the metabolite decline curves
determined above (Supplementary Table 2).
Table 1 shows our estimations of ischemia onset time, i.e.,
estimated PIO times, calculated from the decreases of NAA+Tau
+Glu, NAA and Tau (Supplementary Table 2) for mice from the
blinded experiment (0 to 9 hours) and compares them with the
actual permanent MCAO times, real PIO, Table 1. The estimations
based on metabolite decays were very precise for the mice
Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2014), 1848 – 1855

measured within 6 hours from the PIO (Table 1), especially using
the Tau decline (where differences between real and estimated
PIO time range from 5 minutes to 1 hour 9 minutes, 00:41 ± 00:08,
mean ± s.e.m. values) or NAA+Tau+Glu (where the differences
between real and estimated PIO times range from 1 minute to
1 hour 17 minutes, 00:33 ± 00:10). For the two mice measured at
later time points (within 9 hours after PIO), the onset time
estimates were near 2 hours of the real onset time using NAA+Tau
+Glu (2 hours 33 minutes and 1 hour 41 minutes in Table 1).
The estimated ischemia onset of the three MCAO-operated
mice measured after 9 hours (solid black circles in Figure 4) were
all greater than 14 hours, i.e. 16:58 ± 1:06, 24:13 ± 4:07 and
17:22 ± 1:20, respectively.
DISCUSSION
The present study applied localized 1H-MRS to mice subjected to
focal cerebral ischemia without reperfusion, providing in vivo
information on 20 metabolites in the ischemic mouse brain up to
25 hours after ischemia onset and reﬂecting evolution of the tissue
damage. Importantly, we also demonstrate that the metabolite
information obtained can be used to provide a good estimate of the
ischemia onset time within 6 hours after ischemic insults, extremely
relevant if this can be extended to stroke patients and used to
determine whether they qualify for intravenous thrombolytic
treatment or other therapies that have strict therapeutic windows.
In permanent ischemia, the blood supply is interrupted and not
restored. We anticipated a different metabolite evolution pattern
and distinct tissue damage compared with transient ischemia7
and conﬁrmed this by both the T2-weighted images and the MR
spectra (Figure 1). T2-weighted images (Figure 1) showed that in
the permanent ischemia model, the vasogenic edema was not
limited to the striatum as in transient ischemia, but also extended
to the cortex;8 in both regions, T2 hyperintensity was just visible
3 hours after ischemia while clearly visible at 8 hours post
ischemia. This is different from our previously published observations in transient ischemia in which the T2 hyperintensity, if
present, does not appear before 8 hours and is only clearly
observed one day after minor and moderate strokes.7 However,
the brain swelling after permanent MCAO reached 8% at 3 hours
and kept increasing to 11% at 8 hours, both greater than
previously observed in moderate stroke. Even so, this increase in

brain swelling implies an increased water content of ~ 0.7% and
therefore only contributes minimally to variability in the metabolic
results, i.e., less than 1% underestimation, which becomes
negligible compared with experimental error.
The MR spectral patterns in the infarcted striatum in permanent
ischemia revealed a very different proﬁle compared with our
previously published transient ischemia results. For instance, the
decrease of Gln during permanent ischemia (MCAO without
reperfusion) was different from that observed after transient-type
ischemia, i.e., transient ischemic attack (10 minutes transient
ischemia without lesion), minor stroke (10 minutes transient
ischemia with lesion) and moderate stroke (30 minutes transient
ischemia with lesion).7 Furthermore, the sum of NAA+Tau+Glu at
3 hours after permanent ischemia (19.8 ± 1.5 μmol/g) was very
similar to that after moderate stroke at 3 hours (20.8 ± 1.8 μmol/
g).7,11 Thus, plots of Gln against the sum of NAA+Tau+Glu at the
3 hours time point after ischemia allows an excellent separation of
© 2014 ISCBFM

all transient ischemia subtypes (Figure 4A), as well as generating
clear separation between transient and permanent ischemia at a
very early time point.
Of striking interest is the highly elevated GABA in the
permanent ischemia MR spectra (Figure 1). This is consistent with
energy failure favoring anaerobic GABA synthesis as seen in
postmortem tissue.18–24 GABA rises were not detected after
transient ischemia.7,11 This is most likely due to the interruption of
oxygen supply in permanent ischemia. Highly elevated GABA after
permanent ischemia has been reported in focal and global
ischemia studies using ex vivo analysis25 but not yet reported by
direct in vivo measurement.
The combined observation of elevated GABA and decreased Gln
(Figure 2) is distinct from that observed in transient ischemia
subtypes;7 therefore, these changes are potential markers for
permanent ischemia in stroke conditions. A plot of Gln against
GABA at 3 hours presents a well-deﬁned separation of permanent
ischemia from all transient ischemia subtypes (Figure 4B), making
GABA a new biomarker for identifying non-perfused ischemia from
re-perfused subtypes.
To our knowledge, comparing the permanent ischemia results
here with our previously published transient ischemia results
provides the ﬁrst comparison of metabolite changes between
permanent ischemic insults and different severities of transient
ischemic insults, ranging from transient ischemic attacks to
moderate strokes.
Shortly after permanent MCAO, i.e., at 1 hour (Figure 1 and
Supplementary Table 1), highly elevated creatine and reduced
phosphocreatine are observed, and signiﬁes energy failure in
global ischemia26 and hypoglycemia.27 A sudden change in
relative ion concentrations after ischemia would explain the
observed osmoregulation dysfunction,25 for example, the signiﬁcant reduction of Tau and myo-inositol, described in Figure 1
and Supplementary Table 1.
The decreased Gln and Glu concentrations after permanent
MCAO most likely reﬂect cell death with loss of membrane
integrity, as well as energy deﬁcits,28 both of which might impair
neurotransmission, and are similar to published ex vivo results.25
The Gln reduction at the beginning of permanent MCAO implies
that astrocytes are not able to convert the extracellular
accumulated Glu to Gln due to reduced oxygen supply in the
ischemic core. This contrasts to the Gln increase seen in transient
ischemia where astrocytes are able to carry out the conversion
when blood ﬂow is restored.
Moreover, the NAA+Tau+Glu score, identiﬁed as a marker of
irreversibly damaged tissue in transient ischemia,7 remains valid in
permanent ischemia. If translated to clinics, this evaluation of
irreversible damage could be useful for patient management and
patient selection in future neuroprotection trials. Finally, the
accumulation of lactate along with the very low glucose content
observed shortly after permanent MCAO and which remain at
similar levels thereafter, suggests anaerobic glycolysis occurring
with reduced oxygen supply.7
Interestingly, 3 hours after ischemia onset, the NAA concentration in permanent ischemia was reduced29,30 and similar to that
found in minor stroke (Figure 5), whereas at 8 hours after MCAO,
the NAA concentration in permanent ischemia was lower than in
minor stroke but not as low as in moderate stroke.7 The faster NAA
decrease seen in transient ischemia, 8 hours after ischemia onset,
suggests that there is possible secondary damage occurring after
the restoration of blood ﬂow in transient ischemia.31,32 Reperfusion therefore induces damage at early time points, but after
1 day, the damage induced by long-lasting blood supply deﬁcit in
permanent ischemia likely dominates the transient detrimental
effects of reperfusion.
NAA and Tau gradually declined in a monoexponential fashion.
This is likely caused by the lack of restoration of cerebral blood
ﬂow. Previous studies have shown that there is a decline in

osmolytes, an increase in intracellular water content, and accumulation of sodium in the ischemic brain tissue.25,33–36 Interestingly,
sodium magnetic resonance imaging in rats has been proposed as
a way to estimate stroke onset time.36 We hypothesized that the
evolution of these metabolites, e.g., NAA and Tau, after permanent
occlusion might enable evaluation of the ischemia onset time.
In the two decay curves (Figure 2), Tau showed a steeper
decrease than NAA after permanent ischemia, even more so
within 6 hours (Supplementary Table 2). Therefore, we reasoned
that Tau decline would provide superior prediction power of onset
time in this period. Calculation of onset time based on the NAA
concentration alone was, as expected, less precise than Tau alone
(Table 1). When testing mice up to 6 hours after ischemia onset,
we noticed that the estimated onset time from the modeled
declines of the metabolite score NAA+Tau+Glu lay within a
satisfactory range of the real onset time thereby providing good
estimation (Table 1).
Overall, when Tau concentration declines are large, the
predicted ischemia onset times are very accurate; in contrast to
Tau declines that are smaller than the 1H-MRS measurement error
where prediction is less accurate. However, it should be pointed
out that small declines only happen shortly after permanent
ischemia indicative of being very close to the onset time.
Furthermore, the combination score of NAA, Tau and Glu would
improve the estimation precision at very short times after
permanent MCAO (Table 1).
Notably, the linear increase of Ace/NAA (Figure 2F) after
permanent MCAO is reported for the ﬁrst time as well as GABA,
as potential biomarkers for permanent ischemia. Even though the
reason of Ace increase after permanent MCAO remains unclear
but might be caused by NAA degradation,37 the combination of
Ace/NAA with other metabolite(s) such as GABA, NAA+Glu+Tau
(Figure 4) can situate individual animals into potential time-frame
windows allowing to evaluate therapeutic interventions in animal
models of stroke. Importantly, combined with highly improved

H-MRS techniques in clinical platforms,38,39 1H-MRS could
become applicable for future clinical studies on stroke patients.

CONCLUSION
We conclude that 1H-MRS is a powerful noninvasive tool for the
estimation of the onset time of ischemia in mice. The time of
onset is critical and an MRS based estimation of onset time could
be a criterion to decide whether thrombolytic treatment should
be used.
