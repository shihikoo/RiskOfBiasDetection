SUMMARY
Background: Limb remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPostC) has been recognized as an
applicable strategy in protecting against cerebral ischemic injury. However, the time window for application of limb RIPostC and the mechanisms behind RIPostC are still unclear.
Aims: In this study, we investigated the protective efficacy and the role of autophagy in
limb RIPostC using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion rat model. Results: Limb
RIPostC applied in the early phase of reperfusion reduced infarct size and improved neurological function. Autophagy levels in penumbral tissues were elevated in neurons of limb
RIPostC rats, with an increase in the phosphorylation of AKT and glycogen synthase kinase
3b (GSK3b). Blocking the AKT/GSK3b pathway via the AKT inhibitor LY294002 prior to
limb RIPostC suppressed the RIPostC-induced autophagy and resulted in the activation of
caspase-3 in RIPostC rats, suggesting a critical role for AKT/GSK3b-dependent autophagy in
reducing cell death after cerebral ischemia. Conclusions: These results aid optimization of
the time window for RIPostC use and offer novel insight into, and a better understanding
of, the protective mechanism of autophagy in limb RIPostC.

Introduction
Stroke is an acute disease with serious complications and high
mortality that is caused by a disturbance in the blood supply to
the brain. It is critical to take effective measures as early as possible
after stroke occurrence to reduce ischemic injury and protect neuronal functions. To this end, ischemic postconditioning has
recently been reported to be a promising approach [1–3].
Limb remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPostC) is a newly
developed postconditioning procedure that involves repeated
occlusion/release cycles in the bilateral femoral arteries. Unlike
the classical pre- or postischemic conditioning, limb RIPostC is
adaptable in practice. More and more studies indicate that limb
RIPostC improves outcome in ischemic animal models [4–6]. Our
previous study also suggested that limb RIPostC reduces brain
edema and blood–brain barrier disruption in experimental
ischemia/reperfusion in rats [7]. However, the time window and

ª 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

the protective mechanism for limb RIPostC have not been well
investigated in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) animal model.
Autophagy is a vital cellular pathway for the degradation of
intracellular macromolecules or organelles for subsequent reuse
that helps to maintain intracellular homeostasis in physiological
conditions. Recent studies suggested that autophagy is an important arbiter of cell death-survival decisions by degrading these
harmful aggregates and organelles in inflammation [8], malignancy [9], and neurodegeneration [10]. Autophagy is also
reported to be involved in cerebral ischemia [11,12], but its role in
the associated neuronal death is still controversial. Some reports
have indicated that autophagy promoted apoptosis in primary cortical neurons [13] or in animal models of cerebral ischemia [14].
However, other studies suggested that induction of autophagy
contributed to the neuroprotection afforded by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase [15] and ischemic preconditioning [11].

Autophagy in Neuroprotection of Limb RIPostC

In this study, we aimed to clarify the role of autophagy in
neuronal cell death/survival and to investigate the time window and possible mechanism of autophagy induction during
limb RIPostC application after transient ischemia in the MCAO
rat model.

Materials and Methods
Animal Model
All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Capital Medical University, Beijing, and were in accordance with the principles outlined in the
NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300–320 g in weight) were anesthetized with 1.75% isoflurane in 70% nitrous oxide and 30%
oxygen. For the MCAO model, ischemia and reperfusion (I/R)
was established as described previously [16]. Briefly, the right
external carotid artery (ECA), internal carotid artery (ICA), and
pterygopalatine artery of the ICA were exposed. Occlusion was
conducted by inserting a nylon suture with a diameter of
0.38 mm into the ICA via a slit on the ECA. The suture was
advanced along the ICA to 18–19 mm from the bifurcation and
maintained in position for 2 h. Reperfusion was produced by
gently withdrawing the suture until the suture tip reached the
bifurcation. Successful MCAO and reperfusion was confirmed
by laser Doppler flowmetry (PeriFlux System 5000; Perimed,
Stockholm, Sweden). Rats that showed convulsions or sustained consciousness disturbances were excluded from the subsequent experiments, as most of these animals were identified
to have suffered subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to
suture-induced rupture of the ICA. The animals in the sham
group underwent the identical procedure except occlusion was
omitted.
In the I/R + RIPostC groups, limb RIPostC was carried out by
three cycles of 10 min occlusion/10 min release of the bilateral
femoral artery using clamps at 0, 10, and 30 min of reperfusion
(R-0, R-10, R-30 groups, respectively). The protocol for limb RIPostC in each group is schematically illustrated in Figure 1A.
Except for the experiment on cerebral infarction and neurological
function, all studies were performed in animals of the sham, I/R
and I/R + R-0 groups.
To address the role of AKT, the AKT antagonist LY294002
(30 lM in 10 lL; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) or DMSO (vehicle
control) was microinjected into the lateral ventricle 30 min prior
to MCAO surgery. Stereotaxic coordinates for injection were
bregma posterior (P) 1 mm; lateral (L) ± 1.5 mm; and ventral
(V) 4.0 mm from the dura, with the tooth bar set at 0 mm.

Measurement of Neurological Deficits
Neurological deficits were assessed at 22 h after reperfusion in a
double-blind fashion using the method of Ludmila Belayev [17]
and foot-fault tests [18]. For the Ludmila Belayev score, neurological function was graded on a scale of 0–12, with 0 representing
normal function and 12 representing maximum neurological deficits. The score was derived from two tests: (1) the postural reflex
test to examine upper body posture while rats were suspended by

(ischemia for 2 h and reperfusion for 22 h) that underwent three cycles of

According to the start of conditioning (0, 10 or 30 min after reperfusion),
RIPostC rats were divided into three groups: I/R + R-0, I/R + R-10, and
I/R + R-30. (B) Representative brain slices stained by TTC in I/R and the

the tail, and (2) the forelimb placing test to examine sensory
motor integration in forelimb placing in response to visual, tactile,
and proprioceptive stimuli. For the foot-fault tests, rats were
placed on and traversed along a 110-cm-length platform with
9 9 9 cm2 grids. The number of times the forelimb fell into the
grids within 1 min was counted to reflect neurological function
deficits.

Infarct Volume by TTC Staining
The infarct volume was measured at 22 h of reperfusion by 5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma) staining as
described previously [19]. Briefly, rats were transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline under deep anesthesia to
eliminate intravascular blood. Brains were quickly removed and
sectioned into six 2-mm-thick consecutive coronal slices and then
stained with 1.5% TTC. The infarct volume of each brain was
measured using Image-ProPlus Analysis Software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA).

SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting Analysis
Twenty-two hours after reperfusion, rats were transcardially
perfused with PBS and the penumbral tissues were collected
and homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5,
150 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% NP40, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, and 1 lg/mL leupeptin). Homogenates
were sonicated and centrifuged at 18,000 g for 30 min at 4°C.
The protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic
acid (BCA) assay kit (Pierce, Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA).
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were carried out as previously
described [20]. Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting
were as follows: anti-p-S473-AKT (1:1000), anti-p-S9-GSK3b
(1:1000), anti-LC3 (1:1000), anti-AKT (1:1000), anti-GSK3b
(1:1000), and anti-b-actin (1:1000), all of which were from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1:5000) were from Chemicon (Billerica,
MA, USA). The expression of b-actin in the same membrane
was simultaneously determined as an internal reference. Signals
were visualized using the LumiGLO chemiluminescent substrate,
and immunoblots were quantitatively analyzed after scanning of
the X-ray films using AlphaEaseFC software (Alpha Innotech,
San Francisco, CA, USA).

Immunohistochemistry Staining
Immunostaining was carried out at 22 h of reperfusion. Rats were
transcardially perfused with PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Twenty-micron-thick cryostat sections were obtained and
double-stained with rabbit anti-p-S9-GSK3b (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-LC3 (1:150; Cell Signaling Technology),
and mouse anti-Neuron-Specific Nuclear Protein (NeuN, 1:50;
Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) or antiglial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP, 1:50; Millipore). Five-micron-thick paraffin-embedded
slices were stained with anticleaved caspase-3 (1:50; Cell Signaling Technology) and counterstained with DAPI. Images were captured using a microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

Autophagy in Neuroprotection of Limb RIPostC

Assessment of Autophagy Level
Microtubule-associated protein light chain-3 (LC3) undergoes
successive modification to form LC3-I and phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated LC3-II that is specifically targeted to autophagosome membranes [21]. To evaluate the autophagy level,
two groups of experiments were conducted. First, the LC3-II/LC3I ratio was determined in each condition by Western blotting and
expressed as the percentage of that of the sham group. Next, the
number of LC3-positive puncta was assessed by immunostaining
as a measure of the autophagy level. For this purpose, paraffinembedded slices were double-stained with anti-LC3 (1:50; Cell
Signaling Technology) and mouse anti-NeuN (1:50; Millipore).
LC3-positive puncta in penumbral tissues were counted in each
group.

Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).
Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc correction for multiple
comparisons. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05.

Results
The Protective Time Window of Limb RIPostC
Against Transient Cerebral Ischemic Injury
To ascertain the time window for limb RIPostC in protection
against I/R injury in the MCAO rat, limb RIPostC was carried out
within different time periods during reperfusion. The outcome
was first assessed by examination of cerebral infarction using TTCstained brain slices from the different experimental groups (Figure 1B). In comparison with the I/R group, the infarct volume in
all RIPostC groups but the R-30 groups was significantly reduced
with a quantitative analysis of infarct volume showing a significant difference between the I/R (48% ± 3.3) and I/R + RIPostC
groups (R-0: 26% ± 4.4; R-10: 30% ± 3.5), with the exception of
R-30 (40% ± 3.1; n = 8; Figure 1C).
The effect of RIPostC after different time periods was evaluated
further using the Ludmila Belayev neurological score and footfault tests at the end of 22 h of reperfusion. Although Ludmila Belayev’s neurological scores (I/R: 7.25 ± 0.25; I/R + R-0:
6.62 ± 0.63; I/R + R-10: 6.62 ± 0.50; I/R + R-30: 8.00 ± 0.27) did
not show a statistically significant difference between the groups
(n = 8; Figure 2A), the result of the foot-faults test revealed that
RIPostC in the R-0 and R-10 groups significantly improved neurological function when compared to the I/R group (I/R:
8.12 ± 0.58; I/R + R-0: 6.00 ± 0.80; I/R + R-10: 5.25 ± 0.75; I/
R + R-30: 7.75 ± 0.37; n = 8; Figure 2B), indicating that MCAO
rats benefit more from RIPostC conducted in the early phase of
reperfusion.

significantly less I/R injury in comparison with the I/R group, as
evidenced by both reduced infarct volume and improved neurological function. The level of autophagy in the penumbra at 22-h
reperfusion was assessed by Western blotting of LC3 (Figure 3A).
Normalizing the statistic data with the sham group (Figure 3B)
revealed a significant increase in the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio in the I/
R + R-0 group (162.01% ± 30.49) compared with I/R rats
(112.65% ± 16.01; n = 4; Figure 3B). To identify the cell type
where the autophagy was occurring, penumbral tissue was double
immunostained with antibodies for LC3 and either neuron-specific NeuN or astrocyte-specific GFAP (Figure 3C). The results
demonstrated that autophagy took place mostly, if not exclusively, in neurons (images a, b, c), but not in astrocytes (images e,

As the AKT/GSK3b pathway has been proposed to be an important protective mechanism in cerebral ischemia, we investigated
whether limb RIPostC leads to AKT/GSK3b activation. For this
purpose, the levels of S473-phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and S9phosphorylated GSK3b (p-GSK3b) in the penumbra were studied
at 22-h reperfusion by Western blotting (Figure 4A,C). Quantitative evaluation demonstrated that the expression of p-AKT in the
penumbra significantly increased in I/R + R-0 rats when compared to I/R group (I/R: 103.17% ± 9.86; I/R + R-0:
160.00% ± 17.94; n = 4; Figure 4B). Likewise, a significant
increase in the expression of p-GSK3b was observed in the RIPostC group when compared with I/R rats (I/R: 87.08% ± 19.92;
I/R + R-0: 149.60% ± 24.68; n = 4; Figure 4D).
To address the role of the AKT/GSK3b pathway in RIPostCinduced autophagy, LY294002, an antagonist of AKT, was
microinjected into the lateral ventricle 30 min before ischemia
induction. The extent of the transformation of LC3 into LC3-I
and -II and the levels of phosphorylated GSK3b were determined by Western blotting at 22 h of reperfusion (Figure 5A).
Analysis revealed that the level of autophagy reduced to
61% ± 13.26 in comparison with that of the DMSO control
group (Figure 5B; n = 4). This result was verified by an immunohistochemistry study that showed that both the number of
NeuN-positive cells in the LY294002-treated group (d) and the
level of phosphorylated GSK3b (e) were reduced in comparison
with the DMSO control (a, b; Figure 5C). Thus, inhibiting AKT
activity significantly reduced both RIPostC-induced autophagy
and the expression of p-GSK3b, suggesting that the AKT/
GSK3b pathway may play a critical role in RIPostC-induced
autophagy.

Suppressing Autophagy by AKT Inhibitor
Activates Caspase-3 in RIPostC Rats
To address the role of AKT/GSK3b pathway in mediating cell survival in I/R injury and RIPostC treatment, the expression of
cleaved (activated) proapoptotic caspase-3 was assessed in the
penumbra by immunohistochemistry at 22 h of reperfusion (Figure 6A). Caspase-3-positive cells were much more common in the
penumbra (b) than in contralateral tissue (a). The number of caspase-3-positive cells declined, however, in the RIPostC group (c),
showing the beneficial role of RIPostC in attenuating I/R injury.
Moreover, the inhibitory effect of RIPostC on caspase-3 expression
was reversed by pretreatment with LY294002, suggesting implication of the AKT/GSK3b pathway in mediating the effect of RIPostC (d). The levels of cleaved caspase-3 were further verified by
Western blotting (Figure 6B). Normalizing the data with those of
the sham group showed that limb RIPostC significantly suppressed
I/R-induced caspase-3 activation, while LY294002 activated
caspase-3 by blocking AKT/GSK3b-dependant autophagy (I/R:
163.27% ± 20.57;
I/R + R-0:
122.10% ± 8.21;
I/R + R-0

is regarded to be an efficacious protective strategy against brain
ischemic injury and is thus attracting extensive interest [7,22–24].

as it involves repetitive reperfusion and occlusion of bilateral femoral arteries, has been suggested to be a neuroprotective strategy
that is easier to translate into clinical situations than RIPostC of

disruption and improve neurologic functions in stroke animals
[7,23,26].
In this study, we observed that limb RIPostC conducted
within 10 min of reperfusion exhibited an unambiguous beneficial effect, as evidenced by both reduced infarct size and
improved neurological function after 2 h of ischemia and 22 h
of reperfusion. Our findings suggest that the best outcome may
be expected if limb RIPostC is applied in the early phase of
reperfusion (Figures 1 and 2). A study of Sun et al. [23] demonstrated the neuroprotection of limb RIPostC (performed 3 or
6 h after reperfusion) against 90-min ischemia followed by 72h reperfusion, which corroborates our findings. However, it is
necessary to investigate the long-term protective efficacy of
limb RIPostC in further experiments.
Autophagy, an important cell clearance system for degrading
wastes or impaired organelles into micromolecules for reuse, has
been reported to play an important role in ischemia [15,27]. In
this study, we investigated whether autophagy was involved in
the neuroprotection of RIPostC after cerebral ischemia. Our
results demonstrated for the first time that autophagy is promoted
in the penumbra of cerebral ischemic rats with RIPostC application (Figure 3), which is supported by the study of Park et al. [28]
of ischemic preconditioning in PC12 cells following oxygen–glucose deprivation. Furthermore, our results showed that RIPostCinduced autophagy is triggered mostly in neurons (NeuN-specific
cells) of the penumbra and not in GFAP-positive astrocytes, which
is supported by Tian’s report [12] that used a live green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused LC3 transgenic mouse model to show
that after 60-min transient cerebral ischemia the GFP-LC3-positive cells of the peri-ischemic area were primarily neuronal, not

astro- or microglial. Tian’s report also showed that autophagy was
activated with a peak at 1 day, which was not consistent with our
finding that a significant increase in autophagy was not seen in I/
R rats that underwent 2-h ischemia and 22-h reperfusion. The
main reason for this discrepancy may be the variation between
the tissues that were collected for analysis, which may show a difference in the relative numbers of neurons and glia. Our studies
suggest that autophagy may be critically important in limb RIPostC, especially in the regulation of neuronal function and that
autophagy may thus be a potential target for neuroprotective
therapy after cerebral ischemia.
The mechanism of autophagy induction by limb RIPostC
application in MCAO rats was also explored. AKT/GSK3b pathway has been recognized as a protective pathway against cerebral ischemic injury [29,30]. Recent studies also provided
evidence for the involvement of AKT in autophagy induction
by targeting key molecules in autophagy pathway [31,32], such
as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) [33] and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) [34]. In this study, we demonstrate that limb RIPostC upregulated the phosphorylation of
AKT and GSK3b at 22 h of reperfusion. Moreover, LY294002,
an inhibitor of the AKT pathway, blocked RIPostC-induced
autophagosome formation by inhibiting GSK3b phosphorylation, suggesting that AKT/GSK3b phosphorylation plays a critical role in the regulation of RIPostC-promoted autophagy. Our
results are consistent with Peng’s report [4], which found that
RIPostC of the hind limb upregulates the phosphatidylinositol-3
kinase/AKT (PI3K/AKT) pathway in the CA1 region in global
cerebral I/R rats. Gao et al. [30] also reported that the AKT signaling pathway contributes to postconditioning’s protection

against stroke. Our and other findings suggest the critical role
of AKT in autophagy promotion in ischemia conditioning.
Although autophagy is well known as being involved in type
II cell death, the protective role of autophagy has been shown
in many recent studies in ischemia [11,15,35]. In this study, we
investigated the role of autophagy in cell death/survival during
RIPostC after stroke, particularly in penumbral tissues. By
assessment of activated caspase-3, it was shown that I/Rinduced apoptosis is attenuated by limb RIPostC, but worsened
by suppressing autophagy using the AKT inhibitor LY294002.
This result suggests that autophagy may be an important protective mechanism in limb RIPostC. Although our results suggested

ª 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd

that autophagy may be involved in the neuroprotection of limb
RIPostC, how autophagy reduces ischemic injury is still unclear.
It is likely that autophagy promoted by RIPostC application at
the early phase of I/R injury protects neurons by accelerating
the clearance of wastes or harmful signals and thereby blocking
the neurotoxic cascade, for example, with upregulation of Bcl-2
and heat-shock protein 70 or reductions in cytochrome c release
and caspase-3 activity [2]. In addition, autophagy may facilitate
macromolecule degradation to compensate for the depletion of
energy in brain tissue after stroke. However, the exact protective mechanism of autophagy in RIPostC needs to be further
elucidated.

group. Scale bar = 10 lm.

In conclusion, our results indicate that limb RIPostC applied
in the early phase of reperfusion in rats after MCAO reduces
infarct size and improves neurological functions, upregulates
neuron autophagy, and downregulates activated caspase-3,
both of which require the involvement of the AKT/GSK3b signaling pathway. The results of the present study may contribute to optimizing the protocol of limb RIPostC for clinical use
and provide insight for better understanding the mechanism
underlying limb RIPostC.
