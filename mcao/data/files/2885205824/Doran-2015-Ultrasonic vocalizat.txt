Speech impairments affect one in four stroke survivors. However, animal models of post-ischemic vocalization deﬁcits are limited. Male mice vocalize at ultrasonic frequencies when exposed to an estrous
female mouse. In this study we assessed vocalization patterns and quantity in male mice after cerebral
ischemia. FOXP2, a gene associated with verbal dyspraxia in humans, with known roles in neurogenesis
and synaptic plasticity, was also examined after injury. Using a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) model, we assessed correlates of vocal impairment at several time-points after stroke. Further,
to identify possible lateralization of vocalization deﬁcits induced by left and right hemispheric strokes
were compared. Signiﬁcant differences in vocalization quantity were observed between stroke and sham
animals that persisted for a month after injury. Injury to the left hemisphere reduced early vocalizations
more profoundly than those to the right hemisphere. Nuclear expression of Foxp2 was elevated early
after stroke (at 6 h), but signiﬁcantly decreased 24 h after injury in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
Neuronal Foxp2 expression increased in stroke mice compared to sham animals 4 weeks after injury. This
study demonstrates that quantiﬁable deﬁcits in ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are seen after stroke. USV
may be a useful tool to assess chronic behavioral recovery in murine models of stroke.

1. Introduction
Aphasia is one of the most common deﬁcits seen in stroke
survivors. Characterized by difﬁculty with speech production and
language processing, aphasia affects 21–38% of stroke patients [1].

Speech disorders after stroke have been associated with a disruption in white matter tracts such as the arcuate fasciculus, in addition
to other cortical areas [2]. For the vast majority of humans the arcuate fasciculus and other areas involved in language production or
comprehension localize to the left hemisphere [3,4]. Recent studies
have shown that loss of function of the arcuate fasciculus manifests
in speech deﬁcits [2]. Essential to the development of this pathway
is the transcription factor forkhead box P2 (FOXP2), a key mediator
of expressive speech development [5–8]. FOXP2 is highly conserved
and its absence is associated with verbal dyspraxia in humans
[5–8]. Patients with heterozygous mutations in FOXP2 exhibit critical articulation deﬁcits [8] and dyslexia [9]. Foxp2 has also been
implicated in the development of vocalization production in animals [9]. Absence of FOXP2 in mice manifests as motor impairment,

S.J. Doran et al. / Behavioural Brain Research 283 (2015) 154–161

abnormal cerebellar development and an absence of vocalization
when exposed to stressors [10]. Foxp2 also plays an important role
in neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, impacting neurite outgrowth
as well as white matter organization in the brain [11].
While current brain imaging using diffusion tensor tractography
(DTT) can identify the arcuate fasciculus and damage associated
with this neural tract, aphasia treatments continue to range widely
based on the severity of clinical symptoms [12,13]. Recently, a positive correlation between clinical improvement in motor function
and language ability after stroke was seen, suggesting that motor
outcome after stroke plays a large role in predicting language outcome [12]. Interestingly, mice with insertion of humanized FOXP2
had enhanced learning and signiﬁcant physiological changes in corticostriatal circuits that are known to be involved in motor control
and speech [14].
One of the biggest challenges for the development of efﬁcacious therapies for aphasia is the lack of an appropriate pre-clinical
model of aphasia. Currently there are no well accepted techniques
to model speech or expressive deﬁcits in rodents after experimental stroke. While previous studies have shown deﬁcits in rapid
auditory processing after stroke that may serve as a useful model
for receptive language deﬁcits [15], less is known about expressive deﬁcits in rodent models following ischemic injury. A recent
report showed abnormal vocalization production in female mice
after injury but mice were assessed at short time points after
stroke and females have very low baseline vocalization rates [16].
Although rodents do not produce speech per se, male mice vocalize at ultrasonic frequencies (40–120 kHz) when presented with a
female mouse [17–20]. These courtship songs have been analyzed
for spectrogram patterns and quantity in normal mice, but analysis
of chronic changes in vocalization patterns and quantity in males
after stroke has not been investigated [19–23]. USVs have also been
well characterized in neonatal mice, which vocalize robustly when
removed from the dam [24]. Similar to the language deﬁcits seen in
humans, pups with heterozygous mutations of FOXP2 show deﬁcits
in vocalization production [25–27]. This study evaluated vocalization production deﬁcits after stroke, examined potential laterality
of language after injury, and assessed the response of FOXP2 to
ischemic injury.

2.2. Ultrasonic vocalization recording
Mice were prescreened one week prior to stroke and highvocalizers were used in subsequent studies one. High-vocalizers
were deﬁned as mice with 35 or more USVs within 120 s when
presented with a mature female. Therefore each animal had an
assessment of baseline vocalization prior to random assignment
into stroke vs. sham groups. USV was recorded as previously
described [16–18,20,28] with minor modiﬁcations. Experimental
subjects were placed in an empty cage for two minutes to acclimate at the same time each day by a blinded investigator. After
two minutes, a female mouse was introduced to the cage. Two successive 120 s trials were recorded with a sampling frequency of
300,000 Hz. As described by others [19,23,28], females did not produce vocalizations when exposed to a male, thus all vocalizations
that were recorded were produced by the male mouse. Animals
were returned to their home cage and the apparatus was cleaned
with 70% ethanol to remove olfactory cues before the next subject was tested. Vocalizations were recorded using a condenser
ultrasound microphone (Avisoft Bioacoustics, Germany), sensitive
to frequencies of 10–200 kHz. The microphone was placed on a mini
tripod 12 cm above the ﬂoor of the cage and connected to computer
via Avisoft-UltraSoundGate turn-key system (Avisoft Bioacoustics,
Germany) with an extension cable provided by the manufacturer.
The Avisoft-RECORDER USGH software allows the investigator
to record and visualize the real-time acoustic data as spectrogram display. This data was then analyzed using Sound Analysis
and Synthesis Software (Avisoft-SASLab Pro, Avisoft Bioacoustics, Germany). An experienced investigator blinded to the animal
surgical conditions counted the total number of USVs for each independent animal and analyzed the spectrogram of each vocalization
based on call duration and frequency range. For the short-term
cohort sacriﬁced at post-stroke day (psd) 3, USVs were recorded one
day prior to stroke (baseline), post-stroke day (psd) 1, and psd3. In
the long-term cohort sacriﬁced one month after stroke, USVs were
recorded one day prior to stroke (baseline) and at psd1, psd3, psd7
and psd28. A naïve group was not used as the mice were compared
to their own baseline vocalization rate to provide a ratio of “change
from pre-stroke baseline.” Data are presented as fold change in
calls. Investigators performing testing and analysis were blinded.

2. Methods

2.3. Middle cerebral artery occlusion model

2.1. Animals

Baseline pre-stroke vocalizations were recorded one week after
high-vocalization screening and analyzed prior to surgery. Mice
were then randomized using SPSS software such that each group
displayed comparable baseline vocalization production ability for
each of the surgical conditions. Focal transient cerebral ischemia
was induced by 60 min of reversible unilateral middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) under Isoﬂuorane anesthesia followed by
reperfusion as described previously [29,30,31]. In brief, a midline
ventral neck incision was made, and unilateral right MCAO (RMCAO
(end n = 16 for short-term cohorts, n = 8 for long-term cohorts) or
left MCAO (LMCAO) (end n = 19 for short-term, n = 9 for long-term)
was performed by advancing a 6.0 silicone-coated nylon monoﬁlament (Doccol Corporation, CA) to block the blood ﬂow to MCA
via an external carotid artery stump. Blood ﬂow measurements
by laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (DRT 4/Moor Instruments Ltd, Devon,
UK) conﬁrmed MCAO (reduction to 80% of baseline ﬂow). Rectal temperatures were monitored with a Monotherm system (V
WR LabShop, Batavia, IL, USA) and temperature was maintained
with a heating pad at ∼37 ◦ C during surgery. Sham mice were subjected to similar surgical conditions except the suture was not
inserted into the MCA (end n = 18 for short-term cohorts, n = 11 for
long-term cohorts). All animals were administered 0.2 mL saline
subcutaneously psd 0–7 and had free access to wet mashed food.

All animal experimental work was approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at University of Connecticut Health Center and was performed in accordance with National
Institutes of Health guidelines. Male C57BL/6 black mice were
obtained from Charles River (Wilmington, MA, USA) and allowed
to acclimate for two weeks. All mice were housed 5 per cage (11 L,
6 W, 6 H) with a 12-h light/dark schedule in a temperature- and
humidity-controlled vivarium, with ad libitum access to food and
water.
Two cohorts of mice were used for USV analysis. One cohort was
used for short-term analysis and mice were sacriﬁced 3 days after
stroke. These animals were subjected to right hemispheric stroke
(RMCAO), left hemispheric stroke (LMCAO), or sham surgery (initial
n = 20/gp). Brains were assessed for infarct size after testing. A second cohort (initial n = 12/gp) was assessed for 28 days after injury to
assess USV recovery. Brains were taken for immunohistochemistry
analysis at sacriﬁce.
Two further cohorts of mice were used for Western blot analysis
at 6-h and 24-h endpoints for FOXP2 expression (n = 10/gp; stroke
vs. sham). Samples were pooled to obtain adequate nuclear protein
for a ﬁnal n of 4 per group.

Subjects were excluded if they died over the span of the testing
period, if there was evidence of surgical failure, including the presence of subarachnoid hemorrhage or no histological evidence of
stroke.
2.4. Neurological deﬁcit score
Neurological deﬁcit scoring (NDS) was performed prior to USV
recording on test days as previously described in Liu et al., 2009
[32]. Neurological deﬁcits were scored using the following rubric
on a scale from 0 to 5: 0 = no deﬁcit, 1 = forelimb weakness and
torso turning to ipsilateral side when held by the tail, 2, circling to
affected side; 3, unable to bear weight on affected side and circling immediately when placed on a bench, 4 = no spontaneous
locomotor activity or barrel rolling, and 5 = immobile/dead.
2.5. Histology
Mice assessed at short-term endpoints were sacriﬁced at 3 days
after stroke with avertin (0.1 mL/10 g, Sigma) followed by cervical dislocation. The brains were extracted and cut into ﬁve 2-mm
coronal sections and stained with 1.5% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) for 8 min at 38 ◦ C. These sections were then transferred into 4% formalin over-night for ﬁxation. Infarct volumes were
analyzed (Sigma Scan Pro, San Jose, CA, USA) from the digitalized
images as previously described [33]. The ﬁnal infarct volumes are
presented as a percentage of the volume of the contralateral structure (with correction for edema) as in [34].
Mice in the long-term cohort were similarly anesthetized at
28 days after stroke and transcardially perfused using ice-cold
sodium phosphate-buffered saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were then extracted and post-ﬁxed for 24 h in
paraformaldehyde and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution.
Brains were cut into 30 micron sections using a microtome and then
stored in antifreeze at −20 ◦ C until use. Sections were mounted on
Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus charged slides (Fisher scientiﬁc, Hampton, NH) and stained with cresyl violet for infarct analysis as in [34].
Infarct volumes were quantiﬁed from digitalized section images
using Sigma Scan Pro software by a blinded investigator.
Laryngeal nerve segments were removed from animals in the
Western cohort, 24 h after stroke onset. These were ﬁxed in
4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, transferred to phosphate buffered
saline for 30 min and then to 70% ethanol. Samples were then
embedded in parafﬁn, sliced transversely into 30 micron sections
and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) (n = 5 per surgical
condition). Cell damage was quantiﬁed by density of nerve ﬁbers
using Sigma Scan Pro (San Jose, CA, USA) and is represented as a
percentage of nerve ﬁbers of the section area.

2-methyl-butane. Samples were pooled (2 stroke hemispheres,
2 sham hemispheres) to achieve a high enough protein concentration to assess protein in the nuclear fraction. Samples were
homogenized with Dounce homogenizers in cold lysis solution
(10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2 , 0.1 mM EDTA, 1.5 mM
CaCl2 , 0.25 mM sucrose, 1 M DDT, 10% Triton X-100, 1:50 protease inhibitor cocktail). These samples were then centrifuged at
800 g for 10 min at 4 ◦ C, with the pellet containing the nuclear fraction. The supernatant was centrifuged again at 14,000 g for 30 min
for the cytosolic fraction. The nuclear pellet was re-suspended in
lysis buffer and was run through a sucrose gradient composed of
1.8 M and 2.3 M sucrose with ultra-centrifugation at 30,000 g for
45 min. The subsequent pellets were collected with Nuclei pure
storage buffer (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and centrifuged at
2300 rpm for 10 min. The pellets were dissolved in Extraction Buffer
(Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), sonicated 10 s three times, and
stored at −80 ◦ C as the ﬁnal nuclear fraction [32].
2.8. Western blot
To achieve equal protein loading of 10 ␮g/well of our nuclear
and cytosolic fractions, the protein concentration of each independent sample was determined by BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc., Rockford, IL, USA) and subjected to Western blotting as in [32]. Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were
run on a 4–12% TGX Criterion electrophoresis gels (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and transferred to a polyvinylidenediﬂouride membrane
(BioRad, Hercules, CA). All blots were blocked with 5% milk
and incubated overnight with FOXP2 (1:1000) (abcam), actin
(1:5000) (Sigma), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor
(MIF) (1:1000) (abcam) in TBS with 4% bovine serum albumin and
0.1% TWEEN. Secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG 1:5000 for
FOXP2, anti-mouse 1:10,000 for Actin and MIF) (GE Healthcare)
were diluted, and ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) was used for signal detection. Densitometry was
performed with ImageJ software (NIH) as in [32].
2.9. Statistical analysis
Statistics are presented as means ± SEM for all experiments
except the NDS which is represented as medians (interquartile
range). Statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism. One-way
ANOVAs with repeated measures was used for all vocalization
analysis with a Tukey post hoc analysis for multiple comparisons,
unless otherwise noted. A probability value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. Behavioral testing, USV recording, data
analysis and infarct quantiﬁcation were performed by an investigator blinded to the surgery condition (stroke vs. sham).

2.6. Immunohistochemistry

3. Results

Ten 30 micron sections were generated for each surgical group
and were slide mounted and incubated in blocking solution as
previously described [33]. Sections were incubated overnight
with rabbit anti-FOXP2 (1:200, abcam), mouse anti-NeuN (1:200,
Millipore), and then incubated for 60 min with anti-rabbit and
anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with a ﬂuorophore
(1:1000, FlourAlexa) and DAPI nuclear stain solution (1:1000, Invitrogen) as previously described in O’Keefe et al., 2013 [34]. Images
were obtained with an inverted light Zeiss-Axiovert ﬂuorescence
microscope.

3.1. USV

2.7. Subcellular fractionation
For western analysis cerebral hemispheres were extracted
from mice at 6 and 24 h after surgery and ﬂash frozen in

On the day prior to stroke (baseline) all vocalizations exhibited similar spectrogram patterns to those previously described by
others [16–18,20,28]. Calls were within the range of 30–120 kHz
and had a duration of less than 0.05 s with no differences between
groups over days tested. However, on psd1 and psd3, the calls of
stroke mice were too distorted to allow for classiﬁcation by pattern
type. This abnormal vocalization spectrogram pattern was seen in
the majority of stroke mice, regardless of the hemisphere affected
(Fig. 1). The ability to produce a clear spectrogram pattern of vocalization was restored in all mice by psd7.
The laryngeal nerve, which runs parallel to the internal carotid
artery, plays a role in the motor pathway of vocalization production
in many animals, such as in frogs and cats [35,36]. As the MCAO

Fig. 1. A depicts the vocalization pattern of a MCAO mouse prior to surgery (prestroke). B shows that the ability to form an organized patterned vocalization is
completely lost at psd1. The ability to structure and pattern a vocalization is partially
restored at psd7 (C).

surgery occurs in close proximity to the laryngeal nerve, possible damage to the nerve was investigated. H&E staining showed
no statistically signiﬁcant difference in nerve ﬁber density over all
surgery conditions (quantiﬁcation not shown), (Fig. 2), indicating
that changes seen in USV production are not due to local nerve
damage.
The short-term cohort (Fig. 3) showed similar baseline vocalization production between animals assigned to LMCAO (n = 19),
RMCAO (n = 16), or Sham (n = 18), with no signiﬁcant differences
between groups prior to injury [F(2,49) = 0.135, p = 0.87]. On psd1,
all groups showed a decrease in USV production, suggesting a
potential effect of surgery or anesthesia. However, LMCAO mice,
showed a signiﬁcant decrease in USVs compared to sham mice
on psd1 [F(2,49) = 3.480, p = 0.04] whereas RMCAO mice did not.
On psd3, sham mice recovered to baseline levels, while RMCAO
and LMCAO mice continued to have signiﬁcant vocalization deﬁcits
relative to shams [F(2,49) = 7.880, p = 0.001].

Fig. 2. A shows the laryngeal nerve (white arrow) and the residual external carotid
stump (black arrow) after RMCAO surgery. B shows the same after LMCAO surgery.
C shows the nerve and the common carotid after sham surgery. D shows an H&E
stained longitudinal section of the laryngeal nerve. The amount of ﬁber damage was
similar across all surgical conditions.

Fig. 3. A shows the average number of vocalizations in a 2 min trial in our short-term experiment over three groups: sham (n = 18), LMCAO (n = 19), and RMCAO (n = 16).
While there are no differences at baseline (pre-stroke) as seen with ANOVA (B), at psd1 we see that LMCAO mice vocalize signiﬁcantly less than sham mice [F(2,49) = 3.480,
p = 0.04] (C). At psd3 both MCAO groups vocalize signiﬁcantly less than shams [F(2,49) = 7.880, p = 0.001] (D).

158

Fig. 4. A shows the average number of vocalizations made in two minutes chronically over a series of time-points. Similar to the acute cohorts ANOVA revealed no differences
at baseline between groups (B); yet at psd1 LMCAO vocalize signiﬁcantly less than sham mice [F (2,25) = 3.804, p = 0.036] (C). At psd3 LMCAO and RMCAO vocalize signiﬁcantly
less than sham mice [F(2,25) = 5.757, p = 0.008] (D). At psd7 we see that both LMCAO and RMCAO continue to vocalize at signiﬁcantly lower rate than sham mice [F(2,25) = 5.386,
p = 0.01] (E). At psd28 this signiﬁcant difference between stroke and sham is now absent [F(2,25) = 2.461, p = 0.10] (F).

Similar results were seen in the long term cohort (Fig. 4) on
psd1 and psd3. All groups showed a decrease in USV production on
psd1, with a signiﬁcant difference in mice subjected to LMCAO compared to sham [F(2,25) = 3.804, p = 0.036]. Again, by psd3 sham mice
returned to baseline whereas LMCAO and RMCAO mice had continued signiﬁcant deﬁcits in vocalization on psd3 [F(2,25) = 5.757,
p = 0.008]. On psd7, RMCAO and LMCAO continued to vocalize signiﬁcantly less than sham mice [F(2,25) = 5.386, p = 0.01]. On psd28,
a trend of continued deﬁcits in vocalization in the MCAO mice compared to sham was seen [F(2,25) = 2.461, p = 0.10], but this was not
signiﬁcant. While no differences between LMCAO and RMCAO were
seen on later days, and both were signiﬁcantly reduced compared
to sham, LMCAO mice again showed signiﬁcantly decreased vocalization production on psd1 when compared to sham while RMCAO
mice did not.
When comparing baseline calls to number of vocalizations in
the long-term cohort over time, mice subjected to LMCAO showed a
signiﬁcant drop in vocalization production on psd1 [F(1,36) = 5.048,
p = 0.031]and psd3 [F(1,36) = 5.361, p = 0.027] when compared to
sham mice; again this deﬁcit was not seen in RMCAO mice on either
psd1 [F(1,34) = 0.435, p = 0.51]or psd3 [F(1,34) = 1.722, p = 0.199].
Interestingly, when animals were used as their own baseline control to individualize vocalization production, a signiﬁcant decrease
in call production was seen in stroke mice (LMCAO and RMCAO
combined vs. sham) at both day 8 [F(1,29) = 8.608, p = 0.007] and
day 28 [F(1,29) = 5.424, p = 0.028] compared to shams (Fig. 5).
3.2. NDS
No signiﬁcant difference in the median NDS between MCAO
groups (p > 0.05) were seen on any day tested, showing that gross

motor deﬁcits do not differ based on the hemisphere damaged (data
not shown). Both MCAO groups had a NDS of less than 1 by psd7,
demonstrating the rapid recovery of gross neurological deﬁcits in
this model [36].

Fig. 5. shows the fold change in vocalizations in sham (n = 11), LMCAO (n = 8), and
RMCAO (n = 9) tested over 4 weeks. Fold change is deﬁned as the number of baseline calls (pre-stroke)/calls recorded on each post stroke test day. An overall effect
of stroke on fold change in calls was signiﬁcant across days psd3 [F(1,51) = 4.133,
p = 0.047], psd8 [F(1,29) = 8.608, p = 0.007] and psd28 [F(1,29) = 5.424, p = 0.028] compared to shams. Mice with a LMCAO show signiﬁcantly less vocalizations on psd1
[F(1,36) = 5.048, p = 0.031] and on psd3 [F(1,36) = 5.361, p = 0.027] when compared
to sham mice. This deﬁcit was not seen in RMCAO psd1 [F(1,34) = 0.435, p = 0.51] and
psd3 [F(1,34) = 1.722, p = 0.199].

Fig. 6. A shows nuclear and cytosolic FOXP2 levels. Histone and Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) were used as the nuclear and cytoplasmic loading controls,
respectively. Nuclear FOXP2 levels were signiﬁcantly higher in stroke animals compared to shams 6 h after stroke. Nuclear FOXP2 levels drop at 24 h in stroke animals
compared to sham. 6 shows cytosolic FOXP2 levels at 6 h and 24 h after stroke with MIF as the loading control. Quantiﬁcation of the nuclear fraction is shown in C showing
that there is a statistical differences in FOXP2/histone ratio in stroke compared to sham at both 6 h and 24 h (p < 0.04 and p < 0.02 respectively) (n = 4 per group). Quantiﬁcation
of the cytosolic fraction is shown in 6D shows a non-signiﬁcant decrease in FoxP2/MIF ratios in stroke brain compared to sham at 6 h and a signiﬁcant decrease in FOXP2/MIF
ratio at 24 h after stroke when compared with sham (p = 0.07 and p < 0.01 respectively).

3.3. Infarct analysis
No difference in infarct size was seen between LMCAO and
RMCAO mice 3 days after stroke (p = 0.63). No signiﬁcant difference
in cerebral atrophy between LMCAO and RMCAO mice was seen at
psd28 (p = 0.81) (data not shown).
3.4. Western blot analysis
An increase in nuclear FOXP2 expression was seen 6 h after
stroke compared to sham mice (p = 0.04). However, 24 h after
stroke a signiﬁcant decrease in nuclear FOXP2 was seen in stroke
cohorts when compared to sham (p = 0.02). There was a decrease
in FOXP2 expression when compared to sham in the cytosolic
fraction but this was not signiﬁcant (p = 0.07). Similar to nuclear
changes, cytosolic FOXP2 was signiﬁcantly decreased by 24 hours
when compared to sham (p = 0.01) (Fig. 6), which could represent
overall cell death.
3.5. Immunohistochemistry
To assess chronic changes in FOXP2 when acute cell death is
complete, brains were assessed one month after injury. FOXP2
expression was seen in the nucleus (stained with DAPI) and colocalized to neurons (NeuN). In both RMCAO and LMCAO higher
levels of nuclear FOXP2 were seen in the ipsilateral hemisphere,
especially within the infarct region (Fig. 7).
4. Discussion
In this study we systematically investigated how stroke impacts
vocalizations in male mice. First, our ﬁndings suggest that surgery
can lead to early impairments in vocalization. Further, to identify
possible lateralization effects in vocalization we compared strokes
in the left versus the right hemisphere. Mice subjected to LMCAO
showed signiﬁcantly reduced vocalizations at early time points
compared to sham mice, an effect not seen in RMCAO mice. Signiﬁcant differences in vocalization quantity were observed between
stroke and sham animals that persisted after gross neurological

deﬁcits had resolved. Vocalization deﬁcits continued to measurable
28 days after stroke. Our study design included multiple recordings
of the same animal, as the frequency of baseline vocalizations was
used to control for between animal variability. Repeated testing
may have led to accommodation or learning and thus may have
altered subsequent USV measurement speciﬁcally in brain injured
animals. We cannot fully exclude the possibility that the impaired
vocalization production seen after stroke is due to desensitization
to the USV task itself. Nevertheless, the lasting effect of vocalization impairments provides strong evidence that stroke-induced
vocalization deﬁcits could be used to assess long-term recovery.
As recent reports suggest that FOXP2 is an important upstream
regulator of vocalization, is involved in neuroplasticity, and inﬂuences cortical-striatal circuitry, we further explored short and
long-term changes in cerebral FOXP2 levels. Early increases in
nuclear FOXP2 levels were seen 6 h after injury. As FOXP2 is an
important transcription factor, translocation to the nucleus would
be the ﬁrst step in initiating gene transcription which is consistent
with the corresponding but non-signiﬁcant decrease in cytosolic
FOXP2 levels. Both nuclear and cytosolic FOXP2 levels were reduced
by 24 h, likely reﬂecting overall cell death which is maximal at this
time point in this model [37]. However, nuclear FOXP2 levels were
also increased one month after injury, primarily in neurons around
the area of infarct. As FOXP2 has been implicated in neurogenesis,
further studies are needed to determine the potential role of FOXP2
in recovery of stroke-induced vocalization and motor deﬁcits.
Vocalization production across many species requires an interaction between the cortex and the basal ganglia in addition to
other ﬁne-motor pathways [6,38,39]. FOXP2 has been shown to
inﬂuence not only vocalization production under stress but also
cerebellar organization of white matter ﬁne-motor tracts [39,40].
As this study shows that the laryngeal nerve is not damaged during experimental stroke, cortical or upper motor neurons are likely
affected leading to deﬁcits in vocalization production and possibly
providing a model that could be used to explore expressive speech
deﬁcits. While only expressive deﬁcits were investigated in this
study, auditory processing deﬁcits have also been shown to occur
in mice after stroke [15]; expressive and receptive language abilities should be studied concurrently to determine whether these

area of sham cortex, showing low levels of cortical FOXP2. C and D show similar levels of FOXP2 in the striatum of mice subjected to RMCAO and LMCAO respectively. E

deﬁcits are localized to speciﬁc areas of the murine brain as they
are in humans.
In Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT), a speech and language
therapy used in the clinical setting, the patient sings sentences
instead of saying them [41]. This relatively successful therapy has
been shown to engage both sides of the brain, [41]. Recent studies have shown that speech recovery after left hemisphere infarcts
involves recruitment of the right hemisphere in auditory tasks
[42]. While all groups in this study show a decrease in vocalization production on psd1, LMCAO mice vocalize signiﬁcantly
less than shams while RMCAO mice do not exhibit this difference. This suggests that while murine vocalization production is
decreased when either hemisphere is damaged, vocalization production may be more sensitive to lesions in the left hemisphere,
especially at early time points. While most aphasia patients show
some improvement in speech production over time, many patients
never regain full speech abilities [13]. This study shows that even
one month after stroke, mice had quantiﬁable decreases in vocalization production compared to shams. Mice show dramatic recovery
in many deﬁcits within days after injury especially with shorter
ischemia times such as the 60 min used in this study [37]. This
can limit the utility of recovery studies especially when screening
neuroprotective agents, as maximal deﬁcits are seen only in the
acute phase. The assessment of USV may represent a useful tool to
study chronic behavioral recovery of a functionally relevant task.
This could potentially be used to test new therapeutic agents that
speciﬁcally target stroke-induced speech disorders. Speech recovery in humans is a slow process that involves activation of distant,
contralateral areas of the brain [42]. Whether similar bilateral activation occurs in the recovery of rodent vocalization production
remains undetermined.
FOXP2 has been implicated as a key transcription factor in
neurogenesis and synaptic growth [6,11,26,39], while its role in
recovery remains unexplored. While FOXP2 is expressed by many
cell types in the brain [6], we found that FOXP2 co-localized
with neurons four weeks after injury, possibly indicating increased

long-term neuronal growth. Expression of FOXP2 is known to be
essential for auditory-motor learning as well as cortical-striatal
integration [6,11,40]. This study shows that one month after injury,
when mice show improved vocalization abilities, FOXP2 expression
is markedly increased in the damaged hemisphere when compared to sham. While vocalization has been linked to white motor
tract and cortical integration [11], this study implies that FOXP2
may also play a role in establishing and maintaining neuronal
pathway integrity. Very recent work has shown that introduction of the human FOXP2 gene (by inducing the same amino acid
changes that occurred during human evolution into the mouse
Foxp2 gene) improved learning and changed striatal neuroplasticity [14]. These changes in corticostriatal systems may contribute to
the adaptations seen in humans that allow for speech and language
acquisition. Our ﬁndings suggest that FOXP2 may also play a role
in language recovery.
5. Conclusion
Signiﬁcant differences in vocalization production are present
after stroke and persist for 4 weeks after injury. USVs may be
a sensitive and quantiﬁable test for stroke-induced deﬁcits. Mice
with left hemispheric damage have a more profound reduction in
early vocalization than mice with right hemispheric lesions. FOXP2
expression is up-regulated in the nucleus early after stroke and
subsequently decreases in both the nucleus and the cytosol 24 h
after injury. Chronically, FOXP2 expression is selectively increased
in neurons in the damaged hemisphere, and its expression corresponds with vocalization recovery. FOXP2 could be a potential
target for speech recovery.
