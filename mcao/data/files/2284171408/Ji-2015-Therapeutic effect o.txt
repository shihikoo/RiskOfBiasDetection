after stroke can be enhanced by combination treatment with either EtOH or hypothermia
in the presence of t-PA and 60% NBO. Because the effects produced by EtOH and
hypothermia are comparable, their mechanism of action may be not only similar but also
could be interchangeable in future clinical trials.

Introduction

Ischemic stroke is caused by an interruption of cerebral blood
ﬂow, usually the middle cerebral artery (MCA), ultimately
leading to hypoperfusion of tissue and neuronal cell death
(Donnan et al., 2008). Neuronal cell death proceed predominantly through apoptosis, which is characterized by lack of
inﬂammation, pyknotic nucleus, and cell shrinkage (Elmore,
2007).The only current treatment of acute ischemic stroke
approved by the FDA is recanalization with tissue-type
plasminogen activator (t-PA) administration. However, after
decades of t-PA administration in the United States, the
clinical outcomes of this treatment remain poor, owing to
the short treatment widow, susceptibility to complications
(Saver, 2004), as well as the low frequency of use (Kollmar and
Schwab, 2012). Thus, there is increasing need to develop
novel neuroprotective treatment options to reduce neuronal
damage following ischemic stroke.
Normobaric oxygen (NBO) as a neuroprotective treatment
option has been studied both preclinically and clinically
(Michalski et al., 2011). In animal models, the beneﬁcial
effects of NBO in transient ischemia stroke have been more
apparent. Thus, effects of NBO treatment after stroke include
stabilization of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), reduction of
toxic metabolites and inhibition of inﬂammatory processes
(David et al., 2012; Liang et al., 2015; Michalski et al., 2011; Sun
et al., 2010). However, clinical randomized control trials
evaluating the efﬁcacy of NBO in focal cerebral ischemia have
not yielded deﬁnitively positive beneﬁts (Cornet et al., 2012;
Nighoghossian et al., 1995; Rusyniak et al., 2003).
In addition to NBO, another promising treatment option is
therapeutic hypothermia (Hypo) (Kollmar and Schwab, 2012).
Many studies have demonstrated its effects in limiting tissue
damage in animal ischemic models as well as in the clinical
setting (Barone et al., 1997; Cao et al., 2014; Colbourne et al.,
1997; Hemmen and Lyden, 2007; Hoesch and Geocadin, 2007;
Holzer et al., 2005; Liu and Yenari, 2007; Zhang et al., 2013).
However, the use of hypothermia treatments in clinical
settings is limited because of its long onset time to reach
beneﬁcial effect (3–7 h) (Kammersgaard et al., 2000; Schwab
et al., 1998, 2001) as well as its severe side effects on the
respiratory (Schwab et al., 1998) and cardiovascular (Feigin
et al., 2003) systems. In a rat stroke model we recently
demonstrated the efﬁcacy of ethanol (EtOH) (1.5 g/kg) in
reducing infarct volume and behavioral dysfunction (Wang
et al., 2012). EtOH is thought to exert neuroprotective effects
through increased expression of anti-apoptotic Akt protein
and decreased expression of pro-apoptotic PKC-δ protein
(Hafeez et al., 2014). Moreover, combination therapy of EtOH
and NBO resulted in synergistic reductions in infarct volume

and behavioral dysfunction (Geng et al., 2013b, 2015). This
combination therapy may have had a role in reducing
apoptosis and altering expression of associated anti- or proapoptotic molecules (Geng et al., 2013a). Furthermore, when
EtOH was used in combination with hypothermia, no synergistic effect could be elicited, suggesting that EtOH and
hypothermia may work through similar mechanistic pathways (Wang et al., 2012). The current study was designed to
determine how combination therapy with NBO and hypothermia or EtOH might affect apoptosis in the ischemic brain. In
addition, to explore novel translational stroke treatments, we
have used a more clinically relevant autologous embolus
model of stroke and assessed whether the known neuroprotective effects of t-PA and low concentration of NBO (60%)
could be enhanced by administration of hypothermia or
EtOH. Because of the limitations of hypothermia in clinical
settings, our study aimed to determine whether EtOH might
be an effective substitute for hypothermia.

Results

2.1.

Physiological Parameters

There were no signiﬁcant differences in blood pH, PaCO2, and
MAP among all groups. NBO treatment elevated PaO2 levels to
approximately 280 mmHg at the conclusion of 3 h (po0.01 as
compared to groups without NBO treatment).

2.2.

Apoptosis cell death

Cell death was measured as a relative change in apoptosisinduced cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation
among the control, stroke and stroke with different treatments (t-PA, t-PAþNBO, t-PAþEtOH, t-PAþHypo, t-PAþNBOþEtOH, t-PAþNBOþHypo) after 24 h of ischemia (Fig. 1).
MCA occlusion with the embolus signiﬁcantly (F[2, 15] ¼39.415,
po0.001) increased apoptotic cell death (Fig. 1A). In our study,
t-PA reduced the apoptotic cell death but did not reach a
signiﬁcant level (Fig. 1A). However, as compared to t-PA
alone, its combination with NBO, Hypo or EtOH signiﬁcantly
reduced apoptotic cell death by 32.5% (po0.05), 43.1%
(po0.01) and 36.0% (po0.05) respectively (Fig. 1B). In addition,
combination therapy with t-PAþNBOþEtOH or t-PAþNBOþHypo produced a larger decline in the cell death level
by 71.1% and 73.6% respectively (F[5, 30] ¼ 6.214, po0.01). The
effect of NBOþEtOH and NBOþHypo treatment on cell death
level are about the same.

enhanced reduction (F[5, 30] ¼ 5.374, po0.01) remained up to
24 h of reperfusion (Fig. 3D).
Similar results were found in Bax expression after 3 and 24 h
of reperfusion (Fig. 4). Bax displayed increased protein levels
after stroke at 3 (F[2, 15] ¼ 27.363, po0.01) (Fig. 4A) and 24 h (F[2,
15] ¼9.160, po0.01) (Fig. 4B), respectively. Although t-PA alone
was not enough to reduce Bax expression to statistically
signiﬁcantly low levels, its combination with Hypo (po0.05)
signiﬁcantly decreased Bax expression at 3 h after reperfusion.
Both NBOþEtOH and NBOþHypo largely and signiﬁcantly
reduced Bax protein expression (F[5, 30] ¼ 5.039, po0.01)
(Fig. 4C). At 24 h after reperfusion, Bax expression was continually and signiﬁcantly (F[5, 30] ¼ 2.697, po0.05) reduced by
Hypo (po0.01) and EtOH (po0.05). Again both NBOþHypo and
NBOþEtOH after t-PA administration strongly (po0.01) reduced
Bax expression (Fig. 4D).

Fig. 1 – Effect of monotherapy or combination therapy on
apoptotic cell death. Apoptosis related DNA fragmentation
was measured by enzyme immunoassay at 24 h after
reperfusion and represented as a relative value compared to
reference value of 1. Stroke signiﬁcantly increased cell death
(po0.01) (A). Monotherapy (NBO, Hypo, EtOH) or combination
therapy (NBOþEtOH, NBOþHypo), signiﬁcantly reduced cell
death as compared to t-PA only treatment (B). All values are
normalized to sham control group, arbitrarily standardized
at 1.0. *(po0.05), **(po0.01).

2.3.

Pro-apoptotic protein expression

Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF) protein expression was analyzed by Western immunoblot performed after 3 h and 24 h of
reperfusion (Fig. 2). After stroke, a signiﬁcant increase was
observed at 3 h (F[2, 15] ¼11.673, po0.01) (Fig. 2A) and 24 h (F2,
15] ¼8.963, po0.01) (Fig. 2B), respectively. At 3 h after t-PA
treatment, there was additional reduction in AIF expression
by NBO (po0.01), Hypo and EtOH, especially by NBOþEtOH and
NBOþHypo combinations (po0.01) (Fig. 2C). At 24 h (Fig. 2D), all
combination therapy further reduced AIF expression (po0.01),
while this reduction was most pronounced in NBOþEtOH group
and NBOþHypo group (po0.01).
Similar to AIF, cleaved caspase-3 displayed increased
protein levels after stroke at 3 (F[2, 15] ¼ 5.164, po0.01)
(Fig. 3A) and 24 h (F[2, 15] ¼3.704, po0.05) (Fig. 3B), respectively.
t-PA alone reduced the protein levels although this reduction
did not reach a signiﬁcant level. However, EtOH, Hypo,
NBOþEtOH as well as NBOþHypo further reduced cleaved
caspase-3 generation at 3 h after reperfusion with t-PA treatment (F[5, 30] ¼ 3.415, po0.05) (Fig. 3C). This signiﬁcantly

Anti-apoptotic protein expression

When compared to the control group, Bcl-2 protein expressions were markedly reduced in the stroke group at both 3
(F[2, 15] ¼ 5.846, po0.05) and 24 h (F[2, 15] ¼8.914, po0.05) after
the onset of ischemia (Fig. 5A and B). Although reperfusion
with t-PA treatment increased Bcl-2 expression at 3 (po0.05)
and 24 h (po0.01), respectively (Fig. 5A and B), a larger and
signiﬁcant increase in Bcl-2 expression were observed in
either NBOþHypo and NBOþEtOH groups at 3 (F[5, 30] ¼ 5.027,
po0.01) (Fig. 5C) and 24 h (F[5, 30] ¼10.796, po0.001) (Fig. 5D)
after reperfusion.

Discussion

Using an autologous embolus model, this study is to reveal: 1)
thrombolysis with t-PA reduces neuronal apoptotic cell
death; 2) although treatment of t-PA in combination with
NBO (60%) does signiﬁcantly improve cell survival, triple
treatment with addition of EtOH or Hypo further improves
this neuroprotection; our ﬁndings reveal an additive interaction between t-PA and NBO with either EtOH or Hypo. 3) no
signiﬁcant difference was found between the two triple
treatments, suggesting that EtOH and hypothermia may
confer neuroprotection through similar pro- or antiapoptotic pathways and that EtOH could substitute
hypothermia.

3.1.
Neuroprotection may result from interference through
apoptotic intrinsic and extrinsic pathways
Apoptosis proceed through two major pathways, the extrinsic
and intrinsic pathways. The intrinsic pathway signals apoptosis through changes in the inner mitochondrial membrane,
mediated by B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) families of proteins,
which results in the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pores. Bcl-2 family proteins are
heterodimeric proteins divided into three groups. Group I,
which consist of proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, possess
anti-apoptotic activity. Group II, which consist of proteins
such as Bax and Bak, possess pro-apoptotic activity. Group III,

Fig. 2 – AIF protein expression. As compared to sham control group, there was signiﬁcant increase in pro-apoptotic AIF
protein expression at 3 (po0.01) (A) and 24 h (po0.01) (B). As compared to t-PA treatment, there was signiﬁcant reduction of
AIF in NBO, NBOþEtOH and NBOþHypo group at 3 (po0.01) (C). At 24 h, all monotherapy and combination groups had
signiﬁcant reduction of AIF as compared to t-PA group (po0.01) (D). All values are normalized to sham control group,

which consist of proteins such as Bid and Bik, show little
sequence similarity with Groups I and II (Hengartner, 2000).
Together, Bcl-2 family proteins regulate mitochondrial pore
formation, and procaspases via adapter molecules. Bcl-2
family proteins also interact with mitochondrial ion channels
such as VDAC (Gross et al., 1999) to name a few of their
functions. Formation of MPT leads to release of two main
groups of normally mitochondrial sequestered pro-apoptotic
proteins: cytochrome c (cyt c) and AIF into the cytosol
(Elmore, 2007). Cyt c forms a complex with Apaf-1 and
procaspase-9 to form an “apoptosome” (Chinnaiyan, 1999;
Hill et al., 2004). While AIF, among other endonucleases,
translocate into the nucleus to induce DNA fragmentation
(Joza et al., 2001). Both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways
converge on the execution pathway, characterized by activation of execution procaspases-3, 6 and 7 (Elmore, 2007).
Among them, caspase-3 is considered the most important
executioner caspase involved in carrying out the degradative
functions inside the cell (Elmore, 2007). We hypothesize that
amelioration of apoptosis by our combined therapy could
have interfered with one or several steps of the intrinsic and/
or extrinsic pathways by conceivably inhibiting one or more

of the associated proteins, although much more work would
be necessary to tease out the precise mechanism leading to
neuroprotection.

3.2.

Hypothermia and apoptosis

The mechanism through which therapeutic hypothermia
exerts its neuroprotective effects is multifaceted and complex. Possible mechanisms of protection may include: reduction of cellular metabolism and oxygen demand (Erecinska
et al., 2003), reduction in free radical production (Shao et al.,
2010), improvement in cellular pH balance (Polderman, 2009),
and reduction in cell death and inﬂammation (Yang et al.,
2009). Our group has demonstrated previously that administration of EtOH in a rat cerebral ischemia model showed
improved cell survival via reduced apoptosis (Fu et al., 2013;
Geng et al., 2013a; Hafeez et al., 2014) and decrease in enzyme
activity of NADPH oxidase (NOX) leading to reduced free
radical formation (Kochanski et al., 2013). Thus, hypothermia
and EtOH share some common pathways through which
their neuroprotective effects can precipitate. A drawback of
hypothermia as a current therapeutic agent is the relatively

Fig. 3 – Cleaved caspase-3 protein expression. As compared to sham control group, there was signiﬁcant increase in proapoptotic caspase-3 protein expression at 3 (po0.01) (A) and 24 h (po0.05) after stroke (B). As compared to t-PA treatment,
there was signiﬁcant reduction of cleaved caspase-3 expression in Hypo (po0.05), EtOH (po0.05), NBOþEtOH (po0.01) and
NBOþHypo (po0.01) groups at 3 after reperfusion (C), and this reduction was signiﬁcantly enhanced in Hypo (po0.05), EtOH
group (po0.05), NBOþEtOH group (po0.01) and NBOþHypo group(po0.01) (D) at 24 h after reperfusion. All values are
normalized to sham control group, arbitrarily standardized at 1.0. Representative immunoblots are presented. Values are
mean7SE.

long times required to reach the target temperature (Lampe
and Becker, 2011). In addition, hypothermic patients need
increased resources in terms of specialized healthcare equipment and personnel (Ding and Clark, 2008); and are at
increased risk of respiratory (Kollmar and Schwab, 2012)
and cardiovascular complications (Feigin et al., 2003). In
contrast, advantages of using EtOH are its low cost, ready
availability, relative tolerance among patients and facility in
crossing the BBB. Blood EtOH levels have been correlated with
improved outcomes in patients following traumatic brain
injury (TBI) (Tien et al., 2006). Further in our hands no
hypothermic effects by EtOH administration have been
detected (data not shown) which mitigates potential complications of hypothermia. With further bench research, it is
hoped that EtOH may substitute for hypothermia in the
clinics with the potential of both prolonging the treatment
window and reducing the adverse reactions associated with
hypothermia.

3.3.

NBO administration

NBO has been widely investigated in preclinical and clinical
studies as a treatment option following various medical emergencies including stroke (Cornet et al., 2012; Michalski et al.,
2011). In these studies, NBO at 95% or 100% oxygen are widely
used. The advantages of using NBO are that it is readily available,
inexpensive and could be quickly applied. However, some drawbacks of NBO therapy include its short time window and its low
efﬁcacy in both transient and focal ischemia (Michalski et al.,
2011; Singhal et al., 2002). A clinical study of post cardiac arrest
reperfusion comparing 30% versus 100% oxygenation did not
show signiﬁcant differences in neuron speciﬁc enolase (NSE) nor
S-100 marker between the different oxygen concentrations
(Kuisma et al., 2006). In fact, one of the conclusions of the study
was that using 100% oxygen may worsen neuronal damage
during reperfusion than 30% oxygen (Kuisma et al., 2006). In the
context of stroke research, a randomized control trial conducted

36

Fig. 4 – Bax protein expression. As compared to sham control group, there was signiﬁcant increase in pro-apoptotic Bax
protein expression at 3 (po0.01) (A) and 24 h (po0.01) (B). As compared to t-PA treatment, there was signiﬁcant reduction of
Bax expression in Hypo group (po0.05) and this reduction was signiﬁcantly enhanced in NBOþEtOH and NBOþHypo groups
(po0.01) at 3 h after reperfusion (C). Bax expression was signiﬁcantly reduced in Hypo group (po0.01), EtOH group (po0.05),
NBOþEtOH (po0.01) and NBOþHypo group (po0.01) (D) at 24 h after reperfusion. All values are normalized to sham control

by Singhal et al. (NCT00414726) regarding oxygen treatment in
stroke has been terminated due to excess mortality in the
hyperoxia group (unpublished data). Although not proven
unequivocal, there seems to be a link between high oxygen
concentration and adverse outcomes in various post-reperfusion
medical emergencies (Cornet et al., 2012). One of the proposed
mechanisms through which high oxygen concentration can
precipitate toxicity could be due to its increased free radical
generation and vasoconstriction properties (Calvert et al., 2007).
Given these potential clinical complications of oxygen supplementation and applicability of its use, we opted to apply a lower
NBO concentration of 60%, instead of 95% or 100% as usually
used in an attempt to better simulate the clinical situation. As
expected our data shows a weak neuroprotective effect of low
NBO concentration in ischemic stroke. However, by combining
with hypothermia or EtOH in the presence of t-PA, 60% NBO
showed signiﬁcantly reduced expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic protein by
possibly precipitating its neuroprotective effects and enhancing
neuronal survival.

In conclusion, given the risk of mortality and morbidity
associated with ischemic stroke, there is strong impetus to
come up with clinically effective treatment options. Using a
clinically relevant embolus model, our study has demonstrated that combination treatment displayed enhanced neuroprotection than monotherapies. Furthermore, we have
shown similar efﬁcacy and substitutive potential when using
t-PAþNBOþhypothermia or t-PAþNBOþEtOH. Because of the
limited therapeutic options available to treat ischemic stroke
and the efﬁcacy of the presented combination treatments,
these combined therapies would provide better approaches
than those currently available in the clinics.

Committee of Xuanwu Hospital of Capital Medical University
and the National Institute of Health. All studies were
designed in a blinded and randomized manner. A total of 96
adult, male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 300–350 g (Beijing
Vitalriver Experimental Animal Co, Beijing, China) were used.
The rats were randomly assigned before surgery into the
following 7 stroke groups with different treatments: 1) Stroke
only group (n¼ 12) with thromboembolic cerebral ischemia
and normothermia of 37 1C body temperature. The animals
received a saline solution instead of the study drugs. 2) t-PA
group (n¼ 12): thromboembolic stroke with t-PA treatmentat a
total dose of 5 mg/kg. 3) t-PAþNBO group (n ¼12): thromboembolic stroke with treatment of t-PA and 60% NBO. 4)
t-PAþHypo group (n¼ 12): thromboembolic stroke with treatment of t-PA and hypothermia of 33 1C. 5) t-PAþEtOH group
(n¼ 12): thromboembolic stroke with treatment of t-PA and
ETOH at a dose of 1.0 g/kg. 6) t-PAþNBOþEtOH group (n¼ 12):
thromboembolic stroke with treatment of t-PA, NBO and
EtOH. 7) t-PAþNBOþHypo group (n ¼12): thromboembolic

stroke with treatment of t-PA, NBO and Hypo. In addition, a
total of 12 rats were used in control group in which animals
underwent the entire surgical procedure except for embolization. Each group was divided into two subgroups for data
analyses at 3 or24 h after the thrombolytic therapy with t-PA.

4.2.
Focal cerebral ischemia induced by autologous
embolus
The method used to prepare a white embolus was modiﬁed
from that previously described (Zhang et al., 2015). Brieﬂy,
femoral arterial blood was withdrawn into 20 cm of PE-50
tubing and maintained in the tube for 2 h at 37 1C water bath,
and for 22 h at 4 1C refrigerator. 5 cm of the clot was cut and
transferred to a 20 cm PE-10 tube to wash with saline for 10–
15 times, and reserved for application. Rats weighing 300–
350 g were anesthetized with 2% enﬂuane, after tracheal
cannula and anesthesia was maintained with 1.5% enﬂuane
in 70% N2O and 30% O2 by breathing machine using a

38

feedback-controlled heating blanket to maintain rectal temperature at 3770.5 1C. A 4 cm long, ﬁbrin-rich clot was
injected into the origin of the MCA using a modiﬁed PE-50
catheter, to induce embolic MCA occlusion.
In order to monitor blood pressure and blood gases pH,
pO2, pCO2, the right femoral artery was cannulated with a PE50 catheter. The right vein was cannulated for drug administration. The rCBF was monitored by Laser-Doppler Flowmetry (LDF) with the LDF probe positioned 3 mm posterior and
5 mm lateral preparation to the bregma. Animals with a
stable r40% rCBF of pre-ischemic baseline at 1 h after
embolization were selected for further analyses.

4.3.

t-PA treatment

t-PA (Actilyse Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany) at a total dose
of 5 mg/kg body weight was administered via the right
femoral vein. Half was administered as a bolus at 1 h after
embolization and the left was continuously infused for
30 min.

4.4.

NBO treatment

In order to establish a more clinically feasible procedure,
normobaric hyperoxia at concentration of 60% was chosen as
compared to 95% or 100% used previously. Animals were
placed in a sealed chamber exposed to 60% O2 for 3 h starting
at 1 h after stroke. The oxygen level was controlled with an
oxygen probe set at 60%, with oxygen levels maintained by a
continuous oxygen ﬂow.

4.5.

Hypothermia treatment

At 1 h after stroke, hypothermia (33 1C) was started and
maintained by placing ice under the rat's body for 3 h.

4.6.

EtOH treatment

Ethanol at a total dose of 1.0 g/kg was diluted in saline to
1.0 ml and administered at the end of t-PA treatment with a
bolus by right femoral vein. This dose was determined based
on our previous study (Geng et al., 2013a; Wang et al., 2012).

Pro- or anti-apoptotic protein analysis

Western immunoblot analyses were used to detect protein
expression of AIF, cleaved Caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2, as
described previously by us (Geng et al., 2013a). Brieﬂy,
proteins of cerebral hemispheres (right, ischemic side) samples were transferred to a polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF)
membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Primary antibody (mouse
monoclonal anti-AIF antibody, 1:5000, Santa Cruz; rabbit
polyclonal anti-Bax antibody, 1:500, Santa Cruz; rabbit monoclonal anti-cleaved Caspase-3 antibody, 1:500, CST; rabbit
polyclonal anti-Bcl-2 antibody, 1:200, Santa Cruz) was incubated with membranes for 24 h at 4 1C. They were then
washed 3 times and re-incubated with a secondary antibody.
An ECL system was used to detect immunoreactive bands by
luminescence. Quantiﬁcation of relative target protein
expression was obtained using an image analysis program
(ImageJ 1.48, National Institutes of Health, USA). The expressions of the target proteins were described as folds of control.
Equal protein loading was conﬁrmed and adjusted using
β-actin (polyclonal goat anti-β-actin antibody, 1:1000;
Santa Cruz).

Statistical analysis

All the data was described as mean7SE. Statistical analysis
was performed with SPSS for Windows, version 21.0 (IBM
Corporation, Somers, NY, USA). The differences among
groups were assessed using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with a signiﬁcance level of po0.05. Post-hoc comparison between groups was further detected using the least
signiﬁcant difference (LSD) method.

Combination therapy

In t-PAþNBOþEtOH group, NBO (60%) started at 1 h after
stroke in a 60% O2 chamber, followed by t-PA administration.
EtOH (1.0 g/kg) was applied at the end of t-PA treatment with
a bolus by right femoral vein. In t-PAþNBOþHypo group, NBO
was started at 1 h after stroke, followed by t-PA and
hypothermia (33 1C).

and incubated on a shaker for 30 min at room temperature in
0.1 mol/L citric acid solution containing 0.5% Tween-20. The
sample solution was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min to
sediment the nuclei. Supernatant (200 ul) was kept for use as
sample, while pellet was discarded. The BCA protein assay
was used to estimate the cellular concentration in the sample
solution. The ﬁnal sample solution was diluted to 0.5 mg/ml
with the provided incubation buffer. Absorbance of 405 nm
was detected as the ﬁnal result with a multimode detector
(Beckman DTX-880).

Cell death detection ELISA

For quantiﬁcation of cytoplasmic histone-associated and
apoptosis-related DNA fragmentation, a commercial enzyme
immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics), as described previously by
our group (Fu et al., 2013; Geng et al., 2013a) was used to
speciﬁcally determine apoptosis. This assay does not detect
necrotic cell death. Brieﬂy, frozen tissue (8 mg) was ﬁnely cut
