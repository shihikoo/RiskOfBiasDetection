By means of introgressing a loss-of-function mutation in the p22phox gene from the Matsumoto Eosinophilia Shinshu (MES) rat to stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats
(SHRSP), we constructed the SHRSP-based congenic strain lacking the P22PHOX expression (i.e., lacking NADPH oxidases [NOX] activities) (SHRSP.MES-Cybames/Izm; hereafter
referred to as SP.MES). To examine the effects of Nox activities on the focal ischemic injury
or stroke, we performed middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in this new congenic strain;
the distal MCA was occluded by 561-nm laser-driven photothrombosis. Resting mean arterial blood pressure was significantly lower in SP.MES when compared with the control PM0/
SHRSP (150±11 mmHg vs. 166±11 mmHg). Cerebral blood flow decreased to 37±13% in
SP.MES and 35±17% in PM0/SHRSP at 10 min after MCA occlusion (not significant).
Infarct volume determined at 24 h after MCA occlusion in SP.MES was 89±39 mm3, which
was not significantly different from 83±35 mm3 in PM0/SHRSP. The distal MCA pattern was
more complex in SP.MES (median 3, IQR 3–5) than PM0/SHRSP (median 2, IQR 1–3) (p =
0.001). Because more complex distal MCA is known to produce larger infarction after distal
MCA occlusion in SHR, we adjusted for the branching pattern in an ANCOVA. The adjusted
mean of infarct volume was significantly smaller in SP.MES compared with that in PM0/
SHRSP (67 [95% CI 46 to 87] mm3 vs. 100 [95% CI 82 to 118] mm3, p = 0.032). Elimination
of the P22PHOX expression induced complex distal MCA, which would suggest the presence of ‘loss of complexity’ induced by enhanced oxidative stress in SHRSP; infarct size in
SP.MES—when adjusted for distal MCA complexity—was significantly attenuated compared with that in PM0/SHRSP. Therefore, the present results suggest that Nox is harmful
for ischemic brain tissue.

NADPH Oxidases and Focal Ischemic Injury

Introduction
The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (Nox)—only enzymes
in terms of its primary function of generating superoxide—are the predominant source of reactive oxygen species [1]. So far, the Nox family is known to be composed of 7 catalytic subunits
termed Nox 1 to 5 and Duox 1 and 2. Their physiological function is extremely diverse including host defense and inflammation, cellular signaling, gene expression, cellular death, cellular
senescence, cell growth, oxygen sensing, angiogenesis, and so forth [2]. Nox is also involved in
physiological functions of vasculature and hypertension [2,3], the latter of which is one of
the major risk factors for stroke; superoxide rapidly interacts with nitric oxide to form peroxynitrite, resulting in vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure [3]. Basal and stimulated
generation of superoxide from NADPH oxidases is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher in intracranial cerebral arteries than in systemic arteries, and activation of Nox in cerebral arteries can
cause vasodilation under normal conditions [4]. Focal ischemia based on the middle cerebral
artery (MCA) occlusion is the model of human acute brain infarction caused by occlusion of
major cerebral arteries [5]. Because no specific Nox inhibitors exist at this moment, studies
using Nox-knockout mice are dominant as the approach for assessing the effects of Nox on
stroke pathophysiology. Nox-knockout mice generally showed protection against focal ischemia or experimental stroke (i.e., the evidence for detrimental effects of Nox on stroke outcome)
[1,6].
It is not clear, however, whether Nox affects the stroke outcome directly through increasing
the oxidative stress at the site of ischemia, or through modifying physiological variables such as
blood pressure and cerebral blood flow (CBF) [5,7]. Because of a technical problem in measurement of physiological variables in mice due to their small body size, it is often difficult to
address this issue in mice. Furthermore, there are methodological difficulties in determining
CBF with laser-Doppler flowmetry in mice, because it is difficult to place laser-Doppler probe
avoiding superficial veins and arterioles due to a small size of the brain and thus the high density of blood vessels. Therefore, we attempted to construct a new rat model lacking Nox activities. The Matsumoto Eosinophilia Shinshu (MES) rat was found to harbor a deletion of four
nucleotides in the intron 4 of the cytochrome b(-245), alpha polypeptide (Cyba) gene, which
resulted in an abnormal splicing. As Cyba encodes p22phox, this strain lacked expression of the
P22PHOX protein and showed loss of Nox activities [8]. By introgressing the mutated Cyba
gene from the MES strain, we constructed a congenic strain lacking the Nox activities on the
background of the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP). We hypothesized
that the congenic removal of P22PHOX and subsequent loss-of-function in Nox would attenuate infarct size produced by distal MCA occlusion. In this communication, we performed
MCA occlusion in this new congenic strain, and examined the effects of deprivation of Nox
activities on the focal ischemic injury.

Construction of congenic strains
A congenic SHRSP harboring the mutated Cyba of the MES rat (SHRSP.MES-Cybames/Izm;
referred to as SP.MES hereafter) was constructed by the speed congenic strategy [9]. Genotyping of the Cyba allele was performed by PCR as described in the previous report [8]. One hundred and forty markers throughout the genome were examined to check the genotype of the

Fig 1. Construction of congenic strains. The mutated Cyba allele of MES was introgressed onto the
genomic background of SHRSP. Using the MES strain as the donor and SHRSP/Izm as the recipient, we
constructed a congenic strain without p22phox protein with SHRSP/Izm background by the speed congenic
strategy. The target region was between D19Rat21 and D19Rat105. After 5 generations of backcrossing, all
the 140 background simple sequence repeat markers were confirmed to be homozygous for the recipient
allele, and then the congenic strain with the target region homozygous for the donor strain (i.e., MES) was
obtained through brother-sister matings (SP.MES). Rats with the target region homozygous for the recipient
strain (i.e., SHRSP/Izm) were used as control (PM0). The congenic region was maximally 1.7-Mbp between
the two markers. The box indicates the region from the MES rat, and the vertical bar shows the region
containing the recombination break point.

background genome of the rats. Consequently, SP.MES harboring a 1.7-Mbp genomic fragment of MES including the Cyba locus on the SHRSP background was established (Fig 1) [7,9].
At the final step of the construction of the congenic strain, rats homozygous for the wild type
allele of Cyba were simultaneously obtained as well, which were used as a control for the SP.
MES (hereafter referred to as PM0).
As reported in the original paper [8], the 55-bp insertion in the mRNA of p22phox was confirmed by RT-PCR (S1 Fig); loss of P22PHOX expression was confirmed by Western blotting
in SP.MES (S2 Fig).
PM0 (n = 9) and SHRSP (n = 5) were combined as one group for statistical analysis
because they shared an identical genetic background, and there were no differences in body
weight (285±25 g and 269±25 g, respectively) and resting MABP (165±14 mmHg and 165±8
mmHg, respectively) between the two strains.

Photothrombotic distal MCA occlusion
A total of 31 male rats (11–20 weeks old) were used in this study. The branching pattern of distal MCA was determined according to the criterion as described previously [10] with slight
modification (Fig 2A).
Rats were anesthetized with halothane (4% for induction, 1.5% during the surgical preparation with a face mask, 0.75% after intubation, and 0.5% for maintenance) in a mixture of 70%
nitrous oxide and 30% oxygen. By means of photothrombosis, distal MCA was occluded as
previously described.12 Briefly, a diode laser operating at 561 nm (Sapphire 561–50 CW
CDRH; COHERENT JAPAN, INC., Tokyo, Japan) was used to irradiate the distal MCA. The
laser beam was focused with a 30-cm-f.l. convex lens (KPX 112; Newport Corporation, Irvine,
CA, USA) and positioned onto the distal MCA after reflection from a mirror. The photosensitizing dye rose bengal (15 mg/mL in 0.9% saline; Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd, Osaka,
Japan) was administered intravenously to a body dose of 20 mg/kg over 90 sec starting simultaneously with laser irradiation at a power of 20 mW.

Regional CBF was assessed by means of laser-Doppler flowmetry (ALF21D, Advance Co.
Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The laser-Doppler probe was positioned over the penumbra area supplied
by the MCA (at 2 mm posterior and 3 mm lateral to the bregma above the intact dura) as previously described [5,11].
The rats were monitored during the 1-h survival period (until approximately 2 h after distal
MCA occlusion) and every 3 hours in the next day. Twenty-four h after distal MCA occlusion,
the rat was decapitated under deep anesthesia. The brain was rapidly removed, cooled in icecold saline for 3 min, and was cut into 2 mm-thick coronal sections in a cutting block. The
slices were stained with 1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan) at 37°C for 30 min in the dark. The infarct area was measured in each
slice with NIH Image software (ImageJ 1.48v).
We performed a retrospective analysis of distal MCA pattern and infarct volume after distal
MCA occlusion done in our laboratory during 2005–2012.

Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean±S.D. We used the unpaired two-tailed t-test or Mann-Whitney utest as appropriate to perform univariate comparisons of groups. Resting and Intra-ischemic
MABP and CBF values were compared with use of 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. Independent dose-effect relationship of infarct volume
between the groups was investigated by means of an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) (a general linear model) with distal MCA pattern as covariate; including independent variable/covariate interactions in an initial analysis step tested the ANCOVA homogeneity of regression
assumption. All analyses were carried out with IBM SPSS 18.0.

Results
Body weight was significantly lower in SP.MES than PM0/SHRSP (240±27 g vs. 276±27 g,
p = 0.002). Baseline physiological variables in SP.MES and PM0/SHRSP are presented in
Table 1. Resting MABP in SP.MES was slightly but significantly lower than that in PM0/
SHRSP (p = 0.006). After MCA occlusion, blood pressure increased in both groups, but the
intra-ischemic MABP levels were still lower in SP.MES than in PM0/SHRSP (Fig 3A, 2-way
ANOVA, p<0.001 for a group difference and an effect of time). CBF decreased to 37±13% in
SP.MES and 35±17% in PM0/SHRSP at 10 min after MCA occlusion (Fig 3B, 2-way ANOVA,
not significant). The changes in CBF from 10 min to 60 min after MCA occlusion were 7±8%
and -4±8% in SP.MES and PM0/SHRSP, respectively (p = 0.006). One of 10 PM0 rats died during the 24 h of survival period after MCA occlusion. Infarct volume in the SP.MES group was
89±39 mm3, which was not significantly different from 83±35 mm3 in the PM0/SHRSP group.
The infarct volume was linearly correlated with the distal MCA branching pattern (Fig 4C).
Variability of infarct volume was relatively large in the present study compared with our previous experiments with SHRSP of 5 months old, probably because the age of rats in the present
study was relatively young (11 to 20 weeks), during which time a substantial increase in infarct
volume and thus variability was observed [7]. The groups were, however, well matched for age
in this study, hence age was not expected to affect the inter-strain difference of the infarct
volume.

Examples of distal MCA are presented in Fig 2B–2G: distal MCA is considered more complicated when the number of classification for the distal MCA pattern increases from Type I to
Type VII (i.e., more branches and with tortuosity). Two PM0 rat with former Type VIII distal
MCA (i.e., 2 MCAs), 2 SP.MES rats with Type X, and 1 SP.MES rat with fenestration of distal
MCA were excluded from the analysis (Fig 2E–2I). Distal MCA patterns were more complex
in SP.MES (median 3, interquartile range [IQR] 3–5) than PM0/SHRSP (median 2, IQR 1–3)
(Fig 4A, Mann-Whitney u-test, p = 0.001). In a retrospective analysis of distal MCA in the
izumo (Izm) strains of rats, the simple pattern was more prevalent in SHRSP/Izm, while Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY)/Izm had more complicated patterns of distal MCA (Fig 5). SHR/Izm
showed an intermediate feature between SHRSP/Izm and WKY/Izm. Infarct volume following
MCA occlusion in SHR/Izm with simple distal MCA was 75±26 mm3, which was significantly
smaller than 108±20 mm3 in SHR/Izm with complicated distal MCA (p = 0.017, ANOVA and
Bonferroni post hoc test) (Fig 5). Physiological variables were not significantly different among
the groups (Table 2). Therefore, complicated distal MCA is a predictor for large infarction
after distal MCA occlusion. As expected from this retrospective analysis and our previous experience11—when adjusted for the branching pattern in an ANCOVA—the adjusted mean of
infarct volume was significantly smaller in SP.MES compared with that in PM0/SHRSP (67
[95% CI 46 to 87] mm3 vs. 100 [95% CI 82 to 118] mm3, p = 0.032) (Fig 4C).

Discussion
In the present study, we unexpectedly found that presumed functional loss of Nox associated
with the absence of P22PHOX protein did not mitigate the size of infarction produced by distal
MCA occlusion. Superoxide overproduction during cerebral ischemia deteriorates stroke outcome [1,6]. We observed a slight but significant reduction in blood pressure in SP.MES;
chronic reductions of blood pressure by anti-hypertensive treatments or congenic removal of a
quantitative trait locus for blood pressure were previously reported to attenuate infarction produced by MCA occlusion in SHRSP [7,12]. We therefore expected that decreased superoxide
production and lower resting blood pressure would decrease the infarct size in SP.MES. However, more complex MCA, observed in SP.MES, might have resulted in larger infarction, since
an ANCOVA showed a substantial reduction in infarct volume in SP.MES when adjusted for
the distal MCA pattern or complexity. These divergent effects of phenotypes caused by Nox
dysfunction may be the reason for the negative result in terms of similar infarct size between
SP.MES and PM0/SHRSP.

The vascular system is probably the most prominent instance of hierarchical tubular network characterized by a topological feature (i.e., branching) [13]. Removal of the P22PHOX
expression in SHRSP made the configuration of MCA more complex in SP.MES compared
with PM0/SHRSP. To our knowledge, a direct involvement of reactive oxygen species or of the
Nox activity has not been suggested in the context of branching morphogenesis of blood

vessels. Lipsitz and Goldberger proposed the theory of age-related loss of complexity, in which
the fractal-like (self-similar) branching architecture was implied as a possible subject for the
nonlinear analyses [14]. Interestingly, decreased branching complexity of retinal vessels was
associated with increasing age and lacunar infarction in stroke patients, which suggested that
more pathological status brought less complex blood vessels or loss of complexity [15]. SHRSP
dominantly showed ‘loss of complexity’ of MCA compared with its normotensive counterpart
(WKY) (Fig 5A). Since it is widely believed that SHRSP had a higher level of the oxidative stress
[16], the hypothesis seems intuitively attractive that increased levels of oxidative stress in
SHRSP induced the simple pattern of MCA.
In the present study, we showed that beneficial effects of p22phox ‘knockout’ on the infarct
size induced by MCA occlusion were negligible as a total. This might be because two events
with opposing effects (i.e., complex distal MCA and reduced blood pressure) might have counteracted each other. The complex pattern of MCA observed in SP.MES may cause larger infarction as shown in our previous study [10]; we confirmed this phenomenon in our retrospective
analysis of experiments performed between 2005 and 2012 (Fig 5). On the other hand, reduced
blood pressure in SP.MES would predict smaller infarction as discussed above [5,7,12]. The
former might counteract the latter in SP.MES, cancelling the beneficial effects of lowering
blood pressure and/or the presumed reduction in oxidative stress against focal ischemic injury.
Another interpretation would be that, as P22PHOX is an essential subunit for the activity of
multiple members of the Nox family [2], several subtypes of Nox might play opposite roles in
Table 2. Physiological variables in SHR/Izm (5–7 months old).

the ischemic brain injury. Previous studies on knockout mice suggested different roles of the
Nox subtypes on ischemic brain damage; Nox2 seemed to have deleterious effects [17–21],
whereas effects of Nox1 and 4 were controversial [22–25]. Finally, the experimental condition
of permanent MCA occlusion might be insufficient to activate Nox as to the level of exacerbating the brain ischemic injury; the infarct volume was not dependent on the Nox2 activity in
mice when reperfusion was not achieved after MCA occlusion [26].
Our present study showed that CBF decreased to a similar level immediately after distal
MCA occlusion in PM0/SHRSP and SP.MES groups, and then increased slightly only in the
SP.MES group, which suggested improved vasodilator function caused by the loss of Nox activity. However, CBF after suture MCA occlusion was not different between Nox-deficient and
wild type mice in all the studies with CBF measurements [18–20,22,26]. In general, CBF reduction after suture occlusion was severe (approximately 20% or less of baseline), which indicated
that CBF was determined at ischemic core rather than collaterally perfused zone or penumbra
around the ischemic core. Another possibility would be that knocking out one subtype of Nox
families may not be sufficient to alleviate vascular function under the conditions of suture
occlusion in the previous studies [18–20,22,26]. By contrast, multiple Nox members were
assumed to loose their function due to lack of P22PHOX in SP.MES in the present study.
This study has several limitations. First, the congenic region was estimated as 1.4-Mbp in
maximum, which harbored tens of genes. Although the congenic strategy used in this study
successfully removed the P22PHOX expression from SHRSP, we cannot exclude the possibility
that abnormalities in other genes in the 1.4-Mbp region might have influenced the results—the
attenuated hypertension and the more complex distal MCA—observed in the present study.
Second, we used a permanent MCA occlusion in the present study and hence reperfusion
injury was not considered. The effects of p22phox ‘knock-out’ might be much evident in an
ischemia-reperfusion model. Third, we could not address which subtype of Nox played a major
role in the ischemic brain injury based on the results of the present study. Recently, genomeediting technologies such as Talen and CRISPR/CAS9, were successfully applied to rats
[27,28]. It is attractive to construct ‘knockout rats’ for each member of the Nox family to evaluate roles of individual Nox subtype in ischemic brain injury as well as branching patterns of
MCA.
In conclusion, the congenic exchange of the region including the p22phox gene of SHRSP
with that of SP.MES induced complex distal MCA; enhanced oxidative stress in SHRSP might
have induced ‘loss of complexity’ or simple distal MCA. Infarct size in SP.MES—when adjusted
for distal MCA complexity—was significantly attenuated compared with that in PM0/SHRSP.
Therefore, as most experimental studies demonstrated, Nox was considered to be harmful for
ischemic brain tissue based on the present results. The mechanisms of Nox-related ischemic
injury, however, are not clear from the present study. In a future study, the effect of P22PHOX
deprivation on infarction under transient focal ischemia (i.e., reperfusion injury) should be
addressed.
