cortical neurons. Moreover, compound C suppressed
neuronal cell death induced by concomitant hydrogen peroxide/glucose treatment in primary cortical neurons. Therefore, we concluded that enhanced cerebral SGLT-1 function
mediated by post-ischemic hyperglycemia exacerbates the
development of cerebral ischemic neuronal damage. One
of the mechanisms of cerebral SGLT-1 up-regulation may
be involved in the AMPK activation after cerebral ischemia.

Abstract—The regulation of post-ischemic hyperglycemia
plays an important role in suppressing neuronal damage
in therapeutic strategies for cerebral ischemia. We previously reported that the cerebral sodium-glucose transporter
(SGLT) was involved in the post-ischemic hyperglycemiainduced exacerbation of cerebral ischemic neuronal
damage. Cortical SGLT-1, one of the cerebral SGLT isoforms,
is dramatically increased by focal cerebral ischemia. In this
study, we focused on the involvement of cerebral SGLT-1 in
the development of cerebral ischemic neuronal damage. It
was previously reported that activation of 50 -adenosine
monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increases
SGLT-1 expression. Moreover, ischemic stress-induced activation of AMPK exacerbates cerebral ischemic neuronal
damage. Therefore, we directly conﬁrmed the relationship
between cerebral SGLT-1 and cerebral AMPK activation
using in vitro primary culture of mouse cortical neurons.
An in vivo mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia was
generated using a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
The development of infarct volume and behavioral abnormalities on day 3 after MCAO were ameliorated in cerebral SGLT-1
knock down mice. Cortical and striatal SGLT-1 expression
levels were signiﬁcantly increased at 12 h after MCAO.
Immunoﬂuorescence revealed that SGLT-1 and the neuronal
nuclear antigen (NeuN) were co-localized in the cortex and
striatum of MCAO mice. In the in vitro study, primary cortical
neurons were cultured for ﬁve days before each treatment
with reagents. Concomitant treatment with hydrogen
peroxide and glucose induced the elevation of SGLT-1 and
phosphorylated AMPK/AMPK ratio, and this elevation was
suppressed by compound C, an AMPK inhibitor in primary

INTRODUCTION
Cerebral ischemia is strongly associated with severe
disability and mortality (Siniscalchi et al., 2014). It is well
known that diabetes, hypertension, and cardiac disease
are risk factors for cerebral ischemia (Saito, 2012;
He Huang et al., 2013). In particular, the risk of cerebral
ischemia is higher among patients with diabetes than
among patients without diabetes (Doi et al., 2010). Basic
and clinical studies have suggested that hyperglycemia
prior to acute cerebral ischemia may exacerbate the
resulting brain injury (Bruno et al., 2010). However, some
patients suﬀer from hyperglycemia induced by cerebral
ischemia even in the absence of a pre-existing diagnosis
of diabetes (Capes et al., 2001).
Post-ischemic hyperglycemia is associated with poor
clinical outcomes and seems to particularly aﬀect
patients without diabetes (Stöllberger et al., 2005; Chen
et al., 2013). Moreover, it has been reported that the control of blood glucose levels is associated with an improvement in the outcome of cerebral ischemia (Gentile et al.,
2006). Recently, we have shown that post-ischemic
hyperglycemia develops during the acute phase in an
experimental focal cerebral ischemic model and is exacerbated following cerebral ischemic neuronal damage
(Harada et al., 2009). In the present study, to investigate
the mechanism underlying the exacerbation of neuronal
damage mediated by post-ischemic hyperglycemia, we
focused on the sodium-glucose transporter (SGLT) as a
possible target of ischemic stress-induced elevation of
blood glucose.
SGLT belongs to the solute carrier family 5A and has
six isoforms (Scheepers et al., 2004; Wright and Turk,

2004). SGLT-1, -3, -4, and -6 have been identiﬁed in the
brain (Poppe et al., 1997; Matsuoka et al., 1998;
Scheepers et al., 2004; O’Malley et al., 2006). SGLT
transports glucose into the cell, together with Na+, using
the Na+ concentration gradient (Matsuoka et al., 1998;
Burdakov et al., 2005). The presence of extracellular glucose results in depolarization of the cell through an inﬂux
of Na+ across the membrane (Diez-Sampedro et al.,
2003; Dı́ez-Sampedro and Barcelona, 2011; Barcelona
et al., 2012). It has been reported that intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of phlorizin, an SGLT familyspeciﬁc inhibitor, suppressed the development of cerebral
ischemic neuronal damage, suggesting that cerebral
SGLT may exacerbate ischemic neuronal damage under
hyperglycemia (Yamazaki et al., 2012, 2015; Harada
et al., 2013a).
Interestingly, SGLT-1, one of the SGLT isoforms,
shows increased expression in the cortex and striatum
on day 1 after focal cerebral ischemia (Yamazaki et al.,
2012). On the other hand, the involvement of cerebral
SGLT-1 in the development of cerebral ischemic neuronal
damage and the mechanism responsible for the increase
in SGLT-1 following focal cerebral ischemia remain
incompletely understood. It is well known that
50 -adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) is a highly conserved sensor of cellular energy
status (Gwinn et al., 2008). AMPK is activated, via
phosphorylation, under conditions of energy stress, such
as nutrient deprivation or hypoxia, when intracellular
ATP levels decline and intracellular AMP increases
(Hardie, 2007). It has been reported that an inappropriate
activation of AMPK led to an increase in cardiac
SGLT-1 expression and glucose uptake (Banerjee et al.,
2010). Moreover, AMPK activity may be increased
following the membrane translocation of SGLT-1
(Sopjani et al., 2010). In addition, cortical phosphorylated
AMPK (pAMPK)/AMPK ratio is increased following focal
cerebral ischemia (Harada et al., 2010; Li and
McCullough, 2010).
Therefore, we conﬁrmed the involvement of cerebral
SGLT-1 and the relationship between the up-regulation
mechanism of SGLT-1 and AMPK in cerebral ischemia.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

675

Western blot analysis
Western blotting was performed as previously described
(Yamazaki et al., 2012, 2014). Brieﬂy, mouse brain or primary cortical neurons were homogenized in homogenization buﬀer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 4%
Tween-20, 2 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM Na3VO4,
5 mM benzamidine, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM p-nitrophenyl
phosphate, 5 mM imidazole, 50 mg/mL trypsin inhibitor,
50 mg/mL leupeptin, 50 mg/mL aprotinin, 5 mg/mL pepstatin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride). After centrifugation at 15,000g, the supernatant was collected and
immediately lysed in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)containing sample buﬀer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 2%
SDS, and 10% glycerol), boiled, and reduced with
b-mercaptoethanol. Protein samples were loaded (10 or
20 lg/lane), separated using 7.5% SDS polyacrylamide
gels, and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes
(15 V, 50 min; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Berkeley, CA, USA).
We used a Precision Plus Protein Standards
Kaleidoscope marker (Bio-Rad). All blots were blocked
with 5% skim milk (GE Healthcare, Osaka, Japan) or
5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma–Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) in Tris-buﬀered saline (TBS) containing
0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) at room temperature for 1 h.
Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies
diluted in blocking buﬀer at 4 °C overnight. The primary
antibodies used were: SGLT-1 (1:1000; Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA), AMPK and pAMPK (1:1000; Cell
Signaling, MA, USA), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH, 1:20,000; Millipore). After
washing with TBS-T for 3 min  10 times, membranes
were incubated with either horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000; Kirkegaard &
Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA) for
SGLT-1, or HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000;
Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.) for GAPDH, for
1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS-T for
3 min  10 times, the antigen was detected using a standard chemical luminescence method (ECLTM, GE Healthcare). Visualization of all immunoreactive bands was
performed using Light-Capture (AE-6981; ATTO, Tokyo,
Japan) with an ECLTM Western blotting analysis system
(GE Healthcare). The signal intensity of immunoreactive
bands was analyzed using a Cs-Analyzer (Ver. 3.0;
ATTO).

Animals
All experiments were performed on male ddY mice
(5 weeks old, 25–30 g) or ddY mouse fetuses (17th day
of fetal life) obtained from SLC (Shizuoka, Japan).
Animals were housed at a temperature of 23–24 °C
under a 12-h light–dark cycle (lights from 8:00 a.m. to
8:00 p.m.). Food and water were available ad libitum.
The present study was conducted in accordance with
the Guiding Principles for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals, adopted by the Japanese
Pharmacological Society. Additionally, all experiments
were approved by the Ethics Committee for Animals,
Kobe Gakuin University (approval number: A14-21).

Administration of SGLT-1 small interfering RNA
(siRNA) into the mouse brain
ON-TARGETplus SMART Mouse Slc5a1 siRNA (SGLT-1
siRNA, 2.5 lg/mouse, Thermo Scientiﬁc, Kanagawa,
Japan) or ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting Pool (control
siRNA, 2.5 lg/mouse, Thermo Scientiﬁc), and in vivo
jetPEI + 5% glucose (cationic polymer transfection
reagent; Polyplus Transfection, New York, NY, USA)
were administered i.c.v. to knock down (KD) SGLT-1
protein levels. The i.c.v. administration was performed
as described previously (Haley and Mccormick, 1957;
Yamazaki et al., 2014). In brief, a microsyringe with a

676

27-gauge stainless-steel needle was used for all
experiments. Tubing covered all but the terminal
2.5–3.0 mm of the needle to make a track through the
brain and into the lateral ventricle but not through the ﬂoor
of the lateral ventricle. The needle was inserted unilaterally into the lateral ventricle of the brain (1.0 mm lateral
and 1.0 mm posterior to bregma), as described previously
(Harada et al., 2011). Veriﬁcation of the needle position in
the lateral cerebroventricular region was made by an i.c.v.
injection of dye and subsequent postmortem brain section
veriﬁcation of dye localization. SGLT-1 siRNA was administered on day 4 before middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO).
Animal model of focal cerebral ischemia
The experimental mouse model for transient focal
ischemia was generated by performing a MCAO as
previously described (Harada et al., 2009). Mice were
anesthetized with isoﬂurane and their core body temperature was maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5 °C using a heating
lamp. The left middle cerebral artery was occluded for
2 h by the insertion of an 8–0 nylon monoﬁlament with a
thin silicon coat (Provil Novo Medium; Heraeus Kulzer,
Hanau, Germany) through the common carotid artery,
followed by reperfusion. Sham-operated mice underwent
the same surgical procedure but without the suture insertion. The mice whose brains had been inadvertently
pricked with the silicon-coated 8–0 nylon monoﬁlament
(e.g. small black dot is observed in slice of 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) stain, the siliconcoated 8–0 nylon monoﬁlament is found out in mice brain
for homogenization sample.) were eliminated from the
study. The ﬁnal number of mice used in each experiment
is described in the corresponding ﬁgure legend. In
addition, there is no dead mouse by MCAO in present
study.

volumes were measured using image analysis software
(ImageJ, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) and Adobe
Photoshop Elements 5.0 (Adobe Systems Incorporated,
Tokyo, Japan) as previously described (Harada et al.,
2009). The infarct volume was calculated based on the
infarct area and intensity (intensity = intensity of left
hemisphere  intensity of right hemisphere).
Neurological examination
Neurological abnormalities were assessed on day 3 after
MCAO using the neurological deﬁcit score (NDS), which
comprised consciousness (0, normal; 1, restless; 2,
lethargic; 3, stuporous; 4, seizures; 5, death), walking
(0, normal; 1, paw; 2, unbalanced walking; 3, circling; 4,
unable to stand; 5, no movement), limb tone (0, normal;
1, spastic; 2, ﬂaccid), and pain reﬂex (Harada et al.,
2009). Pain reﬂex was assessed using the tail-ﬂick test
(pain reﬂex = latency after MCAO  latency before
MCAO). The diﬀerence in latency was reﬂected in the
NDS. A cutoﬀ time of 10 s was used to prevent any injury
to the tail.
Brain tissue preparation
Mice were deeply anesthetized with diethyl ether and
perfused transcardially with saline, followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde. Brain sections were collected, postﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 h, cryoprotected in
10% sucrose at 4 °C for 3 h and then in 20% sucrose at
4 °C overnight. Tissues were then frozen in optimal
cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek OCT
Compound, Sakura Finetek, Tokyo, Japan) and held at
80 °C until use. Sections were cut (15-lm thick) with a
cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and
mounted on a MAS-coated glass slide (Matsunami
Glass, Osaka, Japan).

Measurement of fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels

Double immunoﬂuorescence of mouse brain

Starting at 9 h after the onset of MCAO, mice were fasted
for 15 h to measure FBG levels. Blood samples (up to
1.5 lL) were obtained from their tail veins. Plasma FBG
was measured using a Glucose Pilot (Aventir Biotech,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). The amount of change in FBG
levels was calculated as previously described (Harada
et al., 2009) using the following formula: change in FBG
levels = FBG after MCAO  FBG before MCAO (preMCAO FBG). Pre-MCAO FBG was measured 48–96 h
before the MCAO. Mice were fasted for 15 h and measured at same time of FBG after MCAO. There is no different of pre-MCAO FBG in all groups.

Brain sections were incubated in 4% formalin for 10 min,
washed with phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS) containing
0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T; 5 min  3 times) and incubated
with blocking buﬀer (3% BSA in PBS) for 1 h at room
temperature. The sections were then incubated (24 h at
4 °C) with the primary antibodies (in reaction buﬀer [1%
BSA in PBS]): rabbit polyclonal anti-SGLT-1 (1:50;
Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.), monoclonal anti-mouse
neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN, 1:1000; Millipore),
mouse monoclonal anti-glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein
(GFAP, 1:1000; Millipore). Sections were then washed
with PBS-T (5 min  3 times) and incubated (2 h, room
temperature) with Alexa Fluor 488 and/or 594conjugated donkey polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG, goat
polyclonal anti-mouse IgG (all diluted 1:200 in reaction
buﬀer; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A small
volume of 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Boshide
Biological Engineering Co., Wuhan, China) was added
to the brain sections, and the slides were incubated for
10 min. Sections were then washed with PBS-T
(5 min  3) and coverslips with Fluoromount/PlusTM
(Diagnostic BioSystems, CA, USA) were placed.

Measurement of infarct volume
Mice were killed and their brains were immediately
dissected to assess the development of infarction on
day 3 after the MCAO. The brains were cut into 2-mmthick coronal slices. The brain slices were incubated
with 2% TTC (Sigma–Aldrich) in saline for 10 min at
37 °C. The stained slices were ﬁxed with 4%
paraformaldehyde (Sigma–Aldrich), and the infarct

before the post hoc tests. Values of P < 0.05 were
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

RESULTS
Primary cortical neuronal cultures
Primary cortical neurons were prepared from fetuses
obtained from 17-day pregnant ddY mice, as modiﬁed
from
previously
described
(Fujita-Hamabe
and
Tokuyama, 2012). Dissociated cortical neurons were
plated in 96-well plates, for survival experiments, or in
six-well plates, for Western blot analysis, at a density of
1.5  105 cells/cm2. Plates were coated with poly-Dornithine (100 lg/mL; Sigma–Aldrich). Cells were cultured
in Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s Medium/Ham’s F-12 (with
L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1piperazineethanesulfonic acid; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto,
Japan). The medium was supplemented with 5% heatinactivated horse serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA), 5% heat-inactivated bovine serum (Biowest,
Nuaillé, France), 100 U/mL penicillin (Invitrogen), and
0.1 mg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen), and the cells were
maintained in a humidiﬁed incubator with 5% CO2 at
37 °C. Cytosine b-D-arabinofuranoside (0.1 lM; Sigma–
Aldrich) was added to the cultures on the second day after
seeding (second day in vitro [DIV 2]) to inhibit the proliferation of non-neuronal cells. In this culture preparation,
>90% of cells are neurons (Fujita-Hamabe and
Tokuyama, 2012). Primary cortical neurons were cultured
for 5 days (DIV 5) before treatment with reagents.
Components’ treatment and determination of survival
rate
Primary cortical neurons were exposed to oxidative stress
by treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 50, 100, or
200 lM; Santoku Chemical Industries Co, Tokyo,
Japan). To assess neuronal death and expression of
protein, primary cortical neurons were exposed to
additional glucose (8.75, 17.5, or 70 mM; Nacalai
Tesque). Cell survival rates were estimated using the
WST-8 [2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] (Nacalai Tesque)
reduction assay (Dojindo, Tokyo, Japan) at 24 h after
reagents treatment. Each ﬁnal concentrations of glucose
after treatment are 1.5, 2, 5 times of original
concentration of medium for culture (each ﬁnal
concentration of glucose in medium for culture after
treatment: 1.5, 26.25 mM; 2, 35 mM: 5, 87.5 mM).
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean ± standard error of the
mean (SEM). FBG levels, infarct volume, and SGLT-1
expression levels were analyzed using a one-way
analysis of variance followed by Scheﬀe’s post hoc test.
The NDS was analyzed using the Steel–Dwass test with
the post hoc non-parametric multiple comparison test,
and the data are presented as medians (25th–75th
percentile). WST-8 reduction was analyzed using a oneway analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s test.
Normality and equal variance were tested for all data

Distribution of SGLT-1 and the eﬀect of SGLT-1
siRNA administration on the expression levels of
SGLT-1 and -3 in the naive mouse brain
SGLT-1 was widely distributed throughout the brains of
mice, such as the cortex, striatum, hippocampus,
hypothalamus, cerebellum, midbrain, medulla, and
olfactory bulb (Fig. 1A). Compared with the control
siRNA-treated group, the expression of SGLT-1 was
signiﬁcantly decreased on day 4–5 and recovered on
day 6 after SGLT-1 siRNA injection (Fig. 1B). In
contrast, no eﬀect on the expression of SGLT-3 was
observed on day 4–6 after SGLT-1 siRNA injection
compared with the control siRNA-treated group (Fig. 1C).
Eﬀect of SGLT-1 siRNA treatment on the
development of cerebral ischemic neuronal damage
In the sham group, FBG levels were not aﬀected by
SGLT-1 siRNA treatment (Fig. 2A). The increment of
FBG levels on day 1 after MCAO was unaﬀected by
SGLT-1 siRNA compared with that in the control siRNAtreated MCAO group (Fig. 2A). However, SGLT-1
siRNA administration signiﬁcantly ameliorated the
development of infarction on day 1 after the MCAO
compared with the control siRNA treatment (Fig. 2B, C).
SGLT-1 siRNA alone had no eﬀect on neurological
abnormalities in the sham group (Fig. 2D). The
development
of
MCAO-induced
neurological
abnormalities was attenuated by SGLT-1 siRNA
administration compared with the control siRNA-treated
MCAO group (Fig. 2D).
Localization of SGLT-1 within neurons and
astrocytes in the cortex and striatum after cerebral
ischemic stress
In the cortex and striatum, SGLT-1 was co-localized with
NeuN, a neuronal marker, but not with GFAP, an
astrocytic marker, in sham or MCAO mice on day 1 and
3 after MCAO (Figs. 3 and 4).
Changes in the expression levels of cerebral SGLT-1
after MCAO
Although the expression of cortical SGLT-1 did not
change in the ﬁrst 6 h after reperfusion, cortical SGLT-1
expression signiﬁcantly increased compared with that in
the sham group at 12 h after reperfusion (Fig. 5A). The
expression of striatal SGLT-1 began to increase 6 h
after reperfusion, and was signiﬁcantly increased 12 h
after reperfusion compared with that in the sham group
(Fig. 5B). This increase in SGLT-1 expression in the
cortex and striatum returned to sham levels on day 3
after the MCAO (Fig. 5A, B). By contrast, cerebral
ischemic stress did not aﬀect the expression levels of
SGLT-1 in the hippocampus and hypothalamus at any
of the experimental time points (Fig. 5C, D).

Involvement of AMPK in the up-regulation of SGLT-1
and neuronal cell death
8.75 and 17.5 mM glucose treatment had no eﬀect on the
neuronal SGLT-1 expression levels (Fig. 6A). However,
70 mM glucose treatment increased the neuronal SGLT1 expression levels (Fig. 6A). Neuronal SGLT-1
expression was unaltered following treatment with
100 lM H2O2 (Fig. 6B). However, concomitant treatment
with 100 lM H2O2 and additional 8.75 mM glucose
increased the levels of SGLT-1 expression (Fig. 6B).
This increase was signiﬁcantly suppressed by 10 lM of
compound C (Fig. 6B). In contrast, 10 lM compound C
alone treatment had no eﬀect on SGLT-1 expression
(Fig. 6C). pAMPK/AMPK ratio was increased by H2O2
or glucose treatment in a concentration-dependent
manner (Fig. 6D, E). Moreover, 200 lM H2O2 and
additional 70 mM glucose signiﬁcantly increased the
pAMPK/AMPK ratio (Fig. 6D, E). Concomitant treatment
with 100 lM H2O2 and additional 8.75 mM glucose
induced a signiﬁcant increment of pAMPK/AMPK ratio,
and this increment was suppressed by compound C
treatment (Fig. 6F). By contrast, pAMPK/AMPK ratio
was unaﬀected by 10 lM of compound C alone
treatment (Fig. 6G). The addition of 8.75 mM glucose
exacerbated the H2O2-induced neuronal cell death, and
this exacerbation was suppressed by compound C
treatment (Fig. 6H).

DISCUSSION
We have previously reported that post-ischemic
hyperglycemia exacerbates cerebral ischemic neuronal
damage (Harada et al., 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013b). To
elucidate the mechanism underlying this exacerbation,
we have focused on the SGLT family as a potential key
mediator of glucose transport.
Phlorizin, an SGLT family-speciﬁc inhibitor, has
been reported to improve the development of cerebral
ischemic neuronal damage in focal and global cerebral
ischemic models (Yamazaki et al., 2012; Harada
et al., 2013a). Moreover, oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death was exacerbated by additional glucose
treatment, which mimics post-ischemic hyperglycemia,
in a phlorizin-reversible manner (Yamazaki et al.,
2015). On the other hand, cerebral SGLT-3, one of
the SGLT isoforms, suppressed the development of
cerebral ischemic neuronal damage in our previous
study (Yamazaki et al., 2014). Therefore, other cerebral
SGLT isoforms, such as SGLT-1, -4, and -6, may also
be involved in the development of ischemic neuronal
damage. In particular, we have already reported that
cortical SGLT-1 signiﬁcantly increased on day 1 after
MCAO (Yamazaki et al., 2012). Hence, in the present
study, we focused on the involvement of SGLT-1 in
cerebral ischemia.

SGLT-1 transports two Na+ ions for every glucose
molecule (Loo et al., 2000; Zeuthen et al., 2001). Thus,
SGLT-1-induced inward currents are dependent on the
concentration of glucose (Bormans et al., 2003). Hyperglycemia occurring in diabetes induces an increase in
SGLT-1 expression levels in small intestinal epithelial
cells and tubular glands (Malatiali et al., 2008; Krimi
et al., 2009). Recently, increases in AMPK activity were
reported to lead to the up-regulation of cardiac SGLT-1
(Banerjee et al., 2010). In addition, cortical pAMPK/AMPK
ratio was signiﬁcantly increased on day 1 after focal cerebral ischemia (Harada et al., 2010). The activation of
cerebral AMPK exacerbates neuronal damage (Li et al.,
2007; Harada et al., 2010; Li and McCullough, 2010).
Moreover, compound C, an AMPK inhibitor improves
the development of cerebral ischemic neuronal damage
(Harada et al., 2010). Thus, cerebral ischemic stressinduced phosphorylation of AMPK may increase cerebral

SGLT-1 expression levels and exacerbate cerebral
ischemia.
SGLT-1 was widely distributed in the brain throughout
the cortex and striatum, an ischemic core region, as well
as in the hippocampus, an ischemic penumbra region that
is salvageable. The SGLT-1 KD did not aﬀect the
expression of SGLT-3, indicating that SGLT-1 does not
interact with SGLT-3. Interestingly, the cerebral SGLT-1
KD ameliorated the development of cerebral ischemic
neuronal damage without altering hyperglycemia. These
results indicate that the activation of cerebral SGLT-1,
resulting in the excessive inﬂux of glucose and Na+,
may exacerbate the development of cerebral ischemic
neuronal damage. Additionally, we conﬁrmed the
detailed expression of SGLT-1 in the mouse brain after
an MCAO in the present study. SGLT-1 distributes in
neuron but not glial cell such as astrocyte in normal
mice brain as previous reports (Poppe et al., 1997;

ischemic stress on SGLT-1 distribution has not yet been
conﬁrmed. In the present results, the distribution of cerebral SGLT-1 was not aﬀected by cerebral ischemic stress.

Astrocytes play an important role in the development of
cerebral ischemia as reported by numerous researchers
(Takano et al., 2009; Ding, 2014; Hertz et al., 2014;

was predicted that neuronal SGLT-1 directly eﬀect on
neuronal cell death in cerebral ischemic condition. In the
cortex and striatum, the increase in the expression of
SGLT-1 observed 12 h after the MCAO was well
correlated with the previously described change in FBG
after an MCAO (Harada et al., 2009).
SGLT induces an inward current and a membrane
depolarization (Wright et al., 2011). Cerebral ischemia
induces membrane depolarization which leads a catastrophic failure of the brain’s ion, volume, and neurotransmitter homeostatic machinery (Dreier, 2011; Drenckhahn
et al., 2015; Enger et al., 2015). Therefore, development
of post-ischemic hyperglycemia may induce excessive
depolarization of neuronal membranes resulting in great
inﬂuxes of glucose and Na+ through SGLT, and exacerbate the development of cerebral ischemic neuronal damage. Moreover, it is common knowledge that glutamate
receptors, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate and a-amino-3hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors,
and voltage-dependent calcium channels play an important role in the inﬂux of Ca2+ into the cell (McDonald
et al., 1998; Morikawa et al., 1998). In cerebral stroke, this
Ca2+ overload induces excitotoxicity and development of
cerebral ischemic neuronal damage (Nicholls, 2009;
Zheng et al., 2013). The SGLT-mediated excessive depolarization may lead to glutamate release and voltagedependent calcium channel opening. In fact, Na+ inﬂux
through SGLT induces increment of [Ca2+]i in hypothalamic neurons (O’Malley et al., 2006). Furthermore, it has
been reported that the glucose-induced increment of

intracellular ATP and reactive oxygen species induces
apoptosis (Serra-Pérez et al., 2008; Costa et al., 2012).
The exacerbation of cerebral ischemia through SGLT
may mediate various pathways.
Finally, we examined primary cortical neurons to
clarify the involvement of AMPK activation in the upregulation of cerebral SGLT-1 mediated by cerebral
ischemic stress. As shown in our previous report, H2O2
(100 lM)-induced oxidative stress, as an in vitro
ischemic model, was exacerbated by additional glucose
(8.75 mM), which had no eﬀect itself on neuronal cell
death, and this exacerbation was suppressed by
phlorizin treatment (Yamazaki et al., 2015). Oxidative
stress is known as one of the major causes that provoke
damage to neuronal cell under ischemic stress (Dirnagl
et al., 1999), this in vitro culture model using cortical neuron is considered to mimic the neuronal damage observed
in in vivo ischemic model animal in the point of view of
oxidative stress. In the present experiments, compound
C treatment had no eﬀect on pAMPK/AMPK ratio and
SGLT-1 expression levels. In contrast, concomitant treatment with H2O2 and glucose induced an increment of
pAMPK/AMPK ratio and SGLT-1 expression levels in a
compound C-reversible manner. Moreover, 70 mM glucose treatment induced an increment of pAMPK/AMPK
ratio and SGLT-1 expression levels. These results
indicated that the activation of AMPK is involved in the
up-regulation of SGLT-1. The promoter of the SLC5A1
gene encoding SGLT1 contains the two binding sites for
the speciﬁcity protein 1 (Sp1) that increases transcription

(Martı́n et al., 2000). Neuronal Sp1 is activated during
oxidative stress and hypoxia (Ryu et al., 2003; Lee
et al., 2004, 2006; Miki et al., 2004; Yeh et al., 2011).
Ischemic stress induces an increment of Sp1 mRNA
(Yeh et al., 2011). Cerebral ischemic stress or

hyperglycemia activates p-38 and ERK1/2, and these
substances regulate the activation of SP1 that eventually
resulted in the increased transcription of Sp1-dependent
genes (Grell et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2014; Chen et al.,
2015; Kiss et al., 2015). Moreover, Sp1 binding activity

Y. Yamazaki et al. / Neuroscience 310 (2015) 674–685

is increased by phosphorylation by AMPK (Hahn et al.,
2014). AMPK causes translocation of SGLT-1 from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane and an increase
in glucose uptake (Hirsch et al., 1996). Thus, the activation of AMPK after cerebral ischemia may increase
SGLT-1 expression. The ameliorating eﬀect of compound
C may be mediated by the inhibition of the up-regulation
of SGLT-1 via suppression of pAMPK/AMPK ratio under
conditions of concomitant treatment with H2O2 and
glucose-induced neuronal cell death. As other possibility,
cerebral ischemia leads endoplasmic reticulum stress,
which induces neuronal cell death (Xu et al., 2005;
Krajewska et al., 2011). Endoplasmic reticulum stress
through the endoplasmic reticulum stress sensors
GPR78 or eIF2a, and it initiates JNK and NF-jB signaling
to increase membrane SGLT-1 expression levels and glucose uptake amount (Lee et al., 2009). This phenomenon
may need to be conﬁrmed in further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
The inhibition of cerebral SGLT-1 may be clinically
relevant in cerebral ischemia. Moreover, the increment
of pAMPK/AMPK ratio by oxidative stress and high
glucose conditions may be partially because of the upregulation mechanism of SGLT-1. Therefore, our results
may have signiﬁcant therapeutic potential for the
management of cerebral ischemia.
