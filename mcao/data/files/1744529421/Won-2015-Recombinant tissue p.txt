Background: Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is one of the few approved treatments for stroke, but its
effects on the phenotype of microglia/macrophages are poorly understood. One of its side effects is an
increase in the inﬂammatory response leading to neuronal cell damage and death in the ischemic cascade
after stroke. Injury-induced activated microglia/macrophages can have dual functions as
pro-inﬂammatory (M1) and anti-inﬂammatory (M2) factors in brain injury and repair. Recent studies
show that progesterone (PROG) is a potent anti-inﬂammatory agent which affects microglia/macrophage
expression after brain injury. Purpose: We examined the interaction of tPA-induced expression of
microglia/macrophage phenotypes and PROG’s anti-inﬂammatory effects. Results: tPA treatment
increased the recruitment of microglia/macrophages, the polarity of M1 reactions, the expression of
MIP-1a in neurons and capillaries, and the expression of MMP-3 compared to vehicle, and PROG modulated these effects. Conclusions: PROG treatment attenuates tPA-induced inﬂammatory alterations in
brain capillaries and microglia/macrophages both in vivo and in vitro and thus may be a useful adjunct
therapy when tPA is given for stroke.

1. Introduction
Decades of study on ischemia-induced cell death have slowly
revealed a complex cascade of cytotoxic mechanisms including
oxidative stress, intracellular calcium poisoning, excitotoxicity via
glutamate receptor activity, and cytokine-induced necrosis, apoptosis and inﬂammation (Moretti et al., 2014). Neuroinﬂammation
via activation of proinﬂammatory genes such as nuclear factor
kappa B (NF-kB) and interleukin 1 (IL-1) is recognized as a key contributor to ischemic injury and poor functional outcomes. This
gene activation induces the release of effector molecules which
then provoke an increase in the expression of adhesion molecules,
proinﬂammatory cytokines, and chemokines, followed by recruitment to the injury site of resident microglia, peripheral macrophages and other immune cells. Macrophages further accelerate
the inﬂammatory response of brain by causing the activation of
resident immune cells, leading to blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, neuronal cell death, and hemorrhagic transformation (Riazi
et al., 2010). Studies on macrophages and other immune cells have

helped to conﬁrm the deleterious role of leukocytes and innate
immune cells in experimental stroke (Kim et al., 2014).
In the United States, the only currently FDA-approved treatment for stroke is thrombolytic therapy using recombinant human
tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). However, tPA is given to only
about 3–5% of stroke patients due to its narrow therapeutic time
window of 3.5–4.5 h and its potentially toxic side effects, which
include an increased risk of hemorrhagic conversion. Hemor
rhagic conversion is characterized by increased bleeding into the
brain leading to further neuronal loss, inﬂammation, and increased
cerebral edema. A recent clinical study has shown that the time
window for tPA administration cannot be safely extended without
loss of effectiveness (Saver et al., 2013).
Although there is some evidence that tPA can itself protect neural tissue by promoting dendritic spine recovery and mediating
adaptation to metabolic stress as well as dissolving blood clots
(I.M.S. Study Investigators, 2004; Wu et al., 2013, 2014; Yepes
et al., 2009), it has also been reported that endogenous tPA
secreted from injured neurons can act as a cytokine to activate
and induce the proliferation of microglia at the site of injury
(Siao et al., 2003). This reaction could be detrimental to functional
and morphological recovery after stroke.

Several groups have previously shown that tPA binds to cells
with tPA receptors such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
(PAI-1) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/
a2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP) within the blood vessel wall
(Orth et al., 1994). The role of the tPA–LRP–PAI-1 complex in the
coordination of migration in macrophages and in internalization
and degradation in vasculature has now been established (Orth
et al., 1994; Grobmyer et al., 1993; Cao et al., 2006), but the effects
and mechanisms of exogenous tPA on microglia activation/migration are not completely known and its side effects can be a problem
for stroke patients.
An increasing number of studies now show that microglia/macrophages are highly plastic cells with diverse phenotypes that
can be beneﬁcial or detrimental in response to speciﬁc microenvironmental signals following brain injury. The polarization of resident microglia and peripheral macrophages and other immune
cells has been described as a functional dichotomy: classical
(M1) and alternative (M2) activation (Murray and Wynn, 2011;
Lawrence and Natoli, 2011). Classical M1 activation is induced by
lipopolysaccharide/interferon-c (LPS/IFN-c) or Th1 cytokines associated with the production of proinﬂammatory molecules such as
IL-12, IL-23, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), chemokines, and
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), all of which can be damaging to neurons (Hu et al., 2012). Alternative activation (M2 polarization) is induced by Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-13, or IL-10. These
M2 microglia/macrophages express different molecules associated
with the expression of scavenger receptors and proangiogenic factors such as mannose receptor, dectin-1, and arginase, which are
involved in neuroprotective effects (Ponomarev et al., 2007;
David and Kroner, 2011). The dual roles of polarized microglia/macrophages are seen in several CNS disorders including stroke,
multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury
(Hu et al., 2012; Mikita et al., 2011; Kigerl et al., 2009; Wang
et al., 2013). However, the speciﬁc actions of these polarized
microglia/macrophages in the pathology of stroke after tPA treatment have not been explored.
There is now substantial preclinical literature showing that the
steroid hormone progesterone (PROG) has neuroprotective effects.
It can reduce inﬂammation, BBB permeability and edema in a variety of acute brain injury models including traumatic brain injury,
ischemic stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (Young et al.,
2012; Cekic et al., 2012; Ishrat et al., 2012). We recently reported
that treatment with PROG inhibits delayed tPA-induced BBB disruption and cerebral hemorrhage after transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) via regulation of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF)/matrix metallproteinase-9 (MMP-9) (Won
et al., 2014). In the present study, we analyzed endothelial cell activation and chemokine expression in bEnd.3 cells after hypoxia followed by tPA treatment. We also studied the recruitment and
M1/M2 polarization of microglia/macrophages and MMP-3 expression after transient MCAO or hypoxia using BV2 microglial cells
exposed to tPA treatment. Based on previous literature and our
own observations, we examined the idea that after ischemic injury,
cross-talk between brain endothelial cells and microglial/macrophage
cells
given
tPA
treatment
will
worsen
stroke-induced BBB disruption and that PROG administration will
ameliorate this condition.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 39), approximately 3 months old
(300–350 g) at the time of surgery, were obtained from Charles
River (Wilmington, MA, USA) and used as subjects. All animals

were housed in an AAALAC-approved Research Animal Facility
with a temperature-, humidity-, and light-controlled environment,
and placed under a 12-h reverse light–dark cycle. Public Health
Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals,
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and all other
applicable regulations, policies, and procedures, were followed and
approved by Emory University Institutional Animal Use and Care
Committee (protocol #DAR-2001411). The experiments are
reported here in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines. The rats
were quarantined for 7 days before the experiment and housed
in individual cages in a room maintained at 21–25 °C, 45–50%
humidity, and free access to pellet chow and water. At the completion of the study, and for the purpose of histology, all animals were
anesthetized with 5% isoﬂurane and euthanized by guillotine after
transcardiac perfusion at 24 h after stroke surgery.
2.2. Transient focal ischemia
The rats were anesthetized with isoﬂurane (5% for surgical
induction, 2–2.5% for maintenance) in NO2:O2 (70%:30%) during
the surgery. Body temperature was monitored continuously with
a rectal probe and maintained at 37.5 ± 0.5 °C using a heating lamp.
We used our standard laboratory procedures as follows: for monitoring MCAO and reperfusion, cerebral blood ﬂow was assessed
by laser Doppler ﬂowmetry using a probe ﬁxed to the skull above
the territory of the right MCA (core cortex: 2 mm posterior and
6 mm lateral to bregma). The rats were placed in a modiﬁed stereotaxic frame equipped with a facemask. A midline incision was
made at the ventral surface of the neck and a 6–0 silk suture was
used to separate and ligate the right common carotid arteries.
Next, a microvascular clip was used to temporarily occlude the
internal carotid and pterygopalatine arteries while a 4–0
silicon-coated monoﬁlament (0.35–0.40 mm long) (Doccol Co.,
Albuquerque, NM, USA) was inserted through the cut in the external carotid artery and into the internal carotid artery. This ﬁlament
was pushed an estimated 20 mm distal to the carotid bifurcation to
a point at which the laser Doppler-cerebral blood ﬂow signal
abruptly decreased, indicating low cortical blood ﬂow. The ﬁlament was left in place for 4 h 30 min and then withdrawn gently
back into the common carotid artery to allow reperfusion. Rats
subjected to MCAO with less than 40% of baseline laser Doppler
ﬂowmetry were randomly assigned to receive drug treatments.
Sham animals were anesthetized, an incision was made and the
fascia cleared to expose the bregma at the top of the head. Next,
a midline neck incision was made and the common carotid and
internal carotid arteries were isolated and exposed. Last, the incision was sutured closed. Twenty-four hours after the ischemic
injury and drug treatments, the animals were euthanized for the
collection of brain tissue samples.
2.3. Experimental groups and in vivo drug treatment
We calculated the starting sample sizes to be at least 6 animals/group to reject the null hypothesis (H0) at p < 0.05 with a
power of 0.80 to observe at least a 50% difference between treatment and sham-operated controls. Animals underwent tMCAO or
sham surgery and were assigned, in no particular order to one of
four treatment groups: sham (CTRL), MCAO + vehicle (saline),
MCAO + tPA alone, MCAO + tPA + PROG. PROG (8 mg/kg in 22.5%
w/v 2-hydroxyropyl-b-cyclodextran solution) was given intraperitoneally 2 h post-occlusion for faster absorption followed by a subcutaneous injection for slower and sustained absorption at 6 h
post-occlusion. Previous studies have shown 8 mg/kg to be the
optimally effective PROG dose in a stroke model (Ishrat et al.,
2009, 2010). Physiologic saline with tPA (Genentech, San
Francisco, CA, USA) was administered (10% bolus, 90% continuous

S. Won et al. / Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 49 (2015) 267–279

infusion within 30 min) to the rats via femoral vein beginning
10 min before reperfusion at 5 mg/kg, a dose shown to have optimal ﬁbrinolytic activity with lower mortality (Saver et al., 2013;
Zhu et al., 2010) (see Table 1).
2.4. Cell and tissue processing for immunoblotting
Peri-infarct cortical tissue was processed for protein analysis.
Tissues were ﬁrst homogenized in T-per (Pierce, Rockford, IL,
USA) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340, Sigma).
Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000g. Forty micrograms of total protein was separated on 8–12% gel and transferred
onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) membranes at 300 mA for 2 h. bEnd.3 cells and BV2 cells were subjected
to hypoxia/reoxygenation and then lysed on ice in 100 lL of RIPA
buffer. Total cell lysates were boiled and then electrophoresed in
12% SDS–PAGE acrylamide gels, transferred onto polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride membranes, and incubated for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline
with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA). Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against Iba-1 (Wako, Osaka, Japan; 1:1000), CD68
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; 1:1000), ICAM-1, MMP-9, and
MMP-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA; 1:1000),
washed in TBS–T, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with
corresponding peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (KPL,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA; 1:5000). All blots were stripped and
re-incubated with b-actin antibodies (Sigma; 1:5000) as a loading
control. The peroxidase reaction was developed with an ECL-plus
detection kit (Amersham BioSciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
Intensity of the bands was measured using Image Gauge 4.0 (FUJI
Film, Tokyo, Japan).
2.5. Immunostaining in hypoxia/reperfusion-treated BV2 cells and in
brain tissue
2.5.1. Euthanasia
After rats were deeply anesthetized with 5% isoﬂurane, they
were
subjected
to
transcardiac
perfusion
with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4), and formalin, and their
brains were removed and ﬁxed in formalin and immersed in 30%
sucrose for 3–4 days at 4 °C. Frozen brains were coronally sectioned at slice thickness of 25 lm on a Cryostat (Leica
Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Forebrain coronal sections were selected from +4.0 mm to 4.0 mm relative to the
bregma for histology. Every 6th section was saved for histological
analysis.
2.5.2. Immunocytochemistry
For immunostaining, BV2 cells were grown to conﬂuence on
uncoated coverslips. Cells and brain tissues were washed 3 times
with PBS, ﬁxed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized
with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and blocked with 10%

BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h. After washing with
PBS, the monolayers were incubated with a primary antibody for
Iba-1 (Wako; 1:200), CD68 (Abcam; 1:200), and MMP-3 (Santa
Cruz; 1:400) overnight at 4 °C. The cell monolayers were then
washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488
anti-rabbit and orange anti-mouse (Molecular Probes, Eugene,
OR, USA) for 1 h. After washing in PBS, the coverslips were
mounted on glass slides with Vectashield with 40 ,6-diamidi
no-2-phenylindole (DAPI).

2.6. Cell culture and materials
2.6.1. bEnd.3 endothelial cells and BV2 microglial cell lines
An immortalized mouse brain endothelial cell line (bEnd.3) and
a BV2 microglia cell line were purchased from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle medium (DMEM; ATCC) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (ATCC). Cell cultures were incubated
at 37 °C in a 5/95% mixture of CO2 and atmospheric air, and the
medium was replaced every 3 days (see below for measurement
details).

2.6.2. Primary microglia cultures from adult rat brain
Primary microglia cells were isolated from adult rat brains
(n = 3) as described in Lee and Tansey (2013). Brieﬂy, rat brains
were isolated and minced after perfusion. The minced tissues were
digested using dissociating enzyme solution containing papain
(1 mg/mL)–dispase (1.2 U/mL)–DNase (20 U/mL) for 20 min at
37 °C followed by neutralization with serum containing medium
(DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum, 1% penicillin–streptomycin, 1% glucose, and 1% L-glutamine
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA)). Microglia were separated by
collecting the 30%:37% Percoll layer interface of a 30%:37%:70%
Percoll gradient. Cells were cleansed of Percoll with 1 Hank’s
Balanced Salt Solution and re-suspended in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum.

2.7. In vitro drug treatment
Cells were treated with 10 or 20 lmol/L of PROG (Sigma) for
24 h before hypoxia/reperfusion. In all cases, the treatment with
tPA or PROG + tPA (20 lg/mL) was continued throughout the
hypoxia/reperfusion period. PROG was dissolved in DMSO
(Sigma) and further dilutions (0.1%) were made with culture
medium.

2.8. Normoxia and hypoxia/reperfusion study
Normoxic cells were transferred into a serum-free medium of
glucose-containing (4.5 g/L) phenol red-free DMEM. To mimic
ischemic conditions in vitro, bEnd.3 cells were exposed to 2-h
hypoxia with or without the administration of tPA. We used a
tPA dose of 20 lg/mL, based on the ﬁnding that such a concentration can be detected in blood (Godfrey et al., 1998). In brief, conﬂuent bEnd.3 cells were subjected to an ischemic injury by
transferring cultures to glucose-free medium (DMEM without glucose) pre-equilibrated with 95% N2/5% CO2. Cells were then incubated in a humidiﬁed airtight chamber equipped with an air lock
and ﬂushed with 95% N2/5% CO2. The oxygen concentration was
60.1% as monitored by an oxygen analyzer (Biospherix, Redﬁeld,
NY,
USA).
Reoxygenation
was
initiated
by
adding
glucose-containing (4.5 g/L) phenol red-free DMEM for 3 h at
37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2.

2.9. Reverse transcription or real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells or tissue with TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Reverse transcription was done with High-Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA). PCR ampliﬁcation using speciﬁc primer sets was carried
out at an annealing temperature of 55–60 °C for 20–30 cycles. For
the analysis of the PCR products, 10 lL of each PCR product was
electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and detected under UV light.
GAPDH was used as an internal control. For measuring gene
expression in vitro, real-time PCR was done with an ABI 7500
Fast Real-Time system (Applied Biosystems). Nucleotide sequences
of the primers were based on published cDNA sequences (Table 2).

2.10. Cell migration assays in vitro
Cell migration was detected using an in vitro Boyden chamber
assay and a co-cultivation assay. Microglia were suspended in
standard medium, and 3  104 cells were seeded to the upper well
of each Transwell insert (Corning Life Sciences, Tewksbury MA;
8.0-lm pore size), which bore an uncoated ﬁlter with 8-lm diameter holes. The lower well contained only medium. Microglia were
incubated for 24 h (37 °C, 5% CO2) and then treated with either tPA
or tPA + PROG under hypoxia. The cell-bearing ﬁlters were ﬁxed in
4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, rinsed with PBS, and the microglia remaining on the upper side of each ﬁlter were removed with
a Q-tip. The cells migrating to the underside were stained with
DAPI and counted at 20 magniﬁcation with an Olympus IX71
microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). For the co-cultivation assay,
bEnd.3 cells and BV2 microglia were seeded and conﬂuent-grown
on glass slides in a petri dish. For 3-h hypoxia, the cells were given
either tPA or tPA + PROG under hypoxia. The glass slides with cells
on them were then placed in a petri dish for 16 h. After removing
the glass cover slide, the cells were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 10 min and rinsed with PBS. The migrated cells were counted

antibody of Iba-1.
2.11. Statistical analysis
Based on a delta-value of 1.25, we calculated the sample sizes
and power needed to achieve >80% power to detect an estimated
effect size of 50% difference between treatment and placebo controls. The number of rats per group at these criteria was determined to be at least 6. The parameters were analyzed using
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey post
hoc test. All data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. All tests were considered statistically signiﬁcant at p values 6 0.05. Conﬁdence intervals are provided to show that there is 95% certainty that the
means reported will fall within the intervals designated in the
obtained results. This is a better visual presentation of effect size
(see Cumming, 2012, Chapter 4, for more details on these
procedures).
3. Results
3.1. tPA increases microglia/macrophage inﬁltration
We previously showed that tPA treatment at 4.5 h after stroke
induced cerebral hemorrhage with BBB disruption (Won et al.,
2014). Here, we sought to characterize the effects of tPA on inﬂammation at 4.5 h after stroke. First, to examine whether tPA treatment can induce changes in the recruitment of immune cells
after MCAO, and whether PROG treatment can attenuate that
effect, we subjected Iba-1 and CD 68-positive microglia/macrophages to immunostaining and Western blot assays. As
revealed by DAB immunostaining, the Iba-1 and CD68-positive
microglia/macrophages in the MCAO group showed an increased
number of amoeboid-shaped cells with thick processes indicative
of activated cells in perivascular regions and in brain parenchyma
compared with controls. This response was higher after
MCAO + tPA treatment (Fig. 1A). PROG inhibited the tPA-induced
recruitment of Iba-1-positive and CD68-positive microglia/macrophages after MCAO (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis also
showed that tPA treatment produced a signiﬁcant increase in
Iba-1 (p < 0.05, 95% CI 1.893 to 0.8610) and CD68 protein
(p < 0.05, 95% CI 76.34 to 2.441) expression which was suppressed by PROG treatment (p < 0.05, 95% CI 0.2854–1.128 for
Iba-1, 95% CI 0.2854–1.128 and for CD68, 4.798–68.08) (Fig. 1B–
D). Together, these data suggest that tPA treatment after MCAO
activates resident brain microglia and increases recruitment of
peripheral macrophages to the injury area compared to MCAO
alone. PROG signiﬁcantly attenuates this inﬂammatory response.
3.2. tPA induces microglia/macrophage migration after hypoxia/
reoxygenation
Microglial cell migration is one of the main components of brain
responses to injury and inﬂammation (Block and Hong, 2005). To
verify whether tPA induces microglial cell migration after hypoxia/reoxygenation and whether treatment with PROG can attenuate
this effect, we performed two cell migration assays. In the transwell system, the migration of BV-2 microglial cells across a membrane was increased after hypoxia (0.1% O2) and then
reoxygenation, and further increased by tPA treatment compared
to controls (p < 0.0001, 95% CI = 40.67 to 22.00, Fig. 2A and C).
PROG treatment produced a signiﬁcant reduction in this effect
(p < 0.0001, 95% CI = 22.66–41.34, Fig. 2A and C).
Similar effects were observed in the co-cultivation assay using
both bEnd.3 cerebral endothelial cells and BV-2 microglial cells

S. Won et al. / Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 49 (2015) 267–279

271

migrated cells are not cerebral endothelial cells but are speciﬁcally
microglia and that PROG treatment produced a signiﬁcant reduction in microglial migration induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation
combined with tPA (p < 0.01, 95% CI = 9.221–40.78, Fig. 2B and D).
3.3. tPA induces the gene expression of MIP-1a and cerebral
endothelial cell activation after hypoxia/reoxygenation
Immune cell trafﬁcking is regulated by chemokines and cytokines, and by members of the integrin, immunoglobulin and adhesion molecule families (Luster et al., 2005; Weber and Koenen,
2006). We investigated the gene expression level of monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and MIP-1a in bEnd.3 cells
after hypoxia with tPA treatment. MCP-1 mRNA levels did not
change following hypoxia or hypoxia with tPA treatment, but
showed a signiﬁcant downregulation by tPA + PROG treatment
compared to tPA alone (p < 0.05, 95% CI = 0.06576–1.008,
Fig. 3A and B). MIP-1a appeared under hypoxia and was further
upregulated by tPA treatment under hypoxia (p < 0.05, 95%
CI = 6.369 to 0.5034, Fig. 3A and C). Treatment with
tPA + PROG downregulated MIP-1a expression compared to tPA
alone (p < 0.01, 95% CI = 1.051–6.644, Fig. 3A and C).
To determine whether tPA treatment after hypoxia leads to the
activation of endothelial cells leading to inﬁltration of peripheral
immune cells, we measured the expression of ICAM-1 with
Western blots. The protein expression of ICAM-1 was signiﬁcantly
increased after tPA treatment compared to hypoxia alone and to
controls (p < 0.05, 95% CI = 3.036 to 0.4041). tPA + PROG treatment produced a signiﬁcant attenuation in ICAM-1 in bEnd.3 cells
(p < 0.05, 95% CI = 0.2898–2.597, Fig. 3D and E). Furthermore,
MIP-1a expression was increased in Glut-1-positive brain capillaries and neurons after MCAO alone or after MCAO + tPA treatment
(Fig. 3F). Consistent with our in vitro results, the expression of
MIP-1a was signiﬁcantly higher in the tPA-treated group after
MCAO than with MCAO alone (p < 0.0001, 95% CI = 6.223 to
2.788). These increases in MIP-1a were almost completely inhibited by PROG treatment (p < 0.0001, 95% CI = 2.530–5.335, Fig. 3G).
3.4. The mRNA expression of M1/M2 markers after stroke and tPA
treatment
To examine the effect of tPA treatment after stroke on M1/M2
microglia/macrophage polarity, we used traditional RT-PCR for
M1/M2 markers. The expression of M1 markers iNOS, IL-1b, and
TNF-a was signiﬁcantly increased after stroke + tPA treatment
compared to MCAO alone (p < 0.0001, 95% CI = 12.59 to 3.102;
p < 0.05, 95% CI = 2.589 to 0.2288; and p < 0.0001, 95%
CI = 17.02 to 5.287, respectively, Fig. 4A–C). These increases
were signiﬁcantly attenuated by PROG + tPA after stroke compared
to tPA treatment alone (p < 0.01, 95% CI = 1.466–9.119; p < 0.0001,
95% CI = 0.6717–2.574; and p < 0.05, 95% CI = 0.1649–9.742,
respectively, Fig. 4A–C). The M2 markers IL-10 and arginase-1 were
not signiﬁcantly different across all groups (Fig. 4D and E).

treatment in BV2 microglia
Using the gene expression proﬁle of M1 and M2 markers in vivo
to conﬁrm the effect of tPA on M1 vs M2 polarization in brain
microglia, we characterized the gene expression proﬁle of microglia treated with tPA under hypoxia. RT-PCR analysis was performed for individual M1- and M2-related genes in primary
microglia isolated from adult brain and BV-2 cells. We observed
signiﬁcantly increased expression of the M1 genes TNF-a, IL-1b,
and iNOS with tPA treatment under hypoxia compared to hypoxia
alone or to control (p < 0.001, 95% CI = 6.134 to 3.028, 95%

CI = 4.355 to 3.274, and 95% CI = 4.583 to 1.665, respectively), which was decreased by PROG treatment (p < 0.001, 95%
CI = 6.134 to 3.028, 95% CI = 0.5467–1.628; and p < 0.01, 95%
CI = 0.4873–3.405, Fig. 5A(a–c)). The expression of M2 genes
IL-10 and Arg-1 were not altered after hypoxia. However, in primary microglia isolated from adult brain, PROG treatment
increased expression of these genes compared with tPA alone
under hypoxia (p < 0.001, 95% CI = 2.993 to 1.304; p < 0.05,
95% CI = 1.940 to 0.02546, respectively, Fig. 5A(d and e)). The
increased expression of the M1 genes iNOS and TNF-a was also signiﬁcantly higher with tPA treatment under hypoxia compared to

hypoxia alone or to controls (p < 0.001, 95% CI = 1.403 to
0.4038; and p < 0.01, 95% CI = 4.993 to 0.8527, respectively,
Fig. 5B(a and c)). In contrast, there was no signiﬁcant increase of
IL-23 mRNA in any of the groups (Fig. 5B(a–f)). The level of
M2-related mRNA (ARG1, Ym1, and FIZZ1) was not changed after
hypoxia with/without tPA treatment (Fig. 5B(d–f)).
There was a signiﬁcant effect of PROG treatment on the suppression of the tPA-induced, increased mRNA expression of M1
markers TNF-a and iNOS compared with tPA alone (p < 0.05, 95%
CI = 0.1431–1.191; and p < 0.05, 95% CI = 0.04723–4.187, respectively, Fig. 5B(a and c)). PROG increased the expression of

M2-related genes ARG1, Ym1, and FIZZ1 after hypoxia with tPA
treatment (p < 0.05, 95% CI = 1.836 to 0.1433; p < 0.05, 95%
CI = 2.383 to 0.3296; and p < 0.01, 95% CI = 2.621 to
0.3617, respectively, Fig. 5B(d–f)).
3.6. MMP-3 expression in microglia after stroke and tPA treatment
We evaluated MMP-3 expression after ischemia using Western
blot and immunoﬂuorescence staining. MMP-3 expression was signiﬁcantly higher in the tPA group compared to MCAO or sham
groups at 24 h (p < 0.05, 95% CI = 1.545 to 0.07111, Fig. 6A
and B). PROG treatment attenuated tPA-induced MMP-3 expression after stroke (p < 0.05, 95% CI = 0.02340–1.429, Fig. 6A and B).
MMP-3 was expressed by brain endothelial cells after MCAO. In
the tPA treatment group, MMP-3 expression was induced in brain
endothelial cells and in microglia seen around brain endothelial
cells in the penumbra of the infarcted areas. Double staining conﬁrmed that the microglia in contact with brain endothelial cells
were one of the cellular sources of MMP-3 after stroke + tPA treatment (Fig. 6C). This result was conﬁrmed with BV2 microglia after
hypoxia/reoxygenation with or without tPA treatment. Consistent
with the in vivo results, the induction of MMP-3/9 was more
prominent in tPA-treated hypoxia/reoxygenation cells than in control BV2 microglia (p < 0.01, 95% CI = 1.625 to 0.2466 for MMP-3
and p < 0.05, 95% CI = 0.5133 to 0.02638 for MMP-9). In contrast, the increases in MMP-3/9 were almost completely inhibited
when cells were pretreated with PROG (p < 0.0001, 95%
CI = 0.3858–1.561 for MMP-3 and p < 0.0001, 95% CI = 0.5863–
1.011 for MMP-9, Fig. 6D–F).
4. Discussion
Despite the fact that it can increase the incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage (Lees et al., 2010), tPA is the only thrombolytic
therapy shown to improve patient outcome in acute ischemic
stroke, but its pathophysiological role in causing neuroinﬂammation is still not completely understood. Our study reveals the
dynamic interaction between brain endothelial cells and microglia,
the polarization status of microglia following tPA treatment for
stroke, and the beneﬁcial effects of PROG on these inﬂammatory
components of tPA’s effects.
Besides its thrombolytic actions, tPA can cause brain injury
through its interaction with various receptors such as LRP (Zhang
et al., 2007), the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (Nicole et al.,
2001), or annexin II (Pineda et al., 2012). In addition, exogenous
tPA after stroke exacerbates mortality and increases cerebral
infarction, BBB disruption, and hemorrhage (Won et al., 2014).
Several studies have examined the role of endogenous tPA on cerebral infarction and BBB damage after cerebral stroke with tPA KO
mice (Wang et al., 1998; An et al., 2008; Nagai et al., 1999) and
have found that morbidity is attenuated in these genetically modiﬁed animals.

Microglia/macrophages are the primary mediators of the brain’s
innate immune response to injury and disease (Hu et al., 2012;
Loane and Byrnes, 2010). Recent research on the functions of
microglia in the injured CNS provides strong evidence to support
their phenotypic activation into either M1 or M2 subtypes and
their dual roles—both beneﬁcial and harmful. A large number of
studies indicate that microglia contribute to neuronal dysfunction
and cell death by releasing proinﬂammatory mediators such as
cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and MMPS (Min et al., 2004;
Woo et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2003). However, microglial activation

also exerts beneﬁcial effects in the injured brain because the cells
can remove cellular debris and help to restore tissue integrity
(Lalancette-Hebert et al., 2007). Thus, microglial activation after
stroke can participate in either or both of these processes. We
observed an increase in microglia after MCAO and both microglia
and macrophage reaction after MCAO with tPA treatment. Our
observation is in line with previous work in which microglia are
reported to be the ﬁrst immune cells to respond to ischemic injury
(Fig. 1) (Jin et al., 2010; Gelderblom et al., 2009).

4.2. ICAMs, MIP-1a and endothelial cells
The inﬁltration of macrophages with tPA treatment after stroke
can be traced to BBB disruption and hemorrhage, as we have
shown previously (Won et al., 2014). Leukocyte recruitment into
the brain is thought to involve a signaling cascade leading to ﬁrm
endothelial adhesion and subsequently to transmigration, which
largely depends on the upregulation of adhesion molecules such
as ICAM1, P-selectin, and E-selectin after cerebral ischemia (Rossi
et al., 2011). We found that tPA induces an increase of ICAM-1 protein expression compared to hypoxia alone and this was attenuated by PROG treatment in bEnd.3 cells (Fig. 2). ICAM-1, a
transmembrane immunoglobulin protein that is predominantly
expressed on endothelial cells, is of major importance in leukocyte
recruitment. Upregulation of ICAM-1 contributes to stable binding
of leukocytes and facilitates their transmigration by rearranging

the endothelial cytoskeleton and loosening the endothelial cell
tight junctions.
Chemokines, as primarily secreted small proteins, have been
known to modulate multiple aspects of the inﬂammatory response
and host defense. Several groups have reported the induction of
MIP-1a in various stroke animal models and in stroke patients
(Zaremba et al., 2006). As an active mediator in cerebral
post-ischemic inﬂammation, MIP-1a upregulation can cause
monocyte/macrophage and microglial accumulation both in vitro
(Skuljec et al., 2011) and in vivo (Wang et al., 2008). The increased
mRNA expression of MIP-1a was observed at 6–48 h following permanent MCAO in rats (Kim et al., 1995) and at 6 h after reperfusion
following transient MCAO in mice (Nishi et al., 2005). In the present study, we found that tPA enhances MIP-1a expression in
microvessels and neurons in vivo after stroke as well as in brain
endothelial cells in vitro under hypoxia. We suggest that MIP-1a
induction in cerebral endothelial cells and neurons triggers
microglia/macrophage cell recruitment.
4.3. M1 polarization
Microglia/macrophage polarization is ﬂexible and is involved in
the generation of different cell types with distinct effector functions (Murray and Wynn, 2011). The phenotype and functional
activities of microglia/macrophages are regulated by many cytokines and microbial products which allow the development of M1 or
M2 subtypes that then play a role in mediating different functional

states. These M1- and M2-type cells express different levels of cell
surface markers and secrete mediators such as adhesion molecules,
scavenger receptors, chemokines, and cytokines. In the present
study, we describe tPA-induced M1 microglia/macrophage polarization and the inhibitory effects of PROG on tPA-induced alterations after stroke (Fig. 3). These ﬁndings are supported by data
obtained from BV2 microglia cells after tPA treatment under
hypoxic injury (Fig. 4). To us, it seems increasingly apparent that
tPA heightens the M1 microglia/macrophage reaction after stroke
or hypoxic injury and that PROG counteracts this effect.
M1 polarization is linked to inﬂammation and tissue damage,
whereas the M2 reaction can have an anti-inﬂammatory role in
wound repair by coordinating inﬂammation and angiogenesis. It
has been suggested that microglial interaction with human
immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) proteins or TLR-3/4 ligands results
in the M1-like phenotype (Bruce-Keller et al., 2001; Suh et al.,
2009). Increased M1 polarization is consistent with increased
TNF-a in plasma and brain specimens in HIV-associated dementia
and Alzheimer’s disease, and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of these diseases (Minagar et al., 2002). These studies
suggest that M1 polarization is involved in the initiation and perpetuation of neuroinﬂammation in other diseases as well as stroke,

whereas M2 polarization is more related to the resolution of neuroinﬂammation through engulfment and degradation of invading
pathogens, peptides and apoptotic cells. The M2-related cytokine
IL-10 increases macrophage phagocytic ability, and heightened
activity of M2 macrophages results in necrotic cellular debris scavenging and tissue remodeling (Ruffell et al., 2009). Recently, it has
been shown that the phenotype of recruited microglia after stroke
(Hu et al., 2012) and traumatic brain injury (Wang et al., 2013)
gradually changes from M2 to M1. In our experiment, the M1 phenotype was observed after tPA treatment with stroke and the
expression of this phenotype was prevented by PROG treatment.
Our data suggest that early M1 phenotype expression is related
to the extent of delayed tPA-induced brain injury after stroke.
Future analysis of the precise mechanism of tPA or PROG action
in stroke may reveal and differentiate mechanisms underlying
M1 and M2 polarization.
4.4. MMP-3
MMP-3 plays a critical role in intracerebral hemorrhage
induced by tPA treatment after ischemic stroke. Suzuki et al.
(2007) demonstrated that MMP-3 is more important than

MMP-9 in increasing intracerebral hemorrhage resulting from tPA
treatment of ischemic stroke in MMP-3 KO mice. We now think
that MMP-3 might be involved in BBB disruption and contribute
to further intracerebral hemorrhage. Several studies have shown
that the production of MMP-3 is increased by the proinﬂammatory
cytokines IL-1b, TNF-a, IFN-c, and IL-17A, as well as by serum
amyloid A, and down-regulated by IL-4 and IL-13 (Manicone and
McGuire, 2008). These studies support our ﬁnding that
tPA-induced inﬂammation increases MMP-3 expression after
stroke. Our results also demonstrate that delayed tPA treatment
after stroke causes MMP-3 induction in microglia and microvessels, as conﬁrmed with in vitro experiments using BV2 microglia
under ischemic stress.
5. Conclusion
It is well known that microglia/macrophage-related neuroinﬂammation can lead to secondary brain injury after stroke.
Further, the ampliﬁcation of inﬂammation and immune reactions
continues beyond the initial hours after stroke onset and this
response provides a window of opportunity for blocking the secondary events associated with increased infarction. Classical
anti-inﬂammatory agents, steroids and nonsteroidal drugs have
been tested against this type of neuroinﬂammation but have not
yet found a major role in the treatment of the cytotoxic cascade
following stroke (Nimmo and Vink, 2009). Recently, several
pluripotent agents such as the microglia inhibitor minocycline, statins, and the T-cell blocker natalizumab, have shown positive

effects in preclinical (Liesz et al., 2011) and in retrospective analyses of clinical trials in patients with acute ischemic stroke (Kohler
et al., 2013; Endres, 2005). These results support the importance of
modulating the immune reaction after stroke or stroke with tPA
treatment if stroke outcomes are to be improved, and suggest a
strategy for managing acute ischemic stroke patients with novel
combination therapies to enhance the effects of tPA while reducing
some of its proinﬂammatory side effects.
However, one of the unintended effects of combination therapies is to block the ability of macrophages and microglia to remove
cellular debris, a notion supported by observations that selective
depletion of proliferative microglia exacerbates brain injuries
and, conversely, that injections of exogenous microglia into the
brain ameliorate CNS injuries (Imai et al., 2007). Despite its known
proinﬂammatory properties, tPA was nevertheless approved for
clinical use (Siao and Tsirka, 2002). Since it can be proinﬂammatory, combining it with an agent to prevent tPA-induced M1 activation may eventually beneﬁt the treatment of stroke victims.
tPA has a direct effect on microglia/macrophage polarization
and these effects can modulate the interaction between brain
endothelial cells and microglia after stroke. Treatment with tPA
started at 4.5 h after stroke in rats induced the sustained or
increased M1 microglia phenotype without altering M2, and
increased chemokine MIP-1a activity in cerebral blood vessels
and neurons. The cytotoxic changes induced by tPA were prevented by post-stroke treatment with PROG. In bEnd.3 cells, tPA
treatment caused an increase of ICAM-1 expression leading to
brain endothelial cell activation and MIP-1a gene expression.

These inﬂammatory/destructive reactions were blocked by PROG
treatment. We think that the beneﬁcial effects of combining tPA
with PROG could have potential clinical implications in the development of better neuroprotective therapies for stroke.
