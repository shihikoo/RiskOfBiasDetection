caspase-3, malondialdehyde (MDA) and Bcl-2-associated X
protein (Bax), increased the activities of catalase and B cell
lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and improved the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax
compared with the control (p < 0.05). This study indicates
that HLP and LMWH reduced infarct volume and improved
neurobehavioral outcomes induced by transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). In addition, HLP had a
beneﬁcial eﬀect on the regulation of the thrombin receptor
and key apoptosis regulators in the mouse brain. These
results suggest that HLP may be a potential alternative
therapy for arterial occlusion-induced cerebral ischemia.

Abstract—Hirulog-like peptide (HLP) and low-molecularweight heparin (LMWH) are thrombin inhibitor peptides.
Our previous study demonstrated that HLP could reduce
vascular neointimal formation or restenosis in animals
undergoing balloon catheter injury in the carotid artery.
However, the function of HLP during ischemic stroke is
largely unknown. The present study investigated the eﬀect
of HLP on brain injury, which was induced by suture of
middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. Mice were divided
into four groups, which included a sham group and three
treatment groups. Ischemia was induced by transient suture
insertion into the middle cerebral artery for 90 min, and
mice were either treated with saline, HLP or LMWH. Infarct
volume, neurologic deﬁcits and apoptotic factors were
measured following 1–14 days of ischemia. We demonstrated that HLP intravenous injection alleviated brain infarct
volume and improved neurologic outcomes (p < 0.05). HLP
decreased levels of protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1),

INTRODUCTION
Thrombin, a multifunctional serine protease generated
by the activation of the coagulation cascade, plays a
critical role in thrombogenesis, inﬂammation and
atherosclerosis. These eﬀects are reached mainly
through protease-activated receptors (PARs). PARs
are G protein-coupled proteases that are activated by
proteolytic cleavage and generation of a tethered
ligand (Schmidlin and Bunnett, 2001). Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), a major thrombin receptor,
is widely distributed throughout the brain, especially in
the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. PAR-1 is upregulated after anoxia in hippocampal slice cultures
(Striggow et al., 2001). PAR-1 plays a detrimental role
during neurite retraction (Turgeon et al., 1998), cell
death in hippocampal cultures and motor neurons
(Donovan et al., 1997; Turgeon et al., 1999), and potentiation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor responses
(Gingrich et al., 2000). In addition, it was demonstrated
that the infarct volume was attenuated about 3-fold in
PAR-1-deﬁcient mice compared with wild-type mice
(Junge et al., 2003).
Thrombin plays a major role in ischemic or
hemorrhagic injury (Chen et al., 2012). Growing evidence
suggests that inhibition of thrombin activity alleviates
neuronal damage in brain diseases (Pompili et al.,
2011). Inhibiting thrombin activation has been shown to
reduce brain damage, ameliorate neurologic deﬁcits and
improve animal survival after permanent and transient
focal ischemia in rodents (Cuomo et al., 2007). Parenchymal injection of hirudin, aspeciﬁc thrombin inhibitor, has

been shown to attenuate ischemic brain damage and
improve neurological outcomes after middle cerebral
artery occlusion (Karabiyikoglu et al., 2004).
Increases in oxidative stress and overproduction of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) play important roles in
the pathophysiology of ischemic brain injury (Collier
et al., 2008). Oxidative stress relates to an imbalance
between ROS and the antioxidant system, including
vitamin E, vitamin C, b-carotene and scavenger
enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and
catalase (Harris and Amor, 2011; Pamplona and
Costantini, 2011; Watson et al., 2012). Oxidative stress
causes further damage and may ultimately result in the
initiation of pathways that lead to necrotic and apoptotic
cell death. Although the mechanism of apoptosis during
ischemia has not been well identiﬁed, recent studies
suggest that caspases and B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)
family proteins contribute to cell apoptosis (FlorianKujawski et al., 2004; Shuayto et al., 2006). Caspases,
such as caspase-3, -6, and -9, are the central molecules involved in the initiation and execution of apoptosis (Shi, 2004). Like caspases, Bcl-2 family proteins are
necessary components and essential regulators of
apoptotic cell death. These proteins can be grouped
into ‘Bcl-2 like survival factors’ (anti-apoptotic), such
as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (Gibson et al., 1996; Song et al.,
1999; Lalle et al., 2002), and ‘Bcl-2 like death factors’
(pro-apoptotic), which include Bcl-2-associated X protein
(Bax) and Bcl-2 antagonist/killer 1 (Bak1). The balance
between the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the proapoptotic protein Bax plays a vital role in determining
the fate of cells (Wattanapitayakul and Bauer, 2001).
Hirulog-like peptide (HLP), a relatively new thrombin
inhibitor peptide, was developed by Dr. Shen’s group
(Xue et al., 2001). The structure, pharmacokinetics,
eﬃcacy and safety of HLP were described in our previous
studies (Xue et al., 2001; Tang et al., 2007, 2010). HLP
inhibits both the binding of thrombin and the thrombin
receptor, which potentially provides more eﬃcient inhibition of thrombin receptor-dependent cellular activities.
HLP has a short half-life (25–31 min) compared with
low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (112 min), hirudin
(72 min) or hirulog-1 (36 min) (Tang et al., 2007), which
may explain its relatively less prolongation of bleeding
time or activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) compared with heparin or hirulog-1 in animal models (Xue
et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2003; Tang et al., 2010). In previous studies, we demonstrated that HLP prevented balloon catheter dilation-induced neointimal formation in
right carotid artery of rats (Xue et al., 2001) and femoral
arteries of minipigs (Tang et al., 2010), and carotid artery
restenosis in atherosclerotic rabbits (Chen et al., 2003).
These eﬀects were associated with its inhibition on
injury-induced increases in growth factors, coagulation
activators and inﬂammatory mediators in the vascular
wall. Because of the protective eﬀect of HLP on vascular
injury and its relative safety, we tested the hypothesis that
HLP may be neuroprotective against transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in mice. We also investigated the mechanism for potential neuroprotective eﬀect
of HLP.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals and experimental groups
All procedures were performed in accordance with the
Care and Use Guide of Laboratory Animals of
the National Institutes of Health with the approval of
the Scientiﬁc Investigation Board of the Shanghai Jiao
Tong University, School of Medicine (SYXK-20030026). A total of 84 adult male ICR mice weighting
between 28 and 32 g were used. Mice were allowed
free access to food and tap water and were housed in
a temperature-controlled room with a 12-h light–dark
cycle.
Mice were divided into four groups: sham group
(n = 7), HLP group (n = 7), LMWH group (n = 7) and
control group (n = 7). HLP was provided by Dr. Shen’s
lab, and LMWH was obtained from Laboratoire Glaxo
Smith Kline (Marly-le-Roi, France). HLP (4 mg/kg),
LMWH (3 mg/kg), or control (0.9% (w/v) saline) was
intravenously injected at 90 min after tMCAO via the
carotid vein. The dose of HLP was 4-mg/kg, which was
optimized for reducing infarct size after tMCAO in pilot
experiments.
tMCAO
Animals were anesthetized with ketamine (100-mg/kg).
During the surgical procedure, rectal temperature was
sustained at (37 ± 0.5 °C) with a heating pad (RWD
Life Science, Shenzhen, China). Regional cerebral
blood ﬂow was monitored using laser Doppler ﬂowmetry
(Moor Instruments, Devon, England). Under the
operating microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), the 60 suture (Dermalon, 1741-11, Covidien, OH, USA)
coated with silicone was introduced into the left external
carotid artery (ECA) lumen and gently advanced into the
internal carotid (ICA) until it blocked the bifurcating
origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). After 90 min
of tMCAO, blood ﬂow was restored through removing
the suture. Cerebral blood ﬂow was reduced by at least
80% during tMCAO (Junge et al., 2003). Sham-operated
group mice underwent the same surgical procedure without insertion of the suture.
Behavioral testing
All mice underwent behavioral tests before tMCAO and at
1, 3, 7 and 14 days after tMCAO by an investigator who
was blinded to the experimental groups. The series of
tests were as follows:
Rotarod test. An accelerating rotarod was used to
measure mouse motor function (Chen et al., 2000). The
higher score, the better recovery is the motor function.
The mice were set on the rotarod cylinder and the time
animals remained on the rotarod was measured. The
velocity was gradually increased from 4 to 40 rpm within
5 min. The trial was terminated when the mouse fell from
the rungs or gripped the device and spun around for two
consecutive revolutions without attempting to walk on
the rungs. Animals were tested for three trials per day
before tMCAO. The mean duration in seconds on the

570

device was recorded with three rotarod measurements
1 day before surgery. Motor test data are expressed as
a percentage of the mean duration (three trials) on the
rotarod compared with the internal baseline values
(before surgery).
Modiﬁed neurological severity score (NSS). NSS was
examined at 1, 3 and 14 days after tMCAO. A set of the
NSS tests were used to separately grade various
aspects of neurologic function (Shohami et al., 1995).
NSS was a composite of the motor (muscle status, abnormal movement), sensory (visual, tactile and proprioceptive) and reﬂex tests (Li et al., 2000). NSS was graded
on a scale of 0–14 (normal score 0; maximal deﬁcit score
14). One point was awarded for the inability to perform the
test or for the lack of a tested reﬂex; thus, the higher the
score, the more severe the injury.
Assessment of brain infarct volume
Cerebral infarct volume was evaluated according to
applied methods (Hua et al., 2009). Mice were euthanized
with an intraperitoneal overdose of ketamine (200 mg/kg)
and then transcardially perfused with saline, followed by
4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were removed
and post-ﬁxed in 4% (w/v) PFA for 24 h, and then stored
at 4 °C for 17 h in 30% (w/v) sucrose solution. Brains were
coronally sectioned into 20-lm-thick slices at an interval of
2 mm. Sections were used for immunohistochemistry and
Cresyl Violet staining. The border between the infarct and
healthy tissue was outlined using image analysis software
(Image J, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD,
USA) to measure the lesion. Infarct volume was calculated
by multiplying the sum of the injured surface area by the
thickness of the sections (Thiyagarajan et al., 2008).
Immunohistochemistry
Brain sections ﬁxed in 4% (w/v) PFA were rinsed with
phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS) three times, blocked
with 5% (w/v) bovine serum, and then incubated
overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-PAR-1 antibody (1:100
dilution; Abbiotec, San Diego, CA, USA). Sections were
washed three times with PBS and incubated with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
(1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA, USA) at room temperature for 1 h. Slides were ﬁrst
stained using the Diaminobenzidine (DAB) kit (Maixin,
Fuzhou, China) according to the manufacturer
instructions and then counterstained with Harris
hematoxylin. All ﬁelds were photographed using a Nikon
E600 light microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at 400
magniﬁcation (Ellison et al., 1998).
Measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA)
Mice were anesthetized and blood was collected from the
heart. The blood was centrifuged at 3000 rpm to remove
the serum and MDA levels were measured using the
MDA assay kit from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering
Institute (Nanjing, China).

Western blot analysis
Brain protein extracts were homogenized in lysis buﬀer
and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C to remove
dissolved fragments. Protein concentration was
estimated using the Bradford assay. Protein (10 lg) was
electrophoresed on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride membranes (Millipore, Rockland, MA, USA).
The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk
in Tris-buﬀered saline [20 mmol/l Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) and
137 mmol/l NaCl] containing Tween-20 (TBST) for 2 h.
The membranes were then incubated overnight with
rabbit anti PAR-1 antibody (1:1000 dilution; Abbiotec),
rabbit anti CAT antibody (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling
Technology or CST, Danvers, MA, USA), rabbit anti
caspase-3 antibody (1:1000 dilution; CST), rabbit anti
Bax antibody (1:1000 dilution; CST), and rabbit anti Bcl2 antibody (1:1000 dilution; CST). Membranes were
then incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody
(1:3000, GE Healthcare, Bucks, UK). Immunoblots were
incubated with Western Lightning plus-ECL (Perkin
Elmer, Boston, MA, USA) and exposed to X-ray ﬁlm for
target protein detection. Membranes were incubated
with b-actin as a loading control. The intensity of bands
was analyzed using Image J software (Nicole et al.,
2005).
Statistical analysis
Data are given as mean ± SEM. p < 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant. Statistical analysis
was performed by a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test for multiple
comparison. All statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS17.0 software.

RESULTS
The mortality after tMCAO was 14%. While mice treated
with HLP and LMWH at tMCAO at diﬀerent time points
remained alive. The result indicated that the survival
rate in mice treated with HLP and LMWH was lower
than that in tMCAO mice.
Eﬀect of HLP on infarct volume, rotarod test and NSS
Infarct volume decreased in HLP-treated mice compared
to the control group at 1 day (20 ± 2.2 mm3 vs.
29 ± 3.2 mm3, p < 0.05) and at 3 days after tMCAO
(34 ± 3.2 mm3 vs. 47 ± 3.2 mm3, p < 0.05). In
addition, LMWH caused a reduction in lesion volume
compared to controls at 3 days after tMCAO
(36 ± 2.1 mm3
vs.
47 ± 3.2 mm3,
respectively,
p < 0.05). No signiﬁcant reduction in infarct volume was
observed between the LMWH and the control group
(22 ± 2.9 mm3 vs. 29 ± 3.2 mm3, p > 0.05) at 1 day
after tMCAO. There was no signiﬁcant change in infarct
volume among the three groups at 14 days after tMCAO
(data not shown)
There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in rotarod and
NSS results among the three groups at day 1 after
tMCAO. Mice treated with HLP had lengthened rotarod

R.-Y. Wang et al. / Neuroscience 277 (2014) 568–576

test times and decreased NSS scores compared to the
control group at 3 days after tMCAO (p < 0.05). At
14 days after ischemia, HLP-treated mice still had
longer rotarod times and lower NSS scores (p < 0.05)
compared to the control mice (Fig. 1). Although LMWH
improved rotarod test times and decreased NSS scores,
there was no diﬀerence compared to the control group
at 3 and 14 days after tMCAO.
Treatment eﬀect of HLP on PAR-1
We analyzed the content of PAR-1 to verify the
hypothesis that PAR-1 could contribute to neuron
degeneration at the acute phase after tMCAO. Western
blotting results demonstrated that HLP-treated mice had
lower PAR-1 content compared to the control mice at 3
and 14 days after tMCAO (Fig. 2A). The expression of
PAR-1 in the sham group was 0.30 ± 0.04 fold,
0.31 ± 0.04 fold, 0.27 ± 0.04 fold at 1, 3 and 14 days,
respectively. PAR-1 expression in HLP-treated
mice was lower compared to the control at 3 days
(1.47 ± 0.06 vs. 2.0 ± 0.3 fold, p < 0.05) and at
14 days after tMCAO (0.68 ± 0.03 vs. 0.86 ± 0.05 fold,
p < 0.05, Fig. 2B). PAR-1 was also identiﬁed by
histological staining at diﬀerent time points. There was

571

no evidence in PAR-1 staining in the sham group.
However, PAR-1 was expressed in the infarct area.
There was no diﬀerence among the three groups 1 day
after tMCAO. HLP-treated mice showed a decrease in
PAR-1 reactivity compared to the control after 3 and
14 days of tMCAO (Fig. 2D).
Eﬀect of HLP on caspase-3, catalase and MDA
Caspase-3 and catalase expression in the sham group
was 0.32 ± 0.04 fold and 2.74 ± 0.21 fold at 1 day;
0.34 ± 0.05 fold and 2.76 ± 0.18 fold at 3 days; and
0.32 ± 0.04 fold and 2.84 ± 0.13 at 14 days. MDA
content in the sham group was 67.18 ± 4.05 nmol/mg,
65.68 ± 3.81 nmol/mg, 63.68 ± 4.35 nmol/mg at 1, 3
and 14 days, respectively. The expression of caspase-3
at 3 days (1.56 ± 0.08 fold, p < 0.05) and 14 days
(0.32 ± 0.04 fold, p < 0.05) in HLP-treated mice was
lower than in the control mice at 3 days
(2.32 ± 0.25 fold) and at 14 days (0.45 ± 0.06 fold). No
signiﬁcant diﬀerence in caspase-3 was observed
between the control and LMWH group at all time points
(Fig. 3A). tMCAO caused a reduction of catalase. HLP
and LMWH-treated mice had higher catalase expression
compared with control mice at 1 and 14 days after

tMCAO (p < 0.05). It was noted that catalase expression
in HLP-treated mice approximately doubled that in the
control mice at 3 days after tMCAO (2.30 ± 0.11 vs.
1.33 ± 0.15 fold, respectively, p < 0.05). Catalase
expression in HLP-treated mice was higher than in
LMWH-treated mice at 3 and 14 days after tMCAO
(p < 0.05). Additionally, LMWH considerably enhanced
catalase levels compared to the control at 1 and 3 days
after tMCAO. HLP was superior to LMWH with respect
to catalase levels at 3 days. HLP-treated mice had
lower MDA expression compared to the control mice at
3 and 14 days after tMCAO (150 ± 13 nmol/mg vs.
312 ± 21 nmol/mg at 3 days and 88 ± 4.2 nmol/mg vs.
123 ± 18 nmol/mg at 14 days, respectively, p < 0.05).

However, no signiﬁcant diﬀerence among the three
groups was observed at 1 day after tMCAO. We
found that LMWH-treated mice had lower MDA
expression than that of control mice at 3 days after
tMCAO (232 ± 13.8 nmol/mg vs 312 ± 20.8 nmol/mg,
respectively, p < 0.05). In addition, HLP signiﬁcantly
reduced MDA content compared with LMWH at 3 days
(p < 0.05, Fig. 3).
Treatment eﬀect of HLP on Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-2/Bax
ratio
Bax and Bcl-2 expression and Bcl-2/Bax ratio were
examined by western blotting after tMCAO. Bax and

group and LMWH group vs. control group. #p < 0.05, HLP group vs. LMWH group.

Bcl-2 expression in the sham group was 0.44 ± 0.04 fold
and 2.03 ± 0.17 fold, respectively at 1 day; 0.48 ±
0.04 fold and 1.88 ± 0.15 fold, respectively at 3 days;
and 0.44 ± 0.06 fold and 1.76 ± 0.11, respectively at
14 days. HLP-treated mice had greater Bcl-2
abundance, less Bax content and a higher ratio of Bcl-2/
Bax at each time point compared with control mice after
tMCAO (p < 0.05). However, increased Bcl-2 and
decreased Bax expression in LMWH-treated mice was
only observed after 3 days of tMCAO compared to the
control mice. No signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the Bcl-2/Bax
ratio was observed in LMWH-treated mice compared to
the control mice at 1 and 3 days after tMCAO. In

addition, the HLP group had signiﬁcantly enhanced Bcl2 and Bcl-2/Bax, and decreased Bax levels compared to
the LMWH group at 3 days after tMCAO (p < 0.05,
Fig. 4).

DISCUSSION
We demonstrated for the ﬁrst time the eﬀect of HLP on
brain damage during ischemic stroke, and performed
our experiments in parallel with LMWH treatment. HLP
and LMWH reduced brain infarct volume at 3 days after
ischemic insult, HLP also reduced infarct volume in
tMCAO mice at 1 day after tMCAO, suggesting that HLP

574

R.-Y. Wang et al. / Neuroscience 277 (2014) 568–576

exerted its eﬀect by reducing ischemic brain injury during
the acute phase of tMCAO, which was similar to the
function of LMWH although the pharmacological
mechanism is diﬀerent.
Interestingly, our data showed that HLP did not reduce
infarct volume 14 days after ischemic stroke; however,
neurobehavioral outcomes were improved at this time
point. Also, PAR-1 receptor, caspase-3, MDA and BAX
were reduced while catalase activity and Bcl-2
expression were increased. The result contradicted that
infarct volume reduction was related to a signiﬁcant
improvement in neurologic deﬁcits (Cuomo et al., 2007).
Taken possible mechanisms into consideration, HLP
existed the eﬀect of antioxidative stress and inhibited cell
apoptosis more potently when compared to LMWH’s
eﬀects. This could explain better neurobehavioral outcomes in the HLP-treated group. Neurological functional
recovery was related to the increase of antioxidant
enzymes and apoptosis-related proteins (Kam et al.,
2011).
HLP is a small peptide with molecular weight 3200 Da
(Tang et al., 2007) and LMWH is of similar size with
molecular weight 4000–6000 Da (Pineo and Hull, 1998).
Both molecules could cross the blood–brain barrier especially when the blood–brain barrier was broken during
ischemic brain injury. HLP is a thrombin receptor-speciﬁc
thrombin inhibitor while LMWH is a non-speciﬁc thrombin
inhibitor. Therefore, HLP had stronger action to inhibit the
function of thrombin. In the present study, we also demonstrated that HLP could inhibit PAR-1 activation in the
ischemic mouse brain. Since PAR-1 activation was associated with brain damage in ischemic models (Festoﬀ
et al., 2000; Junge et al., 2003; Cuomo et al., 2007;
Zhang et al., 2008), our result suggested that HLP
reduced ischemic brain injury was via inhibition of PAR1. Bivalirudin (Hirulog) showed better eﬀect of inhibiting
the human platelet aggregation compared to thrombin in
preventing carotid artery occlusion in guinea pigs (Leger
et al., 2006). It was noted that preconditioning with low
concentrations of thrombin and agonists of PAR-1 could
protect against neuronal death caused by 2 h of oxygen
glucose deprivation (Striggow et al., 2000; Hua et al.,
2003; Choi et al., 2005; Henrich-Noack et al., 2006; Hu
et al., 2010), suggesting that down-regulation of
PAR-1 activation was an important step during ischemic
condition.
Oxidative stress was implicated in the process of brain
injury due to the generation of free radicals. Cerebral cells
were particularly prone to oxidant damage owing to their
high lipid content (Nita et al., 2001). Oxidative stress
induced necrosis and apoptosis through the activation of
the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (Vaseva
et al., 2012) and the activation of p38 signaling and caspase-3 (Zhang et al., 2004). Both HLP and LMWH could
reduce the MDA level in blood and increased catalase
expression in the brain, suggesting an antioxidant eﬀect
of HLP and LMWH. We demonstrated for the ﬁrst time
an antioxidative eﬀect of HLP in the ischemic brain tissue.
Apoptosis plays a critical role in ischemic brain
damage. The present study indicated that HLP, but not
LMWH, attenuated caspase-3 activation and increased

Bcl-2 content in the mouse brain after tMCAO. Although
Bcl-2 overexpression did not alter overall Bax
expression, this could inhibit the cytosolic accumulation
of cytochrome c and caspase-3 activation (Zhao et al.,
2003). HLP also balanced the Bcl-2/Bax ratio during
tMCAO. The Bcl-2/Bax ratio was considered a determining factor of cell fate in response to apoptotic stimuli
because Bcl-2 protein inhibited apoptosis through binding
to Bax, Bcl-xs, and Bad proteins (Petros et al., 2004). The
impact of HLP on regulators of apoptosis contributed to its
cerebral protective eﬀect in the mouse brain following
tMCAO.
In our previous studies, HLP appeared to have fewer
side eﬀects compared with heparin administration in
rats, rabbits and minipigs. HLP did not lengthen
bleeding time or APTT in these models, suggesting that
HLP could have a safety proﬁle in terms of hemorrhage
during treatment of stroke. However, the drug safety
and the role of HLP in ischemic brain injury should be
further explored before clinical application.

CONCLUSION
HLP and LMWH reduced infarct volume and improved
neurologic deﬁcits induced by tMCAO. HLP treatment
showed better eﬀects on the regulation of thrombin
receptors and key apoptosis regulators compared to
LMWH. These ﬁndings suggested that HLP provided a
potential alternative therapy for the treatment of
ischemic stroke.
