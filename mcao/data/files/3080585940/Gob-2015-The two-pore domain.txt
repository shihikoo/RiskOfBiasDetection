Abstract Potassium channels can fulfill both beneficial and
detrimental roles in neuronal damage during ischemic stroke.
Earlier studies have characterized a neuroprotective role of the
two-pore domain potassium channels KCNK2 (TREK1) and
KCNK3 (TASK1). Protective neuronal hyperpolarization and
prevention of intracellular Ca2+ overload and glutamate
excitotoxicity were suggested to be the underlying mechanisms. We here identify an unexpected role for the related
KCNK5 channel in a mouse model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). KCNK5 is strongly upregulated on neurons upon cerebral ischemia, where it is most
likely involved in the induction of neuronal apoptosis.
Hypoxic conditions elevated neuronal expression levels of

KCNK5 in acute brain slices and primary isolated neuronal
cell cultures. In agreement, KCNK5 knockout mice had significantly reduced infarct volumes and improved neurologic
function 24 h after 60 min of tMCAO and this protective effect
was preserved at later stages of infarct development. KCNK5
deficiency resulted in a significantly reduced number of apoptotic neurons, a downregulation of pro-apoptotic and upregulation of anti-apoptotic factors. Results of adoptive transfer
experiments of wild-type and Kcnk5−/− immune cells into
Rag1−/− mice prior to tMCAO exclude a major role of
KCNK5 in poststroke inflammatory reactions. In summary,
KCNK5 expression is induced on neurons under ischemic
conditions where it most likely exerts pro-apoptotic effects.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and longterm disability in the world [19]. To date, neuroprotective
strategies have been shown to fail in clinical trials, elucidating
the need for a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with neuronal cell death in cerebral ischemia [25, 62]. Important mechanistic insights into the
complex pathophysiology of the ischemic cascade have identified major harmful events initiating and perpetuating neuronal death. Hypoxia and glucose deprivation lead to a lack of
energy necessary to maintain adenosine triphosphate (ATP)driven ion pumps and ionic balance. Furthermore, a massive
release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate results in
neuronal depolarization, intracellular calcium overload and
excitotoxic death [46]. Neurons display a broad array of
homeostatic protective mechanisms counterbalancing the hyperexcitability induced by hypoxic and ischemic periods.
Hyperpolarizing potassium channels are especially suited to
control neuronal excitability as has been demonstrated for
KATP [5], Ca2+-activated big potassium (BK) channels [58],
and voltage-gated potassium channels [50].
Furthermore, it is now well established that innate and
adaptive immunity contributes significantly to central nervous
system (CNS) inflammation, infarct size, and functional damage after stroke. Potassium channels have been shown to
regulate migration and effector functions of immune cells
[18]. In accordance, pharmacological blockade of the
calcium-activated potassium channel KCa3.1, which is involved in microglial, macrophage, and T cell function, had
beneficial effects in a rat model of ischemic stroke [20],

demonstrating the therapeutic potential of targeting inflammation in cerebral ischemia.
Two-pore domain potassium channels (K2P channels) play
an important role in setting the resting membrane potential,
regulating neuronal excitability and integrating extracellular
signals under pathophysiological conditions [34]. KCNK5
(TWIK-related acid-sensitive potassium channel 2, TASK-2)
is a member of the K2P channel family displaying unique
biophysical properties enabling regulation of channel activity
by pathophysiological hallmarks of stroke development [21].
KCNK5 is sensitive to changes in extracellular pH values and
is inhibited by extracellular acidification (10 % activity at pH
6.5 [57]). Furthermore, an activation of KCNK5 upon hypoxia
has been described that might be due to a direct activation of
KCNK5 by reactive oxygen species [30]. In peripheral organs,
KCNK5 channels regulate HCO3- reabsorption in kidney
proximal tubules and are involved in cell volume regulation
[3, 15, 21]. On human T lymphocytes, KCNK5 regulates T
cell effector functions and its expression levels on pathogenic
T cells correlate with disease activity in autoimmune diseases,
such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis [9, 10].
Conflicting reports exist concerning the expression of
KCNK5 within the CNS. While some found no expression
of KCNK5 in the adult brain [1, 63], others describe KCNK5
channels in brainstem nuclei [30], hippocampus, and cerebellum [23, 29]. Furthermore, KCNK5 can be upregulated on
neurons and astrocytes under pathophysiological conditions,
as has been found in a rat model of epilepsy [35].
In summary, the regulatory mechanisms and expression
patterns suggest an as yet unidentified involvement of
KCNK5 in cerebral ischemia. Therefore, we here investigated
the pathophysiological role of KCNK5 in a mouse model of
acute ischemic stroke.

Material and methods
Stroke model
All animal experiments were approved by the local state
authorities (Regierung von Unterfranken) and conducted in
agreement with the German Animal Welfare Act (German
Ministry of Agriculture, Health and Economic Cooperation).
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in 6- to 8-week-old male
C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice (Charles River) and Kcnk5−/−
mice [6], weighing between 20 and 25 g, using the
intraluminal filament technique [49]. Mice were anesthetized
with 2.0 % isoflurane, and core body temperature was maintained at 37 °C throughout surgery. Following a midline
cervical skin incision, the proximal common carotid artery
and the external carotid artery were ligated and a standardized
silicon rubber-coated nylon monofilament (6023910PK10,

Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol (2015) 467:973–987

Doccol Corp.) was inserted and advanced via the right internal
carotid artery to occlude the origin of the right middle cerebral
artery. The intraluminal suture was left in situ for 60 min.
After that, mice were re-anesthetized and the occluding monofilament was withdrawn to allow reperfusion. Operation time
per animal did not exceed 10 min. For reconstitution of Rag1−/
−
mice with CD4+ T cells, immune cells were isolated from
spleen and lymph node cell suspensions of Kcnk5−/− and
C57BL/6 WT mice in RPMI medium containing 1 % Lglutamine, 1 % FCS, and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin. After
removal of red blood cells with ammonium chloride, T cells
were enriched using the CD4+ T Cell Isolation Kit II (Miltenyi
Biotec), resuspended to 7.5 × 10 5 cells per 100 μl in
phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently injected intravenously into Rag1−/− mice. T cell-reconstituted Rag1−/− mice
were subjected to tMCAO 24 h after injection [39].
Stroke study population and quality control
All stroke experiments were conducted according to the recommendations for research in experimental stroke studies [26]
and the current Animal Research Reporting of In Vivo
Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines (http://www.nc3rs.org/
ARRIVE). Animals were randomly assigned to the operators
by independent persons not involved in data acquisition and
analysis. Surgeries and evaluation of all readout parameters
were performed while being blinded to the experimental
groups.
The following conditions excluded mice from end-point
analyses (exclusion criteria): 1, death within 24 h after MCAO
(except for survival studies); 2, subarachnoid hemorrhage or
bleeding into the brain parenchyma (as macroscopically
assessed during brain sampling or by magnetic resonance
imaging [MRI]); 3, Bederson score = 0 (24 h after MCAO);
and 4, operation time >10 min. In total, 159 mice (80 C57BL/
6 WT, 52 Kcnk5−/−, 27 Rag1−/−) were used in this study. Of the
116 mice subjected to tMCAO, 11 mice (9.5 %) met at least
one exclusion criterion after randomization and, therefore,
were withdrawn from the study. The number of excluded
animals (dropout rate) was evenly distributed between the
groups (p>0.05).

onto string by one or both forepaws plus one or both hindpaws;
4, hangs onto string by forepaws and hindpaws plus tail
wrapped around string; and 5, escape (to the supports).
Determination of stroke size
Mice were sacrificed 24 h after tMCAO, respectively. Brains
were quickly removed and cut into 2-mm-thick coronal sections using a mouse brain slice matrix (Harvard Apparatus).
The slices were stained with 2 % triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC, Sigma-Aldrich) to visualize the infarctions [7].
Planimetric measurements (ImageJ software, National
Institutes of Health) were used to calculate lesion volumes,
which were corrected for brain edema according to the following equation: Vindirect (mm3)=Vinfarct ×(1−(Vih −Vch)/Vch.
The term (Vih −Vch) represents the difference in volumes between the ischemic hemisphere (ih) and the control hemisphere (ch), and (Vih −Vch)/Vch expresses the difference as a
percentage of the control hemisphere.
Determination of edema formation
The extent of brain edema was calculated by planimetry from
TTC-stained brain sections according to the following equation: Brain edema area (%)=[(AL+AI+AC)×100/(AC×2)]−
100, where AL represents the total area of TTC-negative
(ischemic) brain tissue, AI represents the total area of viable
tissue of the ipsilateral (ischemic) hemisphere, and AC represents the total area of the contralateral (healthy) hemisphere
[33].
Laser Doppler flowmetry
Laser Doppler flowmetry (Moore Instruments) was performed
in C57BL/6 WT and Kcnk5−/− mice at baseline (before ischemia), 10 min after inserting the occluding filament (ischemia)
and 10 min after removing the occluding filament
(reperfusion) [22]. The regional cerebral blood flow was measured in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery (6 mm
lateral and 2 mm posterior from bregma) (Fig. S1).
Magnet resonance imaging

Assessment of functional outcome
Global neurologic deficits were quantified according to the
Bederson score [8]: 0, no deficit; 1, forelimb flexion; 2, as
for 1, plus decreased resistance to lateral push; 3, unidirectional
circling; 4, longitudinal spinning; and 5, no movement. The
grip-test score was applied to monitor motor function and
coordination [51]. For this purpose, the mouse was placed
midway on a string between two supports and rated as follows:
0, mouse falls off; 1, hangs onto string by one or both forepaws; 2, as for 1, and attempts to climb onto string; 3, hangs

To analyze infarct dynamics and to scan for possible intracerebral bleeding, stroke assessment was performed by serial
MRI on a 1.5-T MRI unit (MAGNETOM SymphonyVision,
Siemens) on days 1 and 7 after tMCAO as described [43].
Assessment of the cerebral vasculature
To assess the structure of the cerebral vasculature, we examined the circle of Willis and main arteries by ink perfusion.
Mice were deeply anesthetized with CO2 and transcardially

976

perfused with 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA), followed by 3 ml
of black ink diluted in 4 % PFA (1:5v/v). Brains were carefully
removed, fixed in 4 % PFA overnight at 4 °C, and the circle of
Willis was examined under a microscope, and the development of the posterior communicating arteries (PComA) was
quantified using the PComA score [53] (Fig. S1 and
Table S1).
Blood gas analysis
A 100 μl sample of arterial blood was drawn from the left
cardiac ventricle of anesthetized mice using a heparinized
syringe. We then determined PaO2, PaCO2, and pH using an
ABL 77 automated blood gas analyzer (Radiometer)
(Table S1).
Invasive hemodynamics
For the assessment of blood pressure and heart rate, mice were
anesthetized with 2.0 % isoflurane and catheterized via the
right carotid artery with a high-fidelity 1.4 F Millarmicrotip
catheter (Millar Instruments) as described [17]. Hemodynamic
data were digitized via a MacLabsystem (AD Instruments)
connected to an Apple G4 PowerPC computer and analyzed
(Table S1).
Western blot
Cortices or basal ganglia were dissected from native brains
and homogenized in RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 1 % NP-40) containing 0.1 % sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) and 4 % proteinase inhibitor (complete protease
inhibitor cocktail, Roche). After sonication for 10 s, tissue
lysates were centrifuged at 15,000×g for 30 min at 4 °C, and
supernatants were used for bicinchoninic acid protein assay
(BCA). Total lysates were diluted in 2× SDS sample buffer
(120 mM Tris/HCl, 10 % SDS, 20 % glycerine, 20 % 2mercaptoethanol; pH 6.8) to a final concentration of 2 μg/μl
and used for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as previously described [33]. The following antibodies were used:
pAb anti-TASK2 (P1106, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:1000), mAb
anti-CREB (48H2; 9197, Cell Signaling, 1:500), mAb antiphospho-CREB (Ser133) (87G3; 9198, Cell Signaling,
1:500), pAb anti-AIF (ab1998; Abcam, 1:2000), pAb anticaspase-9 (9504, Cell Signaling, 1:500), pAb anti-occludin
(ab31721; Abcam, 1:5000), anti-β-actin (A5441; SigmaAldrich, 1:250,000), donkey anti-rabbit IgG HRPconjugated (711-035-152; Dianova, 1:10,000), and donkey
anti-mouse IgG HRP-conjugated (715-035-150; Dianova,
1:10,000). Protein bands were quantified by densitometric
analysis using ImageJ software (National Institutes of
Health) and normalized to the actin band, which served as
loading control.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
Tissue homogenization, RNA isolation, and quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed as
described [43]. For total RNA preparation, TRIzol reagent®
(Invitrogen) was used and RNA concentration was quantified
spectrophotometrically. RNA (1 μg) was reversely transcribed
with Fermentas reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocol using random hexamers. Relative gene expression levels
of TASK2 (assay ID Mm00498900_m1, Applied Biosystems)
were quantified with the fluorescent TaqMan® technology
using the StepOnePlus™ Real-time PCR System (Applied
B i o s y s t e m s ) . V I C l a b e l e d 1 8 s R N A ( Ta q M a n ®
Predeveloped Assay Reagents for gene expression, part number 4319413E, Applied Biosystems) was used as an endogenous control to normalize the amount of sample RNA. Water
controls were included to ensure specificity. Each sample was
measured in triplicate, and data points were examined for
integrity by analysis of the amplification plot. The comparative CT method was used for relative quantification of gene
expression as described [61].

Vital brain slices
Vital brain slices from 14- to 22-day-old male C57BL/6 WT
mouse brains (between −2 and −4 mm from bregma) were
prepared as described previously [48]. In brief, coronal sections were cut on a vibratome (Vibratome®, Series 1000
Classic) in an ice-chilled solution (200 mM saccharose,
20 mM PIPES, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM
MgSO4, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.35) adjusted
with NaOH. Prior to the staining procedure, slices were kept
submerged in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF, 125 mM
NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 30 mM HEPES,
2 mM MgSO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose, pH adjusted to
7.35 by bubbling with a mixture of 95 % O2 and 5 % CO2).
For ischemic conditions, slices were incubated in ACSF with
reduced glucose (5 mM) and pH 6.4 for 4 h at 37 °C in a
humidified incubator with 5 % CO2, 5 % O2, and 90 % N2.

Hippocampal neuronal cell cultures
Neuronal cell cultures were obtained from C57BL/6 WT
mouse embryos (E18) as described previously [40].
Neuronal cultures were incubated at 37 °C and 5 % CO2 and
maintained in culture for up to 5 to 7 days before performing
the experiments. Cell viability was assessed by the In Situ Cell
Death Detection Kit (TMR red, Roche) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. For ischemic conditions, O2 was
restricted per incubation at 37 °C in a humidified incubator
with 5 % CO2, 5 % O2, and 90 % N2 for 4 h.

Isolation of mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells
We prepared mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells
(MBMECs) from brains of C57BL/6 WT mice as described
[12] and used them for immunohistochemistry (see below).
Purity and cell morphology were controlled regularly by flow
cytometry and microscopy. For functional analysis, cells were
cultured under normoxic or ischemic conditions for 4 h at
37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5 % CO2 or 5 % CO2,
5 % O2, and 90 % N2, respectively.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry of native mouse brain sections, vital
brain slices, and cultured cells was performed according to
standard procedures [12, 37, 43]. For specific staining, the
following antibodies were used: pAb anti-TASK2 (P1106,
Sigma-Aldrich, 1:100) and pAb anti-NeuN (MAB377,
Merck Millipore, 1:1000). For immunofluorescence analysis,
slices were co-incubated with Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit
and Alexa-Fluor 488 anti-mouse secondary antibodies
(Abcam, 1:200). DNA was counterstained using ProLong®
Gold anti-fade reagent containing 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) (Life technologies). Negative controls
included omission of the primary or secondary antibodies and
produced no signal. TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) was performed to visualize apoptotic cells on
10-μm-thick cryo-embedded brain sections 24 h after tMCAO
using the TUNEL in situ cell death detection kit, TMR red
(Roche). Co-staining with antibodies against neuronal marker
NeuN was applied to detect apoptotic neurons. For quantification of TUNEL-positive cells, identical brain sections from
the ischemic basal ganglia were selected, and cell counting
was performed from five subsequent slices (distance 100 μm)
as described [37]. All sections were analyzed and acquired
with a Nikon Eclipse 50i microscope equipped with the DSU3 DS camera control unit and the NIS-Elements software
(Nikon) and a Zeiss Axio Scope microscope (Zeiss) equipped
with a UI-1410-C CMOS camera (UEye) and the AxioVision
software (Zeiss). Digital images were processed using Adobe
Photoshop (Adobe Systems).

Bioscience, 556925). Cells were counted on a FACS Calibur
(Becton Dickinson).
Neutrophils and macrophages were isolated from the bone
marrow of C57BL/6 mice, extracted out of tibia and femur,
and separated using MACS separation kits (Anti-Ly-6G
MicroBead Kit, CD11b MicroBeads, Miltenyi Biotech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. T cells were isolated from spleens of C57BL/6 mice using MACS separation kit
(Pan T cell isolation Kit II, Miltenyi Biotech) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Platelets were isolated as previously described [38] using two centrifugation steps with a
HEPES-Tyrode buffer (129 mM NaCl, 8.9 mM NaHCO3,
2.8 mM KCl, 0.8 mM KH2PO4, 5.6 mM glucose, 10 mM
HEPES, 0.8 mM MgCl2). Prior to RNA isolation and protein
lysate preparation in order to perform RT-PCR or Western blot
analysis, T cells were stimulated with Dynabeads® Mouse TActivator CD3/CD28 for 48 h (Life Technologies) and macrophages and neutrophils were activated with LPS overnight.
Statistics
All results are expressed as mean±standard error of the mean
(SEM) except for ordinal functional outcome scales which
were depicted as scatter plots, including median with the 25%
percentile and the 75% percentile given in brackets in the text.
The numbers of animals (n=10) necessary to detect a standardized effect size on infarct volumes ≥0.25 (Kcnk5−/− vs.
C57BL/6 WT mice) was determined via a priori sample size
calculation with the following assumptions: α=0.05, β=0.2
(power 80 %), and mean of 20 % standard deviation of the
mean (GraphPad Stat Mate 2.0, GraphPad Software). For
statistical analysis, the GraphPad Prism 5 software package
was used. Data were tested for Gaussian distribution with the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test and then analyzed by
one-way ANOVA, or in case of measuring the effects of two
factors simultaneously by two-way ANOVA with post hoc
Bonferroni adjustment for p values. Nonparametric functional
outcome scores were compared by the Kruskal-Wallis test
with post hoc Dunn’s corrections. If only two groups were
compared, unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test or the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was applied. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Cell separation, cell stimulation, and flow cytometry
For the isolation of brain-infiltrating mononuclear cells, a
Percoll (GE Healthcare) density gradient (50/30 %) was used
as described [38]. Myeloid immune cells and lymphocytes
were incubated in fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer
with monoclonal antibodies anti-CD4-PerCP (BD
Bioscience, 553052) anti-CD8a-PE (BD Bioscience,
553032). Isotype controls were the following: anti-rat IgG2b
PerCP (BD Bioscience, 550764) and anti-rat IgG2b PE (BD

Results
KCNK5 is induced under ischemic conditions in vivo
and in vitro
We first analyzed the expression of KCNK5 in the ischemic
brains from WT mice with induced focal cerebral ischemia.
Here, we chose a model of acute ischemic stroke in which

978

Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol (2015) 467:973–987

mice were subjected to tMCAO. This disease model is supposed to trigger neuropathologic as well as inflammatory
mechanisms and to influence the expression of different K2P
channels [27, 28]. KCNK5 was only weakly detectable in
whole-brain lysates of the contralesional (healthy) hemispheres from C57BL/6 WT mice. In the ipsilesional
(ischemic) hemisphere, however, KCNK5 was significantly
upregulated both on the messenger RNA (mRNA) and on the
protein level. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed a strong

increase in Kcnk5 mRNA expression at 6 h (fold exchange 1.0
± 0.01 for the contralesional side vs. 2.6 ± 0.03 for the
ipsilesional side, p<0.001), 12 h (fold exchange 1.2±0.04
for the contralesional side vs. 2.6±0.14 for the ipsilesional
side, p<0.001), and 24 h (fold exchange 1.3±0.01 for the
contralesional side vs. 3.4±0.02 for the ipsilesional side,
p<0.001) after 60 min of tMCAO (Fig. 1(a)). The upregulation in Kcnk5 gene expression was also reflected by Western
blot analysis as KCNK5 protein levels were markedly

elevated in the ischemic cortices (mean optical density 0.6±
0.06 for the contralesional side vs. 1.0 ± 0.13 for the
ipsilesional side, p>0.05) and basal ganglia (mean optical
density 0.5±0.10 for the contralesional side vs. 1.0±0.14 for
the ipsilesional side, p<0.05) after stroke (Fig. 1(b and b’)).
This result was validated by immunohistochemistry using a
KCNK5-specific antibody. Twenty-four hours after 60 min of
tMCAO, a strong KCNK5 staining could be detected within
the ischemic brain area of WT mice, whereas KCNK5 was
completely absent in the nonischemic brain (Fig. 1(c)).
Notably, double labeling with neuronal marker NeuN revealed
that KCNK5 expression in vivo, i.e. after tMCAO, was specifically restricted to ischemic neurons, an observation that
could also be confirmed in vitro (Fig. 2). Incubation of vital
brain slices (Fig. 2(a)) or hippocampal neuronal cell cultures
(Fig. 2(b)) from WT mice for 4 h under hypoxic conditions
mimicked the in vivo phenotype as only ischemic neurons—
as visualized by neuronal marker NeuN—expressed KCNK5.
Normoxia, by contrast, was unable to induce KCNK5

upregulation (Fig. 2b) which is in line with a previous report
[30]. Taken together, our data indicate that the K2P channel
KCNK5 is strongly induced by ischemic conditions in vivo,
ex vivo, and in vitro and therefore suggest a major functional
involvement of KCNK5 in ischemic stroke.
KCNK5 deficiency protects from ischemic stroke
Based on the observation that hypoxia specifically induces
KCNK5 upregulation, we next investigated the functional role
of KCNK5 in experimental cerebral ischemia. We subjected
male 6- to 8-week-old Kcnk5−/− mice and C57BL/6 WT mice
to 60 min of tMCAO and assessed infarct volumes as well as
neurologic and functional deficits 24 h afterwards. Stroke
volumes on day 1 were significantly reduced, by ≈40 %, in
Kcnk5−/− mice compared with those in WT controls (88.0±
4.3 mm3 for WT vs. 53.8±7.8 mm3 for Kcnk5−/−, p<0.01;
Fig. 3(a)). Importantly, smaller infarct volumes in Kcnk5−/−
mice also translated into significantly improved functional
outcomes compared with those in WT controls as assessed
by the Bederson score, reflecting the global neurologic status
(median 3.0 [2.0, 3.0] for WT vs. 2.0 [1.5, 3.0] for Kcnk5−/−,
p<0.01; Fig. 3(a’)) and the grip test reflecting motor function
and coordination (median 2.0 [2.0, 3.0] for WT vs. 3.0 [3.0,
4.0] for Kcnk5−/−, p<0.01; Fig. 3(a’)).
To investigate if KCNK5 deficiency only provides stroke
protection in the acute phase (day 1, Fig. 3(a)), we also
determined infarct volumes and stroke development in
Kcnk5−/− mice and controls over a longer period after ischemic stroke (Fig. 3(b)). Serial MRI on living mice confirmed
smaller stroke volumes in Kcnk5−/− mice 24 h after tMCAO as
hyperintense areas on T2-weighted images which are typical
for acute cerebral infarction were significantly smaller than
those in WT mice (105.9 ± 6.5 mm3 for WT vs. 76.5 ±
11.1 mm3 for Kcnk5−/−, p<0.05; Fig. 3(b’)). On day 7 after
tMCAO, the size of infarctions assessed in individual Kcnk5−/
−
mice by sequential MRI remained significantly smaller than
that in the controls (78.2± 9.0 mm3 for WT vs. 50.43±
5.2 mm3 for Kcnk5−/−, p<0.05; Fig. 3(b’)) and infarctions
did not increase over time, thus excluding delayed infarct
growth (p>0.05). The alleged shrinkage in infarct volume in
both groups 1 week after stroke was because of infarct maturation and subsequent “fogging effects” on MRI [4] rather
than a true reduction in infarct volumes.
KCNK5 deficiency protects from neuronal apoptosis
Next, we sought to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of
the stroke protective phenotype observed in Kcnk5−/− mice
after tMCAO. Based on our findings that (i) KCNK5 expression is strongly induced in ischemic neurons 24 h after stroke
(Figs. 1 and 2), and that (ii) KCNK5 deficiency decreases
infarct volumes and neurologic deficits in the same

experimental setting, we suggest an involvement of KCNK5
in pro-apopototic pathways as described for other K2P channels [45]. Cerebral ischemia initiates phosphorylation and
activation of the pro-survival transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in neurons which has
been implicated to trigger anti-apoptotic signaling and to
attenuate neurodegeneration [36, 47]. Western blot analysis
revealed that protein levels of both CREB and phosphorylated, i.e. activated, CREB indeed were significantly elevated in
the ischemic cortices of Kcnk5−/− mice 24 h after stroke in

comparison to those of WT controls (mean optical density of
CREB 1.2±0.08 for WT vs. 1.7±0.09 for Kcnk5−/−, p<0.001;
mean optical density of Phospho-CREB 1.8±0.21 for WT vs.
3.0±0.27 for Kcnk5−/−, p<0.001; Fig. 4(a and a’)). No differences between the groups were observed in the ipsilesional
basal ganglia (p>0.05). Besides promoting neuronal survival
via CREB activation, KCNK5 might also participate in antiapoptotic mechanisms to prevent neuronal damage, a highly
detrimental process in stroke pathogenesis [37, 56]. Therefore,
we analyzed the amount of typical pro-apoptotic factors like

apoptosis-inducing factor 1 (AIF1) [24] and caspase-9 [56] in
the ischemic brains of Kcnk5−/− and WT mice 24 h after
tMCAO by Western blot (Fig. 4(b)). In accordance with a
pro-apoptotic effect of KCNK5 in ischemic neurons, significantly lower levels of both AIF1 and caspase-9 could be
detected in the ipsilesional cortices of KCNK5-deficient mice
(mean optical density of AIF1 0.9±0.05 for WT vs. 0.7±0.04

for Kcnk5−/−, p<0.01; mean optical density of caspase-9 3.5±
0.09 for WT vs. 2.7±0.21 for Kcnk5−/−, p<0.01; Fig. 4(b’)),
whereas no differences could be observed in the ipsilesional
basal ganglia between the groups (p>0.05). Consistent with
decreased amounts of pro-apoptotic factors in ischemic brain
areas of Kcnk5−/−, we also found significantly less apoptotic
cells within the ischemic hemispheres of Kcnk5−/− mice.

982

Double labeling of brain sections with TUNEL and NeuN
revealed widespread apoptosis of neurons in WT mice 24 h
after stroke onset (Fig. 4(c)). In contrast, the number of apoptotic neurons was significantly lower in Kcnk5−/− mice subjected to tMCAO (TUNEL-positive cells/mm2 84±14 for WT
vs. 48±6 for Kcnk5−/−, p<0.05; Fig. 4(c’)) and thus substantiated the neuroprotective effect of KCNK5 deficiency.
KCNK5 deficiency does not affect T cell function
or blood-brain barrier stability after tMCAO
It is well established that postischemic inflammatory immune
responses remarkably contribute to infarct development, progression, and functional damage after stroke. As KCNK5 was
previously shown to be expressed and functionally relevant on
human T lymphocytes under pathogenic circumstances [9,
10], we analyzed whether KCNK5 on T cells might play a
role in cerebral ischemia as well. We first evaluated the
expression of KCNK5 in different blood cell types (Fig. 5(a,
b)). While KCNK5 expression was nearly absent in platelets,
macrophages, and neutrophils neither with nor without stimulation, considerable Kcnk5 mRNA levels were detected in
naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which even increased after
stimulation (Fig. 5(a)). Of note, platelets do not have a nucleus, and only low mRNA levels, but also KCNK5 protein, was
not apparent on platelets (Fig. 5(b)). Furthermore, Western
blot analysis confirmed the presence of KCNK5 in naïve T
cells as well as its upregulation upon stimulation, i.e. in an
inflammatory milieu, such as in ischemic stroke. To investigate whether KCNK5 influences the infiltration of CD4+ or
CD8+ T cells into the ischemic brain, we determined the
absolute numbers of viable CD4+ and CD8+ T cells per
ipsilesional hemisphere 24 h after tMCAO in Kcnk5−/− mice
and WT controls (Fig. 5(c)). Flow cytometry did not reveal
significant differences in the number of CD8+ T cells entering
the ischemic brains of Kcnk5−/− mice or WT mice (87±13 for
WT vs. 48±6 for Kcnk5−/−). The number of CD4+ T cells,
however, was remarkably lower in Kcnk5−/− mice than that in
WT controls (251±67 for WT vs. 93±18 for Kcnk5−/−). As
KCNK5 deficiency appreciably effects CD4+ T cell infiltration after stroke, we finally performed adoptive transfer experiments using Rag1−/− mice together with Kcnk5−/− or WT
CD4+ T cells to detect an effect of KCNK5 on T cells in stroke
pathophysiology. Rag1−/− mice are well suited to analyze
lymphocyte function in cerebral ischemia as these mice lack
T cells and B cells and are profoundly protected from ischemic
neurodegeneration in the tMCAO model [38, 39]. Untreated
Rag1−/− mice were protected from ischemic stroke as infarct
volumes and neurologic deficits were markedly reduced at
day 1 after 60 min of tMCAO (39.8±5.7 mm3; Bederson score
median, 2.0 [1.0, 2.75]; Grip test median, 4.5 [3.25, 5.0];
Fig. 5(d and d’)) which is in line with those of previous reports
[38–40]. However, reconstitution of Rag1−/− mice with CD4+

Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol (2015) 467:973–987

T cells from WT mice and Kcnk5−/− mice restored the susceptibility of Rag1−/− mice to ischemic brain damage as infarct
size (90.1±6.8 mm3 for Rag1−/− +WT CD4+, p<0.001, and
86.0 ± 5.2 mm3 for Rag1−/− + Kcnk5−/− CD4+, p < 0.001,
p > 0.05 for Rag1−/− + WT CD4+ vs. Rag1−/− + Kcnk5−/−
CD4 + ; Fig. 5(d)) and neurologic outcome measures
(Bederson score median, 3.0 [2.5, 3.0] for Rag1−/− +WT
CD4+, p<0.05, and median, 3.0 [3.0, 3.0] for Rag1−/− +
Kcnk5−/− CD4+, p<0.05, p>0.05 for Rag1−/− +WT CD4+ vs.
Rag1−/− +Kcnk5−/−; grip-test score median, 3.0 [3.0, 3.5] for
Rag1−/− +WT CD4+, p<0.05, and median, 3.0 [3.0, 3.75] for
Rag1−/− +Kcnk5−/− CD4+, p<0.05, p>0.05 for Rag1−/− +WT
CD4+ vs. Rag1−/− +Kcnk5−/−; Fig. 5(d’)) were indistinguishable from WT mice. This indicates that the beneficial effect of
KCNK5 deficiency in experimental stroke is independent of
KCNK5-mediated T cell functions.
Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and vascular dysfunction represent frequent causes of secondary infarct
growth, and K2P channels have been reported to be expressed
in the vasculature [31, 12]. To investigate if KCNK5 deficiency alters the structure and function of the cerebral vasculature
in ischemic stroke, we first analyzed the constitution of the
overall brain vessel architecture in naïve Kcnk5−/− and WT
mice (Fig. S1 and Table S1). Ink perfusion revealed a complete circle of Willis and identical middle cerebral artery
trunks in both genotypes, indicating that KCNK5 does not
influence the constitution of the cerebral vasculature under
physiologic conditions. This assumption was corroborated by
our in vitro observation that KCNK5 is nearly absent in
cultivated endothelial cells, i.e. the cells that line the interior
of blood vessel, of WT mice under normoxic conditions
(Fig. S2a). Ischemia, however, resulted in a slight, but detectable, upregulation of KCNK5 in endothelial cells. The contribution of KCNK5 to stroke-related endothelial dysfunction
and BBB disruption was finally assessed in vivo in Kcnk5−/−
and WT mice subjected to 60 min of tMCAO. Determination
of brain edema revealed similar amounts in Kcnk5−/− mice and
WT controls on day 1 after stroke (12.2±1.0 % for WT vs. 9.5
±1.7 % for Kcnk5−/−, p>0.05; Fig. S2b). In line with these
findings, the presence and degradation of the tight junction
protein occludin was unchanged in the cortices and basal
ganglia of Kcnk5−/−mice compared with that of WT mice
(mean optical density of cortex 0.8±0.08 for WT vs. 0.8±
0.04 for Kcnk5−/−, p>0.05; mean optical density of basal
ganglia 0.8 ± 0.03 for WT vs. 0.9 ± 0.03 for Kcnk5 −/− ,
p>0.05; Fig. S2 c and c’).

ischemic stroke. After tMCAO in WT mice, KCNK5 was
significantly upregulated in the ischemic hemisphere in contrast to the contralateral side. These findings were corroborated by ex vivo experiments demonstrating that incubation of
brain slices and neuronal cell cultures under hypoxic conditions initiated KCNK5 upregulation. Genetic deletion of
KCNK5 largely reduced ischemic brain damage after experimental stroke by promoting neuronal survival and concomitantly reducing neuronal cell death. Importantly, although
KCNK5 was also found to be expressed in T lymphocytes
and endothelial cells, KCNK5 deficiency did not attenuate T
cell-driven stroke pathology or BBB impairment. In summary,
KCNK5 upregulation in ischemic neurons appears to induce
neuronal apoptosis by as yet unidentified mechanisms.
Our findings add another piece to the puzzle of K2P channel
involvement in cerebral ischemia. Genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of KCNK3 (TASK1) increased infarct
volumes in different stroke models with transient artery occlusion [49] or permanent artery occlusion [52]. It is assumed
that KCNK3 mediates a protective hyperpolarizing effect on
neurons after cerebral ischemia. Moreover, KCNK3 is
expressed in the adrenal gland, and an additional effect via
blood pressure reduction in male animals has been proposed
[52]. In contrast, Kcnk9−/− (Task3−/−) mice displayed no altered sensitivity to cerebral ischemia [27, 52]. Activation of
KCNK2 (TREK1), another neuroprotective K2P channel, by
polyunsaturated fatty acids prevents neuronal death in both an
in vivo model of transient global ischemia and an in vitro
model of excitotoxicity [14]. In agreement, deletion of
TREK1 resulted in a significantly worse outcome in different
animal models of experimental stroke [32]. Kcnk10−/−
(Traak−/−) animals displayed no altered sensitivity to cerebral
ischemia [52].
A higher expression of KCNK5 has previously been shown
in hippocampal neurons and perivascular astrocytes in a rat
model of pilocarpine-induced epileptic seizures [35]. In contrast, human KCNK5 has been shown to be transcriptionally
downregulated by chronic hypoxia [16]. A binding site for the
O2-sensitive protein Elk-1 was identified as an underlying
mechanism. However, comparing murine and human DNA
sequences, we were not able to identify a comparable Elk-1
binding site in the promoter region of the murine Kcnk5 gene.
Furthermore, an involvement of this pathway in our model
seems unlikely, as regulation of potassium channel expression
is different between chronic hypoxia and acute O2 sensing.
The ischemic/hypoxic period in our in vivo acute animal
model was 60 min followed by complete reperfusion in contrast to longer incubation periods (48 h in vitro) reported
before [16]. Although KCNK5 upregulation might represent
a common cellular response in different pathophysiological
conditions, one can only speculate on the underlying mechanisms as well as on the functional consequences. Different
pathways and stimuli might lead to KCNK5 upregulation.

Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol (2015) 467:973–987

Interestingly, KCNK5 was recently described to be present
in two estrogen receptor α-positive (EFα+) tumor cell lines
where it was further upregulated by 17β-estradiol treatment
[2]. Notably, ischemic stroke increases expression of
ERα, and this receptor is not suggested to be involved
in estrogen-mediated neuroprotection in female mice
[59]. An involvement of ERα signaling in KCNK5
upregulation in ischemic stroke is at the moment still
speculative but certainly worth future investigations,
especially as the Kcnk5 enhancer sequence contains
estrogen-responsive elements [21].
In principle, potassium channels can exert both anti- and
pro-apoptotic effects [11, 42]. Activation of potassium channels favors apoptosis in a broad array of cell types and pathophysiological scenarios (see Lang et al. [42] for a comprehensive overview). It has still not been fully understood which
factors drive potassium channels to act in an anti- or proapoptotic way in a specific pathophysiological scenario.
Interestingly, an intracellular depletion of K+ ions is a sign
of early neuronal apoptosis [55], and K2P channels have been
shown to be involved in this pathway [45]. An important role
of KCNK5 has been shown for so-called regulatory volume
decrease, in which osmotocially swollen cells recover their
volume by KCl loss through selective channels in different
cell types [3, 15, 21]. Regulatory volume decrease pathways
are often similar to apoptotic volume decrease, and in accordance, KCNK5 has been shown to induce apoptosis in kidney
cells and B lymphocytes [41, 54]. We here suggest that neurons in acute ischemic stroke start to express KCNK5, which
exerts an important role in initiating the apoptotic cascade.
Since the overall brain architecture and physiology (i.e.
cerebral blood flow, brain water content, and ion composition)
as well as selective regional vulnerability can differ profoundly between different brain regions after cerebral ischemia [13,
60], we decided to analyze apoptotic mechanisms in the
ischemic cortices and basal ganglia separately. Indeed, we
found that differences in (phospho-)CREB, AIF-1, and
caspase-9 expression between WT and Kcnk5−/− mice were
mainly restricted to ischemic cortices, indicating differential
regional regulation.
Inflammatory pathways promote secondary damage in
stroke [38, 44]. Previously, an important role for KCNK5
was identified for T lymphocyte activation and effector functions under autoimmune inflammatory conditions [9, 10]. A
potential role of KCNK5 on early infiltrating immune cells in
the stroke area could be excluded as macrophages and neutrophil granulocytes did not show any KCNK5 expression.
Furthermore, adoptive transfer experiments using WT or
Kcnk5−/− CD4+ T lymphocytes in RAG1-deficient animals
did not show significant changes between the experimental
groups. Therefore, an additional involvement of KCNK5 in
the immune system seems to be unlikely in the context of
acute ischemic stroke.

Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol (2015) 467:973–987

At present, a lack of highly selective KCNK5 inhibitors
prohibits further investigations on pharmacological KCNK5
modulation in stroke research. However, some negative effects of systemic KCNK5 blockade due to its wide expression
in peripheral organs should be taken into consideration.
Experiments using Kcnk5−/− mice suggest an involvement in
renal bicarbonate reabsorption as well as in central breathing
control. Furthermore, KCNK5 has, among others, been linked
to lymphocyte activation, intestinal smooth muscle cells, and
sperm function [21]. Therefore, the clinical vigilance for
KCNK5 inhibitors should include a broad possible spectrum
of unwanted side effects such as altered electrolyte compositions, digestion problems, infertility, or growth retardation.
In summary, our findings describe an as yet unknown
involvement of KCNK5 channels in acute ischemic stroke,
most likely via a participation in neuronal apoptotic pathways.
Further pharmacological studies will be warranted to evaluate
the therapeutic potential of KCNK5 blockade in ischemic
neurodegeneration.
