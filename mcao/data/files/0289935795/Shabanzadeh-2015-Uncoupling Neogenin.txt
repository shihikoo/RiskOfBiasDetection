promotes neuronal survival and functional recovery
after stroke

The dependence receptor Neogenin and its ligand, the repulsive guidance molecule a (RGMa), regulate apoptosis and axonal
growth in the developing and the adult central nervous system (CNS). Here, we show that this pathway has also a critical role in
neuronal death following stroke, and that providing RGMa to neurons blocks Neogenin-induced death. Interestingly, the Neogenin
pro-death function following ischemic insult depends on Neogenin association with lipid rafts. Thus, a peptide that prevents
Neogenin association with lipid rafts increased neuronal survival in several in vitro stroke models. In rats, a pro-survival effect was
also observed in a model of ocular ischemia, as well as after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Treatments that prevented
Neogenin association with lipid rafts improved neuronal survival and the complexity of the neuronal network following occlusion
of the middle artery. Toward the development of a treatment for stroke, we developed a human anti-RGMa antibody that also
prevents Neogenin association with lipid rafts. We show that this antibody also protected CNS tissue from ischemic damage and
that its application resulted in a significant functional improvement even when administrated 6 h after artery occlusion. Thus, our
results draw attention to the role of Neogenin and lipid rafts as potential targets following stroke.

Ischemic stroke is of major public health significance as it may
lead to permanent loss-of-functions or death. This is due to the
pronounced susceptibility of adult central nervous system
(CNS) neurons to undergo apoptotic death when injured.
Many clinical trials have focused on reducing excitotoxicity to
ameliorate neuronal death in the penumbra.1 However, the
short duration of excitotoxicity following stroke does not allow
for effective treatment in the clinic. There is emerging
consensus that a better therapy should be obtained by
(i) targeting the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis and
(ii) using this knowledge to develop effective treatments that
maintain adequate brain functions.2
The transmembrane protein Neogenin is a dependence
receptor that causes death or survival depending on ligand
(repulsive guidance molecule a (RGMa)) absence or presence, respectively.3,4 In cell cultures, as well as in the
developing chick brain, Neogenin induces apoptosis in the
absence of RGMa.3 Cell survival can be rescued either by
addition of RGMa or by Neogenin silencing. We recently have
demonstrated that RGMa can also rescue neuronal cell death
following traumatic CNS injury.5 When retinal ganglion cell
(RGC) axons were severed by optic nerve crush, injection of

RGMa into the vitreous significantly increased cell survival.5
Thus, the Neogenin/RGMa pathway is involved in neuronal
cell death following injury. More recent studies revealed that
this pathway is involved in axonal regeneration following
stroke. RGMa is upregulated in the penumbra of human
patients who died of stroke.6 Interestingly, electrical stimulation downregulates RGMa expression, which correlates with
an improved functional outcome following middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO).7,8 Although Neogenin has been
shown to be expressed in the injured brain following stroke,9
there is no direct evidence that it may have a role in the
pathology of this disease.
The plasma membrane of cells contains a combination of
glycosphingolipids and protein receptors organized in glycolipoprotein microdomains, termed lipid rafts.10 One key
difference between lipid rafts and the plasma membranes
from which they are derived is lipid composition. Lipid rafts
generally contain twice the amount of cholesterol than that
found in the surrounding bilayer.10 We recently discovered that
RGMa contains three sites of interaction with Neogenin.11 Two
of these sites interact with Neogenin to block axonal growth,
whereas the third site, located in the most N-terminal portion of

Neogenin presence in lipid rafts causes death after stroke

RGMa (N-Raft), binds the Neogenin immunoglobulin domain
(4Ig), to regulate recruitment of Neogenin into lipid rafts.
Treatment with either 4Ig or a newly generated monoclonal
antibody (mAb) abolished Neogenin-induced cell death
suggesting that Neogenin recruitment into rafts is essential
for Neogenin-mediated apoptosis. In this study, we assessed
the neuroprotective effects of RGMa, as well as, the effect of
altering Neogenin association with lipid rafts after cerebral–
and retinal–ischemic injuries.
Results
RGMa promotes RGC survival following ischemia. To
study the expression of RGMa and Neogenin in the adult rat
retina, we performed colocalization studies with the RNAbinding protein RBMPS, a marker for RGCs. This showed
that Neogenin and RGMa were both expressed by RGCs
(Figure 1a). As Neogenin was expressed by RGCs, we
assessed its involvement in cellular death after ischemia. To
do so, we submitted whole-mount retinae to oxygen glucose
deprivation (OGD, 1 h) followed by reperfusion. One day after
insult, cell death was visualized using propidium iodide (PI)
staining. Here, the relative PI intensity increased ~ 4-folds for
OGD-treated retinae (n = 6) when compared with controls
(n = 6; Figures 1a and b). Thus, OGD induced cellular death
within the retina. Addition of RGMa (2 μg/ml) directly to the
medium just after OGD reduced PI intensity by ~ 45%
compared with controls, indicating that RGMa promoted cell
survival (Figures 1b and c). To determine whether this prosurvival effect was mediated by Neogenin, this receptor was
neutralized using an antibody12 raised against the entire
extracellular domain of Neogenin, which suppressed the prosurvival effect of RGMa, indicating that Neogenin mediates
the RGMa effects (Figures 1b and c). Together, these results
reveal that RGMa interaction with Neogenin promotes
survival in an in vitro model for ischemic insult.
Next, we studied cell survival in vivo using a model of
transient (30 min) ophthalmic artery ligation followed by
assessment of RGC survival. Ligation of the ophthalmic
vessels produces a uniform ischemic injury in the inner retina,
the location of RGC cell bodies.13 RGMa was applied by
intraocular injections (1 μl at 1 μg/μl in PBS) at 3 and 10 days
after ischemia, and the survival of Fluorogold pre-labeled
RGCs was quantified at 14 days post-ischemia. In controls
(n = 5), the average density of RGCs was ~ 950 cells/mm2
(Figures 1d and e). Injection of RGMa significantly increased
RGC densities by ~ 50% to ~ 1500 cells/mm2 (n = 5; Po0.001;
Figures 1d and e). Together with the above presented results,
this revealed that the RGMa Neogenin pathway is involved in
RGC death after ischemia.
Generation of an antibody that alters Neogenin association with lipid rafts. Neogenin requires to be associated
with lipid rafts to induce cell death.14 We have shown that
recruitment toward lipid rafts involves a cis-interaction
between the 4Ig domain in Neogenin and the N-Raft.14
Furthermore, overexpressing recombinant 4Ig to compete
with endogenous domains displaced Neogenin from rafts
toward non-raft fractions. To further validate this observation,
Cell Death and Disease

and in order to develop therapeutics that promote CNS
recovery, we generated human antibodies targeting RGMa
by ProFusion mRNA display. Antibodies were selected on
binding to RGMa and the ability to prevent the interaction
between 4Ig and N-RGMa in an ELISA assay. AE12-1Y was
generated as a high-affinity RGMa-selective mAb with
comparable binding to human, rat and mouse RGMa. In
western blots, AE12-1Y specifically detected a 55-kDa band
in RGMa-transfected cells (Figure 2a). The antibody blocked
the cis-interaction between the 4Ig domain in Neogenin and
the N-Raft (Figure 2b). In contrast, a human IgG did not
interfere in the interaction between these two domains. To
confirm the hypothesis that Neogenin is recruited into lipid
rafts by a specific interaction between 4Ig and N-Raft, we
evaluated the effect of AE12-1Y on Neogenin association
with lipid rafts. AE12-1Y was injected into the E8 optic tectum
and the tecta were collected a day later for fractionation
analyses (Figures 2c and d). In controls, full-length Neogenin
localized exclusively to the raft fraction (anti-myc injection).
As expected, AE12-1Y re-localized Neogenin from rafts to the
heavy membrane fractions (Figures 2c and d), indicating that
this antibody broke Neogenin association with lipid rafts.
Blocking Neogenin association with lipid rafts promotes
survival in models of retinal ischemia. The abovepresented results suggest that the RGMa/Neogenin pathway
is a key trigger of cellular death following ischemia. As we
have shown that Neogenin requires association with lipid
rafts in order to induce cellular death,14 we tested the role of
Neogenin association with lipid rafts on retinal whole mounts
following OGD. To do so, we first submitted retinal whole
mounts to OGD in the presence of AE12-1Y (Figures 2e and
f). In agreement with a role of Neogenin in stroke-induced
death, the antibody significantly increased cell survival when
compared with control (n = 5; anti-myc). Relative PI intensity
was reduced by 47% (4.2 ± 1.4) in AE12-1Y-treated retinae
(n = 5) when compared with OGD+myc (n = 5; 7.9 ± 2.1).
Having shown that AE12-1Y promoted cell survival in vitro,
we next studied whether blocking Neogenin association with
lipid rafts can also have the same benefit in vivo. We
performed ocular ischemia using ligation of the ophthalmic
artery, and 4Ig and AE12-1Y (n = 5 for each) were applied
intraocularly (2 μl at 1 μg/μl in PBS) at 3 and 10 days after
ischemia (Figures 2g and h). Fourteen days post-ischemia,
Fluorogold pre-labeled RGCs were quantified to evaluate
survival. Similar to the injection of RGMa, the injection of both
4Ig and AE12-1Y increased RGC survival by ~ 50%
(Po0.001; Figures 2e and h). To confirm that Neogenin
localization in lipid rafts is involved in RGC death, we
performed experiments with the N-raft peptide and methylbeta-cyclodextrin (MβCD). The N-Raft peptide (2 μl at 1 μg/μl
in PBS) binds specifically to Neogenin to prevent its association with lipid rafts. MβCD (10 mg/kg) is a cholesterol chelator
that disrupts lipid rafts. In agreement with above-presented
results, we observed that N-Raft and MβCD treatments
increased cell survival by ~ 50% (Figure 2i).
AE12-1Y has been raised against the N-Raft that regulates
Neogenin association with lipid rafts. We have reported that
the C-terminal part of RGMa interacts with Neognin to regulate
various biological events. To ensure that the effect observed

aspects of RGMa function, we studied cell survival after

RGMa antibody (2 μl at 1 μg/μl in PBS at 3 and 10 days after

the notion RGMa, acting in trans on Neogenin, may promote
cell survival. It also suggests that the effect observed with
AE12-1Y most likely resulted from its effect on Neogenin relocalization outside lipid rafts. Taken together, these results
revealed that Neogenin requires to be associated with lipid
rafts to induce RGC death after ischemia.
Blocking Neogenin association with lipid rafts prevents
caspase-3-mediated apoptosis following OGD. In the
developing CNS, Neogenin induces death by activating
caspase-3, a known regulator of apoptosis. As caspase-3 is
a key factor in cellular death following stroke, we decided to
study whether or not preventing Neogenin association with
lipid rafts has any influence on caspase-3 activation.
Neogenin is expressed by cortical neurons (Figures 3a and
b), thus we used these cultures as a model and performed
OGD (1 h) in the presence of control antibody (human IgG,
1 μg/ml), 4Ig (1 μg/ml) or AE12-1Y (1 μg/ml). Six hours after
reperfusion, the morphology of control cells was markedly
altered and neurons had lost more of their axonal/dendritic
network (Figure 3c). In comparison, the presence of either 4Ig
or AE12-1Y appeared to protect neuronal morphology. As
expected, treatment with either 4Ig or AE12-1Y, also
significantly reduced the number of caspase-3-positive cells
following OGD, which was reduced by ~ 2-folds when
compared with controls (28.1 ± 3.9% for 4Ig and
23.6 ± 3.2% for AE12-1Y versus 56.2 ± 9.4 for the control).
In western blots, addition of 4Ig and AE12-1Y reduced
caspase-3 activation by ~ 2-folds, respectively, when compared with controls (human IgG; Figure 3f). The abovepresented data suggest that Neogenin association with lipid
rafts triggers caspase-3 activation and that application of
either 4Ig or AE12-1Y can block this process. To further
assess this possibility, we studied Neogenin raft localization
in cortical neurons 1 h after OGD. As expected, when AE121Y was added to the medium, Neogenin was present in the
heavy membrane fractions (Figure 3g). The situation
appeared different when control antibody was added to the
medium. In three independent experiments, we could not
detect any Neogenin in fractions, suggesting that OGD led to
Neogenin degradation. As we have shown that Neogenin
requires to be cleaved by caspase-3 to be a pro-apoptotic
molecule, we assessed the possibility that the absence of
Neogenin following OGD resulted from proteolytical degradation by caspases. To do so, we first showed that OGD did not
alter the mRNA levels for Neogenin in cortical neuron

cultures (Figure 3h). Then, we studied the effect of the
caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK on Neogenin protein levels.
Interestingly, pre-treatment with Z-VAD-FMK 2 h before OGD
restored Neogenin levels to the one observed in control
experiments (Figures 3i and j). This fits with our previous
data showing that in order to activate caspase-3, Neogenin
requires to be proteolytically processed by caspases.3 Taken
together, these results suggest that Neogenin association
with lipid rafts is involved in caspase-3 activation following
ischemia.
The 4Ig peptide reduced functional deficits and brain
damage following Ischemia. As preventing Neogenin
association with lipid rafts proved to be neuroprotective
following retinal ischemia, we tested the effects of this
intervention on brain infarct development after transient
MCAO (Figure 4). Cerebral ischemia can be experimentally
induced by injecting either a heterogeneous or an autologous
pre-formed clot into the MCA (thromboembolic stroke).15–17
Neurological scores were used to assess functional deficits
and tail vein injection of 4Ig (10 mg/kg) was performed just
after occlusion. Neurological scores were recorded before
MCA occlusion and at 2 , 8 , 24 , 48 , 72 h and 7 days
afterward (Figure 4a). At 2 and 8 h after MCA occlusion, all
animals showed significant motor deficits, with median scores
of ~ 3.2 for all groups (control, 4Ig; n = 6 for each group). At
48 h after MCAO, neurological scores were not significantly
different indicating that insults in the control and 4Ig groups
were similar. Interestingly, 72 h following occlusion a significant difference was observed between controls and 4Ig
animals. This difference increased slightly until termination of
the experiments at 7 days following insult. Thus, 4Ig
treatment produced a delayed behavioral improvement after
stroke. Seizures were observed in three rats in the control
group at 24 or 48 h after embolization. In contrast, no seizure
activity was present in the 4Ig-treated cohort.
To evaluate the effects of 4Ig treatment on brain damage, we
performed a TTC staining and compared the relative volumes
of brain tissue between the infarcted and non-infarcted
hemispheres of the brain. Brain infarct reduced by ~ 50%
following intravenous injection of 4Ig when compared with
control: brain infarct volume in control and 4Ig groups was
27.5 ± 4.9% and 14.7 ± 2.2%, respectively, at 7 days after
MCAO (Po0.005; Figure 4c). Similarly, the size of the edema
was significantly reduced and was of 7.0 ± 0.5% in the 4Igtreated group and 9.0 ± 0.7% in the control group (Po0.05;

Figure 4d). These data taken together with the in vitro data
suggest that 4Ig treatment preserved neurons following
ischemic insult. To confirm that 4Ig prevented neuronal death,
we performed a Fluoro-Jade B staining, which reveals dying
neurons.18 Brain sections were stained and the number of
Fluoro-jade-positive cells quantified. Treatment with 4Ig
reduced the number of positive neurons by ~ 35% when
compared with control (519.4 ± 46.1 and 344.1 ± 25, respectively; Figure 5b).
To assess neuronal integrity after stroke and 4Ig treatment,
NF-200 immunostaining19 was examined in the peri-infarct
region of the injured cerebral hemisphere (Figure 5c). The
relative mean number of NF-200-positive neurons was
significantly increased after 4Ig administration (143,225 ± /mm2)
compared with the control group (97,829 ± /mm2) (Po0.01;
Figure 5d), at 7 days after ischemia.
Finally, to determine whether 4Ig prevents neuronal death
by blocking caspase-3 activation, we performed an anticaspase-3 staining in the peri-infarct region 7 days after
ischemia. Together these results show that treatment with the
4Ig domain of Neogenin prevents neuronal damage following
stroke, which results in improved functional recovery.
AE12-1Y reduced functional deficits and brain damage
following ischemia. As 4Ig reduced functional deficits
following MCAO, we decided to confirm the role of Neogenin
association with lipid rafts using the AE12-1Y antibody. In
order to evaluate whether delayed application of AE12-1Y
can also reduce stroke-induced damages, we injected the
antibody 2 and 6 h after MCAO (n = 6 for each group).
Neurological scores were recorded before MCA occlusion
and at 8 , 24 , 48 , 72 h and 7 days afterward (Figure 6a).
When the treatment was initiated 2 h after ischemia, the initial
neurological scores were not significantly different in both the
control (human IgG antibody) and AE12-1Y-treated animals.
Similar to 4Ig treatment, the 2 h delayed application of AE121Y resulted in a significant improvement of behavioral scores
72 h following occlusion (Figure 6a). This difference was
maintained until termination of the experiments at 7 days
following ischemic insult. The same trend was observed
when treatment with AE12-1Y was initiated 6 h following
ischemia. Thus, not only treatment with AE12-1Y resulted in
behavioral improvement after stroke but it could be delayed
by 6 h with the same behavioral benefit. Seizures were
observed in three rats in the control group at 24 or 48 h after

embolization. In contrast, no seizure activity was present in
the AE12-1Y-treated cohort.
To study the effects of AE12-1Y treatment on brain
damage, we performed a TTC staining, which revealed a
~ 50% reduction of brain infarct following intravenous injection
of AE12-1Y at 2 h, when compared with controls (Figures 6b
and c). A similar reduction (~ 45%) was observed when
treatment started 6 h after insult (Figures 6b and c). Edema
size was decreased by ~45% when treatment was performed
2 h following MCAO and was 4.8 ± 0.5% in the AE12-1Ytreated group and 9.1 ± 0.8% in the control group (Po0.05).
Reduction of the edema size was less pronounced
(~35%) when treatment was performed 6 h following stroke,
nevertheless a significant difference was still observed
(Po0.05; Figure 6d).
To further demonstrate that AE12-1Y prevented neuronal
death, we performed a Fluoro-jade B staining (Figure 7a).
Treatment with AE12-1Y, 2 h following stroke, reduced the
number of positive neurons by ~ 45% when compared with
controls: number of Fluoro-jade cells in AE12-1Y and control
animals was 519 ± 46.3 and 298.7 ± 10.8, respectively
(Figure 7b). Similarly, injection of AE12-1Y 6 h after MCAO
reduced of Fluoro-jade cells (337.6 ± 25.9) by ~ 40% when
compared with controls. To assess neuronal integrity, NF-200
immunostaining was examined in the peri-infarct region of the
injured cerebral hemisphere 7 days after ischemia (Figure 7c).
The relative mean number of NF-200-positive neurons was
significantly increased when AE12-1Y was injected 2 h after
MCAO (141 911 ± 2956/mm2) compared with the control group
(97 829 ± 2356/mm2) (Po0.01; Figure 7d). Injection 6 h after
ischemia also significantly increased the number of NF-200positive cells (139 469 ± 2428/mm2). Together these data reveal
that (i) blocking Neogenin association with lipid rafts prevents
neuronal damages following ischemia and that (ii) this treatment
can be delayed and still results in significant functional benefits.
Discussion
This study contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms
that control neuronal cell death following stroke, and reports
several key findings. (i) Soluble recombinant RGMa significantly
increased neuronal survival following stroke. (ii) The pathway
through which RGMa mediates survival following ischemia
involves Neogenin. (iii) Neogenin pro-death activity following
stroke involves both an association with lipid rafts and activation

Figure 3 Blocking Neogenin association with lipid rafts decreases apoptosis and caspase-3 activation. (a and b) Neogenin is expressed in cortical neurons. Primary cortical
neurons were cultured and submitted to (a) western blot for Neogenin and (b) double labeling for F-actin (Alexa-Fluor Phalloidin) and Neogenin. Western blot as well as
immunofluorescence revealed a strong Neogenin expression. Bar, 100 μm. (c) Primary cortical neurons were subjected to 1 h OGD and then treated with either human IgG
(1 μg/ml, control), 4Ig (1 μg/ml) or AE12-1Y (1 μg/ml) for 6 h. Cells were immune stained for active caspase-3 and βIII-tubulin. (d) Quantification of experiments presented in
c revealed that OGD resulted in an increase of caspase-3-positive cells (*Po0.005). The addition of both 4Ig and AE12-1Y to the medium significantly decreased the number of
caspase-3-positive cells (*Po0.005). Bar, 150 μm. (e) Western blot analysis on cells following OGD plus treatment with control (human IgG), 4Ig and AE12-1Y. The intensity of
active caspase-3 bands appeared weaker in the presence of 4Ig and AE12-1Y. (f) Quantification of western blot experiments showed that the presence of 4Ig and AE12-1Y
significantly reduced caspase-3 activation (*Po0.005). (g) Cortical neurons were submitted to OGD in the presence of 1 μg/ml of AE12-1Y or control (human IgG 1 μg/ml) and
fractionation was performed 1 h after ischemia. In control experiment, Neogenin (Neo.) signal could not be seen. In the presence of AE12-1Y, Neogenin colocalized with the heavy
fraction marker transferrin receptor (TfR). Flotillin was used as a marker for lipid rafts. (h) Assessment of the relative Neogenin mRNA levels (relative to HPRT1) in OGD and
control cultures revealed no significant (NS) difference. (i) Cortical neurons were treated with the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (20 μM) or DMSO (control) for 2 h and
submitted to OGD for 30 min. Western blotting analysis was performed with Neogenin and GAPDH antibodies. In the presence of Z-VAD-FMK, levels for Neogenin appeared
higher. (j) Neogenin levels relative to GAPDH were quantified, which demonstrates that incubation with Z-VAD-FMK restored Neogenin levels. Data from three independent
experiments (*Po0.05)

We have previously shown that RGMa promotes cell
survival through association with Neogenin in the developing
brain.3 Based on this work, we hypothesized that RGMa may
interact with Neogenin to promote neuronal survival following

survival in retinal whole mounts following OGD and that
Neogenin mediates this effect. Interestingly, Netrin, another
Neogenin ligand has also been shown to promote neuronal
survival following stroke.20,21 Although still elusive, the
mechanism by which Netrin-1 promotes survival following
stroke, appears different than the one uncovered in this study
for two reasons. First, location of Neogenin-positive cells
differed from that of netrin-1-positive cells.9 Second, administration of Netrin-1 protected infarct tissue from p53-mediated
apoptosis via interaction with DCC,20 another Netrin receptor
with 88% homology to Neogenin. Thus, our study uncovers a

new mechanism by which a dependence receptor protects
neurons from death following stroke.
Our study also demonstrates that Neogenin requires to be
associated with lipid rafts to induce neuronal death following
stroke. Cholesterol, the main component of lipid rafts, has
been the subject of numerous studies following stroke.22,23 For
instance, cholesterol synthesis inhibition by means of statins is
known to be neuroprotective following stroke.23,24 Although
statins clearly promote survival, the mechanism of their
neuroprotective effects is only partly understood and is likely
to reflect an action on several pathways. Indeed, treatment

experimental paradigms

with simvastatin has been shown to reduce NMDA receptors
(NMDAR1) in lipid rafts, thereby protecting neurons from
NMDA-induced neuronal death.25 Another protective mechanism
elicited by statins is due to the inhibited synthesis of isoprenoid
intermediates, which serve as lipid attachments for a variety of
intracellular signaling molecules such as nitric oxide.26 Our
study adds another possible mechanism that accounts for the
benefit of statins following stroke. Indeed, by preventing
Neogenin association with lipid rafts statins may well prevent
the unwanted effect of this pathway.
Cell Death and Disease

Current therapeutic procedures for stroke have focused on
(i) using tissue plasminogen activator and (ii) inhibiting
excitotoxicity. However, both treatments have very narrow
therapeutic windows1,27 and targeting molecular pathways
involved in the subacute phase of stroke may provide a larger
therapeutic window. Neuronal cells mostly die by apoptosis
during ischemic brain injury.28 Thus, targeting signaling
pathways involved in apoptosis may ensure neuroprotective
efficacy over a larger time window. Caspase-3, a key apoptotic
factor, has been shown to be upregulated both in experimental

Imodels and human brain following stroke.29 Pharmacological
inhibition of this enzyme has been found to be neuroprotective
following insult.28 Caspase activation occurred up to 9 h after
MCA occlusion, and that the ischemic damage could be reduced
by caspase inhibitors injected up to 9 h after reperfusion.
Thus, targeting pathways that lead to caspase activation may
extend the treatment window following stroke. As Neogenin
activates caspase-3 to induce apoptosis, we tested whether
it can promote neuronal survival over an extended time
window. Interestingly, neuronal survival and function’s
recovery were improved even when treatment was applied
6 h following MCAO. Hence, targeting Neogenin may offer a
novel therapeutic procedure for the treatment of stroke.
Materials and Methods
Antibody generation and affinity measurements. AE12-1Y was
derived from AE12-1, a fully human anti-RGMa mAb generated via PROfusion
mRNA display technology. AE12-1Y is a high-affinity, RGMa-selective mAb. It
exhibits comparable binding affinity to human, rat and mouse RGMa, and
neutralizes RGMa activity in functional assays (chemotaxis, neurite outgrowth and
N-RGMa-4Ig interaction assay).
Protein injections and lipid raft fractionations. AE12-1Y antibody
(1 mg/ml; 5 μl) was injected in chick E8 optic tectum and tecta were collected 24 h
later. Tecta (three tecta for each set of experiment) and/or cells were solubilized in
chilled buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA and protease
inhibitor cocktail) and passed through G25 and G30 needles, respectively, and
centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cold Triton X-100 was added to the post
nuclear supernatant to a final 1% and incubated on ice for 1 h. In all, 2X volume of
2 M sucrose was added and sample placed at the bottom of a sucrose density
gradient (0.9–0.8–0.75–0.7–0.6–0.5–0.4–0.2 M) and centrifuged at 38 000 r.p.m. for
16 h in SW 60 rotor (Beckman Instruments Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada). In total,
400 μl fractions were collected from top (top numbered 1 and next eight fractions
numbered consequently). The cell preparations were run on western blots and
probed with Neogenin (H-175; Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA), Flotillin (Santa Cruz)
and TfR antibody (abm) for 2 h at RT. Odyssey goat anti-mouse secondary antibody
(1 : 4000; LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA) was used for 1 h at RT.
Injections and medications. In order to evaluate the effects of 4Ig and
AE12-1Y, on RGC survival and regeneration after ligation of the optic artery, we
delivered 2 μl intraocular injection of RGMa (500 ng/μl), 4Ig (500 ng/μl) and AE121Y (500 ng/μl) solutions at 3 and 10 days after injury. Retinal ischemia was carried
out as previously described.30,31 One week before ischemia, animals received
stereotaxic injections of 2% Fluorogold into the superior colliculus, the brain target
of RGCs, in order to retrogradely pre-label all RGCs in the retina for future
quantification.
Intraocular injections was described previously.31 Briefly, rats were anesthetized with
2% isoflurane in a mix of O2 and then the cornea was anesthetized using Alcaine eye
drops (Alcon) before intraocular injections. A pulled glass micropipette attached to a
10 μl Hamilton syringe via a hydraulic coupling through PEEK tubing was used to
deliver 4Ig, and antibody solutions into the vitreous of the eye, posterior to the limbus.32
The pipette was held in place for 5 s after injection and slowly withdrawn from the eye to
prevent reflux. Following injection, the cornea was covered with ophthalmic ointment to
prevent desiccation and animals were returned to their normal housing.
Animals were killed at 14 days after optic artery ligation, the eyes were enucleated,
the cornea and lens were removed, and the remaining eye cups containing the retinas
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h. The retinas were then removed, flatmounted and coverslipped using 50 : 50 glycerol/ PBS. Fluorogold staining in RGCs
was visualized using an Andor iXon 885+ electron-multiplying charge-coupled device
camera attached to a Leica DM LFSA microscope (Concord, ON, Canada).
Moreover, Sutter Lambda XL (Quorum Technologies, Guelph, Canada) with a liquid
light guide was used as a source of illumination. The densities of RGC were
measured at the inner (1/6 retinal eccentricity), midperiphery (1/2 retinal eccentricity)
or outer retina (5/6 retinal eccentricity) of each quadrant of the flat-mount (defined
distances from the center of the retina). This cell count was divided by a factor of 0.08,
to yield an extrapolated RGC density per unit area of cells/mm2.33
Cell Death and Disease

Rats in the MβCD group received one intraperitoneal injection of MβCD
at 1000 mg/kg immediately following optic artery ligation and then daily i.p.
injections until killing. Control rats received equivalent volumes as described
above. The rats were housed singly in a temperature-controlled room at 24 °C with
a 12-h light–dark cycle. Water and food were provided ad libitum.
In vitro stroke
Retinal whole-mount cultures: Sprague–Dawley rat pups of either sex (P14;
Charles River (Montreal, QC, Canada)) were anesthetized using 4% isoflurane and
decapitated. After taking eyeballs, they were briefly washed with PBS and 10%
germicide and placed in cold medium. Retinas were flat mounted with the ganglion
cell layer facing upward on Millicell-CM chamber (0.4 μm culture plate insert, 30mm
diameter; Millipore,Bedford, MA, USA). The retinas were cultured for 2 days (37 °C,
5% CO2) in 1 ml of culture medium, which contained Neurobasal medium, 10% fetal
bovine serum, 2% B-27 supplement, 1% glutamine and 3% antibiotic/antimycotic (all
from Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada).
Cortical neuron cultures: Mouse E16 cortical neurons were prepared as we
described earlier.34 Briefly, cortices were dissected and dissociated in 0.05%
Trypsin, 0.04% EDTA–PBS solution at 37 °C for 20 min. Cells were centrifuged at
500 r.p.m. for 5 min and seeded in B-27 supplemented Neurobasal medium (Life
Technologies, Burlington, ON, Canada) at 100 000 cells per well of 12-well poly-LLysine-coated plates (Greiner, Monroe, NC, USA).
Retinal whole-mount and cortical neurons cultures were subjected to OGD injury
as described previously.35 Briefly, cultures were washed twice in glucose-free Earl’s
balanced salt solution (EBSS: 116.4 mM NaCl, 0.8 mM MgSO4, 5.4 mM KCl, 2.6 mM
NaH2PO4, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, 1.8 mM CaCl2 and 20.1 mM HEPES pH 7.4), and
incubated in oxygen- and glucose-free EBSS in a humidified anaerobic culture
incubator filled with 93% N2, 5% CO2 and o2% O2 for 1 h. After OGD, the cultures
were replaced into neurobasal medium plus RGMa, RGMa antibody, 4Ig, PBS
(control) or control antibody (human IgG). Cells were maintained in a normal CO2
incubator until fixation with 4% PFA or collection for membrane preparations.
To assess cell survival in whole mounts, PI (final concentration, 2 g/ml) was added
directly to the medium and images were taken at the same intensity using a
fluorescence microscope every 24 h after explantation. Images of PI-stained retinas
were analyzed using ImageJ, and the fluorescence intensity at each time point was
quantified, and background fluorescence was subtracted.
To study apoptosis in cortical neurons, neurons were fixed in 4% PFA and
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X100 and co-labeled with anti-caspase-3 (1 : 750;
Cell Signaling), and βIII-tubulin (Covance, Cederlane, Burlington, ON, Canada) at
4 °C. Next day, cells were washed and incubated with Alexa 488 anti-mouse and
Alexa 555 anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1 : 500; Molecular Probes) along with
DAPI/PBS for 1 h at RT.
For western blots, neurons were lyzed in RIPA buffer and loaded on a 10%
acrylamide gel before transfer onto a nitro-cellulose membrane. Blots were probed
with (i) an anti-caspase-3 antibody and (ii) an anti GAPDH antibody for loading
control.
For treatment with pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK), cortical neurons were
pretreated with the inhibitor (20 μM) or DMSO for 2 h and then subjected to OGD for
30 min. The cultures were lysed and probed with anti-Neogenin antibody after
western blotting. The pixel areas for each band were quantified for identical areas and
the relative amounts to GAPDH levels were quantified.
Cerebral ischemic model and assessment. For thromboembolic
ischemia, a preformed blot clot was injected into the MCA via the internal carotid
artery.17,36 Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 200–250 g were anesthetized with 3.0%
isoflurane and then maintained with 1.5% isoflurane in a mixture of 30 : 70 O2 and
NO2 with a face mask during surgery. Body temperature was maintained at 37 °C
with a heating pad for the duration of surgery and the immediate postoperative
period until animals recovered fully from anesthesia. A 1.5-cm longitudinal incision
was made in the midline of the ventral cervical skin. The right common carotid
artery, right internal carotid artery and right external carotid artery (ECA) were
exposed. The distal portion of the ECA was ligated and cut. A modified
polyethylene-10 catheter, filled with bovine thrombin (Thrombostat, TM WarnerLambert Co., Morris Plains, NJ, USA), was introduced into the lumen of the right
ECA via a small puncture. Ten microliters of blood were withdrawn into the catheter
and retained for 15 min to allow formation of a clot. Once the clot was formed, the
catheter was advanced 17 mm into the internal carotid artery until its tip was
1-2 mm away from the origin of the MCA. The preformed clot in the catheter was

then injected, and the catheter removed. After surgery, the wound was closed, and
the animal was returned to its cage.
Experimental design: Animals were randomly assigned into each group
(n = 6). Animals of each group received PBS, human IgG (control, 10 mg/kg), 4Ig
(10 mg/kg) and mab AE12-1Y (10 mg/kg). Treatments were injected i.v.via tail vein,
starting immediately or every 2 and 6 h after embolization.
Infarct volume and edema size. Quantification of infarct volume and
edema was performed as previously described.17,36 The infarct volume was
expressed as a percentage of the total volume from the ipsilateral hemisphere.
Brain edema was determined by calculating the volume difference between the two
hemispheres and dividing by the volume of the left hemisphere. Seven days after
MCA occlusion, the anesthetized rats were killed. The brains were removed from
the skull and cooled in ice-cold saline for ~ 5 min. For morphometric examination,
2-mm-thick coronal sections were cut using a rat brain matrix. A total of eight
coronal sections were collected, and the sections were stained using a 2% 2, 3,
5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution. The infarct appeared pale white on a
background of red normal brain. The stained brain sections were scanned with the
Scan Jet (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA) flatbed scanner. Determinations of
infarct volume and edema in six groups were blinded. The infarct volume was
calculated using the following formula: infarct volume = (left hemisphere volume–
(the right hemisphere volume–measured infarct volume))/left hemisphere volume.
Brain swelling was determined using the following formula: swelling (edema) = (right
hemisphere volume–left hemisphere volume)/left hemisphere volume. The infarct
volume and brain swelling were expressed as percentages.
Neurological deficits and seizures. Neurological deficits and seizure
activity of each rat were evaluated at 2, 8, 24, 48, 72 h and 1 week after ischemic
injury by an observer who had no knowledge of which procedure had been
performed. Neurological deficits and seizure activities were classified with
Bederson's and Racine's scoring systems.37,38 Seizure activity was classified with
the Racine scale. Mortality was also recorded. Bederson's scoring system: 0, no
observable deficit (normal); 1, forelimb flexion (moderate deficits) ;2, forelimb flexion
plus decreased resistance to lateral push (moderate deficits); 3, unidirectional
circling (severe deficits); 4, unidirectional circling plus decreased level of
consciousness (severe deficits).
Quantitative real-time PCR. To quantify Neogenin transcript levels following
OGD in mouse cortical neurons, total RNA was isolated using a RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Toronto, ON, Canada) as described by the manufacturer. Purified total
RNA (500 ng) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using Superscript II First Strand
Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Pre-designed Taqman probes (Applied BiosystemsLife Technologies, Mississauga, ON, Canada) were used to assess mRNA
expression: Neogenin (Mm00476326_m1) and the reference transcript HPRT1
(Mm01545399_m1). To verify specific amplification of our target gene, negative
controls (cDNA without primers and primers without cDNA) were used. The PCR
amplification was carried out in a 384-well plate using Taqman Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems, Mississauga, ON, Canada) using a final concentration of 10ng of cDNA
generated from total isolated RNA on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems) with the following conditions: an enzyme activation step at
50 °C for 2 min and a 95 °C denaturation step for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at
95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C annealing for 1 min and a 72 °C extension for 30 s. The data
were analyzed using the Applied Biosystems Sequence Detection System (SDS)
software 2.2. The threshold cycle (Ct) values were averaged from three independent
experiments and were normalized to HPRT1 levels and represented as 2 − ΔCt
(ΔCt = Ct(Neogenin)- Ct(HPRT1)).
