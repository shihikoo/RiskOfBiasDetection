SUMMARY
Aim: Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is a major complication of delayed tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) treatment in ischemic stroke. We aimed to explore whether peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst (PDC) could prevent such complication. Methods: Male
Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with
t-PA (10 mg/kg) or t-PA plus FeTMPyP (3 mg/kg, a representative PDC) at MCAO for 2 or
5 h and reperfusion for 22 or 19 h, respectively. HT was assessed with hemoglobin assay.
Neurological deficit was evaluated with Modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS). Peroxynitrite formation was examined by detecting 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) formation. The
expression and activity of MMP-9/MMP-2 were assessed by Western blotting and gelatin
zymography. Results: t-PA treatment at 2 h of MCAO did not induce HT but attenuated
neurological deficit, whereas treatment at 5 h significantly induced HT and worsened the
neurological outcome. Such complications were prevented by FeTMPyP cotreatment. Early
t-PA treatment inhibited 3-NT and MMP-9/MMP-2 expression, whereas delayed treatment
induced 3-NT and MMP-9/MMP-2 expression and activity. FeTMPyP cotreatment downregulated 3-NT and inhibited MMP-9/MMP-2 in both time points. Conclusion: Peroxynitrite
decomposition catalyst could prevent hemorrhagic transformation and improve neurological outcome ischemic rat brains with delayed t-PA treatment via inhibiting peroxynitritemediated MMP activation.

Introduction
Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) remains the only FDAapproved therapy for acute ischemic stroke, with a restrictive
treatment time window of 4.5 h [1–4]. Treatment beyond this
time window significantly increases risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and mortality [5–8], which worsens the patients’ outcome [9]. With the narrow therapeutic window and potential
severe complications, t-PA treatment is only applied for <5%
stroke patients practically [10]. Developing novel adjuvant therapeutic strategy to extend t-PA’s therapeutic time window and

reduce the risk of HT is critical for improving outcome of stroke
treatment.
Activating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a proteolytic
zinc-containing enzyme family, could degrade neurovascular
matrix, disrupt tight junction proteins and induce the BBB
opening and HT in ischemic stroke [11,12]. During thrombolytic treatment, t-PA promotes the expression of MMP-9
[13,14] and the release of MMP-9 from neutrophils, contributing to HT [15]. Inhibition of MMP-9 reduced incidence and
severity of HT in focal ischemic rat model with t-PA treatment
[16,17]. Plasma MMP-9 level becomes a biomarker for predict-

ing the risk of HT in ischemic stroke patients receiving t-PA
treatment [18,19]. Meta-analysis on 22 clinical trials with 3289
patients showed that MMP-9 level was highly correlated with
infarct volume, stroke severity, and functional outcome [20].
MMP-2 activation also contributes to the BBB leakage at the
early stage of cerebral ischemia [21,22] as well as the t-PAmediated HT [23]. MMP-2 knockout mice revealed less BBB
damage and HT than wild-type mice after focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion [24].
After t-PA infusion, recanalization causes cerebral ischemia–
reperfusion injury, producing large amounts of reactive oxygen
and nitrogen species including superoxide, nitric oxide (NO),
and peroxynitrite (ONOO ). Peroxynitrite is derived from the
superoxide and NO, but it is much more active than those precursors [25]. Peroxynitrite exerts strong cytotoxic effects via
inducing protein tyrosine nitration, lipid peroxidation and DNA
damage [26]. Peroxynitrite could activate MMPs and disrupt
tight junctions, leading to damage of neurovascular unit in
ischemic brain [27,28]. Scavenging peroxynitrite with NAC or
peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst FeTMPyP significantly
inhibited MMP-9 activity, reduced infarct volume, and
improved neurological function during cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury [29–33]. Increased nitrosative oxidative stress was
found in ischemic stroke patients [34]. Thus, we raised the
hypothesis that peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst (PDC)
could prevent hemorrhage transformation through inhibiting
peroxynitrite-mediated MMP activation in ischemic brain with
delayed t-PA treatment and subsequently extend therapeutic
window of t-PA.

Materials and Methods

H.-S. Chen et al.

Drug Treatment
We compared the effects of FeTMPyP, a representative PDC, on
HT in the brains receiving t-PA treatment at 2 and 5 h of cerebral ischemia. At 1.5 and 4.5 h of MCAO ischemia, recombinant t-PA (Actilyse, Boehringer Ingelheim, 10 mg/kg) was
injected (10% bonus, 90% continuous infusion for 0.5 h) via
femoral vein according to previously described methods [36].
Accordingly, the time points of t-PA treatment were counted as
2 and 5 h after cerebral ischemia. In parallel experiments, same
volume of saline was used as control. Right after t-PA injection, the suture was immediately removed to induce reperfusion. With t-PA treatment at 2 and 5 h, we designed the
reperfusion period for 22 and 19 h, respectively, to keep consistent timeframe to 24 h of ischemia–reperfusion. To investigate the effects of PDC on preventing t-PA-induced HT,
FeTMPyP (3 mg/kg, Cayman, 75854) was given via femoral
vein just before t-PA treatment. We chose the dosage of 3 mg/
kg FeTMPyP for this study which was based previous reports
by us and others [32,33,37].

Hemoglobin Assay
Hemoglobin assay was used to examine the severity of hemorrhage as previously reported [38]. Briefly, rats were transcardially
perfused with cold PBS and hemispheres were homogenized with
cold PBS. The homogenized samples were collected and centrifuged at 15 000 g for 15 min. Supernatants were collected and
the level of hemoglobin was detected using QuantiChrom hemoglobin assay kit (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA, USA) according
to the manufacture’s protocol. O.D. value at 400 nm was detected
with a microplate reader.

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) Model
Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 260–290 g were
obtained from Laboratory Animal Unit, The University of Hong
Kong. All animal experiment protocols were approved and regulated by the Committee on the Use of Live Animal in Teaching and Research. Rats were randomly divided into the
following groups: sham control, 2 h of MCAO plus 22 h of reperfusion (M2/R22), 5 h of MCAO plus 19 h of reperfusion
(M5/R19), M2/R22 plus t-PA, M5/R19 plus t-PA, M2/R22 plus
t-PA and FeTMPyP, M5/R19 plus t-PA and FeTMPyP. Cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion MCAO model was conducted as we previously described [35]. Briefly, MCAO rats were anesthetized
with 4% isofluorane and maintained with 2% isofluorane via
inhalation. A silicon-coated suture (diameter 0.38 mm) was
inserted from the external carotid artery (ECA) into the internal carotid artery (ICA). Sham control rats were subjected to
similar surgical operation without occlusion. At designed time
window of MCAO ischemia, the suture was removed to induce
reperfusion. During the operation, rats were kept on warming
pats until recovered from anesthesia. Success of MCAO was
confirmed by TTC staining of a 1-mm-thick coronal slice that is
6 mm away from the frontal tip. Brains without infarction
should be excluded for study. All MCAO models were successful and included in this study.

Western Blot Analysis
After homogenization, brain samples were collected and proteins
were extracted with RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA). Proteins were determined by Branford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), loaded for electrophoresis, and
transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). After blocking, the membranes were incubated
with diluted primary antibodies including anti-MMP-9 (Merck,
IM72), anti-MMP-2 (Merck, IM33), anti-3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT,
Abcam, ab61392), and anti-GAPDH (Millipore, abs16) overnight at
4°C and followed by incubating secondary antibody at room temperature for 2 h. After washed with TBST buffer, signal was detected
using ECL advance Western blotting detection reagents (BD biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).

Gelatin Zymography
MMP activity was measured using gelatin zymography protocol as
previously described with minor modifications [28]. Briefly, the
same amount of total proteins was eletrophoresised in 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gel containing 1 mg/mL gelatin. After electrophoresis, gels were collected and washed with 2.5% Triton-100 for
1 h and then incubated with developing buffer at 37°C for 48 h.

Peroxynitrite & hemorrhagic transformation

After stained with Coomassie blue, the gels were washed with
ddH2O until clear bands appeared.

Neurological Deficit Measurement
Modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS) test was adopted
to evaluate the animal neurological deficit according to previous publication [39]. Neurological function was graded on a
series of scales from 0 to 18 (normal score, 0; maximal deficit
score, 18). The mNSS includes motor, sensory, reflex, and balance tests. Tests were carried out by an investigator who was
blinded to the experiments.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 18.0 statistical programs (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). For multiple groups designed
experiments, comparisons were made by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and followed by least significant difference test
for two-group comparison within the multiple groups. Significance levels were set at P < 0.05. Data were presented as
means  SEM.

Results
PDC Treatment Abolished Hemorrhagic
Transformation in Ischemia-reperfused Brains
with t-PA Infusion at 5 h
We first investigated the different effects of early and delayed t-PA
treatments on HT in ischemic brains. T-PA was intravenously
injected into the rats at 2 and 5 h of cerebral ischemia, and then,
the brain samples were collected at the time points of 22 and 19 h
of reperfusion, respectively, for accessing HT. Early t-PA infusion
(10 mg/kg) at 2 h did not induce HT, whereas delayed treatment
at 5 h resulted in HT in the MCAO ischemic brains (Figure 1A and
B). Hemoglobin assay confirmed that HT only occurred in the
ischemic brain with t-PA treatment at 5 h. (Figure 1C and D).
Notably, cotreatment of FeTMPyP (3 mg/kg, a representative
PDC) abolished delayed t-PA-induced HT in the ischemic brains.
Those results indicate that PDC could prevent HT in ischemic
brains with delayed t-PA treatment.

We then investigated the mNSS scores for neurological functions. Interestingly, t-PA treatment at 2 h remarkably improved
neurological functions whereas at 5 h worsened the neurological outcome in the MCAO ischemia-reperfused rats, indicating

neurological deficiency in the MCAO rats with t-PA treatment
at 5 h but also had better neurological functions than the
MCAO ischemic rats with saline treatment as control (Figure 2B), indicating that PDC treatment could improve the
recovery of neurological functions in cerebral ischemia-reperfused rats with delayed t-PA treatment.

PDC Treatment Downregulated 3-NT Expression
and Inhibited MMP-9/MMP-2 Expression/activity
in Ischemic Brains with Delayed t-PA Infusion at
5h
We finally investigated whether the underlying mechanisms of tPA’s opposite effects and the protective effect of PDC are related to
peroxynitrite and MMP activation in the ischemic brains. As
showed in Figure 3, t-PA treatment at 2 h remarkably downregulated the formation of 3-NT, a peroxynitrite biomarker, whereas
the treatment at 5 h upregulated 3-NT level in the MCAO
ischemic brains, indicating that delayed t-PA treatment could promote peroxynitrite production. Cotreatment of FeTMPyP (3 mg/
kg) significantly inhibited the expression of 3-NT in the ischemic
brains with t-PA treatment at both 2 and 5 h.
Meanwhile, t-PA treatment at 2 hours significantly downregulated the expression of MMP-9/MMP-2 in the ischemic brains,
while treatment at 5 h significantly upregulated the expression of
MMP-9/MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity (Figure 4). Cotreatment of
FeTMPyP significantly downregulated the expression of MMP-9/
MMP-2 and inhibited MMP-9 activity in the ischemic brains with t-PA
treatments at both 2 and 5 h after cerebral ischemia. Those results indicate that early t-PA treatment could reduce the production of peroxynitrite and the expression of MMPs, while delayed t-PA treatment could
exacerbate peroxynitrite production and the expression and activity of
MMPs in ischemic rat brains, and PDC treatment could inhibit 3-NT
formation and the expression and activity of MMPs in the ischemic
brain with delayed t-PA treatment.

Discussion
This is the first report that PDC could prevent hemorrhagic
transformation and promote neurological functions after cerebral ischemia with delayed t-PA treatment. PDC has the potentials to be an adjunct therapy to expend t-PA’s therapeutic
time window and prevent hemorrhagic transformation in poststroke treatment.
MMPs play critical roles in inducing the BBB disruption and HT
during cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury [16–19,23]. PDC
could prevent MMP activation and neurovascular injury in rat
brains after prolonged cerebral ischemia [32,40,41]. Therefore, we
tested the hypothesis that PDC could be effective to reduce HT
through inhibiting peroxynitrite-mediated MMP activation in
ischemic brains with delayed t-PA treatment. HT was only presented in the rats with t-PA treatment at 5 h rather than that with

t-PA treatment at 2 h of MCAO cerebral ischemia–reperfusion.
Furthermore, early t-PA treatment at 2 h of MCAO cerebral ischemia improved neurological function scores, whereas delayed t-PA
treatment at 5 h worsened the therapeutic outcomes. These
results are consistent with previous reports [42–44]. Interestingly,
early t-PA treatment at 2 h significantly reduced 3-NT formation,
while delayed t-PA treatment at 5 h oppositely induced 3-NT formation, indicating that early recanalization could reduce the formation of peroxynitrite in the ischemic brains. Cotreatment of
FeTMPyP prevented HT and improved neurological function in
the rats with t-PA treatment at 5 h of MCAO cerebral ischemia
following 19 h of reperfusion. Those results indicate that peroxynitrite plays an important role in HT and neurological deficiency
in ischemia-reperfused brains with delayed t-PA treatment. In line
with those results, early and delayed t-PA treatments had opposite
effects on MMP-9/MMP-2 expression and MMP-9 activity in the
ischemic brains. Cotreatment of FeTMPyP revealed to inhibit the
expression of MMP-9/MMP-2 and the activity of MMP-9 at both
early and delayed t-PA treatments. Those results suggest that peroxynitrite-mediated MMP activation could be the underlying
mechanism of HT in ischemia-reperfused rat brains with delayed
t-PA treatment.
It is notable that only 3 mg/kg PDC was used in the study. We
designed the dosage according to our previous study that PDC
treatment at 3 mg/kg significantly attenuated infarction volume
and reduced apoptotic cell death in MCAO rat model of cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion injury [37]. Current study aimed to further
explore the potentials of using PDC as an adjunct therapy with tPA to prevent HT and promote therapeutic outcome. Practically,
we should further explore the dose-dependent responses to the
PDC treatment in protecting blood–brain barrier and attenuating
HT during thrombolytic treatment for saving ischemic brain tissues as a potential therapeutic drug in future.
Taken together, we conclude that PDC could prevent hemorrhagic transformation and improve neurological outcome during
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury with delayed t-PA treatment
via inhibiting peroxynitrite-mediated MMP activation. Targeting
peroxynitrite formation could be a potential adjuvant therapeutic
strategy to reduce t-PA-mediated hemorrhage complication and
potentially extend the current narrow treatment time window.
