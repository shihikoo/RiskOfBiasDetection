BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Ischaemic stroke is a serious disease with limited therapy options. Glycoprotein (GP)Ib binding to von Willebrand factor (vWF)
exposed at vascular injury initiates platelet adhesion and contributes to platelet aggregation. GPIb has been suggested as an
effective target for antithrombotic therapy in stroke. Anfibatide is a GPIb antagonist derived from snake venom and we
investigated its protective effect on experimental brain ischaemia in mice.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
Focal cerebral ischaemia was induced by 90 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). These mice were then
treated with anfibatide (4, 2, 1 μg·kg−1), injected i.v., after 90 min of MCAO, followed by 1 h of reperfusion. Tirofiban, a
GPIIb/IIIα antagonist, was used as a positive control.

KEY RESULTS
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, anfibatide-treated mice showed significantly improved ischaemic lesions in a dose-dependent
manner. The mice had smaller infarct volumes, less severe neurological deficits and histopathology of cerebrum tissues
compared with the untreated MCAO mice. Moreover, anfibatide decreased the amount of GPIbα, vWF and accumulation of
fibrin(ogen) in the vasculature of the ischaemic hemisphere. Tirofiban had similar effects on infarct size and fibrin(ogen)
deposition compared with the MCAO group. Importantly, the anfibatide-treated mice showed a lower incidence of
intracerebral haemorrhage and shorter tail bleeding time compared with the tirofiban-treated mice.

Introduction
Ischaemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability.
Approximately 80% of strokes are caused by focal cerebral
ischaemia due to arterial occlusion. A key cause of cerebral
ischaemia is platelet-derived thrombus formation at the site
of the damaged endothelium. Thromboembolic occlusion of
major or multiple smaller intracerebral arteries leads to focal
impairment of the downstream blood flow, and to secondary
thrombus formation within the cerebral microvasculature
(Stoll et al., 2008). Antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapies have been demonstrated to be effective in patients with
acute stroke. Thrombolytic therapy re-establishes tissue perfusion in order to reduce neurological deficits and improve
functional outcome. However, less than 10% of patients
qualify for this treatment due to the limited time window,
3.0–4.5 h after symptom onset, and the risk of severe intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) with later treatments (Adams
et al., 2003; Hacke et al., 2008; Fisher, 2011).
Because platelet adhesion is the initial step in the pathogenesis of thrombosis, the use of platelet adhesion inhibitors
may be a useful therapeutic intervention to effectively
prevent the formation of blood clots. The treatment strategy,
which inhibits platelet activation by blocking platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIα to prevent platelet aggregation has been used for many years, but excessive GPIIb/IIIα
blockade is inevitably associated with major bleeding complications in mice and reflects similar findings in acute stroke
patients, so it cannot be recommended at present (Adams
et al., 2008; Stoll et al., 2008; Kellert et al., 2013). A more
effective treatment may include targeting platelet adhesion
and upstream signalling pathways.
The initial step for attracting platelets to sites of vascular
injury is mediated by GPIb-V-IX, a structural receptor

complex exclusively expressed in platelets and megakaryocytes. The GPIb-V-IX complex is formed by four distinct
transmembrane proteins: GPIbα, GPIbβ, GPV and GPIX.
GPIbα is the major ligand-binding subunit of the GP
complex, which binds von Willebrand factor (vWF), and initiates platelet adhesion in haemostasis and thrombosis
(Berndt and Andrews, 2002; Andrews and Berndt, 2004;
Varga-Szabo et al., 2008; Mu et al., 2010). GPIbα is required
for platelet adhesion under conditions of high shear such as
in the cerebrovascular arterial system. Inhibition of GPIb
with Fab fragments of the monoclonal antibody p0p/B
blocked platelet adhesion and aggregation in a model of
mechanically induced thrombosis formation as well as in
ischaemic stroke (Kleinschnitz et al., 2007).
GPIb has long been suggested as an effective target for
inhibition of platelet adhesion in antithrombotic therapy
(Stoll et al., 2008; 2010), but anti-GPIb agent for therapy has
shortly been developed. Anfibatide (trade name of agkisacucetin) is a GPIb antagonist, a C-type lectin-like protein
derived from the protein complex agglucetin. It has a typical
snaclec structure of a heterodimer with two closely related
subunits: α and β chains (Lei et al., 2014). Earlier study has
demonstrated that each anfibatide αβ-heterodimer molecule
binds to one GPIbα molecule and inhibits GPIbα–vWF interaction by blocking the access of vWF to GPIbα without
causing GPIb clustering (Gao et al., 2012). In this study, we
examined the protective effect of a GPIb antagonist on
experimental stroke using anfibatide, administered i.v. after
90 min of cerebral ischaemia followed by 1 h reperfusion in
mice. Together with previous findings (Kleinschnitz et al.,
2007), our study suggests that blockade of the GPIb signalling
pathway, a key event required for platelet adhesion and
thrombus formation, may provide a promising treatment
strategy for ischaemic stroke.

Methods
Experimental animals
Pharmacological experiments were performed using healthy
Kunming mice (6- to 8-week-old male mice at 26–28 g body
weight, SPF) purchased from the Animal Centre Laboratory
(Anhui Medical University, China). Mice were housed at 22°C
with a relative humidity of 60 ± 5% and on a 12 h light/dark
cycle, with free access to food and water and were allowed at
least 3 days to acclimatize before experimentation. The total
number of mice used in our experiments was 336. All mice
were separated into a sham-operated group and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group. The latter was further
randomly separated into a MCAO-only group, anfibatide (4,
2, 1 μg·kg−1) and tirofiban (0.5 mg·kg−1) groups. All experimental protocols described in this study were approved by
the regulations stipulated by Anhui Medical University
Animal Care Committee following the protocol outlined in
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All
studies involving animals are reported in accordance with the
ARRIVE guidelines for reporting experiments involving
animals (Kilkenny et al., 2010; McGrath et al., 2010).

MCAO model
The MCAO model was used to induce focal cerebral ischaemia (Clark et al., 1997). Mice were anaesthetized with chloral
hydrate (0.35 g·kg−1) by i.p. injection. Transient right MCAO
was induced by inserting a nylon thread with standardized
diameter (0.148–0.165 mm) to an appropriate depth
(9–11 mm) determined by the animal’s body weight. The tip
of the nylon thread was rounded by paraffin to block the
origin of the middle cerebral artery. After 90 min, the occluding nylon thread was removed to allow reperfusion. The body
temperature was maintained at 37°C throughout surgery.
Sham-operated mice underwent the same surgical procedure
except that their origin of the middle cerebral artery was not
occluded. All animals were operated on by the same person in
the same conditions to reduce infarct variability, and operation time per animal did not exceed 15 min.
Immediately following MCAO, mice were randomly
divided into MCAO-only group, anfibatide (4, 2, 1 μg·kg−1)
and tirofiban (0.5 mg·kg−1) treatment groups. The shamoperated and MCAO-only groups received saline injections.
The anfibatide and tirofiban groups were treated with the
respective drugs, injected i.v., after 90 min of cerebral ischaemia followed by 1 h reperfusion. After recovery from anaesthesia and again after 24 h of reperfusion, global neurological
status and coordination were evaluated according to the
method of Bederson score and foot fault test.

Platelet counts
Mice, not subjected to MCAO, were randomly assigned to five
groups including control group, anfibatide (1, 2, 4 μg·kg−1)
and tirofiban (0.5 mg·kg−1) groups. Mice received drugs or
normal saline by i.v. injection. One hour later, mice were
anaesthetized with chloral hydrate (0.35 g·kg−1, i.p. injection), and blood was collected via a retro-orbital puncture to
measure platelet counts (De Meyer et al., 2011; Sharma et al.,
2014). A sterile capillary pipette was cut to appropriate
length, and the cut ends were ground to have flat edges. The
3906

eyelid was gently pulled back from the eyeball. The capillary
pipette was placed at the lateral canthus and was oriented
towards the back of the head at an angle of 45° to the sagittal
and coronal planes. It was gently turned with pressure against
the orbital bone just in front of the zygomatic arch until
blood flowed from capillaries that drained the orbital sinus
into the superficial temporal vein. The capillary pipette was
pulled back and blood was collected into EDTA-K2-containing
collection tube by capillary action. Care was taken to ensure
adequate haemostasis following the procedure. Platelet
counts in whole blood were determined using a Sysmex
pocH-100iV Diff Hematology analyser (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan).

Measurement of cerebral infarct volumes
Cerebral infarct volumes were evaluated at 24 h after reperfusion in mice subjected to 90 min of MCAO. Mice were decapitated and the brains were rapidly removed. Five serial sections
from each brain were cut at 2 mm intervals. To measure
ischaemic volumes, brain slices were stained in 2% 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) (Sigma T8877, St. Louis,
MO, USA) solution and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. TTCstained brain slices were transferred to 10% neutral-buffered
formaldehyde. Areas of infarction were visualized as regions
lacking the typical brick red staining of normal brain tissue.
These areas were photographed and quantified with ImageJ
image processing software (US National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) (Suzuki et al., 2012; Espinera
et al., 2013).

Bederson score measurement
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, neurological deficits of mice
were assessed and scored in a blinded fashion using a modification of the Bederson neurological scale (Bederson et al.,
1986; Kawano et al., 2006; Abe et al., 2009). Neurological
scores were recorded as follows: 0, no neurological deficit; 1,
failure to fully extend left forepaw or flexion of torso and
contralateral forelimb when mouse was lifted by the tail; 2,
reduced resistance to lateral push or circling to the contralateral side when mouse was held by the tail on a flat surface,
but normal posture at rest; 3, spontaneous circling to left; 4,
absence of spontaneous movement or unconsciousness.

Foot fault test
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, mice were tested for placement dysfunctions of forelimbs with the modified foot fault
test (Hernandez and Schallert, 1988; Liu et al., 2013). They
were placed on an elevated grid floor, with 1.5 × 1.5 cm
diameter openings. The total number of steps used to cross
the grid and the total numbers of foot faults for each forelimb
were recorded. The percentages of foot faults to the total
number of steps were calculated.

Histopathological and immunohistochemical
staining of cerebral tissues
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, all mice were anaesthetized
with chloral hydrate (0.35 g·kg−1), and perfused with ice-cold
saline and 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and
fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered formalin (pH 7.1) for 72 h
before being dehydrated, embedded in paraffin and serially
sectioned (4 μm) with a cryostat slicer. For conventional mor-

phological evaluation, the paraffin-embedded sections were
deparaffinized, hydrated, washed and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E).
For fibrin(ogen) detection, the paraffin-embedded brain
coronal sections were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated,
heated in 0.01 M sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and cooled in
deionized water. Sections were immersed in methanol containing 3% H2O2 at 37°C for 30 min to quench endogenous
peroxidase, then incubated with polyclonal goat antifibrinogen β antibody (Santa Cruz, 1:100; Santa Cruz, CA,
USA) overnight at 4°C, then washed with PBS, and incubated
with polymer helper at 37°C for 20 min, followed by poly
peroxidase-anti-goat IgG at 37°C for 25 min, and visualized
using diaminobenzidine method. Immunoreactive vessels
were stained brown and images were captured under the
microscope.

Protein extraction and Western blot
for fibrin(ogen)
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, mice were killed and the
brains were removed. The cortices of ipsilateral hemispheres
were homogenized in RIPA buffer using tissue grinder on ice
for 30 min. Then, tissue lysates were centrifuged at 10 000× g
for 15 min at 4°C and the total protein concentrations were
assessed with BCA protein assay kit. The total supernatants
were treated with SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer at 100°C
for 10 min. Thirty micrograms of total protein was electrophoresed and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Then the
membranes were incubated in blocking buffer [5% non-fat
dried milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1%
Tween (TBS-T)] for 2 h to reduce non-specific binding. The
membranes were incubated with the primary antibody [goat
anti-fibrin(ogen) β, 1:300 in TBS-T; mouse monoclonal antiactin, 1:1000 in TBS-T] at 4°C overnight, washed with TBS-T,
incubated for 2 h with HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG
[for fibrin(ogen), 1: 6000] or rabbit anti-mouse IgG (for actin,
1:10 000) and were detected using ECL plus (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Blot bands were quantified
using the densitometry method (ImageJ).

Immunofluorescence staining
To detect the expression of vWF and GPIbα in the ischaemic
cerebral microvessels, double immunofluorescent staining
was performed. Twenty-four hours after MCAO, mice were
anaesthetized with chloral hydrate (0.35 g·kg−1) and transcardially perfused with ice-cold saline and 4% paraformaldehyde.
Brains were removed and then post-fixed for 24 h in the same
fixative. The post-fixed brain tissues were cryoprotected in
20% then 30% sucrose in PBS. Brains were serially sectioned
(10 μm). The brain cryosections were air dried, rinsed in PBS
and incubated with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min. After nonspecific blocking in normal donkey sera, sections were incubated overnight at 4°C in the following primary antibodies:
monoclonal mouse anti-vWF (Santa Cruz, 1:100), polyclonal
goat anti-platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1
(PECAM-1) (Santa Cruz, 1:100) and polyclonal rabbit antiGPIbα (Biorbyt, 1:100, Cambridge, UK). Sections were incubated with the appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated
secondary antisera [donkey anti-mouse IgG-PE (Santa Cruz),
donkey anti-goat IgG-FITC (Santa Cruz), donkey anti-rabbit

BJP

IgG-PE (Santa Cruz)] used at 1:100 dilutions for 1 h. From this
point forward, sections were protected from light. Sections
were counterstained with DAPI (Beyotime, 1:400, Shanghai,
China) and coverslipped with anti-fading mounting medium.
Negative controls were conducted by staining sections as
described earlier, but with the use of PBS instead of the primary
antibodies, no detectable labelling was observed. Immunofluorescence images were captured using a Laser scanning
confocal microscope (Leica, Frankfurt, Germany). The mean
densities of vWF and GPIbα were used to quantify their
expressions by the Image-Pro plus 6.0 analysis system (Media
Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA), in corresponding sections of five mice in each group.

Spectrophotometric assay of ICH
Cerebral haemorrhage was quantified by using a spectrophotometric assay for haemoglobin (Sumii et al., 2002; Zhao
et al., 2004). A standard curve was generated by blending
normal brain samples with different volumes of mouse blood.
Incremental volumes of homologous blood (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8,
16, 32, 50, 100, 200 μL) were added to each hemispheric
sample with PBS to reach the volume of 3 mL, followed by
homogenization for 30 s, sonication for 1 min and centrifugation at 10 000× g for 30 min. Drabkin’s reagent (240 μL,
Sigma) was added to 60 μL of aliquots and allowed to stand
for 15 min. Optical density was measured at 540 nm with a
spectrophotometer (SpectraMax 190, Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). A linear relationship between
haemoglobin concentrations in perfused brain and blood
volume was yielded. Twenty-four hours after MCAO, haemorrhage volume was expressed in equivalent units by comparison with a reference curve generated as above.
The occurrence of ICH was assessed on five coronal brain
slices before and after TTC staining in mice. Images of TTCstained sections were captured and analysed using ImageJ.

Assessment of tail vein bleeding time
Tail bleeding time was determined in mice that were not
subjected to stroke (Sugidachi et al., 2000; Lei et al., 2014).
Mice were randomly assigned to five groups including control
group, anfibatide (1, 2, 4 μg·kg−1) and tirofiban (0.5 mg·kg−1)
groups. Drugs were i.v. administered 30 min before the tail
transection. Under anaesthesia with chloral hydrate
(0.35 g·kg−1, i.p. injection), a 3 mm segment of the tail tip was
amputated and the tail was immersed into saline (37°C) to
bleed. Time was recorded from the moment blood was
observed to emerge from the wound until cessation of blood
flow.
We also assessed the bleeding time at 24 h after MCAO.
Following MCAO, mice were randomly divided into a control
MCAO group, anfibatide (1, 2, 4 μg·kg−1) and tirofiban
(0.5 mg·kg−1) groups. Sham and MCAO groups received saline
injections. After 24 h of reperfusion, bleeding time was evaluated according to the method described earlier.

Results
Effect of ANF on platelet counts in mice
Platelet counts were measured to study whether anfibatide
would cause thrombocytopenia in mice without stroke. The
results (see Supporting Information Fig. S1) showed that
platelet counts in anfibatide-treated and tirofiban-treated
mice were not statistically different from control mice (P >
0.05). Injection of anfibatide did not alter platelet counts,
which did not cause thrombocytopenia.

Effect of anfibatide on cerebral infarct
volumes in MCAO mice
Effect of anfibatide on cerebral infarct volumes was assayed at
24 h after MCAO. Infarct volumes of the brain were significantly reduced in anfibatide groups compared with the
MCAO group (Figure 1A,B). Anfibatide (4, 2, 1 μg·kg−1) significantly diminished the infarct size compared with the MCAO
only group (P < 0.01, n = 8). Tirofiban (0.5 mg·kg−1) had
similar effect on the infarct volumes compared with the
MCAO group (P < 0.01).

hemispheres of mice in each group at 24 h after MCAO. Scale bar: 100 μm (left); 50 μm (right). Blue arrows indicated vacuolar degeneration and
irregular, pyknotic and hyperchromatic nuclei.

Effect of ANF on brain functional outcomes
in MCAO mice
The modified Bederson score that assesses neurological function and the foot fault test that measures motor function and
coordination were used to study the effects of anfibatide on
functional outcomes in MCAO mice. The MCAO group
showed remarkable differences in functional outcomes compared with the sham group (Figure 1C,D). Anfibatide
(4 μg·kg−1) mice showed significant improvement in neurological functions compared with the MCAO group (Bederson
score, 1.25 ± 0.16 vs. 3.0 ± 0.16, P < 0.01; foot fault test, 8.14
± 2.21 vs. 23.0 ± 2.16, P < 0.01). Although the tirofiban
(0.5 mg·kg−1) mice tended to develop less severe neurological
deficits compared with the MCAO group, there was no statistical difference between the two groups in the Bederson
score or the foot fault test.

Effect of ANF on histopathology of brain
tissues in MCAO mice
H&E-stained sections showed great morphological differences in lesion development between sham and MCAO mice
(Figure 2). Sham mice revealed normal structure neuron
cells with clear edge, nuclei and intercellular substance
stained evenly. Cerebral tissue in the MCAO mice showed
vacuolar necrosis, enlarged interspaces, intercellular oedema
and ill-defined cells. The nuclei displayed irregular, pyknotic
and hyperchromatic changes. Treatment with anfibatide
(2 μg·kg−1) attenuated brain damage to varying degrees,
including the reduction of neuronal necrosis and intercellular
oedema. tirofiban (0.5 mg·kg−1) could also decrease cerebral
ischaemia damage. However, haemorrhage in the ischaemic
hemispheres could be seen in some of the anti-GPIIb/IIIαtreated mice.

Effect of anfibatide on the accumulation of
fibrin(ogen) in MCAO mice
Effect of anfibatide on the accumulation of fibrin(ogen) was
assayed via immunohistochemistry and Western blot in the
ischaemic hemispheres. The results (Figure 3) showed a clear

increase of fibrin(ogen) expression in MCAO group compared
with the sham group (P < 0.01), whereas anfibatide (4, 2,
1 μg·kg−1) treatment significantly decreased the deposition
compared with the MCAO group. Tirofiban (0.5 mg·kg−1) also
inhibited the fibrin(ogen) expression compared with the
MCAO group (P < 0.05).

Effect of anfibatide on the abundance of
GPIbα and vWF in MCAO mice
The expressions of GPIbα and vWF after cerebral ischaemia
were observed by double labelling immunofluorescent staining. As shown in Figure 4 (GPIbα) and Figure 5 (vWF), vasculature that was positive for immunofluorescence of GPIbα
and vWF was rarely found in sham group. However, much of
the vasculature was positive for immunofluorescence of
GPIbα and vWF in the ischaemic hemispheres in MCAO
mice. Anfibatide (4, 2 μg·kg−1) treatment significantly reduced
the abundance of GPIbα (P < 0.01) and vWF (P < 0.01) compared with the model group. Tirofiban (0.5 mg·kg−1) treatment showed no difference in expressions of GPIbα and vWF
compared with the MCAO group (P > 0.05).

Effect of anfibatide on the risk of ICH in
MCAO mice
Impacts of anfibatide on intracerebral bleeding after MCAO
were analysed. Measurement of whole blood by spectrophotometric assay showed a linear relationship between volume
of added blood and the haemoglobin absorbance. Results
showed that there was no difference in haemorrhage volumes
between the sham group and the MCAO group (Figure 6A,B).
Treatment with anfibatide 4 μg·kg−1 and tirofiban 0.5 mg·kg−1
significantly increased haemorrhage volumes compared with
the MCAO group. However, the increase in haemorrhage
volumes induced by anfibatide was almost 50% less pronounced than tirofiban treatment (P < 0.01). Moreover
(Figure 6C,D), a high incidence of ICH was observed in
tirofiban (0.5 mg·kg−1) group (P < 0.05). In contrast, only one
animal from all of the anfibatide treatment (4, 2, 1 μg·kg−1)
groups showed ICH (P > 0.05).

Effect of anfibatide on haemostasis (tail vein
bleeding time) in mice
Tail bleeding time was measured to determine antihaemostatic effect of anfibatide in mice not subjected to
MCAO (Figure 7A). The bleeding time averaged 159.5 ± 18.3 s
in saline group. Anfibatide (4 μg·kg−1, 311.5 ± 17.6 s) and
tirofiban (0.5 mg·kg−1, 485.7 ± 23.9 s) could significantly
increase the bleeding time compared with the control mice (P
< 0.01). Anfibatide prolonged bleeding time in a dose-related
manner. Meanwhile, anfibatide (4, 2, 1 μg·kg−1) led to shorter
bleeding time than the tirofiban group (P < 0.01).
Tail bleeding time was also examined to study the effect of
anfibatide on haemostasis in MCAO mice. Results showed
(Figure 7B) that bleeding time of MCAO mice (45.7 ± 6.6 s)
decreased significantly compared with the sham mice (183.3
± 12.4 s, P < 0.01). Anfibatide (4, 2 μg·kg−1) could significantly
increase the bleeding time compared with the MCAO mice
(P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Meanwhile, tirofiban (0.5 mg·kg−1) also
prolonged the bleeding time compared with the MCAO mice
(P < 0.01), and led to longer bleeding time than the anfibatide
group (4, 2, 1 μg·kg−1, P < 0.01).

Discussion
Anfibatide is a C-type lectin-like protein derived from a
snaclec purified from the venom of the Agkistrodon acutus
snake. Studies have demonstrated that anfibatide is a potent
antithrombotic agent (Lei et al., 2014). In the present study,
we evaluated the effect of this novel GPIb antagonist in
protection from ischaemic stroke and reperfusion injury.
Results showed that blockade of GPIb with anfibatide was
protective against the neuronal damage and pathological
deterioration induced by 90 min of MCAO. Moreover, anfibatide treatment also decreased the amount of GPIbα and

vWF and the accumulation of fibrin(ogen) in the vasculature
of the ischaemic hemispheres in MCAO mice. It confirmed
previous reports that GPIb blockade is protective in the
setting of ischaemic stroke (Kleinschnitz et al., 2007; Stoll
et al., 2008; 2010). It also provided the first experimental
evidence that GPIb blockade via anfibatide might be an alternative to the use of antibody derivatives (Kleinschnitz et al.,
2007; Momi et al., 2013).
Thrombus formation is of paramount importance in the
pathophysiology of acute ischaemic stroke and reperfusion
injury. Platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of vessel
injury are crucial in post-traumatic loss of blood and play a
central role in acute ischaemic stroke (Del Zoppo and
Mabuchi, 2003). GPIb antagonists are currently considered
powerful inhibitors of platelet function as a disruptor of the
initial stages of platelet adhesion, but anti-GPIb therapy has
not yet been developed. GPIb inhibition in our study significantly reduced stroke infarct volumes and improved neurological function even when anfibatide was injected with a
delay of 1 h after 90 min of MCAO. This underlines the
functional significance of this therapeutic approach and indicates its role in the microthrombus formation during cerebral
ischaemia reperfusion injury.
GPIbα is the major platelet membrane GP expressed in
platelets and megakaryocytes. After vascular injury, platelets
adhere to the exposed subendothelium through GPIb–vWF
interaction, which contributes to platelet activation and
aggregation. The central role of GPIbα in thrombus formation was confirmed in a study showing that platelet tethering
was virtually absent in vessels of IL-4 receptor α/GPIbα-tg
mice (lacking the extracellular domain of GPIbα) and there
was no thrombus formation within the microvasculature
(Bergmeier et al., 2008). Plenty of evidence showed that inhibition of early platelet adhesion by blockade of GPIb could
protect animals from ischaemic stroke (Stoll et al., 2008;
2010; De Meyer et al., 2010; 2011). Clinical studies also found

increased platelet GPIb receptor number, enhanced platelet
adhesion and severe cerebral ischaemia in a patient (Toth
et al., 2009), and proved that platelet GPIba Kozak polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of ischaemic
stroke (Baker et al., 2001). The specific requirement for GPIbα
for platelet adhesion and aggregation makes this receptor a
potential target for pharmacological inhibition of pathological thrombus formation in related diseases. Blockade of platelet adhesion by anti-GPIb therapy could result in the
prevention of cerebral infarction and increased patency of
the microcirculation during cerebral ischaemia (Kleinschnitz
et al., 2007; Pham et al., 2011; Momi et al., 2013).
It has to be noted that anfibatide-treated and tirofibantreated mice were observed to have almost no change in
platelet counts. We believe that this is unlikely to cause
thrombocytopenia. In agreement with previous reports

(Gruner et al., 2003; Kleinschnitz et al., 2007), antibodymediated blockade of the GPIbα receptor and GPIIb/IIIα
receptor had no significant effect on peripheral platelet
counts.
GPIb can bind different counter receptors on endothelial
cells, platelets and neutrophils such as vWF, Mac-1 or
P-selectin. But which of these engagements is of particular
relevance for stroke development is not clear (Varga-Szabo
et al., 2008). vWF is the principal ligand of GPIb and a wellknown marker of endothelial activation. Within the ischaemic brain vasculature after MCAO, activated or damaged
endothelium stimulate endothelial vWF secretion, the result
of this release is activation of platelet adhesion that further
amplifies platelet secretion, which produces elevated levels of
the vWF expressed on the endothelium and in plasma
(Montoro-García et al., 2014). At the site of a wound, where

the high shear force activates the vWF (through the A3
domain) bound to collagen by stretching vWF multimers into
their filamentous form, then the adhesion is promoted by the
interaction of the A1 domain of vWF with GPIbα on the
platelet membrane (Ruggeri, 2001). Increased platelet aggregation and pathological thrombus formation strongly rely on
endothelial vWF accumulation and plasma vWF adhesion
(Westein et al., 2013).
vWF-mediated platelet adhesion to injured vessels is
essential for arterial thrombosis. It is also considered as an
emerging target in cerebral ischaemia (Varga-Szabo et al.,
2008; De Meyer et al., 2012). Investigations of independent
case–control studies indicated the association between
high vWF levels and the occurrence of a first ischaemic stroke
and mortality in humans (Van Schie et al., 2010). Protection
of vWF-deficient mice from ischaemic stroke injury
(Kleinschnitz et al., 2009), together with enlarged infarct size
in ADAMTS13-deficient mice (Fujioka et al., 2010; Khan et al.,
3912

British Journal of Pharmacology (2015) 172 3904–3916

2012), suggests an important role of vWF in ischaemic stroke.
Besides its role in thrombus formation, mechanisms such as
increased vWF activity could contribute to the risk of stroke
as well.
Our results showed that the abundance of GPIbα and vWF
in the vasculature of infarcted hemispheres was much higher
in MCAO mice than sham mice. This increased immunoreactive GPIbα and vWF in the endothelium was significantly
correlated with the degree of thrombus formation. Anfibatide
could considerably reduce the increased GPIbα and vWF
depositions in the ischaemic hemispheres, whereas tirofiban
(0.5 mg·kg−1) showed no effect on vWF and GPIbα abundance. Anfibatide therapy was associated with decreased vWF
and GPIbα elaboration and deposition, which led to the
reduced thrombus formation. Anfibatide exerts its antithrombotic activity by acting as a GPIbα antagonist, blocking
GPIbα–vWF mediated primary platelet adhesion and aggregation. Along with other previous studies, our research

showed that binding of GPIb to vWF was a mandatory step in
ischaemic stroke, suggesting the central role of GPIb for platelet adhesion and stroke formation (Stoll et al., 2008; 2010).
That is not the case for vWF–GPIIb/IIIα interaction, which is

consistent with the failure of GPIIb/IIIα blockade in protecting experimental and clinical stroke (Kleinschnitz et al., 2007;
Adams et al., 2008; Kellert et al., 2013). These data imply that
in events with acute stroke, an ongoing state of reduced

platelet adhesion exists, in part due to blockade of the GPIb–
vWF interactions, which may give rise to low solution of the
existing thrombus and also poor resolution of further fatal
thrombotic events.
The immunohistochemical study and the Western blot
analysis presented here indicated that at 24 h after reperfusion, lots of fibrin(ogen) formed and accumulated in the
ipsilateral microvasculature in MCAO model. Similar finding
on fibrin(ogen) deposition in microvessels in MCAO mice
was also reported (Tabrizi et al., 1999; De Meyer et al., 2010).
These results suggested that the ischaemic injury closely connected with fibrin(ogen) formation. The marked increase of
intravascular fibrin(ogen) deposition in ischaemic brain was
associated with platelet adhesion and aggregation, even
microvascular thrombosis, involving vWF–platelet GPIb
receptor and fibrinogen–platelet GPIIb/IIIα receptor interactions, which contributed to form a stable haemostatic plug or
thrombus (Massberg et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 1999). Our
results showed that fibrin(ogen) deposition was barely detectable in the absence of ischaemic stroke (sham mice). Severe
ischaemic cell damage and much intravascular fibrin(ogen)
accumulation were observed in MCAO mice, while anfibatide
could protect the brain from an ischaemic insult and be
effective at decreasing fibrin(ogen) expression in the ischaemic hemispheres. The mechanism may be that anfibatide
inhibits the interaction between GPIb and vWF, which leads
to less platelet adhesion and less thrombus formation. Also,
the absent procoagulant activity of platelets (which serve as
surface for the assembly of coagulation complexes) reduces
coagulation, which results in less thrombin generation and
consequently results in less fibrin(ogen) formation. Moreover, without platelets that interact with each other via
fibrin(ogen), less fibrin(ogen) is accumulated in the vessels.
This strongly suggested that GPIbα blockade by anfibatide
treatment could be useful in ischaemic stroke through inhibition of thrombosis.
Cerebral haemorrhage and bleeding are major complications associated with thrombolytic therapy and antithrombotic therapies. Previous report confirmed that intracranial
bleeding was not increased in mouse model of ischaemic
stroke when vWF–GPIb binding was blocked even completely
(Kleinschnitz et al., 2007). However, blockade of the final
common pathway of platelet aggregation with anti-GPIIb/
IIIα increased the incidence of ICH and mortality after MCAO
(Kleinschnitz et al., 2007; Kellert et al., 2013; Ciccone et al.,
2014). Our results showed that tirofiban, a GPIIb/IIIα inhibitor, had effects on the decreased infarct volumes and accumulation of fibrin(ogen), but it was less effective on some
stroke outcomes and had higher risk of ICH than anfibatide
treatment. Although tail bleeding time was elevated in
anfibatide-treated mice, not subjected to MCAO, in a dosedependent manner, tirofiban resulted in much longer bleeding time, which was in agreement with a similar research
(Kleinschnitz et al., 2007).
It is worth noting that cerebral ischaemia is characterized
by the state of hypercoagulability and hyperviscosity in circulation, which is prone to form thrombosis (Zhu et al., 2005;
Martínez-Martínez et al., 2010). In that case, the significant
reduction in bleeding time was observed in MCAO mice
because of the change of coagulation system. Our study also
assessed the effect of anfibatide and tirofiban on haemostasis
3914

in MCAO mice. By anfibatide treatment, the ameliorative
hypercoagulable state has been proved due to the longer
bleeding time than MCAO mice, but it was still shorter than
sham mice; however, tirofiban exerts obviously longer bleeding time than MCAO mice. These results could explain the
high frequency of ICH after MCAO due to impaired haemostasis after GPIIb/IIIα blockade. Importantly, it also proved
that therapy with anfibatide showed lower incidence of ICH
and shorter tail bleeding time compared with the tirofibantreated mice while providing better protection against ischaemia. These results demonstrate that anfibatide is a potent and
safe antithrombotic agent for treatment of cerebral ischaemia
compared with tirofiban, a GPIIb/IIIα blocker.
