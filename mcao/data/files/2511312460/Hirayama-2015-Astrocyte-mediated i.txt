Preconditioning (PC) using a preceding sublethal ischemic insult is an attractive strategy for protecting neurons by inducing ischemic
tolerance in the brain. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms have been extensively studied, almost all studies have focused on
neurons. Here, using a middle cerebral artery occlusion model in mice, we show that astrocytes play an essential role in the induction of
brain ischemic tolerance. PC caused activation of glial cells without producing any noticeable brain damage. The spatiotemporal pattern
of astrocytic, but not microglial, activation correlated well with that of ischemic tolerance. Interestingly, such activation in astrocytes
lasted at least 8 weeks. Importantly, inhibiting astrocytes with fluorocitrate abolished the induction of ischemic tolerance. To investigate
the underlying mechanisms, we focused on the P2X7 receptor as a key molecule in astrocyte-mediated ischemic tolerance. P2X7 receptors
were dramatically upregulated in activated astrocytes. PC-induced ischemic tolerance was abolished in P2X7 receptor knock-out mice.
Moreover, our results suggest that hypoxia-inducible factor-1␣, a well known mediator of ischemic tolerance, is involved in P2X7
receptor-mediated ischemic tolerance. Unlike previous reports focusing on neuron-based mechanisms, our results show that astrocytes
play indispensable roles in inducing ischemic tolerance, and that upregulation of P2X7 receptors in astrocytes is essential.

Introduction
Neuroprotection and repair after brain injury such as cerebral
ischemia remains a major medical challenge, and pharmacological treatments are only partially effective. A brief episode of sublethal ischemia, referred to as preconditioning (PC), induces
resistance to a subsequent lethal ischemic insult. This phenomenon, known as ischemic tolerance, is an endogenous process that
provides robust neuroprotection (Kirino, 2002). Consequently,
PC may be a powerful strategy for the treatment of brain ischemia. Indeed, PC is being evaluated in a number of randomized
clinical trials (Dirnagl et al., 2009). Furthermore, there are numerous studies investigating ischemic tolerance and PC, and various mechanisms and molecules have been implicated in these
processes.
Ischemic tolerance consists of a rapid phase and a delayed
phase; the former occurs immediately after PC (within a couple

of minutes) and the latter occurs after a delay of 1–3 d and is
dependent on protein synthesis (Dirnagl et al., 2009). In the rapid
phase, adenosine, ATP, and other chemical transmitters that inhibit excitatory synaptic transmission appear to play key roles
(Heurteaux et al., 1995). In the delayed phase, various molecules
have been identified as effectors of ischemic tolerance (Kirino,
2002; Stenzel-Poore et al., 2003). These include hypoxiainducible factor (HIF)-1␣ and hundreds of its target genes, including erythropoietin (EPO; Prass et al., 2003), vascular
endothelial growth factor (Bernaudin et al., 2002), and adrenomedullin (Tixier et al., 2008). In addition, heat shock protein
(Liu et al., 1993; Beere et al., 2000) and several neuroprotective
growth factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Terasaki et al., 2010), also play critical roles. These molecules are
thought to be responsible for neuron-based ischemic tolerance.
Almost all studies on ischemic tolerance and PC have focused
exclusively on neurons, despite the fact that the brain consists of
a much higher numbers of glial cells, which have crucial roles in
both CNS injury and recovery (Hatten et al., 1991; Kreutzberg,
1996). In particular, astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells,
surround synapses, express various neurotransmitter receptors
and transporters, and release gliotransmitters, such as ATP, in
response to various stimuli (Haydon and Carmignoto, 2006).
However, the contribution of astrocytes to brain ischemic tolerance remains unknown.
In the present study, we reveal an essential role for astrocytes
in the induction of ischemic tolerance using an in vivo middle

Materials and Methods
Animals. All procedures were performed in accordance with the Guiding
Principles for the Care and Use of Animals in the Field of Physiologic
Sciences published by the Physiologic Society of Japan and with the previous approval of the Animal Care Committee of Yamanashi University
(Chuo, Yamanashi, Japan; Approval No. A23-9). C57BL/6J mice, 8 –10
weeks old, were purchased from CLEA Japan. P2X7 receptor knock-out
mice (Solle et al., 2001; P2X7 ⫺/⫺ mice, on a C57BL/6 background) were
kindly provided by Drs. Hiroshi Enaida (Saga University, Saga, Japan)
and Shoji Notomi (Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan). P2X7-EGFP
mice were generated from the stock Tg (P2rx7-EGFP) FY174Gsat/
Mmucd purchased from KOMP repository (Mutant Mouse Regional
Resource Centers; www.mmrrc.org) as frozen sperm (ID No. 011959UCD) and recovered at the RIKEN BioResource Center. Male mice were
used in all experiments.
Brain ischemic tolerance model. Unilateral transient focal ischemia in
mice was induced by intraluminal filament occlusion of the right middle
cerebral artery, as previously described (Ikeda-Matsuo et al., 2006). The
animals were anesthetized with 4% (v/v) isoflurane and maintained on
1.2% (v/v) isoflurane with a facemask. After a neck incision was made,
the common carotid artery, internal carotid artery (ICA), and external
carotid artery (ECA) were exposed by dissection. Subsequently, the ECA
was ligated, and a 12 mm length of 6-0 silicone-coated monofilament
suture was inserted via the proximal ECA into the ICA and then into the
circle of Willis, thereby occluding the MCA. For PC, the MCA was occluded for 15 min, then the suture was carefully withdrawn to allow
reperfusion of the ischemic region. One day, 3 d, or 6 d later, the same
suture was inserted to occlude the MCA again for 1 h (i.e., for severe
MCAO). The suture was then carefully withdrawn, and the mice were
allowed to survive for 3 d. Sham-operated animals were subjected to
similar surgical procedures without occlusion of the MCA.
Drug administration. Fluorocitrate (FC) solution for intrastriatal injection was prepared as follows: 8 mg of DL-fluorocitric acid and Ba 2⫹ salt
(Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.1 mmol/L HCl. Two to three
drops of 0.1 mmol/L Na2SO4 were added to precipitate the Ba 2⫹. Two
milliliters of 0.1 mmol/L Na2HPO4 was added, and then the suspension
was centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min. The supernatant was diluted with
saline to the final concentration, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4. The FC
solution was microinjected stereotaxically into the striatum (anterior:
⫺0.22 mm; lateral: 2.5 mm from bregma; depth: 4 mm from the skull
surface) 2 d after PC. FC solution (1 pmol in 1 ␮l) was injected continuously at a rate of 0.5 ␮l/min through a stainless steel cannula (26 gauge)
connected to a 10 ␮l syringe. For control mice, the same volume of saline
was injected into the striatum. Minocycline (45 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich)
was administered intraperitoneally just before and 12 and 24 h after PC.
For the control, saline was intraperitoneally administered.
Analysis of cerebral infarct size. Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused transcardially with saline. The brains
were removed, and the forebrain was sliced into 2-mm-thick coronal
sections (Brain Matrices). The sections were stained with 2% (w/v) 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma-Aldrich) saline solution at
37°C for 10 min. Slices were digitally scanned after staining using a scanner (GT-X750; Epson). The infarct volume of the brain slice was measured using Scion Image software. Infarct size was calculated as infarct
volume of cortex or striatum/volume of whole brain ⫻ 100. For experiments using FC injections, we measured the infarct area instead of volume, because the administration of small amounts of FC affected only a
limited area around the injected site.
Immunohistochemistry. Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital
(100 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused transcardially with saline, followed by 4%
(w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brains were removed, postfixed
overnight in a solution containing 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 4%
(w/v) sucrose in PBS, and cryoprotected in solutions containing 10 and
20% (w/v) sucrose in PBS for 1 d each. The brains were frozen in an
embedding compound (Sakura Finetek) on dry ice, and coronal sections
(20 ␮m) were cut on a cryostat (Leica CM 1100). The sections were fixed

J. Neurosci., March 4, 2015 • 35(9):3794 –3805 • 3795

with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.3%
(v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min, and treated with 3% (v/v) bovine serum
albumin for 30 min in PBS to block nonspecific binding. The sections
were incubated overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies:
mouse anti-GFAP (1:1000; Millipore), rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:1000; Wako),
chicken anti-GFP (1:500; Invitrogen), rabbit anti-NeuN (1:500; Millipore), or mouse anti-HIF-1␣ (1:250; Novus Biologicals). The anti-GFP
antibody was used to label the P2X7 receptor. The sections were washed
and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies: Alexa 488- or Alexa 546-conjugated mouse, chicken, or rabbit IgGs
(Invitrogen). Fluorescence images were obtained using a confocal laser
microscope system (FluoView1000; Olympus). For quantitative analysis
of cell type-specific fluorescent signals, we used Adobe Photoshop CS4
(Adobe Systems ) and ImageJ (NIH). As shown in Figure 1D, to calculate
the number of NeuN (green)-positive neurons, we randomly chose four
ipsilateral striatal fields (each 4 ⫻ 10 5 ␮m 2) per mouse (n ⫽ 3– 4), then
counted the number of NeuN-positive neurons. For the quantitative
analysis of the immunofluorescence intensity of GFAP (green) or Iba1
(red) seen in Figures 2 and 3, we randomly chose four fields (each 4 ⫻ 10 4
␮m 2) per mouse (n ⫽ 3– 4). The intensity was calculated and expressed
as the average pixel density (an 8-bit scale). Background fluorescence was
also measured and was subtracted from each signal. In Figure 6, to calculate the percentage of HIF-1␣-positive cells, we randomly chose four
ipsilateral striatal fields (each 9 ⫻ 10 4 ␮m 2) per mouse (n ⫽ 3– 6), then
counted the number of HIF-1␣ (red)-positive neurons (NeuN: green)
and astrocytes (GFAP: green), as well as the total number of neurons and
astrocytes. The percentage of HIF-1␣-positive cells was calculated by
dividing the number of HIF-1␣-positive cells by the total number of cells.
Similarly, in Figure 4, we also investigated the number of P2X7 receptor
(green)-positive microglia (Iba1: red) and astrocytes (GFAP: red), as well
as the total number of microglia and astrocytes. For analysis of P2X7
receptor expression, we randomly chose three ipsilateral striatal fields
(each 4 ⫻ 10 5 ␮m 2) per mouse (n ⫽ 3– 4).
Quantitative RT-PCR. RT-PCR amplifications were performed using the One Step PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (Takara Bio). RT-PCR
amplifications and real-time detection were performed using an Applied
Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System. The thermocycling parameters
were as follows: 5 min at 42°C for reverse transcription, 10 s at 95°C for
inactivation of RT enzyme, and 40 cycles of denaturation (5 s at 95°C) and
annealing/extension (34 s at 60°C). All primer probe sets and reagents
were purchased from Applied Biosystems (P2rx7: Mm00440578_m1; Aif1:
Mm00479862_g1; GFAP: Mm01253033_m1; EPO: Mm01202755_m1).
Sense and antisense primers and probes for GAPDH were also obtained
from Applied Biosystems (Rodent GAPDH Control Reagents).
Cell culture and treatment. Primary cultures of astrocytes were prepared from cerebral cortices of P0 –P1 wild-type C57BL/6J or P2X7 ⫺/⫺
mice as described previously (Koizumi et al., 2003). Dissected cerebral
cortices were dissociated in Dulbecco’s PBS (Gibco). The cells were
plated in 75 cm 2 flasks (two brains per flask) coated with poly-L-lysine
(10 ␮g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) in DMEM (Gibco) containing 5% (v/v) fetal
bovine serum, 5% (v/v) horse serum, and 0.1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. To purify astrocytes from postnatal brain primary cell cultures,
the cells were subjected to 4 h of continuous shaking 7 d after plating to
remove detached cells. For Western blotting, cells were seeded on 6-well
cell culture plates coated with poly-L-lysine (10 ␮g/ml) at a density of 3 ⫻
10 4 cells/cm 2 and used at 12 d after plating. Approximately 96% of the
cultured cells expressed abundant GFAP. Before treatment with BzATP
(Sigma-Aldrich), a P2X7 receptor agonist, cells were serum starved for 24 h.
Western blot analysis. Astrocytes were prepared as described above.
After BzATP-stimulation, cells were lysed and the lysates were resolved
on a 12.5% (w/v) SDS polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h in
Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 4%
(w/v) skim milk at room temperature. Membranes were incubated with
the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-HIF-1␣ (1:250), mouse
anti-␤-actin (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich), or rabbit anti-P2X7 receptor (1:
200; Alomone Labs) for 3 h at room temperature. After three washes with
TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:10,000; GE Healthcare) or anti-

Results
PC-induced ischemic tolerance
We used the mouse MCAO model throughout the study. We
occluded the MCA for different time periods (from 15 min to
1.5 h), then assessed brain damage by TTC staining 3 d later.
Figure 1A shows the time-dependent brain damage in mice. A 15
min MCAO period caused no damage, whereas a 1 h MCAO
period caused severe damage, with an infarct size similar to that
induced by the 1.5 h MCAO period. We chose a 15 min MCAO
period for PC and a 1 h MCAO period to cause severe ischemic
injury (Fig. 1A). We combined PC with severe MCAO to generate

a model of ischemic tolerance. As shown in Figure 1B, the MCA
was occluded transiently for 15 min for PC, and then 1 d (P1), 3 d
(P3), or 6 d (P6) later, it was occluded again for 1 h (severe
MCAO). In all cases, brain damage was assessed by TTC staining
3 d after severe MCAO. PC significantly decreased brain damage
induced by severe MCAO (P3 and 6), suggesting that this paradigm can be used to model ischemic tolerance (Fig. 1 B, C). We
also used immunohistochemical staining against NeuN to assessed MCAO-evoked neuronal damage, and found that TTC
staining data were well correlated with the NeuN data (Fig. 1D).
Interestingly, PC-induced ischemic tolerance was observed earlier in the striatum (3 d after PC) than in the cortex (Fig. 1C). No
ischemic tolerance was observed 1 d after PC. Thus, these results
suggest that the time interval between PC and severe MCAO (at
least 3 d) is important for the induction of ischemic tolerance.

in the cortex (Fig. 2C,D). PC-induced astrocytic activation lasted

at least 8 weeks (data not shown). In comparison, Iba1 immunoreactivity was increased 1 d after PC in the striatum, but there was
no change in the cortex. Neither GFAP immunoreactivity nor
Iba1 immunoreactivity was upregulated in the contralateral striatum or cortex (Fig. 2B). A comparison with the results in Figure 1
suggests that the spatiotemporal pattern of astrocyte activation

correlates well with the spatiotemporal pattern of ischemic
tolerance.
Astrocytic activation induces ischemic tolerance
To elucidate whether astrocytic activation is required for ischemic tolerance, we investigated the effect of FC, a metabolic inhibitor of astrocytes (Paulsen et al., 1987), on ischemic tolerance.
As shown in Figure 3, A–C, FC was injected into the striatum 2 d
after PC or sham operation. Intrastriatal injection of FC suppressed PC-induced activation of astrocytes, but not microglia
(Fig. 3E) and, importantly, abolished PC-induced ischemic tolerance; i.e., the PC-induced decrease in infarct size was no longer
detected (Fig. 3C,D). FC administration following PC alone, i.e.,
without severe MCAO, produced no brain damage (Fig. 3A). FC
did not affect the size of the infarct induced by severe MCAO
alone, i.e., without PC (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that
astrocytic activation has a major role in PC-induced ischemic
tolerance. Our results also suggest that the time interval between PC and severe MCAO is important for astrocyte activation after PC.
Microglial activation is not involved in ischemic tolerance
We also investigated the effect of minocycline (MC), an inhibitor
of microglial activation (Tikka and Koistinaho, 2001), on ischemic tolerance. MC was injected intraperitoneally three times as
shown in Figure 3F–H. Intraperitoneal injection of MC sup-

pressed PC-induced activation of microglia, but not astrocytes
(Fig. 3J ). MC administration following PC alone, i.e., without
severe MCAO, produced no brain damage (Fig. 3F ). In addition,
MC did not affect the size of the infarct induced by severe MCAO
alone, i.e., without PC (Fig. 3G). In contrast to FC, MC had no
effect on ischemic tolerance (Fig. 3 H, I ). These findings suggest
that PC-induced activation of microglia does not have a substantial role in ischemic tolerance.
The P2X7 receptor is expressed in activated astrocytes
ATP plays a central role in the interaction between neurons and
astrocytes. The P2X7 receptor, an ATP-gated cation channel, mediates glia–neuron communication, especially in pathophysiological conditions (Abbracchio et al., 2009). As shown in Figure
4C, P2rx7 mRNA was upregulated after PC. To determine the
localization of P2X7 receptors after PC, we performed immunohistochemical staining using P2rx7-EGFP transgenic mice. Several reports have shown that P2X7 receptors are expressed in both
resting and activated microglia after MCAO (Collo et al., 1997;
Yanagisawa et al., 2008). Our immunohistochemical staining also
showed that P2X7 receptors were present in microglia in both
sham-operated and PC-treated mice (Fig. 4 A, B, Table 1). Although P2X7 receptors were not expressed in astrocytes in shamoperated control mice or 1 d after PC, a significant upregulation
in astrocytes was observed in the ipsilateral striatum 3 d after PC
(Fig. 4 A, B, Table 1). This result is in agreement with a previous

report (Franke et al., 2004). The upregulation of P2X7 receptors
was dependent upon the activation of astrocytes, because FC, an
inhibitor of astrocyte activation, suppressed P2X7 receptor upregulation (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that rapid (1 d after
PC) and slow (3 d after PC) upregulation of P2X7 receptor
mRNA levels are mainly involved in microglia and astrocytes,
respectively. Thus, this result suggests that the upregulation of
the temporal pattern of astrocytic P2X7 receptors correlates with
that of ischemic tolerance.

The P2X7 receptor is essential for PC-induced ischemic
tolerance
Using WT and P2X7 receptor knock-out (P2X7 ⫺/⫺) mice, we
investigated the involvement of the P2X7 receptor in brain ischemic tolerance. There was no significant difference in the degree
of severe MCAO-induced brain damage (the size of the infarct)
between WT and P2X7 ⫺/⫺ mice (Fig. 5 A, B). However, PCinduced ischemic tolerance was absent in P2X7 ⫺/⫺ mice. These
findings suggest that the P2X7 receptor is essential for ischemic
tolerance. To clarify whether the P2X7 receptor is involved in
PC-mediated astrocyte activation, we compared PC-evoked glial
activation in WT and P2X7 ⫺/⫺ mice. PC itself did not cause any
visible TTC staining in either mouse line (Fig. 5A). Immunohistochemical staining and quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed
that there was no significant difference in the PC-evoked upregulation of GFAP immunoreactivity or GFAP mRNA expression in
the striatum between WT and P2X7 ⫺/⫺ mice (Fig. 5C,D). Similarly, there was no difference in microglial activation between
WT and P2X7 ⫺/⫺ mice. These results suggest that the upregulation of P2X7 receptor expression is an event downstream of astrocyte activation, and that it is essential for the induction of
ischemic tolerance.

PC-induced upregulation of HIF-1␣ and EPO is dependent
on the P2X7 receptor
To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in astrocytic
P2X7 receptor-mediated ischemic tolerance, we focused on
HIF-1␣ and EPO, well known mediators of ischemic tolerance.
First, we investigated the spatiotemporal pattern of HIF-1␣ protein expression by immunohistochemical staining. Similar to
previous reports (Baranova et al., 2007), HIF-1␣ was transiently
increased mainly in neurons (1 d after PC; Fig. 6 B, C); this was
observed in both WT and P2X7 ⫺/⫺ mice. Thereafter, in addition
to neurons, HIF-1␣ was also upregulated in activated astrocytes.
Interestingly, this upregulation was dependent on the P2X7 receptor as it was observed only in WT mice, and not in P2X7 ⫺/⫺
mice (3 and 6 d after PC; Fig. 6 A, C). Next, we investigated the
temporal profile of EPO mRNA expression. Three and six days
after PC, mRNA levels of EPO, a major target of HIF-1␣, were
significantly upregulated in WT mice, but not in P2X7 ⫺/⫺ mice
(Fig. 6D). One day after PC, no changes in EPO mRNA levels
were seen. Thus, both the temporal pattern of EPO mRNA upregulation and dependency of P2X7 receptors on EPO mRNA
upregulation correlated well with those of ischemic tolerance.

Activation of P2X7 receptors result in upregulation of HIF-1␣
in astrocytes
Finally, we tested whether activation of P2X7 receptors resulted
in the upregulation of HIF-1␣ in astrocytes. Although P2X7 receptor expression was very low in the sham-operated mouse
brain (Fig. 4A), P2X7 receptors were present in primary cortical
astrocyte cultures obtained from WT mice, but not P2X7 ⫺/⫺
mice (Fig. 7C), and have been reported to be functional (Panenka
et al., 2001). Thus, primary cultures of astrocytes obtained from
WT and P2X7 ⫺/⫺ mice were stimulated with BzATP, an agonist
of the P2X7 receptor, and the induction of HIF-1␣ was quantitatively analyzed by Western blotting. BzATP increased the expression of HIF-1␣ in a concentration-dependent manner in WT
astrocytes, but not P2X7 ⫺/⫺ astrocytes (Fig. 7 A, B).

Discussion
The key findings of our study are as follows. (1) Astrocyte activation has an indispensable role in the induction of brain ischemic
tolerance. (2) P2X7 receptor expression is upregulated in astrocytes after PC, and this receptor upregulation is essential for ischemic tolerance. (3) HIF-1␣, a master molecule for oxygen

upregulation of HIF-1␣ was observed in both WT and P2X7 ⫺/⫺ mice. In contrast, 3 and 6 d after PC, HIF-1␣ expression was increased in astrocytes. This upregulation was dependent
on the P2X7 receptor; i.e., astrocytic upregulation of HIF-1␣ on day 3 and 6 after PC was significantly higher in WT mice than in P2X7 ⫺/⫺ mice. For quantitative analysis, we used the

Figure 8. Schematic diagram of the mechanisms underlying astrocyte-mediated brain ischemic tolerance. Severe ischemia induces neuronal death (without PC), whereas PC does not cause
ischemic injury. Although neuron-derived HIF-1␣ is upregulated 1 d after PC, this event has no effect on brain injury by severe ischemia. In contrast, 3 d after PC, the upregulation of P2X7 receptors,
followed by the upregulation of HIF-1␣ and neuroprotective molecules (EPO, etc.), is observed in activated astrocytes. Upregulation of P2X7 receptors provides neuroprotection against severe
ischemia and induces ischemic tolerance.

homeostasis, is upregulated in a P2X7 receptor-dependent manner in astrocytes, followed by the subsequent induction of neuroprotective molecules, such as EPO, which likely plays a role in
ischemic tolerance. Unlike the majority of previous ischemic
tolerance studies, which focused on neurons, we demonstrate
the necessity of astrocytes in the induction of ischemic tolerance (Fig. 8).

(2009) reported that several molecules play key roles in PC, including adenosine, adenosine A1 receptor, Toll-like receptors,
HIF, and excitatory amino acid transporters (Dirnagl et al.,
2009). Interestingly, all of these molecules are expressed by astrocytes. Thus, for a better understanding of PC and ischemic tolerance, researchers should carefully evaluate the contribution of
astrocytes to these phenomena.

Astrocyte-mediated ischemic tolerance
Astrocytes regulate various neuronal functions. For example,
they enhance and inhibit synaptic transmission by releasing glutamate (Araque et al., 1998) and ATP (Koizumi et al., 2003; Pascual et al., 2005), respectively. Furthermore, they produce and
release various neurotrophic factors (Ridet et al., 1997), and contribute to energy metabolism (Benarroch, 2005). Thus, astrocytes
play crucial roles in the regulation of brain function, likely including the induction of ischemic tolerance. However, to date,
almost all reports on ischemic tolerance have focused exclusively
on neuron-dependent mechanisms. Recently, Dirnagl et al.

P2X7 receptor as an initiator of astrocyte-mediated
ischemic tolerance
We showed that (1) the spatiotemporal pattern of astrocytic activation correlated well with that of ischemic tolerance (Figs. 1, 2)
and (2) inhibition of astrocytic activation abolished PC-induced
ischemic tolerance (Fig. 3), suggesting the importance of astrocytic activation as an initial process of ischemic tolerance. We
previously showed that ATP has a central role in mediating
neuron-to-glia communication, especially in pathological conditions (Tsuda et al., 2003; Koizumi et al., 2007; Imura et al., 2013).
It has been reported that P2Y1, P2X2, P2X4, and P2X7 receptors

Hirayama et al. • Ischemic Tolerance by Glia

are upregulated after ischemic injury (Franke and Illes, 2006). In
the present study, we found that P2X7 receptor expression
emerged after PC (Fig. 4C). Therefore, we focused on the P2X7
receptor and found that the upregulation of this receptor in astrocytes was essential for PC-mediated induction of ischemic tolerance. The P2X7 receptor is an ionotropic P2 receptor channel
that regulates various cellular responses through interaction
with extracellular signal-regulated kinase, phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, and mitogen-activated protein kinases
(Duan and Neary, 2006; Sperlágh et al., 2006). In the CNS, the
P2X7 receptor has been well studied in microglia, and the ATP/
P2X7 receptor has been found to control numerous microglial
responses (Chakfe et al., 2002; Suzuki et al., 2004). However, the
localization of P2X7 receptors in the CNS remains controversial
because immunohistochemical staining patterns are inconsistent
between antibodies (Yu et al., 2008). Thus, using P2rx7-EGFP
mice, we investigated the precise distribution of the P2X7 receptor after PC, and showed that (1) in the control striatum, P2X7
receptors were mainly present in microglia and no, or only faint,
expression was seen in astrocytes and (2) upon PC (3 d after),
P2X7 receptors increased in astrocytes. The upregulation of the
temporal pattern of astrocytic P2X7 receptors correlated with
that of ischemic tolerance (Figs. 1, 4 A, B), and inhibiting the
upregulation of astrocytic P2X7 receptors by FC administration
resulted in the disappearance of ischemic tolerance (Figs. 3, 4D).
In addition, ischemic tolerance was absent in P2X7 ⫺/⫺ mice (Fig.
5). These findings demonstrate the importance of P2X7 receptors
in astrocytes, rather than microglia. Furthermore, the observation that the spatiotemporal pattern of ischemic tolerance correlated well with that of astrocytic activation, but not microglial
activation (Figs. 1, 2), also supports this concept.
The PC-mediated activation of astrocytes resulted in the induction of ischemic tolerance. However, although P2X7 ⫺/⫺ mice
showed astrocytic activation similar to WT mice in response to
PC, they failed to exhibit ischemic tolerance (Fig. 5). FC inhibited
the PC-evoked upregulation of P2X7 receptors in astrocytes (Fig.
4D). This strongly suggests that astrocytic activation itself is not
necessary for the induction of ischemic tolerance, but that the
upregulation of P2X7 receptors in activated astrocytes is essential. The findings that FC, known to inhibit astrocytic activation
by suppressing mitochondrial metabolism, inhibited both the
PC-evoked upregulation of P2X7 receptors in astrocytes and
ischemic tolerance, would also support this idea (Figs. 3, 4D).
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying astrocytic upregulation of P2X7 receptors remain to be clarified. With regard
to the effect of FC, we cannot exclude the possibility that FC
might also reduce secretion of ATP by inhibiting mitochondrial
function, followed by inhibition of the ATP/P2X7 receptormediated signals in astrocytes, leading to disappearance of ischemic tolerance.
Molecular mechanisms of astrocyte-mediated
ischemic tolerance
Among effectors responsible for ischemic tolerance, HIF has received the greatest attention and is considered a master molecule
that initiates a multitude of downstream signaling cascades (Gidday, 2006). HIF-1␣ plays an essential role in cellular and systemic
oxygen homeostasis by regulating the expression of genes involved in glycolysis, erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and numerous
other processes (Kaelin and Ratcliffe, 2008). Thus, it is considered a master molecule that induces ischemic tolerance (Gidday,
2006; Dirnagl et al., 2009). However, although brain HIF-1␣
clearly plays a key role in PC-induced ischemic tolerance

J. Neurosci., March 4, 2015 • 35(9):3794 –3805 • 3803

(Bergeron et al., 2000), a recent study by Baranova et al. (2007)
using neuron-specific HIF-1␣-deficient mice demonstrated that
ischemic tolerance was not dependent on neuronal HIF-1␣
(Baranova et al., 2007). Because HIF-1␣ is expressed in both
neurons and astrocytes (Chavez et al., 2006), we analyzed the
spatiotemporal profile of HIF-1␣ expression after PC. As shown
in Figure 6C, HIF-1␣ levels rose rapidly in neurons and peaked
1 d after PC. There was no significant difference in neuronal
HIF-1␣ expression between WT and P2X7 ⫺/⫺ mice. In comparison, HIF-1␣ levels rose slowly in astrocytes, peaking 6 d after PC.
Interestingly, the increase in astrocytic HIF-1␣ levels was dependent on the P2X7 receptor because expression was dramatically
inhibited in P2X7 ⫺/⫺ mice at 3 and 6 d. These findings show that
the PC-evoked increase in HIF-1␣ expression occurs in both cell
types and is temporally regulated in a cell type-dependent manner. Baranova et al. (2007) also showed that the PC-evoked increase in HIF-1␣ protein expression exhibits a biphasic
pattern—a quick and transient increase (within 12 h), followed
by a slow and sustained increase (after 2 d; Baranova et al., 2007).
This raises the possibility that the quick and slow increase in
HIF-1␣ expression may be due to neurons and astrocytes, respectively. In addition, such a slow-onset but long-lasting increase in
HIF-1␣ in astrocytes may be important for inducing ischemic
tolerance. Further investigations are required to confirm this
possibility.
HIF-1␣ is rapidly hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase in normoxia. This process is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1␣ protein to escape degradation and accumulate within
cells (Bruick and McKnight, 2001). However, HIF-1␣ is also regulated by oxygen-independent transcription pathways such as
PI3K/Akt/mTOR (Zhong et al., 2000; Agani and Jiang, 2013).
Interestingly, activation of P2X7 receptors leads to activation of
PI3K/Akt signaling (Jacques-Silva et al., 2004) and upregulates
HIF-1␣ target genes (Adinolfi et al., 2012). Furthermore, we
demonstrated that HIF-1␣ expression was increased by BzATP, a
P2X7 receptor agonist, in primary astrocyte cultures (Fig. 7 A, B).
Therefore, we hypothesize that the slow increase in HIF-1␣ expression in astrocytes is likely independent of oxygen status, and is instead dependent on PC-induced P2X7 receptor upregulation.
Microglia make a small contribution to ischemic tolerance
Microglia, another type of glial cell, function as highly sensitive
sensors, constitutively surveying the brain microenvironment
(Wake et al., 2009). In this study, microglia appeared to have no
direct effect on brain ischemic tolerance. The findings that the
spatiotemporal pattern of microglial activation did not correlate
with that of ischemic tolerance (Figs. 1, 2), and that the inhibition
of microglial activation had no effect on ischemic tolerance (Fig. 3)
clearly show that microglia are not involved in ischemic tolerance.
Microglia can sense changes in the brain microenvironment,
including PC. In the ipsilateral striatum, PC induced the activation of microglia, followed by the activation of astrocytes (Fig.
2C,D). Microglia release various cytokines, which subsequently
activate astrocytes (Hanisch, 2002). Such sequential patterns of
glial activation are also seen in other pathological models, such as
neuropathic pain (Shibata et al., 2011). Thus, microglia may be
indirectly involved in ischemic tolerance. However, in the ipsilateral cortex, where ischemic tolerance was induced, astrocytes
were activated without prior microglial activation (Figs. 1, 2).
Although immunohistochemical staining with the anti-Iba1 antibody may not have been able to detect low levels of microglial
activation, our findings suggest that activation of microglia is not

3804 • J. Neurosci., March 4, 2015 • 35(9):3794 –3805

necessarily required for the induction of ischemic tolerance in the
brain.
Together, our findings indicate that astrocytes upregulate
P2X7 receptor expression upon PC stimulation, and that they
have an indispensable role in the induction of ischemic tolerance.
Although microglial P2X7 receptors are considered to be death
receptors under pathological conditions, we demonstrate for the
first time that the astrocytic P2X7 receptor is upregulated by PC
and is involved in ischemic tolerance. Therefore, when evaluating
the role of P2X7 receptors in ischemic tolerance, a cell typespecific consideration is required. In addition, although it is well
established that neurons play an important role in the induction
of ischemic tolerance, our findings suggest that glial cells may be
more important. Thus, a better understanding of ischemic tolerance will require researchers to evaluate the combined contribution of neurons and glial cells. This new insight into the role of
glial cells in the cell-autonomous and noncell-autonomous
mechanisms that mediate neuroprotection should promote the
development of novel therapeutic strategies for brain ischemia.
