The identiﬁcation of novel drug targets for the treatment of ischemic stroke is currently an
urgent challenge. Recent experimental ﬁndings have highlighted the neuroprotective potential of
immunomodulatory strategies, based on polarization of myeloid cells toward non-inﬂammatory, beneﬁcial phenotypes. Given the role of retinoid X receptors (RXR) in myeloid cells differentiation and
polarization, here we have explored the neuroprotective potential of the RXR agonist bexarotene in
mice subjected to focal cerebral ischemia.
Acute administration of bexarotene signiﬁcantly reduced blood brain barrier leakage, brain infarct
damage and neurological deﬁcit produced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice, without
affecting cerebral blood ﬂow. The rexinoid exerted neuroprotection with a wide time-window, being
effective when administered up to 4.5 h after the insult. The amelioration of histological outcome, as well
as the ability of bexarotene to revert middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo)-induced spleen atrophy,
was antagonised by BR1211, a pan-RXR antagonist, or by the selective peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor (PPAR)␥ antagonist bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE), highlighting the involvement of the
RXR/PPAR␥ heterodimer in the beneﬁcial effects exerted by the drug. Immunoﬂuorescence analysis
revealed that bexarotene elevates Ym1-immunopositive N2 neutrophils both in the ipsilateral hemisphere and in the spleen of mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, pointing to a
major role for peripheral neutrophil polarization in neuroprotection.
Thus, our ﬁndings suggest that the RXR agonist bexarotene exerts peripheral immunomodulatory
effects under ischemic conditions to be effectively repurposed for the acute therapy of ischemic stroke.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke is a major cause of death and long-term disability worldwide [1]; yet, current therapeutic approaches for its
acute treatment only rely on blood ﬂow restoration by pharmacological thrombolysis and/or mechanical thrombectomy [2–4]. The

therapeutic window for successful recanalization is conventionally
set at a threshold of 6 h; therefore, approximately 10% of patients
may actually beneﬁt from these procedures. Moreover, thrombus
removal is associated to major drawbacks consisting in the high
risk of cerebral haemorrhage and in the lack of linear correlation
between the grade of recanalization and the clinical outcome [5–7].
Given the clinical failure of all the neuroprotective approaches
tested to date, the identiﬁcation of novel drug targets that allow
widening the therapeutic time-window, while promoting tissue
recovery with a low risk of toxicity is currently an urgent challenge.
The innate immune system plays a crucial role in the evolution of ischemic brain injury [8]. Indeed, the majority of the
genes acutely regulated in the blood of ischemic stroke patients are
expressed in circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes and regulate the immune response [9–11]. These blood-borne
cells inﬁltrate the ischemic brain where they may exert a dualistic effect on the evolution of tissue damage, depending on their

polarization toward detrimental (classical M1 or N1) or beneﬁcial
(alternatively activated M2 or N2) phenotypes, prompting inﬂammatory responses or resolution of inﬂammation and tissue repair,
respectively [8,12]. Accordingly, recent experimental ﬁndings have
highlighted the neuroprotective potential of inducing M2 polarization of macrophages [13,14] or N2 phenotypes in neutrophils [15]
under stroke conditions.
Retinoids have been shown to be involved in immune homeostasis; in fact, activation of RXR affects differentiation, function
and metabolism of myeloid cells [16,17]. More interestingly, RXR
exert an anti-inﬂammatory effect on myeloid cells, prompting their
polarization toward alternatively activated phenotypes via inhibition of NF-␬B transactivation [16,18–20]. Thus, RXR represent
promising pharmacological targets in a series of immunopathologic conditions [17] and show potential as novel targets for
immunomodulation in stroke.
Therefore, in the present study, we have aimed at evaluating the
involvement of RXR in the development of ischemic stroke injury.
To this end, we have characterized the neuroprotective effects of
the RXR agonist bexarotene in a mouse model of transient focal
cerebral ischemia, also highlighting the contribution of myeloid
cell polarization toward alternatively activated phenotypes to the
beneﬁcial effects exerted by the drug.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Ethics statement
Animal care and experimental procedures were carried out following the guidelines of the Italian Ministry of Health (DL 26/2014),
in accordance with the European directive 2010/63/UE, and the
protocol (Protocol Number 120000344) was approved by the Committee set by the Ministry of Health at the National Institute of
Health (Rome) and by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee set at the Department of Pharmacy, Nutrition and Health
Sciences of the University of Calabria. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering. The study was
conducted applying the ARRIVE guidelines [21].
2.2. Animals and drug treatments
All the experiments were performed on adult male C57/BL6
mice, weighing 25 ± 2 g (Charles River, Calco, Como, Italy). Animals were housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 08:00
a.m.) under controlled environmental conditions with ambient
temperature of 22 ◦ C, relative humidity of 65% and ad libitum access to food and water. Mice were randomly assigned
to the following experimental groups: (1) sham surgery, (2)
30 min MCAo + vehicle, (3) 30 min MCAo + Bexarotene, (4) 30 min
MCAo + co-treatment Bexarotene/BR1211, (5) 30 min MCAo + cotreatment Bexarotene/BADGE.
Bexarotene (Sigma–Aldrich, Milan, Italy) was solubilized in
DMSO and administered at the doses of 0.5, 5 or 25 mg/kg by the
intraperitoneal route (i.p.), at the onset of reperfusion or at 2 or 4 h
after the beginning of reperfusion. BR1211, a pan-RXR antagonist
[22,23], was dissolved in DMSO and administered i.p. at a dose of
1 mg/kg, 1 h before MCAo. The selective PPAR␥ antagonist BADGE
(Sigma–Aldrich, Milan, Italy) [24,25] was dissolved in polyethylene
glycol (PEG) and administered i.p. at a dose of 30 mg/kg, 30 min
before MCAo. Vehicle-control animals received an i.p. injection of
DMSO (250 ␮l/kg) or PEG (2 ml/kg).
2.3. Focal cerebral ischemia
Anesthesia was induced by 4% isoﬂurane (Merial Italia spa,
Milan, Italy) vaporized in air and maintained with a lower

299

concentration (1.5%) of the anesthetic during the surgical procedures. Body temperature was monitored throughout surgery via
a rectal probe and maintained at 37 ◦ C ± 0.5 ◦ C using a heating
pad (CMA 450 Temperature Controller). During surgery, CBF was
monitored over the cerebral cortex of the ischemic hemisphere,
corresponding to the supply territory of the middle cerebral artery,
by lased-Doppler ﬂowmetry (Periﬂux System 5000, Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden). To this aim, the right temporo-parietal region of
the head was shaved, a small incision was made in the skin overlying the temporalis muscle and a ﬂexible laser-Doppler probe was
glued onto the parietal bone (6 mm lateral and 2 mm posterior from
bregma) [26]. Local CBF was continuously measured, keeping the
animal under isoﬂurane anesthesia, from 15 min before MCAo up
to 15 min after the beginning of reperfusion.
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by MCAo using a relatively non-invasive technique as previously described [27]. Brieﬂy,
under an operating microscope, a midline incision was made on
the ventral surface of the neck; the right common carotid artery
was carefully isolated with a 4-0 silk suture, and the occipital and
pterygopalatine arteries were identiﬁed and separated. The external carotid artery was isolated and cut approximately 1.5 mm above
the common carotid artery bifurcation, whereas the internal carotid
artery was carefully separated from the adjacent vagus nerve and
temporarily occluded using a microvascular clip. A silicone-coated
nylon ﬁlament (diameter: 0.23 mm, Doccol Corporation, Redlands,
CA, USA) was then introduced into the internal carotid artery via
an incision made on the external carotid artery and advanced
10–12 mm distal to the carotid bifurcation, up to the origin of
the middle cerebral artery. The occlusion of the middle cerebral
artery was conﬁrmed by a ≥70% cortical cerebral ﬂow reduction.
The occluding ﬁlament was withdrawn 30 min after MCAo to allow
reperfusion. The neck incision was closed with silk sutures, and the
animals were allocated to their cages with free access to food and
water. Sham-operated mice were subjected to the same surgical
procedure, without occlusion of the middle cerebral artery.
2.4. Neuropathology and quantiﬁcation of ischemic damage
To quantify brain infarct damage, animals were sacriﬁced 48 h
after the beginning of reperfusion and their brains were rapidly
removed and immediately frozen in isopentane cooled at −40 ◦ C.
Thirteen coronal 20 ␮m-thick sections were cut, at 0.5 mm intervals from the frontal pole (from bregma levels 3.14 to −2.92 mm),
using a cryostat, mounted onto glass slides and stained with cresyl
violet (Sigma–Aldrich, Milan, Italy). Images of cresyl violet-stained
sections were captured by a digital scanner and analyzed using
an image analysis software (ImageJ, version 1.30). Infarct volume
(mm3 ) was blindly determined by summing the infarcted (pale)
areas of the coronal tissue slices and multiplying the obtained
value by the interval-thickness between sections. Infarct edema
was calculated by subtracting the size of the whole contralateral
(non-infarcted) hemisphere from the whole ipsilateral (infarcted)
hemisphere. To investigate involvement of the spleen in stroke
pathology, spleens were quickly collected from mice subjected to
MCAo and weighed.
2.5. Neurological deﬁcit score
Forty eight hours after reperfusion, mice were examined for
neurological deﬁcit by an experimenter (DA or MC) blinded to the
treatment schedule, using a modiﬁed ﬁve-tiered grading system
[28]. A score of 0 was given if the animal demonstrated normal
spontaneous movements (no deﬁcit); a score of 1 was given if
the animal was failing to fully extend the contralateral forepaw
when held by the tail and slowly lowered to observe symmetry
in the extension of both forelimbs while the mouse reached the

reduced resistance to a lateral push; a score of 3 was given if the
animal was turning toward the contralateral side when held by the
tail on a ﬂat surface; a score of 4 was given if the animal showed no
spontaneous movement or a comatose state; and a score of 5 was
given if the animal died.

2.6. Assessment of blood brain barrier disruption
Evans blue leakage into the brain parenchyma was used to
evaluate blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption following experimental stroke, as described previously [29]. Brieﬂy, a 4%
solution of Evans blue (Sigma–Aldrich, Milan, Italy) in saline was

administered (8 ml/kg, i.p.) upon reperfusion. The dye was allowed
to circulate for 2 h and then mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane
and perfused with heparinized isotonic saline (1000U/l) through
the left ventricle to remove the intravascular dye until colorless
ﬂuid outﬂowed from the right atrium. After decapitation, the brains
were quickly removed, divided into right and left hemispheres and
immediately weighed. Each hemisphere was immersed in 400 ␮l
formamide and incubated at 50 ◦ C for 48 h for dye extraction. The
tissue was removed and 500 ␮l of pure formamide were then added
to each tube. The concentration of Evans blue was determined using
a spectrophotometer by measuring absorbance at 620 nm and tissue content of Evans blue was quantiﬁed from a linear standard
curve and expressed as Evans blue (␮g)/tissue (g).
2.7. Immunohistological staining
Animals were anesthetized with isoﬂurane and perfused
through the heart with heparinized (4000 U/ml) saline (0.9% NaCl)
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma–Aldrich, Milan, Italy), pH
6.9, in phosphate buffer (PB, 0.1 M). Brains and spleens were rapidly
removed, post-ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h, cryopreserved
by incubation in 15% and 30% sucrose in PB at 4 ◦ C and thereafter
frozen in Tissue Freezing Medium (TFMTM Triangle Biomedical Sciences, Durham, North Carolina, USA). 40 ␮m-thick coronal brain
sections, at the level of the middle cerebral artery territory (1.18 to
−0.10 from Bregma) [26], were obtained using a cryostat and collected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Sections of the spleens
were cut using a cryostat as a set of 40 ␮m-thick serial sections.
After a pre-incubation for 1 h in blocking solution (10% normal goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PB), free-ﬂoating brain
slices were incubated overnight at 4 ◦ C with the following primary
antibodies: rat anti mouse CD11b (1:200; clone M1/70.15; AbD
Serotec, Kidlington, UK) to label microglia/macrophages; rat anti
mouse Ly-6B.2 (1:200; clone 7/4; AbD Serotec, Kidlington, UK) to
label Ly-6G+ neutrophils and Ly-6C+ inﬂammatory macrophages
[30–32]; rat anti-mouse Ly-6G (1:200; clone 1A8; BD Pharmingen, Italy) to label neutrophils; rabbit anti mouse Ym1 (1:100,
StemCell Technologies, UK) to label alternatively-activated cells
[15,33]. Spleen sections were incubated overnight at 4 ◦ C with
hamster anti mouse CD3 (1:200; clone 145-2C11; AbD Serotec,
Kidlington, UK) to label T lymphocytes. After washing three times
with PBS, brain and spleen sections were then incubated for
2 h at room temperature in a solution containing an appropriate mixture of the corresponding secondary antibodies labeled

with AlexaFluor 488 or AlexaFluor 594 (1:400 dilution; Molecular
Probes; Invitrogen, Milan, Italy). Finally, cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (1:500; Sigma–Aldrich, Milan, Italy), and
the sections were mounted onto gelatin-coated slides, air-dried
and coverslipped with Fluoromount (Sigma–Aldrich, Milan, Italy).
Immunostaining was examined under a ﬂuorescence microscope
(Leica DMI6000B, Leica Microsystems Srl, Milan, Italy) equipped
with a high-resolution digital camera (Leica DFC350FX) and a dedicated software (LAS AF6000) for image analysis.
2.8. Cell counting
To quantify the brain inﬁltration of beneﬁcial N2 neutrophils,
Ly-6B.2+ and Ly-6B.2+ /Ym1+ cells were counted in the ipsilateral
hemispheres of vehicle- and bexarotene-treated mice subjected to
transient MCAo. Brieﬂy, three coronal brain sections, corresponding to the middle cerebral artery territory, were taken from each
brain at 0.98, 0.38 and −0.22 mm from bregma. Digitized images
were acquired under identical microscope settings and cells were
counted off-line, using ImageJ software, in three different optic
ﬁelds of the confocal images (acquired through the 20 × objective)
of the ischemic striatum (dorsal striatum, lateral striatum and ventral striatum). For each optic ﬁeld, the total number of cells labeled
for Ly-6B.2 only and for Ly-6B.2 co-labeled with the marker Ym1,
were counted.
2.9. Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean and
subjected to statistical analysis using Graph-Pad Prism version
5.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) as speciﬁed
in each ﬁgure legend. One-way or two-way ANOVA was used to
compare more than two groups. Neurological deﬁcit scores were
expressed as median and analyzed with the Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric test. P values below 0.05 were considered statistically
signiﬁcant.
3. Results
A single dose of the RXR agonist bexarotene (5 or 25 mg/kg),
administered i.p. upon reperfusion, signiﬁcantly reduced brain
infarct damage produced in mice by 30 min MCAo followed by
48 h reperfusion (Fig. 1A–C). The 0.5 mg/kg dose resulted ineffective. The neuroprotective effect of the drug was not associated with

by systemic administration of a neuroprotective dose of bexarotene (BEXA25, 25 mg/kg, i.p., upon reperfusion). Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue signal). Scale

abolishes the reduction of spleen weight associated to transient MCAo, and this effect is reverted by co-administration of the RXR antagonist BR1211 (1 mg/kg, i.p., 1 h before

modiﬁcations of CBF as assessed by laser Doppler ﬂowmetry. In fact,
during occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, a signiﬁcant reduction of CBF was detected in both vehicle and drug-treated mice
(Fig. 1D). In addition, bexarotene (25 mg/kg, i.p., upon reperfusion)
also reduced early BBB leakage (Fig. 2A) and neurological deﬁcit
(Fig. 2B) induced by transient MCAo.
To characterize the time-window for the neuroprotective effects
of bexarotene, a single dose (25 mg/kg, i.p.) of the drug was administered at different time-points (i.e., 0.5, 2.5 or 4.5 h) after MCAo. A
signiﬁcant reduction of brain infarct volume was observed in the
animals treated with bexarotene up to 4.5 h after the insult (Fig. 3A);
whereas, reduced brain infarct edema was produced when this drug
was administered up to 2.5 h after MCAo (Fig. 3B).
In order to assess the involvement of RXR/PPAR␥ heterodimer
in the neuroprotection exerted by bexarotene, we evaluated the
effects of BR1211, a pan-RXR antagonist [23], and of the selective
PPAR␥ antagonist BADGE [24,25]. Neither BR1211 (1 mg/kg, i.p.,
1 h before MCAo), nor BADGE (30 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min before MCAo)
affected the extension of brain infarct damage produced by 30 min
MCAo followed by 48 h of reperfusion (Fig. 4A–D). However, pharmacological blockade of either RXR (with BR1211) or PPAR␥ (with
BADGE) signiﬁcantly reverted the reduction of brain infarct volume
and edema induced by bexarotene (Fig. 4A–D). This suggests that

the neuroprotective effects of bexarotene are mediated by activation of the RXR/PPAR␥ heterodimer.
Given their crucial role in the modulation of the immune system,
we next examined the effects of pharmacological modulation of
RXR on spleen modiﬁcations induced by transient MCAo. According
to previous studies [34–36], we found that after 48 h of reperfusion spleen size was signiﬁcantly reduced with respect to sham
surgery (Fig. 5A and B) and this was associated with a reduced
number of T lymphocytes as revealed by immunoﬂuorescence
analysis of CD3-expressing cells (Fig. 5A). Acute administration of
a neuroprotective dose of bexarotene (25 mg/kg, given i.p. upon
reperfusion) reverted the effects of MCAo on spleen size and CD3
expression (Fig. 5A), and this effect was mediated by activation of
the RXR/PPAR␥ heterodimer as revealed by the evidence that it was
blocked by pretreatment with BR1211 or BADGE (Fig. 5B).
To further investigate the immunomodulatory effects of
bexarotene, polarization of the immune cells toward beneﬁcial
phenotypes was assessed by immunoﬂuorescence analysis of the
marker Ym1. Interestingly, we found that bexarotene elevates
Ym1-immunopositive cells both in the cortex and in the striatum
of mice subjected to 30 min MCAo followed by 48 h of reperfusion (Fig. 6A). This was coincident with an elevation of the
number of Ym1/Ly-6B.2-immunopositive cells in the ischemic

hemisphere of mice treated with bexarotene, as compared to
vehicle (Fig. 6A–C). Interestingly, although bexarotene produced
an elevation of Ly6B.2-immunopositive cells in the ipsilateral,
ischemic striatum as comparted to vehicle-injected control, the
majority of these cells were indeed immunopositive for Ym1,
namely N2-polarised neutrophils (Fig. 6C). In fact, Ly6B.2 labels
both Ly6G+ neutrophils and Ly6C+ inﬂammatory macrophages,
but not Ly6C− /Ym1+ M2 macrophages [30–32], suggesting that
Ym1+ /Ly-6B.2+ cells represent N2 neutrophils, as also conﬁrmed
by the colocalization (in bexarotene-treated animals, but not in
vehicle-injected controls) of Ym1 with the speciﬁc neutrophilic
marker Ly-6G (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, a higher density of Ly6G/Ym1-immunopositive N2 neutrophils was also detected in the
spleen of the mice subjected to transient MCAo and treated with
bexarotene, as compared to vehicle (Fig. 7B). This latter ﬁnding further suggests that the neuroprotection exerted by bexarotene may
be mediated by a peripheral action of the drug promoting polarization of neutrophils toward the non-inﬂammatory N2 phenotype.

4. Discussion
In the present study, we have demonstrated that acute administration of bexarotene signiﬁcantly reduces early BBB leakage, brain
infarct damage and neurological deﬁcit induced by transient MCAo

in mice. The neuroprotective effects of bexarotene are dependent
on the activation of RXR/PPAR␥ heterodimer and involve the modulation of the peripheral immune system. In fact, bexarotene reduces
MCAo-induced spleen atrophy and elevates brain inﬁltration of N2polarized neutrophils in the ischemic brain hemisphere. Thus, our
ﬁndings suggest that the RXR agonist bexarotene can be effectively
repurposed for the acute therapy of ischemic stroke.
Bexarotene is a highly selective, blood–brain barrier permeant
[37–39], RXR agonist clinically used for the treatment of T cell
lymphoma, with a favorable safety proﬁle [40–42]. This synthetic
rexinoid exerts its biological action through binding and activation of the three RXR: RXR␣, RXR␤ and RXR␥. Once activated,
these receptors function as key transcription factors regulating
processes such as cellular differentiation and proliferation, apoptosis, and insulin sensitization. In fact, they are the heterodimeric
partners for numerous nuclear receptors, including RAR, PPARs,
vitamin D receptors and thyroid hormone receptor. In fact, RXR
form three different types of dimers: RXR homodimer, permissive
heterodimers and nonpermissive heterodimers [43]. Homodimers
and permissive heterodimers (e.g., PPARs, LXR, pregnane X receptor) are activated upon RXR ligand binding [44,45]. Non-permissive
heterodimers (e.g., RAR, vitamin D receptors and thyroid hormone
receptor) cannot be activated by the RXR agonists alone, but only

M. Certo et al. / Pharmacological Research 102 (2015) 298–307

by the ligand of the partner receptor, alone or in combination with
an RXR ligand [46].
Bexarotene does not have signiﬁcant RAR binding and transactivation of RAR-response genes except at higher dose levels [47,48];
whereas, the majority of its actions are mediated by the activation
of the heterodimerization partners LXR [49] and PPARs, including
PPAR␣ [49,50], PPARı [51] and, more importantly, PPAR␥ [52–55].
Notably, PPAR␥ mediates the inhibitory effects of bexarotene on
angiogenesis and metastases [52] and its ability to impair arterial mononuclear cell recruitment [54] and angiotensin II-mediated
inﬂammation through decreased expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in vascular smooth muscle cells [55].
In the present study, we have demonstrated that bexarotene
signiﬁcantly reduces brain infarct damage produced by transient
MCAo in mice through the activation of RXR as highlighted by
the evidence that neuroprotection was reverted by the selective
RXR antagonist BR1211 [23]. In order to assess which PPAR subtype contributes to the beneﬁcial effects exerted by bexarotene, we
have evaluated the effect of the PPAR␥ antagonist BADGE [24,25]
and found that this latter drug reverted the reduction of brain
infarct volume and edema produced by the rexinoid. Interestingly, the RXR/PPAR␥ heterodimer can be activated by both RXR
and PPAR agonists, either individually or together to cause a synergistic activation [56–58]. This raises the question whether the
coadministration of PPAR␥ and RXR ligands further enhances the
neuroprotective effect of either ligand in stroke. Indeed, previous
studies have demonstrated the pre-clinical effectiveness of PPAR␥
agonists, including the thiazolidinediones troglitazone, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, in stroke [15,59–65].
Rosiglitazone signiﬁcantly decreased expression of inﬂammatory mediators, including cytokines and chemokines, and
attenuated extravasation of macrophages and neutrophils into the
ischemic brain [60,61,66]. Nevertheless, more recent ﬁndings have
demonstrated that rosiglitazone accelerates neutrophil inﬁltration
to the ischemic core, prompting neuroprotection by promoting
their polarization toward the N2 phenotype [15]. Accordingly,
recent ﬁndings have highlighted the ability of neutrophils to polarize toward beneﬁcial N2 phenotypes [67] and, more importantly,
their contribution to the resolution of inﬂammation in the setting
of stroke [15]. This, together with the evidence documenting the
beneﬁts of increasing the M2/M1 ratio in animal models of focal
cerebral ischemia [15,64,68,69], highlights the therapeutic potential of promoting polarization of immune cells toward beneﬁcial
phenotypes in stroke.
Given the involvement of RXR in myeloid cells polarization and
differentiation [20,70–74], we have explored the immunomodulatory effects of bexarotene in a mouse model of focal cerebral
ischemia. We originally observed that acute treatment with a neuroprotective dose of bexarotene produced a signiﬁcant elevation of
N2 neutrophils in the ischemic hemisphere.
This effect was associated with an elevated density of
Ly6G/Ym1-immunopositive neutrophils in the spleen, suggesting
that RXR stimulation promotes polarization of neutrophils toward
beneﬁcial phenotypes in the periphery. Indeed, pharmacological blockade of either RXR or PPAR␥ antagonizes the ability of
bexarotene to reduce spleen atrophy induced by MCAo.
Our ﬁndings are consistent with previous evidence demonstrating that stroke-induced peripheral immunodepression occurs
mostly during the ﬁrst few days after acute stroke and involves profound loss of immune cells, particularly T and B cells in secondary
lymphatic organs, leading to their atrophy [75–77]. Splenic atrophy may contribute to brain injury. In fact, it has been associated
to the release of inﬂammatory mediators and of spleen-derived
inﬂammatory cells into circulation and their migration into the
brain, which exacerbate the brain inﬂammatory response and
cause secondary cerebral damage [35,36,78–83]. Remarkably, our

305

ﬁndings demonstrate a correlation of MCAo-induced splenic atrophy or drug-induced splenic preservation with the extension
of infarct volume, consistent with previous observations [84].
Moreover, the profound systemic immunodepression produced by
cerebral ischemia predisposes patients to infectious complications
that are a leading cause of death in patients with acute stroke
[75,85]. Thus, our results demonstrate that bexarotene ameliorates stroke-induced peripheral immunodepression by attenuating
spleen atrophy, suggesting that activation of RXR/PPAR␥ may also
preserve spleen function lowering the risk of post-stroke infections.
The immunomodulatory effects of bexarotene and their relevance in the amelioration of stroke outcome represent a novel
mechanism by which this drug may provide neuroprotection in
acute neurodegenerative conditions. In this context, the efﬁcacy of
a single dose of the drug, comparable to those proven to be well
tolerated in humans, allows to overcome toxicity mainly related
to its repeated administration (e.g., hyperlipidaemia, leukopenia and secondary hypothyroidism) [86,87]. By contrast, previous
ﬁnding aimed at investigating the beneﬁcial effects of RXR modulation in chronic neurodegenerative diseases have revealed the
involvement of distinct therapeutic mechanisms. In fact, activation of PPAR␥-RXR and LXR-RXR by bexarotene has recently been
demonstrated to promote clearance of ␤-amyloid from the brains
of murine Alzheimer’s disease models, thus stimulating a rapid
reversal of cognitive and behavioral deﬁcits associated with the
disease [37,88]. Nevertheless, the proposed mechanisms of action
of this drug, particularly regarding plaque loss, have been the subject of recent controversy [38,89–92]. Moreover, previous studies
have indicated that activation of RXR provides trophic support for
dopaminergic neurons. In fact, RXR ligands rescue dopaminergic
neurons from degeneration caused by the Parkinson diseasemodelling toxin 6-hydroxy dopamine or by hypoxia via activation
of the Nurr1-RXR heterodimer [93,94].
RXR-RAR also mediates the reduction of neuronal death provided by all-trans retinoic acid in cultured rat hippocampal slices
exposed to oxygen/glucose-deprivation/reperfusion [95]; nevertheless, to date, the relevance of RXR activation in in vivo ischemic
conditions has not been explored.
In conclusion, with the present study we have originally
demonstrated that RXR may represent useful targets for stroke neuroprotection. Accordingly, RXR/PPAR␥ activation by bexarotene
signiﬁcantly ameliorates histological and neurological outcomes
associated with transient focal cerebral ischemia in mice, the effective doses and the time-window being compatible with the clinical
use of the rexinoid. Our evidence reafﬁrms the strategic value of
pharmacological studies to repurpose drugs with a well established
safety proﬁle in stroke [96–98].
