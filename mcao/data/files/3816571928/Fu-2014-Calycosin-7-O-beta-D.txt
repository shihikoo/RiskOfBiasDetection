Ethnopharmacology relevance: Astragali Radix (AR) has been used for thousands years to treat ischemic
stroke. Calycosin and its glycoside form calycosin-7-O-β-D-glucoside (CG) are two representative
isoﬂavones in Astragali Radix. However, its neurological effects and related molecular mechanisms are
largely unknown. The present study aims to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of CG on blood–brain
barrier (BBB) integrity of ischemic brain tissue and explore the relevant signaling mechanisms.
Material and method: Male adult Sprague-Daweley rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) plus 24 h or 14 days of reperfusion. CG (26.8 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally
administered into the rats at 15 min before onset of ischemia. The neuroprotective effects of CG were
evaluated by measuring infarct volume, histological damage and BBB permeability. Furthermore, the
effects of CG on scavenging nitric oxide (NO), and modulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and
caveolin-1
(cav-1) were investigated with in vitro cultured brain microvascular endothelial cells treated with NO
donor or oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) and/or in vivo rat model of MCAO cerebral ischemia–
reperfusion injury.
Results: CG treatment signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume, histological damage and BBB permeability in
the in vivo MCAO ischemia–reperfusion rat model. CG treatment remarkably inhibited the expression and
activities of MMPs, and secured the expression of cav-1 and tight junction proteins in the microvessels
isolated from ischemic rat cortex. Furthermore, CG was revealed to scavenge NO, inhibit the activities of
MMP-2 and MMP-9, and attenuate cell death in the in vitro cultured brain microvascular endothelial cells
under OGD condition.
Conclusion: CG could protect BBB integrity in experimental cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury via
regulating NO/cav-1/MMPs pathway.

damage, but also triggers numerous molecular cascades, leading
to blood–brain barrier (BBB) hyper-permeability, brain edema,
hemorrhage, inﬂammation and neuronal cell death (Hensley
et al., 2000; Chan, 2001; Droge, 2002).
Activating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is a key step in
BBB disruption during cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury (Liu
and Rosenberg, 2005). MMPs are proteolytic zinc-containing
enzymes responsible for degradation of the extracellular matrix
around cerebral blood vessels and neurons. Free radicals can
activate MMPs and induce the degradation of tight junctions
(TJs), subsequently leading to BBB breakdown in cerebral ischemia–
reperfusion injury (Liu and Rosenberg, 2005). Caveolin-1 (cav-1), a

S. Fu et al. / Journal of Ethnopharmacology 155 (2014) 692–701

membrane integral protein located at caveolae, appears to be a
critical player in the regulation of BBB permeability. The interaction
of nitric oxide (NO), cav-1 and MMPs is considered as a novel
molecular mechanism of BBB disruption during cerebral ischemia–
reperfusion injury (Gu et al., 2011, 2012). Cav-1 could prevent the
degradation of TJ proteins and protect the BBB integrity through
inhibiting inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and MMPs activity
(Gu et al., 2012). On the other hand, NO production can inhibit cav-1
expression and MMPs activation during cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury (Gursoy-Ozdemir et al., 2000, 2004; Shen et al., 2006). In
ischemia–reperfused brains, NO down-regulated the expression of
cav-1 and the loss of cav-1 in brain microvascular endothelial cells
initiated the activation of MMPs, subsequently leading to the
degradation of TJ proteins and BBB disruption (Shen et al., 2006;
Gu et al., 2012). The interaction of nitric oxide (NO), cav-1 and MMPs
forms a positive feedback loop and provides ampliﬁed impacts on
BBB dysfunction (Shen et al., 2006; Gu et al., 2011). Therefore,
targeting NO/cav-1/MMPs pathway is a promising therapeutic strategy for protecting the BBB integrity against cerebral ischemia–
reperfusion injury.
With experience of thousands of years in human, Chinese
herbal medicine holds a unique position for drug discovery.
Astragali Radix (AR), also known as Huangqi in Chinese, is the root
of plant genus Astragalus. According to Traditional Chinese
Medicine Theory, as a primary “tonic” herb, Astragali Radix could
invigorate Qi to improve blood circulation and has been widely
used for many aging-related diseases including cardiovascular and
cerebral vascular diseases in Chinese medical practices. The crude
extracts of Astragali Radix were reported to have antioxidant and
neuroprotective effects (He et al., 2000). From the chemical point
of view, there are more than hundreds of active compounds and
these compounds, including saponins, polysaccharides and isoﬂavones, might contribute to the bioactivities of Astragali Radix
(Sinclair, 1998; Yang et al., 2013). For example, astragaliside IV, a
representative saponin compound, has the properties of antioxidant and anti-inﬂammation that contribute to the reduction of
infarct volume and protection of the BBB integrity against cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion injury (Luo et al., 2004; Qu et al., 2009;
Li et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013). It is interesting to further explore the
active compounds from Astragali Radix with the neuroprotective
potentials. In the active compounds from Astragali Radix, isoﬂavones are relatively easier to across BBB than saponins and
polysaccharides. As typical natural antioxidants, the Astragali Radix
isoﬂavones are commonly used as food supplements (Messina,
2010; Romani et al., 2010). Calycosin, one of the isoﬂavones in
Astragali Radix, was recently reported to signiﬁcantly ameliorate
neurologic deﬁcit and infarct volume in experimental cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion injury (Guo et al., 2012). Calycosin-7-O–β–
D–glucoside (CG, the structure is shown in Fig. 1) is a calycosin
derivative compound isolated from Astragali Radix. CG is relatively
easier to get access to brain parenchyma than calycosin in

693

pharmacokinetics. In previous studies, CG revealed anti-oxidative
activities of scavenging DPPH radicals (Yu et al., 2005a, 2005b) and
cytoprotective effects in lipopolysaccharide-treated RAW 264.7
macrophages (Zhang et al., 2011) and L-glutamate-treated PC12
cells (Yu et al., 2005a). However, whether CG has neuroprotective
effects on BBB permeability is unknown yet. In present study, we
tested the hypothesis that CG could protect the BBB integrity
through modulating NO/cav-1/MMP pathway in focal cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion injury.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Middle cerebral artery occlusion model and drug treatment
Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats (250–270 g) were obtained
from Laboratorial Animal Unit, the University of Hong Kong (HKU).
All of animal experiments were approved and regulated by the
Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research,
HKU. We conducted middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
experiments to induce cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury in
rats as previously described (Shen et al., 2006). Brieﬂy, rats were
anaesthetized by inhalation of 5% isoﬂurane and maintained with
2% isoﬂurane in a mixture of 70% N2O and 30% O2. After vessels
isolation, a 3/0 monoﬁlament nylon suture (Johnson & Johnson, NJ,
USA) was inserted into the external carotid artery and advanced
into the internal carotid artery and anterior cerebral artery to
occlude the middle cerebral artery. After operation, rats were
transferred to intensive care incubator in which the temperature
was kept at 37 1C until animals woke up completely. The suture
was removed after 2 h occlusion to induce reperfusion.
CG was isolated from crude extract of Astragali Radix and
identiﬁed with HPLC at the purity of 99%. CG was dissolved in
DMSO (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and diluted with peanut oil.
Animals were divided into three groups: sham operation group,
MCAO group, and MCAO plus CG treatment group. In MCAO plus
CG group, the rats were intraperitoneally (i.p.) administrated with
26.8 mg/kg CG at 15 min before suture insertion. Sham operated
and MCAO rats were administrated with same volume of peanut
oil plus DMSO as the vehicle control.
2.2. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of histology section
To investigate the long-term neuroprotective effects of CG, we
observed histological integrity and tissue damage in the rat brains
after subjected to 2 h of ischemia plus 14 days of reperfusion
by using Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. In the drug
treatment group, the rats were i.p. administered with 26.8 mg/kg
CG 15 min before suture insertion and then once daily. After
ischemia–reperfusion treatment, rat brains were isolated and
the brain sections were stained by the combination of Mayer's
Hematoxylin and 0.5% aqueous eosin (Sigma). With this method,
nucleus and other acidic structures are stained to be blue, while
cytoplasm is stained to be red. Images were acquired using light
microscope (Leica, Germany).
2.3. Measurement of infarct volume

Fig. 1. Chemical structure of Calycosin-7-O-β-D-glucoside (CG).

After 2 h ischemia plus 24 h reperfusion, rat brains were
isolated and sliced into ﬁve coronal sections (2 mm thick) and
stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma)
for 10 min at room temperature. Infarct area was evaluated
by calculating the hemispheric lesion area with Image J-1.38x
software (Image J, MD, USA). The relative infarction volume
percentage (RIVP) was calculated as RIVP ¼IVA/TA  100%, where

694

S. Fu et al. / Journal of Ethnopharmacology 155 (2014) 692–701

IVA was the total infarcted area of ﬁve coronal sections while TA
was the total area of ﬁve sections.

2.9. Cell culture and oxygen-glucose deprivation

The BBB permeability was evaluated by measuring the extravasation of Evans blue. Brieﬂy, 2% Evans blue was intravenously
injected (2 ml/kg, Sigma) at 1 h before sacriﬁce followed by
transcardially perfused with saline to remove the intravascular
dye from the vessels until the drainage was colorless. After that,
ipsilateral hemisphere was removed and incubated in N,N0 dimethyl formamide (Sigma) in 60 1C water bath for 24 h. Evans
blue content was determined in supernatants at 632 nm using
a spectrophometer (Analytica Jena, Germany). Gradient concentrations of Evans blue were used to build standard curve to
quantify the Evans blue retention in the hemisphere.

Mouse microvascular endothelial cell line bEnd.3 was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured with high
glucose DMEM medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum and 100 μg/ml antibiotic mixtures (Invitrogen).
Endothelial cells were allowed to grow to conﬂuence before
being exposed to oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) treatment.
In brief, conﬂuent bEnd.3 cells were subjected to OGD treatment
to mimic ischemic condition by transferring cultures to glucosefree medium pre-equilibrated with 95% N2 and 5% CO2 for 6 h. The
oxygen concentration was o 1% as monitored by an oxygen
analyzer (Sable Systems, Las Vegas, NV, USA). Immediately after
OGD with or without CG treatment, the conditioned media were
collected for determination of the MMPs activity and the rate of
cell death.

2.5. in situ zymography

2.10. NO detection

Gelatinolytic activities of MMP-2/9 in cryo-sections from brains
were analyzed by in situ zymography using an EnzCheck collagenase kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Brain sections were incubated for 2 h at 37 1C
in a reaction buffer containing 40 μg/ml of FITC-labeled DQgelatin. Gelatinase cleaved DG-gelatin to yield the peptides and
form the ﬂuorescence as the representatives of the net gelatinolytic activity. The ﬂuorescent imaging was observed by using
ﬂuorescence microscopy (Zeiss, Germany).

The scavenging effects of CG on NO production were investigated. The bEnd.3 cells were treated with 0.1 mM DETA/NO (NO
donor, Cayman Chemical, Ann Harbor, MI, USA) and 2 μM CG or
DMSO for 45 min. Intracellular NO level was stained by using NO
speciﬁc ﬂuorescent probe 4, 5-diaminoﬂuorescein diacetate (DAF2DA, Sigma). Fluorescent imaging was captured by using Carl Zeiss
Real-time Fluorescence Imaging System.

2.6. Immunoﬂuorescent staining

After OGD treatment, the rate of cell death was quantitatively
measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay using
a CytoTox 96 Nonradioactive Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). The reconstituted substrate mixture (50 μl)
was added to each well of the plate with the same volume of
cultured media. The absorbance was measured at 490 nm in a
microplate reader 15 min later. Triton-X 100-treated cell medium
was marked as 100% of cell death. The rate of cell death was
calculated by using the formula: Cell death percentage (%) ¼
(Experimental absorbance value  culture medium absorbance
value)/(Triton-X 100-treated absorbance value  culture medium
absorbance value)  100%.

2.4. Evaluation of BBB permeability

Immunoﬂuorescent staining was applied to detect MMP-9, cav-1,
claudin-5 and zonula occluden (ZO)-1 in coronal cryo-sections of the
brain tissues. After blocking, sections were incubated overnight at
4 1C with primary antibodies including MMP-9 (1:100, Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany), cav-1 (1:500, Cell signaling, Boston, MA,
USA), claudin-5 (1:200, Invitrogen) or ZO-1 (1:100, Invitrogen). After
rinsing in PBS, slides were incubated with an appropriate Alexa 568
goat anti-mouse (1:500, Invitrogen) or Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit
secondary antibody (1:500, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature.
Sections were mounted with an anti-fade ﬂuorescence mounting
medium (Dako, Denmark). Images were acquired using ﬂuorescent
microscope at a constant exposure.
2.7. Isolation of cortical microvessels
The cortical microvessels were isolated to examine the proteins
expression levels in microvessels. The minced cortex was digested
with 1 mg/ml collagens II (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ, USA) in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagles Medium (DMEM, Nitrogen) in a shaking incubator for 1.5 h at 37 C. Digested tissues were then
separated by centrifugation in 20% bovine serum albumin (Sigma)
(1000g, 20 min), and the micro vessels were obtained in the pellet.
2.8. Western blot analysis
Denatured protein samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and
transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
After blocking, membrane was incubated overnight at 4 1C with
antibodies including MMP-9 (1:200, Merck), MMP-2 (1:1000,
Merck), cav-1 (1:1000, cell signaling) or claudin-5 (1:400, Nitrogen), followed by incubation with the goat anti-mouse or antirabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000, Santa Cruz,
Billerica, MA, USA). Chemiluminescence detection was performed
using ECL advance Western blotting detection reagents (GE
healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK).

2.11. Lactate dehydrogenase release assay.

2.12. Gel gelatin zymography in culture media
MMPs activity was measured by gel gelatin zymography.
In brief, equal amounts of culture media were concentrated with
gelatin-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare, UK) and MMP proteins
were then eluted from gelatin beads by incubating with elution
buffer (10% DMSO in PBS) and electrophoretically separated on
10% SDS-PAGE copolymerized with 1 mg/ml gelatin (Sigma) under
non-reducing condition. After washing with 2.5% Triton X-100 to
remove SDS, the gel was incubated for 24 h with a developing
buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM NaCl, and 0.02%
(w/v) Brij-35 (Sigma) at 37 1C before staining with 0.125% Coomassie Blue R-250. A mixture of human MMP-2/9 (Millipore) was
used as gelatinase standards.
2.13. Statistics analysis
Data were expressed as means 7standard deprivation (SD).
For multiple groups designed experiments, comparisons were
made by one-way analysis of variance and followed by Dunnett
test for two group comparison within the multiple groups. For two
groups designed experiments, comparisons were determined
using unpaired Student's t-test. Statistic analysis was performed
in the SPSS 16.0 statistical program (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

3. Results

in the ischemic zone. The MCAO plus CG treatment group revealed
much better histological integrity and less tissue damages than
MCAO vehicle group. These results indicate that CG has potent
short-term and long-term neuroprotective effects against cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion injury.

3.1. CG treatment dramatically decreased infarct size and tissue
damage during cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury

3.2. CG treatment rescued the BBB integrity during cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion injury

We ﬁrstly used TTC staining to investigate the effects of CG
on reducing infarct volume in experimental cerebral ischemia–
reperfusion injury. Rats were subjected to 2 h MCAO cerebral
ischemia plus 24 h of reperfusion. The data are schematically
shown in Fig. 2A and B. MCAO vehicle group had the infarct
volume in the ischemic brains up to 30.677 3.51%. In contrast,
MCAO with CG treatment group (26.8 mg/kg, i.p.) had dramatically
reduced infarct volume (8.68 73.09%). The results suggest that CG
has neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia–reperfusion
injury. We also investigated the long-term neuroprotection of CG
treatment by detecting histological changes with H&E staining in
the ischemic brains after the rats were exposed to 2 h ischemia
plus 14 days of reperfusion. Representative results are shown in
Fig. 2C. The MCAO vehicle group had serious histological damage

BBB permeability is the hallmark of brain damages during
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury. BBB hyper-permeability
contributes to infarct volume, brain edema, hemorrhage and brain
damage (Obermeier et al., 2013). We investigated the effects of CG
on protecting the BBB integrity in the rat brains after subjected to
2 h MCAO ischemia plus 24 h reperfusion by using Evans blue
extravasation assay. The results revealed that the MCAO vehicle
group had high BBB permeability up to 7.37 1.10 μg/g whereas
MCAO plus CG treatment group had signiﬁcantly reduced
BBB permeability than MCAO vehicle control group showing
2.88 70.32 μg/g (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, we investigated the effects
of CG on the expression of ZO-1 and claudin-5— two representative TJ proteins in brain endothelial cells and essential components
for the BBB integrity. Immunoﬂuorescent studies and Western blot

analysis revealed the decreased expressions of ZO-1 and claudin-5
in the ischemic zones of the brain tissues in the MCAO vehicle
group (Fig. 3B–F). Consistently, CG secured the expression of ZO-1

and claudin-5 in the ischemia–reperfused brains (Fig. 3B–F). Those
results suggest that CG can maintain the BBB integrity through
protecting TJ proteins during cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury.

3.3. CG treatment inhibited the expression and activities of MMPs in
ischemic brain during cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury
MMPs activation and secondary impairment of TJ proteins are
the main pathological processes contributing to BBB leakage (Liu
and Rosenberg, 2005). MMP-9 is one of the biomarkers of BBB
disruption in ischemic stroke (Aoki et al., 2002). Subsequently, we
investigated the expression of MMP-9 and activation of MMPs in
the ischemic brain sections and the expressions of MMP-2 and -9
in cortical microvessels isolated from the ischemic hemisphere
after the rats were subjected to 2 h of ischemia plus 24 h of
reperfusion. As shown in Fig. 4, the MCAO vehicle group had
higher MMP-9 level in the ischemic brain tissues and elevated
MMPs activities in the ischemic brain microvessels than sham
control group (Fig. 4A–D). Importantly, MCAO plus CG treatment
group had signiﬁcant lower MMPs activities and the downregulated expressions of MMP-2 and -9 than MCAO vehicle group
(Fig. 4A–C and E–G). These results suggest that CG has the
inhibitive effects on the expression and activities of MMPs during
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury.
3.4. CG treatment secured cav-1 expression in rat cortical
microvessels during cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury
Cav-1 is one of the critical signaling molecules in regulating
BBB integrity through inhibiting NO production and MMPs activation ( Shen et al., 2006; Gu et al., 2012). Cav-1 knockout mice had
higher BBB permeability during cerebral ischemia–reperfusion

injury (Gu et al., 2012). Therefore, we investigated the expression
of cav-1 in the cortical microvessels isolated from the brains of
sham control, MCAO vehicle and MCAO plus CG groups. As shown
in Fig. 5, the MCAO vehicle group had signiﬁcant lower expression
levels of cav-1 in the brain microvessels than sham control group
(Fig. 4A, B and D). However, MCAO plus CG group had remarkably
higher expression levels of cav-1 in the brain microvessels than
MCAO vehicle group (Fig. 4A, C and E), indicating that CG can
secure cav-1 expression in brain microvessels during cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion injury.
3.5. CG direct scavenged NO, inhibited MMPs activity and attenuated
cell death in brain microvascular endothelial cells under OGD
condition
NO/cav-1/MMPs pathway is a critical therapeutic target for
protecting the BBB integrity against cerebral ischemia–reperfusion
injury (Shen et al., 2006; Gu et al., 2012). In order to clarify the
mechanisms of CG in protecting BBB integrity, we designed
following in vitro experiments: (1) exploring the scavenging effects
of CG on NO in brain microvascular endothelial cells treated with
NO donor; (2) evaluating the effects of CG on inhibiting the
activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and reducing cell death in brain
microvascular endothelial cells under OGD condition. In the ﬁrst
experiment, bEnd.3 cells were treated with NO donor DETA/NO
and the level of NO was detected by using DAF-2DA, a NO speciﬁc
cell-permeable probe. As shown in Fig. 6A and B, treatment of
2 μM CG remarkably inhibited the ﬂuorescent intensity of NO in

the DETA/NO-treated bEnd.3 cells indicating that CG has direct NO
scavenging effect. In the second experiment, the bEnd.3 cells were
exposed to OGD for 6 h and the expressions of MMP-2, -9 were
detected with gelatin zymography and the rate of cell death was
detected with LDH release assay. As shown in Fig. 6C and D, 2 μM
CG treatment remarkably inhibited the elevated activities of MMP2 and MMP-9 and the higher rate of cell death of bEnd.3 cells
exposed to 6 h of OGD (Fig. 6C–E). These results, when taken
together, suggest that CG could scavenge NO, inhibit MMPs and
protect brain microvascular endothelial cells under OGD condition,
contributing to the protection of the BBB integrity during cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion injury.

4. Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time to report that calycosin7-O-β-D-glucoside, an isoﬂavone isolated from Astragali Radix, has

neuroprotective effects on rescuing TJ proteins and maintaining
BBB integrity in cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury through
regulating NO/cav-1/MMPs signaling pathway. The study not only
brings better understanding of the neuroprotective mechanisms of
calycosin against cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury but also
advances current knowledge about the active ingredients of
Astragali Radix with neuroprotective effects.
A recent study reported that calycosin ameliorated neurologic
deﬁcit and reduced infarct volume in experimental cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion model (Guo et al., 2012). In fact, CG is
originally biologically inactive but it can be hydrolyzed to form
non-glycoside compound after absorption to perform its bioactivities (Rice-Evans, 2004). CG has better bioavailability than calycosin because of its glucoside group in the structure. Thus, CG was
used in our study. Based on our pilot study, we selected the dose of
26.8 mg/kg for this study and CG was intraperitoneally injected
into the rats. In order to test the short-term and long-term
neuroprotective effects of CG, we designed the MCAO cerebral

700

ischemic models with 2 h cerebral ischemia plus 24 h reperfusion
and 2 h ischemia plus 14 days reperfusion respectively. The results
showed that CG treatment signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume in
the rat brains after being exposed to 2 h MCAO ischemia plus 24 h
reperfusion. The results are consistent with the previous study
(Guo et al., 2012). Importantly, we found the long-term protecting
effects of CG on ischemic brain tissues. After the rats were
subjected to 2 h of MCAO ischemia plus 14 days of reperfusion,
CG treatment group had much less histological damage in the
ischemic zone than MCAO vehicle group. Given that stroke victims
generally have long-term disability, our study provides experimental evidence to support the relative long-term applications of
CG for cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury.
The most notable discovery is the protective effects of CG on
BBB integrity in cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury. BBB plays
crucial roles in maintaining immune quiescence of central nervous
system. During cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury, when BBB
breakdown is induced, toxic substances from blood can easily get
access to brain parenchyma through leaky BBB, leading to infarct
volume enlargement (Gu et al., 2014). CG treatment secured the
expression of ZO-1 and claudin-5, and decreased BBB permeability
in the ischemia–reperfused rat brains, suggesting that maintaining
BBB integrity could contribute to the neuroprotective mechanisms
of CG against cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury.
NO/cav-1/MMPs pathway is a critical therapeutic target for
protecting the BBB integrity against cerebral ischemia–reperfusion
injury (Shen et al., 2006; Gu et al., 2012). Elevated MMPs activity is
a typical molecular event in the impairment of TJs and the
associated dysfunction of the BBB. MMPs activation is responsible
for the rapid degradation of TJ proteins and the extracellular
matrix around cerebral blood vessels, astrocytes and neurons.
NO can mediate the activation of MMPs, degradation of TJ proteins
and BBB breakdown in cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury (Park
et al., 2006). In the process, the loss of cav-1 is a key in the
activation of MMPs and BBB breakdown (Shen et al., 2006; Gu
et al., 2012). The interaction of NO, cav-1 and MMPs could amplify
and aggravate the BBB dysfunction. Thus, we hypothesized that
NO/cav-1/MMPs signaling pathway could be a crucial target in the
BBB protecting effects of CG. The in vitro experiments revealed that
CG remarkably inhibited NO-induced DAF-2DA ﬂuorescence in the
DETA/NO-treated bEnd.3 cells, verifying its NO scavenging
property. Meanwhile, CG treatment inhibited the expressions of
MMP-2 and MMP-9 and reduced the rate of cell death of brain
microvascular endothelial cells under OGD condition. Moreover,
in vivo MCAO ischemia–reperfusion experiments showed that CG
treatment inhibited the expression and activities of MMPs, upregulated the expression of cav-1, rescued the loss ZO-1 and
occludin, and ﬁnally kept BBB integrity in the ischemic rat brains.
Taken together, we conclude that CG could protect the BBB
integrity and its mechanism could be attributed to the regulation
of NO/cav-1/MMP signaling cascades against cerebral ischemia–
reperfusion injury. In addition, we should note that the mechanisms of BBB disruption are complex. Multiple pathological factors
are involved in the pathological process. For example, many
inﬂammation factors contribute to BBB breakdown and neuronal
injury produced during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (Gu
et al., 2014). Targeting neuroinﬂammation could be an important
therapeutic strategy for protecting neurovascular unit and attenuating ischemic brain injury (Liu et al., 2010, 2011). Whether CG
inhibits the inﬂammation during ischemic stroke remains to be
further explored.
Last but not least, given that Astragali Radix is a commonly used
herbal medicine for the treatment of ischemic stroke patients in
Traditional Chinese Medicine and CG is one of the active compounds isolated from Astragali Radix, those results could be used to
understand the antioxidant and neuroprotective mechanisms of

Astragali Radix. It is notable that Astragali Radix contains multiple
active compounds and we could not ignore the contributions of
other active compounds to the protection of BBB integrity during
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury. For instance, astragaliside IV,
a representative saponin compound, was reported to have antioxidant and anti-inﬂammation effects and it was shown to reduce
infarct volume and protect the BBB integrity in various experimental cerebral ischemia–reperfusion models ( Luo et al., 2004;
Qu et al., 2009; Li et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013). Therefore, we should
pay more attention to the synergetic actions of the active
compounds in the medicinal herb against cerebral ischemia–
reperfusion injury in future. Finally, calycosin and its glucoside
derivatives are common isoﬂavone compounds existing in
many medicinal herbs and also used as food supplement; our
study extends their clinical application potentials for post-stroke
treatment.
