Astrocytes respond to ischemic brain injury by proliferation, the increased expression of intermediate filaments and hypertrophy, which results in glial scar formation. In addition, they alter the expression of ion channels, receptors and transporters
that maintain ionic/neurotransmitter homeostasis. Here, we aimed to demonstrate the expression of Hcn1–4 genes encoding
hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels in reactive astrocytes following focal cerebral ischemia
(FCI) or global cerebral ischemia (GCI) and to characterize their functional properties. A permanent occlusion of the middle
cerebral artery (MCAo) was employed to induce FCI in adult GFAP/EGFP mice, while GCI was induced by transient bilateral
common carotid artery occlusion combined with hypoxia in adult rats. Using FACS, we isolated astrocytes from non-injured or
ischemic brains and performed gene expression profiling using single-cell RT-qPCR. We showed that 2 weeks after ischemia
reactive astrocytes express high levels of Hcn1–4 transcripts, while immunohistochemical analyses confirmed the presence of
HCN1–3 channels in reactive astrocytes 5 weeks after ischemia. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that post-ischemic
astrocytes are significantly depolarized, and compared with astrocytes from non-injured brains, they display large
hyperpolarization-activated inward currents, the density of which increased 2–3-fold in response to ischemia. Their activation
was facilitated by cAMP and their amplitudes were decreased by ZD7288 or low extracellular Na1 concentration, suggesting
that they may belong to the family of HCN channels. Collectively, our results demonstrate that regardless of the type of
ischemic injury, reactive astrocytes express HCN channels, which could therefore be an important therapeutic target in poststroke therapy.

Introduction

F

ollowing central nervous system (CNS) injury astrocytes
undergo changes in their morphology as well as functional properties. Within several days, they transform into
reactive astrocytes, which are characterized by hypertrophied
morphology and the increased expression of glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin and nestin; moreover, a subset of astrocytes starts to proliferate. The functions of reactive
astrocytes are numerous and diverse. They modulate the

inflammatory response, produce molecules of extracellular
matrix (Ridet et al., 1997), reduce the impact of ionic imbalance and separate healthy tissue from the core of the injury,
thus preventing the propagation of seizure activity from the
injured to the healthy tissue (Faulkner, 2004; Sofroniew and
Vinters, 2009). Some of these functions directly depend on
the composition of the ion channels in the astrocytic cytoplasmic membrane, which substantially change in response to
CNS injury. A large number of studies has described marked

changes in the expression of different K1 channels (Perillan
et al., 2000; Kang et al., 2008; Lichter-Konecki et al., 2008)
in response to CNS pathology, with respect to the type of
CNS disorders, the proliferative activity of the astrocytes or
even their distance from the site of injury (for review see,
Chvatal et al., 2008). In addition, non-selective cationic channels, which are functionally coupled to sulfonylurea receptor
type 1, were identified in reactive astrocytes (Chen and
Simard, 2001; Chen et al., 2003). One of the potential candidates for nonspecific cationic influx into astrocytes is the family of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated
(HCN) channels, which were considered to be expressed only
in excitable cells; nevertheless, their transcripts have been
recently identified also in primary astrocytic cultures (Li
et al., 2011) and adult post-ischemic astrocytes (Rusnakova
et al., 2013). This family of channels is coded by four genes,
Hcn1–4, which were cloned a decade ago (Marx et al., 1999),
and their protein products can form homotetramers as well as
heterotetramers in the cell membrane. They are primarily permeable for Na1 and K1 in the ratio 1:4 (Biel et al., 2009;
Wahl-Schott and Biel, 2008). Their expression and function
has been described in neurons, where they are activated at
hyperpolarized membrane potentials, and HCN2 and HCN4
are modulated by the direct binding of cAMP as a response
to hormones or neurotransmitters. In neurons, they stabilize
the membrane potential and are involved in the process of
dendritic integration, constraining long-term potentiation and
playing an important role in synaptic transmission (Lewis and
Chetkovich, 2011). One of the most important features of
HCN channels is their contribution to membrane potential
oscillations in neuronal or cardiac cells (Biel et al., 2009;
Wahl-Schott and Biel, 2008).
In this study we aimed to detect the expression of
HCN channels in cortical or hippocampal astrocytes under
physiological as well as ischemic conditions employing permanent focal cerebral ischemia in adult GFAP/EGFP mice or
transient global cerebral ischemia in adult rats. We performed
single-cell RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry and the patch–
clamp recordings to characterize the HCN channels in postischemic astrocytes in both types of ischemic injury on
mRNA, protein and functional levels.

Materials and Methods
Induction of Focal Cerebral Ischemia (FCI) in Adult
GFAP/EGFP Mice
All procedures involving the use of laboratory animals were performed
in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive 24
November 1986 (86/609/EEC) and animal care guidelines approved
by the Institute of Experimental Medicine, Academy of Sciences of
the Czech Republic (Animal Care Committee on April 7, 2011;
approval number 018/2011). All efforts were made to minimize both

the suffering and the number of animals used. Experiments were performed on Wistar rats, GFAP/EGFP transgenic mice [line designation
TgN(GFAP-EGFP)], in which the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is controlled by the human GFAP promoter
(Nolte et al., 2001) and on Tg(Slc1a3-cre/ERT)1Nat/J/B6;129S6Gt(ROSA)26Sortm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J (Slc1a3/Tomato) transgenic mice
(Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, USA).
Prior to the induction of focal ischemia, 50-day-old mice were
anaesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane (Abbot, Illinois, USA) and maintained in 1% isoflurane using a vaporizer (Tec-3, Cyprane, Keighley,
UK). A skin incision between the orbit and the external auditory
meatus was made, and a 1–2 mm hole was drilled through the frontal bone 1 mm rostral to the fusion of the zygoma and the squamosal bone and about 3.5 mm ventrally to the dorsal surface of the
brain. The middle cerebral artery (MCA) was exposed after the dura
was opened and removed. The MCA was occluded by short coagulation with bipolar tweezers (SMT, Czech Republic) at a proximal
location, followed by transection of the vessel to ensure permanent
occlusion. During the surgery, body temperature was maintained at
37 6 1 C using a heating pad. Sham-operated animals (controls)
were subjected to the same surgery procedure, without dura opening
and vessel occlusion. The numbers of mice used in the experiments
were 19 in the control group (RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry,
electrophysiology), four animals at 7 days (D7) after FCI (RTqPCR), five animals at 2 weeks (2W) after FCI (RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology) and 22 animals at 5 weeks
(5W) after FCI (immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology). This
MCA occlusion (MCAo) model yields small infarct lesions in the
cortical region (Honsa et al., 2012, 2013).

Induction of Global Cerebral Ischemia (GCI) in Adult
Rats
Wistar rats (males, 7-9-week-old, 220–260 g) were premedicated
with atropin (100 lg/kg, s.c.; Biotika, Slovak Republic) and anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (PTB; 65 mg/kg, i.p.). The rats
were intubated using a cannula tube (Abbocath-T 16G, Abbott,
Sligo, Ireland) and connected to a mechanical ventilator [33.3% O2
and 66.6% N2; rate 60 cycles/minutes (min); animal ventilator CIV101, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA] with an appropriate stroke volume to maintain normocapnia. Both common
carotid arteries were exposed and occluded for 15 min using aneurism clips. During occlusion, rats were concurrently ventilated with
6% O2 and 94% N2 (Linde Gas, Prague, Czech Republic) as
described previously (Anderova et al., 2010; Pivonkova et al., 2010).
The core temperature was maintained at 37 C with a heating pad
throughout the procedure and recovery from anesthesia. After the
operation, the rats were injected with 2 mL saline s.c. in the hip
area to prevent dehydration. They were left to survive (reperfusion
period) for 2 or 5W prior to sacrifice. The animals were housed
individually and allowed food and water ad libitum. Controls
received exactly the same surgical procedure without artery
occlusion. The numbers of rats used in the experiments were 23 in
the
control
group
(RT-qPCR,
immunohistochemistry,
electrophysiology), 2 animals at 2W after GCI (RT-qPCR) and 17
animals at 5W after GCI (RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry,

2005

electrophysiology). GCI induced by bilateral common carotid artery
occlusion and concurrent hypoxia triggered pyramidal cell damage
and the formation of a glial scar in the CA1 region of the
hippocampus.

Preparation of a Single Cell Suspension from the
Mouse Cortex or Rat Hippocampus
A 50-day-old mice (control) or mice D7 or 2W after FCI were
deeply anesthetized with PTB (100 mg/kg, i.p.), and perfused transcardially with cold (4–8 C) isolation buffer containing (in mM):
NaCl 136.0, KCl 5.4, Hepes 10.0, glucose 5.5, osmolality 290 6 3
mOsmol/kg. The forebrain was isolated by the removal of the olfactory lobes, the cerebellum, and the midbrain/hindbrain structures by
dissection. To isolate the cerebral cortex, the brain (12 to 22 mm
from bregma) was sliced into 600 mm coronal sections using a
vibrating microtome HM650V (MICROM International GmbH,
Germany), and the dorsal cerebral cortex was carefully dissected out
from the ventral white matter tracks.
Adult control rats or rats 2W after GCI were deeply anesthetized with PTB (100 mg/kg, i.p.), and perfused transcardially with
cold (4–8 C) isolation buffer. To isolate the hippocampus, the brain
(22 to 26 mm from bregma) was sliced into 600 mm coronal sections and the hippocampus was carefully dissected.
The collected tissues were incubated with continuous shaking
at 37 C for 60 min in 5 mL of papain solution (20 U/mL) and
0.2 mL DNase (both from Worthington, NJ) prepared in isolation
buffer. After papain treatment, the tissue was mechanically dissociated by gentle trituration using a 1 mL pipette. Dissociated cells
were layered on the top of 5 mL of Ovomucoid inhibitor solution
(Worthington) and harvested by centrifugation (140 3 g for 6 min).
This method routinely yielded 2 3 106 cells per mouse or rat
brain. Cell aggregates were removed by filtering with 30 mm cell
strainers (Becton Dickinson, NJ), and the cells were kept on ice
until sorting.

Collection of Single Cells
Single cells were sorted using flow cytometry (FACS; BD Influx, San
Jose, CA). The flow cytometer was manually calibrated to deposit a
single cell in the centre of each collection tube. Hoechst 33258 (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was added to the suspension of cells to
check viability. Single cells were collected into 96-well plates (Life
Technologies) containing 5 lL nuclease-free water with bovine serum
albumin (1 mg/lL, Fermentas, Rockford, IL) and RNaseOut 20 U
(Life Technologies). The plates were placed on a pre-cooled rack.
The mouse cells were collected based on EGFP or Tomato fluorescence and viability. We tested the rate of contamination with nonfluorescent cells and determined that only 6.4% of the collected cells
expressed microglial or neuronal markers.
The rat cells were collected based on size and viability. Cells
collected in 96-well plates were immediately placed at 280 C.

Single-Cell Gene Expression Profiling of Mouse
Astrocytes
The steps of gene expression analysis of mouse astrocytes followed
the protocol described in (Rusnakova et al., 2013). Briefly, RNA

2006

from single cells was transcribed into cDNA directly in the wells of
96-well plates. Samples were divided into two aliquots. The first aliquots were used for pre-testing, where the expression of two astrocytic markers was determined (Slc1a3 and Glul). Only cells
expressing at least one marker were selected for further analysis. To
increase the sensitivity of RT-qPCR, the second aliquots of cDNA
from preselected cells were first preamplified. Subsequently, such preprocessed samples were analyzed for the expression of 14 genes of
interest (Table 1) using the BioMark qPCR platform (Fluidigm, San
Francisco, CA). All qPCR reactions were run in technical duplicates.
Data were analysed in GenEx software (MultiD, Sweden).

Single-Cell Gene Expression Profiling of Rat
Astrocytes
cDNA synthesis was performed as described in Benesova et al.
(2012). The total volume of cDNA was divided into two aliquots.
The first aliquot was diluted fourfold and used in qPCR to determine Gfap expression. This expression served as a marker for the
identification of astrocytes. The second aliquot of cDNA was used
to determine Hcn1–4 expression in Gfap-positive cells. To increase
the sensitivity of RT-qPCR, the cDNA was first preamplified using
the protocol described in (Rusnakova et al., 2013). Instead of using
primer mix for 48 genes, a mix containing primers for 9 genes
(Table 2) was used. Preamplified cDNA was diluted fourfold and
used in qPCR to determine Hcn1–4 expression. Primer design as
well as qPCR were performed according to the protocol described in
(Benesova et al., 2012). All qPCR reactions were run in technical
duplicates. Data were pre-processed and analyzed in GenEx software
(MultiD).

Immunohistochemistry and Cell Identification
For immunohistochemical analyses, animals were deeply anesthetized
with PTB (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused transcardially with 20 mL
(mouse) or 100 mL (rat) of saline followed by 20 mL (mouse) or
200 mL (rat) of cooled 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB). Brains were dissected out, post-fixed for 3 h (for
anti-HCN4 antibody) or overnight (for anti-HCN1–3) with PFA
and treated with a sucrose gradient (10–20–30%) for cryoprotection.
Coronal 20 or 40 lm thick slices were prepared using a microtome
(HM400, Thermo Scientific Microm, Germany) or a cryostat (Leica
CM1850, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), respectively. To
facilitate cell identification after the patch–clamp experiments, the
recorded cells were dialyzed with the patch pipette solution containing Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 hydrazide. The slices were fixed postrecording with 4% PFA in 0.1 M PB for 1 h and then kept at 4 C
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For immunohistochemical staining, the slices were washed in PBS followed by blocking of the nonspecific binding sites with 5% Chemiblocker (Millipore, Billerica,
MA) and 0.2% Triton in PBS. The blocking solution was also used
as the diluent for the antisera. The slices were incubated with the
primary antibodies at 4–8 C overnight, and the secondary antibodies
were applied for 2 h. The following primary antibodies were used:
rabbit anti-HCN1 (1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit antiHCN2 (1:200; Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel), rabbit anti-HCN3
(1:200; Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA), rabbit anti-HCN4 (1:200,

equipped with Ar/HeNe lasers and 403 or 633 oil objectives was
used for immunohistochemical analysis. Stacks of consecutive confocal images taken at intervals of 1 lm were acquired sequentially with
the two lasers to avoid crosstalk between fluorescent labels. The
background noise of each confocal image was reduced by averaging
four image inputs. Colocalization images and maximum z projection
images were made using Zeiss LSM Image Browser.

Preparation of Acute Brain Slices
The rats or mice were deeply anesthetized with PTB (100 mg/kg,
i.p.) and perfused transcardially with cold (4 C) isolation solution
containing (in mM): 110 NMDG-Cl, 3 KCl, 23 NaHCO3, 1.25
Na2HPO4, 0.5 CaCl2, 7 MgCl2, 20 glucose, osmolality 290 mOsm/
kg. The animals were decapitated, the brains were quickly dissected
out and transversal 200 lm thick slices were cut using a vibrating
microtome. The slices were incubated for 30 min at 34 C in the isolation solution and then transferred to aCSF containing (in mM):
122 NaCl, 3 KCl, 28 NaHCO3, 1.25 Na2HPO4, 1.5 CaCl2, 1.3
MgCl2, 10 glucose, osmolality 305 mOsm/kg, where they were
kept at room temperature for the duration of the experiments. Solutions were equilibrated with 95% O2/5% CO2 to a final pH of 7.4.
Osmolality was measured using a vapor pressure osmometer (Vapro
5520, Wescor, Logan, UT).

Patch–Clamp Recordings
Acute brain slices were gently transferred to a recording chamber
mounted on the stage of an upright microscope (Axioscop, Carl
Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a high-resolution digital camera (AxioCam HRc, Carl Zeiss) and electronic micromanipulators (Luigs & Neumann, Ratingen, Germany). The chamber was
constantly perfused with oxygenated aCSF at a rate of 5 mL/min.
All electrophysiological measurements were done at room temperature. Patch–clamp recordings were performed in the whole-cell configuration in the voltage–clamp mode using an EPC-9 patch–clamp
amplifier in combination with TIDA software or an EPC-10 amplifier in combination with PATCHMASTER software (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany), as described previously
(Pivonkova et al., 2010). Patch pipettes were pulled (P-97 Flaming/
Brown Micropipette Puller, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) from
borosilicate capillaries (Sutter Instruments) and filled with an intracellular solution containing (in mM): 130 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 2
MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 hydrazide
(0.1 mM; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, NY); the final pH was
adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. The resistance of the pipettes was 7–10
MX. The resting membrane potential was measured by switching
the EPC amplifier to the current–clamp mode. The membrane
resistance was calculated from the current elicited by a 10 mV test
pulse depolarizing the cell membrane from the holding potential of
270 to 260 mV for 50 ms, at the end of the pulse. Membrane
capacitance (CM) was determined from the initial current transients
elicited by a 10 mV test pulse depolarizing the cell membrane from
270 to 260 mV, after compensating for the fast capacitive component by TIDA, or automatically from the LockIn protocol by
PATCHMASTER. The cells were clamped near their resting membrane potential, and the basic current patterns were obtained by

2008

stepping the membrane potential to values ranging from 2160 to
120 mV or 140 mV for 50 ms at 10 mV intervals. The
hyperpolarization-induced inward current was evoked by hyperpolarizing the cell membrane from 260 to 2160 mV for 1 s at 10 mV
intervals. The amplitude was determined at the end of the 2150
mV pulse, after an offline passive subtraction of the time- and
voltage-independent passive currents between 270 and 280 mV.
The drugs were applied via bath perfusion or directly into the
recording chamber. A cyclic nucleotide 8-bromoadenosine 30 ,50 -cyclic
monophosphate (cAMP) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich,
ZD7288 from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK) or Sigma Aldrich.

Statistics
The results are expressed as the mean 6 SEM. Statistical analyses of
the differences among groups were performed using one-way
ANOVA for multiple comparisons with Tukey’s post hoc test and
Student’s t test or pair test when appropriate. Values of P < 0.05
were considered significant, P < 0.01 very significant and P < 0.001
extremely significant.

Results
Reactive Astrocytes Express mRNA Coding HCN
Channels
The expression of transcripts for HCN channels is well documented in neurons throughout the entire mammalian brain
(Noebels et al., 2012); however, based on in vitro studies, also
glial cells, namely astrocytes, may express these channels (Li
et al., 2011). To detect the expression of Hcn genes in astrocytes, we used the transgenic GFAP/EGFP mouse strain, in
which only astrocytes and rarely polydendrocytes express
EGFP. Adult sham-operated males of this mouse strain were
used as controls and animals at two different time points after
FCI as ischemic animals. We prepared single cell suspensions
from the cerebral cortex (Fig. 1A), and using FACS, we collected only EGFP-positive (EGFP1) cells, which were analyzed for the expression of 12 genes using the BioMark qPCR
platform. Cells expressing only markers of polydendrocytes
(Cspg4, Pdgfra) were excluded, so we analyzed EGFP1 cells
with astrocytic markers, such as Aqp4, Slc1a3, Gfap, Glul.
The total numbers of collected and analyzed cells were 235
EGFP1 cells from control brains (5 animals), 183 EGFP1
cells from 7 days after FCI (4 animals) and 120 EGFP1 cells
from 14 days after FCI (3 animals).
In the adult mouse cerebral cortex approximately 5% of
these cells contained detectable level of mRNA for Hcn1 and
Hcn3, 12% expressed Hcn2 and in 17% of EGFP1 astrocytes, we detected mRNA for the Hcn4 channel (Fig. 1B);
nevertheless, their relative expression levels were very low in
astrocytes from control mice (Fig. 1C). To avoid the possibility that only a small fraction of all cortical astrocytes from
the GFAP/EGFP mouse strain was purified by FACS in the
control group, we used the Slc1a3/Tomato mouse strain, in

which almost 90% of Slc1a3 expressing astrocytes express
Tomato red fluorescent protein. Slc1a3 is a gene coding excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1), which is specifically
expressed in astrocytes and thereby labels a different and even
larger astrocytic population than that labeled in GFAP/EGFP
mice. We isolated and analyzed 47 cells from control uninjured mouse brain of which 89.4% expressed the astrocytic
markers Slc1a3 and Glul while only 10.6% expressed HCN
channel mRNA. Therefore, using another transgenic mouse
strain for the isolation of astrocytes proved that the low
expression of HCN channels in the control mouse brain was
not due to selecting a subpopulation of EGFP-positive cells
from GFAP/EGFP mice.
To determine whether the number of cells expressing
Hcn genes is influenced by FCI, we isolated EGFP1 cells
from the injured hemisphere 7 and 14 days after FCI. As
shown in Fig. 1B, the number of EGFP1 astrocytes expressing Hcn1, 2 genes markedly increased following ischemia and
reached approximately 30% of analyzed cells 2W after FCI
(Fig. 1B). Moreover, we analyzed the relative expression levels
of Hcn genes after ischemia and discovered a strong upregulation of Hcn1, 2, 3, and 4, especially 2W after FCI (Fig. 1C).
We can conclude that while D7 after ischemia significantly
more astrocytes started to express Hcn genes, 2W after ischemia reactive astrocytes significantly increased the relative
expression of Hcn genes.
Based on the above-described findings, a question arose
whether the strong expression of Hcn genes is a general/common feature of reactive astrocytes following different types of
ischemic injury. Therefore, another model of ischemia, a tranDecember 2014

sient global cerebral ischemia, was induced in adult Wistar
rats. Following GCI, astrocytes are activated, but in contrast
to FCI, these reactive astrocytes do not rebuild their processes
and they do not change their domains (Sofroniew and
Vinters, 2009). In view of the fact that GCI has a low reproducibility and a very low survival rate in mice (Thal et al.,
2010), we used rats for this part of the experiment. On the
other hand, we lost the advantage of sorting astrocytes based
on EGFP expression, since no transgenic rat strain with
astrocyte-specific EGFP expression is available. We prepared
single cell suspensions from the CA1 region–the most affected
part of the hippocampus (Anderova et al., 2010; Butenko
et al., 2012)—and collected all living cells into 96-well plates.
Based on Gfap expression, we identified 17 astrocytes among
the control cells, from which only 2 (12%) expressed Hcn
genes, while 2W after GCI we were able to collect 24 cells
with Gfap expression and 8 (33%) of them expressed Hcn
transcripts.
Based on these results we may conclude that cerebral
ischemia is characterized by the enhanced expression of Hcn
genes in reactive astrocytes; nevertheless, only the more severe
type of ischemia, such as FCI has a profound effect on Hcn
expression. Thus, the strong and frequent expression of these
channels may reflect the severity of the ischemic injury.
Immunohistochemical Identification of HCN
Channels in the Mouse Cortex After FCI
To confirm the expression of HCN channels in astrocytes in
the control brains and those after ischemia, we performed
immunohistochemical analyses of the cortex of non-injured
2009

mice and those 2W and 5W after ischemia. Although we
could identify astrocytes in the cortex of GFAP/EGFP mice
based on EGFP expression, we stained the sections with an
antibody against GFAP to distinguish weakly EGFP1 polydendrocytes from astrocytes. Since it is known that in the
GFAP/EGFP mouse strain a small subpopulation of GFAP2/
EGFP1 cells are predominantly polydendrocytes (Matthias
et al., 2003). HCN1 channel expression was generally very
weak in the control mouse cortex (Fig. 2A). In addition to
HCN11 neurons, several EGFP1/GFAP- cells also expressed
this protein, and based on their morphology and the absence
of GFAP expression we considered these cells as polydendrocytes. Almost no EGFP1 astrocytes in the control mouse cortex expressed HCN1. After 2 weeks of FCI, HCN1 protein
expression in GFAP1 astrocytes was comparably low as in
controls (data not shown), so we further analyzed later time
points after FCI. A significantly different expression pattern
was found in the astrogliotic tissue surrounding the ischemic
core 5W after FCI. At the site of the ischemic lesion, there
were numerous hypertrophic GFAP1 astrocytic processes,
many of which also expressed HCN1 channels (Fig. 2B).
HCN2 channels were strongly expressed in the cortical neurons of controls; however, in astrocytes located in the same
region we did not detect any HCN2 channels (Fig. 2C). After
5 weeks of FCI, HCN2 channels were present in several
hypertrophied astrocytic processes around the lesion site (Fig.
2D). The expression pattern of HCN3 channels in the control mouse cortex was very similar to that of HCN2, i.e. predominant localization in neuronal bodies and absence in
astrocytes (Fig. 2E). However, numerous reactive astrocytes in
the post-ischemic tissue strongly expressed HCN3 channels
(Fig. 2F). We also analyzed the expression of HCN channels
in the EGFP1 cells in the contralateral post-ischemic hemispheres, but we never detected the expression of any HCN
channels in EGFP1 cells in these regions. We were unable to
detect HCN4 channels in the cortical cells at any of the analyzed time points, and these channels were expressed only in
the subcortical regions (data not shown).
Immunohistochemical Identification of HCN
Channels in the Rat Hippocampus after GCI
To visualize and detect astrocytes in the rat hippocampus we
stained the sections with an antibody against GFAP. The
expression of HCN1 channels in the control rat hippocampus
was predominantly localized in neuronal cells and virtually
absent in astrocytes (Fig. 3A). In contrast, 5W after GCI the
expression of GFAP was significantly increased, and HCN1
channels were also found on the cell membrane of many reactive astrocytes (Fig. 3B). A very similar expression pattern was
found for HCN2 channels, which were expressed in neuronal
bodies in the stratum pyramidale in the hippocampus of con2010

trol rats (Fig. 3C); however, GCI induced only a slightly
increased expression of these channels in reactive astrocytes
(Fig. 3D). HCN3 channels showed strong expression in the
control hippocampus predominantly in the neurons (Fig. 3E),
and 5W after GCI reactive astrocytes in the vicinity of the
stratum pyramidale were HCN3-positive as well (Fig. 3F).
HCN4 channel expression was not found in either the control or the ischemic rat hippocampus (data not shown).
Taken together, our results from immunohistochemical
analyses confirmed the increased expression of HCN channels
in reactive astrocytes, predominantly at later time points after
both types of ischemic injury. Interestingly, although the
single-cell RT-qPCR analyses showed the increased expression
of Hcn1–3 mRNA in the mouse cortex after FCI, markedly
increased protein expression was confirmed only for the
HCN1 and HCN3 channels.
Membrane Properties of Astrocytes After FCI in
GFAP/EGFP Mice
Since we demonstrated the presence of HCN channels on the
mRNA as well as the protein level, we further focused on
their functional identification/characterization using the
patch–clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration. Initially, we recorded cortical astrocytes in mouse brain slices
that were identified based on their EGFP expression 2W after
FCI, but we did not find any significant evidence of HCN
channel presence or function at this time point. Therefore,
we performed further electrophysiological analyses on astrocytes at later time point, 5W after FCI, when strong protein
expression was detected. In controls, 100% of EGFP1 cells
displayed the membrane properties of mature astrocytes, i.e.
time- and voltage-independent symmetrical non-decaying passive currents (Fig. 4A top). In agreement with our previous
findings 5W after FCI, 70% of recorded EGFP1 cells were
passive astrocytes while the rest had membrane properties
attributed to polydendrocytes (Honsa et al., 2012). Cells displaying the membrane properties of polydendrocytes were
excluded from further data processing. The average resting
membrane potential (RMP) of astrocytes in controls was
268.7 6 1.8 mV (n 5 32), and it shifted to more positive
values of 253.7 6 1.6 mV; (n 5 16; P < 0.001) 5W after FCI
(Table 3). The astrocyte input resistance reached 115.4 6 9.5
MX (n 5 32) in controls and decreased to 74.4 6 6.1 MX
(n 5 16; P < 0.01) after FCI. Their membrane capacitance
increased from 15.1 6 3.2 pF (n 5 23) in controls to
44.1 6 10.2 pF (n 5 12; P < 0.01) after FCI (Table 3). Moreover, astrocytes 5W after FCI displayed hyperpolarizationactivated, time- and voltage-dependent, non-inactivating
inward currents (Fig. 4A,B). The astrocytic inward current
increased from 73.3 6 29.6 pA (n 5 20) in controls to
251.3 6 38.9 pA (n 5 16; P < 0.001) 5W after FCI (Fig. 4C).

This current was sensitive to 50 mM ZD7288 (Fig. 4D,E), a
blocker of neuronal hyperpolarization-activated (Ih) currents
(Gasparini and DiFrancesco, 1997), which reduced the current by 63.9 6 13.9% (n 5 5; P < 0.01) (Fig. 4F). Thus, the
hyperpolarization-activated, time- and voltage-dependent,
non-inactivating inward currents expressed in cortical astrocytes after ischemia might strongly resemble the Ih currents
permeable for both K1 and Na1 cations observed in cortical
astrocyte cultures by (Guatteo et al., 1996). Since HCN
channels are known to be modulated by cAMP, the binding
of which increases their conductance, we used the extracellular application of 100 mM 8-Br-cAMP. The exposure of postischemic astrocytes to cAMP increased the inward current
evoked by hyperpolarization by 28.8 6 5.4% in 25 cells out
of 28 (P < 0.05, Fig. 5A–C) and shifted the voltage dependence of HCN channel opening towards more positive potentials (by 4.0 6 1.6 mV, n 5 25). The depolarization of
astrocytes 5W after ischemia might be underlain by the
downregulation of Kir4.1 protein expression (Pivonkova
et al., 2010); however, an additional ion conductance, presumably for Na1 ions, might contribute to such depolarization as well. To test this hypothesis and to reveal the possible
contribution of Na1 ions to the inward currents in astrocytes
after ischemia, we partially replaced Na1 ions in the aCSF by
NMDG1 (the Na1 ion concentration was decreased from
150 to 75 mM). After reducing extracellular Na1 concentration, astrocytes 5W after FCI displayed a marked decrease in
the inward current amplitude by 34.9 6 3.4% (n 5 17;
P < 0.001, Fig. 5D–F).
Membrane Properties of Astrocytes After GCI in
Rats
Membrane currents were recorded from astrocytes in the CA1
region (stratum radiatum) of adult rat hippocampi in controls
and rats 5W after GCI. Cells were selected for patch–clamp
recordings based on their morphology, and post-recording
2014

identification using immunohistochemical staining for GFAP
was carried out. In hippocampal astrocytes of controls and
ischemic rats, clamping the cell membrane from the holding
potential of 270 mV to values ranging from 2160 to 120
or 140 mV elicited predominantly time- and voltageindependent currents with a linear current/voltage relationship (Pivonkova et al., 2010). Similarly to reactive astrocytes
after FCI, the hippocampal astrocytes 5W after GCI displayed
a considerable depolarization (Table 3). In controls, the average RMP of astrocytes was 275.7 6 0.7 mV (n 5 61), and it
shifted to 265.9 6 0.7 mV (n 5 84; P < 0.001) 5W after
GCI. In addition, hippocampal astrocytes 5W after GCI also
displayed hyperpolarization-activated, time- and voltagedependent, non-inactivating inward currents (Fig. 6A–C).
The astrocytic inward current increased from 103.3 6 32.7
pA in controls (n 5 18) to 278.7 6 21.4 (n 5 49, P < 0.001)
5W after GCI (Table 3 and Fig. 6C). To confirm that the
inward currents could be carried by HCN channels, we used
50 mM ZD7288 and the current was inhibited by
27.4 6 8.4% (n 5 10, P < 0.01, Fig. 6D–F). Although the
application of ZD7288 caused a decrease in inward currents,
no shifts in the membrane potentials were detected. Despite
the fact that ZD7288 is known/used as a specific HCN channel blocker, it also inhibits/activates the functioning of several
ion channels, such as Nav1.4 channels (Wu et al., 2012),
NMDA-evoked currents (Klar et al., 2003) or low-threshold
Ca21 channels (Felix et al., 2003). Therefore, it is possible
that the application of ZD7288 simultaneously activates or
inhibits other channels, which could compensate for the shift
towards more negative potentials caused by blocking the
HCN channels.
Moreover, astrocytes display large passive membrane
conductance carried by numerous types of two-pore domain
potassium channels that are expressed in the astrocytic membrane. These large currents, mostly carried by K1, could
mask the activation of channels with considerably smaller

conductance. This was observed in our previous study in
which we described the increased expression of TRPV4 channels in reactive astrocytes. These currents were masked by
high potassium conductance, and the application of a TRPV4
antagonist did not result in a shift of the membrane potential.
Nevertheless, blocking potassium conductance with cesium
revealed TRPV4 mediated currents together with a shift of
the membrane potential after blocking these currents
(Butenko et al., 2012). However, we could not use cesium to
block potassium conductance in our experiments with
ZD7288, because cesium simultaneously blocks HCN conductance and removing potassium ions from the solutions is
not possible due to the potassium conductance of HCN
channels (Lau et al., 2011).
The hyperpolarization-activated current was further
potentiated by the extracellular application of 100 mM cAMP
by 116.3 6 33.3% in nine cells out of 21 (P < 0.01, Fig. 7A–
C); however, no shift in HCN channel opening to more positive potentials was observed. Similarly to FCI, the
hyperpolarization-activated, time- and voltage-dependent,
non-inactivating inward currents detected in rat astrocytes
after GCI strongly resemble Ih currents, permeable for both
K1 and Na1 cations, so we also decreased the extracellular
Na1 ion ([Na1]e) concentration from 150 to 75 mM, upon
which astrocytes 5W after GCI displayed a marked decrease
in their inward current amplitude by 34.7 6 11.0% (n 5 10,
P < 0.05, Fig. 7D–F). In addition, the decreased Na1 concentration in the aCSF induced an outward current in reactive astrocytes 5W after GCI when the cells were voltage
clamped at 270 mV, accompanied by membrane hyperpolarization from 265.5 6 2.2 to -74.3 6 1.6 mV (n 5 8,
P < 0.001) (Fig. 7E). These observations indicate that the
inward currents in reactive astrocytes 5W after GCI are partially carried by Na1 ions and that reactive astrocytes display
resting Na1 conductance.
In summary, electrophysiological analyses confirmed the
presence of hyperpolarization-activated, time- and voltagedependent, non-inactivating inward currents in reactive astrocytes after both types of ischemic injury. Their sensitivity to
the HCN channel blocker ZD7288, their potentiation by
cAMP and their permeability for Na1 ions suggest that these
currents are carried by HCN channels as was anticipated
based on mRNA and protein expression.

Discussion
In the present study we demonstrated the strong upregulation
of mRNA coding the HCN channels in reactive astrocytes in
the mouse cortex 2W after focal cerebral ischemia as well as
in those in the rat hippocampus following global cerebral
ischemia. The presence of these channels, until now described
primarily in excitable cells, was also confirmed on the protein
December 2014

level using immunohistochemistry 5W after ischemia. Final
confirmation that HCN channels contribute to the changed
membrane properties of reactive astrocytes after ischemia was
obtained from patch–clamp recordings. We have demonstrated that hyperpolarization-activated inward currents in
reactive astrocytes are sensitive to ZD7288, cAMP and a
decreased [Na1]e concentration, thus we provide here, for the
first time, evidence that HCN channels are strongly expressed
by reactive astrocytes and significantly alter their electrophysiological properties at later time points following ischemic
brain injury.
The single-cell RT-qPCR analyses revealed an increased
number of cells expressing Hcn genes and their increased relative expression 2W after FCI or GCI. Interestingly, these
changes on the mRNA level occurred with a relatively long
delay after injury and lasted for a long time, since at later
time points we were also able to detect Hcn transcripts. Based
on these data, it seems that the onset of HCN channel
expression correlates with glial scar formation (Sofroniew,
2009). Focal cerebral ischemia, the permanent and more
severe type of ischemia, led to a marked increase in the number of Hcn expressing astrocytes when compared with GCI,
so the levels of Hcn transcripts may correlate with the severity
of ischemic damage. Moreover, the Hcn1,2 genes exhibited
strong and frequent expression among all of the measured
genes in reactive astrocytes 2W after ischemia, which makes
them a potentially suitable marker of reactive astrocytes.
Nevertheless, it is very difficult to distinguish reactive astrocytes from neural stem cells, which can be found in the proximity of the ischemic regions. Reactive astrocytes share almost
all markers with neural stem cells (Buffo et al., 2008; Robel
et al., 2011) and moreover, when exposed to the proper factors reactive astrocytes can adopt neural stem cells phenotype
(Sirko et al., 2013). Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the reactive astrocytes in our analyses
adopted neural stem cells phenotype and also expressed
increased levels of HCN channels transcripts.
Our immunohistochemical analysis in control brains confirmed that HCN channels are predominantly present in neuronal cells in the mouse cortex or the rat hippocampus (WahlSchott and Biel, 2008) and that they are virtually absent in glial
cells with the exception of HCN1 channels, which were
detected in EGFP1 cells with a morphology corresponding to
that of polydendrocytes. Although we detected the strong
expression of Hcn genes in reactive astrocytes 2W after ischemia, we were unable to confirm the presence of HCN channels
at this time point in the cytoplasmic membrane of reactive
astrocytes. Nevertheless, 5W after ischemia we found a number
of HCN1 reactive astrocytes after both types of ischemia.
These results are quite unique since HCN channels were
known to be expressed only in excitable cells, and only the

phenomenon that was previously shown, for example, in freshly
isolated human circulating monocytes (Guo et al., 2008).
Although the frequency and expression rates of Hcn1, 2, and 3
were increased 2W after FCI, immunohistochemistry showed
the predominant presence of only HCN1 and HCN3 5W after
FCI. This discrepancy could be caused by a different half-time
of Hcn2 mRNA or its protein products. Alternatively, mRNA
coding Hcn2 may not be translated into a protein product at
all. Different types of miRNAs, which have recently been
shown to regulate many downstream targets for example in the
inflammatory response of astrocytes, could play a crucial role in
this process (Iyer et al., 2012).
All functional studies we performed point towards
delayed protein expression, since in the earlier stages after
ischemia we were unable to detect currents corresponding to
HCN channels. However, in brains 5W after ischemia we
found many reactive astrocytes with significantly depolarized
RMP and decreased RM. These altered properties suggest
changes in the composition of cytoplasmic membrane channels, such as Kir4.1 or two-pore domain K1 channels as
shown previously (Kucheryavykh et al., 2009; Pivonkova
et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2013). The recorded inward currents,
sensitive to HCN channel blocker and co-agonist, together
with the demonstrated Na1 conductance, imply that the
HCN channels are one of the main players in the altered
membrane properties of reactive astrocytes. Thus, these channels with permeability for Na1 ions could be partially responsible for the significant depolarization of reactive astrocytes
that we observed after both types of ischemia. Although the
passive membrane properties as well as the hyperpolarizationactivated inward currents in reactive astrocytes were very similar after both types of ischemia, we also found some differences in the sensitivity of the currents to their blockers and coagonists. ZD7288 decreased the amplitude of the
hyperpolarization-activated currents by 64% in mice, but
only by 28% in rats. Since different current reductions caused
by ZD7288 were not described among different HCN homotetramers (Stieber, 2005), we suppose that different sensitivities to ZD7288 might be caused by an unusual composition
of HCN channels in rodent reactive astrocytes. Another difference between reactive astrocytes after both types of ischemia was observed in the potentiation of hyperpolarizationactivated currents by cAMP. In reactive astrocytes after FCI,
cAMP increased the amplitudes of the HCN currents only by
29% in almost all astrocytes (in 25 cells out of 28), while in
rat reactive astrocytes following GCI, cAMP application
markedly increased the current amplitude by 116%, but only
in 9 astrocytes out of 21. Since it is well known that cAMP
increases the conductance of channels composed of HCN2 or
4 (Altomare et al., 2003), we hypothesize that these isoforms
might be enriched predominantly in reactive astrocytes in the
December 2014

rat. However, this presumption was not confirmed by immunohistochemistry, which could be explained by the different
properties of HCN channels in astrocytes; nevertheless, similar cell type–specific differences in ion channel properties
were already shown, for example, in NMDA receptors, which
have strikingly different properties between neurons and
astrocytes (Dzamba et al., 2013; Palygin et al., 2011). Interestingly, the activation of HCN channels by cAMP resulted
in the shift of the voltage dependence of HCN channel opening towards more positive potentials only in reactive astrocytes after FCI (by 4.0 mV, n 5 25). This phenomenon
could be caused by the concomitant activation of inwardly
rectifying K1 channels, which could entirely counteract this
effect (Roy and Sontheimer, 1995). Additionally, the HCN
channel brain-specific auxiliary subunit TRIP8b, which is in
part responsible for the correct membrane targeting of these
channels, was shown to inhibit the cAMP-induced shift of
voltage gating of HCN channel (Hu et al., 2013).
The reduction of HCN current amplitudes in reactive
astrocytes after a decrease of the [Na1]e concentration was
comparable after both types of ischemia, which suggests their
similar Na1 conductance. The conductance of HCN channels
is carried by K1/Na1 at a ratio of 4:1 (Wahl-Schott and Biel,
2008), which explains why the reduction of the [Na1]e concentration had a relatively small impact on the amplitude of
inward currents. Moreover, the intracellular concentration of
Na1 in astrocytes is higher than in neurons (Black et al.,
2010), which could result in a lower influx of Na1 through
HCN channels into astrocytes when compared with neurons.
Taken together, it seems that the strong expression of
HCN channels is a common feature of reactive astrocytes at
later stages after ischemic brain injury and that therefore these
channels may play an important role in the regeneration of
ischemic tissue. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotidegated non-selective cation channels are important regulators of
neuronal physiology, contributing to passive membrane properties, such as resting membrane potential and input resistance,
and to intrinsic oscillatory activity and synaptic integration.
But what is the real purpose of this massive HCN channel
upregulation in reactive astrocytes? As mentioned before, reactive astrocytes protect the CNS tissue, especially in the initial
phase after ischemia, by taking up excitotoxic glutamate
(Sidoryk-Wegrzynowicz et al., 2011) and protecting nervous
tissue from oxidative stress (Liddell et al., 2006). At later stages,
astrocytes facilitate blood brain barrier repair (Tian et al.,
2011), stabilize extracellular homeostasis, reduce the seizure
threshold (Stanimirovic et al., 1997) and limit the spread of
inflammatory cells (Karimi-Abdolrezaee and Billakanti, 2012).
It is obvious that the HCN channels are involved in the later
processes, possibly contributing to ionic homeostasis maintenance by enabling Na1 and K1 influx into astrocytes or by
2019

reducing the [Na1]e concentration and therefore preventing
seizures, since total tissue sodium levels are elevated in stroke
(Thulborn et al., 2005) or in brain tumor tissues (Ouwerkerk
et al., 2003). Moreover, Na1/K1 ATPase activity within astrocytes appears to depend on a constant Na1 influx through Na1
channels, and their role may be a prerequisite for the viability
of these cells (Sontheimer et al., 1994). We hypothesize that the
upregulated expression of Na1 permeable channels within
astrocytes may provide a compensatory mechanism that supports Na1/K1 ATPase-dependent ionic homeostasis in areas of
CNS injury (Black et al., 2010). Membrane depolarization due
to HCN channel activity might also activate a part of the low/
high threshold voltage-gated Ca21 channels, which are
expressed in post-ischemic astrocytes (Chung et al., 2001;
Westenbroek et al., 1998), and thus enhance Ca21 signaling
within astrocytic networks in response to injury. Additionally,
HCN channels were also shown to play an essential role in cell
proliferation as in the case of embryonic stem cells (Lau et al.,
2011), and since we showed that astrocytes proliferate at later
time points after ischemia (Anderova et al., 2010), these channels could play a role in controlling the proliferation of reactive
astrocytes.
In view of the fact that HCN channel blockers have
been recently introduced into human medicine as analogs of
beta blockers or calcium channel blockers in the treatment of,
e.g., angina pectoris—Ivabradine (Borer, 2003), our study
shows for the first time another possible target for these
blockers in the human body. Thus, it should be taken into
account that using HCN channel blockers could lead to
unexpected interactions or side-effects after treatment with
these drugs during ongoing stroke, when reactive astrocytes
perform many important functions.
