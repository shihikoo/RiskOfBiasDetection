Abstract Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy and memantine,
a non-competitive NMDA antagonist, are both promising
treatment strategies for improving stroke prognosis.
However, HBO’s narrow therapeutic time window (<6 h
post-stroke) and the adverse effect of high-dose MEM administration limits the use of these therapeutic interventions. In
this study, we investigated whether or not MEM could prolong the narrow therapeutic window of HBO treatment.
Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in male
Sprague–Dawley rats by middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) for 120 min. MCAO produced neurobehavioral
deficits, increased infarction volume, increased Evans blue
(EB) content and levels of pro-inflammatory factors, as well
as depleted glutathione (GSH), and reduced catalase (CAT)
and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the ischemic
ipsilateral hemisphere. The combination of 5 mg/kg MEM

treatment 15 min after the onset of ischemic event and HBO
therapy 12 h post-reperfusion significantly restored neurologic scores, EB concentration and IL-10 levels, as well as
significantly decreased infarct volume and increased antioxidant activity. These results imply that the combination of
MEM and HBO therapy not only prolongs the therapeutic
window of HBO treatment, but also lowers the dosage requirement of MEM. The mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of the combined treatment may lie in alleviated blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, inhibited inflammatory response, and up-regulation of the antioxidant
enzyme activity.

Stroke is one of the leading causes of medical morbidity
and mortality in geriatric population, often resulting in

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 52:1458–1466

irreversible brain injury from oxygen loss; therefore, improving tissue oxygenation in stroke patients is an important aim of new therapeutic strategies. Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) in a pressure chamber dramatically increases the oxygen content of blood by physically dissolving oxygen [1]. As defined by the Undersea and
Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS) report, hyperbaric
oxygen (HBO) treatment is the medical use of oxygen for
which the pressurization are 1.4 ATA or higher. The
applicability of HBO therapy in ischemic stroke has been
previously investigated [2, 3]. Multiple studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of the early application of a single HBO session in focal cerebral ischemia,
including decreased infarct volume [4], reduced frequency
of hemorrhagic transformation [2], and improved neurological outcome [4] in rodents. However, accumulating
evidence also suggests that HBO treatment is ineffective
when administered over 6 h after stroke onset [3]. In other
words, the narrow therapeutic time window has limited
the clinical application of HBO treatment in stroke patients. Therefore, it would be meaningful to find a way to
prolong the narrow therapeutic window for HBO
treatment.
Ischemic cerebrovascular diseases often lead to debilitating neurologic deficits that severely interfere with a
patient’s quality of life. In some cases, the consequences
of ischemic accidents are fatal. Recent progress in the
study of the underlying molecular mechanisms and histopathology of cerebral ischemia has lead to the development of multiple neuroprotective measures and drugs.
Memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane, MEM),
an aminoadantamine derivative, is a non-competitive,
low-affinity NMDA blocker that is commonly used in
the treatment of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.
MEM also has neuroprotective effects against ischemia/
reperfusion injury in the nervous system [5]. Specifically,
MEM pre-treatment prevented memory impairment [6], as
well as decreased ischemic injury and post-stroke neurological deficits [7]. MEM therapy shows promise, but the
adverse side effects associated with high dose treatments
has limited its use in stroke patients. Although MEM has
been shown to elevate ERK-1/2, as well as decrease p21
and p38/MAPK activation [8], the exact signaling pathway that mediates MEM’s neuroprotective properties after
ischemic accidents is poorly understood.
The present study was designed to explore the neuroprotective effect of MEM treatment in conjunction with HBO
therapy against focal cerebral ischemic injury. The main purpose was to investigate whether the combined therapeutic
approach could prolong HBO’s therapeutic window for neuroprotection and simultaneously decrease the dose of MEM
treatment. Additionally, the potential underlying mechanisms
were also explored.

Results
Combination of MEM and HBO Therapy Prolonged
the Therapeutic Window of HBO Treatment
Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, the infarct volumes in
combined treatment A (5 mg/kg MEM 15 min after onset of
ischemia, HBO therapy 12 h after reperfusion) and B
(20 mg/kg MEM 15 min after onset of ischemia, HBO therapy
1 h after reperfusion) groups were also significantly smaller
than controls. There is no significant difference in the neurological scores and infarct volume between combined treatment groups A and B (Fig. 1a). The neurological scores were
higher in combined treatment A group, and combined treatment B group in comparison to the control group (Fig. 1b).
Seventy-two hours after MCAO, delayed neurological functional benefit was evaluated. The result showed that, the
neurological scores were higher in the two combination
groups in comparison to the control group (Fig. 4a).
Combination of MEM and HBO Therapy Reduced Evans
Blue Leakage
EB content of the ischemic ipsilateral hemisphere was significantly increased in controls in comparison to the sham condition. There were no statistical differences between HBO
12 h, MEM 5 mg/kg, and control groups. Without statistically
significant differences between each other, HBO 1 h, MEM
20 mg/kg, and combined treatment A and B groups exhibited
significantly lower EB content in the ischemic ipsilateral
hemisphere when compared to controls. In contrast, the EB
concentration of the contralateral hemisphere was not significantly different among each group (Fig. 2).
Combination of MEM and HBO Therapy Suppressed
Inflammatory Response After Reperfusion
Quantification of inflammatory factors levels were measured
by ELISA. IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 contents were
significantly higher in controls when compared to sham group
levels. The contents of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 were
significantly lower in HBO 1 h, MEM 20 mg/kg, and combined treatment A and B groups vs. controls. The content of
IL-10 was significantly greater in HBO 1 h, MEM 20 mg/kg,
and combined treatment A and B groups in comparison to
controls. However, there were no statistical differences among
these groups, themselves (Fig. 3).

reperfusion, but it also reduces the required dosage of MEM
from 20 to 5 mg/kg. Moreover, this combined approach
significantly reduced EB content and anti-inflammatory factor
levels, which suggest that MEM and HBO combination therapy may be mediated by decreased permeability of the blood–
brain barrier (BBB) and attenuated inflammatory responses.
HBO has been extensively used to treat cerebral and spinal
ischemic injury. It has been reported that HBO reduces transient focal cerebral ischemic injury within 6 h of the ischemia’s onset [9]. This implies that HBO application during the

At 24 h post-ischemia, a significant decline in ipsilateral
ischemic penumbra antioxidant enzyme activity was observed
in control vs. sham group rats. Without statistically significant
differences between each other, HBO 1 h, MEM 20 mg/kg,
and both combination therapeutic groups exhibited significantly higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase
(CAT) activities in ischemic ipsilateral hemisphere when compared to controls (Fig. 5). There were no statistical differences
between HBO 12 h, MEM 5 mg/kg, and control groups.

Discussion
The results of the present study demonstrate that the combination of MEM and HBO treatments not only prolongs HBO’s
narrow therapeutic time window from 6 to 12 h after

acid [10, 11], especially during cerebral ischemia and trauma,
which result in high levels of glutamate [12]. It is critical to
maintain homeostatic NMDAR activity for proper brain functions in the nervous system; therefore, excessive NMDAR
activity blocking must be achieved without interfering with
its important physiological function. Although high-affinity
NMDAR antagonists are efficacious, their neurotoxicity produces behavioral side effects, which are at least partially
caused by their blockade of regular synaptic activity [13,
14]. As a result, most of the NMDAR antagonists are not
viable pharmacological agents for clinical interventions.
MEM is a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist, which
preferentially blocks excessive NMDAR activity, particularly
at the extra-synaptic position without disrupting physiological
synaptic activity [15–17]. Due to its more favorable pharmacological profile, MEM has been used to treat nervous system
disease, like Parkinson’s disease, spasmus, chronic encephalopathy and Alzheimer’s disease [18]. In the MCAO model,
most of the NMDAR antagonists, including MEM, only exhibit neuroprotective effects if administered prior to or
∼30 min after the ischemic event [19]. Although 20 mg/kg is
the ideal dosage, 10 mg/kg is the lowest neuroprotective dose
of the MEM [3, 19, 20].
Our current study is the first to demonstrate that 5 mg/kg
MEM treatment 15 min after onset of cerebral ischemia
prolonged HBO’s therapeutic window from 6 h to at least
12 h. When administered alone, 5 mg/kg MEM is not sufficient to induce neuroprotective effects in cases of cerebral
ischemia. This dose was not only able to prolong the HBO’s
therapeutic window, but it was able to do so without inducing
typical MEM side effects. Furthermore, the neuroprotective
effects of the combined therapy with the standard ideal dose of
20 mg/kg MEM and HBO therapy was no more efficacious
than each treatment used alone.
Virtually, all Evans Blue is bound to albumin, which cannot
cross the BBB; therefore, normally, the neural tissue remains
unstained [21]. When the BBB has been compromised,
albumin-bound Evans blue is able to enter the CNS. In this
study, the integrity of the BBB was investigated by measuring
the extravasation of EB. It has been demonstrated that HBO
therapy can alleviate the impairment of BBB permeability

[22] and decrease the level of pro-inflammatory factors after
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury [23]. Over-activated
NMDAR leads to Ca2+ overload, activation of enzymes and
free radicals, phosphorylation of ERK-1/2 and stress kinases
(p38/MAPK and SAPK/JNK1/2), activation of pro-apoptotic
transcription factors and early inflammation, as well as apoptosis [24–29]. MEM has been demonstrated to reduce the
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain [30, 31]. In
this study, the combination of MEM and HBO therapy significantly decreased EB leakage from brain capillaries and the
level of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, as well as significantly increased IL-10 levels. This suggests that the combination of MEM and HBO therapy can significantly reduce
inflammatory response after cerebral ischemia.
The depletion of GSH content and reduced antioxidant
activity observed in MCAO rats implies altered energy metabolism between neuron and astrocyte. One of the important
functions of glutamate in astrocyte is GSH synthesis. Impaired
astrocytic function results in decreased glutamate uptake,
which ultimately reduces GSH content in MCAO rats. The
combination of MEM and HBO therapies increased GSH
levels, which emphasizes the significant role of controlling
early glutamate levels in sustaining astrocyte function poststroke.
SOD acts as a defense mechanisms against oxidative stress
[32], whereas CAT plays a pivotal role in the induction of
ischemic tolerance by HBO pretreatment [33]. MEM possesses the ability to alleviate MeHg-induced neurotoxicity
through mechanisms involving antioxidation [34]. Our study
demonstrates that the combination of MEM and HBO therapies leads to the stimulation of SOD and CAT in the ischemic
region. This phenomenon implies that restoration of antioxidant activity may be associated with the neuroprotective effects observed when MEM and HBO therapies are combined
for the treatment of ischemic accidents.
In conclusion, the present study provides the first piece of
evidence that a combined therapeutic approach of MEM and
HBO therapy prolongs the therapeutic window of HBO treatment of stroke. This effect may be related to the alleviation of
BBB permeability, the inhibition of inflammatory response
and upregulation of antioxidant enzyme activity. The

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 52:1458–1466

theoretical mechanism based on the findings of the current
study required future experiments to confirm.

Experimental Procedure
Animals
The experimental protocol used in the present study was
approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal
Experimentation of the Fourth Military Medical University
and was conducted according to the Guidelines for Animal
Experimentation of the Fourth Military Medical University.
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (280–320 g) were provided by the
Experimental Animal Center of the Fourth Military Medical
University and housed under controlled condition with a 12 h
light/dark cycle, a temperature at 21±2 °C, and humidity in
60–70 % for at least 1 week prior to surgery. The rats had
access to ad libitum food and water. In this study, 10 rats in
each group were used for neurobehavioral evaluation and
infarct assessment, 6 rats in each group were used for extravasation of EB measurement, inflammatory factors qualification, and antioxidant enzyme activity measurement, respectively, and 10 rats in each group for both delayed neurological
function and glutathione qualification. Taken together, 28 rats
were used in Sham group, while 38 rats were used in the rest
of each group.
Transient Focal Cerebral Ischemia
MCAO was produced by the filament model in rats as described in our previous studies [35]. Briefly, the rats were
anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 2 %
pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg) and were allowed to breathe
spontaneously during surgical preparation. Via a midline neck
incision, the submandibular glands were separated to allow
access to the right carotid artery. The right MCA was occluded
by an insertion of a 3-0 nylon monofilament suture (Ethicon
Nylon Suture, Ethicon Inc., Japan) with its tip rounded by the
heat from a nearby flame through the common carotid artery.
Successful induction of ischemia was confirmed by monitoring regional cerebral blood flow through a laser Doppler
flowmetry (PeriFlux 5000, Perimed AB, Jarfalla, Sweden).
Animals that did not show a cerebral blood flow reduction of
at least 70 % were excluded from the experimental group, as
well as animals that died after ischemia induction.
Reperfusion was accomplished by withdrawing the suture
after 120 min. A heating blanket was used to maintain the
rats’ rectal temperature at 37.0±0.5 °C throughout surgery
until they recovered from anesthesia. During the MCAO,
PaO2, and PaCO2 were maintained at physiological levels.
The animals were sacrificed at 24 h post-reperfusion.

1463

HBO Therapy
Animals were placed into the hyperbaric chambers (Model
No. NG90-IIC, Yantai Binglun, Yantai, China) for 60 min at 1
or 12 h post-reperfusion and compressed to 2.5 ATA in 100 %
oxygen (rate of compression and decompression 0.2 ATA/
min). The temperature in the hyperbaric chambers was monitored during the entire session and maintained at 24–25 °C.
The oxygen concentration was monitored with a calibrated
oxymeter. Accumulation of carbon dioxide was absorbed by
calcium carbonate crystals.
Neurobehavioral Evaluation and Infarct Assessment
Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, an 18-point scoring system
reported by Garcia [36] with modifications was used for neurological assessment by an investigator who was blind to the
experimental condition of the animals. The investigator was not
involved in the neurological deficits evaluation. Then, animals
were decapitated in order to make 2-mm-thick coronal sections
throughout the brain. The sections were stained with 2 % 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) to measure infarct
volume, as previously described [37, 35]. Total infarct volume
was calculated by a blinded investigator by adding all crosssectional areas multiplied by 2 mm (thickness of sections).
Edema correction of infarct volume was achieved using the
following equation [38]: Vedi =Vinfarct ×(1−(Vipsi −Vcontra)/
Vcontra); Vinfarct, volume infarct; Vipsi, volume ipsilateral hemisphere; Vcontra, volume contralateral hemisphere; Vedi, volume
edema corrected infarct.
Experimental Design and Drug Treatment
The ischemic episode began after the occlusion of MCA with
nylon filament. Animals were divided into five experimental
and two control groups of 20 subjects. Sham group received
exactly the same surgical procedure without occluded MCA.
Control group served as MCAO controls and received 0.9 %
sterile saline as vehicle. HBO 1 h group animals were subjected to HBO treatment 1 h post-reperfusion. HBO 12 h
group animals were subjected to HBO treatment 12 h postreperfusion. MEM 5 mg group received MEM (5 mg/kg)
15 min after onset of the MCAO. MEM 20 mg group received
MEM (20 mg/kg) 15 min after onset of stroke induction. Com
A group animals received MEM (5 mg/kg) 15 min after onset
of MCAO and subjected to HBO treatment 12 h post-reperfusion. Com B group animals received MEM (20 mg/kg)
15 min after onset of MCAO and were subjected to HBO
treatment 1 h post-reperfusion. MEM dose and HBO therapeutic window were fixed based on previous findings [3, 19,
20, 39] and our pilots experiment. MEM was dissolved in
0.9 % sterile saline and administered via an i.p. injection.

1464

Evans Blue Extravasation
The integrity of the BBB was investigated by measuring the
extravasation of EB. On the onset of reperfusion, Evans blue
(EB) dye (2 %; 4 mL/kg) was injected intravenously. Then, a
thoracotomy under pentobarbital sodium anesthesia was completed in order to perform an intra-cardiac perfusion through
the left ventricle. Saline was injected to remove intravascular
EB dye until the fluid from the right atrium became colorless.
The brains were removed and dissected into the right
(ischemic) and left (non-ischemic) hemispheres. Brain samples were then placed in 3 mL 50 % trichloroacetic acid
solution. Subsequently, they were homogenized and centrifuged (10,000 rpm for 20 min). The supernatant was measured
at 610 nm for absorbance using a spectrophotometer
(Ultrospec 3; Pharmacia LKB). The tissue content of EB
was quantified from a linear standard curve and expressed as
μg/g of brain tissue [40].
Quantification of Inflammatory Factors Levels by ELISA
Levels of inflammatory factors in the rats ischemic penumbra
were assessed using ELISA kits (R&D, USA). The ischemic
penumbra was dissected according to methods in rodent
models of unilateral proximal MCAO [41]. Briefly, in each
animal, the hemisphere was cut longitudinally, from top to
bottom approximately 1.5 mm from the midline to exclude
medial brain structures that were supplied primarily by the
anterior cerebral artery. A transverse diagonal incision at
approximately the 2 o’clock position separated the core from
the penumbra. Tissues were Dounce-homogenized in 5 M
guanidine hydrochloride and then placed on a rocker platform
at 4 °C overnight. Samples were diluted with reaction buffer
containing proteinase inhibitors and centrifuged at 16,000×g
for 20 min at 4 °C. After diluting the supernatants with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), protein concentrations were
determined by BCA assay (Pierce, USA). Plates were
blocked, washed, and detection antibody was added according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Additionally, samples or
standards for IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 in 1 %
Blocker A solution was added, incubated (2 h; RT) and
washed, to which Read Buffer was added. The plate was read
immediately using a Sector Imager plate reader, and IL-1β,
TNFα, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 concentrations were evaluated
by referencing the standard curve.

(pH 8.0) and 0.5 ml of DTNB (0.6 mM in 0.2 M phosphate
buffer, pH 8.0) were added and mixed well. The absorbance
was read at 412 nm using spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer,
USA). Values were expressed in nmol/g.
Measurement of Antioxidant Enzyme Activity
The samples of ischemic penumbra were homogenized in cold
saline with a weight-to-volume ratio of 1:9. The homogenate
was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and the
supernatant was assayed for protein concentration by
Enhanced BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, USA). Both the
measurements of activity of CAT and SOD in tissue homogenate were performed according to the technical manual of the
detection kits (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China).
CAT activity was assayed by measuring absorbance at 240 nm
using an ultraviolet light spectrophotometer and was
expressed as U/g-protein. The definition of its activity was
based on the hydrogen peroxide decomposition rate at 240 nm
in the reactive mixture, of which the absorbance was between
0.50 and 0.55. MDA content was measured with the thiobarbituric acid [42] reaction. The method was used to obtain a
spectrophotometric measurement of the color produced during the reaction of TBA with MDA at 535 nm; estimated
MDA level was expressed as nmol/mg-protein.
Statistical Analysis
The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows. All of the values
were presented as mean±S.E., except for the neurobehavioral
score, and were analyzed using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The differences between two groups were
tested with post hoc Dunnett’s t test. Neurobehavioral scores
were expressed as the median (interquartile range, IQR) and
were analyzed using a nonparametric method (Kruskal–Wallis
test) followed by the Mann–Whitney U test using Bonferroni
correction. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05.

Quantification of Glutathione Level
Levels of GSH in the rats’ ischemic penumbra were assessed
72 h post-reperfusion. 0.25 ml of tissue homogenate was
added to equal volume of ice cold 5 % TCA. The precipitate
was removed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min. To 1ml aliquot of supernatant, 0.25 ml of 0.2 M phosphate buffer
