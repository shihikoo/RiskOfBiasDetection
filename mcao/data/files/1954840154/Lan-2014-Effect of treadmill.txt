Abstract It has been well documented that exercise
promotes neurological rehabilitation in patients with cerebral ischemia. However, the exact mechanisms have not
been fully elucidated. This study aimed to discuss the
effect of treadmill exercise on expression levels of 5-HT,
5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1AR) and brain derived neurophic
factor (BDNF) in rat brains after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). A total of 55 rats were
randomly divided into 3 groups: pMCAO group, pMCAO
and treadmill exercise (pMCAO ? Ex) group, and shamoperated group. Rats in pMCAO ? Ex group underwent
treadmill exercise for 16 days. Neurological function was
evaluated by modified Neurological Severity Scores
(mNSS). High-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection system was used to determine the
content of 5-HT in cortex tissues. The protein levels of
5-HT1AR, BDNF and synaptophysin were measured by
Western blot. The mNSS in pMCAO ? Ex group was
lower than that in pMCAO group on day 19 post-MCAO
(p \ 0.001). The content of 5-HT dropped to
3.81 ± 1.86 ng/ml in pMCAO group (43.84 ± 2.05 ng/ml
in sham-operated group), but increased in pMCAO ? Ex
group (10.06 ± 1.80 ng/ml). The protein expressions levels of synaptophysin, 5-HT1AR and BDNF were

Introduction
Stroke is a major health care burden worldwide and associated with increasing mortality and disability. It is well
known that exercise benefits cerebral function recovery,
reduces damage from ischemia [1] and improves brain
plasticity [2, 3]. However, the exact mechanisms are poorly
understood.
Serotonin (5-HT), a typical neurotransmitter in central
nervous system, can regulate neuronal plasticity, neuronal
proliferation and differentiation, and synaptogenesis [4, 5].
Harrison et al. [6] observed the reduced level of 5-HT in
the group with right common carotid artery occlusion,
while Kanthan et al. [7] found significantly increased level
of 5-HT on the set of cerebral ischemia using microdialysis technique. The exact impact of cerebral ischemia on
level of 5-HT was unclear. In addition, there are studies
which reported that the content of 5-HT in brain tissues
increased after long-term exercise in normal rats or rat
pups [8, 9].
Brain derived neurophic factor (BDNF) is widely distributed in central nervous system of rodent brain and
regulates neuronal growth and plasticity. Berchtold et al.
[10] reported that the protein level of BDNF increased after

123

762

running. Meanwhile, it is known that 5-HT and BDNF
interact with each other to regulate neuronal plasticity [11].
Also, it is reported that activation of 5-HT1A receptor (5HT1AR), one of the receptors of 5-HT, takes a protective
effect on neurons in transient cerebral ischemia [12, 13].
Besides, Galter and Unsicker [14] proposes that 5-HT
promotes the expression of BDNF via acting on 5-HT1AR.
Hence, the purpose of our study is to investigate the
effect of treadmill exercise on expression patterns of 5-HT,
5-HT1AR and BDNF, and to explore the possible mechanism of exercise-induced neuronal plasticity in rats with
cerebral ischemia.

Materials and methods
Animals
Healthy male Sprague–Dawley rats (weight 250–320 g)
aged 8–10 weeks were used in the experiment. The rats
were maintained in a constant light/dark cycle (12/12 h)
condition with free access to food and water. And they
were randomly divided into three groups: permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) group (n = 20),
pMCAO ? Ex group (n = 15) and sham-operated group
(n = 20). All animal procedures were in compliance with
international guidelines and were approved by the commission of Chongqing Medical University for ethics of
experiments on animals.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
Brain infarction was induced by occluding right middle
cerebral artery. MCAO was performed according to the
procedures described previously [15]. Briefly, the monofilament nylon, 0.234 mm in diameter, was inserted into
the artery for 17–19 cm from the crossing of right common
carotid artery. Rats in sham-operated group underwent the
same procedures without inserting nylon.

Neurological defect score
After rats awoke, neurological function was evaluated
according to Longa’s scoring system [15]. Rats scored 2–3
points were included in the experiment. Modified Neurological Severity Scores (mNSS) were performed to evaluate neurological function at 24 h, on day 3, 8, 12 and 19
after MCAO in pMCAO ? Ex group and pMCAO group,
respectively. The mNSS included four essential aspects:
motor, sensory, reflex and balance tests [16] (normal score,
0; maximal deficit score, 18).

Treadmill training
On the third day after the pMCAO procedure, rats in
pMCAO ? Ex group were forced to run on a motor-driven
treadmill (SLY-RTML, Beijing Sunny Instruments Co.,
Ltd., China). The starting speed was set at 10 m/min for
20 min per day in the first 2 days, then 15 m/min for 30 min
per day in the following 14 days. Other groups were kept
relatively static in the same environments for 16 days.
Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)
After 24 h post-MCAO (n = 5) and sham operation (n = 5),
rats were sacrificed and the whole brains were removed and
frozen at -20 °C for 30 min. The brains were coronally cut
in 2 mm thickness. Then the slices were immersed in 2 %
TTC in PBS at a temperature of 37 °C for 30 min.
Detection of 5-HT
Before detection, the cortex tissues around the infarct area
were weighed and homogenated with 0.1 M perchloric acid
according to each 100 mg tissue with 1 ml acid. The mixed
liquor was centrifuged at 14,000 9 g for 15 min in 4 °C.
Then the supernatants were transferred into new tubes via
filtrators. Finally, 20 ll of each sample was injected into
high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical
detection (HPLC-ECD) system.
Western blot analysis
The cortex tissues were lysed in lysis buffer, and the mixed
liquor was centrifuged at 14,000 9 g for 5 min at the
temperature of 4 °C. Then total protein concentration of
the supernatant was detected using BCA protein assay.
Samples were loaded in 10 % SDS–polyacrylamide gels,
and the object proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., USA) using
mini-protean tetra system of Bio-Rad. The membranes
loaded with proteins were blocked by 5 % blocking buffer
that contained Tris-buffered-saline with Tween (TBST)
and 5 % defatted milk powder for 2 h at 37 °C. Then they
were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight.
The primary antibodies included 5-HT-1A antibody (diluted 1:500, Anbo Biotechnology Company, USA), BDNF
antibody (1:2,000, Epitomics), SYP antibody (1:2,000,
Proteintech) and b-actin antibody (1:4,000, Beijing 4A
Biotech Co., Ltd.). After washing with TBST, the membranes were incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at 37 °C
for 2 h. After washing, bands were developed by ECL
chemiluminescence kit. The signal intensities of the bands
were analysed using Quantity One.

upregulated after treadmill exercise.

Discussion
Exercise is an effective way to reduce damage in cerebral
ischemia [17, 18], and it could also maintain brain function
and promote brain plasticity [19]. Researches on the
mechanisms are extensive, such as neurotrophic factors,
angiogenesis and synaptic plasticity [20, 21]. However,
few studies investigated the role of neurotransmitters,
which might exert crucial effects on the function of central
nervous system. It was reported that serotoninergic system
might contribute to neuronal plasticity [22]. In present
study, we found content of 5-HT, one of the important
neurotransmitters, increased in the cortex tissues in
pMCAO rats after treadmill exercise, suggesting that 5-HT
might at least partly play a critical role in neuroprotection.
Synaptophysin contributes to the structure and function
of synapsis, and its upregulation might be involved in
synaptic plasticity [23]. In our study, we found the
expression of synaptophysin increased in the
pMCAO ? Ex group, suggesting that exercise could promote synaptic plasticity in rats subjected to cerebral
ischemia. Besides, in our study, the score of mNSS

123

improved after treadmill exercise, which suggested exercise could also promote neurological function recovery.
Importantly, all of these findings were in consistent with
other previous studies [2, 24, 25].
As a neurotrophic factor, BDNF is also related with
neural plasticity. Previous researches have demonstrated
that the BDNF level upregulated after various motor
exercises including treadmill exercise [10, 26, 27]. The
results of our study were in consistent with those previous
findings. However, Combs et al. [28] recently found forced
exercise, such as treadmill running, could downregulate
BDNF level, which counteracted its benefit on motor
function recovery in cerebral ischemia. The differences
might be caused by the starting time and the velocity of
training. In our study, the starting time was on the third day
after the pMCAO procedure comparing to 24 h after the
surgery in Combs’ study. It was well known that early
training for ischemic brain recovery, especially training
started at 24 h post-MCAO, had significant effects on
neurological function [19, 29]. However, a recent randomized controlled trial [30] pointed out mobilization
within 24 h of admittance in patients with stroke was
detrimental to neurological function. Meanwhile, lowintensity (15 m/min) running was used in present study,
while Combs used moderate-intensity (20 m/min) running,
which suggested low intensity may be more appropriate for
rehabilitation in rats with cerebral ischemia.
The results also demonstrated that the protein level of
5-HT1AR, one of the receptors of 5-HT, was upregulated
in pMCAO ? Ex group. Previous studies had already
verified that activation of 5-HT1AR could exert protective
effect on neurons by upregulating BDNF in the brain [12]
and its agonist might protect neurons from damage in
cerebral ischemia [13]. Based on these observations, we
may safely conclude that upregulation of 5-HT1AR contributes to the neuroprotection in pMCAO ? Ex group.
Previous researches indicated that BDNF had mutual
relationship with 5-HT in neuronal plasticity [11, 31]. And
studies on depression demonstrated that there were reciprocal interactions between 5-HT1AR and BDNF [32, 33].
Therefore, we speculate that there is a connection among
5-HT, BDNF and 5-HT1AR, which was also pointed out by
other researchers [14, 31]. The present results indicated
that the levels of all three proteins mentioned above
increased conformably in pMCAO ? Ex group. It is

tempting to speculate that there might be a signaling
pathway, 5-HT/5-HT1A/BDNF, that may play an important role in neuronal plasticity and neuroprotection after
exercise in cerebral ischemia rats, which deserves further
research. Otherwise, given that 5-HT, 5-HT1AR and
BDNF were implicated in the pathophysiology of depression, we may conclude exercise after cerebral ischemia
might contribute to avoiding or alleviating depression after
stroke, which warrants further trials to test.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated the beneficial
roles of treadmill exercise on neurological rehabilitation in
rats with pMCAO. Of importance, our study indicated that
5-HT, 5-HT1AR and BDNF, at least in part, played a
critical role in exercise-induced neuroprotection and neuronal plasticity after ischemic stroke.
