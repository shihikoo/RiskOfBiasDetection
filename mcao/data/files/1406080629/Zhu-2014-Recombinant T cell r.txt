Abstract RTL1000 is a partial human MHC molecule
coupled to a human myelin peptide. We previously demonstrated that RTL1000 was protective against experimental
ischemic stroke in HLA-DR2 transgenic (DR2-Tg) mice.
Since thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is a standard therapy for stroke, we determined if
RTL1000 efficacy is altered when combined with t-PA in
experimental stroke. Male DR2-Tg mice underwent 60 min
of intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). tPA or vehicle was infused intravenously followed by either a
single or four daily subcutaneous injections of RTL1000 or
v eh i c l e . I nf a r c t s i z e w a s m e as ur e d by 2 , 3 , 5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining at 24 or 96 h of reperfusion. Our data showed that t-PA alone reduced infarct size
when measured at 24 h but not at 96 h after MCAO. RTL1000
alone reduced infarct size both at 24 and 96 h after MCAO.
Combining RTL1000 with t-PA did not alter its ability to
reduce infarct size at either 24 or 96 h after MCAO and
provides additional protection in t-PA treated mice at 24 h
after ischemic stroke. Taken together, RTL1000 treatment
alone improves outcome and provides additional protection
in t-PA-treated mice in experimental ischemic stroke.

Introduction
Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide [1].
Currently, thrombolytic treatment with recombinant tissue
plasminogen activator (t-PA) is the only FDA-approved therapy for acute ischemic stroke. However, the use of this drug is
limited due to the therapeutic window of 4.5 h, and the rate of
t-PA use remains less than 4 % [2]. Therefore, effective
therapy for ischemic stroke remains elusive and the development of new strategies are much needed.
We have previously shown that stroke induces the activation of peripheral immune system during the first 24 h, followed by immunosuppression characterized by pronounced atrophy of the spleen and thymus 96 h after stroke [3–5]. Peripheral inflammatory cells enter the brain and contribute to ischemic brain injury [6–9]. Recombinant T cell receptor ligands (RTLs), a class of partial major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules comprised of covalently linked
α1 and β1 chains that are tethered to antigenic peptides,
can inhibit brain specific T cell activation with other
portions of the immune system remaining intact, minimizing brain damage while not exacerbating immunosuppression [10–14].
We have previously demonstrated that RTL551, a mouse
partial MHC construct coupled to mouse myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein (MOG) peptide, reduces infarct size 96 h
after stroke and improves sensorimotor outcome without
compromising the immune system in C57BL/6 mice [13,
14]. Our investigation showed RTL551 specifically targets
myelin-specific T cells and profoundly changes their functional properties from proinflammatory to anti-inflammatory cells,

Transl. Stroke Res. (2014) 5:612–617

inhibiting the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the
brain and partially preserving spleen cell numbers that
are typically ablated after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In order to translate this result from
animal experiments into human clinical trials, we tested
the effect of RTL1000, a human MHC construct (from
the HLA-DR2 allele) covalently linked to a human
MOG peptide (hMOG-35-55), against experimental ischemic stroke in human MHC class II expressing HLADRB1*1502 (DR2-Tg) mice [15]. Our data revealed
that RTL1000 reduces infarct size at 96 h after stroke
in DR2-Tg mice when administered within a 6-h time
window. We have also confirmed that RTL1000 improves long-term neurobehavioral functional recovery
after stroke.
The Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable
(STAIR) criteria suggested the use of the so called “cocktail”
approach that targets multiple pathways with multiple neuroprotective therapies since cerebral ischemia involves a cascade of injury pathways [16, 17]. Furthermore, with the increasing use of thrombolysis and likely benefit of neuroprotection when used in combination with t-PA, it is also suggested by STAIR that examination of interaction with t-PA
should be performed when developing a new therapeutic
strategy for acute ischemic stroke. The latest STAIR VIII
Consortium update addressed clinical trial design where tPA is combined with neurothrombectomy therapy [18].
Therefore, in the current study, we evaluated the combined
effect of RTL1000 plus t-PA in the treatment of ischemic
stroke.

Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with
the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of
experimental animals, and protocols were approved by the
Animal Care and Use Committees at Oregon Health & Science University and the Portland Veteran Affairs Medical
Center.

Animals and Experimental Groups
Experiments were carried out on 90 male DR2-Tg mice
(produced at the Portland VA Medical Center with foundation
breeders provided by Dr. Chella David [15]), aged 8 to
12 weeks and weighing 20.1 to 27.7 g. Mice were randomly
assigned to groups and the surgeon was blinded to treatment
groups.

RTL1000 Production and Purification
RTL molecules consist of the α1 and β1 domains of MHC II
molecule expressing as a single polypeptide with or without
antigenic amino terminal extensions [10, 19]. RTL1000 is
comprised of covalently linked α1 and β1 domains of HLADR2 with a human MOG-35-55 (hMOG-35-55) peptide
(MEVGWYRPPFSRVVHLYRNGK) extension [20].
RTL1000 was constructed de novo or by sequential sitedirected mutagenesis of previous constructs. Protein purification was performed with a 30 to 40-mg yield of purified
protein per liter of bacterial cell culture.
Treatment with RTL1000 and t-PA
In the 96 h reperfusion groups, mice were treated with 100 μl
(1 μg/μl) of RTL1000 or vehicle (5 % dextrose in Tris–HCl,
pH 8.5) by four subcutaneous injections at 4, 24, 48, and 72 h
after MCAO. In the 24-h reperfusion groups, mice were given
one injection of 400 μl (1 μg/μl) of RTL1000 or vehicle at 4 h
after MCAO. t-PA (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (sterile water for
injection) was infused intravenously (I.V.) through the jugular
vein over 30 min starting at 15 min into MCAO.
Reversible Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Male DR2-Tg mice underwent 60 min of intraluminal reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as described
previously with slight modifications [21]. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5 % for induction; 1 % for maintenance)
through a mask connected with a vaporizer (Isotec 4; Cyprane,
England). Rectal temperature was monitored and maintained
at 36.5±0.5 °C with a warm water pad and a heating lamp.
Cortical blood flow was monitored by Laser-Doppler
Flowmetry (LDF; Model DRT4, Moor Instruments Ltd., Oxford, England). The right common carotid artery was exposed,
and the external carotid artery was ligated and cauterized. A
6–0 nylon monofilament surgical suture (ETHICON, Inc.,
Somerville, NJ, USA) with heat-rounded and silicone-coated
(Xantopren comfort light, Heraeus, Germany) tip was inserted
into the internal carotid artery via the external carotid artery
stump. The successful occlusion of the middle cerebral artery
was confirmed by sustained reduction in LDF. The filament
was withdrawn to allow for reperfusion at 60 min of occlusion
and mice were then allowed to recover from anesthesia and
survived for 24 or 96 h after MCAO. Animals were excluded
if LDF did not drop below 30 % of baseline during MCAO or
due to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
Determination of Infarct Volume
Animals were euthanized and brains were harvested at 24 or
96 h after MCAO. Brains were stained with 1.2 % 2, 3, 5-

614

triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA). Four slices of 2-mm-thick coronal sections were incubated in 1.2 % TTC for 15 min at 37 °C, and then fixed in
10 % formalin overnight. Brain slices were photographed and
evaluated by SigmaScan Pro 5.0 (Jandel, San G, Rarael, CA,
USA). Infarct size was expressed as a percentage of the
contralateral structure (cortex, striatum, or hemisphere). To
account for the effect of edema, infarct volume was calculated
by subtracting the ipsilateral non-infarct region from the total
contralateral structure volume, and dividing the difference by
the contralateral volume [22].
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean±SEM. Differences of infarct
volume among groups in the cortex, striatum, and hemisphere
were analyzed, respectively by one-way ANOVA with the
Holm-Sidak method. Statistical analyses were performed
using SigmaStat 3 statistical software (Systat Software, Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.

Results
Mortality and Exclusions
Overall mortality was 7 % (6 out of 90 mice, with no
mortality in the 24 h reperfusion groups and a mortality
ranging from 8.3 to 25 % in the different 96 h reperfusion groups). One animal was excluded because LDF
was greater than 30 % of baseline during MCAO. There
were no significant differences in LDF before, during,
or 5 min after MCAO, and no differences in age and
weight among groups.
The Effect of Combined RTL1000 and t-PA at 96 h
after MCAO
We tested the combined effect of RTL1000 and t-PA on infarct
size measured 96 h after stroke. Consistent with our previous
results, RTL1000 alone reduced infarct size 96 h after MCAO
(Fig. 1a, b). Infarct sizes were 28.7 %±3.4 %, 42.8 %±5.3 %,
and 20.2 %±2.1 % in the cortex, striatum, and hemisphere in
RTL1000-treated mice compared to 46.0 %±2.5 %, 67.3 %±
2.7 %, and 38.9 %±3.1 % in vehicle-treated mice, respectively (p<0.01). Unexpectedly, there were no differences between
t-PA and vehicle-treated mice at 96 h after MCAO (infract
sizes in the t-PA group were 43.2 %±2.0 %, 65.5 %±3.2 %,
and 32.0 %±0.9 % in the cortex, striatum, and hemisphere;
p>0.05). When mice were treated with t-PA plus RTL1000,
infarct sizes were 27.7 %±2.5 %, 43.1 %±5.6 %, and 19.4 %
±1.9 % in the cortex, striatum and hemisphere, respectively,

Transl. Stroke Res. (2014) 5:612–617

which were smaller than corresponding regions in vehicletreated mice (p<0.01), but not different from mice which were
treated with RTL1000 alone.
The Effect of Combined RTL1000 and t-PA at 24 h
after MCAO
Since t-PA alone has no effect on infarct size measured at 96 h
after MCAO, we wondered if it had an effect on infarct size at
24 h after stroke as previously reported [23, 24], and if the
combined administration of RTL1000 and t-PA had an additive effect on infarct size at 24 h after MCAO. Indeed, our data
confirmed the infarct size reduction by t-PA compared to
vehicle (Fig. 2a, b). The infarct volumes were 29.4 %±
3.0 %, 59.2 %±2.9 %, and 19.4±2.3 % in the cortex, striatum,
and hemisphere in t-PA-treated animals compared to 42.2 %±
2.6 %, 69.5 %±4.2 %, and 31.3 %±2.4 % in vehicle-treated
mice. RTL1000 alone also significantly reduced infarct size
24 h after ischemia compared with vehicle treatment, with
infarct volumes being 20.2 %±1.8 %, 45.9 %±3.0 %, and
13.3 %±1.3 % in the cortex, striatum, and hemisphere in
RTL1000-treated mice (p<0.01). The infarct volumes of combined RTL1000 and t-PA treated mice were 19.9 %±3.7 %,
47.7 %±4.6 %, and 13.2 %±2.1 % in the cortex, striatum, and
hemisphere, which were smaller than that of vehicle-treated
mice (p<0.01). There was also a significant difference between mice treated with combined RTL1000 plus t-PA and
with t-PA alone in the striatum (p<0.05), but not in the cortex
or total hemisphere. There were no differences between mice
treated with combined RTL1000 plus t-PA and mice treated
with RTL1000 alone.

Discussion
We evaluated the efficacy of RTL1000 in the presence of t-PA
in experimental stroke. Our data show that the combined
administration of RTL1000 with t-PA does not attenuate the
protective effect of RTL1000. We also report the novel finding
that t-PA reduces infarct size at 24 h, but not 96 h after
MCAO. RTL1000 on the other hand was protective both at
24 and 96 h after stroke.
Recanalization therapy with t-PA is the most effective
strategy to improve outcome in acute ischemic stroke
patients, and the only FDA-approved therapy for stroke.
Several reports revealed that t-PA administration during
MCAO reduces infarct size in rodents [23, 24]. The
mechanism of protection by t-PA in the mechanical
intraluminal filament occlusion model is not clear. Previous studies suggested the development of secondary
microthrombosis, which may contribute to the expansion
of cerebral ischemic lesions after MCAO. In support of

96 h after MCAO. Young adult
male mice were subjected to
transient 60-min MCAO, and
were treated with either t-PA, t-PA
vehicle (Vt), RTL1000 or
RTL1000 vehicle (Vr). t-PA
(10 mg/kg) or Vt was infused
through the jugular vein over a
30-min period during MCAO.
RTL1000 (100 μg) or Vr (100 μl)
was administered subcutaneously
(s.c.) at 4, 24, 48, and 72 h after
MCAO. Brains were harvested
96 h after MCAO and brain slices
were stained with TTC (a), and
infarct volumes were measured as
percentage of contralateral
structure (b) (cortex, CTX;

hemisphere, HMSPHR). *

this idea, inhibition of coagulation factors such as factor
XII and glycoprotein (Gp) Ibα [25, 26] reduced infarct
size after MCAO. Secondary microthrombosis presumably occurs within minutes after reperfusion in the
MCAO models, and leads to delayed hypoperfusion
and exacerbation of ischemic lesion. Furthermore, we
previously reported that experimental stroke induces a
massive peripheral immune response, which contributes
to and exacerbates ischemic brain injury [3, 14]. These
and other findings led to the idea that ischemic stroke is
a thrombo-inflammatory disorder [27]. However, not all
experimental stroke models showed microthombosis.
Mechanisms other than microthrombosis may also contribute to microvascular impairment after stroke, including arteriolar vasoconstriction, endothelial cell swelling,
and inflammatory cell adhesions [28].

Progressive microvascular thrombosis and benefit by t-PA
have been documented in the reversible intraluminal MCAO
model [23]. Our data confirm the benefit obtained by t-PA
when infarct size was measured at 24 h, but not 96 h. The lack
of protection at 96 h, despite efficacy at 24 h, which has not
previously been reported, suggests that either the thrombus
reforms after 24 h or that t-PA merely delays the infarction but
does not necessarily provide long-lasting protection. The halflife of t-PA in human and mouse plasma is in minutes, so it is
conceivable that the t-PA effect was short-lived and only
sufficient to impact 24-h infarct [29, 30]. Recanalization of
large vessels by t-PA, without effective microvascular reperfusion, has been observed clinically [31] and may have also
contributed to the differential effect of t-PA at 24 vs. 96 h
infarction. Specifically, microvascular injury could be a slow
process that develops after the first day of ischemia, such that

it is not affected mechanistically by t-PA and not coinciding
with its action temporally.
In the current study, we confirm our previous findings
that RTL1000 protect against ischemic stroke in DR2-Tg
male mice [14]. The protection was observed both at
24 h, when peripheral immune system is activated and
at 96 h after MCAO, during the immune-suppressive
phase. The addition of t-PA did not enhance the efficacy
of RTL1000 either at 24 or 96 h after MCAO. On the
other hand, combined administration of RTL1000 with tPA resulted in further infarct size decrease 24 h after
MCAO, compared with t-PA alone. Therefore, our data
suggest that the anti-inflammatory treatment with
RTL1000 is superior to thrombolytic therapy because it
provides long-term protection, and because it protects
against both vascular injury and downstream parenchymal inflammatory mechanisms of ischemic injury. Interestingly, and in support of vascular mechanism of protection, we recently reported that RTL1000 interacts with
human platelets and decreases aggregation [32]. In

addition to serving as T cell receptor ligand, RTL is also
a platelet ligand. Specifically, in our previous study [32],
we showed that RTL suppresses collagen-induced platelet
aggregation in vitro, and inhibits occlusive thrombus
formation on collagen-coated surfaces under physiologically relevant pressure gradients. Therefore, in addition
to the anti-inflammatory mechanism of protection,
RTL1000 may also prevent platelet reaggregation after
thrombolysis by t-PA. This may explain the additional
benefit from the combined administration of RTL1000
with t-PA compared to t-PA alone. The apparent lack of
additional protection by RTL1000 when t-PA is added
may be related to the “floor” effect; i.e., a maximal
protection that cannot be further augmented by t-PA.
Altogether, RTL1000 treatment alone improves outcome
and provides additional protection in t-PA-treated mice in
experimental ischemic stroke. These properties make
RTL1000 an attractive, safe, and efficacious choice in the so
called “cocktail” stroke therapy, and in stroke patients admitted beyond the therapeutic time window of t-PA.
