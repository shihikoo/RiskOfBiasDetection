Direct intracellular delivery of intact proteins has been successfully achieved by
tagging cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), which consists of short positively charged
amino acids, such as 11 poly-arginine (11R); however, in vivo delivery of the proteins to the brain has remained challenging because it is unclear whether CPP
would enable proteins to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we conducted an in vivo kinetic study to investigate the efficiency of 11R-mediated peptide delivery in the normal and ischemic brain. The 11R was observed in the
microvessels and neurons surrounding the microvessels throughout the brain
1 hour after systemic administration, but the signal of the peptide was faint after
2 hours. In a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model, 11R was
markedly enhanced and remained detectable in the cells on the ipsilateral side
for as long as 8 hours after administration compared with the contralateral side.
These results suggest that 11R is capable of in vivo delivery to the brain by passing
through the BBB. Furthermore, 11R-mediated protein transduction could be used
for the delivery of therapeutic molecules in cerebral ischemia. Key Words: Protein

Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of death and the principal
cause of adult disability worldwide.1 To treat an ischemic
stroke, current therapies use thrombolytic approaches to
dissolve blood clots.2 These treatments restore blood
flow and prevent further brain damage; however, there
is no medicine that can treat brain damage and prevent

neuronal cell death by directly targeting neuronal cells.
One reason is the difficulty of crossing the blood–brain
barrier (BBB), which is composed of a layer of specialized
endothelial cells that segregate the brain from the circulating blood.3 Extensive efforts have been made to engineer and deliver biologically active molecules to the
brain across the BBB.4
Among the delivery systems, a technology using
cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) has been emerging as
a potential tool to pass through biological membranes.5-7 CPP consists of short peptides containing
positively charged amino acids, such as lysine and
arginine. Protein transduction domains (PTDs) in the
transactivator of transcription (TAT) protein of HIV
and VP22 in herpes simplex virus 1 enable efficient
intracellular transduction of peptides and proteins
through a macropinocytosis-dependent mechanism.8
Subsequent studies have aimed to apply TAT-derived
PTD for in vivo delivery across the BBB, and it has
been found that TAT-derived PTD is capable of

transduction into the intact brain ; however, several
groups have reported that TAT protein could not
enter the intact brain using the same construct.11,12
Currently, whether TAT-derived PTD is capable of
transduction to the intact brain is still controversial,
and improvement of the delivery system is required to
achieve high efficiency. We previously reported that 11
poly-arginine (11R) was capable of intracellular delivery both in vitro and in vivo, such as to the mouse kidney and heart, more efficiently than TAT.13 Taken
together, these studies suggest that 11R may be used
as a potential tool to deliver biologically active molecules to the brain across the BBB.
In this study, we investigated whether 11R could enter
intact and ischemic brains across the BBB after systemic
administration.

Materials and Methods
Peptide Synthesis
Eleven arginine peptides (11R) composed of basic
amino acids were chemically synthesized by Fmoc
(9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) solid-phase peptide
synthesis on Rink amide resin, as described previously.14
Briefly, deprotection of the peptide and cleavage from
the resin were achieved by treatment with a trifluoroacetic acid/ethanedithiol mixture (95:5) at room temperature for 3 hours followed by reversed-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography purification.
Fluorescent labeling at the amino-terminus of the peptides was conducted by treatment with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a
dimethylformamide/methanol
mixture
(1:1)
for
1.5 hours followed by HPLC purification. The structure
of the products was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
As a control, we synthesized FITC-conjugated 11 polyglutamate (11E-FITC), which consists of 11 glutamates,
acidic amino acids, and FITC.
The structure of each peptide was as follows:
1. FITC-conjugated 11 poly-arginine (11R-FITC):
FITC-RRRRRRRRRRR-COOH
2. 11E-FITC
FITC-EEEEEEEEEEE-COOH.

Animal Studies
All animal procedures were approved by the Animal
Ethics Committee of Kurume University and followed
the Guide for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals
of the university. C57BL/6 male mice, aged 8-9 weeks (2024 g), were assigned to transient focal cerebral ischemia
followed by systemic injection of peptides.

Systemic Injection of Peptides
Mice were anesthetized by inhaling 1.2% concentration
of isoflurane in air under spontaneous breathing. 11RFITC (.2 mmol) or 11E-FITC (.2 mmol) was dissolved in
20-mL saline and then injected into the right femoral vein.
Transient Focal Cerebral Ischemia
Mice were anesthetized by inhaling 1.2% concentration
of isoflurane in air under spontaneous breathing. The
rectal temperature was controlled at 37.0 6 .5 C via a
temperature-regulated heating pad during surgery. Focal
cerebral ischemia was induced by occluding the middle
cerebral artery (MCA) using the intraluminal filament
technique. The right common carotid artery (CCA) was
exposed via a midline pretracheal incision. The external
carotid artery was ligated. The CCA was then ligated
permanently, and a small incision was made 1 mm distal
to the ligation. A 6-0 nylon monofilament coated with silicone (Doccol Corporation, Sharon, MA) was introduced
through a small incision in CCA and advanced 9 mm
distal to the carotid bifurcation. The wound was sutured
and the animal returned to its cage. After a 120-minute
occlusion period, the mouse was reanesthetized and
reperfusion was accomplished by withdrawing the intraluminal filament from the CCA. Immediately after reperfusion, .2 mmol 11R-FITC or .2 mmol 11E-FITC dissolved in
20-mL saline was injected into the right femoral vein.
Assessment of Cerebral Blood Flow
To monitor regional cerebral blood flow continuously, a
laser Doppler flowmetry probe was fixed to the intact
skull (2 mm posterior and 5 mm lateral to the bregma).
Only mice whose regional cerebral blood flow showed a
drop of more than 70% from the baseline just after
MCAO were included.

Immunohistochemistry
At 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours after peptide injection, mice were
deeply anesthetized with an overdose of pentobarbital and
perfused transcardially with heparinized physiological saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in .1 M
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The brains and livers
were removed, cut into 2-mm coronal sections, fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde in .1 M PBS for 4 hours, and
immersed in 30% sucrose in .1 M PBS overnight. Brains
were embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek; Sakura Finetek, Tokyo, Japan) and
frozen in liquid nitrogen. Brain and liver sections at a thickness of 10 mm were prepared using a cryostat. The sections
were washed 3 times in .1 M PBS and then immersed for
30 minutes in 1% vH2O2 and preblocked with .1% Triton
X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 hour.
The brain sections were then incubated with goat antiFITC polyclonal antibody (1:200; GeneTex, Irvine, CA)

and then the sections were incubated with biotinylated
anti-goat immunoglobulin G (IgG) (H 1 L) (1:200; Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 2 hours. The reaction
products were visualized using an ABC kit (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) followed by 3,30 -Diaminobenzidine, tetrahydrochloride (DAB) as a substrate.
For double-labeled immunofluorescence staining, sections were washed 3 times in .1 M PBS and preblocked
with .1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin in
PBS for 1 hour. The sections were then incubated with
goat anti-FITC polyclonal antibody (1:200 dilution;

(1:100 dilution; Bioss, Wobum, MA), rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) polyclonal antibody

then the sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor488
donkey anti-goat IgG (H 1 L) (1:200 dilution; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and Alexa Fluor594 donkey
anti-rabbit IgG (H 1 L) (1:200; Invitrogen) for 2 hours.
Excess antibody was washed 3 times, and the sections
were observed under a confocal microscope (FV-1000;
Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

Optical Density Measurement
Quantification of the optical density (OD) of 11R-FITC
immunoreactivity was performed using ImageJ software

(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The cortex
and the striatum were outlined manually, and OD was
automatically analyzed on gray-scale images using a computer program. The baseline OD quantified 11R-FITC
immunoreactivity in the brain slices of mice without 11RFITC injection. Previous studies have shown that OD measurements reflect changes in protein expression parallel to
those obtained using a biochemical protein assay.15,16

Statistical Analyses
Data are shown as the mean (standard error of the
mean). Data were analyzed by analysis of variance to
compare means between multiple groups followed by
post hoc examination, and P less than .05 was considered
significant.

Results
Transduction of 11R-FITC into the Normal Brain
To investigate whether 11R is capable of in vivo delivery
into the intact brain across the BBB, mice were systemically
administrated 11R-FITC. Strong immunoreactivity was
observed in the vessels of the cortex, striatum, and thalamus and in the cells surrounding the vessels 1 hour after
injection (Fig 1, A). 11R-FITC was also efficiently delivered
to the median eminence, where the BBB is not present (Fig
1, A).17,18 A weak immunoreactive signal was observed in
the cells of the cortex, striatum, and thalamus at 4 hours
(Fig 1, B) and had almost disappeared throughout all

regions in the brain 8 hours after the injection (data not
shown). To investigate whether the transduction of 11RFITC was mediated by the poly-arginine motif, 11E-FITC
was systemically administrated into mice. 11E-FITC was
not detected in any regions of the brain (Fig 1, C). These results suggest that 11R is capable of in vivo delivery to the
cells surrounding the vessels across the BBB but cannot
deliver extensively to the brain regions.
To observe the amount of 11R-FITC trapped in the liver,
we observed the immunoreactivity in the liver after
administration of 11R-FITC. Strong immunoreactivity
was observed in the liver at 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours after
11R-FITC administration (data not shown), suggesting
that a considerable number of peptides were trapped in
the liver.

Transduction of 11R-FITC to Neurons
To identify the cells receiving 11R-FITC in the normal
brain, mice were systemically administrated 11R-FITC.
At 4 hours after injection, the localization of 11R-FITC
was examined by immunostaining against a neuronal
specific marker, NeuN. As expected, 11R-FITC was efficiently delivered to NeuN-positive neurons (Fig 2, A-C).

Notably, 11R-FITC was also colocalized with GFAP, a
marker protein of astrocytes in the striatum (Fig 2, D-F),
suggesting that 11R could be delivered to both neuronal
and non-neuronal cells across the BBB on systemic
administration. In contrast, 11R-FITC was not colocalized
with Iba1, a microglia/macrophage marker, suggesting
that 11R-FITC is delivered in neither microglia nor macrophages (Fig 2, G-I).

Transduction of 11R-FITC into the Ischemic Brain
Lesion
On successful delivery of 11R to the intact brain, we
next investigated in vivo delivery into an ischemic lesion
in the mouse brain (Fig 3, A). We performed MCA occlusion in mice for 2 hours and then systemically administrated 11R-FITC. At 1 hour after injection of 11R-FITC,
strong immunoreactivity of 11R-FITC was observed in
both contralateral and ipsilateral regions, such as the
cortex and striatum of the brain (Fig 3, B); however, the
localization of 11R-FITC was apparently different between the 2 regions. In the contralateral region, where
the BBB was still intact after ischemia, 11R-FITC was
mainly found in cells surrounding vessels, the same as

in the normal brain, shown in Figure 1 (Fig 3, B). On the
other hand, on the ipsilateral side, where the BBB was
opened by transient ischemia, 11R-FITC was intensively
delivered to cells of the cortex and striatum in addition
to the vessel areas (Fig 3, B). At 2 and 4 hours after injection, strong immunoreactivity of 11R-FITC was observed
in cells in the ipsilateral region, whereas 11R-FITC was
faint on the contralateral side. Even at 8 hours after injection, 11R-FITC was still detectable on the ipsilateral side
with some leakage of 11R-FITC to the interstitium. In
contrast, 11R-FITC had disappeared on the contralateral
side 8 hours after injection (Fig 3, B). To investigate
whether 11R-FITC selectively crosses the BBB in a CPP-

dependent manner or just diffuses through altered BBB
during ischemic injury on the ipsilateral side, 11E-FITC
was systemically administrated after transient ischemia.
11E-FITC was not detected in either contralateral or ipsilateral regions of the brain (Fig 3, C).
To confirm that 11R-FITC was not delivered into microglia/macrophages activated by ischemia, double-labeled
immunofluorescence staining was performed with antiIba1 and anti-FITC antibodies in the ischemic region.
11R-FITC was not colocalized with Iba1 at 4 hours after
injection (Fig 4).

FITC in cortex and striatum at each time point after the
administration (Fig 5, A,B). In both the cortex and striatum, immunoreactivity of 11R-FITC on the ipsilateral
side was significantly higher than on the contralateral
side (P 5 .0043 in cortex and P 5 .0031 in striatum).
Although the time effect was not significant, on the ipsilateral side, 11R-FITC was at its highest 1 hour after injection in the cortex and remained detectable in the cortex
and striatum for 8 hours after administration.

Discussion
In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether
11R could cross the BBB and reach cells in a normal brain
or with an ischemic injury. In the intact brain, 11R-FITC
was observed throughout the brain, including the cortex,
striatum, and thalamus. Although 11R was highly localized in vessels, it was also detected in both neuronal
and non-neuronal cells in the peripheral brain area
surrounding vessels. These results suggest that 11R is
capable of crossing the BBB and being delivered into the
brain; however, the delivery efficiency of 11R in the intact
brain is relative low when compared with that in nonneuronal regions.13,19 The low efficiency of peptide
delivery by 11R may be because of the unique biological
properties of BBB and the pharmacokinetic properties of
11R. To prevent leakage of harmful molecules into the
nervous system, the endothelial cells in the BBB are
cemented together by tight junctions and have reduced

macropinocytosis.20 Because CPP-mediated delivery is
mainly through macropinocytosis,8 uptake of 11R would
be, thus, inevitably attenuated in an intact BBB. In addition, a large amount of 11R may be metabolized by BBBspecific drug efflux transporters or peptidases.21 On the
other hand, the low transduction efficiency of 11R could
also be because of a decrease in the net amount of circulating 11R because we detected a considerable amount
of 11R-FITC peptides trapped in the liver after systemic
administration (data not shown). Nevertheless, the current results suggest that 11R-mediated delivery is a reliable tool for brain delivery compared with the
controversial TAT-mediated delivery.
It is generally accepted that the molecular weight of molecules transported into the brain through the BBB is less
than 400-600 Da.22-24 In the present study, however, 11RFITC, with a molecular weight of 2239 Da, could be
delivered into the brain. Moreover, a previous study
showed that TAT-derived PTD was capable of transducing
b-galactosidase, which has a molecular weight of more
than 100 kDa, into the brain. These results suggest that
there may be no limit to the molecular weight of molecules
transduced by CPP. Further study of the size dependency
of protein delivery into the brain using 11R is required.
11R-mediated delivery was greatly enhanced in the
ischemic model up to 8 hours after systemic administration. Interestingly, 11R was not detected in large vessels
on the ischemic side compared with the dense localization of 11R on the contralateral side. This may be caused

by reduced cerebral blood flow on the ischemic side of the
brain by microcirculatory disturbances and occlusion of
CCA.25 The precise mechanism by which delivery of
11R was enhanced on the ischemic side is unclear. It is
known that, in disease states, the BBB becomes less
restrictive to proteins or cells by enhanced transcytosis
through altered tight junctions.20 Such leakage of the
BBB could continue for up to several weeks following
temporary focal ischemia.26 The enhanced uptake of 11R
could be caused by a leaky BBB during transient ischemic
injury; however, given the finding that poly-glutamate
(11E) did not cross the BBB at all, it is unlikely that 11R
crossed the BBB through a nonspecific diffusion model.
Rather, 11R was delivered through a highly regulated
CPP-dependent manner in the ischemic brain.
In addition to the biological properties, the pathogenicity of PTD-mediated delivery needs to be taken into
consideration for therapeutic utilization. Thus, consideration is particularly important when using virus-derived
PTD such as TAT. Indeed, TAT has been shown to
impair neuronal activity and learning and memory.27-29
Therefore, although some groups have used TAT to
deliver proteins into an intact brain or ischemic regions
of the brain,9,10,30 it is conceivable that TAT might cause
unexpected side effects in the brain. In contrast to TAT,
11R is a synthetic peptide and has not been associated
with any pathogenesis during in vivo administration.13
Taken together, our results suggest that 11R may be
used as a potential tool to deliver therapeutic molecules
to the brain for the treatment of ischemia.

Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrated that 11R could be delivered to the intact brain across the BBB on systemic administration. Furthermore, the delivery was remarked
enhanced and continued up to 8 hours in the brain area
affected by transient ischemic injury, suggesting the potential therapeutic application of 11R-mediated delivery.
