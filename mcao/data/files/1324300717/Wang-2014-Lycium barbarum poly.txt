Abstract
Aims of the Study: To investigate the neuroprotective effect of Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (LBP) on focal cerebral
ischemic injury in mice and to explore its possible mechanism.
Materials and Methods: Male ICR mice were used to make the model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) after
intragastric administration with LBP (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) and Nimodipine (0.4 mg/kg) for seven successive days. After
24 h of reperfusion, neurological scores were estimated and infarct volumes were measured by 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) staining. Morphological changes in ischemic brains were performed for hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The
number of apoptotic neurons was detected by TUNEL staining. The Bax, Bcl-2 protein expression and CytC, Caspase-3, -9
and cleaved PARP-1 activation were investigated by immunofluorescence and western-blot analysis.
Results: LBP (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) treatment groups significantly reduced infract volume and neurological deficit scores.
LBP also relieved neuronal morphological damage and attenuated the neuronal apoptosis. LBP at the dose of 40 mg/kg
significantly suppressed overexpression of Bax, CytC, Caspase-3, -9 and cleaved PARP-1, and inhibited the reduction of Bcl-2
expression.
Conclusions: Based on these findings we propose that LBP protects against focal cerebral ischemic injury by attenuating the
mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.

In the intrinsic pathway, release of CytC leads to the formation
of the apoptosome and then promotes the activation of
procaspase-9 [6]. The clustering of procaspase-9 leads to
caspase-9 activation. Caspase-9, which is considered as an initiator
of the mitochondria-dependent caspase cascade, then activates
caspase-3 [7]. Caspase-3 can cleave many substrate proteins, such
as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) [8,9]. Overactivation of
PARP after cleavage by caspase-3 leads to DNA injury and
subsequently to apoptotic cell death [5]. On the other hand,
apoptosis is also regulated by a series of protein systems, one of
these systems is the Bcl-2 family [10,11]. Bax, as a major
proapoptotic protein in the Bcl-2 family, plays a key role in
promoting apoptosis [12,13]. Bcl-2 protein is an important

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is a major cause of human death and disability
worldwide [1]. In the process of cerebral ischemia, a cascade of
pathological mechanisms including excessive release of excitatory
amino acids, energy failure, increased oxidative stress and
apoptosis will be activated, eventually resulting in acute cerebral
ischemic injury [2,3]. Apoptosis is one of the primary factors in cell
death after cerebral ischemia reperfusion, it is an initiative suicide
process after the cells receive related signals [4]. There are two
major pathways of apoptosis after cerebral ischemia: the intrinsic
pathway and the extrinsic pathway, the intrinsic pathway, also
called mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, is originated from
mitochondrial release of cytochromec (CytC) and associated
stimulation of caspase-3 [5].

LBP Inhibits Focal Cerebral Ischemic Injury

The HE staining could visually show the histological changes in
neurons of mice brains in different groups (Figure 2). In the shamoperated group, morphology of neurons in ischemic penumbra of
the cortex was round or oval in shape and the nucleus were clear.
After MCAO, a large number of apoptotic neurons with
karyopyknosis, cell gaps and debris could be observed in vehicle
group. LBP (10, 20, 40 mg/kg, i.g.) groups and Nimodipine group
alleviated the symptoms of apoptosis in different degrees.
All of these findings indicated that LBP reduced brain injury
induced by cerebral ischemia. In addition, these results revealed
that the neuroprotective effect in the 40 mg/kg LBP group is more
obvious than that in 10 and 20 mg/kg LBP groups.

inhibitor of apoptosis which prevents the release of CytC and
Caspase activation [14,15].
Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (LBP), a major active ingredient
of Lycium barbarum, has been reported to have several pharmacological activities such as anti-oxidative [16], anti-proliferate [17]
and hypoglycemic effect [18]. Our previous study demonstrated
that LBP has protective effects on hippocampus neurons model of
ischemic cerebral injury in vitro [19]. In the present study, we
examined the protective effects of LBP in a model of middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice. Furthermore, we
investigated the relations between the effects of LBP and the
mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in mice brains after stroke.
Nimodipine, as a classic clinic drug in stroke, has shown obviously
beneficial effects on active treatment in previous studies [20,21].
So it was also used as a positive control in this study.

Effects of LBP on TUNEL-positive cells after cerebral
ischemic injury
We next examined whether LBP helped to prevent cerebral
ischemia-induced DNA fragmentation. In the TUNEL staining,
the TUNEL-positive cells were darkly stained and showed the
morphologic signs of apoptosis (Figure 3A). In the vehicle group,
the apoptosis rate in ischemic penumbra of the left cortex was
significantly increased. Treatment with LBP significantly reduced
the number of TUNEL- positive cells compared with vehicle
group after 24h of reperfusion, and the apoptosis rate was reduced
obviously in LBP (10, 20, 40mg/kg) groups and Nimodipine group
respectively (Figure 3B, P,0.05).

Results and Discussion
LBP provided neuroprotection after cerebral ischemia in
MCAO mice
In the representative photographs of TTC staining (Figure 1A),
normal brain tissues appeared uniform red while the infarction
region showed white. There was no infarct found in the sham mice
brain and an obvious infarcted area appeared in the vehicle group.
The infarction regions were significantly decreased after MCAO
in LBP (20 and 40 mg/kg, i.g.) groups (p,0.05) and Nimodipine
group (P,0.01) compared with vehicle group (Figure 1B).
The neurological deficits could be observed in mice after
cerebral ischemic injury. As shown in Figure 1C, the neurological
deficits were significantly increased in the vehicle-ischemic group
compared to sham-operated group (P,0.01). However, after
treatment with LBP and Nimodipine, the neurological deficit
scores were reduced respectively, and the effects of LBP (20,
40 mg/kg, i.g.) groups and Nimodipine (0.4 mg/kg, i.g.) groups
were significant (P,0.01).

LBP influenced the expression of apoptosis related
factors
The caspase-3 activity in ischemic hemisphere of vehicle group
increased significantly compared with sham-operated group (P,
0.01). The activities of caspase-3 were markedly reduced in LBP
40 mg/kg treatment group and Nimodipine group (Figure 4; both
P,0.05).
In the Immunofluorescence assay, the fluorescence intensity
showed the activations of apoptosis related factors. Results of
immunohistochemistry showed that the fluorescence intensity of

apoptosis pathway, the activations of CytC, Caspase-3, -9 and
cleaved PARP-1 were markedly increased in vehicle group
compared with sham-operated group. After treatment with
40 mg/kg LBP or 0.4 mg/kg Nimodipine, the activations of these
four apoptotic factors were obviously reduced compared with
vehicle group (Figure 6D, 7D, 9B and 10B, p,0.05).

Bax protein and CytC, Caspase-3 were significantly higher in the
vehicle group than sham-operated group (P,0.05), and these
increase were significantly attenuated by LBP 40 mg/kg and
Nimodipine groups (Figure 5B, 6B and 7B, P,0.05). The
expression of Bcl-2 protein was decreased significantly in vehicle
group (p,0.05) compared with sham-operated group. Treatment
with 40 mg/kg LBP or 0.4 mg/kg Nimodipine could significantly
increase the level of Bcl-2 protein (Figure 8B, p,0.01).
In addition, we assessed the Bax, Bcl-2 protein expression and
CytC, Caspase-3, -9 and cleaved PARP-1 activation in ischemic
brain tissues by Western blot analysis after 24 h of reperfusion.
The protein level of Bax was increased while the expression of Bcl2 protein was decreased significantly in vehicle group compared
with sham-operated group. In the LBP 40 mg/kg group and
Nimodipine group, expression of Bax was decreased significantly
(Figure 5D, p,0.01). LBP 40 mg/kg group and Nimodipine
group significantly inhibited the reduction of Bcl-2 expression
(Figure 8D, p,0.01). As proapoptotic markers in mitochondrial

Ischemic brain disease has become one of the most devastating
diseases which cause high rates of disability and mortality in aged
persons [22]. Several harmful pathological changes have taken
place in the process of cerebral ischemia, which cause a difficult
determination of the more appropriate drug target. Then it is a
great challenge to find a novel pharmacological drug with
protective effect in cerebral ischemic injury. Traditional Chinese
Medicines are proved to have many bioactivities which provide
neuroprotective effects in ischemic brain disease [23-25]. In the

LBP Inhibits Focal Cerebral Ischemic Injury

MCAO mice and its pharmacological mechanism related with
mitochondrial apoptosis pathway after cerebral ischemic injury.
Previous studies have demonstrated neuronal cell apoptosis
plays an important role in the evolution of ischemic injury in the
brain tissue [26]. Mitochondrial apoptosis pathway is a major
apoptosis pathway, a large number of apoptosis-related proteins
are found in mitochondria, including cytochromec (CytC),
apoptosisinducingfactor (AIF), procaspase -3, -8 and -9 [27].
Cerebral ischemia can promote a series of pathological changes in
neuronal cells such as mitochondrial membrane depolarization
and permeability transition pore opening [28]. CytC binds and
activates apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) as well as
procaspase-9, they form an apoptosome together with ATP.
Apoptosome then activates Caspase-9 and Caspase-9 leads to
Caspase-3 activation, ultimately cell death occurs [29]. Caspase-3
has been identified as a key mediator of apoptosis and cleaves the
substrate protein - poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). PARP-1
is a multifunctional nuclear enzyme whose activity is rapidly
stimulated by DNA breaks [30], overactivation of cleaved PARP-1
can cause DNA fragmentation and cell dysfunctions, and then
promote cell death. On the other hand, proapoptotic and
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins are believed to play important
roles in mitochondrial apoptosis pathway [31,32]. Bax is a
proapoptotic and Bcl-2 is an antiapoptotic protein in the Bcl-2
family. An appropriate ratio of Bax and Bcl-2 can keep
homeostatic state in cells and ensure cell survival.

induced apoptosis by LBP is associated with mitochondria
apoptosis pathway.
In this study, the mice focal cerebral ischemic injury was
produced by 2 hours of MCAO and reperfusion for 24 hours. The
optimal duration of treatment and optimal therapeutic dose of
LBP against cerebral ischemic injury were not fully elucidated.
Besides mitochondria apoptosis pathway, there is the other major
apoptosis pathway, the extrinsic pathway, which originates from
the activation of cell surface death receptors, so it needs further
research in the future study to investigate the best treatment
options of LBP in cerebral ischemic injury.

Conclusion
In this study, treatment of MCAO mice with LBP could
markedly reduce neurological deficit scores and infract volume in
ischemic brains. Morphological changes of apoptotic cells induced
by MCAO were inhibited in LBP treatment groups respectively.
LBP also showed a significant effect to decrease the number of
apoptotic neurons. To investigate its possible anti-apoptotic
mechanism, we have measured some apoptosis-related proteins
especially mitochondrial apoptosis pathway-related proteins.
Activity of caspase-3 in ischemic brain of MCAO mice was
markedly attenuated after treatment with 40 mg/kg LBP. The
results of immunofluorescence and western-blot analysis demonstrated that LBP with the dose of 40 mg/kg could significantly
suppress the overexpression of Bax, CytC, Caspase-3, -9 and
cleaved PARP-1 and promote Bcl-2 expression in ischemic mice

These results in the present study indicated that LBP had
neuroprotective effect in focal cerebral ischemic injury in mice.

dissolved with physiological saline. The experiments were
performed as approved by the institutional animal care and use
committee of Ningxia Medical University. All surgery was
performed under chloral hydrate anesthesia, and all efforts were
made to minimize suffering. All of the mice were randomly divided
into the following six groups (n = 18, for each group): shamoperated groups (sham); vehicle-treated ischemic model group
(vehicle); 10 mg/kg LBP-treated ischemic group (10 mg/kg);
20 mg/kg LBP-treated ischemic group (20 mg/kg); 40 mg/kg
LBP-treated ischemic group (40 mg/kg) and 0.4 mg/kg Nimodipine-treated ischemic group (Nimodipine). LBP and Nimodipine
were given by intragastric gavage for seven consecutive days
before cerebral ischemia. Sham and vehicle groups were treated
with physiological saline under the same conditions.

Evaluation of Neurological Deficits
The neurological deficit scores in each group (n = 6) were
performed after 2 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. Deficits
scores were carried out according to a five-point scale adapted
from a previous publication [34]. A score of 0 was given if the
mouse was demonstrated normal spontaneous movements (no
neurological deficit); 1 was given if the mouse was unable to extend
right paw fully; 2 was given if the mouse was circling to right; 3
was given if the mouse was falling to right and 4 was given if the
mouse was unable to walk spontaneously. All the neurological
evaluations were performed by a researcher who was unaware of
the different groups.

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) Model
Focal cerebral ischemia was produced by the method as
described previously [33] except mice in sham group. After
anesthetized with 3.5% chloral hydrate, the mice were used to
make a neck incision. Then the left external carotid artery (ECA)
and internal carotid artery (ICA) were exposed and separated
carefully. A length of monofilament nylon suture (15 mm) was

The homogenate was centrifuged at 20, 000 g and 4uC for
15 min. Substrate cleavage was measured with a microplate
reader (Bio-Rad, U.S.A) at 405 nm, and then was corrected as
protein content in the lysate. The Caspase-3 activity was expressed
as values of enzyme activity compared with control.

TUNEL staining
DNA fragmentation was performed by In Situ Cell Death
Detection Kit (Roche, Germany) and was detected under optical
microscope. On brief, mice (n = 6, for each group) were deeply
anesthetized by 3.5% choral hydrate after 24 h of reperfusion,
then perfused with physiological saline and 4% paraformaldehyde
from the heart to the systemic vascular. The brains were collected
and embedded in paraffin, coronal sections (5mm thick) were taken
from brain and stained according to the methods provided by the
manufacturer. Apoptotic cells were stained brown due to the
binding of dUTP enzyme to their fragmented DNA. Apoptotic
neurons in the ischemic cortex were counted for five fields per
section under high-power magnification (4006) by a blinded
manner.

Western blot Analysis
After 24 h of reperfusion, the mice (n = 6, for each group) were
decapitated and ischemic brains were collected. Protein lysates of
ischemic hemispheres in each group were subjected to 8% or 12%
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membrane. The membrane was treated with blocking solution
(5% skim milk in TBST) and incubated overnight at 4uC with the
primary rabbit monoclonal antibodies respectively (Bax, 1:1000;
Bcl-2, 1:500; Caspase-3, 1:1000; Caspase-9, 1:500; Proteintech
Group, U.S.A.; CytC, 1:1000; Abcam, U.K. and PARP-1, 1:500;
Cell Signal, U.S.A.). Secondary incubations were performed with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody
(1:3000; Proteintech Group, U.S.A.). An anti-actin antibody
(1:1000; Proteintech Group, U.S.A.) was used as loading controls.
Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) and the signals were quantified by densitometry with a Western blotting detection system (Quantity One, BioRad, U.S.A.).

Immunofluorescence analysis and hematoxylin-eosin
(HE) staining
Immunofluorescence and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining for
ischemic brain tissue were performed on paraffin sections which
were prepared using the same method as in TUNEL staining.
After incubation in 0.5% H2O2 followed by normal goat serum to
avoid nonspecific immunoreactions, the sections (n = 6, for each
group) were incubated with primary antibodies of Bax, Bcl-2,
CytC and Caspase-3, (Bax, 1:50; Bcl-2, 1:50; Caspase-3, 1:50;
Proteintech Group, U.S.A. and CytC, 1:50; Abcam, U.K.) at 4uC
overnight. The next day, sections were washed with PBS for
15 min and incubated for 1 h at 37uC with FITC-labeled Goat
Anti-Rabbit IgG (1:20; Proteintech Group, U.S.A.). Mean density
of Bax, Bcl-2, CytC and Caspase-3 in mice brains per section
(4006) was measured with microscope image-analysis software
(Image-Pro plus, U.S.A.) by a single investigator who was blind to
sample identity.

Statistical analysis
All values were expressed throughout as mean 6 SEM. The
statistical significance of differences between the various groups
was assessed using one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc test.
Data of two groups were analyzed by unpaired t test. A value of P
,0.05 was considered statistically significant using SPSS 13.0
Statistical Software.
