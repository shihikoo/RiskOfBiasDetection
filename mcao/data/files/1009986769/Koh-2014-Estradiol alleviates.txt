Estradiol has protective and reparative effects in neurodegenerative diseases. Hippocalcin is a neuronal
calcium-sensor protein that acts as a calcium buffer to regulate the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ .
This study was investigated to elucidate whether estradiol regulates hippocalcin expression in a focal
cerebral ischemia model and glutamate-treated neuronal cells. An ovariectomy was performed in adult
female rats, and vehicle or estradiol was administered before middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
Cerebral cortex tissues were collected at 24 h after MCAO. A proteomic approach revealed that hippocalcin
expression decreased in vehicle-treated animals with combined MCAO, while estradiol treatment attenuated this decrease. Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analyses also showed that estradiol
administration prevented the MCAO injury-induced decrease in hippocalcin expression. In cultured hippocampal cells, glutamate exposure increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which was rescued
by the presence of estradiol. Moreover, glutamate toxicity decreased hippocalcin expression, whereas
estradiol attenuated this decrease. Together, these ﬁndings suggest that estradiol has a neuroprotective
function by regulating hippocalcin expression and intracellular Ca2+ levels in ischemic brain injury.

Estradiol is a representative female sexual steroid hormone. In
addition to its reproductive function, estradiol plays a neuroprotective role against neuronal cells injury [26,28]. Estradiol prevents
neuronal cells death in response to oxidative stress and alleviates
brain lesions in focal cerebral ischemia [5,7]. Clinical studies have
demonstrated that estradiol reduces the progression of Alzheimer’s
disease and the risk of stroke [7,19]. Consistent with this, the
risk of neurological diseases increases in postmenopausal women
compared to age-matched men [3,22]. However, premenopausal
women suffer less from neurodegenerative diseases than adult men
[22]. Moreover, estradiol replacement therapy reduces the mortality of stroke-related deaths [23].

Intracellular Ca2+ is involved in neuronal cells growth, neuronal
transmission, and synaptic plasticity [2]. However, an excessive
increase in intracellular Ca2+ activates the caspase cascade, leading to cell death and neuronal disorder [9]. Ischemic brain injury
increases intracellular Ca2+ levels and leads to apoptotic and
necrotic cell death [25]. Hippocalcin is a calcium-binding protein
that is expressed mainly in the brain. It belongs to the neuronal
calcium-sensor protein family and acts as a calcium buffer because
it binds to Ca2+ that is released in the cytoplasm [10,21]. Thus,
regulation of hippocalcin expression is considered important for
intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Moreover, it has been reported that
estradiol reduces the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration
that occurs following neuronal injury [14]. Although previous studies have demonstrated that estradiol regulates Ca2+ concentration,
it is unclear whether hippocalcin is regulated by estradiol in
ischemic brain injury. A proteomics technique was used to identify various proteins that are differentially expressed following

estradiol treatment during ischemic brain injury. Among these
identiﬁed proteins, we focused on change of hippocalcin. In this
study, we investigated whether estradiol regulates hippocalcin
expression in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) animal
model and glutamate-exposed neuronal cells.
Female Sprague-Dawley rats (220–230 g, n = 60) were purchased from Samtako Co. (Animal Breeding Center, Korea) and
maintained under controlled temperature and lighting (12 h/12 h
light/dark cycle) with free access to food and water. Animals
were divided randomly into the following four groups: vehicle + sham, estradiol + sham, vehicle + MCAO, and estradiol + MCAO
groups (n = 15 per group). Animals were subjected to an ovariectomy and were implanted with a silastic capsule containing
sesame oil (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA. vehicle) or 17␤-estradiol
(180 ␮g/ml, Sigma). This capsule of 17␤-estradiol consistently
produces estradiol levels equivalent to circulating physiological
levels [5].
Animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital
(100 mg/kg) and MCAO was performed as described previously [15]. Brieﬂy, the bifurcation of the right common carotid
artery was exposed through a midline incision. The internal
carotid artery and external carotid artery were dissected from the
adjacent tissues. A 4/0 monoﬁlament nylon with its tip rounded
by heat was gently inserted from the external carotid artery into
the internal carotid artery, and advanced up to the origin of the
middle cerebral artery. Sham-operated animals were subjected to
the same surgical process without arterial blockade.
Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed for the
histopathological ﬁnding. Brain tissues were ﬁxed in 4% phosphate
buffered paraformaldehyde solution, embedded with parafﬁn, and
cut into 4 ␮m coronal section. The parafﬁn section were deparafﬁned in xylene and rehydrated in gradient ethanol from 100% to
70%. The sections were generally stained with hematoxylin and
eosin solution. The stained sections were dehydrated using gradient ethanol, slipped with permount (Sigma), and observed under
light microscope.
A proteomic analysis was performed as previously described
[11]. Right cerebral cortices were homogenized in lysis buffer (8 M
urea, 4% CHAPS, ampholytes, and 40 mM Tris–HCl). Protein extracts
were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 ◦ C. Bradford assay kit
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used to determine total protein
concentration. Total protein (100 ␮g) was subjected to isoelectric
focusing (IEF) on immobilized pH gradient (IPG) gel strips (pH 4–7
and pH 6–9, 17 cm, Bio-Rad). IEF was performed using a multistep protocol: 250 V (15 min), 10,000 V (3 h), and then 10,000 V to
50,000 V using a Protean IEF Cell (Bio-Rad). After equilibration of
the IEF strips, strips were applied to gradient gels (7.5–17.5%) for
second dimension electrophoresis. Gels were loaded on Protein-II
XI electrophoresis equipment (Bio-Rad) at 5 mA for 2 h followed
by 10 mA for 10 h at 10 ◦ C. Gels were ﬁxed in 12% acetic acid and
50% methanol for 2 h, and stained with silver solution (0.2% silver nitrate, 0.75 ml/l formaldehyde) for 20 min. Gel images were
recorded immediately using Agfar ARCUS 1200TM (Agfar-Gevaert,
Mortsel, BEL). Spot analysis was performed using PDQuest 2-D analysis software (Bio-Rad). Gel pieces containing the desired protein
spots were excised and destained for MALDI-TOF. Gel particles
were digested in trypsin-containing buffer. Extract peptides were
analyzed using a Voyager-DETM STR biospectrometry workstation
(Applied Biosystem, Foster city, CA, USA) for MALDI-TOF mass
spectrometry. Proteins were identiﬁed using the search programs
MS-Fit and ProFound. SWISS-PROT and NCBI were used as the target protein sequence databases. The intensity of protein spots was
measured using PDQuest software. The spot intensity is described
as a ratio of the intensity of that spot in the experimental group
relative to that of the corresponding spot in the vehicle + sham
group.

Right cerebral cortices were collected and frozen quickly.
Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed
with total RNA (1 ␮g) and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The following primers were used: hippocalcin primer (forward primer, 5 -ACGCCAACTTCTTCCCCTATG-3 ; reverse primer,
5 -AGCCATCAGCGTCTTTGTTT-3 ) and actin primer (forward
primer, 5 -GGGTCAGAAGGACTCCTACG-3 ; reverse primer, 5 TTTCACTGCGGCTGATGTAG-3 ). The ampliﬁcation program
consists of a denaturating at 94 ◦ C for 30 s, annealing at 54 ◦ C
for 30 s, and extension at 72 ◦ C for 1 min. Samples were ampliﬁed
for 30 cycles. PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel and
visualized under UV light.
For Western blot analysis, equal amounts of protein (30 ␮g)
were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred
to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA). Membranes were incubated with 5% skim milk solution
for 1 h and then washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1%
Tween-20 (TBST). Membranes were probed with the following
antibodies: anti-hippocalcin (diluted 1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge,
UK) and anti-actin (diluted 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA) as primary antibodies at 4 ◦ C for 15 h. Membranes were then rinsed with TBST and incubated with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000, Pierce, Rockford,
IL, USA). Immunoreactivity was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Western blotting detection kit, Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
Mouse hippocampal cells (HT22) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Hyclone Laboratory,
Logan, UT, USA) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum

(Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), penicillin (100 U/ml), and
streptomycin (100 ␮g/ml) at 37 ◦ C under an atmosphere of 95%
air and 5% CO2 [17]. Cells were seeded onto 60-mm tissue culture
dishes at a density of 100,000 cells per dish, and were cultured for
24 h. Glutamate (Sigma) was added to cells at a ﬁnal concentration of 5 mM and cells were then incubated for 24 h. 17␤-Estradiol
was added 15 min before the addition of glutamate (Sigma). 17␤Estradiol was dissolved in 95% ethanol at a concentration of 1 mM
and diluted to the appropriate concentration (1 ␮M or 10 ␮M) in
culture medium. This concentration of ethanol had no effect on
cell viability or glutamate toxicity. Cell viability was determined
by measuring metabolism of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT). MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was
added to each well in serum-free medium and cells were incubated
for 2 h. Medium was removed and formazan dye was trapped in the
living cells. Absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm.

Cell survival was expressed as the percentage of neuroprotection
vs. vehicle (set to100%).
Cells were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed
with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), incubated with 5% normal
goat serum (Jackson Immuno Research labs, West Grove, PA, USA)
for 1 h, and then washed with PBS. Cells were reacted with antihippocalcin antibody (diluted 1:100, Cell Signaling) at 4 ◦ C for
15 h, followed by reaction with a ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)conjugated secondary antibody (1:200, Jackson Immuno Research
labs). The positive cells for hippocalcin were observed under a ﬂuorescence microscope (AXIO, Carl Zeiss Corporation, Thornwood,
NY, USA).
Intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured with Fura2/AM [18]. Fura-2/AM, a calcium-sensitive ﬂuorescent dye, is a
ﬂuorescent intracellular Ca2+ indicator. Fura-2/AM ﬂuorescence
dual-wavelength excitation was performed as described previously

with the MTT assay (A). Cell survival was expressed as a percentage of vehicle-treated cells. Neurons were labeled with Fura-2/AM, and ﬂuorescence spectra for calcium were
measured using a luminescence spectrophotometer (B). Densitometric analysis results are presented as the ratio of hippocalcin intensity to actin intensity (C). Data (n = 3)

[6,11]. Cells were incubated in DMEM media containing 10 ␮M
fura-2/AM at 37 ◦ C for 1 h, then rinsed to remove fura-2/AM and
centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. Fura-2/AM ﬂuorescence signals
were measured with a luminescence spectrophotometer (LS50B,
Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA, USA). Fura-2 ﬂuorescence signals were
analyzed by a Micro Vax II computer and software (Origin 7).
All data are expressed as mean ± S.E.M. The results in each group
were compared by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed
by to post-hoc Scheffe’s test. A P < 0.05 was considered to represent
statistical signiﬁcance.
Fig. 1 showed the histopathological changes in ischemic core
area. Both necrotic cells and apoptotic cells were observed in
ischemic lesion of vehicle + MCAO animals (Fig. 1A). Apoptotic cells
typically appeared intensive dark apoptotic bodies and necrotic
cells contained scalloped shrunken form. However, sham-operated
animals had intact neurons (Fig. 1B and D). Moreover, estradiol
treatment decreased the apoptotic cells and necrotic cells during
MCAO (Fig. 1C). A proteomics approach revealed that hippocalcin protein expression was decreased in the cerebral cortices

of vehicle + MCAO animals compared to sham-operated animals.
However, estradiol treatment restored the MCAO injury-induced
decrease in hippocalcin expression (Fig. 2A). The peptide mass
of hippocalcin was 10/102 and the sequence of this protein was
52%. Hippocalcin levels were 0.38 ± 0.03 and 1.03 ± 0.04 in vehicle + MCAO and estradiol + MCAO animals, respectively (Fig. 2B).
Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analyses showed
that hippocalcin levels were decreased in vehicle + MCAO animals versus sham animals, whereas these decreases in hippocalcin
were attenuated in estradiol + MCAO animals (Fig. 2C and E). Transcript levels of hippocalcin were 0.57 ± 0.03 and 0.73 ± 0.02 in the
cerebral cortices of vehicle + MCAO and estradiol + MCAO animals,
respectively (Fig. 2D). Hippocalcin protein levels were 0.78 ± 0.02
and 1.05 ± 0.02 in the cerebral cortices of vehicle + MCAO and estradiol + MCAO animals, respectively (Fig. 2F). Hippocalcin transcript
and protein levels were similar in vehicle + sham and estradiol + sham animals.
Fig. 3A showed the neuroprotective effect of estradiol against
glutamate toxicity. Glutamate exposure dramatically decreased

36

cell viability, but estradiol treatment reduced neuronal cells death
resulting from glutamate toxicity. Moreover, glutamate treatment
increased intracellular Ca2+ levels, whereas estradiol treatment
attenuated the glutamate toxicity-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3B). Western blot analysis also showed that
hippocalcin expression decreased in the glutamate-treated group,
whereas estradiol treatment restored the glutamate exposureinduced decrease (Fig. 3C). Hippocalcin levels were 0.57 ± 0.03
in the glutamate-treated group, and 0.94 ± 0.04 and 1.07 ± 0.02
in the estradiol-treated groups (1 ␮M and 10 ␮M, respectively)
(Fig. 3D). Immunocytochemical staining clearly conﬁrmed the
hippocalcin-positive reaction in glutamate- and estradiol-treated
HT22 cells. The number of hippocalcin-positive cells decreased in
the glutamate-exposed group, whereas estradiol treatment attenuated this decrease (Fig. 3E).
We previously demonstrated that estradiol protects neuronal
cells from focal cerebral ischemia and glutamate toxicity-induced
cell death [12]. Estradiol has been shown to signiﬁcantly reduce
infarct lesions following ischemic stroke and improve neuronal
dysfunction [26,28]. Our previous study reported various proteins
that are differentially expressed following estradiol treatment during cerebral ischemia in an animal model using a proteomics
technique [27]. In this study, we additionally identiﬁed the
change of hippocalcin protein following estradiol treatment during
ischemic brain injury. Moreover, we demonstrated that estradiol
regulated hippocalcin expression and modulated intracellular Ca2+
levels in MCAO-induced injury and glutamate-induced neuronal
cells death.
An increase in intracellular Ca2+ triggers cell death due to
the activation of proteases and caspases [1,13]. Ischemic brain
injury leads to oxygen deprivation and intracellular Ca2+ elevation,
resulting in neuronal cells death [25]. Hippocalcin regulates calcium extrusion from neurons and protects neuronal cells against
calcium-dependent excitotoxin damage [20]. Our proteomics study
demonstrated that MCAO-induced injury caused a reduction in
hippocalcin expression, while estradiol administration attenuated
this reduction. Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analyses clearly conﬁrmed that MCAO injury decreased hippocalcin
expression and that estradiol prevented this decrease. These results
demonstrated that estradiol regulated hippocalcin expression in
MCAO animal model. A reduction in hippocalcin indicates an
increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels and the initiation of neuronal
cells death. Thus, maintenance of hippocalcin expression is important for regulating of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and preventing
neuronal cells death in ischemic brain injury.
MCAO induces a serious damage in cerebral cortex tissues
and estradiol prevents cell death of cerebral cortex following
MCAO. We observed the change of cerebral cortex from MCAO
with estradiol treatment through the histopathological ﬁnding.
Hippocalcin protein was detected as protein spots with different
intensities between vehicle and estradiol-treated animals during
MCAO injury. Hippocalcin is heavily expressed in the hippocampus.
HT22 cells were used in vitro study to elucidate the relationship
between estradiol and hippocalcin in ischemic injury. Glutamate
toxicity is a major cause of neuronal cells death in neurodegenerative diseases [4]. Glutamate toxicity produces excess free radicals
and leads to oxidative stress [4,17]. Glutamate activates glutamate receptors, prolongs neuronal depolarization, and triggers the
deregulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis [1]. Estradiol rapidly
reduces glutamate-stimulated intracellular Ca2+ overload in primary hippocampal neuron cultures [8]. Furthermore, estradiol
modulates the concentration of Ca2+ in the mitochondrial matrix
and cytosol, consequently regulating energy metabolism, neurotransmission, and neuronal cells survival [24]. Estradiol protects
neuronal cells against glutamate exposure and prevents the glutamate toxicity-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ . Moreover,

glutamate toxicity decreased hippocalcin expression, whereas
estradiol treatment attenuated this decrease. Immunocytochemical staining also demonstrated that glutamate toxicity decreased
the number of hippocalcin-positive cells, and that this decrease
was attenuated in the presence of estradiol. As a neuronal calcium
sensor protein, hippocalcin plays a critical role in the modulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. A deﬁciency of hippocalcin
destroys Ca2+ homeostasis and consequently leads to cells death.
This study demonstrated that estradiol regulated intracellular Ca2+
concentration and hippocalcin expression in response to glutamate
exposure. Both in vivo and in vitro studies showed that estradiol
prevented a decrease in hippocalcin expression under ischemic
conditions. Hippocalcin has been shown to interact with the neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein (NAIP), which is a key regulator of
apoptosis [16]. The hippocalcin-NAIP interaction protects neurons
against calcium-induced cell death through caspase-3-dependent
and independent pathways [21]. Although further studies are
needed to explain the relationship between estradiol and hippocalcin in a stroke model, our results convincingly demonstrated that
estradiol regulates hippocalcin expression and intracellular Ca2+
levels, thereby preventing neuronal cells death due to ischemic
damage. Taken together, these results can suggest that estradiol
prevents neuronal cells death in ischemic brain injury via modulation of hippocalcin expression and regulation of intracellular Ca2+
concentrations.
