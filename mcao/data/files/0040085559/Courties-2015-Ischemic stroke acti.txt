Rationale: The mechanisms leading to an expanded neutrophil and monocyte supply after stroke are incompletely
understood.

Objective: To test the hypothesis that transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in mice leads to activation
of hematopoietic bone marrow stem cells.

bone marrow cell cycling peaked 4 days after stroke (P<0.05 versus pre tMCAO). Flow cytometry and cell cycle
analysis showed activation of the entire hematopoietic tree, including myeloid progenitors. The cycling fraction of
the most upstream hematopoietic stem cells increased from 3.34%±0.19% to 7.32%±0.52% after tMCAO (P<0.05).
In vivo microscopy corroborated proliferation of adoptively transferred hematopoietic progenitors in the bone
marrow of mice with stroke. The hematopoietic system’s myeloid bias was reflected by increased expression of
myeloid transcription factors, including PU.1 (P<0.05), and by a decline in lymphocyte precursors. In mice after
tMCAO, tyrosine hydroxylase levels in sympathetic fibers and bone marrow noradrenaline levels rose (P<0.05,
respectively), associated with a decrease of hematopoietic niche factors that promote stem cell quiescence. In
mice with genetic deficiency of the β3 adrenergic receptor, hematopoietic stem cells did not enter the cell cycle in
increased numbers after tMCAO (naive control, 3.23±0.22; tMCAO, 3.74±0.33, P=0.51).
Conclusions: Ischemic stroke activates hematopoietic stem cells via increased sympathetic tone, leading to a myeloid
bias of hematopoiesis and higher bone marrow output of inflammatory Ly6Chigh monocytes and neutrophils.

he majority of strokes result from thrombotic events leading to ischemic injury of the brain. This sterile injury to
the brain triggers a profound reaction of the immune system.
Microglia, which are the most numerous resident immune
cells of the central nervous system, proliferate and undergo
inflammatory activation. Importantly, brain ischemia also
triggers a systemic immune response. Although blood lymphocyte numbers decline, levels of circulating neutrophils and
monocytes increase in stroke patients.1,2 These myeloid cells
are recruited to the brain3 where they may contribute to the
brain’s recovery but also to reperfusion injury. Thus, the systemic number of innate immune cells, which recent studies relate to outcomes in patients,2,4,5 increases acutely after stroke.
These increased levels of circulating cells may reflect demargination from tissue vascular beds or increased production.

Here we tested whether increased cell production contributed
to this observed phenomenon. Innate immune cells have a life
span on the order of hours to a few days. The number of leukocytes in blood is limited, and cell reserves in the marginal
blood pool, the bone marrow, and the spleen exhaust rapidly
after ischemic injury. We therefore examined the source of
increased innate immune cell numbers in the circulation and
in the ischemic brain and the signals that regulate leukocyte
supply after stroke. We hypothesized that bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), a source of neutrophils and
monocytes in the steady state, increase activity after transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in mice.

We report that tMCAO activates the hematopoietic system
at its most upstream point. Shortly after brain injury, HSC
enter the cell cycle, giving rise to downstream myeloid progenitors and innate immune cells. Bone marrow hematopoiesis acquires a strong myeloid bias, with reduced frequency
of lymphoid progenitor cells. Increased autonomic nervous
system activity after stroke activates HSC through modulation
of the hematopoietic bone marrow niche environment, contributing to the leukocytosis observed in patients.

Methods

A detailed method section is available in the Online Data Supplement.

Animals and Stroke Procedure

Adult C57BL/6 and FVB/N mice (10–12 weeks old) were obtained
from Jackson Laboratories, and repTOPTM mitoIRE mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Adrb3−/− mice (gift from P.
Frenette) and Nestin-GFP (green fluorescent protein) reporter mice (gift
from G. Enikolopov) were bred in our facilities. Experimental stroke
was induced by a tMCAO. The Subcommittee on Research Animal
Care at Massachusetts General Hospital approved all procedures.

In Vivo Staining of Bone Marrow Vasculature and
Bone Lining Cells

To visualize bone structures, mice were administered intravenously
with OsteoSense® 750EX (4 nmol/mouse, PerkinElmer). For in vivo
endothelial cell labeling, mice were given IV APC antimouse CD31
(MEC13.3), Alexa Fluor® 647 antimouse VE-Cadherin (BV13), and
APC antimouse Sca-1 (D7, 2 μg/mouse in 100 μL PBS).

Whole Mount Immunofluorescence Staining of the
Sternum

Sterna were harvested and processed as described previously,6 sectioned longitudinally, and stained with rabbit antimouse tyrosine
hydroxylase antibody (Millipore). Samples were incubated with secondary antibody and imaged using an Olympus IV100 microscope.

Confocal Microscopy

For serial intravital microscopy of the calvarium, signaling
lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) HSCs were FACS
(fluorescence-activated cell sorting)-sorted, labeled with DiD
(1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate, Molecular Probes) and injected intravenously into nonirradiated Nestin-GFP recipient mice. The GFP signal, although not
specific for mesenchymal stem cells, guided revisiting similar regions of interest in serial intravital imaging. To highlight bone architecture, OsteoSense 750EX was administered (PerkinElmer). We
used rhodamine-labeled Griffonia simplicifolia lectin (RL-1102,
Vector Laboratories) to outline the vasculature. In vivo imaging was
performed on days 1 and 5 after the adoptive cell transfer with a
confocal microscope (IV100 Olympus). Z-stacks images for each
location were acquired at 2 μm steps. For visualization of Lin− cKit+ Sca-1+ (LKS) cells in sternum, Lin− c-Kit+ Sca-1+ cells were
FACS-sorted and labeled ex-vivo with 2 different fluorescent dyes,
including CellTrackerTM CM-Dil and SP-DiOC18(3) (Molecular
Probes) before adoptive transfer into recipient mice.

Results
Bone Marrow Activity Increases After Stroke
We used a tMCAO in mice to address the link between the
bone marrow and blood monocytosis and neutrophilia seen after ischemic brain injury in patients7,8 and rodents.9–12 Because
mature myeloid cells, which are recruited to the inflamed brain
and contribute to stroke, originate in the bone marrow, we
evaluated bone marrow myeloid cell subsets by flow cytometry following stroke induction. Although infarct sizes were
comparable on day 1 and day 3 after tMCAO (Figure 1A),
the percentages and numbers of mature CD11b+ cells (Online
Figure I; Figure 1B), including neutrophils (Figure 1C) and
inflammatory Ly6Chigh monocytes (Figure 1D), significantly
increased in the bone marrow when compared with naive control mice. In contrast, bone marrow Ly6Clow monocyte levels
did not change. Bone marrow myeloid cell content increased
somewhat, but remained significantly lower after a sham procedure that exposed mice to similar surgical trauma as tMCAO but did not induce brain ischemia (Online Figure IIA).
To investigate whether the bone marrow undergoes broad
activation after experimental stroke, we took advantage of
MITO-Luc (mitosis-luciferase) mice.13 These transgenic mice
harbor a transgene in which luciferase gene expression is
driven by the activity of a Nuclear Factor-Y–dependent cyclin
B2 promoter. This enabled us to noninvasively monitor cell
proliferation in the bone marrow of living mice before and after ischemic brain injury over a 2-week period. As shown in
Figure 1E, bone marrow luciferase activity increased rapidly
after stroke, peaked on day 4, and returned to baseline levels
by day 14. Sham surgery did not lead to a significant increase
of bone marrow bioluminescence on day 4 (Online Figure IIB).

Stroke Accelerates Myelopoiesis
After stroke, myeloid cells, especially neutrophils and monocytes, increase their presence in circulation. These cells are
also recruited to the ischemic brain. Encouraged by the observed increase of proliferation imaging signal, we therefore
next focused on hematopoiesis’ contribution to increased systemic leukocyte numbers. Whole bone marrow cultures from
animals with stroke gave rise to higher numbers of colonies
after 7 days (Figure 1F), reflecting increased hematopoietic
progenitor cell activity. To further explore the marrow’s response following tMCAO, we performed flow cytometry to
examine whether the increased mature myeloid cell numbers arise from upstream myeloid progenitor’s activity. We
observed a significant increase in both, relative frequencies
and absolute numbers of Lin− c-Kit+ Sca-1− CD16/32+ CD34+
granulocyte macrophage progenitors and Lin− c-Kit+ Sca1− CD16/32+ CD34+ CD115+ macrophage and dendritic cell
progenitors after tMCAO (Figure 1G). After sham surgery,
a mild increase of granulocyte macrophage progenitors and
macrophage and dendritic cell progenitors did not reach statistical significance when compared with naive controls. Their
numbers remained significantly lower than what was observed
after tMCAO (Online Figure IIC and IID).
To determine whether myeloid progenitors increased proliferative activity in the context of stroke, mice were given
IP injections of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) on day

3 after tMCAO. Twenty-four hours after a single dose of
BrdU, the fraction of BrdU+ granulocyte macrophage progenitors and macrophage and dendritic cell progenitors expanded significantly in animals with stroke when compared
with naive control mice (Figure 1H). To decipher whether
downstream mature neutrophils and monocytes derive from
the accelerated proliferation of myeloid progenitors, we next

examined BrdU incorporation into these differentiated cells.
Indeed, higher numbers of both neutrophils and monocytes
(Figure 1I) had incorporated BrdU (Figure 1J) after stroke,
indicating that they had recently emerged from cycling progenitors. Because each granulocyte macrophage progenitors
or macrophage and dendritic cell progenitors can give rise to
multiple neutrophils and monocytes, the increase in BrdU+

cells was more pronounced in differentiated leukocytes than
in progenitors.

Stroke Induces a Myeloid Bias of Hematopoiesis
Leukocytosis after stroke is often associated with lymphopenia. We therefore also examined behavior of lymphoid committed progenitors in the bone marrow after stroke. In contrast
to the expansion of myeloid progenitor cells, flow cytometric
analyses of lymphoid progenitors revealed a drastic reduction
in both the relative frequency and absolute number of Lin−
IL7Rα + c-Kitint Sca-1int common lymphoid progenitors, starting as early as day 1 after stroke induction (Figure 2A). Early
immature B cells defined as Lin− B220int CD93+ were significantly diminished in the bone marrow on day 3 after tMCAO
(Figure 2B). Altogether, the divergent activity changes of myeloid and lymphoid progenitors suggest that stroke may skew
hematopoiesis toward the myeloid lineage.
To further explore this hypothesis, we FACS-sorted LKS
from mice 3 days after tMCAO. These cells occupy a position in the hematopoietic tree that is just upstream of the
divergence of lymphopoiesis and myelopoiesis. Consistent
with the activation and expansion of myeloid progenitors at

the expense of lymphoid progenitors, LKS from mice with
stroke expressed higher levels of NF-κB as well as transcription factors involved in myeloid differentiation, such as PU.1
and CEBPβ.14,15 Furthermore, expression of several myeloidspecific genes, including S100A9 and S100A8 alarmins, myeloperoxidase, and chitinase 3-like-3, were also increased in
LKS isolated from animals with stroke (Figure 3). In contrast,
expression levels of mtg16, Mcsfr, c-myb, and irf8 were not
altered (Online Figure III). In agreement with the severe reduction of lymphoid progenitors and despite unchanged Ikaros
expression levels, IL7Rα, which is expressed by lymphoid
LKS, was significantly reduced after tMCAO, highlighting a
blockade of lymphoid commitment (Figure 3).

HSC Are the Upstream Point of Bone Marrow
Activation After Stroke
Because myeloid but not lymphoid progenitors increased
activity after stroke, we next asked whether upstream hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which give rise to these
cells, also respond to ischemic brain injury. Both relative percentages and absolute numbers of LKS in the femur bone marrow were significantly elevated after stroke (Figure 4A). The

frequency and absolute number of the most upstream SLAM
HSC subpopulation (Lin− c-Kit+ Sca-1+ CD48− CD150+) increased in mice with tMCAO (Figure 4A; see Online Figure
IV for expanded gating strategy). Notably, the extent of the
bone marrow HSC response correlated with infarct size
(Figure 4B). Sham surgery did not result in significantly increased stem cell numbers (Online Figure IIE and IIF). The
increase in numbers of HSC after stroke was corroborated by
higher percentages of both LKS and SLAM HSCs in the non
G0 phase of the cell cycle 24 hours after stroke, as assessed
by flow cytometry after ki-67 staining (Figure 4C). These data
indicate that HSC enter the cell cycle, expand in numbers, and
give rise to downstream progeny after ischemic stroke.
To directly visualize the proliferation of upstream stem and
progenitor cells in the bone marrow after stroke, we performed

ex vivo confocal microscopy on sternal bone marrow preparations after adoptive transfer of labeled LKS. One day before
tMCAO, nonirradiated recipients received an intravenous mixture of FACS-sorted LKS that were labeled with 2 differently
colored fluorescent membrane dyes (40 000 LKS per mouse;
1:1 cell ratio). Three days after stroke and 4 days after adoptive
cell transfer, red CM-Dil+ and green SP-DiOC18(3)+ LKS were
imaged in the sternal bone marrow, using naive control recipients without stroke as controls. The number of cell clusters,
that is, >2 cells in direct proximity, was increased in the marrow of mice with stroke (Figure 5). Notably, we never observed
clusters containing a mix of red and green cells, indicating that
proximate LKS likely proliferated after seeding the marrow.
We next performed serial intravital microscopy of the skull
bone marrow after intravenous adoptive transfer of 20 000

were imaged 1 day before and again 3 days after stroke,

enabling us to serially monitor individual HSCs. Similar to
transplanted LKS, SLAM HSCs also increased in number 3
days after tMCAO (Figure 6). Collectively, these data indicate that ischemic injury of the brain triggers proliferation of
the most upstream hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells,

suggesting that the entire hematopoietic tree, but especially
the myeloid lineage, increases proliferation and causes the
blood leukocytosis observed in patients after stroke.

Stroke Increases the Sympathetic Tone in
Bone Marrow
HSC activity is regulated by the microenvironment of the
bone marrow stem cell niche. Interestingly, autonomic tone,
which is increased after stroke,16–19 may influence the signaling of hematopoietic niche cells.20,21 Local sympathetic nerve
fibers may release norepinephrine within the bone marrow to
increase cell cycling, as observed in circadian rhythms or after
MI20,21 and in mice exposed to chronic psychosocial stress.22
We therefore studied whether sympathetic tone alerts bone
marrow cells after stroke.
Norepinephrine content in the bone marrow of mice with
tMCAO increased significantly (Figure 7A). In line with this
finding, immunofluorescence staining for tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate limiting enzyme in norepinephrine synthesis,
was more pronounced in whole mount sternal preparations
1 day after cerebral ischemic injury. The increased staining
pattern followed the typical distribution of sympathetic nerve
fibers along bone marrow arterioles (Figure 7B and 7C).
Norepinephrine indirectly regulates hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells migration and proliferation by modulating
stromal cell expression of several factors, including Cxcl12,20
which retains HSC in position and promotes a quiescent HSC
state. In whole bone marrow, Cxcl12, VCAM-1, stem cell
factor, angiopoietin-1, and IL-7 mRNA fell significantly 24
hours after tMCAO (Figure 7D), indicating that after stroke,
the molecular interaction between stromal niche cells and hematopoietic cells is markedly altered.

Bone Marrow β3-Adrenergic Receptor Signaling
Activates HSC but not LKS After Stroke
Bone marrow norepinephrine acts through β3-adrenergic receptors expressed by mesenchymal stromal cells, triggering
downregulation of above maintenance factors.20 We attempted
to measure expression of the β3-adrenergic receptor in HSC

and LKS isolated by flow sorting; however, in contrast to robust expression of this receptor by niche cells,22 β3-adrenergic
receptor mRNA was not detectable in hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells. To determine the role of β3-adrenergic signaling in bone marrow niche cells after stroke, we conducted
flow cytometric cell cycle analyses in Adrb3−/− mice after
tMCAO. Because HSC activation correlates with stroke size
(Figure 4B), only mice with large stroke volumes (defined as
>35 mm3) were used for this analysis (wild-type, 71.2±21.2;
Adrb3−/−, 68.5±10.3 mm3). In wild-type mice, LKS and HSC
increased frequencies in both G1 and S/G2/M cell cycle
phases 1 day after tMCAO (Figure 8A and 8B). In contrast to
wild-type mice, in which the number of cycling HSC rose to
7.32%±0.52% after tMCAO, HSC in mice with genetic deficiency for the β3 adrenergic receptor did not increase cycling
(3.74%±0.33%, P<0.01 versus wild-type tMCAO), suggesting that the sympathetic nervous system regulates HSC activation through this receptor. Downstream LKS increased cell
cycle entry after stroke in Adrb3−/− mice (Figure 8C and 8D).
Twenty-four hours after tMCAO, infarct size was comparable
in Adrb3−/− and FVB/N wild-type control mice (48.0±8.8 versus 42.9±14.6; P=0.23, n=8–14). The loss of body weight after stroke was comparable in both cohorts (Adrb3−/− 2.6±0.2 g,
FVB/N 2.6±1.1 g; P=0.49).
Altogether, these data are consistent with the notion that
after ischemic stroke, sympathetic nervous signaling acts on
hematopoietic niche cells, which then alter the bone marrow
microenvironment to push increased numbers of HSC into the
cell cycle.

Discussion
In contrast to a maturing knowledge on local inflammation
in the brain and changes in circulating immune cells,9,11,12,23
remarkably little is known about how the bone marrow, the
primary site of hematopoiesis, reacts to ischemic stroke.24,25
In the present study, we report that tMCAO in mice activates HSC and downstream hematopoietic progenitors, leading to an increased output of inflammatory monocytes and

neutrophils, whereas the number of lymphocyte progenitors
declined. We identify enhanced bone marrow adrenergic
signaling through the β3 adrenoreceptor on niche cells as a
mechanism of HSC activation. As a result, niche cells altered
expression of cytokines and retention factors that regulate
hematopoiesis.
Cells residing in the hematopoietic niche regulate leukocyte
production through several soluble signals and adhesion molecules. These cells include mesenchymal stem cells, perivascular cells, endothelial cells, macrophages, and osteoblasts.26,27
Integration of cell–cell communication informs HSC whether
they should remain quiescent, proliferate, differentiate, or migrate. Quiescent HSC and cycling downstream progenitors
may reside in different bone marrow locations.28 Some reports
indicate that the most upstream, quiescent HSC reside close
to the endosteum next to arterioles ensheathed with nestin-expressing mesenchymal stem cells, whereas more downstream
precursors may locate in proximity to sinusoids.29 Several key
niche components, including Cxcl12 (also known as SDF-1),
are provided by multiple cell types altering the localization
and quiescence of HSC.30 During circadian oscillation of bone
marrow activity,20 after myocardial infarction,21 and in mice
exposed to chronic psychosocial stress,22 the sympathetic nervous tone changes, reflected by increased bone marrow levels
of norepinephrine. This neurotransmitter binds β3 receptors
on niche cells, which leads to downregulation of maintenance
factors in the niche.20 Reduction of the quiescence signal
Cxcl12 increases HSC activity,26,27 in parallel to what we observed in mice with stroke. Thus, it seems that several stimuli,

including circadian rhythms, ischemic injury, and chronic
psychosocial stress, converge on a similar neuro-immunologic
pathway.
Cxcl12 and IL7, whose expression fell after stroke, are also
essential for the development of lymphoid progenitors, such
as early B cell precursors and common lymphoid progenitors.31,32 As stem cells, lymphoid, and myeloid precursors in
the bone marrow may not share the same microenvironmental
niches for their respective maintenance and development, it is
likely that stroke has broad but differential effects on multiple
hematopoietic niches.
Genetic deficiency of β3 adrenoreceptor abolished the increase in HSC cycling after tMCAO; however, downstream
LKS were still activated in Adrb3−/− mice. This interesting divergence suggests that specific regulation of progenitor cell
classes may occur, possibly via differences in their location.
Increased sympathetic signaling may primarily affect mesenchymal cells that are located next to arterioles in quiescent
niches29 and therefore reach HSC residing there. After activated HSC translocate to positions closer to sinusoids, they
may be exposed to different, potentially soluble signals, for
example, circulating danger–associated molecular patterns.33
For instance, hematopoiesis increases in response to toll-like
receptor ligands34 or interferons35,36 in the setting of infection.
In the context of stroke, break down of the blood–brain barrier allows systemic distribution of circulating messengers,
including inflammatory cytokines and alarmins liberated
from ischemic and necrotic brain cells, which could likewise
alert the hematopoietic system.37–40 How local or circulating

stimuli, including danger signals, chemokines, survival factors, and proinflammatory cytokines may differentially affect
distinct progenitor cell subsets (ie, myeloid versus lymphoid)
or their respective niches in the bone marrow after stroke will
be the focus of future studies. Experiments with cell-specific
deletion of the β3-adrenergic receptor should further refine
the cellular identity of involved niche cells.
Although activation and proliferation of microglia dominate
the early cellular response to stroke, break down of the blood–
brain barrier also enables robust recruitment of circulating
immune cells, including neutrophils and monocytes.3,23,41,42
These cells are centrally involved in wound healing, including
the healing of ischemic wounds. After myocardial infarction,
monocytes are essential for tissue repair, but their oversupply is detrimental for healing and leads to heart failure.43
Macrophage depletion studies suggest comparable mechanisms for brain ischemia because lack of these cells leads to
hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic stroke.44 On the other end
of the spectrum, the level of inflammatory monocyte subtypes
in blood correlates with worse outcome in stroke patients.2
Thus, there may be a hypothetical sweet spot of immune cell
activity after stroke, in which salutary functions of resident
microglia and recruited myeloid cells support resolution of inflammation and regeneration of the injured brain.
Thirty percent of acute stroke patients acquire infections,
especially pneumonia.45 Although infections frequently occur
after any injury, and stroke-related sequela such as paralysis
may also contribute, the high incidence of poststroke infections is accompanied by lymphocyte apoptosis. Some authors
postulated the existence of a peripheral immunosuppression,
reporting an impressive atrophy of the thymus and the spleen
after stroke that lasted for several days thereafter, a phenotype
attributed to lymphocyte apoptosis.9,16 Our data indicate that
hematopoiesis increased and that the bone marrow accelerated production of innate immune cells, pointing to an important exception from the peripheral immunosuppression after
stroke. The lymphoid lineage suppression we observed in the
bone marrow of mice with stroke may contribute to the previously reported blood lymphopenia.9,16
The leukocytes that are supplied to the ischemic brain and
circulate in increasing numbers after stroke are also a driving force behind complications of atherosclerosis. Monocytes
give rise to plaque macrophages and foam cells, which become
apoptotic and form necrotic cores. Macrophage-derived proteases digest the protective fibrous cap.43 Such a destabilized
plaque (eg, within the carotid artery) may rupture and lead to
ischemia of the brain. We recently described that experimental
myocardial infarction accelerates hematopoiesis and atherosclerosis,21 possibly explaining the high secondary event rates
observed in patients with a first infarct. Likewise, stroke may
increase the supply of neutrophils and monocytes to remote
atherosclerotic plaque, thus promoting stroke reoccurrence.
In ischemic heart disease, blood leukocytosis is associated
with worse outcome. There are limited data for stroke patients,
possibly reflecting that leukocytes and their subsets have dual
roles, including support of recovery and healing. In addition,
stroke pathophysiology is heterogeneous and patients often
suffer from infections, which can influence leukocyte levels.

In 1999, the Stockholm study46 reported that when controlled
for initial stroke severity, multivariate regression analysis did
not show association of leukocytosis to outcome. This study
included patients with hemorrhagic stroke, and CT identified infarction in 60% of the population. A more recent study,
which only included patients with ischemic stroke, found an
association of leukocytosis with early poor outcome.5 Another
report correlated increased CD14high CD16− monocyte levels
with worse 90-day outcome and higher mortality in patients
after adjustment for age and symptoms on admission.2 Many
preclinical studies imply that anti-inflammatory intervention
may improve stroke recovery.23 However, translation of these
studies into clinical therapy has proven difficult, arguing that
better understanding of systemic leukocyte subset fate in the
setting of stroke is warranted.33
Our study reports that increased signaling of the sympathetic nervous system activates HSC activity in the bone marrow, increasing the output of neutrophils and inflammatory
Ly-6Chigh monocytes after stroke. At the present time, it is
unclear whether the bone marrow’s response to stroke represents a therapeutic target to improve stroke recovery and to
prevent secondary stroke. Preclinical47–49 and some early clinical50,51 data suggest that beta blocker use may be beneficial
after stroke. Observed effects may or may not be related to
bone marrow activity because the affinity of most clinical
beta blockers for the β3 adrenoreceptor is low. Beta blockers
lower blood pressure, which likely also influences outcome
and reoccurrence of stroke. In addition, bone marrow–derived
immune cells may support stroke recovery. Hence, although
targeting overproduction of inflammatory immune cells is
worthwhile in cardiovascular disease,52 there is a compelling
need to gather additional data on precisely when and how to
therapeutically intervene after stroke.

Novelty and Significance
What Is Known?
•	 Microglia and recruited blood leukocytes contribute to the innate
­immune response after stroke.
•	 Ischemic stroke leads to monocytosis and neutrophilia, inflammatory
­immune cells that migrate to atherosclerotic lesions, as well as ischemic
tissue.

What New Information Does This Article Contribute?
Downloaded from http://circres.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

•	 The bone marrow provides increased numbers of monocytes and
neutrophils after stroke through increased myelopoiesis, whereas lymphoid progenitors are less active.
•	 Indirect sympathetic signaling to bone marrow niche cells leads to
­activation of most upstream hematopoietic stem cells.
•	 Stroke increases bone marrow noradrenaline levels that alter the
­hematopoietic niche by signaling through β3 adrenergic receptors.

Neutrophils and monocytes are recruited from the blood
stream into the acutely ischemic brain where they, together

with locally activated microglia, mount the response to ischemic stroke. Although it is known that systemic numbers of
these inflammatory myeloid cells expand after stroke, their
source was incompletely understood. Here we show, using
flow cytometry and confocal microscopy of the bone marrow,
that ischemic stroke activates the entire hematopoietic tree.
Bioluminescence imaging revealed that proliferative bone marrow activity peaks on day 4 after ischemia. A myeloid bias of
hematopoiesis accelerates production of innate immune cells,
although bone marrow lymphopoiesis is suppressed. After
stroke, bone marrow levels of noradrenaline increase, associated with reduced Cxcl12 levels. In mice with genetic lack of
β3 adrenergic receptors, the activation of hematopoietic stem
cells is inhibited. These data show that increased bone marrow production of leukocytes contributes to the acute immune
system activation after stroke.

Courties: Stroke and the bone marrow
Detailed methods
Animals and stroke procedure
Adult C57BL/6 and FVB/N mice (10-12 weeks old) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and
repTOPTM mitoIRE mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Adrb3-/- mice (gift from P.
Frenette) and Nestin-GFP reporter mice (gift from G. Enikolopov) were bred in our facilities.
Experimental stroke was induced by a transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (tMCAO). Mice
were anesthetized with 1.5-2% isoflurane. Temperature was kept between 36-36.5℃ using a temperature
control system (Harvard Apparatus). After midline neck skin incision, the right carotid artery bifurcation
was dissected, and the external carotid artery (ECA) was permanently ligated. A clip was then placed on
the internal carotid artery, and a temporary ligation was tied onto the common carotid artery. An
arteriotomy was then performed on the ECA. A commercial silicon coated filament (7019, Doccol corp,
MA, USA) was then introduced and pushed from the ECA to the ICA after removal of the clamp, until
blocked in the carotid termination. The filament was left in place for forty-five minutes and gently pulled
out afterwards. A permanent knot on the ECA secured the arteriotomy from bleeding, and the temporary
knot on the CCA was then removed to allow complete reperfusion. Painkillers were given at the
completion of the surgical procedure (buprenorphine 0.1mg/kg subcutaneously) and mice recovered in a
clean cage. In additional control experiments, sham surgery was performed using similar conditions as in
tMCAO but without induction of brain ischemia. Specifically, the right carotid bifurcation was dissected
and the external carotid artery permanently ligated. Afterwards, the incision was sutured and the mice
allowed to wake up in a clean cage. No arteriotomy was performed. The Subcommittee on Research
Animal Care at Massachusetts General Hospital approved procedures.
Flow cytometry
After bone marrow harvest, single cell suspensions were obtained and total number of cells per femur
were determined using a hemocytometer and Trypan Blue staining method for cell viability (Cellgro,
Mediatech, Inc, VA). All antibodies used in this study were purchased from eBioscience, BioLegend or
BD Biosciences. For mature myeloid cells analysis, monoclonal antibodies including anti-CD11b
(M1/70), Ly6G (1A8), CD115 (AFS98), Ly6C (AL-21) were used. Neutrophils were identified as CD11b+
Ly6G+, Ly6Clow monocytes were identified as CD11b+ CD115+ Ly6Clow and Ly6Chigh monocytes were
defined as CD11b+ CD115+ Ly6Chigh. For hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells analyses, cells were
stained with biotin conjugated antibodies against lineage markers including B220 (RA3-6B2), CD4
(GK1.5), CD8α (53-6.7), NK1.1 (PK136), CD11b (M1/70), CD11c (N418), Gr-1 (RB6-8C5), Ter119
(TER-119) followed by streptavidin Pacific OrangeTM or APC/Cy7 conjugates, and antibodies against cKit (2B8), Sca-1 (D7), IL7Rα (SB/199), CD93 (AA4.1), CD16/32 (2.4G2), CD34 (RAM34), CD135
(A2F10), CD48 (HM48-1) and CD150 (TC15-12F12.2). Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) were identified
as Lin- c-Kit+ Sca-1+ CD48- CD150+, LKS were identified as Lin- c-Kit+ Sca-1+. Granulocyte-macrophage
progenitors (GMP) were identified as Lin- c-Kit+ Sca-1- CD16/32+ CD34+ and macrophage and dendritic
cell progenitors (MDP) were defined as Lin- c-Kit+ Sca-1- CD16/32+ CD34+ CD115+. Common lymphoid
progenitors (CLP) were identified as Lin- IL7Rα + c-Kitint Sca-1int and early immature B cells were
defined as Lin- B220int CD93+. Cell numbers per femur were calculated as total cells per femur sample
multiplied by percentage of cells obtained from the appropriate FACS gates. For BrdU incorporation
assays, 1 mg of BrdU was injected i.p. 24 hours before harvesting. BrdU staining was performed using
the FITC BrdU flow kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For cell cycle
analysis, cells were stained for LKS and HSC cell surface markers as described above, fixed and
permeabilized using the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were then stained with anti-Ki67 antibody (SolA15, eBioscience) or
isotype control. After washing, 1µl of DAPI (FxCycleTM Violet stain, Life Technologies) was
subsequently added to samples. Data acquisition was performed using LSRII Flow Cytometer (BD). Data
were analyzed using with FlowJo software (Tree Star).

In vivo staining of bone marrow vasculature and bone lining cells
To visualize bone structures, mice were administered intravenously with OsteoSense® 750EX, a
fluorescent in vivo bisphosphonate imaging agent (4 nmol/mouse, PerkinElmer), 24 h before ex-vivo
staining of sternal preparations. For in vivo endothelial cells labeling, mice were given i.v APC antimouse CD31 (MEC13.3), Alexa Fluor® 647 anti-mouse VE-Cadherin (BV13) and APC anti-mouse Sca-1
(D7, 2 µg/mouse in 100µl PBS), 30 min prior to organ harvest.

Whole mount immunofluorescence staining of the sternum
Sterna were harvested and processed as described in1. Briefly, sternal bones were transected with a
surgical blade to obtain compartments of sternal BM. Each specimen was further sectioned longitudinally
to expose the bone marrow. Sternal preparations were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS in a 96well plate at room temperature for 30 minutes. Whole mount tissues were blocked and permeabilized
overnight with 20% goat serum and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. After washing with 0.1% Triton X-100 in
PBS (4 x 15 minutes), BM tissues were stained with rabbit anti-mouse Tyrosine Hydroxylase antibody
(Millipore, 1:100) in 20% goat serum and 0.1%Triton X-100 in PBS, for 2 days at 4℃. After washing,
samples were incubated for 2 hours at RT with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Life
technologies, 1:200). After washing, whole-mount tissues were imaged using an Olympus IV100
microscope and z-stacks images acquired at 2-5µm steps were processed with ImageJ software (NIH).
Confocal microscopy
For serial intravital microscopy of the calvarium, SLAM HSCs (Lin- c-kit+ Sca-1+ CD48- CD150+) were
FACS-sorted using a FACSAria II cell sorter (BD) from C57BL/6 mice and labeled ex-vivo with the
Vybrant® DiD Cell-Labeling Solution (1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′- tetramethylindodicarbocyanine
perchlorate, Molecular Probes®) according to manufacturer’s protocol. 20,000 labeled HSCs were
injected i.v. into non-irradiated Nestin-GFP recipient mice. The GFP signal, while not specific for
mesenchymal stem cells, was used as landmark to aid revisiting similar regions of interest in serial
intravital imaging. To highlight bone architecture, OsteoSense® 750EX, a fluorescent bisphosphonate
imaging agent, was administered i.v. 24 hours prior to imaging (4 nmol/mouse, PerkinElmer). To outline
the vasculature, we used rhodamine-labelled Griffonia simplicifolia lectin (RL-1102, Vector
Laboratories). Lectin was injected i.v. (50µl at 2 mg/ml) immediately prior imaging. In vivo imaging was
performed on days 1 and 5 after the adoptive cell transfer using a confocal microscope (IV100 Olympus).
Z-stacks images for each location were acquired at 2µm steps and post-processing was performed using
Image J software (NIH). For visualization of LKS cells in sternal BM, Lin- c-Kit+ Sca-1+ cells were FACS
sorted and labeled ex-vivo with two different fluorescent dyes including CellTrackerTM CM-Dil and SPDiOC18(3) (Molecular Probes) prior to adoptive transfer into recipient mice.
TTC staining
Brains were removed and sliced on a brain matrix every millimeter. Fresh tissue sections were then
soaked in a solution of 2% TTC (2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 15
minutes protected from light. Stroke volume was measured using ImageJ software (imagej.nih.gov) by
planimetry. Indirect stroke volume was given subtracting the volume of the non-injured parenchyma of
the stroke hemisphere from the volume of the contralateral hemisphere.
In vivo bioluminescence imaging
Transgenic repTOPTM mitoIRE mice were anesthetized and injected i.p. with 150 mg/kg body weight
with D-Luciferin (RR Labs Inc, San Diego, CA). Five minutes later, mice were moved to the imaging
chamber of the IVISTM 100 imaging system in a supine position. A region of interest (ROI) was drawn to
encompass the entire mouse and light emission was recorded every 5 min until the signal intensity passed
its peak value. Signal intensities were measured in photons per second using Living Image® software
(Caliper Life Sciences).

Colony-Forming cell assay
CFC assays were performed using a semi-solid cell culture medium (MethoCult® GF M3434,
STEMCELL Technologies) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Bones were flushed with Iscove’s
Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (Lonza) supplemented with 2% FCS and 2×104 whole bone marrow cells
were cultured in 35 mm dishes in duplicates and incubated at 37℃, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator.
Colonies were counted after 7 days using a low magnification inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse
TE2000-S).
RNA isolation and gene expression
Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For
qRT-PCR, RNA was treated with DNase I and reverse-transcribed using the high capacity RNA to cDNA
kit (Applied Biosystems). Runs were performed on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems) using Taqman primers and reagents (Applied Biosystems). Threshold cycle values from
target genes were normalized to housekeeping genes expression including Actinb (Actb) or
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) using the 2-(Ct(target gene) - Ct(housekeeping gene)) method.
ELISA
Quantitative measurement of norepinephrine in the bone marrow was determined using a noradrenaline
sensitive ELISA Assay Kit according to manufacturer’s protocol (DLD Diagnostika, Eagle Biosciences).
Femurs were harvested and immediately snap-frozen and homogenized in a catecholamine stabilizing
solution (4mM sodium metabisulfite, 1mM EDTA and 0.01N hydrochloric acid, pH=7.5) prior to the
procedure.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Results
are reported as mean ± standard error of mean. For a two-group comparison, a Mann-Whitney test for
nonparametric data was used. For a comparison of more than two groups, an ANOVA test, followed by a
Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons, was applied.
