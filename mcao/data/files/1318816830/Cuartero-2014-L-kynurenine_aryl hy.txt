Background—Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a transcription factor that belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix PAS (PerArnt-Sim homology domain) family known to mediate the toxic and carcinogenic effects of xenobiotics. Interestingly,
AhR is widely expressed in the central nervous system, but its physiological and pathological roles are still unclear.
Methods and Results—To define the role of AhR in stroke, we used middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice and oxygenglucose deprivation in rat cortical neurons. The results presented here show that the ischemic insult increases total and
nuclear AhR levels and AhR transcriptional activity in neurons in vivo and in vitro. We also show that AhR has a causal
role in acute ischemic damage because pharmacological or genetic loss-of-function approaches result in neuroprotection.
Inhibition of cAMP response element-binding protein–dependent signaling may participate in the deleterious actions
of AhR. Finally, we have also found that L-kynurenine, a tryptophan metabolite with AhR agonistic properties, is an
endogenous ligand that mediates AhR activation in the brain after middle cerebral artery occlusion.
Conclusions—Our data demonstrate that an L-kynurenine/AhR pathway mediates acute brain damage after stroke and open
new possibilities for the diagnosis and treatment of this pathology.   (Circulation. 2014;130:2040-2051.)

syndrome, chloracne, immune suppression, inflammation,

Furthermore, AhR is postulated to play important roles in
normal cell physiology and function, as demonstrated by the
phenotype observed in the AhR knockout mice5 and by different studies that link AhR activation by endogenous or naturally occurring ligands to vascular and cardiac homeostasis,6
immune system function7 and tumor development.8 Although
AhR and its target genes are widely expressed in different brain
regions, including cerebellum, ventrolateral medulla, hippocampus, and cortex,9–11 little is known about its role in brain
physiology and pathology. Of note, AhR inhibition has been
shown to protect against N-methyl-d-aspartate excitotoxicity12
and to decrease apoptosis in cortical neurons,13 suggesting its
potential involvement in neurological insults such as stroke.
In this study, we investigated the role of AhR in acute
ischemic brain injury by using in vivo and in vitro models
of stroke induced either by middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) in mouse or by exposure of cultured rat cortical
neurons to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), respectively.
Our data show that AhR activation by its endogenous ligand
L-kynurenine (L-Kyn) has a deleterious role in cerebral

schemic stroke, which results from cerebral arterial occlusion, is becoming a major cause of morbidity and mortality
in today’s society and affects millions of people every year.
Currently, the only approved treatment for the acute phase of
stroke is the recombinant thrombolytic tissue-type plasminogen
activator.1 Identifying molecules that contribute to the ischemic
damage may help to elucidate potential therapeutic targets.

Clinical Perspective on p 2051
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) or dioxin receptor is
a ligand-activated transcription factor that belongs to the basic
helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim of highly conserved proteins.2
One of its main functions is to participate in the metabolism
of xenobiotics from environmental pollutants such as halogenated and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls.3 On AhR activation by xenobiotics, AhR
translocates into the nucleus and dimerizes with the AhR
nuclear translocator (ARNT); the heterodimer then binds to
dioxin-responsive elements located upstream of target genes
such as Cyp1a1, Cyp1b1, and AhRR, leading to a wide variety
of toxic responses, including severe thymic involution, wasting

Methods
Reagents
The AhR antagonists 6,2’,4’-trimethoxyflavone14 (TMF) and
CH22319115 (CH), the putative AhR agonist L-Kyn,8,16–18 and the
specific tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) inhibitor 680C91 were
from TOCRIS Bioscience. The AhR agonist benzo[a]pyrene and
1-methyl-d-tryptophan, a specific indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase
(IDO) inhibitor, were from Sigma. The AhR agonist 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was from Accustandard.

Experiments were performed in male C57Bl/6 mice at 10 to 12 weeks
of age obtained from The Jackson Laboratories and in wild-type (WT)
control (C57Bl/6) and AhR+/− heterozygous mice (C57Bl/6) described
elsewhere.19 WT and AhR−/− knockout mice (C57Bl/6) were obtained
from Taconic. Animals were kept in a room with controlled temperature and a 12-hour dark/light cycle and fed with standard food and
water ad libitum. All experimental protocols adhered to the regulations
of the Animal Welfare Committee of the Universidad Complutense
(following EU directives 86/609/CEE and 2003/65/CE).

In Vivo Experimental Groups
All experiments were performed and quantified in a randomized
fashion by investigators blinded to specific treatments. Mice were
subjected to a distal permanent or transient MCAO by ligation (onlineonly Data Supplement). To evaluate the contribution of AhR, several
groups were used for the determination of infarct outcome in mice 24
to 48 hours after ischemia. AhR+/− and AhR−/− mice and their WT littermates were subjected to MCAO. Furthermore, C57Bl/6 mice received
an intraperitoneal administration of either vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide), the AhR antagonist TMF (5 mg/kg), or the AhR antagonist CH
(10 mg/kg). Another group received either vehicle or the AhR agonist
benzo[a]pyrene (40 mg/kg). In another set of experiments, C57BL/6
mice were treated with either vehicle or TMF±10 mg/kg L-Kyn. To
study the AhR-dependent effects of TMF, benzo[a]pyrene, and L-Kyn,
AhR−/− mice were treated with these compounds. Finally, mice were
treated with vehicle, a TDO inhibitor (680C91; 10 mg/kg), or an IDO
inhibitor (1-methyl-d-tryptophan; 10 mg/kg). In several experiments,
coadministration of the TDO inhibitor (10 mg/kg) plus L-Kyn (10 mg/
kg) was also performed. All treatments were administered 10 minutes
after MCAO except for the TDO and IDO inhibitors, which were
administered 10 minutes and 8 hours after ischemia, after preliminary
experiments in which we failed to find a significant effect when these
inhibitors were administered only 10 minutes after ischemia.

Infarct Volume Measurement and Assessment of
Functional Deficits
Twenty-four and 48 hours after MCAO, infarct outcome was assessed
by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining or magnetic
resonance imaging. Functional deficits were graded by use of the grip
test and the modified Neurological Severity Score (online-only Data
Supplement).

In Vitro Experimental Groups
OGD in rat cortical neurons was performed as described in the onlineonly Data Supplement. In some experiments, TMF (3–10 μmol/L) in
the absence or presence of L-Kyn (50 μmol/L) was included 24 hours
before, during, and after OGD. In another set of experiments, TMF
(10 μmol/L) with or without L-Kyn (50 μmol/L) was included only
during and after OGD. In another group, neurons were treated with
the TDO inhibitor 680C91 (10 μmol/L) after OGD. In several experiments, TCDD (20 nmol/L) was used as a positive control of AhR
activation. Medium and cells were collected 24 hours after OGD for

viability assessment. Cells were collected at 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 8, and 24
hours after OGD for mRNA and protein assays, nuclear/cytoplasmic
extracts, and immunocytochemistry.

Measurement of Cell Viability After OGD
Lactate dehydrogenase release from damaged cells and morphological analysis were used to determine neuronal cell death after OGD
(online-only Data Supplement).

Statistical Analysis
Results are expressed as mean±SEM for the indicated number of
experiments. Data were tested for homoscedasticity with the Bartlett
test. Statistical significance was determined by use of a nonparametric, 2-tailed Mann-Whitney t test; a nonparametric, 1-way KruskalWallis ANOVA test followed by a Dunn post hoc testing; or a
nonparametric, 2-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc testing. Correlation analysis was performed by use of a nonparametric
Spearman correlation, and a linear regression of the data is displayed.
Values of P<0.05 were considered statistically significant. In each figure, the mean value of every group labeled with a specific symbol is
significantly different (P<0.05) from the mean value of the reference
group, which is indicated in each case. All statistical analyses were
performed with Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc).

Results
AhR Expression Is Increased in the Postischemic
Brain
Western blot analysis showed low levels of AhR expression in sham-operated mice (n=4; P<0.05; Figure 1A). After
ischemia, AhR levels increased in the peri-infarct and core
regions. In the peri-infarct, AhR upregulation was observed
at 18 hours, peaked at 24 to 48 hours, and started to decrease
at 72 hours. In the core, AhR expression reached a plateau
at 5 hours and returned to baseline at 7 days. AhR immunostaining showed similar results (n=3–4; Figure 1B). AhR
nuclear translocator, the heterodimer partner of AhR, was also
increased in both peri-infarct and core regions (Figure IA and
IB in the online-only Data Supplement).
To determine the cell type responsible for the increased
AhR expression after ischemia, we used immunofluorescence staining and confocal analysis 24 hours after MCAO
(n=3–4; Figure 1C). Sham animals showed some diffuse AhR
immunoreactivity in neurons at the ipsilateral and contralateral sides. Exposure to ischemia increased AhR expression
mainly in neurons (AhR and NeuN colocalization) in the periinfarct area but also in the core at different time points after
MCAO (II/III layers of neocortex; Figure 1C and Figure II
in the online-only Data Supplement). AhR immunoreactivity
was rarely observed in astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein positive; Figure 1C) and was not detectable in microglial
cells (Iba-1 positive; Figure 1C).

Exposure to MCAO Induces AhR Nuclear
Translocation and Transcriptional Activity in
Mouse Brain
Because the activity of AhR as a transcription factor is regulated by shuttling from the cytoplasm to the nucleus,20 MCAOinduced changes in AhR subcellular location were assessed by
protein analysis in nuclear/cytoplasmic fractions and immunofluorescence. Western blot analysis demonstrated an initial
2-fold increase in AhR nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio followed by

respectively, in brains of MCAO-exposed animals compared
with the sham group, returning to basal levels after 7 days (n=5;

cytoplasmic and nuclear pattern in sham mice (Figure 1E); in
contrast, 18 hours after MCAO, nuclear translocation of AhR
in neurons in peri-infarct and core regions became evident
(n=4; P<0.05; Figure 1E). At this time, AhR nuclear translocator was also expressed in neurons (Figure IB in the onlineonly Data Supplement), allowing AhR transcriptional activity.
Indeed, analysis by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain
reaction confirmed the induction of the AhR target genes
Cyp1a1 and AhRR 18 hours after MCAO compared with the
sham group (n=5; P<0.05; Figure 1F). These data indicate that

in vivo cerebral ischemia induces AhR nuclear translocation
and transcriptional activity.

AhR Participates in Acute Ischemic Damage After
MCAO in Mice
We next examined whether AhR participates in ischemic brain
injury. First, we used a pharmacological approach to inhibit or
to activate AhR. Mice were exposed to MCAO and, 10 minutes
later, were treated with vehicle or the AhR antagonists TMF
or CH (Figure 2A–2E). Administration of TMF (5 mg/kg)
dramatically decreased the infarct size after permanent
(MCAO; n=10–11; P<0.05; Figure 2B and Figure IIIA in the
online-only Data Supplement) or transient ischemia (transient
MCAO; Figure IIIB in the online-only Data Supplement),

determined either by magnetic resonance imaging at 24 hours
or by TTC staining at 48 hours. Animals treated with TMF
also presented a lower modified Neurological Severity Score
48 hours after MCAO (Figure IIIA in the online-only Data
Supplement). This improvement was also seen with another
AhR antagonist, CH (10 mg/kg; n=7; P<0.05; Figure 2C).
Finally, AhR activation by the prototypical AhR agonist
benzo[a]pyrene increased infarct volume compared with the
vehicle group (40 mg/kg; n=7; P<0.05; Figure 2D); therefore,
AhR inhibition or activation results in neuroprotection or
potentiation, respectively, of brain damage after stroke.
To confirm these results, WT, AhR+/−, and AhR−/− mice
were used (Figure 2E and Figure IVA–IVC in the online-only
Data Supplement). First, haploinsufficiency in AhR+/−mice,
in which the expression levels of AhR and the AhR target

gene AhRR after MCAO were lower than in the WT group
(n=5; P<0.05), was also neuroprotective, showing a reduction in infarct volume (n=7–9; P<0.05; Figure IVD in the
online-only Data Supplement) and a decrease in neurological
deficits 48 hours after ischemia (Figure IVE and IVF in the
online-only Data Supplement) compared with their WT littermates. Complete loss of AhR in AhR−/− mice also resulted
in neuroprotection after MCAO (n=7–11; P<0.05; Figure 2E)
compared with the AhR+/+ group. Finally, AhR−/− mice were
treated with either TMF or benzo[a]pyrene after MCAO to
demonstrate their AhR-dependent effects. Two-way ANOVA
demonstrated a significant effect of AhR genotype (P<0.05),
treatment (P<0.05), and AhR genotype–by–treatment interaction (P<0.05). Whereas treatment of AhR+/+ animals
with the AhR antagonist TMF or the AhR agonist benzo[a]

pyrene caused a reduction or an increase in the infarct volume, respectively (n=7–11; P<0.05 versus AhR+/+ vehicle;
Figure 2E), these effects were lost in AhR−/− mice (n=7–11;
P>0.05 versus AhR−/− vehicle; Figure 2E), demonstrating that
the neuroprotective or harmful actions of TMF and benzo[a]
pyrene, respectively, are entirely AhR dependent. Together,
these results demonstrate a detrimental role of AhR in the
acute phase of ischemic injury in vivo.

AhR Regulates cAMP Response Element-Binding
Protein Survival/Death Signaling After Ischemia:
Effect of AhR Pharmacological Modulation

Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

AhR has been implicated in numerous physiological and pathological processes.2,4 The absence of changes in the inflammatory milieu after AhR inhibition (Figure V in the online-only
Data Supplement) and the specific neuronal expression of
AhR in our in vivo model suggest that AhR exerts its main
functions in neurons after cerebral ischemia. Indeed, our
findings in rat cortical neurons exposed to OGD (Figure VI
in the online-only Data Supplement) corroborate the results
observed in vivo, inasmuch as AhR expression and activation
were increased after OGD in cortical rat neurons and AhR
inhibition protected neurons against ischemic damage.
cAMP response element (CRE)–binding protein (CREB) is
one of the most important neuronal transcription factors known
by its implication in the expression of survival and antiapoptotic
genes such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on
binding to CRE.21,22 Previous studies suggested that AhR might
impair CREB-mediated neuronal BDNF gene expression.12
Therefore, we explored BDNF expression after MCAO or AhR
inhibition. The AhR antagonist TMF increased cortical BDNF
levels in sham-operated mice (n=6; P<0.05; Figure 3A) 24 hours
after surgery. After MCAO, BDNF levels increased, showing a
positive correlation with lesion size (n=5; Spearman r=0.7062,
P=0.0182; Figure 3B). As a result, BDNF values were normalized for infarct volumes, and thus, we found that animals treated
with TMF had higher normalized BDNF levels compared with
the vehicle group (n=5; P<0.05; Figure 3B), suggesting an
inhibitory effect of AhR on CREB-mediated BDNF expression.
Because CREB signaling leads to inhibition of apoptotic
cascades,23 we reasoned that AhR could modulate proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins after MCAO. Indeed, the
AhR antagonist TMF reduced proapoptotic proteins p53 and
Puma and increased the antiapoptotic Bcl-X (n=5–6; P<0.05;
Figure 3C–3E). No changes were observed in Bax, Bad, and
Bix (data not shown). Furthermore, cleaved caspase 3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling
staining showed a decreased number of apoptotic cells in the
peri-infarct region of MCAO animals treated with TMF compared with the vehicle group (n=3; Figure 3F and 3G).
Thus, our data suggest that AhR activation after cerebral
ischemia inhibits CREB signaling and subsequent CREBinduced prosurvival pathways. Of note, CREB and phosphorylated CREB (ser133) levels were increased in vivo
and in vitro after administration of the AhR antagonist TMF
(n=5–6; P<0.05; Figure 3H and Figure VIIA in the onlineonly Data Supplement). Accordingly, nucleofection of cortical neurons with a CRE-responsive luciferase construct
demonstrated that AhR inhibition by TMF increases CREB

transcriptional activity in control and OGD neurons (n=12;
P<0.05; Figure 3I). The increase in mRNA levels of Bdnf
and Npas4, another CREB target gene, in TMF-treated cortical neurons exposed to OGD (Figure VIIB in the online-only
Data Supplement) further supports that AhR inhibits CREB
transcriptional activity.
Finally, AhR coimmunoprecipitation after in vivo MCAO
(n=3–4; P<0.05; Figure 3J) or in vitro OGD (n=3–4; P<0.05;
Figure VIIC in the online-only Data Supplement) showed
an increased interaction of AhR with CREB-binding protein
(CBP) and with CREB, suggesting that the AhR inhibitory
effect on CREB signaling could be due, at least in part, to a
direct interaction with the CREB/CBP complex. Consistently,
AhR inhibition by TMF significantly reduced receptor association to both CBP and CREB.

L-Kyn Is an Endogenous AhR Ligand in Cerebral
Ischemia
A variety of endogenous ligands have been demonstrated to
activate AhR in different models.3 Our findings strongly suggest that AhR is activated by an endogenous agonist generated
by cerebral ischemic damage. L-Kyn, a key metabolite of the
kynurenine pathway (Figure 4A), has recently been identified
as an in vivo AhR agonist.8 Because this pathway is activated
after stroke,24 we explored whether L-Kyn could account for
endogenous AhR activation in cerebral ischemia.
First, levels of L-Kyn and its precursor, L-tryptophan
(L-Trp), were determined in the ipsilateral cortex and in
plasma (Figure 4B–4E). Two-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of surgery (P<0.05), time (P<0.05), and surgeryby-time interaction (P<0.05) in brain L-Kyn and L-Trp levels
but not in plasma. Brain L-Kyn levels increased as early as 3
hours after MCAO and remained elevated 24 hours after (n=7–
10; P<0.05; Figure 4B). This increase was associated with an
initial increase and a subsequent reduction in L-Trp levels
from 3 to 24 hours after MCAO (n=7–10; P<0.05; Figure 4C).
After MCAO, no changes were observed in plasma L-Kyn and
L-Trp levels (n=7–14; Figure 4D and 4E).
The specific increase in L-Kyn after MCAO in brain but
not in plasma made us reason that local L-Kyn biosynthesis
could be induced after ischemia. Consequently, we tested
brain mRNA expression of Ido and Tdo, the 2 key enzymes
in the initial step of the kynurenine pathway (Figure 4A).25
Whereas no changes were detected in Ido1 and Ido2 mRNA
levels (n=5; Figure 4F), ischemia increased the expression of
Tdo compared with sham animals (n=5; P<0.05; Figure 4F).
This result was confirmed by immunofluorescence (n=3;
Figure 4G): Whereas sham animals presented low TDO levels in the ipsilateral cortex, MCAO increased TDO expression in the core and peri-infarct regions 5 and 24 hours after
the occlusion. Colocalization experiments demonstrated that
TDO is located mainly in neurons and by some astrocytes
(n=3; Figure 4H). Ischemia-induced TDO upregulation indicates that, in addition to the augmented peripheral L-Kyn synthesis after stroke,24 local L-Kyn production is increased and
is expected to contribute to brain L-Kyn levels after MCAO.
Hence, L-Kyn could be the endogenous AhR agonist in this
setting. Thus, we decided to examine the effects of L-Kyn
in cultured cortical neurons. First, L-Kyn activated AhR

L-Kyn Plays a Deleterious Role in Cerebral
Ischemia Through AhR Activation
The neuroprotection achieved by AhR inhibition in in vivo and
in vitro ischemia implies a deleterious role of L-Kyn through

AhR activation. Indeed, L-Kyn aggravated OGD-induced
neuronal damage, assessed by morphological analysis and
lactate dehydrogenase release determination (n=24; P<0.05;
Figure 5A and 5B), an effect reversed by TMF, indicating
that L-Kyn–induced deleterious effects after OGD depend
on AhR activation. In vivo, intraperitoneal administration of
L-Kyn (10 mg/kg) after MCAO increased brain and plasma

L-Kyn levels (n=5–10; P<0.05; Figure 5C and 5D) concomitantly with an increase in infarct volume (n=7–10; P<0.05;
Figure 5E and 5F) compared with the vehicle group, an effect
not observed at a lower dose of L-Kyn (5 mg/kg; n=7; P>0.05;
Figure 5E). Moreover, the L-Kyn–induced increase in infarct
volume was AhR dependent; it was absent after coadministration of the AhR antagonist TMF or in AhR−/− mice (n=7;
P<0.05; Figure 5E and 5F).
Having demonstrated that exogenous L-Kyn has an AhRdependent, detrimental role after ischemia, we finally explored
whether inhibition of L-Kyn biosynthesis was neuroprotective
in this setting. The TDO inhibitor 680C91 reduced infarct

volume compared with the vehicle-treated group (n=10;
P<0.05; Figure 6A). However, no differences were observed
between vehicle and the IDO inhibitor 1-methyl-d-tryptophan
(n=7; Figure 6B), supporting that brain TDO activity accounts
for L-Kyn biosynthesis after stroke. Coadministration of
L-Kyn abolished the neuroprotective actions of the TDO
inhibitor (n=7; P<0.05; Figure 6C). In addition, TDO inhibition after MCAO abolished the postischemic brain L-Kyn
augmentation while producing an accumulation of L-Trp
(n=5–7; P<0.05; Figure 6D and 6E), reinforcing that neuroprotective actions of TDO inhibition are mediated by a reduction in L-Kyn synthesis after stroke.

Finally, we investigated whether TDO inhibition, by diminishing L-Kyn levels, might decrease AhR activation. Indeed,
the TDO inhibitor decreased AhR activation after in vivo (n=7;
P<0.05; Figure 6F) and in vitro (n=5; P<0.05; Figure 6G–6I)
cerebral ischemia. Together, our results demonstrate that inhibition of TDO-mediated L-Kyn biosynthesis decreases AhR
activation and its subsequent deleterious effects after experimental stroke.

Discussion

AhR or dioxin receptor is a transcription factor with important roles in xenobiotic-induced toxicity and carcinogenesis
but also in some physiological functions such as reproduction, organ homeostasis, and adaptive immunity.2,7,26 Now, the
results presented here show that cerebral ischemia induces
AhR overexpression and activation in neurons, which participate in ischemic brain damage concomitantly with the
downregulation of CREB prosurvival pathways. We have also
found that cerebral ischemia induces the synthesis of L-Kyn,
an L-Trp metabolite with AhR agonistic properties that may
account for the endogenous activation of AhR in this setting.
These data are the first to demonstrate a pathophysiological
role of this receptor in the context of stroke, a high-incidence
cerebrovascular pathology with limited therapeutic treatment.
We have found that AhR is overexpressed in mouse brain after
experimental stroke, mainly in neurons located at the peri-infarct
but also at the ischemic core. Likewise, AhR expression is found
in cultured rat cortical neurons, as previously reported,12,13,27 and
increases after in vitro experimental ischemia. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first evidence showing that AhR signaling pathways are induced in neurons after a deleterious stimulus
such as cerebral ischemia. The early profiles of AhR activation
and transcriptional activity strongly point to a damaging role of
this receptor in stroke physiopathology.
Indeed, using pharmacological and genetic loss-of-function
approaches, we have demonstrated the detrimental role of
AhR in the ischemic brain. After in vivo experimental stroke
by permanent MCAO, 2 different AhR antagonists, TMF14 and
CH,15 were neuroprotective. The antagonism of AhR (with
TMF) was also beneficial when ischemia was followed by
recanalization (transient MCAO). Conversely, AhR activation
by the prototypical AhR agonist benzo[a]pyrene aggravated
stroke outcome. In addition, either AhR haploinsufficiency
or total deletion decreased ischemic damage and improved
neurological scores. The ligands used failed to affect stroke
outcome in AhR−/− mice, showing that their actions are AhR
dependent. The deleterious effects of in vivo AhR activation
were confirmed in cortical neurons exposed to OGD. All these
data together demonstrate that AhR participates in acute cerebral damage after ischemic stroke and that specific antagonists
of this receptor such as TMF may be useful for inhibiting the
detrimental actions of this receptor after cerebral ischemia.
Several studies have demonstrated that AhR inhibition
reduces neuronal apoptosis27,28 and neurotoxicity concomitant
with an increase in BDNF.12,13 In this context, CREB is a critical
transcription factor against ischemic injury because of its target genes that include the neuroprotective neurotrophin BDNF
and the so-called activity-regulated inhibitor of death genes
or by antagonizing apoptotic death signals.29–31 Indeed, our

results show that the AhR antagonist TMF increased normalized BDNF levels and decreased apoptosis by affecting apoptosis-related genes after MCAO. In vitro studies confirmed that
AhR inhibits CREB transcriptional activity, as revealed by an
upregulation of BDNF and NPAS4 and by an increase in CREresponsive luciferase activity in cultured neurons exposed to
OGD and AhR inhibition. These data strongly suggest that inhibition of CREB signaling participates in the detrimental role of
AhR after stroke. Because in vivo and in vitro coimmunoprecipitation experiments of AhR demonstrate its direct interaction
with CBP and CREB, our results support that cerebral ischemia
increases AhR recruitment to CBP/CREB complexes playing
an inhibitory role in CREB survival genes.
Supporting that AhR is an important modulator of physiological functions, several endogenous AhR ligands have been
described. Our study demonstrates that one of them, L-Kyn,8,16–18
an L-Trp derivative through the so-called kynurenine pathway,
is a key AhR ligand in neurons. Interestingly, in both animals
and humans, the kynurenine pathway is increased after stroke
and is associated with stroke severity and poor prognosis.24,32
Consistently, we found that brain L-Kyn levels increased as
early as 3 hours and remained elevated 24 hours after MCAO,
coinciding with the maximal nuclear AhR expression. In vitro,
L-Kyn induced AhR nuclear translocation and upregulation of
AhR target genes in a manner similar to the classic AhR agonist TCDD, effects that were inhibited by the AhR antagonist TMF or in AhR−/− mice. All these results support that, in
the ischemic setting, L-Kyn is the endogenous AhR ligand
responsible for neuronal AhR activation.
In normal brain, 60% of L-Kyn is taken up from blood,33
and 40% is generated locally from L-Trp, which is transported
across the blood-brain barrier. The initial step of the brain
kynurenine pathway is carried out mostly by 2 key enzymes,
IDO and TDO, which metabolize L-Trp into different metabolites, including L-Kyn. TDO is expressed in mainly liver but
is also present in brain,34–36 suggesting a role in brain function.
Supporting this, we demonstrate that TDO, but not IDO, is
upregulated predominantly in neurons of the ipsilateral cortex
of the ischemic brain. In addition, L-Trp, an amino acid that
regulates TDO function,37 is significantly increased in brain
after ischemia. All these data point toward L-Kyn synthesis
by TDO as the main pathway for the augmented L-Kyn concentration in the ischemic brain. Importantly, TDO inhibition
abolished, at early times, both the L-Kyn increase and AhR
nuclear translocation in the ischemic brain, as well as AhR
activation and transcriptional activity after OGD in cultured
neurons, strongly suggesting that, in vivo, AhR is activated by
L-Kyn very rapidly after the ischemic occlusion and is thus
causally involved in brain damage at those crucial times at
which lesion is expanding after the arrest of the blood flow
in the affected area. We cannot disregard that some cerebral
L- Kyn may derive from the periphery because large amounts
of L-Kyn are produced in the liver through L-Trp degradation
by TDO.38 In addition, local synthesis of L-Kyn by microglia, astrocytes, or macrophages in the ischemic brain could
also occur in an inflammatory microenvironment.39 Of note,
both AhR and TDO are coexpressed by neurons placed in the
infarct border (data not shown), suggesting both a paracrine
and an autocrine model for AhR activation by L-Kyn.

Therefore, apart from AhR, we have identified TDO as an
important therapeutic target because its inhibition drastically
reduced brain ischemic damage concomitantly with a decrease
in brain L-Kyn concentration and with an inhibition of AhR
activation. From our data, we can conclude that a cascade of
events, initiated by the early activation and overexpression of
AhR and TDO-mediated L-Kyn biosynthesis followed by the
subsequent downregulation of endogenous neuroprotective or
antiapoptotic pathways, participates in brain damage (lesion
size and neurological function) after ischemic stroke.
The kynurenine pathway is becoming recognized as a key
player in the mechanisms of neuronal damage in several neurodegenerative disorders (for a review, see Vécsei et al25).
L-Kyn has a central role on this pathway because its degradation by different enzymes generates neuroactive metabolites such as quinolinic acid and kynurenic acid, which show
agonistic and antagonistic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor
properties, respectively. Accordingly, studies on the effect
of L-Kyn are controversial. L-Kyn, apparently by elevating
brain kynurenic acid levels, results in neuroprotection when
administered before hypoxia/ischemia and N-methyl-daspartate lesions40–43; conversely, and in agreement with our
data, postischemic L-Kyn administration exacerbated acute
neuronal damage after MCAO.44 Therefore, direct actions of
L-Kyn, without the involvement of its downstream metabolites, remained obscure. In addition, although AhR-dependent,
immunosuppressive, and anti-inflammatory properties of
L-Kyn have been reported in several systems,8,16–18 we show
here that they do not play a role in our setting. To the best of
our knowledge, our present data are the first to prove that the
neurotoxic actions of L-Kyn are AhR dependent, thus providing a novel mechanistic insight for previously described deleterious actions of L-Kyn in the central nervous system.

Conclusions
Our study links both L-Kyn and AhR signaling routes in ischemic brain injury and thus recognizes the L-Kyn/AhR pathway
as a potential therapeutic target in this setting. Our findings also
demonstrate that this pathway may be therapeutically targeted at
2 different levels, L-Kyn biosynthesis by TDO and AhR activation, posing novel possibilities for the treatment of acute stroke.
Furthermore, our results open new lines of investigation into the
effects of the interference of this pathway at later time points or
when the occluded blood vessel is recanalized by recombinant
tissue-type plasminogen activator, as in clinical practice, or the
consequences that polymorphisms of this receptor may have
on stroke outcome. In addition, considering the well-described
role of AhR in xenobiotic-induced toxicity and carcinogenesis,
further studies are required to determine whether exposure to
environmental contaminants such as dioxin could affect susceptibility to stroke damage in patients at risk or even the development of idiopathic neurodegenerative diseases.

Clinical Perspective
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) or dioxin receptor is a ligand-activated transcription factor, classically defined as a
transcriptional regulator involved in adaptive xenobiotic response, but with increasing importance in cellular physiology and
tumor development. However, its actions in models of acute injury by circulatory pathologies such as stroke have not been
illustrated. Therefore, we studied AhR expression and function in in vivo and in vitro experimental stroke. Here, we show for
the first time that AhR is upregulated in the ischemic brain and plays a causal role in acute ischemic damage. Inhibition of
cAMP response element-binding protein–dependent signaling may be involved in the deleterious actions of AhR. Moreover,
we have also found that L-kynurenine, a tryptophan metabolite, is elevated in brain and plasma after experimental stroke
and is an endogenous ligand that mediates AhR activation in the brain in this setting. In summary, our study recognizes the
L-Kyn/AhR pathway as a potential therapeutic target in this setting, that may be therapeutically interfered with at 2 different levels, L-Kyn biosynthesis by tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase and AhR activation, thus posing novel possibilities for
the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Furthermore, our results open new lines of investigation on the consequences that
polymorphisms of this receptor may have on stroke outcome. In addition, considering the well-described role of AhR in
xenobiotic-induced toxicity and carcinogenesis, further studies are required to determine whether exposure to environmental contaminants such as dioxin could affect susceptibility to stroke damage in patients at risk, or even the development of
idiopathic neurodegenerative diseases.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Supplementary Methods
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice
The surgical procedure was a variant of that described by Chen et al. (1986)1
and Liu et al. (1989)2. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane 1.5-2% in a mixture of
80% air/20% oxygen, and body temperature was maintained at physiological levels
with a heating pad during the surgical procedure and anesthesia recovery. Mice were
subjected to permanent focal cerebral ischemia (MCAO) through the distal occlusion of
middle cerebral artery (MCA) by ligature of the trunk just before its bifurcation between
the frontal and parietal branches with a 9-0 suture, in combination with the occlusion of
the ipsilateral common carotid artery. For transient MCAO (tMCAO), mice were
reperfused 60 minutes after the occlusion. Mice in which the MCA was exposed but not
occluded served as sham-operated controls (sham). Following surgery, individual
animals were returned to their cages with free access to water and food. All the groups
were performed and quantified in a randomized fashion by investigators blinded to
treatment groups. Physiological parameters were not significantly different among the
different groups studied.

Infarct volume measurement and assessment of functional deficits
Brain was removed and cut into 1-mm thick coronal slices and stained with
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (1% TTC in 0.1M phosphate buffer). Infarct size was
determined as follows: infarct volumes were measured by sampling stained sections
with a digital camera (Nikon Coolpix 990, Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and the
image of each section was analyzed using ImageJ 1.44l (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).
The digitalized image was displayed on a video monitor. With the observer masked to
the experimental conditions, the areas of the infarcted tissue (InfArea), the whole
ipsilesional

hemisphere

(IpsArea)

and

the

whole

contralesional

hemisphere

(ContrArea) are delineated for each slice. Then, infarct volume, expressed as % of the
	  

1

hemisphere that is infarcted (%IH), is calculated using the formula, as it has been
previously described3:
%IH = InfVol/ContrVol*100
where
InfVol (Infarcted Tissue Volume) = ΣInfAreai/SwellingIndexi,
ContrVol (Contralesional Hemisphere Volume) = ΣContrAreai
and SwellingIndexi = IpsAreai/ContrAreai.
In addition, infarct size was determined by magnetic resonance imaging 24 hours after
MCAO using a BIOSPEC BMT 47/40 (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany). Infarct volume was
calculated using the ImageJ software (NIH, USA) from the T2-weighted images.
The functional deficits produced by the stroke were graded 48h after MCAO
using the grip test, in which mice are placed on a suspended wire and latency to fall is
measured, and the modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS), as previously
described4-5. This neurological score evaluates motor symptoms (hemiparesis and
gait), balance and reflexes.

Primary cultures of rat cortical neurons
Rat cortical neuronal cultures were performed as described6. Studies were
performed at 14 days in vitro (DIV), time at which the cultures consisted of 94±6%
neurons, as determined by flow cytometry7.

Exposure of cortical neurons to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)
As an in vitro cerebral ischemia model OGD followed by reoxygenation was
used. This model is a commonly used in vitro stroke model that recapitulates both
permanent and transient cerebral ischemia as it produces both necrotic and apoptotic
cell phenotype7-8. Exposure of cortical neurons to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)
was performed as described previously6,8-9. Culture medium was replaced by a solution

	  

2

containing (in mM): NaCl (130), KCl (5.4), CaCl2 (1.8), NaHCO3 (26), MgCl2 (0.8),
NaH2PO4 (1.18) and 2% horse serum (HS) bubbled with 95%N2/5% CO2, humidified at
37ºC, and maintained at a constant pressure of 0.15 bars. Time of exposure to OGD
was 150 minutes. OGD was terminated by replacing the exposure medium with
oxygenated MEM containing 0.6% glucose, 0.029% glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin,
50µg/ml streptomycin, 2% HS (reperfusion medium) and returned to the normoxic
incubator. Control cultures in a solution identical to OGD solution but containing
glucose (33mM; control solution) were kept in the normoxic incubator for the same time
period as the OGD, incubation solution was then replaced with reperfusion buffer and
cultures were returned to the normoxic incubator until the end of the experiment.

Measurement of cell viability after OGD
As a marker of necrotic tissue damage LDH activity from damaged neurons was
determined. Culture medium and 1%Triton X-100/PBS cell lysate were collected 24h
after OGD. LDH activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by following
the oxidation of NADH (decrease in absorbance) in the presence of pyruvate10 using a
Sunrise micro-plate reader (TECAN). LDH was measured in at least six different wells
per experiment, and the experiment was repeated at least three times. LDH release to
medium was calculated as percentage of total LDH (determined in cell lysate) and
expressed as percentage of OGD-induced LDH. To correct background due to HS or
phenol-red medium, an internal control (culture medium) was included. Basal LDH was
6±1% for control OGD neurons. Changes in the morphology of neurons treated with
different drugs and exposed to OGD were observed using a phase-contrast
microscope (Olympus). Neurons with fragmented neurites and vacuolated soma were
considered non-viable, whereas neurons with intact neurites and a cell body that was
smooth and round-to-oval in shape were considered viable.

Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen, USA) from brain
homogenates or cell cultures (n=5-7 per group). RNA (1 µg) was reverse-transcribed
using the iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (BioRad, Germany) and quantitative real-time
PCR was performed in triplicate using a BioRad iQ5 Thermocycler. The mRNA
expression was normalized to that of actin and expressed as the fold difference relative
to the controls. Specific primers were designed using Primer Express software and are
indicated in Supplementary Table 1.

Nucleofection and reporter gene assay
A luciferase reporter plasmid with a multimerized CREB binding consensus
sequence located upstream of a minimal promoter was used. The CRE luciferase
construct serves as an indicator of CREB activity. Cultured primary cortical neurons of
7DIV were nucleofected using the AD1 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector Y kit (Lonza) with
6µg CRE luciferase plasmid, following manufacturer’s instructions. Seven days after
nucleofection, cortical neurons were subjected to OGD and treated with either vehicle,
the AhR antagonist TMF, the AhR agonist TCDD or L-Kyn (n=8; 3 different
experiments). Six hours after reperfusion, luciferase quantification was performed with
the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Each sample was assayed in triplicate and
data were presented as the % of control neurons treated with vehicle.

TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP Nick-End Labeling) Assay
TUNEL assay was performed using In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, TMR red
(Roche) following manufacturer’s instructions.

Nuclear extracts
Brain tissue from C57Bl/6 mice collected from ipsilateral cortex after MCAO
(n=4) or primary cortical cultures (n=5) were used for nuclei isolation. Nuclear extracts
	  

4

were prepared crushing tissue or incubating the cell suspension of the culture in 10mM
HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5mM MgCl2, 10mM KCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P40. Nuclei were
pelleted at 12,000g for 1 min at 4ºC and lyzed in 20mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 15mM MgCl2,
420mM NaCl and 0.2mM EDTA. After centrifugation (12,000g for 5 min at 4ºC), the
pellet was discarded and 50 µg of enriched nuclear protein supernatant were used for
SDS-PAGE and western blot.

SDS-PAGE and Western blot
For determination of total protein levels, brain tissue was collected from the
peri-infarct and infarct areas of mice (n=4-5) killed 5, 18, 24, 48 and 72h and 7days
after MCAO. Samples were homogenized by sonication using lysis buffer: 10mM Tris–
HCl pH 8.0, 420mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA and 0.5% NP-40 with protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche Diagnostics). Equal amounts of total protein (30µg) were resolved by SDSPAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (HybondTM-P; Amersham Biosciences
Europe GmbH). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T (0.05%
Tween 20 in TBS) and incubated with rabbit anti-AhR (Enzo Life Sciences, 1:1000),
rabbit anti-ARNT (1:500, Thermo Scientific), mouse Anti-CREB (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; 1:500), mouse anti-pCREB (Cell Signaling; 1:1000), Rabbit Anti-CBP
(Santa Cruz Biothecnology; 1:500), Rabbit Anti-p53 (Cell Signaling; 1:500), Rabbit AntiPuma (Santa Cruz Biothecnology; 1:250) and Rabbit Anti-Bcl-x (Cell Signaling; 1:500).
Anti mouse β-actin (Sigma; 1:10000) was included to ensure equal protein loading and
Sp1 to determine the purity of cytoplasmic/nuclear extracts. Immunoreactive bands
were visualized using the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and subsequent enhanced chemiluminescence detection
(PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences). The chemiluminiscent signal was acquired
with a CCD camera (Syngene) and quantified with Gene Tools software (Syngene).

Analysis of L-tryptophan and L-kynurenine by HPLC
Sham and MCAO animals were sacrificed at 3, 16 and 24 after MCAO and
brain and plasma were collected to determine L-tryptophan (L-Trp) and L-kynurenine
(L-Kyn) levels. After brain extraction, core and peri-infarct areas from ischemic mice (or
a similar region for sham and naïve animals) were dissected out from the brains under
a microscope, weighed and snap-frozen. Due to the sensitivity of the assay, for brain
kynurenine determination, brain tissue from 2 animals per condition was pooled.
Plasma was taken from each single animal used for brain tissue isolation. Therefore,
each brain kynurenine determination corresponds to brain tissue from two animals and
each plasma kynurenine determination corresponds to one single animal.
Cortex samples were added to a zinc acetate mobile phase (50nM glacial acetic
acid, 100mM zinc acetate and 3% acetonitrile dissolved in double-distilled NANO pure
water, pH 4.9) containing 6% perchloric acid (for protein precipitation) and 200ng/20µl
internal

standard

(N-methyl-serotonin).

The

samples

were

then

sonicated

(approximately 10s), vortexed vigorously, and centrifuged at 4°C and 14,000 rpm for 20
minutes. The supernatants were then transferred into new eppendorf tubes, using a
syringe fitted with a 0.45µm filter (Phenomenex). Serum samples were defrosted on ice
and added to an equal volume of the mobile phase containing 6% perchloric acid and
200ng/20µl internal standard (N-methyl-serotonin). The samples were then vortexed
vigorously, and centrifuged at 4°C and 14,000 rpm for 20 minutes. The supernatants
were processed as described above.
L-Trp and L-Kyn were analyzed using the Shimadzu ADVP system, with
injection volumes of 20µl. A Reverse-Phase analytical column (Kinetex™ Core Shell
Technology column with specific area of 100mm x 4.6mm and particle size of 2.6µm,
Phenomenex), fitted with a guard column is used, coupled to a PDA-UV detector
(Shimadzu SPD-M10A VP) (L-Kyn, L-Trp), calibrated to integrate at 230nm, 250nm,

	  

6

and 365nm, as well as a fluorescent detector (Shimadzu RF-20A XS prominence
fluorescence detector) (internal standard), set to excitation wavelength 254nm and
emission wavelength 404nm. The flow rate was 0.8ml/min and the acquisition time was
18 minutes. The signal to noise ratio is 3:1. Peak height was used to determine
unknown sample concentration. Basal levels were estimated in naïve animals (t=0h).
Data were represented as ng of L-Trp and L-Kyn per g of tissue in brain samples or per
ml in plasma samples.

Co-immunoprecipitation
Ipsilateral cortices of mice were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer containing
50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA-Na, 1% NP-40, 0.02% sodium
azide, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche
Diagnostics). After lysis for 15 min, samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min.
Neurons were washed twice in PBS, and then lysed in 400µl of the previously
described buffer; lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The
supernatants were pre-incubated for 1 h at 4°C with 0.025 ml of protein G-sepharose
beads (Sigma-Aldrich), and then centrifuged to remove nonspecifically-adhered
proteins and obtain the target supernatant for the subsequent IP experiment. The
cleared supernatants were incubated with Rabbit anti-AhR (Enzo life Sciences) and
Rabbit anti-CBP (SantaCruz Biothecnology) antibodies overnight. The antibodiesconjugated tissue sample and the protein G-sepharose beads were added for
incubation during 4 hours. Immune complexes were isolated by centrifugation, and
bound proteins were eluted by heating at 100°C in loading buffer. Proteins were
analyzed by western blot.

Cerebral BDNF levels determination
BDNF levels were determined with BDNF Emax™ ImmunoAssay System,
(Promega) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The tissue-containing tubes were
	  

7

weighed, and 100 µl of pre-chilled lysis buffer (20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 137 mM
NaCl, 1% Nonidet-P40, 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mM
sodium vanadate, 10 µM aprotinin, 10 µM actinonin, and 100 µM leupeptin) was added
to each tube, followed by sonication. BDNF levels were calculated from the standard
curve prepared for each plate, using a Sunrise microplate reader (TECAN). The
standard curves were linear within the range used (0–500 pg/ml) and the quantities of
BDNF in experimental samples were always within the linear range of the standard
curve.

Immunofluorescence
For AhR detection after brain ischemia mice were anesthetized with sodium
pentobarbital (120 mg/kg) 5, 18, 24, 48 hours, and 3 and 7 days after ligation
(n=4/group) and perfused transcardiacally with 0.1M phosphate buffer containing 5ml
of heparin sulfate (1000 U/ml) followed by 4% p-formaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4). Sham-operated mice served as controls (n=4/group). The brains were
post-fixed overnight and placed in 30% sucrose for 2 days. Coronal series sections
(30µm) were cut on a freezing microtome (Leica SM2000R, Leica Microsystems
GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) and stored in cryoprotective solution. Double-label
immunofluorescence was performed on free-floating sections and tissue sections were
incubated overnight at 4ºC with rabbit anti mouse AhR (1:250, Enzo Life Sciences),
mouse anti-mouse AhR (1:250, Enzo Life Sciences), mouse anti-mouse NeuN (1:500,
Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents), mouse anti-mouse GFAP (1:500, BD
Biosciences), rabbit anti-mouse Iba1 (1:500, Wako), and anti-goat TDO (1:100;
SantaCruz).
For AhR immunodetection in rat neuronal cultures, control and OGD neurons
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and probed with rabbit polyclonal antibody
against AhR (1:250; Enzo Life Sciences) and with mouse monoclonal antibody antiNeuN (1:250; Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents).

The secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit biotin, goat anti-mouse
biotin and donkey anti-rat biotin (Vector laboratories) in combination with Alexa488
streptavidin (Molecular Probes), donkey Cy3 anti-rat (Jackson Immunoresearch) and
donkey Cy3 anti-mouse (Vector Laboratories). For DNA staining we used TOPRO3
(Invitrogen). Controls performed in parallel without primary antibodies showed very low
levels of nonspecific staining.
Image acquisition was performed with a laser-scanning confocal imaging
system (Zeiss LSM710) and image analysis was performed with the ZEN2009 software
(Zeiss). All co-localization images shown were confirmed by orthogonal projection of zstack files. To quantify the nuclear fluorescent intensities, the TOPRO signal was used
to draw manually around individual neuronal nucleus assessed by NeuN staining. On
average, 50-200 cells were analyzed per coverslip (4/group, 2-3 different experiments).
All quantification was performed with ImageJ Software (National Institutes of Health).

Protein determination by cytometric bead array (CBA)
Protein homogenates from brain infarcted tissue obtained 24h after MCAO were
used to measure the protein levels of IL-10, TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1 and IL-12/IL-23p40 by
a BDTM Cytometric Bead Array (CBA). This assay allows for the discrimination of
different particles on the basis of size and fluorescence. Capture Antibodies (Abs) were
covalently coupled to microspheres (beads) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (BD Bioscience). Samples or standards were added to 75mm tubes
containing 50µl of mixed capture beads followed by 1-hour incubation at room
temperature. Then, 50µl of phycoerythrin (PE) detection reagent (BD Bioscience) was
added to each sample or standard tube and left 1 hour at RT. After the incubation,
samples and standards were washed with the kit buffer and centrifuged 5 min at 200g.
Finally, the supernatant was discarded and another 300µl of wash buffer were added to
each tube.

Four-color flow cytometric analysis was performed using a FACSCalibur® flow
cytometer (BD). Data were acquired with the BD CellquestTM PRO and analyzed using
the FCAP ArrayTM software. FSC vs. SSC gating was employed to exclude any
sample particles other than the 7.5-µm polystyrene beads. Data were displayed as twocolor dot plots (FL-2 vs. FL-4) such that the eight discrete FL-4 microparticle dye
intensities were distributed along the Y-axis. Standard curves were plotted [cytokine
calibrator concentration vs. FL-2 mean fluorescenceintensity (MFI)] using a fourparameter logistic curve-fitting model. Cytokine concentrations were determined from
these standard curves. When a sample had a cytokine concentration below the
detection limit for the assay, a value of 0 was assigned for that particular cytokine
concentration.

levels of inflammatory mediators after permanent middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO). Protein levels of IL-6 (A), IL-10 (B), TNF-α (C), MCP-1 (D) and IL12p70 (E) were determined 24 hours after MCAO by a cytometric bead array in vehicle
and TMF (5 mg/Kg)-treated mice (n=6 for each group except for sham vehicle group,
n=5). Samples were tested in duplicate. Data were compared by a non-parametric twoway ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc testing (A-E: *P<0.05 vs. Sham Vehicle).
Two-way ANOVA for IL-6, IL-10 and MCP1 showed a significant effect of surgery F
(1,14) =17.82; P=0.0009), F(1,14)=22.48; P=0.0003) and F(1,14)=21.09; P=0.0004,

in the right plots. Data are represented as % of CBP/AhR or % of CREB/AhR of control
neurons treated with vehicle (n=3). Data were compared by non-parametric 2-tailed
Mann-Whitney tests (A-B: *P<0.05 vs. Vehicle) or a non-parametric two-way ANOVA
followed by Bonferroni post-hoc testing (C: *P<0.05 vs. Control Vehicle, #P<0.05 vs.
