Abstract—Interleukin (IL)-17A plays an important role in the
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the
mechanisms are still largely unknown. Calpain-transient
receptor potential canonical (subtype) 6 (TRPC6) signaling
pathway has been recently found to be implicated in brain
I/R injury. However, their relationships with IL-17A remain
unknown. This study aims to test whether this important
signaling has correlation with IL-17A and how they led to
the neuronal damage in I/R injury. In the present study, mice
were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (60 min)
followed by reperfusion for diﬀerent times. Infarct volumes
and neurological deﬁcits were examined. Real-time PCR
(RT-PCR) and Western blotting were conducted to detect
IL-17A expression in the penumbral brain tissue. Activation
of calpain and expression of TRPC6 were also studied. We
found that cerebral I/R signiﬁcantly increased the levels of
IL-17A at 1, 3 and 6 days after reperfusion in the penumbral
area. IL-17A knockout or anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody
(mAb) signiﬁcantly reduced whereas recombinant mouseIL-17A (rIL-17A) increased the activation of calpain at 3 days
after reperfusion. The calpain speciﬁc inhibitor calpeptin
signiﬁcantly increased TRPC6 expression. Brain injury and
neurological deﬁcits were largely abrogated by IL-17A
knockout, anti-IL-17A mAb or calpeptin. Recombinant
IL-17A treatment markedly increased I/R injury. In conclusion, IL-17A may promote brain I/R injury through the
increase of calpain-mediated TRPC6 proteolysis. These
results further outline a novel neuroprotective strategy with

INTRODUCTION
Stroke is the third leading cause of death in industrialized
countries (Lo et al., 2003) and the most frequent cause of
permanent disability in adults worldwide (Donnan et al.,
2008). At present, the only available treatment is thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator
(rt-PA), which must be administered no later than 4.5 h
after onset of symptoms – a very narrow therapeutic
window (Hacke et al., 2008; Wahlgren et al., 2008).
Inﬂammatory response has a critical role in brain tissue
damage after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury (Muir et al.,
2007; Brea et al., 2009; Lakhan et al., 2009; Tuttolomondo
et al., 2009; Gronberg et al., 2013). Several studies have
shown that an attenuation of the inﬂammatory process
could be a possible way to widen the therapeutic window
(Iadecola and Alexander, 2001; Yilmaz et al., 2006). Neutrophils (Matsuo et al., 1995; Satoh et al., 1999) and macrophages/microglia (Campanella et al., 2002) have been
regarded as the main players in post-ischemic infarction.
However, recent reports have shown that T lymphocytes
also have an impact on tissue damage (Baird, 2006;
Yilmaz et al., 2006; Kleinschnitz et al., 2010; Brait et al.,
2012). Recent reports and our research have tested that
interleukin (IL)-17A (IL-17A) secreted by cd T cell is implicated in the pathogenesis of brain, myocardial and intestinal I/R injury (Shichita et al., 2009; Liao et al., 2012; Lee
et al., 2013). In brain I/R injury, it has been found that
depletion of cd T cells reduces brain injury post-ischemia
and reperfusion, and that cd T cells are a major source
of IL-17A (Shichita et al., 2009; Gelderblom et al., 2012).
IL-17A plays an important role in neutrophil inﬁltration
and neuronal damage. IL-17A-blocking treatment in acute
phase of stroke could decrease infarct size and improved
neurologic outcome in the murine model (Gelderblom
et al., 2012). In autoptic brain tissue of patients who had
a stroke, IL-17A-positive lymphocytes were also detected
(Gelderblom et al., 2012). All these data suggested that
targeting of IL-17A-related signaling might reduce the
acute inﬂammatory response and tissue damage in

cerebral ischemia. However, the pathway that led to the
neuronal damage of IL-17A is still largely unknown.
Although it is known that IL-17A elicits neuronal
damage in brain I/R injury, the exact downstream
mechanisms of IL-17A are not clear. Our previous
studies and other in vitro and in vivo reports have
shown that the calpain-transient receptor potential
canonical (subtype) 6 (TRPC6) signaling pathway
closely correlates with neuronal damage in ischemic
stroke (Jia et al., 2007; Du et al., 2010; Lin et al.,
2013a,b). An acute release of glutamate results in
increased calcium inﬂux which was regarded as the main
cause of the pathologic activation of calpain in cerebral
ischemia. But in another neurodegenerative disease multiple sclerosis (MS), T lymphocytes activation is the main
cause of the pathologic activation of calpain (Vosler et al.,
2008). More and more evidence suggests that T-cell activation especially IL-17A secretion is also complicated in
the neuronal damage of brain I/R, so we speculate that
IL-17A may be another important cause of activation of
calpain and then leads to the proteolysis of TRPC6 and,
accordingly, acceleration of the cerebral I/R injury.
To gain a better insight into the mechanism by which
IL-17A aggravates brain I/R injury, we investigated the
relationships between IL-17A and calpain-TRPC6
pathway in a mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia. In
the present study, we show that IL-17A promotes brain
I/R injury through the increase of calpain-mediated
TRPC6 proteolysis.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
All experiments and procedures were approved by the
committee of experimental animals of Tongji Medical
College. Male C57BL/6 mice (wild-type) (8–10-week old,
23–25 g) were purchased from Wuhan University
Laboratory Animal Center. Male IL-17A knockout
(II-17a/) mice in a C57BL/6 background were kindly
provided by Y. Iwakura (University of Tokyo, Tokyo,
Japan) as described previously (Nakae et al., 2002). All
experimental protocols and animal handling procedures
were performed in accordance with the National Institute
of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory

Animals (NIH Publications No. 80–23) revised 1996 and
the experimental protocols were approved by the committee of experimental animals of Tongji Medical College.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of
focal ischemia
The animals were maintained at temperature of 23 ± 1 °C
with 50 ± 10% relative humidity in the Experimental
Animal Center. Mice were allowed free access to food
and water in a 12-h light/dark cycle. Focal cerebral
ischemia was induced by transient occlusion of the right
middle cerebral artery (tMCAO) with a 6–0 siliconecoated nylon monoﬁlament, as previously described
(Hata et al., 1998). Anesthesia was induced with ketamine
(100 mg/kg, i.p.) and xylazine (8 mg/kg, i.p.). Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by transient occlusion of the
right middle cerebral artery (tMCAO) with a 6–0 siliconecoated nylon monoﬁlament. Brieﬂy, under the operating
microscope, the right common carotid artery (CCA), the
right external carotid artery (ECA), and the right internal
carotid artery (ICA) were isolated and a 6–0 suture was
tied at the origin of the ECA and at the distal end of the
ECA. The right CCA and ICA were temporarily occluded.
The silicon-coated nylon suture was introduced into the
ECA and pushed up the ICA until resistance was felt and
the ﬁlament was inserted about 9–10 mm from the carotid
bifurcation, eﬀectively blocking the middle cerebral artery
(MCA). The diameter of the tip of coated suture was considered acceptable between 180 and 220 lm. The suture
remained inserted for 60 min, after which it was removed
and the ECA was permanently tied. In the sham controls,
the arteries were visualized but not disturbed. Cerebral
blood ﬂow was monitored throughout the procedure by
laser-Doppler ﬂowmeter (Periﬂux system 5000, PERIMED, Stockholm, Sweden). Body temperature was
maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C during and after the surgery
with a heating pad. During these experiments, blood
pressure (BP) was monitored through a femoral artery
and blood gas was analyzed at the end (i.e. 3 days after
tMCAO or sham procedure). Subcutaneous normal saline
(0.9%) was administered daily, adjusting the volume
according to animal’s weight loss. The number of animals
used for each experimental group is provided in the ﬁgure
legends and summarized in Table 1.

For the measurement of IL-17A expression patterns,
C57BL/6 mice were subject to sham or 60-min ischemia
followed by 1-, 3-, and 6-day reperfusion.
In addition, C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into 9
groups: (1) sham group (Sham); (2) Cerebral I/R group
(I/R) (60min ischemia followed by 3-day reperfusion); (3)
anti-IL-17A treatment group: mice were injected
intravenously with 500-lg anti-IL-17A neutralized
monoclonal antibody (mAb) (eBioscience, clone
eBioMM17F3, lgG1, San Diego, CA) or 500-lg mouse
IgG1 isotype control mAb (eBioscience) 5 min prior to
reperfusion; (4–6) recombinant mouse-IL-17A (rIL-17A)
treatment group at 3 doses: mice were injected
intravenously with 1-, 2-, or 3-lg rIL-17A diluted in PBS
containing 0.1% albumin (R&D System, Minneapolis,
MN) 5 min prior to reperfusion; (7) calpeptin treatment
group: calpeptin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) with
10 lg (dissolved in 2 ll 10% DMSO) or 2 ll 10% DMSO
was injected intracerebroventricularly into the left lateral
ventricle (0.9 mm laterally, 0.1 mm posteriorly, 3.1 mm
deep from the bregma) using a Hamilton syringe
(Hamilton Company, Bonaduz, Switzerland) at 1, 24 and
48 h after MCAO; (8 and 9) calpeptin and rIL-17A
treatment group: mice were injected intravenously with
2- or 3-lg rIL-17A 5 min prior to reperfusion, and then
received intracerebroventricle (ICV) injection of calpeptin
at 1, 24 and 48 h after MCAO.
Male Il17a–/– mice (n = 9) were also subject to 60-min
ischemia followed by 3-day reperfusion.
Neurological scoring
Neurological scores were evaluated with a scoring system
(Garcia et al., 1995) by a blinded observer. An 18-point
scoring system was used to evaluate the sensorimotor
deﬁcits. The scale was based on the following six tests:
(1) spontaneous activity (0–3 points); (2) symmetry in
the movement of four limbs (0–3 points); (3) forepaw
outstretching (0–3 points); (4) climbing (1–3 points); (5)
body proprioception (1–3 points); and (6) response to
vibrissae touch (1–3 points). The six individual test scores
were summed up at the end of the evaluation (minimum
score, 3; maximum score, 18).

Total RNA was isolated using Trizol Regent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). cDNA was synthesized from total RNA
with Taqman reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). IL-17A, CXCL-1 and b-actin cDNA were
ampliﬁed using Power SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). Two-step real-time PCR was performed
(95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 60-s extension and detection,
40 cycles) with speciﬁc primers for IL-17A (forward: 50 -TG
TGAAGGTCAACCTCAAAGTCT-30 ; reverse: 50 -GAGGG
ATATCTATCAGG GTCTTCAT-30 ), CXCL-1 (forward:
50 -CCGAAGTCATAGCCACACTCA-30 ; reverse: 50 -CAAGG
GAGCTTCAGGGTCAA-30 ) and b-actin (forward: 50 -AAG
GCCAACCGTGAAAAGAT-30 ; reverse: 50 -GTGGTACGA
CCAGAGGCATAC-30 ). The relative quantitation value is
expressed as 2–DCt, where DCt is the diﬀerence between
the mean DCt value of duplicate measurements of the
sample and b-actin control.
Western blotting
Total protein extraction from the penumbra of the stroke
was performed according to a commercially available kit
(KGP250; Nanjing Keygen Biotech Co. Ltd., Nanjing,
China). Equal amounts of total protein extracts were
separated by SDS–PAGE and transferred to
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes (Millipore) by
electrophoresis, and membranes were blocked with 5%
nonfat milk in TBST (0.1% Tween 20 in TBS) for 1 h at
room temperature. Membranes were then incubated
overnight at 4 °C with either anti-IL-17A (1:500; Abclonal,
Shanghai, China), anti-aII-spectrin (1:1,000; Enzo Life
Sciences, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA), anti-TRPC6
(1:1,000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti–b-actin (1:2000;
Santa Cruz, CA, USA) followed by horse radish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
antibody (1:3000; Proteintech Group, Inc., Wuhan,
Hubei, China) or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:3000;
Proteintech Group, Inc., Wuhan, Hubei, China). Labeled
proteins were detected with the ChemiDocXRS +
chemiluminescence imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA). Protein bands were quantiﬁed by Image Lab
image acquisition and analysis software.

Measurement of infarct volume

Statistical analysis

Brains were removed 3 days after reperfusion and mildly
frozen at 20 °C for 10 min to keep the morphology
intact during slicing. In brief, brains were sliced into 5
serial 1-mm coronal sections and incubated in a 2%
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Amresco,
Solon, OH, USA) for 15 min at 37 °C and then
transferred into a 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate
buﬀer for ﬁxation at 4 °C. The extent of ischemic
infarction was traced and the integrated volume was
calculated using Image J software (NIH, USA). The
relative infarction volume was expressed as percentage
of the corrected infarct volume in the whole brain volume.

Multiple comparisons were performed by an ANOVA
followed by Newman–Keuls multiple comparison tests
for multiple comparisons. Two groups were compared
by student t test. The neurological score data
comparison
was
analyzed
using
Wilcoxon–
Mann–Whitney nonparametric test or Kruskal–Wallis
test followed by the post hoc Dunn’s test. Diﬀerences
were considered signiﬁcant at P < 0.05. Mean ± SEM
values are given throughout the text and ﬁgures.

Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) measurements of mRNA
RT-PCR was used to assess abundances of IL-17A,
CXCL-1 and b-actin mRNA in the penumbral brain tissue.

Systemic parameters including pH and blood gases were
all within normal range and there were no diﬀerences
among wild-type, II-17a/ mice (Table 2).

IL-17A increases after cerebral I/R injury
First, we sought to establish the time course of IL-17A in
the brain after transient focal ischemia. We found that
IL-17A messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and
protein expression increased signiﬁcantly 1 day after
reperfusion (P < 0.05 and P < 0.05, respectively),
peaked
at
3 days
(P < 0.01
and
P < 0.01,
respectively), and then began to decrease, although the
protein levels remained at a high level until 6 days after
I/R compared with the sham group (Fig. 1, P < 0.05,
n = 3/group).
Neutralization of endogenous IL-17A or IL-17A
knockout inhibits whereas repletion of exogenous
IL-17A activates the activity of calpain
To determine whether IL-17A directly activates calpain,
we treated the cerebral I/R mice systemically with
neutralizing anti-IL-17A mAb or rIL-17A before
reperfusion. Three days after reperfusion, rIL-17A
treatment signiﬁcantly increased the expression of
aII-spectrin breakdown products of 145 kDa (SBDP145)
(P < 0.05), whereas anti-IL-17A mAb or IL-17A
knockout reduced its expression (Fig. 2A, P < 0.05 and
P < 0.01, respectively, n = 8/group).

TRPC6 expression was increased in mice treated with
anti-IL-17A mAb (P < 0.01). The Il17a–/– mice also
showed a signiﬁcant increase in TRPC6 expression
after cerebral I/R (P < 0.01). However, rIL-17A (1 lg)
had no eﬀect on TRPC6 protein expression (Fig. 2B,
P > 0.05).
Three days after the ischemic attack, anti-IL-17A mAb
or IL-17A knockout markedly ameliorated I/R injury
(P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively) and increased
neurological
scores
(P < 0.05
and
P < 0.01,
respectively). However, treatment with rIL-17A (1 lg)
had no eﬀect on infarct size and neurological deﬁcits
(Fig. 3A and B, P > 0.05, n = 6/group).
To determine whether intravenous injection of rIL-17A
could access the CNS and contributed there, we detected
the eﬀect of 1-, 2- or 3-lg rIL-17A on the protein
expression of IL-17A in the penumbral area 3 days after
reperfusion. IL-17A level was signiﬁcantly increased in
2- or 3-lg rIL-17A-treated mice compared with vehicletreated mice (Fig. 4A, P < 0.05 and P < 0.05,
respectively, n = 3/group). In addition, Dr. Gelderblom
has shown that il-17ra/ mice or IL-17A-blocking
antibody-treated mice showed reduced levels of CXCL1, a neutrophil chemoattractant (Gelderblom et al.,
2012). So we detected the gene expression of CXCL-1

times (n = 3/group). IL-17A messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expression peaked at 3 days after reperfusion. d: days; I/R: ischemia–

and TRPC6 (B) were tested by western blotting in the penumbral area (n = 3/group). rIL-17A treatment signiﬁcantly increased the expression of
SBDP145, whereas anti-IL-17A mAb or IL-17A knockout reduced its expression. In contrast, TRPC6 expression was increased in mice treated with
anti-IL-17A mAb (P < 0.01). Anti-IL-17A mAb or IL-17A knockout signiﬁcantly increased the levels of TRPC6. However, rIL-17A (1 lg) had no eﬀect

were tested by western blotting 3 days after reperfusion (n = 3/group). Application of 2- or 3-lg rIL-17A signiﬁcantly increased the level of IL-17A.
(B) The eﬀects of intravenous injection of 1-, 2- or 3-lg rIL-17A on the gene expression of CXCL-1 in the penumbral area were tested by real-time
PCR 3 days after reperfusion (n = 4/group). Application of 2- or 3-lg rIL-17A signiﬁcantly increased the gene expression of CXCL-1. Data are
presented as mean ± SEM. #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01 compared with vehicle group.

to indirectly clarify whether rIL-17A treatment could
increase the expression of IL-17A in CNS. In our experiment, the gene expression of CXCL-1 was signiﬁcantly
increased in 1-, 2- or 3-lg rIL-17A-treated mice compared
with vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 4B, P < 0.05, P < 0.01
and P < 0.01, respectively, n = 4/group). So we think
that rIL-17A could access the CNS and contribute there.
As expected, 2- or 3-lg rIL-17A led to a signiﬁcant
reduction in TRPC6 expression (Fig. 5A, P < 0.05 and
P < 0.05, respectively, n = 3/group). Interestingly, 2- or
3-lg rIL-17A treatment signiﬁcantly increased infarct
size (P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively) and
decreased neurological scores 3 days after reperfusion
(Fig. 5B and C, P < 0.05 and P < 0.05, respectively).

expression compared to vehicle-treated mice after
cerebral I/R (Fig. 6A, P > 0.05).
As expected, calpeptin treatment showed a signiﬁcant
increase in TRPC6 expression 3 days after reperfusion
(P < 0.05). However, in the presence of calpeptin, 2- or
3-lg rIL-17A administration also had no eﬀect on
TRPC6 expression compared to vehicle-treated mice
after cerebral I/R (Fig. 6B, P > 0.05).
Calpeptin treatment led to a signiﬁcant reduction in
infarct size (P < 0.01) and neurological deﬁcits 3 days
after reperfusion (P < 0.05). 2- or 3-lg rIL-17A
treatment had no eﬀect on I/R injury in calpeptin-treated
mice (Fig. 6C and D, P > 0.05).

DISCUSSION
IL-17A increased calpain-mediated TRPC6 channel
degradation and induced cerebral I/R injury
To further determine whether IL-17A induced cerebral I/R
injury via calpain-mediated TRPC6 channel degradation,
calpain-speciﬁc inhibitor calpeptin was administrated.
ICV injection of calpeptin signiﬁcantly decreased the
expression of SBDP145 3 days after reperfusion
(P < 0.05). In the presence of calpeptin, 2- or 3-lg
rIL-17A administration had no eﬀect on SBDP145

Stroke is the most frequent cause of permanent disability
in adults worldwide (Donnan et al., 2008). Previous
studies have demonstrated that brain ischemic injury secondary to arterial occlusion is characterized by acute local
inﬂammation. During reperfusion after acute ischemia,
neutrophils are believed to exacerbate tissue damage
by both physical obstruction of vessels and release of
oxygen radicals, proinﬂammatory cytokines, and cytolytic
enzymes (Kostulas et al., 1999; Tuttolomondo et al.,

2009; Gronberg et al., 2013). Recent reports have
provided evidence that IL-17A has been found to play
an important role in the neutrophil inﬁltration and neuronal
damage (Shichita et al., 2009; Gelderblom et al., 2012).
Interleukin (IL)-17A is a member of the IL-17 family,
which includes six structurally related isoforms: IL-17A,
IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E, and IL-17F (Kolls and
Linden, 2004). Multiple cell types, including CD4+ ab T
cells, cd T cells, natural killer cells, and neutrophils,
produce IL-17A (Roark et al., 2008). IL-17A was predominantly produced by cd T cells rather than CD4+ or CD8+
T cells inﬁltrated into the penumbra of the stroke (Shichita
et al., 2009; Gelderblom et al., 2012). Increasing evidence
indicates that IL-17A does play a key role in the inﬂammation after cerebral I/R injury. IL-17 contributes to cerebral
I/R injury by inducing neutrophil inﬁltration and amplifying
the production of neurotoxic factors (Shichita et al., 2009;
Gelderblom et al., 2012). In this study, we found that the
gene and protein expression of IL-17A peaked 3 days
after stroke, consistent with previous descriptions
(Gelderblom
et
al.,
2012).
So
we
chose
3-day time point for our further study on the mechanism
of IL-17A-induced cerebral I/R injury. The dosage and
route of anti-IL-17A neutralized mAb administration were
chosen according to a previous study (Gelderblom
et al., 2012). In that study, the reduced neutrophil inﬁltration in il-17ra/ mice and in mice treated with neutralizing
antibodies was not due to reduced neutrophil levels in the
blood, since relative neutrophil counts three days after
stroke did not diﬀer between groups. Whereas
anti-IL-17A antibodies were given intravenously as a
single application after stroke, the neutrophil inﬁltration

in the brain was greatly reduced three days following
stroke. So we think that blocking eﬀect of anti-IL-17A antibody could act in the CNS. In our study, we found that
anti–IL-17A monoclonal antibody treatment or IL-17A
knockout markedly ameliorated cerebral I/R injury, which
is in agreement with previous descriptions (Gelderblom
et al., 2012). In our study, intravenous injection of 1-lg
rIL-17A had no eﬀect on cerebral I/R injury. However,
2- or 3-lg rIL-17A signiﬁcantly increased I/R injury. Our
further results showed that intravenous injection of 1-lg
rIL-17A had no eﬀect on the protein level of IL-17A in
the penumbral area 3 days after reperfusion. 2- or 3-lg
rIL-17A signiﬁcantly increased the protein expression of
IL-17A and gene expression of CXCL-1. In addition,
one previous study has shown that il-17ra/ mice or
IL-17A-blocking antibody-treated mice showed reduced
levels of CXCL-1, a chemokine, that mainly recruits
neutrophils (Gelderblom et al., 2012). So we detected
the gene expression of CXCL-1 to indirectly determine
whether intravenous injection of rIL-17A could increase
the expression of IL-17A in the CNS. Our results showed
that 2- or 3-lg rIL-17A signiﬁcantly increased the gene
expression of CXCL-1. Therefore, we think that intravenous injection of rIL-17A could access the CNS. However,
peripheral eﬀects of IL-17A cannot be fully excluded.
To explore the downstream eﬀect of IL-17A in
ischemic brain, the role of IL-17A in the activation of
calpain was examined by evaluating calpain activity.
The intension of calpain activation is reﬂected by the
protein levels of calpain-speciﬁc SBDP145. aII-spectrin
is an abundant cytoskeletal protein that is speciﬁcally
cleaved by calpains into 150/145-kDa fragments.

to vehicle-treated mice. (B) The eﬀects of calpain inhibitor calpeptin on the expression level of TRPC6 (n = 3/group). ICV injection of calpeptin
signiﬁcantly increased the expression of TRPC6 following MCAO in mice. In the presence of calpeptin, 2- or 3-lg rIL-17A administration had no
eﬀect on TRPC6 expression compared to vehicle-treated mice. Infarct volumes (C) and neurological deﬁcits (D) were examined (n = 6). Calpeptin
treatment signiﬁcantly decreased stroke severity when measured at 3 days following stroke. In the presence of calpeptin, 2- or 3-lg rIL-17A
administration had no eﬀect on stroke severity. I/R: ischemia–reperfusion group. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. ⁄P < 0.05 compared with
sham group. #P < 0.05 and ##P < 0.01.

SBDP145 results from sequential calpain cleavage of aIIspectrin to generate SBDP150, followed by cleavage to
remove an additional 5 kDa (Nath et al., 1996; Wang,
2000). The activation of calpain leads to proteolysis of
transient receptor potential canonical (subtype) 6
(TRPC6) channels in stroke (Du et al., 2010). Previous
in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that
TRPC6 channels play a critical role in promoting neuronal
survival against acute ischemic stroke (Jia et al., 2007; Du
et al., 2010). Calpain-mediated proteolysis of TRPC6 contributes to ischemic neuronal cell death, and suppression
of calpain activity inhibits TRPC6 degradation and could
prevent ischemic brain damage (Jia et al., 2007; Du
et al., 2010). Here, we showed that calpeptin, a calpain
inhibitor, induced a signiﬁcant increase in TRPC6 expression, decreased infarct size and improved neurological
outcome. Interestingly, 2- or 3-lg rIL-17A treatment had
no eﬀect on TRPC6 expression in calpeptin-treated mice,
indicating that TRPC6 channels in neurons were
speciﬁcally downregulated by calpain proteolysis in ischemia, and calpain-mediated downregulation of TRPC6

contributes to ischemic brain injury. Our data showed that
IL-17A could promote brain I/R injury through the increase
of calpain-mediated TRPC6 proteolysis.
Calpain is a ubiquitous calcium-sensitive protease
that is essential for normal physiologic neuronal
function. In acute neurodegenerations especially
cerebral ischemia, uncontrolled release of glutamate
results in increased calcium inﬂux and then causes the
pathologic activation of calpain (Vosler et al., 2008). In
immune-related neurodegenerations such as MS, T-cell
activation is the main cause of the pathologic activation
of calpain. We speculated that IL-17A, a classic cytokine
that reﬂects immune cell activation and contributes to
neuronal damage in stroke may stimulate calpain. Our
results testiﬁed the hypothesis, anti–IL-17A monoclonal
antibody treatment or IL-17A knockout signiﬁcantly
reduced the activation of calpain and increased the
expression of TRPC6; however, rIL-17A treatment
conferred the opposite eﬀect. Preliminary results suggest
that TRPC6 channels play a critical role in promoting
neuronal survival against ischemic stroke. TRPC6

J. Zhang et al. / Neuroscience 274 (2014) 419–428

proteolysis contributed to ischemic neuronal cell death,
and suppression of its degradation preserved neuronal
survival and prevented ischemic brain damage (Jia
et al., 2007; Du et al., 2010). Thus, we found for the ﬁrst
time a previously unrecognized mechanistic role of IL-17A
in the activation of calpain and subsequent proteolysis of
TRPC6, which leads to greater understanding of the
detrimental mechanisms of IL-17A in ischemic stroke.

CONCLUSION
Our results provide a better insight into the mechanism by
which IL-17A aggravates brain I/R injury and identiﬁes a
previously unrecognized mechanism of IL-17A in brain
I/R injury. In this mechanism, IL-17A may promote brain
I/R injury through the increase of calpain-mediated
TRPC6 proteolysis. Calpain-TRPC6 pathway is a key
point in controlling IL-17A-induced brain I/R injury. It
may lead to the development of diﬀerent forms of
treatment in brain I/R injury.
