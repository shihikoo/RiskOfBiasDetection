Characterization of functional outcome in animal stroke models is essential to improve preclinical drug
screenings. Operant procedures showed promising results for the identiﬁcation of long-lasting functional
deﬁcits. In particular, a suppression of lever-pressing in high ratio schedules has been consistently found
in rodent models of ischemic stroke. In the present work, we attempted to replicate these isolated observations, by submitting C57Bl/6J mice to a progressive ﬁxed-ratio schedule of reinforcement three weeks
after MCAO or sham surgery. Results showed a signiﬁcant lever-pressing impairment in the MCAO group.
Motivational factors (longer post-reinforcement pause, lesser appeal for food rewards) seemed accountable for the deﬁcit, while motor abilities appeared preserved. These ﬁndings resemble fatigue-like states
experienced by stroke survivors and may be used as long-term measures of behavioral outcome following
experimental stroke.

Albeit stroke remains a major cause of mortality and disability in industrialized countries, preclinical research failed to design
neuroprotective therapies which would cross the bench-to-bedside
barrier [1]. Recently, ﬁeld experts suggested that improving functional assessment of animal stroke models might help screening
efﬁcient therapies by focusing on the reduction of day-to-day
functional impairments in stroke victims [2,3]. At the moment,
functional testing rarely addresses impairments beyond sensory
or motor abilities, neglecting cognitive and affective disturbances
that may result from ischemic stroke as well.
Operant conditioning has not frequently been used to characterize behavioral deﬁcits after experimental ischemia. To date,
only a few studies have reported using basic operant techniques

to examine functional outcome in experimental stroke models.
One of the most consistent ﬁnding in these studies is a drop in
the rates of response (number of operant responses per unit of
time) following cerebral ischemia in rodents. Following a 60 or
120 min left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), rats which
were submitted to a ﬁxed-ratio (FR) schedule failed to demonstrate a rate of response comparable to sham controls [4]. Similar
results were obtained in our lab with 129/S2 mice in a progressively incremented FR schedule (FR5 to FR30) three months after
a 60 min MCAO (unpublished results). Contradictory results however pointed that in a similar schedule (FR3 to FR10), rats exposed
to MCAO surgery were as efﬁcient as sham controls. In that particular study, a four seconds delay between the reinforced lever-press
and the reward delivery may have constitute an important methodological discrepancy explaining the absence of difference between
MCAO and control groups [5]. In the peak procedure (an operant task typically inducing a peak of lever-presses centered on
the critical reinforced duration), 129/S2 mice which underwent a

J. Linden et al. / Behavioural Brain Research 279 (2015) 82–86

60 min MCAO displayed a weaker rate of response comparatively to
sham control [6]. Contradictory results however pointed that in
either a FR3 or a FR10 schedule, rats exposed to a 90 min or 120 min
MCAO were obtained as much rewards as sham controls. In that
particular study, a 4 s delay between the reinforced lever-press and
the reward delivery may have constitute an important methodological discrepancy explaining the absence of differences between
MCAO and control groups [5]. Finally, global ischemia induced
by a four vessels occlusion resulted in a transient suppression of
response rate in a FR20 and in a ﬁxed-interval schedule. There is
no evidence the latter ﬁnding have a common cause with those
observed after MCAO, as the two models evoked very distinct histological outcome [7]. Taken together, these results indicate that
highly-demanding operant schedules might reveal long-lasting
impairments in rodent stroke models. Nonetheless, it is not clear
whether this effect is due to an altered motivation to perform effortful tasks, to a motor deﬁcit hindering fast-paced pressing or to any
other reason.
Our ﬁrst aim here was to replicate these isolated observations.
Following transient MCAO (30 min), C57Bl/6J mice were submitted
to a progressive FR schedule of reinforcement (a classic operant training during which the ratio was incremented from day to
day). Additionally, in an attempt to untangle the causes behind a
potential suppression of lever-pressing, we also examined several
task-related motor and motivational indexes.
All experimental treatments and animal maintenance were
reviewed by the Animal Care and Experimentation Committee of
the Université de Liège. The Animal Care and Experimentation Committee gave its approval according to the Belgian implementation of
the animal welfare guidelines laid down by the European Community (EEC Council Directive No. 86/609 of the 24 November 1986;
Directive for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and other Scientiﬁc Purposes).
Thirteen male C57Bl6/J mice (8–10 weeks) were submitted to a
30 min right intraluminal MCAO as described previously [8]. Brieﬂy,
under 2% isoﬂurane anesthesia (Isoﬂo, Abbot, IL, USA), the right
common and internal carotid arteries were carefully dissected. A
0.20 mm diameter silicon-coated monoﬁlament (Doccol Corporation, CA, USA) was inserted and pushed through the lumen. After
30 min, the mouse was anaesthetized again and the monoﬁlament
was withdrawn. Eleven sham-operated mice were used as control. Following surgery, the animals’ weight was closely monitored,
palatable food was provided in the home cages enroﬂoxacin (Baytril
2.5%, Bayer, Germany) was diluted in water bottles (0.35 mg/ml) to
prevent severe weight loss and infection.
Three weeks after surgery, mice were submitted to a progressive FR schedule of reinforcement. The procedure took place in ﬁve
operant chambers (ENV-307 W, Med Associates Inc., VT, USA), each
ﬁtted with two retractable levers, a pellet dispenser and a foodtray. For the duration of operant training, mice were maintained
around 85% of their average weight. Animals were ﬁrst trained
to operate a lever to obtain food pellets (20 mg Noyes Precision
pellets, Research Diets, New Brunswick, Canada) in a FR1. Both
levers were active all along the session. These sessions terminated
after 60 min or when the mice obtained 20 rewards (whichever
happened ﬁrst). Acquisition training lasted until 20 lever-presses
had been produced in two consecutive sessions. The number of
acquisition sessions was taken as an index of general learning. The
progressive FR schedule of reinforcement began four weeks after
surgery. All mice underwent ﬁve sessions (one per day). When a
session started, both levers were presented, and remained available for the entire session. During the ﬁrst session, a food pellet was
delivered after every ﬁve presses (FR5). The ratio (i.e., the number
of response required to obtain a reward) was progressively incremented – respectively FR10, FR15, FR20 and FR30 – so the mice had
to perform each day a greater number of lever-presses to obtain the

83

same quantity of food. A session ended when an animal obtained
50 food pellets, or after 40 min (whichever happened ﬁrst).
Two general indexes of performance were computed: the press
rate (number of presses per minute), reﬂecting the effort exerted by
animals, and the reinforcement rate (number of rewards obtained
per minute), characterizing the efﬁciency with which animals managed to earn food rewards. The motor aspect was assessed by calculating the mean inter-response time (IRT) within response bursts
(uninterrupted lever-pressing sequences). Regarding motivational
factors, we computed the mean duration of post-reinforcement
pause (PRP; the delay between the delivery of a reward and the
moment an animal resume lever-pressing), the mean latency to
collect food rewards and the total count of foraging behaviors (foodtray visits). Finally, foraging was analyzed by counting the mean
number of food-tray visits by trials, comparing within-trial (before
reaching the ratio) and between trials visits (between the reward
delivery and the next attempt to reach the ratio).
All data were treated using a mixed-model analysis of variance
(ANOVA). The mean latencies to collect rewards as well as the
mean number of within-ratio and between ratio food-tray visits
were respectively treated with a square root and a logarithmic
transformation. Post hoc comparisons were realized using the
Newman–Keuls test. The Statistica software (Statsoft) was used
for all analyses.
On week 5, immunohistochemical analysis was conducted
as described previously [8]. Mice were transcardially perfused
with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma–Aldrich, USA) under deep
anesthesia. Brains were post-ﬁxated in PFA, and then plunged in
a 20% sucrose solution. 50 ␮m thick sections were immerged in
3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma–Aldrich) and 0.1% Triton X-100
in PBS, before being incubated overnight with primary mouse
anti-NeuN antibodies (1:1000; Chemicon International, USA).
Following incubation in the secondary horse anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with biotin (1:400; Chemicon International),
the reaction was ampliﬁed using an avidin-biotin-peroxidase
complex kit (VectaShield, Vector Laboratories, USA). Finally,
3,3 -diaminobenzidine (Sigma–Aldrich) was used as chromogen.
Lesion volumes were determined by multiplying the surface of
infarcted brain tissue (after correction for edema) by the space
separating two consecutives sections.
Animals in the MCAO group took on average 2.79 ± 0.32 sessions to reach the criterion, while sham-operated mice needed
2.18 ± 0.12 sessions. According to the Mann–Whitney’s U test,
MCAO mice did not necessitate more sessions to acquire the operant response (U = 53; p = 0.297), thus discarding the possibility of a
severe learning impairment.
A 2 × 5 ANOVA applied to the press rate revealed a signiﬁcant group main effect (F(1, 22) = 21.519; p < 0.001), a ratio
main effect (F(4, 88) = 65.590; p < 0.001) and a signiﬁcant interaction between the two factors (F(4,88) = 7.58; p < 0.001). More
speciﬁcally, a post hoc Newman-Keuls test reported a signiﬁcantly higher amount of lever-presses per minute from FR10 to
FR30 (all p < 0.05; Fig. 1A). The reinforcement rate was analyzed
with a 2 × 5 ANOVA which revealed a signiﬁcant main effect of
group (F(1, 22) = 17.405; p < 0.001) and a signiﬁcant main effect
of ratio (F(4,88) = 28.825; p < 0.001), while the interaction was
non-signiﬁcant (F(4, 88) = 0.839; p = 0.504). The Newman–Keuls
comparison showed that sham mice obtained more rewards per
minute than MCAO for every ratio (all p < 0.05; Fig. 1B). Both thus
results pointed to a sizeable lever-pressing impairment (especially for large ratios). The possible causes behind this impairment
would be subsequently explored with the following motor and
motivation-related indexes.
Rodents in high ratio schedules typically emit bursts of rapid
lever-presses. We thus computed the average IRT within response
bursts in order to assess the ability to carry out a fast-paced

Fig. 1. (A) Press rate. The MCAO group produced less presses per minute than sham controls. Except for the FR5, the press rate was signiﬁcantly lower in the MCAO group
for all ratios (all p < 0.05). (B) Reinforcement rate. The MCAO group obtained less food rewards than sham for all sessions (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

lever-pressing task. The within-burst IRT were similar between
groups, as shown by a 2 × 5 ANOVA (F(1, 22) = 113.908; p = 0.917)
and both groups increased the pressing pace along training,
as shown by a signiﬁcant ratio main effect (F(4, 88) = 19.252;
p < 0.001), while the group × session interaction remained statistically non-signiﬁcant (F(4, 88) = 1.199; p = 0.317; Fig. 1A). It is well
known that focal cerebral ischemia may elicits numerous motor
deﬁcits [2,9] and it is possible that discrete MCAO-related motor
impairments interferes (at least minimally) in a lever-pressing
test, but in the present testing conditions they do not seem to
affect the ability to execute a fast-paced lever-pressing task.
Secondly, we examined motivation-related indexes that may
be directly linked to the performance in a progressive FR schedule. The PRP allegedly reﬂect the perception of the upcoming work
requirement: the more the animal perceive a task as effortful, the
longer the PRP will be [10]. The 2 × 5 ANOVA yielded a signiﬁcant
group main effect (F(1, 22) = 19.43; p < 0.001), a main effect of ratio
(F(4, 88) = 4.51; p = 0.003) but no signiﬁcant interaction between
the two factors (F(4, 88) = 0.164; p = 0.956). As expected, PRP were
signiﬁcantly longer for the highest ratios (the Newman–Keuls test
yielded differences between the FR30 and the FR5, FR10 and FR15,
with all p < 0.05). More importantly, the Newman–Keuls test conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant difference between MCAO and sham groups
for all ratios (all p < 0.05; see Fig. 2B). To determine whether food
rewards had a comparable appetitive value for MCAO and sham
animals, we measured the mean latency to collect the reward
once a ratio has been completed and the total number of foodtray visits (foraging behavior). A 2 × 5 ANOVA indicated both the
main effects of group and ratio were statistically signiﬁcant for the
latency to collect rewards (respectively F(1, 23) = 5.073; p = 0.034
and F(4, 92) = 3.247; p = 0.015) whereas the group × ratio interaction was not (F(4, 92) = 0.048; p = 0.468; see Fig. 2C). As mice in
the MCAO group were not as fast as sham-operated ones to collect their rewards, we cannot exclude any inﬂuence of cerebral
ischemia on the appetitive value of food rewards. Other studies reported a decreased preference for a sweetened solution,
suggesting a possible MCAO-induced anhedonia [11,12]. We also
considered the proclivity to visit the food-tray by counting the
total number of times mice explored the food-tray per session.
The 2 × 5 ANOVA indicated that neither the group main effect
(F(1, 22) = 0.769; p = 0.390), nor the ratio × group interaction (F(4,
88) = 0.683; p = 0.605) could be viewed as signiﬁcant. All mice
seemed to display more foraging behavior as ratio increased, as
demonstrated by a signiﬁcant ratio main affect F(4, 88) = 3.896;
p = 0.006). This second index pointed to a similar amount of foodrelated exploratory activity (Fig. 2D).
When comparing the mean number of within-trial and
between-trials food-tray visits, the 2 × 2 × 5 ANOVA yielded a signiﬁcant group main effect (F(1, 44) = 7.323; p = 0.010), a signiﬁcant

moment main effect (F(1, 44) = 32.425; p < 0.001) and a signiﬁcant
moment × session interaction (F(4, 176) = 11.730; p < 0.001); all
other interactions were not deemed signiﬁcant (all p > 0.05; Fig. 2E).
Foraging behaviors were not equally distributed across groups, and
MCAO mice more frequently interrupted lever-pressing to explore
the food-tray. Premature foraging has been shown to increase following striatal lesions in a progressive FR schedule [13]. Since the
MCAO mice otherwise expressed a normal food-related exploratory
activity, it is unlikely this ﬁnding result from an increased appetite
for food. Alternatively, it might be the consequence on an isolated
inhibition deﬁcit, as impulsive responding has been shown after
MCAO [5]. The analysis of foraging behavior provides supplementary evidence of behavioral perturbation consecutive to MCAO.
After completion of the operant task, we conducted histological analysis (anti-NeuN immunohistochemistry) to determine
infarct extent in the MCAO group. The mean infarct volume was
29.85 ± 1.288 mm3 . MCAO surgery elicited consistent ischemic
infarction of the dorsolateral and dorsomedial striatum in all mice,
while the ventral part of the striatum appeared as spared. Five
brains also exhibited consequent neuronal losses in primary and
secondary somatosensory cortices, as well as in the granular and
dysgranular insula, in the piriform cortex, and in the rostral part of
the hippocampus (Fig. 3).
Poor performance in demanding schedules is traditionally
observed in combination with lesions of the ventral striatum [15].
Here, we observed consistent damages in the dorsal striatum.
Human studies have shown the dorsal striatum play an important role when deciding to engage or not in an effortful strategy by
anticipatively encoding the amount of effort to produce (cost) and
comparing it with the expected rewards (beneﬁt) [16,17]. A mostly
striatal infarct might have disrupt cost/beneﬁt trade-off estimations, thus delaying the execution of a demanding task in MCAO
mice. However, once the appropriate response has been initiated,
its execution is under the control of the motor cortex and ventral
striatum, both appearing as preserved in our sample of MCAO animals [18]. The analysis of latencies to collect rewards however did
not rule out any inﬂuence of MCAO on the appeal of food reinforcer.
Regarding the high occurrence of premature foraging may suggest
deﬁcits of cognitive nature as well. Because this particular model
affects a brain territory that is central in many functional systems,
it is not surprising MCAO simultaneously alters multiple facets of
behavior.
The behavioral proﬁle of MCAO animals are reminiscent of poststroke symptoms identiﬁed in clinical practice. Depression is common in stroke victims and often comes with fatigue, a subjective
feeling of weariness and exertion that cannot be alleviated by rest.
Fatigue affects between 39 and 77% of patients and has a signiﬁcant
impact on their quality of life and the prospects of rehabilitation
[19]. Progressive FR schedules have been employed to characterize

efforts in rodents and could conversely be used to detect fatiguerelated impairments. If fatigue translates in mice as a reduced
incentive motivation, then similar protocols could be implemented
in preclinical stroke studies to investigate (and possibly alleviate)
mood-related disorders caused by cerebrovascular events.

Focal cerebral ischemia usually induces a wide range of motor
and sensory deﬁcits. Most of them however disappear over time,
compromising the identiﬁcation of long-term behavioral markers.
Here, the general performance and subtler task-speciﬁc indexes
were still signiﬁcantly impaired four weeks after MCAO. Therefore,

the use of operant procedures is justiﬁed to provide long-lasting
markers of functional impairments.
In summary, we report a strongly diminished performance in
a progressive FR schedule following transient MCAO in mice. We
suggest MCAO disrupted mechanisms weighing the cost and beneﬁt of a particular strategy, resulting in a decrease of motivation. The
present work thus provides evidence that simple and short operant
procedures may provide relevant and valid long-term markers of
functional impairment in rodent stroke models.
