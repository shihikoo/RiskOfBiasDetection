Following cerebral injuries such as stroke, a structural and functional reorganization of the impaired tissue occurs, which is often accompanied by a re-expression of developmental genes. During brain development, embryonic splice variants of the GABA-synthesizing GAD67 gene (collectively termed EGAD) participate in cell
proliferation, migration, and neuronal differentiation. We thus hypothesized an involvement of EGAD in postischemic plasticity. EGAD transcripts were up-regulated at early reperfusion times in the injured area following
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (with a peak expression of 4.5-fold at 6 h in C57BL/6 mice). Cellspeciﬁc analysis by a combination of radioactive in situ hybridization and immunolabeling revealed EGAD upregulation in TUNEL-positive neurons. This unexpected cell death-associated expression of EGAD was conﬁrmed
in cell culture models of ischemia (combined oxygen–glucose deprivation) and apoptosis (staurosporine).
Staurosporine-mediated cell death led to cleaved Caspase-3 activation, a key regulator of apoptosis following
stroke. Blocking of staurosporine-associated EGAD expression via antisense RNA treatment reduced cleaved
Caspase-3 activation by ~30%. In addition to the involvement of EGAD in proliferative processes during brain development, we found here that EGAD participates in cell death under pathophysiological conditions in the adult
brain. Re-expression of EGAD in neurons following stroke may play a role in aberrant cell cycle activation, consequently being pro-apoptotic. Our observation of a new GABA related pro-apoptotic mechanism and its successful
modiﬁcation might be of signiﬁcant clinical relevance.

Introduction
The expression of GAD67, one isoform of GABA synthesizing enzymes GAD, is developmentally regulated. In the embryonic brain, alternative transcripts of the GAD67 gene, I-80 and I-86 (collectively termed
EGAD), are mainly expressed in regions associated with cell proliferation and migration (Behar et al., 1994; Somogyi et al., 1995). Both I-80
and I-86 code for a short, enzymatically inactive GAD protein (GAD25)
with putative regulatory functions (Szabo et al., 1994). I-80 additionally
codes for an enzymatically active protein of 44 kDa (GAD44). Around
the time of birth, EGAD is down-regulated, whereas the expression of
adult GAD67 transcripts increases (Aggensteiner and Reiser, 2003;
Greif et al., 1991; Popp et al., 2009b). Although it is known that

GAD67 synthesizes GABA for general metabolic processes (for review
see Soghomonian and Martin, 1998), the functions of EGAD are currently unclear. However, a persistent expression of EGAD in regions of the
adult brain associated with neurogenesis and migration (subventricular
zone and rostral migratory stream) as well as with high synaptic plasticity (olfactory bulb) has been demonstrated by our group as well as by
others (Krizbai et al., 2000; Popp et al., 2009b).
Cerebral injuries like stroke and epilepsy result in adaptive processes
that contribute to the structural and functional reorganization of adjacent and remote brain tissue. Following focal cerebral ischemia, an increase in cell proliferation is observed in neurogenic niches. Newly
generated cells migrate to damaged areas where they differentiate
into mature neurons (for review see Kernie and Parent, 2010; Zhang
et al., 2005). Moreover, synaptic plasticity allows for the integration of
new neurons and promotes the rewiring of circuits in perilesional regions (for review see Murphy and Corbett, 2009). In line with our ﬁndings that EGAD is expressed in neurogenic niches as well as in regions of
high synaptic plasticity in the adult brain (Popp et al., 2009b), it is conceivable that EGAD participates in post-ischemic tissue reorganization.
Indeed, an ischemia-induced re-expression of developmental-speciﬁc
genes (e.g., nestin, MAP2c, and cyclin D1) which corroborates this assumption has been reported (Cramer and Chopp, 2000). Our hypothesis
is further supported by the fact that a re-expression of EGAD, followed
by an up-regulation of GAD67, has already been described in a model

In situ hybridization

of experimentally induced epileptic seizures (Szabo et al., 2000), which
can be interpreted as a mechanism of post-injury plasticity and neuronal protection.
The present study investigated the potential re-expression of EGAD
following transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rodents
and revealed a robust EGAD expression at early reperfusion times in
the ischemic hemisphere. Unexpectedly, EGAD expression was allocated to cells undergoing cell death. The cell death-related EGAD expression was conﬁrmed in in vitro cell culture models of ischemia and
apoptosis. Blocking of EGAD re-expression signiﬁcantly reduced cleaved
Caspase-3 activation a key regulator of apoptosis following stroke and
therefore revealed a new GABA related pro-apoptotic mechanism.

RISH was carried out according to Popp et al. (2009b) on rats
(n = 3). EGAD antisense oligonucleotide probes as well as their sense
controls (Popp et al., 2009b; Szabo et al., 2000) were 3′-end labeled
with [33P]-dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Hartmann Analytic GmbH). Frozen coronal rat brain sections (12-μm thickness) were ﬁxed, acetylated,
dehydrated, and air dried. Following hybridization for 18 h at 37 °C,
slides were washed, dehydrated, coated with Amersham Hypercoat
Emulsion LM-1 (GE Healthcare), and exposed for ~6 weeks. After development with Kodak D-19 Developer (Sigma-Aldrich), sections were
stained with thionine.

Materials and methods

Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining

Focal stroke model — transient MCAO

For triple staining, coronal rat brain cryostat sections were ﬁxed and
incubated in a blocking solution before the antibodies (rabbit anti-GFAP
1:500, Synaptic Systems; mouse anti-NeuN 1:500, Millipore) were applied in TBS containing 3% normal donkey serum and 0.2% Triton X-100
at 4 °C overnight. Sections were further processed using ﬂuorescencelabeled secondary antibodies (Rhodamine-donkey anti-rabbit, Cy5donkey anti-mouse, both 1:250; Molecular Probes/Invitrogen).
Subsequently, TUNEL staining was applied using the In Situ Cell Death
Detection Kit (Roche). Sections were analyzed via confocal laser scanning
microscopy (LSM 710; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH).
To combine RISH with immunohistochemistry or TUNEL staining,
sections were incubated with either NeuN or GFAP antibodies, or
TUNEL staining solution (as described above) before coating them
with the photographic emulsion. Sections were then analyzed microscopically (Axioskop; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH). Merged images
showing co-localization of the RISH signal with the ﬂuorescent signal
were produced using ImageJ (NIH). Quantiﬁcation of co-localized cells
was performed in four areas (0.2 mm2) within the ischemic region (striatum) taking 2 sections from 3 rats, respectively.

All animal procedures were approved by the local government
(Thueringer Landesamt, Bad Langensalza, Germany) and conformed to
international guidelines on the ethical use of animals. Transient MCAO
was induced in ~ 3-month-old, male Wistar rats and C57Bl/6 mice as
previously described in detail (Jaenisch et al., 2010; Sieber et al.,
2010). Brieﬂy, by introducing a monoﬁlament into the internal carotid
artery, the middle cerebral artery was unilaterally occluded. After
30 min, the suture was withdrawn to restore the blood ﬂow. Sham animals underwent the same surgical procedure as the treatment group,
except occlusion of the middle cerebral artery was omitted. Brains
were removed at various reperfusion times (2 h, 6 h, 1 d, 7 d).
qPCR following MCAO
Brains were removed following cervical dislocation and coronal sections within the ischemic area were dissected from the cerebrum using
a Precision Brain Slicer (Braintree Scientiﬁc, Inc.). Coronal sections including the infarct core (rats: +1.0 to −2.0 mm to bregma; mice: +0.8 to
− 1.2 mm to bregma) were separated into the ipsi- and contralateral
parts and snap frozen. Adjacent sections were used for validation of the
infarcts as previously described (Popp et al., 2009a; Sieber et al., 2010).
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Kit (Qiagen) and
quantiﬁed spectrometrically (ND-1000; NanoDrop). For qPCR experiments, total RNA was transcribed into cDNA using the RevertAid cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Fermentas) and then further processed in a 20-μl ampliﬁcation mixture containing Brilliant® II SYBR Green® qPCR Master Mix
(Stratagene), 5 μl cDNA (equivalent to 25 ng reverse transcribed RNA),
and 5 μl gene-speciﬁc primer mix (500 nmol/l). The qPCR was performed
on the Rotorgene 6000 (Corbett Life Science) using gene-speciﬁc primers
(Table 1, Jaenisch et al., 2010; Sieber et al., 2010). The relative expression
level of the ipsilateral vs. the contralateral hemisphere was calculated
using the Pfafﬂ equation and both Gapdh and Hmbs were used as reference genes (Pfafﬂ, 2001). Four individual rodents per reperfusion time
(2 h, 6 h, 24 h, 7 d) were analyzed (rats, n = 16; mice, n = 16).

Neurosphere culture
Isolation of subventricular cells for neurosphere culture was performed according to Berninger et al. (2007) with minor modiﬁcations.
The brains of 1-day-old C57Bl/6 mice were removed after cervical dislocation and the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle was dissociated in a
hyaluronic acid–trypsin solution (n = 3 per approach). After several
washing steps, cells (2.5 × 104/ml) were resuspended in neurosphere
medium (containing DMEM and Ham's F12, 1:1; Invitrogen), 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma), 1 × B27 supplement (Invitrogen), and
8 mmol/l HEPES (PAA) and seeded into cell culture ﬂasks. Growth factors were added (10 ng/ml EGF and bFGF; Biochrom) every 2nd day
to induce neurosphere formation. Neurospheres were passaged every
5th–6th day. To induce differentiation, 6-day-old neurospheres were
transferred into poly-D-lysine-coated cell culture plates containing
neurosphere medium without growth factors. Neurospheres that had
been differentiated for 6 d were used for all experiments. Data were obtained from at least three independent experiments (different preparations of tissue from the subventricular zone).
cOGD
The culture medium of differentiated neurospheres was replaced
with glucose-free DMEM and the initial medium was stored. Plates
were placed into a humidiﬁed chamber (MIC-101; Billups-Rothenberg,
Inc.) with subsequent application of an anaerobic gas mixture (95%
N2, 5% CO2). The chamber was then placed into an incubator at 37 °C.
After 2 h, cultures were removed from the chamber and the stored culture medium was re-added. At 2, 6, and 24 h of reperfusion, cells for
RNA isolation were collected in Qiazol (Qiagen).

STS treatment
Differentiated neurospheres were treated with STS to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1 μM (dissolved in 0.01% DMSO, which also served as control). At 2, 6, and 24 h after STS administration, cells for RNA isolation
were collected in Qiazol (Qiagen).
asEGAD treatment
asRNA for EGAD was added to cell culture ﬂasks immediately after
passaging to a ﬁnal concentration of 5 μM. When neurospheres were
transferred into poly-D-lysine-coated cell culture plates asEGAD
(5 μM) was added a second time. After 5–6 days STS was added to
differentiated neurospheres and 6 h after STS administration, cells
were collected in Qiazol (Qiagen) for RNA isolation or in lysis buffer
for protein isolation.
qPCR following cOGD and STS
Total RNA was isolated using phenol–chloroform and isopropyl alcohol precipitation. cDNA synthesis as well as qPCR analyses of EGAD and
GAD67 transcripts were performed as described above. Relative expression levels of treated samples (STS, cOGD) vs. controls were calculated
using the Pfafﬂ equation (Pfafﬂ, 2001).
Western blot analyses
Protein isolation and western blotting were performed as described
previously (Jaenisch et al., 2010). Equal amounts of protein (10 μg each)

239

obtained from differentiated neurospheres (mice, n = 5–6) were applied to a 15% SDS gel. Caspase-3 antibodies (8G10, Rabbit mAb, Cell Signaling Technology) detect the full-length (35 kDa) and large fragment
(17/19 kDa) of Caspase-3 resulting from cleavage at aspartic acid 175.
Protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence (Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate; Millipore) and subsequently
analyzed with the image acquisition system LAS 3000 (Fujiﬁlm) and
the AIDA Image Analyser Software (Raytest). Optical densities were
normalized to β-actin as a loading control. Here we exclusively quantiﬁed the activated form of Caspase-3, the 19 kDa length protein band.
TUNEL staining of cell cultures
Differentiated neurospheres treated with either cOGD or STS were
ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. TUNEL labeling was applied
and cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Cultures were analyzed
via confocal laser scanning microscopy. Quantiﬁcation of TUNEL staining was performed by analyzing the maximum intensity projection of
a z-stack using the co-localization tool of ZEN software (Carl Zeiss
MicroImaging GmbH). The relative area of TUNEL staining was calculated from the area of TUNEL signal co-localized with DAPI vs. the total
DAPI-stained area.
Statistical evaluation
qPCR data following MCAO are shown as geomean ± SEM of four individual rodents. Two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test
was performed to statistically analyze qPCR data. A value of P ≤ 0.05
was considered statistically signiﬁcant. Data from cell culture

(~ 5-fold) and GAD67 (~ 10-fold) vs. DMSO was found at 6 h
(Fig. 3A, n = 3 each). At 24 h, EGAD expression returned to control
levels, whereas GAD67 still showed an elevated expression (~2-fold).
Simultaneously, the TUNEL-stained area increased at 6 h and remained
elevated until 24 h of STS treatment (Fig. 3B, n = 3 each).

Results
EGAD expression is up-regulated in the ipsilateral hemisphere following
stroke
Following stroke, EGAD mRNA expression showed a signiﬁcant upregulation in the ischemic hemisphere at 2 h [3.10-fold (mice)], 6 h
[4.46-fold (mice) and 1.63-fold (rats)], and 1 d [1.96-fold (rats)] compared to sham-operated animals (Figs. 1A, B, n = 4 each). The overall
GAD67 mRNA expression was unchanged in the ischemic hemisphere
following MCAO (Figs. 1C, D). In sham-operated animals, EGAD and
GAD67 expression levels were unaltered at all investigated time points
(Figs. 1A–D, n = 4 each).
EGAD-positive cells are identiﬁed as dying neurons
The spatial expression of EGAD after stroke was analyzed by RISH.
EGAD-positive cells were detected in the injured area, which mainly included the ipsilateral striatum (Fig. 2A). Most of the labeled cells
showed an aberrant morphology, displaying well-known characteristics
of dying neurons. In the contralateral striatum, cells exhibited normal
morphology without an EGAD expression (Fig. 2A).
TUNEL-positive cells showed a similar distribution to that of EGAD
signals and, hence, were mainly found in the infarct core (Fig. 2B).
TUNEL and NeuN were largely co-localized. Few TUNEL+/NeuN− and
NeuN+/TUNEL−, but very few TUNEL+/GFAP+ cells were found
(Fig. 2B). Almost all EGAD-positive cells detected by RISH were colocalized with TUNEL staining (Fig. 2C). Quantitative analysis revealed
that 99% of EGAD-positive cells were TUNEL positive (53 ± 13
TUNEL+ cells out of 54 ± 14 EGAD+ cells, n = 3). In addition, 99% of
EGAD signals were found together with NeuN staining (48 ± 3
NeuN+ cells out of 48 ± 3 EGAD+ cells, n = 3), whereas 71% of all neurons in the ischemic striatum were found to re-express EGAD (48 ± 3
EGAD+ cells out of 68 ± 10 NeuN+ cells, n = 3). A co-localization of
EGAD with astrocytes could not be detected (Fig. 2C).
A mild stroke initiated by a 30 min occlusion of the MCA leads to a
large penumbral region characterized by the occurrence of apoptotic
neurons. The penumbra is spatially and above all timely restricted.
That means that at later reperfusion times penumbral apoptotic neurons either die (eventually build the infarct core) or survive and did
no longer express penumbral markers (Popp et al., 2009a). We here
found EGAD re-expression in TUNEL+ neurons in a region (striatum)
and at a time (one day of reperfusion) characteristic for the penumbra.
EGAD and GAD67 are up-regulated in in vitro models of ischemia (cOGD)
and apoptosis (STS)
Following cOGD, expression of both EGAD and GAD67 was increased by ~ 2-fold at 2 h post ischemia (Fig. 3A, n = 6 each). At
the same time, TUNEL staining increased (Fig. 3B). At 6 h after
cOGD, expression of EGAD and GAD67 declined to control levels
(Fig. 3A). Following STS administration, an up-regulation of EGAD

The efﬁcacy of asEGAD has been successfully proven in STS treated
cell cultures (6 h after STS application). Whereas EGAD transcript expression in vitro was increased (~2.13 fold vs. DMSO-control, Fig. 4A,
n = 3) this was almost completely blocked following asEGAD treatment
(0.27 fold vs. DMSO-control, Fig. 4A). On protein-level STS-mediated apoptosis in cell cultures (for 6 h) leads to Caspase-3 activation (460.8% vs.
DMSO, Fig. 4B, n = 6). Following asEGAD treatment, Caspase-3 activation is reduced by ~30% (331.1% vs. DMSO-control, Fig. 4B, n = 5).
Discussion
Mild ischemia (MCAO) in rodents leads to a cell damage that is mainly
restricted to the striatum (Popp et al., 2009a). By means of combined cellspeciﬁc immunolabeling and TUNEL staining, in accordance with others
(Katchanov et al., 2001), we demonstrated here that the majority of neurons in the damaged region underwent cell death. We found that following mild MCAO post-ischemic up-regulation of EGAD (~4-fold in mice)
was restricted to ischemic striatal regions and could be localized to the
majority of dying neurons. This unexpected ﬁnding of EGAD expression
in dying neurons was further analyzed in cell culture models of ischemia
and apoptosis. For this purpose, differentiated neurosphere cultures were
used. These cell cultures contain both neurons and glial cells, possess
functioning apoptosis machinery, and have been evaluated as a useful
tool for studies relating to cell death (Moors et al., 2009).
In agreement with our results following MCAO, a transient increase in
the expression of EGAD (~2-fold) occurred following in vitro ischemia
(cOGD). At the same time, differentiated neurospheres showed an intensiﬁed TUNEL signal. cOGD as well as in vivo ischemia result in both necrosis and apoptosis (Goldberg and Choi, 1993; Gwag et al., 1995;
Kalda et al., 1998). Since TUNEL staining cannot discriminate between
these processes (Graham and Chen, 2001), we could not assign EGAD expression to a speciﬁc type of cell death. Therefore, we employed the protein kinase inhibitor STS to selectively induce apoptosis in vitro. We
detected a strengthened but also transient EGAD re-expression (~ 5fold). Simultaneously, the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells increased.
These results imply an involvement of EGAD in apoptotic processes
in vitro. Moreover, in the MCAO model used here, the predominant
type of neuronal cell death has been designated as apoptosis (Endres
et al., 1998). Therefore, EGAD+/TUNEL+ (70%) cells possibly represent
the apoptotic pool of dying neurons, whereas exclusively TUNEL+ neurons (30%) might undergo necrosis following mild MCAO.
EGAD-re-expression in apoptotic cells may be a consequence of reentry of the injured neurons into the cell cycle. Katchanov and coworkers revealed that following mild MCAO post-mitotic neurons in
the ischemic core re-enter the cell cycle, seemingly preceding cell
death (Katchanov et al., 2001). Furthermore, cell cycle re-activation
has been described as a key component of neuronal apoptosis (Becker
and Bonni, 2004; Greene et al., 2007). An association of EGAD with
cell cycle mechanisms can be surmised due to their localization in the
proliferative active regions of the developing and the adult brain
(Behar et al., 1994; Popp et al., 2009b; Somogyi et al., 1995).

Fig. 2. Expression of EGAD in dying neurons at 1 d after transient MCAO in rats. An up-regulation of EGAD mainly in the ipsilateral striatum was detected by RISH. Thionine staining identiﬁed the designated area as the injured area. Counterstaining of RISH (EGAD) with thionine revealed EGAD-positive cells with aberrant morphology (arrows), whereas in the contralateral
striatum, cells exhibited a normal morphology without an EGAD signal (A). TUNEL-positive cells were restricted to the injured area. Triple labeling of NeuN, GFAP, and TUNEL revealed that
most of the TUNEL-positive cells were neurons (B). EGAD radioactive-labeled sections were further stained with TUNEL, NeuN, and GFAP, whereby a co-localization with TUNEL and NeuN
but not with GFAP was detected (C). Maximum intensity projections of z-stacks. Scale bars: (A) brain hemispheres = 500 μm, magniﬁcation = 20 μm. (B, C) = 20 μm.

To test the functional relevance of EGAD re-expression following stroke (pro- or anti-apoptotic) we blocked the EGAD expression in the STS cell culture model with antisense RNA and
subsequently analyzed Caspase-3 expression. Caspase-3 as a key
mediator of apoptosis following stroke has been found upregulated as early as 1 h after ischemia onset (Broughton et al.,
2009). Here we found that post-stroke cleaved Caspase-3 protein
level strongly decreased following blocking of EGAD. This indicates
that EGAD re-expression initiates a pro-apoptotic mechanism following stroke and that blocking of EGAD might be a promising target of neuroprotection.

Pathophysiological expression of EGAD following kainate-induced
limbic seizures has been found to be accompanied by GAD67 elevation
(Szabo et al., 2000). Due to this successive EGAD/GAD67 expression, the
authors assumed that EGAD might regulate adult GAD67 expression as
has been described during development (Behar et al., 1994; Szabo et al.,
1994). This assumption cannot be completely conﬁrmed by our study.
Following mild MCAO, a remarkable up-regulation of EGAD was revealed in the ischemic striatum, whereas the transcript level of GAD67
remained unchanged. Medium spiny GABAergic projection neurons
(GAD67+) represent the major neuronal population in the striatum.
These cells have been shown to die following mild MCAO while

cell death mechanisms following stroke. It is worth investigating
whether EGAD promotes apoptosis under other pathophysiological
conditions and which mechanisms cause the switch from its developmental function to its role in apoptosis in the adult brain. If future
studies reveal EGAD re-expression as a general mechanism in apoptosis, it might be of potential clinical relevance in the context of
neuroprotection.

GABAergic interneurons survive (Jaenisch et al., 2010; Katchanov et al.,
2003). We, therefore, propose that apoptotic medium spiny GABAergic
projection neurons in the striatum re-express EGAD whereas the overall GAD67 expression in the ischemic hemisphere remained unchanged.
In contrast to the in vivo ischemia (MCAO) but more in agreement with
the above-mentioned study of seizured rats (Szabo et al., 2000), a simultaneous expression of EGAD and GAD67 mRNA occurred postcOGD and STS treatment. These differences might be due to the use of
different pathophysiological in vivo and in vitro models and will be further investigated.
Conclusion
In summary, we detected a robust re-expression of EGAD following transient MCAO in rodents. Unexpectedly, EGAD expression was
allocated to cells undergoing cell death. This cell death-related EGAD
expression was conﬁrmed in in vitro cell culture models of ischemia
and apoptosis. Aberrant cell cycle activation in post-mitotic dying
neurons could be the reason for the post-ischemic re-expression of
the developmental-speciﬁc EGAD. The functional relevance of poststroke EGAD in apoptotic neurons was evaluated in an in vitro cell
culture model. Blocking of EGAD re-expression signiﬁcantly reduced
cleaved Caspase-3 activation, a key regulator of apoptosis following
stroke, and therefore revealed a new GABA-related pro-apoptotic
mechanism. To date, EGAD has been characterized as being mainly
involved in developmental processes. In contrast to our initial assumption that its re-expression is a sign of post-ischemic plasticity
and synaptic reorganization, we found here that EGAD promotes
