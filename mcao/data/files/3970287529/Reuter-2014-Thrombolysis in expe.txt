Background and Purpose—Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most adverse event of thrombolysis in ischemic stroke.
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy increases the risk for spontaneous lobar ICH. Although thrombolysis may be performed
in cerebral amyloid angiopathy–affected patients, there is still little knowledge available on the risk for secondary ICH.
Methods—We investigated the effect of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator on experimental ischemic stroke
in APP23 transgenic mice (n=18) and wild-type littermates (n=15). Focal ischemic stroke was induced in 26-month-old
mice by temporal middle cerebral artery occlusion (filament model), followed by treatment with 10 mg/kg recombinant
tissue-type plasminogen activator. Twenty-four hours later, a functional score was assessed and the mice were euthanized
for histological analysis. ICH was classified as grades 1 to 3 depending on severity.
Results—The groups did not differ regarding mortality (P=0.67) and functional deficit (P=0.18). Compared with wild-type
mice, the APP23 genotype was associated with a higher appearance for ICH in the infarct area (P=0.05). ICH severity
grades 2 and 3 correlated significantly with infarct size (P=0.004 and 0.008, respectively).
Conclusions—The APP23 genotype was not associated with increased mortality or worse functional outcome. Our results
suggest an increased risk for ICH in the cerebral amyloid angiopathy–affected brain; however, no ICH was observed
outside the ischemic area.   (Stroke. 2014;45:2411-2416.)

n cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), the formation of
oligomers and insoluble amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits in the leptomeningeal and cortical small arteries and capillaries results
in vascular dysfunction.1,2 This consequently leads to various
degrees of cognitive impairment, white matter lesions, cortical
microinfarcts, superficial siderosis, and multiple cortical microbleeds (cMBs), with a higher incidence of spontaneous lobar
hemorrhage.3–7 The spatial relationship between lobar cMBs
and vascular Aβ deposition was demonstrated by histological
studies and noninvasive T2*-weighted MRI and Pittsburgh
compound B positron emission tomography.8–10 Populationbased studies indicate a prevalence of severe CAA between
7% and 24% in nondemented and 37% and 43% in demented
aged subjects.11 For sporadic CAA, which is the most common
variant, the only established risk factors are age and abnormal
apolipoprotein E genotyping.12,13 A high occurrence of silent
cortical and subcortical microinfarcts, as well as cMBs, in
patients with CAA is well documented, but the frequency of

associated clinical symptoms is small.6,14 However, it seems
likely that the lifetime risk for symptomatic ischemic stroke
(IS) in patients with CAA is considerably high.6,15
Today, thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue-type
plasminogen activator (r-tPA) is the only approved treatment
in patients experiencing acute IS. This overall benefit comes
at the cost of an increased risk for severe side effects such as
symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), with ≈1.8% to
4.5% of all thrombolysed patients being affected.16–18
The increasing availability of MRI, including T2* gradient
echo imaging, facilitates rapid diagnosis of cMBs, which are a
characteristic pattern of CAA. This raises questions about the
individual benefit to risk ratio in patients with stroke hospitalized within the time window and suitable for thrombolysis.
Nowadays, thrombolysis is not restricted in CAA-affected
patients experiencing acute IS. However, inclusion of specific
sequences in current MRI stroke protocols allows for an evaluation of the risk for thrombolysis-associated ICH in patients

suspected to have CAA.19,20 The objective of our study was to
determine the risk of ICH after thrombolytic therapy in an IS
model under standardized experimental conditions using the
APP23 transgenic (APP23-tg) mouse model of CAA.

Methods
Animals
All experiments were approved by the local ethical animal care and
use committee. The procedures were in accordance with institutional animal protection guidelines. Heterozygote B6D2-TgN[ThyAPPSWE]-23-tg mice (B6D2F1), provided by Dr Matthias Staufenbiel
(Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Pharma AG,
Basel, Switzerland), were backcrossed twice with C57BL/6 mice (12
weeks old; Janvier, Saint Berthevin Cedex, France). Eighteen APP23tg (8 males and 10 females) and 15 wild-type (WT) littermates (2
males and 13 females) were kept 26 months under a 12/12 hour light/
dark cycle with standard food and water ad libitum. Sample size calculation is described in the online-only Data Supplement.

MCAo and r-tPA Thrombolysis
Surgeries and the following animal handling including behavioral assessment, MRI, and brain harvesting were performed by an independent investigator blinded to the genetic status of the mice. Transient
focal cerebral ischemia (Figure 1A) was induced via intraluminal filament technique by temporal occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). The transient endovascular filament model technique is
not the model of choice concerning the evaluation of tPA-induced clot
lysis and reperfusion. But it has the advantage of easy performance,
high success rates, and lower rates of complications compared with
clot models of cerebral ischemia.21,22 Because reperfusion was obligatory in our model to investigate the bleeding risk within the area of
infarction, we considered this model suitable for our experiments.
Mice at 26 months of age were anesthetized by face mask with
3.5% isoflurane followed by 1.5% isoflurane for maintenance
(Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany) in a mixture of oxygen/air (1:1).
Body temperature was maintained by a heating pad regulated by a
rectal temperature probe. A 0.19-mm silicone-coated monofilament
suture (Doccol, Sharon, MA) was inserted into the left common cerebral artery and gently advanced through the internal carotid artery
until the offspring of the MCA to achieve occlusion (MCAo).23 After
30 minutes, the filament was removed for reperfusion. After MCAo,
animals were treated intravenously with 10 mg/kg r-tPA (Actilyse,
INN alteplase; Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany). A higher dosage was chosen than used in humans (0.9 mg/kg) because the
murine fibrinolytic system is known to show a weaker response to
r-tPA.24 R-tPA was administered as a 10% bolus followed by continuous infusion for 39 minutes. Twenty-four hours after MCAo, a
modified functional neuroscore was assessed based on that developed
by Bederson et al25: 0=no observable deficit; 1=forelimb flexion;

2=1+decreased resistance to lateral push; 3=2+circling; 4=falling
down to paretic side. 26 Afterward, the mice were euthanized under
deep isoflurane anesthesia by transcardial perfusion with 4% acidfree formaldehyde and the brains were harvested for histological processing. Hematoxylin/eosin and thioflavin S staining protocols are
provided in the online-only Data Supplement.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging
In vivo imaging of 2 randomly selected mice of each group was performed on a 9.4-T Biospec 94/20 USR small animal system equipped
with 740 mT/m gradients and a 1H surface cryogenic probe (Bruker,
Ettlingen, Germany). MRI was performed 20 to 22 hours after
MCAo. T2-weighted images and T2*-weighted gradient echo images were used to demonstrate the ischemic area and possible signs
of ICH. The MRI protocol is provided in detail in the online-only
Data Supplement.

Microscopy, Infarct, and ICH Analysis
All analyses were performed blinded to the genetic status and functional outcome of the mice. For bright-field and fluorescence analysis
and picture acquisition, a Leica DM 4500 B fluorescence microscope
and Leica IM50 Image Manager Software were used (Leica, Wetzlar,
Germany). The infarct area was determined by coronal brain slides
every 100 μm, with the total number of slides depending on the brain
size using Image J (National Institutes of Health, MD). Infarct volume
was calculated by multiplying the infarct area with the distance between the sections. Bleeding grades were determined and counted microscopically by classifying them into grades 1 (single erythrocytes),
2 (small aggregates of erythrocytes), and 3 (large aggregates of erythrocytes) as described before.27 Representative images of bleeding classification are shown in Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with a standard software package
(SPSS for windows; SPPS Inc, Chicago, IL). All parametric values are
expressed as mean± SD. Differences between the groups regarding
mortality and ICH frequency were calculated using the Fisher exact
test. The neurological deficit was assessed by Mann–Whitney U test.
For comparison of infarct volumes, a parametric 1-tailed t test was
used. Sex-dependent differences of infarct volumes were determined
with a 2-tailed t test. The correlation between infarct volume and ICH
grades was calculated using the Spearman ρ test. Correlation coefficient was specified R2. A value of P≤0.05 was considered significant.

Results

MRI Demonstration of Infarcts and ICH

Three representative T2-weighted images of MCAo-derived
ischemic area involving cortex and striatum can be seen in
the right hemisphere of an APP-tg mouse. Histology revealed
an infarct volume of 50.2 mm3. T2*-weighted images of the
same slices reveal several bleedings located only within the
area of infarction (Figure 1A). T2-weighted images in a WT
mouse revealed an ischemic lesion of size 29.9 mm3 as per
histological assessment. In the corresponding T2*-weighted
images, no hypointensities indicative of acute bleedings can
be seen (Figure 1B).

Aβ Deposits and Vessel-Associated Bleedings
Histological analysis using hematoxylin/eosin and thioflavin
S staining demonstrated the colocalization of acute intracerebral bleedings and vascular Aβ deposits (Figure 2). Bleedings
were strictly located within the area of infarction.

after surgery. In the APP-tg group, 1 mouse died after reperfusion, 1 during lysis, and 2 within 24 hours after surgery. In
the WT group, 1 mouse died during reperfusion and 1 within
24 hours after surgery. Mortality rates were comparable with
22% in the APP-tg group versus 13% in the control group
(P=0.665). If the MCA was not reached with the nylon thread
during surgery for any reason (eg, anatomic), this experiment
was considered not successful. This criterion led to exclusion

With 9 of 13 (69%) APP23-tg mice compared with 3 of 11
(27.3%) WT mice, APP23-tg mice displayed a significantly
higher risk to develop ICH after stroke and thrombolytic
therapy (P=0.05). In APP23-tg mice, numbers of grade 1
bleedings ranged from 0 to 17 (median=0; interquartile
range [IQR]=1), grade 2 bleedings ranged from 0 to 174
(median=8; IQR=29.5), and grade 3 bleedings ranged from
0 to 104 (median=2; IQR=5.5). Grade 2 and 3 bleedings correlated significantly with infarct size (P=0.004; R2=0.74 and
P=0.008; R2=0.699, respectively). For WT mice, the correlation of bleedings and infarct volume was statistically not feasible because of low numbers of mice displaying bleedings
(Figure 3).
Mean infarct volumes for the WT group were calculated
with and without exclusion of 1 mouse, which showed an
enlarged ischemic lesion of 112 mm3 and infarction within
bihemispheric vascular territories. Affected were the left
MCA territory and both anterior cerebral artery territories,

undergoing middle cerebral artery occlusion ranged
from 4.5 to 76.9 mm3 (median=28.7; interquartile
range [IQR]= 47.2). Nine of 13 APP23-tg mice (69%)
significantly developed intracerebral hemorrhage
(P=0.05). Numbers of grade 1 bleedings ranged
from 0 to 17 (median=0; IQR=1), grade 2 bleedings
ranged from 0 to 174 (median=8; IQR=29.5), and
grade 3 bleedings ranged from 0 to 104 (median=2;
IQR=5.5). Grade 2 and 3 bleedings correlated
significantly with infarct size (P=0.004; R2=0.74
and P=0.008; R2=0.699, respectively; A). WT mice
displayed infarct sizes from 7.22 to 34.4 mm3
(median=14; IQR=21.5; B).

which can appear as a result of the variants of the intracranial
vascular system. This ischemic lesion was significantly larger
compared with the other WT mice, demonstrated by outlier analysis using an independent samples t test (P<0.001).
Infarctions outside the vascular territory of the MCA were not
a prespecified exclusion criterion of our study. However, in this
case we regarded the exclusion feasible. The statistical analysis with inclusion of all WT mice is provided in the onlineonly Data Supplement. After exclusion of this WT mouse,
the comparison of mean infarct volumes between the groups
revealed significantly larger infarcts (±SD) of 32.5 (±24.9)
mm3 in APP23-tg mice than in WT mice of 18.4 (±10.5) mm3
(P=0.04). Infarct volumes of APP-tg mice ranged from 4.5
to 76.9 mm3 (median=28.7; IQR=47.2). WT mice displayed
infarct sizes from 7.22 to 34.4 mm3 (median=14; IQR=21.5;
Figure 3). No sex-dependent differences in infarct volumes
were determined between the groups, which we statistically
verified to avoid any bias because of an imbalanced sex ratio.

Discussion
In the present study, we examined the effect of intravenous
weight-adapted r-tPA treatment after MCAo in the aged
APP23-tg mouse model of CAA and WT littermates. The
APP23-tg mouse model was originally developed as a model
of the Alzheimer's disease but demonstrated to deposit Aβ
in the cerebrovascular system.28 Parenchymal Aβ deposition
starts at the age of 6 months and vascular amyloid deposition at the age of 8 to 10 months.28,29 Subsequently, these mice
develop characteristic morphological changes similar to those
known from human CAA (ie, cMBs and rarely spontaneous
lobar hemorrhage).29 Vascular Aβ deposits in 26-month-old
mice are severe. In previous studies, CAA has shown to negatively affect cerebral vasoreactivity.30–32 In our study, the neurological deficit and mortality after MCAo did not statistically
significantly differ compared with WT animals. However, the
neurobehavioral testing might not have been sensitive enough
to detect differences between the groups compared with more
extensive test batteries.
Our results provide evidence that r-tPA treatment in the
presence of Aβ causes an increased risk for ICH into the
ischemic brain parenchyma and that ICH severity correlates
with infarct volume. Aβ deposition induces proteinolytic and
anticoagulatory pathways, thus increasing the risk for ICH:
Vascular Aβ deposition leads to matrix metalloproteinase activation and oxidative stress.33,34 In vitro data further suggest
that Aβ promotes urokinase-type plasmin activator expression
and plasminogen activation in human cerebrovascular smooth
muscle cells.35,36
Although the APP23-tg mouse model of CAA is at greater
risk for spontaneous vascular leakage with development of
cMBs and lobar ICH, we observed no ICH after r-tPA treatment outside the infarct area. This difference from a previous study using the same mouse model may be related to the
different interval between r-tPA treatment and analysis (24
hours in the present study versus 10 days in Winkler et al37).
The occurrence of ICH strictly restricted to the area of ischemic injury might explain the missing impact on functional
deficit and mortality in the APP23-tg group. APP23-tg mice

demonstrated significantly larger ischemic lesions compared
with WT mice. This observation is in line with a previous
study reporting enlarged infarcts in the FVB/N transgenic APP
mouse model, although this model does not develop vascular
changes similar to CAA38 Nevertheless, it has to be stated
that differences in ischemic volumes after MCAo depending
on genotype were not our primary outcome parameter. Prior
sample size calculation was not performed to detect such differences. The inner-group variability of the ischemic lesions
in our study is of relevance; therefore, the results have to be
interpreted with caution and need to be confirmed.
In specialized stroke centers, the percentage of IS patients
treated with r-tPA nowadays exceeds 20%.39 This may be
attributed to growing evidence that patients aged ≥80 years
also benefit significantly from r-tPA treatment.16,18,40,41 Thus, it
is likely that patients with stroke experiencing (undiagnosed)
CAA are frequently undergoing thrombolytic therapy. Yet,
the risk for ICH intracerebral bleeding complications in this
subgroup is still unknown. For large observational studies
evaluating this question, the most appropriate morphological parameter indicating possible CAA is cortical- and subcortical-located cMBs. However, even the largest prospective
clinical study with 570 patients addressing the relationship
between cMBs and ICH after IS and thrombolytic therapy
was statistically not powerful enough to detect a significant
increase.42 One prospective study revealed an association
among r-tPA therapy, ICH, and amyloid burden by Pittsburgh
compound B positron emission tomography but did not allow
a quantitative risk assessment because of small numbers.43
Two recent meta-analyses tried to estimate the frequency of
ICH after thrombolytic therapy in the presence of cMBs but
failed to demonstrate a valid association, again most likely
because of small numbers.19,20
Transgenic animal models are most helpful to investigate
the impact of therapeutic strategies in the presence of a welldefined underlying pathology and under standardized conditions. However, their results only generate hypotheses and
need to be confirmed in future animal studies and human clinical trials. Symptomatic ICH after thrombolysis occurs in 1.8%
to 4.5% of all patients, and only a subgroup can be attributed
to CAA.16,18
Our study suffers some specific limitations: (1) We are not
able to disclose hemorrhagic transformation in our model
after stroke but in the absence of r-tPA. This might lead to an
overestimation of the hemorrhagic burden induced by r-tPA.
Regarding the existing literature, this possible association
was never systematically investigated in humans or rodents.
However, several observational studies tried to evaluate the
risk of CAA-associated ICH after stroke and thrombolytic
therapy, because this is an ongoing debate in daily clinical routine. Therefore, we aimed to adjust our experimental
design with these clinical studies to examine this specific and
clinically important aspect from a rodent point of view. (2)
Histological evaluation of the reason of death was not performed for the animals dying under the procedure or during
the following 24 hours. We therefore might have missed lethal
hyperacute brain ischemia and ICH in these mice, which could
have biased our data.

Reuter et al   Thrombolysis Induces ICH in a Stroke Model of CAA   2415
In conclusion, our experimental findings indicate a higher
risk for ICH in combination of CAA and stroke thrombolytic
therapy. ICH severity in the CAA-affected brain increased
with infarct volume. Intravenous thrombolysis of stroke in
the presence of CAA did not negatively affect the clinical
parameters mortality and neurological deficit, although larger
ischemic volumes compared with WT mice were observed.
Furthermore, although the APP23-tg mouse model of CAA
is at greater risk for spontaneous vascular leakage with the
development of cMBs and lobar ICH, we observed no ICH
after r-tPA treatment outside the infarct area. The occurrence
of ICH strictly restricted to the area of ischemic injury might
explain the missing impact on functional deficit and mortality
in the APP23-tg group.

Supplemental Methods
Sample size calculation
Sample size calculation with the occurrence of intracerebral hemorrhage as the primary
outcome parameter was performed using Fisher`s exact-test under a presumed rate of ICH of
0.2 in wildtype mice and 0.7 in APP23-tg mice. 15 mice per group were regarded necessary to
detect a difference with a level of significance (α) of 0.05 and a power (1-β) of 0.8. Due to an
unexpected high mortality rate over the long keeping period, only 18 APP23-tg mice and 15
wt-mice were available for the experimental study, leaving 13 APP23tg-mice and 11 wt-mice
suitable for statistical analysis according to either death during the experiment or the
exclusion criteria.

MRI
The animals were anesthetised with 1.5 % Isofluran and positioned into the magnet with a
laser-controlled system for the animal cradles. Respiratory frequency and body temperature
(maintained with a water heating pad) were monitored throughout the measurement. For
detection of cerebral ischemia, T2-weighted images were acquired with a coronal T2weighted RARE sequence using the following parameters: TR/TE = 3300/60 ms, echo train
length = 4, FOV=14 x 11 mm2, matrix size = 256x200. 18 slices (four averages) were
acquired in a total acquisition time of 4 min 24 s. Iron as a content of erythrocytes or
hemosiderin leads to a decrease in the transverse relaxation time of water protons diffusing
close to the cells, resulting in turn in signal loss in T2*-weighted gradient echo images 1. The
visualization was realized with a 2D-FLASH sequence and the following sequence
parameters: TR/TE = 600/8 ms, flip angle = 60°, FOV = 14 x 11 x mm2, matrix size = 256 x
200, 18 slices, three averages. The total acquisition time was 6 min.

Histology
After incubation of the harvested brains in 4 % acid free formaldehyde at 4°C over night and
dehydrating steps in ethanol and xylol (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), 2 mm blocs were
embedded in paraffin and cut into 4 µm sections. Infarct size and bleeding score analyses
were done using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections (Hollborn&Soehne, Leipzig,
Germany). After three dewaxing steps in xylene for 5 minutes each and rehydration in ethanol
(100%, 96%, 80% and 70%) and aqua dest. for 2 minutes each, sections were incubated in
hematoxylin for 5 minutes and washed in tap water for 15 minutes. After incubation in eosin
for 3 minutes sections were dehydrated in ethanol (80%, 90%, 100%) and xylene (three times)
for 2 minutes each. Sections were mounted in Eukitt For fluorescence analysis of Aβ and
vessel status, after dewaxing and rehydration as described above, sections were incubated
with 1 % Thioflavin S (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) followed by incubation in ethanol
(70%) for 5 minutes. After two washing steps in aqua dest. for 2 minutes each and three steps
in 1xPBS (Gibco/Invitrogen, Paisley, U.K.) (pH 7.4) for 5 minutes each sections were
incubated with DAPI (KPL, Gaithersburg, USA) at a ratio of 1:500 for 1h at room
temperature. After four last washing steps in 1xPBS sections were mounted in Mowiol (Roth,
Karlsruhe, Germany) and stored at 4°C.

Calculation of infarct volume with inclusion of all wt mice
Without exclusion of one wt mouse with infarction in multiple vascular territories, a
comparison of mean infarct volumes between the groups revealed similar infarcts (±SD) of
32.5 (±24.9) mm3 in APP23-tg mice and 26.2 ±28.9 mm3 in wt mice (p=0.57). Infarct
volumes of APP-tg mice ranged from 4.5 to 76.9 mm3 (median=28.7; interquartile range
(IQR) = 47.2). Wt mice displayed infarct sizes from 7.22 to 112.4 mm3 (median=15.65;
IQR=22.2)
