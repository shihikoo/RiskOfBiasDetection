Spreading depolarization (SD) contributes to the ischemic damage of the penumbra. Although age is the
largest predictor of stroke, no studies have examined age dependence of SD appearance. We characterized the electrophysiological and hemodynamic changes in young (6 weeks old, n ¼ 7), middle-aged
(9 months old, n ¼ 6), and old (2 years old, n ¼ 7) male Wistar rats during 30 minutes of middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO), utilizing multimodal imaging through a closed cranial window over the
ischemic cortex: membrane potential changes (with a voltage-sensitive dye), cerebral blood volume
(green light reﬂectance), and cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF, laser-speckle imaging) were observed. The initial
CBF drop was similar in all groups, with a signiﬁcant further reduction during ischemia in old rats (p <
0.01). Age reduced the total number of SDs (p < 0.05) but increased the size of ischemic area displaying
prolonged SD (p < 0.01). The growth of area undergoing prolonged SDs positively correlated with the
growth of ischemic core area (p < 0.01) during MCAO. Prolonged SDs and associated hypoperfusion likely
compromise cortical tissue exposed to even a short focal ischemia in aged rats.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke is a main contributor to disability worldwide
and a leading cause of death (Chen et al., 2010). Stroke symptoms
may appear at any age, but the vast majority of patients are aged.
Sixty-ﬁve percent of patients who suffered stroke are more than
65 years, and the mean age of stroke is 71 years in the United
States (Fonarow et al., 2010). Elderly patients have higher mortality and worse functional outcome because of comorbidities,
lower regenerative capacity, and age-related cardiovascular
dysfunction (Allen and Bayraktutan, 2008; Fonarow et al., 2010;
Knoﬂach et al., 2012; Ungvari et al., 2010; Weimar et al., 2004).

A major clinical study showed that the conversion of ischemic
tissue into infarction is accelerated with age (Ay et al., 2008; Copen
et al., 2001), and this observation was repeated in an experimental
stroke model in rats (Petcu et al., 2008).
Spreading depolarization (SD) is a sustained dramatic loss of
cellular membrane potential, which disrupts cellular and extracellular ion homeostasis, causes cellular swelling, and requires
tremendous energy from the cell to restore its normal ion balance
and membrane potential. Normally, the increased metabolites
required to supply this energy are provided by elevated local
cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) mediated via an intact neurovascular
coupling. SD events commonly appear in regions surrounding
focal ischemia (Hossmann, 1996). When SDs inundate metabolically compromised tissue, they can promote total cellular energy
collapse, exacerbating ischemic damage and contributing to early
brain infarct development (Dijkhuizen et al., 1999).
SDs during ischemia are associated with various types of hemodynamic responses that are largely dependent on the distance
from the ischemic core and on the animal species studied (Ayata
et al., 2004; Luckl et al., 2009; Shin et al., 2006; Strong et al.,

2804

D. Clark et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 35 (2014) 2803e2811

2007). When SDs are coupled with sustained hypoperfusion (the
underlying mechanism termed inverse neurovascular coupling) in
areas closer to the core, this reduction of local blood ﬂow superimposed on ischemia is suggested to contribute to SD-related injury
(Shin et al., 2006). In clinical studies, the frequency of SDs and the
concomitant inverse hemodynamic response highly correlated
with mortality and poor neurologic outcome after ischemic brain
damage, traumatic brain injury, and subarachnoid hemorrhage
(Dohmen et al., 2008; Dreier et al., 2009; Fabricius et al., 2006). No
clinical study has systematically investigated the relationship between depolarization events, hemodynamic responses, and age.
Previously, we have shown that topical potassium (Kþ) elicits fewer
recurrent SDs in the cortex of healthy aged rats compared with
young rats (Farkas et al., 2011). Considering the high incidence of
stroke in elderly patients and the importance of SDs in the pathophysiology of stroke, we identiﬁed and described the emerging SDs
and the coupled local CBF changes in a large ischemic area of young,
middle-aged, and old rats during and after a short transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). As age broadly impacts neurovascular health, we expected that the appearance and length
(transient or prolonged) of spontaneous SDs and the accompanying
hemodynamic response during ischemia differ with age. We used a
multimodal imaging technique combined with a unique custommade matrix analysis of the recorded signal over a large ﬁeld of
the parietal cortex including parts of the ischemic core (<20% of
baseline CBF) and the penumbra (20%e60% of baseline CBF).
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Surgical procedures
Procedures were approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal
Care at the University of Szeged. Detailed descriptions of similar
surgical preparations were previously published (Clark et al., 2012;
Farkas et al., 2008), with modiﬁcations. Male Wistar rats of 3 age
groups were compared: young (6 weeks, n ¼ 7), middle-aged
(9 months, n ¼ 6), and old (2 years [23e25 months], n ¼ 7). Rats
were anesthetized with halothane (2.5% during surgery and 1.5%
during imaging) in N2O:O2 (2:1), and animals were allowed to
breath spontaneously throughout the experiment. To avoid the
production of airway mucus, rats were pretreated with 0.05 mL
atropine (0.1%) intramuscularly. Body temperature was maintained
at 37.0  0.2  C with a servo-regulated heating pad, and the tail
artery was cannulated for monitoring of mean arterial blood
pressure.
Both common carotid arteries were delicately separated from
the surrounding tissue, including the vagal nerve, through a
midline incision in the neck. A long silk suture was placed around
each artery. Rats were transferred to a stereotactic frame and ﬁxed
in the prone position. A cranial window (w4  4 mm) was prepared
over the right parietal cortex. A second smaller window (2  2 mm)
was drilled on the temporal bone over the distal MCA. In both cases,
the bone was carefully thinned using a water-cooled drill (Technobox, Bien Air 810) and gently peeled away to reveal the dural
surface. A ring of dental cement was built around the edge of the
parietal craniotomy, incorporating a sealed inlet and outlet tubes.
The resultant chamber was ﬁlled with artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid
(aCSF, 126.6 NaCl, 3KCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 24.5 NaHCO3, 6.7 urea,
and 3.7 glucose [with concentrations in millimolar], bubbled with
95% O2 and 5% CO2 to achieve a constant pH of 7.45), and the dura
was gently dissected. The window was then sealed with a ﬁtted
glass coverslip, using 2-component glue (UHU GmbH & Co, KG,
Bühl, Germany). The closed window was continuously perfused
with aCSF at a rate of 25 mL per minute, unless otherwise speciﬁed.
In the lateral window, only a small slice of dura was gently removed

over the trunk of the distal MCA, to allow access for clipping of the
vessel. The temporal window was kept moist with warmed aCSF.
2.2. Experimental paradigm and ischemia induction
The cortical tissue underlying the closed cranial window was
loaded with a voltage-sensitive (VS) dye (RH-1838; Optical Imaging
Ltd, Rehovot, Israel), as described in detail elsewhere (Farkas et al.,
2010). This dye binds to the cell membrane and increases in ﬂuorescence in response to reduced cellular transmembrane potential
(Grinvald and Hildesheim, 2004). The VS-dye concentration was
adjusted in such a way that, after 20 dilution, the optical density
measured at 580 nm with a spectrophotometer was between 0.110
and 0.130 (Farkas et al., 2008). Diluted VS dye in aCSF was circulated
over the exposed cortex (80 mL per minute) for 1 hour, followed by
an aCSF rinsing for 1 hour. A laser diode, a green light-emitting
diode (LED) light source, and 2 charge coupled device cameras
were set up for multimodal imaging. The experimental paradigm is
shown in Fig. 1A. Image acquisition was initiated, and a 10-minute
baseline period was recorded. To induce focal cerebral ischemia of
the cortex, a small microaneurysm clip was placed (Sundt AVM
Microclip, Codman) gently around the most proximal branch of the
distal MCA visible through the temporal craniotomy. Immediately
after the application of the clip, both common carotid arteries were
transiently occluded by gently pulling on the long silk sutures
looped around them until a small tension was detected. The sutures
were secured in place. After a period of 30 minutes, the microclip
was removed and both carotid sutures were released to allow for
reperfusion. Images were captured for an additional hour, after
which rats were euthanized by an injection of a 5-mL bolus of air
into the tail artery that stopped the heart. Ten minutes of biologic
zero were recorded for all parameters after death.
2.3. Multimodal imaging of the cortex
A multimodal imaging system, developed in our laboratory and
described in detail in the earlier publications (Farkas et al., 2008,
2010), was used to investigate changes in cellular membrane potential, using a VS dye, and associated hemodynamic responses in
the cortical area of interest. To capture VS ﬂuorescence images, the
cortical surface was illuminated with a ﬂashing (1-Hz, 100-ms
pulse length) red high-power LED (625 nm peak wavelength,
SLS-0307_A; Mightex Systems, Pleasanton, CA, USA) ﬁtted with a
620- to 640-nm excitation ﬁlter (3RD620-640; Omega Optical Inc,
Brattleboro, VT, USA). Regional changes in CBF were assessed with
laser-speckle contrast imaging: the cortex was intermittently
illuminated with a laser diode (Sanyo DL7140-201S, 70 mW, 736
nm emission wavelength), and CBF maps were calculated from the
obtained raw speckle images as previously described (Obrenovitch
et al., 2009). Intrinsic optical signal (IOS) was investigated by
recording the reﬂected light evoked under 540e550 nm green
high-power LED illumination (pulse length: 100 ms). At this
wavelength, the molar extinction coefﬁcients of both oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin are similar; so, the IOS primarily
indicates changes in local cerebral blood volume, independent of
oxygen saturation (Farkas et al., 2008). However, green IOS is also
altered by changes in extracellular volume associated with SD
(Ba et al., 2002; Dahlem and Hanke, 2005). The different LEDs and
the laser diode were arranged around the cranial window in such a
way as to ensure homogeneous illumination across the ﬁeld of
view with each light source.
Images of the cortex were captured at an effective frame rate of 1
Hz using 2 monochrome charge coupled device cameras (1024 
1024 pixel max resolution; Pantera 1M30, DALSA, Gröbenzell,
Germany), as described in Farkas et al. (2010). Both cameras were

attached to a stereomicroscope by a 1:1 binocular/video-tube beam
splitter (MZ12.5; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The image was magniﬁed 3.15, and the resultant ﬁeld of view was 3.8 
3.8 mm. Image resolution was reduced to 512  512 pixels for each
parameter, after binning; so, each pixel represented a 7.42  7.42
mm area of the cortical surface.
2.4. Data analysis of optical images
According to previously established methods (Farkas et al.,
2010; Obrenovitch et al., 2009), we ﬁrst identiﬁed SDs and evaluated how they were coupled with changes in local CBF by the
assessment and simultaneous (termed single point) analysis of the
VS dye, green IOS, and CBF traces of a small region of interest (ROI,
size 3  3 pixels) of the parietal cortex (Fig. 1B). To quantitatively
track the spatial features of the membrane potential and hemodynamic events over the cortical surface, the whole ﬁeld of view
under the cranial window was analyzed (termed whole-ﬁeld
analysis) (Supplementary Fig. 1), in addition to single-point ROI
analysis. For the details of single-point and whole-ﬁeld analyses of
multimodal recordings, see Supplementary Materials and
Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1. In short, we identiﬁed and
classiﬁed SDs as transient SDs (<200 seconds, but typically
80e100 seconds long depolarization-repolarization period) or
prolonged (>200 seconds of depolarization plateau with no
repolarization) SDs. Representative traces of the single-point
analysis of the membrane potential (VS dye signature), green

IOS, and CBF changes of a transient and a prolonged SD are shown
on Fig. 1D.
Relative CBF changes associated with tMCAO were analyzed over
the parenchyma by categorizing the pixels of the analyzed ﬁeld of
view based on the rate of CBF drop. The total areas where CBF
dropped to 0%e20%, 20%e60%, or >60% of the pre-ischemic baseline CBF were determined (Fig. 2A and B). We deﬁned area with
<20% of baseline CBF as ischemic core, considered to be below the
“viability threshold” of the brain tissue (Hoehn-Berlage et al., 1995;
Hossmann, 1994; Shin et al., 2006) leading to neuronal death. Areas
with 20%e60% of baseline CBF were deemed the ischemic penumbra, and regions with CBF >60% of baseline were referred to as
oligemic areas, where the affected tissue is not at risk of infarction
(Baron, 2001).
2.5. Statistics
Parametric data are presented as mean  standard deviation or
mean  standard error (depending on which presentation was most
appropriate for the data), and nonparametric data (total number of
SDs) are shown as median and quartiles. Group differences in the
total number of SDs were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis analysis of
variance (ANOVA) on ranks followed by Student-Newman-Keuls
post hoc comparison by the program Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences (SPSS; SPSS Inc, www.spss.com). The relative sizes
of transient and prolonged SD area to total area between the groups
were compared with 1-way ANOVA followed by Fisher least

2806

D. Clark et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 35 (2014) 2803e2811

signiﬁcant difference post hoc testing. For the comparison of initial
and ﬁnal CBF values among the groups, we used a repeatedmeasures ANOVA paradigm followed by least signiﬁcant difference post hoc test. Pearson linear correlation test was applied to
evaluate the relationship between the relative size of transient
and prolonged SD area and the expansion of severely ischemic
area during ischemia. Signiﬁcance was considered when p < 0.05,
and signiﬁcance level for each ﬁnding was denoted as * p < 0.05 and
** p < 0.01 for all analyses.

3. Results
3.1. CBF changes during tMCAO
Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed an overall signiﬁcant
interaction between age, size of CBF ranges, and time period
during ischemia (p ¼ 0.012). In the young group, the relative size
of the ischemic penumbra (76.9%  3.9%) was the largest in the
cortical parenchyma immediately after tMCAO, and the ischemic
core region was minor (9.2%  5.2%, Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, the
better perfused oligemic area (>60% perfusion) was more represented at the start of ischemia in the middle-aged and old groups
(30.3%  10.0% and 32.0%  12.2%, respectively) with respect to the
young group (16.0%  4.7%, Fig. 2A). The perfusion pattern was
reorganized toward the end of the ischemic period. Whereas the
extension of the oligemic area increased in the young and middleaged groups to 33.5%  9.3% and 40.6%  7.6%, respectively, the
share of this area markedly decreased in the old group to 13.3% 
9.5%. Inversely, the ratio of ischemic core areas (<20% of baseline

CBF) decreased in the young (from 9.2%  5.2% to 0.7%  0.4%) and
middle-aged (from 13.6%  8.0% to 1.5%  1.3%) groups and
remarkably increased in the old group (from 14.4%  8.6% to 49.8%
 15.7%) (data are mean  standard error) (Fig. 2A and B).

3.2. Frequency and spatial expansion of transient and prolonged
SDs during and after tMCAO
In Fig. 1C, we marked the appearance of all SDs on a 60-minute
time scale (30 minutes tMCAO and 30 minutes early reperfusion).
A total of 59 SDs were captured during the full recording time in
the 20 rats (young n ¼ 28, middle-aged n ¼ 18, old n ¼ 13); 52 SDs
occurred during ischemia, and only 7 SDs evolved during reperfusion. No spontaneous SDs were detected during the 10-minute
baseline recording. Most SDs appeared in the ﬁrst 10 minutes of
tMCAO with similar frequency in all groups (young n ¼ 10, middleaged n ¼ 9, old n ¼ 8). We counted the number of SD events per
animal in all age groups. Young (q1 ¼ 4, median ¼ 4, q3 ¼ 4.75) and
middle-aged rats (q1 ¼ 3, median ¼ 3.5, q3 ¼ 4) had signiﬁcantly
more SDs than old rats (q1 ¼ 1, median ¼ 2, q3 ¼ 2.75) during the
30-minute ischemia and during the 60-minute reperfusion period
(Fig. 3A). SDs were classiﬁed as either transient or prolonged, as
speciﬁed earlier. Importantly, we never found subsequent SD
events after the evolution of a prolonged SD in a particular area.
Next, we determined the relative size of the area where transient and prolonged SDs appeared during ischemia. There was no
statistical difference in the size of the vessel-free surface area used
for analysis between the experimental groups (young 2.6  0.6
mm2, middle aged 2.2  0.6 mm2, old 2.9  1.5 mm2). The

D. Clark et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 35 (2014) 2803e2811

percentage of the surface area involved in the evolution of SD (total
SD area during tMCAO) was also similar in young (98%  20%),
middle-aged (87%  15%), and old (87%  15%) rats and was independent of the total number of SDs. Note that some regions that
underwent a prolonged SD had been exposed to a transient SD
earlier during the period of ischemia.
The percentage of the area invaded by transient SDs appeared
remarkably larger in young and middle-aged rats (91%  5% and
82%  8%, respectively) compared with old rats (34%  15%)
(Fig. 3B). Accordingly, the relative area involved in the evolution of
prolonged SDs was signiﬁcantly larger in the old group (62%  15%)
than in the young (14%  7%) and middle-aged (17%  12%) groups
(Fig. 3C).
3.3. Pattern and direction of SD propagation
The high spatial and temporal resolution of multimodal imaging allowed us to evaluate the effect of age on the speed of
propagation, shape of the wave front, and direction of SD propagation. Age did not signiﬁcantly alter the speed of propagation,
although we did notice a trend with waves traveling at an average

2807

of 2.185  0.283 mm per second in old animals, compared with
2.812  0.163 and 2.651  0.163 mm per second in the young and
middle-aged rats, respectively. Depolarization waves were classiﬁed as to whether they propagated as a straight wave front across
the entire ﬁeld of view or displayed a curved or circulating course
of propagation sometimes avoiding a speciﬁc bulk of tissue. Older
animals had a higher proportion of curved waves (71%) compared
with young (36%) and middle-aged (50%, Fig. 3D) rats.
Various patterns of wave propagation across the visual ﬁeld of
view were observed and are depicted in Fig. 3E. Most SDs in young
and middle-aged rats entered the ﬁeld of view from the frontolateral corner of the window (89% and 80%, respectively), but in
rare cases, the SD originated within the window and spread outward in a radial fashion (young 7%, middle aged 20%) or entered
from the medial side of the ﬁeld of view traveling toward the
lateral side (young 4%, middle aged 0%). The path of SD propagation was more varied in old rats compared with the younger animals. In old rats, some SDs entered from the frontolateral (43%) or
medial (7%) edge of the window and traveled straight out of the
ﬁeld of view. In 14% of aged animals, we visualized a split wave
entering the window from the lateral side, which fused and

terminated in a central region. In many cases, SDs traveled to a
central point and then outward (43%). The proportion of SDs in
each group displaying each propagation pattern is indicated in
Fig. 3E.
3.4. SDs and coupled CBF responses
Analysis of a small (w500 mm2) ROI with a conserved location
in the frontolateral part of the cranial window identiﬁed a very
similar proportion of transient and prolonged SDs to the wholeﬁeld analysis (only 2 SDs evaded the ROI in 2 middle-aged rat,
Fig. 4A). The highly common transient SDs (n ¼ 26) were mostly
coupled with hyperemia (n ¼ 21, 34.5%  14%) or no CBF response
(n ¼ 5) in the young group. Rare prolonged SDs (n ¼2) were
coupled with reduced CBF (n ¼ 2, 22.2%  16%) in the young
group. In the middle-aged group, transient SDs (n ¼ 12) were
mostly coupled with hyperemia (41.2%  17%) and reduced CBF
only accompanied 1 transient and the only prolonged SD (30.0%).
Old rats had a high number of prolonged SDs (n ¼ 7) with a
notable average CBF decrease of 32.7%  11%. Transient SDs in
this group (n ¼ 6) were followed by either no (n ¼ 3) or a mild
increase in CBF (n ¼ 3, 27.0%  12%). All 7 SDs that appeared
during reperfusion were transient and were coupled with
hyperemia.
3.5. Correlation between SD type and the expansion of ischemic
core
Statistical correlation between the relative area of prolonged
SD and the relative size of the ischemic core region (regions
where CBF was <20% of the pre-ischemic baseline) taken at the

end of tMCAO revealed a signiﬁcant positive correlation (p < 0.01,
Fig. 4B). At the same time, the relative area of transient SDs was
inversely associated with the expansion of the ischemic core area
(p < 0.05, Fig. 4C). In other words, when transient SDs occurred
over the ﬁeld of view, local CBF improved during the 30-minute
tMCAO, but when SDs were prolonged, the territory of the
ischemic core enlarged.
4. Discussion
4.1. Major ﬁndings
We have shown for the ﬁrst time that the ischemic brain of aged
rats (1) spontaneously generates fewer but often prolonged SDs
compared with young and middle-aged rats, (2) the appearance of
prolonged SDs correlates with the progression of severe ischemia,
and (3) the shape and direction of SDs are highly variable particularly in old rats. The age dependence of these observations is
conﬁrmed with middle-aged rats, as they showed characteristics
typical for both the young and aged groups. As discussed subsequently, there are multiple possible factors related to aging that
would account for these differences.
4.2. Lower susceptibility of the aged brain to SDs
The aging brain has a reduced susceptibility to SD elicitation
as previously demonstrated by our group in a study showing that
topical Kþ induces less SDs in 10-month-old than in 8-week-old
rats (Farkas et al., 2011). Here, we used approximately the same
aged rats (middle-aged group) as in our previous study and
added a group of senescent rats. When these groups were

D. Clark et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 35 (2014) 2803e2811

exposed to ischemia, a corresponding age-dependent decline was
observed in the number of spontaneous SDs. A similar trend has
been described in human studies: young patients with traumatic
brain injury had more frequent SDs than older patients, although
the initial origin of damage and the period of monitoring were
highly variable (Fabricius et al., 2006; Strong et al., 2002). The
explanation for the general reduced sensitivity of the aged brain
to generate SD events is unclear. One could speculate that the
lower neuronal density of the cortex with age is a contributor
(Knox, 1982). The composition of neurons and glia in the cortex
may also be a factor: aging leads to a lower number of neurons
relative to astrocytes in the cortex. SDs causing migraine aura
tend to appear in the visual cortex, where the relative ratio of
neurons to astrocytes is the highest (Gonzalez de la Aleja et al.,
2013). Possibly, the extracellular ion shifts and transmitter
levels increase more gradually in the rareﬁed old brain. Alternatively, the lower expression and activity of depolarizing ion
channels on neurons and glia in the aged brain could be a
contributing factor. Supporting this possibility is the observation
that both N-methyl D aspartate receptor density and function are
reduced in aged rats (Dyall et al., 2007; Magnusson et al., 2010). A
practical explanation for the lower incidence of total SDs is that
the frequent appearance of prolonged SDs in aged animals
maintains a sustained depolarized state, and the tissue remains
refractory to further SD evolution. According to the previous
observations (Weimer and Hanke, 2005) and prediction analyses
(Zandt et al., 2013), the susceptibility of the aging brain does not
correlate with the propagation speed of SD. Similarly, we did not
ﬁnd a signiﬁcant age-dependent difference in the speed of SD
propagation. Finally, halothane anesthesia, similar to many other
anesthetics, exerts neuroprotective effects during ischemia (for
review, see Matchett et al., 2009) via several pathways that may
inﬂuence the length and hemodynamic coupling of emerging
SDs. Halothane also suppresses the susceptibility of the cortex to
SD (Kudo et al., 2008; Sonn and Mayevsky, 2006), which suggests
that the difference in SD frequency might be even higher between the age groups in the awake state.
4.3. Larger area of prolonged SD in aged rats during tMCAO
In aged rats, we often identiﬁed the appearance of prolonged
SDs in the penumbra, which our software could reliably follow for
200 seconds after the beginning of the depolarization plateau
(hence they were termed “prolonged”). However, our visual
observation from the single-point measurement suggests that
these depolarizations were persistent until at least the reperfusion
of the tissue. First, according to the single-point recordings, prolonged SDs within the VS-dye signature of single pixels rarely
showed any signs of repolarization, and second, they were never
followed by another transient SD during the ischemic period, suggesting the prolonged depolarizations were mostly terminal. Our
technique is also limited, as it does not allow us to quantify the
absolute potential shift during the appearance of SDs or the precise
dynamics of transient and prolonged SDs without direct electrophysiological measurements.
SDs recorded during the 30-minute tMCAO in young and
middle-aged rats were similar in shape and number to the recordings reported from the previous studies achieving a comparable level of ischemia using either cortical surface injection of
endothelin-1 or permanent or tMCAO in rats (Hartings et al.,
2003; Oliveira-Ferreira et al., 2010). We detected only small scattered regions that experienced a prolonged SD during the course of
ischemia in the younger age groups, suggesting the ability of that
tissue to repolarize. In contrast, the high incidence and the larger
area where prolonged SDs appeared in old rats indicate that either

2809

the energy availability of the tissue was lower or the efﬁcacy of ion
pumps mediating repolarization was decreased.
In the present study, very few SDs were detected during the
reperfusion period and those seen were all during the ﬁrst 20 minutes of reperfusion. This is consistent with the previous ﬁndings
(Hartings et al., 2003) where 2 hours of tMCAO was accompanied
by multiple SDs during but not in the ﬁrst 6 hours of reperfusion.
Only 1 hour of reperfusion was monitored in the present study, and
it is likely that further differences between age groups could be
characterized at more chronic time points during which time injury
and recovery processes evolve in the tissue. Also, it is likely that a
longer period of ischemia (i.e., 60 or 90 minutes) would induce
more prolonged SDs and instances of inverse hemodynamic
coupling, even in the young and middle-aged rats, similar to the
previous observations (Oliveira-Ferreira et al., 2010; Shin et al.,
2006).
Overall, although aged rats seem to have fewer SDs than young
rats, but as discussed subsequently, this likely did not reﬂect the
adverse metabolic effects on the tissue. Metabolic depletion likely
depends more on the length of the SDs and the coupled hemodynamic response.
4.4. Progressive ischemia in aged rats during tMCAO
In young and middle-aged rats, SDs were most often coupled
with elevated regional CBF, likely allowing tissue to tolerate and
recover from the large shift in membrane potential associated with
SD. Because the cortex exposed to SD was already ischemic, the
evoked hyperemia could be provided by increased collateral blood
ﬂow from better perfused regions outside of the observed area. A
higher dilator capacity of cortical arteries and arterioles might
provide a better perfusion reserve in the younger age groups. This
suggests that vasodilator agents were present when depolarization traveled into the tissue. Aged rats were more prone to prolonged SDs, which were always coupled with hypoperfusion. SDrelated vasoconstriction is possible if the bioavailability of vasorelaxants or the baseline enzyme activity/expression is low and a
drastic elevation of extracellular Kþ promotes vasoconstriction
(Windmuller et al., 2005). Aged brain in rats exhibits the same
expression of both endothelial and neuronal nitric oxide (NO)
synthase as young rats (Liu et al., 2004), and the activity of these
enzymes was higher in old than young prefrontal cortex (Liu et al.,
2004). Still, the bioavailability of NO is probably reduced by conversion of NO into nitrosative free radicals in old rats (Mayhan
et al., 2008; Ungvari et al., 2010). A few studies support the
concept that SD-coupled hyperemia in the pial vasculature is
greatly determined by vasodilatory substances released from
sensory and autonomic nerve endings (for review, see Busija et al.,
2008). Future studies could unravel whether age-related neurodegeneration in these nerve endings is present or not in the old
brain that could limit the release of vasorelaxant mediators.
Alternatively, higher expression of vasoconstrictor molecules (e.g.,
20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), Fordsmann et al.,
2013) could account for the evolution of inverse neurovascular
coupling.
According to a current concept, the initial energy failure associated with the negative potential shift drives the local vasculature
to constrict, but the subsequent energy deﬁciency induced by this
ischemic constriction determines how long and how severely
neurons depolarize, creating a sustained vicious circle of local
hypoxia and depolarization leading eventually to cell death
(Dreier, 2011). One could speculate that if initial depolarization
induces severe ischemia because of the low availability of dilator
agents in the aged brain, then the energy needed for the tissue to
repolarize is not provided, thus cells stay in a permanently

2810

D. Clark et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 35 (2014) 2803e2811

depolarized state. Sustained depolarization events can promote
subsequent neuropathologic processes, such as blood brain barrier
breakdown by the activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9
(Gursoy-Ozdemir et al., 2004). Another damaging pathway is
related to the observation that SD ﬁrst causes depolarization of the
mitochondria, then a release of free fatty acids and the opening of
the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, and eventually
the activation of calcineurin, which plays pivotal role in ischemic
brain damage (Uchino et al., 2002). Blockage of this pathway was
shown to reverse post-SD hypoperfusion and prevented subsequent vascular dysfunction in the normoxic brain (Piilgaard et al.,
2011).
In our experiments, prolonged SDs and ischemic vasoconstriction appeared simultaneously; so, we cannot ascertain if the early
depolarization phase or the early ischemic response induced the
other phenomenon.
4.5. Different spatial characteristics of ischemic SDs in aged rats
The variable directions and shape of SD propagation with age
indicate 2 things. One, the typical straight propagation of SDs from
frontolateral to caudomedial regions of the brain in the young and
middle-aged brain indicates that SDs probably originate at the
border of a compact ischemic core area of the lateral MCA territory.
This is less the case in the old brains, where the high variability of
SD directions suggests that multiple SD foci in old rats are scattered
throughout the parietal cortex or there is an inhomogenous sensitivity of the cortex to SD. When SDs are curved or circulating under
the cranial window of old rats compared with the typically straight
direction of an SD in the young, then it is likely a consequence of the
SD deviating its path as it hits a region that has already been
depolarized (Nakamura et al., 2010).
4.6. Green IOS shows both SD-related optical density and
hemodynamic changes
Measurement of the green IOS helped to conﬁrm both the
appearance of SDs and the coupled hemodynamic responses. During a transient SD, the IOS trace showed an early sharp biphasic
wave simultaneous with the wave on the VS-dye signature followed
by a broader wave associated with the hyperemic response visible
on the laser-speckle recording. Prolonged SDs appeared on the
green IOS as a rapid increase in reﬂectance associated with the early
depolarization of the tissue followed by a further reduction
together with the hypoperfusion shown on the laser-speckle trace.
Green IOS imaging in the normoxic brain has been shown to primarily reﬂect blood volume changes accompanying SD and related
to an w100% increase of CBF (Ba et al., 2002). In the present study,
hypoperfused tissue during SD generated CBF changes 30%
together with a smaller simultaneous green IOS change than in the
healthy tissue, whereas the earlier IOS changes related to internal
tissue reﬂectance (e.g., osmotic swelling) were similar in magnitude
to the subsequent blood-volumeerelated changes. Therefore, IOS
recorded from the reﬂection of green (540e550 nm) light is a useful
tool to capture and characterize spontaneous SDs and coupled
hemodynamic responses emerging during cerebral ischemia.
4.7. Conclusions
RRSDs worsen ischemic stress on the brain tissue and expand
the injured area, most certainly negatively impacting the
outcome of those suffering stroke, the most susceptible population being the elderly. Characterization of such age-related alterations in neurovascular disease processes improves our
understanding of fundamental changes of the brain that occur

with senescence. In terms of disease progression, such information underlies the importance of considering the effects of age
when evaluating the translational aspects of new treatment approaches developed in animal stroke models and treatment
strategies in elderly humans. The vast majority of preclinical
neuroprotective studies were performed on young rodents, most
of which then failed at the clinical stage of testing. Our study
sheds new light on the importance of brain depolarizations
during early ischemic stroke suggesting the remarkable role of SD
in worsening and accelerating tissue ischemia in the aged brain.
We hope our ﬁndings will encourage stroke researchers investigating other pharmacologic interventions to perform their experiments in aged animals, where early progression of ischemia
appears to be drastically different from young.
