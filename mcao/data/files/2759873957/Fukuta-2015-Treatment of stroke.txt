a b s t r a c t
Since the proportion of patients given thrombolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is
very limited because of the narrow therapeutic window, the development of new therapies for ischemic
stroke has been desired. We previously reported that liposomes injected intravenously accumulate in the
ischemic region of the brain via disruption of the blood–brain barrier that occurs under cerebral ischemia.
In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of a liposomal neuroprotective agent in middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) rats to develop ischemic stroke therapy prior to the recovery of cerebral blood
flow. For this purpose, PEGylated liposomes encapsulating FK506 (FK506-liposomes) were prepared and
injected intravenously into MCAO rats after a 1-h occlusion. This treatment significantly suppressed the
expansion of oxidative stress and brain cell damage. In addition, administration of FK506-liposomes
before reperfusion significantly ameliorated motor function deficits of the rats caused by ischemia/reperfusion injury. These findings suggest that FK506-liposomes effectively exerted a neuroprotective effect
during ischemic conditions, and that combination therapy with a liposomal neuroprotectant plus t-PA
could be a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke is one of the high-mortality diseases and the
leading cause of serious, long-term disability worldwide [1,2]. This
event occurs when cerebral blood flow is markedly reduced by a
thrombus. This loss of blood supply induces cerebral cell death in
the ischemic area. Brain cells in the ischemic penumbra surrounding the ischemic core region are known to escape from cell death
when the cerebral blood flow is rapidly improved [3]. In clinical
settings, thrombolytic therapy such as tissue-type plasminogen
activator (t-PA) is approved for the treatment of acute ischemic
stroke [4,5]. However, due to the narrow therapeutic time window
(<4.5 h) and safety concerns such as the risk of cerebral hemorrhage stemming from t-PA treatment, the number of applicable
patients is very limited [6]. In addition, even when the cerebral
blood flow is restored by thrombolysis, secondary cerebral damage
known as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury often occurs because of
the production of deleterious substances such as reactive oxygen

species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines around the lesion area,
resulting in poor prognosis [7,8]. Thus, drug candidates for neuroprotection against I/R injury have been studied in clinical trials to
improve therapeutic outcomes. However, none of them have been
approved worldwide due to their insufficient efficacy or to undesirable side effects [9,10].
The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is functionally constituted to
maintain brain homeostasis by restricting the transport of molecules into the brain. However, it has been reported that the integrity of the BBB is compromised in the acute phase after cerebral
ischemia [11–13]. By focusing on this phenomenon, we previously
found that intravenous administration of a liposomal neuroprotectant immediately after reperfusion is effective for the treatment of
cerebral I/R injury in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(t-MCAO) rats [14,15]. In addition, we also demonstrated that,
under the cerebral ischemic state, 100-nm liposomes injected
intravenously into MCAO rats can accumulate in the ischemic core
and penumbra region by passing through the disrupted BBB
[16]. Imaging data on [18F]-labeled PEGylated liposomes
(PEG-liposomes) imaged by positron-emission tomography (PET)
show that such liposomes gradually accumulate in the ischemic
region despite a reduced blood flow [17]. From these findings,

2

we hypothesized that liposomal delivery of a neuroprotective
agent to the ischemic region might be effective for stroke treatment even under the ischemic condition. However, the effectiveness of liposomal neuroprotectants for I/R injury, which are
administered during cerebral ischemia has not been investigated.
Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the effect of a
liposome-delivered neuroprotective agent, FK506, injected before
the restoration of blood flow on I/R injury in t-MCAO rats. For this
purpose, we prepared PEGylated liposomes encapsulating FK506
(tacrolimus, FK506-liposomes) as a neuroprotectant [18]. FK506
has been reported to exert a neuroprotective effect in animal models of ischemic stroke by inhibiting the activation of calcineurin following excessive influx of Ca2+ into cells [19–21]. Our previous
study demonstrated that liposomalization of FK506 enables a
reduction in the dosage of FK506 and that FK506-liposomes
injected immediately after reperfusion might be useful for the
treatment of cerebral I/R injury [18]. In the present study, to examine the usefulness of administering a liposomal neuroprotectant
prior to reperfusion therapy, FK506-liposomes were injected into
t-MCAO rats before reperfusion.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), dipalmitoylphosphati
dylcholine (DPPC), cholesterol, and distearoylphosphatidylethano
lamine (DSPE)-PEG2000 were a gift from Nippon Fine Chemical
(Hyogo, Japan). [3H] Cholesteryl hexadecyl ether was purchased
from Perkin Elmer (Boston, MA); and 1,10 -dioctadecyl-3,3,30 ,30 -tet
ramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI-C18), from Molecular
Probes (Eugene, OR, USA). Dihydroethidium (DHE) and 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) were obtained from Wako
Pure Chemical (Tokyo, Japan). Other reagents were of analytical
grade.
2.2. Animals
Male Wistar rats (8 weeks old, 180–220 g) were purchased from
Japan SLC, Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). The animals were cared for
according to the Animal Facility Guidelines of the University of Shizuoka. All animal procedures were approved by the Animal and
Ethics Review Committee of the University of Shizuoka.
2.3. Middle cerebral artery occlusion rats
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats were prepared as
described previously [22]. In brief, anesthesia was induced with 3%
isoflurane (EscainÒ, Pfizer, NY, USA) and maintained with 1.5%
isoflurane during the MCAO surgery, with the anesthesia being
performed with a small-animal anesthesia apparatus (Model TK4, Bio Machinery, Chiba, Japan). Rectal temperature of rats was
maintained at 37 °C with a heating pad (Unique Medical Co., Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan). After a midline incision of the neck skin had been
made, the right common carotid artery, external carotid artery,
and internal carotid artery (ICA) were isolated. Then, the MCA
was occluded by inserting a silicon-coated 4-0 nylon filament (Keisei Medical Industrial Co., Ltd., Niigata, Japan) into the right internal carotid artery and advancing it to the origin of the MCA. Silk
thread was used for ligation to keep the filament at the inserted
position in the MCA. After the operation, the neck skin was closed;
and the anesthesia was then discontinued. In the case of preparing
t-MCAO rats, cerebral blood flow was restored by withdrawing the
filament about 10 mm under isoflurane anesthesia. Success of the
MCAO surgery was judged by the appearance of both hemiparesis

and an increase in body temperature to over 38 °C after 1 h of
occlusion. A sham operation was performed by following the same
experimental procedure without inserting the filament.
2.4. Preparation of liposomes
Plain liposomes composed of DSPC/cholesterol (2/1 molar ratio)
and PEG-liposomes composed of DSPC/cholesterol/DSPE-PEG2000
(20/10/1 molar ratio) were prepared as follows: Lipids dissolved
in chloroform were evaporated to form a thin lipid film by using
a rotary evaporator. The lipid film was desiccated for at least 1 h
under reduced pressure. The dried lipid film was then hydrated
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). The liposomal solution was freeze-thawed for 3 cycles with liquid nitrogen and then
sonicated for 10 min at 65 °C with a bath-type sonicator (Yamato
Scientific Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Finally, the size of the liposomes
was adjusted by extrusion of the particles through polycarbonate
membrane filters having 100-nm pores (Nuclepore, Cambridge,
MA, USA). Then, the particle size and f-potential of liposomes were
measured with a Zetasizer Nano ZS (MALVERN, Worcestershire UK,
USA). For preparing [3H]-labeled liposomes or fluorescence-labeled
ones, [3H]cholesteryl hexadecyl ether or DiI-C18, respectively, was
added to the initial lipid solution.
FK506-liposomes composed of DPPC and DSPE-PEG2000 (20/1
molar ratio) were prepared as described previously [18]. In brief,
FK506 dissolved in methanol was added to a recovery flask with
the above lipids dissolved in tert-butyl alcohol for freeze-drying.
After lyophilization of the solution, the lyophilizate was hydrated
with PBS at 50 °C. The liposomal solution was freeze-thawed for
3 cycles with liquid nitrogen. Liposomes were sized by extrusion
through 100 nm-pore membrane filters, and then the particle size
and f-potential of FK506-liposomes were determined with a Zetasizer Nano ZS. For removing the unencapsulated FK506, the liposomal solution was washed by centrifugation at 453,000g for 15 min
(Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). The FK506 concentration in the liposomal
solution was determined by performing HPLC (Hitachi). FK506liposomes were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran, and 20 lL of the
solution was injected into an octadecylsilane (ODS) column (TSK
gel ODS-80TM, 4.6  150 mm, Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). The mobile
phase was composed of acetonitrile and water (3:2 v/v). The HPLC
conditions were as follows: Column oven, 60 °C; flow rate, 1 mL/
min; and UV detection, 214 nm.
2.5. Biodistribution of liposomes in MCAO rats
MCAO rats were intravenously injected with [3H]-labeled PEGliposomes (74 kBq/rat; 5 lmol phospholipid/rat) after 1 h of occlusion. At 1 or 3 h after injection, the rats were sacrificed; and the
plasma and various organs (heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and
brain) were collected. The radioactivity in them was measured
with a liquid scintillation counter (LSC-7400, Hitachi Aloka Medical, Tokyo, Japan). The brain was separated into ischemic and
non-ischemic (normal) sides.
2.6. Intracerebral distribution of liposomes
Plain liposomes were labeled with fluorescent dye DiI-C18.
These DiI-labeled plain liposomes (5 lmol phospholipid/rat) were
intravenously injected into MCAO rats 1 h after occlusion. At
30 min after the injection of the liposomes, the rats were intravenously injected with 0.1 mL fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)conjugated tomato lectin (Lycopersicon esculentum; 1 mg/mL; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) to label the perfused blood vessels. After 30 min, the rats were transcardially perfused with PBS,
and then the brains were dissected and sliced into 2-mm thick
coronal sections with a rat brain slicer (Muromachi Kikai, Tokyo,

3

Japan). The brain sections were placed on glass slides, and fluorescence was detected with an in vivo imaging system (IVIS, Xenogen
Corp., Alameda, CA). Sections in which DiI fluorescence was prominently detected in the ischemic side were embedded in an optimal
cutting temperature compound (Sakura, Finetech., Co. Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan), and then frozen using dry ice-ethanol. These frozen sections were cut into 10 lm slices using a cryostat (HM505E,
Microm, Walldorf, Germany) and mounted with Perma Fluor Aqueous Mounting Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Yokohama,
Japan). Finally, fluorescence was observed with an LSM microscope
system (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).
2.7. Detection of superoxide anions in brain sections
FK506-liposomes (100 lg/kg as FK506 dose; approximately
2 lmol phospholipid/rat) or PBS was intravenously injected into
MCAO rats 1 h after the start of occlusion. At 1 h after injection
of samples (after 2 h of occlusion) or 3 h after reperfusion following
the 2-h occlusion, the brain of MCAO rats was dissected and sliced
into 2-mm thick coronal sections using a rat brain slicer. Then, frozen brain sections (10 lm) were prepared with a cryostatic microtome. The sections were incubated with 20 lM DHE in PBS for
30 min at 37 °C in an incubation chamber protected from light,
and then mounted with Perma Fluor Aqueous Mounting Medium.
DHE is oxidized on reaction with superoxide anions to ethidium
cations, which intercalate into DNA in the nucleus and emit red fluorescence. Finally, the sections were observed for fluorescence
with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany). The fluorescence intensity of DHE was calculated by the
use of LSM system software. The ratio of the fluorescence intensity
of the striatum and cortex on the ischemic side to that of those on
the non-ischemic side was calculated.

somes in the ischemic side of the brain was comparable to that in
the non-ischemic side at 1 h after injection, despite reduced blood
flow (Fig. 1B). However, by 3 h after injection, the liposomes had
significantly accumulated in the ischemic side compared with
the non-ischemic side. In addition, the liposomes in the ischemic
side had significantly higher accumulation at 3 h than at 1 h after
injection.

2.8. Therapeutic experiment
FK506-liposomes (100 or 300 lg/kg as FK506 dose; approximately 2 or 5 lmol phospholipid/rat), FK506 (100 or 300 lg/kg),
PEG-liposomes (5 lmol phospholipid/rat), or PBS was intravenously injected into t-MCAO rats after 1 h of occlusion. Reperfusion was then started 1 h after the sample injection. At 24 h after
the onset of occlusion, the brains of t-MCAO rats were dissected
and sliced into 2-mm thick coronal sections with a rat brain slicer.
Then, the slices were stained with 2% TTC solution for 30 min at
37 °C to assess the damaged brain area. The damage volume was
calculated with an image-analysis system (NIH Image J). In the case
of evaluation of motor functional outcome, the rats were tested by
a 21-point analysis at 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days after reperfusion, as
described previously [23].

3.2. Extravasation of liposomes from cerebral vessels into the ischemic
region

Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison tests.
Data were presented as the mean ± S.D.

We observed the cerebral distribution of liposomes injected
under ischemic conditions. The particle size and f-potential of
the
DiI-labeled
liposomes
were
114.9 ± 8.9 nm
and
2.57 ± 1.0 mV, respectively. The accumulation of the liposomes
in the ischemic region was detected with IVIS (Fig. 2A). Confocal
images showed that the fluorescence signal from the DiI-labeled
liposomes was present only in the brain parenchyma around the
ischemic striatum. In addition, the images also showed that the fluorescence signal from FITC around the ischemic striatum was
markedly lower than that around the non-ischemic striatum
(Fig. 2B). On the other hand, leakage of the liposomes from blood
vessels was not observed in other areas. In addition, FITC fluorescence in the ischemic cortex was lower than that in the nonischemic cortex in both the PBS and liposome-treated groups
(Fig. 2C). These results were consistent with observations of cerebral blood flow made with a laser-Doppler blood flowmeter (Supplementary Fig. 1).

3.1. Accumulation of liposomes in the ischemic region in MCAO rats

The particle size and f-potential of the FK506-liposomes used in
the present study were 109.0 ± 4.0 nm and 1.4 ± 0.7 mV, respectively. After 2 h of occlusion in the control MCAO rats, an increase
in the fluorescence of DHE, an indicator of oxidative stress, was
observed in the striatum of the ischemic side compared with that
in the striatum in the non-ischemic side (Fig. 3A and C). In addition, in the cortex of the ischemic side, a small increase in the fluorescence was observed compared with the intensity in the non-

occlusion. The results showed that accumulation of the liposomes
in the brain was significantly higher at 3 h after injection than at
1 h after (Fig. 1A). More specifically, the accumulation of the lipo-

ischemic cortex. Administration of FK506-liposomes during occlusion attenuated the fluorescence of DHE in the striatum of the
ischemic side, but there was almost no difference between the control and FK506 liposome-treated groups in the cortex of this side
(Fig. 3B and C). In the experiment involving 2 h of occlusion followed by 3 h of reperfusion, strong fluorescence was observed in
both striatum and cortex of the ischemic side (Fig. 3D and F).
Importantly, the fluorescence of DHE in the cortex of the ischemic
side was significantly decreased by the treatment of t-MCAO rats
with the FK506-liposomes (Fig. 3E and F).
3.4. FK506-liposomes suppressed cerebral cell death induced by
reperfusion

3.5. Amelioration of motor function deficits by the treatment with
FK506-liposomes
Finally, the therapeutic effect of FK506-liposomes injected during ischemia on motor functional disorder was examined in tMCAO rats. As a result, FK506-liposome-treated group (100 and
300 lg/kg as FK506 dosage) significantly ameliorated the motor
function deficits (Fig. 5). In addition, dose-dependent protective
effect was observed in the FK506-liposome-treated groups. In contrast, FK506 (300 lg/kg)-treated group showed no significant
improvement of motor functions compared with the PBS-treated
group.
4. Discussion

Next, the therapeutic effect of FK506-liposomes injected before
reperfusion on I/R injury was examined in t-MCAO rats. The rats
were injected with each sample after 1 h of occlusion, and reperfusion was started 1 h after the administration of the samples. Treatment with FK506-liposomes (100 lg/kg as FK506 dose)
significantly suppressed brain cell damage judged by TTC staining
compared with the damage seen in the control and FK506 (100 lg/
kg)-treated groups at 24 h after the onset of occlusion (Fig. 4).
Administration of PEG-liposomes had no effect on I/R injury. No
cerebral cell damage was observed in the sham-operated rats.

The major problems of t-PA treatment for ischemic stroke are
the short therapeutic time window and the risk of intracerebral
hemorrhage [24,25]. Based on the results of animal studies, several
researchers reported that administration of neuroprotective
agents, including FK506, before t-PA treatment has a possibility
to extend the therapeutic time window of t-PA and to protect
the neurovascular unit [26–28]. Despite the favorable effect of neuroprotectants in animal stroke models, such drugs have not yet
been approved due to the lack of evidence of sufficient efficacy

after 1 h of occlusion. One hour after injection, the brain of the rats was dissected (A–C) or reperfused (D–F). In the latter case, the brain was dissected 3 h after the start of
reperfusion. Then, frozen brain sections (10 lm) were prepared and stained with DHE. The fluorescence images of the striatum and the cortex of both hemispheres were
obtained with a confocal laser scanning microscope. The ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the ischemic side to that of the non-ischemic side was calculated (C, F). Data

and good safety in clinical studies [29–31]. Hence, DDS such as
liposomes has the possibility to become a hopeful strategy for
avoiding adverse side effects and improving drug efficiency in
clinical settings. Our data showed that the accumulation of
[3H]-labeled PEG-liposomes in the ischemic brain was significantly
increased 3 h after injection compared with that at 1 h. Interestingly, the accumulation of the liposomes in the ischemic side at
1 h was almost at the same level as that of those in the nonischemic hemisphere, even though the cerebral blood flow was
reduced by MCAO surgery. Furthermore, the leakage of the liposomes from blood vessels and the accumulation of them in the
brain parenchyma were observed only in the area under reduced
blood flow (Fig. 2). It has been reported that, from an early phase
after the onset of cerebral ischemia, BBB breakdown progresses
due to the disruption of both tight junction proteins and adhesions
among endothelial cells, astrocytes, and the extracellular matrix
[11–13]. Our results suggest that the BBB of the MCAO rats that
had been disrupted in this way allowed the injected liposomes to

leak into the brain parenchyma, and then these liposomes gradually accumulated in the ischemic region during the acute phase
of cerebral ischemia, due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.
Since continuous reduction in the blood flow of the ischemic
hemisphere was confirmed by laser Doppler blood flowmetry in
MCAO rats (Supplementary Fig. 1), the mechanism of liposomal
accumulation in the ischemic region is an interesting question.
Although the detectable depth of cerebral blood flow by laser Doppler blood flowmetry was approximately 1 mm and might not have
been deep enough to image the ischemic core region, the reduction
in the blood flow was also confirmed by immunohistochemical
analysis (Fig. 2). In addition, Tsuchidate et al. reported that cerebral
blood flow values for the caudoputamen on the ischemic side supplied by the occluded MCA were <10% of the those for this region
on the non-ischemic side, which region lies in the ischemic core
in MCAO rats [32]. It was also reported that ischemic insults
increase arterial pressure, which promotes the delivery of blood

after the start of reperfusion, the motor function of the rats was assessed by the 21point neuropathological score. Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. (n = 5–8).

flow to the ischemic region through anastomotic vessels arising
from adjacent arterial territories [2,33]. Considering these findings,
we speculate that our liposomes reached the ischemic region
through the slight blood flow from the occluded MCA or collateral
circulation from adjacent blood vessels produced after cerebral
ischemia.
In t-MCAO rats, treatment with FK506-liposomes significantly
suppressed the I/R injury compared with that with the same dose
of free FK506 or with the injury in the control group (Fig. 4). Notably, the TTC-defined damaged area was prominently decreased in
the ischemic cortex of the FK506-liposome-treated animals

compared with that area for the other groups, which finding is consistent with the results showing FK506-liposome-mediated inhibition of oxidative damage. Increased ROS production both during
cerebral ischemia and after reperfusion is one of the main causes
of brain-damage expansion, which increase results in poor outcome for patients with ischemic stroke [34]. It has been previously
reported that FK506 exerts an anti-oxidative effect against
ischemic brain injury [19,35]. In our study, confocal images
showed that treatment with FK506-liposomes suppressed the production of superoxide anions, one of the ROS, in the ischemic striatum at 1 h after their injection (2 h after occlusion). At 3 h after
reperfusion following the 2 h of occlusion, the treatment showed
a significant anti-oxidative effect in the ischemic cortex. From
these results, we consider that the FK506-liposomes were delivered to the ischemic region under the ischemic state via the disintegrated BBB due to the EPR effect, and that FK506 released from
the PEG-liposomes suppressed oxidative stress around the core
region during cerebral ischemia, and inhibited the expansion of
oxidative damage after reperfusion. Therefore, our results suggest
that treatment with FK506-liposomes would decrease the incidence of adverse side effects induced by t-PA treatment.
Importantly, FK506-liposomes significantly ameliorated the
motor function deficit induced by cerebral I/R at 7 days after the
start of reperfusion (Fig. 5). This effect appears to have been caused
by FK506, as we have previously demonstrated that empty PEGliposomes have no protective effect on motor function [18]. Some
reports indicated that 2 h of MCAO in rats results in a wide range
of brain death and difficulty in improving the ischemic lesion even
when cerebral blood flow is restarted [36–38]. Considering these
findings, we propose that protection of the brain by FK506liposomes at the acute phase of cerebral ischemia and following
reperfusion contributed to the improvement of the neurological
deficit in the t-MCAO rats. These results suggest that liposomal
DDS effectively delivered the neuroprotective agent FK506 to the
ischemic region and augmented the therapeutic efficacy of it and
that a therapeutic strategy using this liposomal DDS could be useful for the treatment of ischemic stroke before the restoration of

blood flow postischemia. This therapeutic strategy employing liposomal DDS would be applicable to various neuroprotectants and
might improve the usefulness of thrombolytic therapy by expanding the therapeutic time window of t-PA.
5. Conclusions
The present study revealed that PEG-liposomes injected intravenously into MCAO rats under ischemia gradually accumulated
in the ischemic region of these animals. Treatment with FK506liposomes before the restoration of blood flow effectively suppressed oxidative damage during the ischemic state and expansion
of the damage to the cortex after reperfusion. Furthermore, FK506liposomes significantly suppressed brain injury, and improved
motor function deficits after reperfusion. This is the first report
to suggest that liposomal DDS has the potential to become an
effective therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke before
reperfusion.
