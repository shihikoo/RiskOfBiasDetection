Abstract: The search to date for accurate protein biomarkers in acute ischemic stroke
has taken into consideration the stage and/or the size of infarction, but has not accounted
for the site of stroke. In the present study, multiple reaction monitoring using labeled
reference peptide (LRP) following laser capture microdissection (LCM) is used to identify
site-specific protein biomarker candidates. In middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat
models, both intact and infarcted brain tissue was collected by LCM, followed by on-film
digestion and semi-quantification using triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry. Thirty-four
unique peptides were detected for the verification of 12 proteins in both tissue
homogenates and LCM-captured samples. Six insoluble proteins, including neurofilament
light polypeptide (NEFL), alpha-internexin (INA), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2),
myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) and 2′,3′-cyclic-nucleotide
3′-phosphodiesterase (CNP), were found to be site-specific. Soluble proteins, such as
neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1
(UCHL1), and some insoluble proteins, including neurofilament heavy polypeptide
(NEFH), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), microtubule-associated protein tau
(MAPT) and tubulin β-3 chain (TUBB3), were found to be evenly distributed in the brain.
Therefore, we conclude that some insoluble protein biomarkers for stroke are site-specific, and
would make excellent candidates for the design and analysis of relevant clinical studies in
the future.

1. Introduction
Numerous studies have focused on blood biomarker discovery for ischemic stroke and a variety of
protein biomarker candidates have been identified [1]. However, the accuracy and reproducibility of
these biomarker candidates still need to be improved. The release of glial and neuronal proteins into
the blood varies according to the complexity and heterogeneity of lesions after a stroke. The plasmatic
levels of protein biomarkers have been correlated to age, genetic background, gender and predisposing
factors, such as infection and inflammation, as well as the stage and/or the size of infarction [2–5].
However, the site of infarction has not been considered as an important indicator in previous clinical
studies [1,6], and more effort is required to identify site-specific protein biomarker candidates for acute
ischemic stroke.
Accurate measurement of protein levels in infarcted tissue is a challenge because the weight of
tissue sample cannot be used for normalization due to its heterogeneous composition. Laser capture
microdissection (LCM) provides an approach to make normalization possible based on the area of
tissue sample, and thus it could become a new assay to assess protein distribution and stability in
infarcted brain tissues. Since 1996, traditional tissue cutting has been replaced by LCM for procuring
pure cell populations in a quick and automated manner [7]. In 2014, Subramanian et al. collected
the fluorescently labeled neurons from sections encompassing the rostrocaudal extent of the rostral
ventrolateral portion of the medulla by LCM [8]. In 2014, genetically labeled neurons from the
drosophila melanogaster brain were isolated by LCM, and the catapulted tissue patches were collected
on a reversed phase column, and analyzed using an on-column extraction (OCE) that was directly
coupled with liquid chromatography–multistage mass spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) [9].
Targeted proteins from LCM-dissected homogeneous cell populations can be quantitatively
analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using stable isotope dilution (SID). Bagnato et al.,
measured cytokines and growth factors in coronary arteries by MRM assay. Four 13C/15N-labeled
peptides for cytokines/growth factors were spiked into LCM-procured samples to complement the
shotgun proteomics approaches for low abundance protein identification [10]. In 2011, Guzel et al.,
measured preeclampsia-related calcyclin peptides using peptides with an extra glycine inserted
in the endogenous sequence as an internal standard instead of the heavy labeling method for MRM
assay [11]. Attempts have been made to quantify proteins of interest at a low cost. In 2011,
Zhang et al. developed a labeled reference peptide (LRP) method that uses a single labeled peptide as a
reference standard for all targeted peptides and measures peptides based on their un-normalized peak
areas for detected MRM transitions [12].
As indicated above, LCM followed by MRM using LRP (LCM–LRP) is an established tool for
screening site-specific protein biomarkers in both intact and infarcted tissue. By using LCM–LRP, we
can normalize the level of targeted protein by the capture area of LCM that remains the same for
infarcted tissue and intact tissue. The procedure used in the present study is summarized in Figure 1A.

We procured brain tissue samples from middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model brain by
LCM and measured proteins of interest by triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry using the LRP method.
Samples included infarcted brain tissue from zones 1–3 and intact brain tissue from zones 4–6
(Figure 1D). Thirty-four unique peptides of 12 proteins are verified and semi-quantified in both brain
tissue homogenates and LCM-procured samples. Reference peptides, with or without 13C and 15N
labeling, and maltose-binding protein (mbp) are added to all samples for quality control purposes. Peak
area ratios of each unique peptide in zones 1–3 and 4–6 were measured and compared, the distribution
of the corresponding protein evaluated, and site-specific protein biomarkers identified.

right middle cerebral artery were collected by LCM. The corresponding areas (zones 4–6)
in the left cerebral cortex were also collected as a control. The size of each area was
measured. Scale bar: 1 mm.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. The Focal Cerebral Ischemic Model in Rats
Most human ischemic strokes are caused by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), and
thus intraluminal MCA occlusion model in rat is the most common model of focal cerebral ischemia.

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16

In the present study, we established a permanent focal cerebral ischemia model by inserting a
monofilament into the internal carotid artery (ICA) to block blood flow to the MCA for 4 h, and then
grade neurological deficits of these MCAO animals by Longa neurologic score [13]. All MCAO rats in this
study are scored 2.0 (circulating to the left) and considered as successful focal cerebral ischemic models
(supplementary video 1).
The area of infarction after occlusion of the MCA is identified by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) staining, which makes infarcted regions white (Figure 1B). Size and location of the
infarction were determined by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (Figure 1C). Condensed, dead
neurons with eosinophilic cytoplasm and/or pyknosis are scattered throughout the spongy edematous
necrotic neutrophil. The swollen astrocytic processes are arranged in parallel. There is evidence of
infiltration by monocytes and macrophages, as well as their mitotic figures.
2.2. Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) of Intact and Infarcted Tissue in the Cerebral Cortex
To quantitatively analyze protein levels in the infarct region, both intact and infarcted tissue on the
same brain slice were collected by LCM at a low magnification (Figures 1D and 2). Coronally cut
fresh sections were stained with H&E and focal infarct areas in the right cerebral cortex were
identified. Based on both TTC and H&E staining, the cerebral cortex was divided into three zones, with
the outer layer designated as zone 1, the inner layer as zone 3, and the middle layer as zone 2. These
zones are supplied by the right middle cerebral artery before occlusion. The corresponding zones (4–6)
in the left cerebral cortex were also collected as a control. The total captured area of each zone was
10 mm2 (Table 1, n = 12).

25,952 ± 815.9 (Figure 3A, n = 72). The peak area ratio of RP versus RP* is 0.9959 ± 0.02496
(Table 2, n = 72), as compared to a theoretical value of 1.0000.

A total of 150 ng of maltose-binding protein (mbp, M.W. 42,481.902 Da) was added to all
samples and the peak areas of three mbp unique peptides (mbp-Pa: DVGVDNAGAK, mbp-Pb:
AGLTFLVDLIK, mbp-Pc: VNYGVTVLPTFK) were measured (Table 2). The peak area ratio of each
mbp unique peptide (UP) versus RP* (UP/RP*) indicates the amount of that unique peptide estimated
by LRP analysis. These values and the corresponding theoretical amounts for each mbp peptide, equal
to 150 ng × (M.W. of mbp peptide/M.W. of MBP), are shown in Table 2. For example, the estimated
amount of mbp-Pa is 3.182 ± 0.1818 ng, a value close to its theoretical amount of 3.336641 ng. The
standard errors of peak area ratios of mbp-Pa, -Pb and -Pc are all small enough to allow a reliable
semi-quantitative analysis of mbp protein (Table 2, Figure 3B, n = 72).

2.4. Distribution of Neurofilament- and Microtubule-Related Proteins in both Intact and Infarcted
Brain Tissues
After focal ischemia, blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability increases at the site of infarction or
the distant region of the ipsilateral cerebrum, allowing blood proteins such as albumin to cross the
BBB and enter the interstitial space, while glial and neuronal proteins enter the blood [14]. Biomarker
protein candidates, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), myelin basic protein (MBP) and
neuron-specific enolase (NSE) are released into the blood through the disrupted blood–brain barrier.
In this study, LCM-captured samples from zones 4–6 in intact brain tissues and zones 1–3 in infarcted
brain tissues were analyzed by LRP using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. Four neurofilament
proteins, including neurofilament light polypeptide (NEFL), neurofilament heavy polypeptide (NEFH),
alpha-internexin (INA) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and three microtubule proteins,
including microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and
tubulin beta-3 chain (TUBB3), were verified by their unique peptides (Table S1).
Unique peptides with the greatest peak area for each protein are highlighted in Table S1 and used
for semi-quantification of their corresponding proteins. GFAP is a monomeric intermediate filament
protein in astrocytes and its protein level in the serum reaches a maximum between day 2 and 4 after
acute ischemic stroke [15]. Serum GFAP is detectable within 6 h after acute intracerebral hemorrhage
(ICH) with a sensitivity of 0.79 and a specificity of 0.98 [16]. By LCM–LRP, we found that GFAP is
evenly distributed in zones 4–6 or zones 1–3 (Figure 4A,B), which suggests that the plasma level of
GFAP is not related to the site of stroke. NEFH is a major component of the intermediate filaments in
neurons, and it plays an important role in mature axons [17]. Our results indicate that NEFH is also
evenly distributed in both intact and infarcted brain tissues (Figure 4A,B), and thus not site-specific.
INA is the counterpart of GFAP in neurons and it may form an intermediate filament network with or
without the involvement of NEFL [18]. INA is believed to play a role in axonal outgrowth. Lower
levels of INA and NEFL were found in zone 4 than zones 5–6 , which indicates that more INA and
NEFL is present in the inner layer of cerebral cortex. MAPs and tubulin are major components of
microtubules, with MAP2 being found mostly in dendrites and MAPT in the axon [19,20]. In the
present study, more MAP2 was found in zone 4 than zones 5 and 6, but MAPT and TUBB3 were
evenly distributed in all areas of intact brain tissues (Figure 4C, Table S2, n = 12), and the distribution
pattern of these biomarker candidates was similar in zones 1–3 (Figure 4D, Table S2, n = 12).

2.5. Site-Specificity of Myelin-Related Proteins in Intact and Infarcted Brain Tissues
Myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) and 2′,3′-cyclic-nucleotide
3′-phosphodiesterase (CNP) are major constituents of the CNS myelin [21,22]. Hall et al. found that
39% of patients with acute ischemic stroke had positive test results for blood MBP on admission [6].
Jauch et al. found that the concentration of MBP increased at 24 h after treatment [23]. Our results
show that MBP, PLP and CNP were present more abundantly in zones 5 and 6 than in zone 4
(Figure 5A, Table S2, n = 12), and also more abundant in zones 2 and 3 than in zone 1 (Figure 5B,
Table S2, n = 12). In other words, MBP, PLP and CNP are all site-specific (Figure 5A,B). Therefore,
the location of lesions may have to be considered for future clinical studies.

Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is a glycolytic enzyme in neurons, also known as gamma-enolase
or enolase 2 (ENO2). Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 (UCHL1) is abundantly
present in all neurons [24]. Both NSE and UCHL1 are soluble proteins in the cytoplasm that are not
thought to be site-specific, and our results confirm that they are evenly distributed in zones 4–6 and 1–3
(Figure 5C,D).

2.6. Abundance and Stability Analysis of Protein Biomarker Candidates by LCM–LRP
Peak area ratios (UP/RP*) of 12 unique peptides in 5 µg of brain tissue homogenates were shown to
estimate the abundance of protein biomarker candidates (Figure 6A, n = 4). By LCM–LRP analysis,
we can also estimate the stability of proteins in the center of infarcted regions by the peak area ratios
for zone 1 to zone 4 (UP/UP, 1:4) (Figure 6B, n = 12). Peak area ratios (UP/RP*) of unique peptides of
NEFL, INA, GFAP, MAP2, CNP, NSE and UCHL1 in zone 1 were similar to those in zone 4
(Figures 4 and 5, n = 12), and their peak area ratios (UP/UP, 1:4) were close to 1.0 (Figure 6B, n = 12),
which suggests that these potential biomarkers are stable in the center of ischemic brain tissue. The
peak area ratios (UP/UP, 1:4) of unique peptides of MAPT, TUBB3, MBP and PLP were significantly
lower than 1.0 (Figure 6B, p < 0.05), which indicates that these proteins may be degraded at 4 h after
ischemia and are not ideal protein biomarker candidates. The peak area ratio (UP/UP, 1:4) of NEFH
unique peptide 1 is 16.275 ± 6.982 (Figure 6B, p < 0.01, n = 12), which suggests that NEFH protein
concentration is increased in the early stage of ischemia (≤4 h).

3.2. Animals
All procedures and use of animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) of Sun Yat-Sen University (Guangzhou, China; project identification
code, IACUC-2013-1204; date of approval, 13 December 2013). Three young adult male Sprague
Dawley rats weighing 250–300 g were obtained from Sun Yat-Sen University, and allowed free access
to food and water before all procedures.
3.3. Intraluminal Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) Model
Rats were weighed and placed in an ether jar until they were immobilized (n = 3), and anesthetized
with 30% chloral hydrate in normal saline (intraperitoneally), which was supplemented as necessary
during the procedure. Body temperature was monitored and maintained within normal limits with
a heating pad. A midline neck incision was made and the soft tissue pulled apart. The right common
carotid artery (RCCA) was carefully dissected free from the surrounding nerves (without harming the
vagal nerve) and a ligature was made using 5–0 string. The right external carotid artery (RECA) is then
separated and a second knot made. Next, the right internal carotid artery (RICA) is isolated and a knot
prepared with a 5–0 string. After obtaining good view of the right internal carotid artery (RICA) and
the right pterygopalatine artery (RPA), both arteries were clipped, using a microvascular clip. A small
hole was cut in the RCCA before it was bifurcated into the RECA and the RICA. A monofilament
made of 8.0 nylon (with a diameter of 0.26 mm, 40 mm in length, Beijing Cinontech Co., Ltd., Beijing,
China) coated with silicon hardener mixture (with a diameter of 0.36 ± 0.02 mm) is then introduced into the
RICA, until it stopped at the clip. The clipped arteries were opened while the filament was inserted
into the RICA to occlude the origin of the RMCA in the circle of Willis. The third knot on the RICA
was closed to fix the filament in position. The wound was closed with a surgical suture. Animals were
put in a heated cage for four hours and neurological deficits were evaluated, and then the animals were
sacrificed and brain tissues were collected.
3.4. Brain Tissue Collection and Preparation
Four hours after MCA occlusion, rats were anesthetized and perfused with 1× Phosphate Buffered
Saline (PBS) (n = 3). Then, animals were sacrificed and brain tissue was collected after 4 h of

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16

ischemia. Slices of fresh brain tissue, 2 mm in thickness, were stained with 1% TTC to evaluate the
size and extent of ischemic infarction in each rat. The rest of the tissue was embedded with OCT
compound and frozen at −80 °C immediately. Fresh-frozen and OCT compound-embedded brain
samples were sectioned (20 µm) on a cryostat (Leica, CM1950). Each section was placed onto PEN
membrane frame slides (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA), followed by H&E staining and LCM.
Sectioned tissue slides were immediately fixed in 70% ethanol for 15 s, placed in deionized water
for 30 s to remove OCT and rehydrate the tissue, placed in Mayer’s Hematoxylin for 45 s to stain
nuclei, placed in deionized water for 15 s to remove excess hematoxylin, placed in Scott’s Tap Water
for 15 s to change the hue of hematoxylin, placed in 70% ethanol for 15 s, and then placed in Eosin Y
for 3 s to stain cytoplasm. Then, H&E-stained slides were dehydrated in 95% ethanol for 30 s twice,
followed by dehydration in 100% ethanol for 30 s twice. Ethanol was then removed through a 3 min
bath in xylene three times.
After the tissue was air-dried, both infarcted and intact areas were microdissected with an
ArcturusXT system. The standard LCM protocol was followed [25]. Briefly, the tissue was cut using an
ultraviolet laser with 100% transmission. Specific areas were collected onto CapSure Macro LCM Cap
with the size of ~10 mm2 for each area.
3.5. On-Film Digestion
The film was carefully peeled off from the top of each cap and put into an Eppendorf tube.
Microdissected cells along with the film were lysed in 50 μL of trifluoroethanol (TFE)/50 mM
ammonium bicarbonate (1:1, v:v) and then sonicated in a water bath for 20 min [26,27]. Samples were
reduced with dithiothreitol (10 mM) at 50 °C for 15 min followed by alkylation with iodoacetamine
(20 mM) in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. The buffer was adjusted to 250 μL and tryptic
digestion performed at 37 °C overnight on a shaker. The film was picked out before the samples
were dried in a speedvac concentrator (Thermo SAVANT SPD1010, ThermoSavant, Holbrook,
NY, USA). The digests were resuspended in 0.1% formic acid. Each sample was spiked with
0.2 ng/μL APGLTQALNTK* and APGLTQALNTK before liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry
(LC–MS/MS) analysis.
3.6. Selection of Unique Peptides, Reference Peptides and Q1/Q3 Transition
Unique peptides for eight proteins were selected from the database of PeptideAltas and NIST
Libraries of Peptide Tandem Mass Spectra Global Protein Machine. Skyline software (version 2.6,
MacCoss Lab, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA) was used for the peptide selection. The
criteria of unique peptides were as follows: (1) the length of peptides is more than 7 amino acids;
(2) peptides containing methionine or tryptophan residues are excluded; (3) in peptide sequences,
asparagine followed by glycine or proline is avoided; (4) no N-terminal glutamine residues in peptide
sequences are selected; (5) uniqueness of selected peptides are confirmed by searching against Uniprot
rat database [28].
The reference peptides (APGLTQALNTK* and APGLTQALNTK) were chosen due to their strong
MRM transition signals, suitable elution time and low variability in peak area, which have been
verified in another study [12].

Three MS1/MS2 transition ion pairs were selected to verify a unique peptide, three of which were
applied to confirm a protein. Multiple injections of on-film digests were performed to match relative
intensities of target ion pair transition signals with those of MRM transition signals observed
previously in ion trap MS/MS spectra obtained from the database. Reproducibility of transition signals
between different runs was also examined to eliminate the false positive rates of proteins. Collision
energy and declustering potential were calculated based on the following empirical equation, which is
recommended by Skyline [29]:
For doubly-charged peptides, CE = 0.057 × m/z − 4.265

(1)

For triply-charged peptides, CE = 0.031 × m/z + 7.082

(2)

DP = 0.0729 × m/z + 31.117

(3)

MRM acquisition methods were performed with fragment ion-specific tuned Collision Energy (CE)
voltages and scheduled retention time. The dynamic MRM option was used for all data acquisition
with a target cycle time of 1 s, with a minimum and maximum dwell time of 17 and 333 ms
(60 maximum concurrent MRMs) and a 300-s MRM detection window for MRM transitions.
3.7. LC-Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) MS Analysis
A Shimadzu UFLC XR system (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA) was used
to directly inject 5 μL of digest samples onto a reversed phase analytical column (ACQUITY UPLC
BEH C18 1.7 μm 3.0 × 150 mm column). The column was mounted in an oven maintaining
a temperature of 65 °C. Peptides in each injection were separated using a 0.4 mL/min flow rate and
a gradient from 3% to 70% mobile phase B over a 30 min run time. Before each run, three-min
equilibration was set up. Mobile phase A consisted of 5 mM ammonium formate in 0.1% v/v formic
acid, and mobile phase B consisted of 5 mM ammonium formate in 90% ACN/0.1% formic acid. The
gradient method was adopted based on previous work as followed (time: % B): 0.1 min: 9% B; 3 min:
10% B; 13 min: 17% B; 13.5 min: 18% B; 13.6 min: 21% B; 16.7 min: 22.5% B; 19.7 min: 26% B;
21.7 min: 31% B; 22.5 min: 38% B; 23.5 min: 70% B; 26.9 min: 70% B; 27 min: 3% B; 30 min: 3% B.
MRM measurements were performed by an API 4000™ (ESI-QQQ) mass spectrometer (AB Sciex,
Foster City, CA, USA). The data was acquired and analyzed by AB Sciex’s Analyst software (version
1.6). The parameter settings during acquisition were as follows: 4500 V capillary voltage, a curtain gas
flow of 65 psi (Ultra-High Purity nitrogen), ion source gas 1 flow at 55 psi, ion source gas 2 flow at
55 psi at a temperature of 550 °C, an MS operating pressure of 3.5 × 10−5 Torr, and Q1 and Q3 set to
unit resolution (0.7 Full Width at Half Maximum).
3.8. Data Analysis
Prism4 (GraphPad Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) software was used for comparisons across different
data sets by ANOVA. “Mean ± SEM” was used to describe the variability within samples. p-values of
<0.05 were considered significant.

4. Conclusions
In summary, LCM–LRP provides a feasible approach for targeted quantitative analysis of valuable
protein samples, and is a very powerful tool of biomarker candidate screening and evaluation. In the
present study, we found that protein biomarker candidates, including NEFL, INA, MAP2, MBP, PLP
and CNP, are site-specific, but potential protein biomarkers, such as NEFH, GFAP, MAPT, TUBB3,
NSE and UCHL1, are evenly distributed in the brain. These findings provide useful information for the
design and analysis of relevant clinical studies in the future.
