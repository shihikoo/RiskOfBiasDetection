Background: We have recently shown neuroprotective activity of the creatine amides
in the focal cerebral ischemia in rats on the 280 mg/kg administration. In the present
study, neuroprotective properties of creatylglycine ethyl ester fumarate (CrGEt) in
rats with focal cerebral ischemia were explored in a wide dosage range (30-280
mg/kg, intravenous and intragastric). Methods: Focal cerebral ischemia was
induced by the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Results: The CrGEt
administration 30 minutes before and at the last 5 minutes of MCAO dose dependently attenuated cerebral ischemic damage on 35%-65%, reduced neurobehavioral
deficits, led to high neuronal survival in ischemic rat brains. The neuroprotective
activity of CrGEt was mediated by its following abilities: (1) normalize the energy
metabolism in the ischemic brains, maintaining adenosine triphosphate levels,
and reducing lactate concentration; (2) inhibit the ischemia-reperfusion–related
oxidative stress as evidenced by the increased activity of superoxide dismutase
and the reduced levels of malondialdehyde. CrGEt served as a substrate for creatine
kinase and a partial agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors; this partly explains
mechanism of its neuroprotective action. Conclusions: In view of the previously
mentioned results, CrGEt holds a promise as a compound for treatment of
ischemic brain disorders. Key Words: Creatine derivatives—cerebral ischemia—
neuroprotection—neuroprotective activity.

Primary brain damage during ischemia is characterized
by energy failure, overload of intracellular Ca21 and
Na1 ions, membrane depolarization, glutamate excitotoxicity, activation of anaerobic glycolysis, lactic acidosis,
and activation of free radical processes.1 Subsequent
pathologic processes cause cell death. The interval
between the primary changes and the secondary events
provides an opportunity for effective therapeutic intervention.2-4
Significant progress has been made in the prevention of
ischemic stroke and in the postischemic treatment to

restore the functions of brain cells.5 In contrast, therapeutic possibilities for acute ischemic stroke are very limited.6
In this regard, modern pharmacology seeks to develop
drugs that can be used for both the preventative and for
the acute phase of the disease. From this point of view,
substances that enhance brain energy metabolism, restore
the cerebral blood flow, and possess antioxidant activity
are of critical importance.
Our recent studies showed neuroprotective activity
of the creatine amides in the focal cerebral ischemia in
rats on the 280 mg/kg administration.7-8 In the present

Structure of creatylglycine ethyl ester fumarate (CrGEt).

study, we explored the neuroprotective activity of the
creatylglycine ethyl ester fumarate (CrGEt; Fig 1) in a
wide dosage range (30-280 mg/kg, intravenous [i.v.]
and intragastric) and considered possible mechanisms
of the pharmacologic action.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Adult Wistar male rats (13-14 weeks) were obtained
from the kennel ‘‘Rappolovo’’ RAS, St Petersburg. All
rats were housed in cages (4 rats per cage) under
12-hour light–12-hour dark conditions at 18 C-20 C, relative humidity 50%-70%, with food and water ad libitum.
All protocols were performed in accordance with the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals9 and
in agreement with the national regulations on animal
research in the Russian Federation.
After 14-day quarantine, animals were randomly assigned to treatment groups. The animals were weighted
(250 6 20 g) before the drug administration. The exclusion criterion was the low blood flow in the cortical
branch of the left middle cerebral artery (systolic
,20 cm/second, diastolic least 10 cm/second). The cerebral blood flow was monitored by MiniMax-Doppler-K
(MiniMax, St. Petersburg, Russia).

Drugs
CrGEt and creatylglycine were synthesized according
to the procedure described previously.10 The purity of
CrGEt and creatylglycine was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and was found to
be greater than 98.0% (.05% creatine, .66% creatinine, .82%
creatylglycine). Phosphocreatine disodium salt was purchased from Sigma (#P6502; St. Louis, MO) and used as
a reference compound.11 The compounds were dissolved
in sterile water.

Drug Administration
Intravenous injections were administered into the
lateral tail vein according to the standard procedures.
The injection volume was 5 mL/kg of body weight and
did not exceed the recommended values for rats.12
Neither adverse effects, nor pathophysiologic changes,
nor deaths of animals were observed in the all CrGEttreated groups.
The tail was warmed before performing the procedure
either by massaging it with warm, wet gauze or by

placing the animal under a heating lamp. A rat was
transferred into a holding device, and the lateral tail
vein was identified on either side. A fine gage needle
was inserted into the vein at about a 15 -30 angle to
the tail skin. The i.v. drug injections were bolus over
1 minute and infusive over 10 minutes. After removing
the needle, gentle pressure was applied to the injection
site with gauze for 1-3 minutes or until bleeding stops.
Intravenous administration was performed once.
Intragastric administrations were performed according
to the Manual of Stroke Model in Rats.12 A singlehanded restraint technique was applied to hold the rat.
The nose, head, and spine were aligned to keep the
esophagus straight. The needle bulb went over the base
of the tongue and gently down without resistance into
the esophagus. Once the desired position was achieved,
the drugs were administered in a volume of 4 mL per kg
of body weight. The procedure was repeated twice a day,
during 10 days.

Focal Cerebral Ischemia
Endovascular middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) was induced by the Koizumi method13 with
modifications according to Longa14 and Belayev.15 Operational interventions were made under anesthesia with
thiopental sodium (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). The
induced period of ischemia was 30 minutes, resulted in
more than 80% decline in cerebral blood flow. Period of
reperfusion was 48 hours.
Animals were excluded from the statistical analysis of
ischemic brain damage based on the following criteria:
(1) the blood flow in middle cerebral artery after ischemia
recovered to less than 80% of the prestanding baseline;
(2) subarachnoid hemorrhage; (3) carotid artery was
damaged during the surgery; and (4) severe inflammation
in the wound after the surgery.

Quantification of Ischemic Brain Damage
After 48 hours of the reperfusion period, animals were
decapitated. The brains were removed, after clipping of
the cerebrum cerebellum and olfactory bulbs, and
dissected into 5 parts to obtain standard front sections
with a thickness of 2 mm. Areas of the ischemic injury
were determined by staining with triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (MP Biomed; Santa Ana, CA)16 and were expressed as a percentage of necrotic area to the area of
damaged hemisphere.
Neuronal survival was evaluated by histologic
examinations of the brains 48 hours after ischemia.
Frontal sections of rat brains performed at bregma
(6.5 mm) were stained with toluidine blue according
to the Nissl method and used for immunocytochemical
reactions for neuronal nuclear antigen NeuN17 and
glial fibrillary acidic protein.18 The reagents were

purchased from Chemicon-Millipore (Billerica, MA),
Dako (Glostrup, Denmark), Biogenex (Fremont, CA).

Evaluation of Neurologic Deficits
Neurologic status of rats was evaluated by Garcia
scale.19 Maximum severity of defects corresponded to
the minimum score of this scale—3 points, the absence
of the damage to 18 points.

Quantification of Malondialdehyde
Malondialdehyde (MDA) content in brain tissue was
determined 30 minutes after MCAO according to the
Uchiyama method20 based on using thiobarbituric acid
(Sigma, #T5500).

Quantification of Superoxide Dismutase Activity
The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was assayed
30 minutes after MCAO spectrophotometrically (Cary
50; Varian, Mulgrave, Australia) at 505 nm using the
xanthine/xanthine oxidase method. The method employs
xanthine and xanthine oxidase to generate superoxide radicals that react with 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenol)-5phenyltetrazolium chloride to form a red formazan dye.

Incomplete Cerebral Ischemia. Quantification of
Adenine Nucleotides in Brain Tissues
Bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries in
rats has been established as a procedure to investigate
the effects of CrGEt on content of adenosine phosphates
in brain.21 Bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries of rats was induced by the standard methods.21
Briefly, in anesthetized rats (sodium pentobarbital,
45 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), both common carotid
arteries were isolated, and a surgical silk loop was placed
below the bifurcation for subsequent occlusion of the
arteries. Both common carotid arteries were exposed
through a ventral cervical U-shaped incision. The arteries
were separated from their sheaths and vagal nerves and
permanently ligated with 4-0 silk sutures. The induced
period of ischemia was 30 minutes.
Extraction of nucleotides from the brain tissue was performed 30 minutes after ischemia, according to the
method described by Grob et al.22 Briefly, immediately
after the occlusion, animals were decapitated, and brains
were placed in liquid nitrogen. After 30 minutes, the
brains were homogenized in 5 mL of an acetonitrile/
water mixture (4:6), precooled to 210 C. The homogenate
was centrifuged at 215 C for 15 minutes; the supernatant
liquid was filtered through a syringe polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter .45 mm and immediately
analyzed by HPLC according to the methodology
described by Nedden et al.23 The chromatography was
performed on a Zorbax Bonus RP column (3.5 mm,
3 3 100 mm; Santa Clara, CA) at 25 C and detection at

593

254 nm. Adenosine monophosphate, adenosine diphosphate, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) purchased
from Sigma (#A4659, #A2754, #A6419, respectively)
were used as standards. The amount of total protein in supernatants was determined by the Bradford assay,24 and
the calibration was performed with bovine serum albumin (Sigma, #A9511).

Quantification of Lactate
Endovascular MCAO was induced as described previously. Lactate content in brain extracts was determined
30 minutes after MCAO using the kit from SigmaAldrich (# MAK064). Briefly, immediately after extraction,
1 g of rat brain was homogenized in 4 mL of buffer. After
centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 minutes, the solution
was filtrated through a membrane filter Ultra-15 (Sigma,
#Z706345-8 EA) to remove proteins (molecular weight
cut-off - 10 kDa). Two mL of the filtrate were mixed immediately with the reagents and analyzed on Multiskan GO
microplate reader (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) at
570 nm, as described in the manufacturer’s protocol.

Creatine Kinase Activity Assay
The creatine kinase (CK) enzymatic assay was performed in 100 mM glycine buffer pH 9.1 at 25 C and in
50 mM TRIS-HCl buffer pH 7.4 at 25 C in the forward
direction, that is, the direction of CrGEt or creatine
phosphorylation, according to the procedure originally
developed by Tanzer and Gilvarg.25 The investigated
compounds were dissolved in glycine buffer or in
TRIS-HCl buffer right before the measurements and
mixed with the other components. The typical assay
mixture contained .14 mM NADH (Sigma, #43420),
1.0 mM phosphoenolpyruvate (Fluka, St. Louis, MO;
#79415), .6 mM ATP (Sigma, A6419), and 1.1 mM magnesium acetate (Sigma, #M5661), whereas the substrate concentration was varied from 14 to 200 mM. The
concentrations for the coupling enzymes were 144, 235,
and 14 units/mL for pyruvate kinase (Sigma, P9136),
lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma, L1254), and CK (Sigma,
C3755), respectively. In control experiments, an impact
of the CrGEt impurities on the rate of CrGEt enzymecatalyzed phosphorylation was estimated.

Stability of CrGEt in Artificial Gastric Juice, Human
Blood Serum, in the Presence of Trypsin
Stability of CrGEt in artificial gastric juice, human blood
serum, and in the presence of trypsin was estimated
by HPLC. The concentration of CrGEt in gastric juice
and human blood serum varied from 2 to 5 mg/mL. The
chromatographic analysis was performed on a Zorbax
Eclipse C18 column (3.5 mm, 3 3 100 mm) at 30 C, with a
mobile phase of .015 M sodium 1-octanesulfonate/
.03 M sodium diphosphate (pH 5 3)-acetonitrile (91:9,
v/v). The flow rate was .5 mL/minute; the detection was

at 205 nm. The products of CrGEt hydrolysis were identified by standard samples of creatine (Merck, #841470),
creatylglycine (CJSC ‘‘Vertex,’’ St. Petersburg, Russia;
#1.09.13), glycine (PRS Panreac, Barcelona, Spain;
#1413401209), and creatinine (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany; #105206).
The artificial gastric juice was prepared in accordance
with USP 37 (ed. 32) to contain 2 g/L NaCl (Sigma,
#P6887), 3.2 g/L pepsine (Merck, #EC 3.4.23.1), pH was
adjusted to 1.40 6 .05 by HCl.
Human serum was obtained from blood of healthy donors and fibrinogen, and other clotting factors were
removed by standard methods.
The trypsin (Sigma, #078K7020) was initially dissolved
in 1 mN HCl and, then, was mixed with 46 mM TRIS-HCI
buffer (pH 8.1, 11.5 mM CaCl2). Solution of CrGEt in the
same buffer was added to the trypsin solution to make
the CrGEt/trypsin mass ratio equal 1/20.

Immunocytochemical Assessment

Patch-Clamp Recordings
Hippocampal slices were prepared according to the
procedure described by Vorobjev.26 Pyramidal neurons
were mechanically isolated from the CA-1 region of the
slice by vibrodissociation.26 Measurements were recorded
in the configuration of ‘‘whole cell’’ with an EPC-7 amplifier (Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, England).
Transmembrane currents were induced by the L-aspartate applique (antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptors). Extracellular solution contained
143 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 10 mM Dglucose, and 10 mM HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 using
HCl). Pipette solution contained 100 mM CsF, 40 mM
CsCl, 5 mM NaCl, .5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM EGTA, and
10 mM HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.2 using CsOH). The
experiment and response recordings were controlled by
a personal computer. The experiments were conducted
at the potential of 280 mV in the absence of magnesium
ions.

Results
Effects of CrGEt on Ischemic Brain Damage and
Neurologic Status of Rats
Statistical analysis of ischemic brain damage and
neurologic outcomes of the animal groups are summarized in Table 1. The single i.v. injections of CrGEt solution
(280 mg/kg, 140 mg/kg, 70 mg/kg, and 50 mg/kg) 30 minutes prior MCAO reduced necrotic areas by 65%, 58%,
47%, and 35%, respectively (P , .05). The same dosedependent activity of CrGEt was observed on its injections during MCAO/reperfusion. The reductions in the
ischemic injury constituted 55% for the 280 mg/kg dose,
49% for 140 mg/kg, 47% for 70 mg/kg, and 33% for
50 mg/kg.
In addition, the neurologic deficit observed in the control animals 48 hours after MCAO (12.2 6 1.9 points on
Garcia scale) was markedly minimized in the CrGEttreated animals (16.6 6 1.1 points for 280 mg/kg and
15.4 6 .8 points for 140 mg/kg). Seventy-two hours after

MCAO, the neurologic status of rats, treated with CrGEt
in the 280 and 140 mg/kg doses, was restored closely
to the status of sham animals. Similar, but less prominent,
effects were observed on the CrGEt injections in the
smaller doses. The neuroprotective effects of CrGEt at
the doses 280 mg/kg (.84 mmole/kg) and 140 mg/kg
(.42 mmole/kg) were more pronounced than at the higher
dose of phosphocreatine (255 mg/kg, 1 mmole/kg).
Next, neuroprotective activity of CrGEt was examined
on its course intragastric administrations (Table 2).
In comparison with the control group, the ischemic injury
in the CrGEt-treated rats was reduced by 36% (30 mg/kg)
and 47% (50 mg/kg). In comparison with the control
group, the ischemic injury in the CrGEt-treated rats was
reduced by 36% (30 mg/kg) and 52% (50 mg/kg), respectively.
The saline-treated rats showed prominent neurologic
deficits 48 hours after reperfusion, 12.3 6 .1 pts. In
contrast, a course administration of the CrGEt led to a
substantial improvement of the neurologic status of rats,
namely 18% and 26% at doses of 30 and 50 mg, respectively (P , .05).
To confirm the neuroprotective activity of the CrGEt,
immunocytochemical assessment was performed immediately after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R; Fig 2).

As shown in Figure 2, the perivascular edema and the
loss of neurons were observed in the brain tissues of the
saline-treated rats, and an obviously smaller loss of
hippocampal neurons occurred in the brains of the
CrGEt-treated rats, particularly in those with dose of
70 mg/kg. These results confirmed the neuroprotective
activity of the CrGEt during I/R.

Effects of CrGEt on Energy Metabolism in Brain Tissues
Effects of the CrGEt on concentrations of high energy
phosphates and lactate content in ischemic brains were
explored (Table 3). A 280 mg/kg injection of CrGEt resulted in a preserve of adenosine phosphates, mainly
ATP, and led to the 1.4-fold increase in the brain lactate.
A similar single injection of the phosphocreatine before
ischemia did not contribute to the maintenance of high
levels of phosphates and ATP in particular (Table 3).
To explore the possible mechanism underlying the ability of CrGEt to normalize the energy metabolism in the
ischemic rat brains, interactions of CrGEt with CK, the
key enzyme involved in the ATP metabolism in brain tissues, was investigated. The enzymatic assay was performed in 50 mM TRIS at pH 7.4 and 100 mM glycine
buffers at pH 9.1. The CrGEt was substantially stable in

the solution under investigation, the enzyme–substrate
interaction, and the impurity content remained almost
constant during the assay measurements. The contribution of the CrGEt impurities on the rate of the CrGEt
phosphorylation was also estimated and found to be
insignificant, less than 3%, and was accounted in the Km
calculation. To verify the accuracy of the assay procedure,
a creatine–CK assay was conducted under the same conditions. The Km value obtained for creatine (10.0 6 .5 mM)
was in a good agreement with the published data.28
In Figure 3, the rate of phosphorylation of CrGEt by CK
was measured as a function of concentration CrGEt. The
reaction followed the Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The
found value of Km was 135 6 13 mM (n 5 2) in TRISHCl buffer at pH 7.4 and 123 6 11 mM (n 5 4) in glycine
buffer at pH 9.1 (Fig 3, A,B).

Effects of CrGEt on SOD Activity and MDA Content in
Brain
To further explore the mechanism of neuroprotective
activity of CrGEt, effect of the compound on the levels
of the brain antioxidant SOD and MDA, marker of lipid
peroxidation processes, were estimated (Fig 4).
In ischemic brains of the control animals, the SOD activity was decreased on 33% (from 47.75 to 31.91 KU/g
protein), compared with the sham-operated rats. Pretreatment with CrGEt in the 70 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg doses
enhanced the SOD activity on 69% (from 31.91 to 53.86
U/g protein) and on 41% (from 31.91 to 44.94 KU/g protein), respectively.
The MDA content in brain tissues of sham-operated
animals was 4.51 mM/g. Ischemia significantly elevated
MDA concentration by 44% (from 4.51 to 6.49 mM/g). How-

ever, pretreatment with CrGEt in the doses of 70 mg/kg
and 50 mg/kg remarkably leads to a significant reduction
of the MDA content in brain tissue, namely by 48% (from
6.49 to 3.39 mM/g) and 46% (from 6.49 to 3.5 mM/g), respectively, compared with the control group of rats.

CrGEt in Modulation of NMDA Receptors
Modulation of NMDA receptors by different compounds is widely explored for potential treatment of
neurodegenerative diseases and ischemia.29 In this regard, the CrGEt-to-NMDA receptor interactions were
studied in this work (Figs 5 and 6).
In the absence of glycine, CrGEt caused a dosedependent increase in the stationary component of the
response to 100 mM L-aspartate (Fig 5). Maximum potentiating effect was observed at the CrGEt concentrations of
300 mM. The maximum response of CrGEt was 75 6 5% of
the response in the presence of saturating concentrations
of glycine or D-serine (10 mM). Activity of CrGEt
(EC50 5 19 6 2 mM) was 25 times lower than glycine or
D-serine (EC50 5 .8 6 .1 mM). Thus, action of CrGEt was
analogous to the action of glycine, however, with the
lower efficacy and affinity.
The specificity of the CrGEt binding to the glycine site
of the NMDA receptors was studied next. In the presence
of both 10 mM glycine and 300 mM CrGEt, the response of
NMDA receptors was reduced by 15 6 5%, compared
with the response in the presence of glycine only. Thus,
modulation of NMDA receptors by glycine and CrGEt
was nonadditive. Moreover, the reduction in the intensity
of the response can be explained by the competition between glycine (a full agonist) and CrGEt (a partial
agonist).

Figure 3. Michaelis–Menten plot of the creatylglycine ethyl ester fumarate (CrGEt) and creatine kinase (CK) interactions in (A) 50 mM TRIS buffer pH 7.4 and
(B) in 100 mM glycine buffer pH 9.1. Data are presented as mean 6 standard deviation (n 5 4, n 5 2).

To further support the hypothesis, we probed the ability of 7-chlorokynurenic acid, the competitive antagonist
of this site, to prevent binding and action of CrGEt.
Figure 6 demonstrates that 7-chlorokynurenic acid inhibited the NMDA receptor response in the presence of
CrGEt. The inhibitory action of both .3 and 3 mM
7-chlorokynurenic acid was significantly smaller against
300 mM (21 6 5% and 55 6 8% inhibition for .3 and
3 mM 7-chlorokynurenic acid, respectively) than against
30 mM of CrGEt (42 6 6% and 89 6 7% inhibition for .3
and 3 mM 7-chlorokynurenic acid, respectively).
Taken together, the previously mentioned strongly suggested that CrGEt acts as a partial agonist of the glycine
site of the NMDA receptors.

Stability of CrGEt
The stability of CrGEt was tested in artificial gastric
juice, human blood serum, in the presence of trypsin
(Fig 7). The change in the CrGEt concentration was
assessed by HPLC.

The CrGEt decomposition halftime was about 18 hours
and 35 hours in human blood serum and in the presence
of trypsin, respectively (Fig 7). CrGEt was highly stable in
the artificial gastric juice, after 24 hours incubation at
37.0 6 .5 C, the concentration of the CrGEt decreased
only on 15%. Metabolites of CrGEt under the studied
conditions were creatine, creatinine, glycine, and creatylglycine.

Discussion
Our recent studies revealed the neuroprotective properties of creatine amides at the high dose (280 mg/kg
for CrGEt)7-8; the current work experimentally
confirmed that the CrGEt can manifest its activity at the
significantly lower doses. The i.v. and intragastric
administrations of CrGEt before ischemia as well as at
the early stages of MCAO resulted in a dose-dependent
(30-280 mg/kg) decrease in the area of ischemic brain
damage and in higher neuronal survival. The study also
showed that CrGEt not only acts as neuroprotectant but

also mediates functional recovery after the stroke.
The CrGEt administration led to dose-dependent
(30-280 mg/kg) reduction of the neurologic deficits and
restoration of the cognitive functions in the animals after
ischemia, as assessed by the sensorimotor tests.
The neuroprotective effect of CrGEt results from its
involvement in the key processes of the I/R pathogenesis.
Acute cerebral ischemia is firstly characterized by energy
metabolism failure with a sharp drop in ATP and accumulation of lactate.30-34 Here, we showed that the
neuroprotective activity of CrGEt was defined by its
ability to normalize energy metabolism under ischemic conditions. Even a single i.v. injection of CrGEt
30 minutes before ischemia promoted the preservation
of the ATP amount in brains 30 minutes after bilateral
occlusion of the common carotid arteries and the
reduction in lactate levels in 30 minutes after MCAO.
The stability of CrGEt in serum (rate of the hydrolysis—
less than 9% over 60 minutes) shown in our studies and

similar results by Garbati et al35 allows us to assume
that the observed change in the ATP production was
largely defined by the biologic action of CrGEt rather
than by the activity of its metabolites. For instance, it
seems that a part of the energetic benefits of CrGEt may
be related to its interactions with CK (Km 5 135 6
13 mM at pH 7.4).
In contrast to our studies, Garbati et al35 failed to
observe activity of 2 mM CrGEt in the CK assay. One potential explanation of this controversy is that creatine amides are characterized by the Km values greater than
100 mM (unpublished data) and, thus, the catalytic reaction can be detected in vitro only at the substrate concentrations significantly higher than 2 mM. However, such
high values of Km also suggest that CrGEt may be
involved in other biochemical interactions supporting
the ATP preservation.
Oxidative stress leading to the reactive oxygen species
production is also considered as a key mechanism underlying ischemic brain injury.36 In the normal cells, reactive
oxygen species can be neutralized by the antioxidant systems; however, in the ischemic tissues, this system is
greatly suppressed. In this regard, it was particularly
interesting that treatment with CrGEt inhibited the I/Rrelated oxidative stress in rat brains as evidenced by
increased levels of SOD, brain antioxidant, and reduced
levels of brain MDA amount, an index of lipid peroxidation.
Furthermore, CrGEt exerts neuroprotective effects
through NMDA receptor modulation acting as a partial
agonist of the NMDA-receptors. Partial agonists of the
NMDA receptors bind to the same site as full agonists
but induce less channel activation; at high concentrations,
they are considered as antagonists. Stanton et al37 showed
that compounds GLYX-13 serves as a partial agonist at
the concentration .1-1 mM, whereas at concentrations
10-50 mM becomes an antagonist and, more importantly,
delayed neuronal death in 2 different stroke models.
Similar, Gill et al38 explained protective effects of

(CrGEt) by two different concentrations of 7-chlorokynurenic acid (.3 mM [A] and 3 mM [B]). In both cases the inhibition by 7-chlorokynurenic acid is significantly smaller in case of high (300 mM) CrGEt concentration.

L-687,414 in a rat model of focal ischemia by the partial
agonist properties of this compound. Based on these
observations, we hypothesize that the CrGEt acts analogous, prevents the overactivation of NMDA receptors
and, as a consequence, suppresses mechanisms leading
to neuronal dysfunction and death.
Altogether, this work suggests CrGEt as a potential
compound for the treatment and prevention of ischemic
brain disorders. However, more research is required to
reveal other pharmacologic activities and pharmacokinetics of CrGEt and to further elucidate the mechanisms
of the CrGEt neuroprotective action.
