a b s t r a c t
Oxidative damage plays a critical role in many diseases of the central nervous system. This study was
conducted to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in the putative anti-oxidative effects of
sevoﬂurane against experimental stroke. Focal cerebral ischemia was performed via 1 h of middle cerebral
artery occlusion followed by reperfusion. At the onset of reperfusion, rats were subjected to postconditioning with sevoﬂurane or without sevoﬂurane for 1 h. Neurological deﬁcit score was assessed at
different time points after reperfusion. Cerebral infarct volume, oxidative stress level and the binding
activity of Nrf2 to antioxidant response element were assessed, meanwhile the expression of nuclear
factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), protein kinase B (Akt) and
phosphor-Akt was examined by Western blot at 72 h after reperfusion. Sevoﬂurane postconditioning
administration signiﬁcantly reduced neurological deﬁcit score, infarct volume and oxidative stress levels,
while increased the expression of phosphorylation Akt, NQO1, Nrf2 and the binding activity of Nrf2 to ARE
in middle cerebral artery occlusion rats. These neuroprotective effects were all suppressed by LY294002,
a selective PI3K blocker. Taken together, these ﬁndings provided evidence that sevoﬂurane postconditioning protects brain against ischemic/reperfusion injury, and this neuroprotective effect involves the
Akt/Nrf2 pathway.

1. Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability and mortality during perioperative period (Mandel et al., 2012). Most strokes are
due to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Reactive oxygen
species (ROS) generated after stroke in brain damage through different cellular and molecular mechanisms (Velly et al., 2009; Wang
et al., 2011). Therefore, the intervention of oxidative damage using
medicine with antioxidant properties may relieve or prevent diseases in which oxidative stress is the primary cause. Sevoﬂurane,
as a novel volatile anesthetic with minimal pungency, low solubility, and less toxicity, is a preferable clinical choice (Ebert et al.,
1998; Wilson-Smith et al., 2003). Recently, studies demonstrated

that sevoﬂurane preconditioning could induce ischemic tolerance
in the brain, and alleviate hypoxic and ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)
injury (Bedirli et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2007; Yu
et al., 2011). However, its clinical use is limited as ischemic episodes
are mostly unpredictable. The onset of reperfusion is more often
predictable. Therefore, the concept of postconditioning, through
modulation of reperfusion rather than ischemia, has been proposed, administration of volatile anaesthetics immediately at the
onset of reperfusion to protect organs from ischemia-reperfusion
injury (Huhn et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2006; Voigtsberger et al.,
2009; Zhao et al., 2006). Although the protective effects of sevoﬂurane have been demonstrated in the brain (Zhao et al., 2006),
the mechanisms of sevoﬂurane postconditioning against cerebral
ischemia-reperfusion injury is unclear.
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)
pathway has been shown to play a critical role in the mechanisms
alleviating cell damage (Gui et al., 2014; Kulik et al., 1997). Recent
studies conﬁrmed that this pathway was able to maintain and/or
improve the survival of neurons (Mannella and Brinton, 2006; Zhou

80

et al., 2010). Furthermore, the Akt-phosphorylation facilitated the
translocation of Nrf2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2),
its downstream transcription factor, to the nucleus which could
induce expression of genes encoding phase II drug-metabolizing
enzymes such as: quinine oxidoreductase1 (NQO1), aldoketoreductase (AR), hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) (Nishinaka et al., 2011;
Pecorelli et al., 2013). The induction of the phase II enzyme system can eliminate or inactivate a diverse array of electrophilic and
oxidative toxicants before they cause damage to critical cellular
molecules. It had been reported that sevoﬂurane postconditioning
protects the brain via PI3K/Akt pathway (Wang et al., 2010). Considering the neuroprotective effects of PI3K/Akt discussed above,
we hypothesized that sevoﬂurane postconditioning induced neuroprotection involves the Akt/Nrf2 signal pathway. This study
was designed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects induced by
sevoﬂurane postconditioning and studied the role of Akt/Nrf2 by
the modulation of these effects with a selective PI3K blocker,
LY294002.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental animals
The study was performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals published by the US NIH, and was conducted in accordance with
our institutional guidelines on the use of live animals for research. The experimental
protocol was approved by the Care of Experimental Animals Committee of TianJin
Medical University. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 280–310 g were used in
our experiment. The animals were allowed to acclimatize for at least 7 days prior
to operation and were housed on 12 h light:12-h dark cycle with food and water
available.
The design of protocol is illustrated in Fig. 1. Ninety-six male SD rats were
randomly allocated into 4 groups (n = 24, each): (1) the sham group, rats were subjected to sham operations without MCAO; (2) the I/R group, rats were subjected to
1 h MCAO followed by reperfusion; (3) the sevoﬂurane postconditioning (SpostC)
group, rats were subjected to 1 h MCAO, then post-treatment with inhalation of
2.6% sevoﬂurane for1 h immediately at the onset of reperfusion; (4) the sevoﬂurane postconditioning and LY294002 treated group (SpostC + LY) group, rats were
subjected to 1 h MCAO, then post-treatment with inhalation of 2.6% sevoﬂurane
for1 h immediately at the onset of reperfusion. In order to investigate the role
of PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway, LY294002 (25 nmol, Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), a PI3K
inhibitor, dissolved in 25% dimethyl sulfoxide and phosphate-buffered saline was
injected intracerebroventricularly (2 ␮l, bregma;1.0 mm lateral, 0.2 mm posterior,
3.1 mm deep) before middle cerebral artery occlusion according to previous describe
(Zhao et al., 2010).
At the end of the behavioral observation, the rats were euthanized under deep
anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and transcardiac perfusion
with ice-cold heparinized saline (1000 mL) was carried out. Brains were rapidly
removed and frozen until the followed analysis.
2.2. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model
Rats were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (35 mg/kg, i.p.). Focal
cerebral ischemia was induced by reversible intraluminal middle cerebral artery
occlusion as previously described (Haelewyn et al., 2003; Sasaki et al., 2009). In
brief, under an operating microscope the left common carotid artery, internal carotid
artery, and external carotid artery were surgically exposed. A 4-0 monoﬁlament
nylon suture with a rounded tip was inserted into the internal carotid artery through
the external carotid artery stump and gently advanced to occlude the MCA. A drop
in cerebral blood ﬂow of ≥75% was measured and maintained during ischemia by a
laser Doppler probe over the ipsilateral cerebral cortex. After 60 min of occlusion, the
nylon thread was gently pulled out and the external carotid artery was permanently
closed by cauterization. The sham operation was undertaken in a similar manner,
except the ﬁlament was not inserted. Rectal temperature was monitored and maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5 ◦ C using a electronic heating mat. At the end of the operation and
on postoperative days when necessary, all animals received 1.5 mL physiological
saline solution intraperitoneally injection to prevent postsurgical dehydration.
2.3. Postconditioning with sevoﬂurane
The rats were breathing spontaneously during exposure to sevoﬂurane in the
anesthesia plastic chamber (300 mm × 240 mm × 200 mm) based on a modiﬁed protocol used as described previously (Adamczyk et al., 2010). Sevoﬂurane was given
in oxygen (4 L/min total gas ﬂow) to the chamber from the volatilizer, the anesthetic concentration in expired gas was continuously monitored and maintained
at 1 minimal alveolar concentration (1MAC, 2.6%) with an infrared analyzer. All

animals were exposed to 0.0 (sham, 97.4% O2 /2.6% N2 ) or 1.0 MAC of sevoﬂurane
(97.4%O2 /2.6% sevoﬂurane) for 1 h. Rectal temperature was measured and maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5 ◦ C with an electronic heating mat.
2.4. Neurological deﬁcit score
Neurological deﬁcit score was evaluated at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after reperfusion
based on an eight-point scale. The score was 0 for no apparent deﬁcits; 1 for failure
to extend left forepaw fully; 2 for decreased grip of the left forelimb; 3 for spontaneous movement in all directions, contralateral circling only if pulled by the tail; 4
for circling or walking to the left; 5 for walking only if stimulated; 6 for unresponsiveness to stimulation and with depressed level of consciousness; and 7 for death
(Rogers et al., 1997).
2.5. 2,3,5-Tripenyltetrazolium (TTC) staining and measurement of infarct volume
The brains (n = 6, each group) were sliced into 3 mm thick coronal sections and immersed in 2% 2,3,5-tripenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma, St Louis,
MO, USA) at 37 ◦ C for 20 min. At the end of staining, color images of these
slices were captured using a digital camera (Canon EOS1100D, Japan). The size
of infarct was calculated with the Mias-2000 image analysis system (TianJin medical University, China). Infarcted areas of all sections were added to
derive the total infarct area, which was multiplied by the thickness of the brain
sections to obtain the infarct volume. To compensate for the effect of brain
edema, the corrected infarct volume was calculated as follows: corrected infarct
area = measured infarct area × {1 − [(ipsilateral hemisphere area − contralateral
hemisphere area)/contralateral hemisphere]} (Berti et al., 2002).
2.6. Determination of oxidative stress
After 72 h of reperfusion, the rats were deeply reanesthetized and executed.
Left cortical samples (n = 6 for each group) were weighed. Malondialdehyde (MDA;
Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) level and superoxide
dismutase (SOD) activity were measured as previously described (Jia et al., 2014).
Brieﬂy, MDA level was measured using the thiobarbituric acid method. The amount
of lipid peroxide was measured as the production of MDA. Absorbance was determined at 532 nm by spectrometry. SOD activity was measured using the xanthine
oxidase method. Absorbance was measured at 550 nm by spectrometry. All protein
concentrations of cortical tissue homogenate samples were determined with the
Coomassie blue method (Bio-Rad, CA, USA).
2.7. Western blot analysis
After 72 h of reperfusion, the rats were deeply reanesthetized and executed. Left
cortical samples (n = 6 for each group) were weighed and protein was extracted. The
samples were homogenized in an ice-cold Tris–Cl buffer, pH 7.4, 100 nM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 ◦ C for 30 min. Then, the
supernatants were collected as total proteins. Proteins lysates were separated by
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. This membrane was blocked overnight with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in
Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and detected with the primary rabbit polyclonal antibody
against Akt, phospho-Akt (1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
TX, USA), Nrf2, NQO1 (1:500, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, TX, USA). After
incubation, blots were washed three times in TBST and incubated with the secondary antibodies (1:1000, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, TX, USA) for 1 h
at room temperature. The blots were developed via enhanced chemiluminescence
(Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) and were digitally scanned (GS-700, Bio-Rad, CA, USA).
To quantitatively assess changes in estimated proteins, the appropriate bands were
analyzed by densitometry and quantiﬁed by computer analysis.
2.8. Nuclear extract preparation and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
Nuclear extracts were prepared according to a previously method (Wei et al.,
2005). Brieﬂy, the samples (n = 6 for each group) were trypsinized and suspended
in buffer A (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mM KCl, 0.1 m M EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM
DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF) (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). The homogenates were incubated
on ice for 30 min and vortexed for 30 s after addition of 50 mL 10% NP-40 (Sigma,
St Louis, MO, USA). The mixture was then centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 × g at 4 ◦ C.
The pellet was suspended in 200 mL ice-cold buffer B composed of HEPES (pH 7.9),
NaCl, KCl, EDTA, DTT, and PMSF, and 25% (v/v) glycerol and incubated on ice for
30 min with frequent mixing. After centrifugation (12,000 × g, 4 ◦ C) for 15 min, the
supernatants containing nuclear proteins were collected and stored at −80 ◦ C for
further analysis. For EMSA, 5 ␮g of total extracted nuclear proteins was incubated
with 1 pmol double stranded [␥32 P] ATP end-labeled oligonucleotide probe containing the sequences (sense strand, 5 -TTTTCTGCT-GAGTCAAGGTCCG-3 ; antisense
strand, 3 -AAAAGACGACTCAGTTCCAGGC-5 ) in binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH
7.9, 80 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2 , 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, and 10% glycerol). The samples were incubated, and then
loaded on a 5% TBE polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) and electrophoretically
separated in 0.5× TBE buffer. The gel was dried and exposed to X-ray ﬁlm at −80 ◦ C

with an intensifying screen. Levels of Nrf2 DNA binding activity were quantiﬁed by
computer-assisted densitometric analysis.

2.9. Statistical analysis
The score of neurological deﬁcit was analyzed using a non-parametric method
(Kruskal–Wallis test) followed by the Mann-Whitney U-test with Bonferroni correction. The others data were presented as mean ± standard error of mean (SEM),
statistical differences between the various groups were assessed with a one-way
ANOVA followed by Student–Newman–Keuls test. Signiﬁcant differences were
accepted when P < 0.05 (SPSS 17.0 for Windows).

3. Results
3.1. The mortality rate of our experiment
In our study, rat deaths occurred in the early ischemic reperfusion within 24 h. There were no dead in the sham group (the
mortality rate was 0), while there were two dead in the ischemiareperfusion group (the mortality rate was 7.7%) and the sevoﬂurane
postconditioning and LY294002 treated group respectively (the
mortality rate was 7.7%). There was one dead in the sevoﬂurane
postconditioning group (the mortality rate was 4%). The remaining
rats (24 rats in each group) were included in this study.

3.3. Measurement of infarct volume
The infarcted brain tissue appeared white, whereas the noninfarcted region appeared red. There was no obvious infarction
tissue in sham group. As shown in Fig. 3, a remarkably decreased
pale-colored region was observed in SpostC group compared with
I/R group (222 ± 8 mm3 vs. 303 ± 12 mm3 , P < 0.01) and SpostC + LY
group (222 ± 8 mm3 vs. 307 ± 10 mm3 , P < 0.01). There was no signiﬁcant difference was observed on infarcted volume between I/R
group and LY + SpostC group (P > 0.05). These results suggested that
sevoﬂurane postconditioning to attenuate infarction volume was
abolished by LY294002 in LY + SpostC group.
3.4. Sevoﬂurane postconditioning attenuated oxidative stress
As shown in Fig. 4, compared with sham group, the level of
MDA in SpostC group, SpostC + LY group and I/R group increased
signiﬁcantly, while the activity of SOD in SpostC group, SpostC + LY

3.2. Neurological outcome
As shown in Fig. 2, the neurological deﬁcit score ranged from
0 to 5 after 12, 24, 48 and 72 h reperfusion in four groups. There
was no neurological function deﬁcit in sham group. The neurological deﬁcit scores for the rats in Spost group at 6, 12, 24, 48 and
72 h after reperfusion decreased, compared with those in I/R group
(P < 0.05) and LY + Spost group (P < 0.05). The neurological deﬁcit
score had no signiﬁcant difference between I/R group and LY + Spost
group. The protective effect induced by sevoﬂurane postconditioning was abolished after administration of LY290042 in LY + Spost
group (P > 0.05).

with SpostC group, the level of MDA in the ischemia cortex signiﬁcantly increased in SpostC + LY group (P < 0.05) and I/R group
(P < 0.05), while the activity of SOD decreased in SpostC + LY group

group and SpostC + LY group (P < 0.01). The expression of P-Akt,
Nrf2 and NQO1 was signiﬁcantly upregulated in SpostC group at
72 h. The increased expression of these proteins was inhibited by
LY294002 in SpostC + LY group 72 h after reperfusion.

To investigate the molecular mechanism of neuroprotection
by postconditioning with sevoﬂurane 72 h after reperfusion, the
expression of phospho-Akt, Nrf2 and NQO1 in the ischemic areas of
the cortex was investigated using Western blot method. As shown
in Fig. 5, there was a signiﬁcant difference in the relative density of

EMSA showed that Nrf2-binding proteins were detected and low
Nrf2 binding activity was observed in sham group (arrow). At 72 h
of reperfusion, the Nrf2 activity was signiﬁcantly increased in I/R
group compared with sham group (P = 0.016), and the Nrf2 activity
was markedly up-regulated in SpostC group, compared with I/R

4. Discussion
In the present study, we found that sevoﬂurane postconditioning decreased infarct volume of brain, improved neurological
outcome, and inhibited oxidative stress after focal cerebral
ischemia-reperfusion injury in MCAO rats. Furthermore, this study
demonstrated that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a critical
role in sevoﬂurane postconditioning mediated neuroprotection in
MCAO rats, and the Nrf2 may also be involved.
Neuroprotective effects of post-treatment with volatile anaesthetics including sevoﬂurane have already been observed in both
in vivo models of global and focal cerebral ischemia and in vitro
models of neuronal cell-culture (Jeon et al., 2013; Zitta et al.,
2010). The 2.6% sevoﬂurane dose chosen was that which conferred
the maximal neuroprotective effects as previously determined in
ischemia preconditioning experiments (Payne et al., 2005). The
same dose was used in experiments performed during the reperfusion period for comparison. There were lots of standard of
duration of postconditioning could be conﬁrmed (2, 15, 20 min,
etc.) (Ye et al., 2012a,b; Deng et al., 2014; Obal et al., 2003). Based
on our preliminary experiments, we found it was more suitable
when sevoﬂurane was administrated with 1 h. The actual reason for
the variation was unclear, but most likely was due to the different
laboratory animals and different experimental conditions. Previous study found that sevoﬂurane postconditioning not only could
improve motor coordination but also reduced cerebral infarct volume until 72 h after reperfusion (Adamczyk et al., 2010). Therefore,
the ﬁnal assessments for neurological and histological outcomes
were performed at 72 h after reperfusion.
MCAO model in rats is used extensively to study neurological,
biochemical and histopathological changes. In the present study,
we assessed the neurological function deﬁcit at 12, 24, 48 and

72 h after reperfusion. We found that the brain I/R of rats showed
signiﬁcant damage characterized by the increased infarct volume
of brain and neurological function deﬁcit, which is in accordance
with previous studies (Rogers et al., 1997). In addition, cerebral
oedema plays an important role on the severity of motor deﬁcit as
a relationship has been demonstrated between brain oedema and
motor deﬁcits in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia (Tominaga
and Ohnishi, 1989). In the present study, sevoﬂurane treatment
resulted in a signiﬁcant improvement of neurological deﬁcits and
decreased of cerebral infarct volume in MACO rats. However, the
beneﬁcial effects of sevoﬂurane postconditioning were abolished
by LY294002 in SpostC + LY group. These data indicated that the
PI3K/Akt pathway involved in the neuroprotection of sevoﬂurane
postconditioning.
The pathophysiology of stoke is complicated, and oxidative
stress is suggested to be one of the major causes. Previous studies found that the intracellular calcium overload during organic
the ischemia-reperfusion injury could cause mitochondria dysfunction, which act as a major source of reactive oxygen species.
Burst of ROS generation induced by intracellular calcium overload
results in a cascade of ROS-induced ROS release, which are involved
in mitochondrial mediated cell death (Pandya et al., 2013; Kojima
et al., 2013). It is well known that MDA is a commonly measured
end point of ROS-induced lipid peroxidation, and its concentration
usually reﬂects the total level of lipid peroxidation. Meanwhile,
the detrimental effects of ROS are countered by the antioxidant
enzymes SOD. In the present study, we found that the decrease
of oxidative damage and the increase of endogenous anti-oxidant
enzymatic activities in ischemic brain tissue might attribute to
the protection of sevoﬂurane treatment, which is similar to the
results in previous studies (Wang et al., 2011; Sedlic et al., 2009).
Quenching of free radicals induced by Ca2+ overload may be one of
the mechanisms for counteracting oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity by sevoﬂurane postconditioning. NQO1, as a detoxifying
enzyme, is generally considered to have the ability to scavenge

B. Li et al. / Int. J. Devl Neuroscience 38 (2014) 79–86

superoxide anion radicals, prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species and reduce quinone compound (Lim et al., 2008). NQO1
can be induced by many stimulis including oxidative stress and
electrophilic metabolites, and its induction is considered to be
transcriptionally regulated by ARE (Dinkova-Kostova and Talalay,
2010). This study demonstrated that sevoﬂurane postconditioning increased the transcription level of NQO1 and the addition of
LY294002 (signaling inhibitor for PI3K) reduced the NQO1 expression. These data indicated that up-regulation NQO1 expression
in ischemic brain tissue by sevoﬂurane postconditioning required
activation of the PI3-K/Akt pathway.
Although the antioxidative molecular mechanism of sevoﬂurane is unclear, recent studies have found that sevoﬂurane induces
the expression of HO-1 in vivo through a PI3K/Akt, and Nrf2 is the
major transcription factor that binds to and activates the expression of these ARE-mediated gene products (Ye et al., 2012a,b).
LY294002 (a PI3K/Akt inhibitior) was administrated in order to
verify whether sevoﬂurane postconditioning inhibited oxidative
stress and up-regulated the expression of NQO1 after focal cerebral
ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats via PI3K/Akt pathway involving
Nrf2. Moreover, EMSA was applied to assess Nrf2-binding activity,
the results of which indicated that sevoﬂurane postconditioning
can induce the binding of Nrf2 to ARE in MCAO rats. Our results
supported an important role of the PI3K/Akt pathway involving
Nrf2 in sevoﬂurane postconditioning mediated neuroprotection
against cerebral ischemic-reperfusion injury. The phosphorylation
of Akt increased obviously at 72 h after ischemia-reperfusion. The
phosphorylation of Akt is also an essential component in inducing
neuroprotection by other well-characterized mechanisms, as p-Akt
levels are enhanced after a variety of protective agents, including
insulin-like growth factor-1,erythropoiet (Kilic et al., 2005; Yune
et al., 2008). Akt was necessary for the neuroprotective effects of the
aforementioned agents, because blocking the PI3K/Akt signaling
pathway abolished their neuroprotective effects.
The neuroprotective mechanisms of Akt may involve activation
of a set of transcription factors, including Nrf2, which is considered
to be a multi-organ protector and is widely viewed as a mediator of
neuroprotection by up-regulating the expression of many detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes under oxidative stress (Ye et al.,
2014). As a major transcription factor, Nrf2 binds to and activates
the expression of these ARE-mediated gene products (Itoh et al.,
2014). In this study, the expression of phospho-Akt and NQO1 was
up-regulated remarkably in MCAO rats following treatment with
sevoﬂurane postconditioning, and this up-regulation was accompanied by increase in the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and in the
DNA-binding of Nrf2 to the ARE sequence. These results provide
evidence that activation of Nrf2 by administration of sevoﬂurane
postconditioning was a potential mechanism for neuroprotection
after MCAO. The present study has demonstrated up-regulation
of NQO1 expression mediated by PI3K/Akt and showed that Nrf2
is involved in the neuroprotective effects of sevoﬂurane against
oxidative damage at a relevant time point. Further studies should
investigate whether other signaling pathways also involve the
antioxidative effects of sevoﬂurane postconditioning.

5. Conclusion
In conclusion, data from this study demonstrates neuroprotective properties of sevoﬂurane postconditioning reduces the volume
of cerebral infarct and improves neurological function. This neuroprotection appears to be mediated by the PI3K/Akt pathway
involving Nrf2. Although the relationship between Akt/Nrf2 pathway and sevoﬂurane postconditioning needs to be clariﬁed through
further studies, a focus should be kept on Nrf2 which seem to play
a crucial role in neuroprotection.
