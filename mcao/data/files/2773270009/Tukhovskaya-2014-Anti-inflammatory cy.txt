It is suggested that anti-inﬂammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) mediates the delayed protective
effects through activation of Jak-Stat3, PI3K-Akt and NF-␬B signaling pathways. However, our previous
experiments have demonstrated that IL-10 is capable to exert the rapid neuroprotective action through
modulation of hypoxia-induced intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+ ]i ) response. The ﬁrst purpose of the present
study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of IL-10 using three models of the ischemic insults
in rats: permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, ischemia in acute hippocampal slices in vitro and
ischemia in cultured hippocampal cells in vitro. The second purpose of the study was to elucidate a
role of [Ca2+ ]i changes in the mechanisms underlying IL-10 elicited protection of neurons and astrocytes
from ischemia-induced death in cultures of primary hippocampal cells. The data presented here shown
that anti-inﬂammatory cytokine IL-10 is capable to induce a resistance of the brain cells to ischemiaevoked damages in in vivo and in vitro models of the ischemic insults in rats. This protective effect in
cultured hippocampal cells is developed rapidly after application of IL-10 and strongly associated with
the IL-10 elicited elimination of [Ca2+ ]i response to ischemia. Thus, our results provide the evidence
that anti-inﬂammatory cytokine IL-10, in addition to an activation of the canonical signaling pathways,
is capable to exert the rapid neuroprotective effects through transcription-independent modulation of
ischemia-induced intracellular Ca2+ responses in the brain cells.

1. Introduction
Inﬂammation is a mechanism that enables the body to build
up a defensive attack against bacteria and viruses, but in certain circumstances it becomes chronic and pro-inﬂammatory

immunomodulators attack healthy cells and lead to their permanent damages.
In particular, inﬂammation, which is fostered by both residential glial cells and blood-circulating immune cells can evolve into
a destructive reaction in the ischemic brain [1,17]. Under the normal conditions there is a balance between pro-inﬂammatory and
anti-inﬂammatory cytokines. However, increased production of
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines has been observed in experimental
models of brain ischemia as well as in patients with acute stroke
[3,18] and may be associated with large cerebral infarct volume

and poor stroke outcome [15,34]. It has been suggested that the
major pro-inﬂammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a pathogenetic inﬂammatory mediator of ischemic brain damage [37].
Pro-inﬂammatory cytokines IL-1␤, IL-6 and TNF-␣ are rapidly produced and released by microglia and astrocytes in experimental
models of brain ischemia and in patients with acute stroke [15,30].
It is known that IL-1 beta enhances NMDA-induced [Ca2+ ]i increases
in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, and this effect was
abolished by IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) [35].
In contrast, anti-inﬂammatory cytokines counteract the proinﬂammatory molecules and provide a negative feedback mechanism to limit production of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines in ischemic
stroke [15]. Interleukin-10 (IL-10), a pluripotent anti-inﬂammatory
cytokine, has been shown to provide beneﬁcial effects in the
apoptotic population of serum-deprived retinal ganglion cells [6],
trophic support and survival cues to overcome the neurotoxic
effects of glutamate in primary neurons in culture [38] and a
resistance to global and focal brain ischemia [8,25,26]. The mechanisms of IL-10 induced neuroprotection are not clear. Our previous
experiments have demonstrated that anti-inﬂammatory cytokines,
TGF-␤1 and IL-10, exert anti-hypoxic action and abolish posthypoxic hyperexcitability in the rat hippocampal slice neurons [16].
Moreover, we have shown that IL-10 is capable to abolish Ca2+
release from InsP3 -sensitive internal stores induced by repeated
NMDA receptor activation with brief hypoxia in hippocampal neurons [32], and this elimination of Ca2+ release is correlated with
protection of cultured GABAergic neurons from hypoxia-induced
death [33]. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether ischemia-induced
[Ca2+ ]i changes is the target of the neuroprotective action of IL-10
in the brain cells.
The ﬁrst purpose of the present study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of IL-10 using three models of the ischemic insults
in rats: permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, ischemia in
acute hippocampal slices in vitro and ischemia in cultured hippocampal cells in vitro. The second purpose of the study was to
elucidate a role of [Ca2+ ]i changes in the mechanisms underlying
IL-10-elicited protection of neurons and astrocytes from ischemiainduced death in cultures of primary hippocampal cells.
2. Material and methods
The use of animals was in accordance with the EU Directive
2010/63/EU.
2.1. Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
procedure
Sprague-Dawley male rats (n = 11, 300–340 g) (The Animals
Breeding Center, Pushchino, Russia) were maintained on 12-h
light/dark schedule, with food available ad libitum. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Branch of Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Institute
of Bioorganic Chemistry Russian Academy of Sciences. Animals
were anesthetized with a Zoletil® 100-xylazine mixture (5 mg/kg
Zoletil® 100 and 12 mg/kg xylazine, 1.2 ml/kg, i.m.). The MCAO procedure has been described in details previously [4,31]. Brieﬂy, a
laser Doppler ﬂow probe was attached to the temporal bone to
measure regional cerebrovascular blood ﬂow (rCBF). The intraluminal suture was inserted through a small puncture opening in
the external carotid artery and advanced into the internal carotid
artery to approximately 18 mm from the bifurcation until slight
resistance was felt. When decreased blood ﬂow was observed, the
occlusion suture was left in place. Ischemia was conﬁrmed by a
decrease of rCBF greater than 70% from the baseline value. After
60 min of MCAO onset, the catheter was inserted into jugular vein

for administration of 5 ␮g/200 ␮l of IL-10 (per animal) or vehicle
(0.9% NaCl, 200 ␮l).
2.2. Infarct volume analysis
After 6 h after MCAO onset, animals were euthanized with
CO2 inhalation. Brain slices were prepared and incubated in
phosphate-buffered saline with TTC (1%) at 37 ◦ C for 25 min [14].
Slices were placed into formaldehyde buffered solution (pH = 7.4)
for three days. Then, stained and ﬁxed brain sections were
scanned and processed with a 3D-reconstruction program “Reconstruct” (http://synapses.bu.edu/tools/download.htm). The volumes
of both hemispheres were calculated with the Cavalieri method
[11]. The infarct area was calculated as difference between the area
of the uninjured contralateral hemisphere and the intact area of the
injured ipsilateral hemisphere (in % from the contralateral hemisphere volume) [29]. Infarct size was analyzed using nonparametric
Mann-Whitney U-test in program package Statistica for Windows
7.0. All the values presented as mean ± SEM.
2.3. The hippocampal slice method
This method has been described in details previously [16].
Brieﬂy, all experiments were carried out with male Wistar or
Spraque-Dawley rats (60–70 days old; n = 21). Transverse hippocampal slices (250–300 ␮m thick) were prepared with a tissue
chopper and placed into a recording chamber. Slices were superfused at 2.5 ml/min with the artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid (ACSF)
maintained at 32 ◦ C. The ACSF composition was (mM): 124 NaCl,
3 KCl, 1.25 KH2 PO4 , 2 MgSO4 , 2 CaCl2 , 26 NaHCO3 , 10 d-glucose,
pH 7.4. The solution was bubbled with 95% O2 /5% CO2 . Population spikes (PSs) of CA1 pyramidal neurons in stratum pyramidal
were recorded with glass microelectrode (2–5 M) in response
to electrical stimulation (0.1 ms, 50–350 ␮A) of Schaffer collaterals. Three ischemic episodes (3 min duration each with the 10 min
interval) were produced by replacing glucose with sucrose and bubbling with 95% N2 /5% CO2 (oxygen-glucose deprivation, OGD). The
depressive effect of ischemic episode (Ti , in seconds) was evaluated by employing the following formula: Ti = Tri − Tdi , where Tri is

the time point of 50% recovery of PS amplitude, and Tdi is the time
point of 50% depression of PS amplitude. All electrophysiological
data were digitized at 20 kHz and analyzed using a computer with
software developed in house for the measurements of PS amplitude
and the number of PSs in the PS response. IL-10 was applied for
10 min before and together with ischemic episodes. All values are
given as mean ± SEM. Data were statistically compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by multiple-comparisons tests
(Scheffe’s test) or non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test and were
considered signiﬁcantly different at p ≤ 0.05. Excel 2002 and Statistica Basic softwares were used for statistics and generation of
graphs.
2.4. The induction of OGD in cultures of primary hippocampal
cells
The method of rat hippocampal cell culture preparation has
been described in details previously [32]. Ischemia-like conditions
were obtained by omitting glucose (HBSS medium without glucose) and by displacing dissolved oxygen with nitrogen or argon
in the special vacuum system. The level of oxygen in the medium
was measured using a Clark electrode. Oxygen tensions reached
30–40 mmHg within 20 min after displacing in the vacuum system.
Ischemia-like conditions lasting 15 min were created via supplying
the OGD-medium into the cultured hippocampal cells. Constant
argon feed into the experimental chamber was used to prevent the

E.A. Tukhovskaya et al. / Neuroscience Letters 571 (2014) 55–60

contact of the OGD-medium with the atmospheric air. The effects of
OGD on neurons and astrocytes were evaluated by measuring the
amplitude of cell [Ca2+ ]i response and assessment of cell viability
before and after ischemia-like conditions.
2.5. Measurement of free [Ca2+ ]i concentration
To measure the cytosolic free [Ca2+ ]i concentration, we used Carl
Zeiss Cell Observer on the basis of an inverted motorized microscope Axiovert 200M with a high-speed monochrome CCD-camera
AxioCam HSm and a high-speed light ﬁlter replacing system, Ludl
МAC5000. [Ca2+ ]i responses to OGD were recorded with double
wavelength ﬂuorescent probe Fura-2. During image processing, the
[Ca2+ ]i response amplitudes of Fura-2 loaded cells were expressed
as the ratio of ﬂuorescence intensities of Fura-2 upon excitation at
wave lengths 340 and 380 nm. ImageJ and Origin 8 software packages were used for data processing, graph creation and statistical
analysis. All values are given as mean ± SEM. The data were statistically compared using t-test and were considered signiﬁcantly
different at p ≤ 0.05. To discriminate the neurons and astrocytes,
short-term application of 35 mM KCl was used.
2.6. Assessment of cell viability
Cell death induced by OGD was assessed by propidium iodide
(PI, 1 ␮M/ml) before and after OGD in the same microscopic ﬁeld.
Since PI stains both dead astrocytes and neurones, analysis of [Ca2+ ]i
signals upon 35 mM KCl application before OGD was used to identify the type of the cell. Neurons were identiﬁed due to the transient
calcium signal upon KCl application. Each experiment was repeated
three or more times using separate cultures. All values are given as
mean ± SEM. ImageJ and Origin 8 software packages were used for
data processing, graph creation and statistical analysis.
2.7. Reagents
Hank’s medium (Paneco, Russia); 2.5% trypsin solution (Sigma,
USA); poly-l-lysine (Sigma, USA); l-glutamine (Sigma, USA); KCl
(Chimmed, Russia); 4% gentamicin (Dalhimfarm, Russia); versene
(Paneco, Russia); neurobasal medium (Gibco, USA); B-27 supplement (Invitrogen, USA); fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA);
fura-2AM (Invitrogen, USA); propidium iodide (Invitrogen, USA);
interleukin-10 (PeproTech, USA); DMEM (Sigma, USA); triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) buffered solution (Sigma, USA); formalin
buffered solution (Thermo scientiﬁc, Germany); Zoletil® 100 (Virbac, France); rometare (xylazine) (Bioveta, a.s. Grech Republic).
3. Results
3.1. Effect of IL-10 on the permanent MCAO induced infarct
volume
The total infarct volume was signiﬁcantly larger in the MCAOtreated animals without administration of IL-10. IL-10 reduced
the MCAO induced infarct volume from 27 ± 4% (without IL-10) to
14 ± 4% (with IL-10) (Fig. 1A).
3.2. Effect of IL-10 on a depression of PS amplitude during brief
ischemia in hippocampal slices
IL-10 (1 ng/ml) signiﬁcantly reduced a depressive effect of
ischemia (Ti ) on the PS amplitude during ischemic episode (Fig. 1B).
In the concentration of 10 ng/ml, IL-10 insigniﬁcantly reduced the
depressive effect of ischemia on the PS amplitude during ischemic
episode (data not shown).

3.3. Effect of IL-10 on the cell death induced by OGD in cultured
hippocampal cells
We detected no more than 3% of dead cells before OGD (Fig. 1C,
panels B1-4). Thirty minutes after OGD, the numbers of dead astrocytes and neurons greatly increased to 88 ± 11% and 63 ± 16%,
respectively (Fig. 1C, panel C1 and D). Fifteen minutes preincubation with IL-10 (1 ng/ml) reduced the number of OGD-induced
dead cells to 41 ± 9% for astrocytes and to 19 ± 3% for neurons
(Fig. 1C, panel C2 and D). An increase of preincubation time with
IL-10 to 40 min reduced the numbers of dead astrocytes and neurons to 34 ± 5% and 13 ± 2%, respectively (Fig. 1 C, panel C3 and D).
Preincubation of hippocampal cultures with IL-10 for 24 h almost
completely prevented OGD-induced neuronal death and decreased
the level of dying astrocytes to 2.2 ± 0.2% (Fig. 1C, panel C4 and D).
3.4. IL-10 decreases [Ca2+ ]i responses induced by OGD in cultured
hippocampal cells
Fig. 2 illustrates [Ca2+ ]i responses of astrocytes and neurons to
OGD without and with IL-10 (1 ng/ml). OGD induced an increase
of [Ca2+ ]i in both astrocytes and neurons within several minutes,
with calcium oscillations taking place in part of the cells. [Ca2+ ]i
responses to OGD in astrocytes and neurons had a biphasic pattern
(Fig. 2, panels A1 and B1). The second phase of cytosolic calcium
increase observed 5–7 min after the start of OGD was irreversible
and led later to the cell death. Forty minutes preincubation with IL10 resulted in a decrease in the amplitude of [Ca2+ ]i signal to OGD
in astrocytes and neurons (Fig. 2, panels A2 and B2). 24 h preincubation with IL-10 also led to a decrease of [Ca2+ ]i signal to OGD in
the hippocampal cells (Fig. 2, panels A3 and B3). However, in contrast to 40 min, 24 h preincubation with IL-10 abolished the second
phase of cytosolic calcium increase and the cell death induced by
OGD. Furthermore, 24 h preincubation with IL-10 resulted in a suppression of calcium oscillations in neurons and transformation of
the pattern of [Ca2+ ]i signals in astrocytes in response to OGD to
single high-amplitude impulses (Fig. 2, panel A3 and B3). Fig. 2C
demonstrates the average amplitudes of [Ca2+ ]i responses to OGD
without and with IL-10 in the interval of 15 min after the start of
OGD.
4. Discussion
The present study demonstrates that IL-10 is capable to protect
brain cells from ischemia-induced death. This protective effect in
the cultured hippocampal cells is developed within 15 min after
application of IL-10 and strongly associated with the IL-10 elicited
elimination of [Ca2+ ]i response to ischemia.
One of the primary cell effects of cerebral ischemia is an overload of [Ca2+ ]i [5,12], that is a cause of the delayed cell death of CA1
pyramidal neurons [19]. Following ischemia, this Ca2+ overload is
thought to be the trigger for a variety of deleterious intracellular
processes mediated by phospholipases, proteases and endonucleases [7,12]. Recent ﬁndings indicate that enhanced Ca2+ activity of
the astrocytic network plays a key role in the activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors in hippocampal neurons, which enhances
brain damage during ischemia [9], and Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum can contribute to neuronal death by both promoting
mitochondrial dysfunction and inducing speciﬁc stress and apoptosis pathways [21]. In astrocytes, pro-inﬂammatory cytokine
IL-1␤ induces both the p38 MAPK and NF-␬B pathways regulating
inﬂammatory responses, however in hippocampal neurons, IL-1␤
activates p38 but not NF-␬B [13]. Such neuromodulatory effects
of cytokines require several hours to develop and cannot explain
the rapid (within minutes) neuromodulatory effect of IL-10 on the

ischemia-induced [Ca2+ ]i changes in our experiments. However,
recent ﬁndings are now accumulating that cytokines, in addition to
their canonical actions, are capable to rapidly modify ion channels
and neuronal activity within several minutes [10,22,23,27,32,36].
Anti-inﬂammatory cytokine IL-10 is a potent inhibitor of Th1
cytokines, deactivator of monocyte/macrophage pro-inﬂammatory
cytokine synthesis, and inhibitor of NF-␬B nuclear translocation
[2,20,28]. Binding of IL-10 to the extracellular domain of IL-10
receptor leads to activation of three major survival signaling pathways including Jak/Stat, MEK/ERK and PI3-kinase/Akt pathways,

which in turn induce transcription of survival genes [28]. Furthermore, IL-10 attenuates NF-␬B transcriptional activity. In contrast
to pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, IL-10 provides resistance to global
[25] and focal ([8,26], our present results) brain ischemia as well
as to in vitro ischemia (our present results). The ﬁndings of our
study also demonstrate that the protective effect of IL-10 in the
cultured hippocampal cells is developed rapidly after application
of IL-10 and strongly associated with the IL-10 elicited elimination of [Ca2+ ]i response to ischemia (Figs. 1D and 2C). Thus, this
IL-10 elicited neuroprotection is not mediated by the canonical

ischemia-evoked damages in in vivo and in vitro models of the
ischemic insults in rats. This protective effect in cultured hippocampal cells is developed rapidly after application of IL-10 and
strongly associated with the IL-10 elicited elimination of [Ca2+ ]i
response to ischemia. Thus, our results provide the evidence that
anti-inﬂammatory cytokine IL-10, in addition to an activation of the
canonical signaling pathways, is capable to exert the rapid neuroprotective effects through transcription-independent modulation
of ischemia-induced intracellular Ca2+ responses in the brain cells.

Jak-Stat3, PI3K-Akt and NF-␬B signaling pathways which mediate
the delayed (within hours–days) protective effects after prolong
exposure of cells with cytokines [28,38]. In all likelihood, IL-10 has
direct transcription-independent effects on intracellular Ca2+ disbalance induced by ischemia in brain cells. Our previous ﬁndings
suggest that IL-10 is capable to rapidly modulate the intracellular signaling pathway involving phospholipase C, InsP3 and Ca2+
release from InsP3 -sensitive internal store in hippocampal neurons
[32]. However, other studies suggest that IL-10 may directly protect
cortical neurons by activating PI3 kinase and STAT-3 pathways [24].
It is important to determine in future studies which of these intracellular signaling pathways play a key role in the neuroprotective
mechanisms of IL-10 against brain ischemia.
