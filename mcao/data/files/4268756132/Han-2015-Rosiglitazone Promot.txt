Background and Purpose—Oligodendrogenesis is essential for white matter repair after stroke. Although agonists of
peroxisome proliferator–activated receptors γ confer neuroprotection in models of cerebral ischemia, it is not known
whether this effect extends to white matter protection. This study tested the hypothesis that the peroxisome proliferator–
activated receptors γ agonist rosiglitazone enhances oligodendrogenesis and improves long-term white matter integrity
after ischemia/reperfusion.
Methods—Male adult C57/BL6 mice (25–30 g) were subjected to 60-minute middle cerebral artery occlusion and
reperfusion. Rosiglitazone (3 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally once daily for 14 days beginning 2 hours after
reperfusion. Sensorimotor and cognitive functions were evaluated ≤21 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion.
Immunostaining was used to assess infarct volume, myelin loss, and microglial activation. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)
was injected for measurements of proliferating NG2+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and newly generated
adenomatous polyposis coli+ oligodendrocytes. Mixed glial cultures were used to confirm the effect of rosiglitazone on
oligodendrocyte differentiation and microglial polarization.
Results—Rosiglitazone significantly reduced brain tissue loss, ameliorated white matter injury, and improved sensorimotor
and cognitive functions for at least 21 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Rosiglitazone enhanced OPC
proliferation and increased the numbers of newly generated mature oligodendrocytes after middle cerebral artery occlusion.
Rosiglitazone treatment also reduced the numbers of Iba1+/CD16+ M1 microglia and increased the numbers of Iba1+/
CD206+ M2 microglia after stroke. Glial culture experiments confirmed that rosiglitazone promoted oligodendrocyte
differentiation, perhaps by promoting microglial M2 polarization.
Conclusions—Rosiglitazone treatment improves long-term white matter integrity after cerebral ischemia, at least, in
part, by promoting oligodendrogenesis and facilitating microglial polarization toward the beneficial M2 phenotype.

hite matter is composed mainly of axonal fibers, oligodendrocytes, and other glial cells, and is highly
vulnerable to ischemic injury.1,2 White matter injury contributes to nearly half of the infarct volume in human ischemic
stroke.3 Oligodendrocytes are the myelin-producing cells of
the central nervous system. The myelin that they produce is
wrapped around the internodes of axons, thereby facilitating
saltatory conduction of nerve impulses and protecting axons
from damage. Death of oligodendrocytes can result in myelin
loss, axonal injury, and ultimately may be manifested as neurological deficits in stroke victims.4 Stroke and experimental ischemia can induce the proliferation of oligodendrocyte

precursor cells (OPCs).4,5 However, most of these OPCs fail
to develop into mature oligodendrocytes, resulting in insufficient remyelination and unsuccessful white matter repair.6,7
Therefore, promoting oligodendrogenesis and OPC differentiation may represent a potential therapeutic strategy to enhance
white matter integrity and improve neurological recovery after
stroke.
Administration of peroxisome proliferator–activated
receptor γ (PPAR-γ) agonists has been shown to reduce infarct
volume and improve neurological outcomes after stroke
through multiple mechanisms, such as by mitigating excitotoxicity,8 apoptosis,9 inflammation,10,11 and microvascular

damage.12 However, the effects of PPAR-γ agonists on white
matter integrity after stroke have not been investigated. Recent
in vitro studies have documented that several PPAR-γ agonists promote OPC differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes.13–15 These findings shed light on the therapeutic potential
of PPAR-γ agonists for oligodendrogenesis and white matter
repair in central nervous system diseases with demyelination.
In this study, we show for the first time that postischemic
treatment with rosiglitazone, a PPAR-γ agonist, can promote
oligodendrocyte replacement and white matter repair in a
mouse model of stroke with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). We further demonstrate that rosiglitazone
promotes poststroke microglial polarization toward the beneficial M2-like phenotype, which has recently been shown
to be important for OPC differentiation and the process of
remyelination.16

Materials and Methods
Murine Transient Focal Ischemia Model and Drug
Administration
All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the University of Pittsburgh and performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals. Male 8- to 10-week-old C57/BL6 mice
(Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were subjected to MCAO as
previously described.10 In brief, focal cerebral ischemia was induced
by intraluminal occlusion of the left MCA for 1 hour under anesthesia
with 1.5% isoflurane in a 30% O2/68.5% N2O mixture. Laser Doppler
flowmetry was used to measure regional cerebral blood flow of all
stroke animals, and only animals with cerebral blood flow reduction
>70% of preischemia baseline levels during MCAO were included
for further investigations. Sham-operated animals underwent anesthesia and surgical exposure of arteries but without MCAO. Rectal
temperature was maintained at 37±0.5°C with a heating pad during
surgical procedures.
Animals were randomly assigned to Sham, MCAO+Vehicle,
and MCAO+rosiglitazone groups by using a lottery-drawing box.
Rosiglitazone (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
and further diluted with saline before use (0.5% v/v). Animals were
administered 3 mg/kg rosiglitazone intraperitoneally daily for consecutive 14 days, initiated 2 hours after MCAO. This dose of rosiglitazone was chosen on the basis of our previous study10 showing that
3 mg/kg is the minimum dosage to provide neuroprotection against
brain infarcts. The control group received an equivalent volume and
concentration of saline-diluted dimethyl sulfoxide use (0.5% v/v).
Animals were euthanized 21 days after MCAO. Brains were removed
and sectioned into 25-μm free-floating coronal cryosections using a
microtome.

Bromodeoxyuridine Injections
To label proliferating cells, all animals were intraperitoneally injected
with the thymidine analog 5′-bromo-2′-deoxy-uridine (BrdU, 50 mg/
kg) twice a day—with an interval of at least 8 hours—for 5 days,
beginning at 3 days after MCAO.

Neurological Function Evaluation
The Rotarod test (motor coordination), corner (sensorimotor asymmetry),17 and Morris water maze tests (spatial learning and memory)18
were performed as previously described to assess neurological functions before and after surgery by investigators who were blinded to
experimental group assignments.

Immunofluorescence Staining and Quantification
Immunostaining was performed on free-floating cryosections.
Sections were incubated in the following primary antibodies overnight at 4°C: rabbit anti–myelin basic protein (MBP; Abcam), mouse
anti–nonphosphorylated neurofilament H (SMI32; Calbiochem),
rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako), goat anti-CD206 (R&D Systems), rat antiCD16 (BD biosciences), mouse anti-BrdU (BD bioscience), rabbit
anti-NG2 (Millipore), and mouse anti–adenomatous polyposis coli
(APC) protein (Calbiochem). For BrdU staining, brain sections
were pretreated with 1N HCl for 1 hour followed by 0.1 mol/L boric
acid (pH 8.5) for 10 minutes at 37°C. Images were captured using
a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus Fluoview FV1000;
Olympus). The immunostaining intensity with MBP and SMI32 antibodies, as well as the numbers of target immunopositive cells were
quantified by a blinded investigator using Image J software. Three
randomly selected microscopic fields within the external capsule,
cortex, striatum, subventricular zone (SVZ), and subgranular zone
(SGZ) on each of 3 consecutive sections were analyzed for each
brain by a blinded investigator. White matter injury was expressed as
the mean ratio of SMI32 to MBP immunostaining. Immunopositive
cell counts were presented as the mean number of cells per square
millimeter.

Brain Tissue Loss
Brain tissue loss was determined by immunostaining using rabbit microtubule-associated protein 2 antibodies (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Images were captured by a blinded investigator with a ×1.25 objective. A series of 6 sections in the MCA territory were selected in each mouse brain. The area of brain tissue
loss for each section was measured with the following equation:
microtubule-associated protein 2–positive staining in contralateral
hemisphere−microtubule-associated protein 2–positive staining
in ipsilateral hemisphere. Brain volume loss was then determined
by multiplying the mean area of tissue loss by the thickness of the
evaluated tissue.

Primary Mixed Glial Cells and Microglia-Depleted
Cultures
Mixed glial cells were prepared from the whole brains of 1-day-old
Sprague-Dawley rat pups, as described previously.19 Cells were seeded
in poly-d-lysine–coated 175-cm2 flasks at a density of 1.5×107cells/mL
and maintained in glial cell culture media (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle
Medium/F12 containing l-glutamine, Minimum Essential Medium
nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, penicillin/streptomycin,
and fetal bovine serum). Culture media was changed on the following
day and subsequently every 3 days until a confluent monolayer of cells
was achieved. For microglia depletion, 1.5 mmol/L l-leucine methyl
ester was added to the in vitro cultures beginning at day 2 and was
exchanged every 3 days. This protocol resulted in <0.1% microglia.
Fourteen-day-old cultures were then used for treatments.

Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed as
previously described.19 In brief, total RNA was extracted using the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The first strand of cDNA was synthesized with 1-μg RNA using the
Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on the Opticon
2 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) using SYBR green
PCR Master Mix (Invitrogen). Primers used are as follows: MBP forward primer: 5′-CTCCCAGCTTAAAGATTTTGGAAA-3′, reverse
primer: 5′-AAATCGGCTCACAAGGGATTC-3′; proteolipid protein

Flow Cytometry
Cells were stained with anti-rat CD206, CD11b, NG2, O4, and
the appropriate isotype controls following manufacturer’s instructions (eBioscience). Flow cytometric analysis was performed
using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences).

Statistical Analyses
All results are presented as mean values±SEM. Unless otherwise indicated, multiple comparisons were made using a 1-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test. The Student t test was used for
2-group comparisons. Results were deemed statistically significant
at P≤0.05.

Rosiglitazone Promotes White Matter Integrity
After MCAO
White matter damage is a critical component of ischemic
brain injury. Therefore, we examined the effect of rosiglitazone on poststroke white matter integrity using immunofluorescent double labeling for MBP, a marker of myelin
integrity, and SMI32, a marker for axonal damage.20 Marked
myelin loss accompanied by severe axonal damage was
detected in the ischemic penumbra of vehicle-treated brains
at 21 days after MCAO. MBP+ myelin structures were absent

penumbra (Figure 2A–2C). Treatment with rosiglitazone significantly preserved white matter integrity after MCAO, as
measured by the decreased ratio of SMI32 to MBP staining
intensity relative to vehicle-treated controls (P=0.027 in EC,
P=0.010 in CTX, and P=0.006 in STR; Figure 2D).

Rosiglitazone Improves Long-Term Recovery of
Neurological Function After MCAO

Next, we tested whether the beneficial effects of rosiglitazone
are associated with enhanced neurological functional recovery.
Rosiglitazone treatment significantly reduced sensorimotor
deficits after ischemic stroke, as demonstrated by an increased
latency to fall off the accelerating Rotarod (P<0.001; P=0.008
at day 9 post injury; Figure 3A), and a reduced tendency to
turn toward the unlesioned side in the corner test (P<0.001;
P=0.020 and P=0.012 at days 14 and 21 post injury, respectively; Figure 3B).
The Morris water maze test revealed that rosiglitazone
treatment facilitated spatial learning recovery after MCAO, as
evidenced by less time spent finding the hidden platform during the cued trials in the rosiglitazone-treated group (P<0.001;

P=0.002 at day 16, P=0.013 at day 17, and P=0.018 at day
18 post injury; Figure 3C). In the probe test, where the platform was removed, rosiglitazone-treated MCAO mice spent
significantly more time in the target quadrant (P=0.030;
Figure 3D). There was no significant difference in swimming speed between the 2 groups (not shown). These findings demonstrate that rosiglitazone facilitates spatial learning
and memory consolidation without any confounding effect on
swimming speed.

Rosiglitazone Enhances Oligodendrogenesis
After MCAO
Regeneration of mature myelinating oligodendrocytes is essential for remyelination and functional recovery after cerebral
ischemia. Thus, we sought to determine whether rosiglitazone
treatment acted on oligodendrocyte lineage development after
MCAO, thereby facilitating white matter restoration. First, we
found that MCAO dramatically increased the number of NG2+
OPCs in the peri-infarct areas (external capsule, cortex, and
striatum) within 21 days, and this endogenous response was
further enhanced by rosiglitazone (P=0.044 in EC, P=0.023
in CTX, and P<0.001 in STR; Figure 4A and 4Ca). The

BrdU incorporation assay demonstrated that ischemia stimulated OPC proliferation, as reflected by increased numbers of
BrdU+NG2+ cells in vehicle-treated groups compared with
the sham control group. Rosiglitazone further amplified this
endogenous response in OPC proliferation, as revealed by
increased numbers of NG2+OPCs with BrdU incorporation
in peri-infarct areas (P=0.011 in EC, P=0.021 in CTX, and
P=0.029 in STR; Figure 4A and 4Cb). The SVZ lining the
lateral ventricles and the SGZ of the hippocampus are 2 critical structures for neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis in the
adult brain.21,22 We found that rosiglitazone greatly increased
the number of NG2+ OPCs in these 2 areas at 21 days after
MCAO (P=0.042 in SVZ and P=0.003 in SGZ; Figure 4A
and 4Cc). The number of BrdU+ proliferating OPCs was also
elevated by rosiglitazone (P=0.017 in SVZ and P=0.006 in

SGZ; Figure 4A and 4Cd). These data suggest that rosiglitazone enhances oligodendrogenesis in both peri-infarct areas
and the neural stem cell pools (SVZ and SGZ) after cerebral
ischemia.

Rosiglitazone Treatment Increases Generation of
New Oligodendrocytes After MCAO
To determine whether increased OPC proliferation leads to
the generation of new oligodendrocytes, brain sections were
double stained with BrdU and anti-APC (also known as
CC1), a marker for mature oligodendrocyte cell bodies. As
expected, increases in the colocalization of APC and BrdU
were detected in peri-infarct areas in vehicle-treated MCAO
mice compared with sham controls, suggesting that spontaneous generation of new oligodendrocytes occurs at 21 days

after MCAO (P=0.019 in EC, P=0.016 in CTX, and P=0.037
in STR; Figure 4D). Treatment with rosiglitazone further augmented oligodendrocyte replacement, as evidenced by greater
numbers of APC+BrdU+ new mature oligodendrocytes in periinfarct areas. These data indicate that postischemia treatment
with rosiglitazone enhances the generation of new oligodendrocytes at least 21 days after focal cerebral ischemia.

Rosiglitazone Drives M2 Microglial Polarization
After MCAO
Microglia with different phenotypes have distinct impacts on
the survival and differentiation of oligodendrocyte lineage
cells.16 For example, M1 microglia are characterized by proinflammatory effects and lead to exacerbation of tissue damage, whereas M2 microglia resolve local inflammation and

2634  Stroke  September 2015

facilitate tissue repair.23 We previously reported that rosiglitazone inhibited microglia-mediated neuroinflammation after
acute cerebral ischemia.10 Here, we further tested whether
administration of rosiglitazone could modulate microglial
phenotype during the recovery phase of stroke. Consistent
with our previous studies, Iba1 immunostaining revealed
that rosiglitazone treatment attenuated microglial activation
around the ischemic zone at 21 days after MCAO (P=0.042
in EC, P<0.001 in CTX, and P<0.001 in STR; Figure 5A
and 5B). Vehicle-treated MCAO mice exhibited increases in
both M1 and M2 microglia in peri-infarct areas. Intriguingly,
rosiglitazone treatment decreased the number of M1 microglia (P=0.008 in EC, P<0.001 in CTX, and P<0.001 in STR;
Figure 5A and 5C) while increasing the number of M2
microglia (P=0.003 in EC, P=0.001 in CTX, and P=0.005 in
STR; Figure 5A and 5D). Collectively, these findings suggest
that rosiglitazone promotes microglial polarization to the beneficial M2 phenotype after ischemia.

Rosiglitazone Promotes Oligodendrocyte
Differentiation and M2 Microglial Polarization in
Mixed Glial Cultures
To verify our in vivo results and confirm that rosiglitazone
promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation, we treated mixed
glial cultures with rosiglitazone. As shown in Figure 6A, rosiglitazone treatment enhanced the mRNA expression of MBP
and PLP, 2 markers for mature oligodendrocytes in mixed
glial cultures (P=0.007 in MBP and P<0.001 for PLP). Flow
cytometry confirmed that rosiglitazone treatment increased
the expression of oligodendrocyte differentiation marker O4,
a marker of differentiating oligodendrocytes, and reduced
the expression of NG2, a marker of OPCs, in mixed glial
cultures (P=0.048; Figure 6B). These findings demonstrate
enhanced oligodendrocyte differentiation. We also found that
the expression of the M2 marker CD206 was increased in rosiglitazone-treated mixed glial cultures (P=0.015; Figure 6C).

Flow cytometry further revealed enhanced CD206 staining in CD11b+ microglia. Importantly, when microglia were
depleted from the mixed glial culture system, rosiglitazone
was less efficient in inducing oligodendrocyte maturation
(P=0.031; Figure 6D). These data suggest that rosiglitazone
may promote OPC differentiation into oligodendrocytes and
that this effect may be partially dependent on the presence of
microglia.

Discussion
PPAR-γ agonists have been shown to possess neuroprotective effects in patients with stroke and in animal models of
stroke.10,24,25 However, the long-term effects of PPAR-γ agonists on white matter injury after stroke remain unknown. In
this study, we found that the activation of PPAR-γ by rosiglitazone enhanced white matter integrity during the recovery
phase of stroke in the MCAO model. Consistent with previous studies,4 we found that transient focal cerebral ischemia
induced severe myelin loss and axonal damage in peri-infarct
areas, such as the corpus callosum, external capsule, striatum,
and cortex. These pathological changes in the white matter
were significantly ameliorated by rosiglitazone treatment initiated 2 hours after stroke. Preserving or restoring white matter integrity could promote neurological behavioral functions,
including sensorimotor and cognitive functions, after stroke
by enhancing the precise and efficient transmission of neuronal signals between different brain areas. Thus, rosiglitazone
can elicit protection of both white matter and gray matter,10
thereby facilitating long-term functional recovery after stroke.
The mechanisms underlying rosiglitazone-afforded
white matter protection could be manifold. First, we demonstrated that rosiglitazone treatment enhanced oligodendrogenesis and the generation of new oligodendrocytes after
stroke. Oligodendrocytes are known to be highly susceptible
to ischemic injury,1,2,4 and damage to oligodendrocytes leads
to myelin loss and axonal injury. Successful regeneration of

oligodendrocytes is essential for remyelination after brain
injuries, because injured mature oligodendrocytes no longer
produce functional myelin and mature oligodendrocytes are
not proliferative.5 OPCs are distributed throughout the central nervous system26 and OPCs derived from neural stem
cells in the SVZ27 actively proliferate after ischemic stroke
in a concerted effort at regeneration, and migrate to the
peri-infarct areas. We demonstrated here that rosiglitazone
enhanced the proliferation of OPCs in peri-ischemic areas
and in the SVZ. In addition, we showed that the number of
proliferating OPCs in the SGZ of the hippocampus was also
increased in rosiglitazone-treated ischemic brains, indicating that neural stem cells in the SGZ might also give rise to
a new population of OPCs after ischemia. Despite the active
proliferation of OPCs after stroke, few give rise to new
mature myelin-producing oligodendrocytes,28 which may
contribute to poor white matter recovery.29 In this study, we
showed that rosiglitazone not only enhanced OPC proliferation, but also, more importantly, increased the maturation of
new oligodendrocytes. This result is in line with previous in
vitro studies showing that PPAR-γ agonists promoted OPC
differentiation into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes.13,30
Therefore, the promotion of OPC proliferation and differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes may be important
mechanisms underlying the increase in white matter integrity by rosiglitazone.
In addition to stimulating oligodendrogenesis, rosiglitazone may enhance white matter integrity through protection
of OPCs and oligodendrocytes. Oxidative stress and excitotoxicity are the 2 main mechanisms leading to cell death of
oligodendrocytes and OPCs under ischemic conditions.2 Many
PPAR-γ–regulated genes such as superoxide dismutase,31,32
catalase,33 and glutamate transporter GLT1/EAAT234 possess
strong antioxidant and antiexcitotoxic properties. Thus, it is
possible that rosiglitazone protects OPCs and oligodendrocytes by blunting oxidative and excitotoxic injuries.
Recent studies have emphasized the importance of microglia/macrophage responses in white matter injury and repair.23,35
Intriguingly, M1 and M2 microglia/macrophages, the 2
extreme phenotypes along the continuum, have been shown to
exert distinct functions in oligodendrocyte survival31 and OPC
differentiation.16 It is becoming increasingly accepted that
microglia activation status should be shifted toward the beneficial M2 phenotype in place of blanketed suppression of all
microglia.23 We demonstrated in this study that rosiglitazone
favored microglial activation toward the M2 phenotype during
the recovery phase of cerebral ischemia, which might enhance
oligodendrocyte survival and promote OPC differentiation
after stroke. In vitro data confirmed that the increase in OPC
differentiation by rosiglitazone in the mixed glial culture was
partially dependent on the presence of microglia. In agreement with our results, another PPAR-γ agonist, pioglitazone,
has been reported to promote the M1 to M2 switch in animal models of Alzheimer disease.36 Therefore, it is likely that
PPAR-γ agonists also regulate oligodendrogenesis indirectly
through the modulation of microglial polarization after stroke.
Further studies are warranted to confirm the direct effect of
rosiglitazone on microglial polarization and the underlying
mechanisms.

In conclusion, our data demonstrate that postischemia
treatment with rosiglitazone improves white matter integrity
after stroke. Rosiglitazone exerted both direct and indirect
effects on white matter by promoting endogenous oligodendrogenesis and favoring microglial polarization toward the M2
phenotype. Additional in vitro and in vivo studies have shown
that rosiglitazone treatment can protect neurons,10 reduce oxidative stress, and mitigate excitotoxicity,8 all of which are
likely to contribute to long-term recovery after stroke, especially when combined with increased oligodendrogenesis and
M2 polarization of microglia. There are few other treatments
that have such multimodal properties in stroke models. Thus,
rosiglitazone can be considered a multipurpose molecule warranting further investigation as a therapeutic agent for stroke.
