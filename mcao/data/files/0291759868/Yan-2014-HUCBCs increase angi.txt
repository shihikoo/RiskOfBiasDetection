SUMMARY
Background and purpose: We investigated the neurorestorative effects and underlying
mechanisms of stroke treatment with human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBCs) in Type
one diabetes mellitus (T1DM) rats. Methods: Type one diabetes mellitus rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and 24 h later were treated with:
(1) phosphate-buffered-saline; (2) HUCBCs. Brain endothelial cells (MBECs) were cultured
and capillary tube formation was measured. Results: Human umbilical cord blood cells
treatment significantly improved functional outcome and promoted white matter (WM)
remodeling, as identified by Bielschowsky silver, Luxol fast blue and SMI-31 expression,
increased oligodendrocyte progenitor cell and oligodendrocyte density after stroke in T1DM
rats. HUCBC also promoted vascular remodeling, evident from enhanced vascular and arterial density and increased artery diameter, and decreased blood-brain barrier leakage.
HUCBC treatment also increased Angiopoietin-1 and decreased receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) expression compared to T1DM-MCAo control. In vitro analysis
of MBECs demonstrated that Ang1 inversely regulated RAGE expression. HUCBC and Ang1
significantly increased capillary tube formation and decreased inflammatory factor expression, while anti-Ang1 attenuated HUCBC-induced tube formation and antiinflammatory
effects. Conclusion: Human umbilical cord blood cells is an effective neurorestorative therapy in T1DM-MCAo rats and the enhanced vascular and WM remodeling and associated
functional recovery after stroke may be attributed to increasing Angiopoietin-1 and decreasing RAGE.

Introduction
Diabetic Mellitus (DM) is a chronic health concern that elevates
the risk of ischemic stroke [1]. DM patients rapidly develop vascular disorders and suffer significantly worse outcomes poststroke
with poor long term recovery hindered by recurrent strokes [2,3].
Our earlier studies with bone-marrow-stromal cells indicated that
treatment initiated at 24-h poststroke improved functional recovery in non-DM rats, but not in Type 1 DM (T1DM) rats [4]. This
indicates that effective therapy for stroke in non-DM patients may
not necessarily transfer to DM stroke patients. Therefore, investigating and developing new therapeutic approaches specifically
targeting the diabetic stroke population is of prime research interest.
Human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBCs) are an effective
treatment for hematological disorders, and researchers are investigating HUCBCs as a treatment for nonhematological disorders like

diabetes [5–7]. HUCBCs have the potential to reverse impending
cell death by inhibiting the spread of apoptosis, regulating inflammatory and immune responses, and improving behavioral recovery in non-DM MCAo rats [8,9]. Apart from cell replacement,
HUCBCs produce neurotrophic and antiinflammatory factors to
promote functional recovery poststroke [10]. However, the neurorestorative effect of HUCBCs in stroke with DM has not been
investigated.
Diabetic stroke animals exhibited significantly suppression of
Ang-1 expression and elevation of inflammatory factors such as
receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) in the
ischemic brain correlates with functional deficit after stroke [11].
Ang-1 is a protein with potent roles in vascular remodeling, protection and angiogenesis [12]. Ang-1 is a primary physiological
ligand for TIE2 and plays a vital role in the migration, adhesion
and survival of endothelial cells and in vessel maturation [13].
Ang1 regulates in the organization and maturation of new blood

vessels. It also boasts the capability to suppress vascular inflammation, leakage and endothelial death [12]. Ang1 plays an important
role in promoting vascular maturation and stabilization as well as
increasing angiogenesis after stroke [14]. Decreased Ang1 is
related with increased blood brain-barrier (BBB) leakage and
brain hemorrhagic transformation after stroke in DM mice [15].
Ang1 also inhibits pro-inflammatory mediators (Tumor necrosis
factor alpha, IL-6 and IL-8) [16] that exacerbate vascular and
white matter (WM) damage after stroke in diabetic populations
[4,17].
Receptor for advanced glycation end-products is a primary
receptor for high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1), and can
initiate and sustain a proinflammatory phenotype upon activation
by HMGB1 [18]. RAGE has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
diabetic complications, inflammatory disorders and neurodegenerative diseases [19,20]. In our previous studies, we have found
that T1DM-stroke rats exhibit significantly increased HMGB1 and
RAGE expression in the ischemic brain [21]. The RAGE expression is closely related with inflammation in the ischemic brain and
correlated with neurological deficit after stroke in DM animals
[21].
In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of HUCBC
treatment in T1DM stroke rats and the underlying mechanisms of
HUCBC treatment induced neurorestorative effects in T1DM rats
after stroke. Ang1 and inflammatory factor RAGE expression will
be measured.

Materials and Methods
All experiments were conducted in accordance with the standards
and procedures of the American Council on Animal Care and
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Henry Ford
Health System.

Diabetes Induction
A single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg;
Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) was given to adult male
Wistar rats (225–250 g; Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA) for
diabetes induction. Two weeks later, the fasting blood glucose
level was tested using a glucose analyzer (Accu-Chek Compact
System; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and animals
with fasting blood glucose >300 mg/dL underwent 2 h transient
MCAo [21].

MCAo Model and Experiment Groups
Transient (2 h) MCAo was performed on anesthetized T1DM rats
via intraluminal vascular occlusion as previously described
[22,23]. Rats were then randomly assigned to different groups and
treated with: (1) PBS (Phosphate-Buffered-Saline) as vehicle control (n = 9); (2) HUCBCs (5 9 106, n = 6) (Saneron CCEL Therapeutics) via tail-vein injection starting at 24 h post-MCAo. Sham
surgery was performed in the same way as the MCAo model without inserting the nylon suture. Sham controls were also treated
with either PBS (n = 4) or HUCBCs (5 9 106, n = 4) at 24 h postsham surgery via tail-vein injection. Rats were sacrificed at
14 days after MCAo for immunostaining quantification analysis.

Neurological Functional Tests
An investigator was blinded to the experimental groups to perform a battery of functional tests including Foot fault, and a modified neurological severity score (mNSS) evaluation before MCAo,
at 1 day after MCAo before treatment, and at 7, 14 days after
MCAo [22,24]. mNSS is a composite of motor, sensory, balance
and reflex tests. Neurological function was assessed and each animal received a score between 0 and 18 (normal score 0; maximal
deficit score 18). The absence of a tested reflex or abnormal
response received one point. Hence, higher the score, greater is
the impairment of normal function. Rats with score <6 or over 13
at 24 h after MCAo (prior to treatment) were not included.
In the foot fault test [25], animals were placed on an elevated
grid floor (45 cm 9 30 cm), 2.5 cm higher than a solid base floor,
with 2.5 cm 9 2.5 cm diameter grid spacings. While moving on
the wire frame using their paws, an inaccurate forelimb placement
leads to a fall/slip through one of the grid openings and is recorded
as a foot fault. A total of 100 forelimb movements were counted,
and the total number of foot faults for the left forelimb was
recorded. The percentage of foot faults of the left paw of total steps
was calculated.

Histological and Immunohistochemical
Assessment
Transcardial perfusion with saline was used to fix brains, followed
by perfusion and immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains
were then embedded in paraffin and a standard block was
obtained from the center of the lesion (bregma
1 mm ~ +1 mm). A series of 6-lm-thick sections was cut from
the block. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained seven coronal
sections of tissue were used for lesion volume calculation and presented as a percentage of lesion compared with the contralateral
hemisphere.
Brain coronal tissue sections were prepared and antibody
against a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA, mouse monoclonal IgG,
1:800; Dako, Carpenteria, CA, USA); Von Willebrand Factor
(vWF, 1:400; Dako); NG2 (oligodendrocyte progenitor cell
[OPC] marker, 1:100; Chemicon, CA, USA); 20 ,30 -Cyclic-nucleotide 30 -phosphodiesterase (CNPase, an oligodendrocyte marker,
1:200; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), SMI-31 (Neurofilaments,
phosphorylated monoclonal antibody, 1:1000, Covance, CA),
RAGE (1:400; Dako), Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1; 1:2000; Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA) were employed. Bielschowsky-silver (BS)
immunostaining was used to demonstrate axons; luxol fast blue
(LFB) staining was used to demonstrate myelin and antibody
against albumin (albumin-FITC, polyclonal, 1:500; Abcam) and
was used to demonstrate BBB leakage. Control experiments
consisted of staining brain coronal tissue sections as outlined
above, but nonimmune serum was substituted for the primary
antibody.

Quantification Analysis
An investigator blind to the experimental groups performed all
immunostaining quantification analysis. Five slides from each
brain, with each slide containing eight fields from striatum of the

ischemic border zone (IBZ) were digitized under a 209 objective
(Olympus BX40; Olympus America, Center Valley, PA, USA) using
a 3-CCD color video camera (Sony DXC-970MD; Tokyo, Japan)
interfaced with an MCID image analysis system (Imaging Research,
St. Catharines, ON, Canada). For BS and LFB measurements,
positive areas of immunoreactive cells were measured in the WM
bundles of the stratum in the IBZ. For other immunostaining
(NG2, CNPase, SMI-31, Ang1, RAGE and albumin), positive areas
of immunoreactive cells were measured in the IBZ (Figure 2F).

Vascular Density Measurement
To measure the vascular density in the IBZ, eight fields of view of
vWF immunostaining from the IBZ were digitized using a 209
objective via the MCID software [26].

aSMA-Positive Coated Arterial Diameter and
Wall Thickness
The a-SMA stained vessels were analyzed with regard to small
and large vessels (≥10 lm diameter). The arterial density in
the IBZ was measured [27]. In addition, the 10 largest arterial
wall thicknesses and internal arterial diameters were measured.

Western Blot Assay
From an additional set of rats sacrificed at 14 days after MCAo
(n = 4/group), ischemic brain tissues were extracted from the
IBZ [28]. Protein was isolated from samples using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following standard protocol. Protein
concentration was measured using the BCA (Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA) kit. Forty micrograms of protein/lane in a
10% SDS PAGE precast gel (Invitrogen). Gel was transferred to
a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) by
running the transfer at 400 mA for 2 h. Nitrocellulose
membrane was blocked in 2% I-Block (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) in 19 TBS-T for 1 h, and then either
anti-b-actin (1:10,000; Abcam), anti-Ang1 (1:1000; Abcam).
RAGE (1:500; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) primary
antibodies were added in 2% I-Block in TBS-T, and incubated
on a shaker overnight at 4°C. Following morning, the membranes were washed three times for 5 min with 19 TBS-T. Secondary antibodies (anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-rat, Jackson
ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) were added at 1:1000
dilution in 2% I-Block in 19 TBS-T on a room temperature
shaker for 1 h. After the incubation, the membranes were
washed three times for 5 min with 19 TBS-T. After the final
wash, Luminol Reagent (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA) was
added and allowed to react with the membranes for 2 min. The
membranes were then developed using a FluorChem E Imager
system (ProteinSimple, Santa Clara, CA, USA) exposing them
for 1–30 min, depending on the intensity of the band.

Real Time PCR Assay
Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen), following standard protocol. Two micrograms of total RNA was used to make
cDNA using the M-MLV (Invitrogen) standard protocol. Of this

ª 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

cDNA, 2 lL was used to run a quantitative PCR using the SYBR
Green real time PCR method. Quantitative PCR was performed on
a ViiA 7 PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems) using three-stage
program parameters provided by the manufacturer, as follows;
2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C, and then 40 cycles of 15 seconds at
95°C and 1 min at 60°C. Each sample was tested in triplicate, and
analysis of relative gene expression data using the 2ΔΔCT method.

Brain Endothelial Cell Culture
To test the relationship of Ang1 with RAGE, brain endothelial cell
(BEC) (cell line from ATCC) culture was performed in vitro. BECs
were subjected to 2 h oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Culture
media was removed and replaced with serum and glucose free
media. Cells were placed in a hypoxia chamber (Forma Anaerobic
System; Thermo Scientific) with 37°C incubator for 2 h. After 2 h,
the cells were removed and then cultured in high glucose (HG,
37.5 mM) DMEM media with 10% FBS (Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY, USA) and treated with: (1) nontreatment control;
(2) 200 ng Ang1 (Millipore) for 24 h. RAGE expression was measured by Western blot.

Brain Endothelial Cell Capillary Tube Formation
Assay
Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) was diluted
to 75% with SF-DMEM and 100 lL was added per well in a
96-well plate before being incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Meanwhile, BEC were harvested and counted to give 22,500 cells/well
and were suspended in SF-DMEM and cultured in high glucose (HG, 37.5 mM) condition with: (1) no-treatment control;
(2) +HUCBC (22,500 cells/well); (3) +Ang1 (200 ng/mL, Millipore); and (4) +HUCBC+Ang1 inhibitor antibody (0.625 lg/mL,
Millipore). A total of 100 lL of cell suspension with treatment was
added to each well (n = 4) and allowed to incubate for 3 h. After
3 h, the Matrigel wells were digitized under a 109 objective
(Olympus BX40) for measurement of total tube length of capillary
tube formation. Tracks of endothelial cells organized into networks of cellular cords (tubes) were counted and averaged in four
randomly selected microscopic fields.

Inflammatory Factor Gene Expression Assay
To test whether HUCBC and Ang1 regulates inflammatory factor
expression, BECs were cultured in the HG (37.5 mM) condition
and treated with: (1) no-treatment control; (2) +HUCBC;
(3) +Ang1 (200 ng/mL); and (4) +HUCBC+Ang1 inhibitor antibody (0.625 lg/mL, Millipore) for 24 h. RAGE and TLR2 gene
expression was measured by real time PCR.

Statistical Analysis
One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used for the evaluation of functional outcome and histology, respectively. “Contract/
estimate” statement was used to test the group difference. If an
overall treatment group effect was detected at P < 0.05, pair-wise
comparisons were made. All data are presented as mean  standard error (SE).

T1DM Stroke Treatment with HUCBC

Results
HUCBC Treatment Significantly Improved Functional
Outcome After Stroke Without Reduction of Lesion
Volume or Blood Glucose Level
To assess the effect of HUCBC treatment on long term functional outcome after stroke in T1DM rats, a set of behavioral tests was performed.
Figure 1 presents foot fault (Figure 1A) and mNSS evaluation (Figure 1B) data for 14 days after stroke that indicate significantly
improved functional outcome in T1DM MCAo rats treated with HUCBCs compared to control (P < 0.05). However, HUCBC treatment did
not decrease lesion volume (T1DM MCAo control: 28.9  3.4%,
T1DM MCAo with HUCBC treatment: 31.2  2.8%, sham surgery control: 0%) and blood glucose (T1DM MCAo control:
d1: 440.7  50.3 mg/dL, d14: 500.1  40.7 mg/dL; T1DM MCAo
with HUCBC treatment: d1: 540.2  50.6 mg/dL, d14: 440.8  60.1
mg/dL). No significant change of blood glucose level was observed
in sham control rats (PBS treated group: 518.7  49.3 mg/dL day 1
to 579.5  21.2 mg/dL on day 14; HUCBC treated group:
587.2  13.9 mg/dL day 1 to 585.1  15.7 mg/dL on day 14). It can
be inferred that HUCBC treatment induces neurorestorative effects
which are not related to blood glucose level.

HUCBC Treatment Significantly Increased WM
Remodeling
To test whether HUCBC treatment regulates WM remodeling, BS
(Axon marker), LFB (myelin marker) and SMI-31 (pan-axonal neurofilament marker) staining were performed. Figure 2 shows that in
T1DM-MCAo rats, compared to controls, HUCBC treatment significantly increased myelin (Figure 2A), and axonal (Figure 2B,C) density in the IBZ (P < 0.05). To test whether stroke treatment with
HUCBC can regulate oligodendrocyte density in the ischemic brain,
immunostaining with NG2 (OPC marker) and CNPase (OL marker)
were performed. Treatment with HUCBCs significantly increased
OPC (NG2, Figure 2D) and OL (CNPase, Figure 2E) in the IBZ of striatum compared to control T1DM-MCAo rats.

HUCBC Treatment Promoted Vascular
Remodeling in the Ischemic Brain
To evaluate the effects of HUCBC treatment on vascular remodeling, FITC-albumin levels and vascular and arterial density were

(A)

measured in the IBZ. In T1DM-MCAo rats, treatment with HUCBCs significantly decreased BBB leakage demonstrated by FITCalbumin staining in comparison with control rats (Figure 3A). HUCBC treatment also increased vascular density (vWF, Figure 3B) and
the density and diameter of arteries (a-SMA, Figure 3C) in the IBZ
compared to T1DM-MCAo controls (P < 0.05). Hence, HUCBC treatment not only promotes WM remodeling, but also increases vascular
remodeling and decreases BBB leakage in the ischemic brain.

HUCBC Treatment Significantly Increased Ang-1
and Decreased RAGE Expression in the IBZ in
T1DM Rats
To understand the underlying mechanisms of HUCBC-induced
functional improvement in T1DM-MCAo rats, the angiogenic factor Ang-1 and inflammatory factor RAGE expressions were quantified in the IBZ. Figure 4 shows that treatment with HUCBCs
significantly increased Ang-1 (Figure 4A) and decreased RAGE
(Figure 4B, P < 0.05) expression compared to T1DM-MCAo control. Consistent with the immunostaining results, the Western blot
data and real time PCR (Figure 4C,D) also suggest increased Ang1
and decreased RAGE expression in the IBZ upon HUCBC treatment compared to control T1DM-MCAo rats.

Ang1 Treatment Decreased RAGE Expression in
Cultured BECs
Earlier studies have reported that high glucose significantly
decreased Ang1 and increased RAGE expression [15,21]. Presently,
we have found that HUCBC treatment increased Ang1, but significantly decreased RAGE expression in the ischemic brain. To test
the relationship of Ang-1 and RAGE, BECs were treated with or
without Ang1 under OGD and high glucose conditions. Figure 5
shows that Ang1 treatment significantly decreased RAGE expression in cultured BECs. These data indicate that increasing Ang1
induced by HUCBC treatment down-regulates RAGE expression.

time PCR for inflammatory factor expression were performed. Figure 6 shows that HUCBC and Ang1 treatment significantly
increases capillary tube formation (6A,B) and decreases inflammatory factor RAGE and TLR2 expression (6C,D, P < 0.05), while
inhibition of Ang1 with the anti-Ang1 antibody partially attenuates HUCBC-induced capillary tube formation and antiinflammatory effects (vs. HUCBC treatment, P < 0.05). Therefore,
increasing Ang1 may contribute to HUCBC treatment induced
vascular remodeling and antiinflammatory effects.

Discussion
In this study, we have demonstrated for the first time, to our
knowledge, that HUCBC treatment of T1DM stroke improves
functional outcome without reducing blood glucose or lesion
volume with treatment initiated at 24 h after MCAo. HUCBC
treatment also increases Ang1, decreases RAGE as well as
promotes WM and vascular remodeling in the ischemic brain.
Human umbilical cord blood cells are an abundant source of
immature progenitor cells with the potential to differentiate into
cells of multiple cell lineages [29]. Our earlier study has demonstrated that HUCBCs administered poststroke in non-DM-MCAo
rats have the potential to migrate into the ischemic brain and promote neurological functional recovery [24]. However, only a few
HUCBCs can migrate into the ischemic brain and differentiate into

940

CNS Neuroscience & Therapeutics 20 (2014) 935–944

neural cells [9,24]. Therefore, it is unlikely that the HUCBCinduced neurorestorative effects are due to their differentiation
into neural cells and replacement of the damaged brain tissue. In
this study, HUCBC treatment enhanced poststroke functional outcome in diabetic animals without altering the lesion volume by
enhancing vascular and WM remodeling.
Vascular remodeling via angiogenesis in the IBZ can induce
neurorestorative effects poststroke [30] by improving blood circulation, and oxygen and nutrition supply to ischemic tissue [31].
Diabetic MCAo animals are more prone to vascular injury, arteriosclerosis and have decreased tight junction protein expression,
increased BBB leakage and poor functional outcomes compared to
wild-type MCAo animals [4,15,17]. Our data shows that HUCBC
treatment significantly increased vascular and arterial density
with larger diameters as well as promoted vascular integrity and
decreased BBB leakage in T1DM-MCAo rats. Therefore, increasing
vascular remodeling may contribute to HUCBC-induced neurorestorative effects in T1DM rats.
Under stroke conditions, oligovascular coupling is interrupted,
and this contributes to WM damage [32]. In comparison to gray
matter, WM with its limited blood flow is more susceptible to
stroke. DM stroke mice exhibit significantly increased WM damage and have worse functional outcome compared to the non-DM
stroke mice [17]. Oligodendrocytes and OPCs play critical roles in
WM homeostasis. In the central nervous system, WM is primarily

ischemia yet, poststroke increase in oligodendrocyte numbers can
occur through axon sprouting or regeneration in the peri-infarct
areas of ischemic brain and stimulate brain repair [33]. Oligodendrocytes promote WM and facilitate neurological functional
recovery [34]. We found that HUCBC treatment of stroke in
T1DM rats significantly increased WM remodeling identified by
increased oligodendrocyte and OPC numbers as well as upregulation of axon and myelin density in the WM of the ischemic brain.
HUCBC treatment significantly increased WM remodeling which
may play an important role in mediating neurorestorative effects
after stroke.
The current data indicated that HUCBC treatment of stroke in
T1DM rats significantly promotes vascular and WM remodeling.
The underlying mechanisms of HUCBC-induced neurorestorative effects are not fully understood. Angiopoietins stimulate
new blood vessel formation from preexisting vessels primarily
in the IBZ, playing an important role in angiogenesis and
vascular development in the injured areas [35]. Transgenic

over-expression of Ang1 reduces BBB leakage and increases
vascular stabilization in the ischemic brain [36–38]. The induction of Ang-1 in the IBZ increases the supply of oxygen and
nutrition to damaged tissue and also enhances neurogenesis
and synaptogenesis [39]. T1DM and T2DM stroke animals exhibit significantly decreased brain Ang-1 expression and have
increased vascular damaged in the ischemic brain [15]. HUCBC
treatment significantly increased Ang1 gene and protein expression in the ischemic brain which may be associated enhanced
vascular remodeling and vascular integrity and stabilization in
T1DM-MCAo rats. In addition to regulating vascular remodeling, Ang1 up-regulation also appears to play an important role
in WM remodeling, and decreases overall inflammation [30,40].

and protein level in the ischemic brain. HUCBC and Ang1 treatment both significantly increase capillary tube formation, while
inhibition of Ang1 attenuates HUCBC-induced capillary tube
formation and antiinflammatory factor expression. These data
indicate that increasing Ang1 expression may contribute to HUCBC-induced neurorestorative effects in T1DM.
In addition to Ang-1, our results here indicate that T1DMMCAo rats treated with HUCBCs have significantly decreased
RAGE expression in the ischemic brain. RAGE is a multiligand
receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily that functions as a
cell surface binding site for Ab and cytokine-like mediators exerting proinflammatory activity. Enhanced expression of RAGE is
critical for neurodegenerative pathology and immune and inflammatory responses [41]. The RAGE signaling pathway has been
implicated in promoting inflammation, neuronal death, vascular
injury and brain damage following ischemia [42,43]. RAGE

expression is significantly increased in diabetic stroke animals
[21], and is dramatically increased at sites of WM damage in
regions of demyelination [44]. We found that HUCBC treatment
significantly decreased RAGE expression in the IBZ of T1DMMCAo rats. Ang-1 treatment is significantly correlated with
decreased RAGE expression in cultured brain endothelial cells.
HUCBC treatment induces antiinflammatory effects, such as,
decreasing RAGE and TLR2 expression in cultured BECs, while
inhibition of Ang1 attenuates HUCBC-induced decreased RAGE
expression. Therefore, decreased RAGE expression in the ischemic
brain by HUCBC treatment may be regulated by increasing Ang1
level in the ischemic brain.
The interaction between these various factors; BBB leakage,
inflammation, WM and vascular remodeling are likely important
in stroke pathogenesis and stroke recovery. BBB integrity is central to the maintenance of brain homeostasis and its disruption is
among the initial steps that precede many neurological disorders
[45]. A permeable BBB allows the infiltration of inflammatory
factors from the circulation into the brain and exacerbates brain
damage. In addition, an increase in proinflammatory factors can
promote BBB disruption and even lead to hemorrhagic transformations in diabetic stroke animals [4,46,47]. Systemic inflammation has been shown to worsen BBB disruption and exacerbate
functional deficits after stroke in mice [48,49]. Activation of
immune system has been implicated in neurovascular dysfunction
which manifests itself in the form of BBB disruption [50]. Progressive axonal and myelin damage are associated with a significant
increase in neuroinflammation characterized by elevated expression levels of activated microglia and macrophages [51,52].

Hence, there are links among the inflammatory factors, BBB leakage and vascular and WM changes [53,54]. Thus, it may be
important for stroke therapies to collectively target all aspects of
neurorestoration. As a caveat to this study, long-term survival
experiments, beyond the present 14-day survival, are warranted.

Conclusion
Human umbilical cord blood cells treatment increases Ang-1 and
concomitantly decreases inflammatory factor RAGE expression in
the ischemic brain in T1DM rats, which may in concert at least
partially contribute toward improving functional recovery by
promoting WM and vascular remodeling in the ischemic brain.
