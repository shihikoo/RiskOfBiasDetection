Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in regulating the inflammatory response and immune reactions. In
the central nervous system (CNS), IL-10 is mainly produced by astrocytes and microglia and it is upregulated after various
insults, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, middle cerebral artery occlusion, excitotoxicity and traumatic
brain injury. To better understand the effects of IL-10 in the normal and injured CNS, we generated transgenic mice (termed
GFAP-IL-10Tg) that expressed the murine IL-10 gene under the transcriptional control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) promoter. Previous studies demonstrated marked changes in the microglial phenotype in these mice under basal conditions. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of local astrocyte-targeted IL-10 production on glial
activation, neuronal degeneration and leukocyte recruitment after axotomy. GFAP-IL-10Tg mice had marked changes in the
phenotype of activated microglial cells, as well as in the number of microglial clusters and in microglial cell density. These
microglial changes are accompanied by a twofold increase in lymphocyte infiltration in GFAP-IL-10Tg mice and around twofold decrease in neuronal cell death at 21 dpi. Altogether, our findings suggested that astrocyte-targeted production of IL-10
impacted the microglial response and lymphocyte recruitment and culminated in a beneficial effect on neuronal survival.

Introduction

F

acial nerve axotomy (FNA) is a well-characterized model
of peripheral nerve injury, extensively used for the study
of retrograde neuronal degeneration and regeneration (Makwana and Raivich, 2005; Moran and Graeber, 2004). Facial
motor neuron (FMN) degeneration is accompanied by a
robust activation of microglial cells located in the facial
nucleus (FN). In a first phase, from 2 to 14 dpi, activated
microglial cells proliferate (Raivich et al., 1994), undergo
changes in morphology and the expression of several activation markers (Galiano et al., 2001; Kloss et al., 1999; Raivich
et al., 1998b; Werner et al., 1998), adhere to the neuronal

cell body (Jones et al., 1997; Svensson et al., 1994), and then
displace the neurite terminals in a process termed “synaptic
stripping” (Blinzinger and Kreutzberg, 1968; Kreutzberg,
1996). Between 2 and 3 weeks after injury, activated microglia also form large clusters around dying motor neurons,
phagocytose neuronal debris (Moller et al., 1996; Raivich
et al., 1998b), and, by the expression of MHC-II and costimulatory factors (Bohatschek et al., 2004; Streit et al., 1999)
interact with T-lymphocytes recruited to the axotomized FN
(Byram et al., 2004; Raivich et al., 1998b). In addition to
these neuronal and microglial changes, FNA leads to a biphasic induction of inflammation-associated cytokines: (1) a

rapid upregulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6), TGF-beta, and
MCSF receptor (Bohatschek et al., 2004; Jones et al., 2000;
Raivich et al., 1998a) and (2) a second phase around 14 dpi,
coinciding with the peak of neuronal cell death, with
increased production of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IFNgamma (Raivich et al., 1998b). These inflammationassociated cytokines impact on the fate of axotomized FMN
(Galiano et al., 2001; Kalla et al., 2001; Raivich et al., 2003).
To understand the effect of certain cytokines in the evolution
of CNS lesions, we are currently working in transgenic mice
with CNS-targeted production of specific cytokines. In recent
work, we evaluated the effects of astrocyte-targeted production of IL-6 in the paradigm of FNA and showed that IL-6
induces an increase in FMN cell death associated with
changes in microglial reactivity and increased T lymphocyte
recruitment (Almolda et al., 2014b).
While IL-6 is considered a proinflammatory cytokine
that acts as major modulator of inflammation in the CNS
(Benveniste, 1998; Erta et al., 2012), interleukin-10 (IL-10)
is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that has a pivotal role in
controlling inflammation and modulates peripheral adaptive
immune responses that cause tissue damage (Asadullah, 2003;
Mosmann, 1991; Sabat, 2010; Trinchieri, 2007). In the
CNS, astrocytes and microglia are potential sources of IL-10
production (Hulshof et al., 2002; Ledeboer et al., 2002; Park
et al., 2007), whereas the expression of the IL-10 receptor
(IL-10R) has been described on microglia (Mizuno et al.,
1994; Strle et al., 2002), astrocytes (Pousset et al., 2001; Xin
et al., 2011), oligodendrocytes (Molina-Holgado et al., 2001),
and neurons (Xin et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2009). IL-10
expression is upregulated under pathological conditions,
mainly associated with the recovery phase (Kennedy et al.,
1992; Samoilova et al., 1998) or later time-points after injury
(Apelt and Schliebs, 2001; Gonzalez et al., 2009). Moreover,
systemically administered IL-10 has beneficial effects after different CNS experimental injuries (Spera et al., 1998).
To study the specific effects of local IL-10 production
within the CNS, we have generated a transgenic mouse model
with astrocyte-targeted production of IL-10 (GFAP-IL-10Tg
mice) (Almolda et al., 2014a). Characterization of these transgenic mice revealed altered microglial cell density and morphology as well as changes in the expression of several
activation markers in different brain areas. In the present study,
we investigated whether CNS-targeted IL-10 production exerts
any effect on the microglial and astroglial response, lymphocyte
recruitment and FMN cell death following FNA.

Materials and Methods
Animals
For this study, a total of 66 GFAP-IL-10Tg animals (3 months old)
and a total of 61 wild-type (WT) littermates from both sexes were

July 2015

used. All mice were housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle, with food
and water ad libitum. All experimental animal work was conducted
according to Spanish regulations (Ley 32/2007, Real Decreto 1201/
2005, Ley 9/2003, and Real Decreto 178/2004) in agreement with
European Union directives (86/609/CEE, 91/628/CEE, and 92/65/
CEE) and was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Autonomous University of Barcelona. Every effort was made to minimize
the number of animals used to produce reliable scientific data, as
well as animal suffering and pain.

Facial Nerve Axotomy and Experimental Groups
GFAP-IL-10Tg and WT mice were anesthetized with a solution of
xylazine (20 mg/kg) and ketamine (80 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally at dose of 0.01 mL/g. The skin behind the right ear was shaved
and cleansed with 70% ethanol. A small incision was made and skin
and muscle were gently separated to expose the right facial nerve.
One millimeter of the facial nerve main branch was resected at the
level of the stylomastoid foramen. Following the surgery, the skin
was sutured with 5-0 nylon. Corneal dehydration was prevented by
application of Lacri-lubeV eye ointment. After anesthesia recovery,
the complete whisker paralysis was assessed to ensure correct facial
nerve resection.
Nonlesioned and axotomized animals were distributed in different experimental groups and euthanized at 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28
days postinjury (dpi) for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) analysis and immunohistochemistry, whereas another set of
animals were euthanized at 21 dpi and used for motor neuron survival quantification.

Sample Processing for RT-PCR
Nonlesioned and axotomized animals were used for RT-PCR analysis. Animals were deeply anesthetized with a solution of xylazine
(20 mg/kg) and ketamine (80 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally
(0.015 mL/g) and intracardially perfused with a solution containing
phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and 0.1% of diethyl pyrocarbonate
water (DEPC, Sigma, 40718). Brains were quickly dissected out, frozen using dry ice and stored at 280 C until use. Two coronal 400mm thick sections of the brainstem containing the facial nucleus
region were obtained using a JUNG CM 3000 Leica cryostat and
placed on glass slides under RNase-free conditions. The contralateral
and the ipsilateral facial nucleus were separately collected, lysed by
mechanical disruption in Trizol reagent (Qiagen) and homogenized
following the procedure provided by the manufacturer. Isolated
mRNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using a first-strand synthesis kit and M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega Corporation,
MA). Samples were heated at 70 C for 5 min to eliminate any secondary structures, then incubated at 23 C for 10 min, 1 h at 37 C,
and 5 min at 95 C before being chilled at 4 C using a thermocycler
T Gradient (Whatman, Biometra). The amount of cDNA was quantified with iTaq Universal SYBRV Green Supermix (Bio Rad) using a
Bio Rad RT-PCR iCycler. Each PCR reaction was performed in triplicate with the following cycling parameters: 10 min at 95 C and 40
cycles of 1 min at 95 C, 1 min at 60 C and 1 min at 72 C, followed by a melting curve analysis. RT-PCR primers were designed
in two different exons; primer length was comprised between 18 and
R

30 bp, GC content was between 40 and 60% and nonspecific
primer annealing and mismatches were minimized. The presence of
nonspecific products of amplification and primer-dimer presence
were evaluated by melting curve analysis during RT-PCR primer validation. The following primers were used to amplify the transcripts
of interest:
GADPH 50 : CATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGC
GADPH 30 : ACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG
IL-10 50 : AAGGGTTACTTGGGTTGCCA
IL-10 30 : TTTCTGGGCCATGCTTCTCT
Fold differences of expression were calculated using the comparative method, also referred as DDCt Method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). The sample of WT nonlesioned FN was used as the
reference sample or calibrator.

Tissue Processing for Histological Analysis
Animals were deeply anesthetized as described above and perfused
intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4). Brains were removed and postfixed in the same fixative
for 4 h at 4 C and, after rinsing in phosphate buffer, cryopreserved
for 48 h in a 30% sucrose solution and frozen with 2-methylbutane
solution (Sigma-Aldrich). Coronal sections (30-mm-thick) of the
brainstem containing the facial nucleus (FN) were obtained using a
CM3050s Leica cryostat. For immunohistochemistry studies, series
of parallel free-floating sections were stored at 220 C in Olmos
antifreeze solution until their late use. For motor neuron survival
quantification, consecutive FN sections were collected on gelatincoated slides.

Motor Neuron Survival Quantification
Consecutive FN sections (30-mm-thick) mounted on gelatin-coated
slides were stained with a solution containing 0.1% toluidine blue
diluted in Wallpole buffer (0.05 M, pH 4.5). After staining, sections
were dehydrated in a sequence of graded alcohols, N-butyl alcohol
and xylene. Subsequently, sections were coverslipped with DPX, a
nonaqueous mounting medium.
The contralateral and the ipsilateral side of every section
through the entire FN were examined and photographed using a
DXM1200 Nikon digital camera joined to a brightfield Nikon
Eclipse E600 microscope. The photographs were analyzed with digital AnalySISV software (Soft Imaging System). In addition to the
total number of neurons, maximum and minimum diameters of
neuronal profiles in the FN were recorded in order to obtain the
mean diameter. To compensate for double counting neurons in adjacent sections, the Abercrombie’s correction factor (Abercrombie,
1946) was applied as previously reported (Almolda et al., 2014b).

Single Immunohistochemistry
Free-floating cryostat sections were processed for the visualization of
IL-10 receptor (IL-10R), Iba1, CD16/32, CD11b, CD18, Ym-1,
CD150, Arginase-1, CD39, MHC-II, GFAP and CD3 markers as
previously described (Almolda et al., 2011). Briefly, after 10 min of
endogenous peroxidase blocking with 2% H2O2 in 70% methanol,
sections were blocked for 1 h in 0.05 M Tris-buffered saline (TBS),
pH 7.4, containing 10% foetal calf serum, 3% bovine serum albu-

1168

min (BSA) and 1% Triton X-100. Subsequently, sections were incubated overnight at 4 C followed by 1 h at room temperature (RT)
with rabbit anti-IL-10R (1:50; Sc-985; Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-Iba1
(1:3,000; 019-19741; Wako), rat anti-CD16/32 (1:1,000; 553142;
BD Pharmingen), rat anti-CD18 (1:2,000; MCA1032G, AbD Serotec), rabbit anti-Ym-1 (1:400; 01404; Stem Cell Technology), rat
anti-CD150 (1:125; MCA2274; AbD Serotec), goat anti-Arginase-1
(1:100; Sc-18354; Santa Cruz), sheep anti-CD39 (1:500; AF4398;
R&D Systems), rat anti-MHC-II (1:25; TIB-120, Hybridoma supernatant ATCC), rabbit anti-GFAP (1:1,800; Z0334; Dakopatts), or
hamster anti-CD3 (1:500; MCA2690; AbD Serotec) antibodies
diluted in the same blocking solution. In the case of IL-10R, incubation was done for 48 h at 4 C followed by 1 h at room temperature
(RT). In the case of Ym-1, all the washes were performed with TBS.
Sections incubated in media lacking the primary antibody were used
as negative control and spleen sections as positive control. After
washes with TBS11% Triton, sections were incubated at RT for 1 h
with biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500; BA-1000;
Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA), biotinylated anti-rat secondary antibody (1:500; BA-4001; Vector Laboratories), biotinylated
anti-goat secondary antibody (1:500; BA-9500; Vector Laboratories),
biotinylated anti-sheep secondary antibody (1:500; BA-6000; Vector
Laboratories), or biotinylated anti-hamster secondary antibody
(1:500; BA-9100; Vector Laboratories) diluted in the blocking solution. After 1 h at RT in horseradish streptavidin-peroxidase (1:500;
SA-5004; Vector Laboratories), the reaction was visualized by incubating the sections with a DAB kit (SK-4100; Vector Laboratories)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, sections were
mounted on gelatin-coated slides, counterstained with toluidine
blue, dehydrated in graded alcohols and, after xylene treatment, coverslipped with DPX. Sections were analyzed and photographed with
a DXM 1200F Nikon digital camera joined to a Nikon Eclipse 80i
microscope.

Double and Triple Immunohistochemistry
Double-immunolabelling was performed by firstly processing the
free-floating sections for Iba1 as described above, but using Alexa
FluorV 488 conjugated anti-rabbit (1:1,000, A-21206; Molecular
Probes) as secondary antibody. After several washes with TBS 1%
Triton, sections were incubated overnight at 4 C followed by 1 h at
RT with rat anti-MHC-II. Sections were then incubated for 1 h at
RT in Alexa FluorV 555 conjugated anti-rat secondary antibody
(1:1,000; A31570; Molecular Probes). For the study of IL-10R
colocalization, sections were processed for IL-10R staining as
described above but using Alexa FluorV 555 conjugated streptavidin
instead of horseradish streptavidin-peroxidase (1:1,000; S-32355;
Molecular Probes). Then, sections were incubated overnight at 4 C
and 1 h at RT with mouse anti-GFAP (1:6,000; 63893, Sigma) followed by Alexa FluorV 488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody(1:1,000; A11029; Molecular Probes). Triple stainimmunolabelling combining CD3, MHC-II, and Iba1 was carried
out by firstly incubating sections with CD3 as described above but
using Alexa FluorV 555 conjugated streptavidin at RT for 1 h
(1:1,000; S-32355; Molecular Probes) instead of horseradish
streptavidin-peroxidase. Then, sections were incubated overnight at

stained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 1:10,000;

LSM 700 confocal microscope.

Brightfield Microscopy Quantification
Quantitative analysis was performed on sections immunolabelled for
Iba1, CD16/32, CD18 and MHC-II. At least three WT and three
GFAP-IL-10Tg animals per time postaxotomy were analyzed. At
least three representative sections from the brainstem containing the
central part of the FN from both the contralateral and the ipsilateral
sides from each animal were photographed at 103 magnification.
The percentage of area covered by the immunolabelling and the
intensity of the immunoreaction (Mean Gray Value) for each marker
were analyzed using ImageJV software (Wayne Rasband, National
Institutes of Health). For each animal, the gray grade quotient
(GGQ) was obtained by dividing the Mean Gray Value on the ipsilateral side by the Mean Gray Value on the contralateral side. The
intensity grade (IG) was calculated by multiplying the percentage of
the immunolabelled area by the GGQ. In the case of CD16/32 and
MHC-II where staining of these molecules was absent or very low in
the contralateral FN, the AI index (% Area immunolabelled multiplied by the Mean Gray Value) was used.
In order to quantify microglial cell density, sections stained for
Iba1 from a minimum of five WT and five GFAP-IL-10Tg animals
at 3, 7, and 28 dpi were analyzed. At least three representative sections from the brainstem containing the central part of the FN from
both the contralateral and the ipsilateral FN were analyzed per animal. Three photographs of each section were taken at high magnification (403). The total number of nucleated Iba1-positive cells were
performed on each microphotograph (0.0037 mm2 frame) using
“Cell counter” plug-in from NIH Image JV software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health) and expressed as cells/mm2.
Quantification of microglial clusters, i.e., groups of at least
three or more nucleated microglial cells, was performed at 14 and
21 dpi on sections stained for Iba1, in a minimum of five WT and
five GFAP-IL-10Tg animals. At least three representative sections
from the brainstem containing the central part of the FN from each
animal were captured at 103 magnification. The number of microglial clusters per section were obtained using “Cell counter” plug-in
from NIH Image JV software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes
of Health) and expressed as Iba1 positive clusters/section.
To evaluate T lymphocyte infiltration in the FN, a minimum
of five WT and five GFAP-IL-10Tg animals at 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28
dpi were used. At least three representative sections from the brainstem stained for CD3 containing the central part of the FN for each
animal were captured at 103 magnification. All CD3 positive cells
in each microphotograph were counted using the “Cell counter”
plug-in from ImageJV software (National Institutes of Health) and
expressed as CD3 positive cells/section.

Results
IL-10 mRNA Expression
Using RT-PCR quantification, we observed that although IL10 mRNA is expressed constitutively in the nonlesioned FN
of both WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg mice, expression was substantially higher in GFAP-IL-10Tg mice than in WT (Fig.
1). Similarly in lesioned animals, the amount of IL-10
mRNA was always higher in the contralateral side of GFAPIL-10Tg animals than in the contralateral side of WT and
remained unaltered along the different time-points studied. In
the ipsilateral side of lesioned WT animals, IL-10 mRNA
expression only increased at 21 dpi, in comparison with its
corresponding contralateral; whereas in GFAP-IL-10Tg mice,
the ipsilateral side (compared with its corresponding contralateral side) showed a marked increase at 28 dpi. Notably, in
the ipsilateral side of GFAP-IL-10Tg mice, IL-10 mRNA

expression was significantly higher than in the ipsilateral side
of WT in all time-points analyzed after FNA.
IL-10R Staining
IL-10R staining was found in the FMN of the contralateral side
of both WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg (Fig. 2A,B). After FNA, IL-10R
staining intensity was considerably lower in the ipsilateral side of
both WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg at 7 dpi (Fig. 2C,D). At 14 dpi,

whereas IL-10R staining remained low in the ipsilateral side of
WT, GFAP-IL-10Tg mice presented an increase in IL-10R (Fig.

IL-10R staining than WT in the ipsilateral, though, the intensity
was still lower than the observed in the contralateral side. Along
all time-points analyzed after FNA, IL-10R staining was restricted
to the FMN and it was not detected in astrocytes, as assessed by
double immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2G,H).

Microglial Activation
To assess the effects of astrocyte-targeted IL-10 production on
the activation of microglial cells along the different timepoints (3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 dpi) after FNA, we have analyzed the staining of Iba1, a commonly used microglial
marker; CD16/32, the Fc gamma Receptor III and Fc
gamma Receptor II expressed by phagocytosing microglia/
macrophages; CD18, a subunit of the integrin MAC-1
expressed on the surface of some leukocytes including macrophages and related to cell adhesion; and CD150, Ym-1 and
Arginase-1 as markers of alternatively activated microglia/
macrophages. In addition, staining of the major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II), involved in the process of antigen presentation; and CD39, an ectonucleotidase involved in
the recruitment, activation and polarization of naive T cells
(Dwyer et al., 2007) were analyzed. Due to the lack of differences between the nonlesioned FN and the contralateral side,
in both WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg mice, all results relative to
microglial activation analysis in the ipsilateral side along the
different time-points after FNA are in reference to the corresponding contralateral side.
Iba1 Staining. In both WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg mice,

staining of Iba1 in the contralateral side of the FN
(Fig. 3A,B) at all studied time-points was observed in ramified microglial cells that were distributed homogenously
throughout all the FN parenchyma without any special interaction with either facial motor neurons (FMN) or other glial
cells. Moreover, the number of Iba1 positive cells in the contralateral sides was similar in WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg mice
(Fig. 3O).
After FNA, noticeable changes in the morphology and
density of microglial cells were observed in the ipsilateral FN
of both WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg. At 3 dpi, in both WT and
GFAP-IL-10Tg animals, microglial cells changed their morphology from a resting-ramified appearance to an activated
appearance, i.e., enlarging their cell body, showing retraction
of processes and starting to approach the FMN (Fig.
3C,D,P,Q). At this time-point, a similar increase in Iba1
staining was observed in both groups of animals (Fig. 3M).
Also at this time-point, a 6 fold-increase in the number of
Iba1 positive cells was observed in both WT and GFAP-IL10Tg animals (Fig. 3O). At 7 dpi, microglial cells increased
Iba1 staining (Fig. 3E,F,M) and adopted a satellite position
surrounding the soma of FMN with their cell bodies and
processes. At this time-point, quantitative analysis showed
that the number of microglial cells increased 2 fold in both
groups of animals (Fig. 3O). At 14 dpi, FMN were surrounded and completely wrapped by microglial cells but not
appreciable differences were found when comparing both
groups of animals (Fig. 3G-H,R-S). In addition, in both WT
1172

and GFAP-IL-10Tg, it was easy to distinguish the presence of
microglial clusters which were highly stained for Iba1 (Fig.
3T,U). At this time-point, GFAP-IL-10Tg mice showed a
higher number of microglial clusters compared with WT
(Fig. 3N). At 21 dpi, Iba1 staining decreased in both WT
and GFAP-IL-10Tg animals (Fig. 3I,J,M), however, when
compared with the previous time-point, WT mice showed a
slight increase in the number of microglial clusters whereas
GFAP-IL-10Tg experienced a pronounced decrease (Fig. 3N).
No significant changes in microglial distribution were
observed in terms of FMN wrapping. At 28 dpi, a large
decrease in the microglial Iba1 staining was found in both
groups, but did not reach the basal levels observed in the contralateral FN (Fig. 3K,L,V,W). Also, a considerable reduction
in the density of microglia was observed in both groups of
animals when compared with 21 dpi, though, the number of
Iba1 positive cell remained notably higher in GFAP-IL-10Tg
animals (Fig. 3O).
CD18 Staining. In both WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg mice,
CD18 stained microglial cells were observed in the contralateral side of the FN (Fig. 4A,B,N,O). In the ipsilateral side of
both groups of animals, CD18 staining in microglial cells followed a similar pattern as described above for Iba1 staining
(Fig. 4C–L,M) with strong CD18 staining in association with
microglial clusters (Fig. 4T,U). GFAP-IL-10Tg mice showed
slightly higher CD18 staining at 3 and 14 dpi when compared with WT (Fig. 4C,D,G,H,P,Q,T,U).

No CD16/32 staining was detected in
the contralateral side of both groups of animals (Fig. 5A,B).
However, after FNA, CD16/32 staining was observed in the
ipsilateral FN side of both groups of animals as soon as 3 dpi
(Fig. 5C,D,N,O). CD16/32 staining was always found in
relation to microglial cells. A similar temporal staining pattern to that described for Iba1 immunostaining was observed
in terms of CD16/32 positive cell distribution in the lesioned
FN of both WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg mice (Fig. 5C–L).
Moreover, in both groups, microglial clusters showed strong
CD16/32 staining. In the ipsilateral FN of WT, CD16/32
staining increased from 3 dpi, peaked at 14 dpi, and progressively decreased at 21 and 28 dpi (Fig. 5M). In GFAP-IL10Tg mice, CD16/32 staining was significantly higher than
WT mice at 3 and 7 dpi (Fig. 5C–F,N–Q) and then drop at
21 dpi, showing lower levels than those observed in WT (Fig.
5I,J,R,S). Notably, in GFAP-IL-10Tg mice but not WT, an
increase in CD16/32 staining was observed at 28 dpi (Fig.
5K,L,M,T,U).

Alternative Activation Markers. In both WT and GFAP-IL10Tg mice, CD39 was found in ramified microglial cells as
well as in blood vessels in the contralateral side. After FNA,

CD39 staining resembles the pattern observed for Iba1, i.e.,
wrapping FMN at early time-points and forming clusters at
14 and 21 dpi (Fig. 6A–D). No marked differences were
observed between the two groups of animals except that the
number of clusters with CD39 positive staining was higher in
the transgenic animals. Besides, CD39 staining in the blood
vessels remained unaltered in both WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg
along all time-points after FNA (Fig. 6A–D).
No staining of CD150, Ym-1 or Arginase-1 was found
in the contralateral side of both WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg.
After FNA, CD150 staining was occasionally found in both
WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg in some ramified microglial-like cells
along all time-points analyzed. At 14 dpi, CD150 expression
was in close relationship to microglial clusters (Fig. 6E,G). No
differences in CD150 distribution were observed between the
two experimental groups. For Ym-1, neither WT nor GFAPIL-10Tg mice showed staining in any of the time-points analyzed (data not shown). Arginase-1 staining was found in both
WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg only at 3 dpi in some poorly ramified microglial-like cells and no differences between the two
groups of animals were observed (Fig. 6F,H).
July 2015

No MHC-II staining was detected in the
contralateral side of both groups of animals (data not shown).
After FNA, MHC-II staining started to be detectable in the
lesioned FN of both WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg animals at 7
dpi (Fig. 7A,B). Double immunohistochemistry demonstrated
that MHC-II staining always colocalized with Iba1 (Fig. 7J–
Q). At 7 dpi, based on their morphology, MHC-II positive
cells appear to be perivascular macrophages (Fig. 7J–M) and
did not associate with FMN. At 14 dpi, while MHC-II staining in WT remained similar to that observed at 7 dpi, in
GFAP-IL-10Tg animals, a significant peak of MHC-II staining was observed at this time-point (Fig. 7C,D,I). At 14 dpi,
in both WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg animals, in addition to perivascular macrophages, MHC-II staining was found in activated ramified microglial cells forming clusters (Fig.
7C,D,G,H,N,Q). At 21 dpi, although some ramified MHCII positive cells were still observed in both groups (Fig.
7E,F), MHC-II staining started a progressive decrease until
28 dpi and no significant differences between WT and
GFAP-IL-10Tg mice were found at these two time-points
(Fig. 7I).

Astrocyte Activation
GFAP staining was used to assess astrocyte activation. Both
WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg mice presented considerably low levels of GFAP expression in the contralateral side of the FN
(Fig. 8A,B). After FNA, in both groups, GFAP staining
intensity started to increase at 3 dpi, reaching a maximum at
14 dpi and remaining elevated until 28 dpi (Fig. 8C–F,G).
No significant differences in either distribution or intensity of
GFAP between WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg mice in any of the
different time-points analyzed were observed.
Lymphocyte Infiltration
To assess lymphocyte infiltration in the axotomized FN, sections
immunolabelled for CD3 were analyzed. No CD3 positive cells
were found in the nonlesioned FN in neither WT nor GFAPIL-10Tg animals and in the contralateral side at any of the timepoints studied (data not shown). In the ipsilateral FN of axotomized WT animals, CD3 positive cells started to be seen at 3 dpi
and their number progressively increased until 21 dpi and
remained similar at 28 dpi (Fig. 9A). In GFAP-IL-10Tg mice,
CD3 positive cells were also detected at 3 dpi and increased
reaching a peak at 21 dpi before abruptly falling in number at
28 dpi (Fig. 9A). When compared with the WT, a twofold
increase in the total number of CD3 positive T-cells was found
1176

in GFAP-IL-10Tg mice at 14 and 21 dpi (Fig. 9A–C). As
assessed by triple immunohistochemistry, in both WT and
GFAP-IL-10Tg mice, CD3 positive cells were found in close
relationship to MHC-II positive microglial clusters (Fig. 9D–I).
Neuronal Survival
To determine whether the altered phenotype of microglial cells
and the increased infiltration of CD3 positive T-cells observed
in GFAP-IL-10Tg animals had any effect on motor neuron
survival after FNA, the total number of FMN in both the contralateral and the ipsilateral sides of the entire FN were
counted on sections stained with Toluidine blue (Fig. 10).
Whereas, no differences in neuronal cell number were found
in the contralateral sides of both WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg
mice, a significant decrease in the total number of FMN was
detected in the ipsilateral sides of both groups of animals at 21
dpi (Fig. 10A–D). Notably, neuronal survival was higher in
the ipsilateral FN of GFAP-IL-10Tg, where the percentage of
surviving FMN was 81.49 6 3.12%, in front to the
65.41 6 3.16% found in the ipsilateral side of WT (Fig. 10E).

Discussion
Our results showed that after FNA, GFAP-IL-10Tg mice
showed significant changes in the staining of different molecules associated with the microglial activation pattern, such as

CD16/32, CD18 and MHC-II, as well as in the number of
microglial clusters and in microglial cell density. Furthermore,
a higher CD3 positive lymphocyte infiltration was observed
on the axotomized FN of GFAP-IL-10Tg mice. These
changes in microglial activation and lymphocyte recruitment
correlated with a reduced motor neuron death at 21 dpi.
Altogether, our findings suggest that astrocyte-targeted

production of IL-10 in this paradigm exerts a beneficial effect
on neuronal survival and has an impact over microglial and
lymphocyte response after FNA.

degeneration, neuronal survival and nerve regeneration (Moran
and Graeber, 2004). After nerve transection in mice, most
authors have reported around 20–40% of FMN loss (Ferri
et al., 1998; Sendtner et al., 1996), peaking around 14 days
postaxotomy (Moller et al., 1996), though, it has been reported
that the total number of motor neurons can progressively
decrease until 10 weeks after axotomy (Serpe et al., 2000). In
our study, astrocyte-targeted IL-10 production showed a strong
beneficial effect on neuronal survival. Consistent with our
results, neuroprotective effects promoted by IL-10 administration have been described after focal stroke (Spera et al., 1998),
excitotoxic (Brewer et al., 1999), or traumatic (Bethea et al.,
1999) spinal cord injury and after peripheral sciatic nerve transection (Atkins et al., 2007). In agreement with other authors,
(Xin et al., 2011), we found that FMN constitutively express
IL-10R and after FNA, this expression is lower but maintained
along all time-points of this study. Thus, neuroprotective
1178

actions of transgenic IL-10 could be explained by a direct effect
on these motor neurons, either acting as a neurotrophic factor
(Zhou et al., 2009) or preventing neuronal death (Sharma et al.,
2011). In this regard, in our study IL-10 mRNA levels in
GFAP-IL-10Tg mice were significantly higher in the ipsilateral
side than in the corresponding contralateral side at later timepoints. However, as GFAP-IL-10Tg mice presented important
changes in microglial reactivity and lymphocyte infiltration, we
cannot exclude that transgenic expression of IL-10 also exerts an
indirect effect on both cell populations and hence it contributes
to neuroprotective phenomenon we observe. Therefore, we will
discuss these issues below.
Altered Microglial Reactivity in GFAP-IL-10Tg Mice
After FNA
Microglial activation in the FNA paradigm has been extensively studied (Ha et al., 2006; Jinno and Yamada, 2011;

Kalla et al., 2001; Schoen et al., 1992). Within a few days
after nerve transection, microglia become activated, proliferate
and migrate, surrounding the axotomized FMN (Svensson
et al., 1994). In these earlier stages, it has been described that
perineuronal microglia or its processes are placed between the
synaptic terminals and the surface of injured FMN, a phenomenon known as “synaptic stripping”, in order to disconnect these neurons and allow further axonal regeneration
(Graeber et al., 1993; Kreutzberg, 1996; Perry and O’Connor, 2010). At later stages after axotomy, those FMN that are
not able to regenerate their axon undergo death, leading to
further activation of microglia (Graeber et al., 1993). Around
28 dpi, when the functionality of regenerated FMN has been
July 2015

recovered, most microglial cells start to adopt a restingramified morphology (Almolda et al., 2014b).
These changes in morphology and distribution of
microglial cells are accompanied by alterations in the level of
a broad range of factors, including increased expression of
cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules and markers
of microglial activation, such as Iba1, CR3 complement
receptors and MHC I and II (Moran and Graeber, 2004; Raivich et al., 1998b). In the present study, despite the absence
of overt variation in the morphology of the cells or the
amount of Iba1 staining on reactive microglial cells of GFAPIL-10Tg animals when compared with WT, there were other
changes in the phenotype of activated microglial cells in these
1179

transgenic mice that may be closely related to the reduction
in neuronal death.
A majority of these changes occurred during the early
phase of microglial activation, from 3 to 14 dpi, when we
observed an increase in the staining of CD16/32 and CD18
in activated microglial cells of GFAP-IL-10Tg animals, suggesting a more rapid or robust response of these cells probably due to the increased basal level of IL-10 observed in
these animals. CD16/32 is a molecule extensively related to
phagocytic activity (Indik et al., 1995; Jovanova-Nesic et al.,
2012; Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2006), one of the important
features displayed by microglial cells after FNA (Raivich
et al., 1999; Rinaman et al., 1991). Due to the fact that in
some circumstances, phagocytic activity of microglia has been
linked with a beneficial role promoting the regenerative
response (Neumann et al., 2009); together with the increased
FMN survival detected in GFAP-IL-10Tg mice lead us to
speculate that a higher microglial phagocytic activity at early
time-points may support FMN survival.
In addition to changes in CD16/32, a higher staining
of CD18 was found in activated microglia of GFAP-IL10Tg mice at 3 and 14 dpi. CD18, an integrin that forms
part of the complement receptor 3 (CR3), has been shown
to be upregulated in microglial cells after FNA in both rats
(Graeber et al., 1988; Moneta et al., 1993) and mice as
early as 1 dpi (Galiano et al., 2001; Kloss et al., 1999)
reaching a peak at 7 dpi, when microglial cells are wrapping
the FMN. It is known that CD18 integrin is implicated in
the adhesion of microglia to the axotomized FMN as well
as to the infiltrated lymphocytes observed in the clusters
(Kloss et al., 1999). It could be expected then, that in
GFAP-IL-10Tg mice increased CD18 in microglial cells will
lead to a stronger adhesion facilitating the phenomenon of
“synaptic stripping” and therefore promoting a higher survival of FMN. In this regard, expression of this integrin by
activated microglial cells has already been suggested to play
a role in maintaining neuronal survival in this paradigm by
some authors (Makwana et al., 2007). In contrast, it is also
plausible that this increase in CD18 is involved and promotes the formation and preservation of microglial clusters
in GFAP-IL-10Tg animals.
Moreover, our study showed that in either WT or
GFAP-IL-10Tg animals activated microglia after FNA did
not or barely expressed Ym-1, Arginase 1, and CD150, which
are markers usually associated with the so-called alternative
microglia/macrophage activation. However, in contrast, we
observed high expression of CD39, an ectonucleotidase highly
expressed in M2 macrophages. By regulating purine concentrations in the extracellular space, CD39 on alternative activated macrophages can reduce the ATP concentration in the
extracellular environment which in turn can increase the anti1180

inflammatory and tissue remodeling activities of these cells
(Csoka et al., 2012).
Altogether, our findings, in agreement with those of
others (Aldskogius, 2011; Walter and Neumann, 2009), support the idea that microglial activation cannot be exclusively
associated with harmful actions after peripheral nerve injury
but rather it is a multi-faceted event that leads to neuroprotection under determined circumstances (Hao et al., 2007;
Lalancette-Hebert et al., 2007).
Microglial proliferation is another important feature in
the evolution of FNA (Svensson et al., 1994). At early stages
after peripheral nerve injury, microglial cells undergo proliferation (Raivich et al., 1994) and, at later stages after lesion,
activated microglia are gradually eliminated by programmed
cell death (Jones et al., 1997), showing the maximum amount
of death at 14 dpi (Conde and Streit, 2006), to achieve a
steady state of microglial cell numbers. As expected, in our
study the number of microglial cells significantly increased at
3 and 7 dpi on the lesioned FN. We did not find differences
between WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg mice, suggesting that, in
agreement with other studies (Kloss et al., 1997; Sawada
et al., 1999), IL-10 production does not have a direct effect
on microglial proliferation at least in this paradigm. Remarkably, at 28 dpi and coinciding with a higher IL-10 mRNA
expression in GFAP-IL-10Tg mice, microglial cell density in
the lesioned FN was notably higher in these animals than in
WT, suggesting that overproduction of IL-10 could be protecting microglial cells in transgenic animals against programmed cell death. In this regard, it has been shown that, in
vitro, IL-10 promotes microglial survival (Strle et al., 2002).
Increased Microglial Clustering and Lymphocyte
Infiltration in GFAP-IL-10Tg Mice
One interesting difference found in our study in relation to
the pattern of microglial activation in GFAP-IL-10Tg mice
was the higher number of microglial clusters observed at 14
dpi. Microglial cluster formation has been commonly linked
with phagocytosis of dead neurons (Raivich et al., 1998b),
and some authors have used the number of microglial clusters
as an indirect way to measure motor neuronal death (Petitto
et al., 2003). However, we have shown that in GFAP-IL-6Tg
animals a lower number of microglial clusters correlates with
higher neuronal death (Almolda et al., 2014b). In the current
study, we observed that GFAP-IL-10Tg mice exhibited an
increased number of clusters correlating with less motor neuron cell death, indicating again that microglial cluster formation does not correlate with increased death of FMN.
Changes in microglial cluster formation together with the
higher CD16/32 and CD18 staining observed at earlier timepoints in GFAP-IL-10Tg mice could be related to faster or
more effective phagocytosis by microglial cells although,

increased expression of CD39 in microglial clusters may also
be related to an attenuated phagocytosis (Bulavina et al.,
2013). In addition, it is also possible that microglial cluster
formation may have another function rather than simple
phagocytosis of degenerating neurons. Recent studies in multiple sclerosis showed the presence of microglial cell clusters
in pre-active lesions with high expression of IL-10, suggesting
that they may play a role as regulators of inflammation (van
Horssen et al., 2012). Interestingly, MHC-II staining was
found strictly in the microglial clusters of both groups of animals, with significantly higher staining in GFAP-IL-10Tg
mice. The fact that GFAP-IL-10Tg animals had an increase
in MHC-II staining was surprising as a down-regulatory
effect of IL-10 on MHC-II expression has been described
(Howard and O’Garra, 1992; Moore et al., 2001). The ability of activated microglial cells to express MHC-II after FNA
has been widely described (Jones et al., 2005; Kiefer and
Kreutzberg, 1991; Petitto et al., 2003) and linked to their
capacity to interact with infiltrating lymphocytes (Byram
et al., 2004; Olsson et al., 1992). Thus, the higher expression
of this molecule in GFAP-IL-10Tg mice indicated possible
changes in the microglial-lymphocyte cross-talk.
Besides microglial activation, a key event following
FNA in mice is the ability of T-cells to infiltrate the FN
July 2015

parenchyma and aggregate around axotomized FMN (Raivich
et al., 1998b). Signals involved in lymphocyte recruitment in
this paradigm are poorly described. In this context, ectoenzymes and specifically ectonucleotidases are known to play
an important role in leukocyte trafficking. CD39 is an ectonucleotidase associated with microglia, endothelial cells and
Treg lymphocytes whose expression appears to regulate nucleotide and nucleoside-mediated signaling of lymphocyte migration and differentiation (Dwyer et al., 2007). The fact, that
in our study we found expression of CD39 not only in
parenchymal microglia but also in microglial cell clusters,
points to this ectonucleotidase as a putative candidate to
modulate lymphocyte infiltration after FNA. Numerous studies attributed a neuroprotective role to lymphocyte recruitment in this paradigm since lack of mature T and B cells
leads to an increase in neuronal death after FNA (Serpe et al.,
2000). Moreover, this neurodegeneration was reversed following reconstitution of mice with functional T and B cells
(Serpe et al., 1999). In agreement with a putative protective
role, our results showed higher T-lymphocyte infiltration in
the FN parenchyma of GFAP-IL-10Tg animals at 14 and 21
dpi, correlating with an increase in neuronal survival. In both
WT and GFAP-IL-10Tg animals, infiltrated CD3 positive Tcells were found in close relationship with microglial clusters
1181

where enhanced expression of CD39 was found. As mentioned above, MHC-II staining was exclusively found in these
clusters, reinforcing the idea that microglial cells might be
acting as antigen presenting cells in these locations. Among
the different subtypes of T-cells, specifically CD41 Th2 cells
are responsible for the neuroprotective effect in the axotomized FN (Serpe et al., 2003; Xin et al., 2008). IL-10 is known
for its ability to induce the differentiation of CD41 T-cells
toward an immunoregulatory phenotype, the Tr1 cells (Groux
et al., 1997). Whether CD41 Th2 or another regulatory Tcell subtype are responsible for the neuroprotective effect in
GFAP-IL-10Tg mice, as well as the activation state of these
lymphocytes, need to be elucidated in further studies.
In conclusion, as summarized in Fig. 11, this study
clearly demonstrated that astrocyte-targeted production of IL10 induces an increase in neuronal survival that correlates
with changes in the microglial phenotype, density and microglial clustering. This improvement in neuronal survival is also
accompanied by a substantially higher T-cell recruitment to
the axotomized FN. Taken together, our results suggest that
IL-10 production within the CNS can lead to significant
modifications in the pattern of microglial activation and Tcell infiltration and may exert a beneficial effect on the outcome of peripheral nerve injury.
