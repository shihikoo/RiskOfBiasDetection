Abstract
Background: Inflammation plays a key role in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke. Some proinflammatory
mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, are produced in stroke. Chemokine-like factor 1 (CKLF1), as a novel
C-C chemokine, displays chemotactic activities in a wide spectrum of leukocytes and plays an important role in
brain development. In previous studies, we have found that the expression of CKLF1 increased in rats after focal
cerebral ischemia and treatment with the CKLF1 antagonist C19 peptide decreased the infarct size and water content.
However, the role of CKLF1 in stroke is still unclear. The objective of the present study was to ascertain the possible
roles and mechanism of CKLF1 in ischemic brain injury by applying anti-CKLF1 antibody.
Methods: Male Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to one-hour middle cerebral artery occlusion. Antibody to CKLF1
was applied to the right cerebral ventricle immediately after reperfusion; infarct volume and neurological score were
measured at 24 and 72 hours after cerebral ischemia. RT-PCR, Western blotting and ELISA were utilized to characterize
the expression of adhesion molecules, inflammatory factors and MAPK signal pathways. Immunohistochemical staining
and myeloperoxidase activity was used to determine the extent of neutrophil infiltration.
Results: Treatment with anti-CKLF1 antibody significantly decreased neurological score and infarct volume in a dosedependent manner at 24 and 72 hours after cerebral ischemia. Administration with anti-CKLF1 antibody lowered the
level of inflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β, MIP-2 and IL-8, the expression of adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in
a dose-dependent manner. The results of immunohistochemical staining and detection of MPO activity indicated that
anti-CKLF1 antibody inhibited neutrophil infiltration. Further studies suggested MAPK pathways associated with
neutrophil infiltration in cerebral ischemia.
Conclusions: Selective inhibition of CKLF1 activity significantly protects against ischemia/reperfusion injury by
decreasing production of inflammatory mediators and expression of adhesion molecules, thereby reducing neutrophils
recruitment to the ischemic area, possibly via inhibiting MAPK pathways. Therefore, CKLF1 may be a novel target for
the treatment of stroke.

Background
Inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke and other forms of ischemic brain
injury. Cerebral ischemia triggers a cascade of proinflammatory molecular and cellular events, such as rapid
activation of resident cells, infiltration of various types
of inflammatory cells into the ischemic brain tissue, and
production of proinflammatory mediators, including cytokines and chemokines [1-3].
Chemokines are small, inducible, secreted, proinflammatory cytokines that act primarily as chemoattractants
and activators of granulocytes, macrophages, and other
inflammatory cells [4,5]. Chemokines constitute a large
family of structurally related cytokines. This family includes more than 40 members, and has been divided
into four subfamilies: CXC, CC, C and CX3C. Chemokines belong to a rapidly expanding family of cytokines.
Their primary function is to control the positioning of
cells in tissues and to recruit leukocytes to the site of inflammation [6]. Some studies reported that levels of a
variety of chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) increased in animal models of ischemia and patients with stroke [7,8].
The chemokine-like factor 1 (CKLF1) is a novel human
cytokine of the cysteine-cysteine chemokine gene family,
firstly discovered through isolation from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated U937 cells and a novel functional ligand
for the C-C chemokine receptor 4 [9]. CKLF1 displays
chemotactic activities in a wide spectrum of leukocytes.
The expression of CKLF1 is up-regulated in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [10]. Recent studies
suggest that CKLF1 plays an important role in brain development such as migration of nerve cells [11,12].
In previous studies, we found that the expression of
CKLF1 increased in rats after focal cerebral ischemia
[13]. Treatment with C19, which is a C-terminal peptide
of CKLF1, as an antagonist of CKLF1, decreased the infarct volume and neurological score. This suggested that
CKLF1 played important roles in cerebral ischemia and
may be a potential target for treatment of cerebral ischemia [14]. However, a pathological mechanism of CKLF1
in ischemic brain damage is largely unknown. In this
present study, we found that neutralization of CKLF1
using anti-CKLF1 antibodies protected against focal
cerebral ischemia by inhibiting neutrophil infiltration to
the ischemic region via mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathways in rats.

(Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO)
antibody was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA,
USA). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Pierce Biotechnology
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). TNF-α
and IL-1β ELISA kits were purchased from NeoBioscience
Technology Company (Beijing, China), and MIP-2 and IL-8
ELISA kits were purchased from Westang Biotechnology
(Shanghai, China). MPO detection kit was purchased
from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing,
China). All other chemicals and reagents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise
specified.
Animals

Male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats (age, 7 weeks; weight, 260
to 280 g) were supplied by Experimental Animal Center of
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Beijing, China),
and housed on a 12-hour light/dark schedule in a
temperature (22 ± 2°C) and humidity (<40%) controlled
room with free access to food and water. All of the procedures were in accordance with the standards established
in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
published by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources
of the National Research Council (United States) and were
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Peking Union Medical College and the Chinese Academy
of Medical Sciences. The animals were randomly assigned
into different groups according to a computer-generated
randomization schedule (www.random.org). The assessment of measuring infarct volume and scoring neurobehavioral outcome is blinded.
Focal brain ischemia

Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (TMCAO)
model was performed as previously described with some
modifications [15]. Briefly, under 10% chloral hydrate
(4 ml/kg, intraperitoneal injection), a 4-0 nylon thread,
the tip of which was burned (diameter 0.36 mm), was
inserted into the right common carotid artery and advanced until the origin of the right middle cerebral artery was occluded. After 60 minutes of the occlusion,
the thread was removed to allow reperfusion and the animals were returned to their cages.
Drug administration

The efficacy of anti-CKLF1 antibody in cerebral ischemia
was detected by caudal vein administration and lateral
ventricle injection in a preliminary experiment. Lateral
ventricle injection was more effect than caudal vein administration (Additional file 1: Table S1). Therefore, we
chose lateral ventricle administration in subsequent experiments to investigate the role of anti-CKLF1 antibody
in cerebral ischemia. Five microliters of anti-rat CKLF1

neutralizing antibody in saline at dose of 0.1 μg, 0.5 μg
or 1 μg (n = 15 in every group) that were produced in
rabbits immunized with CKLF1 or normal rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig)G (1 μg, n = 15) was applied to the
right cerebral ventricle immediately after reperfusion,
with the needle left in place for 5 minutes thereafter.
Five microliters of saline was injected in the control
group (n = 15). The coordinates of the injection site were
as follows: 0.8 mm posterior to the bregma, 1.5 mm lateral
to the midline, and 3.5 mm depth from the dural surface,
according to the atlas. The neurological scale and infarct
volume were measured at 24 hours after cerebral ischemia. In all, 130 SD rats were used; 28 of the rats were removed due to death, 12 were removed for lack of
neurological impairment, and 40 rats were recruited.
To investigate the long-term efficacy of anti-CKLF1
treatment, rats were randomly divided into a shamoperated group, a vehicle group, an IgG group, 0.5 μg
and 1 μg anti-CKLF1 antibody-treated groups (n = 6 in
every group). Saline or antibody was administrated to
the animals by the intracerebroventricular route as soon
as the reperfusion procedure had been initiated. The
neurological scale and infarct volume were measured at
72 hours after cerebral ischemia. In all, 52 SD rats were
used; 16 of the rats were removed due to death, 6 were
removed for lack of neurological impairment, and 22
rats were recruited.
Neurological function

Neurological score was taken by Longa’s five-point scale
[15]. The animals without symptoms of neurological impairment or dying after the surgery were rejected and
other rats were recruited.

Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction

Total RNA from cerebral cortex was extracted with Trizol. The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1
(ICAM-1) mRNA or vascular cell adhesion molecule-1
(VCAM-1) mRNA was analyzed by using RT-PCR by
the following primers:
ICAM-1 sense: 5′-CAGGCCACCCACCTCACAGA-3′;
ICAM-1 antisense: 5′-GGGAGCTAAAGGCACGG
CAC-3′;
VCAM-1 sense: 5′-AGAGGGGGCCAAGTCCGTTC-3′;
VCAM-1 antisense: 5′-AGACCCTCGCTGGCACA
TGT-3′;
β-actin sense: 5′-CGGAGACGGGGTCACCCACA-3′;
β-actin antisense: 5′-AGAGAGCCTCGGGGCATCGG-3′.
The reaction condition was: 95°C for 5 minutes, then
28 cycles of 95°C for 30 seconds, 60.5°C for 30 seconds,
and 72°C for 40 seconds. PCR products were applied to
1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and photographed
under ultraviolet transilluminator. The photodensitometry was analyzed with Kodak digital science Analysis System (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY, USA).
Western blotting

The protein of cerebral cortex was prepared for Western
blot analysis. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on
15% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked by
3% BSA and then incubated with primary antibodies, the
followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and
detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) plus
detection system (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA).
The density of each band was quantified by using image
analysis software (Science Lab 2005 Image Gauge; Tokyo,
Japan).

Infarct analysis

After indicated time points, the animals were anesthetized, brains were removed and cut into 2-mm-thick
slices, with a total of six slices per animal. The slices
were immersed in a 1% solution of 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) in PBS at 37°C for 30 minutes
and fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered formalin. Images of
the slices were obtained with a scanner and computer.
The infarct area, area of contralateral corresponding
structure and area of ipsilateral corresponding structure
were calculated with Image J. The infarct volume was
corrected to account for edema and shrinkage due to
processing. The infarction area was corrected using following formula for both edema and shrinkage:
Corrected infarct area = measured infarct area + area of
contralateral corresponding structure − area of ipsilateral
corresponding structure [16].
The volume of infarction in each animal was obtained
from the product of average slice thickness (2 mm) and
sum of infarction area in all brain slices.

ELISA

Cortex was homogenized in PBS and then centrifuged
12,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C and the supernatant
was used for this study. The amount of TNF-α and IL1β were determined by rat TNF-α and IL-1β ELISA kits
and the amount of monocyte inflammatory protein
(MIP-2) and IL-8 were determined by rat MIP-2 and IL8 ELISA kits. The concentrations were shown as ng/g
wet tissue. The optical density was determined by a microplate reader set to 450 nm.
Immunohistochemistry staining

Immunohistochemistry staining of neutrophils was performed using paraffin-embedded brain samples of each
animal that were cut and sections were deparaffinized.
First, endogenous peroxidase was blocked by 3% hydrogen
peroxide. After preabsorption with normal serum, sections
were incubated with rabbit polyclone anti-MPO antibody
(1:100) overnight at 4°C. Then the sections were overlaid

activity of MPO was determined by MPO detection kit.
Statistic analysis

Results were expressed as mean ± SEM. Differences between data groups were compared by Student’s t-test for
analysis of unpaired data or one-way ANOVA. Statistical
significance was accepted at P < 0.05.

Results
Anti-CKLF1 antibody reduced mortality rate and
neurological score

Injection of anti-CKLF1 antibody significantly reduced
neurological score at 24 hours and 72 hours after cerebral ischemia in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1).
The neurological score of animals treated with antiCKLF1 antibody at dose of 0.5 μg and 1 μg was significant lower than that of vehicle group animals (P < 0.01);
Ischemia-reperfusion caused 31.8% and 41.5% mortality
in vehicle group at 24 hours and 72 hours (Additional
file 2: Table S2). Pretreatment with anti-CKLF1 antibody
at a dose of 1 μg decreased the mortality rate to 11.8%
and 25.0% at 24 hours and 72 hours after reperfusion.

Anti-CKLF1 antibody decreased infarct volume

As shown in Figure 2, the infarct tissue was stained pale
and the non-ischemic area red. Injection of anti-CKLF1
antibody could reduce infarct volume at 24 and 72 hours
after cerebral ischemia in a dose-dependent manner.
Anti-CKLF1 antibody at dose of 0.5 μg and 1 μg significantly reduced the infarct volume compared with vehicle
group. Injection of normal rabbit IgG (1 μg) failed to reduce the infarct volume. Thus, an ameliorating effect of
anti-CKLF1 antibody could be induced by specific blocking of CKLF1 activity.
Anti-CKLF1 antibody decreased the production of TNF-α,
IL-1β, MIP-2 and IL-8

To understand the role of inflammatory factors in cerebral
ischemia, the level of various cytokines and chemokines in
brain was measured. As shown in Figure 3, the level of
TNF-α, IL-1β, MIP-2 and IL-8 was sharply increased in vehicle group animals. Administration with anti-CKLF1 antibody lowered the amount of these inflammatory factors in
a dose-dependent manner. Anti-CKLF1 antibody at dose
of 0.5 μg and 1 μg could significantly decrease the level of
TNF-α, IL-1β, MIP-2 and IL-8 compared with vehicle
group (P < 0.01).

Anti-CKLF1 antibody inhibited the expression of ICAM-1
and VCAM-1

RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect ICAM-1
and VCAM-1 mRNA and protein expression in the ischemic region. Marked increase of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1
mRNA (Figure 4A, B) and protein expression (Figure 4C,
D) was observed in vehicle group. Treatment with antiCKLF1 antibody at dose of 0.5 μg and 1 μg could significantly decrease the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1
compared with the vehicle group (P < 0.01).

counted by Image J. A remarkable increase in neutrophils
was observed in the vehicle group, and pretreatment with
anti-CKLF1 antibody (1 μg) significantly reduced the
numbers of neutrophils from 176 ± 11.6 to 47 ± 2.5 (P <
0.001). In addition, MPO activity in the brain was also
measured to assess the extent of neutrophil infiltration in
the ischemic region in Figure 6. MPO activity was significantly higher 24 hours after ischemia in the vehicle group
than in the sham-operated group (P < 0.05). Treatment
with anti-CKLF1 antibody resulted in decrease of neutrophil infiltration in the ischemic region.

Anti-CKLF1 antibody reduced neutrophil infiltration

The neutrophil infiltration in ischemic and non-ischemic
hemisphere was investigated by immunohistochemistry

increased in the ischemic cortex 24 hours after MCAO
(Figure 5B); anti-CKLF1 antibody (0.5 and 1 μg) significantly inhibited neutrophil accumulation (Figure 5E, F). In
addition, the neutrophils were not observed in the contralateral hemisphere. The numbers of neutrophils were

Anti-CKLF1 antibody inhibited the activation of MAPK
signal pathways

MAPK signal transduction pathways including p38,
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun-Nterminal kinase (JNK) are the most important signaling
molecules that are thought to mediate the inflammatory
response [17-20]. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion,
the phosphorylation level of p38, ERK and JNK was

Discussion
Our study first demonstrates that treatment with antiCKLF1 antibody can decrease the infarct volume and
improve neurological function; this is associated with inhibition of neutrophil infiltration via MAPK signal
pathways.
Inflammation plays a key role in the pathophysiology
of ischemic stroke [21]. Some proinflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines, are produced in
human stroke and animal models of stroke and their inhibition or deficiency has been associated with reduced
injury [22-26]. Therefore, the cytokines, modulating tissue injury in stroke, are potential targets in future stroke
therapy [27].
As a novel member of the C-C chemokine family,
CKLF1 exhibits chemotactic activity for leukocytes
in vitro and in vivo. CKLF1 is up-regulated in lung tissues from asthma patients. Over-expression of CKLF1 in
mice causes dramatic pathological changes in lungs that
are similar to those observed in human asthma [28].
These findings imply that CKLF1 may play important
roles in the inflammatory response. C19 is a C-terminal
peptide of CKLF1, and contains 19 amino acids. C19 has
weaker chemotactic activity and inhibits chemotaxis induced by CKLF1 or thymus and activation-regulated
chemokine (CCL17) [29]. C19 can be used to treat
asthma as a CKLF1 antagonist [30]. Previously, we have
shown that treatment with C19 decreased the infarct
size and water content [14]. However, the mechanism of
CKLF1 in cerebral ischemia is unknown. In this study,
we applied anti-CKLF1 antibody to assess the effects of

CKLF1 on tissue injury and infiltration of inflammatory
cells after cerebral ischemia in rats. In previous studies,
it has been shown that neutrophils firstly infiltrated to
ischemic region in various types of leukocytes and
peaked at 48 to 72 hours after cerebral ischemia [21,31].
So, we investigated the protection effect of anti-CKLF1
antibody against cerebral ischemia at 24 and 72 hours
after reperfusion. The data showed that treatment with
anti-CKLF1 antibody decreased the infarct volume and
improved neurological function at these times after reperfusion. This indicated that the protection by antiCKLF1 antibody may be associated with inhibition of
neutrophil infiltration. To validate this hypothesis, the
inflammatory factors and adhesion molecules related to
neutrophil infiltration were investigated.
The inflammatory factors and adhesion molecules are
an important driving force in the process of neutrophil
infiltration. TNF-α and IL-1β are pleiotropic cytokines
released by many cell types on diverse stimulation. They
exert multiple biological activities including stimulation
of acute phase protein secretion and vascular permeability, and induce expression of surface adhesion molecules
and other inflammatory mediators [32,33]. These actions
of TNF-α and IL-1β providea central role in leukocyte
infiltration and tissue injury after cerebral ischemia [34].
IL-8 and MIP-2 are CXC chemokines which are known
as neutrophil chemotactic factor. Some studies have reported that neutralization of TNF-α, IL-1β, MIP-2 and
IL-8 reduced neutrophils recruitment [33]. In addition,
adhesion molecules on brain capillary endothelium play
an important role in leukocyte migration into ischemic
brain tissue. Increase of adhesion molecules expression
(such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin and so on) has
been described after stroke [32]. TNF-α and IL-1β
induce adhesion molecule expression by cerebral endothelial and glial cells, thereby promoting neutrophil accumulation and migration in the microvasculature [35].

Inhibition of neutrophil infiltration into the ischemic
brain via anti-adhesion molecules has been shown to reduce infarct size, cerebral edema, and neurological deficits in transient MCAO stroke models in rats and mice
[36-39]. In the present study, we found that injection of
anti-CKLF1 antibody decreased the production of inflammatory factors and the expression of VCAM-1 and
ICAM-1, which may be associated with inhibition of
neutrophil infiltration. Therefore, we also quantified the
number of neutrophils in the ischemic region.
Cytokines and chemokines play crucial roles in the
transendothelial migration of leukocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and lymphocytes [40].
Infiltrating neutrophils amplify the cerebral inflammatory response that may exacerbate ischemic brain injury
further. Most experimental and clinical studies support
the importance of neutrophil infiltration in ischemic
stroke [31,41]. Neutrophils adhering to the endothelium
can damage the endothelium and increase the permeability of the blood–brain barrier. This leads to vascular
plugging, edema and cerebral infarction [42]. Therefore,
inhibition of neutrophil infiltration has a protective role
in stroke. In the present study, administration with antiCKLF1 antibody decreased the numbers of MPOpositive neutrophils and the activity of MPO, which is a
marker enzyme for measuring neutrophils accumulation
in the ischemic region. In addition to neutrophils, other
leukocyte subsets are also involved in stroke-related inflammation. CCR4, as a functional receptor for CKLF1,
is prevalently expressed on T cells and plays an essential
role in the recruitment of T cells into the ischemic region in the later stages of ischemic brain injury [31].
Therefore, the role of T cells in cerebral ischemia has
not been neglected. The other leukocyte subsets, including T cells, will be the next targets for the following
studies to further show the effects and potential application of CKLF1.

The relationship between the MAPK pathway activation and ischemic injury have been studied and it has
been demonstrated that MAPK, including phospho-p38,
ERKand JNK expression, were greatly increased after
permanent or temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion [43,44]. MAPK pathways may play a role in the
regulation of proinflammatory cytokines during cerebral
ischemia [45,46]. Some studies indicated that inhibition
of the MAPK pathway reduced IL-1β expression and
protected against focal cerebral ischemia [47-49]. In this
study, treatment with anti-CKLF1 antibody inhibited the
phosphorylation level of p38, ERK and JNK in the ischemic region. In addition, following the administration of a
high dose of anti-CKLF1 antibody in healthy rats, MAPK
signal pathways were not suppressed (data not shown).
This may be associated with the expression level of
CKLF1 in the normal adult rats. Our previous study
showed that the expression of CKLF1 in the brain decreased from the embryonic stage to adulthood: the level
of CKLF1 was very low in adult rats [12]. Therefore,
anti-CKLF1 antibody could affect the MAPK signal
pathways to inhibit neutrophil infiltration in cerebral
ischemia.
Because production of inflammatory mediators and
expression of adhesion molecules are both essential to
neutrophil infiltration, the effect of anti-CKLF1 antibody
on the production of TNF-α, IL-1β, MIP-2, IL-8, and expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 may, at least in part,
explain the effect on neutrophil infiltration. Therefore, the
present study has indicated that anti-CKLF1 antibody attenuated the ischemic injury by inhibiting neutrophil influx into the ischemic region via MAPK pathways.

Conclusions
This study shows that selective inhibition of CKLF1 activity significantly protects against ischemia/reperfusion
injury by decreasing production of inflammatory mediators and expression of adhesion molecules, thereby reducing neutrophils recruitment to the ischemic area,
possibly via inhibiting MAPK pathways. Therefore, CKLF1
may be a novel target for the treatment of stroke.
