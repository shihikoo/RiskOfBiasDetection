PTEN is a dual speciﬁcity phosphatase and is implicated in inﬂammation and apoptosis of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury. Bisperoxovanadium (Bpv), a speciﬁc inhibitor of PTEN’s
phosphatase activity, has demonstrated powerful neuroprotective properties. We investigated the neuroprotective roles of Bpv in the rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) cerebral I/R injury, and
explored the modulation of inﬂammatory mediators and PI3K/Akt/GSK-3␤ pathways by Bpv. Our results
showed that treatment with Bpv (0.2 mg/kg/day) signiﬁcantly decreased neurological deﬁcit scores at 7
days after MCAO and infarct volume at 4 days after MCAO. The IL-10 concentration was increased and
TNF-␣ concentration was decreased in the ischemic boundary zone of the cerebral cortex at 4 days after
MCAO by Bpv. Furthermore, Bpv (0.2 mg/kg/day) treatment signiﬁcantly reduced PTEN mRNA and protein levels and increased PI3K, Akt and p-GSK-3␤ proteins expression in the ischemic boundary zone of
the cerebral cortex at 4 days after MCAO. In conclusions, Bpv treatment demonstrates neuroprotective
effects on cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury of ischemic stroke rats and is associated with its modulation of inﬂammatory mediator production and up-regulation of PTEN downstream proteins PI3K, Akt
and p-GSK-3␤.

1. Background
Ischemic stroke is a common cerebrovascular disease and a
major cause of death and disabilities worldwide, and accounts for
about 87% of all stroke cases [1]. Ischemic stroke leads to cerebral
tissue infarction and malfunction, making patients with declined
cognitive sensory motor function [2], which is primarily caused by
adverse effects on neurons [3]. Rapid reperfusion is an important
treatment strategy for ischemic stroke patients. However, it usually

leads to exacerbated cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury
[4]. The mechanisms underlying I/R injury involve various pathophysiological processes, among which inﬂammation and apoptosis
have been conﬁrmed by accumulating evidence [5,6].
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome
10) is a dual speciﬁcity phosphatase and acts as a crucial mediator for neuronal death in neural cells exposed to oxygen–glucose
deprivation (OGD) [7]. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt
and Glycogen synthase kinase 3␤ (GSK-3␤) are three downstream
signal proteins for PTEN. Activation of PI3K-Akt pathway could
inhibit neuronal apoptosis and ischemic brain injury [8], and these
effects were associated with suppressed inﬂammation [9]. GSK3 is a serine/threonine kinase consisting of two isoforms, GSK-3␣
and GSK-3␤. GSK-3␤ activation plays key roles in neuronal death
in ischemic stroke, and GSK-3␤ inhibition is a reliable strategy

for neuroprotection in ischemic stroke [10]. PTEN deletion could
prevent neuronal cell death induced by ischemic brain injury
and promote neuroprotective effects [11]. However, it remains
unknown about the effects of PTEN inhibitors on inﬂammatory
cytokine production in ischemic stroke.
In this study, we hypothesized that PTEN pathway is a therapeutic target of Bisperoxovanadium (Bpv), a speciﬁc inhibitor of PTEN,
in ischemic stroke animals. Therefore, we investigated the effects of
Bpv on the inﬂammatory mediator production and the expression
of PI3K, Akt and GSK-3␤ in ischemic stroke rats.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R)
model
Adult male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats weighing 280–320 g were
obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center of our hospital and
were kept in standard housing conditions. All experiments were
conducted in full compliance with the National Institutes of Health
USA Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and were
approved by the Ethical Review Panels of our hospital.
The MCAO model was established in SD rats as described previously, with minor modiﬁcations [12]. Brieﬂy, after fasting for 12 h,
anesthesia was performed by intraperitoneally injected sodium
pentobarbital (45 mg/kg). The physiological parameters of rats
were measured and controlled within physiological limits. The rats
underwent a ventral midline neck incision to expose the right common carotid artery, internal carotid artery, and external carotid
artery. After isolation of the internal carotid artery, the common
carotid artery was ligated proximal to the carotid bifurcation. A
lysine-coated nylon monoﬁlament (Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co. Ltd.,
Beijing, China) with a heat-blunted tip (diameter 0.32 ± 0.02 mm)
was inserted into the right internal carotid artery from the common
carotid artery through the external carotid artery. The ﬁlament was
gently advanced 18 to 20 mm to reach the origin of the middle cerebral artery. To conﬁrm proper occlusion, a laser Doppler ﬂowmetry
(PeriFlux System 5000, Perimed Inc, Stockholm, Sweden) was ﬁxed
on the skull (1 mm posterior to the bregma and 6 mm from the midline on the right side) to monitor the regional cortical blood ﬂow.
An occlusion was conﬁrmed by a sharp drop (>70%) in the cerebral
blood ﬂow. After 1 h of MCAO, the ﬁlament was removed to restore
blood ﬂow (reperfusion). After incision closure the rats were placed
into cages with free access to food and water. Sham-operated rats
received identical surgery with the exception of ﬁlament insertion.
At 24 h after reperfusion, neurological deﬁcit of SD rats was
evaluated. Rats were randomly divided into four groups: (1)sham
group; (2) MCAO model group; (3) Ns group, which received normal
saline solution; (4) Bpv group, which received intraperitoneal injection of the Bpv (0.2 mg/kg/day) (EMD Chemicals, Inc, Gibbstown, NJ,
United States) for 7 days, starting immediately after reperfusion.

2.2. Evaluation of neurological deﬁcit
Modiﬁed neurological severity scores (mNSS) were examined
to evaluate neurological deﬁcit in all four groups (All n = 6) at 1
day and 7 days after MCAO in a blinded manner. mNSS is a comprehensive test for evaluating motor, sensory, reﬂex and balance
abilities, grading neurological deﬁcits on a scale of 0 ∼ 18, and the
detailed information of mNSS set was described in our previous
reports [13]. When rats were unable to perform the tests or lacked
tested reﬂexes, score points were awarded. Therefore, higher score
indicates more severe injury. Rats with mNSS score <6 or >13 at 1
day were excluded from further experiment.

2.3. Quantiﬁcation of infarct volume
At 4 days after MCAO, rats were decapitated and their brains
were rapidly removed and frozen, and cut into 2-mm-thick
coronal sections. Infarct volume was measured according to
our previously procedures [13]. Slices were stained with 1.2%
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma, St Louis, MO,
USA) for 30 min at 37 ◦ C. After overnight immersion with 4%
(w/v) paraformaldehyde, slices were photographed. The unstained
(white) areas indicated infracted tissue and the stained (red) areas
indicated normal tissue. The infracted tissue areas were analyzed by
digital image analysis software (SigmaScan Pro, Jandel, San Rafael,
CA).
2.4. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
At 4 days after MCAO, total RNA was extracted from the
ischemic boundary zone (IBZ) tissues of decapitated rats using
Trizol® reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). After treatment with DNase
(Life Technologies), total RNA (2 ␮g) was reverse-transcribed into
cDNA using the Superscript III enzyme (Life Technologies). The
resulting cDNA was used as a template for qRT-PCR assay using
speciﬁc PTEN primer and SYBR Green reagent (TaKaRa, Japan)
in the StepOne Plus Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems,
USA). The PCR condition was programmed as follows: initial
denaturation at 95 ◦ C for 3 min, followed by 40 ampliﬁcation
cycles of 95 ◦ C for 5 sec and annealing at 60 ◦ C for 30 sec. Housekeeping gene ␤-actin served as an internal control and PTEN
mRNA expression was calculated by 2-DCt method. The primer
sequences used in our study were as followes: PTEN: forward:
5 -CCATAACCCACCACAGC-3 ; reverse: 5 -ACCAGTCCGTCCTTTCC3 ; ␤-actin: forward: 5 -CGTTGACATCCGTAAAGAC-3 ; reverse: 5 TAGGAGCCAGGGCAGTA -3 . All reactions were performed in triplicate. The relative PTEN expressions of four groups were all
normalized to sham group.
2.5. Measurements of IL-10 and TNF-˛ concentrations
The cerebral cortex tissues were acquired from the ischemic
boundary zone at 4 days after MCAO, and were harvested and
homogenized by sonication, followed by quick frozen at −20 ◦ C.
The IL-10 and TNF-␣ concentrations were measured using a protein
suspension chip (Milliplex Map, RECYTMAG-65K, Merck-Millipore,
Daytona Beach, FL, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
2.6. Western blot analysis
To examine the inhibitory effects of Bpv on PTEN pathways
following MCAO, the protein expressions of PTEN, PI3K, Akt and
p-GSK-3␤ were analyzed. The cortical and striatal tissues from
IBZs were harvested at 4 days after MCAO (n = 5 for each group).
RIPA lysis buffer was used to homogenize tissue and whole protein
was extracted. Denatured protein extracts (50 ␮g) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide (SDS-PAGE) gels and then
transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk and probed with
primary antibodies PTEN, PI3K (1:1000), Akt (1:1000) and p-GSK3␤ (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at
4 ◦ C overnight. The membranes were washed three times with
Tris-buffer saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) buffer, and
were probed with secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG) coupled to
horseradish peroxidase (HPR) (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. Protein bands
were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA). ␤-actin served as a loading control. The pro-

tein bands were quantiﬁed using Image J software, and the relative
protein expressions were expressed as the ratios of PI3K, Akt and
p-GSK-3␤ normalized to ␤-actin.
2.7. Statistical analysis
Quantitative data were presented as mean ± standard deviation
(SD). The statistical analysis was performed using commercially
available software (SPSS version 19.0). Student t test (unpaired, two
tailed) was applied to analyze the statistical signiﬁcance difference
between two groups. A probability value of <0.05 (P < 0.05) was
considered as statistically signiﬁcant difference.
3. Results
3.1. Bpv treatment improved functional recovery
Compared with sham group, rats subjected to MCAO showed
signiﬁcant neurological deﬁcit after 1 day reperfusion. Rats with
mNSS score between 6 and 13 were chosen for Bpv or normal
saline treatment. Administration of Bpv (0.2 mg/kg/day) 7 days
after MCAO resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in mNSS scores in
comparison with the Ns group (P < 0.05, Fig. 1A).
3.2. Bpv treatment reduced infarct volume
At 4 days after MCAO, a series of sections of the ipsilateral hemisphere showed extensive infarction by TTC staining in the cerebral

cortical and subcortical areas (Fig. 1B). In MCAO model group and Ns
group, the infarct volume account for more than half of the whole
hemisphere. There were no statistical differences in the infarct volume between the MCAO model group and Ns group (P > 0.05). Rats
with treatment of Bpv (0.2 mg/kg/day) had signiﬁcantly smaller
infarct volumes than those in the Ns group (P < 0.05, Fig. 1C).
3.3. Effects of Bpv on the levels of IL-10 and TNF-˛ in IBZ after
MCAO
ELISA assay showed that the MCAO model group and Ns group
had signiﬁcantly lower expressions of anti-inﬂammatory mediator
IL-10 and higher expressions of pro-inﬂammatory mediator TNF-␣
than did the sham group (P < 0.05, Fig. 2A and B). In comparison with
the Ns group, Bpv treatment (0.2 mg/kg/day) signiﬁcantly increased
IL-10 concentration and decreased TNF-␣ concentration in the IBZ
(P < 0.05, Fig. 2A and B). There were no signiﬁcant differences in
concentrations of IL-10 or TNF-␣ between the MCAO model group
and Ns group (P > 0.05).
3.4. Bpv inhibited PTEN and activated PI3K/Akt/GSK-3ˇ in the
ischemic brain
qRT-PCR and western blot showed that Bpv treatment signiﬁcantly decreased PTEN mRNA and protein levels in the striatal IBZ
at 4 days after MCAO compared to saline injection group (P < 0.05,
Fig. 3A and B). Western blot showed that bpv signiﬁcantly increased
protein expressions of PI3K, Akt and p-GSK-3␤ in the striatal IBZ at

4 days after MCAO compared to saline injection (Fig. 4A–C). Collectively, these results indicated that intraperitoneally injected Bpv
can cross the blood–brain barrier to induce PTEN inhibition and
elevation of PTEN downstream proteins in the ischemic brain tissues.
4. Discussion

Fig. 3. Bpv decreases the expression of PTEN in IBZ of the cerebral cortex over 4
days after MCAO. Treatment with Bpv (0.2 mg/kg/day) decreased PTEN mRNA level
by qRT-PCR (A) and protein levels by western blot (B) (All n = 5 per group). Representative images of PTEN protein bands are shown. Data were expressed as mean
values ± standard deviation (SD). *P < 0.05, versus sham group; #P < 0.05 versus Ns
group.

This study we found that PTEN inhibitor Bpv improved the
functional recovery following MCAO, as proved by decreased neurological deﬁcit score mNSS and infarct volume. Furthermore, Bpv
increased anti-inﬂammatory mediator IL-10 and decreased proinﬂammatory mediator TNF-␣ levels in IBZ of the cerebral cortex,
which was likely associated with restorative effects of Bpv. Finally,
Bpv activated cerebral PI3K, Akt and increased p-GSK-3␤ expression in ischemic stroke rats.
In most clinical ischemic stroke, focal ischemia occurs in the
middle cerebral artery, therefore the experimental MCAO model is
widely used in the study of ischemic stroke [14]. Focal cerebral
ischemia triggers a variety of neuronal cell signaling pathways,
which may cause cell survival or death [15]. However, it is still
unclear about the detailed mechanisms underlying neuronal fate
in ischemic stroke. There is growing evidence to show that PI3KAkt-GSK-3␤ signaling pathways play vital roles after focal cerebral
I/R injury [8,10].
Bpv is a well-established inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases and can effectively inhibit PTEN expression at low
concentrations [16]. Bpv exerts potent neuroprotective properties
in ischemic stroke model, and prevented ischemic brain injury,
reduced infarct volume, suppressed neuronal apoptosis, with activation of PI3K, Akt and mTOR [11,13,17]. In rat cortical neurons
with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), Bpv decreased the activity in PTEN and GSK-3␤ [18]. In temporal lobe epilepsy, Bpv has
shown neuroprotective effects through anti-inﬂammatory function

[19]. However, currently there is no report about the modulations
of inﬂammation response by PTEN or Bpv in ischemia stroke.
In this study, our results demonstrated signiﬁcant neuroprotective effects by Bpv against cerebral injury. Intraperitoneal injection
of Bpv at 0.2 mg/kg/day has been proved to effectively inhibit
cerebral PTEN and demonstrate neuroprotection in experimental
ischemic stroke [11,13].
Inﬂammation causes long-term damage in the infracted tissue
and the ischemic penumbra of ischemic stroke [20], as demonstrated by increased production of inﬂammatory markers, such
as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-␣, in the process of neuronal damage [21].
Therefore, inhibition of inﬂammation is one potential therapeutic
strategy in ischemic stroke [22]. We showed that Bpv signiﬁcantly
reduced the TNF-␣ level and increased the IL-10 level in the IBZ
of ischemic stroke rats. TNF-␣ is a pro-inﬂammatory cytokine and
its levels in brain tissue and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) were elevated in ischemic stroke patients [23]. IL-10 is an anti-inﬂammatory
cytokine and plays neuroprotective roles in ischemic stroke. IL-10
serum level was signiﬁcantly correlated with neurological worsening of ischemic stroke patients [24]. Furthermore, intracerebral
IL-10 injection showed neuroprotective effects in stroke model, and
proved to be one promising therapeutic target in ischemic stroke
[25].
PI3K-Akt-GSK-3␤ signaling pathways participates the process
of ischemic injury. Our results demonstrated treatment with Bpv

Fig. 4. Effects of Bpv on the protein expression of PI3K, Akt and p-GSK-3␤ in IBZ 4 days after MCAO. Western blot shows that Bpv (0.2 mg/kg/day) decreased protein expressions
of PI3K (A), Akt (B) and p-GSK-3␤ (C) (All n = 5 per group). Representative images and quantitative data are shown. Data were expressed as mean values ± standard deviation
(SD). *P < 0.05, versus sham group; #P < 0.05 versus Ns group.

(0.2 mg/kg/day) inhibited PI3K, Akt and p-GSK-3␤ proteins at 4
days after MCAO. It has been reported that the activated PI3K and
Akt can act as inhibitory mediators of inﬂammation in cerebral
ischemic injury [9]. IL-10 shows neuroprotective roles in ischemic
stroke and this study we provide the ﬁrst evidence that PTEN
inhibition elevate IL-10 level in brain tissue of ischemic stroke
animals. Indeed, in tissues in addition to brain, PTEN inhibition
increased levels of IL-10 in post-myocardial infarction remodeling [26] and liver ischemia reperfusion injury [27]. Therefore, we
speculate that in our study Bpv increased IL-10 may also mediate
the inhibition of neuroinﬂammation and provide subsequent neuroprotective functions. It seems that PI3K and Akt are upstream
regulators of IL-10. However, in cultured cortical neurons exposed
to oxygen-glucose deprivation, IL-10 can activate PI3K-AKT pathways and provides neuroprotection [28]. This indicates Bpv might
produce positive feed-back regulation between PI3K-AKT activation and IL-10 expression in our ischemic stroke model.
Our study also showed increased expression of phosphorylatedGSK-3␤ (p-GSK-3␤) by Bpv in MCAO rats. GSK-3␤ activity is
inhibited by phosphorylation [29]. In ischemic stroke, GSK-3␤ inhibition could provide neuroprotection and restore neurobehavioral
functions [10]. This indicates that in our study GSK-3␤ inhibition
by phosphorylation might be responsible for the increased IL-10
levels and decreased TNF-␣ levels by Bpv.

5. Conclusion
This study demonstrated that the neuroprotective effects of Bpv
on cerebral I/R injury were associated with increased IL-10 production, decreased TNF-␣ production, PI3K and Akt activation and
GSK-3␤ inhibition. Further investigations are needed to explore
the roles of PI3K-Akt-GSK-3␤ pathways in the inﬂammation of
ischemic stroke by Bpv. Our ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst experimental evidence on the regulation of inﬂammation by Bpv in ischemic
stroke. Bpv has been identiﬁed to demonstrate neuroprotective and
anti-inﬂammatory effects, therefore our results may provide Bpv as
a new therapeutic target in neurodegenerative disorders with neuroinﬂammation, such as ischemic stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and
Parkinson’s diseases.
