The effects of activated protein C (APC) on the quantitative parameters of neurons and neuroglia in the perifocal zone of infarction induced in the left hemispheric cortex were studied in
two groups of rats. Group 1 animals served as control (control infarction). Group 2 rats were
injected with APC (50 μg/kg) in the right lateral cerebral ventricle 3 h after infarction was
induced, and after 72 h the infarction size was evaluated and the neurons and neuroglia in the
perifocal zone were counted. APC reduced the infarction size 2.5 times in comparison with
the control and reduced by 16% the neuronal death in the perifocal zone layer V, causing no
appreciable changes in layer III, and did not change the size of neuronal bodies but increased
(by 11%) the size of neuronal nuclei in layer III. The protein maintained the sharply increased
count of gliocytes in the perifocal zone of infarction and promoted their growth. Hence, APC
protected the neurons from death in the ischemic focus by increasing the gliocyte count and
stimulating the compensatory reparative processes.

Acute vascular diseases of the brain, specifically brain
stroke, is one of the priority medicosocial problems
[3,5], and therefore, search for approaches to and
methods for brain tissue protection from ischemia is
a pressing problem. One of the possible approaches
is the use of activated protein C (APC), hemostasis
proteinase with anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and
neuroprotective activities [6,7,11,15].

Studies of the perifocal zone of cerebral infarction,
containing involved and viable neurons, are essential for
disclosing the pathogenetic regularities underlying the
emergence and development of ischemic stroke [1,9].
Importantly that the basal mechanisms of the structuralfunctional and neurochemical interactions between the
neurons and neuroglia, the cells forming an important
structural and functional component of the nervous tissue in the perifocal zone, are little studied.
We studied the neuroprotective effect of APC on
the counts of neurons and neuroglia in the perifocal
zone of stroke simulated in the brain of rats by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was carried out on outbred male rats (250300 g) divided into 3 groups. Group 1 were intact
controls (n=3). Group 2 (n=4) were rats with control
infarction, reproduced by occlusion of the left branch
of the middle cerebral artery (OMCA) [2]; these animals served as controls for comparative evaluation
of the efficiency of APC neuroprotection. Group 3
(n=4) rats were injected with APC (50 μg/kg) into
the right lateral cerebral ventricle 3 h after OMCA.
The rats with control infarction received injections of
saline into the right cerebral ventricle. The location
and size of ischemic focus were evaluated by magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) 72 h after OMCA
(the study was carried out on a BioSpec 70/30 USR
nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (Bruker) at
magnetic field tension of 7 T). The size of the focus
was evaluated planimetrically in frontal MRT images
using ImageJ software and calculated as the involved
tissue area in percent of the total left hemispheric cortex area. The infarction area was also evaluated in
histological sections of the brain under a microscope at
×32. After MRT examinations the animals were decapitated under light ether narcosis, the brain was fixed in
4% formalin, embedded in paraffin, 7-μ sections were
sliced and stained by cresyl violet after Nissl. The density of the neurons and neuroglia was evaluated in the
sensorimotor cortical layers III and V in the perifocal
zone of the infarction (penumbra). The total counts of
neurons with intact histological structure in the sensorimotor cortical layers III and V in the penumbra was
evaluated under a Leica DMLB microscope at ×400
(Leica QWin videoimage processing software). The

531
total count of the neurogliocytes, including astrocytes
and oligodendrocytes, was evaluated and the areas of
the profile fields of neuronal bodies and nuclei were
estimated. Four visual fields were examined in each of
the 10 brain sections from each animal.
The results were statistically processed by Mann–
Whitney nonparametric U test for independent samples
with multiple comparison correction. The differences
were considered significant at p<0.05.

RESULTS
Modeling of focal ischemic stroke by OMCA led to
the formation of a focus of 21.40±6.31% of the total left-hemispheric cortical area according to MRT
(Fig. 1, a). Injections of APC resulted in a significant shrinkage of the involved tissue in MRT images
(2.5 times; Fig. 2) and in histological preparations
(2.3 times; Fig. 3).
Morphometry of the penumbral zone structures
adjacent to the infarction showed a significantly lower
density of neurons: by 13% in layer III, by 21% in
layer V (Table 1). Injection of APC resulted in a significant increase in the neuron density in the penumbra
in comparison with the control: by 16% in layer V and
a trend to an increase – by 10% – in layer III. Gliocyte density in the control infarction penumbral zone
increased sharply in comparison with intact animals:
by 41% in layer III and by 94% in layer V. Injection of
APC led to an increase of gliocyte density by 63% in
layer III in comparison with the control and virtually
did not change in layer V. As a result, the density of
glia cells increased almost 2-fold in comparison with
intact control and the differences between layers III

and V were leveled under the effect of APC (Table
1). In contrast to gliocytes, the proportion of neuron
distribution densities in different layers changed negligibly. The neurons in the control infarction penumbra were significantly smaller than in intact animals:
neuron bodies in layers III and V – by 14 and 33%,

respectively, their nuclei – by 20 and 36% (Table 2).
APC caused no changes in the size of neuronal bodies, but increased significantly (by 11%) the size of
neuronal nuclei in layer III.
Injection of APC to animals with ischemic infarction model created by OMCA promoted the survival of

the cerebrocortical structure in acute cerebral ischemia.
Vital MRT studies of animal brain and brain sections
by computer morphometry showed shrinkage of the
infarction focus 2.5 and 2.3 times, respectively. These
results were comparable with the results obtained on a
similar model in studies of the neuroprotective effect
of ischemic and hypoxic preconditioning [2].
APC reduced significantly the infarction focus
in the brain of animals and promoted survival of
neurons in the penumbra, the counts of viable neurons being 16% higher in layer V and 10% higher in
layer III. Neuronal death in the control was 13-21%.
One more characteristic of the ischemic stroke model
manifested by a sharp increase of the gliocyte count
round the ischemic focus. Their count in the penumbra was almost 1.5 times higher in layer III and
virtually 2-fold higher in layer V than in intact brain.
APC maintained a high level of the neuroglia in the
penumbral layer V and promoted its growth in layer
III. As a result, the neuroglia density in these layers

was leveled under the effect of APC (Table 1). The
neuroglia maintained nervous tissue homeostasis and
normal functioning of the neurons and was involved
in the nervous stimulation conduction [13,14], and
hence, its stimulation in the ischemic focus penumbral zone could be regarded as a compensatory reparative response of brain structures to maintenance
of the neuron function in ischemia, which was confirmed by published data [10,13].
APC virtually did not change the areas of neuronal
bodies in the penumbra, but increased significantly (by
11%) the size of neuronal nuclei in layer III. As the
nucleus was the core of cell metabolism, the structural
and functional rearrangement of the nuclear system of
associative neurons in layer III presumably indicated
activation of the compensatory reparative processes in
the neurons of the perifocal infarction zone under the
effect of APC.
The destructive effects on brain tissue of such
factors as ROS and inflammatory processes are lower

during the postischemic period; the capillary permeability and vasomotor dysfunction reduce and the reparative processes are more intense [4,8,12]. Presumably, these processes in the infarction perifocal zone
are stimulated by APC, characterized by anticoagulant,
anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective effects [6,11].
The neuroprotective effect of recombinant APC without
anticoagulant activity has been demonstrated [7]. In the
focal ischemia model APC reduces the expression of
adhesive molecules, stabilizes the blood-brain barrier,
and blocks the neutrophil transport from the blood to
the brain, reducing the postischemic injury [15].
Hence, APC neuroprotection of the brain structures in acute cerebral ischemia sharply results in
shrinkage of the infarction focus and induces significant structural and functional changes in the perifocal
zone, manifesting by a significantly higher counts of
neurons and an increase in the counts of gliocytes,
promoting neuron survival.
