Abstract
The activation of inflammatory cascades in the ischemic hemisphere impairs mechanisms of tissue reorganization with consequences for recovery of lost neurological function. Recruitment of T-cell populations to the post-ischemic brain occurs and represents a significant part of the inflammatory response. This study was conducted to investigate if treatment with levodopa,
potentially acting as an immunomodulator, affects the T-cell accumulation in the post-ischemic brain. Male Sprague–Dawley rats
were subjected to transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (tMCAO) for 105 min followed by levodopa/benserazide treatment (20 mg/kg/15 mg/kg) for 5 days initiated on day 2 post-stroke. One week after tMCAO, T-cell populations were analysed
from brains, and levels of interleukin (IL)-1b, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1, IL-4, IL-5, interferon gamma and IL-13 were analysed. After levodopa/benserazide treatment, we found a significant reduction of cytotoxic T-cells (CD3+CD8+) in the ischemic
hemisphere together with reduced levels of T-cell-associated cytokine IL-5, while other T-cell populations (CD3+, CD3+CD4+,
CD3+CD4+CD25+) were unchanged compared with vehicle-treated rats. Moreover, a reduced number of cells was associated with
reduced levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, expressed in endothelial cells, in the infarct core of levodopa/benserazidetreated animals. Together, we provide the first evidence that dopamine can act as a potential immunomodulator by attenuating
inflammation in the post-ischemic brain.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke induces an inﬂammatory response in the brain,
predominantly in the infarct core, the surrounding penumbra and
peri-infarct area, and sustains for weeks after the insult (Kriz &
Lalancette-Hebert, 2009). Post-stroke inﬂammation involves overlapping processes, including the early activation of microglial cells,
induction and release of chemoattractants, pro-inﬂammatory molecules (Iadecola & Anrather, 2011), such as danger-associated molecular patterns (Shichita et al., 2012), pro-inﬂammatory chemokines
and cytokines (Kriz, 2006). Partially due to a compromised blood–
brain barrier together with induction of pro-inﬂammatory mediators,
peripheral immune cells inﬁltrate into the ischemic hemisphere
(Gelderblom et al., 2009; del Zoppo, 2009) in an orderly sequence.
Those cells play a role in a variety of processes, and contribute to
acute and delayed neurodegeneration (Yilmaz et al., 2006; Shichita
et al., 2009), but also beneﬁcial effects on neuronal plasticity processes and tissue reorganization in the ischemic territory (Wolf
et al., 2009; Ren et al., 2011b) are described. In particular, interleukin (IL)-10 secreting regulatory B-cells have been identiﬁed to limit
the inﬂammatory response after transient occlusion of the middle
cerebral artery (tMCAO; Ren et al., 2011a,b). Inhibition of the leucocyte very late antigen-4 (VLA-4)- and vascular cell adhesion

molecule-1 (VCAM-1)-mediated pathway unspeciﬁcally blocked the
invasion of leucocytes including CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells,
and resulted in a reduction of infarct volume and improvement of
lost neurological function after experimental stroke (Liesz et al.,
2009, 2011). Hence, contrary results in regard to infarct volume and
functional outcome have been obtained (Liesz et al., 2009; Ren
et al., 2011a; Kleinschnitz et al., 2013) regarding the role of regulatory T-cells after experimental stroke.
We recently found that treatment with the speciﬁc CXCR4/
CXCR7 antagonist AMD3100 inhibits inﬁltration of CD3+ and
CD3+CD4+ T-cells into the ischemic hemisphere, and provides signiﬁcant improvement of lost neurological function after tMCAO
(Ruscher et al., 2013), suggesting that invasion of CD3+ and
CD3+CD4+ T-cells is negatively correlated with the functional outcome.
Conditions associated with altered dopamine levels in the brain,
such as schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease, show reduced levels
of CD4+ T-cells in blood (Steiner et al., 2010), accompanied with
increased dopamine receptor 3 (D3) mRNA expression (Ilani et al.,
2001) and a decreased D3 mRNA expression in patients with
Parkinson’s disease (Nagai et al., 1996), respectively. Moreover,
reduced interferon gamma (IFN-c) levels upon D1 and D2 receptor
activation have been demonstrated in puriﬁed T-cells (Huang et al.,
2010). These ﬁndings suggest the involvement of dopamine in
T-cell responses and homeostasis (Basu & Dasgupta, 2000; Sarkar
et al., 2010).

Recently, we have shown that treatment with levodopa improves
functional recovery in rats (Ruscher et al., 2012), without affecting
the infarct size. Moreover, we also demonstrated that levodopa treatment reverses peripheral CD3+/CD4+ T-helper cell depletion in rats
subjected to tMCAO (Kuric & Ruscher, 2014). Because T-cells are
recognized as one of the immune cell populations invading the brain
parenchyma following stroke, we hypothesize that those cells are
potentially regulated by levodopa/benserazide treatment after
tMCAO. The time point for treatment initiation was selected not to
interfere with acute cell survival and cell death mechanisms.

Materials and methods
tMCAO in rat
All animal experiments were approved by Malm€o-Lund ethical
committee, and were carried out in accordance with the European
Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86/609/
EEC) and the Guidelines laid down by the NIH in the USA regarding the care and use of animals for experimental procedures.
tMCAO was induced as described previously (Ruscher et al., 2009).
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (age 12–16 weeks, 325–350 g; Harlan
Scandinavia, Denmark) were housed under diurnal light conditions,
and were fasted for 12 h before surgery. Physiological parameters
[arterial blood pressure and gases after tail artery cannulation and
insertion of a catheter (SIMS Portex, Ashford, UK) for rectal body
temperature] were measured and controlled within their physiological range during surgery (Table 1). Body temperature was measured
at 1 and 2 h of occlusion, and at 1 and 2 h of recirculation. Rats
were anesthetized initially with 4% isoﬂurane in N2O/O2 (70 : 30)
and during surgery with 2% isoﬂurane in N2O/O2, (Astra Zeneca,
S€
odert€alje, Sweden). The right common carotid artery (CCA) and
external carotid artery were occluded permanently, and the internal
carotid artery (ICA) was exposed and ligated. A silicon-coated nylon
ﬁlament (top diameter 0.3–0.4 mm; Doccol, Sharon, USA) was
carefully introduced into the ICA via a small incision into the distal
end of the CCA and advanced to occlude the origin of the MCA for
105 min. Regional blood ﬂow was monitored by an optical ﬁber
probe (Probe 318-I; Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden) connected to a
laser Doppler ﬂowmeter (Periﬂux System 5000; Perimed). Rats were
included in the study if regional blood ﬂow decreased by at least
70% immediately after the ﬁlament was placed; the regional blood
ﬂow reduction was sustained during the entire occlusion time

(105 min); and if the regional blood ﬂow was recovered within
5 min after the ﬁlament was removed. Sham-operated rats served as
controls. For those, the same protocol was applied except that a ﬁlament was advanced to occlude the MCA. Experiments were carried
out in accordance to the ARRIVE guidelines. In total, 68 rats were
operated on. Eighteen rats died during the ﬁrst 48 h after tMCAO
before inclusion into treatment groups.
Study design and treatment protocol
Animals were randomized, and the study was performed in a blinded
fashion to the investigator who performed surgeries and behavior
assessments. Loss of sensory motor function was assessed by rotating
pole test (Ruscher et al., 2009), the composite neuroscore and the
Garcia test 48 h after tMCAO (Encarnacion et al., 2011). Only animals fulﬁlling the prespeciﬁed inclusion criteria were assigned into
the treatment groups: (i) a total rotating pole score between two
and eight (sum of the scores obtained at 0 rpm, 3 rpm and 10 rpm);
(ii) a 17–23% weight loss within the ﬁrst 48 h after tMCAO; (iii) 11
or less points in the 18-points Garcia test. The following numbers of
animals were included: sham vehicle n = 8; sham levodopa/benserazide n = 7; tMCAO vehicle n = 10; and MCAO levodopa/benserazide
n = 12. Treatment was initiated on day 2 post-tMCAO, and for an
additional 5 days rats received daily 20 mg/kg levodopa combined
with 15 mg/kg benserazide (Sigma-Aldrich, Deisenhofen, Germany)
or saline by intraperitoneal injection (Fig. 1).
Rotating pole test
Sensorimotor deﬁcits were evaluated by the ability of the rat to traverse a wooden (length 1500 mm, diameter 40 mm, elevation
700 mm) rotating pole. The rats were trained the day before
tMCAO induction until they successfully traversed the pole and
reached a platform with no rotation, a rotation of 3 rpm and 10 rpm
to the right or left, respectively. Rats that did not learn the test
were not included in the study. A scoring system of 0–6 was used:
0 – the rat is not able to traverse the pole and falls off almost immediately; 1 – the rat enters the pole but is unable to traverse the pole
and remains sitting; 2 – the rat has severe difﬁculties to cross the
pole, and while crossing encompasses the pole and is not able to
reach the platform; 3 – the rat traverses the pole with its body close
to the pole and slipping with its paws but reaches the platform; 4 –
the rat traverses the pole with approximately 10 foot slips; 5 – the
rat traverses the pole with approximately 3–7 foot slips; 6 – the rat
traverses the pole with 0–2 foot slips (Ruscher et al., 2009). All testings were recorded and evaluated by a blinded investigator.
Composite neuroscore
To study sensorimotor function, a 28-point neuroscore was applied
(Encarnacion et al., 2011). In brief, the score consists of 11 subtests
with a cumulative maximum of 28 points indicating no deﬁcits. The
following functions were tested: circling; motility; general condition;
paw placement of each paw on a table; grip strength; righting reﬂex
when placed on the back; climbing on an inclined platform; contralateral reﬂex; contralateral rotation; visual forepaw reaching; and
ability to pullup itself on a horizontal bar.
Garcia test
The 18-points Garcia test was used to assess sensorimotor deﬁcits
after experimental stroke. The test includes six different subtests:

L-Dopa modulates the T-cell response after stroke 2465

Fig. 1. Experimental design. Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (tMCAO) for 105 min. On day 2 after
tMCAO, the neurological deﬁcit was assessed and rats were randomized into treatments groups. Levodopa (20 mg/kg)/benserazide (15 kg/mg) treatment was
initiated on day 2 and continued for an additional 4 days. On day 7 post-tMCAO, immune cells were isolated and T-cells were analysed by ﬂow cytometry.

spontaneous activity; symmetry in limb movement; forepaw outstretching; climbing; body proprioception; and response to vibrissae
touch. Each test gives a maximum of three points (Garcia et al.,
1995; Encarnacion et al., 2011).
Isolation of immune cells from brain tissue
Rats were anesthetized with isoﬂurane and perfused with saline for
4 min to remove circulating blood cells. Brains were removed,
hemispheres separated and freed from meninges. Hemispheres were
dissociated by a dounce homogenizer in ice-cold Hank’s balanced salt
solution [HBSS, supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin
(BSA; Sigma-Aldrich), 0.01% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA; Sigma-Aldrich)] and passed through a 40-lm nylon cell strainer (BD Biosciences, Stockholm, Sweden). Following centrifugation
at 400 g at room temperature (rt) for 10 min, the pellet was resuspended in a Percoll solution (30% in HBSS; Sigma Aldrich) and overlaid on a gradient of a 37% and 70% Percoll solution. Subsequent
centrifugation was performed at 500 g at rt for 20 min. Immune cells
were collected at the 37–70% interface and washed with HBSS containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After centrifugation (400 g, rt,
10 min), cells were resuspended in 500 lL phosphate-buffered saline
containing 0.2% BSA.
Preparation of protein extracts from brain tissue
Whole cellular protein extracts were prepared as described previously
(Ruscher et al., 2002). In brief, tissue from the infarct core was
homogenized by a dounce homogenizer in lysis buffer containing (in
mM): Tris (pH 7.5), 20; NaCl, 150; EDTA, 1; ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 1; phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF), 1; sodium
pyrophosphate, 2.5; b-glycerolphosphate, 1; sodium orthovanadate, 1;
supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (cat no. P2714; Sigma
Aldrich). After 15 min of incubation on ice, the homogenates were
centrifuged (18,000 g, 4 °C, 20 min) and the supernatant was collected for further analysis. Total protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford assay using BSA as standard.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis
One-hundred microliters of sample obtained from blood, spleen or
brain was stained with mouse anti-rat cluster of differentiation (CD)
3 ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated, mouse anti-rat CD4 allophycocyanin-conjugated, anti-rat CD8 phycoerythrin-conjugated and
anti-rat CD25 peridinin chlorophyll protein cyanine 5.5-conjugated
(all diluted to 1 : 200; BD Biosciences). After washing and centrifugation at 1006 g for 1 min, cells were ﬁxed with Cytoﬁx/CytopermTM (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

Unstained cells and ﬂuorescence minus one (FMOs) controls were
used in parallel.
Forty-eight hours after ﬁxation, cells were analysed and data collected using FACS AriaIII and FACS Diva software (BD Biosciences). Morphological analysis was performed by using the forward
(FSC) and side scatter (SSC) parameters. Up to 200 000 events
were acquired, and FSC threshold was set to 20 000. Data analysis
was performed by using the FlowJo (7.6.5 version; Tree Star,
Ashland, OR, USA) software. Cells were morphologically identiﬁed
by FSC and SSC, doublets were discriminated and further divided
by antigen positivity in respect to unstained cells and FMO controls
(Fig. 2). T-cells were identiﬁed as being CD3-positive and further
analysed for antigens mentioned above.
Serum preparation and cytokine analysis
Levels of cytokines in the brain were analysed by a multiplex
immunoassay (MSD Mesoscale, Gaithersburg, USA). We simultaneously analysed the following cytokines: IL-1b, chemokine (C-X-C
motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), IL-4, IL-5, IFN-c and IL-13 according to
manufacturer’s protocol.
Western blotting
Twenty micrograms of protein was separated on a 10% acrylamide
gel. Thereafter, proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes, and blocked with a solution containing
5% non-fat dry milk, 2% normal horse serum and 2% BSA. Following blocking, the membranes were incubated with goat anti-rat intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1; dilution 1 : 1000; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with a secondary antibody, donkey anti-goat horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
(dilution 1 : 10,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at rt. The
signals were visualized by using a chemiluminescence kit (Merck
Millipore, Billerica, USA) and CCD camera (Fujiﬁlm LAS 1000;
Fujiﬁlm, Tokyo, Japan). Membranes were stripped and reprobed
with anti-b-actin HRP-conjugated (dilution 1 : 50,000; Sigma
Aldrich, Deisenhofen, Germany).
Immunohistochemistry
Paraformaldehyde-ﬁxed free-ﬂoating brain sections (thickness
30 lm) were used. After quenching endogenous peroxidase activity
and blocking in normal rabbit serum, the sections were incubated
with a goat anti-rat ICAM-1 (diluted to 1 : 400; AbD Serotec
GmbH, D€
usseldorf, Germany) at 4 °C overnight. Following rinsing,
the sections were incubated with a biotinylated rabbit anti-goat

addition of 3,3-diaminobenzidine (Saveen and Werner, Limhamn,
Sweden) supplemented with 8% nickel chloride. Micrographs were
aquired using brightﬁeld microscopy (Olympus BX61; LRI
Olympus, Lund, Sweden) with a 10- and 40-fold objective.

P < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

Results
Levodopa/benserazide treatment reduces the number of
cytotoxic T-cells (CD3+CD8+), but does not affect overall
immune cell infiltration into the ischemic hemisphere
The presence of functional dopamine receptors on T-cells strongly suggests their susceptibility to dopaminergic treatments (Santambrogio
et al., 1993; Caronti et al., 1998; Ricci et al., 1998). We, therefore,
have investigated the inﬁltration and phenotype of T-cells in the brain
in response to levodopa/benserazide treatment on day 7 after tMCAO.
As shown in Fig. 3A, we observed a shift in the distribution of T-cells
following levodopa/benserazide treatment, namely, a decrease in
CD3+CD8+ cells (cytotoxic T-cells; MCAO vh 24.00  2.48%,
MCAO LD 15.44  2.29%; absolute number of cells are shown in
Table 2) in the ipsilateral hemisphere presented as a percentage of the
total CD3+ population. Cytotoxic T-cells were unchanged in the contralateral hemisphere (MCAO vh 23.5  3.18%, MCAO LD
20.09  2.79%; absolute numbers of cells are shown in Table 2;
Fig. 3B). Apart from changes in the number of CD3+CD8+ T-cells, the

overall inﬁltration of T-cells was not affected by levodopa/benserazide
treatment in the brain of rats subjected to tMCAO (Fig. 3C; Table 2).
In addition, levodopa/benserazide treatment had no inﬂuence on the
overall number of immune cells and CD3+ T-cells in the ischemic hemisphere (Fig. 3D and E); however, a signiﬁcant increase in the number
of cells was observed in animals subjected to tMCAO (MCAO vh
67,783  19,844 cells, MCAO LD 38,908  16,341 cells) compared
with sham-operated animals receiving the same treatment after surgery
(sham vh 19,588  5848 cells, sham LD 17,703  3273 cells). The
results clearly demonstrate that levodopa/benserazide treatment modulates the distribution of T-cells following tMCAO and thereby it may
modulate the tissue environment in the ischemic hemisphere.
Decreased levels of cytokines in the brain following levodopa/
benserazide treatment
Determination of inﬂammatory cytokines revealed an upregulation
of IFN-c (pg/mg; assay was performed in 50 lg protein), IL-1b,
IL-5 and CXCL1 in the ischemic hemisphere of vehicle-treated rats
following tMCAO compared with sham-operated animals (Fig. 4).
Levodopa/benserazide treatment signiﬁcantly decreased the level of
the pro-inﬂammatory cytokine IL-5. A tendency towards reduced
levels of IFN-c were also found, although no statistical signiﬁcance
was reached between the treatment conditions (P < 0.089, Fisher’s
LSD test). In contrast, levodopa/benserazide treatment had no effect
on the levels of CXCL1, IL-1b, IL-4 and IL-13 (Fig. 4). No signiﬁcant changes were observed in the contralateral hemisphere (data
not shown) between sham-operated rats treated either with saline or
levodopa/benserazide. Taken together, these data point towards a
modulation of the T-cell effector response by levodopa/benserazide
treatment in the ischemic hemisphere.
Downregulation of ICAM-1 after levodopa/benserazide
treatment following tMCAO
Our results strongly corroborate the involvement of dopamine in the
regulation of T-cell invasion in the ischemic hemisphere. Moreover,

contrast, a signiﬁcant expression of ICAM-1 was observed
predominantly in vessels in the proximal peri-infarct area and infarct
core 7 (data not shown) and 14 days following tMCAO. The
expression of ICAM-1 at 14 days after tMCAO prompted us to test
the hypothesis that levodopa/benserazide treatment affects levels of
ICAM-1. Western blots were performed from extract obtained from
the ischemic core of rats subjected to tMCAO, and treated either
with saline or levodopa (5 mg/kg)/benserazide (15 mg/kg) for
12 days (Ruscher et al., 2012). As shown in Fig. 5B, treatment signiﬁcantly reduced ICAM-1 levels (MCAO vh 2.07  0.09, MCAO
LD 1.74  0.05). From these experiments we conclude that poststroke treatment with levodopa/benserazide downregulates the
expression of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1, which correlates with
a reduced number of inﬁltrating cytotoxic T-cells.

previous studies suggested that adhesion molecules play an important role in inﬁltration of immune cells into the brain (Liesz et al.,
2011). We, therefore, sought to investigate if ICAM-1 is regulated
by levodopa/benserazide treatment after tMCAO. Figure 5A illustrates the expression of ICAM-1 in sham-operated rats showing a
very low expression in endothelial cells in the neocortex. In

Treatment with levodopa together with enhanced physical therapy
improves the recovery of lost neurological function after stroke
(Scheidtmann et al., 2001), but the treatment effects on mechanisms
of tissue reorganization including inﬂammatory processes in the
post-ischemic brain are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate
that levodopa-mediated actions in the post-ischemic brain may partially involve an attenuation of the delayed invasion of cytotoxic
T-cells and a reduction of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines in the ischemic hemisphere. Our results also support the idea that levodopamediated effects are dependent on downregulation of ICAM-1 levels
in the ischemic core, in particular in endothelial cells. In the following we will discuss the role of dopamine on T-cells and the inﬂuence on ICAM-1-mediated mechanisms for entry of peripheral
immune cells into the post-ischemic brain.
The role of dopamine on T-cell infiltration in the post-ischemic
brain
The temporal dynamics of immune cell accumulation in the postischemic brain have been studied and showed a delayed invasion of
T-cell populations (Arumugam et al., 2005; Gelderblom et al.,
2009; Liesz et al., 2013). In the present study we could conﬁrm
these data in a rat model of tMCAO. Interestingly, following levodopa/benserazide treatment, we found less cytotoxic T-cells in the
ischemic hemisphere, hence, the overall inﬁltration of immune cells
was not altered. While we have observed a lower number of
CD3+CD8+ T-cells in the ischemic hemisphere, direct stimulation of
D3 receptors expressed on na€ıve CD8+ T-cells selectively attracted
cytotoxic T-cells in the peritoneal cavity (Watanabe et al., 2006). If
these cells for example are retracted in peripheral lymphoid tissues
has to be determined in future investigations (Planas et al., 2012).

Catecholamines including dopamine have been implicated in the
regulation of immune responses (Bergquist et al., 1994; Buttarelli
et al., 2011). In particular, the proliferation and cytotoxic activity of
CD8+ T-cells expressing functional dopamine receptors could be
impaired after treatment with dopamine (Saha et al., 2001).
A reduced number of cytotoxic T-cells also might be associated
with an attenuation of speciﬁc functions and effects of T-cells,
including direct cytotoxic actions mediated by the release of
cytotoxins such as granzymes or cytotoxic granules with direct
neurotoxic effects to eliminate potentially harmful cells (Chaitanya
et al., 2010; Brait et al., 2012). In addition, invading cytotoxic
T-cells contribute to an increased vascular permeability of the
blood–brain barrier together with an impaired microcirculation and a
local inﬂammatory response at the neurovascular unit (Ishikawa
et al., 2003) and inﬂammatory response within the ischemic infarct
core (Yilmaz & Granger, 2010). Together with other resident and
invading immune cells, such as CD4+ T-cells, macrophages, neutrophils and brain endothelial cells, cytotoxic T-cells contribute to a
concerted release of pro-inﬂammatory molecules including cytokines. In addition, although not signiﬁcantly, the number of CD3+/
CD4+ was reduced in levodopa-treated rats subjected to tMCAO,
suggesting their susceptibility to the treatment. Further studies need
to address the mechanisms either of a direct or indirect modulation
by levodopa. Interestingly, while the number of CD3+/CD4+ were
non-signiﬁcantly lower in the post-ischemic brains of levodopa-treated rats, depletion of this cell population was reversed in the blood
of levodopa-treated rats after tMCAO (Kuric & Ruscher, 2014).
We also observed a reduction of the pro-inﬂammatory cytokine
IL-5 in the ischemic hemisphere of levodopa-treated animals. In
addition, we found a tendency towards reduced levels of IFN-c in

levodopa-treated rats after MCAO. Together, our data suggest that
levodopa attenuates the overall inﬂammatory response in the postischemic brain.
Dopamine has also been shown to downregulate CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cell activity mediated by the activation of D1 receptors on
these cells (Kipnis et al., 2004). In our model we did not observe
differences in the number of regulatory T-cells expressing CD4 and
CD25. Overall, our approach was aiming at investigating if treatment with levodopa has an effect on immune cell invasion into the
post-ischemic brain. However, a detailed analysis of regulatory
T-cell populations including CD8+/CD122+ expressing IL-10
(Banerjee et al., 2013) will be required in subsequent studies to
better understand the role of inﬂammatory processes in the postischemic brain. Hence, results showing that regulatory T-cells lack
beneﬁcial effects after experimental stroke (Kleinschnitz et al.,
2013) and that dopamine downregulates regulatory T-cells (Kipnis
et al., 2004) suggest an ambiguous role of these cells after stroke
dependent on the experimental condition and stroke model.
ICAM-1-mediated mechanisms of cell entry into the
post-ischemic brain
Expression of adhesion molecules is mainly attributed to postcapillary vessels to allow rolling of immune cells such as cytotoxic
T-cells to adhere and enter the brain parenchyma (Engelhardt,
2006). Accompanied with a reduced number of cytotoxic T-cells in

the ischemic hemisphere, we observed reduced levels of ICAM-1 in
the infarct core area of rats treated with levodopa/benserazide after
tMCAO. To the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst evidence that
treatment with levodopa affects the expression of ICAM-1 in the
brain. Similar effects of dopamine have been found in renal tubular
epithelial and endothelial cells (Kapper et al., 2002) and HUVEC
cells in cytokine-induced inﬂammation models (Sookhai et al.,
2000). Nevertheless, we are aware that T-cell migration across the
blood–brain barrier represents a complex process and requires a
ﬁne-tuned expression of molecules, including other adhesion molecules such as VLA-4 and endothelial VCAM-1 (Liesz et al., 2011)
in space and time either by endothelial cells, invading T-cells but
also brain resident cells (Engelhardt, 2006). In particular, further
analysis of T-cell antigens such as lymphocyte function-associated
antigen-1 (LFA-1) will be important in future studies. Importantly, a
reduced number of leukocytes has been demonstrated in LFA-1deﬁcient mice in the acute phase after experimental stroke
(Arumugam et al., 2004).
In conclusion, our results suggest that dopamine attenuates the
local inﬂammatory response in the ischemic hemisphere by a reduction of cytotoxic T-cells and a reduction of the pro-inﬂammatory
cytokine, IL-5 following experimental stroke. Our data suggest that
these effects are mediated by a reduced expression of ICAM-1 on
endothelial cells in the brain instrumental for adhesion of cytotoxic
T-cells to enter the brain parenchyma. Together, these results corroborate anti-inﬂammatory actions of dopamine that might be
exploited in future recovery enhancing stroke therapy.
