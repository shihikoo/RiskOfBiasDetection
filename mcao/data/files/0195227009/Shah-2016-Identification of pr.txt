Introduction

Stroke leads to severe neurologic impairment and causes
high morbidity and mortality. One subtype of stroke, cerebral
ischemia, involves several biochemical events including the
release of calcium, activation of excitatory neurotransmitters,
and the generation of excessive nitric oxide and free radicals
[1,2]. The accumulation of these reagents triggers neuronal
degeneration and neuronal death [2,3].

Curcumin is a major component of Curcuma longa Linn.
(Zingiberaceae) and is commonly present in turmeric [4].
It exhibits several pharmacologic properties such as antiinflammatory and antioxidant agent [5,6]. Curcumin exerts
neuroprotective effects in a variety of neurodegenerative
disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease,
and cerebral ischemia [7,8]. Moreover, curcumin protects
neuronal cells against middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
induced focal cerebral ischemia and counteracts oxidative

stress resulting from traumatic brain injury [5,9]. Curcumin
also diminishes infarct volume and improves neurologic
scores in focal cerebral ischemia [10,11]. Although there is
extensive evidence to support the neuroprotective effects of
curcumin, little is known about how curcumin provides these
benefits during focal cerebral ischemia. We postulate that
the neuroprotective actions of curcumin occur through the
modulation of various proteins. In this study, we used twodimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to
identify the differential expression of proteins induced and
suppressed by curcumin treatment for focal cerebral ischemia.

Materials and methods

2.1.

Experimental animals and treatment

SpragueeDawley rats (male, 225e250 g, n ¼ 56) were purchased from Samtako (Animal Breeding Center, Osan, Korea)
and were randomly divided into four treatment groups;
vehicle þ sham, curcumin þ sham, vehicle þ MCAO, and
curcumin þ MCAO (n ¼ 14 per group). The animals were
housed at 18 Ce22 C with a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle and had
free access to a pellet diet and tap water. All procedures
minimized animal suffering and followed a protocol approved
by the ethics committee concerning animal research at
Gyeongsang National University (GNU-LA-25). A single dose of
vehicle or curcumin (50 mg/kg) was given via intraperitoneal
injection 1 h after the onset of MCAO as described previously
[10,11]. Curcumin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in a
physiological saline solution including 1% dimethyl sulfoxide.
Vehicle-treated animals were injected with the same volume
of physiological saline.

2.2.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion

Rats were anesthetized with Zoletil (Virbac, Carros, France,
50 mg/kg), and MCAO was performed according to a previously described method [12]. Briefly, the right common carotid
artery, external carotid artery, and internal carotid artery were
exposed through a midline cut. The tip of a 4/0 nylon filament
was rounded with heat and inserted from the external carotid
artery, through the internal carotid artery, and advanced until
the tip occluded the origin of the middle cerebral artery. Sham
animals were received an operation including the same surgical procedure without filament insertion. At 24 h after the
onset of permanent occlusion, animals were decapitated, and
the right cerebral cortex was isolated.

2.3.

neurologic deficit were given a score of 4. These severely
affected rats showed very limited movements with depressed
consciousness.

2.4.

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis

For the extraction of proteins, samples were homogenized in
buffer solution (8 M urea, 4% CHAPS, ampholytes, and 40 mM
Tris-HCl), and the suspensions were centrifuged at 16,000 g.
Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer’s manual.
Immobilized pH gradient (IPG, range pH 4e7 and pH 6-9,
17 cm; Bio-Rad) gel strips were incubated in rehydration
buffer (8 M urea, 2% CHAPS, 20 mM DTT, 0.5% IPG buffer, and
bromophenol blue) for 13 h. Proteins were loaded on IPG strips
via sample cup, and first-dimension isoelectric focusing was
performed using Ettan IPGphor 3 (GE Healthcare, Uppsala,
Sweden) according to the following protocol: 200 V (1 h), 500 V
(1 h), 1000 Ve8000 V (30 min), and 8000 V (5 h). After firstdimension separation, the strips were incubated in equilibration buffer (6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% sodium dodecyl
sulfate, 50-mM Tris-HCl, bromophenol blue) containing DTT
and iodoacetamide. The strips were loaded onto gradient gels
(7.5%e17.5%), and second-dimension electrophoresis was
performed on Protein-II XI electrophoresis equipment (BioRad) at 5 mA per gel for 2 h, followed by 10 mA per gel at 10 C
until the bromophenol blue dye migrated off the bottom of
the gel.

2.5.
Silver staining, image analysis, and protein
identification
The gels were fixed in a solution containing 12% acetic acid
and 50% methanol for 2 h, washed with 50% ethanol, and then
treated with 0.2% sodium thiosulfate. The gels were then
washed with deionized water, stained by impregnation in a
silver solution (0.2% silver nitrate), and developed in 0.2%
sodium carbonate solution. The gel images were collected
using Agfa ARCUS 1200 (Agfa-Gevaert, Mortsel, Belgium).
The PDQuest 2-D analysis software (Bio-Rad) was used to
analyze differentially expressed protein spots among experimental groups. The detected protein spots were excised and
destained, and the gel particles were digested in trypsincontaining buffer. The extracted peptides were analyzed by
a Voyager-DE STR Biospectrometry Workstation (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for peptide mass fingerprinting.
Database searches were carried out using MS-Fit and ProFound programs. SWISS-PROT and NCBI were used as the
protein sequence databases.

Neurologic behavioral test
2.6.

The neurologic deficit score was determined based on 5-point
score (n ¼ 16), according to Longa et al. [12]. The neurologic
behavior was evaluated after 24 h of ischemia. Accordingly,
0 score indicates no observable visible sign of injury (no
ischemia), mild neurologic symptoms were depicted by
score of 1 in which the rats did not fully extend the forepaw
contralateral to MCAO, a score of 2 indicates occasional
rotating movements by the rats, 3 indicates spontaneous
circling by the rats most of the time, rats with severe

Western blot analysis

Western blot analysis was performed as previously described
[13]. The samples were dissolved in lysis buffer, and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was added as a protein inhibitor.
After sonication and centrifugation, protein concentration was
determined by a bicinchoninic acid kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL)
according to the manufacturer’s manual. Total protein (30 mg)
was electrophoresed on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel eletrophoresis gels and transferred to

j o u r n a l o f s u r g i c a l r e s e a r c h 2 0 1 ( 2 0 1 6 ) 1 4 1 e1 4 8

polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA).
The membranes were blocked with skim milk for 1 h at room
temperature to minimize nonspecific antibody binding. The
membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline containing
0.1% Tween-20 and then incubated with primary antibodies
against the following proteins: ubiquitin carboxy-terminal
hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH),
adenosylhomocysteinase, pyridoxal phosphate phosphatase
(PLPP), and actin (diluted 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology,
Beverly, MA). The membranes were washed in Tris-buffered
saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 and incubated with
secondary antibody (1:5000, Pierce). Amersham ECL Western
blotting detection reagents and analysis system (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) were used for signal detection
according to the manufacturer’s manual.

2.7.

Data analysis

All data are expressed as mean  standard error of the mean.
The results in each group were compared by two-way
analysis of variance followed by post-hoc Scheffe’s test. A
value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

3.1.
The prevention of neurobehavioral deficit in MCAO
with curcumin
Vehicle þ sham animals showed no obvious signs of neurologic deficit, whereas vehicle þ MCAO animals exhibited
severe focal neurologic deficit ranging from spontaneous
circling (score of 3) to depressed consciousness. Curcumin
treatment significantly reduced these scores, showing that
curcumin can improve neurologic behavior (Fig. 1).

3.2.
Identification of differentially expressed rat cortical
proteins by two-dimensional matrix assisted laser
desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry
Figure 2 shows the two-dimensional electrophoresis maps of
cerebral cortex proteins of vehicle þ sham, curcumin þ sham,
vehicle þ MCAO, and curcumin þ MCAO animals (pH range
4e7 and pH 6e9). Approximately 935 protein spots were
observed in each image. We detected 21 protein spots with
more than a 2.5-fold change in intensity. Among these spots,
19 proteins were clearly identified by matrix assisted laser
desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry analysis with protein sequence coverage of 17%e62% (Table).
However, three proteins were not identified by matrix assisted
laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry
analysis and were termed unknown proteins.

3.3.
The change of cellular metabolism and
differentiation-related proteins in MCAO with curcumin
Among the identified proteins, we focused on UCH-L1,
ICDH, adenosylhomocysteinase, PLPP, and eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A). The expression of four of these
proteins decreased in rats receiving vehicle þ MCAO, and
curcumin treatment attenuated the MCAO-induced decrease
of these proteins. However, PLPP expression increased in the
vehicle þ MCAO animals, and curcumin treatment attenuated
the injury-induced increase (Fig. 3).

3.4.
Western blot analysis of cellular metabolism and
differentiation-related proteins in MCAO with curcumin
Western blot analysis allowed the visualization of these
changes in protein expression. Protein levels are represented
as the ratio of intensity of the protein to that of actin. UCH-L1
levels were 0.48  0.02 and 0.72  0.03 in the cerebral cortices
of vehicle þ MCAO and curcumin þ MCAO animals, respectively (Fig. 4A). ICDH levels were 0.57  0.03 and 0.86  0.02 in
vehicle þ MCAO and curcumin þ MCAO animals, respectively
(Fig. 4B). Adenosylhomocysteinase levels were 0.76  0.02
and 0.94  0.03 in vehicle þ MCAO and curcumin þ MCAO
animals, respectively (Fig. 4C). PLPP levels increased
significantly in vehicle þ MCAO animals but remained similar
in curcumin þ MCAO and sham-operated animals. PLPP levels
were 1.09  0.02 and 0.95  0.01 in vehicle þ MCAO and
curcumin þ MCAO animals, respectively (Fig. 4D).

Discussion

Previous studies have shown that curcumin exerts a protective effect against cerebral ischemia in rats and significantly
reduces neurologic dysfunction and brain damage after
MCAO [7,10,11,14]. In this study, we identified differentially
expressed proteins induced by curcumin treatment in an
MCAO animal model. Among the identified proteins, we
focused on those associated with cellular metabolism and
differentiation.
Protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination are important processes for the maintenance of physiological cellular

function. UCH-L1 acts as a deubiquitinating enzyme and
monoubiquitin stabilizer. It also plays an essential role in the
ubiquitination of damaged, such as oxidized or aggregated
proteins [15]. Thus, it is accepted that UCH-L1 is an important
component of the ubiquitin proteasome system for degradation. Brain ischemic conditions lead to protein aggregation and
proteasome dysfunction, resulting in neuronal cell death [16].
UCH-L1 is considered as a novel biomarker for severe traumatic brain injury in humans [17]. UCH-L1 protects neurons
against oxidative stress, and downregulation leads to neuronal
degeneration [15,17]. UCH-L1 is required for normal synaptic
and cognitive function [18]. Decreases in UCH-L1 increase the
susceptibility of apoptosis [19]. Our proteomic approach
showed that levels of UCH-L1 are decreased during focal

cerebral ischemia. Moreover, these changes were confirmed
using Western blot analysis. Reduction in UCH-L1expression
leads to an imbalance of the ubiquitin proteasome system,
causing accumulation of compromised and aggregated and
induction of cell death [20]. We showed that curcumin
diminishes the decreased expression of UCH-L1 in MCAO
injury. This suggests that the maintenance of UCH-L1 in the
presence of curcumin can eliminate aggregated proteins by
inducing degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system.
Thus, regulation of UCH-L1 by curcumin may prevent neuronal
cell death by MCAO.
ICDH is an enzyme associated with energy metabolism and
mitochondrial function [21]. ICDH plays an important role
in the Krebs cycle by converting NADþ to NADH within the

mitochondrial matrix. NADH modulates broad biological
activities including energy metabolism and antioxidative
functions [22]. Decreases in this enzyme impair adenosine

triphosphate production and energy metabolism, which cause
pathologic lesions and cell death in brain ischemia [23,24].
Moreover, a previous study demonstrated mitochondrial abnormalities and reduced levels of ICDH in the brain tissue of
Alzheimer’s patients [24]. Our proteomics approach and
Western blot analyses revealed that ICDH is decreased in
vehicle-treated animals during MCAO, and curcumin treatment attenuated this decrease. ICDH mediates energy
metabolism, cell survival, and cell destiny. Thus, our results
suggest that maintenance of ICDH levels by curcumin actively
mediates energy metabolism and cell survival in ischemic brain
injury, ultimately resulting in a neuroprotective effect.
Adenosylhomocysteinase is an NAD-dependent tetrameric
enzyme that converts adenosylhomocysteine to adenosine and
homocysteine [25]. Adenosylhomocysteinase is dominantly
expressed in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum
and plays a neuromodulatory role in the central nervous system by exerting a neuroprotective effect against brain ischemic
injury [26,27]. Reduced levels of adenosylhomocysteinase lead
to accumulations of intracellular adenosylhomocysteine and
decreased methylation capacity, resulting in the decline of
adenosine levels [25,26]. This study shows an injury-induced
decrease of adenosylhomocysteinase expression in ischemic
brain injury that is ameliorated by curcumin treatment. The
downregulation of adenosylhomocysteinase in ischemic brain
injury decreases adenosine activity and its neuroprotective

effect. Thus, this study suggests that the maintenance of adenosylhomocysteinase by curcumin preserves adenosine levels,
providing neuroprotective effects during MCAO.
Pyridoxal phosphate is an active metabolite of vitamin B6
and necessary to produce biologic compounds including
nucleic acids, carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. Pyridoxal
phosphate has a known neuroprotective effect against brain
ischemia, and its deficiency causes a decrease in g-aminobutyric acid concentration, resulting in neurologic symptoms
and diseases [28,29]. Pyridoxal phosphate treatment protects
CA1 pyramidal cells from brain ischemic damage, increases
glutamic acid decarboxylase expression, and reduces
neuronal cell damage [28,30]. It also protects brain tissue
against glucose deprivation and ischemic damage [28]. PLPP
dephosphorylates pyridoxal phosphate and regulates
pyridoxal phosphate concentration by accelerating pyridoxal
phosphate degradation [31]. PLPP expression is known to
increase during brain ischemic injury [30], and our proteomics
study showed that this also occurs during MCAO injury, and
curcumin treatment attenuates this increase. The rise in
PLPP levels reflects the degradation of pyridoxal phosphate and
serious damage to neuronal cells in ischemic injury. Thus,
these findings demonstrate that curcumin treatment
maintains PLPP levels during MCAO injury, and the effects on
this protein contribute to the neuroprotective function of
curcumin.
eIF4A is a 46-kDa mammalian polypeptide involved in
protein translation initiation. eIF4A is critical for the binding
of messenger RNA to 40S ribosomal subunits and consists of
three closely related isoforms, eIF4A1, eIF4A2, and eIF4A3 [32].
Among the three isoforms, eIF4A2 is widely expressed in
normal tissue and plays a key role in protein synthesis initiation [33]. Our results demonstrated that eIF4A2 levels are
decreased in MCAO injury and relatively recovered by curcumin treatment. Although we did not show clear images using
Western blot analysis, our proteomic approach revealed the
regulation of eIF4A2 by curcumin treatment during MCAO
injury. This decrease in eIF4A expression suppresses the
initiation step of protein synthesis and leads to neuronal cell
death and neurologic disorders [34]. Thus, our results suggest
that maintenance of eIF4A2 levels by curcumin treatment
mediates the protection of neuronal cells during MCAO injury.

Conclusions

We demonstrate that curcumin regulates the expression of
various proteins in focal cerebral ischemia. Specifically,
curcumin prevents the injury-induced decrease in expression of UCH-L1, ICDH, adenosylhomocysteinase, and eIF4A.
Conversely, curcumin attenuates the injury-induced increase
in expression of PLPP. These proteins are associated with
cellular metabolism, differentiation, and protein synthesis
and contribute to the maintenance of physiological cellular
function. Moreover, it is accepted that UCH-L1, adenosylhomocysteinase, and pyridoxal phosphate exert neuroprotective
effects. Thus, our findings provide evidence that curcumin
modulates the expression of various proteins for neuroprotection against focal cerebral ischemia.
