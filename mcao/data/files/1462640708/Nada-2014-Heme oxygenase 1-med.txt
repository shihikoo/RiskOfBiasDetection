Abstract Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death and a
major cause of disability in stroke survivors. Studies have
underlined the importance of repair mechanisms in the recovery
phase of stroke. Neurogenesis in response to brain injury is one
of the regeneration processes that, if enhanced, may offer better
stroke treatment alternatives. Previously, we have demonstrated
antioxidant, neuritogenic, and angiogenic properties of Ginkgo
biloba/EGb 761® (EGb 761) in different mouse models of
stroke. In the present study, we were interested to study whether
EGb 761 could protect mice from permanent middle cerebral
artery occlusion (pMCAO) and enhance neurogenesis. EGb 761
pre- and posttreated mice had lower infarct volume and
improved motor skills with enhanced proliferation of neuronal
stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) at 24 h and 7 days posttreatment.
Netrin-1 and its receptors (DCC and UNC5B) that mediate
axonal attraction and repulsion were observed to be
overexpressed in NSPCs only, implying that netrin-1 and its
receptors might have partly played a role in enhanced
neurogenesis. Interestingly, in heme oxygenase 1 knockout mice
(HO1−/−), neurogenesis was significantly lower than in vehicletreated mice at day 8. Furthermore, EGb 761 posttreated mice
also demonstrated heme oxygenase 1 (HO1)-activated pathway
of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3 α/β (p-GSK-3
α/β), collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2),
semaphorin3A (SEMA3A), and Wnt, suggesting probable
signaling pathways involved in proliferation, differentiation,
and migration of NSPCs. Together, these results propose that
EGb 761 not only has antioxidant, neuritogenic, and
angiogenic properties, but can also augment the repair and
regeneration mechanisms following stroke.

Introduction
There is considerable evidence available in the literature
highlighting the active repair and recovery mechanisms
following stroke, and it is believed that neurogenesis is one
of them. Studies on rodent experimental stroke have shown
that adult neurogenesis occurs in the forebrain, and these
newly born neuroblasts migrate toward the sites of injury in
an attempt to fix the damaged area of the brain [1, 2].
Neurogenesis is a complex developmental process involving
proliferation, differentiation, migration, survival, maturation,
and functional integration of neural stem/progenitor cells
(NSPCs) into the neuronal circuit [3, 4]. In the adult
mammalian brain, there are different regions where neurons
are generated throughout life: the subventricular zone (SVZ),
subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, and the posterior
periventricular area [5, 6]. Cerebral ischemia can stimulate

946

proliferation of NSPCs that migrate to the damaged brain
areas [7, 8] to repair the damaged neurons, but only a few
develop into mature neurons, most of which die due to the
lack of a suitable environment for neuronal differentiation in
the ischemic lesion. It is still unclear whether these progenitor
cells replace necrotic cells and to what extent [9].
Experimental approaches have been undertaken to enhance
regeneration or restore lost functions after stroke with
exogenously injected or transplanted human-induced
pluripotent stem cells [10], umbilical cord blood-derived
aldehyde dehydrogenase-expressing progenitor cells [11],
and endothelial progenitor cells from umbilical cord [12].
Recent studies predicted that intensifying neuronal
differentiation and survival around the ischemic area can
improve the clinical outcome. Nevertheless, controversies on
ethics, dosing modalities (number of cells to be injected), site of
injection, possible immune reactions, and incidence of tumor
formations associated with stem cell therapy have stimulated
the idea of enhancement of endogenous neurogenesis with
exogenous molecules or drugs—specifically natural
products—which appears to be an innovative tool for poststroke neuroregeneration and repair therapy.
Ginkgo biloba /EGb 761® (EGb 761) is a popular and
standardized natural extract purportedly used worldwide for
the treatment of many diseases, and it has been studied
extensively in different disease models. Previously, our group
has demonstrated the neuroprotective properties of EGb 761
in different models of stroke; the mechanism of action was
reported to be mediated by upregulation of the antioxidant
[heme oxygenase 1/(HO1/Nrf2)] pathway as well as
neuritogenic [collapsing response mediator protein-2
(CRMP-2)] and angiogenic [endothelial nitric oxide synthase
(eNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)] [13,
14] properties. With all these divergent molecular mechanisms
already in place and being evaluated in different stroke
models, in the present study, we embarked on finding whether
EGb 761 can also augment endogenous neurogenesis and
contribute to the repair and regeneration phase of stroke.
In the present study, we investigated the role of EGb 761 on
neurogenesis-enhancing properties and the possible involvement
of HO1, phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3 α and β
(p-GSK-3 α/β), CRMP2, semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A), Wnt, and
the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling
pathway. Furthermore, the role of HO1 on neurogenesis was
studied by using HO1 knockout (HO1−/−) mice.

and Utilization Committee, and the guidelines of the National
Institutes of Health were followed throughout the study. Male
C57BL/6 mice, 8–10 weeks old and 20–25 g, were procured
from Charles River Laboratories and were housed at 22±1 °C
with a 12-h:12-h light/dark cycle.
HO1 Knockout Mice
Heterozygous HO1 (HO+/−) mice, originally from the colony of
Dr. Susumu Tonegawa, MIT, were obtained from Dr. Anupam
Agarwal, University of Alabama. HO1−/− mice were obtained
by mating male chimeras with C57BL/6 females. HO+/−
animals were intercrossed to produce HO1−/− mice. Genotypes
of mice were determined by PCR analysis of progeny tail DNA
as previously described [15]. Primers for wild type (forward
primer: 5′ GGTGACAGAAGAGGCTAAG 3′ and reverse
primer: 5′ CTGTAACTCCACCTCCAAC 3′) and mutant
(forward primer: 5′TCTTGACGAGTTCTTCTGAG 3′ and
reverse primer: 5′ ACGAAGTGACGCCATCTGT 3′)
generated 450 and 350 BP, respectively, for the wild-type and
mutant mice.
Permanent Distal Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
(pMCAO)
We used our previously optimized method to occlude the
distal portion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) [13, 16].
Mice anesthetized with isoflurane, initially with 2 % and then
maintained at 1 %, were operated on under a surgical
microscope. Aseptic conditions were maintained by using
sterile drapes, hand gloves, and autoclaved surgical
equipment. A thin 1.0-cm vertical skin incision was given
between the right eye and ear, the temporal muscle was moved
aside by forceps, and the underlying temporal bone was
exposed. A 2.0-mm hole was drilled with a dental drill exactly
over the region of the distal MCA visible through the temporal
bone, and the dura mater was separated carefully. Using a
bipolar coagulator, the distal part of the MCA was occluded
directly and severed to interrupt the blood flow to the area
supplied by the artery. A rectal probe was used to monitor core
body temperature, which was maintained at 37.0±0.5 °C
during the procedure with a heating blanket. After the surgery,
mice were moved to a temperature-regulated incubator and
kept for 2 h to recover from surgery; they were later shifted to
home cages.

Animals
All animal protocols were approved by The University of
Toledo Health Science Campus Institutional Animal Care

EGb 761 (100 mg/kg), kindly provided by Willmar-Schwabe
Pharmaceutical, Germany, was administered to mice for 7 days
before surgery for pretreatment paradigms. In another cohort
of mice, EGb 761 was immediately administered 4 h after
pMCAO and continued for 7 days. For neurogenesis

Mol Neurobiol (2014) 49:945–956

experiments, sham, vehicle, EGb 761 posttreated, and HO1−/−
mice were injected with 100 μL of 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine
(BrdU) (10 mg/mL of concentration) at 4 h following surgery
and then continually for 7 days.
Motor Function
Motor function was measured by a person blinded to the
treatment groups. Mice were placed on a moving rod of a
rotarod, which was preprogrammed to rotate at 1 rpm with an
acceleration rate of 1 rpm every 10 s until the animal fell from
the rod. All animals were trained to run on a rotarod assembly
prior to the surgery. The time at which the animal fell from the
accelerating rod was recorded and registered as the latency to
fall. The readings obtained prior to surgery were noted as
baseline for each mouse.

dilutions: 1:300, 1:300, 1:250, 1:250, and 1:100, respectively.
The slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C, washed with 1×
PBS for 10 min, and incubated with fluorescent anti-mouse,
anti-rabbit, and/or anti-chicken secondary antibody (Jackson
Immuno Research, West Grove, PA) at the dilution of 1:500
for 2 h at RT. After another set of washings, the slides were
mounted with DAPI (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX) and then sealed
with nail polish.
For BrdU analysis, 12–15 captures were taken from the
side of the injury for each section/four to five brain sections/
mice/three mice each group. The sections were cut
approximately at the coordinates between −0.94 and −2.92
from bregma. The netrin–BrdU-positive cells were counted
and averaged, and the ratio was determined by dividing
netrin–BrdU-positive cells by the total DAPI cell counts.
Isolation of Cytosolic Fraction and Western Blot Analysis

Infarction Volume Analysis
Animals from all the treated groups were euthanized on day 8
after the pMCAO procedure. Brains from mice were dissected
out, sliced into five 2-mm-thick sections, and incubated in 1 %
triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma Co) in a normal
saline solution for 20 min at 37 °C. Brain sections fixed
overnight in 4 % formaldehyde solution were used for infarct
volume analysis using Image J software provided by NIH and
calculated as the percentage of the contralateral cortex, with
correction for swelling.
Brain Sectioning and Immunohistochemistry
Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and
transcardially perfused with saline followed by 4 %
paraformaldehyde. Mice brains were removed and stored for
24 h in 4 % paraformaldehyde at 4 °C before sectioning into
6 μm sections, and four to five brain sections were placed on
each slide and stored at −80 °C until use. Brain sections were
incubated in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed with
1× PBS buffer, and antigen-retrieved with 10 mM citrate
buffer (pH=6.0) using a pressure cooker for 4 min; sections
were allowed to cool for 10 min at room temperature (RT).
Permeability was performed by incubating the sections with
1 % Triton-X100 in 1× PBS buffer for 30 min and then by
washing again with 1× PBS buffer. Denaturation was
accomplished with 2 N HCl for 30 min at RT, and the slides
were neutralized with 0.1 M sodium borate for 20 min at RT
and washed again. The slides were blocked with 3 % bovine
serum albumin fraction IV (RPI Corp., Mount Prospect, IL)
for 1 h at RT, followed by incubation with primary antibodies
for anti-BrdU mouse (Thermo Scientific, West Palm Beach,
FL), chicken anti-Netrin (Thermo Scientific), rabbit antiUNC5B (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), rabbit anti-DCC
(Abcam), and rabbit anti-BDNF (Abcam) using the following

Brain cortices of mice were dissected out, weighed, and
homogenized as described before [13, 14]. Protein
concentration was determined by Bio-Rad Bradford reagent
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), and samples were
analyzed by loading equivalent amounts of total cytoplasmic
proteins (25 μg) onto 10 or 12 % SDS-polyacrylamide gels.
Proteins were transferred from the gel to PVDF membrane
(Millipore, Billerica, MA) and blocked with 5 % dry nonfat
milk and/or 3 % BSA for 1 h at RT followed by overnight
incubation at 4 °C with the following antibodies: rabbit antiHO1 (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI), mouse anti-actin
(Millipore), rabbit anti-CRMP-2 (Millipore), rabbit antiSEMA3A (Abgent, San Diego, CA), rabbit anti-BDNF
(Abcam), rabbit anti-Wnt (Abcam), rabbit anti-p-GSK-3 α/β
(Thermo Scientific), mouse anti-GSK-3 α/β (Thermo
Scientific), and rabbit anti-GAPDH (Thermo Scientific) using
the following dilutions:1:1,000, 1:2,000, 1:60,000, 1:400, 1:1,
000, 1:1,000, 1:1,000, and 1:2,000, respectively. After
washing with 1× PBS-T buffer three times (15 min/wash),
membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody, goat
anti-rabbit, and/or goat anti-mouse, at a dilution of 1:4,000
(Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories). Images were
analyzed using Bio-Rad chemi DocTM XRS+ image analyzer.
The densitometric values were normalized with respect to the
values of actin immunoreactivity to correct for any loading
and transfer differences between samples.
Statistical Analysis
All behavioral parameters and infarct volumes between
treatment groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with
Newman–Keuls post hoc test. For protein analysis, the
differences between the treatment groups were determined
by Student's t test. In all statistical analyses performed, a value
of p <0.05 was considered to be significant.

Results
Pre- and Posttreatment with EGb 761 Reduces Infarct Size
and Improves Locomotor Activity
Previously, we have demonstrated that a single dose of EGb
761 4 h after pMCAO protected mice from brain stroke injury
and improved neurologic deficits [13]. Here, we wanted to test
the protective effects of multiple doses of EGb 761 using
pretreatment and posttreatment paradigms and evaluate its
neurogenesis-enhancing properties. Mice pre- and posttreated
with EGb 761 recovered significantly faster than the vehicletreated group 7 days after pMCAO (Fig. 1). In the
pretreatment study, mice were orally administered EGb 761
for 7 days before pMCAO and survived for an additional
7 days without any drug treatment. Locomotor activity was

significantly increased at 24 h (p =0.03) and at day 8 (p =0.04)
after pMCAO, and infarct volume showed a significant
decrease (30.9±3.4; p =0.01) at day 8 (Fig. 1b–d) compared
to vehicle (43.5±2.7). In the posttreatment paradigm, mice
treated with EGb 761 immediately, at 4 h following pMCAO,
and then daily for 7 days showed significantly increased
locomotor activity at day 8 (p = 0.01), which was also
corroborated with decreased infarct volume (30.4±3.4; p =
0.01) (Fig. 1b–d). This data suggests that EGb 761 treatment
enhanced stroke recovery, as evidenced by improved
neurobehavioral parameters and lower stroke volume.
EGb 761 Posttreatment Enhances Neurogenesis
Several reports, including ours, have documented the
neuroprotective properties of EGb 761, but its neurogenesis-

Mol Neurobiol (2014) 49:945–956

enhancing properties are yet to be investigated. To address this
question, we selected 24 h and day 8 time points for the
quantification of BrdU-positive cells. As shown in Fig. 2a,
b, neurogenesis was detected in sham mice, and there was no
specific distribution; rather, it was scattered throughout the
brain. We were able to distinguish between NSPCs and
nonstem cells by netrin-1 protein expression. In this study,
we showed that netrin-1 protein expression was specifically
expressed at the highest level in NSPCs. After 24 h of stroke,
vehicle-treated mice and HO1−/− mice showed significantly
increased neurogenesis compared to sham mice (p =0.038 and
p =0.01, respectively), whereas neurogenesis in EGb 761
posttreated mice was significantly increased compared to
sham mice (p = 0.025), HO1 −/− mice (p = 0.015), and
vehicle-treated mice (p =0.024) (Fig. 2a–c, e). On the other
hand, we did not detect any significant differences between
vehicle-treated and HO1−/− mice 24 h after pMCAO. Seven
days after stroke, neurogenesis was observed to be
significantly increased in EGb 761 posttreated mice as
compared to both vehicle-treated (p =0.015) and HO1−/− mice
(p = 0.008). Interestingly, HO1−/− mice had significantly
decreased neurogenesis as compared to vehicle-treated mice
(p =0.028). Neurogenesis in EGb 761 posttreated mice at 24 h
and day 8 was not statistically significant. The distribution of
NSPCs in the brain at 24 h showed a differential pattern from
vehicle-treated to EGb 761-treated mice. In vehicle-treated
mice, the distribution of NSPCs was concentrated in the
striatum and lateral ventricle area, and only a few neurons
migrated to the injury site, whereas the distribution of NSPCs
in the EGb 761 posttreated mice was concentrated at the
border of the injury site and mainly in the cortex, and a few
cells were found in the striatum. Figure 5d is the representative
brain section showing infarct area demarcated by red dotted
lines and the square represents the area where BrdU–netrin-1positive cells were counted.
Expression of Netrin-1 and Its Receptors, Deleted
in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) and Uncoordinated Gene 5B
(UNC5B), in NSPCs
In this study, we were able to demonstrate that netrin-1 and its
receptors, DCC and UNC5B, were expressed only in NSPCs,
and their expression was found 24 h and 7 days after pMCAO
(Fig. 3a–d). These data suggest that netrin-1 and its receptors
are required for migration of NSPCs from the SVZ to the site
of injury.
Expression of BDNF in NSPCs
Next, we investigated the possibility that NSPCs may also
express different neuronal markers besides netrin-1 and its
receptors. BDNF, a neurotrophic factor involved in
proliferation, differentiation, and viability of neurons in the

949

mammalian brain, supports the survival of existing neurons
and promotes the growth and differentiation of new neurons
and synapses [17]. We found that BDNF was expressed in
both NSPCs and neuronal cells (Fig. 4a, b).
Signaling Pathway of EGb 761-Induced Neuroprotection
and Neurogenesis
In order to determine the molecular mechanism(s) and the
signaling pathway involved in EGb 761 neurogenesis,
Western blot analysis was performed to measure protein
expression levels of HO1, p-GSK-3 α/β and total GSK-3
α/β, CRMP-2, SEMA3A, Wnt, and BDNF in mice brain
cortices of the following groups: sham, EGb 761 + no
pMCAO, EGb 761 pre- and posttreatment+pMCAO, and
vehicle-treatment+pMCAO. Consistent with our previous
results [13], HO1 protein expression was not significantly
increased in vehicle (p =0.06) as compared to the sham group.
However, a significant increase in HO1 expression as
compared to vehicle was observed only in EGb 761
posttreated mice (p =0.02) but not in the pretreatment group
(Fig. 5a, b). CRMP-2 protein expression was significantly
decreased in vehicle-treated mice (p = 0.003) and was
observed to be increased in the EGb 761 pre- (p =0.03) and
posttreated (p =0.004) mice (Fig. 5c, d). SEMA3A protein
expression showed an increased trend in the vehicle-treated
group, which was further nonsignificantly increased in the
EGb 761 posttreated group (Fig. 5g, h). Wnt protein
expression was significantly downregulated in vehicletreated mice compared to the sham group (p =0.004), whereas
the EGb 761 pre- (p =0.02) and posttreated (p =0.01) groups
exhibited significantly increased levels of Wnt compared to
the vehicle-treated group (Fig. 5g, i). BDNF protein
expression did not exhibit any significant changes across all
treatment groups, but an increasing trend was observed from
sham to vehicle and vehicle to pre- and posttreated groups
(Fig. 5g, j). p-GSK-3 α/β to total GSK-3 α/β significantly
decreased in the vehicle-treated group as compared to sham
(p =0.04), and expression levels were restored to the levels of
sham in EGb 761 pre- (p =0.02) and posttreatment (p =0.02)
groups (Fig. 5e, f).

Discussion
In this study, we report a novel signaling pathway
involving HO1 for EGb 761-mediated neurogenesisenhancing properties in mice pMCAO model of
ischemia. Our data are based on the findings that
EGb 761 significantly reduced stroke damage by
reducing cortical infarct volume in both pre- and
posttreated mice. These protective effects also translated into
improved functional recovery. HO1−/− mice demonstrated

950

reduced neurogenesis at day 8 after pMCAO, further
reinforcing the role of HO1 signaling in neurogenesis.

stroke, most of them migrate toward the location of ischemic
damage. Factors responsible for the migration of these NSPCs
to the peri-infarct area include chemokine/chemokine
receptors and matrix metalloproteases [18]. Recent studies
have linked the level of adult neurogenesis to brain function
in both normal and diseased brain, and these findings make
possible the use of NSPCs in the treatment of brain injuryrelated diseases [19–21]. Previously, we demonstrated that
EGb 761 has neuroprotective, antioxidant, and neuritogenic
properties [13, 14], and in this report, we extended our
investigation to explore the role of EGb 761 as a
neurogenesis-enhancing nutraceutical by using the standard
procedure of BrdU to detect NSPCs in different groups
subjected to pMCAO and EGb 761 treatment.
The process of neurogenesis involves a large number of
secreted extracellular molecules that have been shown to
regulate the migration of NSPCs including netrin-1 and
semaphorins [22, 23]. Netrin-1 and its receptors, DCC and
UNC5B, mediate axon attraction and repulsion and are highly
expressed in the central nervous system during embryonic
development as well as in adulthood, but at relatively low
levels [24, 25]. Previous studies have demonstrated that using
small molecules such as lithium chloride, sodium valproate,

kenpaullone, or indirubin-3 monoxime increases neurogenesis
by inhibiting GSK-3 activity [26]. Curcumin and metformin
have also been shown to increase neurogenesis and cognition
[27, 28]. Netrin-1 is a chemotrophic factor expressed on the
floor plate cells in the central nervous system and is involved
in either promotion or inhibition of axonal growth, depending
on which receptor it binds to [29, 30]. Also, there is
documented evidence that netrin-1 can act as a guidance
molecule for neuronal migration [31, 32], and its
overexpression can induce angiogenesis in the mouse brain;
thus, it participates in neovascularization and vessel
remodeling after ischemic stroke [33]. In the present study,
we were able to demonstrate that netrin-1 and its receptor,
DCC and UNC5B, were only expressed in NSPCs in all
treatment groups, suggesting that netrin-1 plays an important
role as a guidance molecule for migration of NSPCs. The
numbers of netrin-1/NSPCs were significantly increased in
EGb 761 posttreated mice brains after pMCAO at 24 h and
7 days posttreatment, which suggests that EGb 761 plays a
role in the enhancement of neurogenesis. It is important to
mention that we observed a differential distribution of the
NSPCs in sham, vehicle, and EGb 761 posttreated groups.
In the sham group, the NSPCs were distributed in the whole
brain section, whereas in EGb 761 posttreated mice, large
numbers of NSPCs were observed to have migrated towards
the cortex and close to the border of the injury site (penumbral
region). On the other hand, vehicle-treated mice showed
NSPCs mainly in the striatum, and few cells migrated towards
the border of the injury site. These results suggest that EGb
761 enhanced the migration of NSPCs towards the penumbral
region and consequently enhanced the recovery from stroke.
These results also illustrate that EGb 761 targets NSPCs
outside the ischemia area and directs their migration towards
the penumbra area. This might also explain the global effect of
the EGb 761 on the brain of the mice since pMCAO is a

permanent occlusion and blood flow to the distal part of the
MCA is totally obscured. In agreement with our study, many
studies have demonstrated that protein expression was
elevated for netrin-1 and its receptors, DCC and UNC5, after
brain injury or brain ischemia [24, 34], signifying their role in
regulating the growth of axons and preserving cell survival.
However, there is a disagreement between our results showing
a slight decline but not a significant one in the number of
netrin-1/NSPCs 7 days after pMCAO and those of Tsuchiya
et al. [35], which showed that netrin-1/NSPCs peak at 14 days
after stroke. This controversy may be attributed to the
differences in the stroke model or species and/or the endpoint
of day 8 used in our study. Also, we were able to show that
NSPCs expressed BDNF protein, which is a specific marker for
neuronal cells and enhances proliferation and differentiation of
NSPCs [36, 37]. Recently, stroke-induced migration of
neuroblasts to the ischemic site was shown to be controlled
by BDNF signaling [38], and its expression post-stroke is
associated with stroke recovery and improved learning and
memory [39]. Previous results from our lab revealed that
EGb 761 treatment upregulated the in vitro expression of both
HO1 and CRMP-2 proteins. Consistent with our previous
study, HO1 was upregulated only by EGb 761 posttreatment,
and CRMP-2 was upregulated in both EGb 761 pre- and
posttreatment paradigms. The link between the upregulation
of HO1 and CRMP-2 has already been demonstrated in our
previous study using HO1 inhibitor in in vitro neuronal cultures
[14]. CRMP-2 overexpression stimulates nerve regeneration,
suggesting the involvement of CRMP-2 in neuronal survival
[40]. In addition, we have also reported that HO1−/− mice suffer
from higher stroke damage at day 8 after pMCAO than wildtype mice, and EGb 761 treatment did not attenuate stroke
damage in HO1−/− mice [13]. Pertinent to the previous
evidence, we only planned to study the level of neurogenesis
in HO1−/− mice at 24 h and 7 days after pMCAO. Concomitant

with the findings of higher infarct volume at day 8 after
pMCAO, we observed significantly reduced levels of NSPCs
in HO1−/− mice, suggesting that HO1 partly plays a role in
neurogenesis after ischemic injury.

CRMP-2 acts as a component of the SEMA3A signaling
pathway [41, 42]. SEMA3A is a secreted protein and a potent
neuronal chemorepellent for sensory, sympathetic, and motor
axons [43]. SEMA3A is a repulsive axon guidance cue that

954

causes a dramatic collapse of the growth cone [41, 44] due to
the redistribution of F-actin cytoskeleton [45]. Other studies
demonstrated that SEMA3A acts as a chemoattractant and
chemotropic molecule [22, 46] that guides the migrated cells
towards their destination [47]. The switch of SEMA3A from
chemorepulsion to chemoattraction requires activation of the
cGMP/NO pathway [46, 48], which is activated by HO1mediated upregulation of VEGF and eNOS [49]. We reported
an increasing trend in SEMA3A expression levels from sham
to vehicle-treated groups and from vehicle-treated to EGb 761
(significant increase) posttreated groups, which suggest its
role as a chemoattractant in our studies. GSK-3, a serine–
threonine kinase family protein also involved in the
neurogenesis pathway, plays a key role in regulating neuronal
morphogenesis, including the determination and maintenance
of axonal identity. Studies have also shown that inhibiting
GSK-3 β expression induces angiogenesis in myocardial
ischemia and promotes neurorestoration [50]. It is also
required for neurotrophin-mediated axon elongation and can
antagonize the canonical Wnt pathway, thus playing a central
role in neural development and adult neurogenesis [51]. In the
present report, we demonstrated that EGb 761 inhibited
GSK-3 activity by increasing its phosphorylation on Ser 21/9
of both GSK-3 α and β subunits.
Many studies have indicated that the canonical Wnt
signaling pathway is crucial for mammalian central nervous
system development and regulates diverse processes
including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration
[52, 53]. Moreover, the Wnt signaling pathway is an obligate
component of differentiation of NSPCs into neurons [54]. A
recent study demonstrated that Wnt signaling is able to
increase the survival of newly produced neurons [9]. A recent
study from Vanella et al. showed that HO1 acts upstream of
the canonical Wnt signaling cascade [55]. In our study, we
observed increased Wnt protein expression in EGb 761 postand pretreatment groups as compared to the vehicle-treated
group. These results suggest that EGb 761 enhances Wnt
expression through activation and upregulation of HO1
protein expression, which in turn activates the neurogenesis
signaling pathway.
EGb 761 Posttreatment Versus Pretreatment
In this report, we demonstrated that most of the signaling
molecules required for neurogenesis were upregulated in
posttreatment paradigms at day 8. Although both treatments
were able to protect mice brain from ischemic stroke, the
difference in expression levels may be attributed to repeated
EGb 761 doses after pMCAO instead of no EGb 761
treatment after pMCAO in pretreatment paradigms. Although
we did not look beyond 7-day post-stroke, it would be
worthwhile to conduct future longitudinal studies with 14 to
29 days of survival time points.

Fig. 6 Proposed signaling pathway of EGb 761-induced neuroprotection
and neurogenesis. We postulate that putative neuroprotective mechanism
of EGb 761 is mediated through: (1) The first submechanism is EGb 761
activates the HO1 pathway and HO-1 cleaves heme to form biliverdin and
CO. Biliverdin is subsequently converted to bilirubin by biliverdin
reductase, an antioxidant CO, which has the ability to bind to the iron
atom of the heme moiety associated with soluble guanylyl cyclase,
thereby activating the enzyme and increasing intracellular cyclic
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production. cGMP can regulate axon
branching by converting SEMA3A from chemorepulsion to
chemoattraction and also by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3
(GSK-3). GSK-3 inhibition increases the activity of CRMP-2, which
leads to cell survival and cell neuroplasticity. (2) The second
submechanism is EGb 761 activates VEGF which activates eNOS
leading to elevated NO levels that mediates the conversion of SEMA3A
from chemorepulsion to chemoattraction and ultimately to angiogenesis.
(3) The third submechanism is through the elevation of Wnt protein
which leads to the activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway subsequently
displacing GSK-3 from the complex which leads to the neurogenesis.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we propose that EGb 761 pre- and
posttreatment protects mice from pMCAO-induced damage,
and posttreatment helps the recovery and regeneration process
of stroke by enhancing neurogenesis. In this study, we were
able to dissect out the EGb 761 neuroprotective signaling
pathway. Based on our previous studies [13, 14, 56], HO1
has turned out to be a key candidate that activates several

Mol Neurobiol (2014) 49:945–956

signaling cascades. HO1 is a rate-limiting enzyme required for
the conversion of deleterious heme into neuroprotective
products like bilirubin, biliverdin, and carbon monoxide
(CO). CO is required for the activation of soluble guanylyl
cyclase and increases the intracellular cyclic guanosine
monophosphate (cGMP) production [57], consequently
inhibiting the GSK-3 [58]. HO1 also increases Wnt protein
expression, which is required for neurogenesis [55].
Furthermore, HO1 activation of VEGF and eNOS leads to
an increase in nitric oxide (NO) production, which can act as a
second messenger and enhance learning ability and
neurogenesis [49]. The novel signaling pathway (illustrated
in Fig. 6) is suggested to involve HO1 in activating the
signaling pathway mechanisms of angiogenesis, cell survival
and/or neuroplasticity, and neurogenesis. Discovering natural
products that can enhance the post-stroke regeneration process
provides an innovative tool for improving treatments for
stroke recovery.
