Abstract Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is the only FDA approved treatment for the brain ischemic stroke. MicroRNAs, noncoding RNA sequences that regulate gene expression,
might play important roles in regulating the rtPA thrombolysis process. The present study investigated changes in
the microRNA profiles in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) mouse model after rtPA treatment. Using
microarrays containing 1179 microRNAs, we compared
microRNAs expression profiles of brain tissues from C57
BL/6J mice subjected to focal cerebral ischemia with and
without rtPA thrombolysis. We found that rtPA treatment
upregulated 31 microRNAs and downregulated 11 microRNAs. Expression alterations of selected microRNAs
mmu-miR-125a-3p, -208a-5p, -709, -721 were confirmed
by real-time PCR. Differentially expressed microRNAs
were analyzed using Targetscan v6.2 and David v6.7. 2200
predicted genes were subjected to GO analysis and pathway analysis, which identified mediators involved in
multiple signaling pathways during proliferation. These
data demonstrated that rtPA treatment alters microRNAs

Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of high disability rate and mortality worldwide. It is estimated that ischemic stroke accounts for about 85 percent of all strokes in Europe and
North America [1]. To date, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatment for acute ischemic
stroke [2]. Treatment of the acute ischemic stroke patients
with intravenous rtPA infusion within 3 h improves the
clinical outcome at 3 months owing to its thrombolytic
effect [3]. Earlier thrombolytic treatment led to reduced
mortality and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage [4].
However, studies showed the tPA also has deleterious effects on the ischemic brain [5].
microRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small non-coding
conserved RNAs. They bind to corresponding target
mRNAs to degrade the target mRNAs or to inhibit the
translation [6]. It is suggested that over one-third of human
genes are modulated by microRNAs in diverse biological
and pathological processes [7, 8]. Recent studies show that
microRNAs are crucial in regulating brain functions after
stroke [9].
In this study, we examined brain microRNAs expression
after rtPA thrombolysis treatment in a mouse middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model to elucidate predicted target genes and relevant signaling pathways.

Materials and methods
Animals and experiment groups
All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai Jiao
Tong University. Adult male SPF C57BL/6J mice (n = 24,
age 8–12 weeks, weight 24 ± 3 g) were employed in this
study (Shanghai Laboratory Animal Research Center,
Shanghai, China). All mice were housed at room temperature (20–23 °C) on a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle, with
unlimited access to soft food and tap water. Mice were
randomly divided into 2 groups (n = 12 each): (1) MCAo
group: left middle cerebral artery was occluded with nylon
monofilament for 24 h; (2) MCAo?rtPA group: left middle
cerebral artery was occluded with nylon monofilament for
2 h, and then rtPA (10 mg/kg, Boehringer Ingelheim,
Germany) was administered intravenously for 15 min and
then the monofilament was removed for reperfusion
(Fig. 1).

Neurol Sci (2015) 36:1463–1470

Mouse body temperature was maintained at 36.5 ± 0.5 °C
using a heating plate.
To mimic the clinical treatment for brain ischemic
stroke using rtPA, we designed the following experiment
modified from the Toru Yamashita methods [12]. To
simulate the tPA-associated thrombosis and reperfusion
process, 10 mg/kg rtPA (Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany)
was administrated for 15 min, followed by withdrawing the
nylon monofilament from the origin of the middle cerebral
artery for reperfusion.
Measurement of functional outcome
At 24 h after MCAo, neurological deficits were scored as
previously described [12], with minor modifications. A sixpoint scale was used: 0, normal; 1, mild circling with the
contralateral forelimb upon lifting of the animal by the tail;
2, mild consistent circling to the ipsilateral side, but normal
posture at rest; 3, consistent circling to the ipsilateral side
strong; 4, severe rotation, loss of walking; and 5, leaning to
the ipsilateral side with no spontaneous motor activity.

Animal model of middle cerebral artery occlusion
and rtPA preconditioning

microRNA microarray

The left middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded according to the standard operation procedures (SOP) for
MCAo in mice [10, 11]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized
with peritoneal injection of 1 % pentobarbital sodium
(0.6 mL/100 g, SCRC, China) and then a midline neck
incision was made. The left common carotid artery
(LCCA), left external carotid artery (LECA), and left internal carotid artery (LICA) were isolated for inserting the
nylon monofilament (4–0, Johnson & Johnson, USA)
through a small incision in the LCCA. The monofilament
was fixed in position tightly and then the incision was
sutured. Cerebral blood flow was evaluated with laser
doppler flowmetry (Perimed, Sweden) during MCAo.

24 h after operation, mice were anesthetized with chloraldurat (35 mg/100 g, SCRC, China) and killed, and left
brain was collected. Total RNA of each mouse brain
sample was extracted and purified using the mirVana microRNA isolation kit in accordance with the manufacturer’s procedure (AM 1560, Ambion, USA). Quality control
of the total RNAsamples was assessed using Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). microRNA
molecules in total RNA was labeled using microRNA
complete labeling and hyb kit (5190-0456, Agilent technologies, USA), and hybridized to the MicroRNA microarrays according to conditions recommended by the
manufacturer. The microarrays were scanned using an

Fig. 1 Experimental flow diagram. Mice were divided into MCAo group and MCAo?rtPA groups, after operation and functional measurement,
mice were killed at 24 h, and brain tissue was collected for microRNA array analysis

Analysis of functional microRNAs regulation
in the brain
microRNAs that were significantly altered (p \ 0.05) more
than 2-fold between the MCAo and rtPA thrombosis group
were chosen for biologic functional analysis. Predicted
target genes of differentially expressed microRNAs were
determined using Targetscan v6.2 (http://www.targetscan.
org/). The brain microRNA and predicted mRNA target
genes were then subjected to biological pathways analyses
using David v6.7 (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) online.
Statistical analysis
microRNA microarray raw data were normalized by
quantile algorithm, gene spring software 11.0 (Agilent
technologics, USA). The microRNAs that were altered
more than 2-fold and featured a p value of the threshold
less than 0.05 were presented and selected for the miRNA
functional and pathway study. Mouse neurologic scores in
the study are presented as mean ± SD. A Student t test was
used to evaluate the significance of comparisons. SPSS
17.0 (PASW, US) was used for the statistical analysis, and
a 2-tailed probability value \0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

Results
rtPA treatment alters microRNAs expression
in the MCAo mice model
We evaluated the neurological scores in animals in the
MCAo and rtPA thrombolysis groups (n = 10 each) 24 h
after surgery. There were statistically significant differences in neurological scores between the two groups with
rtPA thrombolysis having improved functional outcome
(rtPA thrombolysis vs MCAo, 1.60 ± 0.70 vs 2.70 ± 0.67,
respectively; p = 0.003).
To examine whether rtPA treatment will alter the expression profile of microRNAs after cerebral ischemia, we
analyzed the expression profiles of mature microRNAs in
brain tissues isolated from MCAo mice and MCAo mice
treated with rtPA (n = 4 each, randomly picked from each
group) using a microRNA microarray platform (Fig. 2).

Discussion
rtPA is the only approved medicine for the treatment of
acute brain ischemic stroke world wildly [13]. However,
the biological process of rtPA thrombolysis is still not fully

123

understood. The present study utilized a mice model to
mimic rtPA thrombolysis to profile microRNAs expression.
In this study, we demonstrated that rtPA treatment altered
expression profiles of multiple micorRNAs after MCAo in
mice. To our knowledge, this is the first report on microRNAs expression in MCAo after rtPA thrombolysis in
mouse brain tissue. In addition, many of the altered microRNAs could potentially regulate the activities of TGFbeta superfamily receptors, including TGF-beta1 receptor,
activin receptor activities, and many cancer related pathway and neuron axon, long-term potentiation related
pathways. These results suggest that rtPA treatment might
be relevant to neuron regeneration, axon repair, and the
restoration of injured neural function. These data provide
the basis for further investigation of biological function of
the altered microRNAs after rtPA treatment for MCAo.
microRNAs expression profile after MCAO has been
investigated by several studies [14, 15]. Wang et al. [14]
compared microRNAs expression profile of 2 h MCAo and
reperfusion without rtPA till 24 h with that of normal

Neurol Sci (2015) 36:1463–1470

control in animal model, and found that total 64 miRNAs
were downregulated and 2 miRNAs were upregulated
(miR-503-3p and miR-23a-5p). Lee et al. [15] studied
microRNAs expression profiles between 3, 24 h MCAo
and normal control in mouse model. In our study, to mimic
the clinical treatment for brain ischemic stroke using rtPA,
rtPA was administrated after 2 h MCAo followed by
withdrawing the nylon monofilament from the origin of the
middle cerebral artery for reperfusion. Then we compared
microRNAs expression profiles between MCAo with rtPA
treatment and 24 h MCAo alone. Our results showed that
rtPA thrombolysis affected 43 microRNAs differential
expression at 24 h, among them 31 were upregulated and
11 were downregulated. Lee et al. [15] found that miR125a-3p, miR-709, and miR-721 were upregulated at 24 h
MCAo compared with normal control. miR-125a-3p, miR709, miR-721 were also found upregulated in rtPA administration group in our study. The functions of these
microRNAs in MCAo pathological process need further
examination.
Using real-time PCR, we validated that the level of
mmu-miR-125a-3p, -208a-5p, -5121, -709 and -721 increased after rtPA treatment. miR-125a-3p, which modulates p53 and Fyn related signals [16, 17], inhibits
migration and invasion in several cancer cell types and
functions as a tumor-suppressing microRNA [17, 18].
Kumar et al. [19] showed that miR-125a-3p targeted genes involving cytokines, chemokines, and apoptotic genes
in mouse brains infected with West Nile virus. Previous
studies have indicated miR-208a was increased after acute
myocardial infarction [20], and mir-208a might induce
myocardial fibrosis through increasing endoglin expression [21]. In Adilakshmi, T’s study, miR-709 could induce gene silencing of the Egr2 promoter by combining
with H3K27me3 and Argonaute-1, following peripheral
nervous system injury [22]. Additionally, this biological
modulation might affect schwann cells differentiation
following brain ischemic injury. Although miR-125a-3p
and miR-709 show regulatory roles in neuropathy, and
miR-208 plays an important role in myocardial fibrosis,
the function of miR-125a-3p, -208a-5p, and -709 in brain
ischemic injury may need further study. The PubMed
database shows no related studies for many differentially
expressed microRNAs detected in our study. Further
studies are needed for those differentially expressed microRNAs, their target genes, and their functions in
neuropathogenesis.
In summary, our data showed that rtPA thrombolysis
induced changes in the microRNAs expression profile.
Notably, these altered microRNAs might regulate the
rtPA thrombolysis process, which could be helpful for
further analyze of the biological function of rtPA in
thrombolysis.
