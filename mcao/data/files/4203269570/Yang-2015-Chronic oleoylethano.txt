Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) has been shown to have neuroprotective effects after acute cerebral ischemic
injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of chronic OEA treatment on ischemia-induced
spatial cognitive impairments, electrophysiology behavior and hippocampal neurogenesis. Daily
treatments of 30 mg/kg OEA signiﬁcantly ameliorated spatial cognitive deﬁcits and attenuated the
inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model.
Moreover, OEA administration improved cognitive function in a manner associated with enhanced
neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Further study demonstrated that treatment with OEA markedly
increased the expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors a (PPARa). Our data suggest that chronic OEA treatment can exert functional
recovery of cognitive impairments and neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemic insult in rats via
triggering of neurogenesis in the hippocampus, which supports the therapeutic use of OEA for cerebral
ischemia.

1. Introduction
The prevalence of cognitive impairments after stroke is high
[1]. Spatial memory is closely dependent on hippocampal
formation [2]. Neurogenesis in the hippocampus has been
correlated with learning and memory [3]. Focal cerebral ischemia
provokes newly born neurons from the subgranular zone (SGZ) to
migrate into the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) [4]. They
subsequently incorporate into the synaptic circuitry, which
contributes to the formation of hippocampal-dependent memories

[5]. These studies raise the possibility that a compensatory increase
in hippocampal neurogenesis may mitigate spatial cognitive deﬁcits
after stroke. However, the majority of ischemia-induced newly born
cells undergo death within several weeks, and the survival rate of
newly generated cells is low. The therapeutic potential of neurogenesis induced by cerebral ischemia itself is insufﬁcient [6]. Therefore,
ﬁnding new compounds directed at increasing endogenous hippocampal neurogenesis may be a new strategy for restoring cognitive
function impaired after stroke.
Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is a potent endogenous ligand for
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors a (PPARa), nuclear
receptors involved in the transcriptional regulation of lipid
metabolism, inﬂammation, and neuroplasticity [7,8]. The synthesis of endogenous PPARa ligand, OEA, is induced on demand
after local accumulation of stimuli in the brain following an
injury, such as cellular stress and cerebral ischemia [9,10]. The

L.- Yang et al. / Biochemical Pharmacology 94 (2015) 270–281

neuroprotective effects of OEA have been described in animal
models of neurological disorders [11–13]. A recent study also
indicates that OEA protects the nigrostriatal circuit from 6OHDA-induced neurotoxicity through a PPAR a-dependent
mechanism [14]. Moreover, our previous study showed that
OEA had the ability to improve neurological dysfunction, reduce
infarct volume, and alleviate brain edema 24 h after focal
cerebral ischemia [15]. Thus, although the positive effects of
OEA on acute cerebral ischemia has been veriﬁed, little is known
about the long-term positive effects of chronic OEA administration on ischemic stroke, especially the progress of spatial
cognitive function recovery, electrophysiological behavior, and
endogenous hippocampal neurogenesis. Therefore, we set out to
examine the functions of OEA as well as to investigate whether
OEA has the ability to protect a rat brain during the chronic phase
of ischemic stroke.
To test this hypothesis, a middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) rat model was established. The best-studied cellular
model for hippocampal learning and memory is the detection of
long-term potentiation (LTP), which is a long-lasting increase in
the synaptic transmission efﬁciency induced by the high frequency
stimulation [16]. The Morris water maze (MWM) test is a memory
test based on the capacity of animals to rescue themselves by
reaching a hidden goal platform in a pool of water. Animals with a
damaged hippocampus display spatial navigation impairments
and perform poorly in the MWM test [17]. In the present study, we
investigated the effects of OEA on improving cognitive deﬁcits in a
focal cerebral ischemia model induced by MCAO. In brief, MWM,
LTP and endogenous hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroplasticity were used to evaluate the effects of OEA on rat brain function
at the later stages of ischemic stroke, which may provide an
interesting view of the potential application of OEA for ischemic
stroke.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental animals
All experimental procedures were performed in accordance
with the Provisions and General Recommendation of Chinese
Experimental Animal Administration Legislation, and all efforts
were made to minimize pain and suffering in the animals. Male
Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 260–280 g were purchased
from Beijing Vitalriver Experimental Animal Co. (Beijing, China)
and housed under a 12/12 h dark/light cycle and speciﬁc
pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. The animals were fasted without
food deprivation for 12 h before the MCAO procedure was
performed.
2.2. Preparation of the focal cerebral ischemia model
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) using the intraluminal ﬁlament technique, as
previously described [18]. In brief, after anesthesia was induced
with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg, i.p.), 4-0 nylon monoﬁlament
suture, with rounded tips, was introduced into the right internal
carotid artery (ICA) through the external carotid stump, advanced
approximately 20 mm past the ECA/ICA bifurcation to occlude the
origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) at the junction of the
circle of Willis. The suture was withdrawn 120 min after to allow
reperfusion. Sham-operated rats were treated with an identical
surgery except that the intraluminal ﬁlament was not inserted.
Throughout the procedure, body temperature was maintained at
37  0.5 8C. Rats were excluded if hemorrhage was found in the brain
slices or at the base of the circle of Willis during postmortem
examination.

2.3. Experimental protocol and drug treatment
Fig. 1 shows the chemical structure of OEA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA) and the design of experiments. On day 0, rats were subjected
to MCAO and then returned after 24 h of recovery to standard,
individual cages. Behavioral assessments were made on day 7 after
surgery to give the animals sufﬁcient time to recover from surgery.
Our previous study showed that both 20 and 40 mg/kg OEA had
protective effects against focal cerebral ischemic injury, while the
effects of OEA at dose of 40 mg/kg were more potent than those of
20 mg/kg [15]. In the present study, rats received i.p. injection of
OEA (dissolved in PEG/tween 80/saline, 5:5:90, 30 mg/kg) daily
starting on day 8 after ischemia induction and continuing to 14 or
35 days after MCAO. To determine whether OEA treatment
improves spatial cognitive impairment, the MWM test was tested
during days 43–48 after MCAO. The design of this experiment
included a 7-day withdrawal (from day 36 to 42 after MCAO)
following 28 days of chronic OEA treatment before we performed
the MWM test. The purpose of selecting this paradigm is to exclude
the possibility of acute responses of OEA treatment on cognitive
performance and to reﬂect the effects of hippocampal neurogenesis on cognitive performance. To examine whether OEA increases
neurogenesis, rats were injected i.p. with 5-bromo-20 -deoxyuridine (BrdU; Sigma) 50 mg/kg twice daily, at 8-h intervals. For the
cellular proliferation study, animals were sacriﬁced 12 h after the
last BrdU injection (from post-ischemic day 12 to 13 after MCAO)
to examine the number of newly formed cells in the DG of injured
hippocampus. To determine the survival and cell phenotype of the
newly born cells, BrdU was administered to rats for 3 days (from
post-ischemic day 11 to 13), animals were sacriﬁced 28 days after
the last BrdU injection (at post-ischemic day 42). To determine
whether hippocampal neurogenesis is necessary for the effects of
OEA on spatial cognitive performance after ischemic stroke, we
used a telomerase inhibitor, 30 -Azido-deoxythymidine (AZT;
Sigma), to ablate neurogenesis. Rats were treated with 100 mg/
kg AZT per day i.p. during the period of OEA treatment (from day
8 to 35 after MCAO). The dose of AZT used was based on a previous
study [19]. The MWM test and neurogenesis performed 42 days
after MCAO (28 days after the last BrdU administration) by the
same approach mentioned previously.
The inhibition of PARP-1 by OEA (0.032–10,000 mM) was
measured by universal PARP colorimetric assay kit (Trevigen,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) (Trevigen, USA) is provided at
200 mM in Ethanol as a control inhibitor. The experiment was
repeated three times. IC50 values were calculated using GraphPad
Prism 5 software.
2.4. Morris water maze test
The Morris water maze was used to test spatial learning and
memory [17], and was performed during days 43–48 after MCAO.
Brieﬂy, the maze consisted of a circular water tank (120 cm in
diameter and 50 cm high). The water temperature was kept at
25  1 8C. A black circular platform (10 cm in diameter) was 2.0 cm
below the surface of the water in the center of the quadrant and
remained in the same position. There were prominent visible cues
around the room. The experiment included two phases:
Phase I. Acquisition: Acquisition training consisted of 5 days of
conditioning with four trails per day from day 43 to 47 after ischemia. For each trail, the rat was placed in the water facing the wall of
the pool at one of the four starting points (north, south, east or west)
and allowed to swim for a maximum of 90 s. If the rat found the
platform, it was allowed to remain on it for 15 s. If it did not ﬁnd the
platform, it was guided to it and allowed to remain there for 15 s.

In experiment 1, BrdU (50 mg/kg i.p.) was given twice daily during days 12–13. BrdU immunohistochemistry was performed on day 14 after MCAO. In experiment 2, rats
received BrdU twice daily during days 11–13 after MCAO, immunohistochemistry was performed on day 42 after MCAO, and the water maze test was performed during days
43–48 after MCAO. In experiment 3, ZAT was administered during the period of OEA treatment (day 8–35), immunohistochemistry was performed on day 42 after MCAO, the
water maze test was performed during days 43–48 after MCAO.

Phase II. Probe trails, on day 48, the platform was removed and
rats were given one 90-s retention probe test. During retention, the
number of times each animal crossed the position in which the
platform had previously been located and the time spent in the
quadrant were measured.
2.5. Electrophysiological recordings
At post-ischemic day 42, rats were anesthetized with urethane
(1.2 g/kg, i.p) and the body temperature was maintained at 37 8C
via a constant temperature heating pad. The head was mounted in
a stereotaxic frame (SN-3, Narishige, Japan), small holes were
drilled in the skull for inserting stimulating and recording
electrodes. The tip of the recording electrode was positional in
the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) (3.8 mm posterior
to bregma and 2.0 mm lateral to the midline). The stimulating
electrode was inserted into the ipsilateral perforant pathway (PP)
(7.5 mm posterior to bregma and 4.2 mm lateral to the midline).
After every 20 s for 30 min stable baseline recording, a highfrequency stimulation (HFS) of 10 trains of 10 stimuli at 100 HZ
with 200-ms inter-train interval) was given to the animals in the
four groups. After tetanic stimulation, the amplitude of population
spikes (PS) was recorded for 60 min. The averaged PS amplitude of
ﬁve different time points within 30 min before HFS was determined as the baseline value. The percentage of the ratio of absolute
of PS amplitude to baseline value was used to present the PS

amplitude level. It was deﬁned as a successful induction of LTP if
the amplitude of the PS changed.
2.6. Immunohistochemistry and cell counting
Rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg, i.p.)
and perfused transcardially with ice-cold saline, followed by a
perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde on day 1 or 28 after last BrdU
injection. Brains were removed and post-ﬁxed overnight for 24 h in
paraformaldehyde, and then coronal sectioned (40 mm) using a
vibrating microtome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). The sections were
collected in PBS.
Every ﬁfth free-ﬂoating section per hippocampus, which was
400 m apart, was selected. For BrdU labeling, the sections were
treated with 2 N HCl (60 min at 37 8C), and then rinsed in borate
buffer for 10 min (0.1 M, pH 8.5). They were incubated in PBS
containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 10% normal goat serum for 1 h at
room temperature, following by incubation with rat monoclonal antiBrdU (1:400; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 4 8C overnight. After several
PBS rinses, sections were incubated with Alexa ﬂuor 594 donkey antirat IgG (1:200; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For double-labeling of
BrdU and NeuN (marker for mature neurons), sections were
incubated with primary antibodies rat anti-BrdU (1:400; Abcam)
and mouse anti-NeuN (1:100; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) at 4 8C
overnight, then incubated with secondary antibodies Alexa Flour
594 donkey anti-rat IgG (1:200; Invitrogen) and Alexa Flour
488 donkey anti-mouse for 2 h at room temperature.

L.- Yang et al. / Biochemical Pharmacology 94 (2015) 270–281

An experimenter (Y.L.C) coded all slides from the experiments
before quantitative analysis. All BrdU-labeled cells in the DG of
injured hemisphere were counted in each section by another
experimenter (G.H) blinded to the study code. The total number of
BrdU-labeled cells per section was determined and multiplied by
10 to obtain the total number of cells per DG. The number of
double-stained BrdU/NeuN positive cells was analyzed by ﬂuorescence confocal microscopy (EX61; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
2.7. Western blot
At post-ischemic day 14, 4–5 rats were decapitated under
anesthesia. The hippocampi from the injured hemispheres were
separated, frozen quickly in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80 8C.
Hippocampus tissue were homogenized with lysis buffer (50 nm/L
NaCl, 1 mM/L EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate and 20 mM/L Tris HCl; pH 7.5) and centrifuged at
15,000  g for 20 min. Fifty-mg protein per lane were run on
polyacrylamide gel, transferred on to a PVDF membrane (Millipore,
Billeria), and blocked with 5% milk solution (nonfat dry milk in
PBST) for 2 h. The membrane was incubated at 4 8C overnight with
speciﬁc antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-BDNF (1:1000; cell
signal technology, Boston, MA, USA), GAP-43 (1:1000; cell signal
technology), synaptophysin (SYP) (1:1000; cell signal technology),
PPARa (1:1000; Abcam), Cleaved PARP-1 (1:1000; cell signal
technology) and mouse monoclonal anti-b-acting (1:10,000;
Sigma). After washing with TBST ﬁve times, the membrane was
then incubated with the corresponding conjugated anti-rabbit or
anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000; cell signal technology) at room
temperature for 1 h. Immunoreactive proteins were detected with
an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Millipore, Billeria), the
relative density of the protein bands was scanned using an LAS
4000 Fujiﬁlm imaging system (Fujiﬁlm, Tokyo, Japan), and
analyzed by densitometric evaluation using the Quantity-One
software (Bio-Rad Hercules, CA, USA).
2.8. Statistical analysis
All data are presented as means  S.E.M. Escape latencies in place
navigation were compared using two-way repeated measures
ANOVA. Data for spatial probe and LTP recording were compared
using one-way ANOVA. Signiﬁcance levels were established at a level
of P < 0.05. The analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
5 software.
3. Results
3.1. OEA attenuated spatial cognitive deﬁcits
To examine the effects of chronic OEA treatment on spatial
learning and memory, we exposed animals to the water maze task
after 28 days of OEA treatment and 7 days of drug withdrawal.
Spatial learning was assessed by the time required to ﬁnd the
hidden platform (escape latency). The swimming traces of shamoperated and OEA-treated rats concentrated in the target zone
where the platform had been set. However, the swimming traces of
the vehicle-treated rats were uniformly distributed around four
zones (Fig. 2A). The escape latencies were progressively shorter in
all groups in a day-dependent manner. On day 46, group
comparisons revealed that animals in the sham group displayed
a shorter latency in ﬁnding the platform when compared with that
of vehicle group (sham: 21.63  3.40 s; vehicle: 49.88  1.78 s;
P < 0.05) and similarly on day 47 (sham: 14.57  1.42 s; vehicle:
46.81  1.51 s; P < 0.01). These results indicated that the experimentally induced focal cerebral ischemia resulted in a signiﬁcant
impairment of memory acquisition and conﬁrmed the use of this

273

model in investigating OEA effects on improving cognitive ability.
After OEA treatment, the escape latency was markedly decreased on
day 47 (23.62  2.58 s; P < 0.01). These data showed that OEA
treatment effectively improved the spatial learning across the 5-day
training period. There were no signiﬁcant differences between the
OEA-treated and sham-operated rats in escape latency (Fig. 2B,
P > 0.05).
During the spatial probe trails, in which the platform was
removed, ischemic rats spent less time searching in the target
quadrant (sham: 21.18  2.23 s, vehicle: 12.68  1.56 s; P < 0.05) and
the number of the crossing platform position (sham: 6.67  1.20,
vehicle: 0.50  0.49; P < 0.01) compared with sham-operated rats
(Fig. 2D and E). OEA-treated rats exhibited markedly increased time
spent in the target quadrant (OEA: 22.97  1.82 s; P < 0.05) and the
number of the crossing platform position (OEA: 5.33  0.66; P < 0.01)
compared with vehicle group (Fig. 1D and E). Therefore, chronic OEA
treatment ameliorates ischemia-induced spatial memory impairments.
To exclude the possibility that the improvement of chronic OEA
treatment on spatial learning and memory in MCAO rats was not due to
sensorimotor abnormalities, we analyzed swimming ability. There was
no difference in swimming speed among the groups of rats across the
ﬁve training days (F4, 18 = 0.06, P > 0.05; Fig. 2C), suggesting that the
impaired spatial cognitive ability of ischemic rats on the water maze
task is not caused by motor deﬁcits. Additionally, we performed a
visible cued task to exclude abnormal basic learning or visual acuity
problems among the animals. The vehicle- and OEA-treated rats did not
exhibit any impairment in cue-task performance (data not shown).
3.2. OEA attenuated ischemia-induced reductions of LTP at the
PP-evoked DG synapse in vivo
To investigate whether OEA can modulate cerebral-ischemiainjury-induced suppression of LTP at the PP-DG synapse in vivo,
the amplitude of the PS height was measured. In the vehicle group,
the PS amplitude was signiﬁcantly reduced compared with that in
the sham-operated group (vehicle: 149.70  7.79%, sham:
249.30  10.40%, P < 0.01; Fig. 3B). Additionally, we found that
chronic OEA treatment attenuated this change (OEA: 238  9.29%,
vehicle: 149.70  7.79%, P < 0.01; Fig. 3B).
3.3. OEA promoted proliferation of neural precursor cells
Ischemic injury enhances neurogenesis in the DG [20],
neurogenesis in the adult DG is closely related to hippocampusdependent memory [3]. To investigate the effect of OEA on
hippocampal neurogenesis, we ﬁrst examined neuronal progenitor
cell proliferation in the rats with OEA or vehicle for 7 days (from
day 8 to day 14 after MCAO) by BrdU administration per day for
2 days (at post-ischemia days 12 and 13). The BrdU-treated rats
were killed the following day to estimate the number of BrdU
positive cells (BrdU+). We observed a signiﬁcant difference in the
number of BrdU+ cells between vehicle-treated rats and shamoperated rats (sham: 524.30  39.18, vehicle: 1342  125.4,
P < 0.01; Fig. 4B), suggesting that ischemic injury could promote
neuronal progenitor cell proliferation. In contrast, the number of
BrdU+ cell in the DG of injured hemisphere was robustly increased by
OEA-treatment after MCAO (OEA: vehicle: 1342  125.4,
2062  129.9, P < 0.01; Fig. 4B). These data suggest that treatment
with OEA could increase hippocampal DG progenitor cells proliferation after cerebral ischemia. We also tested the effect of OEA by itself
on the proliferation of neuronal progenitor cells without cerebral
ischemia. The result showed that there was no difference in the
number of BrdU+ cells of the DG between the sham-operated rats and
OEA-treated rats (sham: 524.30  39.18, OEA: 561  35.46, P > 0.05;
Fig. 4B). It indicated that OEA had no effect on progenitor cells
proliferation in the DG in normal rats.

3.4. OEA enhanced the survival of newborn cells
After cerebral ischemia, some newborn cells die, whereas
others survive and differentiate into mature neuronal cells. To
examine the inﬂuence of OEA treatment on cell fate, we treated

rats with OEA for 28 days (from day 8 to 35 after MCAO) and BrdU
for 3 days (from day 11 to 13 after MCAO). The rats were killed
28 days after the last BrdU injection. The number of BrdU+ cells
increased approximately twofold in the OEA-treated group
compared with that in the vehicle-treated group (OEA:

strongly inhibited induction of LTP in rats after MCAO. In animals pretreated with 30-mg/kg OEA for 4 weeks, ischemia did not impair the induction of LTP compared with the
MCAO group. (B) The evoked synaptic responses were summarized by calculating the average of the PS amplitude 5–60 min after HFS. All data are presented as the

1243  97, vehicle: 544  23, P < 0.01; Fig. 5B), suggesting that
chronic OEA treatment increased the survival of newly born cells in
the hippocampus after ischemic stroke. There was no signiﬁcant
difference in the number of BrdU+ cells between vehicle-treated and
sham-operated group (sham: 486  37, vehicle; 544  23, P > 0.05;
Fig. 5B).
3.5. OEA increased the number of newborn mature neurons and
neuroplasticity but had no effect on glia cell generation
To determine the neuronal phenotype of BrdU-positive cells in
the DG of injured hemisphere, brain sections were colabeled with
antibodies to BrdU and NeuN (neuronal marker) or BrdU and glial
ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP, glial marker). In the present study,
we found that the number of BrdU+/NeuN+ cells in the vehicletreated rats was not signiﬁcantly different from that in the shamoperated rats. Additionally, a marked increase in the number of
BrdU+/NeuN+ cells (436.7  55.48 for vehicle, 1011  88.52 for OEA,
P < 0.01; Fig. 6A-c) was observed in the OEA-treated rats, suggesting
that chronic OEA treatment could promote the generation of newborn
neurons after ischemic stroke. We also evaluated the effect of OEA on
astrocytic differentiation of newborn neural precursor cells. As shown
in Fig. 6B-c, there was no signiﬁcant difference in the number of
BrdU+/GFAP+ cells (124  14 for vehicle; 117  10 for OEA, P > 0.05)
between the vehicle- and OEA-treated rats. These data indicated that
OEA treatment did not inﬂuence the glia cell generation after
ischemic stroke.

To investigate whether chronic OEA treatment is able to
promote hippocampal neuroplasticity, we assessed the expression
of GAP-43 and SYP, two major proteins implicated in neuroplasticity. The results showed that GAP-43 and SYP proteins expression
were signiﬁcantly decreased in the injured hippocampus in the
vehicle-treated rats compared with the sham-operated rats. In
contrast, OEA treatment exhibited a robust increase in the
expression of GAP-43 by 46% and SYP by 33%, respectively
(Fig. 6C). The data indicated that OEA treatment enhanced
hippocampal neuroplasticity.
3.6. Hippocampal neurogenesis was essential for OEA-improved
spatial cognitive deﬁcits
To conﬁrm whether there is a direct connection between the
effects of OEA treatment on spatial cognitive recovery and
hippocampal neurogenesis after stroke. AZT was used to disrupt
neurogenesis during the period of OEA treatment. Rats treated
with OEA combined with AZT, the number of BrdU+ cells in the DG
of the injured hemispheres was signiﬁcantly decreased compared
with the rats treated with OEA alone (OEA: 1158  59.03,
AZT + OEA: 594  61.50, P < 0.01; Fig. 7B), suggesting that AZT

OEA treatment. In the probe trails, the swimming traces of OEAtreated rats were concentrated in the target zone. However, the
swimming traces of vehicle- and AZT/OEA-treated rats were
uniformly distributed around the four zones (Fig. 7A). These results
suggest that AZT abolished the protective effects of OEA against
spatial cognitive impairment. Thus, OEA promotes spatial cognitive
recovery after stroke in an adult neurogenesis-dependent way.
4. OEA inhibited PARP-1 activity and promoted the expression
of BDNF and PPARa
BDNF is closely associated with neurogenesis. Previous studies
have reported that BDNF-mediated pathways are involved in cell
survival and plasticity [21]. For this reason, we further explored
whether OEA treatment could trigger BDNF expression. The results
showed that the expression of the BDNF was not signiﬁcantly
increased in the vehicle-treated rats. In contrast, OEA treatment
increased the levels of the BDNF by 29.44% compared with the
vehicle-treated rats (P < 0.05, Fig. 8B-a and b). OEA is a highafﬁnity endogenous PPARa agonist. In our study, no obvious

277

changes in the expression of PPARa were observed between the
vehicle-treated and sham-operated groups. However, OEA treatment increased the levels of PPARa by 55.23% (P < 0.01, Fig. 8B-a
and c). Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) belongs to the
PARP nuclear enzyme superfamily, and plays a pivotal role in the
repair of single strand breaks of DNA [22]. It has been
demonstrated that activation of PARP-1 is a harmful event during
cerebral ischemia. In the present study, we evaluated the
inhibition of PARP-1 activity in the case of human recombinant
PARP-1. Our results showed that 3-AB and OEA inhibited PARP-1
activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8A). The IC50 values of
3-AB and OEA were 14.58 mM and 16.71 mM, respectively.
Meanwhile, the expression of PARP-1 increased after cerebral
ischemia, OEA treatment reduced the level of PARP-1 by 40.36%
compared with vehicle group (P < 0.01, Fig. 8B-a and d) (Fig. 9).
5. Discussion
Our previous study veriﬁed the positive effects of OEA in acute
cerebral ischemic injury [15]. In the present study we reported that
chronic OEA treatment reversed spatial cognitive impairment and

consequently promoted neurogenesis and neuroplasticity in the
DG after focal cerebral ischemia.
Ischemic stroke has a complex pathophysiology involving the
interplay of many cells and tissues, such as neurons, glia,
endothelium, and the immune system in general. The middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats not only causes infarctions
in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex, caudate nucleus, and lenticular
nucleus, but also causes secondary retrograde degeneration in the
hippocampus [23,24]. The mechanisms of secondary damage,
remote from the infarction, may be associated with factors of
axonal retrograde degeneration, neurotrophic disturbance, existence of neural growth inhibitory factors, decreased focal cerebral
blood ﬂow, disequilibrium of neurotransmitter adjustment, and
inhibition of protein synthesis [25,26]. The hippocampus is closely
associated with the process of learning and memory. Therefore,
delayed neuronal death in the hippocampus caused by MCAO leads
to neurological deﬁcits, e.g., cognitive impairment and inhibition of
synaptic transmission. The neuroprotective effects of OEA have been
carefully described by several groups [11–14]. Additionally, our
previous study demonstrated that OEA treatment reduced the
volume of brain infarcts, alleviated brain edema, and improved
neurological outcome in the acute stage of ischemic stroke
[15]. There have been a large number of studies focused on the
protective effects of OEA, but little is known about the effects of OEA
on the recovery period from cerebral ischemia, especially cognitive
functions and hippocampal neurogenesis.

This study was conducted to analyze whether and how OEA
induces long-lasting brain protection. In the present study,
transient MCAO was used as a model to induce ischemia and
reperfusion insults for examining the neuroprotective effects of
OEA during the chronic phase of stroke. Because ischemia-induced
damage in the hippocampus is generally considered responsible
for the profound impairment of spatial memory tasks, we then
used the MWM, which is the most sensitive behavioral task
available to measure such damage [17]. In accordance with
previous studies [27–29], our results showed that the escape
latency of the vehicle-treated rats was signiﬁcantly longer than
that of sham-operated animals, whereas the swim speed was not
altered. These data indicate that the increase in escape latency is
not a result of a motor impairment but rather reﬂects deﬁcits in
spatial orientation. The spatial bias of vehicle-treated rats is
conﬁrmed by the reduction in the time spent in the target quadrant
and the number of crossings of the platform position in the probe
trail. Interestingly, our results demonstrated that treatment with
OEA lead to a marked decrease in deﬁcits in spatial learning ability
induced by MCAO, which were revealed by a reduction in escape
latency during task acquisition in OEA-treated rats for 4 weeks.
OEA reduced the spatial memory deﬁcits induced by ischemia, as
indicated by the increased time spent in the target quadrant and
the number of rats crossing the platform position. These results
suggested that OEA treatment attenuated learning and memory
impairment caused by MCAO.

Learning and memory are associated with changes in the
efﬁcacy of synaptic neurotransmission [30]. LTP of synaptic
transmission is one of the functional indexes of synaptic plasticity,
which is a widely accepted model for learning and memory at the
cellular level [31]. Ischemia can inhibit synaptic transmission by
preventing the production and storage of neurotransmitters
[32]. The present results showed that LTP was inhibited in the
vehicle group compared with that in the sham-operated group,
which is in agreement with a previous study [33]. OEA treatment
can modulate the PP-DG synapse in rats with focal cerebral
ischemia induced by MCAO. Administration of OEA for 4 weeks
abolished the inhibition of LTP in rats with ischemia, indicating
that OEA could facilitate the efﬁciency of synaptic transmission. In
the present study, the MWM and LTP tests were chosen as markers
for the evaluating OEA on rat brain function after MCAO. Our data
indicated that chronic OEA treatment attenuated the damage of
hippocampus after focal cerebral ischemia.
To explore the underlying mechanism of OEA on improving
cognitive deﬁcits and enhancing LTP after stroke, we detected the
effects of OEA on hippocampal neurogenesis and neuroplasticity.
Previous studies have demonstrated that transient cerebral
ischemic injury stimulates neurogenesis in the DG of adult rodents
[34,35]. Neurogenesis plays an important role in functional
recovery after cerebral ischemia. Enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis promotes spatial memory recovery after stroke [36], while
inhibiting hippocampal neurogenesis exacerbates ischemia-induced cognitive impairment [37]. Therefore, increasing hippocampal neurogenesis after stroke is a new strategy for the amelioration
of post-stroke cognitive deﬁcits. BrdU is an analog of thymidine
and can be incorporated into DNA of cells during S phase and thus
has been used to investigate cell proliferation. In the present study,
we found that there were more BrdU+ cells in the DG of injured
hemispheres 14 days after MCAO. These data showed that the focal
cerebral ischemia could induce endogenous neuronal stem/
progenitor cells proliferation. OEA treatment for 1 week signiﬁcantly increased the number of BrdU+ cells, suggesting that this
chemical compound could promote basal neurogenesis after
ischemia in rats.
Newborn cells can be supplied from the SGZ in the post-stroke
brain. However, simple proliferation of progenitor cells does not
guarantee successful recovery from functional impairment. To
become a therapeutic strategy for stroke, neurogenesis and selfrepair has to be optimized to improve the poor survival of newborn

neurons [38]. Our data show that OEA treatment for 4 weeks
promoted the survival of newborn cells and most of these newborn
cells matured into neurons in the DG. The newborn cells generated
from the DG develop into granule neurons and are capable of
extending axonal projections to the CA3 area and integrating into
functional circuits [39]. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is
involved in learning acquisition and long-term memory formation
[40]. These data suggest that hippocampal neurogenesis may play
a vital role in OEA-induced spatial cognitive improvement after
cerebral ischemia. To further conﬁrm the role of hippocampal
neurogenesis in the effects of OEA treatment on spatial cognitive
performance after ischemic stroke, AZT was used to disrupt
neurogenesis during the period of OEA treatment. The results
showed that when the negative action of AZT neutralized the
increased neurogenesis by OEA treatment, the beneﬁcial effects of
OEA on spatial cognitive impairment disappeared. Taken together,
our results indicate that hippocampal neurogenesis is required for
the beneﬁcial effect of OEA on ischemia-induced spatial cognitive
deﬁcits.
Learning and memory are important aspects of cognitive
function, and synaptic plasticity is also associated with this progress
[41]. To better decipher the effects of OEA on improving cognitive
deﬁcits after ischemic-stroke, we assessed the effect of chronic OEA
treatment on neuroplasticity. GAP-43 is an intracellular growth
protein playing an important role in the regulation of neurite
outgrowth, growth cone guidance and synaptic plasticity [42]. By
blocking GAP-43 expression with antisense oligonucleotide probes,
neurite outgrowth can be eliminated in the cultured neurons.
Additionally, GAP-43 plays a vital role in the conservation
mechanism of LTP [43]. SYP is a presynaptic vesicle protein having
a critical role in synaptogenesis and synapse function [41]. The level
of SYP protein usually reﬂects the synaptic numbers and density.
Our data demonstrate a signiﬁcant decrease in GAP-43 and SYP
levels in the hippocampus 42 days after MCAO. This suggests that
these changes are likely to be involved in cognitive deﬁcits and LTP
impairment after stroke. However, OEA treatment signiﬁcantly
increased in the expression of both GAP-43 and SYP. These results
suggest that the presence of hippocampal axonal outgrowth and the
new hippocampal axonal circuit were enhanced by OEA treatment
after cerebral ischemia. Supporting data from neurogenesis and
neuroplasticity showed that 28 days of OEA treatment and another
7 days of drug withdrawal restored impaired spatial cognitive
performance and LTP after ischemic-stroke.

To investigate the further mechanism of OEA on improving
cognitive functions and hippocampal neurogenesis, we detected
PARP-1 activity and BDNF as well as PPARa expression after OEA
treatment. BDNF is an important neurotrophic factor that has
multiple effects on neurogenesis. BDNF enhances neurogenesis
and strengthens the migration of new neurons in the DG [44]. BDNF
also plays a critical role in synaptic transmission and plasticity
[45]. BDNF increases the expression of synaptic vesicle proteins
such as synaptophysin [46]. GAP-43 is upregulated in granule cells
following BDNF treatment [47]. Additionally, BDNF deﬁciency
exhibited impaired induction of LTP, resulting in large deﬁcits in
presynaptic function [48]. Meanwhile, our results indicated that
BNDF levels were signiﬁcant increased by OEA treatment.
Considering that BDNF plays an important role in neurogenesis,
neuroplasticity, and LTP formation and OEA promotes the
expression of BDNF, the modulatory effects of OEA on neurogenesis
after cerebral ischemia may be associated with BDNF. PPARa is a
nuclear receptor belonging to the ligand-activated factor PPAR
family. PPARa is expressed by neurons in many brain regions
including the hippocampus [49]. It was reported that Fenoﬁbrate,
another PPARa agonist, prevents the deleterious effects of wholebrain irradiation on hippocampal neurogenesis in a PPARadependent manner [50]. A recent study demonstrated that PPARa
agonist administration signiﬁcantly increased proliferation of cells
colabeled by BrdU and PPARa in the striatum and the cortex after
focal cerebral ischemia [51]. Another recent study also indicated
that PPARa activation could improve memory impairments and
hippocampal neurogenesis after globe cerebral ischemia [52]. Taken together, these studies suggest that there is a close relationship
between PPARa and neurogenesis. In the present study, PPARa
expression was increased after OEA treatment. Combining with the
previous reports [50,51,53], our results suggested that OEA
treatment might rely on up-regulating PPARa expression to
promote hippocampal neurogenesis. Excessive activation of PARP1 is involved in the progression of neuronal damage after cerebral
ischemia. Previous reports have demonstrated that PARP-1
inhibitors protect neuronal cells, improve cognition and enhance
long-term neuronal survival and hippocampal neurogenesis after
stroke [54–57]. In the present study, we investigated the effects of
OEA on PARP-1 inhibition. The extent of PARP-1 inhibition by OEA
is similar to 3-AB, a classical PARP-1 inhibitor. Meanwhile, a
marked increase of Cleaved PARP-1 in the hippocampus was
observed after cerebral ischemia. In contrast, OEA treatment
inhibited PARP-1 expression after ischemia. These data suggested
that neuroprotective effects of OEA on the recovery period from
cerebral ischemia may be involved in inhibitory activity of PARP-1.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that chronic OEA
treatment attenuates ischemic stroke-induced spatial cognitive
deﬁcits and promotes neurogenesis as well as neuroplasticity in the
ischemic hippocampus. Moreover, our data suggest that hippocampal neurogenesis is necessary for the effects of OEA on spatial
cognitive performance after MCAO. OEA may be a promising
neuronal protective agent for the treatment ischemic stroke.
