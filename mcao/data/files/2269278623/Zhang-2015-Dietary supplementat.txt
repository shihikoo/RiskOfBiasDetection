Stroke is a devastating neurological disease with no satisfactory therapies to preserve long-term neurological
function, perhaps due to the sole emphasis on neuronal survival in most preclinical studies. Recent studies
have revealed the importance of protecting multiple cell types in the injured brain, such as oligodendrocytes
and components of the neurovascular unit, before long-lasting recovery of function can be achieved. For example,
revascularization in the ischemic penumbra is critical to provide various neurotrophic factors that enhance the
survival and activity of neurons and other progenitor cells, such as oligodendrocyte precursor cells. In the present
study, we hypothesized that chronic dietary supplementation with ﬁsh oil promotes post-stroke angiogenesis,
neurogenesis, and oligodendrogenesis, thereby leading to long-term functional improvements. Mice received
dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFA-enriched ﬁsh oil for three months before and up to one month after
stroke. As expected, dietary n-3 PUFAs signiﬁcantly increased levels of n-3 PUFAs in the brain and improved
long-term behavioral outcomes after cerebral ischemia. n-3 PUFAs also robustly improved revascularization
and angiogenesis and boosted the survival of NeuN/BrdU labeled newborn neurons up to 35 days after stroke injury. Furthermore, these pro-neurogenic effects were accompanied by robust oligodendrogenesis. Thus, this is
the ﬁrst study to demonstrate that chronic dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs is an effective prophylactic measure not
only to protect against ischemic injury for the long term but also to actively promote neurovascular restorative
dynamics and brain repair.

Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of adult disability worldwide
(Demaerschalk et al., 2010). Indeed, more than 50% of its survivors suffer from long-lasting debilitation (Wiltrout et al., 2007). Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only FDA-approved therapy for stroke
victims. However, clinical use of tPA is severely limited by its short temporal window of application (B. Zhang et al., 2011). Finding alternative
therapies that are safe to administer as long-term prophylactic measures is therefore a matter of urgency in stroke research. Although
many previous studies have shown that the adult brain has the ability
to try and repair itself in response to ischemic insults, there are no
safe, effective therapies that boost these endogenous repair mechanisms and thereby prevent stroke-induced neurological deﬁcits. Thus,
neurorestorative therapies that promote cerebral brain repair and neurological recovery post-ischemia have gained increasing attention in recent years (Hermann and Chopp, 2012; X. Liu et al., 2014; McLaughlin
and Gidday, 2013).

W. Zhang et al. / Experimental Neurology 272 (2015) 170–180

One candidate that may possess neurorestorative properties is the
administration of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), a
major component of dietary ﬁsh oil. n-3 PUFAs are widely known for
their critical role in neurodevelopment (Harris and Baack, 2015). Excessive consumption of n-6 PUFAs relative to n-3 PUFAs is thought to contribute to the higher incidence of stroke in Westernized nations
(Simopoulos, 2002). In contrast, high levels of n-3 PUFAs are known
to protect against ischemic brain damage in multiple animal models
(Wang et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2010). However,
the underlying mechanisms are not yet well-established. Multiple
mechanisms have been proposed to mediate neuroprotection by n-3
PUFAs, including the activation of pro-survival signaling cascades in
neurons, blunting of microglia-mediated inﬂammatory responses (Hu
et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2010), and suppression of oxidative stress
(Begum et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014). The beneﬁcial effects of n-3
PUFAs have been conﬁrmed in fat-1 transgenic mice expressing the
C. elegans fat-1 gene, which encodes an n-3 fatty acid desaturase that
converts endogenous n-6 PUFAs into n-3 PUFAs. Our previous work
has shown that overproduction of n-3 PUFAs in fat-1 transgenic mice
enhances angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and oligodendrogenesis following cerebral ischemia (Hu et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014). However, dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFAs is more clinically relevant and
whether it can promote brain repair and long-term recovery of neurological function is not yet known.
In the present study we tested the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFAs would promote revascularization,
neurogenesis, and oligodendrogenesis after stroke, thereby providing
long-term neurobehavioral protection. Revascularization is one of the
most effective endogenous repair mechanisms in the brain after stroke
injury and illustrates the importance of a patent vascular network
(Badaut and Bix, 2014; Li et al., 2014). Revascularization not only consists of reperfusion of pre-existing vasculature in the early phase after
stroke but also consists of a surge in angiogenesis through endothelial
cell proliferation in late stages (J. Liu et al., 2014). Post-stroke angiogenesis increases tissue perfusion with nutrients and oxygen while newly
generated endothelial cells release a plethora of neurotrophic factors,
thereby supporting the survival of neurons, oligodendrocytes, and
their progenitor cells, and accelerating long-term recovery of neurological function (An et al., 2014; Merson and Bourne, 2014). In the past
several decades, adult neurogenesis has been demonstrated in the
subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle and the subgranular
layer of the dentate gyrus. Neurogenesis can occur in response to cerebral ischemia and is characterized by the migration of SVZ-derived neural precursor cells along the blood vessels to the site of ischemic lesion
(Ruan et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2009). However, only a small proportion
of these neural precursor cells survive and differentiate into mature
neurons. Oligodendrocytes, the myelin forming cells of the central nervous system, are also sensitive to cerebral ischemia (Zhang et al., 2013).
Stroke induces the loss of oligodendrocytes and elicits disruption of myelin, which impair axonal conductivity and exacerbate functional outcomes (Zhang et al., 2013). Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are
known to differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes and form myelin
sheaths for sprouting axons during brain repair, an important prerequisite for recovery of neurological function (Misumi et al., 2013; R.L.
Zhang et al., 2011). Hence, ﬁnding therapies that can safely boost
these endogenous repair processes would greatly facilitate the clinical
treatment of stroke victims. It would also beneﬁt future stroke victims
if such therapies could be administered prophylactically for the long
term as a preventative measure. To accomplish this goal, n-3 PUFAs
were administered through dietary intake of ﬁsh oil for three months
before and up to one month after stroke injury in the present study.
Here we show that chronic dietary administration of n-3 PUFAs robustly protects the adult brain against focal cerebral ischemia up to
35 days post injury. Furthermore, n-3 PUFAs signiﬁcantly enhanced
post-stroke angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and oligodendrogenesis. Thus,
oral administration of n-3 PUFA-enriched ﬁsh oil is a promising

171

preventative measure with the capacity to improve natural brain repair
processes and facilitate long-term recovery of neurological function.
Material and methods
Dietary supplementation with ﬁsh oil
All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and
Use Committee at Fudan University. Four-week-old male C57BL/6J mice
(Laboratory Animal LLC, Shanghai, China) were either fed a regular
laboratory rodent diet with an inherently low n-3 PUFA concentration (0.5%) or the same diet supplemented with n-3 PUFAs
(docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids, triple strength n-3 ﬁsh
oil, Puritan's Pride, Oakdale, NY, USA; ﬁnal n-3 PUFA concentration
4%) for 3 months before exposure to transient cerebral ischemia and
up to 35 days after ischemia until sacriﬁce.
Transient focal cerebral ischemia model
Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in adult male mice
(4 months old, 25–30 g) by intraluminal occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) for 60 min, as described previously (Wang et al.,
2014). Experimental procedures were performed following the Stroke
Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) guidelines (Fisher
et al., 2009). Mice were anesthetized with 3% isoﬂurane vaporized in
30% O2/70%N2 until they were unresponsive to the tail pinch test.
Animals were then ﬁtted with a nose cone blowing 1.5% isoﬂurane for
anesthesia maintenance. A monoﬁlament (7-0) with a silicone-coated
tip was introduced into the common carotid artery, advanced to the origin of the MCA, and left in place for 60 min. Rectal temperature was
maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C during surgery with a temperaturecontrolled heating pad. Arterial blood gases were analyzed at 15 min
after the onset of ischemia and 15 min after reperfusion. Regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) was measured using laser speckle during the entire procedure. Animals that did not show an rCBF reduction of at least
75% of the baseline levels or that died after ischemia induction were excluded from further experimentation. Sham-operated mice underwent
the same anesthesia and surgical procedures without MCA occlusion
(MCAO).
Laser speckle imaging
Animals were anesthetized with 1.5% isoﬂurane. A midline incision
was made on the scalp, and tissues were removed with a scalpel to expose the skull surface. All procedures were performed using sterile technique. Laser speckle images (696 × 512 pixels) were acquired at 23 fps
(exposure time T = 5 ms) by the laser speckle imaging system (Dolphin
BioTech Ltd., Shanghai, China) with a laser diode (780 nm; Dolphin
BioTech Ltd., Shanghai, China) placed over the skull (Miao et al.,
2010). Brieﬂy, 200 consecutive frames of speckle images were recorded
per trial. Image processing took place off-line with MATLAB software
(Mathworks Co., Ltd., USA). Raw speckle images were processed by
the random process estimator (RPE) method after registration to obtain
the contrast image. Changes in cerebral blood ﬂow and the ischemic
area were calculated by MATLAB software.
Measurement of infarct volume
Fourty-eight hours after MCAO, TTC staining was performed by a
blinded investigator as we described previously (Stetler et al., 2008).
Brieﬂy, mice were anesthetized with 3% isoﬂurane and sacriﬁced.
Brains were harvested and the forebrain was sliced into seven 1-mmthick coronal sections. Sections were then stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) in saline at pH 7.4 (37 ± 0.5 °C)
for 20 min, and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for
30 min before photography. Infarct volume was determined using the

172

W. Zhang et al. / Experimental Neurology 272 (2015) 170–180

ImageJ software. To minimize the effect of edema on the measurement
of infarct size, the hemispheric infarct area in each section was calculated by subtracting the area of normal, TTC-stained brain in the ipsilateral
ischemic hemisphere from the contralateral nonischemic area. Infarct
volume was then calculated by summing the infarct areas over all sections and multiplied by the slice thickness.
Assessment of neurological functions
Neurological tests were performed 1 day before and 1–21 days after
ischemia. Sensorimotor deﬁcits were assessed by the Rotarod, pole, and
cylinder tests. The Rotarod test was performed as described previously
(Wang et al., 2014). Brieﬂy, mice were placed on a rotating drum accelerating from 4 to 40 rpm over 300 s. The latency to fall off the drum was
then recorded. Preoperative training was performed for 3 days in 3 trials
per day, with the last 3 trials serving as preoperative baseline. Postoperative tests were performed every two days for 14 days in 3 trials per day.
The pole test was performed as described previously (Balkaya et al.,
2013). Brieﬂy, the mouse was placed face forward on the top of a vertical steel pole (height: 50 cm, diameter: 0.9 cm), which was covered
with tape to create a rough surface. The latency to turn downward
and the total time to reach the bottom of the cage with its front paws
were recorded 4 times per day. Preoperative training was performed
for 3 days in 4 trials per day. Postoperative tests were performed every
other day for two weeks following surgery. The cylinder test was performed to assess asymmetries in forepaw use. The mouse was placed
in a transparent cylinder (height: 15 cm, diameter: 9 cm) and
videotaped for 5 min. Forepaw use during the ﬁrst contact against the
cylinder wall after rearing was then recorded. Forepaw preference was
expressed as the relative proportion of right forepaw contacts, and calculated as follows: (left − right) / (left + right + both) × 100%. Neurological function tests were always performed by investigators blinded to
experimental groups. Each neurobehavioral test was conducted on at
least 8 animals per group.
BrdU labeling of proliferating cells
The S-phase marker 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was used to
label recently proliferated cells. BrdU (50 mg/kg body weight, SigmaAldrich) was injected intraperitoneally daily for 3–14 days after
surgery. Animals were subsequently deeply anesthetized and
transcardially perfused with 0.9% NaCl followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer. Brains were then sequentially cryoprotected
in 20% and 30% sucrose, and frozen serial coronal brain sections
(25 μm) were prepared on a cryostat (Leica, Bensheim, Germany). Sections were pretreated with 2 N HCl for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by 0.1 M
boric acid (pH 8.5) for 10 min at room temperature. Sections were
then blocked with the M.O.M. kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA), followed by incubation with mouse anti-BrdU antibody (1:1000, BD bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature and overnight at
4 °C. After a series of washes, sections were incubated in 594 or
488-AfﬁniPure goat anti-mouse IgGs (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature.

Lipid extraction and fatty acid analysis
Cortices were fast frozen and dried into powder in a vacuum freeze
dryer until subjected to analysis. Fatty acids were extracted as described
previously (Zhang et al., 2010). Fatty acid composition was determined
by capillary gas chromatography using a Clarus 500 Gas Chomatograph
(Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Tissue fatty acid methyl
ester peak identiﬁcation was performed by comparison to the peak retention times of a 30-component methyl ester standard (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, Missouri, USA). The concentration of each fatty acid was determined by calculating peak areas. Five animals were analyzed in each
group.
Immunohistochemical staining
Immunohistochemical staining was performed on 25 μm-thick freeﬂoating sections. Brieﬂy, coronal brain sections were blocked with 5%
goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton-X 100 for
1 h, followed by primary antibody incubations for 1 h at room temperature and overnight incubation at 4 °C. Mature neurons were visualized
using anti-NeuN (1:1000; Millipore, Billerica, MA). After a series of
washes, sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with
goat antirabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with DyLight 594
(1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Sections were
mounted and coverslipped with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech,
Birmingham, AL, USA). Immature neural progenitor cells were visualized using anti-doublecortin (DCX, 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA) followed by Cy3-conjugated secondary IgG antibody
(1:1000; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Myelin and abnormally dephosphorylated neuroﬁlaments were visualized with anti-myelin
basic protein (MBP, 1:500; Abcam) and anti-SMI32 (1:1000; Millipore,
Billerica, MA), respectively. OPCs were visualized with anti-NG2
(1:500; Millipore, Billerica, MA). Fluorescence images were captured
by a blinded observer as described above.
Western blot
Protein isolation from brain tissues was performed as described previously (Stetler et al., 2008). Western blot was performed using the
standard SDS-PAGE method. PVDF membranes were blocked by 5%
non-fat dried milk in TBS-T (10 mM Tris–HCl, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1%
Tween) at room temperature for 1 h. Then membranes were incubated
with rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against angiopoietin 1
(1:500, Abcam), angiopoietin 2 (1:500, Abcam), meteorin (1:500,
R&D) and mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (1:1500, SigmaAldrich) overnight at 4 °C. Chemiluminescence was detected with a
luminescence detection system (Pierce, Rockford, USA) and semiquantitatively analyzed by Quantity One 4.5.2 software (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, USA). Data were quantiﬁed from 4 animals per group.
Statistical analysis
All data are reported as the mean ± SEM. Signiﬁcant differences between means were assessed by ANOVA and post hoc Scheffe tests for
multiple comparisons, unless otherwise indicated.

Vascular labeling and analysis of vascular density
Results
Lectin was applied as described previously (Wang et al., 2014). Briefly, animals were transcardially perfused 5 min before euthanasia with
biotin-conjugated tomato lectin (Vector labs, Burlingame, USA) at a
dose of 1.25 mg/kg body weight. Coronal brain sections were prepared
and incubated with FITC–streptavidin secondary antibodies to stain perfused vessels. Four sections at 0.1 mm intervals were analyzed in each
brain. The vascular surface area (mm2) and the total vascular length
(mm) per volume of tissue (mm3) were calculated using ImageJ
software by a blinded observer.

Chronic administration of ﬁsh oil increases n-3 PUFAs in the brain
Fatty acids were analyzed in the forebrains of n-3 PUFAsupplemented (N3 high or N3H) and control diet-fed (N3 low or N3L)
mice using gas chromatography 3 months after the onset of the change
in diet. As shown in Fig. S1A, no signiﬁcant difference was detected between N3H and N3L mice in the proportions of total saturated fatty
acids and mono-unsaturated fatty acids. In contrast, the n-3 PUFA

W. Zhang et al. / Experimental Neurology 272 (2015) 170–180

fraction from N3H mice was signiﬁcantly elevated relative to N3L mice,
whereas the n-6 PUFA fraction was profoundly decreased, leading to an
overall increase in the n-3/n-6 ratio (Fig. S1B). Three major n-3 fatty
acids, including EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid, C20:5), DPA
(docosapentaenoic acid, C22:5) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid,
C22:6) were all signiﬁcantly increased in N3H mice compared to N3L
mice (Fig. S1C). Two major n-6 fatty acids, LA (linoleic acid, C18:3)
and AA (arachidonic acid, C20:4) were signiﬁcantly decreased in N3H
mice compared to N3L mice, with a concomitant increase in DPA
(docosapentaenoic acid, C22:5, n-6) (Fig. S1D). These results demonstrate that dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs is an effective means of increasing the n-3/n-6 ratio in the brain.

n-3 PUFAs reduce infarct volumes without affecting regional cerebral
blood ﬂow
To determine the neuroprotective effect of n-3 PUFAs, adult male
mice from both groups were subjected to MCAO and sacriﬁced 48 h
later. As shown in Fig. 1, N3H mice developed a signiﬁcantly smaller infarct volume than N3L mice (Fig. 1B–D). Furthermore, the 7 day survival
rate of N3H mice was approximately 13% higher than N3L mice
(Fig. 1A). To rule out the possibility that protection was associated
with differences in regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF), we monitored
rCBF using laser speckle imaging before and after the onset of MCAO
as well as 10 min after reperfusion. As shown in Fig. S2, no signiﬁcant
difference in rCBF was detected in the ipsilateral hemisphere between
N3H and N3L mice. The area of the ischemic core (rCBF reduction N 70%
of baseline values) and ischemic penumbra (30% b rCBF b 50% of baseline values) was measured in the ipsilateral hemisphere and found to
be equivalent in N3H and N3L mice (Fig. S2C, p = 0.08 for core and
p = 0.46 for penumbra by two-way ANOVA, n = 9 per group). Furthermore, no signiﬁcant alterations in arterial blood pressures or blood

173

gases were found during MCAO (data not shown). These ﬁndings demonstrate that n-3 PUFAs protect against cerebral ischemia entirely independent of changes in rCBF during ischemia or other physiological
variables that are known to affect stroke outcome.
n-3 PUFAs improve neurological function and confer long-term
neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia
To investigate the impact of n-3 PUFAs on neurobehavioral outcomes after stroke, three independent measures of neurological function – the cylinder, Rotarod and pole tests – were performed up to
21 days following the ischemic insult. Animals with sham operations
displayed similar neurobehavioral performance regardless of group
(Fig. 2). After ischemia, N3L and N3H mice both showed spontaneous
recovery in sensorimotor function during the 2–21 days of reperfusion.
However, neurological outcomes were signiﬁcantly better in N3H mice
compare to control mice, according to all three behavioral tests. Thus,
n-3 PUFAs robustly improve long-term sensorimotor function after
cerebral ischemia.
n-3 PUFAs enhance post-ischemia revascularization in the
ischemic penumbra
Previous studies suggest that long-term neuroprotective effects of
n-3 PUFAs are associated with angiogenesis and neovascularization
(Wang et al., 2014). To determine whether n-3 PUFAs enhance angiogenesis following ischemia, we examined revascularization in the ischemic penumbra (Fig. 3A), a region with active vascular remodeling
during the post-ischemia recovery stage. The number of functional vessels was decreased 1 day after MCAO, as shown by reductions in ﬂuorescent lectin signal (Fig. 3B–C). Revascularization developed gradually
during the 35 days following transient ischemia in both groups.

However, vascular length and surface area were both signiﬁcantly increased by n-3 PUFAs (Fig. 3D–E). There was no difference in vasculature in sham-injured N3H and N3L animals (Fig. 3C–E). To further
determine the effect of n-3 PUFAs on angiogenesis, we calculated the

number of BrdU+ cells in functional vessels 7 to 35 days after stroke
(Fig. 4A). Spontaneous recovery of vasculature was signiﬁcantly enhanced by n-3 PUFAs (Fig. 4A–B). Only a few BrdU+ cells were present
in vessels of non-injured sham animals from both N3H and N3L groups.

Our previous study on fat-1 mice suggested that n-3 PUFAs promote
brain repair by stimulating endogenous cerebral angiogenesis after
ischemia (Wang et al., 2014). To identify the molecular mechanism underlying the angiogenic effect of n-3 PUFAs, we compared the expression of three proteins essential for angiogenesis, angiopoietin 1 (Ang
1), Ang 2, and meteorin, at 7 and 14 days after ischemia. Ang 1 is
known to recruit and sustain periendothelial support cells. Ang 2, a natural Ang 1 antagonist, induces the destabilization required for additional vessel sprouting after ischemia (Qin et al., 2013). Cooperation
between VEGF and Ang 2 is also known to enhance vessel maturation
and vascular remodeling (Brudno et al., 2013). As expected, we observed pronounced elevations in Ang 1 in the ipsilateral hemisphere
after transient cerebral ischemia (Fig. 4C–D). Although Ang 1 may play
an essential role in angiogenesis after ischemia, it is not likely to be sufﬁcient to support extensive angiogenesis under normal conditions. Furthermore, decreases in Ang 2 after MCAO in control mice may actively
inhibit angiogenesis (Fig. 4D). However, n-3 PUFAs robustly stimulated
the expression of both Ang 1 and Ang 2, which may help accelerate
angiogenesis following stroke. Although n-3 PUFAs also appeared to
increase meteorin 7 days after ischemia, no signiﬁcant differences
were detected between N3H and N3L groups.
n-3 PUFAs stimulate neurogenesis following cerebral ischemia
Neurogenesis induced by ischemic injury involves the proliferation
of neural stem cells, migration of neuroblasts towards the ischemic
area, and differentiation of neural progenitor cells. Sufﬁcient blood
ﬂow is critical for supporting the migration of neuroblasts to the ischemic penumbra and for their subsequent maturation (Iwai et al., 2002).

To determine the role of revascularization on neuroblast migration,
we stained for DCX, a marker of immature neural progenitor cells, in
lectin-perfused brains. The number of migrating neuroblasts was significantly higher in N3H mice, and these neuroblasts were found within
migratory paths along lectin-stained blood vessels approaching the
ischemic area (Fig. 5A–B). These results indicate that n-3 PUFAs
improve the migration and survival of neuroblasts.
The SVZ is a critical source of neurogenesis in the adult brain. However, no signiﬁcant differences between N3H and N3L mice were detected in SVZ DCX+ cells (data not shown). Neuroblasts are known to
mature and integrate into parenchymal tissue after migration is complete (Chu et al., 2012). Therefore, we performed BrdU and NeuN double
staining to determine the effect of n-3 PUFAs on the maturation of
newly generated neural precursor cells (NPCs) after ischemia. In the ischemic cortex and striatum, SVZ-derived mature neurons were detected in N3H mice, whereas very few neuroblasts and mature neurons
survived in N3L brains up to 35 days after ischemic injury (Fig. 5C–E).
n-3 PUFAs enhance oligodendrogenesis and white matter recovery
White matter injury is an important component of brain damage
after stroke and detrimental to the normal electrophysiological communication between brain regions (Mifsud et al., 2014). OPCs are present in
the adult brain, and provide the opportunity for oligodendrocyte replenishment after injury. To characterize the effect of n-3 PUFAs on
oligodendrogenesis after cerebral ischemia, we investigated the proliferation of OPCs in the striatum and corpus callosum (Fig. 6A) by double
labeling for BrdU and NG2. n-3 PUFAs exerted no signiﬁcant impact on
the survival and proliferation of NG2 cells under sham physiological

conditions (Fig. 6B–C). However, cerebral ischemia activated NG2 cells,
so that they acquired an amoeboid shape and developed stout processes. Furthermore, there was a dramatic decrease in NG2 cell numbers in
the penumbra at 35 days after ischemia. The proliferation of BrdU+/
NG2+ OPCs was not able to fully compensate for the loss of OPCs in
post-stroke N3L mice. However, n-3 PUFAs signiﬁcantly enhanced the
proliferation of NG2 cells and helped preserve the number of OPCs at
35 days after stroke injury (Fig. 6B–C).
Remyelination of axons is essential for the recovery of neurological
function after ischemia. To characterize the effect of n-3 PUFAs on
white matter recovery, two markers were used: MBP (a marker of mature oligodendrocytes) and SMI32 (a marker of nonphosphorylated
neuroﬁlaments) (Thangavel et al., 2009). The SMI32/MBP ratio in the
ipsilateral hemisphere was then compared with that of the contralateral
hemisphere. Almost all axons in the striatum and corpus callosum are
myelinated under normal conditions and little SMI32 signal was present
in sham-operated animals (Fig. 7A). Stroke led to oligodendrocyte injury and progressive demyelination of axons, as shown by increased
SMI32 staining and decreased MBP staining in the striatum and corpus
callosum (Fig. 7A). As a result, the SMI32/MBP ratio dramatically increased in N3L mice starting at 3 days after transient ischemia, and continued up to 35 days post-ischemia (Fig. 7B). n-3 PUFAs signiﬁcantly
preserved myelin in the striatum and corpus callosum of N3H mice at
3–35 days after ischemia, as reﬂected by more MBP and reduced
SMI32 staining compared to N3L mice. The SMI32/MBP ratio was reduced 3–35 days after ischemia by n-3 PUFAs (Fig. 7B). Unlike the striatum and corpus callosum, high SMI32 staining (shown as red signal) in
the cortex of sham animals indicates that the about one half of axons in

this region are unmyelinated under normal conditions (Schirmer et al.,
2011). Transient ischemia reduced both MBP and SMI32 staining in the
cortex, indicating the post-ischemic loss of both axons and myelin in
control N3L mice (Fig. 7). In N3H mice, both cortical axons and myelin
were preserved by n-3 PUFA treatment (Fig. 7A and C). These data suggest that endogenous proliferation of OPCs after stroke is not sufﬁcient
to repair severe white matter damage in control N3L mice. However,
n-3 PUFAs signiﬁcantly preserved myelin integrity and promoted
oligodendrogenesis, thereby facilitating the recovery of white matter
after ischemia.
Discussion
The present study is the ﬁrst report to provide direct evidence that
dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFAs promotes long-term neurological recovery up to 21 days after ischemia. n-3 PUFAs also robustly
promote post-stroke revascularization and boost endogenous angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and oligodendrogenesis. Thus, prophylactic supplementation with n-3 PUFAs is a highly promising neuroprotective
strategy for ischemic stroke.
The brain is enriched in long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially DHA, relative to many other tissues (Lauritzen et al., 2001). Due to
deﬁciencies in Δ-12 and Δ-15 desaturases, mammalian organisms depend predominantly on dietary sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids.
Epidemiological observations have suggested that lower n-3 PUFA intake increases the risk of many neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and ischemic stroke (He et al., 2002; Mohajeri
et al., 2015; Mozaffarian et al., 2005). Excessive consumption of n-6

PUFAs contributes to an elevation in the n-6/n-3 ratio, leading to poor
neural development and lack of functional recovery after damage
(King et al., 2006). In the present study, dietary supplementation with
n-3 enriched ﬁsh oil increased DHA levels in the brains of adult mice,
whereas the major n-6 PUFAs, linoleic acid and arachidonic acid, were
greatly decreased, leading to a net elevation in the n-3/n-6 ratio. Our results therefore demonstrate that dietary supplementation with n-3
PUFAs can indeed impact cerebral fatty acid content in adulthood.
Consistent with previous research on fat-1 transgenic mice, dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFAs protected against cerebral ischemia not
only in the acute phase (within 48 h) after reperfusion but also in the
delayed phase (up to 35 days), as manifested by reductions in infarct
volume and improvements in neurological functions. Thus, the present
study strongly supports the hypothesis that prophylactic supplementation with n-3 PUFAs is an effective strategy to enhance functional recovery and promote long-lasting rehabilitation following stroke.
n-3 PUFAs possess a unique ability to modulate capillary integrity
and neovascularization in the retina (SanGiovanni and Chew, 2005).
In the present study, n-3 PUFAs exerted no signiﬁcant effect on cortical
blood ﬂow during ischemia and after reperfusion. Nevertheless, the
density of lectin perfused cerebral microvessels was signiﬁcantly higher
in the N3H group than the N3L group within 24 h after ischemia.
Post-stroke vascular remodeling consists of revascularization of preexisting vasculature at early phase, and neovascularization through
angiogenesis at chronic phase (J. Liu et al., 2014). Our data revealed
that n-3 PUFA supplementation improved post-stroke revascularization, starting as early as 1 day after MCAO when much less amounts of
functional (lectin perfused) microvessels could be detected in the N3L

groups (Fig. 3). This rapid revascularization in n-3 PUFA-treated brain
was likely due to reopening of pre-existing microvasculature rather
than increased generation of new vessels. n-3 PUFAs preserved the integrity of blood vessels, possibly supporting the survival of endothelial
cells during ischemia and reperfusion. Although our studies are consistent with many reports of the stimulatory effects of n-3 PUFAs on angiogenesis, n-3 PUFAs are nevertheless able to suppress tumor vasculature
formation through multiple mechanisms, including a decrease in VEGF
(Matesanz et al., 2010), PDGF (Basak et al., 2013), and MMPs (Tsuzuki
et al., 2007). These results suggest that the impact of n-3 PUFAs on microvasculature may be disease- and context-dependent. In the context
of cardiovascular disease, DHA and EPA may reduce the production of
VEGF to suppress endothelial wound repair (Zhuang et al., 2013). However, in fat-1 mice, we recently demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs induce the
production of Ang 2 in astrocytes to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation after stroke (Wang et al., 2014).
Angiopoietins are a family of growth factors that regulate the formation and function of the vascular system (Augustin et al., 2009). Ang 1
facilitates angiogenesis by acting on the endothelial cell-speciﬁc tyrosine kinase receptor Tie2 (Zacharek et al., 2007). n-3 PUFAs robustly increased the expression of Ang 1 in the present study, which is likely to
have stimulated post-stroke angiogenesis. Ang 1 can also work directly
on neurons to support neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis (Chen
et al., 2009; Kosacka et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2010), suggesting that
n-3 PUFAs may boost neurogenesis through Ang 1.
Ang 2 was initially described as an endogenous antagonist of Ang
1 at the Tie2 receptor, which disrupts blood vessel formation in Ang
2-overexpressing embryos (Qin et al., 2013). Ang 2 treatment alone

does not increase microvessel density in vivo, but it is essential for
vessel destabilization during post-ischemic angiogenesis and sensitizes
endothelial cells to VEGF-mediated angiogenesis (Zhu et al., 2005). We
discovered that ischemia-induced downregulation of Ang 2 was reversed by n-3 PUFAs. This effect may work in concert with VEGF to stimulate endothelial proliferation (Wang et al., 2014).
Meteorin is a newly identiﬁed neurotrophic factor involved in cerebral angiogenesis and developmental maturation (Park et al., 2008). Although n-3 PUFAs did not signiﬁcantly increase meteorin levels 7 days
after ischemia, we cannot rule out its role in the recovery process. An increase in meteorin is known to occur in neural progenitor cells during
the early phases of stroke, and may promote neurogenesis in the SVZ
and neuroblast migration towards the ischemic striatum (Wang et al.,
2012).
Stroke induces the proliferation and migration of NSC/NPCs in the
SVZ. Revascularization is critical for the migration of immature
neuroblasts and important for adequate blood ﬂow and nutrition
(Ohab et al., 2006; Thored et al., 2007). However, most of the newly
generated neurons are known to die shortly after stroke. Indeed, less
than 20% of new neurons in the ischemic striatum survive longer than
2 weeks and only a very small proportion eventually replace the lost
mature neurons (Ohab et al., 2006). n-3 PUFAs not only increased the
survival of immature neurons (DCX+ cells) along the perfused vessel
walls but also promoted their maturation in cortical parenchyma up to
35 days after stroke injury. These ﬁndings support the hypothesis that
neurogenesis is enhanced after stroke injury by dietary ﬁsh oil supplementation. One limitation of the current study for using BrdU to label
newly proliferated cells is that BrdU may cause random mutations to

cells and label dying cells as well (Duque and Rakic, 2011). Although
this effect of BrdU labeling has not been reported in rodents so far, it
should be taken into consideration in our data interpretation.
Regenerated axons must be adequately myelinated for full restoration of neurological function after ischemic stroke (Franklin and
Kotter, 2008). However, oligodendrocytes are exquisitely sensitive to ischemia and new OPCs therefore have to proliferate to repair the ischemic brain. Consistent with our previous ﬁndings in fat-1 mice, we
discovered that n-3 PUFAs may improve the proliferation of OPCs after
ischemic stroke, thereby facilitating axonal repair. In concert with the
improvements in angiogenesis and neurogenesis, the rescue of OPCs
by n-3 PUFAs is expected to improve long-term neurological performance after cerebral ischemia.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that chronic administration of
ﬁsh oil elevates cerebral n-3 PUFA content and confers long-lasting neurological and histological protection against ischemic brain damage.
One of the major novel ﬁndings of the present study is that dietary supplementation with ﬁsh oil not only reduces ischemic brain injury but
also actively promotes brain repair. n-3 PUFAs may achieve this goal
by promoting the revascularization of the brain after stroke and
boosting neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis. The advantage of dietary supplementation with nontoxic n-3 PUFAs over riskier treatments
such as tPA is evident. Thus, considered together with a vast body of literature on ﬁsh oil, our studies place n-3 PUFAs in the unique position of
being a natural, safe treatment that can be readily administered as a
prophylaxis for long periods. Further studies on the mechanisms underlying n-PUFA-induced neurogenesis, oligodendrogenesis, and revascularization are highly warranted. Studies to investigate whether late

W. Zhang et al. / Experimental Neurology 272 (2015) 170–180

administration of n-3 PUFAs after the onset of stroke injury is also therapeutic are also currently underway in our laboratory. Altogether, these
studies may reveal ﬁsh oil to be a versatile treatment for two separate
clinical populations: individuals at risk for stroke and individuals with
a recent history of stroke.
