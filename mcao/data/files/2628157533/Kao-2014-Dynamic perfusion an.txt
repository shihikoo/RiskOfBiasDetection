Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) is known to exacerbate ischemic damage, as the number of CSDs correlates with the ﬁnal infarct volumes and suppressing CSDs improves functional outcomes. To investigate the role
of CSD in ischemic damage, we developed a novel rat model of photothrombotic ischemia using a miniature implantable optic ﬁber that allows lesion induction inside the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. We were
able to precisely control the location and the size of the ischemic lesion, and continuously monitor dynamic perfusion and diffusion MRI signal changes at high temporal resolution before, during and after the onset of focal ischemia. Our model showed that apparent diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC) and cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) in the
ischemic core dropped immediately after lesion onset by 20 ± 6 and 41 ± 23%, respectively, and continually declined over the next 5 h. Meanwhile, CSDs were observed in all animals (n = 36) and displayed either a transient
decrease of ADC by 17 ± 3% or an increase of CBF by 104 ± 15%. All CSDs were initiated from the rim of the ischemic core, propagated outward, and conﬁned to the ipsilesional cortex. Additionally, we demonstrated that
by controlling the size of perfusion–diffusion mismatch (which approximates the penumbra) in our model, the
number of CSDs correlated with the mismatch area rather than the ﬁnal infarct volume. This study introduces
a novel platform to study CSDs in real-time with high reproducibility using MRI.

Introduction
Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) describes a near-complete
cell membrane depolarization and transient depression of neuronal activity due to ionic imbalance from the dysfunction of sodium and
calcium pumps (Dreier, 2011). It features a slow change in electrical potential (propagating at a rate of 2–6 mm/min) accompanied by

morphological and cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) changes (Ayata, 2013;
Takano et al., 2007). Spreading CBF elevation caused by CSD is generally
greater than 100% of the basal ﬂow due to the high energy demand required to restore ionic gradients. In ischemic stroke, spontaneous CSD
typically initiates in the ischemic penumbra and therefore is also termed
peri-infarct spreading depolarization (Fabricius et al., 2006). In addition
to CBF elevation, spreading ischemia superimposed on a low perfusion
level also appears in the penumbra (Shin et al., 2006). These inverse hemodynamic responses indicate the prolonged overload of calcium in tissue at risk and eventually lead to neuronal and glial necrosis (Dreier,
2011).
CSD-targeted therapy has the potential to reduce infarct expansion
and ameliorate ischemic damage (Dreier, 2011), as it has been shown
that CSD causes a step-wise expansion of the ischemic core in both animal models and humans (Nakamura et al., 2010; Takano et al., 1996),
and both CSD frequency and occurring duration are correlated with
the ﬁnal infarct size (Dijkhuizen et al., 1999; Takano et al., 1996). Recently, a multimodal device combining laser speckle imaging (LSI) and
RGB reﬂectometry (RGBR) with position emission tomography (PET)

was established to simultaneously study the dynamic change of
CBF, blood oxygen and glucose metabolism during CSDs (Gramer
et al., 2014), with a goal to better understand neurovascular and
neurometabolic coupling responding to CSDs. Despite tremendous research efforts being made by using optical imaging (Shin et al., 2006)
and electrophysiology (Nakamura et al., 2010; Takano et al., 2007),
the spatiotemporal characteristics and occurrence rate of CSDs under
different ischemic conditions remain largely unexplored. Perfusion
and diffusion MRI are both useful and practical imaging modalities for
stroke research by virtue of their sensitivity to probe tissue status and
widespread availability. With only a few exceptions (Rother et al.,
1996; Takano et al., 1996; D'Arceuil and de Crespigny, 2011), CSD in ischemic stroke has not been systemically studied by MRI since: 1) CSDs
appear almost immediately after ischemic lesion onset and it is difﬁcult
to induce experimental ischemia during MRI scans, and 2) conventional
MRI methods may not have sufﬁcient spatiotemporal resolution to capture CSDs.
To this end, the present study was designed to: 1) establish a novel
model that generates highly controllable ischemic lesions during MRI
scans, 2) capture the entire spatiotemporal evolution using high resolution perfusion and diffusion MRI, and 3) probe CSDs under different
ischemic conditions. Traditional photothrombosis has been used to produce focal ischemia by illuminating the brain tissue after injecting a
photosensitive dye, rose bengal (Watson et al., 1985). In response to a
speciﬁc wavelength of light, rose bengal generates reactive oxygen species, focally damaging vascular endothelium, driving a vascular plugging
through platelet-mediated coagulation (Watson et al., 1985). Unlike
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) models, this model produces
highly reproducible ischemic lesions with smaller penumbra, early vascular edema and rapid ischemic cell death (Howells et al., 2010). We
attempted to take the advantage of its rapid progression so that the entire episode of CSDs in the hyperacute phase of ischemic lesion can be
continuously monitored by MRI. Although photothrombosis may not
mimic the evolution of clinical stroke, this method is particularly suitable for studying CSDs and CSD-targeted therapy due to its high reproducibility (Risher et al., 2010; Wester et al., 1995). Photothrombotic
models have never been practiced inside the MR scanner, likely due to
the complex optical setup for light focusing, alignment and potential
susceptibility artifacts when exposing the cortex (Watson et al., 1985).
In this study, we aimed to tackle these technical obstacles by using
a novel miniature MR-compatible optical ﬁber system to induce
photothrombotic ischemia during MRI scans and test an important hypothesis that the size of perfusion–diffusion mismatch (Reid et al.,
2012; Shen et al., 2003) (which approximates the penumbra) can be
manipulated by changing the lesion induction parameters. Additionally,
the experimental procedure developed in this study can induce an ischemic lesion in any assigned brain area, which also opens up new opportunities for studying the behavioral and functional plasticity changes
when ischemic lesion appears in the brain regions that were previously
inaccessible in animal models.

Methods
Subjects
Forty adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (weighing 250–400 g;
Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were used in this study.
In brief, four animals were used to conﬁrm that laser illumination
alone or rose bengal injection alone (n = 2 in each subgroup) does
not create ischemic lesions, thirty animals were used for the remaining
studies using different ischemic lesion induction parameters, and the
other six animals were used to measure CSDs with continuous perfusion
or diffusion MRI. Rats were individually housed in cages with food and
water available ad libitum and 12:12 h day–night cycles with control
of humidity and temperature.

Ethics statement
All studies reported followed the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Animal Research (Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals) as well as the ARRIVE (Animal
Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) guidelines. The experiments
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
the University of North Carolina. The manuscript was written in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines.
Animal preparation
Optical ﬁber implantation was performed at least 24 h prior to the
photothrombotic lesion. All subjects were anesthetized with ketamine–
xylazine (60 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, respectively) and placed in a stereotactic frame (Model 962, Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) for craniotomy. A
small burr hole was drilled on the skull (1.0 mm posterior and 4.0 mm
lateral to bregma) and the dura was removed. An optical ﬁber (ID =
0.2 mm, BFL37-2000, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) with a ceramic zirconia ferrule (MM-FER2007C-2300, Precision Fiber Products, Milpitas, CA) was
implanted above the primary somatosensory cortex of forelimb (S1ﬂ).
The ﬁber was secured to the skull surface with a MR-compatible brass
screw (#94070A031, McMaster-Carr, Elmhurst, IL) and dental cement.
Rectal temperature was maintained at 37 °C using a heating pad. Physiological parameters including heart rate and blood oxygen saturation
level were continuously monitored using a pulse oximeter (MouseOx
Plus, STARR Life Science Corp., Oakmont, PA) and kept within normal
ranges during surgery (heart rate of 350–400 bpm and oxygen saturation above 95%). During the postoperative period, rats were given topical
antiseptics and lidocaine at the surgical site.
Ischemic lesion induction
On the day of MRI experiments, rats were endotracheally intubated
and ventilated with ~1.5% isoﬂurane anesthesia mixed with medical air.
The femoral vein was cannulated for drug injection. Paralysis was then
achieved using pancuronium bromide (0.1 mg/kg/h, i.v. infusion).
After the animal was ﬁxed on the head holder with ear-bars and a
tooth-bar, an 8-m patch cable made in-house with an optical ﬁber
(INFINICOR300, Fine Instrument Sales, Oriskany, NY) terminated with
a ceramic zirconia ferrule connector (MM-FER2007C-1270, Precision
Fiber Products, Milpitas, CA) was secured to the rat's cranial implant
with a ﬁtted ceramic split sleeve (SM-CS125S, Precision Fiber Products,
Milpitas, CA). The other end of the cable was connected to a 532 nm
green light laser (GL532T3-200, Shanghai Laser & Optics Century Co,
Shanghai, China) by FC MM ferrule assembly (MM-CON2004, Precision
Fiber Products, Milpitas, CA). Heart rate and blood oxygen saturation
level were continuously monitored by a pulse oximeter and maintained
within normal ranges as described above. Capnometry and rectal temperature probes were also used to monitor essential physiological
parameters during MRI. Ventilation rate and volume were adjusted
to maintain stable end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) within a range of 2.6–3.2%
via a capnometer (Surgivet, Smith Medical, Waukesha, WI). EtCO2
values from our experimental setup were previously calibrated against
invasive sampling of arterial blood gas, reﬂecting a pCO2 level of
30–40 mm Hg (Shih et al., 2012). The water temperature of a circulating
pad was adjusted to maintain body temperature at 37 °C.
Ischemic lesions were generated by using the guided green light
laser in rats receiving i.v. rose bengal (Watson et al., 1985). Rose bengal
injection was performed 1 min after laser onset and fully infused within
2 min. Laser illumination or rose bengal injection alone was performed
to conﬁrm the mechanism of lesion generation (n = 2 in each subgroup). Five groups of animals were used to study the effect of changing
induction parameters. Group 1 used standard induction parameters:
10 mg/kg rose bengal with 10 mW laser illuminated for 10 min
(n = 8). While keeping the rest of the parameters ﬁxed, Group 2 used

Y.-C.J. Kao et al. / Neurobiology of Disease 71 (2014) 131–139

20 mg/kg rose bengal (n = 6), Group 3 used 20 mW laser (n = 5),
Group 4 used 30 mW laser (n = 5), and Group 5 used 20 min illumination time (n = 6). In a subgroup of animals in Group 1 (n = 2), the
brains were carefully extracted and 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride
(TTC) staining was performed at 24 h after lesion induction to compare
with T2-weighted MRI data (Shen et al., 2003).
MRI experiments
MRI was performed using a 9.4 Tesla Bruker BioSpec system with a
BGA-9S gradient insert (Bruker Corp., Billerica, MA) at UNC Biomedical
Research Imaging Center. A home-made surface coil with an active
decoupling circuit (internal diameter = 2.0 cm) placed directly over
the head was used as a transceiver and a separate butterﬂy-shaped
coil underneath the neck was used for continuous arterial spin labeling
(CASL). Magnetic ﬁeld homogeneity was optimized using standard
FASTMAP shimming with ﬁrst order shims on an isotropic voxel of
9 × 9 × 9 mm encompassing the imaging slices. A RARE T2-weighted
pilot image was taken in the mid-sagittal plane to localize the anatomical position by identifying the anterior commissure at −0.36 mm posterior to bregma (Paxinos and Watson, 2005).
An interleaved perfusion and diffusion MRI acquisition that
switched imaging modality every 2.5 min was performed for 6 h including 40 min baseline before lesion induction (all the animals in Groups
1–5, n = 30). CBF was measured by a validated CASL technique (Shih
et al., in press) using the single shot gradient-echo echo-planar imaging
(EPI) with bandwidth = 250 kHz, TR/TE = 3000/12 ms, labeling
duration = 2.4 s and post-labeling delay = 250 ms, matrix = 96 ×
96, FOV = 2.56 × 2.56 cm, 8 slices, and slice thickness = 1 mm. To
generate ADC maps (a sensitive measure of the ischemic core)
(Hoehn-Berlage, 1995) diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) were acquired with the same geometry using the single shot spin-echo EPI
with bandwidth = 250 kHz, TR/TE = 3000/30 ms, δ/Δ = 4/12 ms, number of b0 = 1, number of directions = 3 and b-value = 1200 s/mm2. In a
separate group of animals, a continuous perfusion or diffusion MRI acquisition for 1 h including 20 min baseline was performed to monitor
CSDs after lesion in real time (n = 6). T2-weighted anatomical images
were acquired at 24 h using a RARE sequence with spectral width =
47 kHz, TR/TE = 2500/33 ms, FOV = 1.96 × 1.96 cm, 8 slices, slice thickness = 1 mm, matrix = 256 × 256, RARE factor = 8, and number of averages = 12.

ipsilesional cortex and corresponding regions in the contralesional cortex. These ROIs were used to reveal ADC and CBF temporal evolution before, during and after lesion onset. To extract deﬁcit volumes, ADC and
CBF thresholds of 0.6 μm2/ms and 0.4 ml/g/min were used respectively.
These thresholds were selected based on the values from the published
literature (Bardutzky et al., 2005; Shen et al., 2003) and corresponded to
22 ± 3% reduction of baseline ADC and 57 ± 10% reduction of baseline
CBF under our experimental condition. The ﬁnal infarct volume was delineated by using hyper-intense signals (≥2 SD of contralateral normal
cortical tissue) in 24 h T2-weighted images (Bouts et al., 2013, 2014).
Additionally, the threshold of 10% ADC decrease or 100% CBF increase
from baseline was applied to extract signiﬁcant ADC and CBF alterations
during CSDs. These thresholds were derived from values in published literature (Dietrich et al., 1994; Rother et al., 1996). All threshold-deﬁned
results were visually veriﬁed by two experienced investigators (Y.C.J.K.,
PhD and W.L., MD) blinded to the experimental groups.
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (IBM SPSS
statistics 21, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). One-way ANOVA followed by
Tukey's HSD post hoc test was performed to evaluate 1) signiﬁcant
changes of the ratio of ADC, CBF deﬁcit or mismatch volume to ﬁnal infarct volume every 30 min and 2) signiﬁcant changes of lesion volumes

Data processing and analysis
Image analysis was performed using SPM and a custom-written program in Matlab (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA) (Shih et al., 2008). Skull
stripping was performed manually with a threshold method. Automatic
co-registration using SPM codes was applied to correct slight image drift
overtime within subjects. Of note, no false movement was observed
after registration. Additionally, although the surface coil causes B1
inhomogeneity, this was empirically not corrected since it does not
display a signiﬁcant effect when imaging the rat cortex (Lai et al., in
press, 2014b; Shih et al., 2013a, in press). CBF was calculated as: CBF
= (λ/T1)(SC − SL) / (SL + (2α − 1)Sc), where SC and SL are the MR signal intensities from the control and labeled images, respectively. λ is the
water brain–blood partition coefﬁcient, T1 is that of tissue, and α is the
arterial spin-labeling efﬁciency. The values of λ, T1, and α were 0.9
(Herscovitch and Raichle, 1985), 1.9 s (de Graaf et al., 2006),
and 0.7 (Shih et al., 2011), respectively. Pairwise subtraction was
ﬁrst performed between the control and labeled images, followed by a
subsequent pairwise subtraction between the current labeled image
and the next control. ADC maps were calculated by using: ADC =
ln(S0/S1) / (b1 − b0), where S1 is the signal intensity obtained with b1
(1200 s/mm2) and S0 is the signal intensity obtained with b0 (0 s/mm2).
Regions of interest (ROIs) of 5 × 5 pixels were placed in the laser target region (α), peri-infarct tissue (β) and normal tissue (γ and δ) in the

and the number of CSDs among groups. Non-parametric correlation
tests were performed to detect signiﬁcant correlations between lesion
volume and the number of CSDs. A two tailed paired t-test was used
to compare ADC or CBF signals at a particular time point to the average
value during 285 to 300 min after ischemia to reveal whether the signal
reduction had reached to a steady state. Signiﬁcant changes of ADC or
CBF signals at a particular time point were assessed by a two tailed
paired t-test in the bilateral ischemia experiments (compared within
animals) and by independent t-test in the unilateral ischemia experiments (compared across animals). The signiﬁcant level was set at
P b 0.05. All data in text are presented as mean ± SD.
Results
Heart rate, EtCO2, oxygen saturation and body temperature did not
show observable changes during ischemic lesion induction and CSD
events. Fig. 1A shows a typical photothrombotic lesion in the laser target
region by T2-weighted imaging at 24 h after ischemia, with a ﬁnal infarct
volume conﬁrmed by TTC staining on the same animal. This modiﬁed
photothrombotic model generates a minimal MR susceptibility artifact
by the addition of dental cement and toothpaste around the optical
ﬁber (see also Fig. 2 acquired by EPI). Neither laser illumination nor
rose bengal alone induced observable lesions on T2-weighted images
(Figs. 1B and C). The ischemic lesions can be induced in any assigned
brain area by varying the placement of optical ﬁbers (Fig. 1D). Realtime changes of T2-weighted images, DWI, ADC and CBF data from lesion onset toward 5 h post-ischemia were collected by an interleaved
perfusion–diffusion MRI acquisition and displayed in Movie 1.
In Group 1 (10 mg/kg rose bengal, 10 mW laser for 10 min, n = 8),
the ADC and CBF in the laser target region dropped to 0.62 ±

0.01 mm2/s (20 ± 6% from the baseline) and 0.50 ± 0.06 ml/g/min
(41 ± 23% from the baseline) within 10 min after laser illumination,
respectively, and then continually declined. The CBF reached a
steady level (0.19 ± 0.06 ml/g/min, 75 ± 14% from the baseline) at
80 min (P b 0.05), faster than the ADC, which did not become
stable (0.49 ± 0.10 mm2/s, 38 ± 11% from the baseline) until 130 min
(P b 0.05) (Figs. 2A and D). While ADC signal remained normal outside
the target region after ischemia, CBF in both ipsi- and contra-lesional
cortices decreased signiﬁcantly from the baseline at 15 min after ischemia and did not fully recover in the following 5 h (P b 0.05, Fig. 2D). In
addition, CBF in the caudate putamen (CPu) in both hemispheres
decreased signiﬁcantly from the baseline at 25 min after laser illumination (P b 0.05, Fig. 2D insets or Supplementary Fig. 1) and gradually recovered after 55 min. Under these induction parameters, infarct size at
24 h was 13.47 ± 5.66 mm3 as deﬁned by T2-weighted images.
In a separate group of rats lesioned by the same parameters
(10 mg/kg rose bengal, 10 mW laser for 10 min, n = 6), diffusion or perfusion data were acquired continuously to visualize CSDs at high temporal resolution (12 s in ADC and 3 s in CBF) (Movies 2 and 3). Real-time
diffusion and perfusion data depicted CSDs as either a 17 ± 3% decrease
in ADC (Fig. 2B) or a 104 ± 15% increase in CBF (Fig. 2E). In addition to
the laser target region, propagation of CSDs could be visualized in the
adjacent cortical regions in the same hemisphere with an estimated velocity of ~2 mm/min. The CSDs initiated around the ischemic lesion induction site, propagated outward, vanished upon reaching the corpus
callosum, and were conﬁned to the ipsilesional cortex (Figs. 2C and F).
Similar spreading patterns were observed across all slices either anterior or posterior to the bregma (Movies 2 and 3). In the peri-infarct tissue,
basal ADC signal continuously decreased during CSD wave passage
(Fig. 2B, ROI β). In some animals, the terminal depolarization originated

300 min after lesion onset from the same group of animals (n = 8). ROIs were placed in the laser target region (α), the normal tissue in the ipsilesional cortex (β) and the contralesional
cortex (contra-α). The time-series images on the horizontal axis are the corresponding ADC and CBF maps every 40 min. The error bars are s.e.m. * indicates a signiﬁcant difference from
values at 285 to 300 min (P b 0.05). In separate animals, continuous ADC data with 12 s temporal resolution (B) or CBF data with 3 s temporal resolution (E) were acquired during lesion
onset. Time course in the laser target region (α), peri-infarct tissue (β) and normal tissue (γ and δ) in the ipsi-lesional and corresponding location in the contra-lesional hemisphere were
analyzed. Note that panels B and E were data from two different representative animals. The CSD (arrowhead) in the laser target region followed by a long-lasting signal reduction indicates the terminal depolarization.

period. Color-coded time series ADC images (C) and CBF images (F) during a single CSD session from the respective animal.

from the core (Figs. 2B and E, arrowhead in ROI α) induced sustained
ADC or CBF reduction, and propagated to the peri-infarct tissue.
Together with Group 1, an average of 4.20 ± 1.55 (n = 14) CSDs was
found during the ﬁrst 30 min after lesion onset. Under this induction parameter, CSDs were rarely observed after 30 min (0.18 ± 0.40).
Compared to Group 1, faster ADC and CBF reductions (signal reached
steady state at 100 min, P b 0.05) were observed in Group 2 using a
higher rose bengal dose (20 mg/kg) (Fig. 3A). In Groups 3, 4 and 5,
both cortices were simultaneously lesioned by two optical ﬁbers.
While the left cortex served as an internal control (10 mW laser for
10 min), the effects of elevating laser power (20 and 30 mW for 10
min in Groups 3 and 4, respectively) and prolonged laser illumination
period (10 mW for 20 min in Group 5) were evaluated in the right
cortex. In both Groups 3 and 4, the ADC and CBF signals dropped to
the steady state within 5 min (P b 0.05) (Figs. 3B and C). In Groups 2,
3 and 4, ADC and CBF reductions within 30 min after ischemia were
signiﬁcantly compared to Group 1 or the animal's internal control hemisphere, indicating the augmentation of rose bengal dose and laser
power exacerbate ischemic severity. In contrast, no signiﬁcant ADC

135

and CBF changes compared to the internal control were observed in
Group 5 when laser illumination period was extended to 20 min
(Fig. 3D).
As no signiﬁcant difference in ADC, CBF deﬁcit, CSD numbers, and
ﬁnal infarct volume was observed among Group 1 and all the internal
control cortices in Groups 2–5 (P N 0.05), the statistical comparison
was performed among groups. In average, 22.99 ± 9.21% of the ﬁnal infarct volume was attributed from the ADC deﬁcit during the ﬁrst 30 min
after lesion onset and increased to 62.39 ± 18.10% at 3 h after onset, indicating the signiﬁcant changes of ischemic core in the hyperacute
phase in this model (F5,174 = 6.745, P b 0.001). The ratio of ADC deﬁcit
to the ﬁnal infarct volume during the ﬁrst 30 min after lesion onset
was signiﬁcantly smaller (P b 0.05) than that after 60 min (Fig. 4A).
The ratio of CBF deﬁcit to the ﬁnal infarct volume increased after
30 min, showing a signiﬁcant change between 60 and 90 min
(99.09 ± 45.62%) (P b 0.05) and was gradually restored by 3 h
(80.55 ± 34.45%) (Fig. 4B). Although a trend of mismatch volume was
observed, no signiﬁcant change was detected (Fig. 4C), likely due to
small sample size (n = 8 in Group 1) and the number of time points

bengal with 10 mW laser for 20 min, n = 6) (D). Interleaved ADC and CBF data were acquired every other 2.5 min. The ﬁnal infarct volume with different induction parameters is
shown by the T2-weighted images at 24 h in the right panel. The error bars are s.e.m.

was signiﬁcantly smaller (P b 0.05) than that in Groups 2, 3 and 4
(Fig. 5C). The total number of CSDs was signiﬁcantly correlated with
the perfusion–diffusion mismatch volume (r = 0.548, P b 0.05)
(Fig. 5D). No signiﬁcant correlation (P N 0.05) was observed between
the number of CSDs, ADC and CBF deﬁcit areas, and ﬁnal infarct volume.

tested as dependent variable in ANOVA. During the ﬁrst 30 min after
lesion onset, Group 4 (30 mW) showed signiﬁcantly more CSDs, larger
areas with ADC and CBF deﬁcits, and larger perfusion–diffusion mismatch volume (P b 0.05) compared to Group 1 (10 mW) (Figs. 5A and
B). Additionally, while CSDs seldom appeared after 30 min in Groups
1, 2 and 3, CSDs could be detected between 30 and 60 min in Groups

The current study demonstrates that CSD-induced ADC and CBF
changes could be detected by MRI after focal ischemia. To visualize
CSDs during ischemic lesion onset and the hyperacute phase, we developed a model of photothrombotic ischemia that allows lesion induction
inside the MR scanner. Although CSDs were not measured electrophysiologically, the features of MR-measured CSDs including the frequency,
duration and the pattern of spreading hyperemia are in line with the results shown by optical imaging and electrophysiology (Dietrich et al.,
1994; Schroeter et al., 1995). Increasing ADC deﬁcit volume during the
ﬁrst 30 min to 3 h after lesion onset was detected by MRI, suggesting
that a detectable ischemic penumbra very likely exists in the hyperacute
phase of our model. By modulating induction parameters, the lesion severity (as indicated by CBF and ADC changes in the hyperacute phase),
perfusion–diffusion mismatch, ﬁnal infarct volume, and the number of
CSDs can be manipulated. In this model, the number of CSDs correlated
to the perfusion–diffusion mismatch in the hyperacute phase rather
than the ﬁnal infarct volume.
CSD is known to arise immediately after ischemic lesion onset and
occur repeatedly as the ischemic core gradually expands into the periinfarct tissue (Dreier, 2011; Nakamura et al., 2010; Takano et al.,
1996). Due to the fast lesion evolution in rodents, inducing stroke outside the MRI will miss the critical period in the hyperacute phase,
which is essential to obtain a more complete picture of CSD effects. Inbore stroke induction has been performed previously by a modiﬁed
occluder for MCAO in rats (Li et al., 1998; Rother et al., 1996). However,
despite the widespread use of MCAO in animal model of stroke, the surgical procedure is technically challenging and the success rate, lesion
volume, and location highly depend on the experience of the surgeons
(Li et al., 1998). In contrast, photothrombotic ischemia is known for its
high reproducibility and well-controlled lesion size (Howells et al.,
2010). In this study, to adopt this model for in-bore MR applications,
we modiﬁed the complex non-MR compatible optic assemblies and
tackled the problems of MR susceptibility artifacts by a miniature optical
ﬁber (Sparta et al., 2012) and a long patch cable to permit light delivery
from outside the scanner room to the target brain region. This development provides a useful tool to study ischemia in real time and allows

ischemic lesion to be created in any assigned deep brain areas simply by
performing regular stereotactic brain surgery. As growing numbers of
studies have selected photothrombotic model to investigate functional
reorganization after ischemia, our animal model may prove useful to
investigate functional plasticity changes in previously inaccessible
brain regions.
The conventional MCAO model reduces ADC by ~ 30% and CBF
by ~57% (generally b0.2 ml/g/min) in the ischemic core after occlusion
(Hoehn-Berlage et al., 1995b; Shen et al., 2003). Our in-bore photothrombotic model showed comparable reductions of ADC by 38 ±
11% and CBF by 73 ± 17% (dropped to 0.19 ± 0.06 ml/g/min). In addition, we also demonstrated that the ADC deﬁcit volume continuously increased from the lesion onset to ~3 h, indicating the growing volume of
ischemic core in this model. As the ischemic core deﬁned by ADC deﬁcit
volume continuously increased after lesion onset, CBF deﬁcit volume
similarly increased within the ﬁrst 90 min after lesion induction. This
could be due to the progression of ischemic core to the peri-infarct tissue up to 60 min (Paul et al., 2006) or post-ischemic oligemia (Jones
et al., 2008).
In the MCAO model, efforts have been made to approximate ischemic penumbra using the perfusion–diffusion mismatch by MRI (Reid
et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2003). There is a general consensus that this
measure might be relatively challenging in photothrombotic ischemia.
To address whether the perfusion–diffusion mismatch volume can be
controlled by photothrombosis, we modiﬁed the induction parameters
and sought to manipulate lesion severity. We observed signiﬁcant effects of rose bengal dosage and laser power on the ﬁnal infarct volume.
Doubling the rose bengal dose resulted in a signiﬁcantly larger infarct
volume (Group 2). This was expected because higher rose bengal dose
induces more reactive oxygen species, stimulates endothelial cells and
promotes platelet aggregation that could affect downstream areas
(Watson et al., 1985). Elevating laser power in Groups 3 and 4 (20 and
30 mW, respectively) also signiﬁcantly increased the ﬁnal infarct volumes. This could be attributed to increased laser penetration and thus
increased the volume of illuminated tissue. We suspected that the
number of CSDs did not increase in Groups 2 and 3 because there are
no signiﬁcant changes in mismatch volumes as compared to Group 1.
Interestingly, the number of CSDs increased signiﬁcantly in Group 4
(~1.9 fold), in which a larger mismatch volume (~3.1 fold) was created
compared to Group 1. In addition, rather than the ﬁnal infarct volume,
the perfusion–diffusion mismatch volume is signiﬁcantly correlated
with the number of CSDs. This implies that the frequency of CSD in
the hyperacute phase of ischemia might be associated with the penumbra size. We also demonstrated that there are no signiﬁcant changes in
lesion size, ADC, CBF time courses and mismatch volume in Group 5
with a prolonged laser illumination period to 20 min. As the dye is rapidly cleared from circulation by the liver within 10 min (Boquillon et al.,
1992), the prolongation of illumination may not alter lesion characteristics unless rose bengal is continuously delivered throughout the illumination period. On a separate note, although the photothrombotic model
usually creates a small penumbra, an anatomically predeﬁned penumbra can be created by using a ring-shape laser pattern (Wester et al.,
1995). This procedure requires exposure of a large cortical area to
laser illumination and therefore was not considered in the present
study due to potential susceptibility artifacts.
During CSDs, persistent cation inﬂux results in intracellular
hyperosmolarity and cell swelling (Takano et al., 2007). The reduction
in the net displacement of diffused water molecules in the extracellular
space could decrease ADC values (Moseley et al., 1991). Previous studies
using MR diffusion reporter molecules also demonstrated a signiﬁcant
decrease of intracellular ADC after stroke (Ackerman and Neil, 2010).
With topical KCl application or in MCAO, ADC decreased by 35% and
30% during CSDs in the rat cortex, respectively (Latour et al., 1994;
Rother et al., 1996). In this study, a transient ADC decrease by 17 ± 3%
was observed during CSDs. The relative smaller ADC decline here may
be affected by a small ROI size and potential partial volume effect. In

137

addition, as ADC reﬂects slow diffusion associated with Brownian motion of water molecules at the cellular level as well as fast diffusion of
capillary perfusion (Koh et al., 2011), hyperemia during CSDs observed
in our study may increase ADC value. Future studies using perfusioninsensitive ADC imaging with optimal b-values would be favorable
(Freiman et al., 2012).
We report a 104 ± 15% increase of CBF during CSDs in this study.
This value is in accordance with the pronounced hyperemia observed
in KCl- and endothelin 1 (ET-1)-induced CSDs (150 and 177%, respectively) (Dreier et al., 2002). CSD has been shown to elicit glycolysis
pathway by depleting tissue oxygenation or elevating Ca2+ concentration in neurons and astrocytes. These processes trigger the production
of vasodilators, such as nitric oxide and/or arachidonic acid, eventually
resulting in vasodilation (Dreier, 2011; Gordon et al., 2008). We also observed a step-wise decrease of basal CBF during the hyperemia passage
(Fig. 2E, ROI β). This biphasic perfusion change, namely hyperemia
followed by hypoperfusion, has been demonstrated around the ischemic core in rats and cats, suggesting the impaired neurovascular coupling at infarct border (Nakamura et al., 2010). The small CBF peaks
during hyperemia accompanied by gradually decreased basal CBF in
the peri-infarct tissue (Fig. 2E, ROI β) suggested that the pre-CSD
basal CBF might affect CBF augmentation during CSDs. This has similarly
been demonstrated by Feuerstein et al. showing a high correlation between pre-CSD regional CBF level and the slope of CSD onset in rats
that underwent MCAO (Feuerstein et al., 2014). In addition to spreading
hyperemia, spreading ischemia has also been observed in the ischemic
penumbra in rats that underwent MCAO. This inverse hemodynamic response mainly stems from the vasorestrictive tone after stroke (Shin
et al., 2006). Although a few spreading ischemic events were observed
in the present study (Supplementary Fig. 2), a speciﬁc tissue condition
required to generate those ischemic waves remains unclear and warrants further investigation.
After a series of CSDs, a prolonged reduction of perfusion level (N5 h)
was observed in the whole brain in our model. It has been shown that
oligemia lasting longer than 1 h following KCl-induced or pinprickevoked CSDs in the treated cortex, potentially attributed to the longlasting reduction of cerebrovascular reactivity (Guiou et al., 2005;
Wahl et al., 1987). In addition, impaired neurovascular coupling due
to the suppression of intracortical inhibition after CSDs was observed
during transcallosal stimulation (Piilgaard and Lauritzen, 2009). Since
GABAergic interneurons may contain nitric oxide synthases and
vasoactive intestinal peptides (Enager et al., 2009), it is plausible that
dysfunction of these interneurons after CSDs not only suppresses
intracortical inhibition but also reduces cortical vascular reactivity. To
our knowledge, no previous studies have reported whole-brain
oligemia after CSDs. However, transcortical diaschisis, a phenomenon
showing hypo-metabolism and hypo-perfusion in the contralesional
cortex by corticocortical connections (Dobkin et al., 1989) cannot be
ruled out in our model. Additional studies are required to identify the
cause of oligemia and resolve the underlying physiological mechanism.
Several limitations of this study should be considered. First, due to
the model selected in this study, we observed the majority of CSDs during the ﬁrst 30 min after lesion onset except for Groups 4 and 5. Our
group is currently establishing an in-bore embolic stroke model and
hopes to study CSDs in a more clinically relevant condition in the future.
Second, as discussed above, this model does not consistently generate
spreading ischemia (hypoemic waves). A different model may be required to systemically identify the spatiotemporal signatures of spreading ischemic events (Shin et al., 2006). Third, T1 relaxation time may
change under pathological condition and this was not considered in
our analysis. Although changes in T1 relaxation time may not be significant within 1 h after lesion onset (van Dorsten et al., 2002), an increase
of T1 value at later time points has been shown in the cortex and caudate
putamen at 7 h after MCAO (Hoehn-Berlage et al., 1995a). These gradual
increases in T1 value could result in a decrease of MR-derived CBF.
Fourth, quantifying CSD features across events was not feasible for the

138

current study due to the small number of subjects undergoing continuous ADC or CBF measurement. We plan to examine this in our future
studies. Fifth, due to the relative small lesion volume in the hyperacute
phase, a small ROI in the laser target region was used. Quantiﬁcation of
ADC and CBF changes could be affected by potential partial volume effects. Sixth, in our experiments using bilateral lesion induction (Groups
3–5), pathological interactions between two hemispheres could appear.
Nevertheless, the ADC and CBF time-courses, the number of CSDs and
the ﬁnal infarct volume in the control side of Groups 3–5 did not show
signiﬁcant differences compared to Group 1, suggesting the comparable
physiological conditions between unilateral and bilateral lesion experiments. Seventh, recent work has demonstrated that the perfusion–diffusion mismatch failed to predict outcomes in patients that
underwent endovascular therapy (Kidwell et al., 2013). Areas with
ADC and CBF deﬁcits may not be able to accurately measure ischemic
core and penumbra due to the threshold used (Heiss, 2010). Collectively, the mismatch volume in our study may only approximate, but not
represent, the ischemic penumbra. Of note, no gold-standard ADC and
CBF thresholds were identiﬁed to probe ischemic tissue (Dani et al.,
2011; Heiss, 2011; Wardlaw, 2010). The ADC and CBF deﬁcit areas presented herein were generated by corresponding thresholds discussed in
the Methods section. Lastly, simultaneous electrophysiological recordings were not performed during MRI scans to conﬁrm that the observed
CSDs were accompanied by strong electrical depolarization. Our group
is developing MR-compatible neural electrodes and a recording protocol in the rat cortex, and aims to perform simultaneous recording in
the near future (Lai et al., 2012; Shih et al., 2013a).
Conclusion
In summary, the current study demonstrates that both CBF and ADC
MRI are sensitive to CSDs, and the number of CSDs is associated with the
perfusion–diffusion mismatch volume in the hyperacute phase of ischemia. We have developed a photothrombotic model to induce controllable ischemic lesions in rats during MRI scans. This model, together with
continuous or interleaved ADC and CBF acquisition, provides a unique
tool to study tissue pathophysiology immediately after ischemic insult
using MRI with high temporal resolution. Our model also proved useful
to probe CSDs in a quantitative manner. Future studies will apply these
CSD-sensitive dynamic perfusion and diffusion MRI techniques to a
more clinically relevant stroke model and comprehensively establish
functional outcome correlates of CSD signatures in the hyperacute
phase of stroke.
