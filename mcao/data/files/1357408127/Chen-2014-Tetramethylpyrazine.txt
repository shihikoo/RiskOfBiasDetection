CXC195 showed strongest protective effects among the ligustrazine derivatives in cells and prevented
apoptosis induced by H2O2 injury. We recently demonstrated that CXC195 protected against cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by its antioxidant activity. However, whether the anti-apoptotic action
of CXC195 is involved in cerebral I/R injury is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of CXC195 in
apoptotic processes induced by cerebral I/R and the possible signaling pathways. Male Wistar rats were
submitted to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion for 2 h, followed by 24 h reperfusion. CXC195
was injected intraperitoneally at 2 h and 12 h after the onset of ischemia. The number of apoptotic cells
was measured by TUNEL assay, apoptosis-related protein cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2, Bax and the phosphorylation levels of Akt and GSK3b in ischemic penumbra were assayed by western blot. The results showed
that administration of CXC195 at the doses of 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg signiﬁcantly inhibited the apoptosis
by decreasing the number of apoptotic cells, decreasing the level of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, and
increasing the level of Bcl-2 in rats subjected to I/R injury. Simultaneously, CXC195 treatment markedly
increased the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3b. Blockade of PI3K activity by wortmannin, dramatically
abolished its anti-apoptotic effect and lowered both Akt and GSK3b phosphorylation levels. Our study
ﬁrstly demonstrated that CXC195 protected against cerebral I/R injury by reducing apoptosis in vivo
and PI3K/Akt/GSK3b pathway involved in the anti-apoptotic effect.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the second leading cause of death in industrialized
countries and the most important cause of disability (Dirnagl
et al., 1999). Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury has been
becoming more and more important with the development of
thrombolytic drugs. Apoptosis is one of the major mechanism that
lead to cell death after cerebral I/R (Broughton et al., 2009). Cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury exacerbates neuronal apoptosis and a large number of TUNEL-positive cells were observed 24 h
after reperfusion (Xing et al., 2008).

Unlike necrotic cell death, apoptosis is an active process of cell
death that requires activation of associated genes and synthesis of
their encoded proteins. The phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) are
a conserved family of signal transduction enzymes which play a
fundamental role in regulating cell survival. The PI3K and the
downstream serine/threonine kinase Akt (also known as protein
kinase B, PKB) modulate cellular activation, inﬂammatory response, and apoptosis (Fruman and Cantley, 2002; Liu et al.,
2013b; Zhang et al., 2008). Activated Akt phosphorylates several
downstream targets such as glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b)
(Jope and Johnson, 2004). Recent studies have identiﬁed PI3K/
Akt/GSK3b signaling pathway play a vital role in regulating cellular
survival/death following hypoxia and I/R (Arslan et al., 2013; Li
et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2011).
Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) is the most important extract from
the traditional Chinese herb Chuanxiong (Ligusticum wallichii FRANCHAT), which has been widely used in China for the treatment of

ischemic stroke because of its neuroprotective effect (Jia et al.,
2009; Kao et al., 2006). Hsiao et al. (2006) demonstrated that TMP
possesses marked neuroprotection on cerebral I/R damage in rats
and this protective effect of TMP is assumed to be mediated, at least
partially, by the inhibition of platelet aggregation, neutrophil activation, and inﬂammatory responses and reactive oxygen species
formation. Recent study showed that TMP attenuated the activities
of ischemia-induced inﬂammation-associated signaling molecules
and transcription factors by a further elevated expression of NFE2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in ipsilateral neurons and macrophages/microglia after cerebral ischemia
(Kao et al., 2013). Furthermore, several reports demonstrated that
TMP protected against cerebral ischemic injury by inhibiting the
neuronal apoptosis (Kao et al., 2006; Liao et al., 2004). A series of
novel ligustrazine derivatives were generated recently by combination with pharmacophores such as piperazine (Deng et al., 2012). Of
all, the tetramethylpyrazine diphenylmethyl piperazidine
(CXC195; Fig. 1) showed strongest protective effects on endothelial
cells damaged by H2O2 and prevented H2O2-induced apoptosis
through inhibition of the caspase-3 pathway and ERK pathway
(Ou et al., 2010). Our pharmacokinetics study showed the t1/2 of
CXC195 after intraperitoneal administration was 4.24 h which is
much longer than t1/2 of TMP (Wei et al., 2013). We also demonstrated that CXC195 had a neuroprotective effect in transient focal
ischemia, which is most likely due to its antioxidant activity by
inhibiting NOX and iNOS expression (Liu et al., 2013a). However,
whether the anti-apoptotic action of CXC195 is involved in cerebral
I/R injury is unknown. Herein, we tested its anti-apoptotic properties and possible mechanisms with the aim of explaining how
CXC195 protects neurons from I/R-induced damage by using transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals and reagents
The TMP analogue CXC195 was synthesized by our lab. Its purity (>98%) was determined by HPLC. All chemicals and reagents
used in this study were of analytical grade and were purchased
from Sigma (St Louis, MS, USA) unless otherwise mentioned. The
antibodies of total Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser473), GSK3b and phospho-GSK3b were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The antibodies of cleaved caspase-3, pro caspase-3,
Bcl-2 and Bax were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA). In situ apoptosis detection kit was purchased
from Roche Diagnostic (Indianapolos, IN).
2.2. Animal models for transient focal cerebral ischemia
Transient MCAO was induced in male Wistar rats (270–300 g)
provided by Laboratory Animals Center of Shandong University

as described previously (Wei et al., 2005). All procedures were
pre-approved by the Institutional Animal Use Committee. In brief,
anesthesia was induced using 10% chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg).
Temperature was maintained between 36.5 °C and 37.5 °C with a
homeothermal blanket. The left common and external carotid
arteries were isolated and ligated. A nylon monoﬁlament was
introduced from the common carotid artery into the internal carotid artery until a resistance was encountered, thus blocking the origin of the middle cerebral artery. A successful occlusion was
indicated by a decrease in the regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF)
to <20% of the baseline by transcranial laser-Doppler (Perimed, Jarfalla, Sweden) measurement in the area of cerebral cortex supplied
by the middle cerebral artery. Two hours later, reperfusion was initiated by thread withdrawal.
Animals were randomly divided into seven groups (n = 10):
sham group; I/R group; 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg dose of
CXC195 group; wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor) group; CXC195
(3 mg/kg) plus wortmannin group. Vehicle is 1% dimethyl sulfoxide
in normal saline (NS). The doses of CXC195 were chosen based on
our preliminary studies (Liu et al., 2013a). CXC195 and vehicle
were injected intraperitoneally 2 h and 12 h after the onset of
ischemia. Wortmannin (100 nM in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide in NS)
or the vehicle (1% dimethyl sulfoxide in NS) (10 lL, 0.5 mm posterior and 1.4 mm lateral to the bregma and 3.1 mm from the duramater) was injected using a stereotaxic instrument and injector
(Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA). After 24 h of reperfusion, the
rats were anesthetized and then decapitated. The brains were
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for the following studies.
2.3. TUNEL assay
The frozen sections from ﬁve rats were harvested for terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Nucleosomal DNA fragmentation in cells was determined by the TUNEL assay using an in situ apoptosis detection
kit as described previously (Chen et al., 2009). The cells displaying
brown staining within the nucleus were counted as TUNEL positive
cells. The number of TUNEL-positive cells was counted in 3 nonoverlapping microscopic eyeshots by a person blinded to the group
assignment and expressed as percentage under high-power magniﬁcation (200).
2.4. Western blot
Western blot was performed as described previously (Chen
et al., 2009). Tissues (n = 5, in each group) corresponding to the
ischemic penumbra were minced into fragments, homogenized in
lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris–HCl pH 6.8, 150 mmol/L NaCl,
5 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% NP-40 and protease inhibitor cocktail) and centrifugated (2000 g, 5 min, 4 °C). The
protein concentrations were determined using a BCA Protein Assay
reagent kit (Beyotime, Haimen, China). The lysates were separated
by 8–12% SDS–PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). After blocking with solution of 5%
skim milk powder in 1  TBS for one hour, the membranes were
incubated with primary antibodies of anti-cleaved caspase3(1:400), anti-pro caspase-3(1:1000), anti-Bcl-2(1:500), anti-Bax
(1:500), anti-p-Akt(1:500), anti-Akt(1:1000), anti-GSK3b(1:1000),
and anti-p-GSK3b(1:1000), overnight at 4 °C, respectively. After
washing three times with TBS-T for 5 min, the blot was incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-labeled second antibodies of antimouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (1:6000 dilution, ProteinTech Group,
Chicago, IL, USA), respectively. The blot was again washed three
times with TBS-T before being exposed to the SuperSignal West
Dura Extended Duration substrate (Pierce Bio technology, Rockford, IL). An enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) detection system

L. Chen et al. / Neurochemistry International 66 (2014) 27–32

was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and immunoblots were exposed to autoradiography ﬁlm (Hyperﬁlm-ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The signals were quantiﬁed by scanning
densitometry and data within a linear range were quantiﬁed using
Image Quant software (GE Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
2.5. Statistical analysis
All data were represented as means ± S.E.M. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni tests to determine where differences among groups
existed. Differences were considered statistically signiﬁcant for
values of p < 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Anti-apoptotic effect of CXC195 against experimental local
cerebral I/R in rats
To determine whether CXC195 plays a role in apoptosis, TUNEL
assay was used to exam the typical DNA laddering pattern of neurons in the ischemic penumbra regions after I/R. We found that the
number of apoptotic cells in the penumbra cortex in rats with 2 h
left MCAO followed by 24 h reperfusion was increased signiﬁcantly
compared with the sham group. However, the number of apoptotic
cells was decreased signiﬁcantly in the CXC195 treatment group at
either 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg compared with I/R group (p < 0.05,
Fig. 2A).
The activation of caspase-3 was required for the execution of
apoptosis, and thus was determined in our study. As shown in
Fig. 2B, cerebral I/R injury induced the activation of caspase-3 compared with sham group signiﬁcantly. The CXC195 treatment group
at either 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg dosage inhibited the activation of
caspase-3 dramatically compared with I/R group (p < 0.05,
Fig. 2B). No signiﬁcant differences between 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/
kg groups were found in the levels of apoptotic cells and cleaved
caspase-3 protein expression (p > 0. 0 5).
As Bcl-2 and Bax are important apoptotic markers, the levels of
Bcl-2 and Bax were also tested in this study. Fig. 2C showed that
the Bcl-2 protein level in ischemic penumbra was signiﬁcantly
decreased and the Bax protein level was signiﬁcantly increased

29

in I/R group compared with the sham group. CXC195 treatment
at the doses of 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg signiﬁcantly increased the
levels of Bcl-2 and decreased the levels of Bax compared with I/R
group respectively.
3.2. CXC195 prevents the reduction of phosphorylation of Akt and
GSK3b induced by cerebral I/R
In models of cerebral ischemia, Akt phosphorylation was increased at 1 h and 4 h after I/R, but decreased signiﬁcantly at
24 h after reperfusion (Janelidze et al., 2001). In the present study,
to examine whether CXC195 can activate Akt signaling following
cerebral I/R, we determined the levels of phosphorylated Akt
(phospho-Akt) at Ser473. The levels of phospho-Akt at Ser473 in
ischemic penumbra were signiﬁcantly lower in the I/R group compared with the sham group. Importantly, reduced levels of phospho-Akt at Ser473 caused by cerebral I/R were increased by
CXC195 at either 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg treatment (p < 0.05, Fig. 3A).
GSK3b is an important downstream target of the Akt signaling
pathway. Phosphorylation of GSK3b on serine-9 by Akt results in
GSK3b inactivation. We determined the effect of CXC195 on phosphorylation of GSK3b (phospho-GSK3b) following cerebral I/R. As
shown in Fig. 3B, cerebral I/R injury dramatically decreased the levels of phospho-GSK3b in the penumbra cortex in rats. Treatment
with CXC195 at doses of 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg signiﬁcantly increased the levels of phospho-GSK3b when compared with I/R
group. However, no signiﬁcant differences in the levels of phospho-Akt and phospho-GSK3b were found between 3 mg/kg and
10 mg/kg groups (p > 0.05, Fig. 3), so CXC195 at the dose of 3 mg/
kg was used in the subsequent experiment.
3.3. Inhibition of PI3K blocks CXC195 induced anti-apoptotic effect
following cerebral I/R injury
To examine whether CXC195 produces anti-apoptotic effect by
activating Akt, the speciﬁc PI3K inhibitor wortmannin was administered at 1 h prior to MCAO. TUNEL assay revealed wortmannin
further increased the number of apoptotic cells at 24 h after reperfusion. However, treatment with CXC195 plus wortmannin increased the number of apoptotic cells signiﬁcantly compared
with CXC195 alone (Fig. 4A, p < 0.05). Wortmannin also blocked

CXC195-induced inactivation of caspase-3 (Fig. 4B). Moreover,
treatment with CXC195 plus wortmannin signiﬁcantly decreased
the level of Bcl-2 and increased the level of Bax compared
with CXC195 alone (Fig. 4C). These results strongly suggested
that CXC195 induced anti-apoptotic effect through a PI3K/Akt
pathway.
3.4. CXC195 induced phosphorylation of GSK3b via PI3K/Akt pathway
Western blot assay showed that wortmannin suppressed
phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3b. CXC195 treatment alone
signiﬁcantly increased phosphorylations of Akt and GSK3b
at 24 h after reperfusion. Consistent with its neutralizing effects
on anti-apoptotic effects induced by CXC195, treatment with
CXC195 plus wortmannin markedly lowered both GSK3b and Akt
phosphorylation levels compared with CXC195 alone (Fig. 5A and
B). These results indicated that CXC195 promoted GSK3b
phosphorylation through PI3K/Akt pathway.

4. Discussion
Apoptosis plays an important role in ischemic neuronal damage
(Perez-Alvarez et al., 2012). It is well known that cell death in the
ischemic core is mainly triggered by necrosis, while that occurring
in the penumbra is predominantly mediated by apoptosis (Richard
Green et al., 2003). As apoptosis is a reversible process, research
has been focused on the apoptotic pathways involved in neuronal
death after MCAO, with a purpose to identify important therapeutic targets. Our present study demonstrated that new tetramethylpyrazine analogue CXC195 inhibited apoptosis in the penumbral
cortex in rats subjected to I/R injury, which was associated with
GSK3b phosphorylation through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
As a result of CXC195 treatment, a signiﬁcant reduction in the
number of TUNEL-positive cells in the penumbra cortex was observed which could be attributed to its potential neuroprotective
effect. Caspase-3, as one of the caspase family member, plays an
important role in mediating cell apoptosis (Snigdha et al., 2012).

followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Tissues corresponding to the ischemic penumbra were harvested for western blot. Western blot analysis of p-Akt (Ser473) (A) and pGSK3b(Ser9) (B) in the penumbral cortex. Wortmannin was intraventricularly administered to rats 1h before MCAO with or without CXC195. ⁄p < 0.05 compared with sham
group; #p < 0.05 compared with I/R group; Dp < 0.05 compared with CXC195 group.

It was demonstrated previously CXC195 prevented H2O2-induced
apoptosis in endothelial cells in vitro through inhibition of caspase-3 (Ou et al., 2010). Consistently, our result also showed that
the CXC195 treatment decreased the activation of caspase-3 dramatically in penumbral cortex in rats after cerebral I/R. Previous
study revealed that transient cerebral ischemia can induce activation of apoptosis-associated genes, such as Bcl-2 and Bax in the
hippocampus and cortex (Koistinaho and Hokfelt, 1997). Bcl-2 is
an anti-apoptotic factor and important for cell survival while Bax
promotes apoptosis. It has been reported that TMP can exhibit an
inhibitory effect on cell apoptosis through modulation of the Bcl2 family following spinal cord ischemic damage (Fan et al.,
2006). Our result showed that CXC195 treatment signiﬁcantly increased the levels of Bcl-2 and decreased the levels of Bax compared with I/R group respectively. Thereby, the results suggested
CXC195 might protect the neurons against cerebral I/R by its
anti-apoptotic effect.
It has been reported that activation of PI3K and its downstream
effector Akt could suppress apoptosis and promote cell survival
(Chan et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2011). Akt activation
promotes cell survival by phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of apoptosis-inducing factors, GSK3b, which is particularly
aboundant in the CNS (Cross et al., 2001). Previous studies suggested that upregulation of the dominant inactive GSK3b (phospho-GSK3b) prevents apoptosis and upregulation of the active
GSK3b induces neuronal death (Leroy and Brion, 1999; Pap and
Cooper, 1998). Moreover, speciﬁc GSK3b inhibitors decrease the infarct size following focal cerebral ischemia (Kelly et al., 2004). Several studies have implicated the PI3K/Akt/GSK3b pathway
regulated cell survival after cerebral I/R injury (Endo et al., 2006;
Noshita et al., 2001; Sun et al., 2011). We recently demonstrated
that phosphorylation of GSK3b by Akt at Ser 9 inactivated its kinase
activity and inhibited cellular apoptosis (Chen et al., 2009). Given
the neuroprotective role of the PI3K/Akt/GSK3b signaling pathway
in cerebral ischemia, we hypothesized that the PI3K/Akt/GSK3b
pathway might involve in the anti-apoptotic effect of CXC195 on
cerebral I/R insult.
In the present study, our data showed that CXC195 signiﬁcantly
enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3b compared to I/R
group. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling abrogated CXC195
anti-apoptotic effect. Simultaneously, treatment with CXC195
and wortmannin markedly lowered the phospho-Akt and
phospho-GSK3b levels as compared with CXC195 treatment alone.
Collectively, these results indicated that PI3K/Akt/GSK3b pathway
involved in the anti-apoptotic effect of CXC195 in cerebral I/R

injury. GSK3b is also the key downstream of the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway in the pharmacological neuroprotection against I/R injury
(Zhang et al., 2006). Recent study revealed that TMP modulation
of ERK/p53 signaling led to mitochondrial-mediated and caspasedependent apoptosis in HSCs in vitro (Zhang et al., 2013). It was
previously demonstrated that the protective effect of CXC195 in
H2O2-induced apoptosis of endothelial cells was associated with
the ERK pathway (Ou et al., 2010). However, if ERK pathway regulates the anti-apototic effect of CXC195 in cerebral I/R injury need
further investigation.
In summary, our study ﬁrstly demonstrated that CXC195 protected against cerebral I/R injury by reducing apoptosis in vivo.
Moreover, CXC195 exerted its anti-apoptotic effect through PI3K/
Akt/GSK3b signaling pathway and showed a therapeutic potential
for treatment of stroke.
