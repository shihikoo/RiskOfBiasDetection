Abstract
Purpose: Using [18 F]PBR06 positron emission tomography (PET) to characterize the time
course of stroke-associated neuroinﬂammation (SAN) in mice, to evaluate whether brain
microglia inﬂuences motor function after stroke, and to demonstrate the use of [18 F]PBR06 PET
as a therapeutic assessment tool.
Procedures: Stroke was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in Balb/c
mice (control, stroke, and stroke with poststroke minocycline treatment). [18 F]PBR06 PET/CT
imaging, rotarod tests, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed 3, 11, and 22 days
poststroke induction (PSI).
Results: The stroke group exhibited signiﬁcantly increased microglial activation, and impaired motor
function. Peak microglial activation was 11 days PSI. There was a strong association between
microglial activation, motor function, and microglial protein expression on IHC. Minocycline
signiﬁcantly reduced microglial activation and improved motor function by day 22 PSI.
Conclusion: [18 F]PBR06 PET imaging noninvasively characterizes the time course of SAN, and
shows increased microglial activation is associated with decreased motor function.

Introduction

N

capability of our imaging methodology as a screening tool
for novel therapeutic agents.

euroinﬂammation mediated by activated microglia is a

core mechanism of chronic impairment of brain
function after a substantial range of brain injuries, with
stroke being a well-characterized example. Stroke is a
leading cause of chronic morbidity in the USA involving
both motor and cognitive impairments. The initial ischemic
insult and infarction triggers an inﬂammatory cascade which
features generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
secretion of cytokines and chemokines, and microglial
activation as prominent components [1–4]. The persistence
of microglial inﬂammation long after the initial injury
suggests an opportunity to impact chronic functional deﬁcits
through anti-inﬂammatory interventions. In experimental
rodent models, these interventions have been associated
with a decrease in activated microglia, increase in
neurogenesis, and improvement in motor and cognitive
impairment as assessed by immunohistochemistry of brain
tissues and functional assays such as maze tests and the
accelerating rotarod test [5–7]. Microglial proteins further
serve as therapeutic targets for various neuroinﬂammatory
disorders, and various anti-inﬂammatory interventions following stroke in rodents are associated with a decrease in
activated microglia, increase in neurogenesis, and improvement in functional impairment [8].
The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), formerly known
as the peripheral benzodiazapene receptor [9], is a microglial
protein located on the outer mitochondrial membrane of
steroid-synthesizing tissues. TSPO expression is low in the
normal brain but increases substantially in response to
neuroinﬂammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. TSPO
has thus been used as a biomarker of neuroinﬂammatory
disorders, and a number of positron emission tomography
(PET)-based radioligands that serve as its substrates have
been developed [10–16]. We recently demonstrated that one
such PET-based radioligand, [18 F]PBR06, speciﬁcally images TSPO in microglia-mediated neuroinﬂammation in the
mouse brain after stroke induction [17]. Noninvasive
imaging permits monitoring of stroke-associated neuroinﬂammation (SAN) over time within the same animal and its
correlation with functional/behavioral assessments. The
current study seeks to evaluate SAN longitudinally using
[18 F]PBR06 PET and to correlate the changes in imaging
signal with serial motor and neurobehavioral testing (rotarod
tests) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in mouse models of
stroke. Additionally, we seek to demonstrate (with
minocycline) that [18 F]PBR06 PET may be used to evaluate
novel anti-inﬂammatory interventions for SAN. We specifically chose minocycline because it had been previously
shown to be an effective intervention for stroke and its effect
on activated microglia has been evaluated through immunochemistry and other methods [18, 19]. Our goal was to
demonstrate, with an already known intervention, the

Materials and Methods
Preparation of [18 F]PBR06
The tracer was prepared as previously described [17, 20]. Brieﬂy,
aqueous [18 F]ﬂuoride ion was dried, complexed with 18-Crown-6,
and reacted with the precursor N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-bromoN-(2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide. It was then puriﬁed by injecting
into a semi preparative Gemini C18 column (5 μm, 10 mm×
250 mm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) at 214 nm. [18 F]PBR06 was
eluted at 5 ml/min with a mixture of 50 mM ammonium formate
(pH 6) and 50 mM ammonium formate in MeCN (25:75, v/v). The
speciﬁc radioactivities were 4,357 mCi/umol 5.4 % DCY;
2,548 mCi/umol, 2.4 % DCY; and 1,851 mCi/umol, 2.6 % DCY
for 3, 11, and 22 days, respectively. On average, 150 ul of the tracer
was injected into each mouse.

Stroke Induction and Minocycline Treatment
All the experiments were approved by the Administrative Panel on
Laboratory Animal Care (APLAC) of Stanford University. A total
of 20 Balb/c female mice (nine stroke, eight stroke plus
minocycline, and three sham controls; Charles River Laboratories,
Wilmington, MA) were randomly assigned to a speciﬁc treatment.
Strokes were induced by the middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) procedure as previously described [21]. Minocycline was
dissolved in saline solution and administered through intraperitoneal injections at 50 mg/kg in a total volume of 100 ul every day
for a week, starting 1 h after reperfusion. Thereafter, it was
administered every other day for the duration of the experiment.

Rotarod Test
An accelerating rotarod (Rotamex-5; Columbus Instruments,
Columbus, Ohio) was used to evaluate the mouse motor function
[22]. Mice underwent the rotarod test on days 3, 11, and 22 PSI,
immediately before [18 F]PBR06 PET imaging. The protocol
involved acceleration from 3 to 30 revolutions per min and the
test ended when a mouse fell off the rod. A connected computer
immediately recorded the time and speed at which the mouse fell
off. Each mouse underwent three different tests for each day.

MR Imaging
The mice were anesthetized with 2 % isoﬂurane in oxygen and high
resolution MRI was acquired (2 days PSI) as previously described
[17] on a 7-T animal MRI scanner (GE-Varian “microSigna 7.0”
GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI; Varian Inc., Walnut Creek, CA)
with a 9-cm bore gradient insert (Resonance Research, Inc.,
Billerica, MA, USA) and the LX11 control console (GE
Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA). The coil was a 1.5-cm diameter
transmit-receive surface coil, and the imaging sequence was a T2weighted (T2w) fast spin echo with fat saturation.

PET/CT Imaging
Scanning was performed with a MicroPET Inveon PET/CT rodent
model instrument (Siemens Medical Solutions Inc., Malvern, PA)
using a 4-mouse holder with nose cones for isoﬂurane anesthesia
administration [17]. Prior to imaging, four mice were injected
intravenously with an average of 9.5 MBq (258 μCi) of [18
F]PBR06. They were then imaged 70–80 min later. This was based
on our previous study [23] which showed that the tracer uptake
ratio between the infarct and comparable regions on the non-infarct
hemisphere was highest between 60 to 80 min after [18 F]PBR06
injection. The imaging protocol involved CT image acquisition for
10 min followed immediately by PET image acquisition for the
next 15 min. Speciﬁcations for the CT imaging were 80 kv/
500 mA; number of projections, 256; exposure time, 240 ms;
effective pixel size, 103.06 μm; binning,4.

Image Analysis
PET image reconstruction was performed with the ordered subsets
expectation maximization (OSEM) 2D algorithm [24]. No attenuation correction was applied during the reconstruction. However,
the impact on quantiﬁcation using the same multi-animal holder
was previously determined to be minimal [25]. Images from PET,
CT, and MRI were analyzed using an in-house software program,
RT_Image [26]. Using rigid body transformation, PET/CT images
were manually coregistered with MRI images by identifying
matching anatomic features on the skull and brain. Ideally, the
regions of interest (ROIs) would have been conﬁgured over regions
of the infarct as deﬁned by T2-weighted MRI for each time point.
However, since there were no corresponding MRI images at days
11 and 22 PSI, the MRI images at 2 days PSI served as templates
for the PET images. Based on the MR images, ellipsoidal ROIs
were drawn on each slice to delineate the infarct region. Slices
comprising 40 % of the total brain were then merged to form threedimensional volumes within which included were the infarct and
surrounding areas (Fig. 1). We had previously noticed from our
earlier studies [17] that the infarct was always within this region of
the brain. This standardized region of interest (ROI) was then
placed within the same region of the MRI image, in all the brains
analyzed, for all time points. A matching ROI was placed on the
contralateral hemisphere for each animal. Radioactivity values were
decay-corrected and expressed in units of percent injected dose per
gram (%ID/g). Values on the ipsilateral hemisphere were normalized to the contralateral hemisphere and expressed as a percentage
i.e., [(%ID/g ipsilateral−%ID/g contralateral)/%ID/g contralateral]×100. Due to the large ROIs (covering about 40 % of each
brain) used in the analysis, the observed percentage increases for
tracer uptake signifying microglial activation were smaller than
expected. We were nevertheless able to detect signiﬁcant differences in our comparisons.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for the microglial
proteins TSPO, CD68, and CD11b. The primary antibodies used
were rabbit monoclonal anti-mouse TSPO (Epitomics, Burlingame,
CA), rat monoclonal anti-mouse CD68 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA),

823

and rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse CD11b diluted at 1:500 (TSPO,
CD68) and 1:100 (CD11b) in blocking solution. The secondary
antibodies used were goat anti-rat IgG Alexa Fluor 488 and goat
anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The
staining procedures were as follows: using a cryostat (Leica
CM1950, Leica Biosystems, St Louis, MO), 10 μm sections were
obtained from mouse brains frozen in OCT. The sections, on
microscopic slides, were ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde (20 min),
placed in PBS containing NH4Cl (50 mmol/l; 5 min), and then
transferred to chilled methanol-acetone (1:1 at −20 °C; 5 min),
followed immediately by Triton-X 100 (0.1 % in PBS; 5 min).
Blocking was performed with goat serum (5 %/Tween 0.5 %) in
PBS for 30 min and immediately incubated with the primary
antibodies at room temperature for 1 h followed by incubation with
the secondary antibody, also for 1 h. Sections were washed with
PBS after every step. They were mounted in DAPI-containing medium
and imaged with a ﬂuorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.,
Oberkochen, Germany). Adjacent sections were stained for CD68
and CD11b, and each protein was co-stained with TSPO. Each value
represents the mean of 12 exposures over four different sections (four
exposures per hemisphere per section) from each of the three mice at
each time point. The intensity from each exposure was determined
using the ImageJ program and values shown represent the difference
between the mean intensity of the stroke and non-stroke regions,
expressed as a percentage of the non-stroke region.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.4 software (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary NC) and GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad
Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). To determine whether there were any
differences in tracer uptake between days, we performed a 2-way
ANOVA with day (3, 11, 22) and group (control, stroke, and
stroke+minocycline) as the factors. Where an interaction was
observed between the two factors, pairwise comparisons for the
individual group means at speciﬁc days were performed. Means
were separated using Tukey’s test. To determine whether there was
any association between microglial activation and motor function,
linear regression tests were performed between tracer uptake
values, time spent on the rotarod, and microglial protein expression
for any signiﬁcant association between the sets of measurements. P
values less than 0.05 indicated a statistically signiﬁcant difference.

Results
[18 F]PBR06 PET Uptake and Accumulation Over
Time
As previously described, [18 F]PBR06 quantiﬁcation was
based on a standardized region of interest (ROI) drawn over
the infarct on the left (ipsilateral) hemisphere with a
comparable ROI placed on the right (contralateral) hemisphere (Fig. 1). As demonstrated by T2w MRI, the infarct
covered regions over the left hemisphere of the mouse brain
and these showed signiﬁcantly higher uptake of [18 F]PBR06
compared to corresponding regions on the non-stroke
hemisphere in the stroke and stroke plus minocycline
groups. In contrast, [18 F]PBR06 uptake was not signiﬁcantly

uptake increased signiﬁcantly (by an average of 26 %) in the
infarct regions relative to the non-infarct regions 3 days PSI.
Peak accumulation was observed at 11 days, when the

onset. The nature of the interaction was such that, as [18
F]PBR06 uptake increased (signifying microglial activation
and the presence of stroke) in the infarct regions, the time on
the rotarod decreased over 3 to 22 days PSI (Fig. 3a,
Table 2). In contrast, the sham controls showed no
signiﬁcant increases in tracer uptake.

Over the period of the experiment, tracer accumulation in the
stroke plus minocycline group was signiﬁcantly lower
(47 %) than in the stroke group (59 %). There was an
interaction between the occurrence of stroke and day from
onset of stroke on the length of time each mouse stayed on
the rotarod (Table 1), indicating that the time on rotarod was
inﬂuenced by the presence of stroke and the day from its

less intense and absent in the stroke plus minocycline and
control groups, respectively. Within the infarct region,
immunoﬂuorescence staining demonstrated that large numbers of activated microglia indicated by CD68 staining

region (Fig. 4b). In the stroke plus minocycline group, there
was no signiﬁcant difference in the expression of both TSPO
and CD68 at 3 and 11 days PSI, but signiﬁcant reductions
were observed at 22 days PSI (Fig. 4b). CD11b expression,
an indication of total microglia, was lower in the stroke plus
minocycline group compared to the stroke group at 22 days
PSI. Quantiﬁcation of the microglial proteins over time
indicated that TSPO and CD68 expression at 3 and 11 days
PSI were not signiﬁcantly different. At 22 days PSI
however, TSPO and CD68 expression were signiﬁcantly
higher in the infarct regions of the stroke group compared to
the stroke plus minocycline and control groups. TSPO and
CD68 expression proﬁles over 3, 11, and 22 days PSI were
similar to [18 F]PBR06 uptake proﬁle over the period:
signiﬁcantly increased microglial protein expression and

tracer uptake from 3 to 11 days PSI and maintained at
similar levels at 22 days PSI for the stroke group. The
expression proﬁle of CD11b was slightly different from
TSPO and CD68, where the stroke plus minocycline group
showed signiﬁcantly decreased expression of CD11b at all
three time points. The quantiﬁed values represent the relative
increase in intensity of the stroke over the non-stroke region
expressed as a percentage of the non-stroke region.

spent by the mouse on the rotarod (Table 3). Brain microglial
proteins also showed highly signiﬁcant associations with time
spent on the rotarod during the experimental period.
Regressing [18 F]PBR06 uptake values on TSPO, CD68, and
CD11B resulted in signiﬁcant relationships between brain
tracer uptake and microglial protein expression. Among the
microglial proteins, TSPO and CD68 exhibited stronger
association, compared to the association with CD11b.

Discussion
Several PET radioligands have been developed as imaging
agents for microglial neuroinﬂammation following stroke in
human and animal models [10, 14, 27–29]. We previously
characterized and validated [18 F]PBR06 PET as an imaging
methodology for SAN [17]. Our current study examines the
ability of this methodology to image and characterize
activated microglia-mediated SAN longitudinally in the
same animal. We also seek to establish and evaluate a direct
relationship between brain microglia and neurobehavioral
motor function using our imaging methodology, and to
explore the use of [18 F]PBR06 PET as a screening tool for
potential interventions in neurodegenerative disorders.
Importantly, in this study, we have characterized the
temporal evolution of the poststroke neurologic inﬂammatory
process in a single animal. We demonstrate that [18 F]PBR06
PET successfully monitors microglia-mediated SAN over time,
with peak microglial activation at 11 days PSI. Microglial
activation remained relatively high over the next 11 days as
demonstrated by [18 F]PBR06 accumulation in the infarct
regions relative to the non-infarct regions and the increased
expression of the biomarkers of microglial activation, TSPO,
CD68, and CD11b in the infarct regions.

Using regression analysis, we also demonstrated a
signiﬁcant association between microglial activation and
motor function over the ﬁrst 22-day period following the
onset of stroke in mice. This relationship was further
conﬁrmed by demonstrating a highly signiﬁcant association
between the expression of three microglial proteins and
motor function. The study thus demonstrates the use of a
noninvasive methodology to show that motor function is
directly associated with transient microglial activation over
time following stroke.
At present, there are no clinically practical methods for
evaluating or monitoring the microglial neuroinﬂammatory
process in any disease model noninvasively over time in either
animals or humans. As such, it is impossible to correlate
neuroinﬂammation with changes in function, behavior, and
cognition in the same animal over time. The current study
successfully demonstrated that [18 F]PBR06 PET was a feasible
imaging methodology that could effectively correlate neuroinﬂammation with motor function in the same animal. Speciﬁcally, microglial activation as demonstrated by enhanced [18
F]PBR06 accumulation and increased expression of TSPO and
CD68, increased from 3 to 11 days PSI while motor function
decreased proportionately. This observation was conﬁrmed
when minocycline, an anti-inﬂammatory intervention, reversed
microglial activation 22 days PSI and also improved motor
function at that time point.
This study further illustrates the use of [18 F]PBR06 PET
as a therapeutic response assessment tool. The tracer
noninvasively monitored the effects of an anti-inﬂammatory
intervention and correlated the imaging results with a
measureable neurobehavioral outcome, thus demonstrating
its use as a tool to screen interventions, and to assess the
effectiveness of the interventions.
Previous research has indicated that there are at least two
separate populations of microglial cells [30]. Distinguishing
between the two microglial populations and their effects on a
number of inﬂammatory processes has been challenging in part
because markers such as CD11b are expressed on all microglia
[28] while others like CD68 and TSPO may be expressed on
microglia in their activated state [31, 32]. The pattern of
microglial activation as shown by [18 F]PBR06 PET imaging
was consistent with the expression proﬁles of the imaging

target, TSPO, and CD68, but less so with the expression proﬁle

resident microglial activation (TSPO and CD68) and suggest
that the tracer uptake is through the resident microglia. The
imaging methodology employed here could thus be conceivably used to differentiate between the biological effects of
resident activated microglia and the total microglia.
Aspects of our major ﬁndings are consistent with reports
in previous studies. The time course results agrees with
another imaging study in which SAN was monitored using
[ 18 F]DPA-714 PET in separate animals over time.
Microglial activation was reported to peak at 11 days but
reduced gradually over the next 20 days [33]. A second
study that similarly characterized the microglial response in
SAN with a myeloperoxidase (MPO)-based imaging agent
and MRI determined that the MPO secreted from the
microglia peaked within 3 to 7 days [34]. Other histologybased studies have reported that microglial activation peaks
with 5–7 days PSI [35] up to 4 weeks PSI [36]. Our ﬁndings
indicate that microglial activation is lower at 3 days relative
to 11 days PSI. However, since we have no time
measurement at 7 days PSI, microglial activation could
conceivably peak between 7 and 11 days PSI.
Also consistent with our results, stroke has been reported
to signiﬁcantly reduce motor function in mice as measured
by time spent on the accelerating rotarod on days 2, 7, 14,
and 28 [37]. To the best of our knowledge, however, our
study is the ﬁrst to noninvasively and simultaneously
evaluate microglial activation and its effect on motor
function longitudinally in a preclinical disease model. The
study offers the possibility of developing mathematical
models and relationships to predict the progress of various
neuroinﬂammatory and neurodegenerative disorders for
which brain microglia may play a role in motor and
behavioral outcomes.
Although a recent study found no effects on microglial
activation following minocycline treatment [38], numerous
studies report that minocycline improves neurologic function
and decrease microglial activation PSI [5, 39, 40]. The
current study makes use of this feature to demonstrate the
ability of [18 F]PBR06 PET as a noninvasive technique to
evaluate the effects of a known intervention over time.

Additionally, the technique helped establish a direct relationship between microglial activation and a neurologic
outcome.
A limitation of the study pertains to the length of time the
experiment was performed. Some studies have shown
minocycline to be late-acting and it would be useful to
determine if minocycline completely reverses microglial
activation if the inﬂammatory process is monitored for a
longer period of time.

Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrated that [18 F]PBR06 PET is an
effective methodology to characterize microglial neuroinﬂammation over time in a mouse model of stroke, with peak
microglial expression at 11 days PSI. We further showed
that increased microglial expression coincided with a
reduction in motor function following stroke; that the
increased microglial expression was primarily due to
activated microglia. The study also conﬁrmed that
minocycline effectively reduced microglial activation at
22 days PSI and was effective in improving motor function
at that particular time point. Finally, [18 F]PBR06 PET was
shown to be a potential tool to assess various interventions
in a preclinical model of rodent neuroinﬂammation.
