SUMMARY
Aims: We aim to determine the significant effect of TPEN, a Zn2+ chelator, in mediating the
pathophysiological cascade in neuron death/apoptosis induced by hypoxia/ischemia.
Methods: We conducted both in vivo and in vitro experiments in this study. PC12 cells were
used to establish hypoxia/ischemia model by applying oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD).
SHR-SP rats were used to establish an acute ischemic model by electrocoagulating middle
cerebral artery occlusion. The effect of TPEN on neuron death/apoptosis was evaluated. In
addition, the relative biomarks of excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation reactions in hypoxia/ischemia PC12 cell model as well as in SHR-SP rat hypoxia/ischemia model
were also assessed. Results: TPEN significantly attenuates the neurological deficit, reduced
the cerebral infarction area and the ratio of apoptotic neurons, and increased the expression
of GluR2 in the rat hypoxia/ischemia brain. TPEN also increased blood SOD activity,
decreased blood NOS activity and blood MDA and IL-6 contents in rats under hypoxia/
ischemia. In addition, TPEN significantly inhibited the death and apoptosis of cells and
attenuated the alteration of GluR2 and NR2 expression caused by OGD or OGD plus high
Zn2+ treatments. Conclusions: Zn2+ is involved in neural cell apoptosis and/or
death caused by hypoxia/ischemia via mediating excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and
inflammation.

Introduction
Stroke is one of the age-related diseases and the second most common cause of death [1–3]. Ischemic stroke is the largest subtype,
with an estimated incidence of > 80% of all strokes, and with high
rate of morbidity, mortality, and disability [4–6]. Hypoxia is an
important pathological condition of stroke [7]. Functional and
behavioral deficits associated with nervous system damage from
hypoxia/stroke are associated with neuronal death in brain tissue
including hippocampus and cortex [7]. Neuronal death in brain

tissue following cerebral ischemia is represented as a mixed type
of apoptosis and necrosis [8]. Previous studies have suggested that
the ischemia-induced neuronal damage may involve in pathophysiological cascade reactions including excitotoxicity [7,9–11],
oxidative stress [6], and inflammation [12,13]. However, detailed
underlying mechanisms related to the neuronal death have not
been well elucidated yet.
Zn2+ is the most abundant trace metal ion in the brain [14]. It is
a constituent of about 3000 human proteins and required for
over 300 cellular processes from DNA transcription to protein

synthesis, assisting in enzyme structural and catalytic activity,
neurotransmission, intracellular signaling, and antibiotic activities
[15–17]. The importance of Zn2+ in the whole organism is indicated by the wide variety of consequences of Zn2+ deficiency,
including global disorders of development, such as growth retardation, and acute effects on peripheral tissues such as alopecia,
parakeratosis, esophageal lesions, impaired wound healing, etc.
[15]. It has been determined that, during neurotransmission in
glutamatergic neurons, zinc and glutamate are co-released into
the synaptic cleft [14]. It is now well recognized that Zn2+ influx
from the extracellular space and its mobilization from intracellular
pools such as mitochondria, cytosolic Zn2+ binding proteins, and
lysosomes lead to neuronal damage because of hypoxia/ischemia
[18–22]. On the other hand, excessive cytosolic Zn2+ depletion
can also be deleterious to neurons [18,20,23,24], suggesting that
tight regulation of Zn2+ homeostasis is crucial for neuronal survival. Although there are some experimental data elucidating the
mechanism of free Zn2+ on neuronal damage by hypoxia/ischemia
[24–26], it still needs more experimental evidences to clarify
whether and how free Zn2+ is involved in the neuronal damage
caused by hypoxia/ischemia.
Here we investigated the effect of N, N, N’, N’-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN), a Zn2+ chelator on neuron
death/apoptosis and on some pathophysiological cascade reactions
such as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation in both
in vitro hypoxia/ischemia model [PC12 cell line treated by oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)] and in vivo hypoxia/ischemia rat
model [by electrocoagulating middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO)]. We aim to provide more evidence demonstrating the
significance of free Zn2+ in mediating pathophysiological cascade
reactions such as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation in neuron death/apoptosis caused by hypoxia/ischemia.

The Experimented Animals and Management
Female stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP),
aged 12 weeks, weight about 200 g were provided by the Animal
Center of the Second Military Medical University (Shanghai,
China). The rats were housed under controlled temperatures (23–
25°C), relative humidity (70%), and lighting (8:00–20:00 light,
20:00–8:00 dark) with free access to food and tap water. All the
animals used in the experiment received human care in compliance with institutional guidelines for health and care of experimental animals.

Intracerebroventricular Administration and
MCAO Operation
Twenty SHR-SP rats were allotted to two groups (10/group) which
the animals in one group were injected into 5 lL aCSF containing
DMSO, whereas the animals in another group were injected into
5 lL 0.1 mol/L TPEN dissolved in aCSF containing DMSO by
intracerebroventricular administration applying stereotaxic apparatus. After above intracerebroventricular administration for
30 min, all animals were underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by electrocoagulation under being euthanized by
i.p. 15% of chloral hydrate.

Determination of Neurological Deficit Score
After MCAO for 24 h, the neurological deficit score of all animals
was determined according to the method [27]. The neurological
deficit score was graded from 0 to 15 (normal score, 0; maximal
deficit score, 15) according to 4 tests including balance beam test,
wire suspension test, tail walking test, and the tail suspension test.
In balance beam test, the rats were trained to traverse a square
beam measuring 2.4 cm 9 2.4 cm 9 84 cm. According to the
slipped status of foot and status of crossing the beam, the tested animals were, respectively, divided into 0–6 scores (normal score, 0;
maximal deficit score, 6). In wire suspension test, to test grip
strength and endurance, the front paws were positioned on a horizontal steel wire (2 mm diameter). Test parameters were latency to
the first fall and the number of falls during a 2-min assessment period, and the tested animals were, respectively, divided into 0–3
scores (normal score, 0; maximal deficit score, 3). In tail walking
test, the rats were trained to walk with the hind legs from the
ground by lifting tail. Walking coordination was tested, and the
tested animals were also, respectively, divided into 0–3 scores (normal score, 0; maximal deficit score, 3). In tail suspension test, the
animal was suspended by the tip of their tail, stretched status of animals was assessed, and the tested animals were also, respectively,
divided into 0–3 scores (normal score, 0; maximal deficit score, 3).

Assessment of Cerebral Infarct Size
After MCAO operation for 24 h and behavior test, the animals
were euthanized. And the brain was removed and placed into cold
0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 20°C) for a 2 min,
sliced transversely into six 2 mm sections from the anterior to the
posterior extremity, stained with 2% 2, 3, 5-triphenyl tetrazolium
chloride (TTC) for 30 min in the dark, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for more than 1 h. The infarct area of each section was
measured by a computerized image analysis system (Leica, Germany), and the total infarct area of one brain was estimated by
adding the infarct area of each section and corrected for brain
edema.

Measurement of Apoptotic Cells in Brains by
TUNEL Assay
The brains were carefully removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 4 h at 24 h after MCAO. Coronal
section (4 lm) was cut on a cryostat. TUNEL staining was performed using In situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Wuhan Boster Biological Engineering Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China), according to the
protocol provided by manufacturer. Briefly, sections were first
washed twice in PBS for 5 min and permeabilized for 2 min with
200 mL permeabilization solution (0.01 mol/L, pH 6.0 sodium citrate in PBS) at 95°C. After washing, the sections were incubated
with TUNEL Reaction Mix for 1.5 h at 37°C in the dark. Then, the
sections were incubated with POD and DAB/H2O2, respectively.
The number of TUNEL-positive cells per square millimeter of tissue at the margin of the infarct area was counted under highpower magnification (9400). TUNEL-positive cells were expressed
as percent of total cell count.

Determination of Serum SOD, MDA, NOS, and
IL-6
The serum was obtained after the rat was deeply anesthetized.
Serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA),
and NOS were assayed according to the instructions of the SOD,
MDA, and NOS assay kits from the manufacturer (Nanjing Jiancheng Biotech, Nanjing, China). And serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) was
examined with ELISA kits (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapoli, MN,
USA) according to the protocol provided by manufacturer.

Western Blotting Assay for Detecting GluR2 in
Brain Tissue
GluR2 in brain tissue was determined applying Western blotting
method based on the instructions of the manufacturer. Tissues
were homogenized by protein extraction reagent (Beyotime,
Nanjing, China) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail
(Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
(Pierce). About 50 lg of samples was run on 10% SDS-PAGE
(sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). The
proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The
nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with primary antibody
(anti-GluR2 monoclonal antibody from mouse; Sigma Co) for 2 h
at 25°C and then incubated with secondary antibody for 2 h. The

710

images were captured and analyzed by X-ray film-based technologies. GAPDH (anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody from mouse;
Sigma Co.) was used as a loading control. The optical density
value of the target band was analyzed with gel image processing
system.

PC12 Cells Culture
PC12 cell line was cultured in 1 g/L glucose Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 5% horse serum (HS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and
100 mg/mL streptomycin. Cells were incubated in humidified
atmosphere of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 37°C. DMEM, L-glutamine,
FBS, HS, penicillin, and streptomycin were from DingGuo
ChangSheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China.

Oxygen–glucose Deprivation (OGD) Treatment in
the Experiment
We used chemical methods to establish hypoxic-ischemic PC12
model (oxygen–glucose deprivation, OGD). The cells were cultured in the DMEM culture medium without glucose (Gibco,
USA), and adding 2 mM sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4) (AR, Tianjin, China) to remove the oxygen [28].

Measurement of PC12 Cell Viability by AO/EB
Staining Assay
We applied acridine orange (AO)/ethidium bromide (EB) staining assay (AO and EB, respectively, combine with DNA of vital
and death cells) to determine cell viability of every treatment.
Briefly, PC12 cells were diluted to 1 9 105 cells/mL and plated at
100 lL per well in cover glass of a 96-well microplate with
DMEM culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and
5% horse serum for 24 h. Then, PC12 cells were treated with
Control (normal culture medium), OGD (culture medium without glucose and adding 2 mM sodium dithionite), OGD plus
TPEN (50 lM), OGD plus TPEN (80 lM), OGD plus Zn2+
(100 lM), OGD plus TPEN (50 lM), and Zn2+ (100 lM) for 3 h
or 6 h. After washing with PBS, 20 lL of staining solution containing, respectively, 100 lg/L AO and 100 lg/L EB was added
to cover glass. Then, number of AO staining (green) and EB
staining (red) cells were counted under an immunofluorescence
microscope (Olympus, BX51; Olympus Optical Co., Ltd, Tokyo,
Japan). Cell viability was expressed as AO staining cells percent
of total cells.

Measurement of Apoptotic Cells in PC12 by
TUNEL Assay
TUNEL assay was performed on the PC12 cells of Control (normal
culture medium), OGD (culture medium without glucose and
adding 2 mM sodium dithionite), OGD plus TPEN (50 lM), OGD
plus Zn2+ (100 lM), OGD with TPEN (50 lM), and Zn2+
(100 lM) for 3 h or 6 h with an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit
(Biyuntian, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M
phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 and washed with PBS, and then were

permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X 100 in methanol for 2 min at
4°C. The cells were incubated with TUNEL assay solution at 37°C
for 60 min. Finally, the cells were washed with PBS and mounted
with fluorescent mounting medium. The number of TUNEL-positive PC12 was obtained by counting cells in six randomly selected
microscopic fields obtained from each coverslip at 920 objectives.
The percentage of TUNEL-positive PC12 against the total number
of PC12 was calculated and averaged.

Observation of PC12 Cells GluR2 and NR2
Expression by Immunofluorescence Method
Purified PC12 of Control (normal culture medium), OGD (culture
medium without glucose and adding 2 mM sodium dithionite),
OGD plus TPEN (50 lM), OGD plus Zn2+ (100 lM), OGD plus
TPEN (50 lM), and Zn2+ (100 lM) for 3 h or 6 h were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 for
20 min, and blocked with 3% normal goat serum and 1% BSA for
30 min. The cells were then incubated at room temperature with
primary antibodies: polyclonal rabbit anti-GluR2 or polyclonal
goat anti-NR2 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX,
USA). Subsequent antibody detection was carried out with
secondary antibodies: TR-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG or
FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:100; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc). After rinsing three times with PBS, the cells

were mounted with a fluorescent mounting medium (Biyuntian,
China). Expression of GluR2 and NR2 was observed under an
immunofluorescence microscope (Olympus, BX51, Olympus
Optical Co., Ltd).
Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software was used to determine the density
of their expression.

Data Analysis
Data were presented as mean  SD. Statistical significance was
assessed using one-way ANOVA analysis and LSD test (in vitro
experiment) or Student’s t-test (in vivo experiment) with
P < 0.05 considered significant. Origin 5.1 and SPSS 19.1 were
applied to analyze the data.

group (Figure 1B, P < 0.01). TPEN group exhibited significant
decrease in infarction area, compared to the control group (Figure 1C–E, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).

TPEN Inhibited Neuron Apoptosis in Acutely
Ischemic Rat Brain
As shown in reprehensive images (Figure 2A) and summarized
quantitative results (Figure 2B), the number of apoptotic neurons
in TPEN group was significantly lower than in control group
(P < 0.05).

TPEN Upregulated GluR2 Expression in Acutely
Ischemic Rat Brain
As shown in Figure 3, the expression of GluR2 was upregulated
(Figure 3A) in TPEN-treated group compared to the control group
(Figure 3B, P < 0.05).

TPEN Reversed the Changes in Blood MDA, SOD,
NOS, and IL-6 in Acutely Ischemic Rats
Next, we evaluated the levels of blood MDA, SOD, NOS, and IL-6
in acutely ischemic rats (Figure 4). Compared to the control
group, TPEN treatment significantly decreased blood MDA concentration (Figure 4A, P < 0.05), total NOS (TNOS) (Figure 4C,
p < 0.05), and IL-6 concentration (Figure 4E, P < 0.05), but

W.-M. Wang et al.

increased blood SOD activity (Figure 4B, P < 0.05). The level of
iNOS activity remained unchanged (Figure 4D, P > 0.05).

TPEN Reversed Death and Apoptosis Caused by
Hypoxia/ischemia in PC12 Cells
The effect of hypoxia/ischemia, Zn2+, and TPEN on death or apoptosis in PC12 cells was shown in Figure 5. Immunofluorescence
microscopic images clearly showed that OGD-induced hypoxia/
ischemia increased the death rate in PC12 cells with a time-dependent manner (at 3 and 6 h) and was exacerbated by adding Zn2+
(50 lM). TPEN partially attenuated the death rate enhanced by
OGD or OGD plus high Zn2+ at both 3 h and 6 h (Figure 5A and
B). Particularly, at 3 h, compared with OGD, OGD+TPEN50 and
OGD+TPEN80 both significantly increased relative cell survival
ratio (P < 0.01), whereas OGD+Zn significantly decreased relative
cell survival ratio (P < 0.01), OGD+Zn+TPEN50 did not show significant difference (P > 0.05). Compared with OGD+Zn,
OGD+Zn+TPEN50 also significantly increased relative cell survival
ratio (P < 0.01). And at 6 h, compared with OGD, OGD+TPEN50
and OGD+TPEN80, respectively, increased relative cell survival
ratio (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05), whereas OGD+Zn and OGD+Zn+TPEN50 decreased relative cell survival ratio (P < 0.01). TPEN did
not decrease cell death rate induced synergistically by OGD plus
Zn2+ after long-time treatment (6 h). In addition, the apoptotic
rate in PC12 (green nuclei) was evaluated by TUNEL assay in different treatment group (Figure 5C). These results indicate that
OGD time-dependently enhanced the apoptotic rate in PC12 cells,

which were further aggravated by adding Zn2+. TPEN partially
attenuated the apoptotic rate enhanced by OGD (with or without
Zn2+).

TPEN Reversed the Changes of Intracellular
GluR2 and NR2 Expression in PC12 Cells Induced
by Hypoxia/ischemia
As shown in Figure 6, TPEN reversed changes of intracellular
GluR2 and NR2 expression in PC12 cells induced by hypoxia/
ischemia. GluR2 expression (Figure 6A & B) was decreased by
hypoxia/ischemia (at both 3 h and 6 h, OGD vs. Control,
P < 0.05), Zn2+ exacerbated the effect of OGD (at 3 h, OGD+Zn
vs. OGD, P < 0.05), while TPEN reversed the decrease induced by
OGD (at 3 h and 6 h, OGD+TPEN vs. OGD, P < 0.05, OGD+Zn+TPEN vs. OGD+Zn, P < 0.01). Figure 6C and D showed intracellular
NR2 expression status of every treatment for 3 h and 6 h. NR2
expression (Figure 6C & D) was increased by hypoxia/ischemia
(at 3 h, OGD vs. Control, P < 0.05; at 6 h, OGD vs. Control,
P < 0.01). Zn2+ exacerbated the effect of OGD (at 3 h, OGD+Zn
vs. OGD, P < 0.05; at 6 h, OGD+Zn vs. OGD, P < 0.01), whereas
TPEN reversed the increase induced by OGD (at 3 h, OGD+TPEN
vs. OGD, P < 0.05, at 6 h, OGD+TPEN vs. OGD, P < 0.01), but did
not reverse the increase induced by synergistic effect of OGD plus
Zn2+(at 3 h and 6 h, OGD+Zn+TPEN vs. OGD+Zn, P > 0.05).

physiological roles in cognition [32–34], brain development [35],
sensory [36], behavior, and emotion [21,37]. On the other hand,
Zn2+ is implicated directly or indirectly in the pathogenesis of
numerous neurological diseases including Alzheimer’s disease,
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, depression, epilepsy, ischemia, and
schizophrenia [21]. As Koh et al. found that extracellular free
Zn2+ may be involved in neuronal death in brain after transient
global cerebral ischemia [38], there has accumulated a large
amount of data showing the significance of Zn2+ in generating
ischemic degenerative events following cerebral stroke [18,20–
22]. In present study, we have observed that TPEN, a Zn2+ chelator significantly attenuates the neurological deficit and brain
infarction area in acute ischemic rat brains. The results were in
good agreement with those recently reported by Zhao et al. [39]
It has been determined that, during neurotransmission in glutamatergic neurons, Zn2+ and glutamate are co-released into the
synaptic cleft [14]. It is also recognized that Zn2+ influx from the
extracellular space and its mobilization from intracellular pools
such as mitochondria, cytosolic Zn2+ binding proteins, and lysosomes lead to neuronal damage because of hypoxia/ischemia [18–
22]. Excessive cytosolic Zn2+ can also be deleterious to neurons
[18,20,23,24], suggesting that tight regulation of Zn2+ homeostasis

(A)

is crucial for neuronal survival. Some experimental data have
indicated that neuronal damage by hypoxia/ischemia might be
mediated by high free Zn2+-induced neuronal apoptosis [24–26].
The results of our present experiments provide further evidence
supporting this notion. Our in vivo experiments demonstrated that
TPEN treatment decreases the neuronal apoptosis in acutely
ischemic rat brains. Furthermore, our in vitro experiments indicated that OGD resulted in asynchronous increase of death and
apoptosis in PC12 cells, which are further exacerbated by adding
Zn2+, whereas TPEN (a chelator of Zn2+) treatment significantly
reduced death and apoptosis rate of cells caused by OGD or OGD
plus Zn2+ treatment (in a time-dependent manner). Based on previous reports on TPEN’s effect on Zn2+ chelation in neuronal system [19], we selected the dosage of 50 and 80 lM for TPEN in our
current study. As no difference was found in the death rate of cells
between TPEN 50 lM group and 80 lM group, it was likely that
TPEN at 50 lM could produce the maximal protective action.
The mechanisms for the ischemia-induced neuronal damage
have been accounted for by complex factors such as oxidative
stress [6,40], excitotoxicity [11,41,42], inflammation [12,13], etc.
In the present study, our in vivo experiments demonstrated that
TPEN treatment enhanced brain GluR2 expression, decreased

blood MDA and IL-6 contents and NOS activity, increased blood
SOD activity in acute ischemic rat. Our in vitro experiments indicated that OGD resulted in decrease of GluR2 expression and
increase of NR2 expression in PC12 cells. Plus Zn2+ further exacerbated the decrease of GluR2 expression and increase of NR2
expression in PC12 cells, whereas TPTN treatment significantly
attenuated the decrease of GluR2 expression and increase of NR2
expression caused by OGD and OGD+ Zn2+ in the cells. GluR2 and
NR2 are subunits of AMPA receptor and NMDA receptor, respectively, and both AMPA receptor and NMDA receptor are ionotropic glutamate receptors which mediate signal transduction of
glutamate. Glutamate produces its excitotoxicity by inducing
influx of Ca2+ and Na+ via AMPA receptor and NMDA receptor
[43,44]. Whereas GluR2 might decrease the excitotoxicity of glutamate by inhibiting Ca2+ permeability of AMPA receptor, NR2
increases the excitotoxicity of glutamate by facilitating Na+ permeability of NMDA receptor [45–47]. GluR1 is also important subunits of AMPA receptor and is involved in its open probability. It has
been reported that GluR1 may correlate with the development of
early global ischemia in rat [48]. It remains to be studied whether
TPEN treatment affects GluR1 expression in our current model.
MDA,SOD, and NOS are all biomarkers of oxidative stress [49–
51], whereas IL-6 is a cytokine and plays an important role in

immune modulation and inflammation reaction [52]. In fact,
previous studies were, respectively, correlated to free Zn2+ with
oxidative stress and excitotoxicity during hypoxia/ischemia
[20,53–58]. Our present study provides potential links between
free Zn2+, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and inflammation reaction in neuronal damages during hypoxia/ischemia.
During the preparation of our present article, an excellent study
has recently published by Zhao et al., who reported that reducing
zinc accumulation by TPEN rescued neurons from ischemiainduced apoptotic death by reducing poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 activation in a in vivo model [39]. Our present study in both
in vitro and in vivo models has further provided supportive evidence for the hypothesis that TPEN protects neurons from ischemia-induced injuries by reducing free Zn2+ and consequently
preventing cell death mediated by excitotoxicity, oxidative stress,
inflammation, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 activation
[39]. We understand this is still a hot research topic, and many
controversial issues remain. Future studies on cellular and ionic
mechanisms, such as specific effects of Zn2+ on ion transportation,
are needed. In addition, some results obtained from in vitro experiments have provided supportive pathophysiological evidence
(such as cell apoptosis and GluR2 expression influenced by TPEN)
for in vivo experiment results at cellular level, and some results

from in vitro experiment (such as cell death ratio and NR2 expression influenced by TPEN) need to be confirmed by in vivo experiment. However, comprehensive in vivo and in vitro experimental
evidence might be helpful to clarify that TPEN, the zinc ion chelating agent can mediate the pathophysiological cascade caused by
hypoxia/ischemia.
It has been known that gender differences exist in cardiovascular and renal diseases in human and animal models, including in
spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Male SHR have higher
blood pressures than females. This difference is likely mediated via
a mechanism involving the androgen receptor and the renin–
angiotensin system [59–61]. In addition, gender difference has
also been found in brain damage during experimental focal ischemia in rats [62]. Therefore, to avoid any potential interference
caused by above-mentioned gender difference, we used only
female rats in our current study.
Based on comprehensive results obtained from our present study
including in vivo and in vitro experiments, we conclude that extra
free Zn2+ may trigger pathophysiological cascade reactions including oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and inflammation reaction during hypoxia/ischemia and consequently induce the cerebral
infarction and the neurological deficit in animals and human.
Meanwhile, we understand our results were somehow descriptive
and further mechanistic studies are warranted in the further study.

Limitation
Please note that we injected TPEN directly via intracerebroventricular administration by applying stereotaxic apparatus. TPEN has
been well recognized as specific Zn2+ chelator by previous works
[63,64]. Although we did not measure the zinc concentrations in
the blood, brain tissue, and its supernatant, we believe TPEN
should reach the stroke lesion and produce its effect, as evidenced
by the biochemical/functional results obtained. In addition,
although we have provided the change of the cerebral infarct size
which is one of brain pathological changes, more studies on brain
pathological changes such as brain tissue histology might be helpful to clarify the effect of locally applied Zn2+ chelating agent TPEN
on brain protection.
