Abstract Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) has been approved clinically for treating cardiac patients in China since
2005. Recent studies have indicated that HSYA may be neuroprotective at 24 h in experimental stroke models. Autophagy
is a vital degradation pathway of damaged intracellular macromolecules or organelles to maintain homeostasis in physiological or pathological conditions. The purpose of this study is
to investigate the neuroprotection of HSYA at 72 h and its
mechanism via activating the autophagy pathway using an
acute ischemic-reperfusion stroke rat model. Rats were treated
with HSYA (2 mg/kg) during 90 min middle cerebral artery
occlusion/72 h reperfusion by intravenous administration at
four different time points (15 min post-ischemia, 15 min, 24 h,
and 48 h post reperfusion), mimicking the potential treatment
for acute ischemic stroke. HSYA administration reduced infarction volume and improved various neurological functions
at 72 h of reperfusion. The possible molecular mechanism was
investigated. We found that HSYA activated the AKTautophagy pathway in penumbra tissue, which occurred in
neuronal-specific cells. Moreover, blocking the AKTautophagy pathway by an AKT inhibitor abolished HSYAinduced neuroprotection after cerebral ischemia. HSYA may

Neuroprotection

Introduction
Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) is the water-extracted fraction from the flower of the safflower plant (Carthamus
tinctorius L), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine with a
long history of treating ischemic diseases. Experimental and
clinical researches have shown that HSYA has good therapeutic effects on cardiac ischemia due to its multiple properties,
such as anti-thrombotic, anti-platelet aggregation, and antioxidative stress [1–4]. In 2005, HSYA was approved for
clinical use in patients with cardiac diseases, including acute
cardiac infarction, coronary heart disease, and angina pectoris,
by the State Food and Drug Administration of China (drug
permit document: Z20050146).
Recent studies, derived from the short-term results (at
24 h after occlusion), have indicated that HSYA application
was neuroprotective in middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) rat models after permanent [5–7] or transient
ischemia [8, 9]. These studies provide initial evidence that
HSYA might be a good candidate to be repurposed for
treating cerebral ischemia. However, it is still unknown
whether HSYA would confer neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury under clinically relevant
conditions, particularly beyond 24 h. Moreover, the possible mechanism of how HSYA may protect the ischemic
brain is not fully understood.

Autophagy is a vital degradation pathway of intracellular
macromolecules or organelles (such as damaged mitochondria) for subsequent reuse that helps to maintain intracellular
homeostasis in physiological or pathological conditions, including inflammation, malignancy, and neurodegeneration
[10–13]. Recent studies from our and other groups indicated
that autophagy contributed to the neuroprotection afforded by
repetitive ischemic conditioning [14, 15]. Moreover, autophagy has been reported to reduce oxidative damage and inhibit
the downstream of mitochondrial apoptosis in ischemic diseases [16, 17]. It has also been shown that HSYA significantly
inhibits calcium- and H2O2-induced oxidative stress in mitochondria, isolated from the rat brain [18]. These findings
provide a link between autophagy and HSYA-induced neuroprotection; therefore, we hypothesize that HSYA may confer
its beneficial effect in the ischemic brain through activating
the autophagy pathway.
In the present study, we tested this hypothesis by investigating whether HSYA would show a neuroprotective effect in
a rat ischemic stroke model with 90 min ischemia/72 h reperfusion using the treatment regimen that is currently applied to
heart disease. We further investigated the possible molecular
mechanisms associated with the AKT-autophagy pathway in
this HSYA-treated stroke model.

Methods
MCAO Model
All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Capital Medical University (Beijing, China) and were in accordance with the principles outlined in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals.
Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 290 to 320 g were
subjected to MCAO surgical procedures as we previously
described [14]. Briefly, the right external carotid artery
(ECA), internal carotid artery (ICA), and pterygopalatine artery of the ICA were exposed. Occlusion was conducted by
inserting a nylon suture with a diameter of 0.38 mm into the
ICA via a slit on the ECA. The suture was advanced along the
ICA to 18–19 mm from the bifurcation and maintained in
position for 90 min. Reperfusion was produced by gently
withdrawing the suture until the suture tip reached the bifurcation. Successful MCAO and reperfusion were confirmed by
laser Doppler flowmetry (PeriFlux System 5000, Perimed,
Stockholm, Sweden).
HSYA Administration
The purified powder of HSYA (>99 %) was supplied by
Zhejiang Yongning Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Zhejiang,

Transl. Stroke Res. (2014) 5:501–509

China) and was dissolved in saline. All rats were subjected
to 90 min MCAO followed by 72 h reperfusion. After the
onset of MCAO, the rats were randomly divided into two
groups: treatment with HSYA or saline (control). The recommended clinical dose of HSYA is 100 mg (approximately
2 mg/kg) once a day for common cases or twice a day for
severe cardiac patients. Therefore, to mimic the current clinical treatment regimen, we chose to treat the ischemic rats with
HSYA at a dose of 2 mg/kg or saline by injecting the drug
through tail vein twice during the first day and once each day
for the following 2 days (15 min after onset of ischemia,
15 min after onset of reperfusion, and 24 and 48 h of reperfusion). Additionally, we carried out some preliminary testing
and found that the dose of 2 mg/kg was the lowest dose that
produced a beneficial effect in our ischemic stroke model
system. It is also noted that the dose of 2 mg/kg was at low
end of effective dose range, based on published animal stroke
studies at 24 h reperfusion [5, 8, 9].
Measurement of Neurological Deficits
Neurological deficits were assessed at 24, 48, and 72 h after
reperfusion in a double-blind fashion using the method of
Ludmila Belayev [19] and foot-fault tests [20]. Briefly, for
the Ludmila Belayev score, neurological function was graded
on a scale of 0–12, with 0 representing normal function and 12
representing maximum neurological deficits. For the footfault test, rats were placed on and traversed along a 110-cm
length platform with 9×9 cm2 grids. The number of times the
forelimb fell into the grids within 1 min was counted to reflect
neurological function deficits.
Brain Tissue Collection for Assays and Infarction
Measurement
Brain tissue was collected at 72 h after reperfusion for infarction measurement, Western blotting and immunostaining. After transcardial perfusion with PBS, rats were killed, and the
brains were removed and sectioned into five 2-mm-thick
coronal slices from a 10-mm-thick region, 3 mm away from
the tip of the frontal lobe. The slices were stained with 1.5 %
5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma) for infarction measurement, as describe in our previous study [14]. The
ischemic penumbra and core positions were predetermined as
described in detail in our previous reports [21, 22]. Briefly, by
TTC stain of sectioned brain, we compared the different
infarction areas resulting from various durations of focal ischemia and reperfusion (30, 60, or 90 ischemia with 24
reperfusion, plus permanent ischemia for 24 h). The differences in infarction area between those groups were considered
as the penumbra, and the 24-h permanent ischemia group was
used to demonstrate the maximum ischemically compromised
area after middle cerebral artery occlusion. This penumbra

blotting, while the fifth slice was used for immunostaining.

specific marker 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Alternate sections from each brain sample were incubated without
the primary antibodies as negative controls.

Western Blotting Analysis

Assessment of Autophagy Level

The penumbral portion of the third slices was homogenized
and prepared for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, as previously described [14]. Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting were as follows: anti-p-S473-AKT (1:1000), antilight chain-3 (LC3) (1:1000), and anti-β-actin (1:1000) were
from Cell Signaling Technology (USA). HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1:5000) were from Chemicon (USA).

Microtubule-associated protein LC3 undergoes successive
modification to form LC3-I and phosphatidylethanolamineconjugated LC3-II that is specifically targeted to
autophagosome membranes [23]. Here, we evaluated the autophagy level using two methods. First, the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio
was determined in each condition by Western blotting. Next,
the number of LC3-positive puncta was assessed by immunostaining as a measure of the autophagy level. To identify the
type of cells that autophagosomes were located, slices were
also triple labeled with anti-LC3, neuron-specific marker
(NeuN), and nuclear-specific marker (DAPI).

Immunohistochemistry Staining
The fifth slice was fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and
dehydrated in 30 % sucrose for immonohistochemistry staining as detailed in the previous study [14]. Twenty micron thick
cryostat sections were obtained and stained with anti-LC3
(1:150; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Neuron-Specific Nuclear Protein (NeuN, 1:50; Millipore, USA), and nuclear-

AKT Inhibition
To determine whether HSYA-afforded neuroprotection was mediated through the AKT-related autophagy pathway, an AKT
inhibitor (LY294002) was used to pretreat the animal to reduce
the AKT-related autophagy level before ischemia. Animals were
divided into four groups: DMSO + saline (n=6), AKTi + saline
(n=5), DMSO + HSYA (n=7), and AKTi + HSYA (n=7). The
AKT inhibitor LY294002 (15 μM in 10 μL, Sigma, USA) or
DMSO (vehicle control) was microinjected into the lateral ventricle 30 min prior to MCAO surgery. Stereotaxic coordinates
for injection were bregma posterior (P) −1 mm; lateral (L)
±1.5 mm; and ventral (V) −4.0 mm from the dura, with the
tooth bar set at 0 mm. After MCAO surgery, physiological saline
with or without HSYA were given accordingly.

Results
HSYA Reduces Infarction Volume and Improves
Neurological Functions
In order to ascertain the neuroprotection of HSYA for ischemic stroke, cerebral infarction was assessed using TTCstained brain slices at 72 h of reperfusion. The typical TTC
staining was shown in Fig. 1a. In comparison with the saline
group (vehicle control), the infarct volume in HSYA group
was significantly reduced with a quantitative analysis of infarct volume showing a significant difference between the
saline (45.77±2.67 %) and HSYA groups (35.15±3.37 %)
(Fig. 1b).
To assess the clinical outcome of the treatment with HSYA,
neurological functions were evaluated at 24, 48, and 72 h post
reperfusion using two separate methods: the Ludmila Belayev

neurological scores and foot-fault test. Neurological scores
(Fig. 2a) indicated that HSYA treatment significantly improved neurological functions both at 48 h (saline; 7.50±
0.62 and HSYA; 5.33±0.56) and 72 h (saline; 7.22±0.46
and HSYA; 5.44±0.38). The foot-fault test (Fig. 2b) also
showed that the number of times the forelimb fell into the
grids at 72 h were markedly decreased in HSYA (saline; 8.33
±0.52 and HSYA; 4.89±0.75) compared to the saline group. It
is noted that two out of ten rats died in saline and HSYA
groups, respectively. These results suggest that using the
treatment regimen HSYA can indeed reduce infarction and
improve neurological functions at 72 h of reperfusion in an
ischemic stroke rat model.

group compared with the saline group (saline; 7.75±0.63 and
HSYA; 14.75±2.25, Fig. 3c). The levels of autophagy were
further investigated by immunostaining. As the number of
autophagosomes in cytosol represents the level of autophagy,
we also measured the number of LC3-positive puncta
(autophagosomes) by immunostaining to confirm the changes
in autophagy level with or without HSYA (Fig. 3d). The
immunostaining from penumbra showed that the number of
cells with LC3-positive puncta inside (arrows) the cytosol
increased in HSYA group (Fig. 3d(b)) compared with saline
group. The image in the dashed-line rectangle in Fig. 3d(b)
was magnified and shown in Fig. 3d(c), illustrating the LC3positive puncta (arrow heads) inside the cell in HSYA-treated
tissues. These results suggest that HSYA treatment can activate AKT-related autophagy in penumbra, which might be
involved in the mechanisms of the HSYA-afforded neuroprotection in this HSYA-treatment model.

As AKT-related autophagy has been proposed to be an important protective mechanism in cerebral ischemia, we investigated whether the AKT-autophagy pathway is involved in
the HSYA-based neuroprotection. For this purpose, the levels
of S473-phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) in the penumbra were
determined at 72 h reperfusion by Western blotting (Fig. 3a).
Quantitative evaluation demonstrated that the p-AKT level in
the penumbra significantly increased in HSYA rats when
compared to saline group (Fig. 3b). The level of autophagy
in the penumbra at 72 h reperfusion was also assessed by
Western blotting of LC3 (Fig. 3a). Statistic analysis revealed a
significant increase in the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio in the HSYA

To identify the specific type of cells in which autophagy was
occurring, we measured the immunochemical staining signals
for autophagy and neuron in penumbra by tripleimmunolabelling with LC3 (red, Fig. 4a), neuron-specific marker NeuN (green, Fig. 4b), and nuclear-specific marker DAPI
(blue). The merged image shown in Fig. 4c demonstrated that
LC3-positive puncta exists in the NeuN-specific cells (arrows).

neuron-specific marker NeuN (green, b), and nuclear-specific marker

DAPI (blue). The merged image was shown in (c). Cells with LC3positive puncta inside were co-localized with NeuN-positive cells

cells that were colocalized with NeuN staining cells in three
×200 high power fields from three animals of HSYA group. The
percentage of LC3-NeuN colocalized cells in the whole LC3
positive ones was found to be 87±6.8 %. These results suggest
that HSYA promotes autophagosomes formation in neuronal
cells in penumbra. This finding further indicates that AKTrelated autophagy might play an important role in neuronal
protection in HSYA-treatment in stroke.
Blocking the AKT-Autophagy Pathway by AKT Inhibitor
Partially Suppresses HSYA-Afforded Neuroprotection
after Cerebral Ischemia
To determine whether HSYA treatment-induced up-regulation
of the AKT-related autophagy pathway is actually responsible
for HSYA-afforded neuroprotection in ischemic stroke, animals were pretreated with AKT inhibitor (LY294002) to block
AKT-related autophagy. Western blotting results showed that

treatment with AKT inhibitor significantly reduced the transform of LC3I to LC3II (Fig. 5a). The p-AKT level was downregulated in AKTi groups, showing inhibitory effect of AKTi.
LC3-II/LC3-I ratio indicated that DMSO + HSYA treatment
significantly increased the autophagy level in penumbra in
comparison to DMSO + saline group, which was partially
suppressed in AKTi + HSYA group (DMSO + saline; 11.97 ±
0.52, AKTi + saline; 10.93±1.08, DMSO + HSYA; 15.52±
1.07, and AKTi + HSYA; 11.26±0.74, Fig. 5b). The immunostaining of p-AKT and LC3 illustrated that the density of pAKT and LC3 increased in DMSO + HSYA group, but
partially reversed with AKT inhibitor treatment (Fig. 5c).
The typical TTC staining was shown in Fig. 6a, and statistical
analysis demonstrated that while HSYA treatment markedly
decreased infarction volume from control, blocking the AKTautophagy pathway with AKT inhibitor partially abolished the
protective effect of HSYA (Fig. 6b). Neurological functions
using the Ludmila Belayev neurological scores (Fig. 6c) and
foot-fault test (Fig. 6d) indicated that HSYA treatment significantly improved neurological functions at 72 h, which were

Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability. Over the last
several decades, research has failed to translate over 1,000
experimental neuroprotective treatments from discovery in
laboratories to clinical applications [24], which has been
fraught with huge cost and spectacular disappointment. The
safflower plant (C. tinctorius L.), a traditional Chinese herbal

medicine, has a long history for treating ischemic diseases due
to its property of “invigorating the circulation and reducing
stasis” [25]. Moreover, HSYA, the water-extracted fraction
from the flower of the safflower plant, has been clinically
proven to be efficacious in treating patients with cardiac
diseases in China since 2005, as HSYA may inhibit thrombosis formation and platelet aggregation [4, 26, 27]. However, an
important question is whether the treatment regimen used for
cardiac diseases would produce a positive outcome in an
ischemic stroke animal model, lasting beyond 24 h. In this
study, we designed a protocol using a low dose (2 mg/kg) of
HSYA, with repetitive treatment (given twice at the first day
and once daily for the following 2 days) to mimic a possible
treatment for stroke patients. Our results demonstrate that
when assessed at 72 h following reperfusion, HSYA treatment
not only reduced the brain infarction volume (Fig. 1), but also

partially reversed by AKT inhibitor. These results suggest that
the activation of AKT-related autophagy pathway plays a key
role in the mechanism of the HSYA-afforded neuroprotection
in ischemic stroke. It is noted that the mortality was 1/7, 1/6,
1/8, and 1/8 in DMSO + saline, AKTi + saline, DMSO +
HSYA, and AKTi + HSYA groups, respectively.

significantly improved the neurological functions, as shown
by both the neurological score and the foot-fault test (Fig. 2).
This is the first report in an ischemic stroke model showing
that a low dose HSYA treatment with a similar regimen used
for cardiac patients produces a positive outcome beyond 24 h.
This finding provides direct evidence supporting the notion
that HSYA could be a very promising candidate to be
repurposed for acute ischemic stroke. Further studies are
warranted to explore the long-term efficacy (several weeks
or months) of HSYA, therapeutic time window, particularly
administration at times (hours) after stroke onset, as well as
the optimal dose and treatment regimen that would produce
the best outcome.
In this study, we further investigated the molecular basis
on HSYA-afforded neuroprotection. Autophagy is an important cell clearance system for degrading wastes or impaired organelles into micromolecules for reuse. Recent
studies suggested that autophagy is an important arbiter of
cell death-survival decisions by degrading these harmful
aggregates and organelles, and contributes to the neuroprotection afforded by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase
[28] and ischemic conditioning [14, 15]. Herein, we investigated whether autophagy was involved in the HSYAafforded neuroprotection after cerebral ischemia. Our results
demonstrate that autophagy is promoted in the penumbra of
cerebral ischemic rats with HSYA treatment (Fig. 3). Furthermore, our results show that HSYA-induced autophagy
is triggered in neurons (NeuN-specific cells) of the penumbra. This finding is consistent with Tian’s report [29] that
when using a live green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused
LC3 transgenic mouse model with 60 min transient cerebral
ischemia, the GFP-LC3-positive cells of the peri-ischemic
area were primarily neuronal, not astro- or microglial. The
findings from our study suggest that autophagy may be
critically important in HSYA-afforded neuroprotection, especially in the regulation of neuronal function in penumbra.
Although autophagy is well known as being involved in
type II cell death, the protective role of autophagy has been
shown recently in cerebral ischemia [15, 28, 30]. In this study,
we investigated whether the AKT-autophagy pathway contributed to HSYA-afforded neuroprotection after stroke, particularly in penumbral tissues. Our results show that ischemic/
reperfusion-induced infarction volume is attenuated by
HSYA. However, the neuroprotection was partially abolished
when the up-regulated autophagy was suppressed with an
AKT inhibitor LY294002, indicating that the inhibition of
the AKT-autophagy pathway would reduce HSYA-induced
efficacy of neuroprotection. This result suggests that AKTdependent autophagy may be an important protective mechanism in HSYA-based neuroprotection after stroke, but how
HSYA-upregulated autophagy level reduces ischemic injury is
still unclear. It was reported that HSYA may attenuate Ca2+- or
H 2 O 2 -induced swelling and energy deprivation in

Transl. Stroke Res. (2014) 5:501–509

mitochondria that was isolated from rat brain [18]. As autophagy is the most important pathway to clear the injured mitochondria, it is likely that autophagy promoted by HSYA
treatment might protect neurons by accelerating the clearance
of wastes or harmful signals. In addition, autophagy may
facilitate macromolecule degradation to compensate for the
depletion of energy in brain tissue after stroke. Obviously, the
exact protective mechanism of autophagy in HSYA needs to
be further elucidated.
In conclusion, this study shows that treatment of HSYA in
an ischemic stroke rat model using the clinical regimen for
cardiac diseases produced significant neuroprotective efficacy
at 72 h reperfusion as demonstrated by the improvement in
both infarct volume and neurological function. AKTdependent autophagy, which is promoted in the penumbra of
cerebral ischemic rats with HSYA treatment, may contribute
to HSYA-afforded neuroprotection in penumbra tissue. Our
study suggests that HSYA may be a promising drug to treat
acute ischemic stroke.
