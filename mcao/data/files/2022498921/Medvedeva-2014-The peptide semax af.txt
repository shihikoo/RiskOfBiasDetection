Abstract
Background: The nootropic neuroprotective peptide Semax (Met-Glu-His-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro) has proved efficient in
the therapy of brain stroke; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its action remain obscure. Our
genome-wide study was designed to investigate the response of the transcriptome of ischemized rat brain cortex
tissues to the action of Semax in vivo.
Results: The gene-expression alteration caused by the action of the peptide Semax was compared with the gene
expression of the “ischemia” group animals at 3 and 24 h after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
(pMCAO). The peptide predominantly enhanced the expression of genes related to the immune system. Three
hours after pMCAO, Semax influenced the expression of some genes that affect the activity of immune cells, and,
24 h after pMCAO, the action of Semax on the immune response increased considerably. The genes implicated in
this response represented over 50% of the total number of genes that exhibited Semax-induced altered expression.
Among the immune-response genes, the expression of which was modulated by Semax, genes that encode
immunoglobulins and chemokines formed the most notable groups.
In response to Semax administration, 24 genes related to the vascular system exhibited altered expression 3 h after
pMCAO, whereas 12 genes were changed 24 h after pMCAO. These genes are associated with such processes as
the development and migration of endothelial tissue, the migration of smooth muscle cells, hematopoiesis, and
vasculogenesis.
Conclusions: Semax affects several biological processes involved in the function of various systems. The immune
response is the process most markedly affected by the drug. Semax altered the expression of genes that modulate
the amount and mobility of immune cells and enhanced the expression of genes that encode chemokines and
immunoglobulins. In conditions of rat brain focal ischemia, Semax influenced the expression of genes that promote
the formation and functioning of the vascular system.
The immunomodulating effect of the peptide discovered in our research and its impact on the vascular system
during ischemia are likely to be the key mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of the peptide.

Background
Ischemic brain stroke is one of the major contributors to
mortality and disability worldwide. As the result of a
critical reduction of blood flow in the brain, it causes
massive loss of neurons and leads to the formation of
the necrotic core and the penumbra zone [1].
One of the drugs that is effectively employed currently
in cerebral stroke therapy is the Semax (Met-Glu-HisPhe-Pro-Gly-Pro), which is a synthetic peptide consisting
of a fragment of ACTH(4–7) and the C-terminal tripeptide Pro-Gly-Pro (PGP). Studies have shown that Semax
promotes the survival of neurons during hypoxia [2]
and glutamate neurotoxicity [3]. It also shows neuroprotective properties and contributes to mitochondrial stability under stress induced by the deregulation of calcium
ion flow [3]. The action of Semax causes the inhibition of
nitric oxide synthesis [4], improves the trophic supply of
the brain [5], and protects the nervous system effectively
against diseases of the optic nerve [6]. This peptide also
possesses nootropic activity [7].
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
action of Semax remain unclear. We have previously
shown the effect of Semax on the expression of genes
that encode neurotrophic factors and their receptors in
an experimental model ischemia in the rat brain [8,9].
This genome-wide study was performed to elucidate
the transcriptome response of the ischemized focal tissues of the rat brain to the action of Semax in vivo. The
main task of our study was to identify genes with an altered expression that accounts for the positive effect
exerted by Semax in the treatment of patients with ischemic stroke [10,11].
Results
Semax-induced increase and decrease in gene expression

The genome-wide expression changes induced by Semax
in rat brain cortex tissues damaged by focal ischemia
were studied using the genome-wide RatRef-12 Expression BeadChip (Illumina, USA), which contains 22,226
genes, according to NCBI. Data on the gene expression
changes induced by the peptide were compared with the
gene expression levels in the “ischemia” group at 3 and
24 h after pMCAO.
The largest number of genes (96) that exhibited altered expression (cut-off 1.50) in response to Semax administration was detected 3 h after the onset of ischemia
(Additional file 1); moreover, the amount of the genes
with decreased expression was insignificantly larger than
that of those with increased expression (Figure 1).
Semax altered the expression of 68 genes 24 h after occlusion (Additional file 2): the expression of 51 genes
was increased and the amount of genes with decreased
expression was considerably lower than that observed at
3 h after the onset of ischemia.

shows the condition of the experiment and time after pMCAO.
The y-axis represents the number of genes that exhibited changed
expression in these conditions. The cut-off of gene-expression
changes was 1.50.

Note that different gene groups exhibited Semax-induced
alteration of expression at 3 h and 24 h. The overlapping
group comprised only 10 genes with responses to the
peptide that were contradictory (Table 1).
Molecular functions of the protein products of genes with
altered expression under Semax treatment

The grouping of the genes according to the molecular
functions of their products and to the iReport Web tool
revealed that the expression of transcription regulator
genes was predominantly enhanced, and that that of genes
encoding transmembrane receptors, transport proteins,
and various enzymes was decreased 3 h after the onset of
ischemia under Semax treatment (Figure 2A); about 39%
of the genes with altered expression encoded proteins with
molecular functions that were unrelated to the groups
presented or were not yet identified. Gene expression was
increased mostly at 24 h (Figure 2B). The largest increase
in expression was observed for immunoglobulin and cytokine (chiefly chemokine) genes (Table 2). The molecular
functions of 24% of the protein products of the genes that
exhibited altered expression levels were unknown.
Biological processes that were significantly associated
with the genes that exhibited altered expression levels in
response to the administration of the peptide

We used an online program [12] to analyze genes with
altered expression in response to the intermittent administration of Semax to ischemized animals. This led to
the identification of several biological processes that
were associated with the gene expression changes observed
(Figure 3). The reliability of these processes was calculated
by Fisher’s exact test.

The table shows the genes that exhibited significantly changed expression under Semax treatment at both time points (3 and 24 h). The logarithmic transformed
value visually represents the symmetric changes in expression levels: negative value indicates decrease and positive value – increase of the gene expression level.
The cut-off of gene-expression changes was 1.40. Ratio – relative expression level.

Three hours after pMCAO, Semax exerted considerable
influence on various general biological processes (proliferation, differentiation, and migration of cells), on vascular
system processes, brain cell processes, and on the immune
system (Figure 3A). Twenty-four hours after occlusion,
similar to observed effects 3 h after the procedure, Semax,
acting in conditions of focal ischemia, altered the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and migration.
One day after the occlusion, however, unlike at 3 h after
the procedure, additional processes supplemented the
general processes, namely, the organization of the cytoskeleton, tissue development, and the quantity of metal
(Figure 3B). Special attention should be drawn to the processes that were most significantly associated with immune cell activity and calcium ion regulation, namely, the
migration and attraction of dendritic cells (DCs), the attraction of leukocytes (Figure 3B), and the regulation of
the levels of Ca2+ (Figure 3B, Table 3).
Semax altered the expression of genes related to the
immune system to a large degree (Table 2). In conditions
of experimental focal ischemia, the action of Semax observed 3 h after the onset of ischemia influenced the expression of several genes that are involved in the regulation
of the activity of immune cells: macrophages, neutrophils,
and lymphocytes (Figure 3A). The effect of Semax on
the immune response was increased significantly 24 h
after pMCAO. The genes involved in this process represented over 50% of the total amount of the genes that
exhibited altered expression levels. Semax-induced upregulation of transcripts was observed for a majority of
the immune-response genes; among these, immunoglobulin genes formed the most prominent group, with
half of them exhibiting the highest amplitude of expression alteration among the genes for which the level of
transcripts was affected by the peptide (Table 2).

Another remarkable group of genes with Semax-induced
alteration in expression levels consisted of genes involved
in the vascular system. The expression of 24 and 12 genes
was altered 3 and 24 hours after pMCAO, respectively
(Table 4).
Genes that regulate the levels of Ca2+ formed a separate
group of genes exhibiting a significant Semax-induced
alteration of expression 24 h after occlusion (Table 3).

Discussion
Different profiles of gene expression elicited by Semax
administration 3 and 24 h after pMCAO

The dynamic state of mRNA expression in mammalian
tissues changes during pathophysiological processes and
after the introduction of medicinal peptides into the organism. In this context, we studied transcriptome changes
caused by the action of neuropeptide Semax in the ischemized rat brain cortex. This genome-wide study showed
that Semax affected the transcript level of several dozens
of genes 3 and 24 h after pMCAO; however, the functional
significance of many of them remains unknown.
Three hours after pMCAO was used in the analysis as
a time point inside the therapeutic window of the drug
and within the response time of early-response genes
[13]. At that time point, we found a considerable alteration of the expression of genes encoding transcription
factors that could set off new signal pathways that allow
the correction of the destructive processes that developed after vascular occlusion. During the active stage of
ischemia and the response of late-response genes, i.e.,
24 h after pMCAO, we observed increased levels of transcripts encoding transmembrane receptors and enzymes,
especially cytokines and immunoglobulins. One can presume that processes initiated by transcription factors
during the first hours of therapy of ischemized animals

were developing further. Several similar processes were
observed in the course of the associative analysis of biological processes.
Response of immune system cells to Semax
administration and regulation of the expression of genes
encoding chemokines and immunoglobulins

The detailed analysis of genes that exhibited altered
levels of expression 3 and 24 h after pMCAO allowed
the determination of the effect of Semax on various biological processes that were categorized under broad subgroups, namely, general category, brain cell, immune,
and vascular processes. The neuroprotective and nootropic properties of Semax were previously associated
only with events that are directly relevant to nervous tissues [2,7,11]. Here, we uncovered the action of Semax
on the immune system for the first time. Three hours
after pMCAO, Semax acted on microglia and immune
system cells. The process of leukocyte activation was affected most significantly (P-value = 7.6 × 10−8) in the immune response subgroup. The processes that developed
24 h after pMCAO, which involved leukocytes, remained
significant. In addition, Semax affected DCs, the presence of which in rat cerebral hemisphere ischemiadamaged tissues had been reported by other researchers
[14]. DCs constitute a heterogeneous class of antigenpresenting cells that are capable of immune response
initiation [15] and cytokine production [16].
Both inflammation and immune response play an important role in ischemic stroke. It is well known that the
penetration of inflammatory/immune cells into brain tissues during the postischemia hours aggravates the situation [17-19]. In addition, no data have been reported to
date indicating the presence of a specific cause-andeffect relationship between the penetration of leukocytes
into the damaged tissues and the pathogenesis of the ischemia itself [20]. However, some studies support the
neuroprotective abilities of immune cells [21,22].
It should be mentioned that the most noticeable immune response to Semax action was observed at 24 h
after pMCAO. A high level of immunoglobulin transcripts was found at that time point in the ischemized

rat brain cortex. Several studies had shown previously
that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has a strong
neuroprotective effect against ischemic impairment of
the brain [23]. It is believed that IVIG application is one
of the options for acute brain stroke therapy [24].
Whether or not the neuroprotective effect of Semax can
be a consequence of the enhancement of the expression
of immunoglobulin should be addressed in future
studies.
Cytokines (particularly chemokines), which are one of
the most important participants in the immune response, were also expressed actively 24 h after pMCAO
under the influence of Semax in the region of the brain
where the ischemic lesion was localized. Many reports
have described chemokine expression in astrocytes, microglia, and even neurons [25]. It is accepted that some
chemokines and their receptors are involved in various
neurodegenerative diseases [26], including ischemic
brain damage [27].
Recent research has shown that chemokines are a
unique class of neuromediators that ensure the crosstalk between neurons and cells from their surrounding
microenvironment [28]. In accordance with this, the
division of chemokines into pro- and anti-inflammatory
factors seems to be too simplified and gives rise to contradicting opinions regarding the neuroprotective and
neurodegenerative functions of chemokines [29]. Enhanced expression of chemokine-encoding genes is one
more evidence in favor of the possible existence of a
Semax immunomodulatory effect in conditions of focal
cerebral ischemia of the brain.
Semax-induced activation of chemokine genes presumably accounted for the altered transcript level of
genes associated with the regulation of the quantity of
Ca2+ (Figure 3B, Table 3). The ability of some chemokines to raise the level of intracellular Ca2+, which plays
a messenger role in nervous tissues, has been described
in several studies [30,31]. A study that used human neutrophils [32] offered experiment-based support of the effect of Semax on the Ca2+ level in cells, and showed an
increase in Ca2+ levels caused by the effect of Semax on
the mechanisms that regulate Ca2+-dependent channels.

It is well known that ischemia-induced energy depletion in cells results in disturbed operation of potentialdependent calcium channels and Na+/Ca2+ pumps, excessive intracellular accumulation of Ca2+ ions, and neuronal
death [33]. However, it has been shown that Semax

contributes to neuron survivability in the conditions of
glutamate neurotoxicity that accompany ischemia [3].
Some authors have suggested that cellular death is caused
by the Ca2+ influx pathway, and not by Ca2+ load [34].
Possibly, the neuroprotective effect of Semax on ischemia-

damaged nervous tissues includes the impact of Ca2+
penetration into the cell on the regulatory processes. This
idea is based on recent studies of the neuroprotective effect of Ca2+-activated potassium channels in conditions of
brain ischemic damage [35,36].
The opinions on the role of the immune system in the
pathogenesis of ischemia vary. Studies are available regarding the contribution of the immune system to ischemic damages [37], the neuroprotective and healing effect
of immune-cell activation [38,39], the protective role
of the immune system, and its therapeutic function
[40-42]. It cannot be ruled out that the observed effect
of Semax on brain stroke can be explained by its impact
on protective immune mechanisms. Some recent reports
have described interactions between nervous tissues and
the immune system, which were observed after the administration of neuropeptides. For instance, the nootropic medication cerebrolysin favored the survival of
immunocompetent cells [43]. Another preparation, the
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which has neurotrophic effects, acted as an immunomodulator [44]. The
possible effect of neuromodulation on the consequences
of ischemia is believed to be real, although it has not
been studied sufficiently [45].

Response of the vascular system to the administration of
the neuropeptide Semax

Here, we found changes in the expression levels of several genes involved in the functioning of the vascular
system as a response to Semax administration. The formation of new blood vessels in the ischemized areas represents one of the approaches used in the treatment of
brain stroke [46]. It should be mentioned that the presence of immune cells in the damaged tissues is a typical

feature of postischemic revascularization [47]. Three
hours after pMCAO, Semax affected the expression of
genes involved in vasculogenesis and the transcription
levels of genes associated with hematopoiesis and the
migration of endothelial cells. Some signal pathways are
well known to be active in both hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis [48]. Moreover, a large number of genes are
expressed in both endothelial cells and hematopoietic
precursor cells of the adult organism [49,50]. Three
hours after occlusion, Semax altered the expression of
genes associated with the artery vasodilation process as
well. Our earlier studies showed that capillary bore extension was observed as early as 15 min after the administration of the peptide [9].
As shown in Figure 3B, 24 h after occlusion, Semax
affected the development of the endothelial tissue and
the migration of smooth muscle cells, which was an indication of vessel formation and stabilization [48]. Finally, another biological process, i.e., the activation of
blood cells, was affected by Semax 24 h after pMCAO,
which followed logically after the process of the formation of blood cells induced by Semax 3 h after the
occlusion.
Thus, as demonstrated here, the action of Semax on
the expression of genes that ensure the formation and
functioning of the vascular system in ischemic conditions also uncovered its possible vascular and regenerative properties, in addition to its neuroprotective and
vasoactive effects.

Conclusions
In this study, we analyzed the action of the neuroprotective peptide Semax on the transcriptome of rat brain cortical cells in conditions of experimental focal ischemia.

Although Semax has been shown to be effective in brain
stroke therapy, the molecular mechanisms underlying its
neuroprotective action remain unknown.

As shown here, Semax influenced various biological
processes that contribute to the functioning of the different systems of the organism. The immune response was

Medvedeva et al. BMC Genomics 2014, 15:228
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/15/228

most markedly affected by the action of Semax. The
peptide increased the amount and mobility of immune
cells and enhanced the expression of chemokine and immunoglobulin genes.
Our data showed that Semax is likely to influence processes that accompany the formation of new blood vessels
during early ischemia cascade stages, as well as their
stabilization at later stages.
The expression of genes responsible for the intracellular
level of Ca2+ was sensitive to Semax administration
against the background of the unfolding pMCAO-induced
neurodegenerative processes. Our results showed that
Semax enhanced the expression of genes encoding protein
products that promote intracellular Ca2+ accumulation.
Possibly, the neuroprotective effect of Semax on ischemiadamaged nervous tissues includes an impact on processes
involved in the incorporation of Ca2+ into cells.
Thus, the immunomodulating effects of Semax described here, as well as its influence on the vascular system in conditions of ischemia, are likely to be key
factors in the neuroprotective effects of the peptide. It
cannot be ruled out that the large amount of genes that
exhibited changed levels of expression, the functions of
which remain unknown or not well studied, will help
disclose other, hitherto unknown pathways of Semax action on damaged brain tissues. We must state at the
same time that the baffling complexity of the multicomponent nature of cerebral ischemia and the ability of
Semax to affect a large number of biological processes
require future research to uncover the full scope of the
mechanisms of action of this peptide.

Methods
Animals

All experimental protocol were approved by Bioethics
Comission of Lomonosov Moscow State University in
accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publ.
no. 80–23, revised 1996). We used adult male Wistar
rats (270–320 g) maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle
at a temperature of 22–24°C with free access to food
and water.
Focal cerebral ischemia model

We applied the model of “focal cerebral ischemia” induced as previously described [51]. The irreversible electrical coagulation of the distal segment of the left middle
cerebral artery was performed under anesthesia with
chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg).
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by direct pMCAO,
involving craniotomy technique as previously described
[52] without occlusion of carotid artery. In detail, anesthesia
was induced by intraperitoneal administration of chloral
hydrate (400 mg/kg body weight). The left middle cerebral

Page 10 of 12

artery (MCA) was exposed via the transtemporal approach.
A 1.5 cm scalp incision was made at the midpoint between
the right eye and the right ear. The temporalis muscle was
separated in the plane of its fiber bundles and retracted in
order to expose the zygoma and squamosal bone. Using
microsurgical technques, a burr hole, 2 mm in diameter,
was made with a dental drill 1 mm rostal to the anterior
junction of the zygoma and the squamosal bone. The dura
mater was carefully pierced with a scalpel. The exposed
MCA was isolated and occluded by short coagulation
using a bipolar coagulator. The craniotomy was covered
with a small piece of gelfoam, the temporalis muscle and
overlying skin were allowed to fall back and were sutured
separately. After suturing, rats were returned to their
cages until sacrifice. The operation was last about 30 min.
Experimental groups

Animals were divided into two groups: (1) “ischemia”
and (2) “ischemia + Semax” groups. pMCAO was performed in all animals. During the experiment, ischemia
+ Semax animals were given intraperitoneal injections of
Semax (100 μg/kg), whereas ischemia animals were
injected with saline. The injections of Semax or saline
were performed 15 min, 1, 4 and 8 h after pMCAO.
The rats were decapitated under anesthesia with ethyl
ether 3 and 24 h after the operation. According to data
from the literature, significant events in the formation of
a stroke area, such as excitotoxicity, mitochondrial damage, emergence of reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis, occur within the first 3 h after occlusion of an
artery [53], and the expression of genes at the early stage
of ischemia can be studied at this time point. At the
24 h time point the infarction area reaches its maximal
dimensions and the formation of the penumbra is completed [54].
Each time point included at least five animals. We isolated the frontoparietal cortex of the ischemic animals,
in which, according to histological analysis of our earlier
research, the damaged area was localized [51]. Total
RNA was isolated from tissue samples.
Microarray data analysis

Microarray experiments were carried out at ZAO
''Genoanalytica'', Moscow, Russia. Total RNA was isolated
from tissue samples using guanidine thiocyanate [55].
RNA integrity was assessed by comparison with the rRNA
bands obtained in agarose gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. RNA was quantified using NanoDrop, and its quality was assessed using an Agilent RNA
6000 Nano Chip. Total RNA (400 ng) was amplified using
an Illumina® TotalPrep™ RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion,
USA) containing 22,523 probes for a total of 22,228 rat
genes selected primarily from the NCBI Reference Sequence database (Illumina, USA). The Illumina RatRef-12

Expression BeadChip was used in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. The BeadArray Reader was
employed for data acquisition, and the analysis was accomplished with the help of the Genome Studio software
(Illumina, USA) using the gene-expression module. The
statistical algorithm used in GenomeStudio gene expression analysis is the Illumina Custom error model.
