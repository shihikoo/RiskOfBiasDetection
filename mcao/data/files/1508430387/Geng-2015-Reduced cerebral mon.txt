Introduction

Due to a sudden lack of oxygen, ischemic tissues switch from
aerobic respiration to much less efﬁcient anaerobic processes.
Instead of shuttling pyruvate, the product of glycolysis into the
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, it is instead funneled into the
production of lactic acid. Accumulation of lactate in tissue can
decrease pH below that which is physiologically safe and
stable (Oliva, 1970). Acutely stressful events such as stroke
can precipitate these metabolic shifts, leading to increased
production of lactate and modulation of the monocarboxylate
transporters (MCTs) that regulate lactate levels (Martinov et al.,
2009; Moreira et al., 2009). Of the 14 known isoforms in the MCT
family, only three are currently known to be prominently
expressed in the central nervous system: MCT1 in endothelial
cells and astrocytes, MCT2 in neurons, and MCT4 in astrocytes
only (Pierre and Pellerin, 2005). These proton-dependent symporters are responsible for facilitating the exchange of lactate
(as well as other monocarboxylates) in, out, and between
cellular compartments. During increased, non-pathologic neuronal activity, the expression of MCTs has been found to be
increased (Simpson et al., 2007). The high glycolytic capacity of
astrocytes coupled with their increased expression of MCT1 and
MCT4 allow these cells the potential to act as a high-output
source of lactate-derived energy (Dienel and Cruz, 2003). Concurrently neurons participating in synaptic activity have been
noted to increase their expression of MCT2, possibly to take
advantage of this relationship (Magistretti, 2006). Designated as
the astrocyte–neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) by some, the
proposed system has recently garnered attention in studies
on stroke pathophysiology (Genc et al., 2011; Tarczyluk et al.,
2013). Although the ANLS may potentially act as a functional
energy reserve in this regard, recent research suggests that its
contributions are relatively minor (Hall et al., 2012). Overall, any
beneﬁts of increased lactate are speculative at best. Conversely,
it has long been known, with little opposing evidence, that
prolonged high levels of lactate are detrimental mainly by
inducing acidosis (Kreisberg, 1980; Oliva, 1970).
In rat models of stroke, ethanol (EtOH), as well as normobaric oxygenation (NBO), were previously shown by our group
to be neuroprotective during periods of cerebral ischemia (Geng
et al., 2013a; Geng et al., 2013b; Geng et al., 2015; Kochanski
et al., 2013). This neuroprotection occurred at least partially,
from amelioration of aberrant glucose metabolism concurrent
with a decrease in the production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) after stroke (Kochanski et al., 2013). Due to the ﬁnely
tuned relationship between lactate, glucose, and how this

relationship can be disturbed after stroke, the current study
was designed to further elucidate the putative beneﬁcial effects
of EtOH and/or NBO. Speciﬁcally, we aimed at investigating
whether EtOH and/or NBO might ameliorate the overproduction
of both lactate and MCT that occurs as a result of stroke. Since
an early reperfusion strategy is often not available for most
stroke patients, and since the proposed treatments could be
easily administered and disseminated to ischemic regions
through circulatory collaterals (Bang et al., 2011a; Bang et al.,
2011b; Liebeskind, 2003; Liebeskind, 2012; Liebeskind, 2014), we
designed therapeutic strategies along more clinically relevant
stroke models by including the use of longer ischemia periods
(2 vs. 4 h) and, in certain groups, by eliminating reperfusion
altogether (simulating permanent ischemia).

Results

2.1.

Cerebral lactate levels

In ischemic rats, cerebral lactate levels were signiﬁcantly
increased by 28.2% as early as 3 h and remained elevated by
24.3% at 24 h of reperfusion (Fig. 1A), when compared with
controls. Administration of 1.5 g/kg EtOH, 2 h post-stroke
onset, signiﬁcantly decreases expression of lactate at both 3
(po0.01) and 24 h (po0.05) of reperfusion. After 4 h ischemia,
signiﬁcant (po0.01) increase in expression of lactate was
observed at 3 and 24 h reperfusion. The increased levels were
signiﬁcantly diminished to 35% above control levels by EtOH,
which was administered at the two reperfusion time points
(Fig. 1B). In comparison to control values, cerebral lactate
levels in rats with PMCAO were nearly doubled (po0.01)
(Fig. 1C). When EtOH was applied, a signiﬁcant decrease
(po0.05) was observed. Combination of EtOH and NBO induced
a more potent and additive decrease in lactate levels (po0.01).

2.2.

MCT-1 expression

After 2 h ischemia and subsequent reperfusion at 3 and 24 h,
MCT-1 mRNA expression was elevated (po0.05) as compared to
sham operation control, which was set at a value of 1 for
reference (Fig. 2A). Following EtOH administration, mRNA expression was reduced at the time points after reperfusion although
this reduction did not reach signiﬁcant levels. In ischemic rats
with 4 h MCAO, MCT-1 mRNA was signiﬁcantly (po0.01)
increased by about 110% at 3 and 24 h reperfusion (Fig. 2B). In
addition the increased mRNA expressions were attenuated to

Fig. 1 – (A) At 3 and 24 h of reperfusion after 2 h MCA occlusion, lactate levels were signiﬁcantly (**po0.01) elevated when
compared with controls. EtOH administration (1.5 g/kg) following MCA occlusion led to a decrease in the expression of lactate
at 3 (##po0.01) and 24 h (#po0.05) of reperfusion when compared with rats that underwent MCA occlusion without any
treatment. (B) After 4 h ischemia, a signiﬁcant (**po0.01) increase in the expression of lactate was observed at 3 and 24 h
reperfusion. Similarly EtOH reduced lactate levels at both 3 (##po0.01) and 24 h (#po0.05) when compared with groups that
did not receive any treatment. (C) Compared to control values, cerebral lactate levels in rats with PMCAO were nearly doubled
(**po0.01). EtOH administration led to a signiﬁcant decrease (#po0.05) in lactate levels when compared to the group that
underwent PMCAO without any treatment. Combined EtOH and NBO treatment led to a signiﬁcant decrease in lactate levels
(##po0.01) which was more efﬁcacious than treatment with EtOH alone. Values are mean7SE.

near control levels at both time points (po0.01). MCT-1 mRNA
expression was signiﬁcantly (po0.01) increased after permanent
stroke (Fig. 2C). While two doses of EtOH did not produce a
signiﬁcant decrease in the MCT-1 expression, combined EtOH
and NBO therapy produced a large reduction (po0.01).
MCT-1 protein expression was signiﬁcantly increased to
nearly twice the control level after 2 h ischemia followed by 3
and 24 h reperfusion (Fig. 3A), while post-ischemic EtOH treatment attenuated this MCT-1 expression levels after 3 (po0.05)
or 24 h (po0.01) reperfusion. After 4 h ischemia, MCT-1 protein
expression was signiﬁcantly increased by 30% at 3 h reperfusion
(po0.05), and further increased to 80% at 24 h reperfusion
(po0.01) (Fig. 3B). Post-ischemic EtOH treatment signiﬁcantly
(po0.01) attenuated this MCT-1 expression at 24, but not 3 h.
Following permanent ischemia, MCT-1 protein expression was
signiﬁcantly increased to 3 times that of control (Fig. 3C).
EtOH signiﬁcantly (po0.05) decreased the MCT-1 response by
60%. The MCT-1 attenuation was further enhanced with concurrent EtOH and NBO treatments (po0.001).

2.3.

MCT-2 expression

At 3 h reperfusion following 2 h MCAO, untreated stroke models
had minimal depression of MCT-2 mRNA levels, indicating

relatively stable MCT-2 mRNA levels at this time point (Fig. 4A).
However MCT-2 mRNA levels were elevated about 220% after 24 h
reperfusion (po0.05), indicating a delayed MCT-2 mRNA response.
With EtOH treatments, MCT-2 mRNA levels were depressed to
near control levels after 24 h reperfusion (po0.05). In ischemic rats
with 4 h MCAO, MCT-2 mRNA expression was elevated at 3 and
24 h reperfusion, as compared to sham operation control (po0.05)
(Fig. 4B). EtOH signiﬁcantly (po0.05) attenuated mRNA expression
to near control levels at both time points. MCT-2 mRNA expression in the permanent MCAO group was increased by160%
(Fig. 4C). Whereas intervention with EtOH alone attenuated the
mRNA response (po0.01), combined EtOH and NBO treatments
further attenuated mRNA expression (po0.001).
After 2 h MCAO, MCT-2 protein expression was signiﬁcantly
(po0.01) increased in the stroke group as compared to the
sham-operated group at 3 and 24 h reperfusion (Fig. 5A). EtOH
treatment reduced protein expression only at 24 h (po0.01).
Following 4 h ischemia, MCT-2 protein expression increased to
1.6 times that of control after 3 and 24 h reperfusion, respectively (Fig. 5B). EtOH treatments largely and signiﬁcantly
(po0.01) reduced the MCT-2 expression (po0.01). Permanent
ischemia resulted in a 2.8 times (po0.01) increase in MCT-2
protein expression (Fig. 5C). Similarly to the MCT-1 results, EtOH
therapy signiﬁcantly attenuated MCT-2 expression (po0.01)

68

Fig. 2 – (A) MCT-1 mRNA expression was signiﬁcantly increased (*po0.05) after 2 h of MCA occlusion when compared with
controls. With the administration of EtOH, mRNA expression was reduced when compared with the group that underwent
MCA occlusion alone, though this reduction was not found to be signiﬁcant. (B) In ischemic rats with 4 h MCA occlusion, MCT1 mRNA levels were signiﬁcantly (**po0.01) increased when compared with controls. Similarly, the increased expression of
MCT-1 mRNA was reduced (##po0.01) by EtOH when compared with the group that did not receive treatment. (C) MCT-1
mRNA expression was increased (**po0.01) after PMCAO. EtOH administration following PMCAO led to a decrease in MCT-1
expression when compared with the group that did not receive treatment, though the magnitude of the reduction was not
found to be statistically signiﬁcant. The combined therapy of EtOH and NBO, however, led to a signiﬁcant reduction (##po0.01)
in MCT-1 mRNA expression which was more efﬁcacious than EtOH alone. Values are mean7SE.

which was further enhanced by adjuvant NBO treatments
(po0.001) (Fig. 5C).

2.4.

MCT-4 expression

In the 2 h MCAO group, mRNA expression signiﬁcantly
(po0.01) increased to approximately 4.7 times that of control
at 3 h reperfusion, and approximately 110% at 24 h reperfusion (Fig. 6A). EtOH treatment reduced MCT-4 mRNA at both 3
and 24 h reperfusion (po0.01) (Fig. 6A). Following 4 h MCAO,
MCT-4 mRNA expression was greatly increased at 3(po0.05)
and 24 h reperfusion (po0.01) (Fig. 6B). EtOH treatment signiﬁcantly attenuated the MCT-4 mRNA. After permanent
ischemia, MCT-4 mRNA expression signiﬁcantly (po0.01)
increased (Fig. 6C). Similarly to the other MCTs, EtOH diminished MCT-4 expression (po0.01), while EtOH and NBO interventions further decreased the mRNA (po0.001).
MCT-4 protein expression was signiﬁcantly elevated to 2.4
times that of control at both 3 and 24 h reperfusion. EtOH
treatments signiﬁcantly (po0.01) attenuated protein expression
at both 3 and 24 h reperfusion (Fig. 7A). Following 4 h MCAO,
MCT-4 protein expression increased  1.5 and 3.0 times that of
control after 3 and 24 h reperfusion, respectively. These elevated
expressions were signiﬁcantly (po0.01) attenuated by post-

ischemic EtOH administration at 24, but not 3 h. Following
permanent ischemia (Fig. 7C), the MCT-4 protein expression
was signiﬁcantly (po0.01) increased to 3.3 times that of control.
While EtOH treatments attenuated this response, combined
EtOH and NBO treatments further enhanced this attenuation to
levels that paralleled control values (Fig. 7C).

Discussion

Similar to our most recent study on ischemic oxidative brain
injury using the same transient and permanent ischemia models
(Geng et al., 2015), a temporal association was found between
increased brain lactate levels and MCT overexpression at both
mRNA and protein levels. This shows that post-ischemia EtOH
treatment reliably and consistently decreases both lactate levels
and MCT expression, particularly during reperfusion following
ischemia. In addition, the observed EtOH-induced neuroprotection was further enhanced by NBO in rats that did not undergo
reperfusion (permanent ischemia).

Fig. 3 – (A) MCT-1 protein expression was signiﬁcantly increased (**po0.01) after 2 h of ischemia as compared with controls.
EtOH administration led to signiﬁcant decreases in MCT-1 protein expression at 3 (#po0.05) and 24 h (##po0.01) of reperfusion
when compared to the group that did not receive treatment. (B) After 4 h ischemia, MCT-1 protein expression was signiﬁcantly
increased (*po0.05) at 3 h reperfusion, and further increased at 24 h of reperfusion (**po0.01). EtOH administration, similarly, led
to a signiﬁcant decrease (##po0.01) in MCT-1 expression at 24 h, while the reduction at 3 h was not found to be statistically
signiﬁcant. (C) Following PMCAO, MCT-1 protein expression was signiﬁcantly increased (**po0.01) when compared with
controls. EtOH administration signiﬁcantly decreased (*po0.05) the protein expression of MCT-1 when compared with the group
that did not receive treatment. Combined EtOH and NBO therapy led to a more robust and signiﬁcant reduction in MCT-1 protein
expression (##po0.01) when compared with controls. Representative immunoblots are presented. Values are mean7SE.

(Oliva, 1970) highlights the importance of lactate homeostasis
and the necessity for prompt restoration of abnormal blood pH
in regards to cell survival. Speciﬁcally in brain, regional acidosis
in the ischemic penumbra has been shown both to exacerbate
perfusion defects and worsen mitochondrial function (Anderson
et al., 1999). Another study (Bender et al., 2003) not only
supported the negative effects of regional acidosis, but also
noted that the length of acidosis, rather than an absolute pH
decrease, is a major detrimental factor. Although controversial,
the “astrocyte–neuron lactate shuttle“ (ANLS) hypothesis has
been recognized as a potential mechanism underlying the role of
astrocytes and lactate in brain energy metabolism during times
of acidosis (Tarczyluk et al., 2013). According to this hypothesis,
astrocytes may play the primary role in cerebral glucose utilization and in mediating glucose/lactate exchange, with lactate
subsequently being transported to neurons to fuel neuronal
energy production (Pellerin and Magistretti, 1994). Furthermore,
during times of ischemia and/or hypoglycemia, astrocytes are

known to increase their uptake of glucose for conversion to
lactate (Figley, 2011). This lactate is then shuttled (or transported)
via MCTs (likely MCT-1 and/or MCT-4) to neurons to compensate
for their inability to continue aerobic processes (Pellerin et al.,
2007). While lactate may normally play a preferential role as an
oxidative substrate for neurons, such a role may only be a
supplementary one during ischemia (Hall et al., 2012). Thus, in
our stroke model, because of massive depletion of oxygen postischemia, it is unlikely that lactate would be the primary source
of fuel in the neuronal TCA cycle. Supporting this concept is the
ﬁnding that in prolonged ischemia, accumulation of lactic acid
occurs at a pace beyond the ANLS' capacity to effectively shuttle
lactate into the neuronal compartment. This limitation of the
ANLS thus leads to lactic acidosis and ultimately to nerve cell
injury (Brown et al., 1988). In addition, elevated CSF lactate levels
correlate well with the evolution of the stroke. This occurs not
only during its subacute phase, but also during its more detrimental long-term outcomes which strongly suggests that lactate

Fig. 4 – (A) At 3 h of reperfusion following 2 h MCA occlusion, untreated stroke models had minimal depression of MCT-2 mRNA
levels, while MCT-2 mRNA levels were signiﬁcantly increased (*po0.05) after 24 h reperfusion when compared with controls.
With EtOH administration, MCT-2 mRNA levels were depressed to near control levels after 24 h of reperfusion (#po0.05). (B)
After 4 h of ischemia, a signiﬁcant increase (*po0.05) in the expression of MCT-2 mRNA was observed at 3 and 24 h of
reperfusion when compared with controls. EtOH attenuated (#po0.05) this increase in MCT-2 mRNA expression at both time
points. (C) MCT-2 mRNA expression in the PMCAO group was signiﬁcantly increased (**po0.01) when compared to controls.
Whereas intervention with EtOH alone attenuated the increased MCT-2 mRNA expression(##po0.01), combination therapy with

is a major cause of secondary damage in both acute ischemic
stroke, TIA, and possibly chronic ischemic conditions (Brouns
et al., 2008). Therefore efforts to prevent, or at least alleviate, the
negative effects of ischemia-induced lactic acidosis by administration of EtOH/NBO (the primary objective of this study) would
not only be a logical approach but a practical one as well.

occlusion (Zhang et al., 2005). In addition, MCT1 was found to
be elevated in ischemic mouse hearts (Martinov et al., 2009).
Together the above ﬁndings suggest that increased MCT
expression is usually associated with hypoxia/ischemiainduced lactate levels – a physiological condition that is also
detrimental to brain tissue.

3.3.

MCTs in ischemia

The role of MCTs in the switch from aerobic to anaerobic
metabolism in cells is far from elucidated. In brain, MCT1 has
been shown to be primarily expressed on endothelial cells,
MCT2 on neurons, and MCT4 on astrocytes (Pierre and Pellerin,
2005). Furthermore a metabolic switch that favors increased
lactate use and production over that of glucose during hypoxia
has been reported (Genc et al., 2011). This change in lactate
utilization may be facilitated by differential expression of
MCTs during periods of relative hypoxia and/or hypoglycemia
– an effect observed in various tissues, including brain (Galefﬁ
and Turner, 2012). In adipocytes, for example, MCT1 and MCT4
levels were increased, while those for MCT2 were decreased
during hypoxia (Perez de Heredia et al., 2010). In microglia, a
previous study reported marked increases in both MCT1 and
MCT2 after ischemia (Moreira et al., 2009). Of relevance to our
study are the ﬁndings by Zheng et al., who reported increases
in MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4 in a rat model of permanent MCA

Ethanol and NBO in neuroprotection

Of the many pathophysiological changes that occur during
acute stroke, the metabolic switch to less efﬁcient anaerobic
processes is one that should not be viewed as a simple
compensatory response. Although anaerobic respiration preserves some energy production when there is a sudden loss
of oxygen and nutrients, the overproduction of lactic acid can
quickly rise to detrimental levels. Countering the harmful
effects of lactic acidosis after stroke by implementation of
rational therapies has been our focus in this study. In a rat
model of acute stroke (Geng et al., 2013a; Geng et al., 2013b),
we previously showed that EtOH administration with or
without additional NBO is neuroprotective – a phenomenon
at least partially explained both by decreased levels of ROS
and decreased cell death from cell-mediated apoptosis. In
parallel to our most recent study on reduced ischemic
oxidative brain injury (Geng et al., 2015), the same combination treatment of EtOH and NBO led to reduced levels of

71

Fig. 5 – (A) At 3 and 24 h reperfusion, MCA occlusion elevated (**po0.01) MCT-2 protein expression as compared to controls. EtOH
administration reduced protein expression at 24 h (##po0.01) but not at 3 h. (B) Following 4 h ischemia, MCT-2 protein expression
increased by 160% after 3 and 24 h of reperfusion when compared with controls. EtOH administration signiﬁcantly reduced
(##po0.01) MCT-2 expression when compared with groups that did not receive treatment. (C) MCT-2 protein expression was
signiﬁcantly increased (**po0.01) after PMCAO. EtOH therapy attenuated (##po0.01) the increased MCT-2 expression which was, in
turn, further enhanced by adjuvant NBO treatments (###po0.001). Representative immunoblots are presented. Values are mean7SE.

lactate and expression of MCTs. A dose-dependent neuroprotective effect of EtOH following transient ischemia
(2 and 4 h MCAO) was found. In permanent stroke (28 h
MCAO), this neuroprotection was augmented when EtOH
was therapeutically combined with NBO. Since reperfusion
therapy within a clinically realistic time window is not
available to most stroke patients, a goal of the study was to
assess combined EtOH and NBO neuroprotection under
severe ischemic conditions with longer time frames than
those previously tested (Geng et al., 2013a; Geng et al., 2013b).
These ﬁndings suggest that the neuroprotective properties of
EtOH and NBO may be causally related to the amelioration of
excess lactate levels (cerebral acidosis) and/or to decreased
movement of lactate between cellular compartments.
Oxygen alone has been used in the treatment of stroke as a
potentially beneﬁcial approach to counteract the hypoxic state
induced by ischemia (Michalski et al., 2011). Clinically, NBO
has been shown to protect the ischemic brain from damage
(Flynn and Auer, 2002; Henninger et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2005;
Singhal et al., 2002b; Singhal et al., 2005). NBO is also inexpensive, readily available, and easy to apply, as compared to

hyperbaric oxygenation. However, in both transient and permanent focal ischemia, NBO has a relatively short time
window and low therapeutic effects (Michalski et al., 2011;
Singhal et al., 2002a). Furthermore, a recent clinical trial for
NBO in acute ischemic stroke was terminated due to unclear
efﬁcacy. It is possible that NBO alone may not fully resolve
ischemic injury because of its multifactorial, deleterious
mechanisms, of which increased ROS production is a major
contributing factor. Conversely EtOH therapeutic value
appears to lie in its ability to ameliorate the metabolic and
oxidative stress induced by ischemia, especially in the case of
short transient ischemia, as conﬁrmed by our laboratory
(Kochanski et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2012). The mechanism
by which EtOH achieves its therapeutic effect may be due to its
ability to induce a “hibernation state” – effectively minimizing
oxidative damage by partially inhibiting glycolytic and other
metabolic process (Tu et al., 2007; Volkow et al., 1990). These
effects, in turn, may slow down energy depletion and extend
the survival time of the cells in the penumbra region (Liao
et al., 2003). It is probable that the same principle is at work in
this study. Our present results also show that EtOH alone is no

Fig. 6 – (A) In the group that underwent 2 h ischemia, MCT-4 mRNA expression was signiﬁcantly (po0.01 24 h) increased at 3

signiﬁcantly reduced (##po0.01). (B) Following 4 h of ischemia, MCT-4 mRNA expression was signiﬁcantly increased at 3

Experimental Procedures

and (4) permanent MCAO (28 h)(n¼ 8  3). The 2 h MCAO groups
were randomly assigned to receive either an intraperitoneal (IP)
injection of saline (sham treatment) or EtOH (1.5 g/kg) immediately prior to the onset of reperfusion. For the 4 h MCAO group,
rats were randomly assigned to receive either saline, or two
doses of EtOH (1.5 g/kg at onset of reperfusion, followed by
1.0 g/kg in 2 h) because of ineffective one dose determined by
our previous study in the similar model (Geng et al., 2015).
Animals in the transient ischemia groups were sacriﬁced after 3
or 24 h reperfusion for biochemical analyses of lactate, as well
as MCT-1, -2 and -4 mRNA and protein expressions. In the
permanent stroke group, rats were randomly assigned to
receive saline, two doses of EtOH (1.5 g/kg at onset of reperfusion, followed by 1.0 g/kg in 2 h), or EtOHþ95%NBO. Animals
were processed for the same biochemical, mRNA and protein
analyses at 28 h after ischemia.

longer effective in cases of permanent stroke without reperfusion. Thus, the addition of oxygen as an oxidative compliment
appears to be essential in conferring neuroprotection, at least
in this case. Taken as a whole, once metabolic dysfunction is
stemmed by EtOH, it is possible that oxygen may then be able
to ameliorate the hypoxic state of cells and tissues with
minimal detrimental effects.
To our knowledge, the current study is the ﬁrst to
demonstrate that EtOH administration with or without NBO
administration can reverse lactic acidosis by suppressing
MCT expression in acute ischemic insult. Increasing evidence
of neuroprotection by EtOH and/or NBO treatment in acute
ischemia/reperfusion raises important clinical implications
for future stroke treatments and interventions.

All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional
Animal Investigation Committee of Wayne State University and
were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health
guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals. A total of
96 adult, male Sprague-Dawley (Charles River Laboratories,
Wilmington, MA) rats were used. Rats (n¼ 8 per group) were
randomly divided into: (1) a sham-operated group, in which no
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed

MCAO

Rats were subject to MCAO using the intraluminal ﬁlament
model dscribed by Longa et al. (1989). Brieﬂy, a 4.0 nylon
suture with a blunted tip coated with poly-L-lysine was
inserted into the right external carotid artery and lodged in
the narrow proximal anterior cerebral artery to block the MCA
at its origin. Reperfusion was achieved by the withdrawal of
the ﬁlament at each corresponding time point, as mentioned
above. We monitored blood pCO2 and pO2, mean arterial

Fig. 7 – (A) After 2 h ischemia, MCT-4 protein expression was signiﬁcantly increased (**po0.01) when compared to controls at
both 3 h and 24 h of reperfusion. EtOH attenuated (##po0.01) this increased protein expression. (B) Following 4 h of ischemia,
MCT-4 protein expression was signiﬁcantly increased after 3 h (*po0.05) and 24 h (**po0.01) of reperfusion when compared
with controls. This elevated MCT-4 protein expression was signiﬁcantly (##po0.01) attenuated by administration of EtOH at
24 h, but not 3 h. (C) PMCAO increased the protein expression of MCT-4 (po0.01) when compared with controls. While EtOH
administration attenuated (##po0.01) this response, EtOH and NBO combined therapy led to a more robust reduction in the
protein expression of MCT-4 (###po0.001). Representative immunoblots are presented. Values are mean7SE.

pressure (MAP), as well as rectal temperature throughout the
procedure. Rectal temperature was maintain at 36.5–37.5 1C
by heating lamps and pads.

4.3.

EtOH treatment

Ischemic rats received either one dose (1.5 g/kg in 3 mL
saline) of EtOH or normal saline (3.0 mL) by IP at 2 h after
MCAO. Rats in the 4 h and permanent MCAO groups received
a second EtOH dose (1.0 g/kg) at 2 h after the ﬁrst dose.

4.4.

Combination treatment with NBO and EtOH

At 2 h after the onset of ischemia, animals that ﬁrst received
an IP injection of EtOH, as described above, were then placed
into a sealed chamber (50  25  25 cm3) full of 95% oxygen to
undergo consecutive NBO treatment for 6 h, as described
previously by our laboratory (Geng et al., 2013a; Geng et al.,

2013b). During this time, animals received 2nd dose of EtOH
at 4 h after ischemia. To maintain oxygen concentration, an
oxygen controller (PRO-OX110; Reming Bioinstruments Co.,
Redﬁeld, NY) was used and the oxygen ﬂow rate was 2 L/min.
In addition, carbon dioxide was removed by placing a container of soda lime (Sigma, USA) at the bottom of the
chamber.

Lactate concentration

Brain lactate levels were detected at 3 and 24 h following
reperfusion as described by us previously (Kochanski et al.,
2013) using the Lactate Assay Kit (BioVision Research Products, Mountain View, CA). Brieﬂy, right cerebral hemispheres were extracted and homogenized in lactate assay
buffer and 46 μL were added to each luminometer plate along
with 2 μL of lactate substrate mix and 2 μL of lactate enzyme
mix. Samples were incubated at room temperature for

74

30 min. Measurements were performed using a DTX-880
multimode detector at O.D. 450 nm.

4.6.
PCR

Messenger RNA expression determined by real-time

Brain tissue samples from each animal were homogenized
and prepared for both mRNA and protein analysis. Expression
of mRNA as well as protein was quantiﬁed for MCT-1, MCT-2,
and MCT-4. A sensitive real-time reverse-transcription PCR
technique was used as described previously by us (Ding et al.,
2003) to determine the expression of target genes. Brieﬂy, the
total RNA from 100 mg brain tissue samples was isolated
using TRIzols Reagent (Life Technologies). The cDNA was
then ampliﬁed using an Eppendorf PCR Thermocycler for
real-time PCR, with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Agilent
Technologies). For internal PCR control, the rat ribosomal
protein L32 (rpL32) gene, a housekeeping gene, was used.
Reactions were performed in a 20 ml volume with 0.5 mM of
primers. The relative mRNA levels of gene expression were
determined using the threshold cycle (CT) and arithmetic
formulas. The expression of the target genes (MCT-1 MCT-2
and MCT-4) from the experimental groups therefore represented the fold-difference expression relative to the
reference gene.

4.7.

Protein expression determined by western blot

Protein extracted from right cerebral hemisphere samples
including cortex and striatum, was transferred to a PVDF
(polyvinylidene diﬂuoride) membrane after electrophoresis
separation, then the membrane was processed with the
desired antibodies, which were comprised of primary polyclonal goat anti-MCT-1 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.
sc-14916), primary polyclonal mouse anti-MCT-2 (1:1000;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; sc-166925), and primary
polyclonal rabbit anti-MCT-4 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; sc-50329). Furthermore, PBS buffer was used to wash
membranes 3 times for 6 min each. Next, secondary antibody
incubation was done for one hour at room temperature (antigoat, 1:5000; anti-mouse, 1:5000; anti-rabbit, 1:5000, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas). An ECL system was used
to detect immune reactive bands by luminescence and to
quantify protein expression proﬁles, the relative density of
western blot images was obtained using an image analysis
program (ImageJ 1.42, National Institutes of Health, USA). As
a reference, the mean amount of protein expression from the
sham-operation group was assigned a value of 1. The expressions of the target genes were represented as fold-differences
compared to the control.

4.8.

Statistical analysis

All the data were described as mean7SE. Statistical analysis
was performed with SPSS for Windows, version 17.0 (SPSS,
Inc.). The differences among multiple groups were assessed
using both one-way and two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with a signiﬁcance level at po0.05. Post-hoc comparison between groups was detected using the least signiﬁcant difference (LSD) method.
