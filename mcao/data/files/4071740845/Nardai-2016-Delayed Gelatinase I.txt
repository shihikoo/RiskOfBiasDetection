Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibition can potentially prevent hemorrhagic transformation following cerebral infarction;
however, delayed-phase MMP activity is also necessary for functional recovery after experimental stroke. We sought to identify potential mechanisms responsible for the impaired recovery associated
with subacute MMP inhibition in a transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion model of focal ischemia in CD rats. Gelatinase inhibition
was achieved by intracerebral injection of the Fn-439 MMP inhibitor 7 days after stroke. Treatment efficacy was determined on day 9
by in situ gelatin zymography. The peri-infarct cortex was identified
by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining, and tissue samples were
dissected for TaqMan array gene-expression study. Of 84 genes
known to influence poststroke regeneration, we found upregulation
of mRNA for the reticulon 4 receptor (Rtn4r), a major inhibitor of
regenerative nerve growth in the adult CNS, and borderline expression changes for 3 additional genes (DCC, Jun, and Ngfr). Western
blot confirmed increased Rtn4r protein in the peri-infarct cortex of
treated animals, and double immunolabeling showed colocalization
primarily with the S100 astrocyte marker. These data suggest that
increased Rtn4 receptor expression in the perilesional cortex may
contribute to the impaired regeneration associated with MMP inhibition in the subacute phase of cerebral infarction.

the achievement of better functional outcomes with mechanical
thrombectomy, the frequency of bleeding complications remains
high (1). The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and 9 enzymes
(also called gelatinases) are important factors in the hemorrhagic
transformation of ischemic brain lesions; they promote bloodbrain barrier injury and accelerate cerebral cell death (2, 3).
Because MMP 9 activity is enhanced by the thrombolytic agent
used during contemporary reperfusion therapy (4), the inhibition
of MMP enzymes could represent an adjunctive treatment for the
prevention of hemorrhagic complications.
In contrast to their deleterious effect on acute lesions,
gelatinases may mediate repair mechanisms during the delayed
phases of stroke recovery. Pharmacological gelatinase inhibition 7 days after ischemic brain injury increased lesion size
and impaired functional regeneration in a rat model (5).
In addition to their roles in neurovascular remodeling
(5), gelatinases may influence recovery through interaction
with multiple growth promoting and inhibitory proteins.
Gelatinase activity has been demonstrated at the edge of the
growth cone of dorsal root ganglion neurons (6); and the
expression of phosphorylated neurofilament M, a marker for
regenerative elongation, was induced by MMP9 (7). Oligodendrocyte process outgrowth has also been shown to require
the proteolytic activity of MMP9 (8).
MMPs can also interact with the Nogo system, the principal glia-neural signal-transduction mechanism responsible for
the inhibition of axonal sprouting (9, 10). The reticulon 4 receptor (Rtn4r), also known as Nogo-66 receptor, is a receptor for
multiple structurally distinct glial inhibitory molecules and is a
substrate of the gelatinases. Therefore, MMP-mediated cleavage
of Rtn4r may propagate a disinhibitory mechanism that leads to
enhanced axonal recovery (9). This receptor was also shown to
mediate the astrocytic differentiation of neural progenitor cells,
suggesting that the MMP-Rtn4r interaction might also influence
glial scar formation following CNS injury (11).
The aim of this study was to explore the molecular basis
of the impaired recovery associated with subacute MMP inhibition in an ischemic stroke model.

Tissue Sampling
Nine days after MCAO, the animals (n ¼ 5 per group)
were decapitated, and the brains were rapidly removed. Coronal 2-mm-thick sections were cut from the native brain tissue
using a rat brain matrix (Harvard Apparatus), starting 6 mm
caudal to the frontal pole. On the first coronal sections, TTC
staining (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was performed, and
brain tissue from the border of the lesion was dissected using
a punch biopsy needle. Samples were stored in RNAse later
and proteinase solutions at 20  C.

In Situ Gelatin Zymography
Inhibition of MMP activity was demonstrated by in situ
gelatin zymography. The frontal part of the brain was cut into
20-mm-thick slices, and the samples were incubated overnight
at 37  C with 40 ml/ml Die quenched (DQ) gelatin-FITC
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (14). After washing away
the excess gelatin, the slides were coverslipped; 5 fields of
view were captured in the peri-infarct cortex through a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and analyzed with the Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).

TaqMan Array Analysis
Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Thermo
Fisher, Waltham, MA) after quantification by UV spectrophotometry; only samples with a 260:280 ratio greater than
1.7 were further processed. RNA was reverse transcribed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and samples were
run parallel on a custom-designed TaqMan array containing
probes for 84 representative genes involved in stroke recovery (Table). Values of gene expression were compared between the groups after being normalized to a housekeeping
control (Psmc4-Rn00821605_g1). RNA isolation and realtime quantitative PCR measurement was performed by UDGenoMed Medical Genomic Technologies, Ltd. (Debrecen,
Hungary).

Western Blot
Western blot analysis was performed on the basis of the
significant mRNA expression change. We used NuPAGE
4–12% bis-tris gels (Invitrogen, Ghent, Belgium). Proteins
were transferred to polyvinylidene-fluoride membranes,
which were blocked by Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween-20
containing 5% dried milk powder followed by incubation in
the same buffer containing the appropriate primary antibody
(1:500, anti-Rtn4 receptor, cat. number: AF 12080 and antiGAPDH, cat. Number: AF 5718, R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN). Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline and
Tween-20 and incubated with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Reactions were developed using
horseradish peroxidase, and quantification was performed
using the Image Lab 4.0.1 software (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA). Results were analyzed after normalization with
the GAPDH control.

Statistical Analysis
Normalized cDNA expression values and normalized protein levels were used for analysis. We used the t test for screening calculations and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) test
for confirming our results in the GraphPad Prism 6 software
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).

Immunolabeling for Rtn4r
Nine days after the MCAO procedure, rats (n ¼ 3/
group) were deeply anesthetized and perfused transcardially
with 150 ml saline followed by 300 ml 4% paraformaldehyde
prepared in phosphate buffer (PB, pH ¼ 7.4). Brains were
removed and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours
and then transferred to PB containing 20% sucrose for 2 days.
Serial coronal brain sections were cut at 40 lm on a cryostat
between 4.0 and -6.0 mm bregma levels. Subsequently, the
samples were processed for immunohistochemistry as freefloating brain sections. Every fourth free-floating brain section of MCAO-treated animals was immunostained with rabbit polyclonal antibody against Rtn4r (1:300, Abcam, Cambridge, MA; cat. number: ab 26291). The specificity of the
labeling is suggested by single bands in Western blot experiments provided by the manufacturer.
The sections were pretreated with citrate buffer
(pH ¼ 6) at 70  C for 60 minutes, followed by 3% hydrogen
peroxide for 15 minutes and 1% bovine serum albumin in PB
containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes at room temperature. The antibody (1:300) was applied for 48 hours at
room temperature followed by incubation of the sections in
biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1000;
Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and then in avidinbiotin-peroxidase complex (1:500; Vector Laboratories) for
1 hour. Subsequently, the labeling was visualized by incubation in 0.02% 3, 3-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma-Aldrich),
0.08% nickel (II) sulfate, and 0.001% hydrogen peroxide in
PB for 5 minutes. Sections were mounted, dehydrated, and
coverslipped with Cytoseal 60 (Stephens Scientific, Riverdale, CA).

applied on CD rats (Charles River, Erkrath, Germany), as previously described (12). General anesthesia was induced by 5%
isoflurane and maintained by 2% isoflurane in pure O2. The
correct placement of the suture was confirmed by monitoring
of the cerebral blood flow over the MCA territory using LaserDoppler Flowmetry (Perimed, Inc., Stockholm, Sweden).
Ischemia was maintained for 60 minutes.
On day 7, we injected 20 ml of FN-439 metalloproteinase inhibitor (0.59 mg/kg, 720 mM in saline, Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) or saline into the right lateral
ventricle of the animals over 20 minutes, using a stereotaxic
injector (Harvard Apparatus, Boston, MA) (0.8 mm caudal to
bregma, 1.6 mm lateral to midline; depth: 4.1 mm to skull surface), under general anesthesia.
The Animal Examination Ethical Council of the Animal Protection Advisory Board at the Semmelweis University
specifically approved this study. To minimize animal use,
sample sizes were determined according to literature recommendations for array experiments (13).

Double Immunolabeling for Rtn4r With Cell
Markers
The following antisera were used as cellular markers in
double-labeling experiments: mouse anti-NeuN as a marker of
neuronal nuclei (1:500; Millipore, Billerica, MA, cat. number:
MAB377), mouse anti-S-100 as a marker of astrocytes (1:5000
Sigma-Aldrich, cat. number: S2532), rabbit anti-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) as a marker of microglial cells (1:1000; Wako, Osaka, Japan; cat. number: 019197419), and rabbit anti-Von Willebrand factor (vWF) as an
endothelial marker (1:1500 Abcam, cat. number: ab6994).
First, free-floating sections of the 6 rats used for single
labeling for Rtn4r were immunolabeled for this protein, as
described above, except that donkey anti-mouse secondary
antibodies cross-absorbed with IgG of several different species (including rabbit) were used to avoid cross-reactions
(1:1000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove,
PA). Another difference was that the labeling was visualized
using fluorescein isothiocyanate-tyramide (1:8000) and H2O2
in Tris hydrochloride buffer (0.1 M, pH ¼ 8.0) for 6 minutes
instead of DAB. Then, the sections intended for double labeling for Iba1 and vWF were incubated in citric acid buffer
(pH ¼ 6.0) for 30 minutes to remove rabbit antibodies from
the sections to avoid cross-reactions. Subsequently, all sections were placed in antibodies of the above-described cell
markers for 48 hours at room temperature. The sections were
then incubated in Alexa594 donkey anti-mouse (or anti-rabbit
for Iba1) secondary antibody (1:500; Molecular Probes) for

2 hours, washed in PB overnight, mounted, and coverslipped in
antifade medium (Prolong Antifade Kit, Molecular Probes).

Microscopy, Photography, and Image
Processing
Sections were examined using an Olympus BX60 light
microscope. Coronal sections obtained near bregma level were
involved in the analysis from each animal (3 brains per group).
After identification of the infarcted region, 5 adjacent fields
near the lesion were captured in the cortex at 2048 x 2048 pixel
resolution with a SPOT Xplorer digital CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) using 40X objectives.
The digitized images were then contrast enhanced (equally) before evaluation.
Confocal images were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse
E800 (Tokyo, Japan) confocal microscope equipped with a
Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 Laser Scanning System using a 60X
objective at an optical thickness of 2 mm. A section containing
lesion at the level of the anterior commissure was randomly selected from the double-labeled brains for each marker. Rtn4rpositive cells with an identifiable cell nucleus and doublelabeled cells were counted.

RESULTS
The in situ zymography demonstrated a mean 81% decrease of the gelatinase activity in the peri-infarct cortical regions of the treatment animals compared with the controls

C-Jun, and Ngfr).

(p ¼ 0.008) following the intracerebroventricular injection of
the FN-439 inhibitor (Fig. 1); this is similar to previously
published data (5).
The selected 84 genes involved in synaptic plasticity,
apoptosis regulation, inflammation, and neurovascular remodeling (Table) could be regrouped into 3 categories based
on their response to the delayed (day 7) gelatinase inhibition.
The vast majority of the tested mRNAs (n ¼ 80) showed unaltered expression, whereas Rtn4r was clearly induced in the
cortex of the treated animals (fold change: 1.69, p ¼ 0.015 by
t test, p ¼ 0.028 by MWW test) (Figs. 2, 3A; Table). We
found altered expression with borderline statistical significance in 3 additional genes: the c-jun proto-oncogene (Jun)
showed a 30% increase (p ¼ 0.040 by t test, p ¼ 0.075 by
MWW), the nerve growth factor receptor (Ngfr) showed a
mean 2.03-fold increase (p ¼ 0.064 by t test, p ¼ 0.032 by
MWW), and the mRNA level of the deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC) axonal guidance receptor was decreased by

Rtn4r immunoreactivity under normal conditions is unevenly distributed in intact brain tissue both in the striatum
and the cerebral cortex (15). Following MCAO, Rtn4r appeared in the peri-infarct region around the lesion without
any labeling within the lesion (Fig. 4A). Indeed, the border of
the lesion can be defined clearly based on the Rtn4r immunohistochemistry results. The labeling in the peri-infarct region
appeared to be present in cell bodies. Following Fn439 treatment, the distribution of Rtn4r labeling did not change as
compared to that in the control MCAO tissues, but the intensity of the immunolabeling was markedly elevated in the
peri-infarct region (Fig. 4B). Subsequent Western blotting
also confirmed the increased protein level for the Rtn4 receptor in the treated animals (p ¼ 0.004) (Fig. 3B).

Double Immunolabeling of Rtn4r With Cell
Markers
S100 immunohistochemistry labeled astrocytes with
their characteristic processes. We found that essentially all
Rtn4r-labeled cells were double labeled for S100 (98.1%), suggesting their expression in astrocytes (Fig. 5C). The Rtn4r
immunoreactivity was present in the cell bodies and the foot
processes of the astrocytes. In contrast, microglial cells labeled
by the marker Iba1 do not contain Rtn4r (Fig. 5C). Neuronal
cell bodies in the peri-infarct cortex also did not colocalize
with Rtn4r, but we noted weaker NeuN staining in this region,
which may also have contributed to the lack of double labeling
(Fig. 5A). Finally, staining for the endothelial cell marker
vWF did not overlap with that of Rtn4r, arguing against the expression of the latter in the vasculature (Fig. 5B).

MMP-Nogo Interaction in the Peri-Infarct Cortex

FIGURE 3. (A, B) Box and whiskers plots show the relative mRNA (A) and protein (B) expression levels of Rtn4r in the peri-infarct
cortex following delayed (day 7) gelatinase inhibitor treatment. p values were calculated by t test. Insert shows the original blot
image. Error bars represent minimal to maximal values.

DISCUSSION
We found significantly increased Rtn4r expression in the
astrocytes of the peri-infarct region following gelatinase inhibition in the subacute phase of experimental cerebral infarction.
According to the literature, the gelatinases show a biphasic activation pattern following focal cerebral ischemia, that is, acute
activation in the ischemic core is primarily associated with
invading granulocytes, and the second subacute activity peak involves NeuN-positive neurons and GFAP-positive astrocytes of
the peri-infarct cortex (16). While the inhibition of the leucocyte-associated acute MMP activity helped to preserve the neural tissue in previous stroke experiments, functional recovery
was impaired by the pharmacological blocking of the delayed
cortical gelatinase activity (5). The elevated Rtn4r expression
documented in our study represents a potential new mechanism
contributing to this deleterious effect.
Rtn4r is a principal member of the Nogo system, that
is, the myelin components that inhibit neurite outgrowth by

binding to the neuronal Rtn4 receptor, which transduces an
inhibitory signal to the cell interior via its coreceptor, Ngfr
(17). Previously published data indicate that the metalloproteinase-mediated shedding of Rtn4r results in the release of a
soluble N-terminal fragment of the receptor, which adheres to
the Ngfr-Rtn4r complex and blocks its signal transmission (9).
While Nogo-mediated axonal regrowth inhibition after
stroke has been primarily attributed to neuronal Rtn4 receptors (18), the same protein was shown to promote astroglial
differentiation of neural progenitor cells in vitro (11). Our results suggest that the higher amounts of Rtn4r-positive astrocytes found in the peri-infarct cortex of the treated animals
following delayed gelatinase inhibition may be a consequence of the increased astroglial differentiation of the neural
progenitors, that is, as a result of augmented Nogo signaling
due to the lack of Rtn4-receptor shedding.
In the peri-infarct cortex, we found almost exclusive
colocalization of Rtn4r with S100. No neuronal colabeling was

documented, despite the literature data supporting the expression of the receptor on neurons in the normal rat brain (15). It
is important to note, however, that the standard NeuN neuronal
marker has a tendency to lose immunogenicity in the peri-infarct region (19). Therefore, the lack of double labeling in our
experiments does not exclude the potential expression of Rtn4r
on neurons.
While the new data on the upregulation of the Rtn4receptor expression in the peri-infarct cortex helps to explain
impaired regeneration associated with delayed MMP inhibition in ischemic stroke, many questions are still unanswered.
The exact mechanism by which the gelatinase inhibitors
enhance Rtn4r mRNA expression remains to be explored;
future experiments are needed to clarify how the potentially
increased Nogo signaling associated with the delayed gelatinase inhibition may affect neurons in the peri-infarct region.
In conclusion, the glial and neuronal colocalization of
the gelatinase activity in the peri-infarct cortex, together with
the currently described changes in the expression of the Rtn4
receptor, suggest that the MMP-Nogo interactions may play
an important role in post-stroke regeneration. Our data suggest that prolonged inhibition of gelatinases following

384

cerebral infarction may increase reactive gliosis and, therefore, interfere with tissue and functional recovery.
