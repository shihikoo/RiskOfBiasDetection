ABSTRACT
Cerebral collaterals are vascular redundancies in the cerebral
circulation that can partially maintain blood flow to ischemic tissue
when primary conduits are blocked. After occlusion of a cerebral
artery, anastomoses connecting the distal segments of the MCA with
distal branches of the ACA and PCA (known as leptomeningeal or
pial collaterals) allow for partially maintained blood flow in the
ischemic penumbra and delay or prevent cell death. However,
collateral circulation varies dramatically between individuals, and
collateral extent is significant predictor of stroke severity and
recanalization rate. Collateral therapeutics attempt to harness these
vascular redundancies by enhancing blood flow through pial
collaterals to reduce ischemia and brain damage after cerebral
arterial occlusion. While therapies to enhance collateral flow remain
relatively nascent neuroprotective strategies, experimental therapies
including inhaled NO, transient suprarenal aortic occlusion, and

electrical stimulation of the parasympathetic sphenopalatine ganglion show promise as collateral therapeutics with the potential to
improve treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

CEREBRAL COLLATERAL CIRCULATION
Collateral circulation refers to alternative, pre-existing vascular pathways that allow blood flow to reach a target tissue
when a primary conduit is blocked [34,35,54,72]. In the
brain, the collateral circulation includes venous collaterals
and the primary and secondary arterial collaterals. The
venous collateral circulation is highly variable, and augments
drainage of cerebral blood flow during venous occlusion
[34]. Primary arterial collaterals refer to short arterial
segments in the Circle of Willis that allow blood flow
between the territories of the internal carotid arteries and
vertebrobasilar system or between cerebral hemispheres [24]
in the event of proximal occlusion or stenosis in these
feeding arterial systems. The secondary collaterals include the
pial collaterals (also called the leptomeningeal collaterals).
Pial collaterals are anastomatic connections located on the
pial surface of the cortex that connect distal branches of the
ACA, MCA, and PCA [8]. These collateral channels permit

228

blood flow from the territory of an unobstructed artery into
the territory of an occluded artery (e.g., flow from the ACA
into the MCA territory after an occlusion of the MCA, see
Figure 1A) [1,35,54,72]. While collateral remodeling (including arteriogenesis and angiogenesis) occurs during chronic
ischemia [15], this article will focus on rapid changes in
cerebral collateral circulation that occur during acute brain
ischemia and the potential of collateral flow augmentation as
an acute stroke therapy.
Pial collaterals are highly conserved, and exist to varying
extents on the cortical surface of all mammals. Because the
physiological function in the absence of arterial obstruction is
not clear, the dynamics of pial collateral blood flow have
primarily been studied in animal models of cerebral ischemia.
After occlusion of the MCA or common carotid artery, blood
pressure in pial collaterals correlates with blood flow in
ischemic areas, and dilation of these pial collaterals further
improves perfusion of ischemic territories [51,69]. Studies in
rats suggest that pial arteries require only ~12 seconds to

become maximally dilated after ischemic onset and stabilize
within minutes after common carotid artery occlusion [51].
Although this rapid response is promising, collateral flow may
not be sufficient to maintain blood flow above the threshold
for tissue viability over a long time period [17]. However, in a
recent study LSCI was used to assess the dynamics and
persistence of pial collateral blood flow to ischemic territories
over the 24 hours following thromboembolic MCAo in rats
[1]. As shown in Figure 1B, LSCI-derived maps of blood flow
revealed multiple (~3–6) anastomoses between the ACA and
MCA that exhibit increased blood flow soon after vessel
occlusion. Notably, these anastomoses were both persistent
and dynamic: Blood flow through approximately 75% of
these anastomoses persisted for at least 24 hours. However,
the anastomoses were dynamic and responsive to degree of
ischemia, as flow through these collateral connections ceased
after spontaneous reperfusion. In some animals, collateral
connections that were not apparent immediately after stroke
were visible 24 hours post-stroke. Improved quantification of
collateral flow, including measures in the microvasculature
below the cortical surface, can be acquired using in vivo twophoton microscopy in rodent models of stroke [67]. These
studies show that small (<23 lm diameter) surface arterioles
and penetrating arterioles show the greatest increases in
diameter during acute ischemia, dilating by approximately
20% on average [68]. Reversal of blood flow direction, as
would result from retrograde flow from the ACA into the
territory of the MCA, is observed in approximately half of the
surface arterioles downstream of the MCA occlusion within
two hours from ischemic onset [62]. Notably, these flow

ª 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

reversals occur in surface arterioles but do not extend to
penetrating arterioles [68].

SIGNIFICANCE OF PIAL COLLATERALS
DURING ISCHEMIC STROKE
As noted, pial collaterals allow exchange of blood flow from
non-ischemic territories into ischemic tissue downstream of
an occlusion. However, the extent of pial collateralization
varies greatly between individuals (in humans) and between
strains of the species (in animal models). A clear relationship
between stroke severity and pial collaterals has been observed
in animal models with variable native pial collateral circulation [9,87]. Analysis of collateral circulation (number and
diameter of collateral connections between ACA and PCA
with MCA) after MCA occlusion in 15 inbred strains of mice
shows a significant inverse relationship with infarct volume,
and the relative collateral blood flow coupled with the size of
the MCA territory strongly predicted infarct volume [87].
Moreover, studies in mice show that aging induces an agedose-dependent loss in the number and diameter of pial
collaterals, as well as increased vessel tortuosity, and an
increase in infarct volume after MCA occlusion [20,82].
As the major endogenous compensatory mechanism to
reduce ischemia during occlusion of a cerebral artery,
collateral extent is also a significant predictor of stroke
severity in human stroke patients [3,5,13,38,39,46]. Angiography in patients with acute MCA occlusion shows that retrograde perfusion of the ischemic MCA territory
downstream from the occlusion via pial collaterals varies

229

significantly [3,24,46]. Notably, good collateral flow is
associated with improved likelihood of major reperfusion,
reduced infarct expansion, and more favorable outcomes
[40,50]: Infarct volume and modified Rankin scale scores at
discharge are significantly lower for patients with better
angiographically assessed pial collaterals, whereas National
Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and collateral
flow scores show an inverse relationship [13]. MRI diffusion
and perfusion imaging in conjunction with angiographic
collateral scoring during acute cerebral ischemia show that
patients with good collaterals have larger areas with only
mild hypoperfusion and reduced infarct growth within the
penumbra [3]. Notably, common risk factors for stroke
including metabolic syndrome, hyperuricemia, and age are
also associated with poor pial collateral flow [47].
Improved outcome with increased pial collateral circulation in stroke patients may occur in part due to the potential
facilitation of recanalization and reperfusion therapies in
these individuals. Currently, thrombolysis with rtPA is the
most effective therapy for acute ischemic stroke [31,80].
However, rtPA is ineffective in many patients who receive
treatment within its short therapeutic window, particularly
in the case of MCAo [28]. Part of this low success rate can be
attributed to futile recanalization, defined as the lack of
clinical benefit due to endovascular treatment of acute
ischemic stroke even when recanalization is successful. Futile
recanalization may be due to re-occlusion of the artery after
initial thrombolysis or due to collateral flow that is
insufficient to sustain tissue viability [26,36]. Notably,
recanalization rates are significantly correlated with collateral
patency in patients undergoing endovascular revascularization therapy [3,4]. Moreover, collateral extent is also
correlated with lower rates of hemorrhagic transformation
after recanalization [5,12]. After intra-arterial thrombolysis,
25% of patients with poor pial collaterals suffered a
significant hemorrhage compared to only 2.78% of those
with good collateral flow [12].

using a variety of genetic approaches, Lucitti et al. [41]
demonstrated that pial collateral formation occurs primarily
(~70%) during in a narrow window of development between
embryonic day 13.5 and 14.5. Notably, this embryonic
collaterogenesis determines adult collateral extent and is
dependent on paracrine VEGF activation of an endothelial
Flk1-ADAM10-Notch signaling pathway. Association mapping has further demonstrated that the wide variation in the
extent and remodeling of the native collateral circulation is
primarily attributable to a quantitative trait locus on
chromosome 7 (formerly Candq1, now designated Dce1)
[83]. The recent development of a congenic strain set with
allele dose-dependent variation in collateral extent confirms
that genetic background-dependent differences in Dce1
expression is a major factor underlying differences in
ischemic tissue injury in the brain and hindlimb [66]. The
influence of this risk allele is currently being investigated in
patients with acute ischemic stroke in the GENEDCSS study.

VARIANCE OF PIAL COLLATERALIZATION

Several studies have investigated the efficacy of vasodilators,
vasopressors, volume expanders, and hemodilution on
increasing cerebral circulation (and theoretically collateral
flow) to improve outcome after stroke [72]. Studies of
volume expansion (with dextran or hydroxyethyl starch) and
hemodiluation have not identified any improvement in
outcome or reduction in mortality in acute ischemic stroke
[64,81]. Dilation of cerebral arteries has the potential to
increase flow through pial collaterals; however, attempts to
improve cerebral blood flow during stroke using vasodilatory
compounds have not been neuroprotective to date. It is
possible that because ischemic vasculature is dilated in
response to ischemia, a more potent dilation is observed in
non-ischemic vasculature, resulting in vascular stealing that
is deleterious to ischemic tissue [30]. Based on available

While wide variance in collateral extent is observed in animal
models and stroke patient populations, and collateral circulation is reduced in several known risk factors for stroke, very
little is known about the genetic mechanisms that account
for this variance in native cerebral collaterals. However,
recent studies in mice have identified several genes that are
major factors in this variation. In mice, collaterals develop
late during vascular development and undergo post-natal
maturation [10]. Previous studies have shown that the
expression levels of the genes for Vegfa and CLIC4 strongly
influence the development of the collateral circulation in
multiple tissues as well as the severity of stroke and amount
of post-stroke collaterogenesis [10,11,14]. More recently,

COLLATERAL THERAPEUTICS FOR ACUTE
ISCHEMIC STROKE
Animal models and clinical data have clearly demonstrated
the importance of collateral circulation during acute ischemic stroke in determining stroke prognosis and response to
recanalization therapy. “Collateral therapeutics” attempt to
harness these endogenous vascular redundancies to improve
blood flow to ischemic brain tissue. While therapies to
enhance collateral flow such as adjusting head position,
intravenous fluid support, and pressure augmentation have
been suggested as neuroprotective strategies, collateral therapeutics remain a relatively unexploited neuroprotective
strategy [34,35,37,54]. In this section, we will explore
different means of collateral blood flow augmentation and
their efficacy in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.

Volume Expansion, Hemodilution, Vasodilation,
and Induced Hypertension

evidence, the American Heart Association’s guidelines advise
against volume expansion, hemodilution, and vasodilation in
acute ischemic stroke [27].
As cerebral autoregulation is impaired during stroke,
changes in mean arterial blood pressure have a linear effect
on cerebral blood flow. Artificially inducing hypertension
may therefore augment global cerebral blood and collateral
flow [7,86]. A neuroprotective role for mild induced hypertension has been confirmed in animal models. Mild hypertension induced by phenylephrine increased blood pressure
and cerebral blood flow when administered within one hour
of ischemic onset in mice and was associated with decreased
infarct volume [70]. Similarly, hypertensive treatment with
phenylephrine has also been shown to significantly reduce
infarct volume if administered within 2 hours of MCAo in
rabbits [74]. Reductions in infarct have also been reported by
increasing mean arterial pressure by 40–60% via angiotensin
administration after transient MCAo in rats [88]. Clinically,
however, blood pressure is often elevated already acute
ischemic stroke patients and clinical trials have not demonstrated unequivocal benefits of induced hypertension on
neurological outcome [34,35]. Moreover, the risks of elevated
blood pressure in stroke patients are not well defined, and
hypertensive treatments may increase the risk of intracerebral
hemorrhage, reflex bradycardia and possibly even ischemic
bowel disease [86]. However, norephenephrine administration that increased mean arterial pressure by 10 mm Hg also
improved perfusion pressure in patients with MCAo, with
only a small increase in intracranial pressure [65]. While
preliminary, several studies have suggested that inducing mild
hypertension may improve NIHSS scores and reduce the
volume of hypoperfused tissue [25,58]. In patients ineligible
for thrombolysis, mild hypertension induced via pheynylephrine (increasing mean arterial pressure by 20%) resulted
in a three-point reduction on the NIHSS scale and moderate
functional improvement on follow up measured using the
Rankin scale [7]. More data are required, however, as
preliminary studies were generally non-randomized or very
small and collateral status was not assessed [57,58,72].

Inhaled NO as a Collateral Therapeutic
NO, a potent endogenous vasodilator, was originally proposed to have an exclusively pulmonary effect when given by
inhalation. However, recent studies provide strong evidence
that inhaled NO (in 30% O2; 70% air) preferentially dilates
arterioles in areas of low perfusion and can reduce ischemic
or tramautic brain injury [78,79]. Using in vivo microscopy,
the effects of inhaled NO on CBF, cerebral metabolism,
neuronal cell death, and functional outcome were evaluated
in two murine models of ischemic stroke [78]. Under nonischemic conditions, inhaled NO had no effect on cerebral
blood flow. However, after MCA occlusion, a selective
dilation of arterioles in the ischemic penumbra was observed,

ª 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

resulting from an increase in collateral blood flow and
producing a significant reduction in infarction and neurological outcome. These findings were validated in a clinically
relevant large animal model of ischemic stroke in sheep, and
inhaled NO remains an exciting potential target for effective
collateral therapy during acute ischemic stroke [76].

Augmenting Cerebral Blood Flow Using Partial
Aortic Occlusion
Recent studies have suggested that reperfusion of ischemic
territories can be improved via temporary partial occlusion
of the descending aorta. Studies in animal models using a
catheter and balloon introduced via the femoral artery and
inflated to occlude 70% of the suprarenal descending aorta
suggest that global cerebral perfusion and perfusion of
ischemic territories by collateral pathways can be improved:
TAO has previously been shown to improve cerebral
perfusion and neurological deficits in symptomatic vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage [43]. In a nonischemic porcine model, TAO increased cerebral blood flow
by 35–52%, an effect that persisted for 90 minutes after
deflation [23]. Using a rat model of thromboembolic stroke
involving injection of an autologous blood clot into the
origin of the MCA, Noor et al. [52] demonstrated a
neuroprotective effect of 60 minutes of partial aortic occlusion. Notably, reductions in infarct volume at 24 hours postocclusion were comparable to treatment with rtPA and did
not increase hemorrhagic transformation. Moreover, treatment in combination with rtPA reduced the infarct volume
more than either treatment alone.
The hemodynamic effects of TAO and consequences on pial
collateral circulation were recently demonstrated in rats after
thromboembolic MCA occlusion [85]. TAO induced a significant increase in blood pressure in the carotid artery. LSCI was
used to image pial collaterals during ischemia, and confirmed
that the increased cerebral perfusion pressure during TAO
augmented collateral blood flow. TAO restored blood flow
velocity in MCA segments downstream of pial collateral
connections to baseline levels and maintained stroke-induced
vasodilation in these MCA segments for the duration of
treatment (whereas vessel diameters in sham-treated rats
returned to baseline within 45 minutes, see Figure 2). Consistent with studies in non-ischemic pigs, enhanced collateral
blood flow persisted for at least 75 minutes after TAO.
Recently, the safety and efficacy of partial aortic occlusion
was tested in patients up to 14 hours after ischemic onset in the
SENTIS trial [71]. Importantly, the treatment appeared safe
and no difference in serious adverse events was found between
TAO-treated stroke patients and controls [42,71]. TAO did not
increase the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage and no significant differences in renal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or vascular events were observed. While the SENTIS
trial did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint, several subsets

231

of patients showed clear benefit. Notably, TAO was effective in
patients treated early after ischemic onset (within five hours),
patients older than 70 years of age, and patients with moderate
stroke severity (NIHSS score of 8–14) [32,71,73]. Post hoc
analyses suggest that TAO reduced mortality in treated
patients without an increase in severe disability [63]. Importantly, TAO is safe in combination with rtPA, and studies of
combination therapy are warranted [19].

Augmenting Collateral Flow with Sphenopalatine
and Cervical Spinal Stimulation
The parasympathetic nerves in the sphenopalatine ganglion
innervate the anterior cerebral circulation, and a number of
studies in animal models suggest that selective electrical
sphenopalatine stimulation elicits significant increases in
cerebral blood flow [2,6,18,29,33,53,77]. Pre-clinical work in
rats using MR imaging and behavioral assessment after MCAo
suggests that sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation treatment
as much as 18 hours after ischemic onset improves n-acetylaspartate levels (a marker of neuronal density and viability) in
ischemic brains and reduced neurological impairment. Conversely, cutting the nerves eminating from the sphenopalatine
ganglion worsens stroke severity [18]. The safety and
practicality of sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation is currently being evaluated for clinical application [29].
Electrical stimulation of the cervical spinal cord has also
been associated with significant increases in cerebral blood
flow in non-ischemic rats [59,60]. When initiated 20 minutes after MCAo in rats, cervical spinal stimulation improves
blood flow in ischemic territories by over 30% and reduced

232

rats after TAO during acute MCA occlusion.
LSCI was used to determine relative changes in
blood flow velocity (A) and diameter (B) of
distal branches of the MCA downstream of
collateral connection with the ACA during
TAO. TAO increased blood flow velocity and
diameter in these distal MCA segments. An
estimate of relative blood flow can be calculated from LSCI-derived velocity and diameter
measures [85]. (C) TAO induces an ~6 fold

acute infarct volume [60]. Similarly, cervical spinal stimulation in cats significantly reduced infarct size 24 hours after
stroke and decreased mortality due to MCAo [44]. While it
has not been tested in stroke patients, electrical stimulation
of the spinal cord in non-ischemic humans significantly
enhances blood flow in the common carotid and MCA
[55,56], suggesting potential as a collateral therapeutic.

Considerations for Rational Design of Collateral
Therapeutics
Collateral circulation is a predictor of stroke severity and
response to endovascular therapy [3–5,39]. Collateral
enhancement has substantial pre-clinical support as an acute
stroke therapy, but treatments to date have not exhibited
clear clinical efficacy. Moreover, treatments such as TAO and
sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation have demonstrated
efficacy in pre-clinical and/or clinical trials, but require
specialized equipment and facilities not available to all stroke
patients. While inhaled NO has promising pre-clinical data
and requires less specialized equipment, inhaled NO has an
extremely short half-life and long-term inhalation poses a
risk of adverse reactions within and outside the lungs that
remain to be investigated in a stroke patient population. For
most new collateral therapeutics investigated to date, essential questions regarding therapeutic window, duration and
mechanisms of action, and risk of adverse effects remain to
be answered. More conventional hemodynamic approaches
have not yielded unequivocal benefits on outcome for stroke
patients [72]. As such, new strategies for collateral flow
augmentation during acute ischemic stroke are required.

Cerebral Collaterals and Collateral Therapeutics

Rational design of an effective collateral therapeutic must
take into consideration the realities of acute stroke therapy.
Invasive strategies such as TAO should, if shown effective, be
included in the treatment toolbox, but will not be available to
patients treated outside of a major stroke center. Less
invasive strategies that can be performed in any hospital
environment are desired. Therapies that do not exacerbate
hemorrhagic stroke outcome, and therefore can be given
prior to clinical imaging (or even pre-hospital admission)
would reduce delays from clinical diagnosis to treatment.
Collateral enhancement should also be explored as primary
treatment as well as an adjuvant to current recanalization
protocols. While endovascular therapies have become
increasingly effective, improved revascularization demonstrated with angiographic endpoints is not always associated
with improved clinical outcomes [16,38]. In some cases, this
disconnect may reflect insufficient collateral flow to maintain
tissue viability until recanalization. Adjunctive hemodynamics such as flat head positioning, hypervolemia, or induced
hypertension may augment collateral flow and tissue viability
until revascularization occurs [38]. Similarly, even a small
increase in collateral arteriole diameter can induce a significant improvement in perfusion, and pharmacotherapies that
can dilate these arterioles without depressing central cardiovascular function and inducing hypotension have significant
potential. Drugs such as naftidrofuryl (a vascular and platelet
serotonin receptor antagonist), cilostazol (a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor), and pentoxifylline (a non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor) that can augment cerebral
circulation without reducing systemic blood pressure warrant further investigation as stand-alone or adjuvant stroke
therapies.
In pre-clinical and clinical work, selection of appropriate
stroke models and patients, respectively, and carefully chosen
endpoints are essential. Pre-clinically, collateral therapeutics
must be evaluated according to the STAIR criteria, incorporating multiple species and models of ischemia, relevant dosing
and temporal windows for treatment, and appropriate
outcome measures [21,22,49,61,75]. Endpoints should include
measures of blood flow to demonstrate collateral enhancement, but also histological and functional measures with
sufficiently long recovery periods to determine final outcome.
In clinical evaluation, functional outcomes after collateral
therapeutics should be the focus rather than angiographic
results [38]. However, angiography or other cerebral blood
flow imaging is still essential, and demonstrating proof of
principle using imaging endpoints in small pilot studies is an
important step prior to large trials with clinical outcomes.
Moreover, a better understanding of the relationship between
collateral flow and response to therapy is required. Trials
focusing on more severe patients without imaging to determine collateral status may result in inclusion of a high
proportion of patients with poor collaterals and therefore poor

ª 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

outcomes regardless of treatment. Conversely, selection of
patients with good collateral flow and mild strokes may mask
treatment effects. That is, in patients with very poor collaterals,
therapeutics may not be able to augment flow sufficiently to
surpass the threshold for tissue viability, or infarct may
progress to quickly for effective neuroprotective therapy.
Patients with extremely good collateral flow may already have
mild strokes and good outcomes, and further collateral
enhancement may not provide additional functional benefit.
Notably, data from the SENTIS trials suggests that TAO had
improved efficacy in older patients, who would be expected to
demonstrate impaired collaterals relative to younger patients,
supporting the contention that there is a continuum of
collateral flow that is a primary contributor to treatment
efficacy [32]. Clinical evaluation of collateral therapeutics
must therefore include context on collateral status as well as
measures of functional outcome to properly determine
efficacy. Appropriate imaging selection in trials is essential.
Selection of invasive imaging techniques such as digital
subtraction angiography allows for fast and accurate scoring
of collateral blood flow. However, non-invasive markers of
collateral flow are notable on almost every form of diagnostic
imaging from ultrasound techniques to cross-sectional multimodal CT and MRI [38]. The development collateral grading
systems compatible with non-invasive markers is imperative.
Recently developed scores of pial collateral flow derived from
CTA strongly correlate with clinical outcomes, supporting the
use of CTA in clinical decision making in acute stroke patients
and imaging based patient selection for clinical trials of
collateral therapeutics [45,46,48].

SUMMARY
When primary vascular channels are blocked, redundancies in
the collateral circulation can partially maintain blood flow to
ischemic tissue. In the cerebral cortex, flow through pial
collaterals connecting the distal segments of the MCA to distal
branches of the ACA and PCA is a significant predictor of
stroke outcome and response to recanalization therapy.
Enhancing pial collateral blood flow may therefore reduce
ischemia after cerebral arterial occlusion (in particular MCA
occlusion). While therapies to enhance collateral flow remain
relatively nascent neuroprotective strategies, experimental
therapies including inhaled NO, TAO, and sphenopalatine
stimulation are identifying new approaches in collateral
therapy with potential to improve treatment of acute ischemic
stroke.

PERSPECTIVE
Currently, there are few acute stroke therapies proven to
improve outcome. Collateral blood flow has an established
relationship to stroke severity and outcome, and driving

233

more blood through collateral channels may reduce ischemia
and improve tissue viability. Given the personal and societal
costs of stroke, a collateral therapy that can reduce stroke
severity and potentiate the efficacy of other acute stroke
treatments by improving perfusion of at-risk tissue is of
significant value.
