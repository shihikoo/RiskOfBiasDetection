Abstract Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) have been
demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory and pro-regenerative
effects in animals and humans. We used the FDA-approved
Sofpulse™ (Ivivi Health Sciences, LLC) to study effect of
PEMF on infarct size and poststroke inflammation following
distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) in mice.
Electromagnetic field was applied within 30–45 min after
ischemic brain damage and utilized twice a day for 21 consecutive days. Ischemic infarct size was assessed using MRI
and histological analysis. At 21 days after dMCAO, the infarct
size was significantly (by 26 %) smaller in PEMF-treated
animals as compared to controls. Neuroinflammation in these
animals was evaluated using specialized cytokine/chemokine
PCR array. We demonstrate that PEMF significantly influenced expression profile of pro- and anti-inflammatory factors
in the hemisphere ipsilateral to ischemic damage. Importantly,
expression of gene encoding major pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1α was significantly reduced, while expression of
major anti-inflammatory IL-10 was significantly increased.
PEMF application significantly downregulated genes
encoding members of the major pro-apoptotic tumor necrosis
factor (TNF) superfamily indicating that the treatment could
have both anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. Both

Introduction
Stroke is a major public health problem with 750,000 cases in
the USA and 15 million worldwide each year [1], as well as a
leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the USA with
about 6.5 million survivors [2]. The associated ischemic damage involves cellular bioenergetic failure, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, blood–brain barrier dysfunction, microvascular
injury, postischemic inflammation, and ultimately, the death
of the endothelial cells, neurons, and glia [3]. All these events
lead to permanent cerebral injury in the center (core) of the
ischemic region.
Stroke is followed by acute and prolonged inflammatory
response including the activation of glial cells, production of
inflammatory cytokines, and infiltration of monocytes into the
brain [4]. Initial stage of poststroke inflammatory process is
triggered and regulated by various cytokines, such as
interleukins-1 alpha and beta (IL-1α and IL-1β), interleukin6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-α). Original elevation of cytokine expression
starts as early as several hours and peaks at 3–4 days after
stroke. This molecular inflammation is followed by cellular
inflammatory response, resulting in activation and recruitment
of different types of cells into the ischemic area, including
neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, microglia, and astrocytes [5]. Cellular inflammation, associated with additional
release of pro-inflammatory factors by the activated microglia
and astrocytes, can last for up to several weeks after stroke [6].
It is widely accepted that these events contribute to brain

injury: lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and higher
expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines are related to lower
infarct size and a better clinical outcome [5, 7]. On the other
hand, however, inflammatory cytokines can participate in the
initiation of the restorative processes and tissue remodeling
following brain damage. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines can activate neuroprotective pathways as well
as initiate neural stem cell migration and activation/
differentiation [6, 8].
Poststroke survival has significantly improved over the
years and yet treatment directed toward recovery remains
limited. Traditional approach utilizing treatment with tissueplasminogen activator (rt-PA) for thrombolysis is associated
with time limitations (3-h therapeutic window) and complications, including a risk of hemorrhage, and the potential damage from reperfusion/ischemic injury [7]. Neurorestorative
processes may be enhanced by the improvement of
ischemia-induced cerebral angiogenesis using proangiogenic factors or enhancement of neurogenesis using
stem cell therapy. However, utilization of pro-angiogenic
molecules may also be accompanied by an increase in vascular permeability and edema, and cell-based approaches can be
accompanied by a number of other complications, such as
transplant rejection or tumor formation. The present study
focuses on entirely different approach to poststroke regeneration: a noninvasive treatment with pulsed electromagnetic
field.
Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) from low- to pulsemodulated radio frequencies have been successfully employed
as adjunctive therapy for wide range of clinical conditions.
PEMF signals represent short bursts of electrical current, generated by relatively simple devises, allowing an external, noninvasive application to injured tissue, without producing heat
or interfering with nerve or muscle function [9]. Exposure to
pulsed electromagnetic field has been shown to attenuate tissue
damage following stroke: PEMF stimulation decreased infarct
size after transient focal ischemia in rabbits [10]. Certain
beneficial effect of PEMF application on visual memory was
reported in Alzheimer patients [11]. Significant improvements
in Parkinsonian motor symptoms were also seen following
repetitive treatments with AC pulsed electromagnetic fields
[12]. An accumulated scientific data support an idea of therapeutic effect of electromagnetic fields in inflammatory diseases
and conditions [13]. The anti-inflammatory effects of the
FDA-approved PEMF treatment parameters have been demonstrated by a decrease in inflammatory IL-1β cytokine after
traumatic brain injury in rats [14], decrease in pain and IL-1β
after breast reduction [15], and pain reduction after breast
augmentation [16] and osteoarthritis [17].
In the present study, we investigated possible beneficial
influence of PEMF treatment on infarct size and post-injury
inflammation at different time points following experimental
cerebral ischemia in mice.

Materials and Methods
Distal Middle Cerebral Artery Procedure The experimental
procedures were approved by the University of New Mexico
Office of Animal Care Compliance. All institutional and national
guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals were
followed. Distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO)
was performed on 2-month-old C57BL/6 mice. The MCA was
exposed via transtemporal approach [18]. The mice were anesthetized using isoflurane gas (induction dosage 2–3 %; maintenance dosage 1.5–2 %) and a mixture of O2:N2O gases in the
ratio 2:1, delivered during the surgery. A small burr hole (located
1 mm rostral to the fusion of zygoma and squamosal bone, and
3 mm ventral to the parietal bone) was made, and the MCA was
coagulated with low-heat electrocautery (Bovie Medical, FL).
After that, animals were allowed to undergo recovery.
Treatment (PEMF Administration) PEMF signal was a
27.12-MHz carrier modulated by a 2-ms burst repeating at
2 bursts/s (2 Hz). The signal amplitude was adjusted to provide
3±0.6 V/m within the mouse brain. The PEMF exposure chamber was constructed such that free roaming mice were restricted
to this field amplitude. PEMF field characteristics were verified
with a calibrated shielded loop probe 1 cm in diameter (model
100A, Beehive Electronics, Sebastopol, CA) connected to a
calibrated 100-MHz oscilloscope (model 2012B, Tektronix,
Beaverton, OR). In the previous studies, measurement of the
PEMF signal distribution in a tissue phantom and in air showed
that PEMF amplitude dose was uniform to within ± 20 %. An
additional measure in the tissue phantom showed that the
Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), a measure of peak RF power
in tissue, was 40 mW/kg, which is well below the level at which
detectable temperature rise could occur in the tissue target [9].
PEMF and control treatments started within 30–45 min after
dMCAO surgery (as the animals recovered from anesthesia).
Animals from the treatment (PEMF-treated) group were subjected to 15-min PEMF administration, two times daily, with 4-h
interval between the treatment sessions. Control group was subjected to 15 min of control treatment (“null” signal) by switching
to “sham” mode of the applicator. The groups were treated for
21 consecutive days. After completion of 21 full days of treatment, the animals were sacrificed and the brains were prepared
for histological evaluation. For the assessment of neuroinflammation, PEMF treatment (with described above regiment) was
initiated either immediately or at 3 days after dMCAO, and
samples were collected either at 4 or 7 days after dMCAO
(4 days of PEMF treatment was applied in both cases).
Animal Groups 24 C57BL/6 male mice (2 months old,
Jackson Laboratories) were subjected to dMCAO. Two experimental groups—PEMF-treated and control groups were
generated (12 mice/group). It is important to note that PEMF
treatment parameters used for this study are similar to PEMF

devices currently in clinical use for their FDA-cleared use,
treatment of postoperative pain and edema and for treating
chronic wounds (a Medicare approved use). There are no known
side or adverse effects of PEMF in human or rodent populations.
MRI Infarct size was evaluated using MRI at 24 h, 7 days,
14 days, and 21 days after dMCAO, in order to detect the
extent of the brain damage within control and PEMF-treated
animals. The MRI examinations were performed on 4.7T
Biospec® dedicated research MR scanner (Bruker Biospin;
Billerica) equipped with a single tuned surface coil for mouse
brain (RAPID Biomedical, Rimpar). The mice were anesthetized using isoflurane gas (induction dosage 2–3 %; maintenance dosage 1.5–2 %) and a mixture of O2:N2O gases in the
ratio 2:1, delivered during the measurements. Real-time monitoring of physiological parameters (heart rate and respiratory
rate) was performed during the entire duration of the study. A
tri-pilot scan using gradient echo sequence was used to acquire
initial localizer images. T2-weighted MRI was performed
with a fast spin-echo sequence (RARE), TR/TE=5,000/
56 ms, FOV=4 cm×4 cm, slice thickness=1 mm, interslice
distance=1 mm, number of slices=12, matrix=256×256,
number of average=3.
Infarct Volume Infarct volume was calculated based on the
widely used method proposed in [19], using Image J analysis
software. The optical density threshold was determined for the
gray matter in the unlesioned control hemisphere in each slice,
and used for the recognition of normal gray matter in the
lesioned hemisphere. The areas of noninfarcted (normal) brain
tissue were measured in control (C) and lesioned (L) hemispheres, in each T2-weighted MRI slice. The measured areas
were summarized, and the respective VC and VL volumes were
calculated by multiplying each sum by the distance between
slices (1 mm). The infarction volume was expressed as a
percentage of the volume of the control hemisphere, using
the following formula: %I=100×(VC −VL)/VC.
Histochemical Evaluation of the Infarct Size At 21 days after
dMCAO, PEMF-treated and control animals were subjected
to heart perfusion, and the brains were processed for tissue
cryosectioning. 8 serial (35 mm thick) coronal sections/mouse
(N=6 mice per group) were used to assess the brain damage.
Brain sections were stained with thionine and imaged using
Zeiss stereomicroscope and AxioVision software. Since the
necrotic tissue disappears at the later stages after dMCAO (due
to development of cystic zone), the whole brain lesion volume
was measured according to the indirect method by assessing the
size differences between the remaining ipsilateral and unlesioned
contralateral hemispheres. On each section, the areas of both
hemispheres were measured using Image J software. The infarction of the remaining tissue in the lesioned hemisphere was
detected by the lightly (or unstained) regions of the thionine-

493

stained section. The infarct area and volume were calculated as
described for the MRI-based measurements.
Assessment of Cytokine/Chemokine Expression Profiles Two
to three brains per each group were used to generate separate
sample duplicates or triplicates for this analysis. For these
experiments, brain cortices were dissected and stored in
RNAlater solution (Ambion). Total RNA was isolated using
RNeasy kit (Qiagen), from the hemispheres ipsilateral to
dMCAO injury. PCR Array experiments were performed in
collaboration with the UNM CUGR UNM Affymetrix facility
and Qiagen Company, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The obtained raw data were analyzed using
RT2 Profiler software (Qiagen). Only the genes with consistent expression levels (within the duplicate or triplicate samples) were picked up for statistical analysis. The fold changes
of gene expressions (treatment vs control) were calculated and
the transcripts that showed greater than a 1.5-fold change in
expression (either up- or downregulated) were retained.
At the final step, statistical significance (P value<0.05) and
reliability of the results was automatically evaluated.

Results
PEMF Treatment Reduces the Infarct Size at 21 Days
Following dMCAO
The effect of PEMF treatment on ischemia-induced infarct size
was studied using (direct) dMCAO as an experimental model of
cortical ischemia (Fig. 1). This model produces an infarct in the
frontal and parietal cortex, which over time progresses into
adjacent temporal, frontal, and cingulate cortex and dorsolateral
striatum [18, 20, 21]. The brain damage progresses from
vasogenic edema at 24 h to tissue infarction at 7 and 14 days
and significant brain tissue resorption at 21 days. Besides its high
reproducibility and survival rate, the advantage of this model is
that it produces smaller infarct comparable to human stroke [21].
PEMF and control treatments were initiated at 3–45 min after
dMCAO (right after the animals recovered from surgery) and
lasted for 21 days (15 min, 2× per day, with 4 h interval).
MRI-Based Measurements of Infarct Size After dMCAO Brain
tissue damage after dMCAO was evaluated using MRI as
described in “Materials and Methods.” T2-weighted MRIbased measurements of the infarct volume were done at
24 h, 7 days, 14 days, and 21 days post-dMCAO. Infarct
volume was measured and calculated according the methods
described in [19, 22]. The calculations were performed based
on the damaged area in each slice and the distance between
slices. These volumes were corrected for brain swelling/
shrinkage as described by Swanson et al. (1990) and were

dMCAO-induced injury size (% infarct volume) evaluated at
24 h post-dMCAO, was somewhat, but not significantly, smaller
in PEMF-treated animals (15.8 %) as compared to controls
(16.7 %) (MRI images on Figs. 2 and 3 and graph on Fig. 2).
At 7 days, the infarct in PEMF animals was 14.9 vs 18.2 % in
controls. In addition, at 7 days post-dMCAO, a significant
edema was still present in control animals, while it was almost
gone in PEMF-treated mice (Figs. 2 and 3). At 14 days, %
infarct sizes in PEMF and control groups were 14.1 and 16.9 %,
respectively. These differences were significant at 21 days, when
the relative infarct volume (relative to volume of the intact
hemisphere) in PEMF-treated animals was 11.65 %, which
was 23.6 % smaller than the relative infarct volume (15.25 %)
in control animals (Fig. 2, graph). Note visible differences in the
extent of brain tissue damage between the two treatment groups
at this time point (MRI images on Figs. 2 and 3; for better
visualization, remaining normal brain tissue in the ipsilateral
hemisphere is outlined with red dotted line).
Histological Evaluation of Infarct Size In order to verify our
MRI results, following completion of the in vivo imaging at 21 days after dMCAO, the animals were
subjected to heart perfusion, and the brains were

volume were done at 2, 14, and 21 days post-dMCAO. The brain damage
progressed from vasogenic edema at 24 h post-dMCAO to tissue resorption at 21 days. Bar, 2 mm. The volumes of normal gray matter in the
lesioned and nonlesioned control hemispheres were calculated, and the
infarction volume was expressed as a percentage of the volume of the

processed for tissue cryosectioning. Figure 4 demonstrates the representative histological images of thioninestained serial coronal brain sections from the control and
PEMF-treated animals. At 21 days, tissue loss and the
lesioned hemisphere shrinkage were visibly greater in
controls (remaining normal brain tissue is outlined with red
dotted lines). The calculations revealed that the relative
infarction volume in the ipsilateral hemisphere
(expressed as a percentage of the volume of the control
hemisphere) was 17.4 % in control animals and 10 % in
PEMF-treated animals. These results are in agreement with
our in vivo MRI measurements at 21 days (15.25 and 11.65 %,
respectively). The minor differences between the in vivo MRI
and histological measurements are associated with significant
deformation of the brain tissue following fixation, freezing,
and slicing procedures.
Effect of PEMF on Cytokine Expression Profile Following
Cortical Ischemia
Since PEMF treatment reportedly has an anti-inflammatory
action [15], we hypothesized that decreased infarct size could
be attributed to reduction of postischemic inflammation. In
this study, we focused mainly on the inflammation process
during the post-acute phase of stroke. Dynamic changes in

gray matter in the control hemisphere. At 21 days after dMCAO, the
necrotic tissue disappears due to tissue resorption. Assessment of the
remaining normal brain tissue (outlined by red dotted lines) is especially
helpful at this time point. % Infarct sizes in control (white bars) and
PEMF-treated (black bars) were plotted on the graph (N=12 per group,

cytokine profiles after stroke happen very rapidly: based on
the literature reports, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression
increases within several minutes (during an acute phase of
stroke), peaks at 3–4 days, and remains elevated within 7 days
[5]. Therefore, in order to detect any meaningful differences in
cytokine expressions during the subacute phase, we had chosen two different time points of 4 days (initial regeneration
period) and 7 days (progressive regeneration period) after
stroke. In addition, we wanted the PEMF treatment to last
for the same time period of 4 days, in both cases. To achieve
this, two different treatment/assessment time points were used
in these studies: (1) when PEMF treatment was initiated
immediately (within 30–45 min) after dMCAO, and
cytokine/chemokine expression was evaluated at 4 days after
dMCAO; and (2) when PEMF treatment was initiated at 3 days
after dMCAO, and cytokine/chemokine expression was evaluated at 7 days after dMCAO. The levels of pro- and antiinflammatory factors were assessed in the dMCAO-damaged
hemispheres, using specialized cytokines/chemokines PCR
profiler array (Qiagen). This specialized array focused on the
panel of pro-inflammatory molecules, includes common
chemokines, cytokines as well as growth factors and

Figure 5 and Table 1 demonstrate that at 4 days after dMCAO
and PEMF treatment, there was a significant (≥1.5) upregulation of eight and downregulation of four cytokine genes. The
fold changes of the upregulated (orange) and downregulated
(violet) genes in PEMF-treated animals, as compared with
controls, are plotted on the graph. Among the upregulated
cytokines, six are known to have a dual (both pro- and antiinflammatory, green star) effect, and two are proinflammatory (blue stars). Most of the downregulated cytokines have pro-inflammatory action; more importantly, gene
encoding IL-1α, the cytokine known to have a detrimental
effect on poststroke outcome, was significantly reduced. We
can conclude that PEMF treatment results in downregulation
of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but it does not upregulate

animals were subjected to heart perfusion, and the brains were processed
for tissue cryosectioning. Serial coronal sections were stained with thionine and imaged using Zeiss stereomicroscope and AxioVision software.
Since at this time point following dMCAO there is a significant resorption

(loss) of the necrotic tissue, the lesion volume was measured according to
the indirect method by assessing the size differences between the remaining ipsilateral (outlined by red dotted line) and unlesioned contralateral
hemispheres. At 21 days, tissue loss and the lesioned hemisphere shrinkage were visibly greater in controls, as compared with PEMF-treated
animals. Bar, 2 mm

brains at 4 days after dMCAO. RNAs from PEMF-treated and control
brains (cortices from the hemisphere ipsilateral to the lesion) were subjected to mouse cytokines/chemokines PCR profiler array (Qiagen).
PEMF treatment resulted in a significant (ranging between 1.5- and 3.5fold) increase (orange bars) or decrease (violet bars) in the expression
levels of genes encoding cytokines and chemokines of pro-inflammatory
(blue stars) or dual (both pro- and anti-inflammatory, green stars) action

clearly anti-inflammatory cytokines at the early stage of the
poststroke recovery.

PEMF Treatment Was Initiated at 3 Days After dMCAO,
and Cytokine/Chemokine Expression Was Evaluated
at 7 Days After dMCAO
Figure 6 and Table 2 show that PEMF treatment resulted in a
significant upregulation of 11 and downregulation of 19
genes. Among the downregulated genes, most of them encode

pro-inflammatory factors. It is important that similar to 4-day
time period, we detected significant reduction of proinflammatory factors IL-1α, adiponectin, and osteopontin at
7 days after stroke. It is very important to note that among the
downregulated factors are three members of the major
apoptosis-inducing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily,
including Fasl, Tnf, and Tnfsf13β. Among the upregulated
genes, 5 encode anti-inflammatory factors (red stars), including a major inflammation suppressor IL-10; three of the genes
with increased expression have dual (green stars), and three
pro-inflammatory (blue stars) effect. Interestingly, in PEMFtreated animals, pro-inflammatory chemokine Cxcl10 was
upregulated at 4 days but downlegulated at 7 days after stroke.
A complete list of the affected genes, their fold changes and
attributed functions are shown on Fig. 6 and Table 2. PCR
array analysis results indicate that PEMF treatment leads to a
stronger suppression of inflammation and apoptosis at later
stages of poststroke recovery, as compared to early time point.
Overall, we can conclude that PEMF significantly affects
poststroke inflammation by suppressing major proinflammatory and overexpressing major pro-inflammatory
factors.

Discussion
Our study demonstrates that PEMF treatment results in significantly decreased infarct size at 21 days following
dMCAO-induced cortical ischemia, indicating possible longterm improvement of poststroke regeneration process. Our

(blue stars), dual (both pro- and anti-inflammatory, green stars) and antiinflammatory (red stars) action

MRI data were in good agreement with histological measurements, which confirms the validity of our quantification approach. Reduction of the infarct size indicates that a larger
volume of the brain tissue in the peri-infarct area of stroke
(penumbra region) was rescued and prevented from necrosis
and resorption. Decreased necrosis and thus, reduced neural
cell death, could be attributed to the detected reduction in
expression of genes encoding major pro-apoptotic members
of the TNF superfamily (including Fas ligand, TNF, and
TNFsf 13b). Significant (ranging from 1.7- to 2.7-fold) reduction of these factors at 7 days after stroke could considerably
contribute to prevention of the brain tissue necrosis. At
21 days after dMCAO, PEMF-treated animals exhibited
dramatic (4.4-fold) downregulation of Osm gene,
encoding cytokine oncostatin, recently implicated as an
inhibitor of adult neural stem cell proliferation [44].
Since proliferation of endogenous neural stem cells is
critical in neurorestorative processes, downregulation of
their inhibitor could have a very positive effect on
neuroregeneration after stroke. PEMF signals are also implicated in modulation of calmodulin (CaM)-dependent nitric
oxide (NO) signaling in many biological systems [45]. The
role of NO in postischemic recovery is widely debated, and
analysis of PEMF-induced NO modulation in our experimental model will be the subject of our future investigations. It was also demonstrated that preexposure with
PEMF prior to ischemia and reperfusion results in the
upregulation of protective stress protein hsp70 gene and improvement of myocardial function [46]. We propose that in
addition to these reported protective mechanisms, reduction in

infarct size detected in our study could be directly attributed to
anti-inflammatory effect of PEMF.
Discussion on detrimental versus beneficial influence of
inflammatory response on brain function remains unresolved.
Many studies have reported beneficial effects of immunosuppressive manipulations on the stroke outcome. However, there
is also evidence that the effect of particular components of the
inflammatory cascade can be beneficial depending on the
stage of tissue injury. Moreover, some pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines activate neuroprotective pathways as
well as initiate neural stem cell migration and activation/
differentiation [6, 8]. In our study, we focused on post-acute
phase of cerebral ischemia and analyzed the effect of PEMF
treatment at two different stages of poststroke recovery. At
4 days after dMCAO, the inflammation process was not
significantly suppressed, but, rather, gently regulated. This
might be beneficial because total suppression of inflammation
would block the “positive” effect of the early inflammatory
response such as initial activation of microglia, astrocytes,
endogenous stem cells and immune cells, which contribute
to brain tissue repair. The upregulation of cytokines with
“dual” action demonstrates more fine-tuning, rather than aggressive action of the treatment. PCR array analysis results
indicate that PEMF treatment leads to a stronger suppression
of inflammation and apoptosis at later stages of poststroke
recovery. This must be useful for the elimination of prolonged
chronic inflammation, which would complicate the poststroke
recovery process. Surprisingly, at 4 and 7 days post-dMCAO,
PEMF had the opposite effect on the expression of Cxcl10
gene: it was upregulated at 4 days, but downlegulated at 7 days

Table shows the list of genes significantly (≥1.5-fold) affected (decreased or increased expression) by PEMF treatment (also shown on Fig. 6). The table
contains gene names (left raw), their fold change (PEMF vs control, middle raw), and respective encoded cytokines/chemokines and their functions (right
raw). Upregulated genes are shown in red, and downregulated genes are shown in blue

after stroke. This once more demonstrates complexity of the
cytokine function, and their ether “beneficial” or “harmful”
role at different stages after injury. Our results are in agreement with the reported differential effect of magnetic fields on
pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression during initial
and sustained inflammatory response, at different stages of
wound healing [47]. We can conclude that PEMF provides a
moderate reduction of inflammation on the early stages and a
stronger suppression of the inflammation process at later
stages of poststroke recovery. More importantly, PEMF treatment has a consistent suppressive effect on inflammation: it
significantly reduces major pro-inflammatory IL-1α gene expression, and at the same time, upregulates major pro-

inflammatory IL-10. The results obtained in this study confirm the anti-inflammatory action of PEMF reported in wide
range of clinical studies [14–17].
In summary, based on the wide variety of literature it is
evident that a growing number of patients have received
clinical benefit from PEMF treatment, and new clinical indications of its beneficial effects are emerging. We propose that
PEMF treatment may be potentially utilized as a noninvasive
and long-lasting adjunctive treatment during recovery after
stroke. We demonstrated that PEMF application has positive
effects on neuroinflammation even if it is initiated as late as
3 days after stroke; this might be of special interest for clinicians since patients often receive medical treatment within

Transl. Stroke Res. (2014) 5:491–500

several hours to several days after the onset of stroke. Potential
benefits of PEMF as adjunctive treatment may include preservation of cerebral tissue in the penumbral area, as well as
regulation of inflammation and neurorestoration after the
stroke-related brain injury.
