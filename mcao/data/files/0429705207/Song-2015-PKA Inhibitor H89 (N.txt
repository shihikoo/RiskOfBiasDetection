The cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which activates prosurvival signaling proteins, has been implicated in the
expression of long-term potentiation and hippocampal long-term memory. It has come to light that H89 commonly known as
the PKA inhibitor have diverse roles in the nervous system that are unrelated to its role as a PKA inhibitor. We have investigated
the role of H89 in ischemic and reperfusion injury. First, we examined the expression of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95),
microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), and synaptophysin in mouse brain after middle cerebral artery occlusion injury. Next,
we examined the role of H89 pretreatment on the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), PSD95, MAP2, and
the apoptosis regulators Bcl2 and cleaved caspase-3 in cultured neuroblastoma cells exposed to hypoxia and reperfusion injury. In
addition, we investigated the alteration of AKT activation in H89 pretreated neuroblastoma cells under hypoxia and reperfusion
injury. The data suggest that H89 may contribute to brain recovery after ischemic stroke by regulating neuronal death and proteins
related to synaptic plasticity.

1. Introduction
Protein kinase A (PKA) [1] acts to phosphorylate other
proteins, regulating them in a reversible manner. When cyclic
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) binds to the subunits of
PKA, they undergo a conformational change that promotes
phosphorylation [2]. PKA is implicated also in neural health.
It stimulates neurite outgrowth in neurons and neuronal cell
lines [3, 4] and promotes axon regeneration in vivo [5, 6].
cAMP/PKA signaling affects long-term synaptic plasticity
and long-term memory [7].
Many studies that evaluate the role of PKA, which
include smooth muscle cells [8, 9], neuronal tissue [10,
11], and epithelial cells [12, 13], have relied on the isoquinoline derivative N-[2-p-bromocinnamylamino-ethyl]-5isoquinolinesulfonamide (H89), an inhibitor of PKA. H89
has an inhibition constant (ùêæùëñ ) of 0.05 mM in its inhibition
of PKA [14, 15]. However, effects of H89 that are unrelated

to its inhibition have been observed. In a kinase study, at
a concentration of 10 ùúáM, H89 inhibited the activity of the
protein kinases Rho-associated kinase- (ROCK-) II, MSK1
and the ribosomal protein S6 kinase ùõΩ-1 (S6K1) far more
potently than it inhibited PKA itself [16]. In addition, H89
10 ùúáM maintains the neurite outgrowth of neuroblastoma
cells [17]. There are several reports that H89 reduced Ca2+
uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by attenuating the
Ca2+ -ATPase‚Äôs [18] affinity for calcium [19]. At 20 ùúáM, H89
prevented the glucose-induced increase in cytosolic calcium
in pancreatic islets and attenuated the release of calcium
in a differentiated ùõΩ-cell line. In a study of expression of
myelin basic protein in oligodendrocytes, H89 is involved in
the phosphorylation of extracellular-signal‚Äìregulated kinase
1 and 2 (ERK 1 and 2) phosphorylation in response to insulinlike growth factor-1 [20] and it lowered potassium current
through voltage-gated channels in rat myocytes [21].

2
Of particular interest is the H89 inhibition of S6K1, noted
above. S6K1 is a downstream target of the mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR) protein, which regulates the autophagy
pathway [22] and is a mechanism target for regulation of cell
size [23]. Several researchers have questioned the role of PKA
in autophagy, since the studies rely at least in part on the
selectivity of H89, which they consider uncertain [24, 25].
The second issue involves the action of H89 itself. Clearly, it
has physiological effects unrelated to PKA. We have elected
to examine those effects and chose to focus on H89‚Äôs role in
neural health, especially ischemic stroke.
Cerebral ischemia leads to neuronal death and synaptic
dysfunction, resulting in cognitive decline [26‚Äì29]. Understanding the pathogenesis after ischemic stroke should
inform medical care and maximize recovery. In the present
study, we investigated the role of H89 in many aspects of
nervous system function. Specifically, we examined its role in
the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
in the development of neurites to axons [30‚Äì32], learning and
memory [33], synaptic plasticity [34], the expression of B-cell
lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) [35, 36] as it relates to neuronal death,
the expression of synaptophysin [37], postsynaptic density
protein 95 (PSD-95) [38, 39] as it relates to synaptic plasticity, and the expression of microtubule-associated protein
2 (MAP2). The latter interacts with actin filaments, shown
to be necessary for neurite outgrowth [40‚Äì43] in a middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) animal model and in an in
vitro study. In present study, we suggest that H89 may confer
protection from brain damage following cerebral ischemia.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Animal Model. Male C57BL/6 mice (Orient, GyeongGiDo, Korea) that were eight-to-twelve weeks old were used
in this study. Hypoxia followed by reperfusion (H/R) was
imposed by subjecting mice to transient focal cerebral
ischemia by intraluminal middle cerebral artery blockade
with a nylon suture, as previously described [44]. After
60 min of MCAO, blood flow was restored by withdrawing
the suture and regional cerebral blood flow was monitored
with a laser Doppler flow meter (Transonic Systems, Inc.,
Ithaca, NY, USA). All animal procedures and experiments
were performed in accordance with the Guide to the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care. All procedures were done at room temperature
unless indicated otherwise. We used 5 rats in each group for
study. Each measurement included 3 repeats per animal.
2.2. Immunohistochemistry. Frozen brain sections were cut
into 5 ùúám sections and mounted on clean glass slides (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), air-dried, and fixed in cold
acetone for 10 min at ‚àí20‚àò C. The slides were washed in
Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 nM Tris (pH 7.2), 150 mM
NaCl), incubated with 0.3% H2 O2 in methanol to quench
endogenous peroxidase activity, and washed three times
with distilled water, and the sections were blocked with
10% normal rabbit serum. Additional frozen brain sections
(20 ùúám) were fixed in ice-cold acetone for 20 min. To block

nonspecific labeling, sections were incubated in 5% bovine
serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)
in 0.1% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min before
addition of primary and secondary antibodies. Primary
antibodies for PSD-95 (1 : 100, Millipore, Massachusetts, MA,
USA), synaptophysin (1 : 100, Millipore, Massachusetts, MA,
USA), and MAP2 (1 : 100, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA)
were applied to the samples for 24 h at 4‚àò C; then the samples
were incubated with the appropriate florescence secondary
antibody (1 : 100, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 90 min,
washed three times for 10 min in PBS with Tween-20 (PBST),
and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit
or fluorescein isothiocyanate- (FITC-) conjugated sheep antimouse secondary antibody (both diluted to 1 : 200 with
5% BSA fraction V in 0.1% PBST) for 2 h in the dark.
This was followed by three washes in PBS and incubation
in 1 ùúág/mL 4Û∏Ä† ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for counterstaining. Tissues
were then visualized under a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM
700, Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA).
2.3. Cell Culture. Neuro2A (N2A) cells purchased from
ATCC biotechnology (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were
derived from mouse neuroblastoma. The cells exhibited
properties of neuronal stem cells and were capable of differentiating into neuron-like cells in the presence of retinoic acid
(RA). Undifferentiated N2A cells were cultured in Dulbecco‚Äôs
modified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) and
100 ùúág/mL penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY,
USA). N2A cells were passaged at least twice and then plated
at 5 √ó 104 cells/mL in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS
for 24 h, after which the medium was changed to DMEM
supplemented with 2% FBS and 20 ùúáM RA for differentiation.
Cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5%
CO2 at 37‚àò C. The medium was changed every two days [45].
2.4. Hypoxia and Reperfusion (H/R) and H89 Treatment.
Confluent cells were transferred to an anaerobic chamber
(Forma Scientific, OH, USA, O2 tension = 0.1%). They
were washed three times with PBS and the culture medium
was replaced with deoxygenated, glucose-free balanced salt
solution and incubated for 4 h. Following H/R injury, cells
were incubated for 18 h under normal growth conditions
[46]. H89 (10 ùúáM, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was
treated in the N2A cells at 2 h before H/R injury. In present
study, we used the 10 ùúáM concentration of H89, considering
previous researches regarding other functions except from
PKA inhibitor[17‚Äì19, 47, 48].
2.5. Neurite Length Measurement. To determine the length
of their neurites, the cells were fixed for 20 min in 3.7%
formaldehyde. Neurite formation was defined as an outgrowth from the cell body that was longer than the diameter
of the cell body. N2A cells in three randomly selected fields
(30‚Äì100 cells per field) were measured using ImageJ software
(ImageJ, Madison, WI, USA) [49]. At least 30 cells per
treatment were scored [50].

2.6. Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR). To examine the
expression of BDNF, Bcl2, and MAP2 in N2A cells after
H/R injury, RT-PCR was performed. Briefly, samples were
lysed with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer‚Äôs protocol. Complementary DNA synthesis from
mRNA and sample normalization was performed. PCR
was performed using the following thermal cycling conditions: 10 min at 95‚àò C, 35 cycles of denaturing at 95‚àò C for
15 sec, annealing for 30 sec at 70‚àò C, elongation at 72‚àò C for
30 sec, final extension for 10 min at 72‚àò C, and maintenance
at 4‚àò C. PCR was performed using the following primers

2.7. Western Blot Analysis. After H/R injury, cells were
washed rapidly with ice-cold PBS, scraped, and collected.
Cell pellets were lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The lysates were centrifuged
at 13,200 rpm for 1 h at 4‚àò C to produce whole-cell extracts.
Protein was quantified with the bicinchoninic acid (BCA)
method (Pierce biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA). Protein
(20 ùúág) was separated on a 10% SDS‚Äìpolyacrylamide (PAGE)

gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membrane. After blocking with 5% BSA (in TBS/Tween
[TBS-T]) for 1 h, immunoblots were incubated overnight at
4‚àò C with primary antibodies specific for Bcl2 (1 : 2000, Millipore, Massachusetts, MA, USA), cleaved caspase-3 (1 : 2000,
Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), PSD-95 (1 : 2000, Millipore, Massachusetts, MA, USA), AKT (1 : 2000, Cell signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), p-AKT (1 : 2000, Cell signaling,
Danvers, MA, USA), or ùõΩ-actin (1 : 2000, Santa Cruz, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA). Next, blots were incubated with horseradish
peroxidase- (HRP-) linked anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG
antibodies purchased from Abcam (Abcam, Cambridge, MA,
USA) for 1 h. Enhanced chemiluminescence was performed
by electrochemiluminescence (ECL: Pierce Biotechnology,
Rockford, IL, USA) [51].
2.8. Immunocytochemistry. The expression of BDNF, cleaved
caspase-3, Bcl2, and PSD-95 in N2A cells was confirmed by

immunocytochemistry. Cells in all experimental groups were
washed three times with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 h, and then washed with PBS. N2A cells were
permeabilized with 0.025% Triton X-100 and blocked for
1 h with dilution buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
The following primary antibodies: anti-rabbit BDNF (1 : 500,
Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), anti-rabbit cleaved caspase-3
(1 : 500, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-rabbit PSD95 (1 : 500, Millipore, Massachusetts, MA, USA), anti-mouse
Bcl2 (1 : 500, Millipore, Massachusetts, MA, USA) were prepared in dilution buffer, added to samples, and incubated
for 3 h. Primary antibody was then removed and cells were
washed three times for 3 min each with PBS. Later, samples were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat, anti-rabbit
(1 : 200, Jackson Immunoresearch, PA, USA), or rhodamineconjugated donkey, anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1 : 500,
Millipore, Massachusetts, MA, USA) for 2 h. Cells were
washed again three times for 3 min each with PBS and stained

with 1 ùúág/mL DAPI (1 : 100, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA) for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed samples were
imaged using a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope (Carl
Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA).

3. Results
3.1. MCAO Mouse Brain Exhibited Neuronal Death and
Synaptic Plasticity Damage. We performed immunohistochemistry of the brain of H/R injured and control mice, using
antibodies to synaptophysin (Figure 1), PSD-95 (Figure 2),
and MAP2 (Figures 1 and 2). The former two were used as
markers of synaptic plasticity; the latter is considered to be a
neuronal microtubule protein marker. The immunoreactivity
of all three proteins was less in the H/R injured group than
in the control group. These results indicate that cerebral
ischemia suppresses the expression of synaptophysin, PSD95, and MAP2 in ischemic brain and that synaptic neuronal
microtubule proteins were damaged by ischemic injury.
3.2. H/R Injury in Neuro2A Cells Inhibited, and H89 Pretreatment Restored, Neurite Outgrowth. Neurite outgrowth of
Neuro2A cells was assessed by measuring neurite length with
ImageJ software (Figure 3). The average length of normal
N2A cells was approximately 65 ùúám, whereas neurites of
cells subjected to H/R injury were approximately 26 ùúám long
(Figure 3(a)). Neurites from cells that had been pretreated
with H89 before H/R injury were, on average, approximately
45 ùúám, or almost twice that of the injured cells that were
not pretreated (Figure 3(a)). Bright-field images showed the
neurite length in all groups (Figures 3(b), 3(c), and 3(d)). The
yellow line in all images permits easy comparison of neurite
lengths.
We also performed RT-PCR (Figure 4) to assess MAP2, a
protein essential to neurite growth [41, 42]. The mRNA level
of MAP2 in H/R injured N2A cells was reduced considerably
compared to the control group (Figure 4). We conclude
that H/R injury leads to reduction of neurite outgrowth,
which can be alleviated by H89 pretreatment. Thus, H89 may
ameliorate the effects of H/R injury.
3.3. Cell Survival Was Increased in H89 Pretreated Neuro2A
Cells after H/R Injury. To confirm whether or not H89
is involved in the neuronal cell death during H/R injury,
we conducted the immunocytochemistry (Figures 5(a) and
5(b)), western blot analysis (Figures 5(c) and 5(d)), and
RT-PCR (Figure 7(b)) using cleaved caspase-3 (as a marker
of mitochondrial cell death) and Bcl2 (as a marker of
anti-apoptosis) antibodies. H/R injured N2A cells were
observed: the reduced Bcl2 immunoreactivity (Figure 5(b)),

caspase-3 immunoreactivity (Figure 5(a)), and the increased
cleaved caspase-3 protein level (Figure 5(c)). H89 pretreatment before H/R injury group showed the increased Bcl2
expression (Figures 5(b), 5(d), and 7(b)) and the reduced
cleaved caspase-3 expression (Figures 5(a) and 5(c)) compared with the H/R group. These results indicated that the
cell death in N2A cells was attenuated by H89 pretreatment
in spite of hypoxia and reperfusion injury. Thus, we suggest
that H89 may contribute to the neuronal cell survival pathway
under hypoxia and reperfusion injury.
3.4. The Increase of BDNF Expression in Neuro2A Cells
Pretreated with H89 in Hypoxia Reperfusion Injury. We
performed immunocytochemistry analysis (Figure 6) and
RT-PCR (Figure 7(a)) using BDNF as the representative of
neurotrophic factors in N2A cells to examine whether there
was the alteration of neurotrophic factor expression in H89
pretreated N2A cells under hypoxia and reperfusion injury.
We observed evidently lesser immunoreactivity of BDNF
(Figure 6) in the H/R injured N2A cells compared to the
normal control group. However, BDNF- (Figure 6) positive
cells were obviously more expressed in H89 pretreated N2A
cells than the H/R injury group. In addition, the BDNF
mRNA level in N2A cells was higher in H89 pretreated N2A

reduce expression of PSD-95 against H/R injury compared
to H/R injured N2A cells. It is possible to extrapolate these
results to suggest that the H/R injury reduced the expression
of PSD-95. Data tend to support the conclusion that H89 may
alleviate the synaptic plasticity damage of N2A cells against
ischemic stress.

hypoxia and reperfusion stress suppresses the expression of
BDNF in N2A cells, whereas H89 pretreatment H/R injured
N2A cells considerably did not reduced the expression of
BDNF against H/R injury. Based on these consequences, our
results suggest that neurotrophic factor BDNF‚Äôs expression
was not reduced by H89 pretreatment despite ischemic injury.
Thus, H89 may contribute to the expression of BDNF in N2A
cells following hypoxia and reperfusion stress.
3.5. The Preservation of PSD-95 Expression in Neuro2A Cells
Pretreated with H89 during Hypoxia Reperfusion Injury. We
performed immunocytochemistry analysis (Figure 8(a)) and
western blot analysis (Figure 8(b)) using PSD-95 antibody in
N2A cells to investigate whether there was the alteration of
synaptic plasticity related proteins in H89 pretreated N2A
cells under hypoxia and reperfusion injury. In addition, we
confirmed evidently decreased immunoreactivity of PSD-95
(Figure 8(a)) in the H/R injured N2A cells compared to the

cells than the H/R injury group (Figure 8(a)). Moreover, the
protein level of PSD-95 (Figure 8(b)) in N2A cells was slightly
higher in H89 pretreated N2A cells than the H/R injury

3.6. The Measurement of Phosphorylation AKT Protein Level
in H89 Pretreated Neuro2A Cells against Hypoxia Reperfusion
Injury. We performed western blot analysis (Figure 9) using
AKT and phosphorylation-AKT (p-AKT) antibody in N2A
cells to investigate the change of AKT phosphorylation in
H89 pretreated N2A cells under hypoxia and reperfusion
injury. The protein level of phosphorylation-AKT (Figure 9)
was evidently increased in H89 pretreated H/R injured N2A
cells than the H/R injury group. This result shows that
H89 considerably promotes the activation of AKT signaling
in N2A cells against H/R injury. Our data supports the
hypothesis that H89 may boost the phosphorylation of AKT
in N2A cells to survive the cells against ischemic stress.

4. Discussion
In cerebral ischemia, the reduction of synaptic dysfunction
and neuronal cell loss are important issues and are implicated in severe pathogenesis such as memory impairment
following ischemic stroke [26‚Äì29, 52, 53]. In the search for
a solution, many researchers study the molecules and the
signal pathways that lead to reduced synaptic plasticity and
cell death [54‚Äì56]; an example of one is PKA signaling [3‚Äì
7]. H89, known as the molecule commonly used to inhibit
PKA action, recently has been reported to have a variety
of functions unrelated to its effect on PKA inhibition [16,
18, 21, 57]. H89 affects ROCK II and, through that effect,
cell morphology [48] and neurite extension [58, 59]. The
data presented here indicate that H89 promotes neurite
outgrowth and protects it after hypoxia stress. MAP2 (known
as the neuron specific cytoskeletal protein) is present during
all stages of neuromorphogenesis [60] and is necessary
for neurite initiation [60‚Äì62]. Our MAP2 expression data
support the contention that H89 may also support neurite
outgrowth through MAP2. We speculate that the maintenance of neurite outgrowth after ischemic stroke is central
to the role of H89. Several studies have demonstrated that
H89 induces autophagy in cells independent of PKA signaling
[24, 25] and increases cell survival after inflammation [54,
63]. In the present study, we observed reduced expression of cleaved caspase-3 and increased expression of Bcl2
following pretreatment with H89, supporting the conclusion that H89 protects against hypoxia injury, specifically,
that it increases neuronal cell survival rate after ischemic
stroke. Neurotrophic molecules regulate synaptic plasticity
of the nervous system [64‚Äì66]. Specifically, many researches
demonstrated that BDNF accelerates the axogenesis [30‚Äì32],
promotes poststroke plasticity in an in vivo study [32, 67‚Äì
71], and contributes to healthy brain function, notably, neuronal survival and maintenance, neurogenesis, modulation of
dendritic branching and dendritic spine morphology [72, 73],

the BDNF expression in neuronal cells under ischemic brain
injury. Also H89 may be involved in neurite outgrowth by
regulating the preservation of synaptic proteins, such as PSD95 and synaptophysin, following ischemic brain damage.
AKT which is activated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
activity [97] has known to promote a cellular protection
after ischemic injury in the brain [98]. Moreover, AKT has
been reported that it mediates anti-apoptosis signalings in
ischemic stroke studies [99, 100]. Some study indicated that
H89 markedly enhances the phosphorylation of AKT [101].
Considering our results, we assume that H89 may contribute
to the survival of neuronal cells against ischemic injury
through the activation of AKT. In present study, although
learning and memory were not assessed in the animal model
used here and we has some limitations to identify the specific
molecular mechanism by H89, we propose that H89 may
ameliorate the pathophysiology following ischemic stroke by
reducing neuronal cell death and involving synaptic plasticity.

and development of neuronal connections required for learning and memory [74‚Äì76]. BDNF, through phosphorylation
of its TrkB receptor, activates a neuron-specific protein,
controls the actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines [77] and
their regression [78, 79], and promotes the actin polymerization [80]. Inhibition of BDNF synthesis results in smaller
spine heads and impairs long-term potentiation of synaptic
transmission [81, 82]. Moreover, BDNF signaling plays a
crucial role in the development of synapses by controlling the
transport of PSD-95, which is the major scaffolding protein
at mature glutamate synapses [83, 84]. PSD-95 itself and its
interaction with BDNF signaling have been implicated in
diverse brain diseases [85‚Äì87]. When localized in postsynaptic terminals, PSD-95 has an important role in postsynaptic
function and plasticity [88‚Äì90]. The loss of PSD-95 results in
severe cognitive decline due to loss of neurons and synaptic
disruption [91‚Äì93]. In addition, synaptophysin as a marker
of the pre-synaptic nerve terminal density is essential for
vesicle fusion and the release of neurotransmitter [94]. The
reduction of synaptophysin has been reported to reduce
synaptic plasticity in the brain [95, 96]. Our results suggest
that H89 may enhance synaptic plasticity by promoting
