Introduction

Despite the perception as an immune privilege site, immune
responses in the central nervous system (CNS) are common
which can be mediated by resident microglia, astrocyte and
inﬁltrating peripheral immune cells (Ransohoff and Brown,
2012). Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the CNS

and respond to all forms of insults by a process commonly
referred as reactive astrogliosis characterized as hypertrophy
of cellular processes and upregulation of intermediate
ﬁlament proteins as glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
(Sofroniew, 2009). Compelling evidence has indicated that
reactive astrogliosis is not simply an all-or-none phenomenon, but rather a ﬁnely tuned continuum of molecular,

cellular, and functional changes that range from subtle
alternations in gene expression to scar formation. Studies
indicate that reactive astrogliosis may exert both beneﬁcial
and detrimental effects in a context-dependent manner
regulated by speciﬁc molecular signaling cascades, including
signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT3),
nuclear factor kappaB (NFкB), and mTOR signaling after
spinal cord injury (Brambilla et al., 2005; Codeluppi et al.,
2009; Herrmann et al., 2008; Sofroniew, 2009).
In term of ischemic stroke, reactive astrogliosis with
compact glial scar formation may protect the surrounding
healthy brain from exposure to the toxic elements and
cellular debris in the infarct area. On the other hand, it may
also impede axonal regeneration, which, in turn, hinders the
functional recovery process. Surprisingly, our knowledge of
astrocyte pathophysiology and its underlying mechanisms
of glial scar formation after ischemic stroke are extremely
limited. A better understanding of signaling mechanisms that
regulate speciﬁc aspects of reactive astrogliosis after ischemic
stroke may lead to novel pharmacological strategies to
attenuate detrimental aspects of astrogliosis, enhance neural
repair processes, and improve stroke recovery.
p38 Mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) was ﬁrst
isolated as a 38-kDa protein that was rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation.
To date, four splice variants of the p38 family have been
identiﬁed: p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ. The main biological
response of p38 activation involves the production and
activation of inﬂammatory mediators to initiate leukocyte
recruitment and activation (Kumar et al., 2003). Of the four
p38 variants, p38α is the best characterized and perhaps the
most physiologically relevant kinase involved in inﬂammatory responses (Kumar et al., 2003). The activation of the p38
MAPK pathway plays essential roles in the production of proinﬂammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6. Currently, the majority of studies favor that these cytokines act
as perpetrators in the CNS injury (Wang and Shuaib, 2002). In
addition, increasing evidence has indicated that p38 plays a
role in many other biological functions in the CNS (Takeda
and Ichijo, 2002). Activation of p38 signaling after ischemic
stroke has been identiﬁed in neuron, astrocyte and microglia
(Ferrer et al., 2003; Krupinski et al., 2003; Nozaki et al., 2001;

47

Piao et al., 2002). Furthermore, inhibition of p38 activation has
been found to provide protection in experimental ischemic
stroke models (Barone et al., 2001; Legos et al., 2001, 2002;
Nito et al., 2008; Nozaki et al., 2001; Piao et al., 2003;
Strassburger et al., 2008). Thus, p38 MAPK has been recognized as a potential therapeutic target for ischemic stroke. In
the current study, we evaluated the role of p38 MAPK
signaling in astrogliosis after ischemic stroke. Using primary
astrocyte culture and mouse model middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) models, we demonstrated that inactivation
of p38 MAPK signaling abrogate ischemic stroke-induced
astrocyte reactivation.

Results

2.1.
Ischemic stroke induces GFAP and p38 expression
in the peri-infarct area
To investigate the role of p38 MAPK in astrocyte activation in
a transient mouse MCAO model, Western blot was performed
using protein isolated from ischemic cortex. We found that
GFAP expression was increased in the ischemic cortex at
day 4, and remained elevated up to day 10 after stroke, in
parallel with a similar p38 MAPK activation pattern (Fig. 1A).
Immunohistochemistry indicated that GFAP- and p38 MAPKimmune reactive cells were barely detectable in the ischemic
core. However, these immune reactive cells were slightly
increased 1 day (Fig. 1B), and dramatically increased 10 days
after stroke in the peri-infarct area (Fig. 1B). These results
indicated the potential involvement of p38 MAPK signaling in
astrogliosis after ischemic stroke.

2.2.
Inactivation of p38 MAPK inhibits astrocyte
activation induced by transient OGD
We determined the effect of p38 inactivation in astrogliosis in
primary astrocyte cultures using both pharmacological and
genomic approaches. Our Western blot analysis indicated that
OGD/reoxygenation insult induced astrogliosis evidenced by the
increases of GFAP expression, which was associated with an
activation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 2A). In addition, the increase of

after OGD/reoxygenation. (B) Quantitative analysis of GFAP Western blots demonstrated that OGD/reoxygenation induced a
signiﬁcant increase in GFAP expression and p38 activation (pp38), which was signiﬁcantly attenuated by SB239063 (10 lg/ml).

GFAP expression induced by transient OGD was totally blocked
by the treatment of p38 inhibitor, SB239063 (Fig. 2A and B).
The involvement of p38 in astrogliosis was further evaluated using primary astrocyte cultures derived from conditional GFAP/p38 knockout mice. Western blot analysis of
primary astrocyte cultures derived from wild type (WT) and
GFAP/p38 knock out (GFAP/p38KO) demonstrated that knockout p38 MAPK dramatically decreased basal GFAP expression
under normal cell culture condition (Fig. 3A). Consistently,
the transient OGD induced astrocyte activation in wild type
astrocyte culture which was attenuated in p38 MAPK knockout astrocyte cultures (Fig. 3B and C). Our gelatin zymography
indicated that p38 MAPK knockout astrocytes had signiﬁcant lower MMP-9 activity as compared with wild type
astrocytes (Fig. 3D and E). We determined the expression of

two important cytokines whose expression is regulated by
p38 MAPK pathway. Results from quantitative PCR analysis
indicated that conditional p38 knockout primary astrocyte
cultures had signiﬁcantly lower expression of the proinﬂammatory cytokine TNF-α (Fig 4A) and signiﬁcantly higher
expression of anti-inﬂammatory cytokine TGF-β (Fig. 4B)
when compared to wild type primary astrocyte cultures.

2.3.
Inactivation of p38 MAPK attenuates scratch injury
induced increase of GFAP expression
We investigated the role of p38 MAPK in scratch injury
induced astrogliosis in primary astrocyte cultures. Our immunocytochemistry showed a robust increase in GFAP expression along the edge of the scratch in primary astrocyte

cultures at 3 days after injury, which was attenuated by the
treatment of SB239063 (Fig. 5A). Similarly, wild type astrocytes showed a dramatic increase of GFAP expression and p38

MAPK activation after scratch, which was almost totally
attenuated in primary astrocyte cultures derived from
GFAP/p38 knock mice (Fig. 5B).

2.4.
p38 MAPK inactivation attenuates
astrocyte migration
We determined the role of p38 MAPK in astrocyte migration
using in vitro wound healing assay. At 24 and 48 h after
scratch injury large gaps were clearly evident in the SB239063
treated primary astrocyte culture as compared with wild type
astrocyte cultures (Fig. 6A and B). Consistently, primary
astrocyte cultures derived from p38 MAPK knockout mice
have signiﬁcant slower wound healing process when compared with wild type primary astrocyte cultures (Fig. 6C).
In transwell migration assay, p38 MAPK inactivation by either
SB239063 or p38 knockout signiﬁcantly attenuates cell migration (Fig. 7A and B). To rule out the probability that the effect
of p38 inactivation on wound healing and cell and migration
assays is due to the potential action of p38 on cell proliferation, we determined the effect of p38 inhibition on growth
curve and cell cycle in primary astrocyte cultures. No signiﬁcant difference was observed in either primary astrocyte
proliferation or cell cycle upon SB239063 treatment (Fig. 7C–E).

2.5.
Conditional GFAP/p38 knockout attenuates
astrogliosis after ischemic stroke
In a pilot study, we chose transient MCAO model in which a
lower mortality and smaller lesion was observed in GFAP/p38
knockout mice. To minimize the potential inﬂuence of infarct
volume on astrogliosis, we determined the role of p38 MAPK
in astrogliosis induced by ischemic stroke using a mouse
permanent distal MCAO model. The mortality was 50% and
46% in littermates and GFAP/p38 knockout mice, respectively.

The behavioral test battery indicated that there was no
signiﬁcant different in motor function recovery after ischemic
stroke between GFAP/p38 knockout mice and littermate
controls (Fig. 8A–D). Cresyl violet staining of brain sections
after permanent MCAO showed no signiﬁcant difference in
the size of the infarcts between GFAP/p38 knockout mice and
wild type littermates (Fig. 8E and F). Morphometric analysis of
GFAP immunohistochemistry demonstrated that GFAP/p38
knockout mice had signiﬁcantly less GFAP positive cells in
the per-infarct region compared with the wild type littermates (Fig. 9A). Further quantitative analysis of astrocyte size
in the per-infarct area indicated that astrocytes were signiﬁcantly fewer and smaller in GFAP/p38 knockout mice than
wild type littermates (po0.001) (Fig. 9B and C). Western blot
analysis indicated a signiﬁcant reduction of GFAP expression
in ischemic and non-ischemic cortex of GFAP/p38 knockout
mice as compared with wild type (po0.05) (Fig. 9D and E).

Discussion

p38 MAPK has been well recognized as the key signaling in
peripheral immune response. There is increasing evidence
that p38 MAPK might also play a role in neuroinﬂammation
in CNS. In primary neuron-glia co-cultures, activation of p38
MAPK has been found in both neuron and astrocyte following
lipopolysaccharide treatment and inhibition of p38 partially
blocked neuron death in the LPS-treated co-cultures (Xie
et al., 2004). In an Alzheimer's disease mouse model, p38
MAPK inhibitor has been shown to suppress brain proinﬂammatory cytokine up-regulation and attenuates synaptic

dysfunction and behavioral deﬁcits (Munoz et al., 2007). It has
been suggested that p38 MAPK is involved in the cytokinestimulated CCL2 and CCL7 production in primary astrocyte
cultures (Thompson and Van Eldik, 2009). Activation of p38
MAPK has been reported to be involved in sciatic nerve
ligation-induced proliferation of spinal cord astrocytes (Xu
et al., 2007). Delayed induction of p38 MAPK in reactive
astrocytes was found in mice brain after kainic acidinduced seizure (Che et al., 2001). In the present study, we
provided both in vitro and in vivo evidence that p38 MAPK
signaling pathway plays an important role in astrocyte
activation and glial scar formation after ischemic stroke.

Clinically and experimentally, ischemic stroke is followed by
inﬂammatory response contributing to both ischemic damage
cascade and repairing process. Astrocytes in ischemic core and
peri-infarct region undergo various responses to ischemic
injury. In the mouse experimental ischemic stroke model, a
dramatic loss of astrocyte in the ischemic core was observed
evidenced by the loss of GFAP immune reactivity in the
ischemic territory. In the peri-infarct region, a progressive
astrogliosis was observed indicated by the increase of GFAP
positive cells number and hypertrophy of GFAP positive cells.
In addition, a similar pattern of change in p38 MAPK immunohistochemistry was found with a loss of p38 MAPK immune

reactive cells in the ischemic core and increase of p38 MAPK
immune reactive cells in the peri-infarct region. These ﬁndings
suggest that p38 MAPK might be involved in the astrogliosis
induced by ischemic stroke.
We determined the involvement of p38 MAPK in astrogliosis using primary astrocyte cultures. Inactivation of p38
MAPK was achieved by either a p38 inhibitor or using primary
astrocyte derived from GFAP/p38 knockout mice. Our ﬁndings
demonstrated that p38 MAPK signaling is involved in the
astrocyte activation which could be attenuated by both
pharmacological and genomic inactivation of p38 MAPK.
p38 MAPK signaling pathway is also known to play a crucial
role in synthesis and signaling of cytokines like TNF-α (Lee
et al., 2000; Zarubin and Han, 2005) and TGF-β (Dziembowska
et al., 2007) both of which are known to alter during reactive
astrogliosis (Gao et al., 2013). Our study demonstrated that
inactivation of p38 signaling signiﬁcantly attenuated the
proinﬂammatory cytokine TNF-α while at the same had
a higher expression of anti-inﬂammatory cytokine TGF-β
expression. Astrocyte migration in the CNS is a fundamental
component of glial scarring (Auguste et al., 2007). There is an

indication that p38 MAPK is involved in the cellular migration
in epithelial wound healing process without affecting proliferation (Sharma et al., 2003). Our study suggested that
inactivation of p38 MAPK attenuates astrocyte migration,
evidenced by the wound healing and transwell migration
assays. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) degrade a variety
of protein constituents in the extracellular matrix and thus
remodel the peri-cellular microenvironment for astrocyte
translocation and glial scar formation (Hsu et al., 2008).
Consistently, our study demonstrated that inhibition of p38
MAPK decreases MMPs action in primary astrocyte culture.
No effect of p38 inhibition on astrocyte proliferation and cell
cycle was observed.
We determined the role of p38 in astrogliosis induced by
ischemic stroke using mouse MCAO model. Since p38 inhibition has been found to be protective in ischemic stroke
model (Barone et al., 2001; Legos et al., 2002; Nito et al.,
2008; Nozaki et al., 2001; Piao et al., 2003; Strassburger et al.,
2008), conditional GFAP/p38 knockout may provide protective
effect in the transient MCAO model. To minimize the potential inﬂuences of infarct size in astrogliosis, we adopted a

and non-ischemic hemisphere compared to wild type littermates (npo0.05 vs. wild type non ischemic hemisphere. #po0.05

permanent distal MCAO model to ensure similar extent
ischemic lesion size in both conditional GFAP/p38 knockout
mice and littermates. Similar mortality and motor function
outcome were observed in GFAP/p38 knockout mice and
littermate controls. No signiﬁcant difference in the infarct
volume was found between GFAP/p38 knockout and wild
mice. We predict that the intense and permanent ischemic
insult might have dampened the potential beneﬁcial effect of
astrocyte speciﬁc p38 deletion. Our unbiased stereological
analysis of GFAP immunohistochemistry indicated conditional knockout of p38 in astrocyte signiﬁcantly attenuated
astrogliosis at the early stage after ischemic stroke.
Compelling evidence has indicated that reactive astrogliosis is a complex process either through loss of essential
functions performed by astrocytes or by gain of detrimental
effects after activation (Sofroniew, 2009). It has been long
recognized that astrogliosis may have a pathological effect by

interfering with the function of residual neuronal circuits.
Many studies have demonstrated the detrimental effects of
glial scar on axonal regeneration after ischemic injury (Cua
et al., 2013; Hill et al., 2012; Iseki et al., 2012), preventing
axonal remyelination and inhibiting axonal regeneration
(Sofroniew, 2009; Wang and Shuaib, 2002). The inhibitory
action of glial scar on axonal regeneration may impair motor
function recovery. On the other hand, increasing evidence
has indicated that reactive astrocytes have potentially beneﬁcial effect. Cell type-speciﬁc and temporal control of astrocyte deletion has been applied in combination with various
forms of experimental CNS insults, including forebrain stab
injury (Bush et al., 1999), spinal cord injury (Faulkner et al.,
2004), traumatic brain injury (Myer et al., 2006) and autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Voskuhl et al., 2009). In all
of these models, ablation of proliferating reactive astrocytes
disrupted scar formation, which in turn resulted in increased

54

spread and persistence of inﬂammatory cells, failure of BBB
repairing, increased tissue damage and lesion size, increased
neuronal loss and demyelination, and exacerbation of clinical
signs or impaired function recovery, providing evidence that
scar forming astrocytes play essential roles in neural protection and repair (Sofroniew, 2009).
Knockout of molecules produced by reactive astrocytes has
provided insight regarding the roles of speciﬁc molecules in
reactive astrogliosis (Correa-Cerro and Mandell, 2007; Sofroniew,
2009). Double deletion of GFAP and vimentin reduces astrogliosis
and increases axon regeneration, but exacerbates ischemic
stroke (Li et al., 2008) by increasing lesion size and worsening
outcome. In contrast, conditional deletion or functional knockdown in astrocytes of the signaling molecules suppressor of
cytokine signaling or NFкB reduces inﬂammation and lesion size
after spinal cord injury or EAE (Brambilla et al., 2009; Okada
et al., 2006). Taken together, these ﬁndings indicate complex
functions of reactive astrogliosis, which might differ in response
to different signaling mechanisms in a context-speciﬁc manner
(Sofroniew, 2009). Thus, intervention of speciﬁc signaling pathway might be able to augment or block speciﬁc function of
reactive astrocyte, hence, enhance neural repair process without
comprising the beneﬁcial effect of astrogliosis. Our study indicated that p38 signaling is involved in astrogliosis after ischemic
stroke and that inactivation of p38 MAPK attenuates astrogliosis
without affecting the acute outcome in a permanent MCAO
model. As stroke induced neurogenesis and axonal sprouting in
the peri-infarct area matures in a much delayed manner (Kuge
et al., 2009; Li and Carmichael, 2006), future studies are needed
to examine the effect of p38 signaling inactivation on neurogenesis, axonal sprouting, and long term functional recovery in
experimental ischemic stroke models. In addition, astrocyte has
been shown to play a critical role in angiogenesis after ischemic
stroke (Hayakawa et al., 2010). Inhibition of p38 signaling might
affect the angiogenesis process induced by ischemic stroke
through its action on astrogliosis.
In our current study, the role of p38 in reactive astrogliosis
was determined in primary astrocyte cultures in order to
determine the fundamental mechanism underlying astrocyte
activation in response to ischemic injury which is very difﬁcult
in vivo considering the interaction of multiple cell types and the
expression of p38MAPK in both neuron and glial cells. Our
in vitro studies employed hypoxia-reoxygenation model to
simulate ischemic stroke. Scratch injury assay, a most commonly used model of in vitro astrogliosis (Etienne-Manneville,
2006; Parmentier-Batteur et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2007) was used
as an additional model of cellular injury to further validate our
ﬁndings from hypoxia-reoxygenation model. However as with
in vitro models our study presented certain limitations such as
short duration of endpoints compared to in vivo studies. In
addition, our current in vivo study used constitutive astrocyte
speciﬁc p38 knockout mouse model which does not enable to
study the role of p38 in astrogliosis in a temporal dependent
manner. Further studies using inducible astrocyte speciﬁc p38
MAPK knockout mouse model may provide critical insight for
the action of spatiotemporal p38 inhibition on glial scar formation and functional outcome after ischemic stroke.
In summary, the present study provides the ﬁrst in vitro
and in vivo evidence that p38 MAPK signaling pathway plays
an important role in the astrogliosis after ischemic stroke.

The neuroprotective effect of acute p38 MAPK inhibition
against ischemic stroke has been well deﬁned in experimental ischemic stroke models (Barone et al., 2001; Legos et al.,
2002; Nito et al., 2008; Nozaki et al., 2001; Piao et al., 2003;
Strassburger et al., 2008). The robust neuroprotection induced
by p38 MAPK inhibition emphasizes a signiﬁcant opportunity
for targeting p38 MAPK for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
However, the translational potential of p38 inhibition to
clinical practice for acute stroke treatment is very limited,
given the short therapeutic window of neuroprotective intervention for acute stroke treatment and the disappointing
outcome of the neuroprotection clinical trials. On the other
hand, given the progressive course of astrogliosis and wellestablished inhibitory action of glial scar on axonal sprouting
and neurite growth, p38 MAPK may serve as an essential
target for dissecting the molecular mechanism underlying
glial scar formation after ischemic stroke. In addition, given
that some p38 MAPK inhibitors are already in clinical trials,
p38 inhibition may provide a novel therapy for temporal
control of glial scar formation, hence, enhance axonal sprouting and neurite growth and improve stroke recovery.

Experimental procedures

4.1.

Animals

Animal experimentation was approved by Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of University of North Texas
Health Science Center. Adult male C57B/6 mice (3 months old:
Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were used for the study. The
astrocyte speciﬁc p38 knockout mice were established by crossing two mouse lines, the FloxP p38α and Tg (GFAP-cre) 25MEs
(JAX laboratory). Flox p38α has ﬂoxed alleles that were generated
by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells (Lexicon), in which the ﬁrst exon (containing ATG) was ﬂanked by
two loxP sites (Engel et al., 2005). When crossed with FloxP p38α
mice, GFAP-cre mediated recombination results in astrocytespeciﬁc deletion of the p38α. In our breeding strategy, Flox
p38þ/þ were cross bred with (FloxP  p38þ/þ)/(GFAP  creþ/ mice),
which generate 50% conditional astrocyte p38 knockout mice
and 50% wide type littermates.

4.2.

Genotyping

All the pups were weaned at age of 4 weeks and ID chips were
implanted. Tails were cut and lysed overnight at 55 1C.
The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min and
supernatant was collected. The supernatant was diluted at
1:100 and used for PCR using standard Cre and p38 primers:
GFAP CreF, 5'-AGCGATCGCTGCCAGGAT-3'; GFAP CreR,
5'-ACCAGCGTTTTCGTTCTGCC-3'; p38 B12–125L, 5'-AGTCCCCGAGAGTTCCTGCCTC-3'; p38 B12–41L, 5'-TCCTACGAGCGTCGGCAAGGT-3' (Engel et al., 2005). Thirty-ﬁve PCR cycles were
run consisting of denaturation at 95 1C for 1 min, annealing at
60 1C for 2 min, and extension at 72 1C for 1 min, followed by a
ﬁnal extension for 5 min. The PCR products were resolved on
a 2.0% agarose gel. The transgenic GFAP cre/Flox p38 mice
were then conﬁrmed by the presence of transgene at 190 base
pair (internal positive control at 700 bp).

4.3.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion models

All surgeries were conducted under 2.0% isoﬂurane anesthesia. Body temperature was maintained at 3770.5 1C with a
thermostat-controlled heating blanket during the entire procedure. Transient MCAO was performed to induce transient
focal cerebral ischemia in adult C57B/6 mice. A midline
incision was made on the neck. Common carotid artery,
external carotid artery and internal carotid artery (ICA) were
dissected from the connective tissue. A silicon coated 6–0
nylon monoﬁlament was inserted into the left ICA and
advanced till it occluded the origin of MCA. The MCA was
occluded for 90 min and then reperfusion was obtained by
withdrawing the suture. The animals were sacriﬁced at days
1, 4 and 10 after MCAO and brains were harvested for
immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. In a separate set of mice (11 to 12 months of age), permanent
distal MCAO was induced in GFAP/p38 knockout mice
(n¼ 15) and wild type littermates (n ¼8) via craniectomy as
previously described (Jin, 2010 #32). A skin incision was
made between the left eye and ear. A burr hole was drilled
through the temporal bone. The dura mater was removed
and the MCA was occluded permanently using a bipolar
coagulator. The mice were sacriﬁced at 4 days after stroke
and brain harvested for immunohistochemistry and Western
blot analysis.

4.4.

Primary astrocyte cultures

Primary astrocyte cultures were prepared from 1-day old
pups of C57B6 mice, conditional GFAP/p38 MAPK knockout
mice, or wild type littermates. Under aseptic conditions
cerebral cortices were dissected and placed in sterile phenol
red free Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM,
4500 mg/l glucose, 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate,
Thermo Scientiﬁc) containing 1% of streptomycin (10,000 mg/ml)penicillin (10,000 units/ml). Cerebral cortices were then incubated in 0.5% trypsin at 37 1C for 20 min and using a sterile glass
Pasteur pipette were dissociated into a single cell suspension.
Primary astrocytes were then cultured in High Glucose DMEM
(4500 mg/l Glucose, 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate,
Thermo Scientiﬁc) containing 10% FBS and 1% of streptomycin
(10,000 mg/ml)-penicillin (10,000 units/ml) in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 1C and 5% CO2. At 90% conﬂuency the microglia in
the cultures was removed by shaking constantly for 48 h.
Primary astrocytes isolated from GFAP/p38 knockout mice and
littermates were further conﬁrmed by Western blot of p38.
For p38 MAPK inhibition, cells were treated with SB239063
diluted in the media at a ﬁnal concentration of 10 mg/ml.

4.5.

In vitro hypoxia-reoxygenation model

Astrocytes were seeded in 6-well culture plates at a density of
2.5  105 cells/well in high glucose DMEM (4500 mg/l glucose,
4 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate) with 10% FBS and
1% of streptomycin (10,000 mg/ml)-penicillin (10,000 units/ml).
When the cells reached 80% conﬂuence, media was removed
and cells were washed twice with sterile PBS and replaced
with glucose, pyruvate and FBS free DMEM. The cell culture
plates were then placed in anaerobic chamber containing

55

0.5% O2 and 5% CO2 for 3 h. At the end of oxygen glucose
deprivation (OGD) the cells were replenished with FBS free
DMEM containing D-glucose (4500 mg/l) and pyruvate (1 mM)
and were placed in incubator for 24 h. For inhibitor studies
the cells were pre-treated with p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB239063
(10 mg/ml), 2 h before OGD.

4.6.

Wound healing assay

The astrocytes (2.5  105 cells/well) were cultured in high
glucose DMEM (10% FBS and 1% of streptomycin (10,000 mg/
ml)-penicillin (10,000 units/ml)) to a monoconﬂuent layer in
6-well cell culture plates. Using sterile 200 ml pipette tip
scratches were made on the cell layer, the plates were then
rinsed with sterile PBS to remove cell debris and replaced
with fresh cell culture media or SB239063 (10 mg/ml) containing media. At 0, 24 and 48 h after scratch, cells were stained
with Calcein AM (10 mM), ﬂuorescent images were obtained
randomly using a Zeiss ﬂuorescence microscope. For quantitative analysis, images from Calcein AM staining were used.
Using NIH Image J software the distance between the two
edges of the scratch was determined and these values were
used to quantify and plot wound healing.

4.7.

Migration assay

Migration assay was performed with BD matrigel™ invasion
chamber (24 well) according to manufacturer's instruction.
Brieﬂy, the transwell inserts were rehydrated in FBS free
DMEM for 2 h at 37 1C. After rehydration a suspension 1  105
cells/ml in FBS free DMEM was added to each insert and 5%
FBS as chemoattractant to bottom wells and were incubated
for 22 h. At the end incubation period the insert were
removed from the transwell and non migrating cells were
removed by gently swiping the interior of the transwell using
a cotton swab. The migrating cells were then ﬁxed with
methanol (100%) and stained with Toluidine Blue (1% in
Borax solution). The inserts were air-dried and images of
the migrated cells were taken using a Zeiss Microscope. For
quantitative analysis, the number of cells migrated in each
insert was counted from the images and then plotted using
Prism software. For p38MAPK inhibition study, SB239063 was
added to both cell suspension and chemoattractant media.

4.8.

Growth curve assay and cell cycle analysis

For growth curve assay, primary astrocytes were seeded into
12-well culture plates at 200,000 cells/well in 0.5 ml of DMEM
with pyruvate (10% FBS and 1% of streptomycin (10,000 mg/
ml)-penicillin (10,000 units/ml)). Drugs were added to each
well to obtain the desired concentration in a ﬁnal volume of
1 ml per well. Day of seeding was considered day 0. Plates
were incubated in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 1C and 5% CO2.
Cells were harvested on each indicated day using 0.25%
Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco) and counted using an inverted phase
contrast Zeiss microscope. For cell cycle analysis, Cells were
plated at a density of 200,000 cells/well and attached overnight. The following day, the cells were deprived of FBS
overnight to standardize the cell cycle followed by fresh
DMEM containing 10% FBS and the indicated concentration

56

brain research 1551 (2014) 45–58

of drug. At the indicated times, cells were harvested using
0.5% trypsin (Invitrogen) and washed with Wash Buffer (0.1%
FBS in PBS) twice. Cells were ﬁxed in ice cold 70% ethanol for
45 min at 4 1C. Ethanol was removed by washing twice with
PBS, the cells were then incubated with propidium iodide (PI)
(40 mg/ml) and RNAse (10 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 1C. Samples
were analyzed using Beckman Coulter FC500 Flow Cytometry
Analyzer.

1:1000) at 4 1C followed by secondary antibody (Goat, Jackson
Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Chemiluminescence signal was detected with Biospectrum500 UVP imaging system.
Protein band density of GFAP, p38, Pp38 and actin was then
determined and quantiﬁed using the densitometry analysis.
All the protein band density values were normalized to their
respective actin band density and were plotted using Prism,
statistical software.

4.9.

4.12.

Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry

For immunohistochemistry, the animals were anesthetized
with isoﬂurane, decapitated and transcardially perfused with
ice cold normal saline and 4% formalin. The brains were
removed and ﬁxed in 4% formalin and further processed to be
embedded in parafﬁn. Using a microtome 10 micron thick
sections were prepared. Sections were stained with primary
antibodies for GFAP (Santa Cruz, 1:100), p38 (Cell signaling,
1:100), Phoshporylated p38 (Cell signaling, 1:100) followed by
secondary poly horse radish peroxidase (HRP) and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining. For immunocytochemistry,
primary astrocytes were cultured on a glass cover slip in
DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% Streptomycin (10,000 mg/ml)Penicillin (10,000 units/ml). Astrocytes monolayer was ﬁxed
in 4% formalin for 10 min and permeabilized with 1% TritonX for 15 min at room temperature. After blocking with goat
serum (5%) for 30 min, primary antibodies for GFAP (Santa
Cruz, 1:100) or phoshphorylated p38 (Cell signaling, 1:100)
were applied and incubated overnight at 4 ˚C followed by
species speciﬁc secondary antibodies. Images were taken
using a Zeiss Microscope (Carl Zeiss).

4.10.

Gelatin zymography

Gelatinolytic activity of Matrix Metalloproteases (MMP 2 & 9)
in the media was determined by zymography. At the end of
reoxygenation, media from the cultures was collected and
samples were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin under non-reducing condition. After
electrophoresis, gels were washed in a wash buffer containing (2.5% Triton-x, 7.45 mM, CaCl2, 1 mM ZnCl2, 50 mM
Tris–HCl, pH 7.4) at 37 1C for 24 h. The gels were then stained
with Commassie blue (0.25% Commassie Blue, 45% methanol,
10% acetic acid) for 2 h and destained with a destaining
solution (10% acetic acid and 30% methanol) for 3 h. Using
Biospectrum 500 UVP imaging system densitometry analysis
was performed on the zymographs to quantify the gelatinolytic activity of the MMPs.

RNAs from wild type and conditional p38 knockout astrocytes
were extracted using Trizol LS Reagent according to manufacturer's instruction. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Promega) and 7300
real-time PCR system from Applied Biosystems. Two-step
real-time PCR protocol was used (95 1C for 15 s, 60 1C for 60 s
extension and detection, 40 cycles). Sequences of primers for
real-time PCR are listed as following:
TNFα: Forward 5'GCCTCTTCTCATTCCTGCTTGT 3'
Reverse 5' CAGGCTTGTCACTCGAATTTTG 3'
TGFβ: Forward 5' TTGCTTCAGCTCCACAGAGAAG 3'
Reverse 5' CCAGACAGAAGTTGGCATGGTA 3'

4.13.

Behavioral test

For walk initiation, the mice were placed in a circle of diameter
of 10 cm (approximately one animal length) on an open table
and the latency for the animal to walk out of the circle was
recorded. For negative geotaxis, the latency of the animals to
turn (901) and reverse (1801) when placed on an inclined (451) ﬂat
surface was measured. Latencies during walk initiation and
negative geotaxis were recorded immediately before surgery
and on days 1 and 4 after surgery. Ladder rung walking test was
used to assess and quantify motor dysfunction after MCAO as
previously described (Metz and Whishaw, 2002). Brieﬂy, the
animals were made to walk on an apparatus 122 cm long with
horizontal plastic rungs placed 7 mm apart. All the animals
underwent 3 testing trials prior to surgery and after surgery on
day 1 and day 4. During each trail all the foot faults and
stepping errors for both forelimb and hind limb were recorded
for each animal. At the end of the study means of 3 trials were
calculated and values were used to plot the foot fault using
Prism statistical soft ware.

Quantitative real-time PCR

Quantiﬁcation of infarct volume

Western blots analysis

Cell and brain protein samples were prepared in lysis buffer
containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. To ensure
equal loading, protein concentration was determined using
Pierce 660 nm Protein assay reagent (Thermo Scientiﬁc).
Proteins were then resolved on 10% gel and transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% milk, blots
were incubated overnight with primary antibodies against
GFAP (Santa Cruz, 1:500), p38 (Cell signaling, 1:500), phoshphorylated p38 (Cell signaling, 1:1000) or actin (Santa Cruz,

The brains were removed and ﬁxed in 4% formalin. 10 mm
thick parafﬁn embedded sections were prepared and stained
with 1% cresyl violet to deﬁne non-infarct tissue. Using the
NIH Image program the area of the non-ischemic (contralateral) hemisphere (A), non-infarct area of the ischemic
hemisphere (B), and total brain was measured in each section. Infarct volume was expressed as a percentage of the
area of the contralateral hemisphere ( ¼(A  B)/A  100) and
multiplied with distance between sections, as previously
described (Jin et al., 2010).

4.15.

Astrogliosis morphometric analysis

Serial microscopic images were taken in the border area of the
ischemic lesion for unbiased stereological analysis of astrogliosis induced by ischemic stroke. Six sampling frames (40 
objective ﬁeld) were randomly selected per section in layer II–
III of the cortex within 400 μm from the border of the infarction
(Barreto et al., 2011). For analysis and quantiﬁcation both cell
number and sizes of GFAP immunoreactive cells were measured
using the nucleator method. According to this method only
those cells with deﬁned nuclear outline were counted and those
cells without any deﬁned nuclear outline were not included
in cell counts (Herrmann et al., 2008). To eliminate bias in
quantitative analysis, all the images were assigned a code
consisting of a random alphabet and a numeric, and thus, the
individual doing cell counts is blinded for the region of the brain
(ischemic vs. non-ischemic hemisphere) and genotype of the
transgenic mice (wild type vs. GFAP/p38 knockout). At the end
of analysis the cell counts were matched to their respective
region and groups. For cell size analysis, Adobe Photoshop
CS6 image software was used to create a binary image with
600 pixel/in. resolution. Then using ROI manager tool of NIH
Image J software the area of each cell was determined at
constant threshold for all the images. All the cell sizes were
then pooled in each group and plotted as % of wild type cell area
using Prism statistical software.

4.16.

Statistical analysis

Graph Pad Prism 5 was used for statistical analysis. All the
results are expressed as mean7standard error of mean
(SEM). When comparing two groups a t-test was used to
identify any signiﬁcant differences. For comparison of multiple groups, two-way analysis of variance was used and posthoc Bonferroni analysis was done to identify the signiﬁcant
differences. po0.05 was considered as statistically signiﬁcant.
