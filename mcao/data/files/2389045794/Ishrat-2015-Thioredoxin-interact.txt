Abstract Redox imbalance in the brain significantly contributes to ischemic stroke pathogenesis, but antioxidant therapies
have failed in clinical trials. Activation of endogenous defense
mechanisms may provide better protection against strokeinduced oxidative injury. TXNIP (thioredoxin-interacting
protein) is an endogenous inhibitor of thioredoxin (TRX), a
key antioxidant system. We hypothesize that TXNIP inhibition attenuates redox imbalance and inflammation and provides protection against a clinically relevant model of embolic
stroke. Male TXNIP-knockout (TKO), wild-type (WT), and
WT mice treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of TXNIP,
resveratrol (RES; 5 mg/kg body weight), were subjected to
embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion (eMCAO). Behavior
outcomes were monitored using neurological deficits score

oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic markers was analyzed
by Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and slot blot at 24 h
post-eMCAO. Our result showed that ischemic injury increases TXNIP in WT mice and that RES inhibits TXNIP
expression and protects the brain against ischemic damage.
TKO and RES-treated mice exhibited a 39.26 and 41.11 %
decrease in infarct size and improved neurological score and
grip strength compared to WT mice after eMCAO.
Furthermore, the levels of TRX, nitrotyrosine, NOD-like receptor protein (NLRP3), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and activations of caspase-1, caspase-3,
and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) were significantly
(P<0.05) attenuated in TKO and RES-treated mice. The present study suggests that TXNIP is contributing to acute ischemic
stroke through redox imbalance and inflammasome activation
and inhibition of TXNIP may provide a new target for therapeutic interventions. This study also affirms the importance of
the antioxidant effect of RES on the TRX/TXNIP system.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term
disability in the USA [1]. Reperfusion therapy is currently
delivered to less than 5.0 % of the 0.8 million ischemic strokes
that occur annually in the USA. Free radical formation and
redox imbalance have been identified in the central nervous
system (CNS) and are thought to be an important response to
pathogens in the brain [2–4]. Current evidence suggests that
redox imbalance in the brain significantly contributes to ischemic injury [5, 6]. Nevertheless, large-scale clinical trials
with classic antioxidants (e.g., NXY-059) failed to demonstrate any benefit for stroke patients. In parallel, attempts to
treat patients with “neuroprotective” agents have been notoriously unsuccessful in clinical trials, possibly due to a failure to
recognize redundant and compensatory processes. Hence,
there is a great need to identify targets that are “upstream” of
the terminal effectors and primarily involved in mediating
“secondary damage” in order to devise new therapeutics that
could be administered in a practical treatment window.
Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is an endogenous
inhibitor of the thioredoxin (TRX) system, a major cellular
thiol-reducing and antioxidant system. TRX also exerts antiinflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects at the cellular level by
binding and inhibiting the pro-apoptotic protein apoptosis
signal-regulating kinase (ASK-1), which activates the proapoptotic signaling pathways [7–9]. We and others have demonstrated the pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic consequences as a result of the significant increases in TXNIP
expression in models of stress-related diseases including
stroke, neurotoxicity, and metabolic stress [10–15].
Preventive strategies using TRX overexpressing transgenic
mice or knocking down TXNIP expression via siRNA
showed neuroprotective effects against ischemic brain damage [12, 16]. Although promising, targeting early neuronal
damage, an irreversible step, is not practical in the clinic. On
the other hand, growing interest links redox signaling to sterile
inflammatory response that can further aggravate neuronal
damage after cerebral ischemia. Activation of the NOD-like
receptor protein (NLRP3) inflammasome, a well-established
multi-molecular protein complex and a pivotal mediator of
sterile inflammation, has been postulated in detecting cellular
damage and mediating inflammatory responses to aseptic
tissue injury during ischemic stroke [17–19]. Recently, a
significant body of literature has supported an essential role
for TXNIP in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome

767

[20–23]. Oxidative stress has been established to facilitate
TRX1-TXNIP dissociation and hence increased association
between TXNIP and the receptor of the inflammasome
NLRP3 [20]. The NLRP3 inflammasome is composed of
oligomers of the receptor (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated
speck-like (ASC) adapter protein, and the downstream effector enzym e (pro-caspase-1). Following NLRP3inflammasome activation, the pattern recognition receptor
NLRP3 responds by recruiting and assembling with the
ASC, which in turn recruits pro-caspase-1, causing its cleavage and activation into active cleaved caspase-1. Activated
cleaved caspase-1 then cleaves pro-IL-1β into the active
cleaved IL-1β form [24, 25], which exerts its well-founded
detrimental pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic response upon release into the extracellular environment [26–28].
Moreover, our group has demonstrated that TXNIP is required
for NLRP3 inflammasome activation and its deletion protects
against neurovascular degeneration in models of metabolic and
neurotoxic stress in the retina, a highly related neurovascular
tissue with shared similarities to the brain [10, 15]. However,
so far, little is known about the role of TXNIP-mediated
NLRP3 activation in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke.
Resveratrol (trans-3, 4′, 5-trihydroxystilbene, RES), a natural polyphenolic compound enriched in grape skin and red
wine, has attracted wide attention lately because of its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and inhibitory effect on
platelet aggregation [29–31]. Studies continue to demonstrate
the variety of mechanisms and pathways by which RES
provides protection in ischemic stroke [31, 32]. NivetAntoine et al. [33] recently showed that RES downregulates
TXNIP overexpression occurring during liver ischemiareperfusion. However, the effect of RES on the TRX/TXNIP
system and stroke outcomes in the embolic stroke model
remains to be determined.
Most cases of human stroke involve thromboembolic occlusion of cerebral arteries, especially middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) [34, 35]. In this study, we used an embolic
model to mimic the human clinical condition with spontaneous reperfusion [36, 37]. We hypothesized that TXNIP inhibition by both genetic (TXNIP-knockout) and pharmacological (with RES) approaches attenuates redox imbalance and
inflammation leading to protection in embolic stroke. Our
findings support the contribution of TXNIP in ischemic injury,
and TXNIP inhibition protected the brain against ischemic
injury.

Experimental Procedures
Animals
The experiments were performed according to procedures
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use

768

Committee (IACUC) of the Charlie Norwood VA Medical
Center. All experiments were performed using age-matched
(8–10 weeks) wild-type (WT) C57Bl/6 mice (Jackson
Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and TXNIP knockout
mice (TKO, generated from the genetic background of
C56BL/6 J) provided as a kind gift from Dr. AJ Lusis and
Dr. ST Hui at the BioSciences Center, San Diego State
University, San Diego, CA. TKO mice have a global knockdown of the expression of functional TXNIP as characterized
previously [38, 39]. TKO mice are similar in weight and
activity to WT or heterozygous littermates. No phenotypic
differences were observed among the TKO and WT mice.
All mice were maintained and housed in the vivarium under
controlled conditions (23±2 °C; 12-h light/dark periods) with
access to food and water ad libitum.
Anatomy of the MCA and Circle of Willis
Naive mice (n=3 in each type of mouse) were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with blue latex. Mice
were decapitated after 30 s, and brains were removed and
scanned for imaging.
Experimental Groups and Treatment Regimen
In order to determine the contribution of both genetic TXNIP
deletion (TKO) and the pharmacologic TXNIP inhibition with
RES on outcome/recovery after embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion (eMCAO) stroke, the total 64 mice (WT and
TKO) were separated into the following groups: WT
mice subjected to sham-operated control+vehicle treatment, group I (sham only); WT mice subjected to
eMCAO + vehicle treatment, group II (WT-eMCAO
only); WT mice subjected to eMCAO+RES (5 mg/kg)
treatment, group III (WT-eMCAO+RES only); and TKO
mice subjected to eMCAO group + vehicle treatment,
group IV (TKO-eMCAO only).

strength and uniformity of the fibrin-rich core of the clot and
stability of the occlusion, blood was supplemented with
human fibrinogen (2 mg/mL), retained in 25 cm of PE10 tubing overnight at room temperature, and subsequently stored at 4 °C. The clot was taken out into
sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and washed to
remove most of the red blood cells. The clots were left
in clean sterile PBS at room temperature for retraction.
Finally, the clots were again washed after the retraction
process and cut into 1.0± 0.3-cm-long fibrin-rich core
pieces. A single clot of 10 mm was transferred to a
modified PE-10 catheter filled with PBS.
Surgical Procedure Briefly, prior to eMCAO, isoflurane anesthesia was induced at 5 % and then maintained at
1.5–2 % during surgery. Temperature was monitored
and maintained (37±2 °C) during surgery by a homeothermic heating system (Fine Science Tools, Foster City,
CA). Focal ischemia (eMCAO) was induced by injection of the fibrin-rich portion of the blood clot in the
internal carotid artery as described by Zhang et al. [36]
and modified by Hoda et al. [42]. The polyethylene
(PE) tubing catheter containing the clot was inserted
gently from the external carotid artery (ECA) into the
distal part of internal carotid artery (ICA) (just proximal
to the origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA),
approximately 8 mm of catheter was inserted) after
removing the clip. A 10-mm-long clot was gently delivered with 25–50 μL of PBS. The catheter was left in
place for 5 min and withdrawn. The incision on the
ECA was closed with tight knots. Antegrade blood flow
was restored by loosening and removing the knot on the
common carotid artery (CCA). Successful occlusion was
confirmed by laser Doppler flowmetry and the presence
of a neurologic deficit.
Cerebral Perfusion Imaging Using the Laser Doppler Imaging
System

Drug Administration
Resveratrol was dissolved in a solution of 30 % ethanol/saline.
After induction of eMCAO, the animals received an initial
intravenous injection of RES (5 mg/kg) or vehicle followed by
intraperitoneal injection at 3 h post-eMCAO. The dose
(5 mg/kg body weight) of RES used in this study was determined from previous work demonstrating neuroprotection in
the suture model of stroke [40, 41].
Embolic Stroke in Mice
Preparation of the Clot The blood donor mice were anesthetized with 1.5 % isoflurane. Fresh arterial blood was withdrawn from the heart with a 1-ml syringe. To increase the

To ensure relative uniformity of the ischemic insult, cerebral perfusion was measured using the Periscan PIM 3
System (Stockholm, Sweden). A skin incision was performed, and the skull was exposed and cleaned. Whole
brain scan was performed using the PIM3 to measure
perfusion in both hemispheres at baseline, 10 min, and
24 h after eMCAO. A built-in photo detector assisted with
LDPI win software (Perimed Inc.) detected the reflected
light from moving blood cells within 0.5 cm depth of the
cortical surface. Color-coded images were acquired three
times continuously, and the average perfusion was calculated based on the concentration and mean velocity of the
blood cells using the LDPI win software. On induction of
ischemia, cerebral perfusion decreased to ~30 %.

animal with no apparent deficits obtained a 0; the presence of
forelimb flexion, 1; decreased resistance to push, 2; and circling, 3. A score of 3 was consistent with eMCAO; only

Grip Strength Forelimb grip strength in mice was determined
before ischemia and 24 h after surgery using a grip strength
meter (Columbus Instruments, OH, USA). We used an electronic digital force gauge that measured the peak force exerted
by the action of the animal while gripping the sensor bar.

While being drawn back along a straight line leading away
from the sensor, the animal released its grip at some point, and
the gauge then recorded the maximum force attained at the
time of release. The digital reading (in newtons) of three
successive trials was obtained for each mouse, averaged, and
used for data analysis.

Assessment of Infarct Size
At 24 h after the onset of eMCAO, anesthesia was performed
with ketamine 44 mg/kg and xylazine 13 mg/kg administered
intramuscularly. Animals were then perfused with saline and
killed, and their brains were removed. The brain tissue was
sliced into seven 2-mm-thick slices in the coronal plane and
stained with a 2 % solution of 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA)
for 15–20 min. Images of the stained sections were scanned

TXNIP Inhibition Increases TRX Expression and Reduces
Tyrosine Nitration After Embolic Stroke

Results
Cerebral Vasculature and Perfusion in WT and TKO Mice
To evaluate whether globally knocking out TXNIP caused a
phenotypic change in the cerebral vasculature, we
transcardially injected latex blue and imaged the cerebral blood
vessels (Fig. 1a). Both wild-type and TKO mice showed intact
and correct alignment of the circle of Willis, anterior cerebral
arteries (ACAs), MCAs, and posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs)
with no remarkable difference in the vasculature.
To demonstrate the reproducibility of the model, we measured perfusion before, 10 min, and 24 h after eMCAO in a
subset of both WT and TKO animals (n=3). When cerebral
perfusion in the ischemic hemisphere was expressed as a
percentage of the contralateral hemisphere (Fig. 1b, c), there
was a dramatic drop at 10 min after eMCAO in WT and TKO
mice. Deletion of TXNIP resulted in a better improvement in
cerebral perfusion at 24 h compared to WT.
TXNIP Inhibition Reduces Infarct Size and Improves
Neurological Outcome After Embolic Stroke
TXNIP expression was analyzed by Western blot at 24 h after
eMCAO (Fig. 2a). The expression of TXNIP was significantly
(P<0.05) increased in WT-eMCAO mice compared to shams,
suggesting the contribution of TXNIP-enhanced expression in
ischemic injury. Further, RES administration significantly
(P<0.05) inhibited the expression of TXNIP compared to
vehicle-treated WT-eMCAO mice. We next examined the effect of pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of TXNIP (TKO)
on infarct size at 24 h after eMCAO. As shown in Fig. 2b, WT
mice treated with RES and TKO mice showed a significantly
(P<0.05) smaller infarct size (21.85±2.51 and 22.92±3.12,
respectively) than that of the WT mice (45.02±3.25).
To examine whether the inhibition of TXNIP improves the
neurological outcome, we used neurological deficit scores and
grip strength meter at 24 h after eMCAO (Fig. 2c, d). The WT
animals exhibited prominent neurological deficits. REStreated WT and TKO mice showed significantly (P<0.05)
better neurological outcome after eMCAO compared to WT
mice. In addition, RES-treated WT and TKO mice improved
grip strength score (in newtons) compared to WT mice at 24 h
after eMCAO. These data indicate that mice subjected to

To study the effect of TXNIP inhibition on oxidative damage,
we examined TRX and NT after eMCAO (Fig. 3a, b). NT, a
product of free radical oxidation of nitric oxide damage, is
increased under a variety of disease conditions including
stroke [44]. TRX expression did change after eMCAO compared to shams, but RES-treated and TKO mice showed a
significantly (P<0.05) higher expression of TRX compared to
WT-eMCAO and shams. Further, expression of NT was also
inhibited in RES-treated and TKO mice after eMCAO.
TXNIP Inhibition Prevents Inflammasome Activation
(NLRP-3, IL-1β, and Caspase-1) After Embolic Stroke
To investigate the effect of TXNIP on inflammasome activation, we examined the expression of regulatory molecules in
the NLRP3 inflammasome activation pathway. The NLRP3
inflammasome can mediate neuronal death in ischemic stroke
via a number of mechanisms by increasing the production and
secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-18)
and through pleiotropic effects of cleaved caspase-1 in mediating apoptosis. At 24 h after eMCAO, WT-eMCAO mice
showed significantly (P<0.05) elevated levels of NLRP3
compared to shams (Fig. 4a). The increase in NLRP3 protein
expression was accompanied by an increase in cleavage of
caspase-1 and upregulation of IL-1β release (Fig. 4c, e). This
finding was further confirmed with increased immunopositive
signals of NLRP3 and caspase-1 in the peri-infarct area of
brain sections in the WT-eMCAO group (Fig. 4b, d). Both
pharmacologic and genetic inhibitions of TXNIP prevented
the activation of NLRP3, cleavage of caspase-1, and subsequent release of IL-1β after eMCAO.
TXNIP Inhibition Mitigates TNF-α Expression
After Embolic Stroke
We further elucidate the effect of TXNIP inhibition on
TNF-α, a pleiotropic cytokine that rapidly upregulates in the
brain after injury. Western blotting revealed that TNF-α was
expressed at very low levels in the sham group, highly
expressed after injury in the WT-eMCAO group (Fig. 5),
and reduced following eMCAO in the TKO and RES-treated
groups. Densitometry analysis showed that TNF-α was significantly (P < 0.05) expressed in WT-eMCAO mice

TXNIP Inhibition Attenuates PARP and Caspase-3 Activation
After Embolic Stroke
To examine the effect of TXNIP inhibition on neuronal death
pathways, we next examined the activation of PARP and
caspase-3 at 24 h after eMCAO (Fig. 6a, b). In the ischemic
condition, the activation of PARP induced by DNA damage is
also responsible for caspase-3 activation. The expression of
cleaved PARP and caspase-3 was significantly (P<0.05) increased in WT-eMCAO mice compared to shams. REStreated WT and TKO mice demonstrated reduced activation
of PARP and cleaved caspase-3 expression compared to
vehicle-treated WT-eMCAO.

Discussion
The present study demonstrates that pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of TXNIP attenuated brain infarction
and neurological outcome after embolic stroke. We also found
that these effects were associated with restoring redox balance
and inhibition of TXNIP-NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
Together, our results suggest for the first time that TXNIP is a
novel target for neuroprotection.

or nitrosative stress is the result of an imbalance in pro-oxidant/
antioxidant homeostasis, and both have been well documented
in the etiology of ischemic brain injury [44, 45]. Our results
showed that TKO and RES-treated WT mice increased TRX
expression and deceased tyrosine nitration. The beneficial effects of RES are corroborated with previous studies demonstrating that RES, as a potent antioxidant, protects the brain in
several experimental models of neurodegenerative diseases
including stroke [31, 46]. A recent study showed that RES

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 51:766–778

antagonized TXNIP upregulation after hepatic ischemic injury
[33]. Further, we found that ischemic injury increases TXNIP in
WT mice and that RES inhibits TXNIP expression and protects
the brain against ischemic damage. Studies have demonstrated
that TXNIP deletion in mice increases the antioxidant status
compared to WT [15, 38, 39]. In addition, transgenic overexpression of TRX is protective against ischemic brain damage
[16]. Moreover, we have shown that overexpression of TXNIP
mediates inflammation and neurotoxicity in N-methyl-Daspartate (NMDA)-induced retinal injury in rats [13]. In the
present study, TKO or pharmacologic (RES treatment) inhibition of TXNIP significantly reduced the infarct size and improved neurological outcome following eMCAO. These data
corroborate a previous finding that verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, inhibits TXNIP expression and attenuates ischemic
damage in a transient suture mice model of stroke [12].
The mechanism(s) of action by which TXNIP inhibition
provides neuroprotection after eMCAO are not completely elucidated. The TRX/TXNIP system has been identified in the
central nervous system and is thought to be an important response to pathogens in the brain [2–4]. The TRX/TXNIP system
is involved in multiple signaling pathways, which are involved
in a variety of cellular functions [10, 38, 47]. TXNIP acts as a
pro-apoptotic protein by interacting with ASK-1, leading to
activation of the p38 MAPK pathway and cell death [8, 13, 48].
Recent findings have provided insight into new inflammatory mechanisms that may contribute to neuronal death during
cerebral ischemia [19]. It is thought that the NOD-like receptor protein (NLRP3) inflammasome in neurons and glial cells
may play an important role in detecting cellular damage and
mediating inflammatory responses to aseptic tissue injury
during ischemic stroke [17, 18]. Formation of NLRP3
inflammasome can convert pro-caspase-1 into cleaved
caspase-1 [24, 25]. Following activation, cleaved caspase-1
will cleave pro-IL-1β into the biologically active proinflammatory cytokine, mature IL-1β, which is then released
into the extracellular environment [49], in addition to its wellestablished role in apoptosis [26, 27, 50].
The activators of the inflammasome can induce the dissociation of TXNIP from TRX in a reactive oxygen speciessensitive manner, allowing it to bind to NLRP3. NLRP3 then
oligomerizes with the ASC that recruits pro-caspase-1, allowing
its auto-cleavage and activation. Activated caspase-1 enzyme in
turn cleaves upregulated premature pro-inflammatory cytokines
(IL-1β) before their release [51, 52]. Our recent work demonstrated that TXNIP triggers NLRP3 expression, activation of
caspase-1, and release of IL-1β in a cellular model of NMDAinduced retinal neurotoxicity [15]. We also have shown that
TXNIP is required for high-fat-diet-mediated activation of the
NLRP3 inflammasome [10]. Moreover, enhanced TXNIP expression sustains neuro- and vascular degeneration through
inflammasome activation in primary Müller cells in response
to NMDA [15]. In the present study, we examined whether

TXNIP deletion/inhibition protects the brain against ischemic
injury in part through the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome.
The expression of NLRP3, cleaved IL-1β, and caspase-1 was
significantly increased in WT mice subjected to eMCAO.
Further, we found that the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome
proteins was significantly less in the TKO and RES-treated mice
than in the WT mice after eMCAO. These results lend further
support to a previous report showing that TXNIP is integral to
inflammasome assembly and release of IL-1β [53]. We and
others have demonstrated the role of enhanced TXNIP in induction of inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression
in models of diabetic retinopathy and retinal neurotoxicity
in vivo and in cells [10, 13, 54–57]. The contribution of
TXNIP to inflammatory cytokine production was first demonstrated at the transcription level. Forced expression of TXNIP in
isolated microvascular endothelial cells resulted in nuclear translocation and direct activation of the canonical NF B pathway
[54]. Moreover, studies have shown that TXNIP induces the

expression of other pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β
and TNF-α [13, 53, 54]. TNF-α is a key pro-inflammatory
cytokine which commonly manifests synergistic effects with
IL-1β to produce inflammatory processes [58]. However, more
elaborate work demonstrated that TNF-α can induce caspase-1
activation and IL-1β release in mouse macrophages [59].
TNF-α is known to promote cell survival and death in the
CNS [60] and is expressed in the ischemic brain [61]. Our results
show that TNF-α expression was increased in WT-eMCAO
mice and mitigated in TKO and RES-treated mice after
eMCAO. Taken together, our data suggest that, in addition to
reducing oxidant stress, TXNIP inhibition can also protect
against cerebral damage by alleviating inflammatory processes.
The limitations of this report are those associated with the
use of a single endpoint at 24 h. This investigation was designed as a proof of concept study, however, and longer-term
studies will be needed to assess the actual impact of the
manipulation of this promising target. One might expect the
impact to be even greater at later time points, where inflammation and apoptosis are even more important contributors to the
ultimate damage after stroke. We have, however, confirmed our
results in a clinically relevant model of embolic stroke. Further
studies are already planned to explore the mechanism by which
TXNIP inhibition/ablation protects the brain from ischemia and
tPA-initiated reperfusion injury in embolic stroke.
Thus, our data suggest that TXNIP inhibition protects the
brain from infarction and improves neurological outcome by
inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammasome activation
(Fig. 7). Our findings further suggest that TXNIP, an endogenous redox regulator, may represent an important future
target to develop newer therapeutics for stroke.
