Introduction

2.

Intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator
(rt-PA) is the most widely used thrombolytic agent for acute
ischemic stroke (Adams et al., 2007; Del Zoppo et al., 2009).
However, approximately 2.4–8.8% of patients who receive IV
rt-PA exhibit potentially life-threatening complications
including hemorrhagic transformation (Group T.N.I.o.N.D.a.
S.r.-P.S.S., 1995; Hacke et al., 1995; Hacke et al., 1998). Because
warfarin is a risk factor of such hemorrhagic complications,
warfarin-treated patients with a baseline international normalized ratio (INR) more than 1.7 are contraindicated for IV
rt-PA (Albers et al., 2000; Group T.N.I.o.N.D.a.S.r.-P.S.S., 1995).
Stachybotrys microspora triprenyl phenol-7 (SMTP-7) is a
new low molecular weight ﬁbrinolytic agent (Hu and Hasumi,
2000). This compound, which has a vitamin E-like structure,
promotes a conformational change in plasminogen, leading
to plasminogen activator-catalyzed conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, ﬁbrin binding to plasminogen, and ﬁbrinolysis (Hasumi et al., 2010; Hu and Hasumi, 2000). SMTP-7 has
more gradual and milder ﬁbrinolytic activity than rt-PA
(Shibata et al., 2010). We previously demonstrated that the
infarct volume (Akamatsu et al., 2011; Hashimoto et al., 2010;
Miyazaki et al., 2011; Shibata et al., 2010) and severity of
hemorrhagic transformation (Shibata et al., 2010) were lower
with SMTP-7 than with rt-PA in animal embolic stroke
models. Therefore, we hypothesized that SMTP-7 may
decrease hemorrhagic transformation following ischemiareperfusion even under the warfarin-treated condition.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the efﬁcacy
and safety of SMTP-7 under the warfarin-treated condition.
Three hours of ischemia-reperfusion was induced in mice
under the warfarin-treated condition. Mice were treated with
vehicle, rt-PA, or SMTP-7. Mortality, severity of hemorrhagic
transformation, neurological deﬁcits, infarct volume, severity
of edema, pre-matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) and MMP-9
levels, degradation of collagen IV, and blood brain barrier
(BBB) disruption 24 h after reperfusion were assessed.

Results

2.1.
No signiﬁcant difference in physiological parameters
among the groups
Physiological data are shown in Table 1. Under anesthesia
with 1.2–1.5% isoﬂuorane in 30% oxygen and 70% nitrous
oxide at 3770.5 1C, there was no signiﬁcant difference in
arterial pressure or blood gas among the three groups (n¼ 3,
per group).

2.2.
SMTP-7 decreased severity of hemorrhage after
MCAO under warfarin-treated condition
Hemorrhagic severity scoring was quantiﬁed in TTC-stained
slices from mice surviving 24 h after reperfusion. Massive
hemorrhage, such as that shown in Fig. 1B, was observed in
all mice that died after 3 h of MCAO. Warfarin-related
hemorrhagic transformation was consistently observed in
our model: all mice surviving 24 h after reperfusion also
developed hemorrhagic transformation after 3 h of MCAO
(Fig. 1C). The mean hemorrhagic severity score was 2.371.4
in vehicle-treated, 3.570.5 in rt-PA-treated, and 1.370.5 in
SMTP-7-treated mice. Hemorrhagic severity scoring was signiﬁcantly lower in SMTP-7-treated mice than in rt-PA-treated
mice (po0.05). The pattern of hemorrhagic transformation in
SMTP-7 treated mice showed a characteristic pattern. Only
heterogeneous hemorrhage, but not parenchymal hemorrhage was observed in SMTP-7-treated mice.

2.3.

SMTP-7 decreased mortality and neurological deﬁcits

Mortality and neurological deﬁcit scoring were evaluated 24 h
after reperfusion. Signiﬁcant differences were observed in
mortality among the groups (po0.01) (Fig. 2A). Twenty percent of vehicle- and 50% of rt-PA-treated mice died before the
end of the experiment. In contrast, all SMTP-7-treated mice
survived 24 h after reperfusion. Neurological deﬁcit scoring

Fig. 1 – Hemorrhagic severity scoring 24 h after reperfusion. (A) The severity of cerebral hemorrhage was divided to 5 types:
non-hemorrhage; score 0, hemorrhagic infarction Type 1 (HI-1); score 1, hemorrhagic infarction Type 2 (HI-2); score 2,
parenchymal hemorrhage Type 1 (PH-1); score 3, parenchymal hemorrhage Type 2 (PH-2); score 4. There was no nonhemorrhage (score 0) in this study. (B) Example of the dead mice brain. Massive parenchymal hematoma was observed in all
dead mice. (C) The severity of hemorrhagic transformation was higher in rt-PA-treated mice than in SMTP-7-treated mice. The
severity of hemorrhagic transformation was slightly higher in rt-PA-treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice. The severity of
hemorrhagic transformation was also slightly less in SMTP-7-treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice (npo0.05. n ¼6, per
group).

was signiﬁcantly lower in SMTP-7-treated mice (1.170.3) than
in vehicle- (3.071.8, po0.01) and rt-PA-treated (4.571.7,
po0.001) mice (Fig. 2B). The severity of neurological deﬁcits
was signiﬁcantly higher in rt-PA-treated mice than in vehicletreated mice (po0.05) (Fig. 2B).

2.4.
SMTP-7 slightly decreased the infarct volume
and edema index
The infarct volume and edema index were quantiﬁed in TTCstained slices from mice surviving 24 h after reperfusion. No
signiﬁcant differences were observed in the infarct volume or
edema index among the three groups (Fig. 3A and B). However, the infarct volume had a little tendency to be large in rtPA-treated mice compared to SMTP-7- and vehicle-treated
mice (Fig. 3A). SMTP-7 had a tendency to ameliorate the
formation of edema following reperfusion (Fig. 3B).

2.5.

SMTP-7 inhibited the activation of MMP-9

pro-MMP-9 and MMP-9 activity was evaluated by gelatin
zymography (Fig. 4A–C). As described above, only mice

surviving 24 h after reperfusion were included. The activity of
pro-MMP-9 was not signiﬁcantly different between vehicletreated (393.4763.1) and rt-PA-treated mice (512.3792.0)
(Fig. 4B). MMP-9 activity was signiﬁcantly lower in vehicletreated mice (10.471.0) than in rt-PA-treated mice (15.871.3)
(po0.05) (Fig. 4C). pro-MMP-9 and MMP-9 activity was signiﬁcantly lower in SMTP-7-treated mice (pro-MMP-9: 88.9734.2
and MMP-9: 5.071.6) than in vehicle- (pro-MMP-9, po0.01;
MMP-9, po0.05) and rt-PA-treated (pro-MMP-9, po0.01;
MMP-9, po0.001) mice (Fig. 4B and C).

2.6.

SMTP-7 ameliorated damage to the basal membrane

Collagen IV is the main component of the basal membrane.
The degradation of collagen IV was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Fig. 5A shows representative micrographs of
the boundary area of infarct in mice treated with vehicle,
rt-PA, and SMTP-7, respectively. Morphologically, the basal
membrane was damaged in both vehicle- and rt-PA-treated
mice; however, this damage was more severe in rt-PA-treated
mice (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the severity of damage to the basal
membrane was less in SMTP-7-treated mice than in vehicle- and

that the pixel intensity of collagen IV was signiﬁcantly lower
in rt-PA-treated mice (0.3470.004) and signiﬁcantly higher in

po0.05) and SMTP-7-treated (1.570.3, po0.01) mice (Fig. 6A

Discussion

In this study, we demonstrated that SMTP-7 decreased the
severity of hemorrhagic transformation after 3 h of MCAO
under warfarin-treated condition. SMTP-7 inhibited MMP-9
activation, damage to the basal membrane, and BBB disruption. SMTP-7 also decreased neurological deﬁcits, and
mortality rate.
Few experimental studies have investigated thrombolysis
in acute ischemic stroke with warfarin treatment
(Pfeilschifter et al., 2012, 2011a) because of the high mortality
rate of the models with warfarin treatment. We conﬁrmed
that conventional MCAO (Clark et al., 1997) with long
ischemic duration under warfarin treatment induced severe
infarction, edema and hemorrhage. Most mice died by 24 h

after reperfusion (data not shown). Because of the high
mortality rate, conventional MCAO was not suitable for our
study. Involvement of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA)
territory infarction was an important factor responsible for
the high mortality in intraluminal MCAO model (Akamatsu
et al., 2012). We modiﬁed a mouse MCAO model that did not
involve the PCA territory infarction (Akamatsu et al., 2012),
and developed a reproducible hemorrhagic infarction model
in warfarin-treated mice.
In the present study, we demonstrated that SMTP-7 was a
thrombolytic agent with lower mortality rate even under the
experimental warfarin-treated condition with severe INR
prolongation. The severity of hemorrhagic transformation
was signiﬁcantly higher in rt-PA-treated mice than SMTP-7treated mice. However, in contrast to previous studies
(Hashimoto et al., 2010; Miyazaki et al., 2011; Shibata et al.,
2010), no signiﬁcant difference was observed in hemorrhagic
severity between vehicle- and rt-PA-treated mice in our
study. This may be because of the timing to evaluate hemorrhagic severity. We evaluated hemorrhagic severity on mice
only surviving 24 h after reperfusion; mice exhibiting more
severe hemorrhage had already died and were excluded.
Therefore, neurological deﬁcit scoring that includes “death”

neurological deﬁcit scoring was signiﬁcantly higher in rt-PAtreated mice than in vehicle-treated mice.
IV rt-PA is an effective therapy in acute ischemic stroke,
but its efﬁcacy is limited by hemorrhagic complications.
Previous studies have indicated that the adverse effect of
thrombolysis by rt-PA is partially caused by the cytotoxicity
of rt-PA itself, as well as reperfusion injury (Hacke et al., 1999;
Wang et al., 1998). Wang et al. (2003) ﬁrst reported that rt-PA
activates MMP-9 in the brain endothelium, leading to

degradation of the basal membrane and BBB disruption.
Subsequent studies have suggested that the t-PA–MMP-9
pathway is responsible for BBB disruption and subsequent
hemorrhagic transformation (Lapchak et al., 2000; Pfefferkorn
and Rosenberg, 2003; Sumii, 2002). Thus, rt-PA is an important drug in acute ischemic stroke; however, it is a two-edged
blade. BBB disruption through the upregulation of MMP-9
followed by degradation of the basal membrane after cerebral
ischemia-reperfusion is responsible for the development of
hemorrhagic transformation (Fujimura et al., 1999; Gasche

et al., 2001; Pfefferkorn and Rosenberg, 2003; Sumii, 2002). The
basal membrane is mainly degraded in ischemic brains
(Tagaya et al., 1997; Yamashita et al., 2009).
In this study, gelatin zymography revealed that pro-MMP9 and MMP-9 activation was signiﬁcantly lower in SMTP-7treated mice than in rt-PA- and vehicle-treated mice. In other
words, SMTP-7 inhibited the upregulation of MMP-9 after
ischemia-reperfusion in warfarin-treated mice. Consistent
with results obtained by zymographic analysis, SMTP-7 suppressed the degradation of collagen IV, which is the main
constituent element of the basal membrane, suggesting that
SMTP-7 protected the BBB. Functional breakdown of BBB was
examined by EB dye leakage into the brain tissue. EB leakage
was signiﬁcantly higher in rt-PA-treated mice, resulting in
severe hemorrhagic transformation. In contrast, SMTP-7
protected BBB and ameliorated hemorrhagic transformation.
We consider the mechanisms why SMTP-7 inhibited hemorrhagic transformation after severe focal ischemia and reperfusion
under the warfarin-treated condition as follows. First, SMTP-7

never increases cytotoxic endogenous t-PA. SMTP-7 does not
affect the enzymatic activity of t-PA, but promotes t-PA-induced
plasminogen activation by approximately 100-fold (Hu et al.,
2012). Therefore, SMTP-7 does not activate the t-PA–MMP-9
pathway. Second, SMTP-7 has anti-inﬂammatory and antioxidative effects (Miyazaki et al., 2011; Shibata et al., 2010,
2011). Acute ischemia-reperfusion and subsequent chemokine responses lead to the recruitment of some inﬂammatory
cells into the ischemic brain tissue (Charo and Ransohoff,
2006). Inﬂammatory cells release proteolytic enzymes,
including MMP-2 and MMP-9, which cause BBB disruption
(Charo and Ransohoff, 2006). Furthermore, neutrophils produce oxidative stress in brain tissue (Kilic et al., 2005). We
previously reported that SMTP-7 directly neutralized IL-1β
induced VCAM-1 expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
generation, and leukocyte–endothelial interaction (Miyazaki
et al., 2011). Finally, SMTP-7 increased local ﬁbrinolysis only
and did not affect systemic ﬁbrynolytic activity because its
action is to alter the conformation of plasminogen, leading to

brain research 1578 (2014) 38–48

its proteolytic activation when the plasminogen activator is
available, especially in a thrombus or embolus (Hasumi et al.,
2010; Shibata et al., 2010).
Although SMTP-7 decreased hemorrhagic transformation
and improved neurological deﬁcits after MCAO under the
warfarin-treated condition, it did not signiﬁcantly reduce the
infarct volume and edema. It may be because long duration of
ischemia (3 h) upregulated endogenous tPA, and its neurotoxic effects prevented the signiﬁcant reduction of the infarct
volume and edema. Wang et al. (1998) reported that endogenous tPA more increased after 3 h of MCAO compared to
2 h. Injection of tPA after 2 h of MCAO increased the infarct
volume because of its neurotoxicity (Wang et al., 1998). In
contrast, administration of tPA after 3 h of MCAO did not
increase the infarct volume because of the ceiling effect of
endogenous tPA (Wang et al., 1998).

4.

Conclusion

SMTP-7 decreased hemorrhagic transformation and
improved neurological deﬁcits after MCAO under the
warfarin-treated condition with severe INR prolongation. In
contrast, IV rt-PA induced signiﬁcantly higher hemorrhagic
transformation and led to a poor outcome. Based on these
results, we believe that SMTP-7 can be a safe thrombolytic
agent for warfarin-treated patients who are contraindicated
for IV rt-PA.

Experimental procedure

5.1.

Mouse model of oral anticoagulation

Eight- to nine-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (Japan SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) were used in accordance with the National
Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (NIH Publications no. 80-23, revised 1996). All procedures
were approved by the animal care facility of Tohoku University
Graduate School of Medicine. Following a previously described
protocol, we administered warfarin orally through bottled drinking water (Foerch et al., 2008; Pfeilschifter et al., 2011a, b). Brieﬂy,
a 5 mg coumadin tablet (warfarin sodium, crystalline, 0556-017270, Bristol Myers Squibb, Munich, Germany) was dissolved in
375 ml tap water. This dose corresponds to warfarin uptake of
2.00 mg/kg per mouse for a 24-hour feeding period, assuming
water consumption is 15 ml/100 g per 24 h (Foerch et al., 2008;
Pfeilschifter et al., 2011a, b). In this study, we measured a mean
INR of 5.670.2 (n¼ 3) by CoaguChek (410350009, Roche, Basel,
Switzerland). Although, this INR was too longer to mimic clinical
situations, we adopted this warfarin dose to emphasize the
safety of SMTP-7 under warfarin anticoagulation. Details of this
mouse model of oral anticoagulation can be found elsewhere
(Foerch et al., 2008; Pfeilschifter et al., 2011a, b).

5.2.

Experimental groups and drug treatments

Mice were randomly assigned to three groups: vehicle(n¼ 20), SMTP-7- (n ¼15) and rt-PA-treated group (n¼ 30).
Vehicle, rt-PA, or SMTP-7 was administered to examine the

45

effect of different thrombolytic agents after MCAO under the
warfarin-treated condition. Normal saline was injected intravenously as a bolus at a dose of 10 ml/kg, 5 min before
reperfusion for vehicle treatment. rt-PA (Grtpa, 128-61398-8,
Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, Osaka, Japan) was dissolved in
water at 2 mg/ml concentration and administered intravenously at a dose of 10 mg/kg with 1 mg/kg as an initial bolus
5 min before reperfusion followed by continuous intravenous
infusion (Baby Bee syringe drive, MD-1001, Bee Hive controller, MD-1020, Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, USA) of
9 mg/kg over 20 min (Sumii, 2002). SMTP-7 (lot N01YH) provided by TMS (TMS Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was dissolved in
normal saline at a concentration of 2 mg/ml and administrated intravenously as a bolus at a dose of 10 mg/kg, 5 min
before reperfusion. Previously, we investigated optimal dose
of SMTP-7 for thrombolysis in a mice embolic stroke model
and found out that 10 mg/kg was the most effective (Shibata
et al., 2010). Vehicle- and SMTP-7-treated mice remained
canulated for 20 min after the bolus injection as a sham
procedure.

5.3.

Focal cerebral ischemia

To mimic the clinical situations, we designed the present
experiment whereby drugs were administrated 5 min before
reperfusion by pulling out an intraluminal suture from its
origin in the middle cerebral artery so that drug-associated
damage could be assessed under similar conditions of reperfusion (Yamashita et al., 2009). We previously reported a
mouse intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
model that did not involve the posterior cerebral artery (PCA)
territory (Akamatsu et al., 2012). With slight modiﬁcations to
this model, we developed a reproducible hemorrhagic infarction model under the warfarin-treated condition. Brieﬂy, we
used silicon-coated 6-0 nylon monoﬁlaments (602123PK5Re,
Doccol, Redlands, CA, USA); the diameter and length of the
silicon-coated tip were 0.2370.02 mm and 1.5–2.0 mm,
respectively. After a 24-h warfarin feeding period, mice were
anesthetized with 1.2–1.5% isoﬂuorane in 30% oxygen and
70% nitrous oxide and breathed spontaneously. Rectal temperature during all surgical procedures was maintained at
3770.5 1C using a feedback-regulated heating pad (BWT-100,
Bio Research Center, Nagoya, Japan). A mouse in a prone
position was ﬁxed in a head holder (SG-4N, Narishige, Tokyo,
Japan), and the scalp was shaved and cut with surgical
scissors to expose the thin skull over the bilateral cerebral
and cerebellar hemispheres. The surface of the skull was
covered with a slipcover over a thin layer of saline to prevent
drying. The baseline cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) values were
recorded through the intact skull for 1 min using laser
speckle ﬂowmetry (LSF) (OMEGAZONE, Omegawave, Tokyo,
Japan). During CBF measurement, the skull surface was
diffusely illuminated by 780 nm laser light. Scattered light
was ﬁltered and detected using a charge-coupled device
camera positioned above the head. The ﬁlter detected only
scattered light with perpendicular polarization to the incident
laser light. Raw speckle images were used to calculate the
speckle contrast, which corresponds to the number and
velocity of moving red blood cells and is directly related to
CBF. Signal processing was performed using the algorithm

46

brain research 1578 (2014) 38–48

developed by Forrester et al. (2002). This experimental settings allowed us to measure the relative CBF of the dorsal
surface of the cerebrum. Color-coded CBF images were
obtained in high-resolution mode (638  480 pixel; 1 image/s).
The mouse was then placed a supine position. The neck was
incised at the midline between the manubrium and the jaw, and
the left common carotid artery (CCA) was carefully separated
from the vagus nerve. The superior thyroid artery was cauterized
and cut. The external carotid artery (ECA) was ligated with a 7-0
nylon suture near its bifurcation into the lingual and maxillary
arteries and cauterized distally to the suture. The occipital artery
was cauterized and cut. The pterygopalatine artery was then
exposed and isolated. A collar suture at the origin of the ECA was
prepared using a 5-0 silk suture, the internal carotid artery (ICA)
was closed using a vascular clip (MH-1-20, BEAR Medic, Tokyo,
Japan), and the CCA was temporarily ligated with a 7-0 nylon
suture. The silicone-coated suture was introduced into the
arteriotomy hole in the ECA and was advanced into the CCA
bifurcation. After removing the vascular clip and cutting the ECA,
the suture was advanced distally into the ICA. Once the tip of the
inserted suture reached the ICA, the collar suture of the ECA was
tightened to avoid bleeding from the arteriotomy hole, and the
suture of the CCA was unfastened to restore blood ﬂow from
CCA. The intraluminal suture was inserted into the ICA
9.070.5 mm from the CCA bifurcation until mild resistance
was felt. The collar suture of the ECA stump was tightened
securely around the inserted ﬁlament. The wound was
closed with 6-0 nylon sutures, and the intraluminal suture
was hidden in the wound. The CBF value was recorded
using LSF for 1 min and conﬁrmed the decreasing CBF value
in the MCA territory without the PCA territory. The mouse
was then allowed to regain consciousness. The mouse was
reanesthetized 2 h and 40 min after induction of ischemia,
ﬁxed in the head holder in a prone position, and CBF value
was recorded. Mice in which CBF values were spontaneously restored were excluded from further experiments.
The mouse was then replaced in a supine position and the
cervical wound was reopened. Left jugular vein was
exposed and cannulated by PE-10 tubing (427400, Becton
Dickinson, New Jersey, USA) for the administration of each
drugs. The drugs administration procedure was described
above. Three hours after the induction of ischemia, the
intraluminal suture was withdrawn gently and slowly to
achieve the reperfusion and the ECA was ligated with the
collar suture. After drug administration, the wound was
closed and the mouse was positioned in a prone position.
The recovery of CBF value was conﬁrmed and the mouse
was awakened to allow for a 24-h survival period.

2, 3, 5-TriphenylTerazolium chloride (TTC) staining

Only mice surviving until 24 h after reperfusion were evaluated
(n¼ 6, per group). Mice were given an overdose of isoﬂurane 24 h
after reperfusion, and then transcardially perfused with cold
saline. Brains were removed immediately and cut into 5 serial
2-mm-thick coronal sections. These sections were incubated in
a 1% solution of 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)
(17779-10XX10MLML-FF, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Mo, USA) for
10 min at 37 1C. Images were captured using a digital camera
(GR DIGITAL III, 173240, Ricoh, Tokyo, Japan).

5.5.

Hemorrhagic severity scoring

The severity of cerebral hemorrhage was quantiﬁed in TTCstained sections as described previously: non-hemorrhage
(Score 0); hemorrhagic infarction Type 1 (HI-1), deﬁned as
heterogeneous small petechiae, generally along the boundary
of the infarct (Score 1); hemorrhagic infarction Type 2 (HI-2),
with more conﬂuent petechiae within the infarcted area
(Score 2); parenchymal hemorrhage Type 1 (PH-1), characterized by hematoma covering less than 30% of the infarct (Score
3); and parenchymal hemorrhage Type 2 (PH-2) with dense
hematoma in more than 30% of the infarct (Score 4)
(Aronowski et al., 2003; Berger et al., 2001; Kasahara et al.,
2012). Examples of each type are demonstrated in Fig. 1A.

5.6.

Neurological deﬁcit scoring

Neurological deﬁcits were assessed 24 h after reperfusion in
each group (vehicle, n ¼20; SMTP-7, n ¼15; rt-PA, n¼ 30) with a
6 points neurological deﬁcit scoring (0¼ no deﬁcit, 1¼ failure
to extend left forepaw, 2¼ circling to the left, 3 ¼falling to the
left, 4¼ “barrel rolling”, 5 ¼unable to move spontaneously,
6 ¼dead) (Pfeilschifter et al., 2011a, b). Mice surviving at 24 h
after reperfusion (vehicle, n¼16; SMTP-7, n¼15; rt-PA, n ¼15)
was assigned to further examinations.

5.7.

Infarct volume and edema index

Unstained areas were measured on TTC-stained sections by
Image J, version 1.46r (National Institutes of Health) as the
infarct volume. The edema index was calculated as (ipsilateral hemispheric volume contralateral hemispheric volume)/
contralateral hemispheric volume  100 (Garcia-Yebenes et al.,
2011).

5.8.

Gelatin zymography

Gelatin zymography was performed on samples from
ischemic hemispheres to evaluate the activity of MMP-9
24 h after reperfusion. Mice surviving until 24 h after reperfusion (n¼ 3, per group) were given an overdose of isoﬂurane
and transcardially perfused with cold saline. The ipsilateral
ischemic hemisphere was rapidly removed and homogenized
on ice in 1 ml of lysis buffer (N-PER Neuronal Protein Extraction Reagent, 87792, Thermo scientiﬁc, MA, USA) containing
protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete, Mini, EDTA-free in
EASYPack, 5892791, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (PhosSTOP Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail, 4906845, Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Homogenates were
centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min at 4 1C. To analyze the MMP9 activity, protein extraction of the tissue was performed as
previously described with little modiﬁcations (Fujimura et al.,
1999). The supernatants were recovered and incubated for
60 min with gelatin-sepharose 4B (17-0956-01, GE Healthcare,
Uppsala, Sweden), with constant shaking at 4 1C. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 500 g for 2 min. The
pellets were washed with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.05% BRIJ-35, 0.02% NaN3.
After a second centrifugation, the pellets were resuspended
in elution buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM

brain research 1578 (2014) 38–48

CaCl2, 0.05% BRIJ-35, 0.02% NaN3, 10% dimethylsulfoxide) for
30 min. The samples were subjected to gelatin zymography
with Gelatin Zymo-Electrophoresis Kit (AK47, Primary Cell,
Hokkaido, Japan) according to the manufacturer's directions.
Images were captured and analyzed by ChemiDoc MP ImageLab PC system (BioRad, CA, USA).

5.9.

Immunohistochemistry of collagen IV

Nine surviving mice were examined (n¼ 3, per group).
Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, mice were given an
overdose of isoﬂurane and transcardially perfused with cold
saline and followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. After ﬁxation,
the forebrain was embedded in O.C.T. compound (Tissue-Tek,
Sakura Finetek Japan, Tokyo, Japan) and frozen. Sections
were cut in the coronal plane at 10 mm using a cryostat
(Tissue-Tek Cryo3, Sakura Finetek Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Sections were incubated with anti-collagen IV (1: 400, ab6586,
Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Immunohistochemistry was performed with the avdin-biotin technique, and nuclei were
counterstained with hematoxylin. The basal membrane was
identiﬁed by its morphology, and staining intensity was
measured using Image J, version 1.46r (National Institutes of
Health).

5.10.

Evaluation of BBB permeability

BBB permeability was assessed by ﬂuorescent detection of
extravasated Evan's blue (EB) dye, as described previously (Li
et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2009). We assessed BBB permeability
in 10 mice (vehicle group, n¼ 4; SMTP-7 group, n ¼3; rt-PA
group, n¼ 3) based on slight modiﬁcations to this method.
Brieﬂy, under isoﬂurane anesthesia, 2% of EB dye in saline
was administered from left jugular vein at a dose of 3 ml/kg
3 h before euthanasia. Mice were given an overdose of
isoﬂurane 24 h after the reperfusion, and then transcardially
perfused with cold saline to remove intravascular EB dye.
Brains were removed immediately and dissected into left
(ischemic) and right (non-ischemic) hemispheres. Each hemisphere was homogenized in 1 ml of 50% trichloroacetic acid
solution. After centrifugation at 10,000g for 30 min, the supernatants were collected, and the concentration of EB dye was
determined with a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax 190
Absorbance Microplate reader, Molecular Devices, CA, USA)
at 620 nm for absorbance. EB dye extravasation was
expressed as the ratio of absorbance intensity in the ischemic
hemisphere to that in the non-ischemic hemisphere (EB
extravasation Index, EBI) (Chen et al., 2006).

5.11.

Statistical analysis

All values were given as the mean7SD. Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed with a one-way ANOVA and subsequent
Tukey's multiple comparison test for infarct volume, edema
index, gelatin zymography, pixel intensity of collagenIV and
EBI. For non-parametric neurological deﬁcit scoring and
hemorrhagic severity scoring, we used a Kruskal–Wallis test
and subsequent Dunn's multiple comparison test. And mortality was assessed with χ2 test. Values of po0.05 were
considered statistically signiﬁcant. Graph Pad Prism 5.03

47

(Graph Pad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used for all
statistical analysis.
