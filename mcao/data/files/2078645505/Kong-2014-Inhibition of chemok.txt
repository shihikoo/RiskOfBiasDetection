Chemokine-like factor 1 (CKLF1) is a novel C-C chemokine, and plays important roles in immune response
and brain development. In previous study, we have found that the expression of CKLF1 increased after
focal cerebral ischemia and inhibition of CKLF1 using antagonist C19 peptide protected against cerebral
ischemia. However, few studies have focused on the role of CKLF1 on neuronal apoptosis. The objective of
present study is to investigate the role of CKLF1 on neuronal apoptosis by applying anti-CKLF1 antibodies
in rat focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion model. Antibodies against CKLF1 was applied to the right
cerebral ventricle immediately after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and infarct
volume, neurological score, glucose metabolism and apoptosis-related protein were measured. Treatment with anti-CKLF1 antibody decreased infarct volume and neurological score, and inhibited neuronal
apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner at 24 h after reperfusion. Anti-CKLF1 antibody also reduced the
level of phosphorylation of Akt (P-Akt), and led to decrease of pro-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 associated X
protein (Bax) and increase of anti-apoptotic protein B cell lymphoma-2 protein (Bcl-2) and the ratio of
Bcl-2/Bax, and inhibited caspase-3 at last. In addition, positron emission tomography (PET) indicated that
anti-CKLF1 antibody increased glucose metabolism in ischemic hemisphere. These results suggest that
CKLF1 is associated with neuronal apoptosis after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Neutralization of
CKLF1 with antibodies shows neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia, which may be involved
in inhibition of Akt pathway, regulation of apoptosis-related protein expression, and improvement
glucose metabolism in ischemic hemisphere. Therefore, CKLF1 may be a novel target for the treatment
of stroke.

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and the principal
cause of disability in the world. However, there is currently no
effective treatment (Chacon et al., 2008). Ischemic stroke occurs
when the normal blood supply to the brain is disrupted, thereby
resulting in the activation of a series of functional impairment that
eventually leads to neuronal death (Dirnagl et al., 1999).
Apoptosis is an important pathophysiological phenomenon in
stroke. Cerebral ischemia triggers the pathological pathways of
the ischemic cascade and ultimately causes irreversible neuronal
injury in the ischemic core within minutes of the onset
(Broughton et al., 2009). The apoptotic mechanisms are involved
in excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and inﬂammatory reactions after

92

cerebral ischemia. Excitotoxicity and oxidative stress activate
microglia and astrocytes and release cytokines, chemokines. These
inﬂammatory mediators led to inﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells,
mainly neutrophils, to the ischemic region. Inﬁltrated neutrophils
themselves also secrete cytokines which cause a further activation
of glial cells. These processes all result in neuronal cell death and
aggravate the damage to the ischemic brain (Lakhan et al., 2009).
Cerebral ischemia and reperfusion causes an inﬂammatory
response due to oxidative damage, which triggers stress signaling
processes that eventually result in cell apoptosis and death. There
are a number of chemical mediators and pathways involved in this
process. The central mediators of cell activation and recruitment
are chemokines, which are small polypeptides that are produced
in elevated amounts at the ischemic injury site by the inﬁltration
of circulating immune cells and activation of resident cells, including microglia, astrocytes, neurons and endothelial cells (Jaerve and
Müller, 2012). Chemokines have been divided into four subfamilies
based on the number and spacing of their conserved cysteine residues in their sequences, and are classiﬁed as the CXC, CC, C, and
CX3C chemokines. Some studies have indicated that inhibition or
deﬁciency of chemokines was associated with reduced injury
(Huang et al., 2013; Sousa et al., 2013; Schuette-Nuetgen et al.,
2012). Therefore, the immunomodulatory role of chemokines is
now being translated into anti-inﬂammatory interventions to
reduce the destruction arising from the inﬁltration of inﬂammatory
cells and consequent secondary damage after injury (Lambertsen
et al., 2012).
CKLF1 is a novel human cytokine of the cysteine–cysteine
chemokine gene family, ﬁrstly discovered through isolation from
phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated U937 cells. CKLF1 displays
chemotatic activities in a wide spectrum of leukocytes. The expression of CKLF1 is upregulated in inﬂammation and autoimmune
diseases (Li et al., 2006). Recent studies suggest that CKLF1 plays
an important role in brain development (Wang et al., 2010, 2012).
In previous studies, we found that expression of CKLF1
increased after focal cerebral ischemia, and inhibition of CKLF1
protected against cerebral ischemia. (Kong et al., 2011, 2012).
However, the neuroprotective mechanism is not clear. Some studies indicated that neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion injury was associated with anti-apoptotic mechanism.
Prevention of apoptosis becomes a therapeutic strategy to preserve
brain tissues and promote functional recovery (Vogel et al., 2007).
Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the
effect of CKLF on neuronal apoptosis in cerebral ischemia by applying anti-CKLF1 antibody.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Anti-rat CKLF1 neutralizing antibody obtained from Peking
University Center for Human Disease Genomics. Antibodies against
Bcl-2, Bax, P-Akt and caspase-3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies
were from Pierce Biotechnology (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Rockford, IL, USA). All other chemicals and reagents were purchased
from Sigma–Aldrich Company, unless otherwise speciﬁed.
2.2. Animals and ischemia protocol
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (age, 7 weeks; weight, 260–280 g)
were supplied by Experimental Animal Center of Chinese Academy
of Medical Sciences (Beijing China). All of the procedures were in
accordance with the standards established in the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the Institute of

Laboratory Animal Resources of the National Research Council
(United States) and were approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of the Peking Union Medical College and the Chinese
Academy of Medical Sciences. The assessment of measuring infarct
volume and scoring neurobehavioral outcome is blinded. All efforts
were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number
of animals used.
MCAO was performed as reported previously (Kong et al., 2012).
Brieﬂy, under 10% chloral hydrate (4 ml/kg, intraperitoneal injection), a 4–0 nylon thread was inserted into the right common carotid artery and advanced until the origin of the right middle
cerebral artery was occluded. After 60 min of the occlusion, the
thread was removed to allow reperfusion and the animals were
returned to their cages.
2.3. Drug Administration
To evaluate the contribution of CKLF1 to cerebral ischemia, 5 ll
of polyclonal anti-rat CKLF1 neutralizing antibody (obtained from
Peking University Center for Human Disease Genomics) in saline
at dose of 0.1 lg, 0.5 lg or 1 lg that were produced in rabbits
immunized with CKLF1 or normal rabbit immunoglobulin G
(1 lg) was applied to the right cerebral ventricle immediately after
reperfusion, with the needle left in place for 5 min thereafter. 5 ll
of saline was injected in the vehicle group. The coordinates of the
injection site were as follows: 0.8 mm posterior to the bregma,
1.5 mm lateral to the midline, and 3.5 mm depth from the dural
surface, according to the atlas.
2.4. Neurological function
Neurological score was taken by Longa’s 5-point scale at 24 h
after reperfusion respectively (Longa et al., 1989). A score of 0:
no neurological deﬁcit; a score of 1: failure to extend left forepaw
fully; a score of 2: circling to the left; a score of 3: falling to the left;
and a score of 4: did not walk spontaneously and had a depressed
level of consciousness. The animals without symptoms of neurological impairment or dying after the surgery were rejected and
other rats were recruited.
2.5. Infarct volume analysis
At 24 h after reperfusion, the animals were anesthetized, and
brains were removed and cut into 2-mm-thick slices, for a total
of six slices per animal. The slices were immersed in a 1% solution
of 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 30 min and ﬁxed in 4% phosphate buffered
formalin. Images of the slices were obtained with a scanner and a
computer. The infarct areas and the hemisphere areas of each slice
were determined by Image J. The infarct areas on each slice were
summed and multiplied by slice thickness to give the infarct
volume. To compensate for edema and atrophy, the corrected
volume was calculated using the following equation: percentage
hemisphere lesion volume = ((total infarct volume (right hemisphere volume left hemisphere volume))/left hemisphere
volume)  100%.
2.6. Nissl staining
After 24 h of perfusion, 5 rats in each group were anesthetized
with 10% chloral hydrate and perfused from heart with 200 ml of
normal saline and 200 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Brains
were dehydrated and embedded in parafﬁn, then sectioned at a
thickness of 5 lm. Four parafﬁn sections from each rat were
dewaxed, rehydrated and stained with 0.5% (m/v) Toluidine Blue
for 15 min. The sections from Nissl staining were examined under

L.L. Kong et al. / Neurochemistry International 76 (2014) 91–98

a light microscope (200). Survived cells showed well-stained
Nissl bodies, whereas damaged cells were either swollen with loss
of stainable Nissl material or necrotic with deeply staining dendrites fragmented. The number of cells in four non-overlapping
visual ﬁelds was counted with Image J.

group was 2.7 ± 0.4, treatment with anti-CKLF1 antibody at dose of
0.5 lg and 1 lg was signiﬁcant lower than that of IgG group animals (2.1 ± 0.4 and 1.9 ± 0.6) (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). In addition,
injection of normal rabbit IgG (1 lg) failed to reduce the infarct
volume and neurological score.

2.7. MicroPET imaging and data analysis

3.2. Effect of anti-CKLF1 antibody on morphology of neurons

18
F-Fﬂuorodeoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) microPET imaging was
performed 24 h after cerebral MCAO on a microPET R4 scanner
(Concorde Microsystems, Knoxville, TN). Under brief (1.5 min)
halothane gas anaesthesia, the rats were intravenously injected
with 18.5 MBq of 18F-FDG via the tail vein and put it back in a quiet
room for 30 min for glucose uptake. Subsequently, the animals
were placed in the microPET scanner under halothane gas anaesthesia (5% induction and 1.5% for maintenance). Ten-minute static
acquisition was performed in 3D mode. MicroPET image studies
were reconstructed using a statistical maximum a posteriori probability algorithm.
The imaging data acquired from microPET were displayed and
analysed by IDL (ver. 6.2, Research Systems, Colorado, USA) and
ASIPro VM (6.0.5.0, Concorde Microsystems, Knoxville, TN) software programs. The PET and MR images were coregistered using
ASIPro VM software. Axial MR images (n = 17) were used to assign
regions of interest (ROIs) per slice according to an atlas of rat brain
anatomy. Glucose metabolism was evaluated by drawing ROIs in
the cortex for each slice. A semiquantitative method (standardized
uptake value, SUV) was used to calculate the changes in metabolic
rate as the percentage of injected dose per gram (% ID/g) of tissue
using the ASIPro 6.0.5.0 software.

The results of Nissl staining visually showed the morphological
changes of neurons in the ischemic region. The photographs of Nissl staining demonstrated that the morphology of neurons were
round or oval in shape, the nucleus was located in the center of cell,
and the cell junctions were tight in the sham-operated group
(Fig. 2A). In vehicle group, the numbers of cells were reduced,
the nucleus shrank, the cell junctions became loose, and the intercellular spaces were enlarged (Fig. 2B). Treatment with anti-CKLF1
antibody could alleviate the symptoms of apoptosis (Fig. 2E, F). In
addition, the number of neurons signiﬁcantly decreased in vehicle
group and more Nissl-stained neurons were observed in antiCKLF1 antibody group (0.5 and 1 lg) (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01)
(Fig. 2G).

2.8. Western blotting
Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes (Millipore, USA). The membranes were blocked by 3%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then incubated with primary
antibodies, the followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody and detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence plus detection system (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford,
IL, USA). The density of each band was quantiﬁed by using image
analysis software (Science Lab 2005 Image Guage; Tokyo, Japan).
2.9. Statistic analysis
Results were expressed as mean ± SEM. The differences among
groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Bonferroni multiple comparisons test was used for post hoc analysis. Statistical signiﬁcance was accepted at P < 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Anti-CKLF1 antibody reduced neurological score and infarct
volume
To investigate the neuroprotective effect of anti-CKLF1 antibody
against cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury, neurological score
and infarct volume were measured at 24 h after reperfusion. As
shown in Fig. 1A, the infarct tissue was stained pale and non-ischemic area red. Injection of anti-CKLF1 antibody signiﬁcantly reduced
infarct volume in Fig. 1B. Anti-CKLF1 antibody at dose of 0.5 lg and
1 lg signiﬁcantly reduced the infarct volume compared with IgG
group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). Meanwhile, treatment with antiCKLF1 antibody signiﬁcantly reduced neurological score in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). The neurological score of vehicle

3.3. Effect of anti-CKLF1 antibody on brain glucose metabolism
As shown in Fig. 3, there was no metabolic asymmetry between
the right and left hemispheres in normal rats, but the metabolic
activity was decreased in the ischemic (right) hemisphere. AntiCKLF1 antibody improved glucose utilization in right hemisphere.
Meanwhile, the glucose metabolism in the right and left hemispheres was measured (Fig. 4). The SUV in the cortex of ischemic
hemisphere of the vehicle group was signiﬁcantly reduced
compared with that of the sham operation group after cerebral
ischemia (P < 0.01). Pretreatment with anti-CKLF1 antibody significantly increased cortical glucose metabolism in the ischemic
hemisphere by 34.3% (P < 0.05). In addition, the glucose metabolism in the contralateral cortex was not signiﬁcantly different
among the three groups.
3.4. Effect of anti-CKLF1 antibody on expression of apoptosis-related
signal pathway
Akt is an important apoptosis-related signal protein, and cerebral ischemia inhibited Akt phosphorylation and led to apoptosis.
In the present study, to examine whether inhibition of CKLF1 can
activate Akt signaling following reperfusion, we measured the levels of p-Akt. The levels of p-Akt in ischemic cortex were signiﬁcantly lower in the vehicle group compared with the sham
group. Anti-CKLF1 antibody at a dose of 0.5 lg or 1 lg increased
the levels of p-Akt signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05, Fig. 5A). In addition, the
activation of caspase-3 was required for the execution of apoptosis,
and thus was determined in our study. As shown in Fig. 5B, cerebral ischemia induced the activation of caspase-3 signiﬁcantly
compared with sham group. Anti-CKLF1 antibody at either 0.5 lg
or 1 lg dose inhibited the activation of caspase-3 dramatically
compared with the IgG group (P < 0.05).
3.5. Effect of anti-CKLF1 antibody on expression of apoptosis-related
protein
To investigate the mechanism of anti-apoptotic effect of antiCKLF1 antibody, we evaluated the expression of the vital target
genes of Akt pathway Bcl-2 and Bax using western blotting.
Fig. 6 showed that the Bcl-2 protein level was signiﬁcantly
decreased and the Bax protein level was increased in vehicle group
compared with the sham group. Anti-CKLF1 antibody signiﬁcantly

increased the levels of Bcl-2 and decreased the levels of Bax in a
dose-dependent manner, and thus increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio.
4. Discussion
In present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of
anti-CKLF1 antibody after transient cerebral ischemia in rats.
Anti-CKLF1 antibody therapy reduced infarct volume and improved
the neurological outcome, putatively via anti-apoptotic effect and
promoting glucose utilization in the ischemic hemisphere.
Cerebral ischemia involves in a series complex of pathophysiological mechanisms, including excitotoxicity, oxygen free radical
injury and inﬂammatory reaction (Nakka et al., 2008). These pathophysiological mechanisms are closely related to apoptosis. The
purpose of apoptosis is to regulate organism development and
keep homeostatic state (Millán and Arenillas, 2006; Zhang et al.,
2004). Growing evidence reveals that apoptosis is one of the major
mechanisms that lead to the cell death and tissue injury after cerebral ischemia (Broughton et al., 2009). So targeting and preventing
apoptosis in the ischemic region would seem to be a rational therapeutic goal for treatment of stroke (Nakka et al., 2008).

There are two general pathways for activation of apoptosis after
cerebral ischemia: the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways (Niizuma
et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2004). The intrinsic pathway is originated
from mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. Release of cytochrome
c promotes the formation of apoptosome and activates caspase-9
and subsequently caspase-3 (Sugawara et al., 2004), eventually
leads to DNA fragmentation and triggers apoptosis (Wang, 2001).
In present study, the result of Nissl staining indicated that cells
were reduced, the nucleus shrank, the cell junctions became loose,
and the intercellular spaces were enlarged. These changes demonstrated apoptosis. Pretreatment with anti-CKLF1 antibody inhibited apoptosis.
The most upstream consequence of cerebral ischemia fundamentally is composed of an energetic problem. Severe insults of
cerebral ischemia render mitochondria dysfunctional for ATP production. A sudden decrease in ATP levels can induce cell death.
(Xing et al., 2012). The energy of brain mainly comes from glucose.
When the supply of glucose is interrupted by cerebral ischemia,
the nerve cells will be swollen, dysfunction and apoptosis. Therefore, the level of glucose utilization correlates with the degree of
neuronal activity (Gao et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2012). It has been

Fig. 3. Effects of anti-CKLF1 antibody treatment on metabolic glucose activity as shown in microPET images. There was no metabolic asymmetry between the right and left
hemispheres in normal rats. Metabolic activity was decreased in the right hemisphere after MCAO, but anti-CKLF1 antibody blocked this decrease. Images were shown in
coronal view and right hemisphere was subjected to ischemia. Fusion is overlap of PET and MRI.

(left, L) hemispheres after transient MCAO. Anti-CKLF1 antibody (0.1, 0.5 or 1 lg)
was injected into the right cerebral ventricle immediately after reperfusion. Glucose
metabolism was evaluated by drawing regions of interest (ROIs) in the cortex for
each slice. Standardized uptake value (SUV) was used to calculate the changes in
metabolic rate as the percentage of injected dose per gram (% ID/g) of tissue using
the ASIPro 6.0.5.0 software. Each data point shows the mean ± SEM for 5 rats.

widely and consistently reported that glucose metabolism is
greatly suppressed in the ischemic core because of severe ﬂow
reduction in animals and patients with stroke (Yuan et al., 2013).
PET is a noninvasive imaging technique that allows quantitative
determinations of the rates of various physiological and biochemical processes. 18F-FDG is a well-known radiotracer that has
frequently been used as a marker of metabolic activity of glucose
(Gao et al., 2010). Therefore, 18F-FDG PET is useful in detecting
various cerebrovascular diseases because of their consumption of
large amounts of glucose as an energy source (Cherry and
Gambhir, 2001; Li et al., 2013). In PET images, MCAO induced clear
metabolic asymmetry between the right and left hemispheres, this
indicated neuronal activity were inﬂuenced by ischemia. However,
anti-CKLF1 antibody signiﬁcantly increased cortical glucose
metabolism in the ischemic hemisphere, which may be associated
with anti-apoptotic effect. Therefore, inhibition of CKLF1 may help
preserve glucose utilization and promote motor recovery in the
ischemic hemisphere.
Apoptosis is also known as programmed cell death, which is
an initiative suicide process after the cells receive a signal or

stimulation with some other related gene. Akt plays a critical role
in the suppression of apoptosis (Mullonkal and Toledo-Pereyra,
2007). Akt is negatively regulated by phosphatase (Zhang et al.,
2004). Akt achieves its active form through being phosphorylated
largely by phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) (Chan et al., 2011;
Xue et al., 2014). After phosphorylation, activated Akt inactivates
other apoptogenic factors, such as Bad or caspase-9, thereby inhibiting cell death (Noshita et al., 2001). Some studies have found that
the expression of phosphorylated Akt is upregulated for a short
duration within the ﬁrst 12 h following MCAO and then decreased
(Li et al., 2003; Friguls et al., 2001). Many studies have reported
that anti-apoptotic effect in cerebral ischemia is mainly through
Akt pathway (Chen et al., 2013, 2014; Cheng et al., 2012; Sun
et al., 2011). These ﬁndings strongly support the pro-survival role
of p-Akt following cerebral ischemia. In this study, the level of
p-Akt decreased after 24 h reperfusion, and increased after pretreatment with anti-CKLF1 antibody.
The biochemical alterations that occur during the early stages of
apoptosis may induce mitochondrial dysfunction either directly or
indirectly. Akt is activated after phosphorylation, thereby preventing apoptosis via phosphorylating the downstream factors
(Mullonkal and Toledo-Pereyra, 2007). Bcl-2 antagonist of cell
death (Bad) is one of the downstream factors of the Akt pathway,
and a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that can displace
Bax from binding to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, resulting in cell death
(Noshita et al., 2001). The Bcl-2 family proteins are key regulators
of apoptosis, which include both anti-apoptotic members such as
Bcl-2 and the pro-apoptotic members such as Bax, and a slight
change in the dynamic balance of these proteins may result either
in inhibition or promotion of cell death (Ola et al., 2011; Pellegrini
and Strasser, 1999; Zhao et al., 2006). The protein Bcl-2 is localized
to the mitochondrial membrane and helps maintain membrane
integrity, while Bax is a cytoplasmic protein that migrates to the
mitochondria to promote permeabilization of the mitochondrial
membrane. Therefore, the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax in mitochondria is
a pivotal factor determining membrane integrity and apoptosis
burden (Murphy et al., 1999). Recent studies of cerebral ischemia
in rats reveal that dysregulation of the Bcl-2 family of proteins

can exacerbate ischemic neuronal injury. Inhibition or deﬁciency
of Bcl-2 family has been associated with reduced neurons to death
induced by excitotoxic, metabolic and oxidative insults relevant to
Alzheimer’s disease, stroke and other disorders (Mattson, 2000;
Martinou et al., 1994; White et al., 1998). In addition, it is well
known that caspases are a family of intracellular proteins involved
in the initiation and execution of cell apoptosis. Caspase-3 is a
potent, terminal caspase that executes apoptosis via the mitochondria-dependent pathway (Ghavami et al., 2009; Bozlu et al., 2007;
Jia et al., 2014). In present study, the decrease of the expression of
Bax and caspase-3 and concurrent increase in the expression of
Bcl-2 of pretreatment with anti-CKLF1 antibody strongly supported the notion that antibody played attenuating effect on ischemia-induced neuron injury, at least in part, through interfering
apoptosis pathway.
On the other hand, we have indicated in previous studies that
anti-CKLF1 antibody decreased production of inﬂammatory
mediators and expression of adhesion molecules, thereby reduced
neutrophils recruitment to the ischemic area (Kong et al., 2014).
Because of inﬁltrated neutrophils also resulted in cell apoptosis,
so it is difﬁcult to clear direct or indirect anti-apoptotic effect pretreatment with anti-CKLF1 antibody.
To conﬁrm the role of CKLF1 in neuronal apoptosis, it is necessary to investigate the direct effects of CKLF1 on apoptotic proteins.
However, there is no commercial CKLF1 available at this stage. It is
very difﬁcult to assess the direct role of CKLF1 in stroke without
this chemokine. As an alternative, we used anti-CKLF1 antibody
to investigate the role of CKLF1 in stroke by neutralization of CKLF1
in the present study. Our previous and present results indicated
the speciﬁcity of anti-CKLF1 antibody by comparing the effect of
anti-CKLF1 antibody with the antagonist C19 peptide in stroke.
The efﬁciency of antibody was equivalent to antagonist. In addition, we are also trying to ﬁnd other way to prove the direct role
of CKLF1. For example, constructing CKLF1-expressing plasmid
may be a solution. Tan et al. reported that injection of CKLF1
plasmid into muscle followed by electroporation caused overexpression of CKLF1 and dramatic pathological changes in the
lungs of treated mice (Tan et al., 2004). As a follow-up study, we

L.L. Kong et al. / Neurochemistry International 76 (2014) 91–98

will try to build up CKLF1-expressing plasmid and investigate its
effect in brain.
5. Conclusions
These results suggest that CKLF1 is associated with neuronal
apoptosis after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Neutralization
of CKLF1 with antibody shows neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia, which may be involved in inhibition of Akt pathway,
regulation of apoptosis-related protein expression, and improvement glucose metabolism in ischemic hemisphere. Therefore,
CKLF1 may be a novel target for the treatment of stroke.
