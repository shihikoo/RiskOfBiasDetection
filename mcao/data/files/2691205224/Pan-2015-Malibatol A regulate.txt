Abstract
Background: Activation of microglia plays a crucial role in immune and inflammatory processes after ischemic
stroke. Microglia is reported with two opposing activated phenotypes, namely, classic phenotype (M1) and the
alternative phenotype (M2). Inhibiting M1 while stimulating M2 has been suggested as a potential therapeutic
approach in the treatment of stroke.
Findings: In this study, we indicated that a novel natural anti-oxidant extracted from the Chinese plant Hopea
hainanensis, malibatol A (MA), decreased the infarct size and alleviated the brain injury after mice middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO). MA inhibited expression inflammatory cytokines in not only MCAO mice but also
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglia. Moreover, treatment of MA decreased M1 markers (CD16, CD32,
and CD86) and increased M2 markers (CD206, YM-1) while promoting the activation of nuclear receptor PPARγ.
Conclusions: MA has anti-inflammatory effects in MCAO mice in a PPARγ-dependent manner, making it a potential
candidate for stroke treatment.

Introduction
Stroke is considered one of the leading causes of death
and disability worldwide. However, to date, therapeutic
options for acute ischemic stroke remain limited.
Thrombolytic recombinant tissue plasminogen activator
(rtPA) is the only FDA-approved drug for acute ischemic
stroke that can effectively reduce the infarct size and improve functional recovery if the drug is provided within
the therapeutic window of time after onset of stroke.
Administration of this drug is still hard to control in a
clinical setting due to the limited time window and
increased incidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Consequently, a safe and effective treatment for ischemic
stroke, especially at an early stage, remains challenging.

Acute inflammation plays an important role after
cerebral ischemia. Brain injury provokes activation of
resident microglia within minutes after ischemia,
followed by infiltration of immunocytes, including neutrophils, T cells, and macrophages [1]. A plethora of
pro-inflammatory mediators are triggered including
TNF-α, iNOS, IL-1, and IL-6, exacerbating brain damage. The implication is that inhibiting microglia activation may represent a novel therapeutic target in acute
cerebral ischemia.
In a normal brain, microglia are resident immune cells
of the central nervous system which act as a sensor. Although microglia may protect the brain in some cases,
the uncontrollable inflammatory responses largely overestimate its beneficial effects. It is well known that
microglia, similar to periphery macrophages, could respond to micro-environmental disturbance by drastically
altering phenotypes and functions. Two well-established
phenotypes are the classical activation phenotype (M1)
and the alternative activation phenotype (M2) [2].

Briefly, M1 microglia is a proinflammatory cellular
state associated with an overexpression of inflammatory
cytokines, including IL-1, TNF-α, and iNOS; whereas
M2 polarized microglia state releases beneficial mediators, including IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β, leading to
homeostasis, regeneration, and neuroprotection [3].
These dual and opposing activation phenotypes, which
determine the regulation of inflammatory responses after
brain injury, have been found in various central nervous
system diseases and injuries, including Alzheimer’s [4],
multiple sclerosis [5], and traumatic brain injury [6].
Recently, they were also found to play an important
role in ischemic stroke [7]. However, there is still no
consensus about how microglia change phenotypes
after brain injury.
The peroxisome proliterator-activated receptors
(PPARs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. PPARγ function relies on binding with the retinoid X
receptor (RXR) to form a heterodimer complex. The
complex then binds to specific DNA response elements,
namely, PPAR response element (PPRE) and regulates
target gene transcription [8]. PPARγ was first demonstrated as having the function of regulating adipocyte
differentiation, metabolism, and glucose homeostasis [9];
for this reason, PPARγ agonist is identified as a candidate in diabetes mellitus treatment, such as troglitazone,
rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone. Also, activation of
PPARγ signaling has a protective role by reducing stress
and inflammation in central nervous system.
Malibatol A (MA), with a molecular formula of
C28H20O7, is a natural resveratrol oligomer extracted
from the leaves of the Chinese plant Hopea hainanensis.
It exhibits strong antioxidant effects by scavenging radicals including 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrozyl (DPPH) and
O2− [10]. Inoue et al. reported increased PPARγ expression triggered by resveratrol in mouse primary cortical
cells [11]; for this reason, studies identified resveratrol as
a cyclooxygenase (COX) suppressor and PPAR family activator [12]. Resveratrol has anti-inflammatory effects in
the brain caused by ischemic injury [13]. According to
this evidence, it is reasonable to suspect that MA, a resveratrol oligomer, has the potential to activate PPARγ in
the ischemic brain. In this study, the present study aims
at exploring the therapeutic effects of MA by observing
the inflammatory cytokines and M1/M2 polarization
markers in the cortex of the mouse experimental stroke
model and also unravel the potential mechanism with
PPARγ activation and the underlying mechanism.

Materials and methods
Middle cerebral artery occlusion model in mice

All animal experiments were approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee at Nanjing University, in
Nanjing, China. Kunming mice (4 to 6 weeks,25 to

Page 2 of 11

30 g, male) were provided by the Experimental Animal
Center of the Drum Tower Hospital. Sixty-minute
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
was induced by intraluminal filament technique as previously described [14]. Body temperature was maintained at 37°C ± 0.5°C with a heating lamp throughout
the surgery and occlusion period. Mice were included
if laser Doppler reading is below 30% of baseline and
no hemorrhage were found when taking out the brain.
Sham-operated mice were treated in the same way as
MCAO mice, except without MCAO filament inducement.

Treatment with MA and T0070907

MA is extracted and provided by the State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Nanjing University, People’s Republic of China [10]. MA was dissolved
at a dose of 8 mg/mL in PBS. The mice were randomized to receive different doses of MA (5, 10, 20, and
40 mg/kg) to screening the optimum dose. Subsequently,
the mice were subjected to the optimum dose of 20 mg/
kg MA or the same amount of PBS by caudalvein injection within 15 min after the onset of reperfusion randomly. PPARγinhibitor T0070907 (Selleckchem) were
given at a dose of 2 mg/kg by caudalvein injection 1 h
before MCAO surgery. The mice were divided into five
groups: sham-veh, sham-MA, MCAO-veh, MCAO-MA,
and MCAO-MA-T0070907. Drugs or vehicles were
arranged and labeled by an independent researcher
according to the randomization plan.

Cell culture and treatment

Mice primary microglia cells were prepared from 1 to
2 days old mice as previously described [15]. Briefly, the
cerebral cortex was gently dissociated and digested in
0.25% trypsin EDTA for 10 min at room temperature
and then terminate digesting using the same amount of
DMEM with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and
100 mg/mL strexptomycin (culture medium). The resulting cells were centrifuged at 800 rpm at 37°C for
10 min. Carefully, aspirated the supernatant and resuspended the cells in the culture medium. The cells were
seeded in 75-cm2 flasks for 10 to 12 days before the
microglia cells were separated from the mixed glia cells
by shaking the flasks at 180 rpm for 2 h, at 37°C. The
obtained microglia cells were seeded into 6-well plates at
a density of 5 × 105/cm2for 2 to 3 days before ready for
further treatment. The purity of the microglia cells was
more than 95% as determined by Iba1 staining. The
microglia cells were exposed to LPS from Escherichia
coli O55:B5 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at a
dose of 1 μg/mL for 2 h before treated by DMEM with
or without 1 μM MA for 15 h.

Quantification of infarct size

A 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) assay was
performed as previously described [14]. Both sides of
each slice were photographed with a digital camera. The
infarction size was measured by image analysis software
(ImageJ, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD,
USA) and integrated across five slices. Mice were excluded if intracranial or subarachnoid hemorrhage was
found. The infarct volume was expressed as a percentage
of the contralateral side.

Neurological severity scores

Neurological severity scores (NSS) were evaluated at 24,
48, and 72 h after MCAO as published previously [14].
Neurological function was graded on a scale of 0 to 18
(0 as normal score and 18 as maximal deficit score).
NSS is a composite of motor, sensory, reflex, and balance tests. In the severity scores of injury, one point is
awarded for the inability to perform a test or for the lack
of a tested reflex. Therefore, a higher score means more
serious injury symptoms.
Real-time PCR

Real-time PCR was performed as described previously
[16]. Briefly, the total RNA from cortex or cells was extracted using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) and was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using
a PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (Takara, Dalian, China)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR was
performed using quantitative PCR (ABI 7500, Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in the presence of
a fluorescent dye (SYBR Green I; Takara Belmont, Somerset, NJ, USA). Triplicate wells were performed for each
sample to obtain the cycle threshold (CT) mean, and
any outlier of the triplicates was excluded if its CT
value is far than 0.5 from the other two. The CT value
was normalized to GAPDH of the same sample. The
expression levels of mRNAs were reported as fold

Western blot

The procedure was used as previously published with
slight modification [14]. Nuclear protein was extracted
with using the Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extract Kit
(KeyGEN, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions in the presence of protease inhibitor.
After sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE electrophoresis, the
samples were blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane which were then probed with related primary antibodies of PPARγ (1:500, Bioworld, Irving, TX, USA).
Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were then used, and the reaction was observed using chemiluminescence reagents provided with
the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway,
NJ, USA) and exposed to a Fuji X-ray film (Fujifilm,
Tokyo, Japan). The intensity of blots was quantified by
densitometry.
Co-immunostaining

The brain slices were prepared as previously published
[17]. After being blocked with 5% goat serum (TBST),
the brain slices were incubated with CD16/32 antibody
(1:500, BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA), CD206
(1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and Iba-1 (1:500,
Wako, Richmond, VA) overnight at 4°C to 8°C. The sections were then treated with a fluroscencesecondary
antibodies (1: 500, Invitrogen), and images were taken
using a fluorescencemicroscope (Olympus PX51, Olympus
Corporation, Shinjuku-ku, Japan) and analyzed with
Adobe Photoshop 5.5 software. The cell number calculation was determined by counting of three randomly
selected microscopic fields across three slides in the penumbra of ipsilateral cortex. Data are expressed as mean ±
SD number of the percentage of CD16/32+ or CD206+
cells to the Iba-1+ cells.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed using the LightShift Chemuliminescent EMSA
Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Briefly, equal
amounts of nuclear sample were separated by 100 V on
the same gel and then electrophoretically transferred to

Pan et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2015) 12:51

a nylon membrane at 380 mA for 30 min. The DNA was
then transferred to a membrane using a UV-light crosslinking instrument (Scientz Biotechnology Co., Ltd.,
Ningbo City, China) with 254-nm bulbs for 45 to 60 s.
Then, the biotin-labeled DNA was detected by chemiluminescence in the dark and visualized using autoradiography using Fuji X-ray film. The PPARγ probe used was
F: 5'-CAA AAC TAG GTC AAA GGT CA-3', R: 3'-GTT
TTG ATC CAG TTT CCA GT-5' (Invitrogen). Control
EBNA system was processed at the same time.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays was performed using the EZ-ChIP Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
mice brain was collected after euthanization at 24 h. Then,
37% fresh formaldehyde was added directly into the tissues
at a final concentration of 1%, and they were incubated for
10 min at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction
was stopped by incubation with 0.125 M glycine for
5 min. The tissues were then processed using 2 ml prechilled PBS containing 1× protease inhibitors. Lysis buffer
was added to harvested nuclei, and chromatin was then
sheared by controlled sonication. The sheared, crosslinked chromatin was then mixed with protein G agarose
beads and immunoprecipitating antibody against PPARγ
(1:500, cell signaling) or normal mouse IgG (as a negative
control) diluted in appropriate dilution buffer overnight at
4°C. The agarose beads with bound antibody-proteinDNA complexes were washed, and ChIP-DNA fragments
were purified following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Finally, DNA sequences were amplified by real-time PCR
using the following primers against the PPARγ site in
CD206 promoter: 5'-AATCGTGGAATTTCCTCTGACA-3'
(sense) and 5'-GTTTCTTCCTGGCTCTTGTCCT-3' (antisense) and YM-1 promoter: 5'-TATGCCTTTGTCCAAGTC
TGA-3' (sense) and 5'-GGAAGCGAGGAAACTAGAT
GA-3' (antisense). PCR conditions were as described
previously.
Statistical analysis

The number of animals in each group was based on a
power analysis using PASS assuming a standard deviation of 12.5% and a treatment effect of 30% (based on
our own pilot study with TTC staining at 72 h) and setting α at 5% and 1-β at 80% (statistical power) for TTC
test. The sample size thus obtained was four animals per
group. The data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and analyzed using IBMSPSS 22.0 statistical
analytical. For western blot (n = 4), comparisons between
groups were performed by Kruskal-Wallis test followed
by pairwise multiple comparisons. For other experiments, comparisons between multiple groups were performed using one-way ANOVAs followed by post hoc

Turkey HSD test. The comparative difference was considered significant at P < 0.05.

Results
Malibatol A protects against ischemic brain injury in
MCAO mice

To evaluate the effect of MA after ischemic stroke, the
infarct size of mice brains were quantified by TTC at
different doses and different time points. Higher dose of
MA (10 to 40 mg/kg) significantly reduced infarction
(Figure 1A). The following experiments were performed
at a dose of 20 mg/kg MA. Results indicated that treatment of MA significantly decreased the infarct size:
39.7% ± 4.2% in MCAO-veh vs. 21.3% ± 5.3% in MCAOMA at 24 h (P < 0.05); 38.6% ± 3.5% in MCAO-veh vs.
20.4% ± 5.4% in MCAO-MA at 48 h (P < 0.05); 38.9% ±
4.1% in MCAO-veh vs.18.7% ± 5.7% in MCAO-MA at
72 h (P < 0.05) (n = 10 per group) (Figure 1D).
NSS were assessed on each mouse after ischemic injury. The change of NSS is significant between MCAOveh and MCAO-MA treated groups: 12.4 ± 1.4 in
MCAO-veh vs. 9.1 ± 1.9 in MCAO-MA at 24 h (P <
0.05); 10.1 ± 1.7in MCAO-vehvs. 7.4 ± 2.1 in MCAO-MA
at 48 h (P < 0.05);9.8 ± 1.9 in MCAO-vehvs.6.4 ± 1.5 in
MCAO-MA at 72 h (P < 0.05) (n = 10) (Figure 1B).
A total of 229 mice underwent the MCAO procedure.
Of these, 12 were excluded, either for unsuccessful occlusion (CBF as measured by LDF > 30% baseline, n = 7)
or for hemorrhagic transformation (n = 5), and 29 died
either during (n = 10) or after surgery (n = 19). The animals that died post-surgery were evenly distributed between groups (MCAO-veh: n = 9, MCAO-MA: n = 5,
MCAO-MA-T0070907: n = 6).
MA-inhibited inflammatory responses in MCAO mice
cortex

Secretion of inflammatory cytokines is a key feature after
stroke. In this study, the mRNA expressions of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS, and IL-6 in ipsilateral brain cortex were detected at different time
points after stroke (Figure 2A,B,C,D). Generally, expressions of the cytokines were increased soon after stroke
and peaked at 24 h (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) or 48 h (iNOS)
post-MCAO. However, in the presence of MA, the dramatic increase was blunted from 6 h after stroke, and
the effect continued to 72 h, most significantly occurring
at 24 and 48 h. As expected, no differences were observed between the sham-MA and the sham-veh groups.
IL-10 is regarded as a beneficial cytokine with reduced
inflammation and immune reaction [18]. Interestingly,
the expression of IL-10 drastically increased at 72 h by
3.8-fold in the MCAO-veh group compared to that in
sham mice, and MA moved the increase forward 2.8fold as compared to the MCAO-veh group (Figure 2E).

TGF-β is believed to be important in regulation of the
immune system by Foxp3+ Regulatory T cell and Th17
cells. In this study, higher level of TGF-β was discovered
at 48 and 72 h in the MCAO-MA group compared with
the MCAO-veh group (Figure 2F).
MA-inhibited inflammatory responses in LPS-stimulated
microglia

The mRNA expression of IL-6, iNOS, MCP-1, and TNFα were increased significantly after stimulated with LPS
in primary microglia and reduced markedly at 15 h after
treatment of MA. The expression of IL-10 in LPSstimulated primary microglia showed significant increase
after treatment with MA compared with non-treated
group (Figure 3). These in vitro results are in accordance
with the in vivo ones.

polarization process by promoting a beneficial opponent,
M2 phenotype.

MA stimulated PPARγ nuclear translocation in MCAO
mice cortex

To explore whether PPARγ plays a role in the mechanism of MA treatment, the expression of PPARγ was
tested in the ipsilateral brain cortex at 24 h after MCAO
using western blot. It is pointed out that PPARγ is
expressed in the normal brain tissue although at a very
low level [19]. In the study, expression of PPARγ was
significantly reduced in cytoplasm but was increased in
nuclei in the MCAO-MA group compared with the
MCAO-veh group, indicating nuclear translocation of
PPARγ after MA treatment (Figure 6B,C). Interestingly,
the total PPARγ expression did not show much difference among different groups (Figure 6A).

MA-promoted M2 markers and inhibited M1 markers in
MCAO mice cortex

Activated microglia/macrophages are distinguished by
their expression of feature genes for surface markers.
Using real-time PCR, it was found that the expression of
M1 markers (CD16, CD32, and CD86) and M2 markers
(CD206, YM-1) were all increased after MCAO. However, the M1 markers increased much more dramatically
than M2 markers. MA reversed the increasing trend of
M1 markers, but stimulated M2 markers at 48 and 72 h
(Figure 4A,B,C,D,E).
Consistent with the real-time PCR results, the expression of the M1 marker CD16/32 was highly presented in
Iba1+ cells (microglia/macrophage) in MCAO mouse
brain slices. The co-expression was obviously less in the
presence of MA (Figure 5B,D). In contrast, the coexpression of M2 marker CD206 and Iba1 was higher in
the MCAO-MA group compared with the MCAO-veh
group (Figure 5C,E). The results suggest that microglia/
macrophage largely activate into classical M1 phenotype
without intervention. However, MA influenced the

MA enhanced transcriptional activity of PPARγ in MCAO
mice cortex

PPARγ activation is positively related to M2 genes expression. To investigate whether MA alters M2 gene expression by accelerating PPARγ transcriptional activity,
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was conducted at 24 h after MCAO. PPARγ-DNA binding activity was significantly decreased in MCAO group
compared to sham, but was reversed in the presence of
MA (P < 0.05) (n = 6) (Figure 7A).
To investigate whether M2 genes CD206 and YM-1
are the direct PPARγ target genes, ChIP assays were performed using primers from PPARγ binding sites in
CD206/YM-1 promoter. The binding activity of YM-1
promoter was increased in the MCAO-MA group in
post-MCAO at 24 and 48 h compared to the MCAOveh group (Figure 7C). However, no significant changes
were observed in the binding activity of CD206 in this
study (Figure 7D).

PPARγ inhibitor T0070907 switched the protective effect
of MA in a M1/M2 dependent manner

Mice with PPARγT0070907 inhibitor given 1 h before
MCAO surgery have significantly larger infarct size at 24,
48, and 72 h after MCAO compared with MA alone
treated group. The infarct sizes of MCAO-MA-T0070907
group are as follows: 36.1% ± 4.1% at 24 h, 34.3% ± 4.1% at
48 h, and 37.7% ± 4.3% at 72 h (P < 0.05) (n = 10). The
NSSs of MCAO-MA-T groups are as follows: 10.2 ± 1.3 at
24 h, 9.4 ± 1.4 at 48 h, and 9.2 ± 1.6 at 72 h (P < 0.05) (n =
10). No significant differences were demonstrated between
the MCAO-veh and MCAO-MA-T groups.
To explore whether PPARγ inhibitor T0070907 influenced the microglia/macrophage phenotypes, q-PCR was
processed. In the MCAO-MA-T0070907 group, M1
marker CD16 and CD32 are significantly higher when compared with the MCAO-MA group at 48 and 24 h, respectively (Figure 8A,B). While M2 marker YM-1 in the
MCAO-MA-T0070907 group is decreased significantly
comparing with the MCAO-MA group at 48 h (Figure 8D).

Discussion
In this study, mouse transient cerebral ischemia model is
used to demonstrate a novel neuroprotective resveratrol

oligomer extraction. We performed a set of experiments
to show that MA significantly reduced the infarct size and
improved the neural function. In addition, our discoveries
also showed that the neuroprotective effects of MA are
largely associated with anti-inflammatory effects by activating M2 polarization in a PPARγ-dependent manner.
Even though it is not the first evidence showing that
antioxidants may have anti-inflammatory effects, we still
performed the experiment in both MCAO model and
in vitro ways to provide reliable evidence for our hypothesis. In accordance with the in vivo results, MA showed
strong anti-inflammation effects in LPS-stimulated
microglia, which demonstrate a direct function in inhibiting the pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the other
hand, we also evaluated the anti-oxidant effects of MA
in vivo study [20].
In this study, for the MCAO-veh group, M1 genes including CD16, CD32, and CD86 increased soon after
stroke and remained high at 72 h. On the other hand,
M2 hallmark YM-1 began to decrease 72 h postischemia though increasing was found at 48 h. This data
is in accordance with that of Hu et. al. showing the increase of M1 markers from days 1 to 14 post-ischemia
except for CD86, which decreased after day 5,while M2

marks CD206 and YM-1 demonstrated decreasing at
earlier time point [21]. Similar trend of CD206 and YM1 results were also found with immunohistochemistry
method in a mice permanent MCAO model [22]. Treatment of MA dampened the upgrading of M1 cytokines
but enhanced M2 hallmarks at different time points.
However, it might be argued that M1/M2 genes are not
expressed only by resident microglia but are also marks
of infiltrating peripheral macrophages. The participation
of peripheral macrophage cannot be ignored especially
when the blood-brain barrier is not intact during brain
injury. It is conceded that resident microglia and bloodderived macrophage are indistinguishable functionally
and morphologically. However, according to literatures,
hematogenous macrophage does not recruit into CNS
abundantly until day 4 after stroke [23,24]. Even after
day 4, the amount is relatively low compared to resident
microglia. Thus, we assumed that the M1/M2 detected
in this study is mainly expressed by resident microglia.
PPARγ is a widely expressed nuclear transcriptional
factor with well-established protective features. Activation of PPARγ is associated with anti-inflammation in
various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease
[25] and ischemia reperfusion-induced kidney injury
[26]. Beyond the functions in peripheral systems, PPARγ
is also reported as a potential therapeutic target in central nervous system diseases due to its relationship to
decreasing pro-inflammatory mediators and improving
neurological outcome [27]. PPARγ activation is positively
related to ameliorating experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice [28] and reducing amyloid deposition along with improving cognitive function
in Alzheimer’s disease models [29]. Liu et al. reported
suppressed PPARγ expression and activity in rat brain ischemia, and recovered PPARγ was associated with alleviated brain injury [30]. These findings brought up the
idea that PPARγ may be a potential therapeutic target
after ischemia. In this study, increased PPARγ nuclear
translocation and enhanced transcriptional activities
after MA treatment indicates potential elevated activation of PPARγ, and the result is further verified by suppression of MA-induced protection through PPARγ
inhibitor T0070907.
One of the important roles of PPARγ in the control of
inflammation may be related with regulation of M1/M2
phenotype as demonstrated in a post-incisional pain
study [31] and Alzheimer’s disease model [29]. Microglia
are mostly related to inducing inflammatory cytokines
and recruitment of immune cells after ischemic stroke.
While microglia is known as a key factor in the rapid,
excessive activation of inflammation after CNS injury
[32], it remains inconclusive whether microglia has no
beneficial effects as it shows some importance in synapse
remodeling [33], neurogenesis, and even after stroke

[34] until recent research started to focus on the balance
of microglia polarization. The evidence of microglia
polarization in ischemic stroke models brought up the
concept that, compared with general suppression of
microglia activation, the inhibition of M1-activated
microglia along with encouragement of M2 activation
will become a more reasonable treatment target for
inflammation-leading diseases [21].
The evidence has shown that activation of PPARγ will
increase M2 gene expression in macrophages/microglia,
including Arg-1 [35], CD206, and IL-10 [36]. The administration of rosiglitazone increased the expression of
M2-specific markers, including Arg1, FIZZ1, and IL-10
[31]. In the current study, MA treatment after MCAO
enhanced the activity of PPARγ and further increased its
binding activity with M2 genes YM-1 promoter, which
will contribute to the enhancement of transcriptional activity of M2 genes. However, PPARγ activation may not
be the only way for stimulating M2 gene expression;
thus, no difference of binding activity of PPARγ and
CD206 was found in MCAO-MA group in this study.
In conclusion, the major discovery of the current study
is to demonstrate the protective effects of MA, a novel
resveratrol oligomer from H. hainanensis, in ischemic
stroke by inhibiting inflammation through activation of
PPARγ. The effects are related to balancing M1/M2 phenotypes. Our finding suggests that MA is a promising
candidate in stroke treatment.
