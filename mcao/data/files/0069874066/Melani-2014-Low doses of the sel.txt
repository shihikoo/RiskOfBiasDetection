at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg transiently increased heart frequency but did not modify blood

pressure. Following transient MCAo, CGS21680 at both doses protected from neurological
deﬁcit from the ﬁrst day up to 7 days thereafter. At this time, it has reduced microgliosis,
astrogliosis and improved myelin organization in the striatum and cytoarchitecture of the
ischemic cortex and striatum. Two days after transient MCAo, CGS21680 has reduced the
number of inﬁltrated granulocytes into the ischemic tissue. Data indicate that CGS21680
systemically administered is protective by immunosuppressive effects.

Introduction

Adenosine is a potent biological mediator whose concentration dramatically increases during brain ischemia (Melani
et al., 1999; Phillis, 2004). During ischemia the extracellular
adenosine reaches a concentration in a micromolar range
able to stimulate all the four adenosine receptor subtypes
(A1, A2A, A2B, A3). In recent years, evidence indicated that
adenosine A2A receptor subtype is of critical importance in
stroke (Chen et al., 2007). An overexpression of A2A adenosine
receptors occurs at central level on neurons and microglia of
ischemic striatum and cortex after focal ischemia induced by
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo)
(Trincavelli et al., 2008). Adenosine A2A receptor subtype is
localized not only at central level on neurons, astrocytes and
microglia, but also peripherally on blood cells, platelets,
vasculatures, where it is known to reduce adhesion cell factor
production, platelet aggregation and neutrophil activation,
exerting therefore an antithrombotic, antioxidant and antiinﬂammatory effect (Sitkovsky et al., 2004).
Ischemia is a multifactorial pathology characterized by
different events evolving in time: an acute injury characterized by a massive increase of extracellular glutamate is
followed by activation of resident immune cells (i.e. microglia
and astrocytes), and production or activation of inﬂammation
mediators (Dirnagl et al., 1999). Proinﬂammatory cytokines,
that up-regulate cell adhesion molecules, exert an important
role in promoting blood cell inﬁltration and accumulation
into ischemic tissue (Huang et al., 2006; Stoll et al., 1998).
Although after ischemia, precocious activation of immune
cells may be neuroprotective and supportive for regeneration,
protracted neuroinﬂammation is now recognized as the
predominant mechanism of secondary brain injury (Dirnagl
et al., 1999). In agreement, A2A agonists, systemically administered, protected from inﬂammation in various models of
autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis (Mazzon
et al., 2011; Szabo et al., 1998), colitis (Di Paola et al., 2010;
Odashima et al., 2005), and hepatitis (Choukèr et al., 2008) and
in models of spinal cord trauma (Li et al., 2006; Genovese
et al., 2009; Paterniti et al., 2011) and of traumatic brain injury
(Dai et al., 2010). To clarify the role of adenosine A2A receptor

in brain ischemia, purpose of the present work was to check
the putative neuroprotective effects of the adenosine A2A
agonist, CGS21680 in a rat model of transient (1 h) focal
cerebral ischemia. Since adenosine A2A agonists are vasodilator drugs potentially hypotensive (Alberti et al., 1997), we
veriﬁed that the doses administered systemically after ischemia do not alter cardiovascular parameters.

Results

2.1.

Blood pressure and heart rate

The effect of the selective A2A adenosine receptor agonist
(CGS21680, 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg i.p.) on blood pressure and
heart rate was evaluated in a group of six rats (Table 1).
CGS21680 at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg, caused a transient, but
not statistically signiﬁcant reduction, of blood pressure
15 min after administration. In the ﬁrst hour after administration it induced a small but signiﬁcant increase of heart rate
(Table 1; po0.0001) that normalized after 1 h and 30 min.
At the lower dose of 0.01 mg/kg CGS21680 did not modify
either blood pressure or heart rate.

2.2.
Effect of treatment with the adenosine A2A receptor
agonist on neurological deﬁcit after tMCAo
After tMCAo (1 h), rats showed a clear neurological deﬁcit that
was evaluated by a sensory motor test (mNSS), according to
Chen et al. (2001). Sham-operated rats did not show any
neurological deﬁcit.
Fig. 1A shows that in the mNSS test, sham-operated rats
had a neurological score of 0.15–0.70 in the period from 1 to 7
days after tMCAo. Twenty-four hours after tMCAo, vehicletreated rats showed a neurological score of 12.670.5
(mean7S.E.M.) that deﬁnes a severe injury. The neurological
impairment spontaneously recovered over time, up to 7 days
after tMCAo. Five days after tMCAo the neurological score
was reduced to 8.270.7, 7 days after tMCAo, the neurological
score was further reduced to 7.070.6 that represents a
moderate injury. The chronic treatment with the A2A receptor
agonist, CGS21680, at both doses of 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg,

Fig. 1 – Effect of CGS21680 on neurological deﬁcit and body weight loss after tMCAo. Data are expressed as mean7S.E.M. of
“n” rat. (A) mNSS test. The score was evaluated before (0 day) and after 1, 5 and 7 days from tMCAo in each rat group. Twoway ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test: npo0.001–0.05 CGS21680-treated rats versus vehicle-treated rats; #po0.001
sham-operated rats versus vehicle-treated and CGS21680-treated rats. (B) Up to 7 days after operation, all rats subjected to
tMCAo lost body weight while sham-operated rats increased their body weight. Body weight loss was calculated as the
mean7S.E.M. of the difference between body weight evaluated at each time-point after surgery and the pre-operation body
weight. Two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test: npo0.001–0.05 CGS21680-treated versus vehicle-treated rats;

signiﬁcantly reduced the neurological deﬁcit at each time
point up to 7 days after tMCAo. Two-way ANOVA, calculated
for the two factors: treatment and time after tMCAo, showed
that treatment factor (F3,95 ¼ 56.97; po0.0001), time factor
(F3,95 ¼ 76.46; po0.0001) and interaction between treatment
and time (F9,95 ¼ 8.64; po0.0001) were statistically signiﬁcant.
The Bonferroni post hoc test indicated that sham-operated
rats had a neurological score signiﬁcantly different from
vehicle-treated and 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg CGS21680-treated
rats at each time-point (1, 5, 7 days after tMCAo, po0.001).
The chronic treatment with CGS21680 (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg)
signiﬁcantly reduced the neurological deﬁcit with respect
to vehicle-treated rats at 1, 5 and 7 days (po0.001–0.05)
after tMCAo.

2.3.
Effect of treatment with the adenosine A2A receptor
agonist on body weight loss after tMCAo
Male Wistar rats used in this study had a body weight in
range of 270–290 g. Twenty-four hours after operation, shamoperated rats lost 1.0070.97 g weight, then they increased in
body weight as evaluated up to 7 days after tMCAo. Vehicletreated rats lost 36.0071.59 g 1 day after tMCAo, 62.3777.89 g
5 days after tMCAo and 60.89710.99 g 7 days after tMCAo
(Fig. 1B). Chronic treatment with CGS21680 (0.01 and 0.1
mg/kg) reduced the body weight loss at 5 and 7 days after
tMCAo with respect to vehicle-treated rats.
Two-way ANOVA, calculated for the two factors: treatment and time from tMCAo, showed that treatment factor
(F3,66 ¼ 37.65; po0.0001), but not time factor (F2,66 ¼1.02;
po0.3), was statistically signiﬁcant. The interaction
between treatment and time (F6,66 ¼2.43; po0.03) was also

statistically signiﬁcant. The Bonferroni post hoc test indicated that in sham-operated rats, body weight was different with respect to vehicle-treated rats at each time point
(po0.001) and with respect to 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg CGS21680treated rats, at 5 and 7 days after tMCAo (po0.001). The
chronic treatment with CGS21680 (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg)
signiﬁcantly decreased body weight loss at 5 days (of
67.0% and 45.5%, respectively; po0.05-0.001) and 7 days
(of 77.5% and 60%, respectively; po0.001) after tMCAo, with
respect to vehicle-treated rats.

2.4.
Effect of treatment with the adenosine A2A receptor
agonist on brain ischemic damage after tMCAo
Fig. 2 shows the extent of ischemic damage evaluated as
infarct area (Fig. 2A) and infarct volume (Fig. 2B) in ischemic
cortex and striatum of vehicle- and CGS21680-treated rats 7
days after tMCAo. CGS21680, at both doses of 0.01 and 0.1
mg/kg, signiﬁcantly reduced the infarct area within the
cortex, but it did not change signiﬁcantly the area of the
ischemic damage in striatum. The cortical infarct volume was
reduced by 31% and 35% respectively in 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg
CGS21680-treated rats, with respect to vehicle-treated rats
(One-way ANOVA: po0.04) (Fig. 2B). Sham-operated rats did
not show any damage.
To characterize the cytoarchitecture of the ischemic cortex
and striatum 7 days after tMCAo, ischemic tissue was stained
by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) (Fig. 3A–F). Seven days after
transient ischemia, H&E staining showed a remarkable
decrease in staining intensity in vehicle-treated rats
(Fig. 3C, D) compared to the sham operated rats (Fig. 3A, B).
The paleness was due to the increase in extracellular ﬂuid

and to the enlargement of the interstitial spaces consequent
to edema; the parenchyma showed numerous small and
eterochromatic nuclei both in ischemic cortex and striatum.
The typical cytoarchitecture of these two regions (for a
description see Danner and Pﬁster, 1981) was lost. In the
striatum, the white matter fascicula (f) were no more recognizable; in the fronto-parietal cortex the columnar organization was not appreciable and very numerous eterochromatic
small nuclei were present. Fig. 3E, F shows that chronic
administration of CGS21680 at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg was
associated with a remarkable recovery of staining intensity
and with a reduction of eterochromatic small nuclei staining
in both brain regions. The cytoarchitecture of the white
matter fascicula was recognizable in the dorsal corpus striatum (Fig. 3E) and the columnar organization was appreciable
in the fronto-parietal cortex (Fig. 3F). Same effects were
obtained with the lower 0.01 mg/kg dose of CGS21680.
Myelin distribution in the striatal ischemic area was
studied by an antibody against myelin associate glycoprotein (MAG). Fig. 4 shows MAG immunostaining in the
striatum of sham-operated, vehicle- and CGS21680 0.1 mg/
kg-treated rats 7 days after tMCAo. In sham-operated rats,
MAG labeling was well organized within the white matter
fascicula of the caudate–putamen. The same distribution of
MAG labeling appeared in the contralateral non-ischemic
hemisphere (data not shown). In the ischemic striatum of
vehicle-treated rats, MAG labeling was not characterized by
the typical proﬁle of the white matter fascicula but appeared
irregularly distributed into fascicula. In rats chronically
treated with CGS21680 0.1 mg/kg MAG staining showed a
distribution similar to that observed in sham-operated rats.

Same effects were obtained with the 0.01 mg/kg dose of
CGS21680.

2.5.
Effect of treatment with the adenosine A2A receptor
agonist on gliosis after tMCAo
Seven days after surgery, microglia and astrocytes were
characterized by IBA-1 and GFAP immunostaining respectively, then tissue was co-stained with cresyl violet. In shamoperated rats, resting microglia (Fig. 5A, B, G, H) were
diffusely distributed throughout the cortex and striatum.
Microglia had morphological features typical of resting cells
with a small cell body and faintly stained thin processes.
Seven days after tMCAo, a deﬁnite increase of IBA-1 immunostaining was observed both in striatum and in cortex. In
the cortical and striatal ischemic core, microglia assumed a
round macrophage-like morphology, typical of activated cells
(Fig. 5C, I); in the boundary zone, microglial cells showed a
large cell body with thick and short processes (Fig. 5D, L), an
intermediate morphology between resting and activated
microglia, deﬁned reactive microglia (Melani et al., 2006).
Treatment with CGS21680 0.01 mg/kg reduced the IBA-1
immunostaining intensity in the ischemic areas of both
cortex (Fig. 5E, F) and striatum (Fig. 5M, N). Quantitative
analysis (Fig. 5P, Q) showed that CGS21680-treatment reduced
IBA1þ cell number in the ischemic core of striatum and cortex
and in the boundary zone of the striatum where a statistically
signiﬁcant difference versus respective vehicle-treated rats
was reached (po0.05; Fig. 5Q).
In sham-operated rats, resting astrocytes (Fig. 6A, B, G, H)
were diffusely distributed throughout the cortex and striatum.

Astrocytes had morphological features typical of resting cells
with a small cell body and faintly stained thin processes. Seven
days after tMCAo, a deﬁnite increase of GFAP immunostaining
was observed both in striatum and in cortex. In the boundary
zone, astrocytes showed a highly hypertrophic cell body and
long and thick processes (Fig. 6D, L) while in the ischemic core,

they showed smaller cell body and shorter processes (Fig. 6C, I).
After treatment with CGS21680 0.01 mg/kg, the GFAP immunostaining intensity appeared reduced both in core and in boundary
zone and astrocyte morphology appeared less hypertrophic
(Fig. 6E, F and M, N). Quantitative analysis (Fig. 6O, P) showed
that CGS21680-treatment signiﬁcantly reduced GFAPþ cell

Effect of treatment with the adenosine A2A receptor

after tMCAo, granulocytes were anymore detectable in the
ischemic tissue (ﬁgure not shown). No HIS-48-positive cells
were detected in the cortical and striatal tissue of shamoperated rats while two days after tMCAo, HIS-48-positive
cells were deﬁnitely detected in the striatal and cortical
ischemic core of vehicle rats. Chronic treatment with
CGS21680 0.01 mg/kg clearly reduced HIS-48-positive cells in
cortex and to some extent also in the striatum core. The
number of HIS-48-positive cells was reduced in a statistically
signiﬁcant way in cortical ischemic core after treatment with

Discussion

The present paper demonstrates that the selective adenosine
A2A receptor agonist, CGS21680, systemically administered at
a low dose that does not modify cardiovascular parameters,
reduces blood cell inﬁltration into the ischemic core 2 days
after tMCAo, reduces the ischemic brain damage as well as
gliosis and improves neurological deﬁcit evaluated up to 7
days after tMCAo.
Only two previous studies reported that adenosine A2A
receptor agonists have a neuroprotective effect in a model of
cerebral ischemia. Von Lubitz et al. (1995) demonstrated that
the A2A agonist APEC, administered systemically before a
global 10 min ischemia in gerbil, ameliorated recovery of
blood ﬂow, as well as animal and neuron survival.
Sheardown and Knutsen (1996) demonstrated that a high
dose of the selective A2A agonist CGS21680 (10 mg/kg i.p.),
administered after 5 min of global ischemia in the gerbil,
exhibited a highly signiﬁcant protection against neuronal
loss, but it was not active at 3 mg/kg. In these works
adenosine agonists were administered before ischemia or at
a high dose.
Adenosine A2A receptor mediates important effects on
blood pressure and heart rate. Schindler et al. (2004; 2005)
reported that the decrease of blood pressure induced by
CGS21680 at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg, i.p., in conscious rats is
most probably mediated by peripheral mechanisms, while
the increase of heart rate is mediated at central level. In the
present study, we demonstrate that CGS21680, administered
at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg, i.p., increased heart rate in the ﬁrst
hour after administration; heart rate normalized in the
following 1 h and 30 min. No effect on blood pressure or on
heart rate was observed at the lower dose of 0.01 mg/kg.
Therefore, the protective effects of CGS21680 at the dose of
0.01 mg/kg against ischemia reported in the present study,
cannot be attributed to changes in the cardiovascular parameters either at a peripheral or central level.
Seven days after tMCAo histological analysis, performed
by H&E staining, demonstrated that in vehicle-treated rats
the typical cytoarchitecture of the striatum, characterized by
white matter fascicula (Danner and Pﬁster, 1981), was no
longer recognizable and the columnar organization in the
fronto-parietal cortex was not appreciable. MAG staining also
showed that myelin distribution was disorganized within the
white matter fascicula of the striatum. Both doses of CGS21680
reconstituted the cortex and striatum cytoarchitecture. Seven
days after transient ischemia, H&E staining also showed
numerous eterochromatic small nuclei both in the ischemic
cortex and in the striatum. Their number was statistically
increased in comparison to sham animals. Selective immunostaining by GFAP and IBA-1 demonstrated that the eterochromatic small nuclei belong to astrocytes and microglia

picture (O) indicates regions where photomicrographs of ischemic core and boundary zone were captured. The tissue has
been counterstained with cresyl violet. In sham-operated rats, microglia (black cells) has morphological features of resting

immunostaining intensity is observed both in ischemic striatum and in cortex. In the cortical and striatal ischemic core,
microglia appears characterized by a round macrophage-like morphology, typical of activated cells (C, I). In the cortical and
striatal boundary zone, IBA-1 positive cells have a round cell body with short and thick processes, deﬁned reactive microglia
(D, L). Treatment with CGS21680 0.01 mg/kg reduces IBA-1 immunostaining intensity in the core and boundary zone of both

observed in the ischemic core and in the boundary zone.
Astrocytes appeared hypertrophic and microglial cells
showed a morphology typical of activated microglia. After
tMCAo, late microgliosis in ischemic tissue has been also
described by Zhao et al. (2012). It is today well known that in
the late phase of an ischemic event over-activation of microglia is detrimental and these resident immune cells are
involved in the neuroinﬂammation process (Schwartz, 2003;
Kriz, 2006; Block et al., 2007). Chronic treatment with both
doses (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg) of the A2A adenosine agonist

CGS21680, reduced gliosis and the number of eterochromatic
small nuclei in ischemic striatum and cortex 7 days
after tMCAo.
Selective immunostaining for granulocytes by HIS-48
showed numerous inﬁltrated cells in the ischemic striatal
and cortical cores 2 days after tMCAo, while after 7 days
inﬁltrated blood cells were no longer observed. Our results are
in agreement with previous data indicating that the peak of
neutrophil inﬁltration occurs at 6 and 48 h following 2 h
tMCAo (Zhang et al., 1994). Three days after tMCAo the
majority of immune cells are neutrophils and to a lesser

counterstained with cresyl violet. In sham-operated rats, astrocytes (black cells) have morphological features of resting cells
with a small cell body and thin ramiﬁed processes both in cortex (A, B) and in striatum (G, H). Seven days after tMCAo, a
deﬁnite increase of GFAP immunostaining intensity is observed both in ischemic striatum and in cortex. In the cortical and
striatal ischemic core, astrocytes have morphological features of suffering cells (C, I). In the cortical and striatal boundary
zone, GFAP-positive cells show a highly hypertrophic cell body and long and thick processes (D, L). Treatment with CGS21680
0.01 mg/kg reduces the GFAP immunostaining intensity in the core and boundary zone of both cortex (E, F) and striatum (M, N)

extent lymphocytes (Zhang et al., 1994; Gelderblom et al.,
2009). After ischemia, although reperfusion is necessary for
tissue survival, it also contributes to additional tissue
damage. After MCAo and subsequent reperfusion, there is
an initial increase of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability
(see in Sandoval and Witt, 2008) and a following biphasic
increase at 5 and 72 h (Kuroiwa et al., 1985). Changes in BBB
permeability are responsible for cell inﬁltration. Inﬁltrated
neutrophils expressing cytokines and chemotactic factors
promote expansion of the inﬂammatory response in the
ischemic tissue (Haskò and Pacher, 2008). Correlations among
neutrophil accumulation, severity of brain tissue damage and
neurological outcome have been reported by Apokov et al.

(1996). Our results demonstrate that chronic treatment with
the A2A adenosine agonist CGS21680 reduced the number of
granulocytes in ischemic core, 2 days after tMCAo.
These results are in agreement with previous observations
that A2A receptor agonists systemically administered after spinal
cord injury in mice protect from neurological and tissue damage,
reduce inﬂammation parameters and blood cells inﬁltration
(Cassada et al., 2002; Genovese et al., 2010, 2009). Many studies
have reported that selective activation of A2A receptors directly
on blood cells, including platelets, monocytes, some mast cells,
neutrophils and T cells inhibits proinﬂammatory responses
(Haskò et al., 2000; Lappas et al., 2006; Sitkovsky, 2003). The
protective effects of systemically administered adenosine A2A

receptor agonists were lost in mice deleted of A2A receptors on
bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) (Li et al., 2006) and were not
exerted when drugs were directly injected in the injured spinal
cord area (Paterniti et al., 2011). These results support the
hypothesis that protection by A2A receptor agonists systemically
administered after brain ischemia is due to peripheral immunosuppressive effects that reduce inﬁltration and inﬂammatory
cascade at central level.
In our study, we cannot however exclude that adenosine
A2A receptor agonists exert a role in brain ischemia also
acting on central A2A receptors. Activation of central A2A
receptors is known to increase expression and release of

neurotrophic factors (Sebastião and Ribeiro, 2009) such as
NGF from microglia (Heese et al., 1997), BDNF from mice
hippocampal neurons (Tebano et al., 2008) and from rat
cortical neurons (Jeon et al., 2011). Therefore, the increased
expression of neurotrophic factor(s) by adenosine A2A receptor stimulation may contribute to restore neurological functions and cerebral damage after brain ischemia.
Seven days after transient ischemia, the A2A receptor agonist
CGS21680 has deﬁnitely protected the cortex but not the striatum from the ischemic infarct. After MCAo, brain acute infarct
develops in terms of minutes and hours into caudo-putamen
and, later on, it spreads to the cortex (Garcia et al., 1995).

68

brain research 1551 (2014) 59–72

The striatum is perfused by lenticulostriate end arteries, while
the fronto-parietal cortex is also perfused by collateral vessels
(Tyson et al., 1984). For these reasons, after focal ischemia the
cerebral blood ﬂow persists higher in the cortex than in the
striatum and the ischemic cortex is considered the more salvageable area (Garcia et al., 1993). In our study, CGS21680 is administered 4 h after tMCAo, likely when the acute striatal damage has
already occurred and is no more preventable. The lack of infarct
volume reduction in striatum might also be due to the fact that
CGS21680, by activating central A2A receptors and by facilitating
expression and release of neurotrophic factors (Sebastião and
Ribeiro, 2009) and post-ischemic plasticity at corticostriatal
synapses, makes these connections more vulnerable to delayed
excitotoxicity (Gustafsson et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2001).
It is known that excitotoxicity plays a crucial role acutely
after ischemia (Dirnagl et al., 1999). It has been demonstrated
that striatal glutamate outﬂow reaches a peak between 60 and
120 min after MCAo (Melani et al., 1999; Gui et al., 2009) and is
maintained higher than basal up to 2 h after reperfusion (Gui
et al., 2009). Adenosine A2A receptors at central level are known
to regulate extracellular glutamate concentrations (Chen and
Pedata, 2008). Indeed, the increase of glutamate extracellular
levels is signiﬁcantly attenuated in the A2A knock-out mice (Gui
et al., 2009) and in rats treated with the selective adenosine A2A
receptor antagonist SCH58261 administered after MCAo
(Monopoli et al. 1998; Melani et al. 2003). Consistently, both A2A
receptor knock-out mice (Chen et al. 1999; Gui et al. 2009) and
rats treated with SCH58261 shortly after ischemia (Melani et al.
2003; 2006; 2009) are protected from ischemic damage. After
ischemia, the tissue damage is the result of a combination of the
precocious acute excitotoxic damage and of a secondary damage
due to neuroinﬂammation that develops hours and days after
MCAo (Dirnagl et al., 1999). An important mechanism of protection of the adenosine A2A receptor agonist CGS21680, administered chronically starting from 4 h after tMCAo and in the
following days, is the reduction of cell inﬁltration and neuroinﬂammation that develops hours and days after ischemia.
Twenty-four hours after transient ischemia, rats showed a
severe neurological impairment that tended to spontaneously
recover 5 and 7 days after tMCAo. Similar results were reported
by Chen et al. (2001). Chronic administration of CGS21680, at
both doses, protected from a sensorimotor deﬁcit including
balance, as evaluated by mNSS test starting from the ﬁrst day
up to 7 days after ischemia. Moreover, CGS21680 reduced body
weight loss 5 and 7 days after tMCAo showing to improve the
general health condition of animals. Protection from the neurological impairment by CGS21680 is not attributable to direct
effects on motility because CGS21680 at low doses (0.1 and 1 mg/
kg, i.p.) does not affect motor behavior of rats (Wardas et al.,
2003). Recovery of neurological functions might be secondary to
the protection exerted by CGS21680 both in the cortex and in the
striatum. Indeed, despite CGS21680 did not reduce the extent of
infarct in the striatum, it reconstituted the striatal cytoarchitecture and this might account for a functional recovery by residual
striatal neurons.

3.1.

Conclusions

After the acute phase of cerebral ischemia, the interplay of
resident glial cells with inﬁltrating peripheral blood cells

gives rise to neuroinﬂammation. Up to date, the understanding of post-ischemic inﬂammation and of the functions of
regulatory immune cells in ischemia is very limited. At the
moment the consequence of reducing or ablating the impact
of leukocyte-mediated injury on the evolution of the brain
infarction following the onset of focal ischemia remains to be
fully and adequately tested (see del Zoppo, 2010).
Adenosine A2A agonists administered several hours after
ischemia, by reducing blood cell inﬁltration and neuroinﬂammation might represent a strategy for an adequate
therapeutic intervention in this fragile system.

Experimental procedure

4.1.

Animals

Male Wistar rats (Harlan, Italy) weighting 270–290 g were
used. Animals were housed in groups of three with free
access to food and water and kept under standardized
temperature, humidity and light conditions (12 h light/dark
cycle). Animal care and use followed the directives of the
Council of the European Community (86/609/EC). All efforts
were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the
number of animals used.

4.2.

Surgery

Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by intraluminal middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in the right hemisphere. The
animals were anesthetized with 5.0% isoﬂurane (Baxter
International) and spontaneously inhaled 1.0–2.0% isoﬂurane
in air by the use of a mask. Body core temperature was
maintained at 37 1C with a recirculating pad and K module
and was monitored via an intrarectal type T thermocouple
(Harvard, Kent, UK). The surgical procedure to occlude the
MCA consisted in insertion of a 4-0 nylon monoﬁlament
(Doccol corporation, USA), via the external carotid artery into
the internal carotid artery in order to block the origin of the
MCA according to the procedure originally described by Longa
et al. (1989) and modiﬁed by Melani et al. (1999).
One hour after occlusion, animals were re-anesthetized with
isoﬂurane and reperfused by withdrawing the ﬁlament. The
sham operation was conducted by inserting the ﬁlament into the
internal carotid artery and immediately withdrawing it.

4.3.

Experimental groups

A group of animals were subjected to tMCAo and sacriﬁced 7
days after tMCAo. Rats were randomly allocated in the
following groups: (1) Sham-operated rats (n¼ 10): did not
receive any treatment; (2) tMCAoþvehicle group (n¼ 9): saline
with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO 0.1%) administered (i.p.)
twice/day for 7 days after tMCAo, starting 4 h after tMCAo;
(3) tMCAoþCGS21680 group (n ¼10): CGS21680 (0.01 or 0.1 mg/
kg, i.p.) administered twice/day for 7 days after tMCAo,
starting 4 h after tMCAo.
A second group of animals were subjected to tMCAo and
sacriﬁced 2 days after tMCAo. Rats were randomly allocated
in the following groups: (1) Sham-operated rats (n¼ 3): did not

brain research 1551 (2014) 59–72

receive any treatment; (2) tMCAoþvehicle group (n ¼3): saline
with DMSO (0.1%) administered (i.p.) twice/day for 2 days
after tMCAo, starting 4 h after tMCAo; (3) tMCAoþCGS21680
group (n¼ 6): CGS21680 (0.01 or 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) administered
twice/day for 2 days after tMCAo, starting 4 h after tMCAo.

4.4.

Drug administration

The selective adenosine A2A receptor agonist, 2-[p-(2-carboxyethyl)-phenethylamino]-5'-Nethylcarboxamidoadenosine
(CGS21680) (Tocris bioscience, Bristol, UK), was dissolved in
saline with 0.1% DMSO.
The CGS21680 was chronically administered at the dose of
0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg, i.p. Dose of 0.1 mg/kg was chosen on the
basis of that found protective against spinal and brain trauma
in previous in vivo studies (Dai et al., 2010; Genovese et al.,
2009; Paterniti et al., 2011). Dose of 0.01 mg/kg was detected in
the present study as a dose that does not modify blood
pressure and heart frequency.

4.5.

Blood pressure and heart rate measurement

The effect of intraperitoneal CGS21680 injection on systemic
blood pressure and heart rate was veriﬁed in a separate group
of six rats using a noninvasively operating blood pressure
analyzer BP-2000 (Visitech Systems, Inc., USA). Unanesthetized rats were introduced into a small holder mounted on a
thermostatically controlled warming plate maintained at
37–38 1C during measurement. The tail was inserted through
the cuff which contained a photoelectric pulse detector and
systolic blood pressure was recorded when the ﬁrst oscillation appeared during the gradual reduction of the cuff
pressure. Training sessions were necessary for the rats to
become accustomed. Recording sessions were then made by
a single investigator from 1 to 5 p.m. Ten readings were taken
for each measurement using BP-2000 analysis software. The
software allows to measure systolic and diastolic pressure
and to calculate mean blood pressure and heart rate.
Data were analyzed by averaging blood pressure and heart
rate values during a period of approximately 10 min for each
session: pre-treatment and 15, 30, 60, 90 min post-treatment.

4.6.

Neurological deﬁcit

The neurological deﬁcit was evaluated by modiﬁed Neurological Severity Score (mNSS) test described by Chen et al.
(2001). All tests were carried out before tMCAo (training test)
and 1, 5 and 7 days after tMCAo (evaluation test).
The mNSS test evaluates the sensorimotor deﬁcit: it is
composed of motor, sensory, reﬂex and balance tests. In
evaluating the severity score of injury, 1 score point is
awarded for the inability to perform the test or for the lack
of a tested reﬂex. The score assigned to each rat at completion of the evaluation equals the sum of all test scores. The
test is graded on a scale from 0 (normal score) to 18 (maximal
deﬁcit score). In the beam balance test, animals were trained
to traverse a beam once a day since two days and the
morning before MCAo. A score between 0 (normal score)
and 6 (maximal deﬁcit score) was assigned to each animal

69

in function of the ability to stay and walk on the beam. Beam
balance test score affects 1/3 of the total mNSS score.

4.7.

Body weight evaluation

Rats used to induce cerebral ischemia were in the body
weight ranging from 270 to 290 g. The body weight was
evaluated before tMCAo and after 1, 5, 7 days from occlusion.
The weight loss after ischemia of each animal was evaluated
with respect to its own pre-ischemia weight.

4.8.

Ischemic brain damage

Rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg i.p.,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) and were perfused
transcardially with an ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde solution
(in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). Brains were post-ﬁxed overnight and cryoprotected in a 18% sucrose solution (in phosphate buffer) for at least 48 h. Brains were cut with a cryostat
and coronal sections (30 mm) were collected at 450 mm intervals at 12 different levels through the striatum (from
þ2.2 mm to -2.7 mm from Bregma, see König and Klippel,
1967).
Seven days after tMCAo, brain slices were stained by
acetate cresyl violet (1%) or by hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E). Histological analysis by cresyl violet staining allows
to clearly deﬁne the infarct area and volume up to 1 week
after ischemia (Rousselet et al., 2012). To evaluate area and
volume of ischemic damage, 12 cresyl violet-stained brain
sections per animal were placed directly on the scanning
screen of a color ﬂatbed scanner (CanoScan LiDE 90; Canon).
Following image acquisition, the images were analyzed using
ImageJ software. The measurements of infarct areas in
striatum and cortex were obtained by manually outlining
the margins of infarcted areas. All measurements were
performed in blind. Ischemic cortical and striatal volumes
were calculated by multiplying the infarcted area by the slice
thickness and summing the volume of the 12 slices.

4.9.

MAG staining

Coronal sections (30 mm), stored at –20 1C in antifreeze solution (30% ethylene glycol, 30% glycerol in phosphate buffer)
until assay, were mounted on gelatin-coated slides and
washed with phosphate buffer saline, 0.3% Triton X-100
(PBS-TX) (for 3 times, 5 min each), blocked with blocking
buffer (5 mg/ml of Bovine Serum Albumin/PBS-TX) for 1 h at
room temperature (RT). Sections were then incubated overnight at RT with the primary mouse monoclonal antibody,
anti-myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG, 1:250; Millipore,
Temecula, CA, USA) dissolved in blocking buffer, used to
visualize myelinated processes of oligodendrocytes.
The day after, the primary antibody was removed. Slices
were washed several times with PBS-TX solution and incubated, in the dark, for 2 h at RT with secondary ﬂuoresceinconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:400; Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), dissolved in blocking
buffer. After a washing in PBS-TX, sections were mounted
on gelatin-coated slides using Vectashield (Vectastain, Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) as a mounting medium.

70

Sections were observed under an epiﬂuorescent Olympus
BX40 microscope (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) with excitation wavelength at 488 and 568 nm and photographed using
a digital camera (Olympus DP50). Images were assembled into
montages using Adobe Photoshop 6.1 (Adobe Systems, Mountain view, CA, USA).

4.10.

Blood cell inﬁltration and gliosis

Coronal sections (30 mm), stored at –20 1C in antifreeze solution until assay, were mounted on gelatin-coated slides and
washed with PBS-TX. Then they were incubated for 15 min in
PBS-TX containing 0.75% H2O2, rinsed in PBS-TX and incubated at RT in Blocking Buffer for 60 min. After washing in
PBS-TX, the sections were incubated overnight at 4 1C with
mouse monoclonal antibody, anti-HIS-48 (speciﬁc for granulocytes) (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal
antibody, anti-GFAP (speciﬁc for astrocytes) (1:300, BD Transduction Laboratories) and rabbit polyclonal antibody,
anti-IBA-1 (speciﬁc for microglia) (1:300, Wako Chemicals),
dissolved in Blocking Buffer.
The day after, sections were rinsed three times in PBS-TX
and then were incubated for 1 h at RT with the speciﬁc
biotinylated secondary antibodies, anti-mouse-IgG or antirabbit-IgG (1:333) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA)
respectively, dissolved in Blocking Buffer. After washing in
PBS-TX, sections were incubated for 60 min in avidin-biotinperoxidase complex (ABC kit Elite standard, Vectastain, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Finally, all sections
were stained using diaminobenzidine (DAB-peroxidase, Vectastain, Vector) in the presence of NiCl. Then sections were
counterstained by submerging mounted sections in cresyl
violet (1%) for 2 min before dehydration.
All sections were examined using an Olympus BX40
microscope (Olympus, Milan, Italy) and photographed using
a digital camera (Olympus DP50). To evaluate the number of
granulocytes, astrocytes and microglia, cells were counted
within an optical ﬁeld at 40  magniﬁcation in ischemic
cortex and striatum (see Figs. 5–7). HIS-48-positive cells were
counted at seven different levels per animal (AP¼ 71.3 mm
from the Bregma). GFAP- and IBA-1-positive cells were
counted at Bregma level. Data were then averaged and
expressed as the mean7SEM of number cells per optical ﬁeld
of “n” animals.

4.11.

Statistical analysis

Data were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed
by Bonferroni post-hoc test and by unpaired Student's t test
as speciﬁed in text and in ﬁgure legends. The statistical
analysis was performed utilizing GraphPad Prism 4. Differences of po0.05 were considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.
