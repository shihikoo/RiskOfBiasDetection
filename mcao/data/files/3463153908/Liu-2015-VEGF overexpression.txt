pS292 MeCP2 in reactive astrocytes, and this effect was accompanied by a marked increase in
reactive astrocytes. On the contrary, MeCP2 was predominantly expressed in the neuronal
nucleus, and the level of this protein was not signiﬁcantly altered after ischemic injury and VEGF
overproduction.

Introduction

Ischemic stroke caused by a sudden disruption of blood ﬂow in
the brain leads to acute neural cell death and a series of
neurological deﬁcits. However, effective clinical therapies
remain limited and are unable to be applied to a wide range
of patients because of their narrow therapeutic window. On this
basis, extensive research efforts have been devoted to the
activation of endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs), which is
considered a potential avenue for the promotion of neuroprotection and restoration of neural networks following stroke
(Kalladka and Muir, 2014). Interestingly, astrocytes are reactivated after cerebral ischemia through the expression of nestin,
a marker for NSCs. Recently, increasing evidence has demonstrated that nestin-expressive reactive astrocytes acquire stem
cell properties after injury and can further differentiate into
neurons in vitro via transcription factor overexpression
(Berninger et al., 2007; Buffo et al., 2008), indicating that reactive
astrocytes may function as a source of endogenous multipotent
cells under pathological conditions. Therefore, it will be of great
value to investigate the characteristics of these ischemiainduced reactive astrocytes in the brain.
Emerging epigenetic mechanisms have recently been
shown to serve as intrinsic reprogramming factors to modulate almost every aspect of NSC development, including
self-renewal, proliferation, neurogenesis, gliogenesis, cell
migration, synaptic plasticity, and neural network integration
(Qureshi and Mehler, 2010). Therefore, the involvement of
DNA methylation in stroke has been examined in several
studies. Endres et al. (2000, 2001) reported that the incorporation of a methyl group into the 50 -cytosine of DNA increased
after mild ischemia and that a reduced level of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) in post-mitotic neurons protected from
ischemic brain injury by decreasing the infarct volume and
increasing the density of neuron-like viable cells, indicating
an important role for methylated DNA in stoke-injured brain.
Notably, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a member of
the methyl-CpG-binding protein family, can bind to the
methylated CpGs in the promoters of target genes to regulate

which will offer a novel epigenetic interpretation to the
features of reactivated astrocytes in the ischemic brain.
MeCP2 could be phosphorylated at different serine sites to
play distinct roles in transcription. The well-documented phospho-S421 (pS421) or phospho-S80 (pS80) modiﬁcation causes
MeCP2 to isolate from or bind with the promoters of target
genes to modulate transcription in opposite manners (Tao et al.,
2009; Zhou et al., 2006). Moreover, different phosphorylated
MeCP2 isoforms can interact with distinct co-factors to initiate
disparate transcriptional pathways (Gonzales et al., 2012),
suggesting that phosphorylation modiﬁcations can directly
regulate the function of MeCP2 in the brain. To the best of our
knowledge, there remain many other unexamined serine sites
predicted for the phosphorylation of MeCP2, such as S292 (Diaz
de Leon-Guerrero et al., 2011), the identiﬁcation of which may
assist us in further comprehending the function of MeCP2.
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a neurotrophic
factor with biphasic effects in the ischemic brain. Although
systematic delivery of VEGF can be detrimental during the
acute injury phase by inducing blood–brain barrier (BBB)
leakage and brain edema (Ma et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2000),
topical administration of VEGF exerts signiﬁcant beneﬁcial
effect on the ischemic brain via reducing infarct size and
promoting neurogenesis in the chronic period (Jin et al., 2002;
Wang et al., 2007, 2009). In addition, it has been shown that
VEGF and its receptors can be expressed in astrocytes, and
hypoxia can further upregulate the level of VEGF in reactive
astrocytes (Kaur et al., 2006; Shin et al., 2010), indicating an
important role of astrocytic VEGF post stroke. Moreover,
although plenty of studies have paid great attention to the
signal pathways of VEGF, such as Notch, Pten, MEK/ERK and
PI3K/AKT (Fournier et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2010), few investigations have focused on the epigenetic mechanisms involved in
this process, and the underlying epigenetic-related function of
VEGF in reactive astrocytes also remains largely unknown. On
this basis, we examined the expressive characteristics of
phospho-S292 MeCP2 (pS292 MeCP2) and MeCP2 in the adult
rat striatum following cerebral ischemia and VEGF overproduction to provide some preliminary insights into the MeCP2mediated epigenetic modulation in the stroke-injured brain.

transcription (Chahrour et al., 2008). MeCP2 is abundant in
mammal brains and primarily expressed in mature postmigratory neurons (Jung et al., 2003). Recently, there is
increasing evidence for the critical role of MeCP2 in astrocytes, showing that MeCP2 deﬁciency in glia could affect the
development of neurons, and the restoration of MeCP2 in the

Fig. 1 – Cerebral ischemia induced an increase in the cytoplasmic pS292 MeCP2 level in the striatum of the rat brain following
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). An illustration of the animal experimental protocols is indicated in (A). The animals
received a 30-min MCAO followed by immediate plasmid injection into the lateral ventricle (LV) and were sacriﬁced three or
14 days after MCAO. The infarct core (shading area, (a)) and plasmid injection site are illustrated in (B). The images used for
cell counting were captured along the lateral ventricle wall of the infarct striatum at a distance of about 50 μm from the wall
into the parenchyma (dotted line, (b)). The cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins of the infarct striatum were separated to conﬁrm
the intracellular localization of MeCP2 and pS292 MeCP2 (C) and (D). The speciﬁcity of pS292 MeCP2 antibody was validated by
the application of alkaline phosphatase (PPTase) for striatal protein extractions (C). pS292 MeCP2 was detected mainly in the
cytoplasmic component, whereas MeCP2 was found in the nucleus (C) and (D). The expression of pS292 MeCP2 increased
markedly (E), whereas the MeCP2 level did not change signiﬁcantly three and 14 days post ischemia (F). GAPDH and β-actin
were used as the loading controls for the cytoplasmic proteins, and H3 was used as the loading control for the nuclear
proteins. The data present the means7SEM (n ¼4 per group). nPo0.05 compared with the sham-operated group. CC: corpus

or ischemic-injured striatum three and 14 days after MCAO and
then subjected them to western blot analysis (Fig. 1C–F). First, we
validated the speciﬁcity of pS292 MeCP2 antibody through the
application of alkaline phosphatase (PPTase) for the extraction of
striatal proteins from sham-operated rats and MCAO-operated
rats after three days of reperfusion. We found that the band for
pS292 MeCP2 (approximately 77 kD) was only detected in the
cytoplasmic component and could be abolished upon phosphatase treatment (Fig. 1C), proving that the antibody against pS292
MeCP2 speciﬁcally recognized phosphorylated MeCP2. On the
contrary, the band for MeCP2 (approximately 75 kD) was detected
only in the nuclear component (Fig. 1C) and was not affected by
phosphatase. Furthermore, the expression of pS292 MeCP2
increased gradually with prolongation in the reperfusion time,
showing a low level of pS292 MeCP2 in the sham-operated
striatum and a marked increase in the level of pS292 MeCP2 in
the ischemia-injured striatum after three days of reperfusion
(Fig. 1D and E). Moreover, the expression of pS292 MeCP2 rose
further 14 days after MCAO, indicating a potential role for pS292
MeCP2 in both the acute and chronic periods of stroke. In

contrast, the level of MeCP2 in the nuclear component did not
change signiﬁcantly (Fig. 1D and F), implying an alternative role
of MeCP2 after phosphorylation modiﬁcation.

2.2.
Ischemic stroke induced astrocytic-speciﬁc expression
of pS292 MeCP2 in the infarct striatum
Because MeCP2 and pS292 MeCP2 showed disparate features
by expressive variation and intracellular localization, we then
investigated their cellular type distribution in the ischemic
striatum. Immunoﬂuorescent triple staining of MeCP2 or
pS292 MeCP2 with GFAP and NeuN combined with confocal
scanning was performed in the rat striatum three days after
MCAO to reveal the distributional characteristics of MeCP2
and pS292 MeCP2 in astrocytes and neurons. We found that
MeCP2 and pS292 MeCP2 can be expressed in both neurons
and astrocytes in the rat striatum (Fig. 2). In particular, the
pS292 MeCP2 immunoreactivity in neurons (pS292þ–NeuNþ,
Fig. 2A and B) was much lower than that of neuronal MeCP2
(MeCP2þ–NeuNþ, Fig. 2C and D), and both of these were not

Immunoﬂuorescent triple staining of MeCP2 or pS292 MeCP2 (red) with GFAP (green) and NeuN (blue) was performed to
determine the expressive features of MeCP2 and pS292 MeCP2 in both astrocytes and neurons three days after stroke. The
level of pS292 MeCP2 surged in astrocytes after ischemia (A) and (B), whereas MeCP2 was primarily found in the neuronal
nucleus in both the sham and MCAO groups (C) and (D). The white arrowheads and arrows indicate pS292þ–GFAPþ cells and
MeCP2þ–GFAPþ cells, respectively. Scale bars: 50 μm.
altered signiﬁcantly following MCAO injury. However, as in
astrocytes, the pS292 MeCP2 immunoreactivity exhibited a
marked increase in the amount and intensity after ischemia
(pS292þ–GFAPþ, white arrowheads in Fig. 2A and B), becoming
boosted in astrocytic processes and cell bodies in the ipsilateral striatum. In addition, the MeCP2 expression in astrocytes
was also enhanced following stroke (MeCP2þ–GFAPþ, white
arrows in Fig. 2C and D), with a dominant localization in the
nuclear region in both the sham and MCAO groups. These
results demonstrate that astrocytes are more susceptible to
stroke injury through the accumulation of pS292 MeCP2 and
MeCP2 than neurons, and pS292 MeCP2 may play a more
speciﬁc role in astrocytes than MeCP2.

2.3.
Ischemia-induced accumulation of pS292 MeCP2
in reactive astrocytes correlated with the upregulation
of astrocytic VEGF in the striatum
Because pS292 MeCP2 is predominantly expressed and surged in
astrocytes of the ischemic striatum, it is interesting to investigate
the features of these pS292-positive astrocytes. Because astrocytes were reactivated acutely after stroke (Kaur et al., 2006), we
aimed to explore the correlation between pS292 MeCP2

expression and astrocytic reactivation through the immunoﬂuorescent triple staining of pS292, GFAP and nestin in the ischemic
striatum three days after MCAO (Fig. 1B). It is obvious that
nestin-positive reactive astrocytes (GFAPþ–nestinþ) were markedly increased in the MCAO group compared with sham group
(Fig. 3A, B and E, indicated by white triangles), which is
consistent with previous ﬁndings (Kaur et al., 2006). Moreover,
the number of pS292-positive astrocytes also increased signiﬁcantly after stroke (Fig. 3A, B and E, indicated by white asterisks).
Importantly, the pS292-expressing reactive astrocytes (pS292þ–
GFAPþ–nestinþ) in the MCAO group were also found in a greater
quantity than those in the sham group (Fig. 3A, B and E,
indicated by white arrowheads), and approximately 84% of
pS292þ–GFAPþ cells expressed nestin in the ischemic striatum
(Fig. 3E), displaying an accumulation of pS292 MeCP2 in strokeinduced reactive astrocytes.
It has been reported that hypoxia can upregulate VEGF
expression in astrocytes (Ijichi et al., 1995). On this basis, we
asked whether the ischemia-induced expression of astrocytic
pS292 MeCP2 was correlated with that of VEGF. We conducted a
immunoﬂuorescent triple staining of pS292, GFAP and VEGF three
and 14 days after MCAO and found that the number of GFAPþ–
VEGFþ cells was increased signiﬁcantly after stroke injury (Fig. 3C,

36

Fig. 3 – Ischemia-induced expression of pS292 MeCP2 in reactive astrocytes correlated with the upregulation of astrocytic
VEGF in the ipsilateral striatum of MCAO. Confocal imaging showed that astrocytes were reactivated to express nestin and
pS292 MeCP2 (A) and (B) and that astrocytic pS292 MeCP2 could be co-localized with VEGF after three days of reperfusion (C)
and (D). The white arrowheads and arrows indicate pS292þ–GFAPþ–nestinþ cells and pS292þ–GFAPþ–VEGFþ cells,
respectively. The white triangles and asterisks mark GFAPþ–nestinþ and pS292þ–GFAPþ cells, respectively. The quantiﬁcation
of pS292þ–GFAPþ cells, GFAPþ–nestinþ cells and pS292þ–GFAPþ–nestinþ cells is indicated in (E), and the quantiﬁcation of
GFAPþ–VEGFþ cells and pS292þ–GFAPþ–VEGFþ cells is shown in (F). Scale bars: 50 μm in (A)–(D). The data present the

D and F), illustrating an augmentation of VEGF in astrocytes in the
ischemic striatum. Moreover, the quantiﬁcation of the triplelabeled cells in both the sham and MCAO groups also showed a
marked increase in pS292þ–GFAPþ–VEGFþ cells (white arrows in

Fig. 3C, D and F) in the ipsilateral striatum after three and 14 days
of reperfusion, suggesting that the stroke-induced accumulation
of pS292 MeCP2 in astrocytes was correlated with the upregulation of astrocytic VEGF in the ischemic brain.

brain research 1599 (2015) 32–43

2.4.
VEGF overproduction increased the expression
of pS292 MeCP2 in the ischemic striatum
Because the ischemia-induced expression of astrocytic pS292
MeCP2 was relevant to the upregulation of endogenous VEGF
in astrocytes in the infarct striatum, we asked whether the
exogenous overproduction of VEGF can affect pS292 MeCP2
expression in the stroke-injured brain. Therefore, we stereotaxically injected phVEGF into the rat ipsilateral lateral
ventricle immediately after MCAO and detected the level of
pS292 MeCP2 in the ischemic striatum by western blot and
immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1A and B). First, exogenous VEGF
(EGFP–VEGF) was observed only in the ipsilateral striatum of
the phVEGF group rather than in that of the pEGFP group,
indicating the successful introduction of exogenous VEGF into

37

the ischemia-injured striatum (Fig. 4A). Moreover, we found
that the expression of cytoplasmic pS292 MeCP2 exhibited a
signiﬁcant increase after phVEGF treatment three and 14 days
after MCAO, but the level of MeCP2 in the nuclear extractions
was not markedly affected by exogenous VEGF after three days
and reduced slightly after 14 days of reperfusion (Fig. 4A and B).
These results demonstrate that pS292 MeCP2 is more susceptible to VEGF signals than MeCP2, implicating a ﬁne-regulated
epigenetic pathway induced by VEGF in the ischemic striatum.
The quantiﬁcation of pS292-positive cells was then derived
through the immunohistochemical single staining of pS292
MeCP2 after three and 14 days of reperfusion (Figs. 1B and
4C–G). The results showed that VEGF overexpression induced a
marked increase in the number of pS292-positive cells in the
ischemic striatum, and there were even more positive cells

Fig. 4 – VEGF overproduction promoted the expression of pS292 MeCP2 in the ipsilateral striatum of rat brain post ischemia.
Western blot analysis showed that endogenous VEGF was detected in all of the groups, but exogenous VEGF (EGFP–VEGF)
appeared only in the phVEGF group (A). The level of pS292 MeCP2 in the cytoplasm was markedly increased after phVEGF
treatment, whereas the MeCP2 level in the nucleus showed no signiﬁcant change after both three and 14 days of reperfusion
(B). Immunohistochemical photographs and statistical analysis of pS292 MeCP2-positive cells in the ipsilateral striatum of the
pEGFP or phVEGF group after three and 14 days of reperfusion are shown in (C)–(F) and (G), respectively. The data present the
means7SEM (n¼ 5 at each time point in each group). Scale bars: 100 μm in (C)–(F). nPo0.05 compared with the pEGFP group.

38

brain research 1599 (2015) 32–43

after 14 days than after three days of reperfusion (Fig. 4G),
suggesting that the effect of VEGF on the induction of pS292
MeCP2 could last at least two weeks. Notably, a majority of the
pS292-positive cells possessed an astrocyte-like morphology in
the ipsilateral striatum in both the pEGFP and phVEGF groups
(Fig. 4C–F), implying that VEGF overexpression post MCAO
might not signiﬁcantly change the cellular type distribution of
pS292 MeCP2. Taken together, these results demonstrated that
VEGF overproduction can enhance the expression of pS292
MeCP2 in the stroke-injured striatum, likely in an astrocytemediated manner.

2.5.
VEGF overproduction enhanced the accumulation of
pS292 MeCP2 in reactive astrocytes in the ischemic striatum
A previous study showed that exogenous VEGF application
can promote astrocytic reactivation in vitro (Mani et al., 2005).
In this study, because most pS292-positive cells manifested
an astrocytic-like appearance after phVEGF treatment (Fig. 4D
and F), we asked whether VEGF enhanced pS292 MeCP2
expression in a reactive astrocyte-mediated manner. Therefore, we performed a immunoﬂuorescent triple staining of
pS292, GFAP and nestin three days after MCAO with phVEGF

or pEGFP treatment and found that the number of nestinpositive reactive astrocytes (GFAPþ–nestinþ) was markedly
increased by exogenous VEGF in the ischemic striatum
(Fig. 5A–C), which is consistent with previous ﬁndings (Mani
et al., 2005). Moreover, the numbers of pS292-expressive
astrocytes (pS292þ–GFAPþ) and pS292-expressive reactive
astrocytes (pS292þ–GFAPþ–nestinþ) were also upregulated
signiﬁcantly after VEGF overproduction (Fig. 5A–C). Importantly, approximately 88% of the pS292-positive astrocytes in
the phVEGF group expressed nestin (Fig. 5C), indicating that
astrocytic-derived pS292 MeCP2 was largely accumulated in
reactive astrocytes following VEGF treatment. Taken
together, these results demonstrated that the exogenous
overproduction of VEGF enhanced the accumulation of
pS292 MeCP2 in reactive astrocytes in the stroke-injured
striatum, providing us an epigenetic-related perspective on
the role of exogenous VEGF in stroke-prompted reactive
astrocytes in the ischemic brain.

Discussion

In the present study, we innovatively revealed that pS292
MeCP2, a cytoplasmic protein, was induced in nestin-positive

Fig. 5 – VEGF overproduction enhanced the accumulation of pS292 MeCP2 in reactive astrocytes in the ischemia-injured

confocal scanning was performed after three days of reperfusion (A and B). Quantiﬁcation of pS292þ–GFAPþ cells, GFAPþ–

reactive astrocytes after ischemia and that this effect was
accompanied by the upregulation of astrocytic VEGF in the
ipsilateral striatum. Moreover, the overproduction of exogenous
VEGF could further enhance the expression of pS292 MeCP2 in
the ischemic striatum and increase the number of pS292expressive reactive astrocytes signiﬁcantly, indicating a pS292
MeCP2-associated epigenetic role of exogenous VEGF in reactive
astrocytes in the MCAO-injured striatum. In contrast, nuclearlocalized MeCP2 exhibited no marked alteration after MCAO
operation and VEGF overexpression, even though astrocytic
MeCP2 appeared to be somehow induced on the periphery of
the infarct striatum. Our results provide the ﬁrst evidence that
the phosphorylation of MeCP2 at S292 is promoted in reactive
astrocytes following cerebral ischemia and VEGF overproduction, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms may be involved
in the modulation of reactive astrocyte function and in the
VEGF signal pathway in the ischemic brain.
MeCP2 is a crucial transcriptional modulator in the brain,
and its aberrant expression and dysfunction cause the neurological disorder Rett syndrome (RTT) (Hagberg et al., 1983).
Studies have shown that both Mecp2-null mice and Mecp2transgenic mice possess the characteristics of RTT (Collins
et al., 2004; Guy et al., 2001) and that MeCP2 deﬁciency results
in global changes in the neuronal chromatin structure (Skene
et al., 2010), indicating that the accurate level of MeCP2 is
vital to normal brain development and neuronal functions. In
consideration of our ﬁndings that MeCP2, particularly neuronal MeCP2, was not changed signiﬁcantly after MCAO surgery
and phVEGF treatment (Figs. 1, 2 and 4), the results suggest
that the level of MeCP2 in the nucleus was present in a basal
and relatively constant amount in neurons and is not acutely
affected after a brief period of MCAO with mild overexpression of VEGF. Nevertheless, the elucidation of the impact of
prolonged ischemia on the expression of MeCP2 may uncover
the differential variability of MeCP2 in the stroke-injured
brain. Notably, a previous study has observed increased
MeCP2 level in CA1 and CA3 at 24 h but not at 3, 6 and 12 h
of reperfusion in the global ischemic rat brain (Jung et al.,
2002), indicating that the response of MeCP2 to the cerebral
insult may be varied depending on the damaged brain
regions and the types of ischemia. In contrast, phosphorylation modiﬁcation at different serine sites, such as pS421,
pS229 and pS80, can actually modulate the function of MeCP2
in the brain (Gonzales et al., 2012; Tao et al., 2009; Zhou et al.,
2006). On this basis, the enhanced phosphorylation of MeCP2
at S292 after stroke and VEGF overproduction (Figs. 1 and 4)
may signify an effective and economic strategy to modulate
the function of MeCP2 in the ischemic brain, the mechanisms
of which need to be veriﬁed in future studies.
The signiﬁcance of MeCP2 in the ischemic brain has been
investigated in several studies. It has been shown that preconditioning ischemia induces a rapid rise in MeCP2 protein,
and MeCP2 deﬁciency increases the susceptibility of neuronal
networks to hypoxia and the magnitude of cell death (Fischer
et al., 2009; Lusardi et al., 2009; Russell et al., 2007), suggesting a
positive role of MeCP2 in the ischemic brain. However, there are
also reports showing that MeCP2 is involved in the repression of
male-derived estrogen receptor gene and AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 gene, the expression of which are beneﬁcial for
cerebral recovery, and exerts adverse effects on the ischemic

39

brain (Noh et al., 2012; Westberry et al., 2008). Consistently,
studies on Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease also
exhibit a detrimental role of MeCP2 in the injured brain (Bie
et al., 2014; McFarland et al., 2013). These results indicate that
the function of MeCP2 in the injured brain is complex and may
be varied according to its speciﬁc targets and the animal
models. Further investigations are still required to illuminate
the accurate role of MeCP2 in the injured brain.
To date, most studies considered MeCP2 and phosphorylated MeCP2 as nucleoproteins (Cohen et al., 2011; Gonzales
et al., 2012; Mnatzakanian et al., 2004), although a previous
research study showed that MeCP2 can be repositioned from
the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon neuronal differentiation by
introducing dephosphorylation on serine sites (Miyake and
Nagai, 2007). In accordance with this ﬁnding, we found that
pS292 MeCP2 is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, whereas
MeCP2 was found in the nucleus in both the sham- and MCAOoperated striatum (Figs. 1 and 2), suggesting a distinctive role of
pS292 MeCP2 in cytoplasmic-related events. Moreover, recent
studies report the detection of MeCP2 in glia, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia, and show that an
accurate level of MeCP2 in glia is critical to the normal
development of glia and neurons in the vicinity (Ballas et al.,
2009; Lioy et al., 2011; Maezawa et al., 2009). Consistently, we
also observed MeCP2 signals in astrocytes, the intensity of
which was much weaker than that in neurons (Fig. 2C and D).
In contrast, pS292 MeCP2 was predominantly expressed and
increased in astrocytes after stroke (Figs. 2 and 3), suggesting
that pS292 MeCP2 may function as an astrocyte-speciﬁc modulator in the stroke-injured striatum.
Astrocytes are reactivated after brain insults with the
enhanced expression of nestin, a marker for NSCs (Pekny and
Nilsson, 2005). Numerous studies have demonstrated that
reactive astrocytes can protect CNS cells and tissues in different
manners (Hamby and Sofroniew, 2010). Several exhilarating
studies show that reactive astrocytes acquire stem cell properties following injury and can be transdifferentiated into neurons in the ischemic brain or via neurogenic transcription factor
overexpression (Berninger et al., 2007; Buffo et al., 2008;
Magnusson et al., 2014), offering a neurogenesis-related prospect on the protective role of reactive astrocytes. In the present
study, we also found that nestin expression was induced in
astrocytes after MCAO (GFAPþ–nestinþ, Fig. 3A, B and E),
reﬂecting an ischemia-evoked reactivation of astrocytes, in
accordance with previous ﬁndings (Kaur et al., 2006). Importantly, we found that astrocytic pS292 MeCP2 (pS292þ–GFAPþ,
Fig. 3E) was predominantly accumulated in reactive astrocytes
in the infarct striatum (pS292þ––GFAPþ–nestinþ, Fig. 3E), indicating a potential role of pS292 MeCP2 in ischemia-induced
reactive astrocytes. A previous research study has proved that
MeCP2 can determine the differential fate of NSCs: the overexpression of MeCP2 induces the differentiation of NSCs into
neurons and blocks their differentiation into astrocytes
(Tsujimura et al., 2009). On this basis and due to the stem cell
properties of reactive astrocytes (Buffo et al., 2008), it is possible
that pS292 MeCP2 may be involved in the differential potential
modulation of nestin-positive reactive astrocytes in the strokeinjured brain. Further exploration in the animal model with
abolishment of astrocytic pS292 MeCP2 will be needed to reveal
the function of pS292 MeCP2 in reactive astrocytes.

VEGF was originally recognized as an angiogenic factor with a
role in increasing vascular permeability (Merrill and Oldﬁeld,
2005). However, the effect of exogenous VEGF in the ischemic
brain is complicated. Generally, systematic delivery of VEGF
during the acute injury phase usually contributes to BBB disruption, edema and inﬂammation (Ma et al., 2012; Zhang et al.,
2000), whereas topical application of VEGF is much more
protective by decreasing brain edema and improving functional
recovery in the chronic period of ischemic stroke (Hayashi et al.,
1998; Kaya et al., 2005). In this study, we infused human VEGF
expressive plasmid (phVEGF) into the lateral ventricle as we
previously described (Fig. 1B) (Wang et al., 2007). It has been
demonstrated that the plasmid-mediated expression of exogenous VEGF is time-dependently increased in the ipsilateral striatum and reaches a maximum level until 3 days after the
injection. Moreover, the local and relatively late-onset overproduction of VEGF is beneﬁcial to the ischemic brain via
decreasing infarct volume and promoting neurogenesis (Wang
et al., 2007), indicating that the protective effects of VEGF was
predominant at three and 14 days of reperfusion in our present
study. On the other hand, it is known that VEGF is physiologically expressed in astrocytes, and its level can even be upregulated after hypoxia (Kaur et al., 2006; Shin et al., 2010). Moreover,
the exogenous application of VEGF promotes the expression of
GFAP and nestin in cultured astrocytes (Mani et al., 2005),
pointing to an essential role of VEGF in astrocyte reactivation.
Consistently, we also found an enhancement of VEGF expression
in astrocytes after ischemia (GFAPþ–VEGFþ, Fig. 3C, D and F) and
the simultaneous promotion of the reactivation of astrocytes
(GFAPþ–nestinþ, Fig. 3A, B and E), and VEGF overexpression
further induced the emergence of nestin-positive reactive astrocytes in the MCAO-injured brain (Fig. 5), revealing a functional
effect of VEGF on astrocyte reactivation in pathological conditions. Importantly, we discovered an obvious co-localization of
pS292 MeCP2 and VEGF in astrocytes following stroke (pS292þ–
GFAPþ–VEGFþ, Fig. 3C, D and F), and the overproduction of
exogenous VEGF further triggered a marked increase in pS292positive reactive astrocytes in the infarct brain (pS292þ–GFAPþ–
nestinþ, Figs. 4C–G and 5), indicating that VEGF plays a pS292
MeCP2-associated epigenetic role in reactive astrocytes after
ischemia, although the exact mechanisms remains unclear.
The ﬁndings that reactive astrocytes possess features of NSCs
and VEGF enhances striatal neurogenesis post cerebral stroke
(Berninger et al., 2007; Buffo et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007) and
that MeCP2 has a modulatory effect on NSC differentiation
(Tsujimura et al., 2009) raise the possibility of reactive
astrocyte-derived neurogenesis via a VEGF-enhanced pS292
MeCP2 pathway in the stroke-injured brain. Further investigations still need to be conducted to explicate the exact function of
pS292 MeCP2 in astrocytes following MCAO injury and VEGF
overexpression, and the results of these will provide insights into
the characteristics of reactive astrocytes in the ischemic brain
from a pS292 MeCP2-mediated epigenetic point of view.
Taken together, the results allow us to conclude that cytoplasmic pS292 MeCP2 is accumulated in nestin-positive reactive
astrocytes in the ischemic striatum and that this effect is
accompanied by the prompted co-localization of pS292 MeCP2
and VEGF in astrocytes. Moreover, VEGF overproduction further
enhances the expression of pS292 MeCP2 in the ischemic
striatum and markedly increases the number of pS292-

expressive reactive astrocytes. In contrast, nuclear MeCP2 is
predominantly expressed in neurons, and its level is not altered
signiﬁcantly after MCAO injury and VEGF overproduction. Our
data suggest that the exogenously delivered VEGF is involved in
the modulation of epigenetic circumstances of reactive astrocytes following cerebral ischemia, providing a pS292 MeCP2related epigenetic perspective on the characteristics of reactive
astrocytes and the function of VEGF in the stroke-injured brain.

Experimental procedures

4.1.

Animal experimental protocols

4.1.1.

Animals

Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (220–250 g) from Shanghai
Experimental Animal Center (Chinese Academy of Sciences)
were used in the following experiments. According to the
duration of reperfusion, the animals were randomly divided
into the sham group, the MCAO 3-day group and the MCAO
14-day group (for each group, n ¼4 for western blot analysis
and n¼ 3 for immunoﬂuorescence). Based on the reperfusion
time and the injected plasmid, the animals were divided into
the MCAO 3-day with pEGFP group, the MCAO 3-day with
phVEGF group, the MCAO 14-day with pEGFP group and the
MCAO 14-day with phVEGF group (n ¼5 for each group).
The study was conducted in accordance with the National
Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals, and the protocols were approved by the Medical
Experimental Animal Administrative Committee of Shanghai.
All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and
reduce the number of animals used.

4.1.2.

Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)

The rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (360 mg/kg,
i.p.), and arterial blood samples obtained with a femoral catheter
were collected to measure the pO2, pCO2 and pH with an AVL 990
Blood Gas Analyzer (AVL Co., Graz, Austria). The rectal temperature was maintained at 3770.5 1C during surgery via a
temperature-regulated heating lamp (Wang et al., 2007). The rats
with physiological variables in the normal ranges were subjected
to transient focal cerebral ischemia induced by left MCAO as
previously described (Longa et al., 1989). Brieﬂy, a 4-0 nylon
monoﬁlament suture was gently advanced into the internal
carotid artery for a distance of approximately 22 mm from the
common carotid artery bifurcation to occlude the MCA blood
ﬂow. During the process of ischemia, we used a Laser Doppler
perfusion monitor (Periﬂux system 5000, Terimed AB, Sweden) to
synchronously detect the blood ﬂow in the trunk of MCA. Blood
ﬂow decreased to o20% of the baseline denoted that the block of
MCA was successful. After 30-min occlusion, the suture was
withdrawn, and the blood ﬂow was restored. The rats were then
subjected to plasmid injection.

4.1.3.

Plasmid administration

The complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) encoding
human VEGF (165) was inserted into the pEGFP-N1 plasmid
(Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) between the constitutively
active cytomegalovirus promoter (pCMV) and the enhanced
green ﬂuorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene, which was

brain research 1599 (2015) 32–43

denoted phVEGF. The pEGFP-N1 plasmid was used as the
control (pEGFP). Following MCAO, the rats were randomly
divided into the phVEGF (pEGFP-N1-VEGF plasmid) and pEGFP
control (pEGFP-N1 empty plasmid) groups. The plasmid
mixture, which consisted of 5 μg per 2 μl of plasmid, and 1 μl
of lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were
stereotaxically delivered into the ipsilateral lateral ventricle
(coordinates from Bregma: AP – 0.8 mm, ML – 1.4 mm, DV –
3.6 mm from the pia matter surface). After recovering from
anesthesia, the rats were returned to their cages and given ad
libitum access to food and water.

4.2.

Western blot analysis

4.2.1.

Sample preparation

The cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were separated with a
Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit (Beyotime
Institute of Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. In brief, fresh isolated striatum
was cut into small pieces and homogenized in the mixture of
A and B solutions at a ratio of 20 to 1 with 1 mM PMSF. After
incubating on ice for 15 min, the cytoplasmic lysates were
obtained after centrifugation at 1500g for 5 min. Twohundred microliters of A solution containing 1 mM PMSF
was added per 20 μl of the precipitates, and the mixture
was then subjected to violent vortexing. After incubation in
an ice bath for 15 min, 10 μl of B solution was added, and the
mixture was subjected to violent vortex and incubated in an
ice bath for 1 min. After removing the supernatant by centrifugation, the precipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of C
solution with 1 mM PMSF, incubated on ice for 30 min and
subjected to vortex for 30 s every 2 min during an ice bath.
The nuclear proteins were obtained after centrifugation at
16,000g for 10 min. The protein concentration was measured
with a BCA protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Beyotime).

4.2.2.

Phosphatase treatment

The protein lysates were suspended in 1  NE Buffer (New
England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) at the ratio of 20 μl buffer
per microgram of protein. Alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) was then added to the mixture, and the mixture
was then incubated at 37 1C for 30 min. The proteins were
then deposited in cold acetone at –20 1C overnight. After
centrifugation, the puriﬁed proteins were obtained and resuspended in 1  loading buffer for subsequent immunoblotting
analysis.

4.2.3.

Immunoblotting

Equal amounts of the protein lysates were separated on 12%
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
(PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, CA, USA). The membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-pS292
MeCP2 antibody (1:1000; US Biological, Swampscott, MA,
USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-MeCP2 antibody (1:1000; Merck
Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-VEGF
antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA), mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1:4000; KangChen Bio-tech, Shanghai, China), mouse monoclonal anti-β-

41

actin antibody (1:10,000; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or
rabbit polyclonal anti-H3 antibody (1:3000; Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) at 4 1C overnight and then
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG
(1:3000; Santa Cruz) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
anti-mouse IgG (1:3000, Santa Cruz) at room temperature
for 60 min. The immunoreactivity was visualized with an
enhanced chemiluminescence substrate system (Santa Cruz)
and Kodak X-OMAT ﬁlm. Normalization was achieved by
stripping ﬁlters and reprobing for β-actin or H3.

4.3.

Histological analysis

4.3.1.

Tissue preparation

The animals were deeply anesthetized and quickly subjected
to transcardial perfusion with freshly prepared 0.9%
saline solution followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in
phosphate-buffer solution (0.1 M, pH 7.4, PBS). The brains
were post-ﬁxed in 4% PFA overnight and immersed sequentially in 20% and 30% sucrose solutions in 0.1 M PBS for
dehydration. The coronal sections were then collected on a
freezing microtome (Jung Histocut, Model 820-II, Leica, Germany) at a thickness of 30 μm and Bregma levels ranging
from 1.60 to  4.80 mm and stored at  20 1C in cryoprotectant solution for further histological analysis.

4.3.2.

Immunohistochemical staining

Free-ﬂoating sections were ﬁrst treated with 0.3% H2O2 for
30 min. After incubation with 0.01 M trisodium citrate solution
(pH 6.0) at 97.9 1C for 12 min, the sections were rinsed in 0.01 M
PBS for 15 min, blocked with 10% goat serum for 1 h at 37 1C
and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-pS292 MeCP2
antibody (1:100) at 4 1C overnight. After washing, the sections
were incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Vector
Laboratories Inc, Burlingame, CA, USA) and then with avidinbiotin-peroxidase (1:200; Vector) at 37 1C for 1 h, respectively.
The immunoreactivity was visualized by 0.05% diaminobenzidine (DAB) (Sigma) as a chromogen. The controls received an
identical treatment with the exception of the omission of
primary antibody and showed no speciﬁc staining.

4.3.3.

Immunoﬂuorescence and confocal microscopy

For immunoﬂuorescent triple staining, four different antibody combinations were indicated as follows: (1) rabbit
polyclonal anti-pS292 MeCP2 (1:50), goat polyclonal antiGFAP (1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and mouse monoclonal
anti-NeuN (1:500; Millipore); (2) rabbit polyclonal anti-MeCP2
(1:100), goat polyclonal anti-GFAP (1:100) and mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN (1:500); (3) rabbit polyclonal anti-pS292
MeCP2 (1:50), goat polyclonal anti-GFAP (1:100) and rat monoclonal anti-nestin (1:1000; BD Pharmingen, NJ, USA); and (4)
rabbit polyclonal anti-pS292 MeCP2 (1:50), goat polyclonal
anti-GFAP (1:100) and mouse monoclonal anti-VEGF (1:100;
Millipore). The sections were ﬁrst incubated with rabbit antipS292 MeCP2 or MeCP2 antibody overnight at 4 1C. After
rinsing in PBS, the sections were incubated with rabbit antiIgG-Rhodamine (1:500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37 1C
for 1 h. After washing, the sections were then incubated
with goat anti-GFAP antibody overnight at 4 1C and then
with goat anti-IgG-FITC (1:500; Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 1C.

42

brain research 1599 (2015) 32–43

Afterward, the sections were incubated with mouse antiNeuN, anti-nestin or anti-VEGF antibody overnight at 4 1C
and then with mouse anti-IgG-Cy5 (1:200; Abcam) for 1 h at
37 1C. Finally, the sections were mounted on slides and
coverslipped with ﬂuorescence mounting media (Vector).
The ﬂuorescent signals were detected at excitation and
emission wavelengths of 535 nm and 565 nm (Rhodamine),
488 nm and 525 nm (FITC), and 561 nm and 633 nm (Cy5),
respectively, by confocal laser scanning microscopy (TCS SP5,
Leica, Germany).

4.4.

Data quantiﬁcation and statistical analysis

For the western blot analysis, the immunostained bands were
scanned and analyzed by subsequently measuring the optical
densities using an image processing and analysis system (ImageJ
1.37 software, NIH, USA). For immunohistochemical and immunoﬂuorescent staining, the cell counting procedure was carried
out by an unbiased observer blinded to the experimental treatments. In this research, immunohistochemical and immunoﬂuorescent staining were performed on the adjacent coronal
sections and cells were counted in a single 30 μm section per rat
(about þ0.48 mm from the Bregma) as we previously described
(Chen and Sun, 2007). GFAP immunoreactivity was used as a
reference to assess the infarct border (Ringer et al., 2001). Four
nonoverlapping images (with a ﬁxed thickness of 20 μm for
confocal pictures) were acquired along the lateral ventricle wall
of the infract striatum at a distance of about 50 μm from the wall
into the parenchyma as previously described (Pforte et al., 2005).
The counting frame sizes were 385 μm  385 μm for immunoﬂuorescent analysis under a 40  object lens of a confocal
microscope (TCS SP5, Leica, Germany) and 441 μm  330 μm for
immunohistochemical analysis under a 20  object lens of a
light microscope (DMI6000B, Leica, Germany). Cells were considered double-labeled or triple-labeled when co-labeling immunoreactivity was observed in x–y cross section, as well as in x–z
and y–z cross-sections. The total number of positive cells in each
image was counted manually in each square of view and
averaged for each section and then for each group. The ﬁnal
results were expressed as cells/mm2.
SPSS 13.0 was applied for the statistical analyses. All of the
values are expressed as the means7standard error of the
means (SEM). One-way ANOVA followed by Student's t-test
was used for the statistical evaluations among the three groups.
Unpaired Student's t-test was used for the statistical evaluation
between two groups. A statistically signiﬁcant difference was
set at Po0.05.
