Abstract
Exendin-4 is a glucagon-like receptor 1 agonist clinically used against type 2 diabetes that has also shown neuroprotective
effects in experimental stroke models. However, while the neuroprotective efficacy of Exendin-4 has been thoroughly
investigated if the pharmacological treatment starts before stroke, the therapeutic potential of the Exendin-4 if the
treatment starts acutely after stroke has not been clearly determined. Further, a comparison of the neuroprotective efficacy
in normal and aged diabetic mice has not been performed. Finally, the cellular mechanisms behind the efficacy of Exendin-4
have been only partially studied. The main objective of this study was to determine the neuroprotective efficacy of Exendin4 in normal and aged type 2 diabetic mice if the treatment started after stroke in a clinically relevant setting. Furthermore
we characterized the Exendin-4 effects on stroke-induced neuroinflammation. Two-month-old healthy and 14-month-old
type 2 diabetic/obese mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion. 5 or 50 mg/kg Exendin-4 was administered
intraperitoneally at 1.5, 3 or 4.5 hours thereafter. The treatment was continued (0.2 mg/kg/day) for 1 week. The
neuroprotective efficacy was assessed by stroke volume measurement and stereological counting of NeuN-positive
neurons. Neuroinflammation was determined by gene expression analysis of M1/M2 microglia subtypes and proinflammatory cytokines. We show neuroprotective efficacy of 50 mg/kg Exendin-4 at 1.5 and 3 hours after stroke in both
young healthy and aged diabetic/obese mice. The 5 mg/kg dose was neuroprotective at 1.5 hour only. Proinflammatory
markers and M1 phenotype were not impacted by Exendin-4 treatment while M2 markers were significantly up regulated.
Our results support the use of Exendin-4 to reduce stroke-damage in the prehospital/early hospitalization setting
irrespectively of age/diabetes. The results indicate the polarization of microglia/macrophages towards the M2 reparative
phenotype as a potential mechanism of neuroprotection.

Study 2. Forty seven 2-month-old mice were treated with
50 mg/kg Ex-4 e i.p. at 1.5 (n = 13), 3 (n = 13) or 4.5 (n = 7) hours
after MCAO. Control mice (n = 14) were given vehicle injection
1.5 hours after MCAO. The treatment continued for 7 days as in
Study 1 (0.2 mg/kg Ex-4) until sacrifice.
Study 3. Twenty seven 2-month-old mice were exposed to
high-fat diet (HFD) (Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ) for
12 months to induce T2D/obesity. Body weight and blood glucose
levels were monitored throughout the experiment (see Fig. S1 in
file S1). At the end of the diet period, mice were subjected to stroke
and received 50 mg/kg Ex-4 i.p. at 1.5 (n = 9) or 3 hours (n = 9)
after MCAO. Control mice (n = 9) were given vehicle injection
1.5 hours after MCAO. The treatment continued for 7 days as in
Studies 1–2 until sacrifice.
Study 4 (inflammation study). Twenty-three 2-month old
mice were treated with 50 mg/kg Ex-4 (n = 12) or vehicle (n = 11)
i.p. at 1.5 hours after MCAO. The treatment continued for 3 days
with the Ex-4 dose of 0.2 mg/kg daily until sacrifice.
All experiments were conducted according to the "Guide for the

Institutes of Health (NIH publication # 85–23, revised 1985) and

doubles the risk of stroke recurrence and increases mortality
(reviewed in [2]).
Neuroprotective strategies aimed at decreasing brain damage
after stroke have failed to be translated into the clinical setting
along the past decades [3] [4,5]. Today, tissue plasminogen
activator (tPA) is the only established pharmacological treatment
that restores brain reperfusion [6]. However, only a low rate of
patients receives tPA due to delayed hospitalization and side effects
(e.g. intracerebral hemorrhage) [6,7]. As a consequence, there is a
large un-met medical need for novel stroke therapies.
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone
secreted from enteroendocrine L-cells following a meal [8].
GLP-1 enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion via a specific
G-protein-coupled GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) [8]. However, GLP1 has a very short half-life in the peripheral blood mainly due to
rapid enzymatic degradation [9]. Exendin-4 (Ex-4) is a synthetic
form of GLP-1, which is resistant to degradation. For these
properties, it has been developed in clinical use for the treatment
of T2D [10]. Besides its anti-diabetic properties, Ex-4 has been
shown to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) [11] in dosedependent manner and preclinical work supports a neuroprotective role of Ex-4 in animal models of neurological disorders
(reviewed in [12–14]). With regard to stroke, intracerebral
administration of Ex-4 before stroke resulted in neuroprotection
[15]. Furthermore, others and we have shown that peripheral
administration of Ex-4 before stroke induces neuroprotection [16–
19]_ENREF_21. Thus, strong experimental evidence indicates the
potential use of Ex-4 for the treatment of stroke in T2D patients or
individuals at high risk to suffer from a stroke (e.g. pretreatment
strategies). However, whether Ex-4 is neuroprotective when
administered acutely after stroke in a clinical relevant setting e.g.
few hours after stroke, has not been thoroughly investigated.
Furthermore, whether T2D and aging induce a differential
neuroprotective response to Ex-4 has not been studied. Finally
the molecular mechanisms at the basis of Ex-4 neuroprotection
have not been characterized.
Inflammation is a key mediator in brain damage after stroke
[20–23]. Microglia, the resident macrophage of the brain, plays a
central role in brain inflammation. Microglia/macrophages are
highly dynamic cells that can adapt different phenotypes
depending on the microenvironment, i.e. the classical proinflammatory M1 phenotype and the wound-healing reparative
M2 phenotype respectively [24]. After stroke there is an acute/
early polarisation towards the reparative M2 phenotype, however,
over time there is an increased polarisation towards the proinflamamtory M1 phenotype [25].
The aim of this study was to determine the potential efficacy of
Ex-4 against stroke in a clinically relevant post-stroke setting, in
both young and aged T2D/obese mice. Furthermore, we
determined whether Ex-4 has an effect on inflammatory markers
and the microglial phenotype.

Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
The intraluminal filament model of focal ischemia was used
[26]. Briefly, a silicon-coated monofilament was inserted into
internal carotid artery until the origin of MCA was occluded. The
filament was withdrawn after 30 minutes of occlusion. For all
experimental details of the MCAO method, see File S1.

Immunohistochemistry, infarct volume measurement
and neuronal quantifications
Brains were fixed with trans-cardial 4% paraformaldehyde
perfusion, sectioned using sliding microtome and immunohistochemically labeled for neuronal nuclear marker NeuN using
peroxidase substrate method. Nine consecutive 40 mm-thick
coronal sections spaced at 320 mm intervals along the rostracaudal axis starting approximately at 1.5 mm from bregma were
used for the stroke volume measurement and stereological
counting of surviving neurons (Fig. 1A). For details, see File S1.

Microglial cell culture and multiplex analysis
Primary microglia-enriched cultures were prepared from whole
brains of 2–3 day-old mice. See File S1 for details.

Results
neurons by stereological counting revealed a significant neuroprotective effect of Ex-4 treatment at 1.5 hours, but not at 3 hours
after MCAO (Fig. 2 B). The protective effect was localized
specifically in the striatum but not in cortex (Fig. 2 B, C).

kg/day. The results show that the stroke volume was not affected
(Fig. 2 A). However the neuronal loss was significantly reduced
at both 1.5 and 3 hours after- MCAO by the Ex-4 treatment
(Fig. 2 B). The protective effect of Ex-4 was lost when the
treatment was given at 4.5 hours after MCAO (Fig. 2 B). As in

respectively. Ischemia significantly increased M1 marker CD86 in
the injured ipsilateral hemisphere in both control and Ex-4-treated
mice (Fig. 5 A). However, expression of the M1 marker iNOS was
not altered (Fig. 5 A). The quantitative analysis of M2 markers,
revealed that CD206 and Arg1 were not significantly affected by
the ischemic brain damage, whereas YM1/2 was significantly up
regulated in the injured hemisphere (Fig. 5 B). Ex-4 treatment
significantly up regulated M2 markers CD206, Arg1 and YM1/2
in the injured hemisphere compared to the non-injured hemisphere (Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, CD206 expression in the injured,
Ex-4-treated hemisphere was significantly up regulated compared
to the injured control hemisphere (Fig. 5 B). A similar pattern was
also seen for Arg1 and YM1/2(Figure 4D–E). However this did
not reach statistical significance.

MCAO in aged T2D/obese mice
In Study 3 we determined the potential efficacy of Ex-4 in aged
14-month-old T2D/obese mice. A bolus of 50 mg/kg Ex-4 was
administered at 1.5 or 3 hours after MCAO. The Ex-4 treatment
was continued at 0.2 mg/kg/day for 1 week until sacrifice as in
studies 1–2. Similarly to 2-month-old healthy mice, Ex-4 showed
neuroprotective efficacy at both 1.5 and 3 hours after- MCAO
administration (Fig. 3 C). However, in contrast to the previous
experiments, the neuroprotective effect of Ex-4 was localized in
the cerebral cortex and not in striatum (Fig. 3 B, C). To show the
impact of MCAO on neuronal numbers in the striatum and
cortex, the number of neurons in the non-stroke contralateral
striatum and cortex are represented by the dashed line on Fig 3 B,
C.

Discussion
Several studies have shown that Ex-4 mediates neuroprotection
in animal models of stroke. These studies have demonstrated
proof-of-concept for Ex-4-mediated neuroprotection against
ischemic brain damage [15–19]. However, in these studies the
neuroprotective efficacy was achieved either by using strategies
based on pretreatment [16,17], or by using experimental
paradigms difficult to be translated to the clinical reality, e.g.
intracerebral administration [15,18]. Thus, the potential neuroprotective efficacy of Ex-4 if the pharmacological treatment starts
acutely after MCAO, which is a clinically relevant setting, has not
been extensively investigated. In clinical stroke, the intervention
time (rTPA) usually falls between 0.5 and 4 hours and the speed of
intervention has been positively correlated with favorable stroke
outcome [27–29]. The goal of our study was to evaluate the
efficacy time-window for Ex-4-mediated neuroprotection after the
stroke onset; hence we treated MCAO-subjected mice with Ex-4 at
1.5, 3 and 4.5 hours after MCAO. Interestingly, in one study,
Teramoto et al, showed that Ex-4 was neuroprotective if given
1 hour after MCAO (stroke volume was measured 24 hours after
stroke [19]). Under these conditions, the neuroprotective effect
was lost when Ex-4 was administered at 3 hours after MCAO. It
has to be noted that the Ex-4 dose used in this study (approx.
400 mg/kg) was far higher than the used clinical dose of Ex-4 to
treat T2D patients (0.1–0.2 mg/kg). In our study, we show that Ex4 mediates neuroprotection in both healthy and T2D/obese mice
by giving a bolus of 50 mg/kg Ex-4 from 1.5 or 3 hours after

The Ex-4 neuroprotective effect correlates with M2
microglial phenotype
In Study 4 we determined the gene expression of proinflammatory markers MCP-1, IL-1b and TNFa with and without
Ex-4 treatment following MCAO. Pro-inflammatory cytokines
MCP-1 and IL-1b were significantly up regulated in the injured
hemisphere following MCAO (Fig. 4). A similar pattern was seen
for TNFa albeit it did not reach statistical significance. Ex-4
treatment did not alter this pro-inflammatory pattern although a
not statistically significant trend towards the enhancement of
MCP-1 levels was observed in the ipsilateral hemisphere of Ex-4treated mice as compared to vehicle-treated group. In support,
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-1b and MCP-1 release from
microglia cell cultures was also not affected by Ex-4 treatment (Fig.
S2 in file S1) nor were any of the other cytokines or chemokines
measured in the multiplex assay (data not shown).
Microglia can polarize into different phenotypes depending on
the microenvironment (see introduction). To address the microglial phenotype, we quantified gene expression of M1 markers
iNOS and CD86, and M2 markers CD206, Arg1 an YM1/2,

MCAO and by continuing with the treatment for one week with
lower (clinical) dose of the drug (0.2 mg/kg). Furthermore, in
normal healthy mice we show that the lower dose of 5 mg/kg was
still efficacious at 1.5 hour after MCAO, although the effect was
lost at 3 hours. The discrepancy between our results and the study
by Teramoto et al at 3 hours are likely due to different methods of
stroke evaluation. The stroke volume measurement (used by
Teramoto et al) is a macro readout and does not account for
decreased neuronal density in peri-infarct areas while neuronal
count (used in our study) evaluates the whole brain structure

(Figure 1B). Indeed, the stroke volume measurements in both
studies did not detect neuroprotection by Ex-4 at 3 hours after
MCAO. In contrast to previously published studies where Ex-4
was given before or at the time of stroke, the Ex-4-mediated
reduction of the infarct volume in the present study was marginal
and the efficacy was mainly localized in the surrounding penumbra
tissue. These results are not surprising, considering that initial
excitotoxic cell death (the biggest contributor of tissue damage)
inside the ischemic core occurs within minutes after stroke. For
any neuroprotective therapy that is initiated few hours after stroke

by using stroke models with comorbidities as recommended by the
STAIR group [36]. Parallel studies in normal and T2D rodents
might reveal important information to understand both the
dynamics and the mechanisms of stroke, but also to choose the
most appropriate therapy.
The ultimate goal of any stroke intervention therapy is to
improve the functional outcome. However, the available mouse
stroke models present significant challenges for accurate functional
evaluation and current tests can unlikely detect neurological
function with enough sensitivity to identify the subtle effects of
neuroprotective treatments [37]. Li et al have reported that several
common functional tests failed to detect differences even between
sham and stroke-subjected mice several days after 90 minutes
MCAO. Furthermore, at 2 weeks after stroke, even the most
accurate tests at their disposal failed to recognize functional
differences between untreated mice and mice treated with estrogen
(well recognized neuroprotective substance) [37]. We have used 30
minutes of MCAO in our study and Ex-4 treatment resulted in
<25% increase in neuronal survival. Thus, we can only speculate
the functional benefits of such neuroprotection.
Despite the fact that neuroprotection by Ex-4 has been shown in
animal models of stroke, the mechanisms behind this neuroprotection remain elusive. In addition to direct neuroprotective effects
also supported by GLP-1R expression in neurons [38], the
regulation of inflammation has been suggested as one potential
mechanism since Ex-4 decreases the number of microglia after
stroke [16,18,19]. Furthermore, it has been shown that GLP-1
treatment decreases LPS-induced inflammation in astrocytes in
vitro [39]. Interestingly, the neuroprotective effect of Ex-4 in our
stroke model is not correlated to decreased inflammation, since
Ex-4 treatment did not alter gene expression of pro-inflammatory
cytokines. This observation was unexpected. However it is most
likely related to the differences in study design between this current
study and the ones previously published [16,18,19] where the Ex-4
treatment was initiated before or at the time of stroke and the
effect on stroke size was dramatic. It is plausible, that the
previously observed anti-inflammatory effects (reduced microglia
numbers) by Ex-4 were secondary to the reduced injury size,
rather than being a direct consequence of anti-inflammatory
effects of Ex-4. Our in vitro data further support this by showing
no effect of Ex-4 on LPS-induced inflammation in cultured
microglia. Similar to that shown after both spinal cord injury [40]
and focal cerebral ischemia [25], we found an increased expression
of both M1 and M2 markers 3 days after MCAO. Administration
of Ex-4 had no effect on the M1 markers. In contrast, Ex-4
increased the expression of M2 markers after MCAO. It has been
suggested that the microglial M2 phenotype has a reparative
function and could promote CNS repair [40]. Further, we have
previously shown that increased vulnerability after brain injury
was associated with a decrease in reparative M2 microglia [41].
The increased expression of M2 markers by Ex-4 indicates that
Ex-4 enhances the polarization towards the reparative M2
phenotype, suggesting a novel mechanism at the basis of the
neuroprotective efficacy mediated by Ex-4. This mechanism based
on M2 repair could also contribute to the larger therapeutic
window (till 3.5 hours) observed in our study in comparison to that
reported by Taramoto et al [19] (1 hour). In the latter study, the
mice received Ex-4 only once before being sacrificed 24 hours
thereafter. Vice versa, in our study we continued with daily
treatments of Ex-4 for several days, thus potentially maximizing
the Ex-4-mediated M2 reparative phenotype.
In conclusion, we show that Ex-4 mediates neuroprotection
against stroke in normal and aged T2D/obese mice. The results
were achieved by using a preclinical experimental paradigm with

the main target would be a relatively smaller population of
neurons localized within the ischemic penumbra. These neurons
are under the threat, but it is still possible to rescue them with a
proper intervention [30].
The most efficacious dose of Ex-4 in our study was a bolus of
50 mg/kg followed by daily injections of 0.2 mg/kg. Decreasing the
first bolus injection from 50 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg resulted already in
diminished efficacy. Since 0.2 mg/kg is the clinically used dose to
treat T2D clinically, it is unlikely that this dose will be within the
efficacy range for mediating neuroprotection after stroke. As a
consequence, a new evaluation for the safety of Ex-4 will be
needed to determine the safety/feasibility of higher Ex-4 doses to
stroke patients if such therapy will become a clinical option
Moreover in our results we clearly see the correlation between
the efficacy, the dose and the intervention time.
The major obstacles for the development of neuroprotective
stroke therapies depend upon how quickly neurons die: ‘‘time is
brain’’. Because of this, several preclinically successful candidate
drugs (used before/few minutes after stroke) have failed in clinical
trials once administered to patients several hours after stroke
[3,31,32]. Although it is difficult to exactly translate the
neuroprotective window of Ex-4 from mouse to human, our
results might have clinical relevance. However, since the protective
effect of Ex-4 was lost at 4.5 hours, we foresee the potential use of
Ex-4 for the treatment of stroke as early as possible after the
ischemic event, possibly already during the emergency transport.
Ex-4 is an antidiabetic drug that has been reported to show limited
side effects [33] and it is formulated for subcutaneous selfinjections. Thus, at least in theory, stroke patients should be able to
receive this treatment with minimal risks before hospitalization.
Many stroke patients have comorbidities and conditions such as
advanced age, hypertension, obesity and T2D. Often preclinical
efficacy studies are not performed in animals with such
comorbidities and this is likely another reason, in addition to
time, why preclinical neuroprotective strategies tested in young
healthy animals have failed in the clinic [31,32]. To determine
whether both aging and T2D could have an impact on the Ex-4
neuroprotective efficacy, we performed stroke experiments in aged
and T2D/obese mice. Our results showed no decrease in efficacy
by Ex-4 in aged T2D/obese versus adult healthy mice, suggesting
that this therapy has the potential to be extended to also aged and
diabetic patients. Although Ex-4 was efficacious in both normal
and aged T2D/obese mice, we observed a differential neuroprotective effect at the anatomical level between the two groups, e.g.
striatal in normal while cortical in T2D/obese mice. These
observations are difficult to interpret and are likely the results of
the combination of the effects of aging and T2D, which could alter
the outcome of MCAO. Indeed, in the striatum of young adult
mice, the ischemic damage was more pronounced as compared to
aged/T2D mice (Fig 2 B and fig 3 B, control groups). On the
contrary, in aged/T2D mice the cortical damage was more severe
as compared to adult healthy mice (Fig 2 C and Fig 3 C, control
groups). It is known, that diabetes can induce alterations in the
cerebral blood flow on microvascular level [34,35] and such
alterations could be behind the differential response to MCAO
between adult/healthy and aged/T2D mice. Although it is only
speculative, it is possible that a larger stroke in either brain areas
could produce a larger penumbra region in which the effect of Ex4 could be more readily detected as opposed to smaller ischemic
damaged areas. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has
employed both aged and T2D/obese mice to study stroke. Thus,
no comparison with previous work could be done. Overall, the
differential stroke outcome between normal and T2D/obese mice
underscores the importance to study stroke and potential therapies

potential relevance for the treatment of stroke patients in the
prehospital or early hospitalization settings. The results also suggest
that one of the contributing mechanisms at the basis of Ex-4
neuroprotection may be enhancing the reparative M2 phenotype.
