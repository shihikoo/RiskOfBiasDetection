Abstract While the previous studies have shown poloxamer
188 (P188)’s neuroprotection in cultured HT22 cells under
oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) insults, we investigated
whether P188 is a potential neuroprotective agent in primary
cortical neurons (PCNs) and in cerebral ischemia in vivo and
whether the possible underlying mechanisms correlate with
regulating mitochondrial membrane permeability (MMP)
and autophagy. The protective effects of P188 were tested in
PCNs in vitro exposed to OGD, as well as in cerebral ischemia
in vivo. Cell death and viability were detected with LDH and
MTT assay, and mitochondrial membrane potential was
assessed using fluorescence microscopy. The apoptosis and
autophagy of PCNs were investigated by expressions of cytc, caspase-3, light chain 3 (LC3), and Beclin-1. In addition, a
mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was
used to produce focal ischemia, and mice were treated with
P188 and rapamycin after MCAO 10 min. The infarct volume,
neurological scores, and phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) were evaluated. The in vitro results
showed that P188 prevented OGD-induced primary
cerebrocortical neuron death and inhibited loss of

mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of mitochondrial apoptogenic factor cytochrome c from mitochondria to
the cytoplasm, and activation of caspase-3. P188 suppressed
the activation of autophagy by decreasing LC3-II and Beclin1 levels under OGD accordingly. Moreover, the in vivo results
showed that P188 and rapamycin remarkably reduced the infarct volume and neurological deficits in the MCAO mouse
model of cerebral ischemia, respectively. Both P188 and
rapamycin induced phosphorylation of mTOR and reversed
the decreased level upon MCAO. These data indicate that
P188 prevents neuronal cell death resulting from ischemic
brain injury and that its neuroprotective effects are mediated
by preventing mitochondrial membrane integrity damage and
autophagic activation. Given that it has low toxicity, P188
might become a potential novel therapy for ischemic injury.

Introduction
Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the major
cause of disability worldwide (Donnan et al. 2008). Ischemic
stroke, the most common one, occurs when there is an acute
interruption of arterial blood flow to the brain. This cerebral
ischemia, caused by reduction in the supply of glucose and
oxygen to the brain, triggers a complex cascade of cellular
events, resulting in both acute and delayed cell death and
neurological dysfunction (Friedlander 2003). The loss in cell
membrane integrity, has recently been found to be a major
contributor to the development of neuronal damage subsequent to brain injury by leading to ionic imbalances and activation of several cellular pathways (Pettus et al. 1994), indicating that acute membrane damage due to ischemic damage
is a critical precipitating event.
Poloxamer 188 (P188) is a nonionic, nontoxic, biocompatible, amphiphilic copolymer, including a central hydrophobic
molecule that is flanked on both sides by two hydrophilic
chains of polyoxyethylene (Marks et al. 2001). In vivo delivery of P188 could repair injured (permeable) cells after controlled cortical impact (Mbye et al. 2012), spinal cord compression (Borgens et al. 2004), excitotoxicity (Curry et al.
2004), and acute intracranial hemorrhage (Cadichon et al.
2007).
Recently, our laboratory reported that using cortical neuron
cultures, P188 was shown to protect neurons from traumainduced mitochondrial and lysosomal membrane permeabilization damage (Luo et al. 2013). P188’s protection has
also been investigated in cultured HT22 cells under oxygen–
glucose deprivation (OGD) insults and in a mouse model of
ischemia injury (Gu et al. 2013). However, the proposed
mechanisms largely centered on improved integrity of
blood-brain barrier (BBB) and plasma membrane. Some preclinical studies examining these mechanisms were promising,
but large clinical trials and other underlying mechanisms
failed to show an effect. In addition, whether P188 protects
primary cortical neurons (PCNs) from hypoxia/ischemiainduced injury needs to be investigated.
Interestingly, recent studies have shown autophagy activation in cerebral ischemia in vitro and in vivo (Cui et al. 2012;
Sheng et al. 2012; Hu et al. 2014). However, excessive autophagy results in neuron damage or death, known as “autophagic cell death” in cerebral ischemia, with associated increased levels of light chain 3 (LC3)-II and Beclin-1 (Sheng
et al. 2012; Carloni et al. 2014). Autophagy process is regulated by the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt

989

signaling pathway which is crucial for maintaining and/or
enhancing the survival of neurons (Carloni et al. 2014). Moreover, the Akt phosphorylation facilitated the phosphorylation
of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), its downstream
transcription factor, to the nucleus which could induce suppression of activated autophagy (Hu et al. 2014). mTOR, an
evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase, plays a key
role in the regulation of cell growth and metabolism (Castilho
et al. 2009). Dysregulation of mTOR activity has been found
in several neurological diseases, such as traumatic brain injury
(TBI) (Park et al. 2012), intracerebral hemorrhage (Lu et al.
2014), and neurodegenerative disease (Malagelada et al.
2010). However, its role in stroke and whether P188’s neuroprotection was related to the mTOR signaling still need to be
determined.
The purpose of this study is to investigate whether P188
has neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia injury and
whether it has effects on maintaining the integrity of mitochondrial membranes and regulating autophagy. The protective effects of P188 are tested in primary cerebrocortical neurons in vitro exposed to OGD, as well as in cerebral ischemia
in vivo. We hypothesize that P188 may prevent OGD-induced
primary cerebrocortical neuron death, loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential, and activation of autophagy in vitro
and reduce the infarct volume and neurological score involved
with cerebral hypoxia/ischemia injury in vivo. In order to test
the underlying mechanisms, we used an established inhibitor
of mTOR (rapamycin), to measure the infarct volume, neurological score, and phosphorylation of mTOR in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Drugs and Animals
P188 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and rapamycin from
AXXORA, LLC (San Diego, CA, USA). All experimental
procedures and followed protocols were in accordance with
the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Soochow University and Fudan University. Male, 5to 7-week-old C57BL/6 mice (20 to 25 g) were used in this
study.
Primary Cortical Neuron Culture and Oxygen–Glucose
Deprivation (OGD)
Primary cortical neuron culture method was used as described
previously (Zhang et al. 2011; Luo et al. 2013). Cortical tissues were obtained from embryonic 14- to 16-day-old
C57BL/6 mice. After incubation with 0.125 % trypsin
(Invitrogen) for 10 min, cells were then resuspended in a solution of Neurobasal media (Invitrogen) containing 2 % B27

990

(Invitrogen), 2 mM glutamine (Invitrogen), 1 mM sodium
pyruvate (Invitrogen), 25 μM glutamate (Sigma), 100 U/ml
penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Then,
cells were seeded in 24-well plates (Falcon) coated with
0.01 % (w/v) poly-L-lysine (Sigma) at a density of 1.25–
2.0×105 cells/cm2 and put into a standard incubator (Taibai
Espec) maintained at 37 °C in 95 % air and 5 % CO2. A half
medium was changed every 3 days. The purity of neurons was
confirmed by immunostaining for MAP2 (a neuronal-specific
marker) and indicated that 90–95 % of cells in cultures were
MAP2 positive. The remaining cells exhibiting morphological
characteristics of glial cells were verified by GFAP
immunostaining.
To mimic ischemic-like conditions in vitro, cell cultures
were exposed to glucose deprivation and hypoxia (OGD) for
18 h. OGD was induced in an airtight chamber in a serum- and
glucose-free balanced salt solution (Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) 140 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 12 mM MgSO4,
5 mM NaHCO3, 1.7 mM CaCl2, 0.4 mM KH2·PO4, and
10 mM Hepes). Dishes were placed in an incubator chamber
(Billups-Rothenberg, CA, USA) aerated with a gas mixture
composed of 95 % N2/5 % CO2 for 10 min. After the deprivation period, cultures were returned back to the normal culture
medium under normoxic conditions overnight (Gu et al. 2013).
The indicated concentrations of P188 were added to the culture
medium 1 h prior to OGD.
Lactate Dehydrogenase Assay
Cell death of PCNs was quantitatively evaluated by the lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) assay as previously described according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Zhang et al. 2011; Luo
et al. 2013). Neurons were treated with P188 (0.1 nM–
100 μM) dissolved in 0.1 % DMSO 10 min following
OGD. The release of LDH into the culture media was measured 6 h after OGD using an LDH assay kit (Nanjing
Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, PR China).
Briefly, after OGD treatment, the supernatant of the cell culture was reserved. Neurons were rinsed with PBS and lysed
with 1 % Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 30 min. Then, samples of
supernatant s and cell lysates were prepared following the
manufacturer’s instructions. The absorbance value (A) at
440 nm was determined with an automatic multiwell spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).
LDH leakage was calculated as follows: LDH leakage
(%)=(A positive/A positive blank)/(A negative/A negative
blank)×100 % (Zhang et al. 2011).
Assessment of Neuronal Viability
The viability of the cells in neuronal monocultures was
assessed by their ability to take up thiazolyl blue tetrazolium
bromide (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-

J Mol Neurosci (2015) 56:988–998

diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)) (Ji et al. 2012). Neurons were treated with P188 (10 nM, 100 nM, and 1 μM)
dissolved in 0.1 % dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 10 min
following OGD. The MTT solution (5 mg MTT/ml medium)
was added to each well at the final concentration of 250 μM
and incubated for 3 h. The media was removed, and cells
were dissolved in 0.1 % DMSO. Optical density was determined using a spectrophotometer (SpectraMax 340PC384,
Molecular Devices) at 550-nm test and 690-nm reference
wavelengths. Neurons were stained with trypan blue, and
viability was determined using the trypan blue exclusion
assay. After incubation with the indicated conditions, neurons were incubated with 0.4 % trypan blue in HBSS for
2 min at room temperature. Neurons were observed under
the microscope and counted as stained and nonstained cells
on a hemacytometer separately; then, viable cell ratios were
calculated according to the following formula: viable cell
ratio (%) = (nonstained cell number/total cell number) ×
100 % (Ji et al. 2012).

Preparation of Mitochondrial and Cytosolic Fractions
Isolation of mitochondria was performed according to the reference (Luo et al. 2013, 2010). Briefly, each sample was homogenized in 0.3-ml ice-cold buffer A containing 250 mM
sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris–HCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol,
1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine,
0.28 U/ml apotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and 7 μg/ml pepstatin
A (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH) and homogenized with a
glass Pyrex microhomogenizer (30 strokes). The homogenate
was centrifuged at 1000×g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the resultant
supernatant was transferred to a new tube to be centrifuged at
12,000×g at 4 °C for 20 min to obtain the mitochondrial pellet
and supernatant. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,
000×g for 1 h at 4 °C to generate the cytosolic fraction. The
mitochondrial pellet was washed for three times in buffer B
containing 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EGTA, and 10 Mm Tris–
HCl (pH 7.4); spun at 12,000×g at 4 °C for 10 min; and then
lysed in Western blot lysis buffer.

Determination of Mitochondrial Transmembrane
Potential (ΔΨm)
PCNs were treated as indicated with or without 1 μmol/l
P188. Living cells were stained with rhodamine 123 (Rh
123) and tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) as previously described (Zhang et al. 2008) for 5 min at room temperature. Rh 123 and TMRM were purchased from Molecular
Probes. Digital images were taken. Reduced green Rh 123
fluorescence and red TMRM fluorescence indicate the dissipated ΔΨm.

Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion and Drug
Treatment
Male C57BL/6 mice (20 to 25 g) were induced by middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 60 min, which generates infarction in cortex, as previously described (Gu et al.
2012). Anesthesia was induced with 4 % isoflurane and maintained by 2 % isoflurane in 70 % air and balanced oxygen by a
facemask. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37±0.5 °C
with a heating pad (Harvard Apparatus). We introduced a
silicone-coated 7–0 monofilament into the right external carotid artery and advanced it from the carotid bifurcation to
occlude the MCA (Gu et al. 2012). The brain was removed,
and the cerebral hemisphere was retained for either evaluation
of infarct volume or Western blot analysis.
P188 (0.8 g/kg) was administered by tail vein injection
10 min after MCAO. Rapamycin was dissolved in saline
and stored at −20 °C. Before injection, rapamycin was diluted
with saline containing 5 % polyethylene glycol 400 and 5 %
Tween 80. The MCAO mice received a single intraperitoneal
(IP) injection of rapamycin (dose 50 μg/kg) 10 min after
MCAO.

aprotinin, 50 mg/l leupeptin, 1 mM benzamidine, and 7 mg/l
pepstain A (all chemicals from Sigma-Aldrich). The homogenate was then centrifuged at 12,000×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and
the supernatant was retained and preserved at −80 °C for later
use. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA kit
(Pierce). Each sample was subject to electrophoresis on 10 %
SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes on a semidry electrotransferring unit (Bio-Rad)
and incubated with antibodies against cytochrome c (BD
PharMingen), HSP-60 (BD PharMingen), COX (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), caspase-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), LC3
(Abcam), Beclin-1 (Abcam), mTOR (Cell Signaling Technology), and p-mTOR (Cell Signaling Technology) in Trisbuffered saline containing 0.1 % Tween-20 (TBST) and 5 %
nonfat dry milk overnight at 4 °C. After the overnight incubation with the primary antibodies, membranes were washed
and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second
antibody in TBST for 3 h. Immunoreactivity was detected
with enhanced chemoluminescent autoradiography (ECL kit,
Amersham). The membranes were reprobed with β-actin
(Sigma) after striping. The signal intensity of primary antibody binding was quantitatively analyzed with Sigma Scan
Pro 5 and was normalized to a loading control, β-actin.

Determination of Motor Deficits and Infarct Volume
Statistical Analysis
MCAO was sustained for a period of 24 h, after which each
mouse was assigned a neurological score on a scale of 0 to 4
and euthanized, while brains were rapidly removed for 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, and infarct volume was measured (Zhang et al. 2008).
The motor deficits of mice subjected to MCAO were evaluated by an examiner without knowing experimental conditions using the scales as described by Longa et al., 0 point,
mice behave normally; 1 point, mice cannot fully stretch their
left front legs; 2 points, mice turn around into a circle; 3 points,
mice fall down to the left side; and 4 points, mice cannot move
voluntarily, losing consciousness (Longa et al. 1989).
Six 1.5-mm-thickness sections were obtained and stained
with 2 % TTC for 30 min and then fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde. Lesioned areas not stained red with TTC were
quantitatively analyzed with Sigma Scan Pro 5. Infarct volume was calculated through slice thickness and the lesioned
areas, expressed as a percentage of total hemisphere (Gu et al.
2013).
Western Blot Analysis
The procedure used was published previously (Luo et al.
2010, 2011), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Samples were homogenized in Western blot analysis buffer
containing 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 %
(v/v) Triton X-100, 1 % sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 % sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 0.28 kU/l

The data were expressed as mean±SEM and were analyzed
using GraphPad Prism 5 Software (La Jolla, CA, USA). Statistical analysis was performed using single-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s post hoc test to determine significance values between different experimental
groups.

Results
P188 Prevented OGD-Induced Cell Death in Primary
Neurons
OGD is an ischemic-like experimental model in vitro. P188
exhibited neuroprotection in cultured HT22 cells under OGD
insults (Gu et al. 2013). To determine whether P188 protects
PCNs from hypoxia/ischemia-induced injury, we evaluated
the effects of P188 on PCNs. Using LDH assay, exposing
PCNs to OGD with or without P188 (10 nM to 100 μM)
resulted in statistically significant dose-dependent inhibition
of primary neuronal cell death (Fig. 1a). Plotting the resulting
semilogarithmic curve as a function of drug concentrations
showed the IC50 to be 9.9 nM and the maximum protection
47 % (Fig. 1b). To further verify that P188 has a protective
effect on neuronal injury in vitro, we determined the effects of
P188 on cell viability by MTT assay. Assessments of cell
viability demonstrated that approximately 50 % of neuronal

992

J Mol Neurosci (2015) 56:988–998

measured the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) of primary neurons by rhodamine 123 staining
and TMRM fluorescence. The fluorescent signal, which
displayed a punctuate pattern in healthy cells due to preferential staining of negatively charged mitochondria, became diffuse after OGD, presumably due to loss of ΔΨm (Fig. 2).
Dissipated ΔΨm was forestalled by treatment with P188, indicating loss of ΔΨm correlated with OGD-induced death of
primary neurons, and P188 inhibited dissipation of ΔΨm induced by OGD (Fig. 2). Hence P188-mediated neuroprotective effects involve preservation of ΔΨm for appropriate cellular energetics.
P188 Inhibited OGD-Induced Release of Cytochrome c
from Mitochondria to Cytosol and Caspase-3 Activation
We next assessed blotting for cytochrome c in purified mitochondria. Western blot analysis showed that a significant reduction in protein levels of cytochrome c in mitochondrial
fraction (Fig. 3a, b) and a concomitant increase in cytochrome
c levels in cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3a, c) were observed after
OGD. Treatment with P188 (100 μM) significantly inhibited
OGD-induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to
cytosol (Fig. 3).
The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria triggers
activation of downstream caspases. Indeed, Western blot analysis demonstrated that caspase-3 was activated in primary
neurons under OGD insults, and P188 effectively inhibited
caspase-3 activation (Fig. 4). Taken together, our data suggest
that the inhibitory activation of caspase-3 may relate to the
neuroprotective ability of P188 against cell death in primary
neurons.

Fig. 1 Neuroprotective effects of P188 on cell death of PCNs. Cell death
was induced by 3-h exposure to OGD with or without a series of
concentrations of P188. The indicated concentrations of P188 were
added to the culture medium 1 h prior to OGD. Cell death was
evaluated by LDH assay (a) and MTT assay (c). The resulting curves
(plotted semilogarithmically) define the IC50 and maximum protection
(b). Data are expressed as mean±SEM (n=4). ANOVA is followed by

cells were dead after OGD. P188 (10 nM, 100 nM, and 1 μM)
treatment significantly attenuated cell death in neurons after
OGD in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1c).
P188 Moderated OGD-Induced Dissipation of ΔΨm
in Mitochondria
Given that the loss of ΔΨm is an important event associated
with progression of mitochondrial dysfunction and leads to
cell death of the host neuron (Chang and Johnson 2002), we

P188 Significantly Inhibited OGD-Induced Activation
of Autophagy
To determine the influence of P188 on neuronal autophagy
in vitro, we examined the expressions of autophagy markers
LC3 and Beclin-1 in PCNs. The expression of the LC3-II
protein was greatly increased in cultured cells upon insult.
However, the administration of P188 significantly reduced
its expression (Fig. 5a, b). In parallel, upregulation of
Beclin-1 upon OGD insult was observed in PCNs, whereas
treatment with P188 resulted in a marked reduction of Beclin1 protein expression (Fig. 5a, c).
Both P188 and Rapamycin Reduced
Cerebral-Ischemia-Induced Brain Injury In Vivo
MCAO is the most commonly used animal model in the study
of ischemic stroke. We evaluated the ability of P188 to reduce
ischemic damage in the MCAO model, including the infarct
volume and neurological score. P188 (0.8 g/kg) or rapamycin

staining at 24 h after MCAO. Mice administered with P188
or rapamycin had significantly smaller infarcts after MCAO
than mice injected with the vehicle alone (Fig. 6a, b).
Remarkable motor behavioral deficits were observed in
saline-treated mice. Mice treated with P188 and rapamycin
had significantly better postischemic behavior compared to
vehicle-control mice, respectively (Fig. 6c). These analyses
showed that both P188 and rapamycin were able to ameliorate
the neurological injury after ischemic attack, respectively.

Fig. 2 P188 inhibits dissipation of ΔΨm during OGD-induced cell death.
Cell death was induced in PCNs by subjecting cells to OGD for 3 h with
or without 1 μmol/L P188. The green fluorescence results from the
accumulation of Rh 123 within negatively charged (functioning)
mitochondria, displaying a punctuate pattern, as demonstrated in control
cells. Compared with control cells, Rh 123 staining became diffuse,
presumably due to the loss of ΔΨm mitochondrial depolarization (left

dissipated ΔΨm (right panel). The scale bar is 5 μm

To determine whether P188’s neuroprotection was related to
the mTOR signaling, the expression of p-mTOR was detected
by Western blot; both P188 and rapamycin were used. As
shown in Fig. 7, mTOR phosphorylation in the ipsilateral
cortex was significantly decreased at 24 h after MCAO,
whereas both P188 and rapamycin treatment significantly
counteracted the MCAO-induced decrease of p-mTOR levels
in the ipsilateral cortex, respectively (Fig. 7). However, the
levels of total mTOR were not significantly changed after
MCAO.

Discussion
In the present study, we examined the effect of P188 on ischemic brain damage both in vivo and in vitro. P188 offers neuroprotection in PCN and mouse models of ischemic injury,

identifying it as a novel potential drug candidate for ischemic
stroke. Our results are consistent with the previous findings
that P188 is protective in animal models of controlled cortical
impact (Mbye et al. 2012) or spinal cord compression
(Borgens et al. 2004) and acute intracranial hemorrhage
(Cadichon et al. 2007). The major novel findings of this study
are as follows: (i) P188 inhibits OGD-induced primary
cerebrocortical neuron death; (ii) P188 inhibits OGDinduced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the release
of mitochondrial apoptogenic factor cytochrome c from the
mitochondria to the cytoplasm, and activation of caspase-3
in vitro; (iii) P188 inhibits OGD-induced activation of
Beclin-1 and LC3 in vitro; (iv) both P188 and rapamycin
significantly decreased the infarct volume and improved neurological score in the MCAO mouse model of cerebral ischemia, respectively; and (v) in vivo activity of P188 and
rapamycin administered separately was confirmed by increased expression of p-mTOR after MCAO.
It is established that acute membrane damage due to brain
injury is a critical precipitating event. However, plasmalemma
resealing may not be sufficient for survival of injured cells
(Mbye et al. 2012). Previous study reported that P188 has
neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury and its effects on maintaining the integrity of cell membranes and BBB (Gu et al. 2013). In the current study, P188
treatment significantly attenuated LDH leakage and cell death
in neurons following OGD. From above data, we conclude
that other mechanisms except cell rescue mediate the protective effects of P188 in cultured primary neurons. We predict
that membrane damage due to the initial event can be

responsible for the initiation of the delayed pathological
events such as disruption of mitochondrial membrane integrity and dysregulation of the mTOR pathway after ischemia
injury.
The main aim of the present study is then to investigate the
effect of P188 on mitochondrial membrane permeability
(MMP) in response to OGD and to further reveal the underlying pharmacological mechanism related with the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway after cerebral ischemic injury. Cerebral ischemia can induce a series of pathological changes in
neuronal cells such as mitochondrial membrane depolarization, permeability transition pore opening, and the release of
cytochrome c (cyt-c) (Gu et al. 2012). First, characterizing
alterations in ΔΨm is of great diagnostic value in predicting
cell fate after OGD because mitochondria are known to play a
major role in the regulation of cell death and survival
(Nicholls and Budd 2000). Rhodamin123 and TMRM are
the reliable fluorescent probes for assessing changes of
ΔΨm (Zhang et al. 2008). Using rhodamine 123 staining
and TMRM staining in vitro, we found in this study that
postinjury P188 treatment could moderate the dissipation of
ΔΨm in mitochondria, thus indicating the protective effect of
P188 on OGD-induced mitochondrial membrane damage. In
addition, cyt-c is a diffusible electron carrier located in the
intermembrane space of mitochondria (Galluzzi et al. 2008).
Our aforetime study reported that a significant increase is observed in the percentage of high cytosolic cyt-c after TBI
in vivo (Luo et al. 2010) and in vitro (Luo et al. 2013). In
the current work, the relatively lower cytosolic cyt-c levels
detected in P188-treated samples indicated that there is a correlation between P188 and the preservation of mitochondrial
function. Moreover, once cyt-c enters the cytosol, it binds and

996

activates apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) as
well as procaspase-9, which, in turn, activates caspase-3 to
initiate apoptosis (Galluzzi et al. 2008). Neuronal apoptosis
is an important pathological process of ischemic stroke (Doyle
et al. 2008). Several studies have demonstrated that the inhibition of apoptosis could reduce ischemic injury (Rabuffetti
et al. 2000; Yepes et al. 2000). Consistently, our study indicated that caspase-3 was activated in primary neurons under
OGD insults, but P188 effectively inhibited caspase-3 activation, thus reducing neuronal apoptosis. However, our data do
not conclusively show that mitochondrial membrane resealing
and the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway are the only or even
the major mechanism explaining the observed P188’s neuroprotection against hypoxia/ischemia injury. Further studies are
needed to investigate the exact mechanism by which P188
repairs the damaged mitochondrial membrane under OGD
insults in primary cultured neurons. More mechanisms underlying P188’s neuroprotection after hypoxia/ischemia injury
remain elusive.
It has been reported that an autophagy inhibitor 3-MA significantly reduced infarct volume after permanent occlusion of
the rat’s middle cerebral artery (pMCAO) (Wen et al. 2008). 3MA and wortmannin, two autophagy inhibitors, significantly
reduced Beclin-1 expression and switched the mechanism of
the cell death mode from apoptosis to necrosis (Wang et al.
2011), thus attenuating the ischemic insults. We observed autophagy stimulation in PCNs in vitro with the upregulation of
LC3 and Beclin-1, confirming autophagy activation in focal
cerebral ischemia. Interestingly, with the administration of
P188, the activation of LC3 and Beclin-1 was inhibited after
OGD, indicating that P188 may be correlated with autophagy
inhibition and that P188 could protect neuronal survival
through inhibiting the autophagic pathway. Together, based
on our data, inhibiting autophagic activation, at least partially,
underlies the mechanism of P188-induced tolerance to cerebral ischemia.
mTOR, an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase, plays a crucial role in regulating many activities, including cell growth, cell death, and metabolism (Castilho et al.
2009). Accumulating evidence indicates that mTOR is dysregulated in various brain diseases, including intracerebral
hemorrhage (ICH), TBI, and hypoxia-ischemia, and inhibition
of mTOR by rapamycin provides neuroprotective effects
(Carloni et al. 2008; Castilho et al. 2009; Lu et al. 2014).
Erlich et al. (2007) demonstrated that rapamycin injection
after TBI reduced microglial activation and increased the
number of surviving neurons at the site of injury to improve
functional recovery. Carloni et al. (2008) showed that
rapamycin reduced necrotic cell death and decreased brain
injury in a model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia. Downstream
targets of PI3K/Akt signaling include the protein kinase
mTOR, which is a key regulator of translation and autophagy
(Hu et al. 2014). The underlying mechanism of P188

J Mol Neurosci (2015) 56:988–998

protective action appeared to involve the phosphorylation of
mTOR. As a protein kinase, mTOR forms two distinct
multiprotein complexes called mTORC1 and mTORC2. The
mTORC1 prototype is responsible for activating p70S6 kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates the ribosomal protein
S6 and 4EBP1—which is inhibited by rapamycin (Corradetti
and Guan 2006; Gera and Lichtenstein 2011). The protective
potential of immunosuppressive agent, rapamycin, has been
reported in many experimental models of ischemia both
in vivo and in vitro, suggesting novel therapeutic application
of the drug (Chauhan et al. 2011; Gupta and Chauhan 2011).
Rapamycin, via its methoxy group, forms a complex with the
immunophilin FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) and then
binds to and inactivates the mTOR, especially mTORC1. This
leads to the dissociation of the mTOR from the ULK1 complex, allowing to prevent phosphorylation of S6 kinase and
4EBP1 (Vignot et al. 2005). Consistently, we used the most
commonly used animal MCAO mode to mimic human cerebral ischemic disease. Our study provides the evidence that
the mTOR signaling was activated and the outcome (such as
infarct volume and motor deficits) was induced by MCAO,
while phosphorylation of mTOR was increased by rapamycin
and P188, and the outcome was significantly improved
through upregualtion of p-mTOR.
The current study sought to investigate the possible mechanisms of P188’s neuroprotection against OGD or MCAOinduced cell death and brain injury. P188 prevents neuronal
cell death resulting from ischemic brain injury, and its neuroprotective effects are mediated by preventing mitochondrial
membrane integrity damage and the activation of autophagy.
In which, the important mechanism underlying the protective
effects of P188 is that it acts on the mitochondria to moderate
OGD-induced dissipation of ΔΨm in mitochondria and to
inhibit the release of apoptogenic factor cyt-c from mitochondria into cytosol, thereby forestalling the caspase cascades that
lead to cell death. In addition, P188 and rapamycin treatment
given 10 min after MCAO can promote neurologic functional
recovery, respectively. Lastly, the underlying mechanisms
may be the effects of P188 and rapamycin on regulating the
mTOR signaling pathway. These findings have partially revealed the molecular mechanisms underlying neuroprotection
of P188. However, we could not exclude the possibility that
P188 may undergo neuroprotective activities through other
pathways. Other supportive experiments need to be performed
for further investigation. Our data suggest that the mTOR
signaling may be a potential therapeutic target for stroke. Further studies examining the effects of P188 on related signaling
pathways are needed to identify novel potential targets for
treatment strategies in patients with ischemia injury.
