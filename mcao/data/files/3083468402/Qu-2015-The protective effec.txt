Abstract Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid,
have been demonstrated to have neuroprotective effect.
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are thought to be important factors that mediate neuroprotection. However, little is
known about the role of PI3K/Akt and KATP channels in
brain after EETs administration. In vitro experiment, oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) was performed in cultured
rat cerebral microvascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) for
4 h. The effect of 14,15-EET on OGD induced cell apoptosis was examined after reoxygenation. Western blot and
real-time PCR were used to analyze the expression of
Kir6.1, SUR2B (two subunits of KATP channels) and
p-Akt on cerebral microvascular SMCs. In vivo experiments, we use 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-dodecanoic
acid [AUDA, a specific soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH)
inhibitor] to confirm the effect of EETs indirectly. Rats
were injected intraperitoneally with AUDA before being
subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). We
detected the apoptosis and the expression of p-Akt, Kir6.1
and SUR2B in ischemic penumbra. The results showed that
EETs protect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)
injury and upregulated the expression of p-Akt and Kir6.1

in both of ischemic penumbra and OGD induced cerebral
microvascular SMCs. The protective effect was inhibited
by Wortmannin (a specific PI3K inhibitor) and Glib (a
specific KATP inhibitor) respectively in vitro experiment.
In conclusion, these results suggested that the protective
effect of EETs on cerebral I/R injury is associated with
PI3K/Akt pathway and KATP channels. Furthermore, the
PI3K pathway may contribute to mediating KATP channels
on cerebral microvascular SMCs.

Introduction
Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) which are cytochrome
P450 (CYP) epoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid
(AA) include four regioisomers (5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12- and
14,15-). EETs have been reported to play important roles in

123

numerous cellular processes, including vasodilators, antiinflammatory and angiogenic, and can regulate cerebral
blood flow to increase neural activity and metabolic
demand [1–3]. It also exerts potential protective effect
against brain ischemia injury through various mechanisms
[4, 5]. For instance, EETs improves amyloid b-induced
mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured rat hippocampal
astrocytes [6]. Besides, other studies have shown the
antioxidant and anti-mitochondria injury ability of EETs
may also participate in the protective effect on ischemia
injury [7]. However, the detailed protective mechanisms in
rats brain after EETs administration remain to be defined.
Action of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
signaling pathway is generally considered to promote cell
survival and inhibit cell apoptosis following brain ischemia. Intraperitoneal administration of stimulator of PI3K/
Akt markedly enhances the brain ischemia-induced neurogenesis [8, 9]. Therefore, PI3K/Akt pathway is an
important therapeutic target for prevention of neuronal and
cellular death induced by brain ischemia. It has been
reported that EETs play protective roles by activating
PI3K/Akt pathway in tumor and myocardium [10, 11].
However, little is known about the relationship between
EETs and PI3K/Akt pathway in brain I/R injury, especially
in the ischemic penumbra region of brain.
ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are unique
channel proteins that couple the metabolic state of a cell to
its electrical activity directly. KATP channels consist of at
least two distinct subunits: a pore-forming subunit that
belongs to the K? inward rectifier family (Kir6.x); and a
regulatory subunit, the sulphonylurea receptor (SURx) [12,
13]. KATP channels are widely distributed in various tissues and are functionally expressed in various brain
regions. They are in resting state under normal conditions,
but can be activated under many pathological conditions,
such as ischemia–hypoxia, ischemic preconditioning or
metabolic inhibition [14–16]. Whether protective effect of
EETs could be mediated by KATP channels after cerebral
I/R injury remains enigmatic.
Stroke can be viewed as a brain dysfunction involving
multiple cell types, an ideal therapeutic target for stroke
would be explored to rescue all the cells in the brain. The
treatment of stroke should include both of neuroprotection
and vascular protection. During the acute phase of cerebral
ischemia, vascular injury mainly refers to cerebral microvascular system, which results in increased Blood Brain
Barrier permeability. Cerebral microvascular SMCs play
important roles in the physiology and pathology of cerebral
ischemia [17]. Therefore, the effect of EETs on cerebral
microvascular SMCs under hypoxia condition need to be
further illuminated.
EETs are generally considered as a single class of
compounds, the levels of 11,12-EET and 14,15-EET in

brain are higher than that of 5,6- and 8,9-EET. However, the
biological activity of EETs in vivo is limited by their metabolic conversion through multiple pathways. 14,15-EET
(chemical structure is shown in Fig. 1a) is the best substrate
for soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) [18]. SEH is a major
enzyme that preferentially metabolizes 14,15-EET to its less
active diol 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (14,15DHET) [19]. One study showed sEH gene deletion is protective against ischemic brain injury, due to reduced
metabolism of circulating 14,15-EET [20]. Therefore, an

1 lM 14,15-EET were added to the SMCs 30 min before
exposure to OGD. 14,15-EET treatment significantly prevented the decreased cell viability caused by OGD and
reperfusion, which was in a concentration-dependent
manner (Fig. 1d).

alternative strategy that has been used to increase EETs
systemically is sEH inhibition [21]. We use 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-dodecanoic acid (AUDA), a specific
sEH inhibitor (chemical structure is shown in Fig. 6a)
in vivo and 14,15-EET in vitro experiment to detect the
detailed mechanisms of protective effect of EETs in brain.
We explored the protective effect of EETs by focusing on
both the ischemic penumbra and cerebral microvascular
SMCs. We hypothesized that EETs’ protective effect
involves the activation of both PI3K/Akt pathway and
KATP channels. We provided evidence based on a focal
cerebral I/R rat model and an oxygen–glucose deprivation
(OGD) cell model.

Results
14,15-EET Protects Cell Survival Against OGD
in Cerebral Microvascular SMCs
To investigate the protective effects of 14,15-EET (chemical structure in Fig. 1a), we firstly measured the cell viability by MTT assay in rat cerebral microvascular SMCs.
After OGD and reoxygenation treatment, cell viability was
decreased compared with the control (Fig. 1d). 0.1, 0.5 and

Activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway promotes cell
survival and inhibits cell apoptosis following brain ischemia [8, 9]. Therefore, we analyzed the phosphorylated and
total Akt levels in primary cultures of cerebral microvascular SMCs which were pretreated with 14,15-EET for
30 min and then exposed to OGD. As shown in Fig. 2,
OGD caused a slight but significant increase in the ratio of
p-Akt/Akt in SMCs compared to control. But compared to
SMCs underwent OGD, 14,15-EET induced a dosedependent increased ratio of pAkt to Akt in the SMCs,
which suggests that the phosphorylation of Akt may participate in the protective effect of 14,15-EET against OGD
in SMCs.
14,15-EET Up-regulates the Kir6.1 Subunit of KATP
Channel in Cerebral Microvascular SMCs Undergoing
OGD
To elucidate whether 14,15-EET regulates KATP channels
on cerebral microvascular SMCs, we next tested the protein
expression of subunits of KATP channels, Kir6.1 and
SUR2B. As shown in Fig. 3a, b, expression of Kir6.1
protein was slightly up-regulated by OGD treatment in
cerebral microvascular SMCs compared with control. In
the presence of 14,15-EET, expression of Kir6.1 protein
was significantly increased in a concentration dependent
manner versus the OGD ? vehicle group. But the other
subunit of KATP channel SUR2B was not regulated by
either OGD treatment or 14,15-EET (Fig. 3c, d). These
results suggests that Kir6.1 subunit but not SUR2B subunit
can be regulated by 14,15-EET, but whether it is involved
in the protection of SMCs against OGD needs to be further
identified.
Up-regulation of Kir6.1 by 14,15-EET in SMCs is
Partially Through PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway
Both PI3K/Akt and KATP channel can be activated by
ischemia or hypoxia [8, 9, 14–16] or by OGD in cerebral
microvascular SMCs in our present study, so we next
detected whether the up-regulation of KATP channel by
14,15-EET in SMCs underwent OGD is through the
activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. A specific
PI3K inhibitor Wortmanin (WT, 1 lM) was

administrated to the SMCs 30 min before exposure to
OGD. As shown in Fig. 4, 1 lM of 14,15-EET up-regulated the Kir6.1 protein and mRNA level by 2.17- and
4.93-fold, respectively, which suggests that the up-regulation of Kir6.1 by 14,15-EET mainly occurs on

transcriptional level. WT did not totally but partially
reverse the enhanced expression of Kir6.1 protein and
mRNA, suggesting that there are other regulatory signaling pathways besides PI3K/Akt participate in regulating Kir6.1.

protective effects of 14,15-EET, which indicated that
14,15-EET improved cell viability and inhibited cell
apoptosis via PI3K/Akt pathway and KATP channels
(Fig. 5).

Since Akt and KATP channel could be activated by 14,15EET (Figs. 2, 3), we next determined whether Akt and
KATP are involved in regulating cell survival and cell
apoptosis. WT and a specific KATP channels inhibitor,
Glibenclamide (Glib) were used to block PI3K/Akt pathway and KATP channel, respectively. The cerebral
microvascular SMCs were pretreated with 1 lM 14,15EET, 1 lM WT or 2 lM Glib for 30 min before treated by
OGD. From the results of MTT assay and flow cytometry,
it showed that WT and Glib respectively weakened the

in Sham group. The infarct volume percent of different
AUDA-treated groups were 31.87 ± 2.81 % (low-dose
AUDA treated I/R group); 27.25 ± 0.62 % (medium-dose
AUDA treated I/R group); 23.54 ± 0.91 % (high-dose
AUDA treated I/R group), which were significantly smaller
(P \ 0.05) compared with I/R ? DMSO group
(36.07 ± 1.6 %, n = 6) (Fig. 6b, d). TUNEL assay
(Fig. 6c, e) of rat brain ischemic penumbra was undertaken
to examine the protective effect of AUDA on ischemic
brain injury. I/R injury caused cell apoptosis in ischemic
penumbra, pre-treatment with AUDA significantly reduced
apoptotic cells in ischemic penumbra. Quantitative analysis
of TUNEL-positive cells showed that there was a significant increase in TUNEL-positive cells in I/R ? vehicle
group (57.55 ± 2.71/field) compared with the Sham group
(6.40 ± 1.07/field). In addition, each dose of AUDA group
displayed a decrease in TUNEL-positive cells in ischemic
penumbra (low-dose AUDA group 47.03 ± 3.42/field;
media-dose AUDA group 34.53 ± 4.30/field; high-dose
AUDA group 26.40 ± 2.63/field), which was statistical
significant compared with the I/R ? vehicle group.

AUDA Increases the Activation of Akt and Up-regulates
KATP Channel in Rat Brain Ischemic Penumbra Region
To examine whether the protective effects of AUDA are
mediated by the PI3K/Akt pathway, immunohistochemistry and Western Blot of rat brain ischemic penumbra were
performed with antibodies specific for phosphorylated
active forms of Akt. The level of p-Akt was significantly
increased in each AUDA pre-treatment groups compared
with the I/R ? DMSO group (P \ 0.05), in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 7a, b, d, e).
We also observed expression of two subunits of KATP
channels, Kir6.1 and SUR2B to elucidate whether AUDA
regulates KATP channels in rat brain ischemic penumbra.
As shown in Fig. 7c, f, expression of Kir6.1 was up-regulated in I/R ? vehicle group compared with the Sham
group in ischemic penumbra. Meanwhile, the expression of
Kir6.1 was notably higher with the administration of
AUDA compared with I/R ? vehicle group which is in a
dose-dependent manner, whereas it showed no significant
effect of AUDA on the expression of SUR2B in

I/R ? vehicle groups and AUDA-treated groups (data not
shown).

Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate that the protective effect of
EETs on cerebral I/R injury both in vitro and in vivo. The
study also elaborate that the mechanism of the protective
effect is associated with activating PI3K/Akt pathway and
KATP channels.
Increasing EETs has the potential to protect the brain
from damage that occurs during and following a cerebral
ischemic event. However, it has been reported that delivering EETs to injured organs or tissues is impractical.
Because, EETs as fatty acids can rapidly bind to plasma
proteins or be metabolized by soluble epoxide hydrolase
(sEH) into their less active diol, dihydroxyeicosatrienoic
acids (DHETs) [23, 24]. In addition, from the perspective
of pharmacokinetics, to be effective in vivo, in addition to
potency, compounds need to have good metabolic stability
and pharmacokinetic and distribution properties [25]. Fang
et al. [26] have reported that when applied exogenously
in vivo, 14,15-EET is not metabolically stable, and can be
converted to 14,15-DHET by near 100 % over a 6-h period.
The application of more metabolically stable and active
EET agonists to treat animals has recently been successful,
reduce the degradation of EETs and promote the accumulation of EETs by inhibiting sEH [27].
From this point, 14,15-EET is not appropriate for being
applied directly in vivo. Hence, we choose a stable sEH
inhibitor in our in vivo experiment instead of adding 14,15EET directly to avoid 14,15-EET wearing off rapidly. A
few recent resarch have shown that AUDA has broad
pharmacological potential for treating ischemic stroke [5,
20, 28]. It has been reported that AUDA increased plasma
and tissue levels of EETs, and may have great value on the
future clinical application [4, 29]. According to metabolism
characteristic of EET, we choose AUDA in our in vivo
experiment. Based on the reasons above, in vivo with
AUDA experiments could explore the effect of 14,15-EET
indirectly but meaningfully.
Ischemia-induced cell death is a major cause of disability or death after stroke. Identifying the key intrinsic
protective mechanisms induced by ischemia is critical for
the development of effective stroke treatment [30].
Apoptosis leads to the process of cell death after cerebral ischemia injury. In focal cerebral ischemia, apoptosis
is mainly involved in the ischemic penumbra [31]. Ischemic penumbra includes the perifocal areas which are
marginally perfused but may be recruited into the infarcted
process unless perfusion is restored or pharmacological
measures are instituted that prevent additional cell death

123

Neurochem Res (2015) 40:1–14

[32]. We demonstrated that AUDA inhibited neuronal
apoptosis in ischemic penumbra after MCAO and 24 h of
reperfusion treatment (Fig. 6d). AUDA also significantly
elevated neurological deficit scores (Table 1), decrease
infarction volume after MCAO and 24 h of reperfusion
treatment (Fig. 6c, d), which is in consistence with the
study of Simpkins et al. [5] that AUDA is protective
against cerebral ischemia via vascular and neural
protection.
Cerebral smooth muscle cells as one components of the
neurovascular unit plays a central role in the pathogenesis
of cerebral vascular diseases including stroke. Cerebral
microvascular SMCs respond dynamically to acute ischemia, initiating mechanisms important for secondary injury
events, and potentially for vascular and tissue remodeling
[33, 34]. Some studies showed that EETs have effect on
vascular smooth cells of different tissue, such as rat mesenteric arterial and aortic [35, 36]. However, there is lack
of evidence about the EETs’ effect on vascular smooth
cells in other tissue. We focused on the cerebral microvascular SMCs in vitro in our study. Here we demonstrated
for the first time that 14,15-EET protects against OGD
induced cerebral microvascular SMCs death (Figs. 1, 5).
A growing body of studies have shown that PI3K/Akt
pathway is a central mediator in signal transduction pathways involved in cell growth, survival and metabolism
[37]. For instance, PI3K/Akt pathway can be activated in
ischemic penumbra in rat, which indicates that the pathway
involved in the pathophysiologic procedures of cerebral
ischemia [38]. Li et al. demonstrated that expression level
of p-Akt in ischemic penumbra is higher than that in core
ischemia region [39]. Our results showed that AUDA
upregulated p-Akt expression in the ischemic penumbra, in
a dose-dependence manner (Fig. 7a, b). In vitro experiment
also demonstrated that 14,15-EET increased p-Akt
expression in cerebral microvascular SMCs under hypoxia
condition (Fig. 2). Notably, the protective effect of 14,15EET was inhibited by inhibitor of PI3K (Fig. 5). The
results suggested that EETs’ protective effect relies on the
activation of PI3K/Akt pathway in brain ischemic injury.
KATP channels are distributed in different encephalic
regions with different subunits composition. It has been
reported that all subunits (Kir6.1, Kir6.2, SUR1 and SUR2)
of KATP channels are expressed in the brain, but Kir6.1
and SUR2B are mainly expressed on vascular smooth
muscle cells [40, 41]. To explore whether EETs protect
against cerebral ischemia through KATP channels, we
tested the expression of Kir6.1 and SUR2B subunits in
ischemic penumbra and OGD induced cerebral microvascular SMCs. Here we have shown that with the treatment of
AUDA in MCAO rats, Kir6.1 but not SUR2B is up-regulated remarkably in ischemic penumbra in a dose-dependent manner compared with I/R group (Fig. 7). Similarly,

Neurochem Res (2015) 40:1–14

in vitro experiment has shown that the expression of Kir6.1
is also up-regulated in OGD induced cerebral microvascular SMCs. After the administration with 14,15-EET, the
level of Kir6.1 protein is even higher (Fig. 3). Melamed
et al. [42] found that Kir6.1 is up-regulated in brain under
chronic hypoxia, demonstrating that Kir6.1 is a hypoxiainducible gene. Wang et al. [43] also found that the
expression of Kir6.1 mRNA in I/R group increased obviously in hypoxia–ischemia-reperfusion gerbils brain.
However, Dong et al. [44] found expression of Kir6.1
subunit was down-regulated in the ischemic area, which
seemed distinguished from our results. The different results
in core and penumbra may due to that ischemic penumbra
is the tissue where normal ion balance and structural
integrity were survived. The degree of energy exhaust in
ischemic penumbra is significantly lower than that in core,
which results different degree of activation of KATP
channels in different area of brain in ischemia injure [45].
Stoller et al. [46] found that SUR2B subunit is not
necessary in the mediating acute cardiovascular stress
response. Meanwhile, the level of SUR2 does not change
obviously in the myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury.
In our study, we found no matter in vivo (ischemic penumbra) or in vitro (cerebral microvascular SMCs), EETs
have no significantly effects on regulating the expression of
SUR2B, which agree with the studies in cardiac tissue.
Nevertheless, the reason of the less impact of EETs on
SUR2B of brain tissue remains to be further defined.
A number of KATP channels activators exert their
protective effect in ischemic brain, for instance, levromakalim [15] and Y-26736 [47], which suggests that the
KATP channels activation plays a key role in development
of a protective mechanism of cerebral ischemia. Our results
showed that glibenclamide, an inhibitor of KATP channels
inhibited the protective effect of 14,15-EET against OGD
in cerebral microvascular SMCs (Fig. 5) which indicates a
protective effect of EETs on cerebral I/R injuries through
KATP channels.
On the basis of the above mentioned study, we further
investigated the underlying mechanisms of 14,15-EET
activating KATP channels in OGD induced cerebral
microvascular SMCs. Several reports have shown KATP
channels may be mediated by PI3K pathway [7, 48]. In our
study, we found that overexpression of Kir6.1 induced by
14,15-EET was suppressed by PI3K inhibitor (Fig. 4). The
results demonstrated that EETs activated KATP channels
in cerebral microvascular SMCs may be at least partly
based on the regulation of PI3K pathway. However, the
signaling network contribute to the activating of KATP
channel in the present of 14,15-EET needs to be further
explored.
Ischemic stroke is a vascular disorder affecting neuronal
function. Because ischemia affects not only neurons but

9

also astrocytes and other glial cells that support the neurons, and the microvessels that supply oxygen and nutrients
to them. Neurons and microvessels respond equally rapidly
to the ischemic insult [49].
Protection of cerebral microvessels could decrease the
apoptosis of neurons and other type of cells both in
ischemic brain [33]. In our present study, we found that the
protective effect of AUDA against ischemic brain relates to
the activation of Akt and upregulation of KATP. Similarly,
in vitro, the protective effect of 14,15-EET on OGD
induced cerebral microvascular SMCs apoptosis is also
mediated by PI3K/Akt pathway and KATP channels.
Hence, we suspected that the protective effects of AUDA
against ischemic brain may be associated with the protective effect of EET on cerebral microvascular SMCs.
Both macro- and micro-vascular dysregulation occurs
during I/R that can exacerbate the primary insult [50]. In
our present study, we focus on the protective effect of
14,15-EET on cerebral microvascular SMCs in vitro
experiment. Further research should be carried out to
investigate the protective effect 14,15-EET in astrocytes,
neuron and ligodendrocytes. On the other hand, it should
be noted that the cell–cell interactions are not static.
Communication between astrocytes and neurons in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury is disturbed under acute
phase after brain injury [51]. Thus, roles of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids in communication between astrocytes and
neurons in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury need to be
further investigated.
Taken together, our results have shown that EETs protects against I/R injury relate to the activation of Akt and
upregulation of KATP from fresh perspective with focusing on ischemic penumbra and cerebral microvascular
SMCs. The results of in vitro experiments have further
demonstrated that with the presence of 14,15-EET, KATP
channels are likely to be regulated by PI3K pathway in
OGD induced cerebral microvascular SMCs. A complete
understanding of the mechanisms of EETs’ protective
effect may shed a new light on the therapeutic approach to
human ischemic brain disease.

Cell Viability Assay
Cell Culture
Primary cultures of cerebral microvascular SMCs were
prepared from fetal day 10 Sprague–Dawley rats as
described previously [52]. The isolated cells were transferred into DMEM medium (10 % fetal bovine serum and
1 % penicillin/streptomycin and 1 % glutamine). The
mixed solution was centrifuged for 10 min to have cell
pellets. The resuspended cells were cultured in a humidified chamber (37 °C, 5 % CO2, 85 % humidity) for
3–5 days. The purity of cerebral microvascular SMCs in
primary cultures was detected by specific monoclonal
antibody for smooth-muscle-actin (Boehringer Mannheim).
Uniform immunostaining results were shown in Fig. 1b, c.
Oxygen–Glucose Deprivation (OGD)
and Reoxygenation
Cells were cultured for 24 h to reach 80–90 % confluence
under normal culture condition. For experiment groups,
culture plates were placed in an anaerobic humidified
chamber flushed with mix gas of 1 % O2, 3 % CO2 and
92 % N2 at 37 °C, in the presence of DMEM/F12 medium
without glucose and serum for 4 h. Reoxygenation was
performed for 24 h in normal conditions after 4 h of
hypoxia exposure. The cells were pretreated with 14,15EET or inhibitors of PI3K and KATP channel, which were
applied for 30 min before treatment with OGD. Normal
control cells were given the same administration except for
OGD. The cultures were used for MTT assay, flow
cytometry, Western Blot analysis and real-time PCR.
Morphological results of different treated SMCs were
shown in Fig. 1c.
Flow Cytometry
Cell apoptosis was detected using flow cytometry as previously published protocol [53]. After the indicated treatments, cells were collected after centrifugating at
1,000 rpm for 5 min, then resuspended at a density of
1 9 106 cells/ml. Cells (500 ll) were mixed with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-Annexin V (5 ll) and propidium iodide (PI; 10 ll, 20 lg/ml) and incubated for 10 min
in the dark at room temperature and analyzed immediately
on a flow cytometer. The FACS Calibur cell sorter (BD
FACSVantage SE; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) was
used for flow cytometric analysis (excitation 488 nm/
emission 530 nm). Each sample was triplicated and the

123

Different concentration of 14,15-EET was added to the
culture medium 30 min before OGD treatment. The survival of the cerebral microvascular SMCs was determined
by 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. After 24 h of OGD and reoxygenation treatment, 10 ll of MTT (0.5 mg/ml) was added per
well and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The optical density
(OD) values at 570 nm was read by microplate spectrophotometer. Untreated cells were considered as control and
the culture medium without cells in the presence of MTT
solution was used as solution background. For the MTT
assay, there were eight samples in each group, and each
sample was repeated at least 3 times. The reading of cell
viability was expressed as the percentage of the untreated
control.
ELISA
14,15-DHET, the stable metabolite of 14,15-EET, was
measured in brain tissue using a commercial ELISA kit
(Detroit R&D, Inc., Detroit, Mich) [20]. Brian tissue was
homogenized and centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 min. The
supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 min
and then briefly extracted 3 times with equal volume of
ethyl acetate under acidic conditions (pH 3–4) with glacial
acetic acid after MCAO surgery. Samples were dried and
extracted 4 times with ethyl acetate and resuspended in
dimethylformamide. 14,15-DHET concentrations were
measured according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Middle Cerebral Arterial Occlusion Surgery
and Reperfusion
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (220–280 g) were used
for middle cerebral arterial occlusion surgery (MCAO) and
reperfusion. We obeyed the regulations and protocol of the
ethics committee of Harbin Medical University during the
experimental procedures. The MCAO model was performed as described previously [54]. The rat was anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate
(350 mg/kg bw). After incising midline skin, the left
external carotid artery was isolated and exposed, and its
branches were inserted with a 4–0 nylon monofilament. A
nylon thread coated with silicon was introduced into the
internal carotid artery through the common carotid artery
for about 18 mm and advanced until faint resistance was
felt. After 90 min of transient MCAO, reperfusion was
performed by withdrawing the nylon thread. Sham-

Neurochem Res (2015) 40:1–14

operated control rats were treated by the same procedure
without filament insertion. The rectal temperature maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C. All surgical procedures were performed under sterile conditions.
Animal Experimental Groups and Drug Administration
The safe dose of AUDA was 0.157–0.314 mg/kg, based on
the previous researches [22]. Rats were randomly classified
into five groups for the in vivo experiment: (1) Sham group
(n = 6); (2) I/R ? vehicle group (DMSO administration,
n = 6); (3) I/R ? low-dose AUDA group (0.157 mg/
kg bw AUDA pretreatment, n = 6); (4) I/R ? mediumdose AUDA group (0.235 mg/kg bw AUDA pretreatment,
n = 6); (5) I/R ? high-dose AUDA group (0.314 mg/
kg bw AUDA pretreatment, n = 6). Three AUDA-treated
groups were administered AUDA dissolved in DMSO
intraperitoneally 30 min before ischemia.
Neurological Function Evaluation
Neurology deficits at 24 h after ischemia were tested following the scoring system based on the five-point scale
system described by Longa et al. [54]. 0 point: normal
spontaneous movements; 1 point: right front leg was flexed
but no circling clockwise; 2 points: circling clockwise; 3
points: spin clockwise longitudinally; and 4 point: unconsciousness and no response to noxious stimulus. All
behavioral evaluations were administered by the same
examiner blinded to the experimental groups.
Evaluation of Infarct Volume
The forebrains were removed briefly and divided into 6
coronal 2 mm thick sections after 90 min of ischemia and
24 h of reperfusion with DMSO or AUDA (n = 7 for each
group) treatment. The coronal sections were incubated in
saline containing 2 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) at 37 °C for 30 min. The infarction volume is presented as a volume percentage of the infarction compared
with the contralateral hemisphere. The percent of hemispheric infarct volume was analyzed as described by Zhang
et al. [20].

11

washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and
placed in the lysis buffer and incubated for 30 min on ice.
To test the effects of AUDA on the expression of Kir6.1
and SUR2B in vivo experiment, rats were executed after
ischemia and reperfusion. The left ischemic penumbra
was removed and pulverized in liquid nitrogen briefly.
The brain tissues were then homogenized and incubated
on ice for 30 min. The cells or the tissues were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at -80 °C for experiments. 15 lg of
protein was subjected to 12 % SDS-PAGE and then
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and then the
nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 5 % bovine
serum albumin (BSA) Western blot analysis was carried
out with antibodies against Akt, phospho-Akt, Kir6.1 and
SUR2B. Immunoreactive bands were identified, and a
densitometric analysis was performed with an enhanced
chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham, USA).
Quantitative Real-Time PCR
Kir6.1 and SUR2B mRNA transcripts were tested by
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Total RNAs from
primary cultured cerebral microvascular SMCs were
extracted by Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 1 lg of total
RNA were reversely transcribed into cDNA using cDNA
synthesis kit. The PCR primers for rat Kir6.1 and SUR2B
were designed according to the published cDNA sequences
(Table 2) Reference. The specificity of the PCR primers
was tested under normal PCR conditions, and the products
of the reaction were electrophoresed through a 1 % agarose
gels. Real-time PCR was performed by SYBR Premix EX
TaqTM in a Bio-Rad IQ5 PCR System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). PCR was performed under the
following conditions: denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, 40
cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C
for 20 s and extension at 72 °C for 20 s, followed by a final
extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Finally, the melting curve
analysis was performed to confirm that a single product
was amplified without primer dimers interfering with the
reaction. The comparative Ct method (2-DDCt) was used
for the relative mRNA quantification.

Western Blot Analysis
Selection of Ischemic Penumbra
To develop the effects of EETs in vitro experiment, different concentration of 14,15-EET was added respectively
to the conditioned medium for 30 min. Rat cerebral
microvascular SMCs were harvested in a buffer containing Tris 50 mM (pH 7.4), NaCl 150 mM, 1 % Triton
X-100, EDTA 1 mM, and PMSF 2 mM. Cells were

Ischemic penumbra was selected according to results of
TTC staining and researches on anatomy location of focal
cerebral ischemia rats, which includes left forehead parietal
lobe and the adjacent ventrolateral neocortex of basal
ganglia infarctions [55–57].

Immunohistochemical Analysis
The brain tissue sections were blocked with 2 % goat
serum for 10 min and then washed with PBS, and cut into
slices. The slices were incubated in citrate buffer solution
for microwave antigen retrieval. The protein of the ischemic penumbra was semi-quantitatively assessed by
immunohistochemistry following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Rabbit anti-rat p-Akt antibody (1:60, Beijing Aosen Biological Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) was added
to the coverslips. The coverslips were incubated overnight
in a humidified container at 4 °C. The following morning,
goat anti-rabbit IgG (Beijing Jinqiao Biotechnology Co.,
Ltd., Beijing, China) was added to the slices, and incubated
at 37 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the 3,30 -diaminobenzidine (DAB) dye was added to visualize the antibodies, and followed by washing of the tissue sections with
PBS solution, the sections were observed and photographed under Moticam 3000 microscopy imaging system.
TUNEL Assay
To observe the protective effect of AUDA on ischemic penumbra, the apoptotic DNA fragmentation was analyzed with
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay using the in situ Cell Death Detection Kit
POD (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Inc., Germany) and
was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The sections were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and treated with 0.3 % H2O2 in
methanol for 10 min, washed in PBS, and permeabilized in
0.1 % Triton X-100 in 0.1 % sodium citrate. Then terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) was added into the sections, which was incubated in a humidified chamber for
60 min then. Further the mixture was incubated with converter-POD for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, DAB was added,
and the sections were incubated for 10 min followed by
washing with distilled water for the coloration of apoptotic
cells. The numbers of TUNEL-positive cells in the ischemic
penumbra were counted in three randomly selected microscopic fields under 4009 magnification in a blind fashion.
Statistical Analysis
All the data are presented as mean ± SD. Differences in
infarct size were analyzed with a t test for two groups, and

123

differences between multiple groups were compared by
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student–Newman–Keuls test. P \ 0.05 was considered statistically significantly.
