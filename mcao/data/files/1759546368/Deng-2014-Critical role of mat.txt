1. Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of death and neurological disability. Despite intensive research efforts, limited progress has been made in the development of pharmacological interventions to reduce ischaemic brain injury.
Contributing factors for this situation include the frequent preclinical
testing of prospective drugs in animals without risk factors for stroke
and the fact that patients suffering from stroke frequently have comorbidities and risk factors for vascular diseases.1
Obesity and its associated metabolic disturbances including hyperlipidaemia have been identified as risk factors for cardiovascular diseases,
diabetes, and many other diseases.2 Obesity prevalence has increased

over the years. About one-third of American adults and 20% of teenagers now are obese.3,4 A high-fat diet (HFD) has been considered a significant contributing factor for the pandemic of obesity in the USA5 and
increased prevalence of obesity and hyperlipidaemia in young adults may
be a major cause of the recent increase in stroke in this age group.6,7
Obesity and hyperlipidaemia also increase the severity of ischaemic
brain injury.8,9 However, very little is known about the mechanism for
this increase.
Cerebral vascular remodelling induced by various pathological stimuli
may contribute to the neurological outcome after brain ischaemia.
Diabetes can induce cerebral vascular remodelling.10 Metformin, a
hypoglycaemic agent, and minocycline can attenuate cerebral vascular

About one-third of American adults and 20% of teenagers are obese. Obesity and its associated metabolic disturbances
including hyperlipidaemia are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases including stroke. They can worsen neurological
outcome after stroke. We determined whether obesity and hyperlipidaemia could induce cerebral vascular remodelling
via matrix metalloproteases (MMP) and whether this remodelling affected neurological outcome after brain ischaemia.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
Six-week-old male CD1, C57BL/6J, and MMP-92/2 mice were fed regular diet (RD) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks.
and results
They were subjected to vascular casting or a 90 min middle cerebral arterial occlusion (MCAO). Mice on HFD were
heavier and had higher blood glucose and lipid levels than those on RD. HFD-fed CD1 and C57BL/6J mice had an
increased cerebral vascular tortuosity index and decreased inner diameters of the middle cerebral arterial root. HFD
increased microvessel density in CD1 mouse cerebral cortex. After MCAO, CD1 and C57BL/6J mice on HFD had a
bigger infarct volume, more severe brain oedema and blood –brain barrier damage, higher haemorrhagic transformation
rate, greater haemorrhagic volume, and worse neurological function. HFD increased MMP-9 activity in the ischaemic and
non-ischaemic brain tissues. Although HFD increased the body weights, blood glucose, and lipid levels in the MMP-92/2
mice on a C57BL/6J genetic background, the HFD-induced cerebral vascular remodelling and worsening of neurological
outcome did not occur in these mice.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
HFD induces cerebral vascular remodelling and worsens neurological outcome after transient focal brain ischaemia.
MMP-9 activation plays a critical role in these HFD effects.

2. Methods
2.1 Animals
All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the University of Virginia (Charlottesville, VA, USA).
All surgical and experimental procedures were carried out in accordance
with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH publications number 23 –80) revised in 2011. All mice
were housed in the vivarium under controlled conditions (23 + 288 C; 12 h
light/dark cycle) with free access to food and water. Male CD1 mice and
C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA,
USA). A pair of MMP-9 knockout (MMP-92/2 ) mice (stock number
007084) from the Jackson laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were bred in
our vivarium to produce mice used in the study. These mice have a
C57BL/6J gene background.

2.2 Feeding
Six-week-old male mice were allowed free access to either HFD (45% of calories supplied by fat; D12451, Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ, USA)
or regular diet (RD; 4.5% of calories supplied by fat; Harland Laboratories,
Dublin, VA, USA) for 10 weeks before they were used in experiments.
Animals were weighed once a week. Non-invasive blood pressure measurement at the end of 10 weeks of feeding was performed using a CODA
monitor (Kent Scientific Corporation, Torrington, CT, USA) as we have
described before.19

2.3 Cerebral vasculature casting
Sixteen-week-old male CD1, C57BL/6J, or MMP-92/2 mice were deeply
anaesthetized with 5% isoflurane and rapidly perfused via the aorta as
described before12 with 378C warm normal saline followed by 3 mL of

20% freshly made vascular casting resin (PU4ii, VasQtech, Zurich, Switzerland) mixed with blue dye. Brains were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 48C overnight.
Stereomicroscopic photos were taken from the top and from the bottom
of the whole brain to determine the interior width of the middle cerebral
artery (MCA) root and the collaterals between the MCA and the anterior
cerebral artery (ACA) or between the MCA and the posterior cerebral
artery (PCA). The vascular tortuosity index was assessed in the medium
sized branches of the MCA. This index was calculated as the real vessel
length divided by the straight-line distance between the two vessel ends.
At least six determinations, each on a different vessel, were performed
to calculate the average tortuosity index for each mouse. The left and
right MCA root interior diameters were measured and averaged. These
determinations were performed by a person who was blinded to the
group assignment of the animals.

2.4 Microvessel density and MCA
wall thickness determination
Sixteen-week-old male CD1 mice under deep isoflurane anaesthesia were
perfused with normal saline followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in
PBS. Brains were harvested and immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 48C
overnight. A brain block containing the MCA root was dissected out, dehydrated, and paraffin embedded. Cross-sections of 5 mm thickness were
obtained to assess the wall thickness of the MCA root. At least six random
determinations, each at different locations of the vessel in the section,
were performed to calculate the average thickness of the MCA for each
mouse. Also, 5 mm-thick coronal sections at Bregma 21.18 mm from the
left and right hemispheres were obtained to assess the microvessel
density. The sections were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse
von Willebrand factor (vWF) antibody (1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by an anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody
conjugated with NL-637 (1:200 dilution; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN,
USA). Microscopic photos of the cerebral cortex were taken with 1/12 s exposure time and ×100 magnification. The mean grey values in five randomly
selected 250 mm2 areas in each animal were determined with Image J
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The mean value of the
five determinations was calculated as the microvessel density index for
each animal. These determinations were performed by a researcher
blinded to the group assignment of the mice.

2.5 Transient middle cerebral arterial occlusion
and neurological outcome assessment
Middle cerebral arterial occlusion (MCAO) in the mice was achieved by an
intraluminal filament technique as we described previously.20 Briefly, mice
were anaesthetized with 1.4 – 1.6% isoflurane carried by pure oxygen.
A small mid-line neck incision was made. The right common carotid artery
and the external carotid artery were dissected. The external carotid
artery was cut open gently and a suture (#1622 for CD1 mice, #1419 for
C57BL/6J and MMP9-/- mice; Beijing Sunbio Biotechnology Co. Ltd,
Beijing, China) was advanced through the cut into the internal carotid
artery until a slight resistance was felt to achieve MCAO. The incision was
infiltrated with 0.2% ropivacaine and the animal was allowed to awaken.
Ninety minutes after the onset of MCAO, the animal was re-anaesthetized
briefly and the suture was retracted into the external carotid artery.
During the surgery to create MCAO, the rectal temperatures of mice
were maintained strictly at 37 + 0.28C with a warming blanket. Their
heart rates and pulse oximeter oxygen saturation (SpO2) were monitored
continuously and non-invasively using a MouseOX Murine Plus Oximeter
System (Starr Life Sciences Corporation, Oakmont, PA, USA).
Motor coordination was evaluated just before and 3 days after the MCAO
for CD1 and C57BL/6J mice and 1 day after MCAO for MMP-92/2 mice as
we described before.20 Mice were placed on a rotarod with the speed
accelerated from 4 to 40 rpm within 5 min. The latency and speed were

remodelling and the worsened neurological function outcome after
transient focal brain ischaemia in diabetic rats. These two drugs also attenuate the increase in activity of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9)
and matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) in the brains of the diabetic
rats.11 HFD feeding increases cerebral blood vessel thickness, reduces
cerebral vessel compliance, and increases brain infarct volumes in rats
as well as increases blood –brain barrier (BBB) permeability and brain
oedema after transient focal brain ischaemia in mice.12,13 However,
the mechanisms for the cerebral vascular remodelling in the animals
fed an HFD, and whether the remodelling contributes to the worsened
neurological outcome after brain ischaemia, have not been investigated.
MMP-2 and MMP-9 are collagenases and gelatinases that exist in the
blood vessels and are proposed to be involved in vascular remodelling.14
These MMPs have been implicated in haemorrhagic transformation (HT)
after brain ischaemia.15 – 17 Their expression can be induced in microglia
and astrocytes in ischaemic brain tissues.18 Increased MMP-9 activity is
considered an important factor for HT after thrombolytic therapy. In
fact, increased MMP-9 may be a biomarker for HT in patients after
thrombolytic therapy.15 Hyperlipidaemia over-activates MMP-9 in the
ischaemic brain tissues.13 Based on these observations, we hypothesize
that a chronic HFD induces cerebral vascular remodelling and worsens
neurological outcome after brain ischaemia via increases in MMP-9 and
MMP-2 activity. To address this hypothesis, we subjected 6-week-old
mice to an HFD for 10 weeks to simulate early onset of obesity in teenagers. Remodelling in the cerebral macrovessels and microvessels and
the ischaemic tolerance of these mice were determined. The role of
MMP-9 and MMP-2 in the vascular remodelling and ischaemic tolerance
was assessed by measuring their activities in the brain tissues and using
gene knockout mice.

recorded when a tested mouse fell off the rod. The speed-latency index,
which is latency (s) × speed (rpm), was calculated. The ratio of this index
obtained after MCAO and before MCAO was calculated to reflect the
change in coordinate function of each mouse.
After determination of the coordinate function, mice were anaesthetized
deeply with 5% isoflurane and intracardially perfused with normal saline.
Brains were cut into 1-mm thick coronal slices. Slices were inspected for
gross HT in the brain parenchyma and then stained with 1% 2, 3,
5-triphenyl-tet razolium chloride solution to evaluate the oedema index
and infarct volume. The infarct area and the areas of the left and right cerebral
hemispheres in each brain slice were quantified using Image J (National
Institutes of Health). Oedema index ¼ right hemisphere volume/left
hemisphere volume. Corrected brain infarct volume in percentage ¼ [left
hemisphere volume 2 (right hemisphere volume 2 right infarction volume)] ×
100 /left hemisphere volume.
Haemorrhagic volume in the brain was determined in the same way as for
measuring infarct volume. Brains were harvested at 24 h after the MCAO and
cut into 1 mm coronal slices. The slices were photographed with a standard
bar in the view. Haemorrhagic volume in each slice was determined after the
haemorrhagic area in the right hemisphere was delineated by using a Wacom
Bamboo drawing pad. The sum of haemorrhagic volumes in the right hemisphere slices was calculated. The percentage value of this sum of volumes
relative to the left hemisphere volume was then determined for each mouse.

haemoglobin A1c measurements

2.7 IgG extravasation evaluation
Sixteen-week-old C57BL/6J mice or MMP-92/2 mice fed with RD or HFD
for 10 weeks were subjected to sham surgery or a 90 min right MCAO.

2.8 MMP activity assessment
Sixteen-week-old CD1 mice fed RD or HFD for 10 weeks were subjected
to sham surgery or the 90 min right MCAO. Animals were perfused with
ice-cold normal saline at 6 h after the onset of ischaemia and brains were
harvested. The right hemisphere Fr1, separated from the rest of cerebral
cortex, and the striatum were stored at 2808C until use. Total, cytoplasmic
and nuclear protein were extracted from these brain tissues according to
Abcam’s nuclear fractionation protocol except that dithiothreitol was
omitted from buffer A in the cytoplasmic protein extraction to preserve
MMP activity. Sixty micrograms of cytoplasmic protein were used in the
MMP zymographical assay. Total cellular and nuclear fractions were adjusted
to 2 mg protein/mL, denatured by boiling in loading buffer and saved at
2208C for western blotting.
Gelatin zymography for measuring MMP-9 and MMP-2 activity was performed as described before.25 Sixty micrograms of protein in 30 mL were
mixed with 5 × sample buffer. Forty-five-micrograms of protein per lane
were loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin and subjected to electrophoresis. Gelatinolytic activity was revealed after incubating
the gels with re-naturing buffer (2.5% Triton x-100), developing buffer (0.5%
Coomassie blue G-250 in 30% methanol and 10% acetic acid), then

The random and 6 h fasting blood glucose levels of 16-week-old mice that
had been on RD or HFD for 10 weeks were measured with a glucose strip
method using blood from the tails. Blood collected from CD1 and C57Bl/
6J mice just before sacrifice at 72 h after the MCAO and from MMP-92/2
mice before sacrifice for cerebral vasculature casting were tested for the
concentrations of blood lipids and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) by the
central laboratory of the University of Virginia Hospital. Plasma insulin
levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (mouse
insulin kit; Shibayagi, Gunma, Japan).

Sham surgery was performed by making the neck incision and dissecting
the common carotid artery but without the MCAO. Mice under deep anaesthesia at 24 h after brain ischaemia or sham surgery were perfused with
normal saline followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissue preparation
was the same as for microvessel density evaluation. Five-micrometre thick
coronal sections at Bregma 20.98 were obtained and incubated with
anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:1000
dilution; Santa Cruz, Biotechonology). The sections were incubated with diaminobenzidine and mounted. Pictures were taken in the right frontal cerebral cortex area 1 (Fr1) and the right striatum. Quantification of IgG
extravasation was done as we have described before.21 Briefly, three independent microscopic fields were acquired randomly in the right Fr1 (an ischaemic penumbral region) and the right striatum (an ischaemic core)22 – 24
of each section. Three sections per mouse were imaged. Positively stained
areas were quantified by the number of pixels per image with intensity
above a predetermined threshold level as determined using Image J 1.47n
software and expressed as the percentage of the positively stained area in
the total area of interest in the microscopic field. All quantitative analyses
were performed in a blinded fashion.

antibodies (1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Protein bands were
revealed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method and analysed
with a gel imaging analysis system (G-Box, Syngene, Frederic, MD, USA).

2.9 Western blotting
The samples for western blotting of MMP-9 were prepared as described in
Section 2.8 (MMP activity assessment). For western blotting of endothelial
nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and phospho-eNOS, the right Fr1 and striatum
were harvested 24 h after the MCAO and homogenized in Pierce RIPA
buffer (#89901; Thermo Scientific, Worcester, MA, USA) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (#P2714; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (#04906845001; Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis,
IN, USA). Homogenates were centrifuged at 13 000 rpm at 48C for 20 min
and the supernatants were collected for western blotting.
Approximately 30 mg of total cellular protein per lane were loaded onto
10% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred
onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and then incubated overnight
at 48C with primary antibodies. The primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody (1:500 dilution; Aviva Systems Biology, San
Diego, CA, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-eNOS antibody (1:500 dilution;
Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), rabbit polyclonal antiphospho-eNOS (ser1177) antibody (1:500 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology), and rabbit polyclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) antibody (1:5000 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Blots
were washed with PBS-Tween, and incubated with appropriate secondary

2.10 Statistical analysis
Parametrical data are presented as means + SD. Statistical analysis of these
results was carried out by t-test or two-way analysis of variance followed by
the Tukey test as appropriate. The HT frequencies were analysed by the
Fisher exact method. A P ≤ 0.05 was accepted as significant. All statistical
analyses were performed with SigmaStat (SYSTAT Software Inc., Point Richmond, CA, USA).

3.1 HFD-induced obesity and
hyperlipidaemia
Although the starting body weights of the two groups of CD1 wild-type
male mice were similar, the mice fed HFD were heavier, and had higher
levels of random and fasting blood glucose and blood HbA1c than did
those fed RD. The HFD also increased blood cholesterol, triglycerides,
and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Although high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) also was increased by feeding the HFD, the ratio of LDL/HDL

and the ratio of cholesterol/HDL were higher than those in mice fed the
RD (Table 1). These results suggest that HFD feeding for 10 weeks
induces obesity, hyperglycaemia, and hyperlipidaemia in the CD1
mice. The homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) of the insulin resistance index was increased from 0.591 + 0.249 (n ¼ 8) in mice fed with
RD to 0.949 + 0.377 (n ¼ 8) in mice fed HFD (P ¼ 0.042), suggesting
that HFD feeding induces insulin resistance. The mean arterial blood
pressures were 82 + 9 mmHg (n ¼ 7) or 87 + 11 mmHg (n ¼ 6), respectively, for the mice fed RD or HFD for 10 weeks (P ¼ 0.413), suggesting that HFD feeding for 10 weeks does not change significantly
the blood pressure.

3.2 HFD-induced cerebral vascular
remodelling
HFD feeding increased the tortuosity index of the MCA medium size
branches but did not affect the number of collaterals between MCA
and ACA or between MCA and PCA in the CD1 mice (Figure 1). HFD
feeding also decreased the inner width of the MCA root (Figure 1) and

477
increased the wall thickness of the MCA root (Figure 2). Mice fed HFD
had an increased microvessel density as determined by the expression
of vWF (Figure 2), an endothelial cell marker. These results indicate
that HFD feeding causes remodelling of both cerebral macrovessels
and microvessels.

3.3 HFD worsened neuropathological and
functional outcome and increased MMP-9
activity in brain tissues
To determine the effects of HFD on brain ischaemic tolerance, we subjected the CD1 mice to a 90 min right MCAO. There was no significant
difference in heart rates, SpO2, and body temperature at the onset of
brain ischaemia between the CD1 mice fed RD and those fed HFD
(Figure 3). HFD feeding increased the brain oedema index, infarct
volumes, HT frequency, and haemorrhagic volume, and worsened the
neurological functions as assessed by the performance on a rotarod
(Figures 4 and 5). These results suggest that HFD worsens neurological
outcome after transient focal brain ischaemia.

The MMP-9 activity was increased in the ischaemic brain tissues. This
increase was enhanced by HFD feeding in the ischaemic cerebral cortex.
HFD also increased MMP-9 activity in the non-ischaemic brain tissues.
Although MMP-2 activity was increased in the ischaemic core tissues
(striatum), MMP-2 activity in the ischaemic and non-ischaemic brain
tissues was not changed by HFD (Figure 6). These results suggest that
MMP-9 may be more important than MMP-2 in mediating the
HFD-induced cerebral vascular remodelling and worsening of neurological outcome after brain ischaemia.
The MMP-9 protein expression in the ischaemic striatum was significantly decreased in both RD- and HFD-fed mice. MMP-9 expression
in the cerebral cortex was not changed by brain ischaemia or HFD
(Figure 7).

3.4 MMP-9 knockout attenuated
HFD-induced vascular remodelling and
worsening of neurological outcome
Since our results implicated a role of MMP-9 in the HFD-induced
cerebral vascular remodelling, we used MMP-92/2 mice to further
determine this role. Since these mice have a C57BL/6J mouse gene
background, we first confirmed that HFD-induced cerebral vascular
remodelling in the C57BL/6J mice as indicated by increased tortuosity
index and smaller inner width of the MCA root in the mice fed HFD
than those in the mice fed RD (Figure 1). C57BL/6J mice on the HFD
also were heavier and had a higher level of blood HbA1c, cholesterol,
triglycerides, LDL (Table 1 and Figure 3), and HOMA insulin resistance
index (0.402 + 0.1 of the mice fed RD vs. 0.716 + 0.198 of the mice
fed the HFD, n ¼ 7, P ¼ 0.003) than those on RD. HFD-fed mice also
had poorer neurological outcome after brain ischaemia than the mice

on RD (Figures 4 and 5). HFD feeding also increased damage of the
BBB in the Fr1 as assessed by IgG extravasation (Figure 8). These
results suggest that pathological changes similar to those in the CD1
mice were induced by HFD in the C57BL/6J mice.
Similar to the CD1 and C57BL/6J wild-type mice, HFD feeding
increased the body weights as well as blood glucose, HbA1c, and lipid
levels in the MMP-92/2 mice (Table 1). However, the tortuosity index
of the MCA branches, inner width at the MCA root, wall thickness of
MCA root, microvessel density in the cerebral cortex, and neurological
outcome, including BBB damage after transient focal brain ischaemia
were not affected by HFD feeding in the MMP-92/2 mice (Figures 1, 2,
4, and 8). Also, the haemorrhagic volumes in the MMP-92/2 mice fed
HFD after MCAO were smaller than those in the C57BL/6J mice fed
HFD (Figure 5). These results suggest that MMP-9 plays a critical role
in the HFD-induced cerebral vascular remodelling and worsening of
brain damage after focal brain ischaemia–reperfusion. Interestingly,
phospho-eNOS was increased in the ischaemic brain tissues in the
RD-fed C57BL/6J mice. Activation/phosphorylation of eNOS is a protective mechanism.26 The increase of phospho-eNOS in the ischaemic
brain tissues was inhibited by HFD feeding. A similar pattern of changes
occurred in the MMP-92/2 mice, suggesting that loss of MMP-9 has
minimal impact on this protective mechanism. The expression of eNOS
was not significantly affected by HFD feeding in either C57BL/6J or
MMP-92/2 mice (Figure 9).

4. Discussion
Vascular complications of obesity, including stroke, are increasing as
obesity has become pandemic, with onset in younger patients. An
HFD is considered to be a major contributor to the obesity.5 To

closely simulate early onset obesity and hyperlipidaemia in humans, we
fed outbred CD1 mice an HFD starting when the mice were 6 weeks old.
Ten weeks of HFD-induced obesity, hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia,
and insulin resistance in the mice. These features capture very well the
presentations of obesity in humans.
There is a lack of knowledge about cerebral vascular remodelling in
patients with obesity and hyperlipidaemia, especially in young adult
patients with these pathological conditions. Feeding 3-week-old rats
an HFD for 10 weeks has been shown to increase the wall thickness of
the MCA and to decrease the compliance of this vessel.12 Our study
extends these findings by showing that HFD increased the tortuosity
of major MCA branches, decreased the inner width of the MCA root,
and increased the microvessel density in the cerebral cortex of the
CD1 mice, indicating that remodelling in both cerebral macrovessels

and microvessels is induced by an HFD. Hypertension also can induce
vascular remodelling and brain pathology.27 However, consumption of
an HFD for 10 weeks did not increase significantly the blood pressure
in the CD-1 mice, suggesting that the HFD may not induce cerebral
vascular remodelling through hypertension.
Mechanisms for HFD-induced cerebral vascular remodelling have
not been studied; however, previous studies have shown that there is significant cerebral remodelling in diabetic rats;10,11 and that diabetic rats
have increased MMP-9 activity in the cerebral macrovessels. MMP-2
activity is not changed in the cerebral vessels of diabetic rats. Chronic
use of metformin, a hypoglycaemic drug, and minocycline, an antiinflammatory agent that also can inhibit MMP, reduces the cerebral vascular remodelling and also attenuates MMP-9 activity in the cerebral
vessels of the diabetic rats.11 These results suggest a significant

480

association between cerebral vascular remodelling and MMP-9 activity
under diabetic conditions. MMP-9 and MMP-2 are the major gelatinases.14 They can degrade and stimulate matrix deposition, leading to
restructuring of blood vessels and the surrounding matrix.14
A major finding of our study is that MMP-9 plays a critical role in the
HFD-induced cerebral vascular remodelling. Our results showed that
the HFD-induced obesity, hyperglycaemia, and hyperlipidaemia in
MMP-92/2 mice, as it did in CD1 mice. However, the HFD did not
induce cerebral vascular remodelling in the MMP-92/2 mice as it did
in the CD1 mice. HFD also induced cerebral vascular remodelling in
the wild-type C57BL/6J mice that share genetic background with the
MMP-92/2 mice. These results argue strongly that HFD-induced
cerebral vascular remodelling requires MMP-9. Consistent with this
finding, our study also showed that HFD increased MMP-9 activity but
did not affect MMP-2 activity in the brain tissues.
Our results suggest that the HFD-induced increase in MMP-9 activity
and the subsequent cerebral vascular remodelling contribute to the
worsened neurological outcome after brain ischaemia. Hyperlipidaemia
has been shown to increase ischaemic brain injury,9,12,28 although controversial findings on the effects of hyperlipidaemia on brain ischaemic
tolerance have been reported.29,30 Direct evidence for a contribution

of diabetes- or HFD-induced cerebral vascular remodelling to neurological outcome after brain ischaemia has not been reported in humans
or animals. Our results showed that the HFD worsened the neurological
outcome after transient focal brain ischaemia in both CD1 and C57BL/6J
mice but did not change the neurological outcome in the MMP-92/2
mice. Since HFD also did not induce cerebral vascular remodelling in
the MMP-92/2 mice, the results would suggest that the HFD-induced
cerebral vascular remodelling contributes to the worse neurological
outcome after brain ischaemia. However, since MMP-9 knockout can
reduce ischaemic brain injury in mice,31,32 it is possible that the lack of
worsening of neurological outcome in the MMP-92/2 mice fed HFD is
due to MMP-9 knockout alone and is not the result of the lack of cerebral
vascular remodelling in these mice. Nevertheless, our study showed that
the neuropathological and functional outcomes, including brain infarct
volumes, oedema index, IgG extravasation, coordination, and HT frequency, were similar between the C57BL/6J mice and MMP-92/2

mice fed the RD. This finding argues for the involvement of HFD-induced
cerebral vascular remodelling in the worsened neurological outcome
after brain ischaemia for the wild-type mice fed the HFD.
Previous studies have shown that MMP-9 activity in ischaemic brain
tissues is increased in the early phase after transient focal brain ischaemia. MMP-9 knockout mice have smaller infarct volumes and attenuated
damage to BBB integrity. These findings establish the damaging role of
MMP-9 in ischaemic brain injury.31,32 Our study showed that the
C57BL/6J and MMP-92/2 mice fed the RD had similar magnitudes of
brain infarct volume, oedema index, IgG extravasation, diminished coordination, and HT frequency after brain ischaemia. These results do
not suggest that MMP-9 plays a major role in the ischaemia-induced
brain cell death and BBB damage in the RD-fed mice. The reasons for
the discrepant findings between our studies and the previous studies
are not known. Similar brain ischaemia models created with a suture
technique were used in our study and the previous studies.31,32
However, our MMP-92/2 mice have a C57BL/6J gene background and
the MMP-92/2 mice used in the previous studies had a CD1 gene background.31,32 Also, we used 16-week-old mice and the age of the mice
used in the previous studies was not specified in the reports.31,32
HT is a complication of ischaemic stroke. MMPs, especially MMP-9,
have been implicated in the development of HT.15 – 17 Our results

showed that the HT frequency in the C57BL/6J and MMP-92/2 mice
fed RD was similar. A similar result was reported in a recent study,
although MMP-92/2 mice had smaller haemorrhagic volumes in the
cerebral cortex than the wild-type mice after a suture-induced
MCAO. The haemorrhagic volumes in the basal ganglia was similar
between the MMP-92/2 and wild-type mice.33 On the other hand,
increased haemorrhage and brain oedema in the MMP-92/2 mice
have been reported in a collagenase-induced intracerebral haemorrhage
model.34 Nevertheless, our results showed that HFD feeding activates
MMP-9, consistent with a previous study.13 Haemorrhagic volumes
after MCAO were increased in the C57BL/6J mice fed HFD but not in
the MMP-92/2 mice fed HFD when compared with the corresponding
RD-fed mice. The haemorrhagic volumes in the HFD-fed MMP-92/2
mice were smaller than those in the HFD-fed C57BL/6J mice. These
results suggest that MMP-9 plays a critical role in haemorrhage after
brain ischaemia in the mice with hyperlipidaemia.
Our study suggests that the HFD-induced increase in MMP-9 activity
in the ischaemic and non-ischaemic brain tissues is not due to the
increased MMP-9 protein expression. HFD did not increase MMP-9
protein in the brain tissues. Instead, MMP-9 protein expression was
decreased in the ischaemic striatum of HFD- and RD-fed mice. This decrease may be due to the cell death in the ischaemic core tissues. These
results underscore the importance of measuring the activity of MMPs in
the ischaemic brain tissues. Various factors, such as tissue plasminogen
activators, can activate MMPs.35 – 37 Future studies are needed to determine how an HFD can activate MMP-9 in the brain.
We focused on determining the role of MMP-9 but not MMP-2 in the
HFD-induced cerebral remodelling and worsening of ischaemic brain
injury because HFD increased MMP-9 activity in the ischaemic and nonischaemic brain tissues. Although MMP-2 activity in the ischaemic striatum was higher than that in the non-ischaemic striatum, HFD did not
affect the MMP-2 activity in the ischaemic and non-ischaemic brain
tissues. These results do not suggest a role for MMP-2 in the HFD
effects. In support of this suggestion, MMP-9 knockout abolished the
HFD-induced cerebral vascular remodelling and worsening of ischaemic
brain injury.
Activation of eNOS has been shown to be protective against ischaemic brain injury.26 Hyperlipidaemia can attenuate the activation of
eNOS.38,39 Consistent with these previous findings, our study showed
that phospho-eNOS was increased in the ischaemic brain tissues of
C57BL/6J mice and that this increase was inhibited in the mice fed
with HFD. A similar pattern of changes in the phospho-eNOS level occurred in the MMP-92/2 mice, suggesting that eNOS activation may not
be affected significantly in these knockout mice. Therefore, the ineffectiveness of HFD on worsening ischaemic brain injury in the MMP-92/2
mice may not be due to altered eNOS activation in these mice.
Our study has limitations. MMP-9 is expressed not only in the blood
vessels but also in brain cells, such as neurons.40,41 We used brain tissues
for measuring MMP-9 activity and expression, so the results reflect
MMP-9 activity and expression in all cells in the tissues. Thus, we do
not know from our study the cell origin of the MMP-9 that is important
for the HFD-induced cerebral vascular remodelling and worsening of ischaemic injury after brain ischaemia. MMP-9 secreted from one type of
cell may move around and should work on extracellular matrix around it.
Thus, MMP-9 from all types of cells may contribute to the cerebral vascular remodelling (macrovessels and microvessels) and the BBB damage
in the ischaemic brain tissues. Also, we did not specifically use any drugs
to maximally dilate all blood vessels before vascular casting. It is possible
that different wall thicknesses and diameters of MCA root between the

MMP-9 in HFD-induced cerebral vascular remodelling

RD- and HFD-fed mice are due to different vascular tones of mice fed
these two diets. However, the mice were anaesthetized with 5% isoflurane, a very powerful vascular dilator,42 before the vascular casting; and
the blood pressure of RD- and HFD-fed awake mice was similar.
Finally, the degree of increase in some lipids, such as LDL, in the
MMP-92/2 mice may be smaller than that in the CD-1 mice after HFD
feeding. This smaller increase may contribute to the ineffectiveness of
the HFD on cerebral vascular remodelling and ischaemic brain injury
in MMP-92/2 mice. However, the degree of increase of those lipids in
the HFD-fed C57BL/6J was even smaller than those in the MMP-92/2
mice and HFD still induced cerebral vascular remodelling and more
severe ischaemic brain injury in C57BL/6J mice.
In summary, we have shown that HFD feeding of 6-week-old mice for
10 weeks increased the body weights, blood glucose, and lipid levels in
the CD1, C57BL/6J, and MMP-92/2 mice. The HFD feeding also
induced cerebral vascular remodelling and worsening of neurological
outcome after brain ischaemia in the CD1 and C57BL/6J mice but not
in the MMP-92/2 mice. These results suggest that MMP-9 plays a critical
role in the HFD-induced cerebral vascular remodelling and decrease of
brain ischaemic tolerance.
