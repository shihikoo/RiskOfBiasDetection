Allicin, one of the main biologically active compounds derived from garlic, has been shown to exert
various pharmacological activities and is considered to have therapeutic potential for many pathologic
conditions. In the present study, we investigated the potential post-ischemic neuroprotective effects of
allicin and its underlying mechanisms. Using a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, we
found that intraperitoneal treatment with 50 mg/kg allicin signiﬁcantly reduced brain infarct volume,
attenuated cerebral edema and decreased the neurological deﬁcit score. Allicin treatment also diminished TUNEL positive cells and inhibited the activation of caspase-3 after MCAO. These protective effects
could be observed even if the administration was delayed to 6 h after injury. In addition, we evaluated
the in vitro protective effects of allicin against oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) induced neuronal injury
in primary cultured cortical neurons. Allicin (50 mM) increased neuronal viability, decreased lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) release and inhibited apoptotic neuronal death after OGD. These protective effects
could be observed even if the administration was delayed to 4 h after injury. Furthermore, allicin
signiﬁcantly increased the expression of sphingosine kinases 2 (Sphk2) both in vivo and in vitro. Pretreatment with the Sphk2 inhibitor ABC294640 partially reversed the protective effects of allicin against
MCAO and OGD injury, indicating that an Sphk2-mediated mechanism was involved in allicin-induced
protection in our models. The combination of ﬁndings suggests that post-injury administration of allicin has potential as a neuroprotective strategy for ischemic stroke.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in
the world, and according to data from the American Heart Association, the overall stroke prevalence has not changed over the past
decade (Go et al., 2014). Without effective intervention, the number
of deaths globally is projected to rise to 6.5 million in 2015 and to
7.8 million in 2030 (Strong et al., 2007). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective treatments for ischemic stroke.
Allium sativum, usually known as garlic, is a common food and

has long been valued in Asian folk medicine (Bolton et al., 1982).
Allicin (diallyl thiosulﬁnate, chemical structure shown in Fig. 1) is a
major component of garlic and a precursor of many secondary
products formed in aged garlic and crushed garlic preparations. It is
formed during the chopping, crushing or chewing of garlic cloves
through a chemical interaction between alliin, a sulfur-containing
amino acid, and the enzyme allicinase (Lawson and Gardner,
2005). Allicin has been shown to exert a variety of beneﬁcial effects, such as anti-inﬂammatory, anti-microbial, anti-fungal, antiparasitic, anti-hypertensive and anti-cancer activities (Borlinghaus
et al., 2014). Allicin could protect cells against oxidative stress by
inducing the generation of antioxidant products, thereby reducing
cytotoxic substances and scavenging free radicals (Chan et al.,
2013). More recently, allicin was shown to exert neuroprotective
activity against traumatic or ischemic neuronal injury by regulating
oxidative stress and apoptosis-related cascades (Chen et al., 2014;
Liu et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2014). However, in the vast majority

of previous experiments, allicin was administered prior to injury,
which might be problematic in clinical trials because of the difﬁculty in obtaining informed consent.
Various signaling transduction pathways are triggered in
response to cerebral ischemia. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), one
of the sphingolipid metabolites, has recently been shown to function as an important bioactive molecule that controls many cellular
processes, such as proliferation and survival (Okada et al., 2009).
Sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 (Sphk1 and Sphk2) convert S1P and
are the rate-limiting enzymes in the process of endogenous S1P
generation (Bryan et al., 2008). Due to their neuron-speciﬁc functions, such as the regulation of neurotransmitter release, these two
Sphk isoforms are considered to play important roles in several
neurological disorders (Okada et al., 2009). The expression of
Sphk2, but not of Sphk1, is enhanced by short-duration ischemia
that induces preconditioning protection (Wacker et al., 2009).
Consequently, the induction of Sphk2 by neuroprotective strategy
acts, through neuronal and microvascular mechanisms, to mediate
ischemic tolerance (Wacker et al., 2012; Yung et al., 2012). More
recently, Sphk1 was shown to mediate neuroinﬂammation
following cerebral ischemia.
Considering the pharmacological properties of allicin and previous studies on the subject, in the present study, we asked
whether allicin has protective effects against ischemic brain injury
in vivo and in vitro, and whether post-injury administration of allicin could be beneﬁcial in brain ischemia models. In addition, we
also investigated the potential underlying mechanisms with a focus
on sphingosine kinases (Sphks).
2. Materials and methods
2.1. In vivo model of brain ischemia
Adult male SD rats weighing 280e300 g were obtained from the
Laboratory Animal Center of the Fourth Military Medical University
(FMMU). All experimental protocols and animal handling procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes
of Health (NIH) guidelines for the use of experimental animals and
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of the FMMU. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used to
induce focal cerebral ischemia according to previously published
methods (Chao et al., 2010). Brieﬂy, rats were anesthetized using 2%
isoﬂurane in oxygen and placed in a stereotaxic frame. Ischemia
was produced by advancing the tip of a rounded 0.32 mm nylon
suture into the right internal carotid artery through the right
external carotid artery. After 60 min of occlusion, the thread was
withdrawn to allow reperfusion. The animal's core body temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5  C with a thermostatically
controlled heating pad during surgery. Sham-operated animals
received midline neck incisions. The right common carotid artery
was isolated, but not cut. In allicin-treated groups, animals were
intraperitoneally treated with 50 mg/kg allicin at different time
points (3, 6 or 9 h) after MCAO. The vehicle group rats were

The wetedry method was used to determine brain edema after
ischemia. Rats were killed by decapitation under deep anesthesia,
and the brain was quickly removed. Tissue samples from the
injured hemispheres were dissected and weighed immediately to
obtain the wet weight. The dry weight was determined after
heating the tissue for 48 h at 100  C. Brain water content was then
calculated using the following formula: %H2O ¼ (1  dry weight/
wet weight)  100%.
2.3. Assessment of neurological deﬁcit score
Neurological deﬁcit scores were measured according to Bederson's method (Bederson et al., 1986). Five categories of motor
neurological function were scored: 0: no observable neurological
deﬁcits, 1: torso turning to the contra lateral side when lifted by the
tail, 2: decreased resistance to lateral push, 3: circling or walking to
the right side, 4: unable to walk spontaneously and a depressed
level of consciousness.
2.4. Evaluation of infarct volumes
Brain infarct area was evaluated using 2, 3, 5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. After obtaining the
neurological deﬁcit score, the rats were killed and the brains were
sectioned into 2 mm-thick coronal slices. Coronal brain slices were
stained in 2% TTC at 37  C for 15 min in the dark and then photographed. The infarct tissue areas were measured using Image-Pro
Plus software. To account for edema, the infarcted area was estimated by subtracting the uninfarcted region in the ipsilateral
hemisphere from the contralateral hemisphere, and the infarct volume was expressed as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere.
2.5. TUNEL staining
Neuronal apoptosis was measured by TUNEL staining. In brief,
brain sections of 4 mm thick were cut and treated with proteinase K
solution (20 mg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature to permeabilize
the tissues. TUNEL staining was performed by labeling the tissues
with a ﬂuorescein TUNEL reagent (Red) mixture for 60 min at 37  C
according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol, and the tissues
were examined under a ﬂuorescence microscopy. The number of
TUNEL-positive cells was counted by an investigator blinded to the
grouping.
2.6. Measurement of caspase-3 activity
The activity of caspase-3 was measured using a colorimetric
assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cell
Signaling, MA, USA). Brieﬂy, cell and tissue homogenates were
mixed with 32 ml of assay buffer and 2 ml of 10 mM Ac-DEVD-pNA
substrate, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured after incubation at 37  C for 4 h. Absorbance of each sample was determined by subtracting the mean absorbance of the blank and
corrected by the protein concentration of the cell lysate. The results
were described as relative activity compared to the control group.
2.7. Primary cultures of cortical neurons
Cortical neurons were cultured from SD rats according to previously published methods (Chen et al., 2012). Brieﬂy, cerebral

94

cortices were removed from embryos at 16e18 days, stripped of
meninges and blood vessels and minced. Tissues were dissociated
by 0.25% trypsin digestion for 15 min at 37  C and gentle trituration.
Neurons were resuspended in a Neurobasal medium containing 2%
B27 supplement and 0.5 mM L-glutamine and plated at a density of
3  105 cells/cm2. Neurons were maintained at 37  C in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2 incubator and half of the culture medium was changed
every other day. The cultured neurons were used for studies on
in vitro days 8e10 (DIV 8e10).
2.8. In vitro model of ischemic neuronal injury
Cortical neurons were treated with oxygen glucose deprivation
(OGD) to mimic ischemia neuronal injury in vitro. To initiate OGD,
the culture medium was removed and rinsed with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) three times. The cultured neurons were
placed into a specialized, humidiﬁed chamber containing 5% CO2,
and 95% N2 at 37  C with glucose-free DMEM, which was pregassed with N2/CO2 (95%/5%) to remove residual oxygen. After a
1 h challenge, neurons were removed from the anaerobic chamber,
and the culture medium was replaced with Neurobasal medium
containing 2% B27 supplement and 0.5 mM L-glutamine to generate
the reperfusion insult.
2.9. Neuronal viability

2.12. Measurement of cytochrome c release
Cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm was assessed after
subcellular fraction preparation. Cultured cortical neurons were
washed with ice-cold PBS three times and lysed with a lysis buffer
containing protease inhibitors. The cell lysate was centrifuged for
10 min at 750 g at 4  C, and the pellets containing the nuclei and
unbroken cells were discarded. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 15,000 g for 15 min. The pellet fraction containing the
mitochondria was further incubated with PBS containing 0.5%
Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4  C. After centrifugation at 16,000 g for
10 min, the supernatant was collected as a mitochondrial fraction.
The levels of cytochrome c in the mitochondrial fractions were
measured using the Quantikine M Cytochrome C Immunoassay kit
obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Data were
expressed as ng/mg protein.
2.13. Western blot analysis
Equivalent amounts of protein (40 mg per lane) were loaded,
separated by 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were blocked with a 5%
nonfat milk solution in tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100
(TBST) for 1 h, and then incubated overnight at 4  C with the
following primary antibody dilutions in TBST: anti-Sphk1 (1:800),
anti-Sphk2 (1:1000) and anti-b-actin (1:500). Then, the membranes were washed and incubated with a secondary antibody for
1 h at room temperature. The analyses of the results were performed using the Quantity One program, and the Sphk1 and Sphk2
expression levels were normalized to b-actin.

A neuronal viability assay was performed using the cell proliferation reagent WST-1 following the manufacturer's protocol
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Brieﬂy, cortical neurons were cultured
at a concentration of 5  104 in microplates in a ﬁnal volume of
100 ml per well culture medium. After various treatments, 10 ml
WST-1 was added into each well, and the microplates were incubated for 4 h at 37  C. Then, 100 ml culture medium and 10 ml WST-1
were added into one well without neurons, and its absorbance was
used as a blank position for the ELISA reader. Cells were shaken
thoroughly for 1 min on a shaker and the absorbance of the samples
was measured using a microplate reader.

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0, a statistical
software package. Statistical evaluation of the data was performed
by ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc tests. A value of p < 0.05
was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

2.10. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay

3. Results

Neuronal cytotoxicity was determined by the release of LDH into
the culture medium using a diagnostic kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Brieﬂy, 50 ml of supernatant from each well
was collected to assay the LDH release. The samples were incubated
with a reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotid (NADH)
and pyruvate for 15 min at 37  C, and the reaction was stopped by
adding 0.4 M NaOH. The LDH activity was calculated from the
absorbance at 440 nm and background absorbance from the culture
medium that was not used for any cell cultures was subtracted from
all absorbance measurements.

2.11. Flow cytometry
After OGD injury and allicin treatment, cortical neurons were
harvested, washed with ice-cold Ca2þ free PBS, and re-suspended
in a binding buffer. Cell suspension was transferred into a tube
and double-stained for 15 min with the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated
annexin V (AV) and propidium iodide (PI) at room temperature in
the dark. After the addition of 400 ml binding buffer, the stained
neurons were analyzed by an FC500 ﬂow cytometer with the
ﬂuorescence emissions set at 530 nm and >575 nm. The CXP cell
quest software (BeckmaneCoulter, USA) was used to count the
number of AVþ/PI and AVþ/PIþ cells and analyze the results.

2.14. Statistical analysis

To test the effects of post-injury administration of allicin on
ischemic brain damage, animals were treated with 50 mg/kg allicin
at 3, 6 or 9 h after ischemia initiation. Signiﬁcant decreases in brain
water content (Fig. 2A) and neurological deﬁcit score (Fig. 2B) were
observed when allicin was administered at 3 and 6 h after injury,
but not effects could be detected when the treatment was delayed
to 9 h. In line with these protective effects, allicin treatment at 3
and 6 h, but not at 9 h, signiﬁcantly reduced the infract volume in
the cortex, striatum and total hemisphere compared to vehicletreated rats (Fig. 2C).
3.2. Allicin inhibits neuronal apoptosis after cerebral ischemia
To determine whether allicin-induced protection against cerebral ischemia was due to its anti-apoptotic activity, TUNEL staining
was used to detect apoptotic cells in brain slices at 24 h after
reperfusion (Fig. 3A). The results showed that allicin treatment at 3
and 6 h signiﬁcantly reduced the number of TUNEL positive cells
compared with the vehicle group, but allicin treatment at 9 h was
not effective (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3C, a similar result on
caspase-3 activity was also observed.

was evaluated by measuring brain water content (A), and the neurological deﬁcit score was assayed (B). The infarct volume in the cortex, striatum and total hemisphere was
measured by TTC staining and corrected for edema (C). Data are shown as the mean ± SD (n ¼ 6). #p < 0.05 vs. Sham. *p < 0.05 vs. Vehicle.

3.3. Allicin protects against OGD-induced neuronal injury in vitro
To conﬁrm the protective effects of allicin in vitro, OGD was
performed in primary cultured cortical neurons to mimic ischemic
neuronal injury. The results showed that allicin treatment at 2 and
4 h signiﬁcantly increased the neuronal viability (Fig. 4A) and
decreased the LDH release (Fig. 4B) after OGD injury, whereas allicin treatment at 6 h was not effective.
3.4. Allicin decreases apoptotic neuronal death after OGD
To investigate the anti-apoptotic activity of allicin in vitro, ﬂow
cytometry was used to detect neuronal apoptosis in our in vitro
model (Fig. 5A). The results showed that allicin treatment at 2 and
4 h signiﬁcantly reduced the apoptotic rate compared with the OGD
group, but allicin treatment at 6 h was not effective (Fig. 5B). In line
with these results, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, as evidenced by the OGD-induced decrease in mitochondrial cytochrome
c content, was partially reversed by allicin added at 2 or 4 h
(Fig. 5C). As shown in Fig. 5D, a similar result was also observed for
caspase-3 activity.
3.5. Effects of allicin on the expression of Sphk1 and Sphk2 after
ischemia
To explore the molecular mechanism underlying allicin-induced
protection, the expression of Sphk proteins was detected by western blot analysis in our in vitro and in vivo models. In the cerebral
ischemia animal model, the expression of Sphk1 was increased by
ischemia, but allicin did not alter its expression (Fig. 6A). Ischemia
injury signiﬁcantly decreased Sphk2 protein expression in brain

tissues, which was prevented by allicin treatment (Fig. 6A). In primary cultured neurons, a similar effect on Sphk1 expression was
also observed (Fig. 6B). However, allicin treatment signiﬁcantly
increased Sphk2 expression in both the presence and absence of
OGD injury in neurons (Fig. 6B).
3.6. Involvement of Sphk2 in allicin-induced neuroprotection
To further elucidate the role of Sphk proteins in allicin-induced
protective effects, 5C (2 mg/kg in vivo or 4 mM in vitro) and
ABC294640 (10 mg/kg in vivo or 10 mM in vitro) were used to inhibit
Sphk1 and Sphk2 activity, respectively. Pretreatment with 5C alone
could reduce brain water content (Fig. 7A) and infarct volume
(Fig. 7B) in vivo, and it also preserved neuronal viability (Fig. 7C)
and inhibited the LDH release (Fig. 7D) in vitro. However, 5C pretreatment had no effects on allicin-induced protective effects. In
contrast, pretreatment with ABC294640 alone had no effects on
brain damage and neuronal injury, but it partially prevented allicininduced protection in our in vivo and in vitro models.
4. Discussion
The present study evaluated the neuroprotective effects of allicin against cerebral ischemia both in vivo and in vitro. These
beneﬁcial effects are thought to be brought about by the activation
of Sphk2, as the administration of the Sphk2 inhibitor ABC294640
dampened the protection induced by allicin. In contrast, the activation of Sphk1 after ischemia injury is not involved in allicininduced protection, although treatment with the Sphk1 inhibitor
5C without allicin could attenuate brain damage and neuronal
injury in our models. Thus, it can be speculated that the allicin

treatment induces cerebral ischemic tolerance through activation
of Sphk2.
For the current study, we selected a dose of 50 mg/kg allicin
based on previous results, which showed that intraperitoneal
administration of 50 mg/kg allicin improved neurological outcomes
and reduced contusion volumes in traumatic brain injury models
(Chen et al., 2014). This dose could also prevent neuronal loss and
mitochondrial dysfunction after spinal cord ischemiaereperfusion
injury in rabbits (Zhu et al., 2012). Consistent with previous in vitro
experiments, 50 mM allicin was used in primary cultured cortical
neurons in our study, and this concentration was demonstrated to
exert no obvious toxicity in neuronal cells (Zhou et al., 2014). In
addition, post-injury administration was performed to determine
the therapeutic time window of allicin. To date, no clinical trial
evaluating neuroprotective compounds has succeeded in demonstrating clinical efﬁcacy in ischemic stroke injured patients (Amaro
and Chamorro, 2011; Chen et al., 2011b). One of the most important
problems is that in the vast majority of preclinical experiments the
treatment agents are administered prior to injury. In the present

study, we found that allicin is still effective even if the administration is delayed to 6 h after MCAO, and it also attenuates neuronal
injury when it is added 4 h after OGD. These results might be more
relevant to clinical practice. In a previous study using primary
cultured cortical neurons, allicin was shown to exert neuroprotective effects against traumatic neuronal injury even if allicin
treatment was delayed to 2 h after injury (Zhou et al., 2014). In
addition, the protective effects of allicin against traumatic brain
injury could be observed even if the administration was delayed to
4 h after injury (Chen et al., 2014). The differences in therapeutic
time windows of allicin might be due to the different in vitro and
in vivo models used, which needs to be further determined.
Although many natural products with antioxidant activity are
shown to have neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia,
allicin has unique advantages (Borlinghaus et al., 2014; Chen et al.,
2011a). First, as a natural product, garlic has been prized for thousands of years as a culinary herb and for its medicinal qualities
(Chan et al., 2013). It can be quickly and almost completely absorbed orally (approximate 95%), and one study showed that 6e18 mM

allicin could be detected in blood when 1e3 cloves of fresh garlic
were consumed per day (Horev-Azaria et al., 2009). Therefore, the
concentration of allicin used in the present study can easily be
obtained in the daily diet of human beings, and this makes our data
more relevant to clinical practice. This high permeability of allicin
may be attributed to its low molecular weight and favorable lipophilic properties, which allow it to freely permeate through the
phospholipid bilayers and the bloodebrain barrier (Miron et al.,

2000). In addition, allicin is generally regarded as stable in nature. The half-life of allicin is about one year at 4  C, and the biological half-life of allicin is even longer than its chemical half-life in
all cases except when it is dissolved in vegetable oil (Fujisawa et al.,
2008). A human in vivo study revealed that the active metabolite of
allicin was found to accumulate to its maximum level 4 h after
consumption and remain detectable for 30 h (Lawson and Wang,
2005). Furthermore, several previous studies showed that allicin

at the dose or concentration used in the present study exerts no
toxicity in neuronal cells and animal models (Chen et al., 2014;
Zhou et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2012). All of these data strongly suggest that allicin might be an ideal candidate for ischemic stroke
drug research.
In response to cerebral ischemia, various signaling transduction
pathways were triggered. Thus, investigation of related signaling
cascades underlying brain ischemia is useful for the identiﬁcation
of targets for the treatment of stroke. Sphingosine 1-phosphate
(S1P), one of the sphingolipid metabolites, was recently shown to
function as an important bioactive molecule that control many
cellular processes such as proliferation and survival (Okada et al.,
2009). It is formed when the enzyme sphingosine kinase (Sphk1
or Sphk2) catalyzes the binding of a phosphate group to sphingosine (Van Brocklyn and Williams, 2012). Due to their neuronspeciﬁc functions, such as the regulation of neurotransmitter
release, these two Sphk isoforms are considered to play important
roles in several neurological disorders (Okada et al., 2009). In our
study, 1 h of MCAO and 2 h of OGD both resulted in signiﬁcant
increases in the expression of the Sphk1 protein, which is consistent with a recent study using the same model (Zheng et al., 2015).
However, in a previous experiment, the cerebral protein levels of
Sphk1 were shown to be markedly reduced in the ischemic core at
24 h after ischemia (Hasegawa et al., 2013), and this contrary
ﬁnding might be explained by the universal degradation of cellular
proteins in dying cells in the ischemic core. In addition, we found
that the expression of Sphk2 was signiﬁcantly reduced by MCAO
in vivo or by OGD in vitro, indicating the possible different roles of
Sphk1 and Sphk2 in brain ischemia pathogenesis. Our results were
observed in neurons that were still adherent after OGD in vitro and
in the cortical penumbra in vivo, which is an area that consists of
potentially viable and reversibly injured tissues (Lo, 2008). These
results need to be further conﬁrmed over a longer time period and
in other brain ischemia models.
Sphk1 and Sphk2 show different subcellular localizations and
enzymatic properties, as well as different expression patterns in

various tissues (Bryan et al., 2008). They could even exert opposite
effects on cell survival and death in tumor cell proliferation and
myocardial injury models. It has been shown that down-regulation
of Sphk1 activates pro-apoptotic events such as the release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase family proteins (Taha
et al., 2006), whereas SphK2 overexpression results in the inhibition of proliferation or apoptosis (Igarashi et al., 2003). The Sphk1
knockout mice were more sensitive to cardiac ischemiaereperfusion injury and responded poorly to ischemic pre- and
post-conditioning (Karliner, 2009). Intriguingly, our present results
using selective Sphk inhibitors showed that both in vivo and in vitro
ischemia injury were attenuated by the Sphk1 inhibitor 5C, but the
Sphk2 inhibitor ABC294640 had no effects. These data strongly
suggest that Sphk1 activation after cerebral ischemia might be lethal to neurons. Sphks are known to be activated by different
mechanisms involving protein phosphorylation, proteinelipid
binding, proteineprotein interactions, and calcium/calmodulin
(Urtz et al., 2004). Thus, they could have the opposite functions in
cell survival and death in various tissues. Sphk1 and Sphk2 may
differently regulate memory mechanism, as well as the pathology
of excitotoxicity and epilepsy, through the Sphk/S1P pathway
(Okada et al., 2009). Both our in vivo and in vitro results indicated
that allicin signiﬁcantly increased the expression of Sphk2 in the
presence or absence of ischemic injury. In addition, the protection
induced by allicin treatment was partially prevented by
ABC294640, but not by 5C. These data suggest that Sphk2 activation
is a pro-survival mechanism that mediates allicin-induced protection in cerebral ischemia models.
In conclusion, this study revealed that post-injury treatment
with allicin, an active substance of garlic, protects against cerebral ischemic injury both in vivo and in vitro. These protective
effects were partially dependent on the activation of Sphk2 and
followed anti-apoptotic activity. This compelling evidence suggests that allicin might be an ideal candidate for the development of new neuroprotective agents for the treatment of
ischemic stroke.

Fig. 7. Involvement of Sphk2 in allicin-induced neuroprotection. Animals were treated with MCAO and 50 mg/kg allicin in the presence or absence of Sphk1 inhibitor 5C (2 mg/kg)
or Sphk2 inhibitor ABC294640 (10 mg/kg). Brain edema was evaluated by measuring brain water content (A), and the infarct volume in the total hemisphere was measured by TTC
staining and corrected for edema (B). Cortical neurons were treated with OGD and 50 mM allicin in the presence or absence of Sphk1 inhibitor 5C (4 mM) or Sphk2 inhibitor
ABC294640 (10 mM). The neuronal viability was measured with the WST assay (C), and the cytotoxicity was measured with the LDH release assay (D). Data are shown as the
mean ± SD (n ¼ 6). A and B: #p < 0.05 vs. Sham. *p < 0.05 vs. MCAO. &p < 0.05 vs. MCAO þ Allicin. C and D: #p < 0.05 vs. Control. *p < 0.05 vs. OGD. &p < 0.05 vs. OGD þ Allicin.
