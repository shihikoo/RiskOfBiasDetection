Abstract
Background: Since thrombolysis is the only approved intervention for ischemic stroke, improving its efficacy and safety
is a therapeutic aim of considerable interest. The activated
form of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) has
antifibrinolytic effects, and inhibition of TAFI might thus
favor recanalization. The present study compared efficacy
between TAFI inhibition alone and TAFI inhibition in combination with rtPA at a suboptimal dose, in a murine model of
thromboembolic stroke. Methods: Focal ischemia was induced in mice by thrombin injection in the middle cerebral
artery. Animals were placed within the magnet immediately
after surgery for baseline MRI (H0). MRI examination comprised diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), and T2-weighted imaging (T2-WI). Ani-

saline, rtPA 5 mg/kg (tPA5: suboptimal or low dose), rtPA 10
mg/kg (tPA10: standard dose), TAFI-I 100 mg/kg (TAFI-I), and
rtPA 5 mg/kg + TAFI-I 100 mg/kg (tPA5 + TAFI-I). Treatments
were administered inside the magnet, via a catheter placed
in the tail vein, using a power injector, as 10% bolus and 90%
infusion over a period of 20 min. MRI examination was repeated at 3 h (H3) and 24 h (H24) after surgery. Therapeutic
benefit was evaluated by: (1) improvement of reperfusion
and (2) reduction in final lesion size. Microhemorrhages were
assessed as black spots on T2-WI at H24. Animals were sacrificed after the last MR examination. The surgeon and all investigators were blinded to treatment allocation. Results: A
total of 104 mice were operated on. Forty four of these were
excluded from the study and 27 from the analysis, according
to a priori defined criteria (no lesion or no mismatch), leading
to the following distribution: saline (n = 6), tPA5 (n = 8), tPA10
(n = 7), TAFI-I (n = 7), and TAFI-I + tPA5 (n = 5). Standard-dose

Introduction

Several randomized controlled trials (NINDS,
ECASSII, ECASSIII) [1–3] demonstrated the benefit of
recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) treatment in stroke. However, intracerebral hemorrhage is an
especially feared side effect of rtPA [4], and dose-finding
studies suggest that the higher the dose, the greater the
risk of hemorrhage [5–7]. In this context, the search for
thrombolytic therapies providing comparable efficacy
with lower risk is a critical issue for therapeutic strategy.
Endogenous resistance to tissue-type plasminogen
activator (tPA) may decrease the benefit of thrombolysisinduced recanalization [8]. This resistance may be due in
part to thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor
(TAFI). TAFI removes residues from partially degraded
fibrin, which eliminates plasminogen-binding sites and
thus inhibits plasminogen activation. Enhancement of
fibrinolysis is a promising approach in thrombotic disease [9, 10], and a combination of a suboptimal dose of
rtPA and TAFI-inhibitor has been shown to increase fibrinolytic activity in a lung model of thromboembolism
[11].
A new rodent model of thromboembolic stroke, consisting in situ microinjection of thrombin into the middle
cerebral artery (MCA), was recently described [12]. The
natural evolution of this model (without intervention)
was characterized on MRI, the main finding being a significant rate of spontaneous reperfusion in the first hours
after the formation of a stable clot [13]. In this model, intravenous injection of rtPA at a dose of 10 mg/kg 20–30
min after surgery mimics thrombolysis treatment in the
clinical setting, with cerebral blood flow (as measured by
laser Doppler flowmetry) returning to baseline 30–60
min after the beginning of treatment [12, 14–16].
TAFI-Inhibitor Combined with rtPA in
Thromboembolic Stroke

The present study sought to compare the efficacy of
TAFI inhibition alone (using the TAFI inhibitor FFC.
HTZ4.059 from Sanofi (Germany)) and TAFI inhibition combined with a suboptimal dose of rtPA (5 mg/
kg), in this murine model of thromboembolic stroke.
The lack of translational success in stroke treatment
trials has led the community to develop a framework to
improve the quality of preclinical stroke studies [17].
The present experiments were therefore conducted in
compliance with the STAIR guidelines (sample size calculation, prior definition of exclusion criteria, randomization of treatments, allocation concealment, reporting
of animals excluded from analysis, blinded assessment
of outcome, reporting of conflict of interest, and study
funding), using noninvasive MRI follow-up. Control
groups comprised treatments with saline, with rtPA at
suboptimal dose (5 mg/kg) and with standard-dose
rtPA (10 mg/kg).

Materials and Methods
Animals
The animal investigations were conducted in conformity with
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published
by the European Union (EEC Council Directive 86/609) and the
French regulation (D2001–486) regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes. Protocol  approval was granted by our University ethics review board
(CeLyne: Comité d’Ethique Lyonnais pour les Neurosciences Expérimentales). Adult male Swiss mice (25–30 g, Janvier, France) were
used. Animals were housed under standard conditions with a
12 h light/dark cycle and allowed access to food and water ad libitum.
Overall Protocol
In brief, focal ischemia was induced using the thromboembolic model by in situ thrombin injection. Successfully operated animals were randomly assigned to 1–5 treatment groups: saline, rtPA
5 mg/kg (tPA5: suboptimal or low dose), rtPA 10 mg/kg (tPA10:
standard dose), TAFI-I 100 mg/kg (TAFI-I), or rtPA 5 mg/kg +
TAFI-I 100 mg/kg (tPA5 + TAFI-I). The animals were placed within the magnet immediately after surgery for baseline MRI (H0).
MRI examination comprised diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI),
perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), and T2-weighted imaging
(T2-WI) (total examination time: 30 min).
Exclusion criteria were:
– no DWI and/or PWI lesion on H0 MRI;
– no PWI/DWI mismatch on H0 MRI, with mismatch defined as
a lesion volume ratio PWI/DWI >110% [18];
– animal death within 30 min of stroke onset;
– animal with incomplete longitudinal data set.
Treatments were delivered inside the magnet, via a catheter
placed in the tail vein, using a power injector, in the form of a 10%
bolus initiated 10 min after MCA occlusion followed by 90% infu-

alone did not. On the other hand, combined treatment with
tPA5 + TAFI-I showed only a trend toward lesion regression
(–49 ± 26%), similarly to treatment with tPA10, but not significantly different from saline (p = 0.46). Nine animals
showed microhemorrhage on T2-WI at H24. These animals
were evenly distributed between groups. Conclusions: The
present study showed that the combination of TAFI-I with a
suboptimal dose of rtPA is not as effective as the standard
dose of rtPA, while TAFI inhibition alone is not effective at all.
The thromboembolic model is of particular interest in assessing rtPA association to improve thrombolysis, especially
when coupled with longitudinal MRI assessment.

Induction of Focal Cerebral Ischemia
Mice were anesthetized with 1–2% isoflurane in ambient air. A
catheter was inserted into the tail vein for intravenous administration. The rectal temperature was kept at 37 ± 1 ° C throughout the
surgical procedure, using a feedback-regulated heating pad. Surgery was conducted as previously described [12]. Briefly, a craniotomy was performed between the right eye and right ear to expose
the MCA. After excision of the dura, one microliter of purified
murine alpha-thrombin (0.75 IU, Sigma-Aldrich, Lyon, France)
was pneumatically injected into the MCA lumen. In situ clot formation was monitored visually.
 

 

Treatment
The TAFI-inhibitor FFC.HTZ4.059 was synthesized by Sanofi (Germany). FFC.HTZ4.059 is a highly potent TAFI inhibitor
(TAFI-I) displaying an IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of 2 nM in diluted human or murine plasma. In-vitro clot
lysis was determined using thromboelastometry in various species. Comparable profibrinolytic activity was obtained across all
tested species, including human samples. FFC.HTZ4.059 is selective against many other proteases, including some major players in the coagulation cascade (–5–5% inhibition at 100 μ M for
tPA, urokinase, plasmin, tryptase, trypsin, h-chymotrypsin,
(plasma) kallikrein, C1s, APC, FXa, FVIIa, FIIa, FIXa, FXIa, and
FXIIa). It had no significant inhibitory action on any of the 108
targets tested in a large selectivity panel to check for the risk of
side-effects (no hits at 10 μ M; CEREP, Poitiers, France). It does
not affect platelet aggregation up to 100 μ M in human plateletrich plasma.
TAFI-I and rtPA (Actilyse, Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany)
were stored desiccated in amber vials in a refrigerator. The treatments were solubilized in saline (pH 8). The solutions were freshly made for each experiment.
The FFC.HTZ4.059 dose (100 mg/kg) was defined by the sponsor based on data obtained from in vitro clot lysis assays in mice
and human plasma in the presence of different rtPA concentrations, using a TAFI-I with comparable pharmacological profile, in
order to determine the optimal ratio between rtPA and TAFI-I
doses to be used in murine models. Two rtPA doses were tested:
the standard dose for this model (10 mg/kg [12]) and a suboptimal
dose (5 mg/kg), alone or in combination with TAFI-I.
MR Imaging
MRI experiments were performed using a Bruker Biospec
7T/12 cm horizontal magnet equipped with Paravision 5.1. A birdcage head-coil of 72-mm inner diameter was used for RF transmission and a 15-mm diameter surface coil for reception. The animal
was placed in a nonmagnetic holder equipped with a nose-cone for
administration of anesthetic gas (1.5% isoflurane), stereotaxic ear
bars, an integrated water-heating system to maintain body temperature at 37 ± 1 ° C, and a pressure probe to monitor respiration.
The MR examination comprised:

– T2-weighted images (T2-WI), acquired using a RARE sequence
with matrix = 256 × 128, FOV = 2 × 1 cm2, TE/TR = 20/3,500
ms, and RARE factor 4;
– Diffusion-weighted echo-planar spin-echo images (DWI), acquired using the same FOV, with matrix = 128 × 64, TE/TR =
19/5,000 ms and 7 b-values of 0, 100, 200, 300, 500, 800 and
1,000 s/mm2;
– Perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), using single-slice pulsed
arterial spin labeling (PASL) as an alternative perfusion method not requiring injection of contrast agent. PASL was performed using a flow-sensitive alternating inversion-recovery
echo-planar imaging (FAIR-EPI) sequence with matrix = 96 ×
48, FOV = 2 × 1 cm2, inversion recovery time (TIR) = 40–2,500,
number of TIR values = 22, recovery time = 10,000 ms, and TE/
TR = 10/18,000 ms.
T2-WI and DWI acquisitions were performed using the same
set of 15 contiguous slices (slice thickness, 0.8 mm), covering the
entire MCA territory, while PASL was performed using the central
slice only for technical reasons.
MR Image Analysis
Apparent diffusion coefficient maps (ADC, in mm2/s) were
calculated by fitting MR signal curves to a monoexponential model function on a pixel-by-pixel basis, using in-house software written in Matlab 2009 (MathWorks, Natick, Mass., USA).
PASL images were analyzed with the ASL_Perfusion_Processing macro from the Paravision 5.1 software platform (Bruker,
Ettlingen, Germany), using a blood T1 value of 2,200 ms [19]. Cerebral blood flow (CBF, in ml/min/100 g) was derived from the
nonselective and selective T1 maps according to:
CBF = λ.T1 nonselective/T1 blood (1/T1 selective – 1/T1 nonselective), where λ is the blood-brain coefficient, estimated at 90
ml/100 g.
DWI, PWI, and final lesions were outlined manually respectively on ADC maps, CBF maps and T2-WI with MIPAV software
(Medical Image Processing and Visualization, NIH, Bethesda,
Md., USA; http://mipav.cit.nih.gov/) by delineating areas of signal
drop on the ADC and CBF maps and areas of signal enhancement on T2-WI. Perfusion deficit regression between H0 and H3
was evaluated as: ΔVCBF (%) = [PWI (H3) – PWI (H0)] / PWI
(H0). Reperfusion was defined as a 50% reduction in perfusiondeficit volume between H0 and H3 [20]. Ischemic lesion regression between H0 and H24 was evaluated as: ΔVT2–ADC (%) = [T2
(H24) – DWI (H0)] / DWI (H0).
Statistical Analysis
The analyses were performed on SAS software 9.2 for Windows. The number of animals to be included in each group was
calculated based on a power analysis using G*Power 1.3 [21], assuming an effect size of 1.5 (i.e., a standard deviation of 25% and a
treatment effect of 40% based on our own pilot study comparing
results obtained with tPA versus saline treatment) and setting α at
5% and 1–β at 80% (statistical power), for the non-parametric Wilcoxon test. The sample size thus obtained was 7 animals per group.
The lesion volumes were collected as continuous variables. For
each arm, the data were described using means, standard deviations, medians, quartiles, and ranges. The baseline DWI and PWI
lesions in the 5 arms were compared using the non-parametric
Kruskal-Wallis test (one-way analysis of variance). The non-parametric Wilcoxon test was used for all other comparisons.

sion over a period of 20 min. MRI examination was repeated at
3  h  (H3) and 24 h (H24) after surgery. Therapeutic benefit was
evaluated in terms of: (1) improvement of reperfusion and (2) reduction in final lesion size as primary endpoint. Micro-hemorrhages were assessed as black spots on T2-WI at H24. Animals
were sacrificed after the last MR examination. The surgeon and all
investigators were blinded to treatment allocation.

A total of 104 mice were successfully operated on between January and July 2013. Forty four of these were excluded: 26 did not show an ADC lesion, 1 did not show a
CBF lesion, 11 died within 30 minutes of stroke onset, and
in 6 cases there was technical failure (catheter problems).
A total of 60 mice (12 per treatment group) were thus included. Twenty seven of these were excluded from analysis because they did not have a complete longitudinal data
set (n = 5) or did not fulfill the mismatch criteria (PWI/
DWI >110% [18]) (n = 22). Analysis was therefore performed on the following samples: saline (n = 6), tPA5
(n = 8), tPA10 (n = 7), TAFI-I (n = 7), and TAFI-I + tPA5
(n = 5).

Figure 1 shows a longitudinal multiparametric MR
exam for one animal. Well-defined focal DWI lesion and
PWI deficit were observed in the cortex and the dorsal
part of the striatum. Final infarct appeared as hyperintense areas on follow-up (H24) T2-weighted images.
There were no significant differences in baseline DWI
and PWI volumes between treatment groups (table  1,
Kruskal-Wallis test, DWI: p = 0.49, PWI: p = 0.33).
Figure 2 shows perfusion deficit regression between
H0 and H3 in each treatment group. All animals showed
regression. Reperfusion (defined as >50% lesion regression) was observed in 30% of the animals treated with
saline, in 29% of those treated with TAFI-I, and in 25% of
those treated with tPA5. In contrast, 57% of the animals
treated with tPA10 and 60% of those treated with TAFI-

greater lesion regression in the groups treated with tPA10
(–56 ± 32%) and with tPA5 + TAFI-I (–49 ± 29%), no significant difference with respect to the group treated with
saline (–37 ± 24%) was demonstrated (Kruskal-Wallis

(tPA5) (Wilcoxon test, tPA10 vs. tPA5, p = 0.02). Treatment with TAFI-I alone did not improve lesion regression compared to saline (Wilcoxon test, TAFI-I vs. saline,

(–57 ± 18%), although the difference with respect to treatment with saline (–36 ± 21%) did not reach significance
(Wilcoxon test, tPA5 + TAFI-I vs. saline, p = 0.46). The
difference between tPA5 + TAFI-I and tPA5 alone was
close to significant (Wilcoxon test, tPA5 + TAFI-I vs.

Nine animals showed microhemorrhage on T2-WI at
H24. These animals were evenly distributed between
groups (saline, n = 3; tPA5, n = 2; tPA10, n = 0; TAFI-I,
n = 1; tPA5 + TAFI-I, n = 3).

Discussion

Since thrombolysis remains the only approved intervention for ischemic stroke, improving its efficacy and
safety is a therapeutic aim of considerable interest.
Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) was
discovered two decades ago, following the identification
of an unstable carboxypeptidase formed upon thrombin
activation of its proenzyme. The antifibrinolytic effects of
the activated form are linked with its capacity to remove
C-terminal lysine from the surface of the fibrin clot. Inhibition of TAFI might thus favor recanalization, even
though the importance of TAFI in pathophysiological
fibrinolysis remains to be precisely determined. The maDurand  et al.

jority of the fibrinolysis and thrombosis models performed in TAFI-deficient mice suggest that TAFI does
not play a primary role in regulating fibrinolysis in vivo
[22]. In particular, TAFI deficiency was not protective in
a mouse model of transient MCA occlusion using the intraluminal thread approach [23].
The present study shows that FFC.HTZ4.059 inhibition of TAFI alone was not sufficient to reduce the final
lesion size compared to treatment with saline in a murine
thromboembolic model of stroke. This finding confirms
and extends the results obtained in a rat model of arterial
thrombosis, which showed that exogenous tPA was necessary for antithrombotic activity of TAFI inhibition [24].
The combination of TAFI inhibitor with a suboptimal
dose of rtPA appeared more effective than TAFI inhibitor
alone or a suboptimal dose rtPA alone, suggesting a possible synergistic effect between the two drugs. Again, this
is in line with the previous studies on various animal
models of thrombosis, showing that exogenous tPA is
more effective when TAFI is inhibited [25, 26]. However,
the heterogeneity of responses to the drug combination
prevented any significant improvement in outcome being
demonstrated (standard deviation of 50% of the mean in
the group treated with tPA5 + TAFI-I compared to 30%
in the group treated with tPA10 only). Despite rigorous
animal inclusion based on per-occlusion imaging criteria
that were defined before starting the study (presence of a
DWI lesion, a PWI deficit, and a PWI/DWI mismatch),
standard deviations were greater than hypothesized (50%
instead of 25%). At the same time, this drastic selection
resulted in lower sample sizes than expected in some of

the groups (n = 6 animals in the saline group and n = 5
animals in the tPA5 + TAFI-I group, instead of 7). Treatment with the standard dose of rtPA (10 mg/kg) had the
expected clear impact on lesion size reduction compared
to treatment with saline. However, the study may have
been insufficiently powered to detect benefit with the
combined treatment. The observed variability was probably due in part to spontaneous reperfusion occurring in
all groups. An increased dose of thrombin might stabilize
the clot, although at the expense of lysis rate by rtPA. Nevertheless, this 5-arm trial was exploratory and should help
design a further 2-arm trial (tPA5 + TAFI-I group vs.
tPA5) with a greater number of animals per group.
As DWI/PWI mismatch is increasingly used to define
the eligibility of stroke patients for thrombolysis, MRI
measures are becoming an important component of
translational research. Performing MRI during occlusion
allowed the rigorous selection of animals showing penumbra, thus ensuring that ischemic lesion regression at
H24 was due to treatment and not to failure of the animal
model. The rate of spontaneous reperfusion at H3 was
elevated (one third of animals), in agreement with previous findings [13]. To our knowledge, the present study is
the first to report early reperfusion following thrombolytic therapy in this mouse model. Although an overall
impression emerged that tPA10 actually improved reperfusion (in terms of both rate and lesion regression), we
were not able to demonstrate a significant difference
compared to saline. This might be explained in part by the
fact that the perfusion deficit was assessed from a single
slice, due to the technical limitations of PASL. This slice

Limitations
The present study had several limitations. First of all,
the thrombin used for generating emboli is known to activate TAFI, platelets, and PAI-1 in circulation. Thus, this
thrombin-clot model may not have mimicked the clinical
situation closely. However, since all the animals received
the same alpha thrombin concentration, this can be considered as a bias, and should in fact have favored the
group that received TAFI-I (alone or in combination with
rtPA), which was obviously not the case. Nevertheless, a
clot injection model might be an interesting alternative
for testing TAFI inhibition, although it shows high variability and mortality [27].
Second, we did not perform a dose-response study as
advised in the initial STAIR recommendations [17, 28],
because this would have meant increasing the number of
treatment groups. In addition, we did not evaluate the
functional outcome, although this would have been a desirable endpoint in complement to final lesion size, according to the STAIR criteria. The thromboembolic
model used in the current study is based on distal MCA
occlusion and therefore leads to cortical injury with small
infarction volume, which does not induce consistent
functional deficits. This model should therefore be reserved for studying clot-related mechanisms, which other
stroke models cannot address [29]. In the literature, various strategies for assessing neurological deficit have been
described (use of an activity box to monitor locomotor
activity [12] or extended behavioral testing [14, 15]), and
we originally intended to perform functional testing in a
second experiment, including only groups with positive
findings versus the saline group; however, since the effects on final lesion size were modest, we finally did not
pursue this objective.
Third, our results with the suboptimal dose of rtPA are
in contradiction with those of El Amki et al., who reported a dose as low as 0.9 mg/kg, when administered early,
to be as effective in terms of infarct volume reduction as
the standard ‘rodent’ dose of 10 mg/kg [15]. However,
neither the extent of the initial perfusion defect nor the
initial size of the lesion was measured in their study. The
variability of the model and differences in experimental
procedure can account for these conflicting results. Further investigation should be conducted in order to better
understand the dose-effect relationship in this model.

Conclusions

Improving thrombolysis therapy by recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in acute ischemic stroke
remains a challenge. Adjunctive antithrombotic agents,
such as inhibitors of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), may enhance the efficacy of rtPA. In the
present study, a combination of TAFI-I and a low dose of
rtPA was not as effective as the standard dose of rtPA in
terms of the final lesion size reduction, while TAFI inhibition alone was not effective at all. Despite its limitations,
the murine model of thromboembolic stroke based on in
situ thrombin injection is of particular interest for assessing rtPA association strategies to improve thrombolysis,
especially when coupled with longitudinal MRI assessment.

more sensitive. Refinement of the MR sequences will help
overcome this limitation in the future.
