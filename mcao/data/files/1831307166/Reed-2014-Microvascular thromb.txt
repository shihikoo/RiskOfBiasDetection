Objective—Ischemic stroke is primarily attributable to thrombotic vascular occlusion. Elevated α2-antiplasmin (a2AP) levels
correlate with increased stroke risk, but whether a2AP contributes to the pathogenesis of stroke is unknown. We examined
how a2AP affects thrombosis, ischemic brain injury, and survival after experimental cerebral thromboembolism.
Approach and Results—We evaluated the effects of a2AP on stroke outcomes in mice with increased, normal, or no
circulating a2AP, as well as in mice given an a2AP-inactivating antibody. Higher a2AP levels were correlated with
greater ischemic brain injury (rs=0.88, P<0.001), brain swelling (rs=0.82, P<0.001), and reduced middle cerebral artery
thrombus dissolution (rs=−0.93, P<0.001). In contrast, a2AP deficiency enhanced thrombus dissolution, increased
cerebral blood flow, reduced brain infarction, and decreased brain swelling. By comparison to tissue plasminogen
activator (TPA), a2AP inactivation hours after thromboembolism still reduced brain infarction (P<0.001) and hemorrhage
(P<0.05). Microvascular thrombosis, a process that enhances brain ischemia, was markedly reduced in a2AP-deficient
or a2AP-inactivated mice compared with TPA-treated mice or mice with increased a2AP levels (all P<0.001). Matrix
metalloproteinase-9 expression, which contributes to acute brain injury, was profoundly decreased in a2AP-deficient or
a2AP-inactivated mice versus TPA-treated mice or mice with increased a2AP levels (all P<0.001). a2AP inactivation
markedly reduced stroke mortality versus TPA (P<0.0001).
Conclusions—a2AP has profound, dose-related effects on ischemic brain injury, swelling, hemorrhage, and survival after
cerebral thromboembolism. By comparison to TPA, the protective effects of a2AP deficiency or inactivation seem to
be mediated through reductions in microvascular thrombosis and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression.   (Arterioscler

schemic stroke affects 16.9 million people a year worldwide; it kills >5.4 million and disables millions of others.1
Thrombotic obstruction of a cerebral artery may be triggered
by thromboembolism, plaque rupture, atrial fibrillation, and
other vascular events.2,3 Thrombotic occlusion initiates a cascade of events that cause neuronal cell death, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, breakdown of the blood
brain barrier with brain swelling, hemorrhage, morbidity,
and mortality.2–6 Downstream from a thrombotic occlusion,
ischemia may trigger the formation of microvascular thrombi
that cause further reductions in blood flow, thereby enhancing
blood brain barrier breakdown and ischemic tissue injury.2,3,7
Clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated that tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), which initiates the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, dissolves occlusive thrombi
to improve outcomes after ischemic stroke.4 However, there
is little known in ischemic stroke about the role of molecules
that regulate fibrinolysis downstream of TPA.

α2-Antiplasmin (a2AP) is a serine protease inhibitor that
rapidly inhibits plasmin.8 Most a2AP circulates in the blood,
but a portion is crosslinked to fibrin by activated factor XIII
during thrombus formation.9 Recent studies have emphasized
the role of thrombus-bound a2AP in regulating fibrinolysis or
dissolution of pathological thrombi.8,9 Circulating a2AP inhibits circulating plasmin 100- to 1000-fold more efficiently than
it inhibits fibrin or thrombus-bound plasmin; this has led some
to propose that a primary role of circulating a2AP is to prevent bleeding by preventing the degradation of coagulation
factors.10,11 However, recent studies indicate that high levels
of circulating a2AP contribute to the failure of TPA therapy
to dissolve thrombi and restore blood flow during ischemic
stroke.12–14 Moreover, genetic deletion of a2AP protects against
ischemic brain injury induced by nonthrombotic permanent
surgical ligation of the middle cerebral artery.15,16 Yet, within
the neuronal and vascular compartments, a2AP and serpins

In this report, we investigated how circulating and thrombus-bound a2AP affect endogenous fibrinolysis, microvascular thrombosis, hemorrhage, brain injury, and other outcomes
in an experimental thromboembolic model with translational
relevance to human ischemic stroke. We find that thrombusbound a2AP modulates dissolution of the culprit thromboembolus, whereas circulating a2AP activity also has dynamic,
deleterious effects on the development of microvascular
thrombosis, MMP-9 expression, brain injury, hemorrhage,
disability, and death after cerebral thromboembolism.

Results

(Figure 1C; P<0.001). There was a significant positive doserelated correlation between a2AP levels and brain infarction
(Spearman’s r=0.88; P<0.001).
In these experiments, we monitored the dissolution of
125
I-fibrin–labeled MCA thromboemboli (formed with pooled
normal a2AP+/+ plasma) at 6 hours to assess brain injury during a time when thrombus dissolution was still dynamic, as
suggested by our pilot studies. By comparison to mice with
normal physiological levels of a2AP, mice with increased
blood levels of a2AP had markedly decreased dissolution
of the MCA thrombus (Figure 1D; P<0.01). In contrast, the
dissolution of the MCA thrombus was accelerated in a2APdeficient versus mice with normal a2AP levels (Figure 1D;
P<0.001) or versus mice with increased levels of circulating
a2AP (Figure 1D; P<0.001). There was a significant negative
correlation between the level of circulating a2AP and dissolution of the MCA thromboembolus (Spearman’s r=−0.93;
P<0.001). There was no significant relationship between
a2AP levels and hemorrhage (Figure 1E).
Brain swelling is one of the more serious complications of
proximal MCA thrombosis. Brain swelling was significantly
greater in mice with high circulating levels of a2AP than with
normal a2AP levels (Figure 1F; P<0.01) or a2AP-deficient
mice (Figure 1F; P<0.001). There was a significant positive
correlation between circulating a2AP levels and brain swelling (Spearman’s r=0.82; P<0.001).

Dose-Related Effects of Circulating a2AP
on Cerebral Thromboembolism

Effects of Thrombus-Bound a2AP on
Outcomes in a2AP-Deficient Mice

If a2AP activity directly contributes to the pathogenesis of
stroke after thromboembolism, there should be a dose relationship between circulating levels of a2AP levels and outcomes. Three different experimental groups were examined:
mice with increased levels of a2AP (achieved by intravenous
supplementation), normal physiological a2AP levels (controls), or no circulating a2AP (a2AP−/− mice).14 Intravenous
supplementation increased blood a2AP levels by a median of
87.1 μg/mL (mean 79.3±14.3 μg/mL) in mice measured at
the end of the experiment, which approximately doubled the
a2AP levels found in normal mice.21 Laser Doppler monitoring showed that middle cerebral artery (MCA) thromboembolism was associated with a marked drop in hemispheric blood
flow to ≤20% of the initial baseline in all 3 groups as expected
(Figure 1A). During the period of observation, there was a
partial restoration of blood flow in a2AP−/− mice without circulating a2AP (Figure 1A), whereas hemispheric blood flow
remained suppressed in mice with normal or increased levels
of a2AP. Pathologically, there was evidence of proximal MCA
occlusion (Figure 1B) after thromboembolism, and the extent
of brain infarction differed among the experimental groups as
shown in TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride)-stained
representative images of brain slices (Figure 1B).
When compared with mice with normal a2AP levels, mice
with increased circulating levels of a2AP had larger areas
of brain infarction (Figure 1B and 1C; P<0.001). In contrast, mice without circulating a2AP had significant reductions in brain infarction by comparison to mice with normal
(Figure 1B and 1C; P<0.01) or increased levels of a2AP

The previous experiments had examined the effect of different levels of circulating a2AP on outcomes in mice with MCA
thromboemboli made from plasma containing physiological
levels of a2AP. To examine the potential additional contribution
of thrombus-bound a2AP, we compared outcomes in a2AP-deficient mice with MCA thromboemboli made from plasma containing normal a2AP levels versus a2AP-deficient plasma. As
expected, thromboemboli made from normal (a2AP+/+) plasma
showed evidence of fibrin-crosslinked a2AP by immunoblotting
using specific antipeptide or monoclonal antibodies (Figure 1G),
whereas no crosslinked a2AP was seen in thromboemboli made
from a2AP-deficient (a2AP−/−) plasma (Figure 1G). In a2APdeficient mice, MCA thromboemboli containing normal levels
of a2AP were more resistant to dissolution than a2AP-deficient
thromboemboli, indicating that thrombus-bound a2AP affects
endogenous fibrinolysis (Figure 1H; P<0.001). However,
despite the differences in the extent of thrombus dissolution,
there was no difference in brain infarction in mice with normal
or a2AP-deficient thrombi (Figure 1I). In addition, the presence
or absence of a2AP in the thromboembolus did not affect hemorrhage or brain swelling (Figures 1J and 1K).

Effects of a2AP During Prolonged Ischemia
After Cerebral Thromboembolism
Taken together, these studies indicate that at the time of
thromboembolism, levels of circulating a2AP have profound
effects on stroke outcome. To examine whether a2AP continues to exert dynamic effects on the brain for hours after cerebral thromboembolism, mice were treated with a monoclonal

antibody that inhibits a2AP (a2AP-I) and prevents the neutralization of plasmin. This a2AP-I bound specifically to mouse
a2AP (Figure 2A) and accelerated the dissolution of mouse
plasma clots in vitro (Figure 2B).22 After MCA thromboembolism, laser Doppler monitoring showed a marked drop in
hemispheric blood flow to ≤20% of the initial baseline in
all 3 groups as expected (Figure I in the online-only Data
Supplement). Two and one half hours after cerebral thromboembolism, mice were treated with a standard dose of TPA23

a2AP-I confirmed that it significantly accelerated the dissolution of ex vivo clots (Figure II in the online-only Data

Bederson neurological scores were better (ie, lower) in mice
treated with a2AP-I versus TPA (median, 1 versus 3; P<0.02),
indicating that a2AP-I treatment was associated with less neurological impairment. However, thrombus dissolution was significantly greater in TPA-treated mice than in those receiving

Previous studies have shown that brain ischemia triggers the
development of downstream microvascular thrombosis that
enhances vascular obstruction, aggravates tissue ischemia, and
contributes to breakdown of the blood brain barrier.24 Therefore,
we examined how circulating a2AP and TPA affected microvascular thrombosis. By comparison to control mice with normal
levels of a2AP, microvascular thrombosis was more extensive in
mice with high levels of circulating a2AP (Figure 3, bar graph;
P<0.001) or in mice treated with TPA (Figure 3, bar graph;
P<0.001). The extent of microvascular thrombosis was comparable in mice with high circulating levels of a2AP and in TPAtreated mice (Figure 3, bar graph; P=NS). In contrast, a2AP
deficiency or a2AP-I markedly reduced microvascular thrombosis by comparison to mice with increased levels of circulating
a2AP (Figure 3, bar graph; P<0.001) and mice with treated with
TPA (Figure 3, graph; P<0.001). Similarly, a2AP deficiency
or a2AP-I reduced microvascular thrombosis by comparison
to control mice with normal a2AP levels (Figure 3, bar graph;
P<0.05). Overall, there was a positive correlation between the
levels of active a2AP and the amount of microvascular thrombosis (Figure 3, line graph; Spearman’s r=0.94; P<0.001).

increased after cerebral thromboembolism.26 MMP-9 has
been identified as a key acute mediator of breakdown of the
blood brain barrier, hemorrhage, and brain edema in ischemic
stroke.27–29 In control mice with normal a2AP levels, cerebral
thromboembolism was associated with higher levels of expression of MMP-9 versus shams (P<0.001, not shown). When
compared with control mice with normal circulating levels of
a2AP, mice with high levels of a2AP showed increased MMP-9
expression as assessed by quantitative immunofluorescence
(Figure 4, bar graph; P<0.05). MMP-9 expression was significantly lower in a2AP-deficient mice (P<0.001) or a2AP-I
treated mice (P<0.01) by comparison to mice with elevated
a2AP levels. Consistent with MMP-9 immunofluorescence
and previous reports, in situ zymography activity seemed highest in the ischemic cortex of mice with increased a2AP levels,
intermediate in mice with normal a2AP levels, and lowest in
mice with a2AP-deficiency. (Figure III in the online-only Data
Supplement). TPA treatment significantly increased MMP-9
expression by comparison to elevated levels of a2AP (Figure 4,
bar graph; P<0.05) or by comparison to control mice with normal levels of a2AP (Figure 4, bar graph; P<0.001). By comparison, a2AP-I (Figure 4, bar graph; P<0.001) or a2AP deficiency
(P<0.001) significantly reduced MMP-9 expression by comparison to TPA-treated mice. Overall, there was a positive correlation between levels of active a2AP and MMP-9 expression
(Figure 4, line graph; Spearman’s r=0.94, P<0.0001).

These data suggest that circulating a2AP has important effects
on the dissolution of the culprit MCA thrombus and the development of brain microvascular thrombosis, infarction, blood
brain barrier breakdown, hemorrhage, swelling, mortality, and
disability after cerebral thromboembolism. Several effects
were dose-related because there were significant positive
correlations between circulating a2AP levels or activity and
the extent of brain infarction, brain swelling, microvascular
thrombosis, and MMP-9 expression. Conversely, there was a
significant negative correlation between a2AP levels and dissolution of the culprit MCA thrombus. When compared with
TPA-treated mice, a2AP-I given late after cerebral thromboembolism had a longer therapeutic window than TPA for protecting against brain injury and hemorrhage.
The finding that increased a2AP levels enhance brain
infarction and the resistance of MCA thrombus to dissolution is consistent with clinical observations that a2AP may
contribute to stroke in humans. In a case–cohort design, the
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study found that elevated a2AP levels were associated with an increased univariate risk of subsequent stroke.9 Recent studies have noted that
genetic deficiency or plasmin-induced deficiency of a2AP
reduce brain infarction in nonthrombotic models of focal ischemia induced by temporary or permanent surgical ligation of
the MCA.15,16,30 The present findings are also consistent with

Discussion

by comparison to control, untreated, and TPA-treated mice.
Control and untreated mice had a shortened survival after
proximal MCA thromboembolism (Figure 5A). Mice treated
with TPA also had significant mortality after thromboembolism (Figure 5A). Mice treated with a2AP-I, in the doses used
in previous studies above, had significantly greater survival
than control mice (P<0.05) or TPA-treated mice (P<0.001).
To determine whether the dose or the molecular form of the
a2AP-I affected outcomes, we tested high dose a2AP in the
form of an immunoglobulin (21.3 mg/kg) and as a Fab (9.5
mg/kg). All mice treated with high-dose a2AP-I in immunoglobulin or Fab form survived (Figure 5A). The survival of
mice treated with high-dose a2AP-I was significantly greater
than mice treated with low-dose a2AP-I (9.3 mg/kg; P<0.01),
TPA treatment (P<0.0001), or control mice (P<0.0001).
Surviving mice were examined to determine how these
treatments affected ischemic brain injury. By comparison to
control mice, mice treated with all doses of a2AP inactivation
had significantly smaller areas of brain infarction than control,
untreated mice (Figure 5B; P<0.001), or TPA-treated mice
(Figure 5B; P<0.001). In a similar fashion, a2AP-I treated mice
had smaller brain hemorrhage than control mice (Figure 5C;
P<0.05) or TPA-treated mice (Figure 5C; P<0.001). Brain
swelling was markedly reduced in mice treated with a2API compared with control mice (Figure 5D; P<0.001) or with
mice treated with TPA (Figure 5D; P<0.001).

recent reports that increased levels of a2AP may contribute to
the failure of TPA treatment in humans and in mice.13,14
In humans and in mice, thromboembolic occlusion of the
MCA is associated with significant ischemic brain injury,
edema, hemorrhage, and reduced survival.31,32 Consistent with
these data, our study showed that proximal MCA thromboembolism had a high mortality. Treatment with an a2AP-I caused
a marked reduction in mortality by comparison to TPA and to
controls. Examination of surviving mice showed that a2AP-I
treatment was associated with reduced hemorrhage and brain
swelling, 2 key factors that contribute to mortality after MCA
stroke.
In studies designed to examine the dynamics of MCA
thrombus dissolution in relation to tissue injury, a2AP levels
were inversely proportional to thrombus dissolution measured
6 hours after thromboembolism, which is consistent with previous studies showing that circulating a2AP levels or activity
regulate the extent of fibrinolysis.22,33,34 In addition, combined
deficiency of thrombus-bound a2AP and circulating a2AP
were associated with even greater dissolution of the MCA
thromboembolus, than deficiency of circulating a2AP alone,
indicating the important role played by thrombus-associated
a2AP in this process.35,36 Because of its role in fibrinolysis
of the MCA thromboembolus, thrombus-bound a2AP may
have been expected to affect tissue ischemia, but there was no
detectable additional effect on brain infarction and swelling.
By comparison to controls or TPA-treated mice, the reduction of brain bleeding seen in mice treated with a2AP-I is unanticipated because a2AP is often considered to protect against
hemorrhage in fibrinolytic states.10 Because TPA and a2AP-I act
in the same pathway to enhance plasmin activity, they may be
expected to have similar effects on cerebral thromboembolism.
It is notable that TPA therapy caused greater dissolution of the
MCA thromboembolus than a2AP-I, but it also caused greater
ischemic brain injury, swelling, and death. The mechanisms
responsible for the different effects of TPA and a2AP-I are currently unknown, but may be attributable to singular effects of
these agents on reperfusion injury, MMP-9 expression, acute
inflammation, microvascular thrombosis, neuroprotection, and
other factors. Several previous studies suggest that during prolonged ischemia, TPA has neurotoxic effects on the ischemic
brain, which include cleavage of the NMDA (N-methyl-Daspartate) receptor, enhancement of excitotoxicity, blood brain
barrier breakdown, promotion of apoptosis, and so on.20,37
Microvascular thrombosis plays an important role in ischemic stroke because microvascular thrombosis diminishes
plasma flow, which accentuates brain injury and is associated
with breakdown of the blood brain barrier, hemorrhage, and
other complications.24,38–40 Microvascular thrombosis may
be triggered initially by exposure of tissue factor, reflecting
activation of endothelial cells, leukocytes, or blood brain barrier breakdown.40–42 Inhibition of fibrin formation reduces
ischemic injury, arguing that it plays a key pathophysiologic
role in ischemic stroke; still the role of fibrinolysis in microvascular thrombosis is poorly understood.40–43 These data
provide the first evidence that levels of a2AP are positively
correlated, in a dose-dependent fashion, with the extent of
microvascular thrombosis in the ischemic hemisphere. These

differences cannot be explained by changes in blood cell
populations as the complete blood counts of a2AP+/+ and
a2AP−/− mice were similar (Table I in the online-only Data
Supplement). Chopp and colleagues postulated that inhibition of fibrinolysis may accentuate microvascular thrombosis
in stroke, and studies have shown that microvascular thrombosis induced by endotoxemia is enhanced when fibrinolysis
is inhibited.24,44–46 Consistent with that hypothesis, our data
shows that differences in a2AP levels, which affect dissolution of the MCA thrombus, also modulate the development of
microvascular thrombosis. Still, it is important to note that,
despite their common effects on promoting thrombus dissolution through plasmin, TPA accentuated, whereas a2AP-I
diminished, microvascular thrombosis. The cause of this difference is unknown, though pharmacological TPA has been
shown to have prothrombotic or procoagulant effects after
prolonged ischemia.47
Cerebrovascular ischemia triggers the release of endogenous TPA, which generates plasmin, and plasmin increases
brain MMP-9 activity.20 MMP-9 enhances breakdown of the
blood brain barrier, edema, hemorrhage, and apoptosis.20
Viewed solely as a plasmin inhibitor, circulating a2AP may
be expected to have a protective role by reducing MMP-9
activity; conversely, inactivation or deficiency of circulating a2AP may be predicted to be harmful by increasing
MMP-9 activity. However, the data suggest the opposite:
increased levels of a2AP were associated with significant
elevations in MMP-9 expression in the brain, and inactivation of a2AP or a2AP deficiency was associated with
reduced MMP-9 expression. Although we did not specifically quantify MMP-9 activation, in situ gelatinase activity followed a similar pattern, and previous studies have
shown that MMP-9 expression and activity in ischemic
stroke are closely related.48 Although the exact mechanism
remains to be determined, a2AP may increase local MMP-9
levels through ≥3 mechanisms: (1) by enhancing microvascular thrombosis, which increases accumulation of MMP9–expressing leukocytes,26,42 (2) by concentrating MMP-9
at the site through fibrin binding,50 and (3) by augmenting
TPA secretion,51,52 which in turn stimulates secretion of
­MMP-9.53 Future studies will be necessary to determine the
extent to which the harmful effects of a2AP are mediated
through acute increases in MMP-9 activity.
In summary, these data suggest that circulating a2AP plays
a critical, deleterious role in ischemic neurodegeneration and
survival after cerebral thromboembolism by affecting microvascular thrombosis, hemorrhage, MMP-9 expression, swelling, and breakdown of the blood brain barrier. These data add
to a growing body of evidence from in vivo models, which
suggest that a2AP may have a role in modulating cellular
injury and repair beyond its role in fibrinolysis.15,21,33,54,55 In
this translational model, it is noteworthy that delayed a2AP
inactivation after stroke onset reversed the deleterious effects
of a2AP to reduce brain injury, bleeding, swelling, disability,
and death. By comparison to TPA, the protective effects of
a2AP deficiency or inactivation seem to be mediated in part
through reductions in microvascular thrombosis and MMP-9
expression. It will be important to better define the fibrinolytic

and nonfibrinolytic mechanisms responsible for a2AP’s
effects and to further assess the extent to which therapeutic
modulation of a2AP may protect ischemic tissue after thrombotic occlusion.

Significance
Clinical observations suggest that α2-antiplasmin (a2AP) may increase the risk of ischemic stroke. We found that levels of a2AP were directly
related to the severity of ischemic brain injury after cerebral thromboembolism. High levels of circulating a2AP increased brain infarction
and swelling and interfered with the dissolution of cerebral thromboemboli. Conversely, low levels of a2AP were neuroprotective. In a similar
fashion, high levels of circulating a2AP worsened microvascular thrombosis and matrix metalloproteinase expression, two factors that contribute to ischemic brain injury. When compared with tissue plasminogen activator therapy, a2AP inactivation was less potent at dissolving
thromboemboli. However, a2AP inactivation was significantly more effective than tissue plasminogen activator at reducing brain infarction,
swelling, hemorrhage, and mortality. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms through which a2AP enhances microvascular thrombosis and ischemic injury during stroke, as well as to determine the potential protective value of a2AP inactivation.

Materials and Methods
Thromboembolic stroke. Experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Adult male C57Black/6 (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME), a2AP+/+ mice or a2AP-deficient
(C57Black/6, a2AP-/-) mice (UC Davis, KOMP) weighing 29 -35 g were anesthetized with isoflurane.
Autologous thromboemboli were made with pooled fresh frozen mouse plasma from a2AP+/+ and a2AP-/mice as described.1 MCA thromboembolism was performed as described with monitoring by a laser
Doppler flow meter (see below, ML-191, ADInstruments, Oxford Optonix, UK).1, 2 Appropriate
embolization was confirmed by a decline in hemispheric blood flow by 80%. One experimental group
received purified human a2AP (4.2 mg/kg, Athens Research & Technology, Inc. Athens, GA)
intravenously via the contralateral jugular vein immediately after thromboembolism. Other
experimental groups received a purified monoclonal antibody inhibitor of a2AP (9.3 or 21.3 mg/kg, 4h9
whole IgG or 9.5 mg/kg 4h9 Fab, Innovative Research, Novi, MI) or TPA (10 mg/kg, 20% bolus, 80% as
infusion over 1 h, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) at the indicated times after onset of ischemia.
After anesthesia, mice were supported by infusions of 250 µL of saline intraperitoneally and free access
to food and water. Mice were euthanized 6 h or 7 days after thromboembolism or if there were signs of
being in extremis or moribund in compliance with IACUC rules. Bederson neurologic scores were
assessed in a2AP-I and TPA-treated mice 6 hours after thromboembolism as described.3 In six hour
studies, 1 mouse supplemented with a2AP and 1 TPA- treated mouse died; no control mice, a2AP-/- mice
with a2AP+/+ clots, a2AP-/- mice with a2AP-/- clots or a2AP-I treated mice died. After euthanasia, blood
was collected by cardiac puncture and saline tissue perfusion was performed as described.4
Cerebral Blood Flow. Cerebral blood flow in the MCA territory was monitored by a blood flow meter
(ML-191, ADInstruments, Oxford Optonix, UK) using a laser Doppler probe (MSF 100XP, ADInstruments)
through a fiberoptic filament attached by use of a tissue adhesive to the intact skull 2 mm caudal to
bregma and 6 mm lateral to midline of the affected hemisphere.2 The blood flow was recorded using a
Power Lab 2/26 data acquisition system (ADInstruments) and successful MCA occlusion was confirmed
by ~80% drop in relative blood flow. Changes in cerebral blood flow after MCA occlusion were expressed
as percentage (mean ± standard error) of the baseline value prior to thromboembolism.
Measurement of Brain Infarction, Hemorrhage and Swelling. Analyses were performed as previously
described. 1 Following euthanasia and perfusion, brains were sliced coronally into 2 mm sections in a
rostral-caudal orientation. Brain slices were rapidly digitally photographed on both sides through a
microscope. Then brain slices were immediately incubated in triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC, 2%) to
assess cellular viability followed by digital photography as above. Digital microscopic images were
analyzed by a blinded observer using Image Pro Plus 6.2 software to measure areas of brain
hemorrhage, TTC staining and hemisphere swelling. To determine the percent hemisphere infarction,
the TTC-stained areas of the ischemic and non-ischemic hemispheres were measured on both faces of
each brain slice.5 The percent infarction was calculated for each brain by the formula: infarct percentage
= 100  (VC-VL / VC), where VC = TTC-stained area in the control hemisphere  slice thickness, VL =
TTC-stained area in the infarct hemisphere x slice thickness. The percent brain hemorrhage in the infarct
hemisphere was determined by measuring the area of hemorrhage in digital microscopic images on
both sides of each brain slice for the ischemic and contralateral, unaffected control hemisphere (in
which there was no hemorrhage). The percent hemorrhage = 100  (volume of hemorrhage in the
infarcted hemisphere/ volume of the control hemisphere). The swelling in the ischemic hemisphere was
determined by comparing the volume of the ischemic hemisphere and the contralateral hemisphere for
1

both faces of each brain slice. The percent swelling was determined for each brain by the formula:
swelling percentage = 100  (volume of the infarcted hemisphere – volume of the control hemisphere)/
volume of the control hemisphere).
Thrombus formation, dissolution and immunoblotting. In vivo studies. A fibrin-rich thrombus was
formed with citrated pooled fresh frozen mouse plasma from a2AP+/+ and a2AP-/- mice using calcium and
thrombin, with and without trace amounts of 125I-fibrinogen as described.1 Pooled fresh frozen mouse
plasma (5 ul) and 125I-fibrinogen (~12,500 cpm) were mixed with 1ul of (premixed thrombin 0.25 U and
CaCl2 100 mM) on ice. Immediately 2 ul (5,000 cpm) of plasma mix was drawn into 40 cm PE-10 tubing
and clotted overnight at 4°C. The PE-10 tubing containing the clot was cut into a 40 cm length and
attached to two syringes filled with sterile PBS with 1% BSA. The clot was washed by back and forth
movement in the tubing by alternate syringe aspiration for 5 minutes. The clot was expelled and stained
in 0.5% Evans blue in PBS for 10 minutes for visualization. After washing twice with 1% BSA in PBS, the
clot was cut into 6 pieces to facilitate loading back into the tubing and then gently compressed and
washed with sterile saline. The clot was counted in gamma counter (COBRA II, Packard) and pulled into a
30cm segment of modified PE-08 tubing filled with saline for insertion to MCA. At the conclusion of the
study, the brain was gamma counted and the amount of thrombus dissolution was determined by the
formula, thrombus dissolution % = 100  (cpm of the original clot – residual brain thrombus cpm)/ cpm
of the original clot). 1
In vitro studies of clot dissolution. Clots were formed at 37 °C for 1 hour in 5 ml tubes (Sarstedt
Inc. Newton, NC.) from pooled mouse plasma or from individual mouse plasmas by mixing 30 ul mouse
plasma labeled with trace amounts of 125I-fibrinogen, a2AP-I or buffer (20 ul) and thrombin and calcium
(10 ul, 0.05 u thrombin, 8.3 uM calcium, final). Then 90 ul of Tris-buffered saline was added together
with TPA (10ul, 1 nM final). Test tubes were placed at 37 °C and 10 ul samples of the supernatant were
sampled hourly and subjected to gamma scintillation counting (COBRA II, Packard) to determine the rate
of clot dissolution according to the thrombus dissolution formula above. A standard curve was formed
that related the concentration of a2AP-I to the amount clot dissolution. Plasma clots made from mice
receiving a2AP-I were compared to a standard curve which, by linear regression, related the effect on
fibrinolysis of different concentrations of a2AP-I added to pooled mouse plasma (r2= 0.98).
Immunoblotting studies. For immunoblotting, a2AP+/+ and a2AP-/- thrombi were made as above,
washed and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. After electrophoretic transfer to
polyvinylidene fluoride membranes and blocking with 1% BSA, membranes were incubated with pooled
monoclonal antibodies specific for mouse a2AP (monoclonal antibodies 173, 766 as well as 4h9, 27c9; 5
ug/ml; Molecular Innovations, Inc. MI.) or rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:100) directed to the NH2 and Cterminal peptides of a2AP as described.6 Bound antibodies were detected with a secondary goat antimouse antibody IRDye 800CW or anti-rabbit labeled with IRDye-680 (Li-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE)
and imaged with an infrared imager (LI-COR ODYSSEY).
Measurement of a2AP levels. Levels of human a2AP were measured in the plasma of mice given
supplemental a2AP by intravenous infusion. At the conclusion of experiments, six hours after a2AP
administration, citrated blood samples were obtained anesthetized mice undergoing euthanasia. Plasma
was obtained by differential centrifugation at 4 °C (1800 rpm for 20 minutes followed by repeat plasma
centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 minutes). Wells of a microtiter plate were coated with a human
chimeric monoclonal antibody specific for human a2AP (10 ug/ml) for 1 hour at 37'C. Then wells were
washed and blocked with 1% goat serum for 1 hour. Wells were washed four times with 0.1% Tween
and three times with PBS. Then mouse plasma containing various amounts of human a2AP was diluted
1:100 in PBS containing 1% goat serum was added to wells in duplicate in seven, two-fold dilutions or
no mouse plasma, to create a standard curve. For comparison samples from mice administered a2AP
2

were added in various dilutions to mouse plasma (1:100) in PBS for 1 hour. After washing, a mouse
antibody to human a2AP was added for an hour. Then wells were washed again and goat antimousehorse radish peroxidase (1:5000 diluted in 1% BSA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) was added for
an hour. After washing four times with 0.1% Tween and three times with PBS, wells were developed
developed with 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) peroxidase substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford,
IL) and monitoring in a microtiter plate reader at A370 nm. The level of human a2AP in mice given
intravenous human a2AP was determined by an ELISA. The standard curve related human a2AP levels
spiked into mouse plasma with the ELISA signal (r2 = 0.95).
Brain tissue analyses. For immunohistochemistry and histochemical analyses, brains were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde and paraffin-embedded. Sections were deparaffinized and hydrated in serial dilutions
of ethanol and water. Antigen was retrieved with sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) using heat induction at
98°C (20 min) followed by room temperature (20 min). Sections were washed in PBS and blocked with
10% normal donkey serum in PBS at room temperature (45 min). MMP-9 expression (anti-MMP-9
antibody, AF909, R&D systems) was localized relative to blood vessels by double immunofluorescence
staining for collagen IV (rabbit anti-mouse type IV collagen, Karlan Research Products Corporation).
Sections were incubated with primary antibody diluted in 2% normal donkey serum in PBS overnight at
4°C. After washing with PBS, secondary antibodies, DyLight549–conjugated donkey anti-goat and
DyLight488-conjugated donkey anti-Rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, PA) were
applied for 45 minutes at room temperature. Total nuclei were counterstained with DAPI using
Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Slides were examined by
fluorescence, confocal or scanning microscopy (Aperio ScanScope, Vista, CA) and digital image analyses
were performed using Image-Pro Plus 6.2 software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). For quantitative
analysis of MMP-9 immunostaining, MMP-9 staining density on red channel images of ten fields (40x)
from each stroke hemisphere were analyzed. The MMP-9 staining density in each group represents the
average of individual brains and was expressed in arbitrary units by Image-Pro Plus software.
Microvascular thrombus formation was identified by the Martius-Scarlet-Blue stain (Atom Scientific) and
quantitated by measurement of fibrin positive area (fresh red area) in 12-15 random 40x fields from
each individual mice brain stroke hemisphere using Image-Pro Plus software.
In situ zymography assays were performed to evaluate MMP activity in freshly frozen brain
slices isolated 6 hours after cerebral thromboembolism. Quenched fluorescein-labeled gelatin
(Invitrogen) was used as a substrate to identify gelatinase activity by the development of fluorescence.
For in situ zymography, 6 μm brain cryosections were first incubated with reaction buffer (0.05M TrisHCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, and 0.2 mMNaN3, pH 7.6) for 10 min and then mixed with the reaction
buffer containing 40 μg/ml DQ gelatin at 37˚C in a humidified chamber for 5 hours . After incubation,
sections were rinsed 3 times for 5 min. intervals in PBS followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 10 min at room temperature. Slides were then washed twice for 5 min. intervals in PBS and mounted
with Vectashield mounting media with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Negative controls were obtained by
pre-fixation of the sections in 4 % paraformaldehyde solution. Whole brain images were obtained by
Zeiss 710 Confocal scanning at 10x magnification.
Analysis of complete blood counts. The complete blood counts of a2AP+/+ and a2AP-/- male mice, three
mice per group, were analyzed by the UT Endocrinology Clinical Laboratory (Memphis, TN) on a
Beckman-Coulter AcT diff Hematology Analyzer (Miami, FL). Blood was collected from anesthetized mice
into EDTA containing tubes during euthanasia (BD Vacutainer, K2 EDTA 7.2mg, REF 367681, LOT
6341632).

Antibody binding. The binding of the a2AP-I to mouse a2AP or BSA was compared to a control
monoclonal antibody (anti-digoxin 40-160) in an ELISA. Wells of a microtiter plate were coated with
purified recombinant mouse a2AP (25 ul, 5 ug/ml for 1 hour) or nothing.6 After washing, non-specific
binding sites were blocked with 250 ul of 1% BSA for 30 min. After rinsing, purified a2AP-I (5 ug/ml, 25
ul), control monoclonal antibody (anti-digoxin 40-160, 5 ug/ml, 25 ul) or no MAb (25 ul) were added to
the wells for 1 hour in duplicate. After washing , goat anti mouse- horse radish peroxidase (1/2000 in
1% BSA, 25 ul Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Dallas, Texas.) was added for 30 min. at RT. Wells were
washed and developed with 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) peroxidase substrate (Thermo
Scientific. Rockford, IL) with detection by a microtiter plate reader at A370 nm.
Statistics. Normally distributed data were analyzed by an unpaired Student’s t-test or a one way ANOVA
using the Neuman-Keuls correction for multiple statistical inference. Non-Gaussian data were analyzed
by a Mann-Whitney test, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rs) or a one way Kruskal Wallis analysis
using Dunn’s correction. Survival data were analyzed by the Mantel Cox log rank test. Data are
expressed as the mean ± standard error. A two-tailed p ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Materials and Methods
Thromboembolic stroke. Experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Adult male C57Black/6 (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME), a2AP+/+ mice or a2AP-deficient
(C57Black/6, a2AP-/-) mice (UC Davis, KOMP) weighing 29 -35 g were anesthetized with isoflurane.
Autologous thromboemboli were made with pooled fresh frozen mouse plasma from a2AP+/+ and a2AP-/mice as described.1 MCA thromboembolism was performed as described with monitoring by a laser
Doppler flow meter (see below, ML-191, ADInstruments, Oxford Optonix, UK).1, 2 Appropriate
embolization was confirmed by a decline in hemispheric blood flow by 80%. One experimental group
received purified human a2AP (4.2 mg/kg, Athens Research & Technology, Inc. Athens, GA)
intravenously via the contralateral jugular vein immediately after thromboembolism. Other
experimental groups received a purified monoclonal antibody inhibitor of a2AP (9.3 or 21.3 mg/kg, 4h9
whole IgG or 9.5 mg/kg 4h9 Fab, Innovative Research, Novi, MI) or TPA (10 mg/kg, 20% bolus, 80% as
infusion over 1 h, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) at the indicated times after onset of ischemia.
After anesthesia, mice were supported by infusions of 250 µL of saline intraperitoneally and free access
to food and water. Mice were euthanized 6 h or 7 days after thromboembolism or if there were signs of
being in extremis or moribund in compliance with IACUC rules. Bederson neurologic scores were
assessed in a2AP-I and TPA-treated mice 6 hours after thromboembolism as described.3 In six hour
studies, 1 mouse supplemented with a2AP and 1 TPA- treated mouse died; no control mice, a2AP-/- mice
with a2AP+/+ clots, a2AP-/- mice with a2AP-/- clots or a2AP-I treated mice died. After euthanasia, blood
was collected by cardiac puncture and saline tissue perfusion was performed as described.4
Cerebral Blood Flow. Cerebral blood flow in the MCA territory was monitored by a blood flow meter
(ML-191, ADInstruments, Oxford Optonix, UK) using a laser Doppler probe (MSF 100XP, ADInstruments)
through a fiberoptic filament attached by use of a tissue adhesive to the intact skull 2 mm caudal to
bregma and 6 mm lateral to midline of the affected hemisphere.2 The blood flow was recorded using a
Power Lab 2/26 data acquisition system (ADInstruments) and successful MCA occlusion was confirmed
by ~80% drop in relative blood flow. Changes in cerebral blood flow after MCA occlusion were expressed
as percentage (mean ± standard error) of the baseline value prior to thromboembolism.
Measurement of Brain Infarction, Hemorrhage and Swelling. Analyses were performed as previously
described. 1 Following euthanasia and perfusion, brains were sliced coronally into 2 mm sections in a
rostral-caudal orientation. Brain slices were rapidly digitally photographed on both sides through a
microscope. Then brain slices were immediately incubated in triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC, 2%) to
assess cellular viability followed by digital photography as above. Digital microscopic images were
analyzed by a blinded observer using Image Pro Plus 6.2 software to measure areas of brain
hemorrhage, TTC staining and hemisphere swelling. To determine the percent hemisphere infarction,
the TTC-stained areas of the ischemic and non-ischemic hemispheres were measured on both faces of
each brain slice.5 The percent infarction was calculated for each brain by the formula: infarct percentage
= 100  (VC-VL / VC), where VC = TTC-stained area in the control hemisphere  slice thickness, VL =
TTC-stained area in the infarct hemisphere x slice thickness. The percent brain hemorrhage in the infarct
hemisphere was determined by measuring the area of hemorrhage in digital microscopic images on
both sides of each brain slice for the ischemic and contralateral, unaffected control hemisphere (in
which there was no hemorrhage). The percent hemorrhage = 100  (volume of hemorrhage in the
infarcted hemisphere/ volume of the control hemisphere). The swelling in the ischemic hemisphere was
determined by comparing the volume of the ischemic hemisphere and the contralateral hemisphere for
1

both faces of each brain slice. The percent swelling was determined for each brain by the formula:
swelling percentage = 100  (volume of the infarcted hemisphere – volume of the control hemisphere)/
volume of the control hemisphere).
Thrombus formation, dissolution and immunoblotting. In vivo studies. A fibrin-rich thrombus was
formed with citrated pooled fresh frozen mouse plasma from a2AP+/+ and a2AP-/- mice using calcium and
thrombin, with and without trace amounts of 125I-fibrinogen as described.1 Pooled fresh frozen mouse
plasma (5 ul) and 125I-fibrinogen (~12,500 cpm) were mixed with 1ul of (premixed thrombin 0.25 U and
CaCl2 100 mM) on ice. Immediately 2 ul (5,000 cpm) of plasma mix were drawn into 40 cm PE-10 tubing
and clotted overnight at 4°C. The PE-10 tubing containing the clot was cut into a 40 cm length and
attached to two syringes filled with sterile PBS with 1% BSA. The clot was washed by back and forth
movement in the tubing by alternate syringe aspiration for 5 minutes. The clot was expelled and stained
in 0.5% Evans blue in PBS for 10 minutes for visualization. After washing twice with 1% BSA in PBS, the
clot was cut into 6 pieces to facilitate loading back into the tubing and then gently compressed and
washed with sterile saline. The clot was counted in gamma counter (COBRA II, Packard) and pulled into a
30 cm segment of modified PE-08 tubing filled with saline for insertion to MCA. At the conclusion of the
study, the brain was gamma counted and the amount of thrombus dissolution was determined by the
formula, thrombus dissolution % = 100  (cpm of the original clot – residual brain thrombus cpm)/ cpm
of the original clot). 1
In vitro studies of clot dissolution. Clots were formed at 37 °C for 1 hour in 5 ml tubes (Sarstedt
Inc. Newton, NC.) from pooled mouse plasma or from individual mouse plasmas by mixing 30 ul mouse
plasma labeled with trace amounts of 125I-fibrinogen, a2AP-I or buffer (20 ul) and thrombin and calcium
(10 ul, 0.05 u thrombin, 8.3 uM calcium, final). Then 90 ul of Tris-buffered saline was added together
with TPA (10ul, 1 nM final). Test tubes were placed at 37 °C and 10 ul samples of the supernatant were
sampled hourly and subjected to gamma scintillation counting (COBRA II, Packard) to determine the rate
of clot dissolution according to the thrombus dissolution formula above. A standard curve was formed
that related the concentration of a2AP-I to the amount clot dissolution. Plasma clots made from mice
receiving a2AP-I were compared to a standard curve which, by linear regression, related the effect on
fibrinolysis of different concentrations of a2AP-I added to pooled mouse plasma (r2= 0.98).
Immunoblotting studies. For immunoblotting, a2AP+/+ and a2AP-/- thrombi were made as above,
washed and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. After electrophoretic transfer to
polyvinylidene fluoride membranes and blocking with 1% BSA, membranes were incubated with pooled
monoclonal antibodies specific for mouse a2AP (monoclonal antibodies 173, 766 as well as 4h9, 27c9; 5
ug/ml; Molecular Innovations, Inc. MI.) or rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:100) directed to the NH2 and Cterminal peptides of a2AP as described.6 Bound antibodies were detected with a secondary goat antimouse antibody IRDye 800CW or anti-rabbit labeled with IRDye-680 (Li-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE)
and imaged with an infrared imager (LI-COR ODYSSEY).
Measurement of a2AP levels. Levels of human a2AP were measured in the plasma of mice given
supplemental a2AP by intravenous infusion. At the conclusion of experiments, six hours after a2AP
administration, citrated blood samples were obtained anesthetized mice undergoing euthanasia. Plasma
was obtained by differential centrifugation at 4 °C (1800 rpm for 20 minutes followed by repeat plasma
centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 5 minutes). Wells of a microtiter plate were coated with a human
chimeric monoclonal antibody specific for human a2AP (10 ug/ml) for 1 hour at 37'C. Then wells were
washed and blocked with 1% goat serum for 1 hour. Wells were washed four times with 0.1% Tween
and three times with PBS. Then mouse plasma containing various amounts of human a2AP was diluted
1:100 in PBS containing 1% goat serum was added to wells in duplicate in seven, two-fold dilutions or
no mouse plasma, to create a standard curve. For comparison samples from mice administered a2AP

were added in various dilutions to mouse plasma (1:100) in PBS for 1 hour. After washing, a mouse
antibody to human a2AP was added for an hour. Then wells were washed again and goat antimousehorse radish peroxidase (1:5000 diluted in 1% BSA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) was added for
an hour. After washing four times with 0.1% Tween and three times with PBS, wells were developed
developed with 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) peroxidase substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford,
IL) and monitoring in a microtiter plate reader at A370 nm. The level of human a2AP in mice given
intravenous human a2AP was determined by an ELISA. The standard curve related human a2AP levels
spiked into mouse plasma with the ELISA signal (r2 = 0.95).
Brain tissue analyses. For immunohistochemistry and histochemical analyses, brains were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde and paraffin-embedded. Sections were deparaffinized and hydrated in serial dilutions
of ethanol and water. Antigen was retrieved with sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) using heat induction at
98°C (20 min) followed by room temperature (20 min). Sections were washed in PBS and blocked with
10% normal donkey serum in PBS at room temperature (45 min). MMP-9 expression (anti-MMP-9

Microvascular thrombus formation was identified by the Martius-Scarlet-Blue stain (Atom Scientific) and
quantitated by measurement of fibrin positive area (fresh red area) in 12-15 random 40x fields from
each individual mice brain stroke hemisphere using Image-Pro Plus software.
In situ zymography assays were performed to evaluate MMP activity in freshly frozen brain
slices isolated 6 hours after cerebral thromboembolism. Quenched fluorescein-labeled gelatin
(Invitrogen) was used as a substrate to identify gelatinase activity by the development of fluorescence.
For in situ zymography, 6 μm brain cryosections were first incubated with reaction buffer (0.05M TrisHCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, and 0.2 mMNaN3, pH 7.6) for 10 min and then mixed with the reaction

Zeiss 710 Confocal scanning at 10x magnification.
Analysis of complete blood counts. The complete blood counts of a2AP+/+ and a2AP-/- male mice, three
mice per group, were analyzed by the UT Endocrinology Clinical Laboratory (Memphis, TN) on a
Beckman-Coulter AcT diff Hematology Analyzer (Miami, FL). Blood was collected from anesthetized mice
into EDTA containing tubes during euthanasia (BD Vacutainer, K2 EDTA 7.2mg, REF 367681, LOT
6341632).
