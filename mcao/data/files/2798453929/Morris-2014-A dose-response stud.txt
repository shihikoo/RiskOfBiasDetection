Background: Thymosin β4 (Tβ4) is a 5 K actin binding peptide. Tβ4 improves neurological outcome in a rat model
of embolic stroke and research is now focused on optimizing its dose for clinical trials. The purpose of this study
was to perform a dose–response study of Tβ4 to determine the optimal dose of neurological improvement in a rat
model of embolic stroke.
Methods: Male Wistar rats were subjected to embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Rats were divided
into 4 groups of 10 animals/group: control, 2, 12 and 18 mg/kg. Tβ4 was administered intraperitoneally 24 h after
MCAo and then every 3 days for 4 additional doses in a randomized controlled fashion. Neurological tests were
performed after MCAo and before treatment and up to 8 weeks after treatment. The rats were sacriﬁced 56 days
after MCAo and lesion volumes measured. Generalized estimating equation was used to compare the treatment
effect on long term functional recovery at day 56. A quartic regression model was used for an optimal dose determination.
Results: Tβ4 signiﬁcantly improved neurological outcome at dose of 2 and 12 mg/kg at day 14 and extended to
day 56 (p-values b 0.05). The higher dose of 18 mg/kg did not show signiﬁcant improvement. The estimated
optimal dose of 3.75 mg/kg would provide optimal neurological improvement.
Conclusions: This study shown that Tβ4 signiﬁcantly improved the long term neurological functional recovery at
day 56 after MCAo with an optimal dose of 3.75 mg/kg. These results provide preclinical data for human clinical
trials.

angiogenesis as demonstrated in both dermal and cardiac injury models
[1,13,20]. Administration of Tβ4 improves functional neurological
outcome in a rat model of embolic stroke, a mouse model of multiple
sclerosis (EAE, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) and a
rat model of traumatic brain injury [15,22,23]. A common observation
in these neurological disease models is that Tβ4 promotes axonal repair
and myelination by promoting differentiation of oligodendrocyte
progenitor cells (OPCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and in the
intact white matter providing evidence to support the hypothesis that
Tβ4 is a neurorestorative agent. Neurorestorative agents act on existing
intact parenchymal cells to promote axonal remodeling and neurite
outgrowth in the injured brain which bolsters improvement in neurological functional outcome [27]. Administration of neurorestorative
agents involves treatment at subacute (N 24 h) time points resulting in
greater availability for clinical treatment.
Tβ4 improves neurological outcome in a rat model of embolic
stroke when administered 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAo) at a dose of 6 mg/kg [15]. Improvement in functional outcome
was observed as early as 14 days after stroke and extended to the
completion of the study period of 56 days. In this study, a signiﬁcant
increase of mature oligodendrocytes (OL) at the ischemic boundary as

62

well as an observed increase of OPCs in the SVZ, striatum and corpus
callosum was detected suggesting that an underlying mechanism of
axonal remodeling and oligodendrogenesis contributes to neurological
improvement. OLs are highly vulnerable to focal cerebral ischemia and
mature OLs are unable to migrate or divide [8,17]. New OLs, however,
can be generated by OPCs that are present in the SVZ and white matter
of adult rodent brain [9,16,24]. Therefore, these observations support
the hypothesis that Tβ4 acts as a neurorestorative agent.
Further testing and exploration of Tβ4 after stroke are warranted.
Toxicology studies in animal and human models demonstrate that Tβ4
is a safe drug. Since Tβ4 showed neurological improvement after stroke
at a dose of 6 mg/kg, testing of the drug at different doses needs to be
performed to determine the optimal dose of Tβ4, as well as the ceiling
effect of the drug. Determining these important parameters is vital for
translation to human clinical trials. In this study, we hypothesized that
Tβ4 would dose dependently improve neurological outcome in a rat
model of embolic stroke and that an optimal dose of Tβ4 could be derived
for use in clinical trials.
2. Material and methods
All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional
Animals Care and Use Committee of Henry Ford Hospital.
2.1. Embolic stroke rat model
The middle cerebral artery (MCA) of male Wistar rats (320 to 380 g,
n = 50) was occluded by placement of an embolus at the origin of the
MCA, as previously described [26]. Brieﬂy, under an operating microscope
(Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY, USA), the right common carotid artery
(CCA), the right external carotid artery (ECA) and the internal carotid
artery (ICA) were isolated via a 3 cm ventral neck midline incision. A
6-0 silk suture was loosely tied at the origin of the ECA and ligated at
the distal end of the ECA. The right CCA and ICA were temporarily
clamped using a curved microvascular clip (Codman & Shurtleff, Inc.,
Randolph, MA, USA). A modiﬁed PE-50 catheter ﬁlled with a ﬁbrin rich
clot from a donor rat, was attached to a 100-μl Hamilton syringe, and
introduced into the ECA lumen through a small puncture. The suture
around the origin of the ECA was tightened around the intraluminal
catheter to prevent bleeding, and the microvascular clip was removed.
The catheter was then gently advanced from the ECA into the lumen of
the ICA to reach the origin of the MCA. The clot along with 5 μl of saline
in the catheter is injected into the ICA over 10 s. The catheter was
withdrawn from the right ECA 5 min after injection and ligated. Buprenex
was administered intraperitoneally (IP) post-surgery at a dose of
0.01 mg/kg if the rat showed signs of distress.
2.2. Experimental design
Rats subjected to MCAo were randomized into one of 4 groups
of 10 animals/group: control, 2, 12 and 18 mg/kg. Tβ4 (RegeneRx
Biopharmaceuticals Inc.) was administered IP 24 h after MCAo and then
every 3 days for 4 additional doses. Randomization was performed by
placing labeled tabs (control, 2, 12 or 18 mg/kg) in a large envelope. A
research associate then placed his/her hand in the envelope to randomly
choose a labeled tab. The selected rat was then assigned this dose. We
determined a sample size of ten rats in each group were required for
analysis. Since this study was designed to observe functional outcome,
we only included those rats which completed the functional tests until
time of sacriﬁce (56 days). These doses were based on previous toxicology studies performed in rodent, dog and human models [5]. Moreover,
these doses were chosen because it was likely that this range of dosing
will be used in human clinical studies. For labeling proliferating cells,
5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 100 mg/kg; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was
injected IP into rats 24 h after MCAo and then daily for 7 days. Rats

were sacriﬁced 56 days after MCAo to investigate the long term effect of
Tβ4 on brain remodeling and functional outcome.
2.3. Neurological functional tests
In the embolic stroke rat model, a battery of behavioral tests was
performed at 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49 and 56 days after MCAo by an
investigator who was blinded to the experimental groups. The battery
of tests consisted of the adhesive-removal test (ART), the modiﬁed
Neurological Severity Score (mNSS) and foot fault test (FFT) [3,4,25].
Brieﬂy, the ART involves placing two small pieces of adhesive-backed
paper dots on the wrist of each forelimb (of equal size, 113.1 mm2) to
act as bilateral tactile stimuli occupying the distal-radial region. The
time required for the rat to remove both stimuli from each limb was
recorded in 5 trials per day. Each animal received 5 trials on all testing
days after MCA occlusion and the mean time required to remove both
stimuli from limbs was recorded. In order to increase the sensitivity of
the test, the adhesive-backed paper dots were reduced in size by
one-half at day 35. The mNSS test is a composite score in which
motor, sensory, balance and reﬂex measures are used to calculate a
value ranging from 1 to 18, with the higher score implying greater
neurological injury. Points are awarded for the inability to perform the
tasks or for the lack of a tested reﬂex. (normal score 1, maximal deﬁcit
score 18). Rats with a mNSS less than 8 were excluded from the study.
The FFT measures the ability of the rat to walk along an elevated
hexagonal wire grid and the number of times the paw slips (foot
fault) between the wires. The total number of foot faults is divided by
the total number of steps the rat uses to cross the grid. The average
number of foot faults of a normal rat is 2–3%. As anticipated, rats died
due to MCAo procedure (at day 1 or 2 before and after randomization)
and were excluded from the analysis.
2.4. Histological and immunohistochemical assessment
Rat brains were ﬁxed by transcardial perfusion with saline, followed
by perfusion and immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde, and the brains
were embedded in parafﬁn. The cerebral tissues were cut into seven
equally spaced (2 mm) coronal blocks. A series of adjacent 6 μm-thick
sections was cut from each block in the coronal plane and was stained
with hematoxylin and eosin. Seven brain sections were traced using a
microcomputer imaging device (MCID) image analysis system (Imaging
Research, St. Catharines, Canada) by laboratory associates who were
blinded to the dose and functional testing results. The indirect lesion
area, in which the intact area of the ipsilateral hemisphere was
subtracted from the area of the contralateral hemisphere, was calculated. Lesion volume is represented as a volume percentage of the lesion
compared with the contralateral hemisphere.
Standard parafﬁn blocks were obtained from the center of the lesion,
corresponding to coronal coordinates for bregma -1-1 mm. A series of
6 μm thick sections at various levels (100 μm interval) were cut.
Immunostaining was performed on these sections. Antibodies used
for identiﬁcation of OPCs and OLs were NG-2 (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan) (1:800, polyclonal rabbit, incubated overnight at 4 °C, Chemicon,
CA) and APC (CC1) (adenomatous polyposis coli) (1:20, monoclonal
mouse, incubated 60 min at room temperature, Genway, CA), respectively. To identify proliferating OPCs and OLs, double immunostaining of
NG2/BrdU and APC/BrdU was performed, respectively. Double
immunolabeling was visualized by secondary antibodies conjugated to
FITC and Cy3 (Jackson Immuno.). Myelin basic protein (MBP) antibody
(1:1000, monoclonal mouse, incubated 60 minutes at room temperature,
Covance, CA) was used to identify myelinated axons. Following sequential
incubation with biotin-conjugated anti mouse or goat IgG (dilution 1:200,
Vector laboratories, INC), the sections were treated with an ABC kit
(Vector laboratories, INC). Diaminobenzidine was then used as a sensitive
chromogen for light microscopy. Isotype matched non-immune IgG
controls were performed for each antibody.

2.5. Image acquisition and quantiﬁcation
Coronal sections were digitized using a 40× objective using a
three-CCD color video camera (Sony DXC-970MD) interfaced with a
MCID system. Laboratory associates performing the quantitative analysis
were blinded to the dose and functional testing results. For quantitative
analysis of proliferating OPCs, the numbers of double labeled NG2 and
BrdU immunoreactive cells were counted throughout the ipsilateral SVZ
and the peri-infarct area at the corpus callosum and striatum. The number
of positive cells for three coronal sections per rat was averaged to obtain a
mean number of cells. A similar analysis of proliferating mature OL
was performed using double labeling of APC and BrdU cells in the
peri-infarct area at the corpus callosum and striatum. Data are presented
as the density of immunoreactive cells relative to the area of the
peri-infarct corpus callosum and striatum.
For quantiﬁcation of myelinated axons, MBP immunoreactive
area within the peri-infarct corpus callosum and striatum and the
contralateral homologous area were digitized. Three coronal sections
(100 μm interval) from the center of the ischemic core (bregma 0.2 mm)
per animal with eight ﬁelds of view in each hemisphere were analyzed.
Data are presented as the percentage of increase in density at the
peri-infarct corpus callosum and striatum compared with the
contralateral homologous region on the same section.
2.6. Data analysis and statistical procedures
Data transformations were considered if data were not normal. As a
result, the ranked ART and mNSS were used for the comparison because
the functional data were not normally distributed. As the data illustration,
mean ± SE was presented at each time point. To mimic analysis
employed in clinical stroke recovery studies [12], a global test using
generalized estimation equations (GEEs), PROC GENMOD in SAS [19],
was performed to evaluate the effect of Tβ4 on functional recovery
measured from three neurological behavior tests at day 56, as the
primary outcome compared to controls. The GEE approach was also
used to study the Tβ4 effect on the functional recovery at the other time
points (secondary endpoints), as well as the histological evaluation
(remyelination, the number of proliferating OPCs, and mature OLs) and
lesion volume measure at day 56, as exploratory endpoints. A quartic
regression model, PROC RSREG in SAS, was used to explore the optimal
dose of Tβ4 which optimizes functional outcome [2].
3. Theory
Our initial single dose study demonstrating that Tβ4 improved
functional outcome after stroke suggested that Tβ4 warranted further
preclinical testing. Currently, treatment of stroke is limited to a
time-constrained 4.5 hour window of administration of rt-PA from
symptom onset which severely limits the number of patients that can
be treated. It may be more efﬁcacious, however, to treat stroke patients
in the sub-acute phase (N 24 h) of stroke rather the acute phase.
Projections on the percentage of patients who present within the
treatment window of rt-PA treatment option are low even with optimal
public education [14]. As the population ages, the number of stroke
victims will increase dramatically necessitating a comprehensive
treatment strategy. Treatment in the sub-acute phase will allow more
patients to be treated as well as provide physicians time to gather
pertinent historical and physical information that is often not available
in the acute phase of stroke.

rats died in the 2 mg/kg, 1 rat died in the 12 mg/kg group, and 1 rat
died in the 18 mg/kg group. The remaining rats survived until sacriﬁce.
4.1. Neurological functional outcome
To determine if Tβ4 dose-dependently improves functional outcome
after stroke, we performed behavioral tests prior to and one day after
MCAo and then weekly for 56 days at dosages of 2, 12 and 18 mg/kg.
Figs. 1–3 demonstrate the time course of improvement on the ART,
mNSS and FFT at each speciﬁc dose and the dose effect compared to
the controls (p-value) using global test is listed in Table 1. At day 56,
compared to the control group, the 2 and 12 mg/kg groups both showed
an improvement (p b 0.05) while the higher dose, 18 mg/kg, showed
no improvement (p N 0.05). Improvement was observed at day 14
and continued until the rats were sacriﬁced. The 2 mg/kg dose demonstrated a 24.2, 32.1, and 29.6% relative global improvement in the ART,
mNSS and FFT, respectively, while the 12 mg/kg showed a similar
improvement of 33.0, 26.0, and 35.5% when compared to controls
(p b 0.05). The sample distribution of lesion volumes for the control,
2, 12 and 18 mg/kg groups was 33 ± 8.7%, 26 ± 10.1%, 24 ± 9.9% and
33% ± 12.6%, respectively. There were no signiﬁcant differences in
lesion volume between the control and each of 2, 12 and 18 mg/kg
groups (p = 0.278, 0.085, 0.957) (Fig. 4). Based on the results of the
neurological tests at each individual dose, the quartic response surface
model was used to calculate the optimal dose of Tβ4 which optimizes
functional outcome. Statistical curve ﬁtting determined that a dose of
3.75 mg/kg showed optimal neurological improvement.
4.2. Tβ4 promotes myelination after stroke
To determine if Tβ4 treatment promotes myelination after stroke,
brain sections were stained using MBP. The 12 mg/kg dose was chosen
as this dose provided the greatest signiﬁcant cumulative improvement
in the neurological tests. Fig. 5 demonstrates signiﬁcant increases in
MBP immunoreactivity in the striatal ischemic boundary in the Tβ4
treatment (12 mg/kg) group (92.95 ± 3.12%) when compared to the
control group (69.62 ± 3.75%) (p b 0.05) (mean ± S.E.). No differences
were observed in the corpus callosum.
4.3. Tβ4 increases proliferating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and
mature oligodendrocytes
To determine if Tβ4 treatment increases the number of proliferating
OPCs and OLs, NG-2, a marker of OPCs and APC, a marker of OL were

Tβ4 was administered at three doses (2, 12, 18 mg/kg) 24 h after

one to two days after MCAo. Of them, 4 died in the control group, 4

5. Discussion
This study demonstrates a dose–response relationship of Tβ4
and improvement of neurological function in a widely employed rat
model of embolic stroke. Our results show that both the 2 mg/kg and
12 mg/kg treatment groups showed improvement in neurological
functional outcome, with a calculated optimal dose of 3.75 mg/kg
using the quartic surface response model. Moreover, we demonstrate
a ceiling effect of Tβ4 as the 18 mg/kg group showed no improvement
in functional outcome. In addition, we also show that Tβ4 treatment
increased proliferating OPCs and mature OLs in agreement with

previous animal models of multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain
injury [22,23].
The results of this study are in good agreement with our previous
study demonstrating efﬁcacy at 6 mg/kg [15]; as in the present study,
we found a signiﬁcant overall improvement in the ART and the mNSS
when compared to controls. The percentages of improvement of both
the ART and mNSS at 6 mg/kg were in good agreement with the results
of this manuscript. The improvement of neurological outcome shown in
these two separately performed studies using different dosages further
supports the hypothesis that Tβ4 improves neurological recovery after
stroke. This present study provides a calculated optimal dose that may
be translated into clinical trials.
The doses chosen for this study, 2, 12 and 18 mg/kg were based on
previous toxicology studies performed in rodent, dog and human
models [5]. Sprague–Dawley rats were administered Tβ4 at doses of
0.6, 6.0 and 60 mg/kg to assess the potential toxicity associated with
the IV administration of Tβ4 once daily for 28 days as well as to
determine the reversibility of any adverse ﬁndings. These doses were
selected because it was likely that this range of dosing would be used
in human clinical studies. The no observed effect level (NOEL) of Tβ4,
based on in-life observations/data, clinical pathology, macroscopic
organ weights and microscopic ﬁndings was equal to or greater than
60 mg/kg in male and female animals. Two toxicology studies were
subsequently performed with IV administration in a nonrodent species,
beagle dogs. The dose range was 0.6, 6, 9, 12, 18, 25 and 60 mg/kg
administered daily for 28 days. Although there were no macroscopic,
microscopic, or clinical laboratory ﬁndings, the dogs in the higher dose
groups (25 and 60 mg/kg) appeared to salivate post dose for a short
period of time, whereupon the salivation ceased. Although this

humans. The lower doses of 2 and 12 mg/kg were chosen based on the
results of our previous study which showed functional improvement at
6 mg/kg IP.
Following these animal studies, Tβ4 was tested in a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose–response phase 1A and 1B
study of the safety and tolerability of the intravenous administration
of Tβ4 and its pharmacokinetics after single doses in healthy volunteers
[18]. Forty healthy volunteers were administered IV Tβ4 in single doses
of 42, 140, 420 and 1260 mg (18 mg/kg for average 70 kg adult) and in
the phase 1B trial were given the same doses but daily for 14 days. All
subjects were conﬁned in a phase 1 pharmacology unit for the entire
dosing period. There were no dose limiting or serious adverse events
through the dosing period. Multiple ascending dose safety data revealed
the most frequent adverse events to be headache and upper respiratory
infection. Based on the safety demonstrated in this phase 1 study in
healthy volunteers, our results demonstrating efﬁcacy of Tβ4 24 h
after onset of experimental embolic stroke provide preclinical data for
randomized clinical trials.
Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and disability, and functional
recovery is slow and uncertain [6]. The only FDA approved treatment
for stroke is administration of rt-PA within 4.5 h of symptom onset
[10,21]. Use of rt-PA has been limited because of its narrow timedependent treatment window as most stroke patients present to the
Emergency Department well beyond 6 h of symptom onset. The restriction on time and potential adverse effects have conﬁned the use of rt-PA
to approximately 3% of stroke patients [11]. Our results that show efﬁcacious Tβ4 treatment of stroke 24 h after symptom onset has profound
clinical implications. Rather than treating a small minority of patients
Tβ4 may be employed to treat most stroke patients.
Our histology data show that Tβ4 promotes oligodendrogenesis. The
observations that Tβ4 increases proliferating OPCs in the striatal ischemic boundary as well as the SVZ and corpus callosum support the hypothesis that Tβ4 is a neurorestorative agent which acts on intact
parenchymal cells and on progenitor cells to promote neurogenesis,
oligodendrogenesis, synaptogenesis and angiogenesis. In addition, the

observation that the increased proliferating OPCs are observed to
7 weeks after administration of the drug is suggestive of its potential
robust neurorestorative effects.
Tβ4's stimulation of OPCs in the SVZ and intact white matter may
contribute to the observed recovery. Remyelination occurs only from
OPCs and not from surviving OLs or from mature surviving OLs adjacent
to the injured axons [7–9,16]. Mature OLs are for the most part, unable
to migrate or divide and therefore, new OLs must originate from OPCs.
Mature, mitotically active OLs were observed in the corpus callosum,
suggesting that OPCs were actively differentiating to mature OL.
Moreover, signiﬁcant myelination was observed in the vulnerable
striatal ischemic boundary area. OLs are highly vulnerable to focal
cerebral ischemia and our data suggest that Tβ4 increases differentiation of OPCs to mature myelin-secreting OLs [17].
Although our results suggest that Tβ4 acts as a neurorestorative
agent, we cannot rule out other molecular mechanisms of recovery
such as, neuroprotection. The lesion volumes for the 2 and 12 mg/kg
groups showed a trend toward a reduction in lesion volume. Tβ4 has
been shown to upregulate the survival kinase Akt in postnatal
cardiomyocytes [1] and investigating this potential mechanism may
be of value; however, because Tβ4 was administered 24 h after MCAo,
a neuroprotective mechanism seems unlikely.
In summary, our data demonstrate that Tβ4 improves functional
outcome in the rat stroke embolic model when administered 24 h
after MCAo at 2 and 12 mg/kg but not at a dose of 18 mg/kg. The
optimal dose calculated was 3.75 mg/kg. Tβ4 increases proliferating
OPCs in the SVZ and in the white matter of the corpus callosum, as
well as promotes myelination in the ischemic vulnerable striatal boundary. These preclinical results provide practical and robust data for
initiation of human clinical trials testing Tβ4 in the treatment of stroke.
