The scavenger receptor CD36 is a critical factor initiating ischemic brain injury, but the cell type(s) expressing CD36 and responsible for
its harmful effects remain unknown. Using bone marrow (BM) chimeras subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, we
found that CD36 ⫺/⫺ mice transplanted with wild-type (WT) BM (WT¡CD36 ⫺/⫺) have smaller infarcts (⫺67%), comparable with those
of mice lacking CD36 both in brain and hematogenous cells (CD36 ⫺/⫺ ¡CD36 ⫺/⫺; ⫺ 72%). Conversely, WT mice receiving CD36 ⫺/⫺
BM (CD36 ⫺/⫺ ¡WT) have infarcts similar to WT¡WT mice, suggesting that CD36 in the host brain (i.e., in microglia and endothelial
cells), and not in hematogenous cells is involved in the damage. As anticipated, postischemic neutrophil infiltration in CD36 ⫺/⫺
¡CD36 ⫺/⫺ mice was attenuated. Surprisingly, however, in WT¡CD36 ⫺/⫺ mice, in which infarcts were small, neutrophil infiltration
was large and similar to that of CD36 ⫺/⫺ ¡WT mice, in which infarcts were not reduced. Postischemic neutrophil free radical production
was attenuated in WT¡CD36 ⫺/⫺ mice compared with CD36 ⫺/⫺ ¡WT mice, whereas expression of the neutrophil activator colonystimulating factor 3 (CSF3) was suppressed in CD36 ⫺/⫺ cerebral endothelial cells, but not microglia. In CD36 ⫺/⫺ cerebral endothelial
cultures exposed to extracts from stroke brains, the upregulation of CSF3, but not neutrophil attractant chemokines, was suppressed.
Intracerebroventricular administration of CSF3, 24 h after stroke, reconstituted neutrophil radical production and increased infarct
volume in WT¡CD36 ⫺/⫺ mice. The findings identify endothelial cells as a key player in the deleterious effects of CD36 in stroke, and
unveil a novel role of endothelial CD36 in enabling neutrophil neurotoxicity through CSF3.

Significance Statement
Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide with limited therapeutic options. The inflammatory response
initiated by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion contributes to ischemic brain injury and is a potential therapeutic target. Here we
report that CD36, an innate immunity receptor involved in the initiation of postischemic inflammation, is a previously unrecognized regulator of neutrophil cytotoxicity. The effect is mediated by endothelial CD36 via upregulation of the neutrophil activator
CSF3 in cerebral endothelial cells. Therefore, approaches to modulate cerebral endothelial CD36 signaling or to neutralize CSF3
may provide novel therapeutic opportunities to ameliorate postischemic inflammatory injury.

Introduction
Stroke remains the leading cause of disability worldwide with
limited treatment options (Moskowitz et al., 2010). Whereas reestablishing cerebral perfusion with tissue plasminogen activator
and/or clot-retrieval devices may improve the outcome of some
patients (Campbell et al., 2015a), these interventions have a short
therapeutic window or are not widely available, and, as such, can
be used only in a minority of stroke patients. Consequently, the

majority of stroke victims receive only supportive care, highlighting the need for more specific treatments targeting the ischemic
cascade (Henninger et al., 2010; Campbell et al., 2015b).
There is increasing evidence that inflammation and immunity
play a critical role in the acute phase of ischemic brain injury
(Iadecola and Anrather, 2011). Ischemia and reperfusion lead to
intravascular molecular events that promote leukocyte adhesion
to the cerebral endothelium and their transmigration into the
brain and its coverings (Iadecola and Anrather, 2011). At the
same time, early brain injury caused by hypoxia generates danger
signals or alarmins that activate innate immunity receptors (pattern recognition receptors) in brain and its vasculature, triggering a powerful immune response within the brain (Shichita et al.,
2014). These inflammatory responses initiated by hematogenous
and brain cells reinforce each other and contribute to the full
expression of the tissue damage (An et al., 2014).

Because of their multiplicity, diverse sources, and redundant
mechanisms of action, counteracting individual inflammatory
mediators is not a feasible therapeutic strategy, and approaches
targeting upstream pathways triggering the inflammatory response are likely to be more fruitful (Iadecola and Anrather,
2011). CD36, a multifunctional Class B scavenger receptor expressed mainly in monocytes/macrophages, microglia, and endothelial cells, has emerged as a critical factor in lipid transport,
angiogenesis, as well as sterile inflammation (Silverstein, 2009).
In addition to the diverse ligands binding CD36 (e.g., oxidized
low-density lipoprotein, amyloid-␤, thrombospondin), the signaling potential of CD36 is expanded by forming macromolecular complexes with other pattern recognition receptors, such as
toll-like receptors (TLR), broadening further its biological impact (Hoebe et al., 2005; Abe et al., 2010; Stewart et al., 2010).
Recent data implicate CD36 in the mechanism of ischemiareperfusion. CD36 deletion ameliorates brain damage in models
of transient focal cerebral ischemia, an effect linked to suppression of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB, resulting
in reduced postischemic inflammation, microglial activation,
and free radical production (Cho et al., 2005; Kunz et al., 2008).
Therefore, CD36 has emerged as an upstream “damage sensor”
initiating and coordinating the expression of multiple inflammatory pathways mediating tissue damage. The cellular mechanisms
by which CD36 regulates postischemic inflammation remain to
be established. In particular, it remains unclear whether the expression of CD36 in infiltrating hematogenous cells or in resident
brain cells is critical for the effects of this receptor in ischemic
injury. Furthermore, the factors through which CD36-expressing
cells contribute to postischemic inflammation have not been
established.
In this study, we used CD36 bone marrow chimeras to provide
insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which this
scavenger receptor participates in ischemic injury. We found that
CD36 in brain cells is responsible for its deleterious effects in
ischemic brain injury. Furthermore, using in vivo and in vitro
approaches, we found that CD36 is required for the endothelial
expression of CSF3 or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor
(G-CSF), and that this cytokine is needed for postischemic neutrophil reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and toxicity.
The findings establish endothelial CD36 as a critical link between
parenchymal and blood-borne inflammatory responses and
highlight a previously unrecognized contribution of endothelial
CSF3 to the noxious effects of neutrophils in ischemic brain
injury.

Materials and Methods
Mice. All procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and
use committee of Weill Cornell Medical College. Experiments were performed in 8- to 12-week-old male CD36 ⫺/⫺ mice on a C57BL/6J genetic
background obtained from in-house colonies (Abe et al., 2010). Agematched wild-type (WT) mice (C57BL/6J, The Jackson Laboratory)
served as controls. Five-week-old CD36 ⫺/⫺ or WT mice were used for
cerebral endothelial cell culture. All animal experiments were performed
in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines (Kilkenny et al., 2010).
Middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (MCAo). Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced using the intraluminal filament model of
MCAo, as described previously (Jackman et al., 2011). Under isoflurane
anesthesia (maintenance 1.5%–2%), a heat-blunted nylon suture (6/0)
was inserted into the right external carotid artery of anesthetized mice
and advanced until it obstructed the MCA. This was confirmed by cerebral blood flow measured using transcranial laser Doppler flowmetry
(Periflux System 5010, Perimed) in the territory of the right MCA (2 mm
posterior, 5 mm lateral to bregma). The filament was left in place for 35

Garcia-Bonilla et al. • CD36 Induces Neutrophil Toxicity after Stroke

min and then withdrawn. Only animals that exhibited a reduction in
cerebral blood flow of ⬎85% during MCAo and in which CBF recovered
by ⬎80% after 10 min of reperfusion were included in the study (Jackman et al., 2011). Inadequate ischemia-reperfusion was found to be ⬍4%
in the study and not different among groups. Rectal temperature was
monitored and kept constant (37.0 ⫾ 0.5°C) during the surgical procedure and in the recovery period until the animals regained full consciousness. No differences were found in mortality rate (⬍1%) among groups.
Intracerebroventricular injection of CSF3. Mice were anesthetized with
isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus 24 h after MCAo. After a
small hole was drilled in the left parietal bone (coordinates: 0.5 mm
posterior to bregma and 1.0 mm lateral from the midline), a glass micropipette was lowered 2.3 mm below the dural surface and 1 ␮g of CSF3
(0.1 ␮g/␮l; Peprotech) or vehicle (0.1% BSA in saline) was injected. Mice
were allowed to recover and returned to their cages.
Measurement of infarct volume. As described in detail previously (Jackman et al., 2011), infarct volume, corrected for swelling, was quantified
by image analysis (MCID, Imaging Research) 72 h after ischemia in
30-␮m-thick coronal brain sections stained with cresyl violet.
Bone marrow transplantation and chimerism. Whole-body irradiation
was performed in 7-week-old male mice (CD36 ⫹/⫹ and CD36 ⫺/⫺) with
a lethal dose of 9.5 Gy of ␥ radiation using a 137Cs source (Nordion
Gammacell 40 Exactor, Theratronics). Eighteen hours later, irradiated
mice were transplanted with BM cells (2 ⫻ 10 6, i.v.) isolated from donor
CD36 ⫹/⫹ (WT) or CD36 ⫺/⫺ (knock-out [KO]) mice. Therefore, four
groups of chimeric mice were obtained: irradiated WT with WT-BM
transplant or irradiated KO with KO-BM transplant, and irradiated chimeric mice, irradiated KO with WT-BM transplant and irradiated WT
with KO-BM. Donor BM cells were flushed out with 2–3 ml of PBS from
the femur and tibias, filtered through a 40 ␮m nylon mesh, and counted
for viability before injection. Transplanted mice were housed in cages
with sulfamethoxazole (0.12%; w/v) and trimethoprim (0.024%) antibiotic added to the drinking water for the first 2 weeks. For histological
studies, GFP-transgenic mice (#006567 The Jackson Laboratory) were
used as WT BM donor, and irradiated WT and KO mice were transplanted with GFP ⫹ (WT) BM. Reconstitution of BM cells was verified 5
weeks after irradiation by testing the percentage of positive CD36
genomic DNA in isolated blood leukocytes. To this end, 300 ␮l of blood
was withdrawn by cardiac puncture from mouse under deep anesthesia,
immediately before death. Erythrolysis was performed three times using
5 ml of erythrocyte lysis buffer (0.15 M NH4Cl, 1 mM KHCO3, 0.1 mM
Na-EDTA; 5 min, room temperature). Afterward, DNA was purified
from leukocytes using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN #69504)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reference primers sequences were as follows: m_ICAM1_prom.3, 5⬘-GGACTCACCTGCT
GGTCTCT-3⬘ and m_ICAM1_prom.4, 5⬘-GAACGAGGGCTTCGGT
ATTT-3⬘; target primers sequences were as follows: m_CD36_
gen.1, 5⬘-CAGTGCTCTCCCTTGATTCTG-3⬘ and m_CD36_gen.2, 5⬘CAATAACAGCTCCAGCAATGAG-3⬘, all purchased from Invitrogen.
qRT-PCR was conducted with 20 ng of DNA, in duplicate 15 ␮l reactions
using the Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (2⫻) (Thermo
Scientific). The reactions were incubated at 50°C for 2 min and then at
95°C for 10 min. A PCR cycling protocol consisting of 15 s at 95°C and 1
min at 60°C for 45 cycles was used for quantification. CD36 relative
expression levels were calculated by 2 (⫺⌬⌬ CT) method (Livak and
Schmittgen, 2001).
Brain cell isolation. Mice were transcardially perfused under deep anesthesia with 30 ml of heparinized saline to remove blood cells. The
ischemic hemisphere was separated from the cerebellum and olfactory
bulb and gently triturated in HEPES-Hanks buffered saline solution buffer (138 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.4 mM Na2HPO4, 0.4 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM
D-glucose, 10 mM HEPES) using Gentle MACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The suspension was digested with 62.5 ␮g/ml Liberase DH (Roche Diagnostics) and 50 U/ml
DNase I (Worthington Biochemical) at 37°C for 45 min in an orbital
shaker at 160 rpm. Cells were washed and subjected to discontinuous
70%/25% Percoll (GE Healthcare) density gradient centrifugation (25
min, 800 ⫻ g, 4°C). Enriched-mononuclear cells were collected from the
interphase, washed with HEPES-Hanks buffered saline solution buffer,

Garcia-Bonilla et al. • CD36 Induces Neutrophil Toxicity after Stroke

and resuspended in 2% FBS in PBS FACS buffer for staining and FACS
analysis.
Flow cytometry and cell sorting. Rat monoclonal antibodies used for
flow cytometry analysis include the following: CD45-APC (clone 30F11), CD11b-PE (clone M1/70), Ly6G-PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone 1A8), and
Ly6C-FITC (clone HK1.4), from BioLegend. For blood leukocyte flow
cytometry, 100 ␮l of blood was withdrawn by cardiac puncture from
mice under deep anesthesia immediately before death. Erythrolysis was
performed, as described above; and afterward, blood leukocytes were
resuspended in FACS buffer. Isolated brain cells and blood leukocytes
were stained at 4°C with predetermined optimal concentrations of antibodies for 20 min and analyzed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences). Dead cells and debris were gated out by forward scatter and
side scatter properties. Cell populations were separated based on CD45
and Ly6C expression and further sorted by CD11b and Ly6G expression.
Leukocytes were identified as CD45 hi and further gated by CD11b and
Ly6G markers. The cell markers used for cell type identification were as
follows: neutrophils, CD45 hi/CD11b hi/Ly6G hi; monocytes/macrophages, CD45 hi/CD11b hi/Ly6G lo; lymphocytes, CD45 hi/CD11b lo/
Ly6G lo; microglia, CD45 int/CD11b hi/Ly6C lo; and endothelial cells,
CD45 lo/Ly6C hi (Jutila et al., 1988). Blood leukocytes (CD45 hi) were
classified as neutrophils (CD45 hi/CD11b hi/Ly6G hi), monocytes
(CD45 hi/CD11b hi/Ly6G lo), and lymphocytes (CD45 hi/CD11b lo/
Ly6G lo). Appropriate isotype control antibodies, “fluorescence minus
one” staining, and staining of negative populations were used to establish
sorting parameters. Absolute cell numbers and frequencies were recorded. Additionally, in other experiments, the cell fractions of neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, microglia and endothelial cells,
identified using the gating strategy detailed above, were sorted on a
FACSVantage cytometer (BD Biosciences) for mRNA analysis. In our
model of 30 min transient MCAo, the accumulation of leukocytes occurs
at ⬎24 h after ischemia-reperfusion (Garcia-Bonilla et al., 2014a), as
shown by others as well (Gelderblom et al., 2009). However, accumulation at earlier times has been reported with longer ischemic periods
(Pérez-de Puig et al., 2015).
In vivo cellular ROS measurement. Intracellular ROS production was
detected with dihydroethidium (DHE; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen)
staining and flow cytometry analysis. DHE was injected (10 mg/kg, i.v.)
4 h before animals were killed. DHE is a cell-permanent dye that is
oxidized by superoxide (Robinson et al., 2006). The fluorescence signal
attributable to DHE oxidation products reflects cumulative ROS production during the period between administration of DHE and killing the
animal (Coleman et al., 2013). Isolated brain cells were further costained
with CD45-APC, CD11b-APC/Cy7, and Ly6G-PercP/Cy5.5. DHE fluorescence was detected using MACSQuant analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec) with
488 nm laser and 585/40 nm bandpass filters. DHE-positive cells were
identified in infiltrating leukocytes (CD45 hi), monocytes/macrophages
(CD45 hi/CD11b hi/Ly6G lo), and neutrophils (CD45 hi/CD11b hi/Ly6G hi)
using FlowJo software.
Histology of infiltrating GFP⫹ leukocytes. WT and CD36 mice transplanted with GFP BM were subjected to MCAo and transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS followed by 4% PFA in PBS 72 h after MCAo.
Brains were removed, stored overnight in the same fixative at 4°C, and
then submerged in 30% sucrose solution for 2 d and frozen. Then, brains
were cut into serial coronal sections (thickness: 16 ␮m), 600 ␮m apart
from each other, through the frontal cortex to the caudal hippocampus
using a cryostat. The sections were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton
X-100 (Sigma) in PBS (PBST) for 30 min at room temperature, blocked
with 5% normal donkey serum in 0.1% in PBST, and incubated with the
antibody against the blood vessel marker Collagen IV (1:500, rabbit polyclonal antibody; Abcam) in 1% normal donkey serum-0.1% PBST at 4°C
overnight. After three 10 min washes with 0.1% PBST, brain slices were
incubated with a Cy5-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200; Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Brain sections were then mounted on
slides, and immunostaining was visualized by means of a Leica confocal
microscope. The specificity of the immunofluorescence was verified in
pilot studies by omission of the primary antibody. GFP ⫹ cells associated
to vessels or parenchyma were quantified in the cortex and basal ganglia
of 4 coronal sections within the ischemic lesion (1.0, 0.4, ⫺0.2, and ⫺0.8

bregma) using ImageJ software. GFP ⫹ cells within 10 ␮m of the vascular
basement membrane (collagen IV) were considered vascular associated
and not localized to the brain parenchyma.
Isolation and culture of mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells. For
each cell culture, five mouse brains were aseptically collected, pooled and
homogenized in isolation medium: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, Medium 199
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 ␮g/ml
streptomycin (Sigma) by Dounce homogenizer (KONTES Dounce Tissue Grinders, Kimble Chase, VWR). The homogenates were suspended
in 15% dextran (average molecular weight 68,800; Fisher Scientific) and
centrifuged at 3900 ⫻ g for 15 min at 4°C twice. The pellet was washed
with isolation medium, centrifuged (1000 ⫻ g, 10 min, 4°C), and digested with 37.5 ␮g/ml Liberase DH (Roche Diagnostics) and 110 U/ml
DNaseI in PBS at 37°C for 1 h in an orbital shaker at 75 rpm. After
incubation, 1 ml of FBS was added to the sample and centrifuged (1000 ⫻
g, 10 min, 4°C). The pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of endothelial
cell culture medium (DMEM high glucose; Lonza Walkersville), supplemented with 25 ␮g/ml endothelial mitogen (Bti, Biomedical
Technologies-Alfa Aesar), 100 ␮g/ml heparin (Sigma), 20% FBS, 100
U/ml penicillin, 100 ␮g/ml streptomycin, and 4 ␮g/ml puromycin (Invitrogen). Resuspended cells were seeded on 60 mm Collagen I (Invitrogen) coated dishes and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 in air. After
overnight incubation, the medium was changed; and 2 d later, endothelial cell cultures were placed in cell culture medium without puromycin.
Endothelial cells were cultured until the cells became subconfluent and
subcultured by TrypLE (Invitrogen) at a 1:3 dilution. Cultures were fed
with fresh endothelial cell culture medium every 3 d. Confluent endothelial cells were treated with 10% brain extract in endothelial cell culture
medium (v/v) for 6 h.
Brain extract preparation. Mouse brains were aseptically collected 24 h
after MCAo or sham surgery. Ischemic and nonischemic hemispheres
were dissected and homogenized in 10% FBS-DMEM at a concentration
of 150 mg tissue/ml with a Dounce homogenizer. The suspension was
centrifuged (11,000 ⫻ g, 10 min, 4°C), and the supernatant was collected
and frozen at ⫺80°C until use.
qRT-PCR. The mRNA for chemokines, cytokines, and pro- and antiinflammatory genes was examined by qRT-PCR in sham and ischemic
brain hemisphere of chimeric mice 24 h after MCAo, as previously described (Kunz et al., 2008). The following genes were studied: interleukin
(Il)-1␤, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (Cxcl ) 1, 2, and 5, and colony
stimulating factor (Csf ) 2 and 3. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt) was used to normalize gene expression. Data were
expressed as mean fold change in the ischemic hemisphere relative to
sham brain. Primer sequences, purchased from Invitrogen, were as follows: Il-1␤, 5⬘-CTCTCCACCTCAATGGACAGA-3⬘ and 5⬘-TTTT

gene expression from sorted cell fractions was examined as described
previously (Garcia-Bonilla et al., 2014a). Briefly, sorted cells were collected in TRIzol LS (Invitrogen), and RNA was extracted as described by
Tighe and Held (2010) (and treated with Rnase free DnaseI (Roche) to
remove DNA contamination. cDNA was produced from mRNA samples
by using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). For isolation of RNA from endothelial cell cultures, RNeasy Plus
Mini Kit (QIAGEN) was used. cDNA was produced from mRNA samples
by using iScript reverse transcription supermix for RT-qPCR (Bio-Rad).
Expression for Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Csf2, and Csf3 genes was performed on a
Chromo 4 Detector (Bio-Rad) using a two-step cycling protocol. HPRT
was used to normalize gene expression. q-PCR was conducted with
cDNA in duplicate 15 ␮l reactions using the Maxima SYBR Green/ROX
qPCR Master Mix (2⫻) (Thermo Scientific). The reactions were incubated at 50°C for 2 min and then at 95°C for 10 min. A PCR cycling

Results
CD36 is required for the infiltration of BM-derived cells and
for the full expression of ischemic brain injury
CD36 deletion reduces the size of the infarct produced by MCAo
in mice and dampens postischemic inflammatory gene expression and glial activation (Cho et al., 2005; Kunz et al., 2008).

However, it remains to be established whether CD36 deletion
confers protection by preventing the infiltration of BM-derived
cells into the postischemic brain. To address this issue, we used
flow cytometry to assess the accumulation of BM-derived cells at
24 and 72 h after ischemia in WT and CD36-null mice. CD36null mice had markedly reduced infarct volumes 72 h after transient MCAo (Fig. 1A). Neutrophil infiltration was virtually
abolished in the brain of CD36-null mice (Fig. 1 B, D,E), whereas
monocytes/macrophages were reduced to a lesser extent (Fig.
1 B, D,E). Effects on lymphocytes were less pronounced, although
the number of these cells was small relative to neutrophils and
monocytes/macrophages (Fig. 1D). CD36-null mice have similar
numbers of circulating neutrophils (WT: 17 ⫾ 2 ⫻ 10 3;

in WT (neutrophils: ⫺29%; monocytes: ⫺77%; at 72 h) and
CD36 ⫺/⫺ mice (neutrophils: ⫺13%; monocytes: ⫺58%; at 72 h),
it is unlikely that the reduced postischemic infiltration in
CD36 ⫺/⫺ mice versus WT mice is due to differences in the number of these cells in the circulation. Therefore, CD36 deletion is
associated with a reduction in BM-derived cells in the ischemic
brain, neutrophils in particular.
CD36 in the host is responsible for the injury
Next, we sought to determine whether CD36 in hematogenous
cells or brain resident cells was responsible for the injury. To this
end, we performed BM chimera experiments in which CD36 KO
BM was transplanted into WT mice and vice versa. Five weeks
later, after full BM engraftment (chimerism ⬎90%; Fig. 2), mice
were subjected to transient MCAo for assessment of ischemic
injury and neurological deficit 72 h later. CD36 KO mice receiv-

ing CD36 KO BM (KO¡KO) still exhibited reduced infarcts and
improved neurological deficits compared with WT mice receiving WT marrow (WT¡WT) (Fig. 2 A, B), attesting to the fact that
BM transplant procedures did not alter the neuroprotective effect
of CD36 deletion. However, WT mice transplanted with KO BM
(KO¡WT) had large infarcts comparable with WT¡WT mice,
whereas KO mice receiving WT BM (WT¡KO) had small infarcts and improved neurological outcome like KO¡KO mice
(Fig. 2 A, B). These findings indicate that CD36 in the host brain,
and not in hematogenous cells, is critical for the outcome of
cerebral ischemia.

tributed to changes in the brain infiltration of BM-derived cells
72 h after ischemia. As observed in CD36-null mice (Fig. 2C),
leukocyte infiltration was attenuated in KO¡KO mice compared
with WT¡WT mice, corresponding to the observed reduction in
infarct volume (Fig. 2A). In WT mice receiving KO BM, there was
a reduction in monocytes/macrophages and neutrophil infiltration (Fig. 2 D, E), which, however, was not statistically significant
or sufficient to reduce injury volume (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly,
however, in KO mice receiving WT BM, in which the infarct was
markedly reduced (Fig. 2A), the neutrophil infiltration was not
different from that observed in WT mice receiving KO BM in
which the infarct was not reduced (Fig. 2D). This observation
attests to the fact that in these mice the accumulation of neutrophils in the postischemic brain is independent of the size of the
infarct. No differences in monocytes/macrophages were observed among these groups (Fig. 2E).
To rule out that the neutrophils did not induce brain injury
because they were sequestered in or around cerebral microvessels
and did not reach the parenchyma, we determined histologically
the proportion of vessel-associated and parenchymal leukocytes
in WT and KO mice transplanted with GFP ⫹ BM (WT for
CD36). We found that, although their total number was reduced
in the KO host, there were no differences in the proportion of
leukocytes associated with vessels or with the parenchyma (Fig.
2H ). Therefore, after ischemia, WT neutrophils and other white
blood cells enter a CD36-deficient host but are not associated
with increased injury.

Postischemic ROS production by WT neutrophils is
attenuated in a CD36-deficient host
In cerebral ischemia, as in other inflammatory conditions, ROS
production is a major mechanism by which neutrophils damage
the brain (Nathan, 2006; Garcia-Bonilla et al., 2014a). Therefore,
we sought to determine whether the lack of neutrophil neurotoxicity in a CD36-deficient host after stroke was related to their
reduced ability to produce ROS. To this end, we examined ROS
production in brain infiltrating leukocytes of CD36 BM chimeras
72 h after transient MCAo using the oxidative fluorescent dye
DHE. In accordance with infarct volumes (Fig. 2A), the number
of leukocyte-producing ROS was significantly reduced in
KO¡KO mice compared with WT¡WT mice (Fig. 3A). Although the number of infiltrating leukocytes was similar in
WT¡KO and KO¡WT chimeras (Fig. 2C), ROS-producing
leukocytes were reduced in WT¡KO mice to levels comparable
with those observed in KO¡KO mice (Fig. 3A). Analysis of leukocyte subpopulations revealed that neutrophils accounted for
the majority of ROS-producing cells (Fig. 3C), whereas only few
monocytes/macrophages showed ROS production (Fig. 3B).
ROS-positive neutrophils were most abundant in WT mice receiving WT or KO BM and markedly reduced in KO mice receiving KO BM, corresponding to the large and small infarct size,
respectively. However, ROS-positive neutrophils were also reduced in KO receiving WT BM, which also have small infarcts
(Fig. 3C). Figure 3D–F illustrates the amount of ROS in infiltrating cell in the postischemic brain. Within ROS-producing leuko-

cytes, the amount of cellular ROS production was also different
among groups (Fig. 3D). While cellular ROS levels in infiltrating
monocytes/macrophages were similar in the four groups (Fig.
3E), the cellular ROS production of WT and KO neutrophils
infiltrating a WT host brain was increased compared with neutrophils infiltrating a KO host brain (Fig. 3F ). These observations
indicate that postischemic ROS production in WT neutrophils is
dampened in a CD36-deficient brain.

dependent manner. Because in brain CD36 is present in endothelial cells and microglia (Cho et al., 2005; Park et al., 2011),
we determined the expression of neutrophil attracting and
activating factors in these cell types. We found that Cxcl1,
Cxcl2, and particularly Csf3 were reduced in endothelial cells
sorted from CD36-null mice 24 h after stroke (Fig. 4B). No
significant changes in these factors were observed in microglia
(Fig. 4B).

Factors involved in neutrophil activation are suppressed in
CD36-null mice after stroke
To gain insight into the molecular bases of the reduced neutrophil toxicity in CD36-null mice, we investigated the postischemic expression in brain of factors involved in neutrophil
transmigration and activation (Nathan, 2006; Nauseef and
Borregaard, 2014). We found that, although Cxcl1, Cxcl2,
Cxcl5, Il-1␤, Csf2, and Csf3 mRNA were upregulated before
neutrophil invasion (24 h after stroke), the expression of
Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl5, and Csf3 was reduced in CD36-null mice
(Fig. 4A). Next, we sought to determine the cell type(s) in
which these factors are expressed after stroke in a CD36-

CD36 is required for the full expression of endothelial CSF3
Based on these results, we sought to determine whether CD36 in
endothelial cells is needed for the expression of factors involved
in neutrophil attraction and activation after stroke. To this end,
we exposed cerebral endothelial cells in culture to a brain extract
prepared 24 h after stroke. An extract from the ischemic hemisphere, but not from the contralateral one, induced massive upregulation of Cxcl1, Cxcl2, and Csf3 (Fig. 5A). However, only the
Csf3 induction was markedly suppressed in endothelial cells deficient in CD36 (Fig. 5A) (⫺50 ⫾ 4%), attesting to the requirement of CD36 of its full expression.

Finally, we tested the effect of restoring cerebral CSF3 levels in
chimeric mice in which WT BM was transplanted into a CD36deficient host. In these mice, there was neutrophil infiltration
(Fig. 2D), but stroke volume (Fig. 2A) and postischemic ROS
production by neutrophils (Fig. 3C) were not increased. Administration of CSF3 into the cerebral ventricles did not increase
stroke volume in WT mice receiving WT BM (Fig. 5B). However,
in CD36-null mice receiving WT BM, CSF3 administration increased stroke volume and ROS-positive neutrophils (Fig. 5C).

Discussion
Major findings of the study
We investigated the cellular mechanism of the effect of CD36 in
ischemic brain injury. BM chimera experiments demonstrated
that CD36 in the host brain, not in infiltrating hematogenous
cells, is required for the full expression of the damage. Thus, the
injury was markedly reduced in CD36-null mice transplanted
with WT BM. However, the damage was reduced despite significant infiltration of neutrophils, suggesting that these cells cannot
fully exert their toxic effect in a CD36-deficient host. Accordingly, the capacity of WT neutrophils to produce postischemic
ROS, a major effector of their toxicity, was impaired in a CD36deficient host. Because CD36 in the host brain is present in cerebral endothelial cells and microglia, we examined the expression
of factors involved in neutrophil trafficking and activation in
these cells, which were sorted from WT and CD36-null brains
after stroke. We found that CSF3, a cytokine involved in BM
mobilization and neutrophil activation (McLemore et al., 2001;
Semerad et al., 2002), is substantially upregulated after stroke

(Fig. 4A), an effect suppressed in cerebral endothelial cells of
CD36-null mice. These observations indicated that CD36 is
needed for the upregulation of this cytokine, key for neutrophil
ROS production. In support of this hypothesis, brain extracts
prepared 24 h after ischemia induced a profound upregulation of
Cxcl1 (⬎90-fold), Cxcl2 (15-fold), and Csf3 (⬎90-fold) in WT
cerebral endothelial cells, but only the Csf3 upregulation was attenuated in CD36-null endothelia. Administration of CSF3 (intracerebroventricular) to CD36-null mice transplanted with WT
BM restored the ability of neutrophils to produce ROS and increased postischemic injury. These findings demonstrate a key
role of endothelial CD36 in neutrophil trafficking and activation
in the setting of cerebral ischemia, and the involvement of CD36dependent CSF3 expression in postischemic neutrophil toxicity.
CD36 expression in the host is responsible for the damage
We found that transplantation of WT BM in CD36-null mice did
not reconstitute the damage, whereas transplantation of CD36null BM did not confer protection in WT mice, indicating that
CD36 expression in the host is responsible for its deleterious
effects on the outcome of cerebral ischemia. However, quantitative assessment of the postischemic infiltration of hematogenous
cells by flow cytometry revealed that, although transplantation of
CD36-null BM reduced the infiltration in a WT host, the damage
was not reduced and was comparable with that of WT mice.
These findings suggest that lack of CD36 in hematogenous cells
reduces the ability of leukocytes to enter the postischemic brain,
but this effect is not sufficient to influence brain damage. Indeed,
lack of CD36 on infiltrating cells did not reduce the ability of
neutrophils to produce ROS. Because blood neutrophils are not
known to express CD36 (Ericson et al., 2014), their reduced

Garcia-Bonilla et al. • CD36 Induces Neutrophil Toxicity after Stroke

transmigration into the brain may involve interactions with other
hematogenous cells expressing the receptors, such as monocytes
or platelets (Ghasemzadeh and Hosseini, 2013; Schiwon et al.,
2014). Furthermore, the absence of CD36 on neutrophil also
rules out that their potential for ROS production is directly impaired by CD36 deletion. In addition, the observation that
CD36 ⫺/⫺ BM transplanted into WT hosts does not reduce damage argues against the protective effect of CD36 deletion being the
result of reduced postischemic intravascular clotting due to a
possible role of platelet CD36 (Ghosh et al., 2008).
On the other hand, in a CD36-null host receiving WT BM,
brain damage was markedly reduced and not different from that
of CD36-null mice. Such damage reduction occurred despite a
leukocyte infiltration comparable with that of WT mice receiving
CD36-null BM, in which the infarct was as large as in WT mice. In
this instance, we found that the ability of infiltrating neutrophils
to generate ROS was markedly reduced, indicating that CD36 in
the host is needed for neutrophils to produce ROS in the postischemic brain. Collectively, these finding highlight a key role of
CD36 in neutrophil infiltration and activation. However, the effect on neutrophil infiltration, which depends on the presence of
CD36 in BM-derived cells as well as the host, has no impact on
ischemic injury, whereas the effect on neutrophil toxicity, which
depends on CD36 in the host, is the major determinant of stroke
outcome.
CD36 and neutrophil ROS: role of endothelial CSF3
We found that CD36 in the host is required for the full production of ROS by neutrophils after stroke. Because ROS are produced by activated neutrophils (Nathan, 2006), we examined the
impact of CD36 on factors involved in neutrophil chemoattraction and activation (Mantovani et al., 2011; Nauseef and Borregaard, 2014). We found that, whereas the chemokines CXCL1
and 2 were reduced by 20%– 40% in CD36-null cerebral endothelial cells, CSF3, a cytokine critical for neutrophil mobilization
and ROS production (Katsura et al., 1993; Sato et al., 1997), was
suppressed by 70%. No changes in these factors were observed in
CD36-null microglia. On these bases, we hypothesized that reduction of CSF3 in cerebral endothelial cells was related to the
lack of neutrophil ROS in CD36-null mice receiving WT BM. To
provide supportive evidence for this hypothesis, we exposed primary cerebral endothelial cell cultures to an extract prepared
from brains after stroke. We found that this treatment induced
substantial upregulation of CXCL1, CXCL2, and CSF3, but only
the CSF3 upregulation was CD36-dependent. The observation
that exogenous CSF3 restored the ability of neutrophils to produce ROS and reconstituted the damage in CD36-null mice receiving WT BM supports a critical role of this cytokine in
neutrophil toxicity.
What is the cellular source of CSF3? Although in brain CD36 is
expressed in endothelial cells and microglia (Park et al., 2011;
Hickman et al., 2013), we found that the postischemic expression
of CSF3 occurs only in endothelial cells. Endothelial cells have
been reported to induce neutrophil activation and to potentiate
ROS production through hematopoietic growth factors (Takahashi et al., 2001). Furthermore, our in vitro studies indicate that
the supernatant of brains subjected to MCAo induced a massive
CSF3 response in cerebral endothelial cells. Therefore, the cellular source of CSF3 is likely to be in endothelial cells.
CSF3 and stroke
CSF3 (G-CSF), best known for its involvement in the mobilization of BM progenitors, especially neutrophil precursors and

J. Neurosci., November 4, 2015 • 35(44):14783–14793 • 14791

stem cells, is used extensively to expand BM cells in patients with
hematological malignancies and BM transplantation (Beekman
and Touw, 2010). In experimental stroke, CSF3 has been shown
to be uniformly neuroprotective in the acute and chronic setting
through multiple mechanisms, including enhancement of angiogenesis and neurogenesis, as well as suppression of inflammation
and apoptosis (England et al., 2009). However, consistent with
our results, a recent clinical trial (AXIS 2) has shown no efficacy
of acute CSF3 administration after stroke (Ringelstein et al.,
2013), highlighting an unanticipated complexity in its role in
stroke. CSF3 was previously reported to enhance neutrophil ROS
production (Katsura et al., 1993), but in the setting of stroke
CSF3 was considered to be protective. Our studies unveil a previously unrecognized “dark side” of CSF3 in ischemic brain injury by demonstrating its involvement in the postischemic ROS
production by neutrophils, a CD36-dependent effect. The mechanisms by which endothelial CD36 regulates CSF3 expression
remain to be investigated. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein, a
well-known CD36 activator, induces CSF3 expression in vascular
cells (Kiyan et al., 2014). The effect requires the interaction of
CD36 with other receptors, including TLR4 and the urokinase
receptor uPAR, which may form a macromolecular complex with
CD36 (Kiyan et al., 2014). Similarly, induction of neutrophilactivating genes, including CSF3, was found in endothelial cells
exposed to the presumed CD36 ligand serum amyloid A (Lakota
et al., 2013), which is upregulated after stroke (Rallidis et al.,
2006). It is therefore conceivable that similar mechanisms are
responsible for the CD36-mediated CSF3 expression after stroke.
However, further studies are required to provide experimental
evidence for this hypothesis.
CD36 and alarmins after stroke
Another questions concerns the ligands activating endothelial
CD36 and their source. Brain-generated “danger signals” after
stroke could reach endothelial cells either from the abluminal
side or from the luminal side after leaking into the circulation
(Liesz et al., 2015). CD36 is activated by numerous endogenous
ligands, including amyloid-␤, thrombospondin, oxidized lowdensity lipoprotein, surface fragments of apoptotic cells, advanced glycated proteins, cell derived microparticles, and others
(Silverstein et al., 2010). The ligands engaging CD36 after stroke
remain to be identified and, considering the diverse binding sites
of the receptor and its ability to form macromolecular complexes
with other pattern recognition receptors, are likely to be multiple.
Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that CD36 signaling
after stroke requires the TLR2/1 complex (Abe et al., 2010), and
requirement for complexes with TLR2/6 and TLR4 have been
described in other disease models (Hoebe et al., 2005; Kiyan et al.,
2014). Using the endothelial in vitro system exposed to brain
extracts after stroke, we are well equipped to identify potential
CD36 ligands responsible for CSF3 expression in endothelial cells
and ROS production in neutrophils. These experiments, which
are beyond the scope of the present study, are underway.
Recent data have implicated CD36 also in Alzheimer’s pathology, Parkinson disease, prion diseases, and spinal cord injury
(Garcia-Bonilla et al., 2014b), suggesting that the deleterious effects of this receptor are not confined to ischemic brain injury.
However, in models of neonatal cerebral ischemia (Woo et al.,
2012) and intraparenchymal hemorrhage (Fang et al., 2014; Zhao
et al., 2015), CD36 in activated microglia seems to be protective
by facilitating the removal of apoptotic cells and the reabsorption
of the hematoma, respectively. Therefore, the role of CD36 cannot be assumed to be uniformly beneficial or deleterious but may

14792 • J. Neurosci., November 4, 2015 • 35(44):14783–14793

depend on the nature of the injury, its state of evolution, and the
age of the host.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that CD36 has a critical
role in the acute damage produced by the inflammatory component of ischemic brain injury. The cellular bases of the tissue
damage are related to promoting the infiltration of neutrophil
and enhancing their ability to produce ROS. The effect is attributable to CD36 expressed in host cells and not in hematogenous
cells infiltrating the postischemic brain. In particular, CD36 in
cerebral endothelial cells is essential for the full expression of
CSF3, a potent activator of neutrophil ROS previously considered to be uniformly beneficial in experimental stroke. Collectively, the data identify CD36 in cerebral endothelial cells as a key
initiator of innate immune responses after stroke, and highlight a
previously unrecognized deleterious role of CSF3 in postischemic
neutrophil activation and brain injury. Targeting the endothelial
CD36-CSF3 axis may offer a potential new approach to dampen
postischemic inflammation and counteract its harmful effects on
the ischemic brain.
