Cell death is one of the pathophysiological hallmarks after stroke. Markers to image cell death pathways in vivo are highly desirable.
We previously showed that ﬂuorescently labeled Annexin A5 (AnxA5), which binds speciﬁcally to phosphatidylserine (PS) on dead/
dying cells, can be used in experimental stroke for monitoring cell death with optical imaging. Here we investigated whether
dual-labeled AnxA5 (technetium and ﬂuorescence label) can be used for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of
cell death in the same model. C57Bl6/N mice were subjected to 60-minute middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and underwent
SPECT imaging at 24, 48, and 72 hours afterwards. They were injected intravenously with either PS-binding AnxA5 or the
nonfunctional AnxA5 (negative control), labeled with 99mTc and Alexa Fluor 568, respectively. After SPECT imaging, brain sections
were cut for autoradiography and ﬂuorescence microscopy. Ethanol-induced cell death in the femur muscle was used as positive
control. We detected dual-labeled AnxA5 in the model of ethanol-induced cell death in the femur muscle, but not after MCAO at
any time point, either with SPECT or with ex vivo autoradiography or ﬂuorescence microscopy. Dual-labeled AnxA5 appears to be
unsuited for visualizing death of brain cells in this MCAO model.

INTRODUCTION
Death of brain cells is a hallmark of stroke as well as of many other
neurologic and neurodegenerative diseases.1 So far, the cellular
mechanisms underlying cell death in the brain are only partly
understood.1,2 One of the limitations of current research in models
of neurologic diseases is that most of the data for death of brain
cells are acquired at a single time point at which the experiment
must be terminated and the animals killed to allow histologic or
biochemical analysis of the specimen.3 This limits our ability to
study the time course of cell death cascades and their dynamics in
the same animal. The distribution of dead cells in different brain
areas, and cell-type identity are therefore only poorly understood.3
To date, there is no established imaging marker that enables
speciﬁc in vivo visualization of the molecular targets involved in
cell death after stroke. Such a marker would be highly desirable, as
it could serve as a noninvasive tool for diagnosis and for
monitoring therapy. Its major challenge is that it has to reach its
target cells in the brain parenchyma in sufﬁcient numbers to be
detectable.
Annexin A5 (AnxA5) is a 36 kDa protein that speciﬁcally binds to
phosphatidylserine, which is translocated to the outer leaﬂet of a
cell when cell death occurs. Annexin A5 imaging has already been
extensively studied and successfully established in cancer (for
review see Vangestel et al4 or Yang et al5), atherosclerosis (for

review see Laufer et al6), and myocardial infarction (for review see
Wolters et al7). In stroke, Blankenberg et al showed that two
patients with acute stroke had regions of 99mTc-HYNIC-AnxA5
uptake, which correlated with sites of restricted diffusion on
magnetic resonance imaging. They also used 99mTc-HYNIC-AnxA5
in the rat to visualize response to Anti-FasL antibody treatment
after 2 hours middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Tracer
uptake correlated well with infarct size and number of TUNEL
(terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end
labeling)-positive cells.8 In another study, the same group showed
that 99mTc-HYNIC-AnxA5 was used to monitor protective effects of
minocycline treatment in a permanent MCAO model in the
mouse.9 We recently reported that noninvasive imaging using
AnxA5 was indeed speciﬁc to dead/damaged cells after focal
cerebral ischemia in the mouse. To show this, we used an AnxA5
that cannot bind phosphatidylserine as a control protein and
showed that the ratio between ipsilateral and contralateral
hemisphere was only signiﬁcantly higher in animals receiving
intact AnxA5. We also compared the near-infrared signal of
intravenously injected Cy5.5-AnxA5 to intravenously injected
propidium iodide and ex vivo TUNEL staining and infarct
distribution assessed by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride. The
majority of the cells displaying AnxA5 signal was also positive
for propidium iodide and TUNEL.10

Annexin A5 SPECT imaging in cerebral ischemia
M Zille et al

e2
From these results, we inferred that AnxA5 might be a
promising marker to visualize cell death in stroke. However,
near-infrared imaging is not suited to visualize cell death in the
brain in patients. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate
whether dual-labeled AnxA5 (technetium and ﬂuorochrome) is
suitable and speciﬁc to visualize cell death after experimental
cerebral ischemia and to characterize the time course of phosphatidylserine translocation in this model. We used 99mTc(CO)3HIS-cys-AnxA5-AF568, which has six histidine residues on the
N-terminus of AnxA5 (HIS-tag) and is a ‘second generation’ AnxA5.
This ‘second generation’ AnxA5 derivative has a single cysteine
residue at its concave site which allows for site-speciﬁc conjugation of different radiometal binding ligands via sulﬁde formation
through thiol chemistry. Thereby, the radioisotope is located
outside the binding region of the protein and does not affect its
binding properties.11 We have previously shown that 99mTc(CO)3HIS-cys-AnxA5 is superior to ‘ﬁrst generation’ 99mTc-HYNIC-AnxA5
in terms of in vivo afﬁnity, distribution in the body, stability, and
radiolabeling yields.11 In addition to its radioactive label, it also has
a ﬂuorescent tag that can be visualized in ﬂuorescent microscopy.
In contrast to the previous results, we show here that
single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging
of dual-labeled AnxA5 is not suited to visualize death of brain cells
in a 60-minute mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia in vivo.
We show that 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cys-AnxA5-AF568 cannot be
detected in the brain by SPECT and autoradiography after cerebral
ischemia, while it can be visualized after ethanol-induced cell
death in the femur muscle.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and Ethical Statement
All procedures were performed in accordance with the German animal
welfare laws (Landesamt fuer Gesundheit und Soziales Berlin) and
approved under the animal research licenses G0199/11. Local guidelines
for premature euthanasia were followed when animals showed signs of
distress in our daily health check. Animals were housed under standard
conditions with free access to food and water. Animals were randomly
assigned to experimental groups and investigators were masked to the
experimental groups while analyzing the results.

Radiochemical Synthesis
HIS-cys-AnxA5-AF568 was prepared as previously described.11 The
99m
Tc(CO)3þ precursor was obtained by adding 1 mL of 99mTcpertechnetate solution (1.0 to 1.5 GBq) to an IsoLink kit (Paul Scherrer
Institute, Villigen-PSI, Switzerland), which was then heated at 901C for
20 minutes. After cooling, 99mTc(Co)3þ precursor solution was adjusted to
pH 7.5 with 0.1 mL HCl. Approximately, 400 mL of the solution was then
added to 70 mg HIS-cys-AnxA5-AF568. The solution was incubated at 371C
for 1 hour under a stream of nitrogen to reduce the total volume of the
reaction mixture to 50 to 100 mL. The solution was then puriﬁed and
buffers were changed using Amicon Ultra-0.5 centrifugal ﬁlters (10 kDa
exclusion, Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany). The solution was centrifuged
at 12,000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes; this was followed by two rinse steps with
0.2 mL of 0.9% saline for 5 minutes each, yielding 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cysAnxA5-AF568 in 0.9% saline solution. Total yield was 70.99%±8.88%.
99m
Tc(CO)3-HIS-cys-M1234-AnxA5-AF568 was prepared in the same way
using 70 mg HIS-cys-M1234-AnxA5-AF568. Total yield was 77.21%±3.03%.
Only fresh eluate was used for experiments.

High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
Purity of 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cys-AnxA5-AF568 was assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography using a solvent pump (LC-10), a UV detector
(SPD-M10A) at 254 nm and a NaI(Tl) detector (Shimadzu, Duisburg,
Germany) in series. Analysis was performed on Aeris Widepore 3.6u XBC18 column (Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany), eluted with a linear
gradient from 0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid in water (0 to 3 minutes) to 100%
acetonitrile over the course of 20 minutes at a ﬂow rate of 0.5 mL per
minute. Radiochemical purity of 97.22%±2.13% for 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cysAnxA5-AF568 and 97.98±0.68% for 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cys-M1234-AnxA5-AF568
Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2014), e1 – e7

was achieved. Both markers were chemically pure, as no other peaks were
detected using the UV detector.

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Transient MCAO was induced in twenty 10-week-old male C57BL6/N mice
(Research Institute for Experimental Medicine Charité, Berlin, Germany) by
inserting a silicone rubber-coated, 170 mm thick monoﬁlament (Doccol
Corporation, Redlands, USA) via the internal carotid artery as described by
Engel et al.12 Mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane (2% for induction and
1.5% for maintenance) under 70% N2O and 30% O2 via a face mask. After
60 minutes of ischemia, animals were re-anesthetized and the ﬁlament
removed to permit reperfusion. Mice were treated with bupivacaine as a
local anesthesia after surgery. During surgery and ischemia, body
temperature was measured and kept constant between 37.01C and
37.51C with a heating pad. After surgery, the animals were allowed to wake
up in a warming cage and kept there for B2 hours. Four animals had to be
euthanized because they lost 420% body weight after MCAO.

Ethanol-Induced Cell Death in the Femur Muscle
Ethanol-induced cell death was achieved by injecting 100 mL of 100%
ethanol into the left femur muscle of eight 10-week-old male C57BL6/N
mice (Research Institute for Experimental Medicine Charité, Berlin,
Germany) as previously described.13 Mice were anesthetized with
isoﬂurane (2% for induction and 1.5% for maintenance) under 70% N2O
and 30% O2 via a face mask. Mice were allowed to recover for 19 hours and
received subcutaneous injections of buprenorphin (0.05 mg/kg) every 8
hours for pain relief. All animals survived the procedure.

Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography/Computed
Tomography Imaging
Anesthetized mice were injected intravenously with 96.43±30.00 MBq
99m
Tc(CO)3-HIS-cys-AnxA5-AF568 or 142.45±23.09 MBq 99mTc(CO)3-HIScys-M1234-AnxA5-AF568 at 24 (n ¼ 5), 48 (n ¼ 3), or 72 (n ¼ 5 for
99m
Tc(CO)3-HIS-cys-AnxA5-AF568 and n ¼ 3 for 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cys-M1234AnxA5-AF568) (±2.0) hours after reperfusion after MCAO. For ethanolinduced cell death in the left femur muscle, intravenous injections were
performed at 19 (±0.5) hours after injury onset (n ¼ 5 for 99mTc(CO)3-HIScys-AnxA5-AF568 and n ¼ 3 for 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cys-M1234-AnxA5-AF568).
One mouse receiving 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cys-M1234-AnxA5-AF568 at 72 hours
after MCAO did not survive the injection. Imaging was performed using a
four-head nanoSPECT/CTplus system (Bioscan Europe, Paris, France). The
anesthetized mice were positioned on a Minerve Small-Animal Environment System mouse bed (Bioscan Europe). Minerve’s heating was used to
keep the mice at normal physiologic temperature during the scan. Mice
were anesthetized with isoﬂurane (2% for induction and 0.8% to 1.5% for
maintenance) under 70% N2O and 30% O2. Breathing was controlled using
a respiration pad and adjustment of isoﬂurane anesthesia. Sequences were
as follows: for MCAO animals, head CT (projections: 240, pitch: 0.5, tube
voltage: 45 kV, exposure time: 1,000 millisecond, and scan time: 2 minutes)
was performed, followed by head SPECT (standard sampling quality,
256  256 matrix, 120 frames, and scan time: 20 minutes) for 3.5 hours.
Whole-body SPECT (standard sampling quality, 256  256 matrix, 45
frames, and scan time: 30 minutes) was then performed, followed by
whole-body CT (projections: 180 to 240, pitch: 0.5, tube voltage: 45 kV,
exposure time: 1,000 millisecond, and scan time: 10.5 to 12 minutes). For
animals undergoing ethanol-induced cell death in the left femur muscle,
whole-body CT (projections: 180, pitch: 0.5 to 1, tube voltage: 55 kV,
exposure time: 500 millisecond, and scan time: 4.5 to 6.75 minutes) was
performed, followed by whole-body SPECT (standard sampling quality,
256  256 matrix, 30 frames, scan time: 22.5 to 25 minutes).
Image analysis was performed with VivoQuant v.1.23b6 (inviCRO, LLC,
Boston, MA, USA). Three-dimensional regions of interest were outlined on
each image sequence using ‘3D ROI Tool’ and ‘Connected Thresholding’
(VivoQuant, inviCRO, LLC, Boston, MA, USA).

Ex Vivo Biodistribution Measurements and Autoradiography
Mice were killed by decapitation after SPECT imaging. To determine the
biodistribution of 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cys-AnxA5-AF568 and 99mTc(CO)3-HIScys-M1234-AnxA5-AF568, activity of organs was measured in an activity
meter ISOMED 2010 (MED Nuklear-Medizintechnik Dresden GmbH,
Dresden, Germany). The percentage of injected dose (%ID) and %ID/organ
weight (%ID/g) in brain, muscles, kidney, liver, and lung was calculated.

Brains were immediately snap frozen in ice-cold methyl butane, and
coronal cryosections with a thickness of 20 mm were cut at interaural
positions 6.6, 5.3, 3.9, 1.9, and 0 mm (several series of each brain). One
series of slices was incubated overnight on a technetium-sensitive imaging
plate (Fuji Imaging plate; BAS-IP TR 2025, Duesseldorf, Germany) and
digitalized with Bio-Imaging Analyzer BAS 5000 (Fuji, Duesseldorf,
Germany). Target-to-background ratios were calculated by regions of
interest analysis using ImageJ v.1.45 (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html)
as follows: For MCAO animals, ratios between ipsilateral areas of the
damaged striatum and cortex and mirrored contralateral areas for MCAO
were calculated, both corrected by background subtraction. For animals
undergoing ethanol-induced cell death in the left femur muscle, ratios
between ipsilateral muscle and contralateral muscle both corrected by
background subtraction were calculated.

Infarct Volumetry and Microscopy
Infarct volumes after MCAO were determined after hemalaun staining.
After autoradiography, sections were rinsed in an alcohol series of decreasing concentrations before incubation with hemalaun (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany) for 5 minutes. The slides were then rinsed in 96% ethanol with
2% hydrochloric acid and incubated in 2% sodium bicarbonate. After
dehydration and mounting, the sections were digitized. The area of
infarction (as deﬁned by a lower overall cell density because of cell
damage) was quantiﬁed using ImageJ v.1.45 (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/
index.html). A correction for edema was applied by calculating the
‘indirect’ infarct volume as the volume of the contralateral hemisphere
minus the non-infarcted volume of the ipsilateral hemisphere.
The AF568 label attached to AnxA5 was used to investigate the slices
under ﬂuorescent microscopy using a Leica DMRE microscope (Leica
Microsystems Jena GmbH, Jena, Germany).

Statistics
Normality was tested using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and variance
homogeneity using Levené test. When data were normally distributed,
but variances were not homogenous across groups and more than two
groups were analyzed, Kruskal–Wallis test was performed followed by post
hoc Mann–Whitney U test with a-correction according to Bonferroni to
adjust for the inﬂation of type I error owing to multiple testing (familywise
error rate). For data that were distributed normally and variances that were
homogenous across groups, independent t-test was performed in case of
two groups and one-way analysis of variance in case of more than two
groups. For correlation analysis of target-to-background ratios of MCAO
animals versus infarct volumes, Spearman’s rank order correlation was
used because variances of target-to-background ratios for MCAO animals
were not homogenous across groups. Data are expressed as mean±s.d.,
except for autoradiography data after MCAO, which were expressed as
medians because variance homogeneity was not met and Kruskal–Wallis
test was performed. A value of Po0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant. When Kruskal–Wallis test was performed followed by Mann–
Whitney U test, P ¼ 0.05/k was used, with k as the number of single
hypotheses. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS v.19.0.

RESULTS
In Vivo AnxA5 SPECT Imaging and Ex Vivo AnxA5 Autoradiography
Fail to Detect Cell Death in a Mouse Model of Focal Cerebral
Ischemia
Middle cerebral artery occlusion mice received intravenous
injection of 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cys-AnxA5-AF568 (HIS-AnxA5) at 24,
48, or 72 hours or the nonfunctional 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cys-M1234AnxA5-AF568 (M1234, negative control) at 72 hours after reperfusion. SPECT imaging was performed immediately after and then
every 30 minutes until 3.5 hours after injection. We were not able
to detect an AnxA5 SPECT signal in the brain at any time point
investigated (Figure 1A). However, we noted a low signal (in the
range of 0.01 kBq or lower) below the brain.
Thereafter, we performed ex vivo measurements of activity in
the brain, kidney, liver, and lung. The biodistribution of
99m
Tc(CO)3-HIS-cys-AnxA5-AF568 and 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cys-M1234AnxA5-AF568 is shown in Table 1. For both, the highest uptake
was in the kidneys (39.93%±14.39% of injected dose for
& 2014 ISCBFM

HIS-AnxA5 (n ¼ 13) versus 53.29%±6.73% for M1234 (n ¼ 2))
and the liver (11.40%±3.57% for HIS-AnxA5 versus 6.26%±3.11%
for M1234). Again, no uptake in the brain could be detected
(0.06%±0.05% for HIS-AnxA5 versus 0.06±0.01 for M1234).
Then, we performed ex vivo AnxA5 autoradiography and
hemalaun staining of the ischemic infarct (Figure 1B). Interestingly,
we found a spotty distribution of AnxA5 inside the brain. This was
even sometimes visible on the contralateral side (see Figure 1B,
48 hours) and was mostly conﬁned to inside the ventricles.
Furthermore, AnxA5 was also observable at the rim of the
slices. For autoradiography, data were distributed normally
(Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, Z ¼ 0.827, P ¼ 0.501), but variances
were not homogenous across groups (Levené test, F(3,11) ¼ 7.725,
P ¼ 0.005). Median target-to-background ratios were 1.22 for 24
hours (n ¼ 5), 1.15 for 48 hours (n ¼ 3), 2.32 for 72 hours (n ¼ 5),
and 1.78 for control at 72 hours (n ¼ 2). There was a signiﬁcant
effect in the omnibus test (Kruskal–Wallis test, w2(3,N ¼ 15) ¼
9.292, P ¼ 0.026, Z2 ¼ 0.664). Further post hoc analysis with Mann–
Whitney U and Bonferroni correction revealed no signiﬁcant
differences between the groups at a ¼ 0.05/6; corrected
a ¼ 0.0083 (P ¼ 0.881 for 24 versus 48 hours, P ¼ 0.009 for 24
versus 72 hours, P ¼ 0.053 for 24 hours versus control, P ¼ 0.051
for 48 versus 72 hours, P ¼ 0.236 for 48 versus control, P ¼ 0.439
for 72 hours versus control, two-tailed). For infarct volumetry, data
were normally distributed (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, Z ¼ 0.593,
P ¼ 0.874) and variances were homogenous across groups (Levené
test, F(3,11) ¼ 0.908, P ¼ 0.468). Mean infarct volumes were
62.36±30.62 for 24 hours (n ¼ 5), 47.21±31.18 for 48 hours
(n ¼ 3), 63.10±19.65 for 72 hours (n ¼ 5), and 72.96±8.17 for
control at 72 hours (n ¼ 2). There was no signiﬁcant effect of group
attendance (one-way analysis of variance, F(3,11) ¼ 0.445,
P ¼ 0.725, o2 ¼ 0.108). A Spearman’s rank order correlation was
run to determine the relationship between target-to-background
ratios and infarct sizes for all but the M1234 control animals. We
could not ﬁnd a correlation between the two (rs(11) ¼  0.113,
P ¼ 0.714; Figure 1C).
In Vivo AnxA5 SPECT Imaging and Ex Vivo AnxA5 Autoradiography
are Able to Detect Cell Death in a Model of Ethanol-Induced Cell
Death in the Femur Muscle
Mice received intravenous injection of 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cys-AnxA5AF568 (HIS-AnxA5) or the nonfunctional 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cysM1234-AnxA5-AF568 (M1234, negative control) 19 hours after
EtOH-induced cell death in the femur muscle. SPECT imaging was
performed immediately after and then every 30 minutes until 3.5
hours after injection. Only in the ipsilateral muscle was a signal
detected, but not in the contralateral muscle; and only in animals
receiving HIS-AnxA5, not in those receiving M1234 control
(Figure 2A).
Thereafter, we performed ex vivo measurements of activity in
the muscles, kidney, liver, and lung. The biodistribution of HISAnxA5 and M1234 control is shown in Table 1. As for the MCAO
animals, the highest uptake for both was in the kidneys
(47.00%±1.51% of injected dose for HIS-AnxA5 (n ¼ 5) versus
45.90%±6.01% for M1234 (n ¼ 3)) and the liver (13.23%±4.45%
for HIS-AnxA5 versus 7.96%±0.35% for M1234). More importantly,
uptake into the ipsilateral muscle was detected (0.48%±0.33% for
HIS-AnxA5 versus 0.47%±0.22% for M1234).
We then performed ex vivo AnxA5 autoradiography of slices of
ipsilateral and contralateral muscle (Figure 2B). Data were
distributed normally (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, Z ¼ 0.577,
P ¼ 0.894) and variances were homogenous across groups (Levené
test, F(1,6) ¼ 2.007, P ¼ 0.206). Mean target-to-background ratios
of 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cys-AnxA5-AF568 were signiﬁcantly higher
(3.86±1.12, n ¼ 5) compared with M1234 control (1.84±0.47,
n ¼ 3) (independent t-test, t(6) ¼ 2.898, P ¼ 0.027, and r ¼ 0.762;
Figure 2C).

Since the injected AnxA5 is ﬂuorescently labeled with AF568,
we were also able to perform ﬂuorescence microscopy. Only
animals undergoing ethanol-induced cell death in the left femur
muscle injected with 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cys-AnxA5-AF568 displayed
ﬂuorescent spots on the tissue (Figure 3).
DISCUSSION
The objective of this study was to investigate the suitability of
99m
Tc(CO)3-HIS-cys-AnxA5-AF568 for visualizing cell death after

murine focal cerebral ischemia in vivo. Annexin A5 has been
widely used for imaging cell death under various disease
conditions. It had been described earlier for use in stroke both
in animal models and in humans.8,9 Our results do not support the
notion that the dual-labeled AnxA5 used here is suited for imaging
cell death after focal cerebral ischemia in vivo in the mouse.
In the present study, we intravenously injected 99mTc(CO)3-HIScys-AnxA5-AF568 and the nonfunctional control 99mTc(CO)3-HIScys-M1234-AnxA5-AF568 into mice at 24, 48, and 72 hours after
reperfusion after MCAO. Strikingly, using in vivo SPECT imaging we
found no accumulation of the marker at any of the time points
investigated. Based on our previous results using a near-infrared
marker for AnxA5,10 we expected speciﬁc binding of AnxA5 to
dead/dying cells in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the infarct. Also,
99m
Tc-labeled AnxA5 had been used in two previous studies
investigating stroke patients and MCAO in rats8 and mice.9 In
contrast, we used an HIS-tagged ‘second generation’ AnxA5
previously shown to be superior to ‘ﬁrst generation’ 99mTc-HYNICAnxA5 in terms of in vivo afﬁnity, distribution in the body, stability,
and radiolabeling yields.11 However, a study using photothrombotic stroke model also failed to detect in vivo 68Ga-cys2-AnxA5,
another second generation AnxA5; 68Ga-cys2-AnxA5 was
detectable only with ex vivo autoradiography.13
One of the reasons why we did not detect a signal in vivo might
be that SPECT is not sensitive enough. To investigate this issue, we
performed ex vivo activity measurements using an activity meter.
We found AnxA5 to be enriched mostly in the kidneys, resulting
from high phosphatidylserine expression in the cortex of the
kidneys,14 and the liver, where it was also detected in SPECT. This
biodistribution was very similar to what has previously been
reported.13,15,16 In the brain, we did not ﬁnd any enrichment of
AnxA5 signal using ex vivo activity measurements. As a next step,
we performed ex vivo autoradiography, which is more sensitive
than SPECT imaging. We found that target-to-background ratios
did not differ signiﬁcantly between the groups, indicating that
AnxA5 could not be speciﬁcally enriched in the brain after 60minute MCAO. Also, infarct volumes between the groups were
similar and target-to-background ratios did not correlate with
infarct size. We did, however, detect a low signal (in the range of
0.01 kBq or lower) below the brain. This can be attributed to
salivary glands consistent with spontaneous cell death as part of
the homeostatic regulation of cell number and differentiation.17 In
addition, AnxA5 has been shown to accumulate inside the salivary
glands.18
In contrast to our ﬁndings in the MCAO model, we showed
that 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cys-AnxA5-AF568 indeed binds to dead/
damaged cells in a model of ethanol-induced cell death in the
femur muscle. 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cys-AnxA5-AF568, but not the
nonfunctional 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cys-M1234-AnxA5-AF568, was detected in vivo using SPECT imaging. We also found signiﬁcantly

larger target-to-background ratios compared with 99mTc(CO)3-HIScys-M1234-AnxA5-AF568 in ex vivo autoradiography and a
biodistribution similar to that found in the MCAO animals, in
which the organs most highly enriched with AnxA5 were also the
kidney and liver.19–21
It is likely that AnxA5 was not detected in the brain because it
did not cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). It has previously been
shown that the BBB is disrupted after experimental focal cerebral
ischemia in a biphasic manner.22–24 However, it should be
emphasized that the BBB permeability ‘state’ is not an all-ornothing event, but rather that the ‘tightness and selectivity’ seem
Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2014), e1 – e7

to vary. Extravasation of tracers across the BBB, even if impaired,
critically depends on their physicochemical properties and molecular weight. It cannot be foreseen for a particular compound and
therefore needs to be evaluated.25 In the case of Annexin,
however, the difference in molecular weight between the different
AnxA5 compounds seems to be negligible, with B36,500 Da for
Cy5.5-AnxA5 and 38,650 Da for HIS-cys-AnxA5-AF568.
Furthermore, the blood half-life of the dual-labeled AnxA5 used
is B20 minutes in mice,26 which might not be enough time for
AnxA5 to reach the brain. We recently developed a longcirculating version of AnxA5 with a blood half-life of B1 hour,
which needs to be further investigated.16 In addition, it has been
described that continuous tracer infusion or step-down infusion
compared with single-bolus infusion may enhance tracer
delivery.27–29 Also, intraventricular infusion of AnxA5 might be a
possibility to overcome the BBB. These options should be
investigated in further studies.
Furthermore, we found a spotty distribution of AnxA5 inside the
brain. Interestingly, AnxA5 signal was often located in the
ventricles on both hemispheres. AnxA5 was also observable at
the rim of the slices. This suggests that AnxA5 might have drained
into the cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) via the blood–CSF barrier at the
choroid plexus and the outer CSF–brain barrier between the CSFﬁlled subarachnoid space and overlying structures. In fact, the
choroidal endothelium has no restrictive effect on large molecule
transfer between blood and CSF. It has been shown that proteins
can quickly equilibrate in the stromal compartment and ﬁll the
basolateral intercellular spaces up to the tight junction complexes.30 In our previous study on AnxA5 uptake after MCAO, we
found AnxA5 signal at the choroid plexus.10
All in all, it seems as if near-infrared ﬂuorescently labeled AnxA5
has characteristics that allow it to cross the BBB, which might not
be the case for 99mTc(CO)3-HIS-cys-AnxA5-AF568. Whether AnxA5
can successfully label dead cells in the brain critically depends
upon its label. However, we have shown that when AnxA5 reaches
the brain, it binds to dead cells with a high speciﬁcity. Whether the
BBB is truly the reason for insufﬁcient accumulation of duallabeled AnxA5 remains to be elucidated in further studies, e.g., by
co-administration studies using albumin or injecting AnxA5
directly into the ventricle.
In conclusion, our study indicates that the dual-labeled AnxA5
applied is not suited to visualize death of brain cells in a 60-minute
mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia in vivo. Whether this is
because of a lack of tracer penetration into the brain cannot be
inferred from our study and might be the subject of further study.
