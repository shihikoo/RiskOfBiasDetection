According to the French paradox, red wine consumption reduces the incidence of vascular diseases even in the
presence of highly saturated fatty acid intake. This phenomenon is widely attributed to the phytoalexin resveratrol, a red wine ingredient. Experimental studies suggesting that resveratrol has neuroprotective properties
mostly used prophylactic delivery strategies associated with short observation periods. These studies did not
allow conclusions to be made about resveratrol's therapeutic efﬁcacy post-stroke. Herein, we systematically analyzed effects of prophylactic, acute and post-acute delivery of resveratrol (50 mg/kg) on neurological recovery,
tissue survival, and angioneurogenesis after focal cerebral ischemia induced by intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. Over an observation period of four weeks, only prolonged post-acute resveratrol delivery
induced sustained neurological recovery as assessed by rota rod, tight rope and corner turn tests. Although prophylactic and acute resveratrol delivery reduced infarct volume and enhanced blood–brain-barrier integrity at
2 days post-ischemia by elevating resveratrol's downstream signal sirtuin-1, increasing cell survival signals
(phosphorylated Akt, heme oxygenase-1, Bcl-2) and decreasing cell death signals (Bax, activated caspase-3), a
sustained reduction of infarct size on day 28 was not observed in any of the three experimental conditions. Instead, enhanced angiogenesis and neurogenesis were noted in animals receiving post-acute resveratrol delivery,
which were associated with elevated concentrations of GDNF and VEGF in the brain. Thus, sustained neurological
recovery induced by resveratrol depends on successful brain remodeling rather than structural neuroprotection.
The recovery promoting effect of delayed resveratrol delivery opens promising perspectives for stroke therapy.

1. Introduction
The polyphenolic phytoalexin resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxystilbene)
is an ingredient of red wine, whose effect is postulated to explain the
low incidence of vascular diseases in French citizens that is noted in red
wine consumers even in the presence of highly saturated fatty acid intake
(French paradox) (Catalgol et al., 2012; Vidavalur et al., 2006). Resveratrol exists as cis and trans isomers, of which the trans isomer is more stable and biologically more effective (Camont et al., 2009; Mikulski et al.,
2010). Whether or not resveratrol mediates the protective effects of red

wine is still debated, taking into account that resveratrol concentrations
in red wine are low (Agatonovic-Kustrin et al., 2015).
In the ﬁrst study evaluating the effects of resveratrol in an ischemic
stroke model in rodents, resveratrol exhibited neuroprotective properties, which were attributed to anti-oxidant and platelet-inhibiting effects of the phytoalexin (Huang et al., 2001). In the meantime several
studies conﬁrmed these neuroprotective effects, implying additional
mechanisms, such as microvascular protection, maintenance of blood–
brain-barrier (BBB) integrity, anti-inﬂammation and stabilization of
neuronal mitochondrial function (Clark et al., 2012; Dong et al., 2008;
Li et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2011; Shin et al., 2010; Tsai et al., 2007;
Wang et al., 2013; Yousuf et al., 2009).
The clinical relevance of resveratrol studies was so far limited by
non-therapeutic study designs. The majority of studies used prophylactic (i.e., pre-ischemic) resveratrol delivery protocols. Only three studies
administered resveratrol after stroke, demonstrating neuroprotective

effects when resveratrol was delivered at the onset of reperfusion
(Dong et al., 2008; Tsai et al., 2007) or up to 3 h (to some extent also
6 h) after reperfusion (Shin et al., 2010). In these studies, survival
promoting effects of resveratrol were demonstrated at one day (Tsai
et al., 2007), three days (Shin et al., 2010) or seven days (Dong et al.,
2008) post-stroke. So far, no studies have reported beneﬁcial effects of
more delayed resveratrol delivery and no studies reported sustained
neurological recovery that persisted beyond one week. The lack of
such studies precludes clinical studies in human stroke patients,
where the therapeutic potential needs to be clearly deﬁned.
To better deﬁne resveratrol's effects in the stroke recovery phase, we
systematically compared effects of prophylactic, acute and post-acute
resveratrol delivery after focal cerebral ischemia, performing a comprehensive analysis of motor and coordination deﬁcits in addition to
histochemical and molecular biological analyses, in which tissue
survival and brain remodeling were evaluated in the acute and subacute
stroke phase. Thereby, for the ﬁrst time we identiﬁed a neurorestorative
action of resveratrol, which—rather than enhanced neuronal survival—
contributes to sustained neurological recovery in the ischemic brain.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental procedures
All studies were performed according to local government authorities (LANUV) and were in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines
(Animal Research: Reporting in Vivo Experiments) for how to report
animal experiments. Animals had free access to food and water and
were kept under circadian rhythm. In vivo studies were performed on
male C57BL6 mice (Harlan, Germany; 20–25 g). Animals were strictly
randomized to experimental groups, and both experimenters and analysts were blinded at all stages of the study with regard to which experimental group (resveratrol vs. control) the animal in question belonged.
Induction of stroke was performed as stated below, and mice were
allowed to survive for up to four weeks. Detailed information regarding
treatment paradigms and mice used for statistical analysis is given
in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1. Resveratrol
(Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) preparation was essentially done as previously
described (Shah et al., 2014). Brieﬂy, resveratrol was ﬁrst dissolved in
100% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) with subsequent dilution in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) achieving a ﬁnal DMSO concentration of 2%. Mice received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 100 μl of 2% DMSO containing
50 mg/kg resveratrol, whereas control animals received i.p. injections of
2% DMSO (100 μl) only. The resveratrol dose was chosen according to previous work that used doses between 20 and 50 mg/kg (Clark et al., 2012;
Dong et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2006; Shah et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2002).
Three conceptually different delivery paradigms were chosen, i.e.,
(a) daily pre-ischemic injections starting on day −7 until day 0,
(b) acute post-ischemic injections on day 0 (immediately after reperfusion) and day +1 (24 h after reperfusion), as well as (c) daily postacute injections starting on day +1 (24 h after reperfusion) continued
until animal sacriﬁce (on day 2 or day 28). Post-ischemic cell proliferation,
angiogenesis and neurogenesis were evaluated by daily i.p. injections of
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; Sigma-Aldrich; 50 mg/kg) on days 21–28.
2.2. Oxygen-glucose deprivation
Cortical mouse neurons were prepared as previously described
(Doeppner et al., 2013). Cells were seeded on glass cover slips that had

exposed to intraluminal middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion receiving (A) prophylactic, (B) acute or (C) post-acute treatment with vehicle or resveratrol (50 mg/kg/day, i.p.). Prophylactic treatment consisted of daily vehicle or resveratrol injections over 7 days before stroke, acute treatment involved injections at the onset of reperfusion and 24 h later.

been coated with poly-L-ornithine/laminin (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) at
a density of 120,000/cm2 and incubated under standard cell culture conditions for ﬁve days. Cells were exposed to resveratrol using a concentration of 50 μM (Capiralla et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2014;
Sakata et al., 2010)) either before (starting 24 h earlier) or immediately
after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) that was induced in a hypoxic
chamber (1% O2, 5% CO2, remainder N2) for 45 min with subsequent
recultivation under standard cell culture conditions for additional
twenty-four hours. Neuronal injury and survival were assessed using a
cell viability and cytotoxicity assay kit (Cell Biolabs, Germany) following
the manufacturer's protocol using a ﬂuorimetric microtiter reader
(Fluoroskan Ascent™ FL Fluorometer, ThermoScientiﬁc, Germany) for
detection of ethidium homodimer and calcein.

2.3. Induction of focal cerebral ischemia
Mice were anesthetized (1–1.5% isoﬂurane, 30% O2, remainder N2O)
and exposed to 45 min of intraluminal middle cerebral artery (MCA)
occlusion (Doeppner et al., 2012b). Throughout the study until 15 min
after reperfusion, laser Doppler ﬂow (LDF; Perimed, Sweden) was recorded above the left MCA territory. A midline incision was performed and the

left common carotid artery (CCA) was exposed and ligated. A nylon
monoﬁlament with a tip diameter of 180 μm (Doccol, USA) was inserted
into the CCA and gently moved forward until the origin of the left MCA.
After 45 min, the monoﬁlament was removed and all wounds were appropriately sutured.

2.4. Analysis of post-stroke neurological recovery
Neurological recovery was evaluated using the rota rod, tight
rope and corner turn tests, as described before by our group (e.g., see
(Doeppner et al., 2014a)). Prior to stroke induction, all mice were
trained in order to ensure adequate performance. In the rota rod test,
which evaluates motor and coordination deﬁcits, the time until the animal dropped off the accelerating rotating drum (velocity 4–40 rpm
with maximal testing time of 300 s) was measured. The data for each
time point was obtained in duplicate and used to obtain an average
value. In the tight rope test, which evaluates coordinated walking
abilities, a validated score from 0 (min) to 20 (max) was obtained.
This test was also performed in duplicates as done for the aforementioned rota rod test. In the corner turn test, in which the mice were
placed into an apparatus consisting of two vertical boards with an

and DV—2.5–3.25 mm, thus representing the ischemic lesion site as previously reported (Doeppner et al., 2012a, 2012b, 2014b). Quantitative
analysis was done on three sections per animal and per staining, using a
Zeiss microscope (Germany) equipped with an ApoTome. The analysis included the quantiﬁcation of absolute numbers of BrdU+ cells within the
lesion site as well as the analysis of percentages of BrdU+ cells coexpressing the immature neuronal marker doublecortin (Dcx), the mature neuronal marker NeuN, the astrocytic marker glial ﬁbrillary acidic
protein (GFAP), the oligodendroglial marker 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′phosphodiesterase (CNPase), the microglial marker Ib4, and the endothelial marker CD31. As such, the following primary antibodies were used:
monoclonal mouse anti-BrdU antibody (1:400; Roche, Switzerland),
monoclonal rat anti-BrdU antibody (1:400; Abcam, UK), polyclonal goat
anti-Dcx antibody (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Germany), monoclonal mouse anti-NeuN antibody (1:1000; Millipore, UK), polyclonal goat
anti-GFAP (1:1000; Abcam), monoclonal mouse anti-CNPase antibody
(1:400; Millipore, UK), a rat biotin-conjugated anti-Ib4 antibody (1:100;
Vector Labs, UK), and monoclonal rat CD31 (1:200, BD Biosciences,
Germany). Sections were incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with primary antibodies and thereafter incubated with secondary antibodies, which were goat
anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:100; Jackson ImmunoResearch, UK), goat antimouse Cy-3 (1:400; Dianova, Germany), goat anti-rat Alexa 594 (1:400;
Dianova), and donkey anti-goat Alexa 488 (1:250; Invitrogen, Germany).
2.7. Analysis of blood–brain-barrier (BBB) integrity
BBB integrity was measured two days after stroke by intravenous
injection of Evans blue (2%, 2 ml/kg) 2 h before animal sacriﬁce.
Measurements were performed using homogenates from ischemic left
hemispheres with subsequent photometric analysis of Evans blue
extravasation, as previously described (Chiba et al., 2008). Results
were given as (μg) Evans blue dye per (g) tissue.

injections over 7 days before stroke, acute treatment involved injections at the onset of reperfusion and 24 h later. Post-acute treatment included daily injections starting 24 h after reperfusion that were continued until animal sacriﬁce. Representative microphotographs are

angle of 30°, the laterality index, deﬁned as (number of right turns/ten
measurements) was evaluated. A score of 1 indicated severe movement
preference as a result of stroke-induced neurological impairment,
whereas a score of 0.5 indicated no neurological impairment.
2.5. Animal sacriﬁce and brain histology
On day 2 or 28 following stroke, mice were sacriﬁced by i.p. injection
of a lethal chloralhydrate dose (420 mg/kg) followed by transcardial
perfusion with normal saline and normal saline containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and cut on a cryostat into coronal
20 μm sections that were stained with cresyl violet for infarct volumetry
(Herz et al., 2014) or used for immunohistochemistry.
2.6. Histochemical analysis of angioneurogenesis and microglial activity
Post-ischemic angioneurogenesis was analyzed within four regions of
interest (ROIs) that were localized at AP + 0.14 mm, ML ± 1.5–2.25 mm

Ischemic left hemispheres were homogenized in a buffer containing
50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.05% BRIJ-35,
0.02% NaN3 and 1% Triton X-100. Homogenates were centrifuged with
pellets being resuspended in elution buffer (10% DMSO and 20% volume
of lysis buffer), as previously described (Doeppner et al., 2012b). Protein
concentrations were measured by means of the bicinchoninic acid method (BCA kit, Thermo Scientiﬁc, Germany). By means of Novex Zymogram
Gels (Invitrogen), MMP-9 was separated into its pro-form and active
form. A 10% SDS–PAGE gel containing 0.1% gelatin was used for electrophoresis. Samples were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C with subsequent staining of gels with Coomassie blue for 30 min. Human pro-MMP-9 (0.1 ng)
and activated MMP-9 (0.01 ng; both from Merck Biosciences, Germany)
were used as standards. Gels were densitometrically analyzed.
2.9. Analysis of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances
Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring peroxidation of
fatty acids. During peroxidation, thiobarbituric acid (TBA) reactive
substances (TBARS) like malondialdehyde (MDA) are generated, which
reacts with thiobarbituric acid, giving rise to a chromogenic compound.
Using homogenates of ischemic left hemispheres, the latter chromogene
was photometrically measured, as described (Doeppner et al., 2013).
2.10. Determination of caspase 3 activity
Caspase 3 activity was determined in cell lysates and homogenates
of left ischemic hemispheres using the non-ﬂuorescent substrate
Ac-DEVD-AMC (50 μM; Biomol, Germany), which is cleaved by caspase
3 thus releasing the ﬂuorescent product AMC. Fluorescence was
detected over 20 min at two-minute intervals, as described (Doeppner
et al., 2011). Caspase 3 activity was given as pmol/min/mg protein.

injections at the onset of reperfusion and 24 h later. Post-acute treatment included a single injection 24 h after reperfusion. *p b 0.05 compared with corresponding controls.

2.11. Western blots of neuronal survival and cell death pathways
Tissue samples obtained from left ischemic hemispheres were
homogenized in 50 mmol/L Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton
X-100, and protease inhibitors, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using equal amounts of
protein. Primary antibodies were as follows: polyclonal rabbit antisirtuin-1 (SIRT-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal rabbit antiphosphorylated Akt (Abcam), monoclonal mouse anti-heme oxygenase1 (HO-1; Abcam), polyclonal rabbit anti-Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
and monoclonal rabbit anti-Bax (Abcam). Peroxidase-labeled secondary
antibodies were as follows: goat anti-rabbit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
and goat anti-mouse (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After
blotting, membranes were scanned and densitometrically analyzed.

(NGF; Promega, Germany), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF;
Promega), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF; Promega),
and ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF; R&D Systems) were determined.
2.13. Statistics
Data are given as means ± standard deviation (SD). For statistical
comparison between two groups, the student's t-test was applied,
whereas one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey's
post hoc test was done for comparison between multiple groups.
P values b0.05 were regarded as statistically signiﬁcant.

2.12. Growth factor analyses
Selected growth factors were determined in left ischemic hemispheres on day twenty-eight post-stroke, as previously described
(Doeppner et al., 2014b). Left hemispheres were lysed and homogenized in a buffer of 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM
CaCl2, 0.05% BRIJ-35, 0.02% NaN3 and 1% Triton X-100. Using enzyme
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), contents of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; R&D Systems, USA), nerve growth factor

Considering that in vitro studies on resveratrol predominantly used
prophylactic (i.e., pre-ischemic) delivery protocols (Gao et al., 2014;
Huang et al., 2014; Sakata et al., 2010), we ﬁrst analyzed effects of resveratrol on the survival of primary cortical neurons exposed to OGD.
Hence, cultured neurons were incubated with resveratrol either before
or immediately after OGD, followed by 24 h recultivation under standard cell culture conditions. Both prophylactic and acute resveratrol exposure reduced neuronal injury, as evaluated by ethidium homodimer

Prophylactic treatment consisted of daily vehicle or resveratrol injections over 7 days before
stroke, acute treatment involved injections at the onset of reperfusion and 24 h later. Post-acute treatment included a single injection 24 h after reperfusion. Protein loading was controlled

accumulation in cell membranes (Fig. 1A). This neuroprotection
was ssociated with reduced oxidative stress evaluated by TBARS
formation species (Fig. 1B) and reduced caspase 3 activity (Fig. 1C),
suggesting that resveratrol induces neuroprotection when delivered
post-ischemia.

3.2. Prolonged post-acute, but not prophylactic or acute resveratrol delivery
induces sustained neurological recovery after focal cerebral ischemia
Using the rota rod, tight rope and corner turn test, we next
compared effects of prophylactic, acute and post-acute resveratrol

delivery on motor coordination deﬁcits over an observation period of up
to 28 days after intraluminal MCA occlusion. These tests allow an analysis of subtle post-ischemic neurological impairment as evaluated before (Doeppner et al., 2014a), with all animals scoring 300 s (rota rod
test), N18.0 (tight rope test), and 0.46–0.55 (corner turn test) before induction of stroke. While prophylactic and acute resveratrol treatment
temporarily improved motor coordination only—no signiﬁcant differences between groups were observed at the end of the observation
period—(Fig. 2A–B), prolonged post-acute resveratrol treatment induced sustained neurological recovery (Fig. 2C).
3.3. Resveratrol does not induce long-term neuroprotection after focal
cerebral ischemia
To elucidate whether enhanced neurological recovery was a consequence of structural neuroprotection, we next analyzed infarct volumes
two and 28 days after stroke. Reduced infarct volumes were noted after
prophylactic and acute, but not post-acute resveratrol treatment two
days after stroke (Fig. 3A). In line with this, microglial activity on day
2 was signiﬁcantly reduced after both prophylactic and acute resveratrol treatment, but not so after post-acute treatment. En detail, Ib4+
cells (given per mm2) were 126.8 ± 28.3 (resveratrol) vs. 287.6 ±
46.0 (controls) after prophylactic treatment, 108.7 ± 19.4 (resveratrol)
vs. 239.8 ± 32.7 (controls) after acute treatment, and 189.2 ± 50.4
(resveratrol) vs. 262.1 ± 35.2 (controls) after post-acute treatment.
The reduction in infarct volume, however, was lost 28 days after stroke,
thus indicating that neuroprotection induced by resveratrol was only
transient (Fig. 3B). Acute neuroprotection by resveratrol was associated
with reduced BBB breakdown, as assessed by Evans blue extravasation
(Fig. 4A), decreased MMP-9 activity (Fig. 4B), reduced oxidative stress
(Fig. 4C) and reduced caspase 3 activity (Fig. 4D) two days after stroke.
3.4. Prophylactic and acute resveratrol delivery increase downstream target
SIRT-1 modulating neuronal survival and death pathways
To evaluate how resveratrol inﬂuenced cell signaling, Western blots
were employed. Interestingly, prophylactic and acute resveratrol treatment increased the abundance of resveratrol's downstream target SIRT1 (Fig. 5A,B), increased the abundance of neuronal survival-associated
phosphorylated Akt, HO-1 and Bcl-2 proteins (Fig. 5A,C–E) and
decreased the abundance of neuronal death-associated Bax protein
(Fig. 5A,F) two days after stroke. Post-acute resveratrol treatment did
not affect these cell signaling proteins.
3.5. Post-acute resveratrol delivery stimulates
angioneurogenesis and increases microglial activity

post-ischemic

Analysis of BrdU+ cells within the lesion site revealed signiﬁcantly
increased numbers of proliferating cells in mice receiving post-acute,
but not prophylactic or acute resveratrol delivery 28 days after
stroke. Thus, we observed 45.7 ± 6.2 (control group) vs. 56.2 ± 11.8
(resveratrol group) BrdU+ cells per mm2 after prophylactic delivery,
61.2 ± 17.1 (control group) vs. 51.0 ± 4.8 (resveratrol group) BrdU+
cells per mm2 after acute delivery, and 59.3 ± 8.2 (control group) vs.
104.3 ± 12.4 (resveratrol group; p b 0.05) BrdU+ cells per mm2 after
post-acute delivery. Differentiation analysis of BrdU+ cells revealed signiﬁcantly increased expression of the neuronal markers Dcx and NeuN
(Fig. 6A,B) and the endothelial marker CD31 (Fig. 6C) after post-acute,
but not prophylactic or acute resveratrol treatment. Of note, coexpression rates of BrdU with NeuN were low in all groups, which

23

could be contributed in part to the BrdU treatment paradigm chosen.
We did not detect any effect of resveratrol on the expression of the astrocytic marker GFAP in BrdU+ cells, nor was there any effect on the expression of the oligodendroglial marker CNPase in BrdU+ cells (data not
shown). Interestingly, post-acute delivery of resveratrol also resulted in
increased co-labeling of BrdU+ cells with the microglial marker Ib4,
albeit numbers of co-labeling cells were low in all experimental groups
(Fig. 6D).
3.6. Post-acute resveratrol delivery modulates the extracellular growth
factor microenvironment
To identify signals responsible for the enhanced neurogenesis and
angiogenesis, concentrations of the growth factors BDNF, FGF, GDNF,
NGF and VEGF were analyzed by ELISA in ischemic brain tissue
28 days after stroke. While prophylactic and acute resveratrol treatment
did not inﬂuence concentrations of these growth factors, prolonged
post-acute resveratrol treatment increased brain concentrations of the
neurotrophic growth factor GDNF and the vascular growth factor
VEGF (Table 1).
4. Discussion
The present study demonstrates that prolonged post-acute, but not
prophylactic or acute resveratrol delivery induces sustained neurological recovery after focal cerebral ischemia in mice, which is associated
with enhanced neurogenesis and angiogenesis. On the contrary, prophylactic and acute post-ischemic resveratrol treatment only transiently enhanced neurological recovery that was associated with temporary
neuroprotection, which was lost in the post-acute stroke phase when
neurological recovery effects vanished.
That prolonged resveratrol delivery induces sustained neurological
recovery, when delivered with a delay of 24 h after stroke, is new.
This recovery-promoting action was independent of neuroprotection,
which was noticed only after prophylactic (over seven days prior to
stroke) and acute (starting at the onset of reperfusion), but not postacute (starting 24 h after reperfusion) resveratrol delivery. Importantly,
neurological recovery associated with early neuroprotection was no
more detectable after 28 days, suggesting that the acute treatment
effects were not persistent, unless accompanied by successful brain remodeling. Neuroprotective effects of post-ischemic resveratrol delivery
have previously been shown in three studies, in which resveratrol was
applied at the onset of reperfusion (Dong et al., 2008; Tsai et al., 2007)
or up to 3 h (to some extent also 6 h) after reperfusion (Shin et al.,
2010). In these studies, survival promoting effects of resveratrol were
observed on day one (Tsai et al., 2007), on day three (Shin et al.,
2010) and on day seven (Dong et al., 2008) post-stroke.
Resveratrol is thought to bind its downstream signal SIRT-1, thereby
inhibiting oxidative stress and stabilizing mitochondrial function (Sun
et al., 2010). In line with earlier studies showing increased SIRT-1
expression upon prophylactic and acute resveratrol delivery after focal
cerebral ischemia in mice (Shin et al., 2012), we observed an elevated
SIRT-1 abundance after prophylactic and acute, but not after postacute resveratrol delivery. Also in line with earlier studies revealing
increased Akt phosphorylation (Shin et al., 2012; Simao et al., 2012a),
increased HO-1 expression (Ren et al., 2011; Sakata et al., 2010), reduced oxidative stress (Ren et al., 2011; Yousuf et al., 2009), increased
Bcl-2 expression (Li et al., 2012) and decreased Bax expression
(Li et al., 2012) associated with reduced neuronal apoptosis (Li et al.,

rodents, we described increased Akt phosphorylation, increased HO-1
expression, reduced TBARS formation, reduced MMP-9 activity, increased Bcl-2 expression, decreased Bax expression and decreased caspase 3 activity after prophylactic and acute, but not after post-acute
resveratrol delivery.
Expanding previous observations that resveratrol induces profound
microvascular protection increasing the density of surviving brain capillaries in the early phase of the stroke (Dong et al., 2008), prolonged
post-acute, but not prophylactic or acute resveratrol delivery increased
post-ischemic neurogenesis and angiogenesis after focal cerebral
ischemia. The observation that resveratrol increases post-ischemic
neurogenesis is new. It has previously been shown that resveratrol reduces neurogenesis in adult healthy mice (Park et al., 2012), but increases neurogenesis in prenatally stressed adult rats (Madhyastha
et al., 2013) and adult chronic fatigue mice exposed to Brucella abortus
antigen (Moriya et al., 2011). That resveratrol enhances angiogenesis
has previously been reported in endothelial proliferation, migration
and tube formation assays using cultured cerebral endothelial cells
(Simao et al., 2012b). In this context, Kodali and colleagues showed
that resveratrol is able to not only induce neurogenesis and angiogenesis under non-ischemic conditions but to also modify microglial
activity (Kodali et al., 2015). In the present study, microglial activity
was decreased during the acute phase of the disease by resveratrol
treatment, whereas four weeks after stroke proliferating cells
expressing a microglial phenotype were—though on an overall low
level—signiﬁcantly increased after resveratrol treatment. Taking into account the complex role of the immune system during stroke with acute
leukocytosis and secondary immunosuppression (Dirnagl et al., 2007;
Famakin, 2014; Gelderblom et al., 2009; Macrez et al., 2011), reduction
of the post-stroke microglial response on day two additionally contributes to acute neuroprotection. On the other hand, increased numbers of
microglia during the chronic stage of the disease could be a source for
cell mediators that might help neurological recovery after stroke.
The enhanced neurogenesis and angiogenesis along with the aforementioned increased microglial activity were associated with elevated
brain GDNF and VEGF concentrations, indicating that resveratrol
reshaped the cerebral microenvironment. Elevated VEGF concentrations have previously been observed in the ischemic brain after acute
resveratrol delivery (Dong et al., 2008) and in cultured cerebral endothelial cells upon resveratrol exposure (Simao et al., 2012b). In cultured
cerebral endothelial cells, inhibition of VEGFR2 prevented resveratrolinduced angiogenesis (Simao et al., 2012b). Thus, secretion of growth
factors from NPCs migrating toward the lesion site or from microglial
cells together with a mutual interplay between neurogenesis and angiogenesis might be one key element for resveratrol-induced sustained
neurological recovery. The latter is independent of the extent of
histological brain injury, i.e., neurological recovery can be achieved
even without reduction of post-stroke brain injury as shown in another
context before (Doeppner et al., 2014b). Nevertheless, some limitations
of the present study apply that could affect clinical translation in the
future. For instance, a previous report on a human brain endothelial
cell line and on bovine primary brain endothelial cells observed under
non-ischemic conditions anti-angiogenic effects by resveratrol, albeit

these effects were predominantly restricted to higher resveratrol concentrations such as 50 μM and above (Chen and Easton, 2011). These
observations, however, imply that resveratrol-induced effects described
in the literature may depend on concentrations used and on the tissue
or organ analyzed.
Despite the aforementioned theoretic limitations, the observation
that resveratrol enhances cerebral neurogenesis and angiogenesis may
have direct relevance in human patients, where resveratrol was found
to increase cerebral blood ﬂow, enhancing hippocampal functional connectivity and glucose metabolism (Kennedy et al., 2010; Wightman
et al., 2014; Witte et al., 2014). With this respect, the data open fascinating perspectives for cerebral hemodynamic, structural and functional
neuroimaging studies in human stroke patients, which may provide
valuable information about the therapeutic potential of resveratrol
as stroke recovery-promoting molecule. Taking into account the observation that recovery-promoting effects are not restricted to the early recovery time window, our study provides a rationale for the bench-tobeside translation of resveratrol, which based on its excellent tolerability is a reasonable candidate for stroke treatment.
