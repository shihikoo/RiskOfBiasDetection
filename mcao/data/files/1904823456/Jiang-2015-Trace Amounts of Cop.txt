Copper plays a crucial role in nutrition and normal brain function
[1,2]. In daily life, we come into contact copper easily in our
drinking water, food, and so on. The Environmental Protection
Agency’s (USA) maximum allowable contaminant level for copper
in municipal drinking water is 1.3 mg/L [1]. But in some areas,
especially in heavy metal pollution regions, copper content in the
water exceeds the maximal level [1,2]. Moreover, copper has been
implicated as an important factor in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and
Huntington’s disease (HD) [1,2]. However, there is limited information about the link between copper contamination of drinking
water and stroke (a devastating disease and the major cause of
mortality and morbidity worldwide) [3] to date.
Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are a circulating, bone marrow-derived cell population that participate in vasculogenesis by
differentiating into endothelial cells and play an important role in
tissue repairing and regeneration in ischemic brain [4,5]. Longterm studies indicate that the number and function of EPCs in
peripheral blood may be a new marker for stroke outcomes and
cumulative cardiovascular risk [4,5]. Thus, EPC dysfunction and
the consequent abnormality of endothelial regeneration may
influence the susceptibility to cerebral ischemic injury. In addition, the involvement of copper in the pathogenesis of vascular
dysfunction has been proposed [6]. Therefore, it can be logically
speculated that copper contamination of drinking water might
pose as a risk factor for stroke via impairing EPC function. To
address this issue, this study sought to determine the effect of trace
amounts of copper in drinking water on cerebral ischemic injury
and EPC functions in mice.
Male C57BL/6 mice (10–12 week, 20–25 g) used in these
experiments were obtained from Sino-British SIPPR/BK Lab Animal Ltd (Shanghai, China). All animals received humane care,

and the experimental procedures were in compliance with the
institutional animal care guidelines. Mice were given trace
amounts of copper (0.13 mg/L, about one-tenth of the Environmental Protection Agency’s maximum allowable contaminant
level in municipal drinking water) [1] as copper sulfate (469130;
Sigma, St. Louis, USA) and water (Control) via drinking water for
14 weeks. The body weights were monitored every week. After
long-term treatment, mice were subjected to permanent left middle cerebral artery occlusion by electrocoagulation, and the infarct
volumes and neurobehavioral outcomes were determined according to the published protocols [7]. It was found that there was no
significant difference in body weights between copper-treated and
control mice (data not shown). However, the infarct volumes
were significantly increased and the corresponding neurobehavioral outcomes were markedly impaired in copper-treated mice
compared with control (Figure 1A). These results indicate that
chronic exposure to trace amounts of copper could aggravate cerebral ischemic injury in mice.
To determine the potential mechanisms underlying trace
amounts of copper aggravating cerebral ischemic injury in mice,
EPC functions and local angiogenesis in ischemic brain were
assessed according to previously described technique [3,4,8]. It
was found that EPC functions (Figure 1B) and capillary density in
ischemic brain (Figure 1C) were significantly reduced in the copper-treated mice compared with control. EPCs can secret various
angiogenic growth factors to promote angiogenesis and have been
used to successfully restore endothelial function and enhance
angiogenesis in ischemic brain tissue [4,5]. Therefore, the increase
of cerebral ischemic injury produced by chronic copper intake
may be partly attributed to the EPC dysfunction and consequent
reduction of local angiogenesis in ischemic brain.

Copper and Cerebral Ischemic Injury in Mice

Next, we sought to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the EPC impairment in copper-treated mice. It was found
that, compared with control, p-eNOS and MnSOD expression levels (Figure 2A,B) and intracellular NO levels (Figure 2D) were significantly reduced, and TSP-1 expression levels (Figure 2C) were
markedly increased in EPCs from copper-treated mice. It has been

shown that eNOS and MnSOD critically regulate EPC function
[5,8], and decreased NO production can induce TSP-1 (a key
inhibitor of endothelial cell and EPC function) expression in cultured endothelial cells and EPCs [8,9]. Thus, the decreased
MnSOD and phosphorylated eNOS levels and consequent reduction in intracellular NO levels, together with the increase in TSP-1

levels, might represent a major mechanism underlying the EPC
dysfunction in copper-treated mice.
In conclusion, chronic intake of trace amounts of copper
aggravated cerebral ischemic injury in mice, which might be
partly attributed to the impairment of EPCs and consequent
reduction of angiogenesis in ischemic brain. This result implies
that copper contamination of drinking water might be a risk
factor for stroke, and the risk of cardiovascular diseases (especially stroke) might warrant further attention in heavy metal
pollution regions.
