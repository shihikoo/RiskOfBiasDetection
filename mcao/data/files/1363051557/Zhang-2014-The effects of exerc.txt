Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease with high incidence, morbidity, and mortality. Preischemic treadmill training has been shown to be effective in improving
behavioral and neuropathologic indices after cerebral ischemia. However, the exact
neuroprotective mechanism of preischemic treadmill training against ischemic
injury has not been elucidated clearly. The present study investigated whether preischemic treadmill training could protect the brain from ischemic injury via regulating cerebral blood flow (CBF) and endothelin 1 (ET-1). We analyzed the CBF by
laser speckle imaging and ET-1 expression by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay using an ischemic rat model with preischemic treadmill training. Generally
speaking, ET-1 expression decreased and CBF increased significantly in the pretreadmill group. It is worth noting that ET-1 expression is increased at 24 hours of
reperfusion in the pretreadmill group compared with the level of the time after middle cerebral artery occlusion. These changes were followed by significant changes in
neurologic deficits and cerebral infarct volume. This study indicated that preconditioning exercise protected brain from ischemic injury through the improvement of
CBF and regulation of ET-1 expression, which may be a novel component of the neuroprotective mechanism of preischemic treadmill training against brain
injury. Key Words: Preischemic treadmill trainingâ€”endothelin 1â€”cerebral blood
flowâ€”ischemic injury.

Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease with high
incidence, morbidity, and mortality. A lot of basic and
clinical research has been done on the pathogenesis of
stroke, but because of the potential impairments and the
limitation of treatments, finding out an effective prevention of stroke is particularly important.1 Among
numerous preventive measures, exercise is a kind of
safe and effective preventive measure and has been
widely accepted. Evidence showed that training could
elevate the cerebrovascular reactivity, which provided
further support to the concept that exercise is a preventive
measure in cerebrovascular and neurologic disease in the
aged.2 Research proved that exercise could increase the
number of small blood vessels in the brain of the healthy
old people3 and reduce the abnormal rheological properties of blood.4

EXERCISE INDUCED CBF AND ET-1 CHANGES AFTER ISCHEMIA

A previous article demonstrated that at least 2 weeks of
pretreadmill training (a kind of exercise way) was neuroprotective for cerebral ischemia rats.5,6 Likewise, other
studies have shown that pretreadmill training was
effective in improving behavioral and neuropathologic
indices after cerebral ischemia,7,8 and maintaining
neurovascular integrity,9 improving bloodâ€“brain barrier
function, and alleviating brain edema.10 In addition, the
pretreadmill training can reduce brain inflammation,
which is contributed to neuronal death following stroke
after cerebral ischemic injury.11-13
There may be many ways to explain the neuroprotection mechanism of pretreadmill training for cerebral
ischemia rats. Some studies4 have demonstrated that it
is possibly related to the bloodâ€“brain barrier, cerebrovascular, nerve cell apoptosis, glutamic acid system, inflammatory reaction, and the neurogenesis. Among these
reasons, the effect of pretreadmill training on a cerebrovascular system is particularly important.
Evidence showed that exercise can increase the number
of small blood vessels of the healthy elderly, and rat brain
capillary density and cortical blood volume.3,14 Studies
on monkey found that new blood vessels appeared after
5 months of sports and then returned to baseline levels
after stopping exercise for 12 weeks.15 Recent reports suggested that exercise could affect the vasomotor of cerebral
vessels and maintain enough oxygen in the brain by regulating cerebral blood flow (CBF) under ischemic and hypoxic conditions.16 Meanwhile, studies have identified that
hemodynamic shear stress was an important determinant
of endothelial function and phenotype.17
Endothelin (ET), which is mainly generated by the
vascular endothelial cells, is a polypeptide. It can cause
vasoconstriction with a slow, long-lasting, and wide
effect. ET is an important physiological and pathologic
factor in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.18 A previous report showed that exercise training enhanced endothelium-dependent nitric
oxide-mediated vasodilation in soleus and gastrocnemius
muscle arterioles.19
In addition, researches have shown that CBF change
could affect the synthesis and release of ET-1 and vice
versa.20 On the basis of these findings, in this study we
examined the influence of pretreadmill training on CBF
change and ET-1 expression during ischemia and reperfusion of rat brain from injury induced by middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO).

Materials and Methods
Animal Preparation
Adult male Spragueâ€“Dawley rats (weighing 250-300 g)
were provided by Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center,
Chinese Academy of Sciences. The rats were housed under a 12:12-hour light/dark cycle with food and water
available ad libitum.

1697

Treadmill Training
Rats were assigned randomly to 1 of the 3 groups
(sham, ischemic, or pretreadmill); pretreadmill group
rats were treated with 2 weeks of preischemic intervention. All rats received 2 days adaptive running exercise
of 5-8 m/minute for 30 minutes/day before the formal
treadmill training. After adaptive running, the rats in
the pretreadmill group started training on an electric
treadmill machine (DSPT-202 Type 5-Lane Treadmill;
Litai Biotechnology Co, Ltd, China), and then they were
scheduled to run on the treadmill for 2 weeks. The formal
treadmill training was prescribed as 20 m/minute, 30 minutes/day for 5 days/week.5 The rats in the sham and
ischemic groups ran freely in their cages for 2 weeks.
The rats in all groups were bred under the same conditions. Parameters for treadmill exercise were set at a slope
of 0 and belt speed of 20 m/minute.

Rat MCAO Model
Rats were anesthetized with 10% (vol/vol) chloral hydrate (.35 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) at the end of treadmill training, and using the modified Longaâ€™s method21
the rat model of left MCAO was established. The left
external carotid artery was occluded by the intraluminal
suture technique. A surgical nylon monofilament with a
blunt, silicone-coated tip (of .38 6 .02-mm diameter;
Beijing Shadong Biotech Co, Ltd, Beijing, China) was
immersed in heparin beforehand and inserted from the
middle cerebral artery (MCA) into the lumen of the internal carotid artery. When the nylon monofilament arrived
in the ostia of the MCA along the internal carotid artery,
the MCAO model is successfully built. The rectal temperature of rats was maintained at 37 C by placing them on a
heating pad during the whole surgical procedure. The
brain ischemia was measured using a laser Doppler velocimeter (laser doppler perfusion monitor, PeiFlux5000;
Perimed, Jarfalla, Sweden). After 120 minutes of cerebral
ischemia, the nylon monofilament was removed surgically to allow reperfusion. The same surgical procedure
was performed on sham surgical rats but without
occluding the MCA.

Evaluation of Behavioral Score
The rats in each group were evaluated at 24 hours after
reperfusion based on a 5-point scale: 0, no neurologic
symptoms; 1, unable to completely extend the front jaw
to the other side; 2, rotating when crawling, and falling
to the other side; 3, unable to walk without help; and 4,
unconsciousness.

Determination of Brain Infarction Volume
At 24 hours after reperfusion, rats were anesthetized
with chloral hydrate (10%). Brains were quickly removed
and stored at 220 C for 10 minutes. Brain tissues were cut

Q. ZHANG ET AL.

into 6 sections at a coronal plane. The thickness of each
section was 2 mm. The first cut was beginning at
the midline between the anterior pole and the optic chiasma. The sections were rapidly put into 2% 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution (37 C) for
30 minutes, and followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde buffer. The sections were photographed 24 hours
later with a digital camera (Kodak DC240; Eastman
Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). Imaging software (Adobe
Photoshop 7.0, Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA)
was used to trace the area of infarction.
Cresyl violet (CV) staining was also used to measure
the infarct volume as previously described.22 In brief,
frozen coronal brain sections were stained in .1% CV solution, followed by quick differentiation in 1% glacial acetic acid. The sections were dehydrated and clarified
through ethanol and xylene, respectively, and mounted
in neutral balsam. The infarct area was defined according
to the published article.23
To minimize the error introduced by edema, we used
an indirect method to calculate the infarct volumes.9

were used to quantify the CBF changes in fractional
terms. V 5 V/V0 3 100%.

Determination of ET-1 Levels in Plasma
Samples of blood were collected via jugular vein,
respectively, before MCAO (Pre-MCAO), at 0 hours after
MCAO (MCAO), and at 24 hours of reperfusion (Rep24 hours). Venous blood (2 mL) was collected in a tube
with ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid and aprotinin. All
blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 C, and the resulting supernatants were stored
at 280 C till further analysis. ET-1 in plasma was assayed
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Kit Xitang from Shanghai Biotechnology Co, Ltd, Shanghai,
China) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.

Statistical Analysis
All values are expressed as the mean 6 standard deviation. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 13.0
statistical software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Multiple comparisons between groups were analyzed using 1-way
analysis of variance followed by the Tamhane multiple
comparison post hoc test. A value of P less than .05 was
considered statistically significant.

Laser Speckle Imaging
All procedures were performed using standard sterile
precautions. The rat was anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate at a dose of
360 mg/kg. The animal was placed in a stereotactic frame
(David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) throughout the
experiment. The scalp was shaved and disinfected with
70% ethanol and povidoneâ€“iodine solution. After a
midline scalp incision, the galea and periosteum overlying the parietal bone bilaterally were swept and retracted laterally. The regions of interest, which were
centered at 2.5 mm posterior and 2.5 mm lateral to
the bregma over the left and right cortex with a
2.5 mm 3 5 mm area each, were thinned using a highspeed dental drill (SDE-H37L; Marathon, Korea), until
the inner cortical layer of a bone was encountered. Rectal
temperature was maintained at 37 C during the experiment using a homeothermic blanket system (model TP500T/Pump; Gaymar Industries, Inc, Orchard Park,
NY). The laser speckle images (696 3 512 pixels) were
acquired at 23 frames per second (exposure time
T 5 5 milliseconds) by laser speckle imaging (LSI) system
(Dolphin BioTech Ltd Shanghai, China) with a laser diode
(780 nm; Dolphin BioTech Ltd Shanghai) over the skull.24
The raw speckle images were processed by the random
process estimator method after registration25 to obtain
the contrast image. The blood flow speed V is related to
contrast value according to the theory of laser speckle
contrast imaging. Averaged data of the region of interest

Results
Neurologic Status and Cerebral Infarct Volume
To determine whether the observed changes in ET-1
expression and CBF accompanied by changes in behavioral recovery and lesion volume, we next evaluated
sham, ischemic exercise, and pretreadmill groups at
24 hours after ischemia. A 5-point neurologic scale score

Figure 1. Neurologic scores at 24 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion. The neurologic scores of sham animals were all zero (data not shown).
Relative to the ischemic group, the rats exposed to the pretreadmill group had
significant lower neurologic scores, indicating improvement (*P ,.05). Data
are expressed as the mean 6 standard deviation. n 5 8.

revealed that sham rats had no neurologic deficits. As
shown in Figure 1, the rats in the pretreadmill group
showed fewer deficits than those in the ischemic group
(3.20 6 .8). The rats treated with 2 weeks of preischemia
treadmill training demonstrated significantly better
neurologic statuses (2.20 6 .20).
After behavioral tests, the rats were sacrificed to
compare the ischemic area with the behavioral performances. Both TTC and CV staining methods were used
to determine the infarct volume. Similar to the results of
behavioral score evaluation, none of the sham rats had
ischemic areas. As shown in Figure 2, the rats in the
ischemia group had infarcts (47.44 6 3.46% by TTC staining and 39.95 6 2.5% by CV staining), whereas those in
the pretreadmill group showed a significant reduction
in the infarct volume (33.08 6 2.53% by TTC staining
and 27.76 6 2.58% by CV staining). The results showed
that exercise remarkably reduced the infarct volume.

ischemic groups (P , .05). Data indicated that preischemic treadmill training improved CBF during reperfusion.

ET-1 Expression
ET-1 regulates a diverse array of physiological processes including vasoconstriction, which is related to
CBF. To find out how exercise alleviates CBF change to
protect against ischemic injury, whether preischemic
treadmill training may affect the expression of ET-1 was
investigated. The concentration of ET-1 was determined
at different time points of Pre-MCAO, MCAO, and Rep24 hours, as shown in Figure 4. The concentration of ET1 was 4.03 6 .65 pg/mL in the ischemic group and
1.95 6 .39 pg/mL in the pretreadmill group at 24 hours
of reperfusion, and 5.26 6 .38 pg/mL in the ischemic
group and 1.10 6 .25 pg/mL in the pretreadmill group after MCAO surgery.

Discussion
Cerebral Blood Flow
Figure 3 shows the LSI results before, during, and after
MCAO. As compared, respectively, with the baseline CBF,
which is before ischemia, the relative average velocity of
capillary during reperfusion was determined at 24 hours.
The relative average velocity of capillary was increased in
the pretreadmill group than that in the ischemic group,
which were both lower than that in the sham group. There
were significant differences between the pretreadmill and

In our experiment, to explain the role of ET and CBF in
the neuroprotective process induced by preischemic
treadmill training after ischemic injury, we analyzed the
ET-1 expression and changes in CBF using a rat MCAO
model with preischemic treadmill training. In the pretreadmill group at 24 hours after reperfusion, CBF
increased significantly and the expression of ET-1 was
decreased than that in the ischemic group. But compared
with the time point of MCAO, the concentration of ET-1

was increased at 24 hours after reperfusion in the pretreadmill group. In addition, preischemic treadmill
training also improved neurologic function and reduced
lesion volume.
LSI is a novel technique that can provide information
on perfused blood volume and real-time monitoring of
CBF changes. The changes in CBF are very important during the cerebral ischemic injury process. The extent of the
CBF change is positively correlated with the severity of
brain injury. CBF was found to increase with exercise intensity in studies by Hollmann and DeMeirleir.26 Another
study showed that dynamic exercise caused an increase
in average global CBF.27 On the other hand, exercise has
been shown to improve function in animal models and
patients with cerebral ischemia, it seems that the reduced
brain inflammation and induced brain ischemic tolerance
after stroke may be attributable to the improvement of
CBF during reperfusion caused by exercise. In our study,
we found that CBF changed significantly after reperfusion in the pretreadmill group. Firstly, a substantial
reduction in CBF occurred in rats of both the ischemic
and pretreadmill groups. Interestingly, there was a substantial increase in CBF toward the baseline values in
the rats of the pretreadmill group at 24 hours after reperfusion, and most of blood flow had been recovered
compared with that of before MCAO. Meanwhile, there
was an improvement in neurologic function and lesion
volume. These results indicated that pretreadmill training
could stabilize CBF and weaken CBF changes to reduce
secondary damage induced by the changes in blood
flow during the reperfusion and protect the brain from
ischemic injury.
To find out how exercise alleviates CBF change, ET-1, a
solely vasoconstrictor, was also studied. ET system plays a
very important role in cardiovascular and neurovascular

diseases, including chronic heart failure, hypertension,
and atherosclerosis.28-30 Overexpression of ET-1 in endothelial cells results in more severe vascular permeability
and bloodâ€“brain barrier breakdown after brain ischemic
injury in rats following MCAO.31 Thus, the ET system is
an effective target for the treatment of brain diseases,
which are involved in neurovascular damage.20,32
Some studies have reported the effects of exercise on
ET-1 expression. PreproET-1 messenger RNA expression
in the kidneys was markedly higher in the exercise rats
than that in the sedentary control rats.33 Some studies

group). Data are expressed as the mean 6 standard deviation. n 5 8. Abbreviations: ET-1, endothelin 1; MCAO, middle cerebral artery occlusion.

EXERCISE INDUCED CBF AND ET-1 CHANGES AFTER ISCHEMIA

suggested that regular aerobic-endurance exercise reduces plasma ET-1 concentration in older humans and
healthy young humans, and this reduction in plasma
ET-1 concentration may have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system.34,35 Some other reports showed that
ET-1 expression increased after exercise.36 We considered
that because of the various ways and intensity of training,
ET-1 expression changed differently in each report. In this
study, our results showed that ET-1 expression of
ischemic rats has decreased with pretreadmill training.
According to the increase in CBF observed before, we
speculated that the downregulation of ET-1 resulted in
vascular pressure release and alleviate the change in
CBF. But ET-1 concentration was increased in the pretreadmill group from MCAO to 24 hours after reperfusion, which may be more beneficial to the injury repair
process. It means that we cannot conclude exercise upor downregulated ET-1 expression after ischemia simply,
we can only say that exercise is helpful to protect brain
from injury by regulating the ET-1 level. The results indicated that the increase in CBF was induced by exercise via
regulating ET-1 expression, which could prevent the secondary damage phenomena after the reperfusion event,
and improve neurologic status and histology injury. The
exact mechanism behind this is still unknown, and it is
a topic for future research as well.
In fact, we found that the protein levels of ET-1 in the
pretreadmill group were lower than that in the ischemic
group after MCAO injury. It is worth noting that our
result is different compared with the results of most of
the other studies, which indicated that ET-1 level was
significantly higher after reperfusion. However, Zhang
et al37 reported that the level of ET in the ischemic group
was lower than that in the sham group, and the contents
then further reduced after reperfusion and reached the
lowest level at 12 hours of reperfusion and at last became
normal 6 days later. We thought that it may be because of
the increase in the expression of vasoactive factors so that
the ET-1 level was decreased after reperfusion, and the
duration and area of ischemia also affected the results.
Interestingly, ET-1 was expressed at the lowest level in
the pretreadmill training group. On the basis of the results
of CBF, behavior, and histology, we thought that the regulation of ET-1 is a mechanism of self-protection, and it was
help for stabilizing CBF and weakening CBF changes to
reduce the secondary damage. In a word, the effect of exercise on ET-1 expression after reperfusion is a complex
and continuous process, which needs more improved
studies to clarify.
This study has several limitations that should be noted.
We just detected blood flow at 24 hours after reperfusion
instead of continuous monitoring. Therefore, the blood
flow changes at every time point were not captured,
and continuous monitoring of CBF must be done in the
future work. Cerebral blood analyzed here is overall
blood, including venous and arterial blood of ischemic

1701

hemisphere; more work needs to be done to clarify the
behavior of blood after ischemia in more detail.
In the present study, improvements in cerebral infarct
volume and neurologic behavior have shown the neuroprotection of 2-week preischemic training after ischemia
in rats, and exercise preconditioning is particularly beneficial to recovery after brain ischemia. In particular, the
ET-1 expression was significantly changed and CBF was
ameliorated at the same time, but the exact mechanism
behind this is still unknown, and further study is needed
to explore the exact effect and relationship between ET1and CBF on the preischemic treadmill training inducing
neuroprotection. Clarifying these mechanisms may be a
novel component of treating ischemia-induced brain
damage.
