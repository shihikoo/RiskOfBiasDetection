Abstract Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death. It
has previously been shown that blocking activation of
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) with the MEK
inhibitor U0126 mitigates brain damage in rodent models
of ischemic stroke. Here we show that the newer MEK
inhibitor PD184161 reduces cell death and altered gene
expression in cultured neurons and mice undergoing excitotoxicity, and has similar protective effects in a mouse
model of stroke. This further supports ERK inhibition as a
potential treatment for stroke.

Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of death, second only to cardiovascular
conditions (Donnan et al. 2008). The majority are ischemic
strokes, resulting from acute focal brain infarction due to
arterial blockage with sudden and persisting neurological deficits. This initial ischemic brain damage is followed by often
more substantial destruction of surrounding brain areas during
reperfusion after thrombolysis. Reducing reperfusion damage
is a major objective in developing new stroke therapies. One
pathomechanism contributing to brain damage in stroke is
excitotoxicity, which results from over-excitation of glutaminergic synapses, involving NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling (Simon et al. 1984). Excitotoxic NMDAR down-stream
signaling involves the activation of ERK and the subsequent
expression of immediate-early target genes such as Arc, Junb
and Fos. In addition, other pathways, such as oxidative stress,
lead to ERK activation during reperfusion (Namura et al. 2001).
Hence, ERK emerged as an attractive target to prevent/reduce
reperfusion damage. Accordingly, ERK inhibition with U0126,
an inhibitor of the ERK-activating upstream kinase MEK,
markedly reduced infarct sizes in several rodent stroke models
(Namura et al. 2001; Wang et al. 2003b, 2004; Henriksson et al.
2007; Maddahi and Edvinsson 2008, 2010).
Here, we compared the more selective MEK inhibitor
PD184161 to U1026 in experimental models of excitotoxicity and stroke, revealing similar preventive efficacies.

Methods
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
Male C57Bl/6 mice were used throughout the study at
indicated n numbers. All procedures were approved by the

123

544

Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Sydney.
Stroke was induced in adult mice by MCAO using a heatblunted 5–0 nylon monofilament as previously described
(Connolly et al. 1996). In brief, 3- to 6-month-old mice
were anesthetized and placed on heating pads. A ventral
midline neck incision was made and the common (CCA),
external (ECA) and internal carotid arteries (ICA) exposed
and skeletonized. The ECA was tied off to yield a stump.
The monofilament was inserted into the ECA and gently
advanced up the ICA resting 10 mm past the CCA bifurcation. MCAO was confirmed by transcranial laser Doppler
flowmetry (Moor instruments). The monofilament was then
withdrawn after 1.5 h under anesthesia. Mice were returned
to their individual cages, monitored for 24 h and neurologically scored. Neurological scoring: grade 4, no deficits;
3, decreased resistance to lateral push; 2, limb extension; 1,
limb elevation; 0, circling. After 24 h, brains were harvested, 1 mm fresh brain slices obtained with a brain
blocker (KOPF) and stained for 10 min at 37 °C with a
2 % TTC/PBS (Sigma) solution till viable tissue was bright
red. Infarct size and brain volume were determined on
serial slices of the whole brain using ImageJ (NIH).
PTZ administration
At 6 weeks of age, mice were injected intraperitoneally
with 50 mg/kg bodyweight of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) as
described before (Ittner et al. 2010).
MEK inhibitor treatment
Mice were treated with vehicle (DMSO), 500 lg/kg U0126
(Sigma) or 500 lg/kg PD184161 (Cayman Chemicals)
intravenously 30 min before MCAO or PTZ administration.
Primary neuronal cultures
Primary neurons obtained from 16-day-old-C57Bl/6
embryos were cultured as previously described (Fath et al.
2009). Forebrain neurons were cultured for 15 days before
being treated with 50 lM bicuculline with or without MEK
inhibitors U0126 (10 lM) or PD184161 (5 lM) 30 min
prior to stimulation. Survival was determined using a
commercial XTT assay (Roche, Switzerland).
Western blotting
Western blots were done as previously described (Ittner
et al. 2005). Primary antibodies were against ERK, phospho-ERK (Cell signaling) and Gapdh (all Millipore). Blots
were visualized by HRP-coupled secondary antibodies,
with Luminata Crescendo Western HRP substrate (Millipore), and detected and quantified in a VersaDoc Model

123

A. Gladbach et al.

4000 CCD camera (BioRad). Membranes were stripped for
re-probing as previously described (Ittner et al. 2005).
RNA purification and quantitative PCR
Total RNA from mouse forebrains and primary cultures
was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). An on-column DNA
digest was performed to prevent contamination with
genomic DNA. 2.5 lg of purified total RNA was used to
perform a second strand cDNA synthesis (Invitrogen).
Quantitative PCR reactions were run on an Mx3000 realtime PCR cycler (Stratagene) in a Fast SYBR green reaction mix (Invitrogen). Gene-specific primer pairs were for
Arc (GTGTGGAGGGAGGTCTTCT and CTGCCCA
CTGGGTATTTGC), Fos (TACTACCATTCCCCAGCCGAC and TTGGCACTAGAGACGGACAGA) and Junb
(GGCCACCAAGTGCCGGAA and CGTTCTCAGCC
TTGAGTGT).
Statistics
Statistical analysis was done with the Prism 4 software
(GraphPad Software, USA) using Student’s t test. Values
are given as mean ± standard error.

Results
ERK inhibition reduces excitotoxic neuronal death
and induction of immediate-early genes
Glutaminergic hyperexcitation of neurons results in ERK
activation (Hardingham et al. 2001). Therefore, we first
compared the effects of PD184161 and U0126 (Fig. 1a) on
excitotoxicity in primary cultured neurons obtained from
mouse embryo brains. Treatment of neurons with the
GABA receptor antagonist bicuculline that increased synaptic glutatmate levels results in a strong phosphorylation
of ERK (Fig. 1b). U0126 and PD184161 similarly reduced
bicuculline-induced ERK phosphorylation, even below
baseline levels (Fig. 1b, c). Both, PD184161 and U0126
increased survival of neurons treated with bicuculline,
though U0126 was slightly more effective in this assay
(Fig. 1d). Bicuculline treatment of neurons results in
increased mRNA levels of the immediate-early genes
(IEGs) Fos, Arc and Junb (Fig. 1e). PD184161 and U0126
similarly prevented IEG induction. To determine if this
effect is also seen in vivo, we treated mice systemically
(i.p.) with PTZ. This results in a comparable gene response
for Fos, Arc and Junb as in the cultured neurons (Fig. 1f).
In contrast, Fos, Arc and Junb mRNA levels are significantly lower when mice were pretreated with PD184161

toxic effects of BIC (**p \ 0.01; ***p \ 0.0001; n = 8). e Similarly,
both PD and UO prevent induction of immediate-early genes (IEGs)
Arc, Fos and Junb in BIC-treated primary neurons (**p \ 0.01;

expression induced by systemic administration of the GABA receptor
antagonist pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) is mitigated when mice were
pretreated with PD or UO (*p \ 0.05; n = 4)

and U0126 before PTZ administration. Thus, both
PD184161 and U0126 reduce bicuculline-induced neuronal
death and prevent bicuculline-/PTZ-induced IEG
activation.

all test groups (Fig. 2b). Neurological deficits progressively worsen within 24 h after reperfusion in vehicletreated mice. In contrast, no such progression of initial
neurological deficits was observed in mice pretreated with
PD184161 or U0126 (Fig. 2c). The neurological scoring
24 h after MCAO of mice treated with either PD184161 or
U0126 was comparable.
To determine if the lack of decline of neurological
deficits correlates with reduced brain damage, acute brain
slices were stained with TTC 24 h after reperfusion to
determine infarct sizes. 24 h after MCAO, vehicle-treated
controls present with substantial infarcts (Fig. 2d). However, upon pre-treatment with PD184161 or U0126 the
volume of the infarcted area was significantly and markedly reduced, as compared to vehicle-treated controls
(Fig. 2d, e). There was no difference in total brain volumes
between the test groups. Taken together, inhibiting ERK
activation prevents higher degree neurological deficits, and
reduced infarct size upon MCAO.

ERK inhibition protects from excitotoxic damage
similar to genetic tau-depletion
U0126 has previously shown protection from ischemiainduced brain damage in rodents (Namura et al. 2001;
Wang et al. 2003b, 2004; Henriksson et al. 2007; Maddahi
and Edvinsson 2008, 2010). Here we compared U0126
with the newer compound PD-184161 in a mouse model of
ischemic stroke, induced by MCAO. Transient loss of
blood flow and reperfusion during and after MCAO were
monitored by transcranial laser Doppler flowmetry
(Fig. 2a) to guarantee the similar hypoxia in all mice.
Accordingly, the drop in blood flow in the brain area
supplied by the middle cerebral artery was comparable in

Discussion

Other MEK inhibitors used to prevent brain damage after
stroke were SL327 (Wang et al. 2003a) and PD98059
(Alessandrini et al. 1999), though the latter was intracerebrally administered. Here, we show that PD184161 is an
alternative MEK inhibitor with similar efficacy compared
to U0126, using a similar treatment regime prior to
MCAO as previous studies (Wang et al. 2003a, b, 2004;
Alessandrini et al. 1999; Henriksson et al. 2007). However, PD184161 has been described as more selective for
MEK1, with less off target inhibition (Bain et al. 2007).
Furthermore, we show that both compounds, PD184161
and U0126, efficiently reduce cell death and excitotoxicity-induced IEG activation in culture and in vivo. This
may explain—at least in parts—the protection from progressive brain damage after MCAO with reperfusion,
though other ERK-activating processes are likely to be
involved as well.
Taken together, PD184161 is an alternative to U0126 for
systemic (i.v.) delivery of an ERK inhibitor during experimental stroke and excitotoxicity models.

In the present study, we show that the newer MEK inhibitor
PD184161 has a very similar efficacy as compared to
U0126 in preventing excitotoxicity in neurons and brain
damage in a mouse model of stroke.
ERK inhibition has been put forward as a potential
treatment for progressive brain damage following stroke,
showing efficacy in several rodent models. Accordingly,
U0126 reduced the infarct size following experimental
stroke in gerbils (Namura et al. 2001), rats (Henriksson
et al. 2007; Maddahi and Edvinsson 2008, 2010) and mice
(Wang et al. 2003b, 2004). In line with these studies, we
show a pronounced protective effect when mice were
pretreated with U0126 before MCAO with reperfusion.
While consistently reported that ERK inhibition reduced
the infarct size after stroke, there are differences in the
level of protection, which are likely to be a result of
different experimental protocols (e.g., time of inhibitor
administration or duration of MCAO) and/or species used.
