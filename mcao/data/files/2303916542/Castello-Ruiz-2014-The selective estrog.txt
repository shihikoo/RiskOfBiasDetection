a b s t r a c t
While the estrogen treatment of stroke is under debate, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)
arise as a promising alternative. We hypothesize that bazedoxifene (acetate, BZA), a third generation
SERM approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, reduces ischemic brain damage in a rat
model of transient focal cerebral ischemia. For comparative purposes, the neuroprotective effect of 17␤estradiol (E2) has also been assessed. Male Wistar rats underwent 60 min middle cerebral artery occlusion
(intraluminal thread technique), and grouped according to treatment: vehicle-, E2- and BZA-treated rats.
Optimal plasma concentrations of E2 (45.6 ± 7.8 pg/ml) and BZA (20.7 ± 2.1 ng/ml) were achieved 4 h
after onset of ischemia, and maintained until the end of the procedure (24 h). Neurofunctional score and
volume of the damaged brain regions were the main end points. At 24 h after ischemia–reperfusion,
neurofunctional examination of the animals did not show signiﬁcant differences among the three experimental groups. By contrast, both E2- and BZA-treated groups showed signiﬁcantly lower total infarct
volumes, BZA acting mainly in the cortical region and E2 acting mainly at the subcortical level. Our results
demonstrate that: (1) E2 at physiological plasma levels in female rats is neuroprotective in male rats when
given at the acute stage of the ischemic challenge and (2) BZA at clinically relevant plasma levels mimics
the neuroprotective action of E2 and could be, therefore, a candidate in stroke treatment.

While the neuroprotective role of 17␤-estradiol (E2) in a variety of CNS diseases including stroke has repeatedly been shown
in a variety of experimental setups [1,2], in the clinical setting E2
has been reported to increase or, at best, do not modify a woman’s
risk of stroke [3]. While the reasons for such translational failure
are under debate, the enormous advance in the understanding of
the estrogenic system in the brain has raised a variety of potential interventions for the prevention and/or treatment of stroke.
Of particular interest are some natural and synthetic compounds

aimed to mimic the beneﬁcial role of E2, while being devoid of
its detrimental effects. On the whole, these compounds are currently named “selective estrogen receptor modulators” (SERMs).
Ideally, a SERM should demonstrate agonistic (protective) effects
in bone (osteoporosis), brain (cognitive status) and cardiovascular
system (vasomotor symptoms, coronary heart disease), and neutral
or antagonistic (safe) effects in breast and uterine tissues (cancer)
[4].
Among natural SERMs, soy-derived isoﬂavones (e.g. genistein)
have received particular attention. We and others have demonstrated that soy-based high-isoﬂavone diets as well as genistein,
reduced cerebral infarct size in rat models of ischemic stroke [5–9].
On the other hand, synthetic SERMs are an ever-growing family
of compounds aimed at preventing/treating diseases derived from
estrogen deprivation (natural or hysterectomized postmenopausal
women), including impaired brain function [10]. Some “classical”
SERMs such as raloxifene and tamoxifen have shown a neuroprotective action in several paradigms of neural damage [11].
Bazedoxifene (acetate, BZA) is the ﬁrst third-generation SERM
approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in the
EU and Japan [12]. Since BZA has been reported to prevent neuronal loss in the hippocampus of rats exposed to kainic acid [13],
and to decrease the inﬂammatory response of astrocytes exposed to
lipopolysaccharide [14], we hypothesize that such neuroprotective
role of BZA can be extended to ischemic stroke as well. To test such a
hypothesis, the ability of BZA to minimize the impact of an ischemic
challenge has been assessed in parallel with that of E2, by using a rat
model of transient focal cerebral ischemia. Both treatments were
administered at the acute stage of the ischemic challenge, what may
have strong clinical implications if non-reproductive estrogen-like
compounds can be designed (e.g. SERMs), and used as the treatment
as opposed to the preventive method [15].
2. Materials and methods
Experimental procedures were conducted in compliance with
the Spanish legislation on “Protection of Animals used for Experimental and other Scientiﬁc Purposes” (RD 53/2013), and in
accordance with the EC Directive 86/609/EEC.

MCAO was maintained for 60 min, after which the ﬁlament was
carefully retracted to allow reperfusion which was monitored for
30 min.
2.3. Experimental groups: exclusion criteria and drug dosages
Thirty-one rats were excluded from the study according to the
following criteria: (1) CP did not drop during ﬁlament insertion
(no ischemia); (2) CP did not recover after ﬁlament withdrawal
(no reperfusion); (3) no brain infarction in spite of a right
ischemia–reperfusion pattern; and (4) death before the 24 h time
limit. Distribution of the animals excluded in each group for each
criterion is presented in Table 1. Therefore, three MCAO groups
were established: vehicle- (dimethyl sulfoxide, n = 12, controls),
E2- (n = 8), and BZA- (n = 11) treated rats. Treatments were applied
1 h before ischemia in such a way that optimal plasma concentrations were reached 4 h later, and were sustained until the
end of the procedure (24 h). The E2-treated rats received a single dose (s.c.) of 30 ␮g/kg E2, followed immediately afterwards
by implantation (i.p.) of an osmotic pump (Alzet model 2ML1
with a pumping rate of 10 ␮l/h, Durect Corp., Cupertino, CA,
USA) delivering 100 ␮g/kg/day E2. The BZA-treated rats received
a single dose (s.c.) of 1 mg/kg BZA, followed immediately afterwards by implantation (i.p.) of the same osmotic pump model
delivering 3 mg/kg/day BZA. Such dosages were established from
two additional groups of non-operated rats in which the plasma
concentration-versus-time curves for E2 (n = 3) and BZA (n = 4) were
obtained. Blood samples were obtained at 0, 30 min, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h.
Plasma concentrations of E2 (Sigma–Aldrich, Madrid, Spain) were
determined by the IMMULITE 1000 Estradiol procedure (Siemens
Healthcare España, Getafe, Madrid, Spain). Plasma concentrations
of BZA (Axon Medchem, Groningen, The Netherlands) were determined by the liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization-mass
spectrometry (LC–ESI-MS) technique (Waters, Barcelona, Spain).
Plasma concentrations of E2 and BZA at 4 h were 45.6 ± 7.8 pg/ml
and 20.7 ± 2.1 ng/ml, respectively (Fig. 1). Since both E2 and BZA
were dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (1 mg/ml stock), animals in all three experimental groups received the same amount of
dimethyl sulfoxide: 1 ml/kg as the initial bolus, plus 10 ␮l/h during
24 h (osmotic pump). This represents a total amount of 500–600 ␮l.

2.1. Animals
2.4. Assessment of ischemic brain damage
Sixty-nine male Wistar rats weighing 300–350 g (Charles River,
Barcelona, Spain) were housed under standard environmental conditions, and fed an isoﬂavone-free chow (TD96155 diet, Harlan
Teklad, Barcelona, Spain) with water ad libitum.
2.2. Surgical procedure
Transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) was
performed by following the intraluminal suture procedure as originally described [16], and adapted to our experimental setup [5].
This includes continuous monitoring under anesthesia of cerebrocortical laser-Doppler ﬂow (cortical perfusion, CP), arterial blood
pressure (ABP) and core temperature (T), and discontinuous measurement of blood pH, PaO2 , PaCO2 and glucose at the three stages
during surgery: pre-ischemia (basal), ischemia and reperfusion.

At 24 h after ischemia–reperfusion, neurofunctional condition
was examined just before euthanization based on four tests: (a)
spontaneous activity; (b) circling to the left; (c) parachute reﬂex;
and (d) resistance to left forepaw stretching. Total score could
range from 0 (no neurological deﬁcits) to 9 (highest neurological
deﬁcits) [5]. To measure cerebral infarct volume rats were euthanized by intracardiac 5 mEq KCl under anesthesia. The whole
brain was removed and infarct volume was determined by the
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) vital staining method
[17], followed by morphometric analysis. In order to correct the
inﬂuence of edema, infarcted volume was calculated as follows:
corrected infarct volume = infarct volume × [contralateral hemisphere volume/ipsilateral hemisphere volume]. The operational
sequence was applied separately to cortex and subcortical regions.

repeated measurements followed by multiple comparison Dunnett’s test. E2 and BZA plasma concentrations were expressed as
pg/ml and ng/ml, respectively, and represented as the mean ± SEM.
Neurological scores were expressed as the median with its ﬁrst (Q1)
and third (Q3) quartiles. Comparison among groups was carried out
by using non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s
test. Total, cortical and subcortical infarct volumes were obtained
as absolute values (mm3 ), expressed as a percentage of the corresponding contralateral (healthy) region, and represented as the
mean ± SEM. Intergroup statistical analysis was carried out by oneway ANOVA followed by Student–Newman–Keuls test. A p value of
less than 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant for all tests. Blinding was
used for treatment, assessment of ischemic brain damage and data
analysis.

Severity of ischemia was not signiﬁcantly different between the
three MCAO groups (Table 2). Mean CP values during MCAO were
signiﬁcantly lower than those at the basal stage (approximately
66%, 60%, and 59% reduction for vehicle-, E2-, and BZA-treated
groups, respectively). After 60 min of MCAO, the ﬁlament was withdrawn and CP increased to a sustained plateau signiﬁcantly higher
than that at the basal condition (78%, 90%, and 83% increase for
vehicle-, E2-, and BZA-treated groups, respectively). As to PaCO2
and pH, signiﬁcant hypercapnia and acidosis were shown in the
E2- and BZA-treated groups during the ischemia and reperfusion
stages. The mean values of the rest of parameters (ABP, PaO2 and
glucose) did not show, with very few exceptions, signiﬁcant differences among the three stages within the three groups (Table 2).

signiﬁcantly lower total infarct volumes when compared with the
vehicle-treated group. Such reductions amounted by 32% and 33%,
respectively. The regional analysis showed a tendency of E2 to
reduce subcortical rather than cortical lesion, while the opposite
was shown for BZA (Fig. 2).

4. Discussion
Our results show for the ﬁrst time the ability of BZA, a thirdgeneration SERM intended to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis,
to minimize the consequences of an acute episode of focal cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion to a similar extent as E2. This lends support to
the possibility of extending the indications of BZA (and eventually
other SERMs) from the ﬁeld of women’s health to neuroprotection
in stroke. That way, SERMs emerge as potential drugs in the treatment of ischemic stroke by targeting the estrogenic system, but
overcoming the negative aspects associated with the use of E2.
In the current study, the alleged neuroprotective effect of BZA
was investigated in parallel with that of E2. Since the endogenous
estrogen has been repeatedly shown to protect against experimental ischemic stroke [1,2], it was used as a positive control. Such
an assumption is not devoid, however, of some risk as a consensus regarding the neuroprotective effect of E2 is far from being
reached [18,19]. The ﬁrst goal in the current study was to achieve
optimal plasma concentrations for both E2 and BZA within 4 h
from the onset of ischemia, which were sustained until the end
of the procedure (24 h). This is an important methodological issue
since differences in hormone administration paradigms resulting
in highly different serum hormone concentrations, may account
for the reason why some animal studies indicate that estrogens
increase ischemic damage while others show estrogen-induced
neuroprotection [19,20]. As to E2, a sustained plasma concentration
of ∼46 pg/ml was reached at 4 h after administration. Such values closely ﬁt to those recently reported by other authors [19–21],
and are equivalent to the basal circulating levels of E2 found during the estrous cycle. Other studies have used dosages resulting
in supraphysiological E2 plasma concentrations [22–25]. As to
BZA, it is currently marketed for the treatment of postmenopausal

osteoporosis in women at the recommended dose of 20 mg/day,
i.e. approximately 0.3 mg/kg/day for a 60 kg body weight. Such a
dose has been reported to reach a peak plasma concentration of
3.43 ng/ml at 1.2 h [26]. Results from the same group [27] show
a peak plasma concentration of ∼25 ng/ml immediately after a
0.2 mg/kg single i.v. injection in rats, which closely ﬁts the values
obtained in the present study (∼21 ng/ml). Furthermore, the BZA
dosage we have established is within the range of 0.3–3 mg/kg/day
which has been shown to protect from bone loss with only mild
stimulatory effects on the uterine endometrium and no effect on
vasomotor function [12].
While a statistical improvement of the neurofunctional status
was not shown, may be as a consequence of the rather short postischemia period (24 h), both BZA and E2 reduced the total infarct
volume to a very similar extent. Two important circumstances must
be noted: (1) it happened in male rats and (2) both treatments were
administered just at the ischemic challenge. As to the former point,
sex is recognized to be an important determinant of stroke outcome. Indeed, some studies have reported that E2 decreases infarct
size in female but not in male rats [28,29]. Our results are not in
line with these previous studies, but conﬁrm the neuroprotective
effect of E2 in males [23,24]. As to the second point, our results
show that both E2 and BZA signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume
when administered just at the ischemic challenge (acute treatment)
instead of a chronic (preventive) exposure. Other authors have previously reported the neuroprotective effect of acutely administered
E2 [22–25]. Taken together, these results may have strong clinical
implications if SERMs are designed and used as the treatment as
opposed to the preventive method [15].
An interesting ﬁnding is that the target tissue for E2 and BZA
appeared to be different: while E2 showed a tendency to reduce
subcortical but not cortical lesion, the opposite was shown for BZA.
As to E2, our results are in line with some others previously reported
[23]. Both estrogen receptors (ER) and vascular mechanisms could
account for such differences. As reviewed recently [2], the effects
of E2 are mediated by its binding to three types of ER: ER␣, ER␤ and
GPR30. Although each of these receptors has been implicated in the
neuroprotective actions of E2 in cerebral ischemia, the role of ER␣
appears more prominent (receptor speciﬁcity). Moreover, all cell
types in the brain but not all cells of each type, possess ER (cellular speciﬁcity). This, along with the fact that cells derived from the
various regions of the rat brain respond to E2 with different afﬁnities (regional speciﬁcity) [30], could account, among other factors,
for the different neuroprotective regional patterns seen with E2
and BZA. On the other hand, vascular mechanisms could also be
involved since E2 has been shown to preserve subcortical, but not
cortical, ischemic blood ﬂow [24].
The mechanism by which BZA protects partially the brain from
an ischemic challenge warrants further research. BZA has been
shown to bind both ER␣ and ER␤ with high afﬁnity, although it has a
4-fold higher afﬁnity for ER␣ [31]. The main potential mechanisms
of neuroprotection by E2 beyond its interaction with ER, have been
listed [32]: (1) increase of Bcl-2 expression; (2) enhanced activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway; (3) reduced inﬂammatory
response; (4) improvement of cerebral blood ﬂow by increase of
NO as well as of the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor;
(5) reduction of oxidative stress; (6) increased neurogenesis; and
(7) increased angiogenesis. Previous studies from our group have
demonstrated the ability of E2 as well as that of natural SERMs,
speciﬁcally soy-derived isoﬂavones, to relax isolated cerebral arteries by their ability to block Ca2+ entry into the vascular smooth
muscle cells [33,34], as well as to improve regional (cortical) blood
ﬂow when infused directly (intracarotid) into the cerebral circulation [35]. This could contribute to the improvement of collateral
blood ﬂow in the penumbra and, therefore, to a reduction of
brain damage. Moreover, a recent study of our group has shown

M. Castelló-Ruiz et al. / Neuroscience Letters 575 (2014) 53–57

that the phytoestrogen genistein protects the brain against an
ischemia–reperfusion challenge, at least in part, by its beneﬁcial
effects on the circulatory function [7].
