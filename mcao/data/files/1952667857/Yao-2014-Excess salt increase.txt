Abstract
Cerebral circulation is known to be vulnerable to high salt loading. However, no study has investigated the effects of excess
salt on focal ischemic brain injury. After 14 days of salt loading (0.9% saline) or water, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR)
and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were subjected to photothrombotic middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO),
and infarct volume was determined at 48 h after MCAO: albumin and hemoglobin contents in discrete brain regions were
also determined in SHR. Salt loading did not affect blood pressure levels in SHR and WKY. After MCAO, regional cerebral
blood flow (CBF), determined with two ways of laser-Doppler flowmetry (one-point measurement or manual scanning), was
more steeply decreased in the salt-loaded group than in the control group. In SHR/Izm, infarct volume in the salt-loaded
group was 112627 mm3, which was significantly larger than 77612 mm3 in the control group (p = 0.002), while the extents
of blood-brain barrier disruption (brain albumin and hemoglobin levels) were not affected by excess salt. In WKY, salt
loading did not significantly increase infarct size. These results show the detrimental effects of salt loading on intra-ischemic
CBF and subsequent brain infarction produced by phototrhombotic MCAO in hypertensive rats.

vitro studies showed impaired vascular relaxation mechanisms in
isolated rat cerebral arteries. Middle cerebral artery (MCA) from
rats fed a short-term high salt diet exhibited impaired dilation in
response to acetylcholine or hypoxia [7,8]. Excess salt induced
oxidative stress, and accelerated spontaneous stroke and bloodbrain barrier (BBB) disruption in stroke-prone spontaneously
hypertensive rats (SHR) [9]. These experimental studies suggest
that pre-existing excess salt impairs cerebral blood flow (CBF)
regulation and BBB integrity, and it may finally aggravate stroke
outcome. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has
investigated the relationship between excess salt and the size of
subsequent brain infarction produced by middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO).
In the present study, we investigated the effects of excess salt on
the volume of brain infarction produced by distal MCAO in the
rat, and explored the hypothesis that excess salt leads to impaired
CBF regulation and/or greater BBB damage in critically ischemic
brain tissue.

Introduction
Excess salt intake was associated with significantly greater risk of
stroke and a non-significant trend for cardiovascular disease [1].
On the basis of the results of a meta-analysis of randomized trials,
the effect of reducing dietary salt (2.0–2.3 g reduction per day) on
cardiovascular events was estimated to be a significant reduction of
20% [2]. Recently, the Northern Manhattan Study demonstrated
that only 12% of subjects met the AHA-recommended level of
sodium consumption of less than1500 mg/day, and high sodium
intake was associated with an increased risk of stroke independent
of vascular risk factors [3]. In the light of physiological aspects,
sodium requirement would not exceed 0.6 mmol/kg per day in
mature mammals, and the daily human maintenance requirement
is probably below 40 mmol (approximately 2.3 g of NaCl) per day
[4]. Actually, the daily intake of sodium from Paleolithic huntergatherer diet, estimated to be 690 mg (approximately 1.7 g of
NaCl), would have been markedly below the lowest estimate of
current intake (5.8–17.3 g of NaCl) [5]. In modern industrialized
society, we are consuming much more salt than biological
requirements.
Cerebral circulation is vulnerable to excess salt as shown in
clinical studies [1,2]. Experimental studies have also reported
detrimental effects of excess salt on cerebral arteries. A high salt
diet (4% NaCl for 3 days) severely impaired both endotheliumand receptor-mediated vasodilator functions of pial arterioles of
rats in the absence of detectable blood pressure changes [6]. In

regional CBF was measured at points 2 mm posterior and 2.0 to 3.0 mm lateral to the bregma by scanning the probe at 0.1 mm intervals (A). In case
that it is difficult to place the ‘‘scanning’’ probe avoiding superficial veins and arterioles, the CBF value was substituted by the average of arbitrary
units determined on neighboring two appropriate points. The lower portion of the exposed distal MCA was irradiated for 2 min with an infusion of
photosensitizing dye rose bengal, and then the laser beam was moved to an additional site just proximal to the first irradiated site for 2 min (twopoint hit) (A). CBF was determined at 2 mm posterior and 4 mm lateral to the bregma (B). After distal MCA occlusion, CBF was more markedly
decreased in the salt-loaded group compared with the control group (n = 5–6). By means of scanning of the laser-Doppler probe, CBF was
determined at 2 mm posterior and 2.0 mm to 3.0 mm lateral to the bregma (n = 3–4) (C). Values are expressed as mean6S.D. *p,0.05 vs. salt (2).

(OPMI 111, Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany), revealing the
distal segment of the MCA.
By means of photothrombosis [12], distal MCA was occluded as
previously described [10,11]. Briefly, a krypton laser operating at
568 nm (643R-Y-A01, Melles Griot Inc.) was used to irradiate the
distal MCA at a power of 20 mW (an average intensity of 15.9 W/
cm2) for 4 min (Figure 1A). The laser beam was focused with a
30-cm-f.l. convex lens (KPX 112, Newport Corporation, Irvine,
CA, USA) and positioned onto the distal MCA after reflection
from a mirror. The photosensitizing dye rose bengal (15 mg/mL
in 0.9% saline; Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd, Osaka, Japan)
was administered intravenously to a body dose of 20 mg/kg over
90 sec starting simultaneously with 4 min of laser irradiation.

the age of 8 weeks, and used at the age of 3 months. Rats were fed
regular rat chow (CLEA rodent diet CE-2, containing 25%
protein, Na+ 3.1 mg/g pellet, and K+ 10.2 mg/g pellet) and tap
water ad libitum. Rats were randomly assigned to either the salt
loading group (0.9% saline as drinking water) or the control group
(tap water). The amount of drinking was determined at Day 1,
Day 7, and Day 14. After 14 days of salt loading or water, rats
were subjected to photothrombotic distal MCAO.

Photothrombotic distal MCAO
Rats, which had been food-deprived overnight, were anesthetized with halothane (4% for induction, 1.5% during the surgical
preparation with a face mask, 0.75% after intubation, and 0.5%
for maintenance) in a mixture of 70% nitrous oxide and 30%
oxygen. The right femoral artery and vein were cannulated with
PE 50 tubing. The rats were endotracheally intubated with PE 240
tubing, pancuronium bromide (an initial dose of 0.3 mg followed
by 0.1 mg every 30 min) was intravenously injected, and the rats
were mechanically ventilated. Rats were mounted on a stereotaxic
head holder in the prone position, and a burr hole 3 mm in
diameter was made 1 mm rostral to the anterior junction of the
zygoma and squamosal bone under an operating microscope

CBF by laser-Doppler flowmetry
Regional CBF was assessed by means of laser-Doppler
flowmetry (ALF21D, Advance Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) before
and immediately after MCAO. The laser-Doppler probe was
positioned at 2 mm posterior and 4 mm lateral to the bregma
above the intact dura as previously described [11]. Laser-Doppler
flowmetry is a method to estimate the blood perfusion in the
microcirculation. Therefore, special attention was paid to avoid

before and 30 min after distal MCAO (Figure 1A).

Infarct volume
Forty-eight h after distal MCAO, rats were decapitated under
deep anesthesia, and brains were rapidly removed. The brain was
cooled in ice-cold saline for 3 min and was cut into 2 mm-thick
coronal sections in a cutting block. Then the slices were stained
with 1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan) at 37uC for 30 min in the dark.
The infarct area was measured in each slice with NIH Image
software (ImageJ 1.46r). The infarct volume was calculated by
numerical integration according to the trapezoidal rule: V = d[1/
2(Y1+Yn)+Y2+…+Yi+…+Yn21], where V indicates volume; d,
distance between the sections; and Yi, cross-sectional area of ith
section, and where the ends (Y1 and Yn) are equal to zero.

Brain albumin and hemoglobin assays
Extravasation of Evans Blue has been used for assessing
disruption of BBB after MCAO in animal models owing to its
useful property of binding to serum albumin [14]. Albumin and
hemoglobin contents determined with surface enhanced laser
desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (SELDITOF-MS) in ischemic brain tissue were increased at 48 h after
MCAO in our SHR stroke model (unpublished observation).
Therefore, in this study, we attempted to directly measure brain
albumin and hemoglobin contents as indices of BBB disruption
using SELDI-TOF-MS [15,16]. At 48 h after MCAO, the brain
was sampled after transcardial perfusion with 50 mL of saline
under deep anesthesia. In the present study, we defined ischemic
penumbra as the region that is at risk of being recruited into
infarction according to the classic concept of ischemic penumbra
(i.e., the condition of an ischemic brain with CBF between the
upper threshold of electrical silence and the lower threshold of
energy and ion pump failure at early stages of focal ischemia) [10].
The sampling procedure of discrete brain regions (A and B:
ischemic core, C: penumbra, and D: contralateral side), and the
methods of SELDI-TOF-MS were previously described [17].

confounding effects of superfluous light, heterogeneous distribution of superficial blood vessels, and movement artifacts on laserDoppler flowmetry [13]. For mechanical ventilation, we used a
respirator with little vibration (Rodent ventilator, Model 7025,
Ugo Basile, Comerio VA, Italy), which does not affect the laserDoppler flowmetry by movement artifacts even placed on the
experimental table.
In a subgroup of rats, regional CBF was assessed by laserDoppler flowmetry at points 2 mm posterior and 2.0 to 3.0 mm
lateral to the bregma by scanning the laser-Doppler probe at
0.1 mm intervals with a stereotaxic device (Type SR-5N and SM-

The brain sample was sonicated in 100 mL of ice-cold Buffer 1
(50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X100, pH 7.4).
After centrifugation (14,000X g, 4uC, 20 min), supernatant was
used for albumin and hemoglobin assays by using weak cationexchange (CM10) ProteinChip Arrays (BIO-RAD Laboratories
Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Prior to sample loading, CM10 arrays
were equilibrated with 5 mL of binding/washing buffer (50 mM
Gly-HCl, pH 3). Protein content was determined by the Bradford
method, and 2 mL of sample (5.0 mg protein equivalent) was
applied to the array. The array was washed 3 times with 5 mL of
binding/washing buffer, followed by a brief water wash. After airdried, a 0.5 mL aliquot of saturated sinapinic acid solution (an
energy absorbing molecule) dissolved in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid was added twice and allowed to dry.
The ProteinChip Array was then transferred into the ProteinChip
Biomarker System (BIO-RAD Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA,
USA), which generates nanosecond laser pulses from a UVemitting pulsed nitrogen laser. With the time-of-flight mass
spectrometry, the mass-to-charge (m/z) or molecular weight
(M.W.) of the peptide or protein was determined. The m/z of
each of the protein was determined relative to external calibration
standards: bovine insulin (5,733.6 Da), bovine cytochrome C

assessed at least three times, and arterial blood was withdrawn
from the femoral arterial catheter to decrease systemic blood
pressure in a stepwise manner by 10 mmHg/step. Indices for
lower limits of CBF autoregulation (CBF decreased by 10% or
20% from the baseline, and MABP ranges from baseline to lower
limits) were compared between the salt-loaded group and the
control group as previously described [18].

Normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats
After 14 days of salt loading or water, 11 WKY/Izm were
subjected to photothrombotic distal MCAO. Forty-eight h after
distal MCAO, rats were decapitated under deep anesthesia, and
infarct volume was determined.

Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean6S.D. Intergroup comparisons
were made with the unpaired two-tailed t-test. Intraischemic CBF
values were compared with analysis of variance followed by
Bonferroni post hoc test. The amounts of drinking over time in the
salt-loaded and the control groups were analyzed by two-way
analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc test to correct for
multiple comparisons. A significance level of 0.05 was used in all
analyses. The data were analyzed with IBM SPSS 18.0 for
Windows.

Discussion
This is the first study to demonstrate that intake of salt per se,
distinct from high blood pressure, exerts detrimental effects on
intra-ischemic CBF and subsequent brain infarction produced by
photothrombotic distal MCAO. The extents of BBB disruption
and hemorrhagic transformation, detected as increased albumin
and hemoglobin contents in the ischemic brain tissue, were not
different between the salt-loaded and the control groups. Because
CBF response to hypotension without MCAO was not different
between the salt-loaded and control groups, the extent of CBF
reduction was considered to be the same provided that the
reductions in local perfusion pressure in the ischemic zone were
the same with or without excess salt. In this context, more
markedly decreased CBF after MCAO in the salt-loaded group
than in the control group may indicate that the local perfusion
pressure after MCAO was compromised by salt loading, probably
due to excess salt-induced dysfunction of collateral arteries (i.e.,
arteriole-to-arteriole anastomosis or leptomeningeal anastomosis)
[19].
Laser-Doppler flowmetry is an easy method to monitor a
relative measure of blood perfusion, and is commonly used in
small animals. We determined CBF with laser-Doppler flowmetry
‘‘scanning’’ method in addition to one point measurement: a laserDoppler flowmetry probe was laterally scanned, and CBF of the
distal MCA territory was measured at points 2 mm posterior and
2.0 to 3.0 mm lateral to the bregma by scanning the laser-Doppler
probe at 0.1 mm intervals, and 11 CBF values in one rat were
transformed to an area under curve according to the trapezoidal
rule. This ‘‘scanning’’ method worked well in 7 of 9 rats (78%), but
drawbacks in this manual technique was that the method was
time-consuming and required much effort. Nevertheless, we could
show excess salt-induced more profound CBF reduction by use of

The earliest phase of ischemic injury characterized by cytotoxic
edema (swelling due to osmotically active molecules such as
sodium from the extracellular to intracellular space) - closely
coupled with ionic edema (transport of molecules such as sodium
across the BBB to replace the molecules depleted by cytotoxic
edema) - is followed by the second phase of the breakdown of the
BBB with leakage of plasma proteins such as albumin into brain
extracellular space (i.e., vasogenic edema) [21]. Salt loading
increased superoxide production in the brain of SHRSP, and
angiotensin II infusion in salt-loaded SHRSP significantly
impaired BBB, which was prevented by an angiotensin II type 1
receptor blocker candesartan but not by a calcium channel blocker
amlodipine, and this effect was independent of blood pressure level
[9]. In contrast to spontaneous stroke, a decrease in apparent
diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water (i.e., cytotoxic edema) was
detected after 2 h of MCAO, but the effects of excess salt on ADC
after MCAO were not examined in the study by Guerrini et al.
[22]. Subsequent to cytotoxic and ionic edema characterized by
increased sodium contents in ischemic tissue [21,23], vasogenic
edema occurs as also shown in the present study. In the present
study, however, excess salt did not affect the extent of brain

two ways of laser-Doppler flowmetry in collaterally perfused
ischemic regions.
In cerebral arteries, acetylcholine induces vasodilatation
through a nitric oxide (NO)-mediated process, although there is
also evidence suggesting a role for endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor in vasodilatation of cerebral arteries. A short-term
elevation of dietary salt intake impaired the dilator function of in
situ cerebral microcirculation without blood pressure changes [9].
In vitro studies showed that the impaired dilatation in response to
acetylcholine in cerebral arteries of rats on a high-salt diet was due
to attenuated NO release, while vascular response to bradykinin
and to NO donor, and levels of reactive oxygen species were
unaltered by elevated dietary salt intake [7,8]. Although even a
short-term high salt diet decreased the ability of blood vessels to
relax, low dose angiotensin II infusion restored normal vascular
function following short-term (3 days) intake of high salt diet (4.0%
NaCl). Hence, salt-induced angiotensin II suppression caused a
profound impairment of vascular relaxation [20]. Taken together,
increased infarct volume observed in the present study could occur
with excess salt if this high salt leads to impaired vascular
relaxation of collateral arterioles or leptomeningeal anastomoses
after distal MCAO.

Excess Salt Exacerbates Focal Ischemic Injury

albumin levels in ischemic brain regions in the salt-loaded group
compared with the control group.
In acute cerebral ischemia, up-regulated matrix metalloproteinases, especially gelatinases (matrix metalloproteinases-2 and 9),
are closely associated with BBB disruption, edema formation, and
hemorrhagic transformation [24,25]. Yamashita et al. demonstrated that tPA administered just before the reperfusion of 4.5 h
suture MCAO, induced dissociation of neurovascular unit (i.e., the
detachment of astrocyte endfeet from the basement membrane),
which was prevented by a free radical scavenger, edaravone [26].
Henning et al. demonstrated an unexpectedly high incidence of
parenchymal hematomas at later time points (between days 1 and
4 after 30 min of suture occlusion), using gradient-echo magnetic
resonance imaging [27]. In the present study, however, excess salt
did not increase the hemoglobin contents in ischemic brain tissue.
Although blood pressure levels were not affected by salt loading
in both SHR/Izm and WKY/Izm, excess salt represented the
detrimental effects on brain infarct size produced by distal MCAO
in SHR/Izm. In the present study, we found that SHR/Izm did in
fact exhibit an exaggerated preference for 0.9% NaCl compared
with water. SHR have consistently higher preferences for NaCl
than do age-matched normotensive rats [28,29]. Nevertheless,
MABP did not change after salt loading even in SHR/Izm as
previously shown by radio telemetry [30]. Although WKY/Izm
also showed some preference for 0.9% NaCl, salt loading caused a
non-significant increase in infarct volume in normotensive WKY/

Izm. Thus, excess salt aggravates brain infarction in association
with hypertension.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that excess salt increased infarct
size produced by photothrombotic MCAO without increasing
blood pressure in SHR but not in normotensive WKY. Excess salt
did not deteriorate both vasogenic edema and hemorrhagic
transformation of ischemic brain tissue after MCAO. The
detrimental effects of excess salt were considered to be the result
of compromised CBF in the ischemic brain tissue supplied by
collateral circulation. A future study will investigate the mechanisms underlying the salt sensitivity to focal brain ischemia
independent of blood pressure changes. Dietary salt reduction
before the onset of stroke could reduce the size of brain infarction
independent of blood pressure changes in subjects with major
cerebral artery occlusion.
