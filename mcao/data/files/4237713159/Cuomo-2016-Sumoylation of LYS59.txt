Background and Purpose—The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO), a ubiquitin-like protein involved in posttranslational
protein modifications, is activated by several conditions, such as heat stress, hypoxia, and hibernation and confers
neuroprotection. Sumoylation enzymes and substrates are expressed also at the plasma membrane level. Among the
numerous plasma membrane proteins controlling ionic homeostasis during cerebral ischemia, 1 of the 3 brain sodium/
calcium exchangers (NCX3), exerts a protective role during ischemic preconditioning. In this study, we evaluated
whether NCX3 is a target for sumoylation and whether this posttranslational modification participates in ischemic
preconditioning-induced neuroprotection. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed (1) SUMO1 conjugation pattern after
ischemic preconditioning; (2) the effect of SUMO1 knockdown on the ischemic damage after transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion and ischemic preconditioning, (3) the possible interaction between SUMO1 and NCX3 and (4) the
molecular determinants of NCX3 sequence responsible for sumoylation.
Methods—Focal brain ischemia and ischemic preconditioning were induced in rats by middle cerebral artery occlusion.
SUMOylation was evaluated by western blot and immunohistochemistry. SUMO1 and NCX3 interaction was analyzed
by site-directed mutagenesis and immunoprecipitation assay.
Results—We found that (1) SUMO1 knockdown worsened ischemic damage and reduced the protective effect of
preconditioning; (2) SUMO1 bound to NCX3 at lysine residue 590, and its silencing increased NCX3 degradation;
and (3) NCX3 sumoylation participates in SUMO1 protective role during ischemic preconditioning. Thus, our results
demonstrate that NCX3 sumoylation confers additional neuroprotection in ischemic preconditioning.
Conclusions—Finally, this study suggests that NCX3 sumoylation might be a new target to enhance ischemic preconditioninginduced neuroprotection.   (Stroke. 2016;47:1085-1093. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.012514.)

S

mall ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugation is
an enzymatic process that is biochemically analogous
to, but functionally distinct from, the ubiquitination process.1–6 To date, 4 SUMO proteins have been identified,
SUMO1 to SUMO4. SUMO1 to SUMO3 are present in the
brain, whereas SUMO4 is mainly localized in the kidney.7
Interestingly, sumoylation is activated after different stress
conditions, including anoxia, hypothermia, and hypoxia.8–11
Changes in brain sumoylation pattern have also been
reported after focal cerebral ischemia,11 where it may represents a protective response. To date, no information is available regarding a potential neuroprotective role of protein
sumoylation during endogenous neuroprotective events like
ischemic preconditioning in vivo. Ischemic preconditioning,

a phenomenon whereby a subliminal injurious stimulus
applied before a longer harmful ischemia produces neuroprotection,12–14 shares several trasductional pathways with
hibernation, a condition in which sumoylation is activated.
Several proteins involved in the neuroprotection mediated by ischemic preconditioning have been proposed as
sumoylation substrates.15 Recently, convincing evidence has
revealed that sumoylation enzymes and substrates are also
present at the plasma membrane level, wherein they regulate
plasma membrane protein expression. This finding led us to
hypothesize that sumoylation might influence ionic homeostasis by regulating the stability and the expression of those
transmembrane proteins involved in brain ischemia, specifically sodium/calcium exchanger NCX3.

The reason for investigating NCX3 as a possible target
for SUMO-mediated neuroprotective effect is that NCX3
plays a relevant neuroprotective role in cerebral ischemia.16,17 Indeed, both NCX3 knockdown and NCX3 knockout exacerbate ischemic damage induced by permanent and
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO).16,17
More intriguingly, NCX3 is a new additional effector of
ischemic preconditioning.18 Given these premises, the aim
of this study was to evaluate whether NCX3 is a target for
sumoylation and whether this posttranslational modification
participates in promoting ischemic preconditioning-induced
neuroprotection. For these aims, we analyzed (1) SUMO1
conjugation pattern after ischemic preconditioning, (2) the
effect of SUMO1 knockdown on ischemic damage after
tMCAO and ischemic preconditioning, (3) the possible
interaction between SUMO1 and NCX3, and finally, (4) the
molecular determinants of NCX3 sequence responsible for
sumoylation.

Methods
Experimental Groups
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (n=110; 250–300 g; Charles River)
were housed under diurnal lighting conditions (12 hours darkness/light). Experiments were performed according to the international guidelines for animal research and approved by the
Animal Care Committee of “Federico II” University of Naples
(Naples, Italy).

Focal Ischemia
Transient focal ischemia was induced, as previously described,19,20
by suture occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery in male
rats anesthetized with 1.5% sevoflurane, 70% N2O, and 28.5%
O2. Achievement of ischemia was confirmed by monitoring
regional cerebral blood flow in the area of the right middle cerebral artery through a laser Doppler (PF5001; Perimed, Sweden).19
Animals not showing a cerebral blood flow reduction of at least
70% (n=8), as well as those dying after ischemia induction (n=5),
were excluded from the study. Rectal temperature was maintained
at 37±0.5°C with a thermostatically controlled heating pad and
lamp. After 100 minutes middle cerebral artery occlusion, rats
were reanesthetized and the filament was withdrawn to restore
blood flow. Animals were randomized into the different experimental groups, containing each one 5 to 8 animals, in a blind
manner. Sham-operated animals subjected to the entire surgical
procedure for tMCAO induction except for the insertion of the
filament.

Ischemic Preconditioning
Ischemic preconditioning was induced a by subjecting rats to 30 minutes of MCAO, followed by 72 hours of reperfusion.18 At the end
of the reperfusion period, the middle cerebral artery was reoccluded
for 100 minutes. Cerebral blood flow reduction was 80.4±1.4 in
tMCAO group, 81.2±1.6 in preconditioning group, and 82.5±2.5 in
preconditioning+tMCAO group.

Evaluation of the Infarct Volume
For the analysis of ischemic damage, rats were euthanized 24 or 72
hours after tMCAO or preconditioning+tMCAO. The ischemic volume was evaluated with 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining
and calculated with image analysis software (Image-ProPlus).21 The
total infarct volume was expressed as percentage of the volume of the
hemisphere ipsilateral to the lesion to correct brain edema and evaluated in a blind manner.

Intracerebroventricular Administration of siRNA
In rats positioned on a stereotaxic frame, a 23-g stainless steel guide
cannula was implanted into the right lateral ventricle using the stereotaxic coordinates from the bregma: 0.4 mm caudal, 2 mm lateral, and
2 mm below the dura.16,22
Two different siRNAs were tested (Quiagen siRNA-A
#SI01910034 and siRNA-B #SI01910027). siRNAs (10 μL, 2 μM
or 10 μM) and siCTL were intracerebroventricularly administered
twice a day for 3 days. Because their effectiveness was similar
(≈50% reduction), all the experiments were performed with siRNAA (10 μL, 10 μM). In preconditioning+tMCAO group, siRNA was
administered twice a day every 12 hours for 3 days, starting 72
hours before preconditioning stimulus induction. By contrast, in the
MCAO groups, siRNA was administered twice a day, at intervals of
12 hours, starting 72 hours before tMCAO induction until the day
before the euthanization.

Western Blotting Analysis
Cortical samples were harvested from ischemic brains of rats subjected to tMCAO, preconditioning, and preconditioning+tMCAO.
Ipsilateral cortex and striatum were obtained at 4 different reperfusion time intervals after the last occlusion, ie, at 3, 5, 24, and
72 hours. To limit the number of control groups, the same samples were obtained from brains of control untouched animals. To
justify the use of untouched animals as controls, we performed
immunohistochemical analysis, which revealed no differences
in SUMO1 and NCX3 signals between the temporoparietal cortex of untouched animals and the contralateral temporoparietal cortex of animals subjected to tMCAO, preconditioning,
and preconditioning+tMCAO (Figure I in the online-only Data
Supplement).
Blots were probed with SUMO1 antibody (rabbit polyclonal,
dilution 1:1000; kindly given by Hallenbeck J.M. from National
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and NIH, Bethesda,
MD), or with NCX3 antibody (rabbit polyclonal, dilution 1:1000;
kindly given by Philipson K. from David Geffen School of Medicine
at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA) overnight at 4°C. Finally, detection
was achieved using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000; Cell Signaling) and an enhanced luminescence kit (GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy).23 As already reported,
the blots showed the typical band of SUMOylated RanGAP1 at
≈100 kDa and a ladder of protein bands of SUMO1 conjugates.24
For the analysis of the sumoylation pattern, the region corresponding to molecular weights 40 to 260 kDa in each lane was cropped,
the total intensity was analyzed,11,25 and the densitometry values
were expressed as percentage of the control animals. The same blots
were then reprobed with β-actin antibody (mouse monoclonal, dilution 1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) as an internal control.26

Generation and Stable Expression of WildType and Mutant NCX3FLAG cDNAs
Murine NCX3 cDNA with a 3XFLAG epitope at the C-terminus
(NCX3FLAG) was cloned in pReceiver-M13 expressing vector by
Genecopoeia. Site-directed and deletion mutants of NCX3FLAG were
generated by means of QuikChange strategy (Stratagene, La Jolla,
CA). In particular, the amino acid regions 292 to 710 and 528 to 676
were deleted from NCX3FLAG obtaining a mutant lacking the entire
f-loop, NCX3∆292 to 710 (NCX3∆f), and another lacking a portion of f-loop, NCX3∆528 to 676, respectively. Two site-directed
mutants were obtained by substituting lysine456 with glutamate
(NCX3K456E), and phenylalanine 589 and lysine 590 with leucine
and glutamate, respectively (NCX3FK589LE).
All mutant exchangers obtained were verified by sequencing both
DNA strands (Primm, Milan, Italy). To stably express wild-type, sitedirected and deletion mutants of NCX3FLAG, pReceiver-M13 plasmids carrying cDNAs were transfected into wild-type baby hamster
kidney (BHK) cells by Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, San
Giuliano Milanese, Italy) protocol. Stable cell lines were selected by
G418 resistance and by a Ca2+-killing procedure.27

Immunoprecipitation Assay
BHK cells expressing NCX3 wild-type and mutant forms and brain cortex from control rats and rats exposed to tMCAO or preconditioning
followed by tMCAO were homogenized in lysis buffer containing: 50
mmol/L Hepes, pH, 7.4; 100 mmol/L NaCl; 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2; 0.2%
nonyl phenoxypolyethoxylethanol (NP40) with protease inhibitor cocktail; 1 mmol/L phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF); and 20 mmol/L
N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). One milligram of lysate was precleared
using protein A/Gplus (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX) for 1 hour at 4°C with
constant rotation and centrifuged for 2 minutes at 8000 rpm. Precleared
lysates from BHK cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-SUMO1
antibody (1:100; monoclonal anti-SUMO1 antibody, Quiagen) and
resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblot
analysis was performed using an antiflag antibody. Regarding lysates
from brain tissue, 1 mg of precleared lysate was immunoprecipitated
with an anti-NCX3 antibody (1:100 polyclonal anti-NCX3 antibody,
Swant) using the same experimental procedure described above. Finally,
total lysates or immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE gel
and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblot analysis was
performed using anti-SUMO1 and anti-NCX3 antibodies.

Primary Cortical Neurons and
Immunocytochemistry
Mixed cultures of cortical neurons from 2- to 4-day old Wistar
rat pups were prepared as previously described.28,29 For the

immunocytochemistry experiments, cortical neurons were rinsed
twice in cold 0.01 mol/L phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4 and
fixed at room temperature in 4%(wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (SigmaAldrich) for 20 minutes. Cells were blocked in phosphate-buffered
saline containing 10% fetal bovine serum and the following antibodies: anti-NCX3 rabbit (kindly supplied by Dr. Philipson, dilution 1:4000) and anti-SUMO monoclonal mouse (dilution 1:1000,
Santa Cruz). Neurons were then incubated overnight at 4°C. Next,
slides were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with
anti-rabbit cy2 antibody (dilution 1:200, Jackson Immunoresearch
Laboratories), and anti-mouse cy3 antibody (dilution 1:200, Jackson
Immunoresearch Laboratories) for 1 hour at room temperature
(25°C) under dark conditions, and washed again with phosphatebuffered saline. Finally, they were mounted onto Slow fade antifade
(Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) and images were observed using a
Zeiss LSM700 META/laser scanning confocal microscope. Single
images were taken with an optical thickness of 0.7 μm with a size of
1024×1024 pixels.

Tissue Processing, Immunostaining,
and Confocal Immunofluorescence
For the histological examination, control untouched animals or animals
exposed to tMCAO, preconditioning, or preconditioning+tMCAO
were transcardially perfused under deep anesthesia with saline solution containing 0.01 mL heparin, followed by 60 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in saline solution. The brains were removed and postfixed

(dilution 1:500, Santa Cruz) were used as primary antibodies. The

SUMO1 Conjugation Increases in the
Temporoparietal Cortex After Ischemia,
Preconditioning, and Preconditioning+Ischemia
In the ipsilesional temporoparietal cortex, SUMO1 protein
conjugation significantly increased at 5 and 24 hours after
tMCAO at 3, 5, 24, and 72 hours after preconditioning, and at 5
hours after preconditioning+tMCAO (Figures 1A through 1C).
The results obtained by western blot were confirmed by confocal immunofluorescent experiments. In particular, 5 hours
after tMCAO, preconditioning, or preconditioning+tMCAO,

SUMO1 immunolabeling increased in the temporoparietal
cortex (Figure 2).

SUMO1 Colocalizes With NCX3 in Primary
Cortical Neurons in Temporoparietal Cortex
and in Striatum of Ischemic or Preconditioned
Rats and Immunoprecipitates With NCX3
in Stably Transfected BHK Cells
Immunohistochemical analysis performed on rat brain slices
after tMCAO, preconditioning, and preconditioning+tMCAO
showed colocalization between NCX3 and SUMO1 signals
in the temporoparietal cortex (Figure 2 and Figure I in the
online-only Data Supplement). The colocalization between
NCX3 and SUMO1 was further confirmed in primary rat
cortical neurons by immunocytochemistry because they
colocalized in neuronal cell bodies in primary rat cortical
neurons (Figure 3). More important, NCX3 and SUMO1
signals, evaluated by confocal microscopy, colocalized
in the same confocal scan. We analyzed the probability
of NCX3 sumoylation, by using the SUMO plot analysis
program (http://www.abgent.com/sumoplot). This analysis showed that NCX3 contains 9 sequences that might be
recognized by the SUMO conjugation enzyme; however,
one of these regions was excluded because it is localized
extracellularly (Figure 4A), according to the newly proposed NCX3 topology. To assess the interaction between
SUMO1 and NCX3, we performed immunoprecipitation

experiments on wild-type BHK cells not expressing NCX3
and on BHK cells stably transfected with NCX3FLAG
(NCX3F). Immunoprecipitation with anti-SUMO1 antibody demonstrated a direct binding between NCX3 and
SUMO1 (Figure 4B). Furthermore, to better determine a
possible sumoylation site, we performed experiments on an
NCX3FLAG mutant lacking the f-loop (NCX3F∆f) because
this region contained most of the lysine residues with the

highest probability of SUMO1 binding. Wild-type and stably
transfected BHK cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with
SUMO1 antibody and then immunoblotted with an antiflag
antibody. Results showed the interaction between NCX3F
and SUMO1 in NCX3F-transfected BHK cells. By contrast,
no immunoprecipitate was observed in NCX3F∆f-transfected
BHK cells, and thus, restricting the putative sumoylation site
in the f-loop of the antiporter (Figure 4B). The substitution

of lysine 456, a residue with high probability of conjugation, with glutamate (NCX3K456E) did not prevent coimmunoprecipitation between NCX3 and SUMO1 (Figure 4C).
To restrict the analysis of the putative sumoylation sites,
we removed the Ca2+ binding domain 2, a subregion of the
f-loop 528 to 676 (NCX3F∆528–676) that contains 3 of the 7
sequences present in the f-loop. This NCX3 deletion mutant
showed no immunoprecipitation with SUMO1, thus suggesting that the lysine responsible for sumoylation was present
in this region. To determine the single amino acid residue
involved in SUMO1 attachment, we performed immunoprecipitation on a site-directed mutant obtained by substituting
phenylalanine 589 and lysine 590 with leucine and glutamate, respectively (NCX3FK589LE). In this case as well,
no immunoprecipitation was found, thus demonstrating that
lysine 590 is required for sumoylation (Figure 4C).
The biochemical interaction between SUMO1 and NCX3
was also confirmed in vivo. Indeed, results from immunoprecipitation experiments performed on rat cortex from ischemic
and preconditioned animals showed that NCX3 immunoprecipitated with SUMO1 (Figure 5A). Intriguingly, NCX1, the

other NCX isoform involved in the neuroprotection mediated
by preconditioning,18 did not immunoprecipitate with SUMO1
(data not shown).

SUMO1 Knockdown Downregulates NCX3
Protein Levels After Preconditioning+tMCAO
and Reduces the Neuroprotective Effect
Elicited by Ischemic Preconditioning in Rats
The effectiveness of siRNAs against SUMO1 was preliminarily evaluated in nonischemic rats (Figure 6A). To correlate
the neuroprotection mediated by SUMO1 with the interaction
between NCX3 and SUMO1, we verified whether SUMO1
knockdown was able to modulate NCX3 expression after
tMCAO and after preconditioning+tMCAO. SUMO1 silencing caused a decrease in NCX3 expression 72 hours after
tMCAO and after preconditioning+tMCAO in temporoparietal cortex (Figure 5B) compared with control animals. By
contrast, NCX3 expression significantly increased 72 hours
after preconditioning+tMCAO in rats receiving siRNA control (Figure 5B), as already published.18 Finally, SUMO1

knockdown induced a significant increase in ischemic volume after tMCAO (Figures 6B and 6C) evaluated both 24
and 72 hours after tMCAO induction and, more interestingly, it partially prevented the neuroprotective effect induced
by ischemic preconditioning (Figure 6B; % infarct volume:

Discussion
The results of this study demonstrate that SUMO1 is involved
in the neuroprotective mechanisms elicited by in vivo ischemic

preconditioning, and more interestingly, propose for the first
time NCX3, a downstream key player of neuroprotection in
stroke,17,18,30 as a new putative target of SUMO1 neuroprotective action.
Our results showed that silencing of SUMO1 significantly
increased the ischemic damage induced in rats by tMCAO and
partially reverted the neuroprotection mediated by ischemic
preconditioning. Consistent with these data, SUMO1 conjugation pattern significantly increased after ischemia in the
ipsilateral temporoparietal cortex, whereas no changes were
observed in the striatum (data not shown). The observation
that this increase occurred in a brain area that is far less damaged by ischemic injury than the striatum supports the hypothesis that sumoylation constitutes a cell protective response to
ischemic injury. More important, our evidence showing that
SUMO1 conjugation pattern also increased during ischemic
preconditioning in the ipsilateral temporoparietal cortex,
where a reduction of the damage occurred, further supports
the role of SUMO1 in ischemic preconditioning-induced

neuroprotection. The activation of sumoylation elicited by
the preconditioning stimulus might be sufficient to generate a long-lasting neuroprotection from the subsequent,
72 hours later, lethal ischemic insult. In fact, the different
time intervals for SUMO1 activation between tMCAO and
preconditioning+tMCAO may be explained by the fact that
sumoylation is a rapidly reversible process, but it may produce
a long-lasting effect.3
Interestingly, confocal analysis revealed that NCX3 and
SUMO1 signals increased in the same neurons after preconditioning and preconditioning followed by tMCAO.
This finding constituted the prerequisite for a cellular interaction between NCX3 and SUMO1. The results obtained
by coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated a
direct binding between NCX3 and SUMO1. Lysine 590
might represent the SUMO1 posttranslational modification site on NCX3. Interestingly, this residue is located in
the main cytosolic f-loop, a region involved in the regulation of NCX stability and activity,31,32 thus suggesting
that NCX3 sumoylation might influence the stability of
the antiporter. Indeed, an important aspect emerging from
this article is that after SUMO1 silencing, a downregulation of NCX3 protein levels occurred during tMCAO and
preconditioning+tMCAO, thus indicating that a decrease
in SUMO1-mediated protection of NCX3 from degradation may occur. Interestingly, the NCX3 reduction observed
after tMCAO alone that we already reported in previous
papers18,33,34 was further decreased by SUMO1 silencing
72 hours after the occlusion, thus suggesting that NCX3
sumoylation process also participates in the tMCAO phase.
In particular, it reduces NCX3 downregulation, thus contributing to the neuroprotective effect of sumoylation during this phase. More important, whereas NCX3 expression
increased after preconditioning+tMCAO when SUMO1 was
normally expressed, it decreased to lower levels compared
with control conditions after SUMO1 silencing in rats subjected to preconditioning+tMCAO. These results suggest
that NCX3 sumoylation by SUMO1 may preserve NCX3
from degradation during ischemic conditions and that
NCX3 might be one of the SUMO1-mediated neuroprotective mechanisms involved in ischemic preconditioning.
The involvement of SUMO1 in preconditioning is also
supported by previous in vitro observations. For instance,
preconditioned neurons maintain elevated SUMO1 conjugation levels, whereas SUMO1-silenced neurons display a
reduced survival rate after oxygen and glucose deprivation
and an attenuated protective response to preconditioning.8
Similarly, in in vivo studies, transgenic mice overexpressing SUMO conjugating enzyme, Ubc9, are more resistant to
brain ischemia.35
Interestingly, in the torpor phase of hibernating ground
squirrels,8 which represents a preconditioning-like state, a
massive conjugation of SUMO1 occurs that provides a protection to the oligemic conditions.36

Conclusions
Collectively, our results show that SUMO1 plays a fundamental role in the neuroprotection elicited by ischemic

preconditioning and that its protective role might be, at
least in part, mediated by NCX3 sumoylation. Finally, this
posttranslational process may open new experimental studies for generating innovative compounds that could activate
sumoylation to enhance the beneficial effect of ischemic
preconditioning.

Analysis of SUMO1 and NCX3 signals in the contralateral temporoparietal cortex of
Rats exposed to tMCAO, preconditioning or preconditioning+tMCAO

Tissue processing, immunostaining and confocal immunofluorescence
Control untouched animals or animals exposed to tMCAO, preconditioning or
preconditioning+tMCAO were transcardially perfused under deep anesthesia with saline
solution containing 0.01 ml heparin, followed by 60 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in saline
solution. The brains were removed and post-fixed overnight at +4 °C and cryoprotected in
30% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) with sodium azide 0.02% for 48 h at 4 °C.
The brains were sectioned and frozen on a sliding cryostat at 40 μm thickness. Rabbit antiNCX3 antibodies (kindly provided

by Dr. Philipson, dilution 1:4000) and mouse anti-

SUMO1 antibodies (dilution 1:500, Santa Cruz, Dallas, Texas) were used as primary
antibodies. The sections were then incubated with the corresponding fluorescent-labelled
secondary antibodies (Alexa 488/Alexa 594-conjugated antimouse/antirabbit IgGs). Nuclei
were counterstained with Hoechst. Images were observed with a Zeiss LSM510
META/laser scanning confocal microscope. Single images were taken with an optical
thickness of 0.7 m with a size of 1024x1024 pixels from the temporoparietal cortex of
control animals not subjected to any surgical procedure and the undamaged contralateral
temporoparietal

cortex

of

animals

subjected

to

tMCAO,

preconditioning

and

preconditioning+tMCAO.. In double-labelled sections, the pattern of immunoreactivity for
both antigens was identical to that seen in single-stained material. In control groups
primary antisera were replaced with normal serum. A possible cross-reactivity between
IgGs in double immunolabelling experiments was assessed by processing sections
through the same immunocytochemical sequence except that the primary antisera were
replaced either with normal serum or with only one primary antibody; the full complement
of the secondary antibodies was maintained. In addition, because the secondary
antibodies used in this study are highly pre-adsorbed to the IgGs of numerous species,
tissue labelling without primary antibodies was also tested to exclude autofluorescence.
No specific staining was observed under these control conditions, thus confirming the
specificity of the immunosignals.
