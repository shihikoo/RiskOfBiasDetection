Abstract: In our previous study, we found that trans-2-decenoic acid ethyl ester (DAEE), a
derivative of a medium-chain fatty acid, elicits neurotrophin-like signals including the
activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) in cultured mouse
cortical neurons. Here, we examined the efficacy of intraperitoneal administration of
DAEE on the treatment of a mouse model of the cerebral infarction caused by unilateral
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (PMCAO). DAEE-treatment (100 µg/kg body
weight injected at 0.5, 24, 48, 72 h after PMCAO) significantly restored the mice from
PMCAO-induced neurological deficits including motor paralysis when evaluated 48, 72,
and 96 h after the PMCAO. Furthermore, DAEE facilitated the phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 on the infarction side of the brain when analyzed by Western immunoblot
analysis, and it enhanced the number of phosphorylated ERK1/2-positive cells in the
border areas between the infarction and non-infarction regions of the cerebral cortex, as
estimated immunohistochemically. As the infarct volume remained unchanged after
DAEE-treatment, it is more likely that DAEE improved the neurological condition through
enhanced neuronal functions of the remaining neurons in the damaged areas rather than by

maintaining neuronal survival. These results suggest that DAEE has a neuro-protective
effect on cerebral infarction.

1. Introduction
Previously, we demonstrated that medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) with 8–12 carbons and their
esters facilitated activation (phosphorylation) of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2
(ERK1/2) in cultured embryonic cortical neurons [1,2]. In particular, trans-2-decenoic acid ethyl ester
(DAEE: C12H22O2 = 198.30: Figure 1) has the most potent activity among these compounds, and
causes the activation of intracellular signal molecules other than ERK1/2 such as Akt and
cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor, suggesting that DAEE has
neurotrophin-like activities on neurons and thus may be a promising therapeutic tool for certain
neurological disorders including cerebral infarction.
Figure 1. The chemical structure of trans-2-decenoic acid ethyl ester (DAEE).

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophin family, and it stimulates
neuronal differentiation and maintains survival of various neuronal populations. Recent investigations
revealed a relationship between BDNF and various neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s
disease [3], Alzheimer’s disease [4], depression [5], and anxiety-related personal trait [6].
These findings suggest the availability of BDNF as a therapeutic tool for particular neurological
disorders, and BDNF has been successfully tested in animal models of various diseases. However,
clinical trials have been less successful at demonstrating therapeutic efficacy [7]. Many technical and
pharmacological issues, for instance, instability of the protein and/or a lack of an appropriate
delivery system, remain unsolved. To overcome these problems, the development of stable and small
molecules with BDNF-like activity that pass through the blood-brain barrier may represent an
alternative approach.
Stroke is the third commonest cause of death in industrialized countries, leading disability in adult
and elderly individuals [8]. Cerebral infarction is caused by occlusion of the cerebral arteries [9], and
vascular reperfusion therapy is the most effective tool for the prevention of brain injury and reduction
of mortality in patients with acute cerebral infarction. In addition to the reperfusion therapy,
establishment of effective neuroprotective therapies have been anticipated. For instance, edaravone, a
strong free radical scavenger, is considered to have a preventive effect against cerebral infarction [10].

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13

4970

However, the major functional mechanism of edaravone is based on reducing the secondary damage
caused by free radicals generated after ischemia. A novel therapeutic tool that can act on neurons
directly and preserve their function would contribute to the improvement of the prognosis of patients
with cerebral infarction. DAEE may be one such candidate, because it is a compound that can generate
neurotrophin-like signals. Therefore, we examined the ameliorative or therapeutic effects of DAEE on
a mouse model of the cerebral infarction caused by unilateral permanent middle cerebral artery
occlusion (PMCAO).
2. Results
2.1. Evaluation of Functional Recovery after PMCAO
Recovery of the locomotor function of the right side of body was evaluated by using the scale
described later.
Figure 2. Improvement of neurological conditions by the treatment with DAEE. Values
were assessed at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
(PMCAO). Significance: * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 vs. vehicle with Mann-Whitney U test
(n = 58 [DAEE group] or 60 [vehicle control]). No significant difference was observed in
mortality (score = 4) by use of Chi-square test.

PMCAO resulted in moderate motor paralysis of the contralateral side (scale: 2) 0.5 h after the
occlusion. Recovery from the motor paralysis was significantly enhanced by intraperitoneal
administration of DAEE compared with the paralysis seen in the vehicle-treated group, when evaluated
48, 72, and 96 h after PMCAO. The neurological condition was thus improved in the DAEE-treated
group. That is, improvement of the locomotor function from scale 2 to scale 1 occurred earlier in the

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13

4971

DAEE-treated group than in the vehicle-treated group (Figure 2). The survival rate of 96 h after
PMCAO was higher in the DAEE-treated group than that of the vehicle-treated group (91.7% vs.
84.5%, respectively), however, no significant difference was observed (P = 0.23, Chi-square test).
2.2. Measurement of Infarct Volume
Next we examined the infarct volume by staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC;
Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) to assess the effect of DAEE treatment quantitatively 96 h
after PMCAO. TTC reacts with intact mitochondrial respiratory enzymes to generate a bright-red color
that stand in contrast with the pale color of an infarction [11,12]. As the borderlines between normal
and infarct areas cannot be detected in microscopic view by TTC staining, Nissl staining is applicable
to designate the ischemic region histochemically [13]. The infarction range detected by TTC is
perceived to be the same as that detected by Nissl staining. So, we confirmed that the borderlines
determined by Nissl staining almost corresponded to those by TTC staining at the microscopic level.
Although neuronal death had occurred in the infarct area, no significant differences in the infarct area
or volume were found between vehicle- and DAEE-treated groups (Figure 3).

mice; (C) Brain infarct area measured 96 h after PMCAO. Brains were removed, and the
forebrains were sliced into five coronal 2-mm sections. The section numbers correspond to
the numbers of “A” and “B”. The brain infarct area was not significantly different between
the two groups (vs. vehicle; Student’s t-test; n = 6 or 5). The values are expressed as the
means ± SEs; (D) Brain infarct volume measured 96 h after PMCAO. There was no
significant difference in infarct volume between both groups (Student’s t-test; n = 6 or 5).
The values are expressed as the means ± SEs.

2.3. Activation of ERK1/2
Activation of ERK1/2 by PMCAO was assessed by Western blot analysis with specific antibody
against ERK1/2 or phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2). DAEE-treatment significantly raised the level
of pERK1/2 4 days after PMCAO to one higher than that of the vehicle-treatment group (Figure 4-A).

DAEE-treatment. (A) Immunoblot profiles of pERK1/2 (a-1) and ERK1/2 (a-2) of the

ratio of the intensity of the band of pERK1/2 to that of ERK1/2. The values are expressed
as the means ± SEs (n = 6). Significance: * P < 0.05 vs. vehicle (Student’s t-test).
(B) Photographs “a” to “d” showed Nissl stained profiles, and “e” and “f” are
immunostained ones by anti-pERK1/2. Photographs “a” and “b” are Nissl stained profiles
taken with low-power-magnification. The boxes in photograph “a” and “b” include the
border region between infarct and non-infarct areas, and enlarged as shown in photographs
“c” and “d”. Photographs “a” and “c” are profiles obtained from the vehicle-treated group
and “b” and “d”, from the DAEE-treated group. The scale bar for both photographs is
500 µm. The dotted lines in photographs “c” and “d” indicate the borderlines between the
infarction and non-infarction areas that were determined in terms of the Nissl-positive cell
density. Photographs “e” and “f” are profiles taken from the adjacent sections
immunostained for pERK1/2 in the vehicle- and DAEE-treated groups, respectively. The
same dotted lines shown in “c” and “d” were drawn on the photographs “e” and “f”. The
scale bar indicated in “c” is 100 µm and also applicable to “d”–“f”. The pERK1/2-positive
cells were counted in the 3 regions, i.e., the infarction area lateral to the borderline
(photograph “g”), the ischemic penumbra on the borderline (photograph “h”), and the
normal area medial to the borderline (photograph “i”). Each count was expressed as the
number of pERK1/2-positive cells/ (200 × 200) µm2. These cells, indicated by the arrows
in photograph “f”, were significantly greater in number in the ischemic penumbra at the
borderline (* P < 0.05 vs. vehicle; Student’s t-test; n = 3) in the DAEE-treated group than
in the vehicle-treated group. However, in the other 2 areas (normal and ischemic), there
were no significant differences between the 2 groups (vs. vehicle; Student’s t-test; n = 3).

2.4. Expression of pERK1/2 in Ischemic Penumbra
Nissl staining was performed to determine the border between the normal and infarct areas. The
Nissl-positive cells were defined as the cells with a diameter of 10 µm or more. We regarded the
normal area as that where the density of Nissl-positive cells was over 5 cells/50 × 50 µm2; and the
infarct area, as the region with a lower cell density. In this way, we could get polygonal lines. So, we
drew curves through the midpoints of each straight line of them fitted by eye. Therefore, we defined
the curve as the borderline between the normal and infarct areas. On each consecutive slice, the
number of pERK1/2-positive cells was counted in the normal, infarct, and border areas. We counted
the numbers in a square area 200 µm on a side with a focus on the borderline as the border area, in the
same sized square just medial to the border area as the normal area, and in the square just lateral to it
as the infarct area. These areas were counted in high-powered fields on a section through the anterior
commissure. Each count was expressed as number of pERK1/2-positive cells/200 × 200 µm2 (n = 3).
In the DAEE-treated group, pERK1/2-positive cells were observed in the border area between the
infarct and normal areas, namely, in the area containing Nissl stained neurons, in the cerebral cortex.
On the other hand, in the vehicle-treated group, pERK1/2-positive cells in the border area were
significantly fewer than those in the DAEE-treated group. The numbers of the pERK1/2-positive cells
in the other areas, i.e., normal and infarct areas, were not significantly different between the two
groups (Figure 4-B).

2.5. Expression of BDNF mRNAs after PMCAO
The mRNA expression of BDNF was investigated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR). DAEE-treatment significantly raised the expression of BDNF 96 h after PMCAO
higher than that of the vehicle-treatment group (Figure 5).

the ratio of the intensity of the band of BDNF to that of β-actin. The values are expressed
as the means ± SEs (n = 5–6). Significance: * P < 0.05 vs. vehicle (Student’s t-test).

3. Discussion
The present results demonstrated the beneficial effects of DAEE on functional recovery after
PMCAO, although no significant differences in mortality rate were observed between DAEE and
vehicle group 96 h after PMCAO. Furthermore, the size of the infarct area was not significantly
different between DAEE- and vehicle- treated groups. It was conspicuous, however, that the level of
pERK1/2 in the hemisphere with the infarction was elevated in the DAEE-treated group when judged
by Western blotting. The immunohistochemical results confirmed this observation by demonstrating
that there were more pERK1/2-positive cells in the DAEE-treated group than in the vehicle-treated
group around the borderline (ischemic penumbra) in the cerebral cortex. These results suggest that
DAEE preserved the neuronal function in the ischemic penumbra through the activation of ERK1/2 to
stimulate expression of neurotrophins and thus contributed to functional recovery. As DAEE did not
significantly reduce the infarct size in TTC- and/or Nissl-stained sections, it remains uncertain whether
or not DAEE treatment could rescue neurons from dying.
It is well known that ERK1/2 mediates the expression of neuroprotective activity of extracellular
neurotrophic factors including neurotrophins. In the nervous system, ERK1/2 is critical for neuronal

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13

4975

differentiation and synapse plasticity and may also modulate neuronal survival. Activation of ERK1/2
protects neurons by compensating for the deleterious effects of a damaging insult [14]. The present
study showed that pERK1/2-positive cells were localized in the border area between normal and
infarct areas in the DAEE-treated group, suggesting that DAEE promoted the activation of ERK1/2 in
the neurons damaged by ischemia, perhaps resulting in protection against neuronal death.
In the present study, we found that DAEE did not affect the infarct volume. Jiang et al. indicated
that BDNF protects neurons against an ischemic insult without affecting the infarct volume estimated
by TTC staining [15]. However, they indicated that BDNF prevents the loss of neurons detected by
Nissl staining, in the border between normal and infarct areas [15]. Their results suggest that BDNF
does not reduce the infarct volume when the gross appearance is observed after TTC staining but that
this neurotrophic factor has the ability to prevent neuronal cell loss in the border area when observed
microscopically. Therefore, DAEE may also preserve the survival and function of neuronal cells
through the activation of ERK1/2 in the ischemic penumbra.
DAEE-treatment enhanced the expression of BDNF mRNAs in present study. These results indicate
that DAEE through increased BDNF expression improves the functional recovery after cerebral
infarction. Even though DAEE increases the BDNF mRNA (Figure 5), this would not affect the
infarction but rather improve the neurological function.
In recent years, evidence has been reported to indicate that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) have therapeutic
potential in animal models of various neuronal disorders [16–18]. Although limited information is
available about the effect of MCFAs on neuronal cells, some recent reports have described such
effects. For instance, MCFAs facilitate neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells through the activation of
MAPK (p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK1/2 pathways [19]; and 10-hydroxy-trans
2-decenoic acid stimulates the neurogenesis of cultured neural stem/progenitor cells, partly mimicking
the effect of BDNF [20].
Neurotrophins such as BDNF bind to a specific TrkB receptor tyrosine kinase [21], which causes
autophosphorylation of the TrkB receptor to trigger signal transduction cascades including the
pathways of MAPK/ERK1/2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and phospholipase C-γ [22]. These
signals then pass into the nucleus to activate transcription factors such as CREB, which activation
leads to the expression of genes that regulate neuronal functions. The mechanism of DAEE action is
unclear at present. However, we have found that DAEE has the ability to stimulate the phosphorylation
of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and of ErbB2 (Abe et al., unpublished results). Although
it is unclear at present whether TrkB is involved in the putative action mechanism, it is likely that
DAEE stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in concentration- and time-dependent manners, and
activated Akt located in downstream of PI3K, and CREB through activation of EGFR and/or
ErbB2. These observations suggest that DAEE behaves like EGF or vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF).
Neurotrophic factors including BDNF and EGF have been considered as regulators of neuronal
survival and differentiation during development and for maintenance of neuronal functions in
adulthood, including synaptic plasticity [23]. Some reports about the beneficial effects of BDNF on
cerebral ischemic models were published earlier [24,25]. Furthermore, Ferrer et al. reported that
BDNF specifically up-regulates its full-length TrkB receptor in cortical neurons in the penumbra area

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13

4976

in a rat model of focal ischemia [9]; and Jiang et al. indicated that BDNF protects the brain against
ischemic insult by modulating local inflammation via regulation of the levels of cellular cytokines and
transcription factors in a rat model of PMCAO [15]. However, the clinical trials have been less
successful because of many technical and pharmacological issues [26]. These considerations suggest
promising availability of DAEE as a therapeutic tool for particular neurological disorders.
Furthermore, Hirakwa et al. found beneficial effects of DAEE on locomotor function after a spinal
cord injury in rats [2].
Nowadays, oxidative stress is considered to be a principal factor promoting brain damage after
ischemia. A prime goal of neuroprotective strategy is thus to reduce oxidative damage. In fact,
edaravone, a radical scavenger, has been approved as a neuroprotective agent against acute cerebral
infarction in Japan [8]. Recent investigations have revealed that propofol, a potent intravenously
delivered hypnotic agent, also protects the brain against ischemic injury, by reducing cerebral blood
flow, cerebral oxygen metabolism, and intracranial pressure by scavenging free radicals and by
decreasing lipid peroxidation [27]. The mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of DAEE on
neuronal cells would be different from these mechanisms. In some reports about the effects of
edaravone on cerebral infarction, the effective doses of edaravone is 1.5–9 mg/kg body weight in
animal models [28–30]. And clinical dose of it is 2.4 mg/kg patients [30]. Compared with these doses
of edaravone, the effective dose of DAEE for mice model of cerebral infarction was extremely low
(100 µg/kg) in this study. It also indicates the effectiveness of DAEE.
We previously found that the phosphorylation level of ERK1/2 in the cerebral cortex
and hippocampus was facilitated in the mice received DAEE intraperitoneally compared with
vehicle-treated mice (Makino et al., unpublished data). These results suggest permeability of DAEE
and related active conpound through blood-brain barrier. DAEE is a stable molecule with neurotrophic
activities, overcoming the various problems of instability and lack of an appropriate delivery system
that remain to be problematic with BDNF; and it has novel functional mechanisms of neuroprotection
that are different from those of substances and drugs already known. In consideration of these
attributes, appending DAEE-treatment to the existing therapy for cerebral infarction may improve the
prognosis of the patients.
4. Experimental Section
4.1. Animal Model of Cerebral Infarction
The experiments were conducted in accordance with the Animal Care Guidance issued by the
Animal Experiments Committee of the graduate school of Gifu University and Gifu Pharmaceutical
University. All experiments were performed by using male ddY mice (5-week old; body weight 27 to
33 g) purchased from Japan SLC Ltd., (Shizuoka, Japan). Cerebral infarction was produced by
permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. Anesthesia was induced using 2.0 to 3.0%
isoflurane and maintained by using 1.5 to 2.0% isoflurane with 70% N2O/30% O2 delivered by means
of an animal general anesthesia machine (Soft Lander, Sin-ei Industry Co Ltd., Saitama, Japan). The
regional cerebral blood flow in each mouse was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry (Omega-Flow
flo-N1; Omegawave Inc., Tokyo, Japan). A flexible probe was fixed to the skull (2 mm posterior and

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13

4977

6 mm lateral to bregma). After a midline skin incision had been made, the left common carotid artery
was exposed and occluded. An 8-0 nylon monofilament (Eticon, Somerville, NJ, USA) coated with a
mixture of silicone resin (Provil; Hereus Kulzer Inc., Hanau, Germany) was introduced into the left
common carotid artery and advanced it along the internal carotid artery until the tip occluded the
proximal stem of the middle cerebral artery, as described earlier [31,32].
4.2. Administration of the Drug
DAEE was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC. DAEE was dissolved in 0.1% dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO; Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan) and diluted with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). It was administered intraperitoneally into the animals at a dose of 100 µg/kg at 0.5, 24, 48,
and 72 h after PMCAO. Control animals received vehicle (PBS) containing 0.1% DMSO without DAEE.
4.3. Analysis of Animal Behavior
Mice (vehicle; n = 58, DAEE; n = 60) were tested for neurological deficits, as described earlier [31]
at 0.5, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after PMCAO. Scoring was done by using the following scale: 0, no
observable neurological deficits (normal); 1, failure to extend the right forepaw (mild); 2, circling to
the contralateral side (moderate); 3, loss of walking or righting reflex (severe); 4, dead. The
investigators were masked as to the group to which each mouse belonged.
4.4. Measurement of Infarct Volume
The brains were removed immediately after the mice had been given an overdose of diethyl ether, at
96 h after PMCAO, and cut into 5 serial 2-mm-thick coronal block slices. These slices were immersed
for 20 min in a 2% solution of TTC. Image J software was used to measure the unstained areas of the
total infarctions, and the infarction volume was calculated as described previously [31].
4.5. Western Immunoblot Analysis
The brains were dissected out as described in the previous section. The left hemisphere of the anterior
4th slice was used for Western blotting. Tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.4, containing 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 10 µg/mL aprotinin, 10 µg/mL leupeptin, 50 mM
NaVO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF], 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS] and 1% Na
deoxycholate) and then centrifuged, after which the supernatant fluids were collected. Protein
concentrations of the supernatants were determined with a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL, USA). Each sample, 2.8 µg protein for ERK1/2 and 7.0 µg protein for pERK1/2 was
subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene
fluoride membranes by electrophoresis. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5%
skim milk (Morinaga Milk Products, Tokyo, Japan) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20
(TBS/Tween 20) and then incubated with primary antibody against ERK1/2 or pERK1/2 (1:1000, Cell
Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) for 2 h. After having been washed with TBS/Tween 20, the
membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody
(1:5000 Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for 3 h. Finally the specific protein bands were developed with nitro

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13

4978

blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indrylphosphate p-toluidine salt. The intensity of immunoreactive
bands was measured by use of image-analysis software (NIH Image J).
4.6. Histopathological and Immunohistchemical Study
Brains were removed after cardio-perfusion with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde solution prepared in
0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (fixative), 96 h after PMCAO, postfixed in the same fixative
overnight, soaked in PBS containing 20% (w/v) sucrose, and frozen in embedding compound (Sakura
Finetek, Tokyo, Japan). Coronal sections of 30-µm thickness were prepared with a cryostat (model
CM 1800; Leica, Nussloch, Germany), attached to adhesive-coated slides (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan),
dried, and soaked in the above fixative for 30 min.
The sections were stained for Nissl substance with 0.1% thionin, dehydrated by passage through an
ascending series of ethanol, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped with Euikit (O. Kindler, Freiburg,
Germany) [33]. For immunohistochemistry with the chromogen diaminobenzidine (DAB), the sections
were treated with TBS/0.3% Triton X-100 containing 0.3% H2O2 for 3 h, rinsed for 1 h in the same
solution, washed 3 times with TBS and blocked for 30 min with 2% (w/v) Block Ace (Dainippon
Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) dissolved in TBS (blocking solution). Next, the sections
were incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibody against pERK1/2 (1:1000; Chemicon, Temecula, CA,
USA). After a wash with TBS, the sections were incubated for 3 h with anti-rabbit IgG goat antibody
(1:1000; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). The sections were then incubated in ABC
solution (Elite ABC, Vector Laboratories) with gentle shaking at 4 °C overnight and further treated
according to the glucose oxidase-DAB-nickel method. Finally the sections were stained with
3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) for 5–10 min.
4.7. RT-PCR
The brains were dissected out as described in the previous section. The left hemisphere of the
anterior 4th slice was used for RT-PCR experiment. RNA was prepared from the collected tissues by
using TRIZOL (Invirtogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacture’s instructuins. RT-PCR
was performed with PowerScriptTM Reverse Transcriptase (Clontech, CA, USA) by following the
manufacturer’s instructions. The synthesized cDNAs were amplified with each pair of primers by PCR.
The following primer sets were used: β-actin, 5′-GTGGGCCGCTCTAGGCACCAA-3′ and 5′CTCTTTGATATCACGCACGAT-3′ BDNF, 5′-GGAATTCGAGTGATGACCATCCTTTTCCTTAC3′ and 5′-CGGATCCCTATCTTCCCCTTTTAATGGTCAGTG-3′. The amplification was carried out
under the following conditions: denaturation, 94 °C for 45 s; annealing, 63 °C (for β-actin) or 65 °C
(for BDNF) for 45 s; and extension, 72 °C for 45 s. The cycle was repeated 26 times for β-actin,
33 times for BDNF. β-actin was used as an internal control. PCR products were electrophoresed in 2%
agarose gels and visualized by Ethidium Bromide staining. The intensity of the bands was analyzed by
used of image-analysis software (NIH Image J).

4.8. Statistical Analysis
Statistical comparisons were made using two-way analysis of variance followed by Mann-Whitney
U test, Chi-square test, or Student’s t-test.
5. Conclusions
We presently found that DAEE acted to facilitate functional recovery of locomotion activity after
PMCAO. These findings suggest the possibility that DAEE will become a promising tool for
cerebral infarction.
