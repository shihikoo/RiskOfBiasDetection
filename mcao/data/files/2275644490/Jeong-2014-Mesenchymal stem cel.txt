Numerous studies have reported that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can ameliorate neurological deficits in ischemic stroke
models. Among the various hypotheses that have been suggested to explain the therapeutic mechanism underlying these
observations, neurogenesis is thought to be critical. To enhance the therapeutic benefits of human bone marrow-derived
MSCs (hBM-MSCs), we efficiently modified hBM-MSCs by introduction of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
gene via adenoviral transduction mediated by cell-permeable peptides and investigated whether BDNF-modified hBM-MSCs
(MSCs-BDNF) contributed to functional recovery and endogenous neurogenesis in a rat model of middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO). Transplantation of MSCs induced the proliferation of 5-bromo-2Û∏Ä† -deoxyuridine (BrdU-) positive cells in the
subventricular zone. Transplantation of MSCs-BDNF enhanced the proliferation of endogenous neural stem cells more significantly,
while suppressing cell death. Newborn cells differentiated into doublecortin (DCX-) positive neuroblasts and Neuronal Nuclei
(NeuN-) positive mature neurons in the subventricular zone and ischemic boundary at higher rates in animals with MSCsBDNF compared with treatment using solely phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or MSCs. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining
and behavioral analysis revealed greater functional recovery in animals with MSCs-BDNF compared with the other groups. MSCsBDNF exhibited effective therapeutic potential by protecting cell from apoptotic death and enhancing endogenous neurogenesis.

1. Introduction
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have displayed capabilities
in regenerative therapy for the treatment of stroke, as a
ready supply of angiogenic, antiapoptosis, and mitogenic
factors and for their ability to migrate in damaged tissue and
differentiate into neuronal cells [1, 2]. MSCs possess and can
secrete neurotrophic factors [2, 3]. Transplantation of MSCs
enhances functional recovery and endogenous neurogenesis
in stroke models [4‚Äì6].
Endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) have been identified in the brain and spinal cord of embryonic, postnatal, and
adult rodents and primates [7, 8]. These cells reside mainly

in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and in the subgranular
zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus [9, 10]. When adult rodents
are subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO),
the resulting infarction injury stimulates a low level of
endogenous neurogenesis in the SVZ of the affected side [11].
This is a promising target for therapeutic intervention, as
it may be amenable to enhancement by adding appropriate
factors that increase proliferation, migration, and differentiation, as well as functional integration [11]. Some candidate
factors, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast
growth factor-2 (FGF-2), brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF),
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glial cell-derived

2
neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and insulin-like growth factor-1
(IGF-1), enhance the endogenous response to acute and
subacute ischemic stroke [11‚Äì18].
BDNF is secreted by brain cells and induces neuroprotection. BDNF also crucially promotes the synaptic and
axonal plasticity associated with learning, memory, and
sensorimotor recovery [15]. As BDNF can stimulate neuronal
differentiation in vitro, it has also been used to induce
neurogenesis after focal ischemia [15, 19]. In addition to
qualitatively enhancing neural structural plasticity, BDNF
increases the number of newborn neurons in several regions
of the brain [15]. Administration of BDNF modified MSCs
has produced therapeutic benefits in a rat model of transient
MCAO [20]. However, the potential of this approach regarding endogenous neurogenesis is unclear.
To test the hypothesis that a combined therapy of BDNF
and MSCs enhances endogenous neurogenesis to a greater
extent than MSCs alone, the present study investigated the
effects of intracranial transplantation of BDNF modified
human bone marrow-derived MSCs (MSCs-BDNF) on functional recovery and endogenous neurogenesis in a rat model
of MCAO.

2. Material and Methods
2.1. Preparation of Human MSCs. Human bone marrowderived mesenchymal stem cells (Catholic MASTER Cells)
were obtained from Catholic Institute of Cell Therapy (CIC,
Seoul, Korea). Human bone marrow (BM) aspirates were
obtained from the iliac crest of healthy donors aged 20 to
55 years after approval by the Institutional Review Board of
Seoul St. Mary‚Äôs Hospital (approval numbers KIRB-00344009 and KIRB-00362-006). Bone marrow aspirate from
each consented donor was collected and sent to the GMPcompliant facility of Catholic Institute of Cell Therapy (Seoul,
Korea, http://www.cic.re.kr) for the isolation, expansion, and
quality control of human marrow-derived mesenchymal stem
cells (hBM-MSCs). The marrow mixture was centrifuged at
4‚àò C, 793 g for 7 minutes to obtain a marrow pellet. After
removal of the supernatant, red blood cells were removed
by adding and suspending in 10-fold volume of sterile
distilled water. Cell pellet obtained by centrifugating the
RBC-deprived sample was then suspended in MSC growth
medium (Dulbecco‚Äôs modified Eagle‚Äôs medium-low glucose
(DMEM-LG, PAA, Austria), 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
PAA, Austria)). They were added to T-75 tissue culture flasks
(NUNC, NY, USA), which were placed in CO2 incubator to
initiate culture. The incubator was maintained at 37‚àò C with
5% CO2 . The MSC growth medium was used for all cell
expansion procedures, unless mentioned otherwise. Media
were replaced twice per week. Cells were detached when
they reached 70‚àº90% confluence and replated at a density
of 5‚àº8 √ó 103 cells/cm2 . Cells were expanded 2 to 4 passages
in the GMP-compliant facility. During cell expansion, cells
were tested for bacterial sterility, mycoplasma sterility, and
endotoxin level (<3 EU/mL). In addition, multidifferentiation potential and cellular surface antigens (CD90/CD73,

BioMed Research International
>95% positive; CD34/CD45, >95% negative) were tested for
cells after 4th passage.
A recombinant replication-defective adenovirus (rAd)
expressing human BDNF was generated using the AdEasy
Vector System (QBioGene) as previously described [21]. To
transfect hUCB-MSCs, adenoviruses at a specified MOI were
pretreated with protein transduction domain (PTD) [22].
2.2. MCAO Model. Rat MCAO was used as the stroke
model. Transient MCAO was performed using a previously
described method of intraluminal vascular occlusion [23].
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 270‚Äì300 g were
initially anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and maintained
under anesthesia with 1.5% isoflurane in a mixture of 70%
N2 O and 30% O2 using a face mask. Body temperature
(as assessed via rectal measurement) was maintained at
37‚àò C with a heating pad (Panlab S.L., Barocelona, Spain).
A 20.0 mm 4‚Äì0 surgical Dermalon suture with the tip
rounded by heating near a flame was advanced from the
right external carotid artery (ECA) into the lumen of the
internal carotid artery (ICA) until it blocked the origin of
the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Ninety minutes after the
MCAO, the animal was reanesthetized with isoflurane and
reperfusion was performed by withdrawal of the suture until
the tip cleared the lumen of the ECA. All animal protocols
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee in School of Medicine, The Catholic University
of Korea.
2.3. Transplantation of MSCs. Stereotaxic surgery was performed with animals under isoflurane anesthesia 3 days postMCAO. We transplanted 5 ùúáL suspensions of 5 √ó 105 cells
in PBS into one site ipsilateral (AP: +1.0; ML: +2.2; DV:
‚àí5.0) to the lesion. Experiments consisted of three groups
(ùëõ = 69) assigned randomly: administration of PBS alone
(control) (ùëõ = 23), of naive MSCs (ùëõ = 23), or of MSCsBDNF (ùëõ = 23). A microinfusion pump (KD scientific,
Holliston, MA) was used to maintain the speed of delivery at
0.5 ùúáL/min. The needle was left in situ for 2 min postinjection,
before slow removal. The rats were injected with 5-bromo2Û∏Ä† -deoxyuridine (BrdU, 50 mg/kg; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) on
the day of transplantation and daily for 4 days after the
transplantation.
2.4. Behavior Tests. Behavior tests in animals were performed
before the MCAO and at 1, 7, 14, and 28 days after MCAO.
A blind tester assessed sensorimotor function using an
adhesive-removal method. Adhesive paper dots (120) were
used as tactile stimuli on the wrist of the left forepaw, and
animals were observed in a cage. The time, to a maximum
of 3 min, necessary for each rat to remove the tape from the
forelimb (removal time) was recorded in three trials per day.
An accelerating rotarod (Ugo Basile, Italy) evaluation was
used to measure rat motor function. The rats were placed on
a rotarod cylinder, and the time that the animal remained
on the rotarod was measured. The speed was increased from
4 to 40 rpm within 5 min. The trial ended if the animal fell
off the rung or gripped the device and spun around for two

BioMed Research International

3

consecutive revolutions without attempting to walk on the
rung. The data are presented as the percentage of the mean
duration (three trials) on the rotarod compared with an initial
baseline control (before MCAO).
2.5. Detection of BDNF In Vitro and In Vivo. Culture supernatants were collected for analysis 48 h after hUCB-MSCs
were transfected in vitro at various MOIs (pfu/cell). One
week after MCAO, rats were anesthetized with ketamine and
xylazine i.p., their brains were removed, and coronal sections
(100 mg) from ‚àí1.0 to +2.0 mm to bregma in the ischemic
hemisphere were dissected on ice and stored ‚àí80‚àò C until
use. Subsequently, each tissue sample was suspended in an
equal weight of homogenate buffer (T-PER Reagent; Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL) and homogenized using a Precellys
24 homogenizer (Bertin, France). The homogenate was centrifuged (10,000 √óg) for 10 min at 4‚àò C, and the supernatant
was collected for analysis. Commercial BDNF enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Chemicon, Temecula,
CA) were used to quantify the concentration of BDNF in each
sample.
2.6. TTC Staining and Quantitative Analysis of Infarct Volume.
Rats were anesthetized i.p. with ketamine and xylazine 2
weeks after MCAO. The brains were removed carefully and
dissected into coronal sections (2 mm thick). The fresh
brain slices were immersed in a 2% solution of 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma) in PBS at 37‚àò C
for 30 min. The cross-sectional area of each slice of infarcted
brain was measured using image analysis software (MetaMorph, PA, USA). The total infarct volume for each slice was
calculated by summation of infarcted areas of all brain slices.
The corrected infarct volume (CIV) was calculated as
CIV = [LT ‚àí (RT ‚àí RI)] √ó ùëë,

(1)

where LT is the area of the left hemisphere, RT is the area of
the right hemisphere, RI is the infarcted area, and ùëë is the slice
thickness (2 mm) [24].
2.7. Immunohistochemical Staining. Seven and 28 days after
stroke, experimental models were sacrificed for immunohistochemistry. Animals were intracardially perfused with
PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The excised
brains were postfixed overnight and then equilibrated in
30% sucrose solution for 1 day. Fixed brains were embedded,
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at ‚àí80‚àò C until
use. Tissues were cryosectioned to a 10 ùúám thickness. To
identify the BDNF level, the tissues were probed with an antiBDNF antibody (Chemicon). To evaluate the endogenous
cell proliferation and endogenous neurogenesis, tissues were
double stained with anti-BrdU (Serotec, Oxford, UK), antidoublecortin (DCX; Chemicon), and anti-NeuN (Chemicon)
antibodies. The immunoreactivity was visualized using Cy2conjugated anti-IgG (Jackson, West Grove, PA) or Alexa Fluor
488- or 633-conjugated anti-IgG (Invitrogen) secondary antibodies. Confocal images were obtained using a Zeiss laser
scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510 Meta, Carl Zeiss)
and Zeiss software.

At 14 days after stroke, coronal cryosections (10 ùúám
thick) from animals of each group were stained using the
terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay kit (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) and developed using Cy2-conjugated streptavidin
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Sections were
counterstained with 4Û∏Ä† ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI;
Sigma). The total number of TUNEL-positive cells and DAPI
counterstaining-positive cells was counted individually using
fluorescence microscopy in three slides from each brain, with
each slide containing three fields from the ischemic boundary
zone and one field from the ischemic core.
2.8. Statistical Analysis. All data are expressed as mean ¬± SD.
Statistical differences between test conditions were determined using Student‚Äôs ùë°-test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey‚Äôs
post hoc test. Significance was set at ùëÉ < 0.05.

3. Results
3.1. Detection of Immunoreactive Human BDNF and Quantitative Analysis In Vitro and In Vivo. The levels of BDNF
in the supernatant of cultured MSCs and MSCs transfected
with adenoviruses expressing human BDNF (MSCs-BDNF)
with PTD at an MOI of 3, 10, and 30 pfu/cell are shown
in Figure 1. Transfected MSCs secreted BDNF at a rate of
643.63, 7930.90, and 13229.09 pg/mL/48 h when infected at
an MOI of 3, 10, and 30, respectively. Nontransfected MSCs
also produced BDNF protein (72.72 pg/mL/48 h). The level of
BDNF production from MSCs-BDNF transfected at an MOI
of 30 was 180-fold greater than that of noninfected MSCs.
BDNF protein was diffusely overexpressed in the ipsilateral brain in the MSCs-BDNF group (Figure 2). A high
level of BDNF expression in the MSCs-BDNF group was
detected in the ipsilateral striatum 7 days after MCAO.
However, virtually no BDNF expression was detected on the
contralateral hemisphere (data not shown).
The levels of BDNF in brain tissues were measured using
sandwich ELISA 7 days after MCAO. BDNF levels increased
significantly in the ischemic hemisphere of the MSCs group
(16.66 ¬± 2.14 pg/mg) compared with the PBS group (8.78 ¬±
0.42 pg/mg). In the MSCs-BDNF group, BDNF increased in
the ischemic hemisphere (43.03¬±2.57 pg/mg) compared with
the PBS and MSCs groups (Figure 2(b)).
3.2. Therapeutic Effects of MSCs-BDNF in the Rat Stroke
Model. Numerous studies have reported that MSC treatment enhances poststroke recovery [1‚Äì3]. Similarly, systemic
BDNF treatment has been tailored to enhance poststroke
recovery, similar to sensorimotor function [15]. To evaluate
the therapeutic effects of MSCs-BDNF, 5 √ó 105 MSCs or
MSCs-BDNF were transplanted into the ischemic boundary
zone 3 days after MCAO.
The results of the adhesive-removal test were statistically
different between the PBS-treated group (control) and the
cell-treated groups (MSCs and MSCs-BDNF) (Figure 3(a)).
One day after cell transplantation, there were no significant
differences among the three groups. However, 14 days after

MCAO, significant differences were evident: MSCs-BDNF
(12.66 ¬± 5.36 s), MSCs (29 ¬± 3.75 s), and PBS (46.88 ¬± 8.87 s)
(ùëÉ < 0.05). Significant differences persisted on days 21 and
28. The MSCs-BDNF group showed the fastest recovery, and
the PBS group showed the slowest improvement (ùëÉ < 0.05).
The results of the rotarod stress test performed at the same
time did not reveal a significant difference until 21 days after
MCAO. However, 28 days after MCAO, the MSCs-BDNF
group displayed a significant improvement (95.4 ¬± 4.33%)
compared with the PBS group (79.9 ¬± 5.58%) and the MSCs
group (85.4 ¬± 2.47%) (ùëÉ < 0.05) (Figure 3(b)).
We compared the infarction areas in coronal sections
from animals of the PBS, MSCs, and MSCs-BDNF groups on
day 14 (Figure 3(c)). TTC staining was used to assess lesion
volume as a percentage of contralateral hemispheric volume.
14 days after MCAO, significant differences of %CIV were
detected in the MSCs-BDNF group compared with the MSCs
and PBS groups (22.94 ¬± 8.30% versus 41.28 ¬± 2.85% versus
53.86 ¬± 8.60%; ‚àó ùëÉ < 0.05, ‚àó‚àó ùëÉ < 0.01).
3.3. Enhanced Neurogenesis by MSCs-BDNF. Data obtained
in the present study were consistent with the notion that
MSCs promote endogenous neurogenesis in experimental
stroke models. We investigated whether transplantation of
MSCs-BDNF enhanced neurogenesis to a greater extent than

transplantation of MSCs alone. We found immunoreactivity
for the cells proliferation indicator BrdU and/or the migrating
neuroblast marker DCX in the SVZ.
Seven days after MCAO, a significant increase in the
number of BrdU+ cells in the SVZ of the MSCs group and
the MSCs-BDNF groups was evident, compared with the PBS
group (363.66 ¬± 47.00 versus 515.66 ¬± 21.51 versus 185.66 ¬±
40.91, ùëÉ < 0.05) (Figure 4(b)). The intensity of SVZ DCX+
immunoreactivity indicated that the MSCs-BDNF group was
much thicker and contained more DCX+ cells than that
of the MSCs and PBS groups. Integrated optical density
measurements of DCX+ cells showed that the MSCs-BDNF
group possessed the highest positive immunoreactivity (PBS:
42.57 ¬± 1.16, MSCs: 43.89 ¬± 1.31, and MSCs-BDNF: 47.435 ¬±
0.88, PBS versus MSCs: ùëÉ < 0.05, PBS versus MSCs-BDNF:
ùëÉ < 0.01, and MSCs versus MSCs-BDNF: ùëÉ < 0.05)
(Figure 4(c)). Moreover, the number of DCX/BrdU doublepositive cells increased robustly after stem cell transplantation (PBS: 20 ¬± 6.55, MSCs: 74.33 ¬± 13.31, and MSCs-BDNF:
122.66¬±22.50, PBS versus MSCs: ùëÉ < 0.01, PBS versus MSCsBDNF: ùëÉ < 0.01, MSCs versus MSCs-BDNF: ùëÉ < 0.05)
(Figure 4(d)).
Four weeks after MCAO, we determined the neuronal fraction among the new cells (BrdU+ /NeuN+ ) using
microscopy. Labeling with the mature neuron marker NeuN
showed that many cells were positive near the IBZ in

BDNF increased significantly in the ischemic hemisphere of animals in the MSCs and MSCs-BDNF groups compared with PBS-treated rats

animals of the MSCs-BDNF- and MSCs-transplanted groups
(Figure 4(e)). Compared with all other groups, the MSCsBDNF group displayed the highest prevalence of positive
double-labeled cells (PBS: 9.85 ¬± 0.29%, MSCs: 13.44 ¬± 1.48%,
and MSCs-BDNF: 20.65¬±3.80%; PBS versus MSCs: ùëÉ < 0.01,
PBS versus MSCs-BDNF: ùëÉ < 0.01, and MSCs versus MSCsBDNF: ùëÉ < 0.05) (Figure 4(f)).

(DAPI staining) were counted in the same area. In this area,
we did not accept donor MSCs (red fluorescence); therefore,
the cells counted seemed to be host derived. The percentage of
apoptotic host cells was significantly decreased in the MSCsBDNF group (9.85 ¬± 2.33%) compared with the PBS (31.32 ¬±
0.99%, ùëÉ < 0.01) and MSCs (17.71¬±3.88%, ùëÉ < 0.05) groups.
The difference between the latter two groups was significant
(ùëÉ < 0.01).

3.4. Antiapoptosis. Using TUNEL staining (Figure 5), apoptotic cells with green fluorescence were counted in the
ischemic boundary zone and ischemic core 2 weeks after
the ischemic injury. In addition, cells with blue fluorescence

correlated with enhanced proliferation of endogenous NSCs
in the SVZ and in the neuronal maturation of newborn
neuroblasts. The recovery was associated with reduction
in infarct volume, protection from apoptotic cell death,
improvement in behavioral performance, increased BDNF
levels in the infarcted cerebral hemisphere, and enhanced
endogenous neurogenesis.
MSCs can be isolated from many different adult tissues.
Numerous studies have reported beneficial effects of MSCs
in tissue repair and regeneration [25]. MSCs secrete a variety
of bioactive substances such as neurotrophins (e.g., NGF and

BDNF), interleukins, macrophage colony-stimulating factor,
and stem-cell factors [26]. In addition, MSCs home to and
engraft into injured tissues and modulate the inflammatory
response via synergistic downregulation of proinflammatory
cytokines and upregulation of both prosurvival and antiinflammatory factors [25]. Intracranial infusion of BDNF significantly reduces infarct volume after induction of cerebral
ischemia [27], and intravenous infusion of BDNF enhances
functional recovery and endogenous neurogenesis [15], suggesting that BDNF may protect cells from ischemic injury.
However, usually recombinant proteins activation is short

in vivo. The persistence of transgene expression in MSCs
transduced with adenovirus was analyzed in our previous
study. We found that the expression from MSCs inoculated
into experimental mice persisted for 14 days [22]. Therefore
we used BDNF gene expressed MSCs in this study. To
investigate the effect of BDNF on the neuroprotective and
endogenous neurogenesis action of transplanted MSCs in
MCAO, we compared the effects of MSCs with those of
MSCs-BDNF.
The BDNF gene was introduced into MSCs using a
recombinant replication-deficient adenoviral vector encoding BDNF (Ad-BDNF) with PTD. Elevated secretion of
BDNF protein in these cells compared with nontransgenic

MSCs was confirmed in vitro using ELISA. BDNF production
by MSCs-BDNF was 180-fold greater than that observed
in uninfected MSCs. BDNF levels assayed by ELISA in
the ischemic brain lesion increased after the transplantation of either MSCs or MSCs-BDNF. However, levels were
significantly higher in the latter, suggesting that MSCsBDNF can maintain high levels of BDNF during the critical
postischemic period, and that this elevated BDNF secretion
contributes to the enhanced neuroprotection and endogenous neurogenesis.
The present study showed improvement in behavioral
performance and reduction in infarct volume. We performed
an adhesive-removal test and a rotarod stress test. These

can be used to demonstrate behavioral therapeutic effects on
MCAO injured rats (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). We performed
statistical analysis using one-way ANOVA with Tukey‚Äôs post
hoc test. We measured infarction volume using the TTC
staining method. TTC measures the mitochondrial activity of
all cells. TTC staining results in viable tissues appearing in a
‚Äúbrick-red,‚Äù as the tetrazolium salts react with dehydrogenates
in the cells, whereas infarcted tissues stain a pale white, as
they lack the enzymes with which the TTC reacts. However,
some cells that infiltrate the infarct lesion can be stained. We
measured infarct size at 14 days after stroke. It makes some
concerned. This study showed therapeutic effects at least 14
days after stroke. Thus, we decided to use 14 days after stroke
as the time point for analysis. We compared the infarction
areas among the groups. The MSCs-BDNF group exhibited
the best recovery (Figure 3(d)).
Neurogenesis persists in the adult brain, where it may
contribute to repair and recovery after injury [8, 28]. Hence,
multipotent cells located in the hippocampus hilus and SVZ
of the lateral ventricle manifest as increased proliferation and
migration in pathological situations. Moreover, progenitor
cells such as migratory neuroblasts (doublecortin; DCX) that
migrate through the rostral migratory stream from the SVZ
to the olfactory bulb can be triggered to differentiate into
neurons [28, 29]. After ischemic injury, the SVZ expands
[30, 31] and proliferation of NSCs is accelerated during the
first 2 weeks compared with the normal brain [6]. The newly
generated DCX+ cells migrate toward the ischemic territory
[31].
The results of the present study are consistent with
observations that MSCs promote endogenous neurogenesis
in stroke models. Upregulation of BDNF levels has been
associated with recruitment of neural progenitors of the
forebrain [32]. We investigated whether the transplantation
of MSCs-BDNF enhances endogenous neurogenesis to a
greater extent compared with transplantation of MSCs alone.
Transplantation of MSCs-BDNF yielded the highest number
of BrdU+ and DCX+ cells in the SVZ 7 days after MCAO,
compared with rats transplanted only with MSCs or PBS
(Figure 4). These results indicate that the BrdU+ and DCX+
cells in the SVZ are derived from the host NSCs, and that
the density of these cells increases in response to the BDNF
secreted by MSCs-BDNF. In addition, cells that were positive
for both NeuN and BrdU in the ipsilateral lesion were
evident 4 weeks after MCAO (Figures 4(e) and 4(f)). BrdU
is commonly used for the detection of proliferating cells
in living tissues. BrdU was administered until 4 days after
cell transplantation. BrdU+ cells only proliferated after cell
transplantation. These findings are consistent with the view
that the therapeutic effects of MSCs-BDNF are associated
with the acceleration of proliferation maturation of NSCs
resident in the SVZ.

5. Conclusions
In conclusion, the transplantation of either MSCs or MSCsBDNF (transfected with the BDNF gene using an adenovirus
vector and PTD) resulted in reduced ischemic damage and

9
improved function in a rat MCAO model. Transplantation
of MSCs-BDNF was most efficacious. The transplantation of
MSCs or MSCs-BDNF affected the ischemic brain largely by
secreting neurotrophic factors. The transplantation of MSCsBDNF can enhance the protective effect by preventing apoptosis in the ischemic brain and by promoting the proliferation
of endogenous stem cells.
