Abstract: Recent investigations have postulated a link between oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction
in cerebral ischaemic ⁄ reperfusion (I ⁄ R) injury. Diabetes is common amongst elderly patients with stroke and has been postulated to aggravate brain I ⁄ R damage by triggering oxidative as well as ER stress. We investigated whether treatment with edaravone (1–10 mg ⁄ kg), a potent free radical scavenger protects against cerebral I ⁄ R injury in rats associated with comorbid
type 2 diabetes. Diabetic rats exposed to 2-hr middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and 22 hr of reperfusion significantly
had increased infarct, oedema volume and functional neurological deficits as compared to sham-operated rats. Also, the massive DNA fragmentation accompanied by significant increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick
end labelling (TUNEL) positive cells was noticed in the ipsilateral penumbral brain region of diabetic I ⁄ R rats. The effects of
I ⁄ R injury were associated with significant up-regulation of 78 kDa-glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), CCAAT ⁄enhancer
binding protein homologous protein or growth arrest DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (CHOP ⁄ GADD153) and activation
of caspase-12, markers of ER stress ⁄ apoptosis. Treatment with edaravone (3 and 10 mg ⁄ kg) significantly diminished the
cerebral infarct, oedema volume and improved functional recovery of neurological deficits. In addition, edaravone treatment
ameliorated the DNA fragmentation concomitantly with a significant decrease in induction of GRP78, CHOP ⁄ GADD153
immunoreactivity ⁄ expression and activation of caspase-12 in the ischaemic brain hemispheres. Overall, the present data
indicate that edaravone offers good neuroprotection against diabetic stroke by interrupting the ER stress-mediated apoptotic
pathways involving CHOP ⁄ GADD153 and caspase-12.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays an important role
in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischaemic ⁄ reperfusion (I ⁄ R)
injury and diabetes. Diabetes is a proven risk factor for
stroke, with a two to threefold increased risk for diabetic
patients compared with non-diabetic patients [1]. Further,
diabetes exacerbates brain ischaemic damage which has been
recently shown to be mediated via augmenting ER stress and
apoptosis [2]. The ER is a eukaryotic organelle involved in
protein synthesis, folding and trafficking, calcium homoeostasis and lipid and steroid synthesis. Perturbations of ER
homoeostasis because of certain stress stimuli such as ischaemia, nutrient deprivation, oxidative stress and ER Ca2+
depletion lead to accumulation of unfolded or misfolded
proteins within the lumen of ER, a condition known as ER
stress [3]. To alleviate this stress, ER triggers an evolutionarily conserved adaptive signalling cascade termed as the
unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is essentially
carried out by three ER-transmembrane effectors proteins:
the RNA-activated protein kinase-like ER-resident kinase
(PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE1) and activating
transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In the unstressed state,
PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 activity is suppressed by binding of

the ER chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) to
the ER-transmembrane effectors. In response to ER stress,
GRP78 dissociates and binds to the unfolded protein to
facilitate refolding; this allows the activation of PERK,
IRE1 and ATF6. The UPR includes translational attenuation, induction of molecular chaperones (GRP78) and ERassociated degradation. Overall, UPR activation can help
the cell to cope with the ER stress, but if it is severe or unresolved, the inflicted cells may undergo programmed cell
death [4].
The wealth of evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS) or oxidative stress plays a detrimental role in the
pathophysiology of cerebral I ⁄ R injury [5,6]. ROS robustly
generated during cerebral I ⁄ R are reported to induce ER
stress and apoptotic cell death [7]. Further, the studies with
transgenic animals over expressing superoxide dismutase-1
(SOD-1) revealed the reduced oxidative damage to ER and
ischaemic neuronal cell death [8,9]. Edaravone (3-methyl-1phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one) (EDR), a potent novel free radical
scavenger, has been approved only in Japan for the treatment
of acute ischaemic stroke and still under clinical investigation
in some countries [10]. EDR has been reported to reduce
brain infarction and oedema after I ⁄ R injury in animal models [11–13] as well as in stroke patients [10,14]. Experimental
evidence suggests that the possible mechanism of action of
EDR mainly encompasses decreasing oxidative stress ⁄ lipid
peroxidation, pro-inflammatory response and protecting

neurovascular tissues after ischaemic stress [12,15]. Interestingly, EDR has been shown to elicit neuroprotection by
inhibiting ER dysfunction in a mouse model of hypoxicischaemia under normoglycaemic conditions [16]. In addition
to these anti-stroke effects, EDR has also been tested against
oxidative damage to various extracerebral organs. Of note,
EDR exhibited protective effect against multiple low doses of
STZ-induced diabetes [17] and certain microvascular diabetic
complications [18].
Although the neuroprotective potential of EDR has been
investigated earlier, to our knowledge, there is no report that
describes neuroprotective effect of EDR in a rat model of
focal cerebral I ⁄ R injury associated with comorbid type 2
diabetes. In the present investigation, we tested whether
EDR would also be effective against diabetic stroke by suppressing the augmented ER stress ⁄ apoptotic cell death. This
study also bears significance in view of updated stroke therapy academic industry roundtable (STAIR, 2009) recommendation reinforcing that experiments shall also be performed
in animal models with comorbid conditions for more clinical
relevance and better translation of efficacy of test compounds from pre-clinical models to clinical trials [19].

Materials and Methods
Animals. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (120–140 g) were procured from
the central animal facility of the institute. The rats were fed regular
pellet feed (Ashirwad Industries, Chandigarh) and potable water ad
libitum. The experiments were duly permitted by the institutional
animal ethics committee (IAEC), NIPER and performed in accordance with guidelines of the committee for the purpose of control
and supervision of experiments on animals (CPCSEA), Government
of India.
Induction of type 2 diabetes in rats. The induction of type 2 diabetes
was carried out in rats by combination of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding and low dose of streptozotocin (STZ; Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA) treatment as previously described [20]. Briefly, the rats were
fed with HFD for 2 weeks and then rendered diabetic by a single
low dose of STZ (35 mg ⁄ kg, i.p.) treatment. Blood samples were collected initially and at the end of 4 weeks. The various biochemical
parameters such as plasma glucose, triglycerides and total cholesterol
levels were measured using commercially available colorimetric kits
(Accurex India Pvt Ltd, Mumbai, India). Plasma insulin was determined using an ELISA kit (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO, USA).
Only those rats with plasma glucose level of >300 mg ⁄ dl at the end
of 4 week were considered diabetic and included in the study.
Induction of focal cerebral ischaemia in diabetic rats. The rats were
randomly assigned to the following experimental groups, namely 1)
diabetic sham 2) diabetic I ⁄ R + Vehicle 3) diabetic I ⁄ R + EDR (1,
3 and 10 mg ⁄ kg) treated. Focal cerebral ischaemia was induced in
diabetic rats as per the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
method as previously described [21]. Briefly, these type 2 diabetic rats
were priorly administered with atropine sulphate (0.5 mg ⁄ kg, i.p.)
before induction of anaesthesia with 4% halothane in a mixture of
70% nitrous oxide and 30% oxygen. Anaesthesia was maintained by
administering 1% halothane using an anaesthesia system (Harvard
Apparatus Ltd, Eden Bridge, Kent, UK). Occlusion was performed
using a 3 ⁄ 0 nylon monofilament coated with 0.01% poly-L-lysine
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) which was advanced up to 21 mm as
the distance from bifurcation or till the resistance was felt through
the lumen of the external carotid artery into the internal carotid
artery to block the origin of the right middle cerebral artery. Occlu-

sion was performed for a period of 2 hr followed by 22 hr of reperfusion by complete withdrawal of filament. After 22 hr of reperfusion,
the rats were evaluated for certain neurological functional deficits,
cerebral infarct and oedema volume. In the sham-operated group,
only the filament was introduced into the external carotid artery but
not advanced. Rectal temperature was continuously monitored and
maintained at 37.0 € 0.5C using a feedback-controlled homoeothermic blanket system (Harvard Apparatus, Eden Bridge, Kent, UK).
The anaesthetic gaseous mixtures were fine-adjusted to reach the
vital physiological parameters such as pO2 (110–145 mm Hg), pCO2
(30–45 mmHg) and pH (7.3–7.5) close to physiological limits and
maintained before, during MCAO and reperfusion [22].
Drug preparation and treatment. EDR (Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville,
MO, USA) (1, 3 and 10 mg ⁄ kg), a potent free radical scavenger, was
dissolved in 1 N NaOH solution and neutralized with 1 N HCl to
adjust the pH to 7.4 at the dose volume of 2 ml ⁄ kg. EDR was
administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) immediately (within 2 min.) after
the MCAO. The doses of EDR were selected based on a literature
report [16]. The neuroprotective potential of EDR was evaluated
from both histological and functional neurological studies after
22 hr of reperfusion as described below as compared to vehicle treatment.
Assessment of functional neurological deficits. The neurological deficits were evaluated after 22 hr of reperfusion as reported earlier [21].
Neurological findings were scored on a five-point scale. No neurological deficit = 0, failure to extend right paw fully = 1, circling if pulled
by tail = 2, spontaneous circling = 3 did not walk spontaneously
and had depressed level of consciousness = 4.
Estimation of brain infarct and oedema volume. The rats were killed
22 hr after reperfusion for the estimation of brain infarct and
oedema volume. The brains were sliced into 2 mm thick coronal sections and stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)
solution, and the area of infarction and oedema volume was measured using image analysis software (Leica Qwin, Wetzlar, Germany)
as reported earlier [23]. Briefly, the infarct areas of all brain sections
were cumulated to reach total infarct area that was multiplied by the
thickness of brain sections to reach the volume of infarction.
Oedema correction of infarct volume was performed using the
formula, volume correction = (infarct volume · contralateral
volume) ⁄ ipsilateral volume. The volumes of both hemispheres were
calculated from which the oedema volume was derived by subtracting the contralateral volume from the ipsilateral volume.
Estimation of DNA fragmentation. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay was
carried out to identify the extent of DNA fragmentation in paraffinembedded brain section as described previously [23]. The 3¢ end of
the fragmented DNA was labelled using the DNA fragmentation
detection kit – TdT-FragEL according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Merck, USA). The TUNEL positive cells were counted from
the penumbral region of the brain sections and expressed as percentage of TUNEL positive cells compared with total cells.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis for
the in situ expression of various ER stress proteins such as GRP78
and CHOP ⁄ GADD153 was performed as previously described using
Vecta stain ABC kit (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA) [24]. The
specific labelling was detected using diaminobenzidine as a substrate.
The sections were counterstained with haematoxylin and observed
under light microscope (Leica) over ipsilateral penumbral region,
and images were acquired with a CCD camera (Leica). As GRP78 is
a constitutive protein, the immunoreactivity was measured based on
immunohistochemical scoring pattern. IHC scoring was carried out
based on the intensity of staining as follows: 1 – slight or no colour;
2 – very low staining; 3 – moderate staining; and 4 – very intense
staining. However, CHOP ⁄ GADD153 is an inducible protein that is

Western blotting. Western blotting was performed as described previously [25]. For western blotting analysis, aliquots containing equal
amount of protein were loaded in each well and subjected to 10–12%
SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 2 hr.
The membranes were then probed for GRP78 or caspase-12 protein
by incubating with the primary antibodies such as GRP78 (1:500,
Santa Cruz Biotech. Inc., Santa Cruz, USA) or caspase-12 (1:1000;
Cell Signaling, Davers, MA, USA) followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated secondary antibody (1: 5000,
Sigma, USA) for 2 hr at room temperature. Blots were visualized by
enzymatic reaction by incubating with a mixture of 5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) and nitro blue tetrazolium at
room temperature. Equal protein loading was confirmed by measuring b- actin. The densitometric analysis was performed using NIH
ImageJ analysis software. The values were normalized with b- actin.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using the
statistical analysis software Sigma Stat 2.0, USA. Data are presented
as mean € SEM unless otherwise stated. All the parameters except

Results
Experiment 1: Effect of HFD ⁄ STZ on body weight and
biochemical parameters in rats.
The feeding of HFD and STZ injection in rats produced typical characteristics of type 2 diabetic conditions associated
with significant increase in plasma glucose, triglyceride and
total cholesterol levels. The effects were seen without significant reduction in plasma insulin levels as well as body weight
compared with normal control rats at the end of 4 weeks
(table 1).
Experiment 2: Effect of EDR on histological and functional
outcome measures.
After I ⁄ R injury, the diabetic rats exhibited significantly
larger brain infarct and oedema volume when compared with
the sham-operated diabetic rats (fig. 1). The single-dose
treatment with EDR (3 and 10 mg ⁄ kg) produced a significant reduction in brain infarct and oedema volume. However, low dose of EDR (1 mg ⁄ kg) did not significantly alter
neurological damage (fig. 1). In addition, monitoring of the
vital physiological parameters revealed that EDR treatment
elicited no significant change in body temperature as well as
blood glucose level as compared to vehicle treatment (data
not shown).
Further, based upon functional assessment, the diabetic
rats subjected to I ⁄ R manifested significant impairment in
neurological score. Treatment with EDR (3 and 10 mg ⁄ kg)
significantly improved functional recovery of neurological
deficits, as reflected from reduction in neurological score

EDR (10 mg ⁄ kg) significantly attenuated DNA fragmentation in ipsilateral penumbral region (fig. 3). However, we
rarely detected any TUNEL positive cells in the contralateral
region of the brain (data not shown).
Experiment 4: Effect of EDR on GRP78 and

The results from the immunohistochemistry experiments
revealed a significant increase in the immunoreactivity of ER

in the ischaemic penumbral region of the diabetic I ⁄ R rats
compared with the sham-operated rats. Nevertheless, the
treatment with EDR (10 mg ⁄ kg) resulted in a significant
reduction in GRP78 and CHOP ⁄ GADD153 immunoreactivity as reflected from decreased IHC score and percent
CHOP ⁄ GADD153 positive cells, respectively, compared with
vehicle treatment (fig. 4).
Experiment 5: Effect of EDR on GRP78 and capsase-12
expression.
Consistent with IHC results, western blot analysis also substantiated the similar pattern of GRP78 protein expression
in the various groups (fig. 5). In addition, the diabetic rats
exposed to I ⁄ R showed significant activation of caspase-12
associated with pronounced reduction in the level in the
ischaemic, ipsilateral brain hemispheres after 22 hr of reperfusion. On the other hand, EDR treatment (10 mg ⁄ kg)
significantly replenished caspase-12 level, possibly by inhibiting its activation as compared to vehicle treatment
(fig. 5).

Discussion
In the present study, we have demonstrated that EDR offers
neuroprotection in experimental diabetic stroke through
reducing ER stress and apoptotic DNA fragmentation.
Growing evidence suggests the involvement of ER stress in
various neurodegenerative (cerebral ischaemia) and metabolic disorders (obesity, diabetes and atherosclerosis) and

further targeting ER function could provide future therapeutic opportunities [26,27]. However, the availability of agents
specifically targeting ER stress pathways is very limited for
laboratory investigation. Nevertheless, two therapeutic strategies have been mainly relied to target ER stress. Firstly, therapeutic interventions could be targeted against suppressing
the pathological process leading to functional ER impairment and secondly facilitating the folding of unfolded

proteins so that it restores ER function and protects cells
from irreversible cell damage [27]. The major pathological
process resulting in ER stress in various acute disorders
including cerebral ischaemia is oxidative disorder caused by
a rise in ROS to levels exceeding antioxidant defence. Oxygen free radicals produced inside and outside the ER lumen
perturb ER function and result in the accumulation of
unfolded proteins and the induction of apoptosis as investigated in ischaemic brain [9]. The study also demonstrated
that the rats over expressing SOD1, ischaemia-induced ER
dysfunction were indeed markedly suppressed [9]. Thus, it
appears that drugs having antioxidant activity could be used
to decrease or block ROS-induced impairment of ER functioning. Therefore, we decided to use and evaluate the neuroprotective potential of EDR, potent free radical scavenger
against focal cerebral ischaemia associated with comorbid
type 2 diabetic conditions, an animal model that mimics
human stroke. The HFD ⁄ STZ type 2 diabetic rat model used
in the study replicates the natural history and the characteristic features of human type 2 diabetes viz. hyperglycaemia,
hyperlipidaemia and hypercholesterolaemia under normal or
slightly elevated absolute circulating insulin concentration
(relative insulin deficiency) as compared to normal control
rats which is compatible with our earlier results [20].
Upon exposure to I ⁄ R, the diabetic rats developed greater
neurological damage and impairment in neurological functions which is consistent with earlier reports [2,28,29]. On the
other hand, treatment with EDR not only produced significant inhibition of cerebral infarct and oedema volume but
also improved functional recovery of neurological deficits signifying its potent neuroprotective activity in diabetic stroke as
well. This result is in agreement with previous reports of
EDR on cerebral ischaemia under normoglycaemic conditions [16]. The neuroprotective effect of EDR was further evidenced from reduction in TUNEL positive cells in the
ipsilateral penumbral region of the brain as compared to the
vehicle-treated rats. TUNEL positive cells are indices of
DNA fragmentation ⁄ apoptosis that is predominantly responsible for neurological damage in the ischaemic penumbral
region [30]. We next examined whether neuroprotective effects
of EDR were because of amelioration of ER stress by analysing respective molecular biomarkers viz. GRP78, CHOP ⁄
GADD153 and caspase-12, after 22 hr of reperfusion in the
brains of the various groups. Up-regulation of the ER-resident chaperone, GRP78 is a hallmark of adaptive UPR and
has been commonly used as a marker of ER stress [31]. The
expression of GRP78 remained significantly elevated even
after 22 hr of reperfusion indicating the involvement of prolonged ER stress as compared to the sham-operated rats. This
finding is in agreement with brain ischaemia under normoglycaemic conditions [32]. Despite the increase in protective
GRP78 chaperone levels, marked apoptotic DNA fragmentation was strikingly evident at 22 hr after reperfusion. As the
stress was too severe and prolonged, the compensatory UPR
so noticed with up-regulation of GRP78 might have appeared
to be relatively insufficient and unsuccessful to cope with augmented ER stress and protect the cells dying from apoptosis

in the vehicle-treated I ⁄ R rats [2]. The latter ER stressinduced apoptosis has been shown to involve induction of
CHOP ⁄ GADD153 as well as activation of caspase-12-specific
mediators of ER stress-associated cell death. We observed an
increase in expression or immunoreactivity of proapoptotic
transcription factor CHOP ⁄ GADD153 and marked activation of caspase-12 which is in agreement with earlier reports
on normoglycaemic as well as diabetic stroke models
[2,33,34].
The cells under unstressed state express only very low level
of CHOP ⁄ GADD153 which becomes markedly elevated in
response to ER stress through transcriptional induction.
Although a precise mechanism by which CHOP ⁄ GADD153
mediates apoptosis is unknown, CHOP ⁄ GADD153 is
reported to activate transcription of numerous cell death
genes including Gadd34, Ero1, Bim and Trb3 and suppression
of anti-apototic Bcl-2 protein. Further, CHOP ⁄ GADD153 - ⁄ cells and mice have been shown to be protected from ER
stress-induced apoptosis, whereas CHOP ⁄ GADD153 over
expression resulted in increased apoptosis [4]. Likewise, caspase-12-deficient mice are also found to be resistant to ER
stress-induced apoptosis [35]. Caspase-12 is an ER-resident
pro-caspase that is proteolysed or activated in response to ER
stress conditions, releasing active cleaved fragments which in
turn are responsible for downstream intrinsic apoptosis signalling eventually resulting in DNA fragmentation [36]. On
the other hand, treatment with EDR significantly inhibited
the induction of CHOP ⁄ GADD153 as well as activation of
caspase-12 in parallel with reduced apoptosis. These findings
suggest that EDR treatment might probably share a common
mechanism in ameliorating ER stress in this diabetic stroke
model as observed with deletion of CHOP ⁄ GADD153 or
deficiency of caspase-12.
It has been postulated that ROS generated during I ⁄ R
could accelerate protein misfolding in ER lumen by oxidizing
amino acids in folding proteins or modifying endogenous
chaperones functions or damaging ER-resident proteins both
directly or indirectly through formation of peroxidated lipid
or peroxynitrite [8,37]. The ability of the antioxidative stress
response to combat ROS accumulation and protein misfolding may be especially important for function and survival of
cells [38]. We thus speculate that EDR, being a potent free
radical scavenger, might have significantly quenched ROS
production and subsequently reduced the formation and
accumulation of ROS-induced misfolded proteins within ER
lumen following I ⁄ R. These alleviative effects of EDR
against protein misfolding might have finally reduced the
activation of downstream apoptotic signalling pathways
involving CHOP ⁄ GADD153 and caspase-12. Of further
note, the neuroprotective potential of EDR in this diabetic
stroke model was found independent of its effect on blood
sugar level and body temperature, thereby excluding the factors of hypothermia or hypoglycaemia underlying its
neuroprotection. However, it remains to be determined
whether the inhibition of ER stress response associated with
antioxidant treatment is specific to EDR only or a common
mechanism to all other antioxidants.

EDARAVONE OFFERS NEUROPROTECTION IN A DIABETIC STROKE MODEL

Conclusions
Taken together, these experimental findings demonstrate the
potent neuroprotective potential of EDR in a rat model of
diabetic stroke. The effect is likely to result from the
inhibition of ER stress and apoptotic DNA fragmentation
involving CHOP ⁄ GADD153 and caspase-12. Further, the
data obtained from the present study as well as from
previous studies may pave the way for future clinical
investigations aimed at exploring therapeutic benefits of
EDR not only against cerebral I ⁄ R damage but also
concomitantly against underlying diabetes-induced oxidative
tissue damage ⁄ complication in diabetic stroke subjects.
