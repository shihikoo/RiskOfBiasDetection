Melatonin improves neuroplasticity by upregulating the growthassociated protein-43 (GAP-43) and NMDAR postsynaptic density95 (PSD-95) proteins in cultured neurons exposed to glutamate
excitotoxicity and in rats subjected to transient focal cerebral
ischemia even during a long-term recovery period
Abstract: Recent evidence shows that the NMDAR postsynaptic density-95
(PSD-95), growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43), and matrix
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) protein enhance neuroplasticity at the subacute
stage of stroke. Here, we evaluated whether melatonin would modulate the
PSD-95, GAP-43, and MMP-9 proteins in cultured neurons exposed to
glutamate excitotoxicity and in rats subjected to experimental stroke. Adult
male Sprague–Dawley rats were treated with melatonin (5 mg/kg) or vehicle at
reperfusion onset after transient occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery
(tMCAO) for 90 min. Animals were euthanized for Western immunoblot
analyses for the PSD-95 and GAP-43 proteins and gelatin zymography for the
MMP-9 activity at 7 days postinsult. Another set of animals was sacriﬁced for
histologic and Golgi–Cox-impregnated sections at 28 days postinsult. In
cultured neurons exposed to glutamate excitotoxicity, melatonin signiﬁcantly
upregulated the GAP-43 and PSD-95 expressions and improved dendritic
aborizations (P < 0.05, respectively). Relative to controls, melatonin-treated
stroke animals caused a signiﬁcant improvement in GAP-43 and PSD-95
expressions as well as the MMP-9 activity in the ischemic brain (P < 0.05).
Consequently, melatonin also signiﬁcantly promoted the dendritic spine
density and reduced infarction in the ischemic brain, and improved
neurobehaviors as well at 28 days postinsult (P < 0.05, respectively). Together,
melatonin upregulates GAP-43, PSD-95, and MMP-9 proteins, which likely
accounts for its actions to improve neuroplasticity in cultured neurons exposed
to glutamate excitotoxicity and to enhance long-term neuroprotection,
neuroplasticity, and brain remodeling in stroke rats.

Introduction
Current treatment modality for ischemic stroke is still conﬁned to thrombolysis administration that beneﬁts only a
small proportion of stroke patients at the acute stage [1].
There is an urgent need to rectify the current thrombolytic
strategy so as to improve clinical outcome of stroke
patients at the subacute and chronic stages of recovery
[2–8]. Thus, functional deﬁcits caused by ischemic stroke
may be restored either by enhancing the rewiring process
of the damaged brain tissues or by decreasing the remote
injury that occurs distal to the ischemic territory. Moreover, functional deﬁcits may be replaced or compensated
for by de novo neurogenesis or using other intact brain
tissues. Strategies that have the potential to modulate neuroplasticity and/or neurogenesis, in addition to the neuroprotective ability to reduce acute brain damage, have
therefore been suggested by us and others to improve
current stroke treatment [4–6, 8].

Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of
matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) protein and NMDAtype glutamate receptors (NMDAR) in synaptic plasticity
and brain remodeling following stroke [9–13]. At an early
stage of stroke, activated and overexpressed matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) induce endothelial and extracellular
matrix (ECM) damage, leading to transmigration of
inﬂammatory cells and large, toxic molecules into the
brain parenchyma [14–16]. Conversely, MMPs enzymes
also played essential roles in the neuroplasticity and brain
remodeling at the subacute stage of stroke. In particular,
the MMP-mediated proteolysis is essential for regulating
synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis at the subacute and
late healing stages following stroke [11, 17–19].
The NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDAR) mediate both trophic and excitotoxic signaling in CNS neurons
[12, 13, 20–22]. Inhibitors of the NMDAR postsynaptic
density-95 (PSD-95) within 3 hr postinsult reduced brain
damage following permanent or transient focal cerebral
213

ischemia [22]. A major pathway of NMDAR signaling to
cell death in cortical and hippocampal neurons requires
the scaﬀolding protein PSD-95 and activation of neuronal
nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) [23]. Neuronal protection
mediated by PSD-95, thus, correlates well with reduced
activation of nNOS. Accordingly, MMPs and PSD-95 are
thought to be essential proteins for the ECM remodeling
and synaptic plasticity cascades, although each protein virtually has shown a Janus face of either toxic or neuronal
plasticity/trophic eﬀects depending on diﬀerent time
course and/or molecular basis of injury.
The 43-kDa growth-associated protein (GAP-43) is a
nervous tissue-speciﬁc protein that is synthesized at high
levels during axonal growth in neuronal development and
axonal regrowth in regeneration in the peripheral and
central nervous systems [14–26]. GAP-43, therefore, represents an important marker for axonal regeneration and
sprouting.
We and several other investigators have previously demonstrated that melatonin is highly eﬀective in reducing
acute ischemic brain damage [8, 14, 15, 27–29]. We used
melatonin, primarily because the agent and its metabolites
are potent, blood-brain barrier-permeable antioxidants,
and radical scavengers [30–34]. Thus, melatonin protects
the brain against acute ischemic damage to both gray and
white matter, ECM, blood-brain barrier permeability, and
functional neurovascular unit [14, 15, 27, 35–38]. More
recently, we have shown that melatonin improved the dendritic spine density and the somatosensory ﬁeld potentials
of the ischemic brain at the subacute stage of insult, and
this was associated with an elevated level of SNAP-25, but
not synaptophysin (marker of synaptogenesis), protein
expression [8]. Whereas melatonin has been shown to confer some presynaptic and dendritic neuroplasticity at a
subacute stage of an ischemic insult, there is still a need to
further clarify whether melatonin oﬀers neuroplasticity at
the postsynaptic, axonal sprouting and ECM signaling
cascades. In particular, we presumed that melatonin and
its active metabolites function to inhibit nNOS activity
[38–41] and therefore might be suited to enhance the PSD95-mediated synaptic plasticity. It was also important to
determine whether melatonin-induced neuroplasticity
remains eﬀectively during a long-lasting recovery period.
In the current study, we therefore examined whether
melatonin reduces brain infarct volumes and dendritic
spine damage as well as improves the postsynaptic plasticity, axonal sprouting, and ECM remodeling during a longterm recovery after transient focal cerebral ischemia in
rats. In addition, we explored possible contributions of the
melatonin-mediated neuroplasticity in cultured neurons
exposed to glutamate excitotoxicity.

Materials and methods
All procedures performed were approved by the Subcommittee on Research Animal Care of the University Medical
Center. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Co. (St Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise indicated. Melatonin was dissolved in polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400,
Sigma-Aldrich) or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, SigmaAldrich).

Neuronal cultures, glutamate-induced excitotoxicity,
and assay for dendritic aborizations
Based on a method described previously [36, 42], cultured
neurons were obtained from cerebral cortices of 1-day-old
Sprague–Dawley rats. Experiments were undertaken on
cultured neurons between 7 and 10 days in vitro (DIV).
Neurons were incubated melatonin (20–100 lM) or vehicle
(0.1% DMSO). Cultured neurons (n = 10–14) were pretreated with melatonin (20–100 lM) or vehicle (0. 1%
DMSO) for 30 min, and then, they were exposed to glutamate (300 lM) for 48 hr. Thereafter, neurons were
co-incubated with mouse primary monoclonal antibodies
antimicrotubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2; dilution
1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA)
antibody. Anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody conjugated
with biotin (1:100, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc., West
Grove, PA, USA) was then added, followed by ﬂuorescein
(DTAF)-conjugated streptavidin (1:150, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Neurons were co-incubated with 4’,-6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 2 lM, Sigma-Aldrich).
Fluorescence was assessed at excitation 365 nm and emission >420 nm for DAPI and was at excitation 450–490 nm
and emission >515 nm for DTAF detection. Dendritic
aborizations (length and branching) of the immunostained
neurons were determined using a microscope (Olympus
IX71, Olympus Optical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) equipped
with epiﬂuorescence and a computerized image analyzer
(Image Pro plus 5.1, Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring,
MD, USA).
Animal preparation, anesthesia, and monitoring
Male Sprague–Dawley rats, weighing 240–290 g, were supplied by the University Laboratory Animal Center and
were allowed free access to food and water. Animals were
anesthetized with 1–2% halothane in 70% N2O/30% O2.
During surgery, body temperature was maintained at
37.0  0.5°C, which corresponded to brain temperature of
37.2  0.5°C [43], using a thermostatically controlled
heating blanket and rectal probe (Harvard Apparatus,
South Natick, MA, USA). The right femoral artery was
cannulated for measuring arterial blood gases, glucose,
hematocrit, and blood pressure.
Experimental model and grouping
Focal cerebral ischemia was employed by intra-arterial
suture occlusion of the proximal right middle cerebral
artery (MCA) for 90 min, as described previously [8, 14,
27, 36, 43–45]. Laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (LDF, Laserﬂo
BMP2, Vasamedics, St. Paul, MN, USA) was used for
local cortical blood perfusion (LCBF) measurements, and
the data of LCBF were expressed as a percentage of the
baseline values.
Melatonin (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in a mixture
of PEG 400 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.9% normal saline (3:7,
vol./vol.). A dose of melatonin of 5 mg/kg was chosen
based on the pharmacokinetic study of exogenous melatonin in animal models [46] and the neuroprotective
dose–response studies of melatonin in experimental stoke

Melatonin enhanced postinsult neuroplasticity
[36–39]. In a randomized fashion, animals were given
intravenously either melatonin at 5 mg/kg (n = 39) or
vehicle (PEG-saline, n = 40) at the initiation time of reperfusion (i.e., 90 min after the onset of ischemia). In the ﬁrst
series of experiments, animals treated either with melatonin (5 mg/kg, n = 10) or vehicle (PEG-saline, n = 10) were
assigned for evaluating brain infarction and neuronal
damage and were euthanized after 28 days following the
ischemic insult (Day 28). In the second set of experiments,
animals treated either with melatonin (5 mg/kg, n = 17) or
vehicle (n = 18) were assigned to assess the dendritic spine
density by the Golgi–Cox staining at Day 1 and Day 28
(n = 8 for both groups, respectively). The third series of
animals, received melatonin (5 mg/kg, n = 12) or vehicle
(n = 12) upon reperfusion, were assigned to evaluate the
synaptic integrity by Western blotting and the ECM
remodeling by zymography at Day 7. Additional 16
animals which received a sham-operated procedure served
as the nonischemic controls.
Animal sacrifice and histologic outcome measure
Sacriﬁce was performed under anesthesia by decapitation
after transcardial perfusion with normal saline at Day 28.
By the method described previously [8, 14, 36, 44, 45], the
brains were quickly removed and sectioned coronally,
followed by the staining of 0.5% cresyl violet. Brain
infarction volumes were measured using a computerized
image analyzer (MCID Elite, Imaging Research Inc.,
Ontario, Canada) and were expressed as a percentage of
the contralateral hemisphere volume [8, 14, 36]. In addition, individual cortical and subcortical (caudoputaminal
and hippocampal) infarct sizes and surviving neurons were
separately calculated.
Golgi–Cox analysis
At Day 1 or Day 28, animals were sacriﬁced, and the
brains were rapidly removed and immersed in a modiﬁed
Golgi–Cox solution for 14 days and, then, in 30%
sucrose solution for another 5 days [8]. Coronal brain
sections of 200 lm were harvested using a vibratome
(VSLM1 motorized Vibroslice, Campden Instrument,
Silbey, UK), mounted, and stained. The spine density of
the second- and third-order basilar dendrites of the pyramidal neurons at regions corresponding to the ischemic
core (layer II–III), the inner (layer III–IV), and the outer
(layer V–VI) boundary zones of the forepaw and the
hindpaw areas of the ischemic hemisphere, as well as at
the layer V–VI region of the contralateral, intact brain,
was quantiﬁed and traced at 1000 magniﬁcation by a
Zeiss Axioskop 2 Mot ﬂuorescent microscope equipped
with an Axiocam high-resolution camera and AxioVision
image analysis system (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany).
Western blot analysis
Samples were obtained from cultured neurons and from
brain tissues of the ischemic core and penumbral regions,
which were quickly dissected on dry ice after the animal

were sacriﬁced. Based on the changes measured in LCBF,
we deﬁned an imaginary line, which was parallel to the
superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and 3.0 mm lateral to the
bregma, to divide the superior limb of the penumbral (left
side to the line) and the ischemic core (right side to the
line) cortices in the ischemic brain [8]. Cortical dissection
was continued between the rhinal ﬁssure and the lateral
olfactory tract. The inferior margin of ischemic core was
deﬁned as the cortical brain tissues located superiorly to
the level of the rhinal ﬁssure.
Samples were homogenized in lysis buﬀer, containing
1% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM
NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, and
were centrifuged at 18,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. Protein
concentrations of each sample were determined with a
BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).
Cell lysates of 25 lg protein were separated by 10%
sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE)
and were transferred onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
(PVDF) microporous membranes (IPVH00010, Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA) [8, 45]. Membranes were blocked
with 5% milk, then probed with primary antibodies
against GAP-43 and PSD-95 (1:10,000 and 1:1000; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA), and ﬁnally
incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated immunoglobulin (1:5000; Chemicon International) [8, 45].
Bound antibody was visualized with the Amersham ECL
system (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway,
NJ, USA). Membranes were then probed for actin
(1:10,000; Chemicon International). Optical densities were
measured using a Luminescent Image Analyzer (Fujiﬁlm
LAS-3000; Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan).
Gelatin zymography
Brain tissues were homogenized and centrifuged by the
method described previously [14–16]. Gelatinase activity in
the supernatants was extracted and puriﬁed with gelatinSepharose 4B (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ, USA) [14, 15]. Samples normalized for protein
concentration were mixed with sample buﬀer and loaded
onto 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)–polyacrylamide
gel containing 1.25 mg/mL gelatin. After electrophoresis,
the gel was washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 buﬀer for
three times. The gel was incubated in 100 mL of 50 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 5 mM CaCl2, 200 mM NaCl,
and 0.2% Brij 35 at 37°C overnight. Gel was stained with
0.25% Coomassie blue R-250 (Sigma-Aldrich) and
destained appropriately.
Neurobehavioral testing and body weight
measurements
Body weight measurement was taken daily. A battery of
sensory-motor tests was conducted prior to and on a daily
basis after reperfusion by two observers unaware of treatment protocol. Brieﬂy, two neurologic grading systems
were used: (i) a sensorimotor grading scale modiﬁed from
previously published methods [8, 14, 29, 36, 44, 45, 47], (ii)
a grading scale of 0–28 developed by Clark et al. [44, 45,
48].

Statistical analysis
All data were expressed as the mean standard error of
the mean (S.E.M.). Neurobehavioral scores and the dendritic spine densities were analyzed by Mann–Whitney
U-test. Paired Student’s t-test was used to evaluate the
response to a change in conditions, and unpaired Student’s
t-test/one-way ANOVA with Fisher’s protected least signiﬁcant diﬀerence (LSD) post hoc comparison was used to
evaluate diﬀerences between groups. P < 0.05 was selected
for statistical signiﬁcance.

Results
At 10-DIV cultured neurons, the addition of glutamate
(300 lM) induced signiﬁcant reductions in the dendritic
lengths and branches by 43.5% and 43.6%, respectively
(n = 10–14; P < 0.05; Fig. 1), relative to sham treatment,
cultured neurons. Melatonin (20–100 lM), however, exhibited a neuroplasticity response by improving the dendritic
lengths and branches by 56.7–84.0 and 53.9–78.2%,
respectively, compared with the control-treated neurons
exposed to glutamate excitotoxicity (P < 0.05; Fig. 1).
Additionally, melatonin (n = 6) improved the expressions
of the GAP-43 and PSD-95 proteins by 116.4% and

45.0%, compared with controls (n = 6; P < 0.05, respectively; Fig. 2A,B).
Seven animals (10.1%) died prior to completing the
recovery protocol and were excluded: Five were in the
vehicle-injected group, and two was in the melatonin-treated group. Relative to controls, melatonin did not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the LCBF either at the ischemic core and the
penumbral regions, or at the contralateral cortical brain,
as assessed before and within 40 min after treatment
(P > 0.05; data not shown). The other physiologic parameters of the animals were kept within normal physiologic
limits during the course of experiments and did not diﬀer
signiﬁcantly between melatonin-treated animals and vehicle-injected controls (P > 0.05; data not shown).
Brain infarction was reduced by 35.3% (P < 0.05) in
the melatonin-treated animals (n = 9; Fig. 3), when compared with controls (n = 7), following a recovery period of
28 days. This reﬂected the melatonin-mediated reductions
in cortical and subcortical infarct sizes by 36.9 and 30.0%
(P < 0.05, respectively; Fig. 3) and increases in the numbers of the surviving neurons in the penumbral cortex and
caudoputamen by 246.7 and 289.2% (P < 0.001, respectively; Fig. 3). Additionally, melatonin signiﬁcantly
improved sensory, motor, and the 28-point neurologic
scores, but not the loss of body weight, taken at 1–28 days

with controls.
Intravenous injection of melatonin (n = 6) at 5 mg/kg
eﬀectively improved the activity of the pro- and MMP-9
at penumbral cortical zones (Fig. 4A–C) by 24.0 and
15.0% (P < 0.05, respectively), compared with controls
(n = 6). Melatonin, however, did not aﬀect the levels of
the pro- and MMP-9 activity at the ischemic core
(P > 0.05). Melatonin also did not aﬀect the activity of
MMP-2 either at the ischemic core and the penumbral cortical zones, but enhanced the MMP-2 activity by 22.6% at
the contralateral intact brain (Fig. 4A,D; P < 0.05).
Cerebral ischemia–reperfusion insult induced prolonged
reductions in the expressions of the PSD-95 and GAP-43
at the ischemic core and the penumbral cortical zones
(P < 0.05, respectively; Fig. 5A–D). Melatonin-treated
animals (n = 6), however, had a signiﬁcantly improved
protein levels of the GAP-43 at the ischemic core and the
penumbral cortical zones (P < 0.05, respectively; Fig. 5A,

B), compared with vehicle-treated controls (n = 6). Melatonin also signiﬁcantly improved the expressions of PSD95 at the penumbral cortical zones (P < 0.05; Fig. 5D),
but did not aﬀected the PSD-95 levels at the ischemic core
regions (P > 0.05; Fig. 5C).
At Day 1 and Day 28, vehicle-treated controls had a signiﬁcantly lower branches and density of the second- and
third-order basilar dendrites of the pyramidal neurons at
the ischemic core (layer II–III), the inner (layer III–IV)
and the outer (layer V–VI) boundary zones of the ischemic
cortex, compared to sham-operated, intact controls
(P < 0.01, respectively; Fig. 6A). Melatonin-treated
animals (n = 8 for both groups), however, had a signiﬁcantly improved numbers of mushroom spine density of
the second- and third-order basilar dendrites of the pyramidal neurons at the layers II–III, III–IV, and V–VI of
the ischemic hemisphere at Day 1 and 28 (P < 0.05,
respectively; Fig. 6A–C), relative to vehicle-injected controls (n = 8 for both groups). Melatonin-treated animals

Discussion
This study showed that melatonin increased the
expressions of the PSD-95 and GAP-43 proteins, and
thus, improved dendritic spine lengths and branches
218

(aborizations) in cultured neurons exposed to glutamate
excitotoxicity. We also demonstrated that melatonin
not only improved neuronal dendritic spine density,
but also enhanced the PSD-95 and GAP-43 protein
expressions and the MMP-9 activity at a subacute
stage of recovery following cerebral ischemia–reperfusion [9, 20, 24]. Another novel ﬁnding was that treatment with melatonin reduced neuronal damage,
improved neuronal survival and plasticity [8, 35], and,
thus, enhanced neurobehavioral outcomes following a
long-term recovery period after transient focal cerebral
ischemia in rats.

at Day 7 after ischemia. Densitometric
analyses
showed
that
melatonin
signiﬁcantly improved the expression in
the GAP-43 protein in the ischemic core
(A) and penumbral (B) cortices.
Melatonin also improved the PSD-95
protein at the penumbral (D), but not the
ischemic core (C), brain tissues.

The neuroprotection and neuroplasticity observed here
at the levels of the neuronal stoma, dendritic spine density,
postsynaptic spines, axonal sprouting, and ECM remodeling cannot be accounted for by changes in hemodilution (as
measured by blood hematocrit), arterial blood pressure,
heart rate, glucose, core temperature, or diﬀerences in
LCBF, because these values were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
when compared between vehicle-injected and melatonintreated animals [44, 48]. The ﬁnding that improvements for
the dendritic aborizations, postdendritic spine, and axonal
sprouting were also be observed in the cultured neurons
exposed to glutamate further justiﬁed the melatonin-mediated long-lasting neuroplasticity, as shown here.
We have observed two speciﬁc patterns of reductions of
the dendritic spine density in macroscopically intact brain
tissues at Day 1 after transient MCA occlusion: (i) changes
in the peri-infarct penumbral regions and (ii) remote
changes contralateral to the side of the infarct [8, 27, 48,
49]. Consistent with the Day-7 data reported previously
[8], we found that at Day 1, both the two patterns of
reduced dendritic spine density could be improved with
melatonin either in the peri-infarct penumbral or the
remote contralateral, intact brain regions. At Day 28, melatonin, however, only signiﬁcantly enhanced the reduced
dendritic spine density in the penumbral brain, because

contralateral diaschisis in dendritic spine density returned
to normal levels after a recovery period of 28 days in controls and melatonin-treated animals. Interestingly, melatonin not only improved the MMP-9 activity and the
expressions of PSD-95 and GAP-43 proteins in the penumbral brain at Day 7, but also enhanced the MMP-2
levels at the contralateral homotopic intact brain [9, 20,
25]. This melatonin-mediated increase in the MMP-2 levels
at Day 7 was correlated with the improved contralateral
neuroplasticity observed in melatonin-treated animals during the early recovery period (Day 1 and Day 7), as
observed here and reported previously [8]. Accordingly,
the data supported that melatonin improved functional
deﬁcits after stroke by providing direct neuroplasticity to
damaged brain tissues, and also by reducing remote brain
injury, or, using other intact brain to compensate for the
lost function during a course of healing.
Optimal sensorimotor function requires both anatomical
and functional linkages among the neuronal soma, axons,
dendritic spines, synapses as well as the ECM integrity [8,
26]. These structures and their axonal synaptodendritic
connections as well as the ECM integrity are involved in
the processing and integration of sensorimotor information [8, 9, 26]. The marked and prolonged reductions of
the dendritic spine density in the peri-infarct penumbral

region indicate that there may be relatively widespread and
persisting functional disturbances in this region [8, 48, 49].
The ﬁndings with improved neurobehavioral outcomes
observed with melatonin following a long-term recovery
further justify its ability to improve neuroplasticity at the
postsynaptic, axonal sprouting, dendritic spine density, and
the ECM levels following ischemic stroke, as observed here.
Previous ﬁndings that melatonin and its main brain metabolites worked well to inhibit nNOS activity in the ischemic
brain also validated its ability to enhance the PSD-95-mediated synaptic plasticity observed here [36–39].
A variety of mechanisms including free radical formation, disordered neurotransmitter storage, uptake and
release, or a general stress response, may underlie the

(A, right upper panel), vehicle-injected
ischemic controls (A, left lower panel),

Scale bar = 40 lm; = 15 lm in the
magniﬁcation inset. The left upper panel
in A indicates the 4 nonoverlapping
sampling sites selected for dendritic spine
counting in the study. Vehicle-injected
ischemic controls had a decreased
dendritic spine density in the ischemic
core, inner and outer boundary zones of
ischemia (Fig. A), compared with shamoperated controls. At Day 1 and Day 28,
melatonin-treated animals, however, had
a signiﬁcantly improved density of
mushroom spines of the second- (A, B)
and third-order (A, C) dendrites at the
layers II–III, III–IV, and V–VI of the
ischemic hemisphere, relative to vehicleinjected controls. In addition, we have
observed that, at Day 1 but not Day 28,
vehicle-injected ischemic controls had a
signiﬁcantly lower density of the secondand third-order basilar dendritic spines of
pyramidal neuron at the layer V–VI
region of the contralateral, intact brain
(D, E), compared with sham-operated
controls. Melatonin treatment could
eﬀectively reverse the reduction in the
dendritic spines at Day 1 in the

ipsilateral and remote excitability changes observed after
stroke; this needs further evaluation [8, 50]. One of the
most obvious explanations for the diaschisis changes in
dendritic spine density observed at Day 1 and Day 7 at
the contralateral homotopic brain is transhemispheric/
transcallosal deaﬀerentation [51]. Whether the changes in
the MMP-2 level of the contralateral brain observed here
account for the severity of the contralateral diaschisis
needs further evaluation [9, 10]. Both the peri-infarct and
the remote changes in the dendritic spine density and other
molecular signaling cascades may turn out to be valuable
indicators of functional disturbances, which could become
targets of therapeutic interventions at the early and
subacute stage after stroke [8].

Melatonin enhanced postinsult neuroplasticity
We have observed that, perhaps via diﬀerent mechanisms of action (e.g., MMP-9 and MMP-2, respectively),
melatonin overcame poststroke functional deﬁcits by
improving in situ and remote neuroplasticity at both the
penumbral brain and those intact brain tissues distal from
the area of injury [8, 49, 51]. The present study and our
previous work also indicate that melatonin can modulate
MMPs and therefore exhibit neuroprotective or plasticity/
trophic actions depending on diﬀerent time course and/or
molecular basis of ischemic stroke [14–16]. Thus, melatonin is a potent regulator of MMPs at various stages of
injury [14–16, 52]. Recent evidence also strongly support
that tight binding of melatonin in the active site is
involved in modulating the catalytic activity of MMP-9
[52]. Additional studies are, however, required to decipher
more molecular events through which melatonin regulates
the activity of the MMPs and leads to the improved longterm neuroplasticity observed here.
It has been shown that neuroprotective eﬀects of melatonin against acute brain damage do not depend on melatonin receptors in a mouse model of ischemic stroke
[53]. Further studies are needed to clarify whether melatonin receptors are involved in the melatonin-mediated
neuronal growth/maturation, neuroplasticity, and neurogenesis during the subacute and long-term stages of
ischemic stroke as observed here and reported previously
[8, 53–55]. Additional studies are also needed to clarify
the melatonin’s beneﬁcial role in the ﬁeld of human
stroke, although a lack of economic beneﬁts for pharmacological companies may actually hinder its further
clinical trials.
In summary, we demonstrate that administration with
melatonin induces in vitro and in vivo neuroprotection and
neuroplasticity through improving the PSD-95 and GAP43 protein expressions. In addition, we show that melatonin decreases poststroke diaschisis and enhances long-term
neuroplasticity probably via upregulating the MMP-2 and
MMP-9 in the nonischemic and ischemic brain, respectively. As melatonin oﬀers the advantage for improving
postischemic neuroplasticity for both the penumbral and
the contralateral, intact brain, it may be worthwhile further investigating in the ﬁeld of ischemic stroke in human
beings.
