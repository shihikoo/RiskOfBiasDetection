Systemic administration of human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) mononuclear cells (MNC) following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the rat reduces infarct size and, more importantly, restores motor function. The
HUCB cell preparation is composed of immature T-cells, B-cells, monocytes and stem cells. In this study we examined whether the beneﬁcial effects of HUCB injection were attributable to one of these cell types. Male Sprague
Dawley rats underwent permanent MCAO followed 48 h later by intravenous administration of HUCB MNC preparations depleted of either CD14 + monocytes, CD133 + stem cells, CD2 + T-cells or CD19 + B cells. Motor function
was measured prior to MCAO and 30 days post-stroke. When CD14 + monocytes were depleted from the HUCB
MNC, activity and motor asymmetry were similar to the MCAO only treated animals. Monocyte depletion
prevented HUCB cell treatment from reducing infarct size while monocyte enrichment was sufﬁcient to reduce
infarct size. Administration of monocyte-depleted HUCB cells did not suppress Iba1 labeling of microglia in the
infarcted area relative to treatment with the whole HUCB preparation. These data demonstrate that the HUCB
monocytes provide the majority of the efﬁcacy in reducing infarct volume and promoting functional recovery.

Introduction
Despite great progress in the prevention, diagnosis and understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke, it is the fourth leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability worldwide (Roger
et al., 2011). Still, our advancement toward developing new therapeutic
agents has been limited. Currently, only the thrombolytic agent, tissue
plasminogen activator (TPA), is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the acute (urgent) treatment of ischemic stroke,
which accounts for 85% of all strokes. TPA is only effective within 4.5 h of
the onset of stroke and resolves ischemia by dissolving the clot. With
this narrow therapeutic window, only 2–3% of all stroke patients are
able to beneﬁt from the use of TPA.
Cell therapy has garnered attention over the last 20 years, and could
substantially expand the treatment window. The earliest studies used
fetal tissue to examine the ability of transplanted cells to repair
stroke-damaged brain by replacing the dead neurons (Mampalam
et al., 1988; Tonder et al., 1989). The ﬁrst cell therapy to reach clinical
trials for a treatment of lacunar ischemic strokes was the hNT or LBS
neurons, a cell-line developed from a teratocarcinoma (Kondziolka

et al., 2000). Since that time much of the focus has been on stem cell
therapies encompassing embryonic, neural (and other somatic stem
cells), and, more recently, induced pluripotent stem cells (see (Sladek
and Bjugstad, 2011) for a recent commentary). Our understanding of
the repair mechanisms that underlie the therapeutic beneﬁts associated
with cell therapy have evolved from simple neural repair to include
trophic support (Kern et al., 2011), inhibition of inﬂammation (Yang
et al., 2010), as well as stimulation of angiogenesis and endogenous
neurogenesis (Taguchi et al., 2004).
The ﬁrst published report of HUCB MNC intravenous administration
as a treatment for experimental stroke was by Chen and associates
(Chen et al., 2001). They found that delivering 3 × 106 cells 24 h postMCAO signiﬁcantly improved motor function, as determined with the
modiﬁed neurological severity score (mNSS) and rotorod tests, while
having little effect on infarct size. Since that time there have been a
number of reports demonstrating that HUCB cells can repair damaged
brain in rodent models of cerebral hypoxia and ischemia. We found
that systemic administration of these cells signiﬁcantly decreases infarct
size, and reduces the pro-inﬂammatory cells and cytokines associated
with stroke (Hall et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2010; Leonardo et al., 2010;
Vendrame et al., 2005). Systemic administration is the preferable
route, producing more sustained behavioral improvements compared
to direct intraparenchymal administration (Willing et al., 2003). This
was conﬁrmed by another research group that showed that HUCB
cells do not need to enter the CNS to produce their reparative effects

examined. Animals that were treated with CD14 depleted MNC were as
active as untreated MCAO animals on all activity measures and signiﬁcantly more active than MNC treated animals (p b 0.05). Removal of
the CD133 cells resulted in a signiﬁcant increase from the amount of
horizontal activity observed compared to the MNC group (p b 0.05). Removal of the CD19 + B cells produced variable results, tending to increase horizontal activity and clockwise rotation but having little
effect on total distance or margin distance.
The Step test of motor asymmetry was used to measure function of
the contralateral forelimb. After MCAO, the number of steps taken
with the contralateral paw in the MCAO only group was 33.0 ± 9.2%
of the baseline number of steps (Fig. 2). Administering HPB cells actually
reduced the number of steps taken even further (11.9 ± 12.2%, p b 0.05
compared to MCAO only). With administration of MNC, the percentage
of steps taken marginally improved to 50.6 ± 9.6%. The number of steps
taken signiﬁcantly decreased in the CD14 depleted group (28.4 ± 5.8%)
compared to the MNC treated group (p b 0.05). Removal of the CD2,
CD133 and CD19 cells from the MNC did not alter performance on the
Step test compared to the MNC treated group.

(Borlongan et al., 2004). When delivered systemically at 48 h following
MCAO, these cells have their optimal effect on decreasing infarct volume
and enhancing behavioral recovery (Newcomb et al., 2006; Vendrame
et al., 2004). This work has been replicated by other research groups
(Boltze et al., 2006, 2011). Other studies have focused on CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells from HUCB as the active cell type (Boltze et al.,
2008; Liu et al., 2006; Taguchi et al., 2004). Although both CD34 + and
CD34 − HUCB cells had similar behavioral effects, neither were as effective as MNC (Boltze et al., 2012). Still others have focused on developing
HUCB derived neural cell lines (Kozłowska et al., 2007; Xiao et al., 2005)
for the treatment of stroke.
We have routinely employed the MNC fraction of HUCB in our studies. It is a mixed population of cells composed predominantly of immature T-cells, B-cells, monocytes, and stem cells. Although we have
repeatedly shown the neuroprotective and anti-inﬂammatory effects
of HUCB cells following MCAO, it is unclear which of the cell populations
within the MNC is responsible for these effects. All of the major components of the HUCB MNCs are immunologically immature and do not respond to stimulation in the same way mature T cells, B cells or
monocytes respond; as such they may passively interfere with the ongoing inﬂammatory responses that occur after MCAO. Alternatively,
their more limited repertoire of responses may skew their responses toward one aspect of the cells' function. For example, HUCB derived
monocytes are not as responsive to stimulation with hepatocyte growth
factor (Jiang et al., 2001), interleukin (IL)-4, or granulocyte and macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Liu et al., 2001) and therefore produce fewer dendritic cells than adult monocytes as well as
producing less IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and adhesion
molecules (Brichard et al., 2001; Jiang et al., 2001; Le et al., 1997). As we
begin to develop a HUCB-based cell therapy for stroke, it becomes even
more important to characterize the active component of the cell preparation in order to provide only those cells that are necessary for the antistroke effect, thereby enhancing the therapeutic potency and reducing
potential adverse reactions. Therefore, in this study, speciﬁc cellular
components of the HUCB MNC were depleted (monocytes (CD14 +),
stem cells (CD133 +), T-cells (CD2 +) or B cells (CD19 +)) and the ability
of the resulting cell preparations to induce behavioral recovery and
minimize infarct size was measured in male Sprague Dawley rats after
MCAO. CD133 + stem cells were examined , instead of the CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells studied by other groups, because these cells
can give rise to both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. Moreover, administration of CD14 enriched fractions conﬁrmed the effects of
this speciﬁc cell population on infarct size.

To provide further evidence for the role of CD14 + monocytes in the
HUCB MNC effects, we injected a cohort of animals with either HUCB
MNCs, HUCB CD14 + cells or HPB CD14 + cells (Fig. 4). Infarct size was
decreased equally in all cell transplant groups and these groups had signiﬁcantly smaller infarcts than the MCAO only group.

Results

IBa1labeling of cells in the infarcted hemisphere

Removing CD14 + monocytes from the HUCB MNC reversed the behavioral
improvement observed with MNC administration

We have previously shown that HUCB MNC modify the inﬂammatory response to MCAO, as indicated by changes in the number and morphology of myeloid cells (microglia, monocytes or macrophage)
(Leonardo et al., 2010) and altered cytokine proﬁle (Vendrame et al.,
2005). In this study we used an antibody to IBa1 to determine if there
were long term changes in these myeloid cells in response to the
MCAO and HUCB treatment. Microglia within the contralateral hemisphere of the untreated MCAO only animals exhibited a resting
morphology, with a small cell body and long branching processes
(Fig. 4A). In the untreated MCAO animals even 30 days post-MCAO,
there were many IBa1 positive (+) cells in the border zone around
the infarct as well as within the core of the infarct (Fig. 5B). The cells
in this region exhibited all three “microglial” morphologies — small
and ramiﬁed (resting), bushy and ramiﬁed (partially activated state)
or amoeboid (phagocytic/inﬂammatory state). In the HPB treated animals, there were many amoeboid and bushy ramiﬁed microglia within
and around the infarct site (Fig. 5C). Consistent with the earlier studies,
rats treated with HUCB MNC exhibited microglia with a resting phenotype throughout the infarcted hemisphere (Fig. 5D). When we examined sections from the CD14 depleted group, however, there was

Measurement of spontaneous activity was performed during the 12
hour dark phase of the light cycle when the animals were most active
using an automated open ﬁeld system from Accuscan Instruments.
The animals were tested both prior to MCAO and then at 1 month
after the surgical procedure. The data are expressed as percent of baseline. In Fig. 1, we present activity measured on four parameters — horizontal activity (Fig. 1A), total distance traveled in the horizontal plane
(Fig. 1B), total distance traveled around the outside edges of the test
cage (margin distance; Fig. 1C) and clockwise rotation (Fig. 1D). After
MCAO, there was an increase in activity above baseline levels on all
measured variables, consistent with previous observations (Block and
Schwarz, 1996; Borlongan et al., 1995a,b; Newcomb et al., 2006;
Poignet et al., 1989; Puurunen et al., 1997; Willing et al., 2002).
There were no signiﬁcant differences between the MCAO group and
the adult human peripheral blood (HPB) group on any parameters.
Administration of HUCB MNC reduced horizontal activity signiﬁcantly
(p b 0.05) but only marginally reduced activity on all other parameters

Removal of CD14 + monocytes from the HUCB MNC increased infarct size
after MCAO
Infarct size was determined using Nissl thionin histology (Fig. 3).
There was extensive damage in the lateral striatum and overlying cortex
after MCAO (Fig. 3A). Administration of HPB did not reduce infarct size
(Fig. 3B, 3H). The lateral ventricle in the infarcted hemisphere was enlarged and there was some loss of striatal architecture. Infarcts were
visible in all HUCB treated groups (Fig. 3C–G); all had ongoing degenerative processes as illustrated with the Nissl thionin staining and various
degrees of ventricular enlargement and loss of tissue. When we analyzed infarct size, there was a signiﬁcant increase in infarct size in the
groups treated with CD14 depleted MNC compared to the group that received the whole MNC fraction (p b 0.05).

extensive IBa1 immunolabeling and the majority of labeled cells exhibited an amoeboid morphology (Fig. 5E). When we quantiﬁed the number of labeled cells in the sections, there was a signiﬁcant effect of
treatment (p b 0.008; Fig. 5F). When individual comparisons were
made using the Newman–Keuls test, there were signiﬁcantly fewer

microglia in the MNC group than in the MCAO only group (p b 0.05).
There were also signiﬁcantly more labeled microglia in the CD14 depleted group than in the MNC group (p b 0.05).
Discussion
The goal of this study was to determine which subpopulation of
MNC HUCB cells is responsible for the ability of the HUCB MNC fraction
to decrease infarct size and improve recovery. Using MACS, we depleted
the HUCB MNC of monocytes, T cells, B cells or CD133 + stem cells. Depletion of the CD14 + monocytes produced the largest, most consistent
decrements in behavioral recovery and increased infarct size. Activity
levels and infarct size of the animals treated with monocyte depleted
HUCB MNC were similar to that observed in the untreated MCAO
group. When animals were treated with enriched fractions of CD14 +
cells infarct size decreased to the same extent as with the MNC treated
group. These results suggest that HUCB monocytes are the critical cellular component of HUCB MNC fraction that induces recovery after MCAO.
Monocytes repair ischemic damage

Fig. 2. Depletion of CD14 + cells from the HUCB MNC eliminates improved motor function
on the Step test. The rats were dragged at constant velocity for one meter with their impaired paw in contact with the table top. The number of steps taken was counted prior
to MCAO and then 30 days post-MCAO. In the MCAO only group, the rats took less than
40% of the steps with their impaired paw than they had prior to MCAO. Administration
of MNC resulted in the rats performing better on this test while removal of the CD14 +
cells from the MNC reversed this improvement. *p b 0.05.

There have been three recent reports implicating monocytes in ischemic tissue repair. When CD14 + cells isolated from adult human peripheral blood MNC fraction were injected into the ischemic hind limb
of diabetic mice, there was less necrotic muscle and greater arteriolar
densities in the treated mice (Awad et al., 2006). In a second study, either CD133 + stem cells or CD11b + monocytes from mouse bone marrow were injected intravenously (i.v.) or intramuscularly (i.m.) 24 h

after induction of hind limb ischemia (Sanchez-Guijo et al., 2010).
Whether delivered i.m. or i.v. both cell types signiﬁcantly increased
blood ﬂow to the ischemic limb as measured by laser Doppler and
both increased capillary density as determined using immunohistochemistry for endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Neither cell type integrated into the new blood vessels in the muscle, however, suggesting
that the cells may be releasing angiogenic substances. The third study
was a clinical trial in which patients with refractory angina received
multiple injections of autologous bone marrow MNCs into viable, but ischemic myocardium (Hossne et al., 2009). Patients exhibited signiﬁcant, progressive improvements in clinical angina classiﬁcation that
were maintained out to 18 months post-transplant as well as reduced
ischemia as determined using stress technetium scintigraphy. Improved
function was correlated with the monocyte content of the MNC fraction
and not lymphocyte or stem cell content.
In all three of these studies, treatment with monocytes decreased
damage. Our results are consistent with these earlier observations
since removal of the CD14 + monocytes from the HUCB MNC fraction
eliminated the neuroprotective and anti-inﬂammatory effects of HUCB
administration in our permanent MCAO model while administering
cord blood derived CD14+ reduced infarct size to a similar degree as
the MNC fraction.
The results of these earlier studies also suggest that the therapeutic
properties of monocytes may not be limited to the HUCB derived cells,

but may be a universal property of monocytes, regardless of their
source. Indeed, when we administered CD14 + cells harvested from
adult HPB, infarct size was decreased to the same extent as when we administered HUCB MNC or CD14 + cells. However, the HPB MNC did not
induce behavioral recovery or have any effect on infarct size, in spite of
the fact that monocytes are present in HPB MNC. The explanation for
this discrepancy may rest in the interactions of the mononuclear fraction cellular components. Both T and B cells in the adult peripheral
blood are fully competent immune cells whereas the HUCB T and B
cells are not. While monocytes can inhibit T cell proliferation (Slaney
et al., 2011) and present antigen to B cells (Randolph et al., 2008), administering the mixture of fully competent immune cells into the proinﬂammatory environment prevalent after MCAO may mask the protective effects of the monocytes.
CD14 + depleted HUCB cells increase MCAO-induced inﬂammation
Inﬂammation begins immediately after the onset of an ischemic
stroke and is characterized by an early proliferative response followed
by a later pro-inﬂammatory response. During the early phase, the proliferating microglia secrete insulin-like growth factor one (IGF-1), which
is neuroprotective (Kriz, 2006). Indeed, by eliminating microglia or
macrophage during this early inﬂammatory phase, infarct size is increased (Lalancette-Hebert et al., 2007; Smirkin et al., 2010). Similar

observations have been made in other models of neurodegeneration;
inhibiting TNF-α during the ﬁrst week after 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) treatment produced a larger lesion than inhibiting TNFα beginning 5 days after 6-OHDA (Gemma et al., 2007). Smirkin and associates
demonstrated that Iba1 +/NG2 + cells observed in the brain during the
ﬁrst 2 days after transient MCAO expressed mRNA for multiple growth
factors (Smirkin et al., 2010), which would account for their neuroprotective properties. The later inﬂammatory response is characterized
by the massive inﬂux of peripheral immune cells (mainly macrophage) and the release of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines. In our
MCAO model, we showed that there is a transformation of CD11b +
cells into amoeboid cells and inﬁltration of isolectin + cells into infarcted hemisphere that occurs by 72 h after stroke onset
(Leonardo et al., 2010); these cells express matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and nitric oxide. By administering the HUCB MNCs
48 h after stroke, we allow the early inﬂammatory response to

proceed while altering the secondary inﬂammatory response. Indeed, HUCB MNCs decrease the number of CD11b + cells (microglia,
monocytes, and macrophage) within the brain and this decrease is
associated with a signiﬁcant decrease in both mRNA and protein expression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (Vendrame et al., 2005). Further, the HUCB MNCs decrease microglial activation as indicated by a
return to resting morphology within 24 h of administration (Leonardo
et al., 2010). In this study we showed that the return to resting morphology in the infarcted hemisphere is maintained out to one month
after MCAO. In contrast when the CD14 + monocytes are depleted
from the HUCB MNC, there are more Iba-1 + cells within the infarcted
hemisphere and they have an amoeboid morphology indicative of
a pro-inﬂammatory, phagocytic function.
The mechanism by which the CD14 + monocytes produce this alteration in microglial or macrophage function in the brain, remains to be
elucidated. Adult monocytes can differentiate into macrophage and

dendritic cells but they also scavenge toxins, produce cytokines, growth
factors, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, prostaglandins, complement and proteolytic enzymes (see references (Auffray et al., 2009;
Geissmann et al., 2008) for recent reviews) and can function as antigen
presenting cells (Van Voorhis et al., 1983). In many respects, monocytes
within HUCB are indistinguishable from adult monocytes (Filias et al.,
2011; Gille et al., 2009), but they are not stimulated by hepatocyte
growth factor (Jiang et al., 2001), produce fewer dendritic cells compared to adult monocytes (Liu et al., 2001) and also produce lower concentrations of pro- and anti-inﬂammatory cytokines (Brichard et al.,
2001; Jiang et al., 2001; Le et al., 1997). A recent report in a model of diabetic retinopathy demonstrated that CD14 + HUCB cells became alternatively activated M2 macrophage that stimulated the resident myeloid
cells to also become alternatively activated (Marchetti et al., 2011). Removal of the CD14 + monocytes would remove a signiﬁcant antiinﬂammatory, regenerative signal.
The role of other MNCs in HUCB induced recovery
Our data in those animals that received the CD133 (stem cell) and
CD2 (T cell) depleted HUCB preparations do not allow us to draw any

ﬁrm conclusions about the role of these cells in HUCB induced recovery
after MCAO since the MACS sorting only depleted 52.9% and 22.3% respectively of these cells from the MNC fraction.
Removal of the B cells from the MNC fraction was more effective, removing 88.5% of the cells. Even so, the results were equivocal; activity
tended to increase on some of the measured parameters but there
were no signiﬁcant increases on the behavioral measures or in infarct
size. The lack of effect after B cell removal from the HUCB MNC fraction
would suggest that these are not the primary cells involved in HUCB
MNC induced repair.
In summary, CD14 + monocytes play a critical role in the ability of
HUCB cells to improve functional recovery and reduce infarct size in
the permanent MCAO rat model of stroke; removal of these cells from
the MNC eliminated the HUCB therapeutic effects while administering
CD14 + monocytes alone replicated the HUCB-induced brain repair.
The protective effects of the CD14 + monocytes were similar regardless
of whether they were harvested from the adult blood or cord blood.
These results are consistent with other recent studies demonstrating
the ability of monocytes to induce tissue repair in multiple models of ischemic tissue injury. Additional studies will be required to determine if
monocyte therapeutic effects are a result of direct modulation of

inﬂammatory processes, induction of angiogenesis (see (Sanberg et al.,
2010) for a recent review), or activation of other processes.
Experimental methods
Animals
These studies were carried out under the purview of the University
of South Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol
#2866, #3472) and adhered to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (344 ± 5 g at surgery) were group housed in a temperature controlled room with free
access to food and water under 12 hour light/dark conditions. All animals underwent MCAO and were then randomly assigned to the experimental conditions. Surgical mortality was 21%. We lost an additional 4
animals because cerebral blood ﬂow did not decrease to criterion. In the
ﬁrst 4 days post-stroke, an additional 19% of animals were either euthanized or died; these animals came from all experimental conditions.
Fifty-one animals completed the study with the ﬁnal number per
group as follows: MCAO-only (n = 8), HUCB MNC (n = 7), adult
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (HPB; n = 7), or HUCB depleted of CD2 + T cells (n = 6), CD133 + stem cells (n = 8), CD19 + B
cells (n = 7) or CD14 monocytes and macrophage (n = 8).
A second cohort of animals was transplanted with enriched HUCB
cell fractions. In this study, mortality was 20.5%. Forty-eight animals
completed the study with the ﬁnal number per group as follows:
MCAO-only (n = 12), HUCB MNC (n = 9), CD14 + cells from adult
HPB (HPB CD14 +; n = 10) and CD14 + cells from HUCB (n = 17).
Middle cerebral artery occlusion
At the time of surgery, the animals were anesthetized with
Isoﬂurane (2–5% in O2 delivered at 2 l/min) and the top of the skull exposed. Using a Dremel microdrill, a small hole was drilled through the
skull at 1 mm posterior and 4 mm lateral to bregma. A hollow guide
screw was placed in the hole and a 500 μm ﬁber optic ﬁlament was
inserted through the guide until it rested on the surface of the brain.
The ﬁlament was anchored with super glue. Cerebral blood perfusion
was measured with the Moor Instruments Ltd., Flow Laser Doppler
using MoorLab Windows-based software.
Once the laser Doppler probe was in place, an incision was made just
above the clavicle. Using blunt dissection techniques, the right common
carotid artery was exposed and carefully dissected from the surrounding tissue. The external carotid was ligated and a 4 cm length of 4.0
monoﬁlament was inserted into the artery and then threaded through
the internal carotid to the origin of the right middle cerebral artery
(about 25 mm from the point of insertion). Cerebral blood perfusion
was again measured. To be included in the study, blood ﬂow had to decrease at least 60% from the baseline recorded prior to occlusion. Once
this was established, the monoﬁlament was permanently anchored in
place and the incision was closed. The screw guide and ﬁber optic ﬁlament were removed from the skull and the incision was closed.
Behavioral testing
Both prior to MCAO surgery and one month post-MCAO, behavioral
tests were performed to determine extent of MCAO impairment and
HUCB-induced recovery.
Spontaneous activity
The animals were placed in a Plexiglass box (35 × 20 × 30 cm)
surrounded by two tiers of infrared beams (Sanberg et al., 1987) and
spontaneous activity measured as previously described (Willing et al.,
2003). Locomotor parameters examined were horizontal activity, total
distance traveled in the cage, margin distance (distance traveled around
the perimeter of the cage) and clockwise rotation. Spontaneous activity

was measured hourly during the 12 hour dark phase of the light cycle.
Activity was calculated as percent of baseline activity for each animal
and then this was averaged across animals in each group. The data are
presented as mean ± SEM.
Step test
This test was performed as previously described (Willing et al.,
2003). The paws were tested in random order and the data presented
as mean ± SEM percent of the number of steps taken during baseline.
HUCB cell preparation and administration
We have previously shown that the optimal time to administer the
HUCB cells is 48 h post-MCAO (Newcomb et al., 2006); we therefore
transplanted the cells at this time point post MCAO to all groups except
the non-treatment (MCAO only) group. The cells (either HUCB or HPB
MNC, obtained commercially from AllCells, LLC), were thawed rapidly
at 37 °C and transferred slowly into 10 ml of 10 mM PBS. The cells
were then centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm, the supernatant was removed and cell viability was determined using the trypan blue dye exclusion method. The HPB MNC fraction was used as a cellular control
group for the HUCB MNC fraction. In one HUCB group, the whole MNC
fraction was injected. For the remaining HUCB groups, the cells then
underwent cell sorting prior to administration.
Magnetic antibody cell sorting (MACS)
Cellular depletion: magnetic antibody cell sorting (MACS) was used
to deplete speciﬁc populations of cells from the HUCB mononuclear
fraction. First, the HUCB cells were thawed quickly in a 37 °C water
bath and transferred into 5–10 ml of running buffer plus 100 μl DNase.
After determining viability of the cells using the trypan blue dye exclusion method, the sample was centrifuged at 1000 rpm × 10 min. The supernatant was removed and the cells resuspended in buffer at a volume
of 80 μl/107 cells and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. Antibody conjugated
paramagnetic microbeads (20 μl/107 cells) were then added to the cells.
CD2 labeled beads (cat#130-091-114, Miltenyi Biotech) were used to
deplete T cells, CD14 labeled beads (cat# 130-050-201, Miltenyi) to deplete monocytes/macrophage, CD19 (cat# 130-050-301, Miltenyi Biotech) to deplete B cells and CD133 (cat#130-090-853) to deplete stem
cells. After incubation, the cells were washed with 10–20× labeling volume of buffer and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant
was removed and the cells resuspended in 500 μl of buffer. Cells were
then depleted by passing the cells through a column with a high magnetic ﬁeld gradient that trapped the paramagnetic beads that were attached to the labeled cells(AutoMacs Pro). An aliquot of the resulting
cell preparation was then analyzed by ﬂow cytometry to determine
composition. The cells were placed into 200 μl of ﬂow cytometry buffer
(0.02% BSA, 0.05 mM EDTA in PBS) containing Fc-block™ (BD
Pharmingen) to reduce non-speciﬁc antibody binding and then incubated in the dark with the designated human antibody for 60 min on ice,
washed and ﬂow cytometry performed on the BD LSR II ﬂow cytometry
system. Control samples matched for each ﬂuorochrome and each antibody isotype were used to set negative staining criteria. Dead cells were
excluded using propidium iodide staining. Data were analyzed using BD
FACS Diva software (see Table 1).
Cellular enrichment: magnetic antibody cell sorting (MACS) was
used to enrich speciﬁc populations of cells from the HUCB mononuclear

fraction. The HUCB cells were thawed and viability was determined as
described for cellular depletion. The supernatant was removed and
the cells were resuspended in buffer at a volume of 80 μl/107 cells and
incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. Antibody conjugated CD14 + (cat# 130050-201, Miltenyi) paramagnetic microbeads (20 μl/107 cells) were
then added to the cells and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. After incubation, the cells were washed with 10– 20× labeling volume of buffer
and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was removed
and the cells were resuspended in 500 μl of buffer and then passed
through a column with a high magnetic ﬁeld gradient that trapped the
paramagnetic bead labeled cells. The magnetic ﬁeld gradient was removed, releasing the labeled cells into a new vial with buffer.
Transplantation
Cell concentration was adjusted to 2 × 106 cells/ml. The rats were
anesthetized with Isoﬂurane (2–5% in O2 delivered at 2 l/min) and a
30 gauge needle inserted into the lumen of the penile vein. In the negative selection study a single ﬁxed (non-body weight adjusted) dose
of cells (1 × 106 cells in 500 μl PBS) was delivered over 5 min. We
have previously demonstrated that this is the optimal cell dose in our
rodent MCAO model when the HUCB MNCs are delivered 48 h poststroke, regardless of body weight (Newcomb et al., 2006; Vendrame
et al., 2004). Pressure was applied to the insertion site and the needle
was removed. In the enrichment experiment, the MNCs were delivered
at 1 × 106 cells in 500 μl PBS while the CD14 + cells were delivered at 1.5
× 105 cells in 500 μl PBS, which is equivalent of the approximate number
of CD14+ cells present within the 1 × 106 cell dose of MNC fraction.
Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry
After the last behavioral tests, the animals were perfused
transcardially with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) until the blood cleared.
The animals were then perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PB,
the brain harvested and post-ﬁxed in PFA for 24 h. The brains were then
cryopreserved in 20% sucrose for 24 h, sectioned at 30 μm on a cryostat
and thaw mounted. These slides were stored at −20 °C until use.
Nissl thionin histology
The slides were rehydrated through a series of graded alcohols and
then incubated in Nissl thionin in glacial acetic acid/1 N NaOH solution
for 1.5 min. Distilled water was used to rinse the slides for 2 min before
they were dehydrated, cleared in xylene and coverslipped with
Permount. Six representative sections equally spaced through the extent of the infarct beginning 1.7 mm anterior to bregma and ending
3.3 mm posterior to bregma were chosen for analysis. We measured
the area of intact tissue (mm2) in the normal (contralateral) hemisphere and in the damaged hemisphere using the analysis tool in
Adobe Photoshop CS4 Extended. These measured areas were summed
for both the infarcted and normal hemispheres. Relative infarct size
was determined by subtracting the summed areas of intact tissue on
the infarcted side of the brain from the summed areas of the contralateral side and was expressed as a percentage of the contralateral
hemisphere.
Immunohistochemistry for microglia
In order to examine changes in microglia, two sections were chosen
between 0.7 mm anterior and 0.3 mm posterior to bregma for analysis.
The sections were washed with 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
before being incubated in 40% methanol 2% H2O2 in PBS for 20 min at
room temperature. The sections were washed again and blocked with
10% normal goat serum with 0.03% Triton X100 in PBS for 1 h. After
blocking, sections were incubated in rabbit anti-IBa1, which labels ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 present in myeloid cells
(1:1000, Wako, cat. #011974), overnight at 4 °C. The following day,
the sections were washed and then incubated in biotinylated goat
anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:300, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for

83

1 h at room temperature. After washing, the sections were incubated
in ABC solution (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h, washed again and then
the immunolabeling visualized using DAB (Pierce). The slides were
then dried, dehydrated through a graded series of alcohols, cleared in
xylene and coverslipped with DPX. The sections were examined on an
Olympus BX60 microscope at 20 ×, the view ﬁeld aligned to medial
edge of the infarct and the image captured with a Magnaﬁre digital camera. The number of IBa1 labeled cells was counted using a semiautomated process with Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics).
Statistical analysis
The data are reported as mean ± SEM. Based on a previous study in
which we examined the effect of HUCB MNC fractions on cellular content of the spleen and circulating lymphocytes (Golden et al., 2012),
we had hypothesized that removing speciﬁc cellular components of
the MNC would negatively affect behavioral recovery and infarct size.
For these analyses, we made a priori comparisons with t tests (Prism
5, GraphPad Software, Inc.) corrected for multiple comparisons with
the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure (McDonald, 2009). In this statistical
procedure the false discovery rate is controlled. The false discovery rate
we were willing to accept was 20%. We compared MCAO only group to
HPB treated and MNC treated as well as comparing the MNC group with
all the groups in which cell populations were depleted. For the enrichment study, the infarct data were analyzed by ANOVA with Neuman–
Keuls post-hoc tests. For analysis of IBa1 immunolabeling, analysis of
variance was performed followed by Newman–Keuls post-hoc tests. A
p value b 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
