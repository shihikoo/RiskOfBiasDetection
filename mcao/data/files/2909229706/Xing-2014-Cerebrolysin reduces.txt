a b s t r a c t
Focal cerebral infarction causes amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits and secondary thalamic neuronal degeneration. The
present study aimed to determine the protective effects of Cerebrolysin on Aβ deposits and secondary neuronal
damage in thalamus after cerebral infarction. At 24 h after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO),
Cerebrolysin (5 ml/kg) or saline as control was once daily administered for consecutive 13 days by intraperitoneal
injection. Sensory function and secondary thalamic damage were assessed with adhesive-removal test, Nissl
staining and immunoﬂuorescence at 14 days after MCAO. Aβ deposits, activity of β-site amyloid precursor
protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), apoptosis and autophagy were determined by TUNEL staining, immunoﬂuorescence and immunoblot. The results showed that Cerebrolysin signiﬁcantly improved sensory deﬁcit
compared to controls (p b 0.05). Aβ deposits and BACE1 were obviously reduced by Cerebrolysin, which was accompanied by decreases in neuronal loss and astroglial activation compared to controls (all p b 0.05). Coincidently,
Cerebrolysin markedly inhibited cleaved caspase-3, conversion of LC3-II, downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation
of Bax in the ipsilateral thalamus compared to controls (all p b 0.05). These ﬁndings suggest that Cerebrolysin reduces Aβ deposits, apoptosis and autophagy in the ipsilateral thalamus, which may be associated with amelioration
of secondary thalamic damage and functional recovery after cerebral infarction.

1. Introduction
Focal cerebral infarction causes neuronal loss and glial proliferation
in the ipsilateral thalamus [1,2]. Such secondary thalamic damage can
lead to delayed neuronal recovery and even sustained dementia [1,3].
Thus, protection against secondary neurodegeneration would be of
signiﬁcant clinical value after ischemic stroke.
Abnormal aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) has been found to predominantly occur in the ipsilateral thalamus following cerebral infarction and
inhibition of Aβ deposits prevents secondary neuronal death in the
thalamus [4–7]. Apoptotic cell death is involved in the delayed neuronal
injury of thalamus after experimental ischemic stroke [8,9]. In addition,
our recent ﬁndings indicate that blockade of autophagic activation
attenuates neuron loss and gliosis in the ipsilateral thalamus secondary
to focal cerebral infarction [10]. Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest that
modulation of Aβ deposits, autophagy or apoptosis may sever as a novel
therapeutic strategy.
Cerebrolysin is a mixture of low-molecular-weight neuropeptides
and free amino acids [11] and has clinically therapeutic potentials
in neurodegenerative disease and stroke [12,13]. Preclinical studies

have shown that Cerebrolysin could promote neurological functional
recovery with or without reducing infarct volume in stroke models
[14,15]. The neuroprotective effects of Cerebrolysin might involve
various mechanisms, including free radical formation scavenging,
prevention of excitotoxicity, modulation of calpain activity and apoptotic cell death [16–18]. Recent studies further demonstrate that
Cerebrolysin substantially improves neurological recovery and promotes stroke-induced endogenous neurogenesis through modulating
PI3K/Akt or Sonic hedgehog intracellular signaling pathway [19,20]. However, the potential effects of Cerebrolysin on secondary neuronal damage
following ischemic stroke still need further evaluation.
The present study, therefore, was conducted to determine whether
Cerebrolysin could protect against Aβ deposits and prevent secondary
thalamic damage following focal cerebral infarction. Additionally, the
possible mechanisms underlying neuroprotection of Cerebrolysin was
investigated.
2. Experimental procedures
2.1. Animal models and experiment groups
The experimental protocol was approved by the local ethics
committee for animal research, and all procedures involving animals

were conducted according to institutional guidelines. The stroke-prone
renovascular hypertensive rats (RHRSP) model was established in 50
male Sprague–Dawley rats (Medical Laboratory Animal Centre in
Guangdong province) as described by Zeng [21]. Resting blood pressure was measured once weekly by an indirect tail-cuff sphygmomanometer (ML866 Powerlab 4/30, AD Instruments Pty Ltd, Sydney,
Australia). Food and water were available at libitum. Approximately
12 weeks later, 42 RHRSP with systolic blood pressure higher than
180 mm Hg and without stroke symptoms were selected to receive
cerebral infarction and sham surgery.
Focal cerebral cortical infarction was induced by distal middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as previously described [22]. In
brief, under anesthesia with 10% chloral hydrate (3 ml/kg body
weight), the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) of RHRSP was exposed and occluded distal to the origin of the striatal branches
using bipolar electrocoagulation, which resulted in a permanent
focal infarction in the neocortex. Body temperature was maintained
at 37 ± 0.5 °C during the surgical procedures and recovery periods
using a heating pad. Rats with successful MCAO surgery were randomly
assigned into Cerebrolysin or vehicle group (12 rats per group).
Animals subjected to sham surgery were treated similarly except for
occlusion of the MCA (12 rats). The rest six rats were excluded as
MCAO failure.

Another series of coronal sections between −2.8 and −4.4 mm from
bregma were selected to perform immunostaining according to standard
procedures. Brieﬂy, sections were rinsed in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h at
room temperature (RT). Thereafter, the sections were incubated with
the following primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight: mouse anti-rat
microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2, 1:500, Millipore), mouse
anti-rat Glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 1:500, Millipore), rabbit
anti-rat β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1,
1:100, Thermo), rabbit anti-rodent Aβ3–16 (1:300, Covance), rabbit antirat cleaved caspase-3 (1:300, Cell Signaling Technology) or rabbit antirat microtubule-associated protein 1A light chain 3 (LC3, 1:400, MBL).
Negative control sections were incubated with 0.01 M PBS rather than
primary antibody. After being rinsed in 0.01 M PBS, sections were then
incubated at RT for 1 h with secondary antibodies: FITC-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or
Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories). The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated
dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was applied to a series
of cryosections using in situ cell death detection kit, TMR red (Roche
Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's suggestions.

2.2. Cerebrolysin treatment

2.7. Immunoblotting analysis

At 24 h after distal MCAO, rats in Cerebrolysin group were treated
with Cerebrolysin solution (5 ml/kg; Ebewe Pharma, Ges.m.b.H. Nfg.KG,
Austria) once daily for consecutive 13 days by intraperitoneal injection
according to the previous study [23]. Rats in vehicle group received an
equal dose of 0.9% saline as control and the sham-operated rats did not
receive any injection.

Additional four rats from each group were sacriﬁced at 14 days after
MCAO as described above and underwent intracardiac perfusion with
0.9% sodium chloride and the ipsilateral or contralateral thalamus was
separated. Total protein was extracted with western blot lysis buffer
containing protease inhibitor (Pierce). The homogenate was then
centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was preserved at −80 °C. Eighty micrograms of each sample was separated by
10% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene
ﬂuoride membrane (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5%
non-fat milk (BCR685, Sigma) and incubated with primary and secondary
antibodies. The primary antibodies were used as follows: rabbit anti-rat
caspase-3 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-rat Bcl-2
(1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-rat Bcl-XL (1:1000, Cell
Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-rat Bax (1:500, Cell Signaling
Technology), rabbit anti-rat LC3 (1:400, MBL) or mouse monoclonal
anti-β-actin (1:2000, Sigma). The secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:2000, Cell Signaling
Technology) or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1:2000, Cell Signaling
Technology). The membranes were treated with a chemiluminescent
system (Cell Signaling Technology) and then exposed with Kodak
X-OMAT ﬁlms.

2.3. Adhesive-removal test
Adhesive removal test was carried out blindly in experimental rats to
assess the somatosensory deﬁcit at 14 days post-MCAO as previously described [24]. Brieﬂy, rats were familiarized with the testing environment
and two small pieces of adhesive paper dots (of equal size, 113.1 mm2)
were adhered to the distal–radial region on the wrist of each forelimb.
The removal of stimulus from forelimbs was observed for at least 5 min
and time of adhesive-removal was recorded in 5 trials per day for each
forepaw.

2.4. Tissue preparation
At 14 days after MCAO, following a deep anesthesia with 10%
chloral hydrate intraperitoneally (4 ml/kg body weight), eight rats
selected randomly from each group were perfused transcardially
with 0.9% saline at 4 °C, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in
phosphate-buffer (PB, 0.1 M, pH 7.4). The brains were removed,
postﬁxed in the same ﬁxative for 6 h at 4 °C, and immersed sequentially
in 20% and 30% sucrose until sunk. Coronal sections (10-μm thick)
were cut with a cryostat (CM1900, Leica, Heidelberger, Germany) and
stored at −80 °C.
2.5. Nissl staining
A series of coronal sections of each group between + 4.7 and
− 5.2 mm from bregma were selected for Nissl staining to determine
the volume of the primary cortical infarction and the histological injury
in the thalamus. Routine Nissl staining was performed using 0.3% cresyl
violet (860980, Sigma) on brain sections.

2.6. Immunoﬂuorescent labeling

2.8. Image analysis and quantiﬁcation
Every 12th Nissl-stained section from bregma + 4.7 to − 5.2 mm
was selected for analysis and the primary cortical infarction volume
was presented as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere volume
as previously described [10]. For quantitative analysis of Nissl staining
or immunostaining in the thalamus, every 6th section between − 2.8
and −4.4 mm relative to bregma was selected by a research assistant
blind to the study protocol. The intact neurons, immunostaining and
TUNEL positive cells were counted within three non-overlapping ﬁelds
(425 × 320 μm2 under 400 × magniﬁcation) in the thalamus of each
section using NIH Image software (Bethesda, Maryland). For quantiﬁcation of thalamic Aβ deposits, the area of Aβ ﬂuorescence was determined.
For immunoblot, the relative densities of bands were quantiﬁed with an
image analysis program as above, and the ratios of cleaved caspase-3 relative to caspase-3 and Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bax relative to β-actin or LC3-II relative to LC3-I were calculated respectively.

2.9. Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean ± SE. Statistical analysis was conducted
using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Kruskal–
Wallis test. Differences were considered statistically signiﬁcant at
p b 0.05.

3. Results
3.1. Cerebrolysin improved sensory functional recovery after cortical
infarction
At 14 days after distal MCAO, the mean time of adhesive-removal at
left forepaw in the sham-operated rats was 5.0 ± 1.5 s. The mean time
of adhesive-removal at left forepaw in vehicle group was 11.5 ± 3.0
and signiﬁcantly increased compared with the sham-operated group
(p b 0.05). Compared with the vehicle group, Cerebrolysin treatment

markedly decreased the mean time of adhesive-removal at left forepaw
(6.0 ± 4.0, p b 0.05).

3.2. Cerebrolysin ameliorated the secondary damage in the ipsilateral
thalamus
Infarct volumes were not signiﬁcantly different between the
Cerebrolysin and vehicle groups (Fig. 1A and B, p N 0.05). However, in
the ipsilateral thalamus, atrophic neurons with shrunken cytoplasm
and damaged nuclei were evident in the vehicle group at 14 days
post-MCAO. The number of intact neurons in the ipsilateral thalamus
was signiﬁcantly higher in the Cerebrolysin group than the vehicle
group at 14 days post-MCAO (p b 0.05, Fig. 1A and C). Consistently,
the number of MAP-2+ neurons in the ipsilateral thalamus of the vehicle
group was markedly decreased compared with the sham-operated group
(p b 0.05). Cerebrolysin treatment signiﬁcantly increased the number of
MAP-2+ neurons compared with the vehicle group (p b 0.05, Fig. 1A and

D). In contrast, the number of GFAP+ neurons in the ipsilateral thalamus
of the Cerebrolysin group was markedly decreased compared with the
vehicle group (p b 0.05, Fig. 1A and E).
3.3. Cerebrolysin reduced BACE1 expression and Aβ deposits in the ipsilateral
thalamus
BACE1+/MAP-2+ cells in the ipsilateral thalamus were markedly increased at 14 days post-MCAO compared to the sham-operated group
(p b 0.05). Cerebrolysin treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the number of
BACE1+/MAP-2+ cells in the ipsilateral thalamus compared to the vehicle
group at the observed time point (p b 0.05, Fig. 2A and B). Consistently,
extensive Aβ immunoreactivity was observed in the vehicle group at
14 days post-MCAO. Additionally, treatment with Cerebrolysin markedly
reduced Aβ staining in the ipsilateral thalamus compared with that in the
vehicle group (p b 0.05, Fig. 2A and C).
3.4. Cerebrolysin decreased caspase-3 cleavage and apoptosis in the
ipsilateral thalamus
Cleaved caspase-3 levels were increased in the ipsilateral thalamus
at 14 days post-MCAO, but none was in the sham-operated thalamus
(Fig. 3A). The ratio of cleaved caspase-3/pan-caspase-3 was signiﬁcantly
higher in the ipsilateral thalamus of the vehicle group than that in the
sham side (p b 0.05). Cerebrolysin markedly reduced the ratios of
cleaved caspase-3/pan-caspase-3 in the ipsilateral thalamus compared
to the vehicle group (p b 0.05, Fig. 3B). The cleaved caspase-3 was mostly
co-stained positive for MAP-2 rather than GFAP (Fig. 3C).
Consistently, many TUNEL+ cells were detected in the ipsilateral
thalamus of the vehicle group at 14 days post-MCAO (Fig. 3D). The
number of TUNEL+ cells was signiﬁcantly decreased in the ipsilateral
thalamus of the Cerebrolysin group compared with that in the vehicle
group (p b 0.05, Fig. 3E).

3.5. Cerebrolysin reduced autophagic activation in the ipsilateral thalamus
Increased conversion of LC3-II was observed in the ipsilateral
thalamus at 14 days post-MCAO but little in the sham-operated thalamus.
The ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I was markedly higher in the ipsilateral thalamus
of the vehicle group than that in the sham-operated group. Cerebrolysin
treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I in the ipsilateral
thalamus compared to the vehicle group (p b 0.05, Fig. 4A and B).
Double-staining showed that LC3-positive cells were mostly co-stained
positive for MAP-2 but not for GFAP (Fig. 4C).
3.6. Cerebrolysin increased Bcl-2 and decreased Bax levels in the ipsilateral
thalamus
The Bcl-2 levels were signiﬁcantly lower in the ipsilateral thalamus
of vehicle group than that in the sham side (p b 0.05). Cerebrolysin
markedly increased the levels of Bcl-2 in the ipsilateral thalamus
compared with those in the vehicle group (p b 0.05, Fig. 5A and D).
Bcl-XL levels were not obviously different in the ipsilateral thalamus at
14 days post-MCAO among the sham-operated, vehicle and Cerebrolysin
groups (both p N 0.05, Fig. 5B and E). In contrast, the Bax levels were
markedly higher in the ipsilateral thalamus of the vehicle group than
those in the sham-operated group (p b 0.05). Cerebrolysin treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the levels of Bax in the ipsilateral thalamus compared
to the vehicle group (p b 0.05, Fig. 5C and F).
4. Discussion
In the present study, we found that abnormal Aβ deposits co-existed
with increased caspase-3 cleavage and LC3-II levels in the ipsilateral
thalamus following focal cerebral infarction. Delayed administration
of Cerebrolysin reduced Aβ deposits and decreased apoptosis and
autophagy in the ipsilateral thalamus, which was accompanied by
ameliorating secondary damage and somatosensory functional deﬁcits

following cerebral infarction. Taken together, the current ﬁndings suggest that Cerebrolysin reduces Aβ deposits, suppresses apoptosis and
autophagy, and ameliorate secondary thalamic damage as well as functional deﬁcit after focal cerebral infarction.
Aβ deposits contribute to the secondary thalamic neurodegeneration in transient or permanent MCAO models [4–7]. In the present
study, we found that abnormal Aβ deposits coincided with neuronal

loss and astroglial activation in the ipsilateral thalamus after focal cerebral
infarction. Delayed treatment with Cerebrolysin signiﬁcantly reduced Aβ
deposits and prevented secondary neuronal damage in the ipsilateral
thalamus following cerebral infarction, suggesting the protective
effects of Cerebrolysin on Aβ-related neurodegeneration. Consistently,
Cerebrolysin has been shown to reduce AD-like pathology by regulating
APP maturation in APP tg mice [23]. BACE1 plays a critical role in Aβ

generation and inhibition of BACE1 activity reduces Aβ deposits in AD
model [25,26]. The current study found that BACE1 were obviously elevated in neurons and Cerebrolysin markedly decreased BACE1 levels,

which indicates that Cerebrolysin may inhibit Aβ generation by reducing BACE1 in the ipsilateral thalamus after cerebral infarction. However,
Cerebrolysin may also decrease the activation of CDK5 and GSK-3β [23],

which plays an important role in activating γ-secretase complex [27,28].
Whether Cerebrolysin could suppress γ-secretase to hinder Aβ generation in the ipsilateral thalamus following cerebral infarction needs further
elucidation.
Activation of caspase, induction of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2
has been documented in Aβ induced neuronal death [29–31]. We
showed that Aβ deposits were accompanied by activation of caspase-3,
down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax in the ipsilateral
thalamus following cerebral infarction. Additionally, Cerebrolysin treatment prevented Aβ deposits, activation of caspase-3, down-regulation
of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax in the ipislateral thalamus, suggesting
potential effects of Cerebrolysin on Aβ-induced apoptotic pathway. Besides, Aβ also mediate neuronal autophagic activation and inhibition of
autophagy can prevent neuronal damage of thalamus after cerebral infarction [10,32]. In the present study, Cerebrolysin treatment markedly
decreased conversion of LC3-II in neurons of the ipsilateral thalamus as
well as ameliorating the secondary thalamic damage following focal cerebral infarction, indicating that inhibition of autophagy by Cerebrolysin
may also prevent the thalamic damage. Autophagy and apoptosis may
be triggered by common upstream signals and Bcl-2 antiapoptic family
proteins can also involve in autopahgic pathway [33]. The present results
showed Cerebrolysin obviously rescued downregulation of Bcl-2 in the
ipsilateral thalamus, which may inhibit both apoptosis and autophagy.
However, Cerebrolysin might prevent apoptotic cell death though
inhibiting autophagy in the ipsilateral thalamus as suppression of autophagy can block apoptotic cell death [34].
Previous studies have demonstrated that Cerebrolysin promote
neurological function recovery without reducing infarct volume [15].
Consistently, our data showed that delayed treatment with Cerebrolysin
ameliorated neurodegenerative damage in the ipsilateral thalamus and
promoted somatosensory recovery without reduction of cortical infarct
volume. Since thalamic damage plays a vital role in sensory deﬁcits
after MCAO [3], the functional recovery may be partly associated with
amelioration of neuronal damage in thalamus with Cerebrolysin treatment. Alternatively, Cerebrolysin may function as a neurotrophic activity
to ameliorate the sensory deﬁcit by promoting synaptic formation and
cholinergic ﬁber regeneration [35,36] or protecting against excitotoxicity
[37].
In summary, the present study provides novel evidence that
Cerebrolysin may serve as a useful intervention for treatment of delayed
thalamic damage secondary to cerebral infarction.
