Inﬂammatory damage plays an important role in cerebral ischemic pathogenesis and may represent a target for
treatment. Piperlonguminine (PE) has been proved to have anti-inﬂammatory actions. In this study, we investigated the effects of PE on cultured neuronal cell line, SH-SY5Y in vitro and experimental rat ischemic stroke
in vivo. For oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) stimulated SH-SY5Y cell
line in vitro, SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with PE. In vivo, rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MACO) for 1 h, followed by reperfusion for 23 h. The results of this study showed that treatment of SH-SY5Y
cells with PE reduced the OGD-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis and blocked TNF-α-induced activation of NFκB and MAPK. Intraperitoneal injection of PE (2.4 mg/kg) produced a signiﬁcant neuroprotective potential in rats
with cerebral ischemia. PE attenuated neurological deﬁcit scores, brain infarct volume and brain water content in
rats, and inhibited activation of NF-κB and MAPK. These data show that PE protects the brain against ischemic
cerebral injury via alleviating blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, which may be mediated via inhibiting
NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the third leading cause of death in industrialized countries
and the most common cause of permanent disability in adults globally
[1,2]. Three months following a stroke, 15–30% of stroke survivors are
permanently disabled and 20% requires institutional care [3]. Deﬁcits
can include partial paralysis and difﬁculties with memory, thinking,
language, and movements. The mechanisms that trigger ischemic
brain damage are complex, but the crucial role of the inﬂammatory response has been revealed during ischemic stroke in both animal and
human stroke [4].
Piper longum L. fruits have been widely used in the treatment of
bronchial diseases, menstrual pain, tuberculosis, muscular pain, sleeping
disorders, and certain form of arthritis in traditional medicine [5]. Subsequently, activity-guided puriﬁcation of the extract of P. longum fruits
identiﬁed one active principal component, piperlonguminine (PE) [6].
Piperlonguminine showed various biological properties and it has
been reported to treat multiple inﬂammatory disorders and tumors [7]
. However, to our knowledge, the functions of PE in ischemic stroke
have not been explored yet. In this study, we investigated the effects

of PE on cultured neuronal cell line, SH-SY5Y in vitro and experimental
ischemic stroke in vivo.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Piperlonguminine (PE) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.
(St. Louis, MO, USA). Its purity was 99%. The human neuroblastoma
cell line SH-SY5Y was purchased from the Shanghai Cell Bank of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China).
2.2. Cell culture
SH-SY5Y cells were cultured and maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle Medium (DMEM) solutions (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island,
NY), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco Laboratories,
Grand Island, NY). Cells were kept at 37 °C in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2/95% O2
incubator. The dissociated cells were seeded in poly-L-lysine-coated
plates at a density of 5 × 105/cm2 and cultured in DMEM, supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. The medium was changed twice weekly. After 8 days of
culture, the SH-SY5Y cells were randomly divided into seven groups:
normal group (no oxygen–glucose deprivation), oxygen–glucose

deprivation group (control group) and oxygen–glucose deprivation
+ PE groups (2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 μM). For oxygen–glucose deprivation,
the SH-SY5Y cells were washed twice in glucose-free balanced salt solution (BSS), and incubated in BSS (no glucose) in a humidiﬁed chamber
ﬁlled with 95% N2/5% CO2 for 3 h at 36.5 °C, while the normal group
and PE 20 μM group (no oxygen–glucose deprivation) were ﬁlled with
5% CO2/95% O2 and incubated in glucose-free BSS. After oxygen–glucose
deprivation, the cultures were replaced into neurobasal medium and incubated with PE (2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 μM) in a CO2 incubator for 12 h.

recorded and maintained at 37 °C throughout the surgical procedure.
A standard model of intraluminal middle cerebral artery (MCA) was
used to make permanent (MCAO) focal ischemia by intraluminal placement of a ﬁlament as described previously [8].
Rats were randomly divided into 2 groups with 15 rats each. Rats received 2.4 mg/kg PE by intraperitoneal administration after reperfusion
immediately (PE was dissolved in DMSO) as described before [9].
Neurological deﬁcits were determined at 24 h after ischemia followed
by brain infarct volume examination.

2.3. Determination of cell viability and apoptosis

2.5. Evaluation of neurological deﬁcits

After oxygen–glucose deprivation for 3 h followed by 12 h incubation with or without PE, cell viability was assessed using 3-[4, 5dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay
(Genebase, China). Apoptotic cells were evaluated using an Annexin-V
FITC apoptosis detection kit. In brief, cells were harvested, washed and
incubated at 4 °C for 30 min in the dark with annexin-V FITC and
propidium iodide, then analyzed on a FACS Vantage SE ﬂow cytometer
(Beckman Coulter, USA).

Neurological deﬁcits were evaluated using a 0–5 scoring method
[10] by an investigator who was blinded to each experimental group:
0, no neurological deﬁcits (normal); 1, failure to extend left forepaw
fully; 2, circling to the left; 3, falling to the left; 4, no spontaneous walking with a depressed level of consciousness, and 5, death.

2.4. Induction of rat cerebral ischemia and treatments
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (240–270 g) were supplied by the
Laboratory Animal Center of our University and were maintained on a
12 h light/12 h dark regime. All rats were provided with food and
water ad libitum. The animals were acclimatized to the laboratory conditions for 7 days before surgery. Animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate (10%). Rectal temperature was

2.6. Evaluation of infarct volume and brain water content
After 23 h reperfusion, rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital through intraperitoneal injection. The adequacy of anesthesia
was monitored by the level and stability of the MAP and absence of
the corneal reﬂex, and adequate levels of anesthesia and analgesia
were ensured with supplemental intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium given as required, then brains were quickly removed. The
total wet weight of the brain was measured accurately. The starting
site of the brain was cut at the forebrain (3 mm), and each brain was
sliced into ﬁve coronal sections of 2 mm thickness each, then stained

with a 2% solution of tetrazolium chloride (Sigma, USA) in saline at
37 °C for 20 min, and photographed. The images were digitized, and infarct volume was calculated with a Compix system computer. Then,
brain water content was determined as an indicator of cerebral edema
using a wet/dry method.

2.7. Evaluation of blood–brain barrier (BBB) leakage with Evans blue
extravasation
Determination of Evans blue extravasation was based on a previous
method [11]. After reperfusion, 0.1 ml of 4% Evans blue in saline was intravenously administered. Twenty-three hours after ischemia, rats were
anesthetized with chloral hydrate, then perfused with 20 ml 10 U/ml
heparinized saline to wash out the blood, the brain was then isolated,
weighed and homogenized in 50% solution of trichloroacetic acid.
After centrifugation at 500 g for 20 min, the supernatant was spectrophotometrically measured at 595 nm. Cerebral Evans blue was quantiﬁed as micrograms of dye per gram of wet weight.

2.8. Western blot
For the experiment of TNF-α stimulated SH-SY5Y cell lines in vitro,
SH-SY5Y cells (5 × 106) were pre-incubated with PE (20 μM) for 12 h,
then incubated with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 30 min. Cells were washed
twice with ice cold PBS on ice and lysed in cell lysis buffer (Sigma,
Saint Louis, MO, USA).
For western blot analysis, nuclear and cytosolic extracts of cells or
tissues were isolated using the NE-PER kit (Pierce) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of cell protein (80 μg)
were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using speciﬁc antibodies to p-P38, p38MAPK and NF-κBp65. All antibodies were
all purchased from Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA. Optical densities of
the bands were scanned and quantiﬁed with a Gel Doc 2000 (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). Lamin B (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) levels are shown
as an internal control. The results were expressed as fold increase over
control.

3.2. PE inhibited activation of NF-κB and MAPK in cultured SH-SY5Y cells
Activity of NF-κB p65 and p38MAPK was both signiﬁcantly increased
after TNF-α (20 ng/ml) stimulated SH-SY5Y cells for 30 min. We compared the effect of PE on the TNF-α-induced (20 ng/ml for 30 min) activation of NF-κB and MAPK expression level in the SH-SY5Y cells.
Based on Fig. 1, we chose the 20 μM PE for the following experiments.
We found that 20 μM PE pretreatment blocked the TNF-α-induced
phosphorylation of p38MAPK and NF-κBp65 (Fig. 2).
3.3. PE reduced neurological deﬁcit scores, brain infarct volume and brain
water content and in rats with experimental stroke
Cerebral ischemic injury results in behavioral disturbance and histological changes in MACO rats, showing that ischemic region was white
and non-ischemic region was red. Compared with the sham-operated
rats, neurological deﬁcit scores, the white regions and brain water content were signiﬁcantly increased in rats with experimental stroke. Our
results showed that PE (2.4 mg/kg) after reperfusion immediately decreased neurological deﬁcit scores, cerebral infarct volume (Fig. 3A)
and brain water content (Table 1).
3.4. PE reduced blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown in rats with cerebral
ischemia
Evans blue extravasation was used to assess of BBB breakdown after
cerebral ischemia. Vehicle-treated rats showed elevated Evans blue
extravasation compared with the sham-operated rats. In contrast, our
results showed that PE signiﬁcantly attenuated Evans blue extravasation (Fig. 3B).

2.9. Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using SPSS 16.0 software. Neurological deﬁcit
scores between groups were analyzed using Mann–Whitney U test.
Quantitative data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical comparisons were performed by one-way ANOVA for multiple comparisons.
P b 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

3. Results
3.1. PE protected cultured SH-SY5Y cells against oxygen–glucose
deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis
The MTT assay was used to assess the effect of PE on the oxygen–glucose deprivation-induced cytotoxicity and we found that cell viability
was markedly decreased after oxygen–glucose deprivation for 3 h
followed by 12 h incubation with neurobasal medium (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the cytotoxicity was signiﬁcantly attenuated by PE (2.5–40 μM)
treatment in a concentration-dependent manner. To further investigate
the protective effect of PE, apoptosis was estimated by ﬂow cytometric
analysis of annexin-V and propidium iodide-labeling cells. The
oxygen–glucose deprivation for 3 h followed by 12 h incubation with
neurobasal medium signiﬁcantly increased the apoptosis (Fig. 1B). PE
(2.5–40 μM) for 12 h arrested the apoptosis in a concentrationdependent manner.

Fig. 2. Piperlonguminine (PE) inhibited activation of NF-κB and MAPK in cultured SH-SY5Y
cells. SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with PE (20 μM) for 12 h and then incubated with TNFα (20 ng/ml) for 30 min. NF-κBp65 expression and p38MAPK expression were analyzed
by Western blot. #P b 0.01 vs. blank; *P b 0.01 vs. TNF-α stimulation in the absence of
PE. All the experiments were conducted in triplicate. Signiﬁcance was determined by
one-way ANOVA.

triplicate. Data are mean ± SEM, n = 15 for each group. #P b 0.01 vs. sham group;
*P b 0.01 vs. vehicle-treated animals. Signiﬁcance was determined by one-way ANOVA.

3.5. PE inhibited ischemia-induced NF-κB and p38 MAPK activation in rats
In order to investigate the molecular mechanism of PE, NF-κB activation and p38MAPK expression were both examined. Phosphorylation of
p38MAPK and NF-κB p65 and were signiﬁcantly increased in rats after
cerebral ischemia. However, PE treatment reduced phosphorylated
p38MAPK and NF-κB p65 levels, indicating that PE blocked NF-κB activation and p38MAPK expression in cerebral ischemia rats (Fig. 4).
4. Discussion
The experimental results proved that PE might protect against ischemic brain damage by improving neurological dysfunction, reducing infarct size and BBB permeability after MCAO. The underlying mechanism
of these neuro-protective effects might be involved in the inhibition of
NF-κB and p38MAPK.
It is well established that MCAO is a classical model of cerebral ischemia [12,13]. A growing body of evidence has implicated that inﬂammatory response plays key role in secondary ischemic brain damage, and
inﬂammatory response leads to ischemic brain damage, occurring within minutes after the onset of cerebral ischemia [14,15]. Accumulating
data suggest that NF-κB and p38MAPK are important transcription factors responsible for inﬂammatory response in stroke [16,17]. MAPKmediated upregulation of contractile ET(B) receptors in cerebral arteries
might be a pharmacological target for the treatment of smokeassociated cerebral vascular disease like stroke [16]. Anti-inﬂammatory
treatment reduces the ischemic brain diseases via down-regulating

MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways [16,17]. The activation of NF-κB
is up-regulated in ischemic stroke and contributes to cerebral injury induced by ischemia [18]. Inhibition of NF-κB activation attenuates inﬂammatory response [19]. Also, p38 MAPK pathway may promote BBB
disruption with secondary vasogenic edema after ischemia–reperfusion
injury and inhibitor of p38MAPK can result in a reduction in BBB
disruption, edema formation, and infarct volume [20]. Of particular
interest in this study is the identiﬁcation of molecular mechanism
by which PE inhibits ischemic stroke. PE is well known to possess
potent anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-platelet, anti-melanogenesis and antiinﬂammatory activities [21]. Our results showed that PE was also directly involved in the anti-inﬂammatory responses via NF-κB and MAPK in
experimental rat stroke.
In summary, the results of this study demonstrate that PE reduced
neurological deﬁcit scores, brain infarct volume and brain water content
in rats. Further data show that PE protects the brain against ischemic cerebral injury via alleviating blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown,
which may be mediated via inhibiting NF-κB and MAPK signaling
pathways. Our ﬁndings indicate that PE can be regarded as a potential
candidate for treatment of ischemic stroke.
