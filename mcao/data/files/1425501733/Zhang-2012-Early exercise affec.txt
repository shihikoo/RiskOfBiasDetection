Abstract: Increasing evidence shows that exercise training is neuroprotective after
stroke, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. To clarify this critical issue, the
current study investigated the effects of early treadmill exercise on the expression of
mitochondrial biogenesis factors. Adult rats were subjected to ischemia induced by middle
cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion. Expression of two genes critical for
transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor coactivator-1 (PGC-1) and nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1), were examined
by RT-PCR after five days of exercise starting at 24 h after ischemia. Mitochondrial
protein cytochrome C oxidase subunit IV (COX IV) was detected by Western blot.
Neurological status and cerebral infarct volume were evaluated as indices of brain damage.
Treadmill training increased levels of PGC-1 and NRF-1 mRNA, indicating that exercise
promotes rehabilitation after ischemia via regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis.

1. Introduction
Stroke is a major cause of mortality and dysfunction, as survivors often have physical and/or mental
disabilities [1], which cause an enormous burden. Although progress has been made in clarifying the
underlying mechanisms and developing therapeutic interventions in recent years, limited treatment
options are available for most types of stroke.
The beneficial effect of exercise on stroke rehabilitation has been demonstrated in animal models [2–5].
Exercise has been shown to decrease stroke risk factors, such as body weight, blood pressure, serum
cholesterol, and glucose intolerance. Increasing evidence indicates that exercise initiated early after
ischemia is associated with smaller brain infarcts, better neurological function, and higher survival
rates. While the positive effects of early exercise on functional outcome after stroke are widely
recognized, their underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
Over the past decades, animal studies have supported the role of exercise in accelerating the
rate of mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle [6,7]. However, few studies have investigated
this phenomenon in the brain. One recent study demonstrated altered mitochondrial biogenesis
(e.g., mitochondrial DNA, PGC-1, and citrate synthase) in mouse brain regions following eight weeks
of treadmill training [8]. Similarly, another rodent study demonstrated that exercise stimulates
mitochondrial biogenesis by increasing brain levels of PGC-1 protein via the sirtuin 1 pathway [9].
These studies confirmed that exercise can induce mitochondrial biogenesis in the brain, as well as in
skeletal muscle.
Conversely, others have hypothesized that mitochondrial biogenesis might occur naturally after
brain injury. Two reports provide evidence supporting this theory, demonstrating mitochondrial
biogenesis after hypoxic-ischemic (H-I) brain injury, which ameliorated the damage [10,11].
The authors observed significant changes in behavioral scores and cerebral infarct volume, as well
as increases in total mitochondria and levels of mitochondrial DNA, heat shock protein-60,
mitochondrial respiratory protein COX IV, and the mitochondrial transcription factors PGC-1, NRF-1,
and mitochondrial transcription factor A.
While mitochondrial biogenesis is known to be enhanced after exercise or H-I injury, the effects
of exercise on mitochondrial biogenesis after injury are unknown. The present study tested the
hypothesis that exercise can alleviate ischemic damage by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis.
Specifically, we investigated the effect of five days of post-ischemic exercise on neurological status,
expression of mitochondrial-specific transcription factors (PGC-1, NRF-1), mitochondrial protein
(COXIV) and infarct size.

2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Neurological Status
A seven-point neurological scale revealed that sham rats had no neurological symptoms. As shown
in Figure 1, the rats exposed to ischemia without exercise showed deficits (3.20 ± 0.71), while the rats
exposed to ischemia followed by 5 days of post-ischemia exercise demonstrated significantly better
neurological statuses (2.14 ± 0.51).

Sham animals all had scores of zero (data not shown). Relative to non-exercise controls,
the rats exposed to exercise had significantly lower neurological scores, indicating
improvement, * p < 0.05. Data represent mean ± SD. n = 6.

2.2. Cerebral Infarct Volume
None of the sham rats had infarcts. As shown in Figure 2, the rats exposed to ischemia had infarcts
(240 mm3 ± 26.75), while those exposed to ischemia plus exercise showed significantly reduced infarct
volume (165 mm3 ± 19.81).

volumes, p < 0.05. Data represent mean ± SD. n = 6.

2.3. Expression of Mitochondrial-Specific Transcription Factors
To determine the effect of exercise on mitochondrial biogenesis after MCAO, we measured the
mRNA levels of PGC-1 and NRF-1, which are regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis. As shown in
Figure 3, PGC-1 and NRF-1 mRNA expression significantly increased in the exercise group compared
to the ischemia without exercise and sham groups.
Figure 3. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of PGC-1 and NRF-1 mRNA in the cortex
ipsilateral to MCAO. Relative to non-exercise controls, the rats exposed to exercise had
significantly higher levels of mRNA for both mitochondrial biogenesis factors, p < 0.05.
Data represent mean ± SD and are normalized to GAPDH. n = 6.

2.4. Expression of Mitochondrial Protein
To get more evidence for exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis after MCAO, we also detected
expression level of mitochondrial protein. COXIV protein is the terminal enzyme on the mitochondrial
protein chain, which is only detected in mitochondrial inner membrane fraction. As shown in Figure 4,
COXIV protein expression was elevated in the exercise group compared to the other groups.

to controls, the rats in exercise group had significantly higher levels of COXIV. Optical
density values normalized to their respective GAPDH loading control were averaged ± SD
and graphed (relative expression). * p < 0.05, versus sham group respectively, # p < 0.05

2.5. Discussion
The current study investigated, for the first time, the effects of early treadmill exercise on
mitochondrial-specific transcription factors in an ischemic rat model. Five days of treadmill exercise
starting at 24 h after MCAO improved neurological function, enhanced mRNA expression of PGC-1,
NRF-1 and protein expression of COX IV and reduced lesion volume, relative to non-exercised ischemic
controls. These results suggest that early treadmill exercise might promote mitochondrial biogenesis
after ischemic injury, thus improving outcome.
Exercise training is well-established to protect against ischemia-induced brain injury [12–15]. In the
past, it was thought that patients should engage in post-stroke exercise training only when medically
stable. Recent animal and clinical studies have shown that early treadmill training after ischemia
can promote functional improvements without exacerbating neuronal tissue loss [16–18]. Previous
unpublished work from our lab also showed that very early physical rehabilitation starting 24 h after
ischemia yields significant neuroprotection and provides improved neurobehavioral recovery from focal
ischemic brain injury in rats. Mechanisms underlying this neuroprotection may include attenuation of
pro-inflammatory reactions, brain edema, blood-brain barrier damage, and cognitive and behavioral
deficits. In addition, the current study suggests an additional mechanism underlying the neuroprotective
effect of early exercise: regulating mitochondrial biogenesis.
In recent years, PGC-1has become one of the most widely-studied proteins in cellular metabolism.
It has been recognized as an important regulator of a wide variety of metabolic processes, including
mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal and cardiac muscle, as well as in the brain. PGC-1 initiates the
process of mitochondrial biogenesis, and the interaction between PGC-1 and NRF-1 is the first step of
this process [7,19–23]. NRF-1 binding sites are located within the promoters of multiple nuclear genes,
and interaction of NRF-1 at these sites initiates the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins, including
cytochrome c, components of the electron transport chain complexes, mitochondrial import proteins,
heme biosynthesis proteins, and mitochondrial transcription factor A, which is the final effector
necessary for the duplication of mitochondrial DNA [22,24].
In 2011, one study showed significant exercise-induced increases in PGC-1 mRNA expression in
the soleus muscle and in a majority of the brain regions, such as the brain stem, cortex, hippocampus,
hypothalamus, and midbrain [8]. Another group found that protein levels of sirtuin1 and PGC-1, which
were positively correlated with mitochondrial components, were upregulated in the hippocampus by
exercise [9]. NRF-1 mRNA and protein expression has also been shown to increase in a rat model
of neonatal H-I brain injury [10]. The current data, combined with the observed increased brain
mitochondrial DNA, other mitochondrial transcription factors, and mitochondrial protein expression,
confirm that mitochondrial biogenesis does indeed occur after brain injury. Furthermore, another
report observed neuroprotection associated with upregulation of PGC-1 and NRF-1 in mice subjected
to permanent MCAO, further supporting a role for mitochondrial biogenesis after ischemia.
However, no studies have yet examined the effects of exercise training on mitochondrial biogenesis
after brain ischemia. The present study observed significant increases in PGC-1 and NRF-1 expression
after five days of treadmill exercise initiated 24 h after ischemia. We also detected that levels of the
mitochondrial specific protein COX IV increased after exercise. In addition, a reduced infarct volume

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2012, 13

1675

and improved neurological function were observed in the exercise group. These data provide indirect
evidence that mitochondrial biogenesis may be induced by exercise initiated early after brain injury.
The present study has several limitations that should be noted. First, we did not determine the
amount of mitochondria and mtDNA. Second, the number of chosen mitochondria biomarker was on
the small side. Hence further comprehensive researches are warranted to confirm the conclusions
presented herein.
3. Experimental Section
3.1. Animals and Experimental Groups
Healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 250–280 g) were provided by the Shanghai Laboratory
Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and were housed on a 12:12 hour light/dark cycle with
free access to food and water. Animals were randomly assigned to three experimental groups: ischemia
with exercise, ischemia without exercise, or sham surgery. The exercise group ran on a rat treadmill
(DSPT-202 Type 5-Lane Treadmill; Litai Biotechnology Co., Ltd, China) for 30 min daily for five
days after ischemia (post-operation day 1 to 5). On post-operative day 1–2, treadmill velocity was
increased over ten-min intervals from 5 m/min to 9 m/min and finally 12 m/min. On post-operative day
3–5, treadmill velocity was 12 m/min for the full 30 min. The treadmill tilt angle remained at 0°
throughout the exercise paradigm. Rats in the ischemia without exercise and sham groups were not
exposed to the treadmill, but remained in their home cages.
3.2. Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO)
All groups were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, i.p.). Rectal temperature was
maintained at 37 °C throughout the procedure using a circulating heating pad. Ischemia was induced
by left MCAO, as previously described [25]. Briefly, to occlude the origin of the middle cerebral artery,
a 4-0 surgical nylon monofilament with a silicone tip was advanced from the external
carotid artery into the lumen of the internal carotid artery. After 60 min of cerebral ischemia, the filament
was withdrawn to allow reperfusion. Rats in the sham group underwent the same surgical procedure
without MCAO.
3.3. Evaluation of Neurological Status
Neurological status was assessed after recovery from anesthesia and again five days later using a
7-point scale, as previously reported [26]. Scores were assigned as follows: 0, no deficit; 1, failure to
extend right forepaw fully; 2, decreased grip of the right forelimb when held by tail; 3, spontaneous
movement in all directions, but torso turning to the right side when held by tail; 4, circling or walking
to the right; 5, walking only when stimulated; 6, no spontaneous activity; and 7, dead. Only rats with
scores of 2–4 after surgery were considered a successful model of ischemia and were randomly
assigned to the exercise or no exercise groups.

3.4. Measurement of Cerebral Infarction Volume
Infarct volume was analyzed by 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining [27]. Rats were
anesthetized with chloral hydrate (10%), and the brains were dissected, washed in PBS, and sliced into
2 mm sections. Sections were placed into 2% TTC in PBS at 37 °C for 30 min, and then the TTC
solution was replaced with 4% paraformaldehyde fixation buffer for 24 h. Sections were photographed
using a digital camera (DC240; Kodak, USA), and infarct size was determined from photographs using
NIH image analyzer software (NIH, USA).
3.5. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR
Animals were sacrificed after the treadmill exercise regimen ended, and total RNA was isolated
from samples of ipsilateral cortex using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The integrity and purity of the total RNA was examined by electrophoresis, and the absorbance ratio
was at 260 and 280 nm (A260/280). The first strand of cDNA was synthesized from 2–3 µg template
RNA using a reverse transcription kit purchased from Takara. RT-PCR of cDNA was performed (ABI
PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection System, Applied Biosystems) using the forward and reverse primer
sequences shown in Table 1. GAPDH served as an endogenous control. Target mRNA was normalized
to GAPDH expression using a comparative critical threshold (Ct) method in which the amount of
target was determined relative to the control sample after normalizing to the endogenous control.
Specifically, the relative fold change of the target gene expression was expressed as 2−ΔΔCt, where
ΔΔCt = ΔCttest animal − ΔCtcalibrator animal. Three animals in the sham group were randomly chosen to serve
as the calibrator sample. The ΔCt was defined as Cttarget − CtGAPDH.

3.6. Western Blotting
Ipsilateral cortical tissue was harvested 5 days after MCAO. Cortical protein extracts and
Western blotting analysis were performed as previously described [28]. Protein (40 μg) was separated
by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to PVDF membranes.
Primary antibodies were anti-COXIV (Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Cell Signaling Technology). Membranes were then washed
and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Quantification of band intensity
(optical density) was carried out on scanned Western blot images using ImageJ software from blots of
independent experiments.

3.7. Statistical Analysis
All values are reported as mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 13.0
statistical software. Multiple comparisons between groups were determined using one-way ANOVA
followed by Tamhane multiple comparison post hoc tests. Differences were considered statistically
significant at a level of p < 0.05.
4. Conclusions
Early treadmill exercise induced the expression of mitochondrial factors and protein after ischemic
injury, which may indicate mitochondrial biogenesis. While exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis
appears to be neuroprotective, the specific mechanisms are unclear. Elucidating these mechanisms could
suggest targets for treating ischemia-induced brain damage.
