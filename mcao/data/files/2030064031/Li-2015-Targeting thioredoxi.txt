Stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability
in developing countries. Oxidative stress caused by
reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a critical component
of cerebral ischemic injury (Tewari et al., 2014). Oxidative
damage can induce neuronal injury and necrosis in brain
tissue by oxidizing intracellular molecules such as lipids,
proteins, and DNA (Heo et al., 2005; Oztanir et al.,
2014). Therefore, it was thought that antioxidant agents,
which have the ability to scavenge ROS, could attenuate
neurological damage.
Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) is a 12-kDa ubiquitous protein
present in all living cells. It has a wide range of
physiological functions, including DNA synthesis,
oxidation damage repair, and regulation apoptosis (Lu
and Holmgren, 2012; Chang et al., 2013; Sengupta and
Holmgren, 2013). Recent study has demonstrated that
exogenous rhTrx-1 attenuates post-ischemic brain damage and neuronal apoptosis by reducing oxidative/nitrative stress (Ma et al., 2012). With thiol-reducing activity
at its conserved active site, Trx-1 exhibits cytoprotective
eﬀects against oxidative stress by scavenging ROS and
cooperating with peroxiredoxin (Prdx) (Das and Das,
2000; Lu and Holmgren, 2014).
Prdx is a general term that refers to a family of small
(22–27 kDa) non-seleno peroxidases, representing a
class of important antioxidants in mammals (Park et al.,
2014). In fact, Prdx, thioredoxin, and thioredoxin reductase form the mammalian thioredoxin system that plays
crucial roles in defending oxidative stress injury, especially typical 2-Cys Prdxs (Prdx1–4) (Zhu et al., 2012).
Therefore, elucidating the relationship between Trx-1
and Prdx1–4 in cerebral I/R injury is particularly important.
It is well acknowledged that enhanced ROS and
electrophiles can evoke a series of antioxidant genes by
activating nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2
(Nrf2), a critical transcription factor that regulates the
expression of major antioxidant enzymes and phase II
detoxiﬁcation enzymes (Motohashi and Yamamoto,
2004; Wang et al., 2014). Hemin has been shown to
induce activation of the thioredoxin gene by regulating
Nrf2 through the antioxidant responsive element (ARE)
in K562 cells (Kim et al., 2001). Moreover, the expression
of Nrf2 has been shown to be signiﬁcantly up-regulated in
the peri-infarct region and to subsequently induce Trx

Abstract—Reactive oxygen species and their detrimental
eﬀects on the brain after transient ischemia/reperfusion
(I/R) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemic
reperfusion injury. Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) is an endogenous
antioxidant protein that has neuroprotective eﬀects. We
hypothesized that Trx-1 plays a crucial role in regulating
cerebral I/R injury. To be able to test this, 190 Sprague–
Dawley rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion (tMCAO) with Trx-1 siRNA (small interference
RNA) injected 24 h prior to ischemia. At 24 h after tMCAO,
we measured neurological deﬁcits, infarct volume, and brain
water content, and found that neurological dysfunction,
brain infarct size, and brain edema were worse in the Trx-1
siRNA group than in the control group. Oxidative stress
was evaluated by measuring superoxide dismutase activity
and malondialdehyde level. The levels of Trx-1 and its cofactor, peroxiredoxin (Prdx), were signiﬁcantly decreased after
Trx-1 down-regulated. However, there is no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in the Prdx mRNA level after administration of
Trx-1 siRNA. In contrast, Prdx-SO3 protein levels were
signiﬁcantly increased in the Trx-1 siRNA group. We also
investigated the speciﬁc role of nuclear factor erythroid
2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in Trx-1 induction by knocking down
Nrf2. Nrf2 siRNA injection decreased Trx-1 mRNA and
protein expression. Our results suggest that the exacerbation of brain damage was associated with enhanced cerebral
peroxidation in brain tissues. Moreover, these results
revealed that Trx-1, which is more likely regulated by Nrf2,
exerts a neuroprotective role probably through maintaining
the reduction activity of Prdx1–4. Ó 2014 Published by

expression in male ICR mice following middle cerebral
artery (MCA) occlusion (MCAO) (Tanaka et al., 2011).
However, in spite of these various observations, the role
of Nrf2 in regulating Trx-1 gene expression in the context
of ischemic brain injury has yet to be fully investigated.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of
Trx-1 in ischemic injury using an experimental MCAO
model with Trx-1 knock-down. We evaluated whether
the Trx1 down-regulation could exacerbate brain
damage. Furthermore, we elucidated the relationship
between Trx-1 and Prdx1–4 in cerebral I/R injury.
Because our results highlight the importance of Trx-1 in
modulating the extent of brain damage, we have also
investigated the inﬂuence of Nrf2 on Trx-1 expression
level by interfering Nrf2 gene expression.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals and groups
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats, weighed 270–310 g
(n = 190, 36 died within 24 h) and aged 90 ± 4 d were
bred and held at the Experimental Animal Center of
Chongqing Medical University. All rats were allowed free
access to food and water before the operation under
optimal conditions (12/12-h light/dark with humidity
60 ± 5%, 22 ± 3 °C). All experimental animals were
randomly allocated to the following groups: sham surgery
group (n = 28, no died), untreated controls with MCAO
(n = 51, 9 died), scramble siRNA of Trx-1siRNA-injected
group (n = 37, 7 died), Trx-1 siRNA group (n = 41, 11
died), scramble siRNA of Nrf2siRNA-injected group
(n = 15, 3 died) and Nrf2 siRNA group (n = 18, 6 died).
All experimental procedures were carried out in
accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Chongqing Medical University, China.
Administration of Trx-1 siRNA and Nrf2 siRNA
Trx-1 siRNA (The sense primer 5-AAGCUCGAAGCCAC
UAUUATT-3 and antisense primer 5-UAAUAGUGGCUU
CGAGCUUTT-3), Nrf2 siRNA (The sense primer 5-CCC
UGUGUAAAGCUUUCAATT-3 and antisense primer
5-UUGAAAGCUUUACACAGGGTT-3) were designed and
chemically synthesized by GenePharma Corporation,
Shanghai, China. Scramble siRNA, which has the same
nucleotide composition of the target gene siRNA with no
sequence homology to any known rat genes was used
as the control. All siRNAs were dissolved in RNase-free
water, making the ﬁnal concentration 2 lg/ll. Rats were
anesthetized with 3.5% chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, ip)
and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (Taimeng
Software, Chengdu, China). 10 ll of siRNA or scramble
siRNA was injected ipsilaterally into the left lateral
cerebral ventricle at 24 h prior to the induction of
MCAO, respectively. siRNA or scramble siRNA was
slowly injected into the left lateral ventricle over a
20-min duration using a Hamilton microsyringe with the
coordinates of 1.0 mm posterior to the bregma, 2.0 mm
lateral to the midline, and 4.0 mm ventral to the surface

of the skull under the guidance of a stereotaxic
instrument. The injection rate was 0.5 ll/min. After
injection, the needle was held in place for 5 min and
then removed slowly over 2 min.
Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) model
Transient focal cerebral ischemia was introduced into rats
by left MCA occlusion technique according to our previous
methods (Chen et al., 2012). In brief, a 4–0 monoﬁlament
nylon suture (Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co Ltd, Beijing,
China) with a rounded tip was inserted into the left internal
carotid artery through the common carotid artery stump
and gently advanced to occlude the MCA. After 60 min
of MCAO, the suture was removed to restore blood ﬂow.
The reperfusion was conﬁrmed by laser Doppler (Periﬂux
System 5000, Perimed AB, Stockholm, Sweden). The
same procedure was performed on sham-operated rats,
but the MCA was not occluded. Rats that did not show
neurological deﬁcits after reperfusion (neurological
score < 1) were excluded from the study, as well as
animals that died after ischemia induction. Rats that
showed neurological deﬁcits immediately after reperfusion (neurological score > 0) but were found to be experiencing skull base or subarachnoid hemorrhage were
also excluded from the study. Core body temperatures
were monitored with a rectal probe and maintained at
37 °C during the whole procedure.
Sample processing
All rats were sacriﬁced at 24 h after reperfusion, and the
brains were quickly removed to collect the cerebral
cortex for an analysis of oxidative stress assay, western
blotting, and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). A
4-mm coronal section was taken from the area perfused
by the MCA starting at 5 mm from the frontal pole.
Fresh cortical tissue was collected from the MCA
territory of the ischemic left hemisphere, frozen
immediately in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80 °C until
needed for further processing. Tissue samples from all
animals were analyzed individually.
Evaluation of neurological deﬁcit
Neurological deﬁcit scores were evaluated by an
examiner blinded to the experimental groups after 24 h
of reperfusion. The deﬁcits were scored on a modiﬁed
scoring system developed by Longa et al. (Longa et al.,
1989), as follows: 0, no neurological deﬁcits; 1, failure to
extend right forepaw fully; 2, circling to right; 3, falling to
right; 4, did not walk spontaneously and has depressed
levels of consciousness. The higher the neurological
deﬁcit score, the more severe the impairment is of motor
motion injury. Brains from these rats were analyzed for
water content, infarct volume, oxidative stress analysis,
western blot, and real-time qPCR.
Measurement of brain water content
Brain water content was measured using the standard wet–
dry method. Six rats in each group were anesthetized with
chloral hydrate and killed by decapitation at 24 h after

L. Li et al. / Neuroscience 284 (2015) 815–823

MCAO. The brains were rapidly removed and dissected
into the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. The
two hemispheres were immediately weighed on an
electronic balance to obtain the wet weight and then dried
in an oven at 100 °C for 24 h to obtain the dry weight.
Brain water content was calculated as follows: Brain
water content (%) = (wet weight  dry weight)/wet
weight  100%.
Infarct volume analysis
Ischemic infarct volume was measured as described
previously (Tureyen et al., 2004). For Cresyl Violet (CV)
staining, the slides were immersed in xylene for 30 min,
and then in 100%, 95%, and 70% ethanol and doubledistilled water for 5 min each. Next, the slides were
stained in 0.1% CV solution for 5 min and then brieﬂy
rinsed in double-distilled water. These were then dehydrated again in 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol for 1 min
each. The slices were placed in xylene for another
10 min and then coverslipped. The normal tissue was
stained blue whereas the infarct tissue did not stain and
appeared white. All the CV-stained sections were
scanned using a ﬂatbed scanner and the images were
stored as TIFFs. The non-ischemic and ischemic hemisphere infarct areas were measured using ImageJ
(ver1.37c, NIH) software. All four infarct area measurements were calculated with a 2-mm distance between
the slices. Using these measurements, the total infarct
volume was calculated for each brain. To compensate
for the eﬀect of brain edema, the corrected volume was
calculated using the following equation: Percentage
hemisphere lesion volume (% HLV) = {[total infarct
volume  (left hemisphere volume  right hemisphere
volume)]/right hemisphere volume}  100%.
Determination of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and
malondialdehyde (MDA) levels
Cortical tissues from 6 rats of each group were collected
at 24 h after MCAO. The samples were rinsed, weighed,
and then homogenized in 9 volumes of 9 g/l ice-cold
saline. Supernatant homogenate was collected after
centrifugation at 4000 rpm/min for 10 min at 4 °C. SOD
and MDA levels were measured using commercially
available assay kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering
Institute,
Nanjing,
China)
according
to
the
manufacturers’ instructions. SOD activity was measured
by the hydroxylamine method. Absorbance was
determined at 550 nm by spectrometry. The MDA level
was measured by the thiobarbituric acid method.
Absorbance was measured at 532 nm by spectrometry.
The content of protein in the supernatant was
determined by the Enhanced BCA Protein Assay Kit
(Beyotime, Jiangsu, China).
Western blot analysis
Left cortical samples were recovered and homogenized in
the RIPA buﬀer. Protein extracts were resolved by SDS–
PAGE and transferred onto nitro-cellulose membranes.
The membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk

containing 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl, 0.1%
Tween-20 (TBS-T) and then incubated at 4 °C overnight
with primary antibodies. The primary antibodies used and
their respective dilutions were as follows: rabbit polyclonal
antibody to Trx-1 (1:2000, AB9328, Millipore, Boston,
USA), rabbit polyclonal to Prdx1 (1:2000, ab59538,
Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), rabbit polyclonal to Prdx2
(1:2000, ab59539, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), rabbit
polyclonal to Prdx3 (1:2000, ab73349, Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA), mouse monoclonal to Prdx4
(1:2000, ab16943, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), rabbit
polyclonal to Prdx-SO3 (1:2000, ab16830, Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA), rabbit polyclonal to Nrf2 (1:1000,
ab31163, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), and mouse
monoclonal to GAPDH (1:500, TA-08, ZSGB-BIO,
Beijing, China). This step was followed by 2-h incubation
with respective HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies
(ZSGB-BIO,
Beijing,
China;
dilution
1:3000).
Chemiluminescence of protein bands was developed
using the ECL kit (Millipore, Temecula, California, USA).
The relative density of bands was scanned with imaging
densitometer (Bio-Rad, Foster City, CA, USA), and the
results were quantiﬁed using Quantity One 1-D analysis
software. GAPDH was used as an internal loading control.
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Total RNA from left cortical samples was isolated using the
RNAiso Plus reagent (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian,
China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
RNA content was assessed by A260/A280 ratio and
agarose gel electrophoresis prior to performing qPCR.
Equivalent amounts of RNA extracted from each sample
served as template for cDNA synthesis using the
PrimeScriptÒ RT reagent Kit With gDNA Eraser (Perfect
Real Time) (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China)
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Real-time qPCR analysis
qPCR was performed on a Bio-Rad CFX-96 Connect
Real-Time System (Bio-Rad, Foster City, CA, USA)
using TaKaRa SYBRÒ Premix Ex Taqä II (Tli RNaseH
Plus) (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China). The
primer sequences and amplicon sizes are listed in
Table 1. The data were analyzed using Bio-Rad CFX
Manager software (version 2.0). The expression levels
of the genes were normalized to GAPDH.
The optimized qPCR assays were carried out with
12.5 ll of SYBRÒ Premix Ex Taqä II (Tli RNaseH Plus),
2 ll of cDNA, 1-ll forward primer (10 lM), 1-ll reverse
primer (10 lM), and 8.5 ll of RNase-free water in a
total volume of 25 ll, making the ﬁnal primer
concentration 0.4 lM. Ampliﬁcation began with an initial
incubation at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 40 cycles of
denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s and annealing and
extension at 58 °C for 30 s. A melting curve procedure
was added to the Bio-Rad CFX96 Connect Real-Time
System to analyze the speciﬁcity of the products.
Non-template controls containing all reagents except
cDNA was included in each PCR run. These controls
generated C(t) > 40 in all experiments. To determine

RESULTS

Statistical analysis

Trx-1 siRNA treatment aggravated neurologic deﬁcit
scores and cerebral tissue outcomes following
transient MCAO

All data are expressed as mean ± S.E.M. The
diﬀerences among various groups were analyzed by a
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
Student–Newman–Keuls for multiple comparisons. The
neurological deﬁcit scores were analyzed by Mann–
Whitney U test. A probability level of less than 0.05 was
considered to be statistically signiﬁcant. The statistical
software package SPSS18.0 was used.

Treatment with Trx-1 siRNA signiﬁcantly increased
neurological scores (Fig. 1A) and brain water content
(Fig. 1B) compared to MCAO group and scrambled
siRNA-treated animals. No signiﬁcant diﬀerence in brain
water content was observed in contralateral hemispheres.
In addition, treatment with Trx-1 siRNA also signiﬁcantly
increased infarct volume compared to MCAO group and
scrambled siRNA-treated animals (Fig. 1C, D).

Fig. 1. Eﬀects of Trx-1 siRNA on neurologic deﬁcit, brain water content and brain infarct volume. (A) Neurologic deﬁcit scores in the MCAO group
were signiﬁcantly higher than those in the Sham group, but the scores after injection with Trx-1 siRNA were higher than those in the MCAO group.
(B) The diﬀerences in the brain water content of ipsilateral hemispheres among groups followed the same trend as that of the neurological scores.
No statistical diﬀerence was observed in contralateral hemispheres (p > 0.05). (C) No ischemic lesion was found in the sham group. The infarct
volume in Trx-1 siRNA group was larger than that of the MCAO group. Quantiﬁcation of C is shown in D. The error bars represent mean ± standard
error of the mean (⁄p < 0.01 vs. Sham; #p < 0.01 vs. MCAO, ANOVA). Panel A: n = 20 in Sham group, n = 30 in other groups; Panel B and D:
n = 4 in Sham group, n = 6 in other groups.

Trx-1 siRNA aggravated oxidative stress in rats after
MCAO
The eﬀects of Trx-1 siRNA on the cortex SOD and MDA
levels of subjects are shown in Fig. 2. SOD activity in
the cortex was signiﬁcantly decreased in rats subjected
to I/R (Fig. 2A). Animals administered with Trx-1 siRNA
showed more reduction of SOD activity than the MCAO
group (25.31 ± 2.04 vs. 53.52 ± 5.11, p < 0.05).
Likewise, the cortex MDA level (Fig. 2B) was greater in
Trx-1 siRNA animals than that in the MCAO group
(9.58 ± 0.24 vs. 7.03 ± 0.73, p < 0.05).
Trx-1 down-regulation modulates the expression of
Prdx1–4 and Prdx-SO3
To explore the impact of Trx-1 on the expression level of
Prdx1–4, Western blot and qPCR were performed. Trx-1
expression increased about 3 times at the protein level
after I/R (Fig. 3A) and twice at the mRNA level
(Fig. 4A). In the Trx-1 siRNA group, the level of Trx-1
was reduced to almost basal level. In parallel, Prdx1–4
levels were signiﬁcantly increased in the MCAO group
(Fig. 3E), however, these increases were prevented by
Trx-1 siRNA. In contrast, Western blot analysis using a
Prdx-SO3-speciﬁc antibody revealed that the level of

Fig. 2. Trx-1 siRNA exacerbated oxidative stress 24 h after focal
cerebral I/R injury in rats. (A) SOD activity in the MCAO group was
lower than that in the Sham group. The SOD activity was even lower
in the Trx-1 siRNA group. (B) MDA level in the Trx-1 siRNA group
was signiﬁcantly higher than that in the MCAO group. The error bars
represent mean ± standard error of the mean (⁄p < 0.05 vs. Sham;
#
p < 0.05 vs. MCAO, ANOVA). Panels A and B: n = 4 in Sham
group, n = 6 in other groups.

Prdx1–4 hyperoxidation was higher in the Trx-1 siRNA
group than in the MCAO group (Fig. 3C). Interestingly,
there was no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the
mRNA level of Prdx1–4 between the siRNA group and
MCAO group (Fig. 4B–E).
The expression of Trx-1 was suppressed upon
knockdown of Nrf2
Both western blot and qPCR results demonstrated that
with I/R, Nrf2, and Trx-1 levels are increased after 24-h
reperfusion (Figs. 5 and 6). In the MCAO group, Trx-1
was up-regulated to about 3.5 times (Fig. 5C). The
expression of Trx-1 was suppressed even less than
normal level following Nrf2 knockdown. This was not
observed when the scramble siRNA was injected. The
variation in the mRNA level of Trx-1 was similar to that
of its protein level (Fig. 6B).

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we have demonstrated elevation in
the expression of Trx-1 in the cortex after cerebral I/R.
Trx-1 silencing, on the contrary, eﬀectively weakened
this I/R-induced Trx-1 elevation in the brain tissues.
Trx-1 down-regulation was associated with reduction of
Prdx1–4 while it elevated Prdx-SO3 level in the brains of
siRNA-treated rats. Trx-1 silencing resulted in the
exacerbation of neurologic deﬁcits and increase in
cerebral infarction and brain water content. The
concomitant change in the antioxidant activity of Trx-1
was indicated by changes in the representative
endogenous antioxidant markers (SOD and MDA). In
addition to these observations, we also found a
reduction in Trx-1 level after Nrf2 knockdown.
This work reveals the role of Trx-1 through Prdx1–4 in
maintaining the balance of cellular redox homeostasis
after cerebral I/R. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study
demonstrating such involvement in the experimental
MCAO model. The signiﬁcance of the present work is
further supported by demonstrating that Trx-1 downregulation targets mechanisms of over-oxidation in brain
tissues during focal ischemic reperfusion.
Oxygen-derived free radicals have been implicated in
the pathogenesis of cerebral infarction after cerebral
ischemia (Chan, 1994; Jia et al., 2014). The Trx-1 system,
composed of NADPH, Trx reductase, Trx-1, and Prdxs, is
ubiquitous in all cells and involved in many redox-dependent signaling pathways. Trx-1 reduces protein disulﬁde
groups in cooperation with Trx reductase and NADPH. It
has reported that Trx-1 has radical scavenging activity
against singlet oxygen and H2O2-induced cytotoxicity in
in vitro assays (Cai et al., 2012; Goy et al., 2014). Takagi
observed an increase in both protein and mRNA levels of
Trx-1 in the penumbra during permanent MCAO in rats
(Takagi et al., 1998). Treatment with recombinant human
Trx-1 (rhTrx-1) attenuated ONOO and superoxide anion
formation in focal transient cerebral ischemia, thereby
diminishing oxidative/nitrative stress-induced neuronal
apoptotic cell death in the ischemic brain (Ma et al.,
2012). Moreover, C57BL/6 transgenic mice overexpressing human Trx1 are more resistant to various types of

Fig. 3. Western blot analysis of Trx-1, Prdx1–4, and Prdx-SO3 levels in the ischemic cortex after 24 h of reperfusion in rats. After I/R, Trx-1, and
Prdx1–4 levels were up-regulated. However, Trx-1 was eﬀectively down-regulated following administration of Trx-1 siRNA (panel B). Upon Trx-1
knockdown, Prdx1–4 protein levels decreased (panel F, G, H, I). In contrast, the level of Prdx-SO3, an oxidized form of Prdxs, in the group treated
with Trx-1 siRNA was higher than that in the MCAO group (panel D). Quantiﬁcation of A, C, and E is shown in B, D, F, G, H, and I, respectively. The

groups).

oxidative stress than control mice (Mitsui et al., 2002).
These results demonstrate the antioxidant capability of
Trx-1. In our experiment, neurologic deﬁcits were aggravated and cerebral infarction and brain water content
were increased after administration of Trx-1 siRNA. Moreover, Trx-1 down-regulation increased the level of MDA
product and decreased SOD activity, two typical markers
reﬂecting oxidative stress, after I/R. There is a possibility
that this exacerbation of oxidative stress injury in the brain
could be in part due to the aggravation of acute injury of
I/R brought about by Trx-1 siRNA injection prior to injury.
The antioxidant eﬀect of Trx-1 is determined by its
thiol-reducing activity at its conserved active site: CysGly-Pro-Cys (Lu and Holmgren, 2014). Trx-1 can directly
and independently quench singlet oxygen and scavenge
hydroxyl radicals; its most widely studied antioxidant
capacity has thus far centered on its co-operation with
the peroxide scavengers Prdxs (Bell and Hardingham,
2011). Prdxs is a group of enzymes that protect against
oxidation using a thiol-containing system. Overexpression
of Prdx enzymes in cultured neurons attenuates cell injury
caused by hypoxia and reoxygenation (Ichimiya et al.,

1997; Boulos et al., 2007). Moreover, intraventricular
administration of recombinant Prdx3 signiﬁcantly
decreased lipid peroxidation and attenuated neuronal
apoptosis in ischemia brain (Hwang et al., 2010). Our
present study also revealed an increase in the expression
level of Prdx after cerebral I/R. Previous studies have
demonstrated that typical 2-Cys Prdxs (Prdx1–4) use
Trx-1 as a donor of electrons to reduce the disulﬁde form
(Manevich and Fisher, 2005; Bell and Hardingham, 2011).
Chae et al. have shown in yeast that thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx) reduces peroxides with the use of electrons
provided by the Trx system (Trx, TR, and NADPH). This
work has also revealed that Prdx1, Prdx2, and Prdx3
can reduce peroxides in the presence of thioredoxin-1 in
rat tissues and cultured cells (Chae et al., 1994, 1999).
In accordance with the notion that typical 2-Cys Prdx
(Prdx1–4) exhibits antioxidant activity through Trx-1, we
observed a signiﬁcant reduction in Prdx1–4 after
treatment with Trx-1 siRNA in this study. However, without Trx-1, the expression of Prdx-SO3 was remarkably
up-regulated indicating hyperoxidation of Prdx1–4 cysteine. This ﬁnding also reveals a crucial role of Trx-1 in

Fig. 4. Trx-1 and Prdx1–4 mRNA levels as determined by real-time qPCR. The variation in Trx-1 gene expression was similar to that of its protein
expression (panel A). Interestingly, there was no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the transcriptional level of Prdx1–4 between siRNA group and
MCAO group (B, C, D, and E, p > 0.05). The error bars represent mean ± standard error of the mean (⁄p < 0.01 vs. Sham; #p < 0.05 vs. MCAO,
ANOVA, n = 4 in Sham group, n = 6 in other groups).

Fig. 5. Eﬀects of Nrf2 siRNA on the expression of Trx-1 in rats. Nrf2 expression level was elevated by about twofold at 24 h after reperfusion (panel
B). In the Nrf2 siRNA group, Nrf2 was signiﬁcantly decreased to less than its basal level. The expression of Trx-1 was elevated by about 3 times in
the MCAO group (panel D) but remarkably suppressed after Nrf2 knockdown. This change in the expression level in Trx-1 was similar to that of Nrf2.
Quantiﬁcation of A and C is shown in B and D, respectively. The error bars represent mean ± standard error of the mean (⁄p < 0.01 vs. Sham;

maintaining the reduction activity of Prdx1–4. Interestingly, no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the expression levels of Prdx1–4 genes was detected after
knockdown of Trx-1. This is probably because Trx-1
regulates Prdx1–4 at primarily at the protein level rather
than at the transcription level.
The transcriptional regulation of Trx-1 was further
explored in our experiment. Recent studies have reported
that Trx-1 is regulated by Nrf2-ARE in in vitro trials.
Moreover, Trx-1 expression can be transcriptionally
induced by hemin in K562 cells by regulating Nrf2/small
Maf complex to ARE, and Trx-1 is activated by tBHQ
through the Nrf2–ARE pathway (Kim et al., 2001, 2003).
Trx is not detectable in Nrf2-deﬁcient mouse embryo

ﬁbroblasts (MEFs) but constitutively expressed at a high
level in Keap1-deﬁcient MEFs and in SH-SY5Y cells treated
with sulforaphane (Niso-Santano et al., 2010). However,
there has been no study examining the relationship
between Trx-1 and Nrf2 in a cerebral I/R model. In line with
all the previous data, Nrf2 and Trx-1 levels were elevated
after cerebral I/R but decreased in Nrf2 knockdown rats.
This means that Nrf2 deﬁciency blocked the eﬀects of
I/R to induce Trx-1. It is possible to speculate that Trx-1
gene expression is partly regulated via the Nrf2 pathway.
This current study examined the neuroprotective
capability of Trx-1 against I/R injury. Our ﬁndings
suggest that Trx-1 is worth being considered in
designing therapeutic strategies against stroke.

Fig. 6. Eﬀects of Nrf2 siRNA on the transcriptional level of Trx-1. In
the MCAO group, Nrf2 and Trx-1 levels were up-regulated. Following
knockdown of Nrf2, the expression of Trx-1 was suppressed, which
was not observed in the scramble siRNA group. The error bars
represent mean ± standard error of the mean (⁄p < 0.01 vs. Sham;
#
p < 0.01 vs. MCAO, ANOVA, n = 4 in Sham group, n = 6 in other
groups).

CONCLUSIONS
Trx-1 silencing increased the production of ROS after
cerebral I/R which then worsened the extent of brain
damage. The increase in ROS levels may involve a
decrease in activated Prdx1–4. The suppression of
Prdx1–4 more likely stems from the knockdown of
Trx-1, in which its expression level is probably in part
regulated by Nrf2.
