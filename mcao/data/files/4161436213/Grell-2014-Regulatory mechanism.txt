Background and Purpose: Increased expression of endothelin receptor type B
(ETBR), a vasoactive receptor, has recently been implied in the reduced cerebral
blood flow and exacerbated neuronal damage after ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). The
study explores the regulatory mechanisms of ETBR to identify drug targets to
restore normal cerebral artery contractile function as part of successful
neuroprotective therapy.
Methods: We have employed in vitro methods on human and rat cerebral arteries
to study the regulatory mechanisms and the efficacy of target selective inhibitor,
Mithramycin A (MitA), to block the ETBR mediated contractile properties. Later,
middle cerebral artery occluded (MCAO) rats were used to substantiate the
observations. Quantative PCR, immunohistochemistry, western blot and wire
myograph methods were employed to study the expression and contractile
properties of cerebral arteries.
Results: Increased expression of specificity protein (Sp1) was observed in human
and rat cerebral arteries after organ culture, strongly correlating with the ETBR
upregulation. Similar observations were made in MCAO rats. Treatment with MitA,
a Sp1 specific inhibitor, significantly downregulated the ETBR mRNA and protein
levels. It also significantly reduced the ETBR mediated cerebrovascular contractility.
Detailed analysis indicated that ERK1/2 mediated phosphorylation of Sp1 might be
essential for ETBR transcription.
Conclusion: Transcription factor Sp1 regulates the ETBR mediated vasoconstriction
in focal cerebral ischemia via MEK-ERK signaling, which is also conserved in
humans. The results show that MitA can effectively be used to block ETBR mediated
vasoconstriction as a supplement to an existing ischemic stroke therapy.

Regulation of Endothelin Receptors in Ischemic Stroke

Introduction
Ischemic stroke causes tissue infarction and malfunction of neural networks in the
brain leaving patients with permanent disability and reduced cognitive sensory
motor function [1]. Stroke is primarily a vascular disorder that adversely affects
neurons [2]. In focal cerebral ischemia a larger part of brain tissue surrounding
the ischemic core, the penumbra, is salvageable given that the cerebral blood
circulation is promptly re-established [3]. Persistent ischemic cascades due to
changes in shear stress following ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) have been found to
increase certain contractile G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the cerebral
arteries and the associated brain tissue [4]. This has been documented in humans
after stoke as well as in experimental focal and global cerebral ischemia [4], [5]. In
particular, the expression levels of contractile endothelin receptors type A and
type B (ETAR and ETBR) are upregulated in cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells
and are speculated to play a pivotal role in the physiological and pathological
processes of the brain post-stroke. Upon endothelin-1 (ET-1) binding, the
endothelin receptors increase the contractile function of the cerebral arteries
thereby reducing the blood flow to the affected area of the brain. It results in
exacerbated neuronal damage. ET-1 is one of the most potent vasoconstrictors
that are shown to play a pivotal role in post-ischemic hypoperfusion. Increased
plasma levels of ET-1 have been documented in several stroke patients and it has
been shown to correlate with worst clinical outcome [6]. Unlike ETAR, which has
been implied in exacerbated neuronal damage [7], [8], the role of ETBR is not
clearly established. However, compelling numbers of evidences indicate that ETBR
might play an important role in post-ischemic hypoperfusion associated neuronal
damage [4]. Extensive research in this field has so far not yielded any clinically
effective neuroprotective agent; hence there is a need for the identification of new
compounds for stroke therapeutics. Re-establishing cerebral blood flow is a
crucial part of stroke therapeutics. Therefore we asked whether interfering with
ETBR-mediated vasoconstrictive properties to reestablish cerebral blood flow will
help neurons to recover from post ischemic-hypoperfusion. In order to answer the
question, understanding of the regulatory mechanism of ETBR becomes essential.
Hence the study is designed to identify agent(s) that could specifically inhibit
ischemia-induced smooth muscle ETBR expression without affecting the normal
contractile properties of cerebral arteries. In this study, using in vitro and in vivo
experimental methods, we show that Sp1 regulates the smooth muscle specific
expression of ETBR in the cerebral arteries of rodents and humans.
Phosphorylation of Sp1 by ERK1/2 might be crucial for the DNA binding to
initiate ETBR transcription. In addition, we show that MitA efficiently blocks the
ETBR upregulation to restore normal vascular contractile function after
ischemia-reperfusion.

Materials and Methods
Animal handling and ethics
All experiments were conducted in full compliance with the guidelines set forth in
the European Council’s Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals
Used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes. The experimental
procedures used in the study are approved by the Lund University Animal Ethics
Committee (M43-07). Regional Ethical Review Board in Lund, Sweden (LU-81801) approved the experiments on human cerebral arteries. The study conforms to
the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and subjects gave informed
written consent. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300-350 g were obtained
from Taconic, the Netherlands, and kept in standard housing conditions.

Chemicals and Reagents
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) contained L-glutamine (584 mg/
L) supplemented with penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml)
(Gibco BRL, Paisley, UK). The inhibitors MitA and U0126 were purchased from
Tocris and Sigma and dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 1 mM, and
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 10 mM, respectively. All general chemicals that are
used in the experiments were purchased from Sigma.

Transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) and
Mithramycin A treatment
Transient MCAO was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by inserting a
filament intraluminally as described by Memezawa et al. [9]. Anesthesia was
induced by 4.5% isoflurane in N2O:O2 (70:30). Thereafter the animals were kept
anesthetized by inhalation of 1–1.5% isoflurane in N2O/O2. To confirm proper
occlusion, a laser-Doppler probe (Perimed, Järfälla, Sweden) was fixed on the
skull (1 mm posterior to the bregma and 6 mm from the midline on the right
side) to measure the regional cortical blood flow. Physiological parameters were
measured before the occlusion and controlled within physiological limits. The
body temperature was maintained by a rectal temperature probe connected to a
homeothermic blanket set to maintain the body temperature at 37 ˚C. An
occlusion is ensured when there is a sharp drop (.70%) in the cerebral blood
flow as visualized by laser Doppler. Two hours after MCAO, in order to establish
reperfusion and normalization of blood flow, the filament was withdrawn by
briefly anaesthetizing the rats. At desired time points post-MCAO rats were
anesthetized and sacrificed by decapitation followed by isolation of middle
cerebral arteries (MCAs) from the brain. The left MCA that was not subjected to
cerebral ischemia served as control. Rats that did not show sharp drop in cerebral
blood flow were excluded from the study. For the treatment studies, MCAO rats
were divided into two groups, one group received intraperitoneal injection of
MitA (250 mg/kg in 300 ml) immediately after reperfusion and a second dose after
24 hours, while the other group received vehicle, PBS.

Ex vivo culturing of intact cerebral arteries
Ex vivo culturing of intact cerebral arteries were performed as described in detail
previously [10]. Segments (3–4 mm long, diameter 200–300 mm) were incubated
in serum-free Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium with or without inhibitors for
desired time points in a humidified CO2 incubator. Similar methods were
employed to culture human cerebral arteries obtained from four patients aged 55,
68, 51 and 22 while undergoing neurological surgery.

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis was performed according to the kit
manufacturers protocols respectively (Machery-Nagel, Düren, Germany and
Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Quantitative real time PCR was performed using
SYBR Green kit (Qiagen) on a CFX384 Real-Time System (Bio-rad) and
normalized to the housekeeping genes b-actin, GAPDH and EF1-a. All primers
were obtained from SAbiosciences (Qiagen).

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously [10]. 4%
paraformaldehyde fixed MCAs were embedded in Tissue-TEK (Sakura Finetek
Denmark ApS, Copenhagen, Denmark) and sectioned into 10 mm thick
cryosections (Microm HM500 M; Thermo Scientific, Walldorf, Germany). On
each microscope slide three sections were collected (Menzel-Gläzer,
Braunschweig, Germany). Mounted sections were permeabilized in phosphate
buffer solution (PBS) containing 0.25% Triton X-100 for 15 min and blocked
1 hour in blocking buffer containing PBS, 0.25% TritonX-100, 1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) and 5% normal donkey serum, and then incubated with the
following primary antibodies overnight at 4 ˚C: Sheep anti-ETBR, 1:250, (Enzo life
sciences, ALX-210-506A-C250), rabbit anti-Sp1, 1:250, (Millipore, 07-645), rabbit
anti-phopho-Sp1(T739), 1:250 (Sigma, SAB4300670), goat anti-SM22, 1:500
(Abcam, ab10135). Sections were subsequently incubated 1 hour at room
temperature in dark with respective secondary antibodies conjugated with
fluorochromes (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Europe Ltd., Suffolk, UK) diluted
1:250 in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100, 1% BSA and 3% normal donkey
serum. The sections were washed with PBS, mounted with anti-fading Vectashield
mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) and
visualized using an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon 80i; Tokyo, Japan). Similar
procedure was carried out for the negative controls except the primary antibody
step.

Western blots
Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously [11]. Cerebral
arteries were lysed by sonication on ice in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4,

1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mg/ml each
leupeptin, antipain, chymostatin, and pepstatin A) and centrifuged (15min,
14,0006g). For Western blot analysis 15–20 mg protein was separated by a 4–12%
gradient SDS-PAGE (RunBlue, Expedeon, Cambridgeshire, UK) and transferred
to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Bioscience, Freiburg,
Germany). The membrane was blocked with 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline
(TBS)/0.2% Tween for 1 hour at room temperature and incubated overnight with
the primary antibodies at 4 ˚C. The following antibodies were used in the
experiments: Anti-sheep ETBR (Enzo Life Sciences, ALX-210-506A-C250), 1:1000,
anti-rabbit Sp1 (Millipore, 07-645), 1:1000, phospho-Sp1, T453 (Abcam,
ab59257), 1:1000, anti-rabbit ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA,
USA, #9102), 1:2000, anti-rabbit phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology,
#9101), 1:1000, anti-mouse Actin (Abcam, ab11003), 1:1000, and anti-goat
b-Actin (Abcam, ab8229), 1:1000. Membranes were washed four times with TBS/
0.02% Triton X-100 and incubated with the respective HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody for 1 hour at room temperature (Pierce/Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL,
USA). After extensive washing, the proteins were visualized by enhanced
chemiluminescent staining using ECL reagents (Amersham Bioscience).

In vitro pharmacology
Contractile responses of rat cerebral arteries were measured by recording
isometric tension in a Mulvany Halpern myograph (Danish Myo Technology A/S,
Aarhus, Denmark). Vessel segments were mounted in a temperature-controlled
tissue bath (37 ˚C) using two stainless steel wires (40 mm), then stretched to 90%
of the normal internal circumference, which is equivalent to a relaxed vessel that is
under a transmural pressure of 100 mmHg. Contraction induced by 60 mM K+
was considered as reference for maximal contractile capacity of the vessel.
Endothelial function was evaluated by inducing contraction by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, 0.3 mmol) followed by addition of carbachol (10 mmol) to relax the
vessel. Concentration curves for various contractile receptors were obtained by
cumulative addition of agonists: Sarafotoxin 6c (S6c) was used as selective
endothelin receptor B agonist (10214 to 3?1027 mol/L) and ET-1, an endothelin
receptor A and B agonist, was used in the presence of BQ788 which is a selective
ETB receptor inhibitor (10214 to 3?1027 mol/L).

Results

ETBR in rat cerebral arteries
MCAO was performed for 120 minutes followed by 48 hours of reperfusion.
Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out to evaluate the expression of Sp1
and ETBR in the right MCA (RMCA, occluded side) and left MCA (LMCA, nonoccluded side). We noted an increased Sp1 immunoreactivity, primarily in

vascular smooth muscle cells of the MCA on the occluded side, correlating with
the increased expression of ETBR (Fig. 1A). Fluorescence intensity measurements
of the sections showed a significant increase in the expression of both proteins
(Fig. 1B). An in vitro method, where the cerebral arteries were cultured in serumfree medium for a defined period of time, was employed to further study the
regulatory mechanism of the receptor. The method is shown to mimic several of
the vascular changes during focal cerebral ischemia [12]. This method is in general
used for detailed analysis of molecular alterations in the vessel walls. Similar to the
observations in cerebral arteries after MCAO, western blot analysis showed a

notable increase in the expression of Sp1 and ETBR in cerebral arteries cultured
for 24 hours (Fig. 1C). We noted two reactive bands in the blots for Sp1 and
ETBR, indicating that the proteins might have undergone post-translational
modification or are expressed in their respective isoforms [13], [14]. Quantitative

PCR analysis after 6 hours culturing showed a significant increase in the ETBR
mRNA and an inverse correlation between Sp1 mRNA and protein was observed
(P,0.01, Fig. 1D). With immunohistochemistry we noted increased immunoreactivity for Sp1 in the smooth muscle cell layer of cultured MCAs supporting the
western blot observation (Fig. 1E and fig. S1). Sp1 was primarily localized in the
nucleus of the vascular smooth muscle cells. Such changes in the Sp1 protein
expression without increased levels of mRNA indicate that Sp1 is probably
regulated by cap-independent translation mechanisms [15].

Inhibition of transcription factor Sp1 downregulates ETBR
expression in rat and human cerebral arteries
DNA foot printing studies have shown that Sp1 competitively binds to GC rich
motifs of various promoters [16]. MitA has been shown to selectively displace Sp1
from its binding site to inhibit the transcriptional activity [17, 18]. Therefore, the
effect of Sp1 inhibition on ETBR upregulation was investigated by culturing
cerebral arteries in the presence or absence of MitA. Western blot analysis showed
a notable reduction in the ETBR expression of cerebral arteries cultured with MitA
(5 mM). Among the two reactive bands for ETBR, expression of one band was
notably reduced indicating a possible isoform-specific inhibition by MitA. Similar
trend was observed in the expression pattern of Sp1 in the presence of MitA
(Fig. 2A). Intensity measurements of the protein expression levels of Sp1 and
ETBR are significantly altered in the presence or absence of MitA after organ
culture (P,0.05) (Fig. 2B and C). Quantitative PCR analysis showed a significant
reduction in the ETBR mRNA upon treatment (P,0.05) while the expression of
Sp1 mRNA remained unaffected (Fig. 2D and E). In conjunction, immunohistochemical analysis showed a marked reduction in ETBR expression in MCAs
incubated with MitA (Fig. 2F). No significant reduction in the expression of Sp1
was observed as MitA is expected to competitively displace Sp1 from the DNA not
the protein expression. However, when compared to MCAs cultured in absence of
the inhibitor, MitA-treated arteries showed a diffused Sp1 staining pattern, which
probably is due to its displacement and subsequent degradation of the protein
(Fig. 2F).
Since the human ETBR promoter is shown to contain a unique binding site for
Sp1 proximal to the transcriptional start site, we evaluated the relevance of our
findings in human cerebral arteries. Due to the difficulties in obtaining stroke
specimens, the organ culture method was chosen to validate the findings in
normal human cerebral arteries. Cerebral arteries were cultured in the presence or
absence of MitA for 24 hours. Supporting the rodent in vivo and in vitro data, a
prominent increase in the ETBR expression was found correlating with the nuclear
expression of Sp1 (Fig. 2G). In the presence of MitA, we observed a notable
reduction in the smooth muscle cell specific expression of ETBR and the change in
the Sp1 expression was less or not significant. These results are in line with the
observations made in the rat MCAs. To demonstrate that Sp1 and ETBR
expression is in the smooth muscle cells of MCAs, we stained human cerebral

arteries with smooth muscle action 22 (SM22), a specific marker for muscle cells
(See figure S1). Taken together figures 2G and S1 give clear indications that Sp1
and ETBR are expressed in the SMCs of MCA.

Phosphorylation of Sp1 by ERK1/2 is pivotal for the ETBR
transcription
Transcription factor Sp1 mediates signal transduction either by multiple protein
interaction or by posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation [19].
Studies have demonstrated that ERK1/2 directly phosphorylates Sp1 on threonine
453 (T453) and 739 (T739) in vitro and in vivo [20]. Hence, the status of
phosphorylated Sp1 (p-Sp1) and ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) was evaluated at various
time points in culture conditions. Western blot analysis showed that vascular
ERK1/2 is activated as early as 5 min after initiating the incubation. When the
blots were probed for phosphorylated Sp1 at T453, a known ERK1/2 target, we
found that Sp1 could be phosphorylated within 5 minutes of ERK1/2 activation
(Fig. 3A, B and C). Intensity measurements of those blots showed time dependent

increase of p-Sp1 levels correlating with the increased p-ERK1/2 but not
statistically significant (Fig. 3A and B). To substantiate the phosphorylated status
of Sp1, sections of organ cultured MCAs were immunohistochemically analyzed
for phospho-T739, another ERK1/2 target. It showed an increased immunoreactivity for phospho-T739. These observations suggest that the phosphorylation
of T453 and T739 could be essential for the nuclear translocation and DNA
binding function of Sp1 (Fig. 3D). Even though the intensity measurements of
immunoblots indicated that p-Sp1 levels slowly decrease over time, we still
observed sustained basal level of p-Sp1 up to six hours in culturing conditions
(data not shown). The observation of ERK1/2 activation is in line with the
previous studies indicating that MEK-ERK signaling is essential for ETBR
upregulation [10], [21]. Taken together these observations suggest that ERK1/2
mediated phosphorylation of Sp1 could be essential for the ETBR transcription.

Sp1 transcription factor regulates ETBR expression and vascular
function in rat MCAs
Next we asked whether the inhibition of Sp1 with MitA could restore normal
vascular contractile function by preventing the increase in ETBR-mediated
vasoconstriction after in vivo; stroke and in vitro; organ culture. Changes in the
contractile properties of MCA were investigated using an ETBR specific agonist,
S6c, in a wire myograph system. The MCAs were cultured with and without
varying concentrations of MitA for 24 hours in serum-free conditions. MCAs
treated with MitA showed significant reduction in the contractile responses to S6c

compared to vehicle-treated MCAs (Fig. 4A). A 2 mM concentration of the
inhibitor was sufficient to bring noticeable reduction in ETBR-mediated
contraction. A 5 mM concentration was sufficient to bring the S6c contraction to
the basal level of contraction as evidenced in fresh MCAs (P,0.05, Fig 4A).
Meanwhile, up to 10 mM of MitA, contractile responses mediated by ETAR
remained unaltered suggesting that Sp1 specifically interferes with the ETBR
regulation (Fig 4B).
The findings from MitA inhibition and Sp1-regulated ETBR vasoconstriction of
rat MCAs in vitro were then validated in experimental stroke. A profound decrease
in the vascular smooth muscle ETBR receptor expression was observed after
treatment with MitA (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, MitA treatment significantly
prevented the ischemia-induced ETBR mediated vasoconstriction compared to

vehicle treated rats (P,0.001, Fig 5B). In addition, confirming the in vitro data,
MitA treatment did not significantly alter the contractile function mediated by the
ETAR in MitA treated rats compared to vehicle treated rats indicating that MitA
might be specifically interfering with the ETBR transcription mechanism
(Fig. 5C). Taken together these results indicate that MitA could serve as a
potential pharmacological agent to block ETBR mediated cerebrovascular
contraction after I/R.

Discussion
Stroke is a vascular disease; hence functionally intact cerebral arteries are essential
criteria for any kind of successful neuroprotective therapy. Cerebrovascular
receptors play a pivotal role in keeping the vascular function intact. These
receptors are deregulated upon ischemic insult to the brain and contribute to the
occurrence of persistent cascade of ischemic events after I/R that results in
exacerbated neurological damage [22, 23]. Recent studies have demonstrated that
the smooth muscle cell specific expression of ETBR might play a pivotal role in I/R
mediated constriction of cerebral arteries [10, 24]. In this study we documented a
significant increase in the Sp1 (transcription factor) expression in the vascular
smooth muscle cells of MCAs, coinciding with increased expression of ETBR after
I/R (Fig. 1A and B). Sp1 is a zinc finger-containing DNA binding protein, which
can activate or repress transcription upon DNA binding. Previous studies have
shown that inhibition of Sp1 with MitA is neuroprotective [25, 26]. Based on the
correlation between the Sp1 mRNA and protein expression we suggest that the
Sp1 expression is regulated by a probable ‘‘cap independent translation
mechanism’’ where translation occurs with the existing mRNA through an
internal ribosomal entry site (Fig 1C, D and E). The Sp1 mRNA has been shown
to contain such internal ribosomal entry sites [15]. In addition based on our
observations, we speculate that Sp1 might undergo post-translational modification to regulate the gene expression. Such modifications might be essential for its
DNA binding, protein stability and the ability of Sp1 to interact with other
proteins as indicated by previous studies [14, 20, 27]. In this context direct
phosphorylation of Sp1 at T453 and T739 by ERK1/2 in vitro and in vivo has been
shown to be pivotal for its transcriptional activity [20]. Our in vitro studies
showed that both target amino acids are phosphorylated by ERK1/2 indicating
that Sp1 is a downstream target of ERK1/2 (Fig 3). This observation is in
agreement with previous studies showing ERK1/2 inhibition blocking ETBR
upregulation [10, 21]. Even though the post-translational modification (phosphorylation) is not statistically significant, we strongly believe such smaller
changes might be sufficient to induce significant changes in gene expression
pattern contributing to the changes in phenotype.
As a next step we employed Sp1 inhibitor MitA, to test the role of Sp1 on ETBR
transcription in vitro. Treatment with MitA resulted in down regulation of ETBR
expression and restoration of contractile properties that are similar to non-

cultured MCAs (Fig. 2 and 4A). Most notably, the inhibitor did not alter
responses mediated by ETAR or the total contractile response to high potassium
buffer as well as high concentrations of MitA (10 mM, data not shown), indicating
that MitA is target specific (Fig 4B). This observation is in agreement with the
reports suggesting that MitA does not affect global protein synthesis with a special
emphasizing on the specificity of the agent [26, 28]. As a next step the study was
extended to human cerebral arteries to test the clinical relevance of the findings.
When human cerebral arteries were treated with MitA, in culture conditions, we
observed a significant reduction in the ETBR expression. As substantiation, the
ETBR mediated contractile properties were validated in MCAO rats after MitA
treatment. A significant reduction in the ETBR mediated cerebrovascular
contractility was evidenced in the treated MCAO rats. Taken together our study
indicates that ERK1/2 and Sp1 could serve as potential pharmacological targets in
aiding focal cerebral ischemia treatment. Preclinical studies with MEK inhibitor
U0126 have indicated that the inhibitor is the most effective when treated
immediately after I/R [29]. Due to the robustness of ERK1/2 activation, the U0126
becomes ineffective if treated few hours after I/R. Since Sp1 is acting further
downstream of ERK1/2, it becomes an attractive target for the treatment of ETBR
mediated vasoconstriction and associated complications. However, in order to
establish MitA as a potential agent, a long-term preclinical study is essential to
document the impact of the agent on the inflammatory cytokines, improvement
in stroke volume and positive neurological outcome. A detailed toxicology report
of MitA is readily available and it has been used in humans to treat number of
malignancies [30],[31]. Therefore, given that MitA has a significant positive
impact on the above-mentioned parameters, the compound can quickly be
available for clinical trials.
In conclusion, this study has unraveled the regulatory mechanism involved in
the augmented expression of ETBR after cerebral ischemia. We demonstrate that
the cerebrovascular specific increase of ETBR is regulated by the transcription
factor, Sp1 and suggest that ERK1/2 mediated phosphorylation of Sp1 could be
essential for the initiation of ETBR transcription.
