Brain ischemia downregulates the neuroprotective
GDNF-Ret signaling by a calpain-dependent
mechanism in cultured hippocampal neurons

The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has an important role in neuronal survival through binding to the GFRα1
(GDNF family receptor alpha-1) receptor and activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret. Transient brain ischemia alters the
expression of the GDNF signaling machinery but whether the GDNF receptor proteins are also affected, and the functional
consequences, have not been investigated. We found that excitotoxic stimulation of cultured hippocampal neurons leads to a
calpain-dependent downregulation of the long isoform of Ret (Ret51), but no changes were observed for Ret9 or GFRα1 under the
same conditions. Cleavage of Ret51 by calpains was selectively mediated by activation of the extrasynaptic pool of N-methylD-aspartate receptors and leads to the formation of a stable cleavage product. Calpain-mediated cleavage of Ret51 was also
observed in hippocampal neurons subjected to transient oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), a model of global brain ischemia,
as well as in the ischemic region in the cerebral cortex of mice exposed to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Although the
reduction of Ret51 protein levels decreased the total GDNF-induced receptor activity (as determined by assessing total phosphoRet51 protein levels) and their downstream signaling activity, the remaining receptors still showed an increase in phosphorylation
after incubation of hippocampal neurons with GDNF. Furthermore, GDNF protected hippocampal neurons when present before,
during or after OGD, and the effects under the latter conditions were more significant in neurons transfected with human Ret51.
These results indicate that the loss of Ret51 in brain ischemia partially impairs the neuroprotective effects of GDNF.

Neuronal injury induced by brain ischemia is partly owing to an
excessive release of excitatory amino acids followed by toxic
overactivation of glutamate receptors (excitotoxicity).1–3 The
subsequent increase in [Ca2+]i activates Ca2+-dependent
proteolytic enzymes (e.g., calpains), which contribute to
ischemic neurodegeneration.4–6 The extrasynaptic N-methylD-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) for glutamate are preferentially coupled to the activation of excitotoxic signaling
mechanisms, including the activation of calpains, and were
therefore suggested to have a key role in neuronal death.7–9
The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)
protects neurons from excitotoxicity-induced cell death10–13
and from ischemic damage.14–16 GDNF dimers bind to GFRα1
(GDNF family receptor alpha-1) with a high affinity, and this
complex signals through the transmembrane Ret receptor
tyrosine kinase.17,18 The Ret receptor pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced in three isoforms that differ in the composition and
length of the C-terminus tail. Once activated by the complex

GDNF–GFRα1, Ret isoforms undergo transphosphorylation on
several tyrosine residues, activating the Ras/mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/
AKT, responsible for cell survival or differentiation, and the
phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ) pathway.19–23
Cerebral ischemia is known to alter the expression of the
GDNF signaling machinery.16 Thus, the GDNF mRNA and
protein were both found to be upregulated in experimental
models of transient focal and global ischemia.16,24–26 An
increased expression of the mRNA for GFRα124,27 and
Ret27,28 was observed in damaged areas after transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), a model of focal
ischemia, and an upregulation of GFRα1 mRNA was also
observed in the hippocampus following transient global
ischemia in rats.26 However, whether GFRα1 and Ret protein
levels are altered in transient brain ischemia, the impact on
their signaling activity and the functional consequences, have
not been investigated. In this work, we show that the Ret51

protein is selectively downregulated following excitotoxic
injury and in brain ischemia, by a calpain-dependent mechanism, with a consequent decrease in GDNF signaling activity.
This loss of Ret51 receptors impairs the neuroprotective
effects of GDNF after transient in vitro ischemia.
Results
Ret51 is downregulated after excitotoxic stimulation. To
investigate the effects of excitotoxic stimulation on the
expression levels of the proteins that assemble to form
functional GDNF receptors, rat hippocampal neurons (7 days
in vitro (DIV)) were challenged with glutamate (125 μM, 20
min) and further incubated in culture-conditioned medium for
different time periods. Under these conditions, glutamate
evokes 40–50% of apoptotic-like cell death.6,29 The effect of
excitotoxic stimulation on the protein levels of GFRα1 and Ret
isoforms was determined by western blotting (intracellular
epitope of Ret51 and Ret9; Figure 1a). Glutamate stimulation
downregulated the expression of Ret51 in a time-dependent
manner, with a t1/2 of 4.09 h (Figure 1b), and maximal effects
were observed at 8–10 h after the insult (Ret51 decreased to
~ 25% of the control). No significant changes were observed
in Ret9 and in GFRα1 protein levels under the same
conditions (Figures 1d and e).
To understand the role of glutamate receptor subtypes in the
downregulation of Ret51 under excitotoxic conditions, we
tested the effect of APV (DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric
acid) and CNQX (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) that
block NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptors, respectively.
Incubation with APV alone reduced the glutamate-evoked
downregulation of Ret51 to ~ 80% of the control, and coincubation with APV and CNQX fully blocked the effect of
excitotoxic stimulation on total Ret51 protein levels (Figure 1c).
Ret51 is cleaved after excitotoxic stimulation by a
calpain-dependent mechanism. To determine the mechanisms (degradation/cleavage) inducing Ret51 downregulation,
we performed complementary western blot experiments
using an antibody against an extracellular (EC) epitope of
Ret (Figure 1a) and cultured hippocampal neurons transfected with the human Ret51 fused intracellularly to green
fluorescent protein (GFP; hRet51-GFP). Although the antibody did not detect the rat Ret9/51, a band corresponding
to an apparent molecular weight of ~195 kDa was detected
in hippocampal neurons transfected with hRet51-GFP
(Figure 2a). Excitotoxic stimulation of hippocampal neurons
transfected with hRet51-GFP induced a time-dependent
accumulation of a cleavage product migrating at ~ 115 kDa
(Figure 2a), containing the EC domain of the receptor,
suggesting that the protein is cleaved in the intracellular
region. Using an anti-GFP antibody, we did not detect the
cleavage product containing GFP (not shown), suggesting
that following excitotoxic stimulation with glutamate the
intracellular fragment of Ret51 is degraded.
To determine the role of calpains in Ret51 downregulation in
hippocampal neurons subjected to excitotoxic stimulation, the
cells were incubated with glutamate in the presence or in the
absence of the calpain inhibitors ALLN (N-acetyl-Leu-LeuCell Death and Disease

Norleu-al) or MDL28170 (carbobenzoxy-valinyl-phenylalaninal).
Both inhibitors abrogated glutamate-evoked downregulation
of Ret51 (Figure 2b). Furthermore, MDL28170 inhibited the
cleavage of hRet51-GFP in transfected hippocampal neurons
subjected to excitotoxic injury (Figure 2c). These results
indicate that excitotoxic stimulation induces Ret51 cleavage
through calpain activation.
Using the GPS-CCD (group-based prediction systemcalpain cleavage detector) program30 for prediction of calpain
cleavage sites, we found that the sites with the highest score in
the C-terminus of human and rat Ret proteins are the following:
Asn7634Ala10194Ala10204Phe6764Lys7484Leu7744
Ser6864Ser837 (arrows in Figure 2d). As it was proposed
that calpains cleave their substrates in rather disordered
segments of the proteins,31 we used the metaPrDOS
bioinformatic tool to predict the disorder tendency along the
intracellular domain of Ret (rat Ret9, rat Ret51, human Ret51)
sequences.32 The results showed that Ret proteins are more
disordered in four segments of their C-terminus (amino acids
in the rat Ret51 sequence: 664–711, 824–845, 1015–1087
and 1104–1115; Figure 2d). The first, second and third
segments include the predicted calpain cleavage sites. The
data shown in Figures 2a and c, together with the bioinformatic
analysis, suggest that the human Ret51 may be cleaved on
Phenylalanine676, giving rise to a fragment (containing the
N-terminus of the receptor) with an apparent molecular weight
of 115 kDa (Figures 2a and c).
As Ret can be degraded by the proteasome,33,34 we tested
whether this pathway could also account for the downregulation of Ret51 in hippocampal neurons subjected to
excitotoxic stimulation. Inhibition of the proteasome with
clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (β-lactone) was without effect on
the glutamate-evoked decrease in endogenous Ret51
(Figure 2e). Similarly, no effect was observed on the downregulation of hRet51-GFP in transfected hippocampal neurons
subjected to excitotoxic injury (Figure 2f), ruling out a
contribution of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in Ret51
cleavage. Control experiments showed a dose-dependent
downregulation of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome and an upregulation in polyubiquitin-conjugated proteins in hippocampal neurons incubated with β-lactone
(Supplementary Figure 1).
Although caspase-3 can also cleave Ret receptors,35 this is
unlikely to contribute to the downregulation of Ret51 under
excitotoxic stimulation with glutamate given the low activity of
the protease under these conditions29 (authors unpublished
observations) and the effect of calpain inhibitors, which fully
abrogated the glutamate-evoked downregulation of Ret51
(Figures 2b and c).
Ret51 is targeted by calpain following activation of
extrasynaptic NMDAR. Activation of extrasynaptic NMDAR
is selectively coupled to the induction of intracellular
mechanisms distinct from those triggered by synaptic
receptors.8,36 As activation of NMDAR is specifically linked
with Ret51 cleavage due to calpain activation (Figure 1c), we
examined the differential effects of synaptic and extrasynaptic
NMDAR activation on Ret51. In control experiments, we
analyzed the activation of calpains under both conditions by
measuring the cleavage of αII-spectrin, a well-known calpain

Figure 1 Ret51 isoform is selectively downregulated in hippocampal neurons subjected to excitotoxic stimulation by activation of NMDAR. (a) Alternative splicing of Ret
transcripts gives rise to Ret51 and Ret9 isoforms, which differ in their C-terminus tail. The signaling pathways activated by the two isoforms are also indicated. Horizontal lines

incubated in culture-conditioned medium for 2–10 h. Cell extracts were analyzed by western blotting using anti-Ret51 (b) or anti-Ret9 (d) antibodies, or with an anti-GFRα1 (e)
antibody, at the indicated time points after excitotoxic stimulation. The ratio between Ret51 (b), Ret9 (d) and GFRα1 (e), and the loading control (tubulin (b–d) or synaptophysin
(e)) was calculated, and the results are expressed as percentage of the control Ret51, Ret9 and GFRα1 protein levels. (c) Hippocampal neurons were pre-incubated (30 min) with
the glutamate receptors antagonists (100 μM APV and 20 μM CNQX) before and during glutamate (Glu) stimulation (125 μM, 20 min). The cells were further incubated in cultureconditioned medium for 8 h in presence of the antagonists and extracts were analyzed by western blotting with an anti-Ret51 antibody. The ratio between Ret51 and the loading
control (tubulin) was calculated, and the results are expressed as percentage of the control Ret51 protein levels. The results are the average ± S.E.M. of 3–6 different experiments
performed in independent preparations. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by (b, d, e) Dunnett’s comparison test performed for each condition as
compared with the control, not exposed to excitotoxic conditions (***Po0.001; Ret9 and GFRα1 protein levels after excitotoxic stimulation were not significantly different from the
control), or by (c) Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test (**Po0.01; *Po0.05, compared with the control condition or for the indicated comparisons)

substrate.37 Cleavage of αII-spectrin by calpains gives rise to
a cleavage product with 145 kDa, whereas cleavage by
caspase-3 accounts for the production of a 120 kDa
fragment, and both proteases contribute to the production
of a spectrin breakdown product (SBDP) with 150 kDa.37

Selective activation of extrasynaptic NMDAR significantly
induced Ret51 and αII-spectrin cleavage, and accumulation
of 145 kDa SBDP. In contrast, activation of synaptic NMDAR
showed a small effect on αII-spectrin cleavage, which was
accompanied by a low accumulation of a 145 kDa SBDP and

(125 μM, 20 min), followed by incubation in culture-conditioned medium for 2–6 h. Cell extracts were analyzed by western blot using an antibody against an EC epitope of Ret

no significant Ret51 cleavage (Figure 3). As expected, there
was no effect on the accumulation of the caspase-3generated 120 kDa SBDP (Figure 3b).
Ret51 is downregulated in an in vitro model of cerebral
ischemia by a calpain-dependent mechanism following
activation of glutamate receptors. We have previously
shown a role for glutamate receptors in hippocampal
neuronal death following oxygen and glucose deprivation
(OGD), an in vitro model of transient global ischemia.1
Therefore, we compared the alterations in Ret51, Ret9 and
GFRα1 protein levels in cultured hippocampal neurons
subjected to OGD with those observed after excitotoxic
stimulation. Transient incubation of rat hippocampal neurons
(15 DIV) under OGD for 90 min induces ~ 35% cell death
when determined 7–12 h after the insult.1,4 The results

showed a downregulation of Ret51 protein levels to ~ 35%
of the sham, whereas the Ret9 and GFRα1 were not affected
(Figures 4a–d). Incubation of hippocampal neurons with
APV alone or in combination with CNQX completely blocked
OGD-induced downregulation of Ret51 (Figure 4a).
To determine whether calpain activation also has a role in
Ret51 downregulation in hippocampal neurons subjected to
OGD, we tested the effect of MDL28170. The calpain inhibitor
significantly reduced the OGD-induced loss of Ret51 protein
levels to ~ 90% of the control, showing a key role for calpains in
the downregulation of the receptor (Figure 4b). As expected,
OGD significantly reduced the full-length spectrin protein
levels, giving rise to a consistent accumulation of the 145 kDa
SBDP formed upon cleavage by calpains (Figure 4e). Inhibition of the NMDAR with APV, in the absence or in the presence
of the AMPA/kainate receptor inhibitor CNQX, completely

Figure 3 Ret51 is specifically cleaved by calpain following activation of extrasynaptic NMDAR. Cultured hippocampal neurons (15 DIV) were subjected to pharmacological
protocols to activate synaptic or extrasynaptic NMDAR and were further incubated in culture-conditioned medium for 8 h. To induce synaptic activity the cells were treated with
50 μM bicuculline (bic), 2.5 mM 4-AP and 10 μM glycine (Gly) for 20 min. Selective activation of extrasynaptic NMDAR was performed after blocking the synaptic receptors with
50 μM bicuculline, 2.5 mM 4-AP, 10 μM glycine and 10 μM MK-801 for 5 min. Extrasynaptic NMDAR were then stimulated for 20 min with 100 μM NMDA in the absence of
MK-801. Cell extracts were analyzed by western blotting with (a) anti-Ret51 (intracellular epitope) or (b) anti-αII-spectrin antibodies. In the latter condition, the immunoreactivity of
the full-length protein (280 kDa αII-spectrin) and the cleavage products (SBDP) with 145 and 120 kDa was analyzed. The ratio between Ret51 protein levels (a) or intact/cleaved
spectrin (b) and the loading control (tubulin) was calculated, and the results are expressed as percentage of the control. The results are the average ± S.E.M. of 3–4 different
experiments performed in independent preparations. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test, comparing all the conditions with the
control (**Po0.01; *Po0.05)

prevented the cleavage of the full-length protein and the
accumulation of the 145 kDa SBDP (Figure 4e).
No significant changes were observed in the caspase-3generated 120 kDa SBDP, indicating a minor contribution of
caspase-3 to spectrin cleavage after OGD.
Ret isoforms are downregulated in in vivo ischemia. In
additional experiments, we determined the alterations in the
levels of GDNF receptors in the brain after transient MCAO, a
model of focal brain ischemia.38,39 Adult mice were subjected to
45 min occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA), and
extracts were prepared from the ischemic core and the
penumbra region of the ipsilateral brain hemisphere, as well
as from the contralateral (contra) brain hemisphere (Figures 5a
and b), 48 h after the lesion. At this time point, the brain infarct
is fully developed and is not expected to further increase.40 In
sham-operated mice, protein extracts were prepared from
equivalent brain regions. A marked decline of protein levels of
both Ret isoforms (to ~ 25% and ~ 35% for Ret51 and Ret9,
respectively, as compared with the contralateral region of
sham-operated mice) was observed in the ischemic
core, whereas no significant changes were observed in the
penumbra region and in the contralateral side in MCAOoperated mice (Figures 5c and e). Interestingly, in the core

region, the downregulation of the mature form of Ret51, with
170 kDa, was accompanied by an increase in the abundance
of a 150 kDa protein that is likely to correspond to an immature
form of the protein present in the endoplasmic reticulum.41,42
These results show a comparable pattern of change in Ret51
protein levels following excitotoxic stimulation (Figures 1b
and c) and in both ischemia models used in this work
(Figures 4a and b, and Figure 5c). GFRα1 protein levels did not
change significantly in the brain of mice subjected to MCAO
(Figure 5f).
Given the role of calpains in the downregulation of Ret51 in
hippocampal neurons subjected to OGD and to excitotoxic
stimulation, we checked for the accumulation of the 145 kDa
SBDP in the core and penumbra regions of mice subjected
to 45 min of MCAO. As expected, there was a strong increase
in the immunoreactivity in the ischemic core, showing an
upregulation of calpain activity, whereas the accumulation of
the 145 kDa SBDP in the penumbra region was not statistically
significant (Figure 5d). Taken together, these results suggest
that calpain activation may also contribute to the downregulation of Ret51 in the core region in the brain cortex of
mice subjected to MCAO.
The downregulation of Ret9 in the core region after transient
MCAO (Figure 5e) contrasts with the results obtained under

Figure 4 Ret51 is downregulated in in vitro ischemia by a calpain-dependent mechanism following activation of NMDAR. Cultured hippocampal neurons (15 DIV) were

Cell extracts were analyzed by western blotting with anti-Ret51 (intracellular epitope) (a, b), anti-Ret9 (c), anti-GFRα1 (d) or anti-αII-spectrin (e) antibodies. In the latter condition,
the immunoreactivity of the full-length protein (280 kDa αII-spectrin) and the cleavage products (SBDP) with 145 or 120 kDa was analyzed. The ratio between Ret51 (a, b), Ret9
(c), GFRα1 (d), intact/cleaved αII-spectrin (e) and the loading control (tubulin (a, b, c, e) or synaptophysin (d]) was calculated, and the results are expressed as percentage of the
control protein levels. The results are the average ± S.E.M. of 3–5 different experiments performed in independent preparations. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test (a, b, e) or Student’s t-test (c, d). (NS, not significant, ***Po0.001, **Po0.01, as compared with the sham condition or

excitotoxic conditions (Figure 1d) or in in vitro ischemia
(Figure 4c). This may be due to (i) the stronger injury induced
by in vivo ischemia when compared with the in vitro models,
which may further upregulate calpain activity, and/or (ii)
downregulation of Ret9 in astrocytes (present in low amounts
in hippocampal cultures), as these receptors are also
expressed in this cell type.11
Cell Death and Disease

GDNF-dependent signaling is downregulated under
excitotoxic conditions and brain ischemia. Ret51 downregulation observed under excitotoxic conditions and in two
different models of brain ischemia is likely to have a
significant impact in the signaling activity of the intact fulllength receptor. To address this question, we analyzed (i)

the average ± S.E.M. of 3–4 independent experiments performed in different animals. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple

and Ret9), (ii) PLCγ1 phosphorylation, as it follows the
interaction of the enzyme with pTyr1015 in the active
receptor19 and (iii) ERK phosphorylation, as it is a downstream mediator of the signaling cascade activated by
pTyr1062 (present in Ret51 and Ret9) and pTyr1096 (present
only in Ret51; Figure 1a).20,21,33
In preliminary experiments, we tested the effect of excitotoxic injury on GDNF (10 ng/ml)-induced phosphorylation of
Ret on Tyr1062, which is coupled to the activation of neuronal
survival pathways (Figure 1a).16,20,21,23 These studies were
performed in hippocampal neurons cultured for 15 DIV that
show a higher phosphorylation of Ret under resting conditions
and a more robust response to GDNF than 7 DIV neurons
(Supplementary Figure 2). Incubation with GDNF was
performed during 10 min, which induces maximal phosphorylation of the receptors (not shown). As hippocampal neurons
cultured for 15 DIV are more sensitive to excitotoxic injury than
younger cultures, the concentration of glutamate in these
experiments was reduced to 50 μM. Under these conditions,
Ret51 protein levels were downregulated following excitotoxic
stimulation, in a time- and calpain-dependent manner, with a
t1/2 of 6.80 h, whereas Ret9 expression was not affected

(Supplementary Figure 2), similarly to the results obtained in 7
DIV neurons (Figures 1 and 2).
The effect of excitotoxic injury on Ret51 phosphorylation
(activation) was evaluated after immunoprecipitation of the
receptor with an antibody specific for this Ret isoform. Figure 6
(panels a and b) shows that GDNF significantly increases
Ret51 phosphorylation under control conditions, without affecting total Ret51 protein levels (Supplementary Figure 2).
Excitotoxic stimulation with glutamate significantly inhibited
the GDNF-induced total increase in pRet51 (Tyr1062) to ~ 58%
of the control (Figure 6c), as determined 6h after excitotoxic
stimulation, when Ret51 protein levels are reduced to ~ 50% of
the control (Supplementary Figure 2). The effect of glutamate
stimulation on total Ret51 phosphorylation was only partially
reduced by calpain inhibition with MDL28170 (Figure 6c),
which fully prevents the downregulation of the receptor
(Supplementary Figure 2). These results provide an estimation
of the effects of excitotoxic injury on the total number of active
(phosphorylated) Ret51 receptors, which is related with the
decrease in the total number of receptors. To determine
whether the Ret51 receptors that are not affected by the toxic
insult with glutamate are still likely to be activated

Figure 6 Ret51-dependent signaling is downregulated under excitotoxic conditions. (a) Cultured hippocampal neurons (15 DIV) were stimulated with GDNF (GDNF, 10 ng/ml)
or maintained under control conditions for 10 min and lysed, and Ret51 proteins were immunoprecipitated. As control condition, normal goat IgG was used. The
immunoprecipitates were analyzed by western blotting using anti-phospho-specific Ret (pRet, Y1062) and anti-Ret51 antibodies. The supernatants from the immunoprecipitation
were subjected to western blot analysis with an anti-tubulin antibody to confirm that equal amounts of protein were analyzed. (b–e) Hippocampal neurons (15 DIV) were
stimulated with 10 ng/ml GDNF (GDNF) under control conditions or after excitotoxic stimulation with glutamate (Glu; 50 μM, 20 min). Under the latter experimental conditions, the
cells were incubated in culture-conditioned medium for 6 h after the toxic insult before stimulation with GDNF. When the effect of the calpain inhibitor MDL28170 (MDL; 50 μM)
was tested, the cells were pre-incubated with the inhibitor for 2 h before glutamate stimulation, and the inhibitor was also present during all additional experimental manipulation.

100% (b, c). (d, e) GDNF-induced downstream signaling under excitotoxic conditions was analyzed by western blot with anti-pPLCγ1 (d) or anti-pERK1/2 (e) antibodies, using
total PLCγ1 and ERK1/2 as loading control, respectively. The ratio between the phospho- and the total protein levels was calculated, and the results obtained under resting
conditions were set to 100%. (b–e) The results are the average ± S.E.M. of 4–6 different experiments performed in independent preparations. Statistical analysis was performed

(phosphorylated) following stimulation with GDNF, the alterations in pRet51 were expressed as a function of the total
receptor levels in hippocampal neurons before and after injury,
in the absence and in the presence of the calpain inhibitor
(Figure 6b).
Cell Death and Disease

The results show no decrease of the GDNF-induced pRet51/
Ret51 ratio following excitotoxic injury, in the absence or
in the presence of the calpain inhibitor, indicating that the
receptor population remaining after injury can still be
phosphorylated.

In addition to the effects of excitotoxic injury on Ret51
phosphorylation, there was also an impairment of
GDNF-induced PLCγ1 phosphorylation (Figure 6d) and ERK
activation (Figure 6e). Moreover, the activity of both signaling
pathways was still downregulated when the experiments were
conducted in the presence of the calpain inhibitor MDL28170,
indicating that activation of GDNF receptors is no longer
coupled to the stimulation of survival pathways.
Given the calpain-mediated downregulation of Ret51 in
excitotoxic and ischemic conditions, we investigated whether
pRet downregulation was also observed in the in vitro and
in vivo models of brain ischemia. Transient exposure of
hippocampal neurons to OGD decreased the expression of
pRet to ~70% of the sham (Figure 7a). A decrease in pRet was
also observed in the infarct core after transient MCAO, but not
in the penumbra region (Figure 7b). The reduction in pRet in
the ischemic core after in vivo ischemia may be related, at
least in part, with the decrease in total Ret51 and Ret9 protein
levels, which contrasts with the stability in the receptor levels in
the penumbra region (Figures 5a and c).
GDNF protects hippocampal neurons from excitotoxic
stimulation and in vitro brain ischemia. The downregulation of Ret51 after excitotoxic injury in cultured hippocampal
neurons and in brain ischemia may affect the neuroprotective
signaling induced by GDNF. To investigate the neuroprotective effects of GDNF in cultured hippocampal neurons, we
first compared the effect of GDNF added to hippocampal
neurons before (30 min) or during the excitotoxic insult.
Hippocampal neurons (15 DIV) were incubated with 50 μM
glutamate for 20 min, in presence or not of GDNF, and were
further incubated in culture-conditioned medium for 8 h
(Figure 8a). Under these conditions, excitotoxic stimulation
induced ~ 50% of cell death, and incubation with the
neurotrophic factor for 30 min before or during the insult
reduced neuronal death by ~15%.

We also investigated the putative neuroprotective effects of
GDNF in OGD. Incubation with GDNF for 30 min before or
during the ischemic insult significantly reduced cell death by
~ 20%. Importantly, when GDNF was added immediately after
OGD, there was also a protective effect of ~15% (Figure 8b).
The protective effect of GDNF under the latter conditions may
be, at least in part, mediated by Ret51, but the downregulation
of the receptor after OGD may compromise the neuroprotective activity of GDNF. To address this question, we compared
the effects of GDNF in hippocampal neurons transfected with
GFP or with hRet51-GFP. In these experiments, the cells were
incubated with GDNF during the period after the insult. OGD
increased the rate of cell death to 43% in hippocampal
neurons transfected with GFP, and under these conditions
GDNF significantly decreased cell death to 32% when added
after the insult. In hippocampal neurons transfected with
hRet51-GFP, the presence of GDNF during the incubation
period after OGD further decreased cell death to 22%,
suggesting that the downregulation of Ret51 receptors indeed
decreases the neuroprotective effects of GDNF in hippocampal neurons subjected to in vitro ischemia (Figure 8c). As
expected, cells expressing GFP exhibited a pattern of
neuroprotection by GDNF similar to the one observed in
non-transfected cells (Figure 8b).
Discussion
In this study, we found that the GDNF co-receptor Ret51 is
selectively downregulated in cultured hippocampal neurons
subjected to excitotoxic conditions, and in in vitro brain
ischemia, by a mechanism dependent on the activation of
extrasynaptic NMDAR coupled to stimulation of calpains. The
cleavage of Ret51 was also observed in the ischemic core
after transient MCAO, and decreased the GDNF-induced
signaling mechanisms and neuroprotection. Therefore,
although the ischemic injury upregulates GDNF gene

Figure 7 Phospho-Ret is downregulated in brain ischemia. (a) Cultured hippocampal neurons (15 DIV) were exposed to 90 min sham/OGD, followed by incubation in cultureconditioned medium for 8 h. Cell extracts were analyzed by western blotting with anti-phospho-specific anti-Ret (pRet, Y1062) antibody. The results presented are the ratio
between phospho-Ret (pRet, Y1062) protein levels and the loading control (tubulin). Sham protein level was set to 100%. (b) Adult C56BL/6 mice were subjected to transient
45 min MCAO/sham. pRet (Y1062) protein levels were determined in the infarct core, penumbra and contralateral cortex 48 h after the lesion by western blotting. The ratio
between pRet (Y1062) protein levels and the loading control (synaptophysin) was calculated, and the results obtained in the contralateral hemisphere of sham-operated mice
were set to 100%. The results are the average ± S.E.M. of four independent experiments performed in different preparations/animals. Statistical analysis was performed using
Student’s t-test (a) or one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test (b) (**Po0.01, *Po0.05 as compared for the indicated comparisons)

assessed 8 h after excitotoxic stimulation (a) or 12 h after sham/OGD (b) by fluorescence microscopy, using the fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342. (c) Hippocampal neurons were

expression and protein levels in the injured brain
region,16,24–26,43 this is less likely to provide an increased
neuroprotection. In addition to Ret51, the TrkB receptors for
BDNF are also downregulated under excitotoxic conditions
and after transient MCAO,6,44 suggesting that the impairment
of the endogenous neuroprotective signaling mechanisms
mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases may be a key event in
neuronal death in brain ischemia.
Calpains are important mediators of ischemic neurodegeneration and of excitotoxic neuronal damage.3,5 Combining
in vitro pharmacological approaches and biochemical analysis, we have found that calpains have a key role in the
downregulation of Ret51 under excitotoxic conditions and in
hippocampal neurons subjected to OGD. The role of calpains
in Ret51 cleavage is supported by the following pieces of
evidence: (i) calpain inhibitors prevented the excitotoxicityand OGD-induced downregulation of total Ret51; (ii) Ret51
cleavage under excitotoxic conditions and in the in vitro and
in vivo models of brain ischemia was correlated with an
increase in calpain activity; (iii) inhibition of calpains prevented
the glutamate-evoked formation of a Ret51 cleavage product;
and (iv) several putative calpain cleavage sites, located
Cell Death and Disease

in intracellular sequences of Ret51, were identified by the
GPS-CCD program. Interestingly, the glutamate-induced
cleavage of Ret51 was specifically mediated by activation of
extrasynaptic NMDAR, and these results were correlated with
the preferential coupling of this population of glutamate
receptors to the upregulation of calpain activity. Previous
studies have shown that extrasynaptic NMDAR-coupled
m-calpain activation is linked to neurodegeneration while the
synaptic pool of NMDAR is coupled to neuroprotective
activation of μ-calpain.7,9
In contrast with the effects on Ret51, excitotoxic stimulation
and OGD did not affect total Ret9 or GFRα1 protein levels in
cultured hippocampal neurons, showing the specificity of the
effects on Ret51. The differences in the C-terminus tail of Ret9
and Ret51 (Figures 1a and 2d), including in the disorder
tendency, may account for the differential sensitivity to
calpains. Alternatively, the selective activity of calpain on
Ret51 may be owing to differences in the subcellular
localization of the two Ret isoforms.41
Given the key role of excitotoxicity in OGD-induced downregulation of Ret51 and cell death, we investigated the effect of
toxic stimulation with glutamate on GDNF-induced Ret51

GDNF signaling in brain ischemia

activation by transphosphorylation. As expected, the downregulation of Ret51 was associated with a decrease in total
receptor phosphorylation detected in the cells. However,
calpain inhibition, which fully abrogates the downregulation
of Ret51 under excitotoxic conditions, did not completely
prevent the decrease in receptor phosphorylation, suggesting
that additional mechanisms may contribute to the impairment
of the GDNF-induced receptor activation. A decrease in the
ATP levels in neurons following a toxic stimulation with
glutamate1 may contribute to the impairment of the mechanisms of receptor activation by transphosphorylation. Although
at least some of the cleaved Ret51 receptors remain in the cell
after excitotoxic stimulation (Figure 2a), they are unlikely to
have an important role as dominant negatives, to prevent the
activation of the full-length Ret51 receptors, as the pRet51/
total Ret51 in hippocampal neurons subjected to excitotoxic
injury was not significantly different from the control. As Ret9
and Ret51 appear to form independent complexes following
stimulation with GDNF,33,45 the cleaved Ret51 receptors are
also unlikely to modulate the signaling activity of Ret9
receptors by a dominant-negative type of effect.
The partial reduction of GDNF-induced Ret51 signaling in
hippocampal neurons subjected to excitotoxic stimulation
contrasts with a full inhibition of the two downstream pathways,
PLCγ and ERK1/2. PLCγ is activated directly upon binding to the
phosphorylated Ret receptors, while ERK1/2 activation requires
the participation of several signaling intermediates.20,23,46
Furthermore, no protective effect was observed in the presence
of the calpain inhibitor MDL28170, suggesting an overall
impairment of the GDNF signaling mechanisms, which should
prevent the neuroprotective signaling activity, even when the
truncation of the receptors is blocked. In particular, the inhibition
of the ERK pathway is likely to have a great impact in
neuroprotection under excitotoxic conditions.10,11
The neuroprotective effects of GDNF were tested in
hippocampal neurons by incubation with the neurotrophic
factor before, during and after OGD. In all experimental
conditions, GDNF reduced cell death. However, when the
experiments were performed in hippocampal neurons
transfected with hRet51, the OGD-induced cell death was
significantly reduced. These results show that indeed the timedependent downregulation of Ret51 after OGD significantly
decreases the neuroprotective effects of GDNF and may
therefore contribute to the demise process in brain ischemia
in vivo. The fact that not all Ret51 protein is cleaved/degraded
after the ischemic insult may explain why GDNF treatment
immediately after 90 min MCAO in rats still reduced infarct
volume, apoptotic cell death and autophagic effects when
determined at 24 h after the surgery.15 Moreover, 10 min
intravenous application of TAT-GDNF immediately after 30 min
MCAO reduced the number of caspase-3-immunoreactive and
DNA-fragmented cells, and increased the number of viable
neurons in the striatum, as found 3 days after the insult.47 The
observed neuroprotective effects of GDNF might be mediated
by at least four different mechanisms: (i) reduction in NMDAmediated calcium currents,11 (ii) upregulation of antiapoptotic
gene expression,12 (iii) suppression of free radical production48
and/or (iv) increase in neuronal metabolic activity.49
The observed downregulation of Ret51 after transient
MCAO in mice (at t = 48 h) contrasts with the effect of

permanent MCAO in rats, which increases Ret51 protein
levels in the ipsilateral region at 3–24 h.50 These contrasting
results suggest that the effects of the ischemic injury on Ret51
protein levels depend on the type of insult or, alternatively, the
differences may be owing to the distinct time points after the
injury onset used in the two studies. The differential effects
observed in the experiments using the permanent brain
ischemia model and in cultured hippocampal neurons
subjected to OGD may be owing to the contribution of glial
cells, which also express Ret receptors11 and are present in
low amounts in the hippocampal cultures.4
Together, the results show a role for calpains in the cleavage
of Ret51 under excitotoxic conditions and in brain ischemia.
Given the neuroprotective role of GDNF, even when tested
after the ischemic injury, and the upregulation of GDNF in the
ischemic brain, the results suggest that preserving Ret
receptors may constitute a good strategy to increase the
endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms. Such strategy may
also be relevant under other conditions characterized by
excitotoxic cell death, such as in cerebral trauma, epileptic
seizures and chronic neurodegenerative disorders.

Glutamate treatment. Excitotoxic stimulation with glutamate was carried out
by challenging 7 and 15 DIV hippocampal neurons with 125 or 50 μM glutamate,
respectively, for 20 min, and the cells were further incubated in culture-conditioned
medium for the indicated periods of time. When appropriate, the cells were
pre-incubated with the calpain inhibitor MDL28170 (50 μM) or ALLN (50 μM), with
the glutamate receptors antagonists APV (100 μM) or CNQX (20 μM), with the
proteasome inhibitor β-lactone (1 μM) or with 10 ng/ml GDNF, as indicated in the
figure captions. All compounds were also present during the stimulation and
recovery periods. To evaluate Ret51 signaling activity, hippocampal neurons were
incubated with 10 ng/ml GDNF for 10 min, under control conditions or 6 h after
excitotoxic stimulation.
Oxygen-glucose deprivation. OGD was performed by incubating hippocampal neurons (15 DIV) in a glucose-free saline buffer (116 mM NaCl, 25 mM
sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgSO4, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 1.8 mM
CaCl2 and 25 mM NaHCO3) in an anaerobic chamber with 10% H2, 85% N2 and 5%
CO2 (Forma Anaerobic System, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Porto Salvo, Portugal) at
37 °C for 1.5 h. The OGD buffer was then replaced by a conditioned medium and
the cultures were returned to the humidified 95% air/5% CO2 incubator for the
indicated post-incubation time period. Under control conditions (Sham), the cells
were incubated in the saline buffer described above, supplemented with 25 mM
glucose instead of sucrose and kept in the humidified 95% air/5% CO2 incubator at
37 °C. When appropriate the cells were pre-incubated with the calpain inhibitor
MDL28170 (50 μM), with the glutamate receptors antagonists APV (100 μM) or
CNQX (20 μM), or with 10 ng/ml GDNF, as indicated in the figure captions. In this
case, all compounds were also present during the stimulation and recovery periods.
Stimulation of synaptic versus extrasynaptic NMDAR. Activation of
synaptic versus extrasynaptic NMDAR was performed as previously described,1,52
in a basal saline buffer containing 132 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 1.4 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM
CaCl2, 6 mM glucose and 10 mM HEPES. Synaptic NMDAR were stimulated by
incubating hippocampal neurons (15 DIV) with 50 μM bicuculline, 2.5 mM 4-AP
and 10 μM glycine for 20 min. To stimulate the extrasynaptic pool of NMDAR,
hippocampal neurons (15 DIV) were incubated with 50 μM bicuculline, 2.5 mM 4-AP,
10 μM glycine and 10 μM MK-801 for 5 min, and washed once with a similar
solution but in the absence of MK-801 before incubation with 100 μM NMDA for
20 min. Neurons were then allowed to recover in culture-conditioned medium for the
indicated periods of time.
Neuron transfection with calcium phosphate. The plasmid encoding
the full-length human Ret51 fused C-terminally to enhanced GFP was a generous
gift from Dr. Carlos F. Ibanez (Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden).53
Transfection of cultured hippocampal neurons with the hRet51-GFP construct was
performed by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. In brief, 2 μg (for
morphological studies) or 7.5 μg (for biochemical analysis) of plasmid DNA were
diluted in Tris-EDTA (TE) pH 7.3 and mixed with 2.5 M CaCl2. This DNA/TE/calcium
mix was added to 10 mM HEPES-buffered saline solution (270 mM NaCl, 10 mM
KCl, 1.4 mM Na2HPO4, 11 mM dextrose and 42 mM HEPES, pH 7.2). The
precipitates were allowed to form for 30 min at room temperature (RT), protected
from light, with vortex-mixing every 5 min, to ensure that the precipitates had similar
small sizes. Meanwhile, cultured hippocampal neurons were incubated in cultureconditioned medium with 2 mM kynurenic acid. The precipitates were added
dropwise to each well and incubated for 90–120 min at 37 °C in an incubator with
95% air/5% CO2. The cells were then washed with acidic culture medium containing
2 mM kynurenic acid and returned to the 95% air/5% CO2 incubator for 20 min at
37 °C. Finally, the medium was replaced with the initial culture-conditioned medium,
and the cells were further incubated in a 95% air/5% CO2 incubator for 48 h at 37 °C
to allow protein expression. Cell cultures were then subjected to OGD for 90 min,
and 12 h after the insult the cells were fixed to proceed with the cell death assay. In
the case of calpain-induced cleavage of Ret51, hippocampal neurons were
subjected to excitotoxic stimulation, in presence or in the absence of the calpain
inhibitor MDL28170 (50 μM) or the proteasome inhibitor β-lactone (1 μM), and
further incubated in culture-conditioned medium for the indicated periods of time.
Cell death assay. Hippocampal neurons were cultured on poly-D-lysine-coated
glass coverslips and cell death was evaluated based on the analysis of nuclear
morphology. Neurons were fixed in 4% sucrose/paraformaldehyde for 15 min at RT
before incubation with the fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml) for 10 min. The
coverslips were then mounted with a fluorescent mounting medium (Dako, Glostrup,
Cell Death and Disease

Denmark), and imaging was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence
microscope (Jena, Germany), under a × 40 objective. For each experimental
condition, three coverslips were used (at least 200 cells per coverslip were
counted), and at least three independent experiments were analyzed.
When hippocampal neurons were transfected with hRet51-GFP, following OGD
they were fixed in 4% sucrose/paraformaldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS)) and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. The neurons were then
incubated with 10% BSA in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C, and incubated with the rabbit
anti-GFP antibody diluted in 3% BSA in PBS, overnight at 4 °C. The cells were
washed with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG)
conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488, for 1 h at RT. The coverslips were mounted in a
fluorescence mounting medium and imaging was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 200
fluorescence microscope, under a × 40 objective. The cells to count were chosen by
the GFP (green) channel to check for the presence of transfected neurons.
Measurements were performed in triplicate (⩾80 cells were counted per coverslip),
and in 5–6 independent experiments with distinct preparations.
Western blot. Hippocampal neurons (7 or 15 DIV) were washed twice with icecold PBS and then lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,
5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton, 0.5% DOC and 0.1% SDS at a final pH 7.5) supplemented
with a mixture of protease inhibitors (0.1 mM PMSF and CLAP (1 μg/ml
chymostatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain and 1 μg/ml pepstatin)) and
phosphatase inhibitors (1.5 mM Na3VO4 and 50 mM NaF). After centrifugation at
16 100 × g for 10 min, protein levels present in the supernatants were quantified
using the BCA method (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Before separation by SDS-PAGE,
in 7.5% or 10% polyacrylamide gels, the samples were denatured with 2x
concentrated denaturing buffer (125 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mM glycine, 4% SDS,
200 mM DTT, 40% glycerol, 3 mM sodium orthovanadate and 0.01% bromophenol
blue) at 95 °C for 5 min. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to
PVDF membranes (Millipore) and were immunoblotted. Membranes were incubated
with primary antibodies (overnight at 4 °C or 1 h at RT), washed and exposed to
alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1 : 20 000 dilution; 1 h at
RT). Alkaline phosphatase activity was visualized by enhanced chemifluorescence
on the Storm 860 gel and blot imaging system and was quantified using the
ImageQuant program (GE Healthcare). Anti-synaptophysin and anti-β-tubulin
antibodies were used as loading controls.
Immunoprecipitation. Hippocampal neuronal cultures (15 DIV) were washed
twice with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with a mixture
of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. After centrifugation at 16 100 × g for 10 min,
protein levels in the supernatants were quantified using the BCA method. Protein G
sepharose beads (50 μl) were added to lysis buffer (1 ml) containing 2 μg of the
anti-Ret51 antibody and incubated overnight on a head-over-head shaker at 4 °C.
Antibody excess was removed by two rinses with lysis buffer. Lysed samples
(700/800 μg) were added to the complexes beads–antibody and incubated for 3 h
on a head-over-head shaker at 4 °C. Beads were centrifuged at 800 × g and the
supernatant was collected, and the complexes beads–antibody–samples were then
washed three times with lysis buffer. The residual lysis buffer was removed and then
50 μl of 2 × loading buffer was added. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and
beads were centrifuged at 800 × g. The bead supernatants were used for western
blot analysis.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion. Experiments were conducted in
accordance with protocols approved by the Malmö/Lund Ethical Committee for
Animal Research (M332-09, M243-07). C57BL/6J male mice (11–34 weeks old;
weight: 23.0–35 g; Lund University breeding facility) were housed under diurnal
conditions with ad libitum access to water and food before and after surgery.
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by transient occlusion of the right MCA as
described previously.54 In brief, mice were anesthetized by inhalation of 2.5%
isoflurane (IsobaVet, Schering-Plough Animal Health) in O2:N2O (30 : 70).
Anesthesia was subsequently reduced to 1.5–1.8% isoflurane and sustained
throughout the occlusion period. Body temperature was kept at ~37 °C throughout the
surgery period. To monitor regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), an optical fiber probe
(Probe 318-I, Perimed, Järfälla, Sweden) was fixed to the skull at 2 mm posterior and
4 mm lateral to bregma, and connected to a laser Doppler flow meter (Periflux System
5000, Perimed). A filament composed of 6-0 polydioxanone suture (PSD II, Ethicon,
Norderstedt, Germany) with a silicone tip (diameter of 225–275 μm) was inserted into
the external carotid artery and advanced into the common carotid artery. The filament
was retracted, moved into the internal carotid artery and advanced until the origin of

the MCA, given by the sudden drop in rCBF (~70% of baseline). After 45 min, the
filament was withdrawn and reperfusion was observed. The animals were placed in a
heating box at 37 °C for the first 2 h after surgery and thereafter transferred into a
heating box at 35 °C to avoid postsurgical hypothermia. Thirty minutes and 24 h
after the onset of reperfusion, 0.5 ml of 5% glucose was administered
subcutaneously. Temperature and sensorimotor deficits were assessed at 1, 2 and
24 h after the surgery. Body weight was controlled daily. In sham surgeries,
the filament was advanced up to the internal carotid artery and was withdrawn
before reaching the MCA. After (permanent) ligation of the external carotid artery,
0.150 ml of 0.05% bupivacaine (Marcain, AstraZeneca, Södertälje, Sweden)
were injected around the wound to reduce pain. Mice that did not verify an
immediate reduction in rCBF upon MCAO or reperfusion were immediately killed
and excluded from the study; intracerebral hemorrhage was confirmed a posteriori
in all cases.
Mice were anesthetized 48 h after MCAO or sham surgery, by inhalation of 2.5%
isoflurane, and were then perfused transcardially with 0.9% NaCl for 2 min before
decapitation. Upon removal of meninges, brains were rapidly isolated and frozen by
immersion in isopentane at − 40 °C, further cooled down to − 70 °C and stored at
− 80 °C. The infarct core and remaining ipsilateral tissue (designated as penumbra
for simplification) were dissected, as well as the contralateral cortex, from coronal
brain sections covering the majority of damage. More specifically, consecutive 2-, 1and 2-mm-thick brain sections were made, starting at 2 mm from the olfactory bulb.
Dissections were performed at − 15 °C, a temperature that allows an easy
detachment of the infarct core and penumbra. The cortical–striatal infarcts obtained
were as previously illustrated.38 Equivalent brain regions were dissected from shamoperated mice, which were also designated as infarct core and penumbra, and
contralateral cortex. For each animal, corresponding regions from each of three
consecutive brain sections were pulled together. Samples were then homogenized
and processed for western blotting as previously described.38 Cellular protein
extraction was performed by mechanical homogenization of the tissue and incubation
in lysis buffer: 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1%
Triton X-100, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM β-glycerolphosphate,
1 mM orthovanadate and 1 mM PMSF, supplemented with a protease inhibitor
cocktail. Following 30min incubation at 4 °C, samples were centrifuged at 18 000 × g
for 15 min. Total protein concentration in lysates was determined by the
Bradford assay.
2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. After 24 h of recovery,
animals were sacrificed in order to evaluate the infarct volume. The brain was
removed and the forebrain was sliced into 1 mm thick sections using a mouse brain
slicer, on ice. The sections were rinsed once in ice-cold 0.9% sodium chloride
(NaCl) for 10 min and subsequently immersed in 50 ml of 0.01% 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride in 0.9 % NaCl at 37 °C for 15 min. Slices were fixed
in 4% formalin and images were acquired with a MicroPublisher 3.3 RTV CCD
camera (QImaging, Surrey, BC, Canada) using standard conditions.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA
analysis of variance, followed by Dunnett’s or Bonferroni’s post hoc test, or using
Student’s t-test, as indicated in the figure captions.
