Sphingosine kinases (Sphks) are the rate-limiting kinases in the generation of sphingosine-1-phosphate, which is
a well-established intracellular pro-survival lipid mediator. Sphk2 has been reported to be protective following
experimental stroke. We investigated the role of Sphk1 in cerebral ischemia using a mouse middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) model and an in vitro glucose–oxygen deprivation (OGD) model. Sphk expression and activity
were assessed in the ischemic brain with quantitative PCR (qPCR), Western blot, immunohistochemistry and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pharmacological and gene knockdown approaches were utilized
to investigate the effects of Sphk1 on stroke outcomes. The expression of Sphk1 but not that of Sphk2 was rapidly
induced in the cortical penumbra over 96 h after MCAO, and the microglia were one of the major cellular sources
of Sphk1 induction. Consistently, Sphk activity was enhanced in the cortical penumbra. In contrast to the protective role of Sphk2, pharmacological inhibition and cortical knockdown of Sphk1 reduced infarction at 24 and 96 h
after reperfusion. Additionally, the Sphk1 inhibitor improved the neurological deﬁcits at 96 h after reperfusion.
Mechanistically, Sphk1 inhibition and knockdown signiﬁcantly attenuated MCAO-induced expression of inﬂammatory mediators in the cortical penumbra. Moreover, using a conditioned medium transfer approach, we demonstrated that OGD-treated neurons induced the expression of Sphk1 and pro-inﬂammatory mediators in
primary microglia, and the microglial induction of pro-inﬂammatory mediators by ischemic neurons was blunted
by Sphk1 inhibition. Taken together, our results indicate that Sphk1 plays an essential role in mediating poststroke neuroinﬂammation.

Introduction
Sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 (Sphk1 and Sphk2) convert sphingosine
into sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and are the rate-limiting enzymes
in the process of endogenous S1P generation (Bryan et al., 2008). S1P,
both as an extracellular signaling molecule via G-protein coupled
receptors and as an intracellular signaling molecule, plays essential
roles in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion and migration
(Hofmann et al., 2008; Neubauer and Pitson, 2013; Shida et al., 2008).
Speciﬁcally, the Sphk2/S1P axis has emerged as an important player in
cerebral ischemia (Pfeilschifter et al., 2011). The expression of Sphk2
but not that of Sphk1 is enhanced by a short-duration of ischemia that
induces preconditioning protection (Blondeau et al., 2007; Wacker

et al., 2009). Consequently, the induction of Sphk2 by isoﬂurane or
hypoxic preconditioning acts through neuronal and microvascular
mechanisms to mediate ischemic tolerance (Wacker et al., 2009, 2012a,
b; Yung et al., 2012). Moreover, the sphingosine analog ﬁngolimod
(FTY720), which is speciﬁcally phosphorylated by Sphk2, confers protection in rodent stroke models in a Sphk2-dependent manner (Wei et al.,
2011; Yung et al., 2012). Additionally, Sphk2 knockout mice exhibit larger infarcts compared to wild-type littermates (Pfeilschifter et al., 2011).
Although accumulating evidence suggests that Sphk2 is essential for
brain protection following stroke, we currently know very little about
the role of Sphk1 following ischemic stroke. Sphk1 and Sphk2 might
not play redundant roles as suggested by their tissue-speciﬁc expression
patterns and differential sub-cellular localizations (Blondeau et al.,
2007). Speciﬁcally, increasing evidence suggests that Sphk1 and its
product S1P are essential mediators of the inﬂammatory responses induced by various inﬂammatory stimuli (Dixon et al., 2012; Herrera
et al., 2007; van Leyen et al., 2005). Thus, in contrast to the protective
role of Sphk2, Sphk1 possibly exacerbates stroke outcomes via a proinﬂammatory mechanism. We tested the hypothesis in this study and
provided evidence suggesting that Sphk1 plays a deleterious role

following cerebral ischemia by acting as an important mediator of poststroke neuroinﬂammation.

Methods
Mouse model of transient focal cerebral ischemia
All animal protocols were conducted according to the regulations of
the Laboratory Animal Care of Soochow University. Male CD-1 mice (8to 9-week-old) were purchased from the SLAC Company (Shanghai,
China). Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced in the
mice using an intraluminal monoﬁlament technique as described previously (Wang et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2010). Brieﬂy, the mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane. A laser probe was afﬁxed to the mouse skull to
monitor cortical perfusion (Periﬂux System 5000, PERIMED Inc.,
Stockholm, Sweden). For the MCA occlusion, the tip of a nylon thread
(6-0) was heat-blunted and further coated with silicon. The thread was
introduced into the right internal carotid artery through the right external
carotid artery. The thread was advanced until the tip of the thread
reached the origin of the middle cerebral artery as evidenced by an abrupt
drop in cortical perfusion. After 60 min of occlusion, the thread was withdrawn to allow reperfusion. The mice that displayed cortical perfusions
below 25% of the baseline value during the occlusion and cortical reperfusion exceeding 75% of the baseline were included. Sham surgeries were
performed exactly as the MCAO procedures were conducted with the exception of the thread insertion. Body temperatures were maintained at
37 ± 0.5 °C with a heating lamp during the MCAO surgeries.
Animal groups
To investigate post-MCAO induction of Sphk1, mice were subjected to
1 h of MCAO and brain tissue was harvested at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h
after reperfusion for qPCR assessment of Sphk1 or Sphk2 mRNA levels
(n = 4 for each point). Brain tissue was also harvested at 6, 12, 24 and
48 h after reperfusion for Western blot analysis of post-ischemic induction of Sphk1 protein (n = 5 for each time point). To investigate the effects of post-ischemic induction of Sphk1 on stroke outcomes, mice
were randomly divided into the following groups: the mice receiving vehicle or the Sphk1 inhibitor 5C at 3 h after reperfusion (n = 8 for infarction analysis at 24 h and n = 13 for infarction and behavioral analysis at
96 h after reperfusion) and mice receiving intracerebroventricular (ICV)
injection of nonsense (NS) siRNA or Sphk1 siRNA and subsequent
MCAO at 2 days after ICV injection (n = 10 for infarction analysis at
24 h after reperfusion). To investigate the effects of Sphk1 inhibition or
knockdown on post-MCAO neuroinﬂammation, qPCR assessment of
pro-inﬂammatory mediators was performed on brain tissue harvested
at 24 h after reperfusion from the cortexes of the mice receiving vehicle
or the Sphk1 inhibitor 5C and the mice receiving ICV injection of NS or
Sphk1 siRNA (n = 3–4).
Drug administration
At 3, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after reperfusion, the mice were injected
with 2 mg/kg of the Sphk1 inhibitor 5C (CAY10621, Cayman Chemical,
Ann Arbor, MI, USA) via the tail vein. 5C is a selective inhibitor of
Sphk1 (IC50 = 3.3 μM) that does not have inhibitory effects on Sphk2
(Park et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2009). Speciﬁcally, the inhibitory effects
of 5C on Sphk1 have been validated in an in vivo mouse model at the
dose of 2 mg/kg (Tu et al., 2010). The inhibitor 5C was supplied as a
methyl acetate solution. To prepare the 5C solution for intravenous injection, a vial containing 5C was exposed to a gentle stream of nitrogen
until all of the methyl acetate solvent evaporated. Next, the 5C was
dissolved in DMSO and further diluted with saline. Mice that received
intravenous injections of vehicle (0.1% DMSO in saline) served as
control animals.

Intracerebroventricular injection of siRNA
The siRNA knockdown technique was used to reduce target gene
expression in the cortical penumbra in the mouse MCAO model, as
previously reported (Hayakawa et al., 2012). Brieﬂy, the mice were
intracerebroventricularly injected with Sphk1 siRNA or NS siRNA at
2 days before MCAO. The coordinates for the right lateral ventricle
were 0.5 mm posterior to, 0.8 mm lateral to and 2.5 mm below bregma.
The siRNA complexes were prepared according to the in vivo siRNA
transfection protocol for brain delivery outlined in the PolyPlus Transfection reagent instructions (PolyPlus Transfection, IIIkirch, France).
Each mouse was administered 2 μg of siRNA in a 4-μL mixture. The sequences of the siRNAs were as follows: Sphk1 sense strand (5′-GGGC
AAGGCUCUGCAGCUCdTT-3′), and NS sense strand (5′-UAGGCGCAGC
UCCGGAUCGdTT-3′).
Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
At the indicated time-points, samples were harvested from the cortical penumbral areas as described in our previous publication (Cheng
et al., 2011) or from primary microglial cultures. Total RNA was isolated
with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA, USA). cDNA was reverse
transcribed from 1 μg of total RNA using a high-capacity cDNA synthesis
kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Real-time PCR was
performed with the cDNA on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using the SYBR Green technique. The thermal cycling parameters for the qPCR were as follows: incubation at 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at
95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The mRNA levels of the target genes
were normalized to the 18S mRNA levels. The qPCR primers were as
follows:
Sphk1 forward primer: 5′-ACAGTGGGCACCTTCTTTC-3′
Sphk1 reverse primer: 5′-CTTCTGCACCAGTGTAGAGGC-3′
Sphk2 forward primer: 5′-CGGATGCCCATTGGTGTCCTC-3′

18S forward primer: 5′-TCAACACGGGAAACCTCAC-3′
18S reverse primer: 5′-CGCTCCACCAACTAAGAAC-3′
Western blot analysis
The mice were decapitated at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after reperfusion.
The cortical tissues were harvested and homogenized on ice in RIPA
lysis buffer (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The homogenates were centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the
supernatants were collected. The protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc,
MA, USA). Equal amounts of denatured proteins (denatured at 95 °C for
5 min) were electrophoresed on 10% Tris-glycine gels and transferred to
a PVDF membrane. Next, the membrane was blocked in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% non-fat milk
for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against Sphk1 (1:300, Abgent, San Diego, CA, USA) or
β-actin (1:2000, Huaan Biotechnology Company, Hangzhou, China)
overnight at 4 °C. Then, the membranes were washed and incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (1:2000,

protein bands were analyzed using ImageJ software. The ﬁnal results
are expressed as the ratios of the optical densities of Sphk1 to those of
β-actin.
Immunohistochemistry
Under deep anesthesia, the mice that were subjected to MCAO
were transcardially perfused with saline and 4% paraformaldehyde
24 h after reperfusion. The brains were collected, post-ﬁxed in 4%

paraformaldehyde and subsequently maintained in 30% sucrose solution overnight. Brain blocks that surrounded the ischemic lesion
(+1.18 to −0.10 mm from bregma) were cut into 16-μm-thick coronal
sections with a cryostat. After blocking with PBS containing 3% BSA, the
sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight with the following primary
antibodies: rabbit-anti-Sphk1 (Abgent, San Diego, CA, USA), mouseanti-NeuN (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), or goat anti-Iba1 (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK). The expressions of Sphk1, NeuN and Iba1 were detected with secondary antibodies conjugated with AlexaFluor (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). The images were digitized with a Zeiss confocal microscope (Jena, Germany).

Evaluation of infarct volumes
The mice were decapitated under anesthesia 24 and 96 h after
MCAO. The brains were collected and cut into 2-mm-thick coronal
slices. The sections were stained using 1% 2, 3, 5-tripheyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 10 min at 37 °C and further
ﬁxed in 10% paraformaldehyde solution for 24 h. The images were
photographed, and the infarct volumes were analyzed across the sections with image analysis software. The hemispheric infarct volumes
were also analyzed after correction for edema and expressed as
corrected hemispheric infarction.

Neurological deﬁcit assessment
Neurological deﬁcits were evaluated 96 h after reperfusion in a
blinded manner using the following 5-point neurological scoring system: 0, no neurological deﬁcit; 1, failure to extend the left forelimb
fully when the mouse was lifted by the tail; 2, circling toward the contralateral side; 3, rolling or leaning to the contralateral side; 4, no spontaneous locomotor activity; and 5, death.

30 min. Next, ATP detector was added to stop the reactions, and the
plates were maintained at room temperature for 10 min to stabilize
the luminescent signal. Luminescence, which was negatively correlated
with Sphk kinase activity, was recorded with a microplate Reader
(FilterMax F5, Molecular devices, US). Kinase activities are expressed
as the percentage of the kinase activity of the cortical samples collected
from the sham-operated mice.
Primary microglia cultures

Sphk activity assay
To determine the post-ischemic induction of Sphk activity, tissue
samples were collected from the cortical penumbra of the mice at 6 h
after reperfusion and from the corresponding regions of the shamoperated mice. To investigate whether Sphk1 siRNA and 5C blunted
the post-ischemic induction of Sphk activity, Sphk1 siRNA or NS siRNA
were injected 2 days before MCAO, and 5C or vehicle were administered
3 h after reperfusion. Tissue samples were collected from the cortical
penumbrae at 6 h after reperfusion. Sphingosine kinase activity was
assessed using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kit (Echelon, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) per the manufacturer's instructions. Brieﬂy, cortical samples were lysed with 50 mM Tris buffer
(pH = 7.5) containing 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% lauryl sulfate,
0.5% deoxycholic acid and 1% Igepal CA-630. After centrifugation at
13,200 rpm/min for 20 min, the supernatants were collected. The protein concentrations were determined with a commercial BCA kit
(Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Rockford, IL, USA). Ten-microliter extracts were added to a 96-well plate containing 10 μL sphingosine solution/well. To initiate the reactions, 20 μL ATP solution was added into
the wells, and the plates were maintained at room temperature for

Primary microglia were prepared from 1- or 2-day-old mouse pups as
previously described (Hu et al., 2012). Brieﬂy, after the removal of the meninges and blood vessels, the whole brain was cut into ∼1 mm3 pieces and
incubated at 37 °C in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Eagle's balanced salt solution
containing 0.01% trypsin. After 10 min of incubation, regular microglial
medium (DMEM/F12 supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/mL
penicillin/streptomycin and 10% heat-inactivated FBS) was added to neutralize the activity of trypsin. Next, the tissue was triturated with a pipette.
After centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min, the cells were collected and resuspended in microglial medium. The cell suspensions were ﬁltered
through a 200-μm nylon cell drainer. The cells were seeded in 150-cm3
culture ﬂasks and maintained with regular microglial medium. After a
conﬂuent monolayer of glial cells was obtained, the microglia were shaken off, collected and seeded onto 24-well plates.
Primary cultures of cortical neurons and oxygen–glucose deprivation
(OGD)
Primary cortical neurons were prepared from 16-day-old mouse
embryos as previously reported (Cheng et al., 2011). Brieﬂy, the cortical

tissue was dissected, cut into ∼1 mm3 pieces and incubated at 37 °C in
Ca2 +- and Mg2 +-free Eagle's balanced salt solution containing 0.01%
trypsin. After 10 min of incubation, bovine fetal serum was added to
neutralize the activity of trypsin and the tissue was triturated with a
pipette. After centrifugation at 1000 rpm, the cells were collected and
resuspended in neuronal culture media (Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 and 2 mmol/L Glutamax). The cell suspensions
were ﬁltered through a 70-μm nylon cell drainer. The cells were seeded
onto 24-well plates pre-coated with poly-D-lysine and maintained at
37 °C in an atmosphere consisting of 95% air and 5% CO2. Beginning
3 days in vitro (DIV), one-half of the medium was replaced with fresh
medium twice weekly. The neurons were subjected to OGD at 11 DIV.
Brieﬂy, the neuronal culture medium was replaced with OGD buffer
(Dulbecco PBS supplemented with 1 mmol/L CaCl2 and 0.8 mmol/L
MgCl2). Next, the neurons were maintained in anoxic chamber ﬁlled
with 95% N2 and 5% CO2 for 3 h. For reoxygenation, the OGD buffer
was replaced with the neuronal culture medium, and the cells were
then removed from the anoxic chamber and returned to normoxia. At
24 h after the re-oxygenation, the OGD-conditioned media were
collected and stored at — 70 °C for later use. Neuronal culture media
collected from neurons without OGD treatment served as the control.
Induction of neuroinﬂammation in primary microglia with conditioned media collected from OGD-treated neurons
Primary microglia were seeded on 24-well plates and maintained in
regular microglia media. At 24 h after seeding, the media were replaced
with conditioned media collected from OGD-treated neurons (OGD
Neuron CM) or media from control neurons without OGD treatment
(Neuron media). Microglia that were maintained in regular microglia

media (Media) served as controls. To investigate whether the Sphk1 inhibitor 5C suppressed neuroinﬂammation in this in vitro model, microglia exposed to OGD neuron CM were co-treated with vehicle or
the Sphk1 inhibitor 5C at the concentrations of 1, 10 and 50 μM. To
quantify the Sphk1 mRNA and mRNA expressions of the inﬂammatory
mediators, the total RNA was isolated from the primary microglia at
6 h after exposure to CM and quantitative real-time PCR was performed
as described earlier.
Statistical analyses
The data are presented as the means ± the SEMs with the exception
of the neurological scores, which are depicted as the medians ± the
ranges. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVAs with the
Tukey's post-hoc tests. The neurological scores were analyzed using
the Mann–Whitney rank-sum test. Differences were considered statistically signiﬁcant when P b 0.05.
Results
Sphk1 but not Sphk2 was induced by pathological ischemic insults
The mortality of mice following MCAO was reported in Table 1.
There was no difference in mortality among the treatment groups. In
our study, 1 h of MCAO resulted in signiﬁcant infarct damage in the
mice. Compared to the Sphk1 mRNA in the non-ischemic, contralateral
cortex or that in the cortex of the sham-operated mice, Sphk1 mRNA in
the cortical penumbra was signiﬁcantly increased by 1 h of MCAO, and
this increase began at 6 h and persisted until 96 h after reperfusion
(Fig. 1A). Interestingly, Sphk2 mRNA levels were not altered in the

cortical penumbra following 1 h of MCAO (Fig. 1B). Western blot further
showed the induction of Sphk1 protein in the cortical penumbra following MCAO (Fig. 1C). Immunohistochemical results revealed that the
Sphk1 signal (red) was largely co-localized with the microglial marker
Iba1 and the neuronal marker NeuN in the cortical penumbra at 24 h
after reperfusion (Fig. 1D), suggesting that microglia and neurons
were the major cellular sources responsible for Sphk1 induction following cerebral ischemia.

Inhibition of Sphk1 reduced infarct volumes and improved behavioral
outcomes
To investigate the role of Sphk1 following cerebral ischemia, we examined the effects of the Sphk1 inhibitor 5C on the infarct volumes and
behavioral outcomes at 24 and 96 h after reperfusion using the mouse
MCAO model. To ensure that comparable ischemic insults were induced
in mice, we used laser Doppler to monitor the decrease in cortical

perfusion at 5 min after MCAO. The decrease in cortical perfusion,
expressed as % baseline, was not different between the vehicle and
5C-injection group (vehicle vs. the 5C-injection group: 12.3 ± 0.6% vs.
11.6 ± 0.5% for infarction analysis at 24 h after reperfusion, and
12.0 ± 0.7% vs. 12.0 ± 0.8% for infarction and behavioral analysis at
96 h after reperfusion). Compared to the vehicle, daily injections of 5C
beginning 3 h after reperfusion reduced infarct volumes at 24 h
(Figs. 2A and B) and 96 h after reperfusion (Fig. 2C). Moreover, postischemic inhibition of Sphk1 with 5C improved the behavioral outcomes at 96 h following MCAO (Fig. 2D).
We further used the siRNA knockdown approach to investigate the
role of Sphk1 in cerebral ischemia. Intracerebroventricular injection of
siRNAs has been reported to decrease target gene expression in the cortical penumbra in the mouse MCAO model (Hayakawa et al., 2012). We
used this strategy to blunt post-ischemic induction of Sphk1 in the cortical penumbra. Nonsense (NS) siRNA or Sphk1 siRNA was administered
via ICV injection 2 days prior to MCAO. As expected, compared to the
nonsense (NS) siRNA, Sphk1 siRNA effectively attenuated the ischemic
induction of Sphk1 mRNA and protein in the cortical penumbra at
24 h after MCAO (Figs. 3A and B). The Sphk1 siRNA-injected mice
displayed cortical infarcts that were smaller than those of the NS
siRNA-injected mice at 24 after reperfusion (Figs. 3C and D). Moreover,
the decrease in cortical perfusion, expressed as % baseline, was not different between the scramble and Sphk1 siRNA-injection group
(11.2 ± 0.4% vs. 11.6 ± 0.5%).

Sphk1 inhibition and knockdown decreased neuroinﬂammation following
MCAO
Neuroinﬂammation contributes to the pathogenesis of stroke (An
et al., 2014; Leak et al., 2014; Zhou et al., 2014). Because Sphk1 has
been reported to play essential roles in regulating inﬂammation (van
Leyen et al., 2005) and because we found that microglia were the
major cellular sources of Sphk1 induction following MCAO, we investigated whether Sphk1 mediated post-stroke neuroinﬂammation. To
that end, we performed qPCR to determine whether if Sphk1 inhibition or knockdown suppressed the expression of pro-inﬂammatory
mediators in the ischemic brain following MCAO. At 24 h after
MCAO, the mRNA levels of IL-1β, iNOS, IL-6 and TNF-α were signiﬁcantly increased in the ischemic cortex compared to the contralateral cortex and the cortexes of the sham-operated mice.
Compared to the vehicle and the NS siRNA, the Sphk1 inhibitor 5C
and Sphk1 siRNA signiﬁcantly attenuated the ischemic induction of
these pro-inﬂammatory mediators (Fig. 4).

MCAO enhanced Sphk activity in the ipsilateral cortex, which was attenuated by Sphk1 knockdown or inhibition
To investigate whether MCAO-induced expression of Sphk1 resulted
in enhanced Sphk activity and whether Sphk1 and 5C attenuated the
post-ischemic induction of Sphk activity in the ischemic brain, we measured Sphk activity at 6 h after reperfusion following MCAO. We chose
this early time-point based on our observation that Sphk1 expression
was induced as early as 6 h after reperfusion (Fig. 1). Moreover, if
Sphk1 activity contributed to the infarct evolution and the enhanced
neuroinﬂammation at 24 h after reperfusion, we think that the activity
increase should occur earlier than the timepoint of 24 h. Consistent
with the results regarding Sphk1 expression, we observed that Sphk activity was signiﬁcantly enhanced in the cortical penumbra compared to
the contralateral cortex and the cortexes of the sham-operated mice
(Fig. 5). Furthermore, compared to the NS siRNA and the vehicle,
Sphk1 siRNA injected 2 days before MCAO and the administration of
5C 3 h after reperfusion signiﬁcantly blunted ischemia-induced Sphk activity in the cortical penumbra at 6 h after reperfusion (Fig. 5).

Sphk1 inhibition suppressed microglia-mediated neuroinﬂammation in the
in vitro ischemia condition
OGD-treated neurons have been shown to prime primary microglia
to the pro-inﬂammatory phenotype with a conditioned medium transfer approach (Hu et al., 2012). To further investigate whether the postischemic induction of Sphk1 acted through a microglial mechanism to
modulate neuroinﬂammation under the ischemic condition, we utilized
this conditioned medium transfer approach in vitro. Primary microglia
were treated with conditioned media (CM) collected from control neurons without OGD treatment or from post-OGD neuronal cultures. Compared to the microglia that were maintained in regular microglial
medium and the microglia that were treated with CM collected from
control neurons, Sphk1 mRNA was induced in the primary microglia
that were treated with CM collected from the post-OGD neurons at
6 h after CM treatment (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, compared to the regular
microglial medium and the CM collected from the control neurons, the
CM from the post-OGD neurons remarkably induced the mRNA expressions of the pro-inﬂammatory mediators (IL-1β, iNOS, IL-6 and TNF-α).
This induction was dose-dependently attenuated by the Sphk1 inhibitor
5C. At doses above the IC50 (IC50 = 3.3 μM), 5C robustly inhibited the
mRNA expression of the pro-inﬂammatory mediators induced by the
OGD-conditioned neuronal media, whereas at 1 μM (bIC50), 5C only
partially inhibited the induction of the pro-inﬂammatory mediators.
5C per se had no effect on cell viability at the tested concentrations
(data not shown). Collectively, these results suggest that Sphk1 inhibition suppressed microglia-mediated neuroinﬂammation under the ischemic condition in vitro.

Discussion
This study presented two novel ﬁndings. First, the expression of
Sphk1 but not that of Sphk2 was rapidly and persistently induced in
the ischemic brain over 96 h following MCAO. Second, in sharp contrast
to the protective role of Sphk2 following cerebral ischemia, the postischemic induction of Sphk1 exacerbated stroke outcomes by promoting neuroinﬂammation possibly via a microglial mechanism. Our results

suggest that Sphk1 is an important mediator of neuroinﬂammation following stroke.
Although stroke is one of the leading causes of death and adult disability, current therapies for stroke are rather limited (Chen et al.,
2014; Deng et al., 2014; Leak et al., 2014). Thus, investigations of the
mechanisms underlying stroke pathogenesis and the identiﬁcation
novel targets for the treatment of stroke are urgently needed (Lai
et al., 2014). Sphingosine kinases (Sphks) are the rate-limiting enzymes
responsible for the synthesis of the lipid signal transducer S1P. Sphk2
has been implicated in stroke pathogenesis (Blondeau et al., 2007;
Pfeilschifter et al., 2011; Wacker et al., 2009, 2012b; Yung et al., 2012).
Although the cerebral expression of Sphk2 is induced by short-

duration hypoxia that preconditions the brain against later noxious ischemic insults, Sphk2 expression in the ischemic brain remains unaltered following the long-duration ischemia that leads to brain damage
(Blondeau et al., 2007; Yung et al., 2012). In our study, 1 h of MCAO resulted in signiﬁcant infarct damage and had no effect on cerebral Sphk2
expression over 96 h after reperfusion, which is consistent with the
ﬁndings of the above-mentioned publications. In contrast, we observed
that Sphk1 mRNA and protein were persistently induced in the cortex
penumbra by 1 h of MCAO over 96 h after reperfusion. We further conﬁrmed that the stroke-induced expression of Sphk1 resulted in elevated
Sphk activity in the cortical penumbra. A recent publication showed
that the cerebral protein levels of Sphk1 are remarkably reduced in

168

the ischemic core at 24 h after MCAO (Hasegawa et al., 2013). It is generally acknowledged that the majority of cells die within 24 h of MCAO
in the core of ischemic lesion. Thus, the decrease in Sphk1 expression at
24 h after MCAO might reﬂect the universal degradation of cellular proteins in dying cells. In the present study, we observed the induction of
Sphk1 expression in the cortical penumbra, which is an area that consists of potentially viable and reversibly injured tissues and is considered to be a target area for stroke therapies (Lo, 2008).
Using the immunohistochemical approach, we revealed that the microglia were one of the major cellular sources of the post-ischemic induction of Sphk1 in vivo. Moreover, in the in vitro model, Sphk1
expression was induced in the primary microglia that were primed to
the inﬂammatory phenotype by ischemic neurons. Emerging evidence
suggests that Sphk1 is induced by various proinﬂammatory stimuli,
such as LPS and sepsis (Herrera et al., 2007; Tu et al., 2010). Moreover,
it is well established that neuroinﬂammation is rapidly induced in the
ischemic brain following cerebral ischemia (An et al., 2014; Hu et al.,
2012; Zhou et al., 2014). Thus, our observation that the expression of
Sphk1 was induced in the microglia under ischemic conditions is
consistent with the previous reports about Sphk1 induction in proinﬂammatory conditions (Herrera et al., 2007; Tu et al., 2010).
Using pharmacologic and siRNA knockdown approaches, we further
showed that the post-ischemic induction of Sphk1 played a deleterious
role in cerebral ischemia. In contrast to our ﬁndings, it has been reported
that Sphk1 gene knockout mice exhibit infarct volumes that are comparable to those observed in wild-type mice at 24 h after MCAO
(Pfeilschifter et al., 2011). The different approaches (gene knockdown
vs. knockout) utilized might account for this discrepancy. Indeed, in
the Sphk research ﬁeld, it is not uncommon for gene knockout and
siRNA knockdown approaches to yield contradictory results in vivo.
For example, in the thioglycollate-induced peritonitis and collageninduced arthritis models, Sphk1 knockout mice exhibit normal immune
responses during both the acute and chronic phases (Michaud et al.,
2006). In contrast, treatment with Sphk1 siRNA signiﬁcantly ameliorates disease severity and articular inﬂammation in the collageninduced arthritis model, whereas Sphk2 siRNA contradictorily exacerbates inﬂammation (Lai et al., 2009). It has been speculated that mice
with a deletion in Sphk1 from embryonic development adapted to not
rely on the Sphk1 pathway because the Sphk isoenzymes are, at least
partially, functionally redundant. However, such adaption is unlikely
to occur when Sphk is transiently decreased by siRNA in normal animals
(Lai et al., 2009).
We further investigated the mechanisms by which Sphk1 induction
exacerbated stroke outcomes. Increasing evidence suggests that Sphk1
is a critical mediator that promotes inﬂammation (Spiegel and
Milstien, 2011). The induced expression of Sphk1 has been reported to
act through its product, the second messenger S1P, to lead to systematic
inﬂammation and the release of various pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
(Spiegel and Milstien, 2011). Both our in vivo and in vitro results indicated that microglia were one of the cellular sources of the postischemic induction of Sphk1. Moreover, the Sphk1 inhibitor and
cerebral knockdown of Sphk1 signiﬁcantly attenuated the MCAOinduced neuroinﬂammation in the ischemic brains. To further reveal
the microglial mechanism underlying the deleterious effects of Sphk1
on stroke outcomes, we utilized a previously reported in vitro ischemia
model in which primary microglia are polarized to the inﬂammatory
phenotype by conditioned media collected from OGD-treated neurons
(Hu et al., 2012). Using this in vitro strategy, we provided evidence
that the Sphk1 inhibitor was able to act through microglia to suppressed
neuroinﬂammation under the ischemic condition. 5C is a selective inhibitor of Sphk1 that does not have inhibitory effects on Sphk2 (Park
et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2009). In the in vitro ischemia model, 5C
dose-dependently inhibited microglia-mediated neuroinﬂammation,
and robust effects were at doses higher than the IC50 for Sphk1. At
doses lower than the IC50 for Sphk1, 5C only partially inhibited the neuroinﬂammation induced by neuronal ischemia. These dose-dependent

effects of 5C strongly suggested that the suppressive effects of 5C on
microglia-mediated neuroinﬂammation were mediated by Sphk1
inhibition.
One limitation of this study is that we did not investigate whether
Sphk1 acted through neuronal mechanisms to exacerbate stroke outcomes. Using the immunohistochemical approach, we observed that
neurons were another major type of cells that expressed Sphk1 following MCAO. Thus, neuronal Sphk1 might also play important roles in
stroke pathogenesis. Our ﬁndings that the knockdown and inhibition
of Sphk1 conferred protection following MCAO contrast the traditional
view that Sphk1 is pro-survival (Neubauer and Pitson, 2013). Therefore,
the mechanism by which the neuronal induction of Sphk1 exacerbates
stroke outcomes needs further investigation.
Moreover, we did not investigate in the study how post-ischemic induction of Sphk1 exacerbated neuroinﬂammation following stroke. It
has been reported that Sphk1 and its production of S1P are essential
to the canonical NF-κB activation pathway that is important in inﬂammation (Alvarez et al., 2010). S1P binds with TRAF2 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2) and serves as an indispensible cofactor
for TRAF2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, leading to phosphorylation of IκB
kinase and subsequent phosphorylation and degradation of IκB. Degradation of IκB in turn activates NF-κB. Since NF-κB activation is a wellrecognized mechanism underlying stroke-induced neuroinﬂammation,
it is likely that post-ischemic Sphk1 exacerbates neuroinﬂammation via
the S1P–TRAF2–NF-κB axis.
In conclusion, Sphk1 but not Sphk2 was induced in the ischemic
brain. The post-ischemic induction of Sphk1 signiﬁcantly contributed
to acute infarct damage by promoting microglia-mediated neuroinﬂammation. Thus, our study indicated that Sphk1 is an important mediator
of post-stroke neuroinﬂammation. Dissecting the mechanisms underlying the deleterious effects of Sphk1 might provide new therapeutic
strategies for stroke.
