The natural product totarol, a phenolic diterpenoid and a major constituent isolated from the sap of Podocarpus
totara, has been reported to have a potent antimicrobial activity. In this study, we determined whether totarol
possessed an additional neuroprotective activity in vitro and in vivo. We found that totarol prevented
glutamate- and oxygen and glucose deprivation-induced neuronal death in primary rat cerebellar granule neuronal cells and cerebral cortical neurons. Totarol increased Akt and GSK-3β phosphorylation, Nrf2 and heme
oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein expressions and suppressed oxidative stress by increasing GSH and SOD activities.
The PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 prevented totarol neuroprotective effect by suppressing the totarol-induced
changes in HO-1 expression and the activities of GSH and SOD. The HO-1 inhibitor ZnPPIX also prevented
totarol-increased GSH and SOD activities. In a model of acute cerebral ischemic injury in Sprague–Dawley rats,
produced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery for 2 h followed by 22 h or 46 h of reperfusion, totarol signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume and improved the neurological deﬁcit. In this model, totarol increased HO-1 expression and the activities of GSH and SOD. These observations suggest that totarol may be a novel activator of the
Akt/HO-1 pathway protecting against ischemic stroke through reduction of oxidative stress.

Ischemic stroke is a common cause of adult disability and death
worldwide (Donnan et al., 2008; Pandian et al., 2007). Excessive oxidative stress is an important pathogenic mechanism in ischemic stroke.
Major reductions of endogenous antioxidative systems increase excessive production of free radicals, inducing lipid peroxidation, proteins
and nucleic acid oxidation (Candelario-Jalil, 2009; Granger et al.,
1986). Therefore, therapeutic strategies against oxidative stress may
be feasible for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
Protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) are both serine/threonine kinases. Akt is a key kinase
suppressing GSK-3β activity, which pathway activation has been reported to show beneﬁcial effects in ischemic brain injury (Zhang et al.,
2012; Zhao et al., 2014). Evidences suggest that phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway also regulates the activity of nuclear factor
erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which plays a key role in regulating
cellular antioxidant systems and maintaining redox homeostasis (Ishii
et al., 2000; Kaspar et al., 2009). Under normal conditions, Nrf2 interacts
with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) which limits Nrf2mediated gene expression in the cytosol. Under conditions of oxidative

stress, the Keap1–Nrf2 complex is dissociated, Nrf2 translocates and accumulates in the nucleus and together with small Maf proteins binds to
antioxidant response element (ARE) regions in the promoter of Nrf2mediated genes, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (Kang et al., 2005;
Kobayashi and Yamamoto, 2005).
HO-1, a ubiquitous and redox-sensitive inducible stress protein that
can degrade heme to CO, iron, and biliverdin (Stocker et al., 1987), is a
ARE-dependent transcription of phase II enzyme with potent antioxidant effects (Kim et al., 2011). HO-1 may regulate the antioxidant substance glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (Gonzales
et al., 2006; Lecube et al., 2014), suggesting that HO-1 may play an important role in suppressing neuronal injury.
Totarol, a phenolic diterpenoid (Fig. 1A), is a major constituent isolated from the sap of Podocarpus totara which is a native tree in New
Zealand (Bendall and Cambie, 1995). It is well-known that totarol exhibits antiplasmodial (Clarkson et al., 2003), antimicrobial (Muroi and
Kubo, 1996), and antifungal activities (Yamaji et al., 2007). However,
whether totarol possesses neuroprotective effects has not yet been
described.

In this study, we determined totarol neuroprotective effects and the
relevant underlying mechanisms. Our results indicated that totarol exhibits neuroprotective effects through activating the Akt/HO-1 pathway, further increasing antioxidant GSH and SOD levels to suppress
ischemia-induced brain injury.

GSK-3β (Ser9) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). The rabbit anti-MAP-2 antibody was obtained
from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). The assay kits for GSH, SOD, and
LDH, and RIPA buffer were purchased from Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology (Nanjing, Jiangsu, China). The rat cerebral cortical neuron
isolation kit was obtained from the CHI Scientiﬁc Inc. (Wuxi, Jiangsu,
China). The protease inhibitor cocktail was purchased from Roche
(Indianapolis, IN, USA). Total RNA extraction reagent and cDNA synthesis kit were purchased from Vazyme (Nanjing, Jiangsu, China).
2.2. Animals
Male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats (250–280 g) were purchased from
Zhejiang Laboratory Animals Center (Hangzhou, China) and kept
under standard housing conditions at a temperature between 20 °C
and 23 °C, with a 12 h light–dark cycle and a relative humidity of 50%.
All procedures were performed following institutional approval in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
published by the US National Academy of Sciences (http://oacu.od.nih.
gov/regs/index.htm). All animal tests and experimental procedures
were approved by the Administration Committee of Experimental Animals in Jiangsu Province and the Ethics Committee of China Pharmaceutical University.
2.3. Focal cerebral ischemia procedure
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was performed
as reported previously (Chen et al., 2014). The right common carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery
(ECA) of individual rats were visualized. A monoﬁlament nylon suture
(diameter of approximately 0.26 mm) with a round tip was inserted
into the ICA through the ECA stump and gently advanced to the MCA.
After 2 h of MCAO, the ﬁlament was withdrawn to restore blood ﬂow
(reperfusion). Body temperature was remained at 37 °C with a temperature control system. In addition, all animals had free access to food and
water.
2.4. Drug treatment in animal models
Animals were randomly divided into six groups (n = 8–12 per
group): Sham, Vehicle, totarol (0.1 μg/kg), totarol (1 μg/kg), totarol
(10 μg/kg) and edaravone (3 mg/kg), respectively. Edaravone was
used as a positive control, because it has therapeutic effects on ischemic
stroke as a free radical scavenger (Watanabe et al., 1994; Yoshida et al.,
2006). Rats were intravenously treated with totarol and edaravone at
2 h, 4 h and 6 h after ischemia onset.
2.5. Measurement of neurological deﬁcit and cerebral infarct volume
The neurological deﬁcits of individual rats were measured by the
Longa's method with minor modiﬁcations in a blinded manner at 24 h
or 48 h after MCAO (Longa et al., 1989). The neurologic deﬁcits were
scored on a ﬁve-point scale: 0, normal function; 1, ﬂexion of the torso
and contralateral forelimb on lifting the animal by the tail; 2, circling
to the contralateral side but normal posture at rest; 3, reclination to
the contralateral side at rest; 4, absence of spontaneous motor activity.
After assessment of neurological deﬁcit, rats were sacriﬁced and their
brains were rapidly dissected on ice and sectioned into 2 mm coronal
sections. The brain sections were inspected for the presence of macroscopic intracranial hemorrhage, and then stained with 2% TTC for
20 min at 37 °C, followed by overnight immersion in 10% formalin in
PBS. The infarct size was evaluated by morphometric analysis (imagepro plus) as described previously (Kilic et al., 1999). The infarcted tissues remained unstained (white), whereas normal tissues were stained
red. The infarct volume was evaluated by morphometric analysis
(image-pro plus).

2.6. Primary rat cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) culture
CGCs were isolated from 8 day old Sprague–Dawley rat pups as previously described (Wang et al., 2014). Cerebella were collected and
placed in ice-cold Hank's balanced saline solution (HBSS). After removing the meninges carefully, the cerebellum was transferred into warm
0.25% trypsin solution and digested for 15 min at 37 °C. The digestion
was stopped by addition of two volumes of DMEM supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) medium and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I.
The digested tissues were triturated and then centrifuged at 1500 ×
rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The tissues were resuspended in complete
Neurobasal culture medium supplemented with 2% B27 and 0.5 mM
GlutaMax and the suspension was ﬁltered through a 70 μm nylon cell
restrainer. The cells were diluted to 1 × 106 cells/mL and seeded in
poly-L-lysine coated plates. The cultures were incubated in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C.
2.7. Primary fetal cortical neuron culture
Day E18 embryos were obtained as previously described (Liu et al.,
2013). E18 Sprague Dawley pregnant rats were sacriﬁced by cervical
dislocation and immersed in 75% EtOH for short-term disinfection.
After opening the abdomen of the E18 rat, the fetuses were immediately
dissected, their heads were cut with scissors and placed in ice-cold
HBSS. The scalp and skull of the fetuses were peeled away, and the cortex was removed and placed into ice-cold HBSS. The following steps
were performed according to the primary cortical neuron isolation kit
(CHI Scientiﬁc Inc.).
2.8. Cell culture treatments
Excitotoxicity was induced by exposing CGCs to 200 μM glutamate
for 24 h, or by serum substitute B27 deprivation for 24 h. To determine
the totarol neuroprotective effects, the cells were pretreated with different concentrations of totarol for 24 h. To determine whether the PI3K/
Akt pathway was involved in the neuroprotective effects of totarol,
the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor LY294002 was added 1 h prior to totarol
treatment.
2.9. Oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)
When cells were pretreated with totarol for 24 h, the complete medium was replaced with glucose-free Earle's balanced salt solution
(EBSS, pH 7.4) and transferred to a hypoxia chamber containing a mixture of 95% N2 and 5% CO2 for 6 h. After OGD, complete medium was replaced for an additional 24 h in normal conditions with 95% air and 5%
CO2 at 37 °C. Control cells without OGD were maintained in the normal
conditions.
2.10. MTT assay
CGCs were pretreated with different concentrations of totarol for
24 h and then incubated, in different experiments, with 200 μM glutamate, or without nutrient B27 for an additional 24 h, or under OGD conditions. Primary fetal cortical neurons were treated with 100 μM
glutamate for 10 min in experimental buffer composed of 120 mM
NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 0.4 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM NaHCO3, 20 mM HEPES,
1.2 mM Na2SO4 supplemented with 15 mM glucose and 1.2 mM CaCl2
at pH 7.4. Cultures were rinsed with 1.2 mM MgCl2-supplemented experimental buffer and returned to preconditioned media for 24 h incubation. Cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml MTT for 4 h in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. After 4 h, the medium was
replaced with DMSO, and absorbance was measured at 570 nm in a
BD plate-reader.

2.11. Measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity
CGCs were pretreated with 20 μM LY294002 for 1 h, followed by
5 μM totarol for 24 h, and exposed to 200 μM glutamate for a further
24 h. Primary fetal cortical neurons were treated with 100 μM glutamate
for 10 min in experimental buffer followed by preconditioned media
culture for 24 h. The culture medium was collected and measured by
LDH assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2.12. Western blot
In vitro experiments: after treatment, cells were collected by TrisGlycine SDS lysis buffer, and the lysates were boiled for 10 min. The extracted whole cell proteins were separated by electrophoresis on SDSPAGE gels to determine the levels of phospho-Akt, phospho-GSK-3β,
Nrf2 and HO-1 protein. In vivo experiments: 24 h after surgery, the
brain samples from ipsilateral and contralateral cerebral cortex were
homogenized with RIPA buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor
cocktail. The extracted protein was quantiﬁed by BCA analysis, followed
by electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE gels to determine the levels of HO-1
protein.
Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF)
membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween20 (TBST,
pH 7.4) and incubated with primary antibodies. After washed with
TBST, the membranes were exposed to the secondary antibodies for
1 h at room temperature. Following four washes with TBST, the blots
were visualized using chemiluminescence and Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS.
The resulting bands were quantiﬁed using densitometric analysis and
were normalized to the levels of β-actin protein.
2.13. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
To determine the levels of gene expression, total RNA was extracted
from cells or the brain cerebral cortex using TRIzol reagent. Isolated RNA

145

was reverse transcribed into cDNA synthesis kit following standard
techniques. Quantitative PCR was performed using the synthetic
primers and SYBR Green with IQ5 Detection System. The ampliﬁcation
conditions were 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The primer pairs were as follows (forward and reverse, respectively): heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1),
5′-CAGAAGGGTCAGGTGTCCAG-3′ and 5′-GAAGGCCATGTCCTGCTCTA3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 5′-ATGACT
CTACCCACGGCAAG-3′ and 5′-TGGAAGATGGTGATGGGTTT-3′. The
GAPDH normalized data are presented as the fold change in gene expression in the treatment group compared with controls.

2.14. GSH and SOD measurement
The GSH and SOD activities in cells or cerebral cortex homogenates
were measured by using GSH and SOD assay kits according to the
manufacturer's instructions.

2.15. Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was carried out as previously described
(Chen et al., 2014). The brain sections were treated with 10% normal
goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for
1 h. Then they were incubated with diluted rabbit anti-MAP-2 antibody (1:300) and mouse anti-HO-1 antibody (1:300) overnight at 4
°C. After rinses with PBS for three times, sections were incubated in
a mixture of both Alexa Fluo-488 conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:500) and Alexa Fluo-635 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. And the nuclei were
counterstained with Hoechst 33342 at room temperature for 10 min.
Tissues were visualized with Olympus FV1000 Confocal microscope
(Japan).

least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed
using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test. A P

procession of ischemia/reperfusion. Pretreatment of CGCs with totarol
prevented cell damage induced by OGD insult in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 1D). As shown in Fig. 1E, CGCs were incubated
with various concentrations of totarol for 72 h, and totarol at concentrations up to 5 μM showed no toxicity. These results suggested that totarol
protected neuronal cells from neurotoxicity. Therefore, the 5 μM totarol
was used in the following cell studies.

3. Results
3.2. Totarol induces Akt/GSK-3β pathway in CGCs
3.1. Totarol prevents glutamate-, nutrient deprivation-, and OGD-induced
neurotoxicity in CGCs in a dose-dependent manner
Excitotoxicity caused by glutamate has been shown to contribute to
neuronal injury in stroke (Castellanos et al., 2008; Choi, 1988). Hence,
we examined various concentrations of totarol to test neuroprotective
effects against excitotoxicity (Fig. 1B). A 5 μM totarol concentration exhibited maximum neuroprotective effect. Moreover, in several brain
diseases such as ischemia-stroke, the differentiated neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) lack sufﬁcient nutrients, and they require nutrients such as serum to support neuron survival (Raff et al., 1993). As
shown in Fig. 1C, co-incubation of the B27-deprived CGCs with totarol
dramatically decreased cell death. In addition, the OGD insult, followed
by oxygenation and nutrient recovery, is thought to mimic the

Akt phosphorylation may inhibit GSK-3β activity, which is neuroprotective against ischemic injury (Grimes and Jope, 2001; Zhao et al.,
2014). Hence, we investigated the effect of totarol on Akt phosphorylation. When CGCs under normoxic conditions were treated with
5 μM totarol, we found increased Akt phosphorylation after 15 and
30 min of incubation (Fig. 2A). The Akt/GSK-3β pathway has also
been shown to play crucial roles in glutamate-induced apoptosis
(Chalecka-Franaszek and Chuang, 1999). Glutamate, at a concentration of 200 μM, decreased Akt(Ser473) and GSK-3β(Ser9) phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B, C). The pretreatment of
CGCs with 5 μM totarol for 24 h, prevented the time-dependent glutamate decrease in Akt(Ser473) and GSK-3β(Ser9) phosphorylations
(Fig. 2B, C).

After Glu incubation or OGD condition, the complete culture medium was added into neurons and maintained for 24 h. Cell viability was detected using MTT assay.

3.1. Totarol induces Nrf2 and HO-1 expressions and GSH and SOD activities
in CGCs

decrease in GSH and SOD activities was abolished by the HO-1 inhibitor
ZnPPIX (Fig. 3E, F).

Previous studies described that PI3K/Akt pathway was involved in
the induction of Nrf2 and ARE-driven gene expressions (Hamdulay
et al., 2010; Marin et al., 2004). To investigate the Nrf2/ARE activating
properties of totarol, we measured Nrf2 and HO-1 expressions. Totarol
time-dependently enhanced Nrf2 protein expression in CGCs under
normoxic conditions (Fig. 3A). In addition, totarol increased HO-1 expression in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner in CGCs
under normoxic conditions (Fig. 3A–C).
Glutamate signiﬁcantly decreased Nrf2 protein expression in CGCs
in a time-dependent manner, alterations prevented by totarol (Fig. 3D).
In addition, we investigated the oxidant scavenger GSH and the antioxidant enzyme SOD (Zhang et al., 2013). Previous studies have demonstrated that glutamate induced cell apoptosis usually via reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production, and GSH and SOD play vital roles in
the antioxidant system of cells (Gunasekar et al., 1995; Savolainen
et al., 1998). Treatment with glutamate alone decreased GSH and SOD
activities, but this effect was prevented by totarol (Fig. 3E, F).
To verify the role of HO-1 in the totarol-enhanced GSH and SOD activities, we used one speciﬁc HO-1 inhibitor ZnPPIX (Lin et al., 2013;
Ohnishi et al., 2010). The effect of totarol on the glutamate-induced

3.2. The neuroprotective effect of totarol is mediated via the Akt/HO-1
pathway
We used LY294002, a speciﬁc PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor, to detect
whether totarol exhibits neuroprotective effect via Akt/HO-1 pathway
(Chen et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2015). LY294002 markedly inhibited
totarol-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 4A) and HO-1 expression
(Fig. 4B). LY294002 also attenuated totarol-enhanced GSH and SOD activities (Fig. 4C, D). In addition, LY294002 and Akt inhibitor MK-2206 reversed the neuroprotective effect of totarol on glutamate-induced
neuronal injury (Fig. 4E, F). These results indicated that the neuroprotective effect of totarol is mediated via Akt/HO-1 pathway.
3.3. Totarol prevents glutamate- or OGD-induced neuronal injury in rat primary cortical neurons
Consistent with totarol neuroprotective effects in CGCs, totarol also
dose-dependently prevented neuronal injury in rat primary cortical
neurons exposed to glutamate or OGD, comparable to 50 μM edaravone
(Eda) effects (Fig. 5A, B). The PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor LY294002

SOD activity (D) were determined at 24 h after ischemia. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD of individual group of rats (n = 3–5). *P b 0.05, **P b 0.01, ***P b 0.001.

Y. Gao et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 289 (2015) 142–154

reversed the neuroprotective effect of totarol on glutamate-induced
cortical neuronal injury (Fig. 5C). When cortical neurons under
normoxic conditions were treated with 5 μM totarol, we found totarol
increased Akt phosphorylation in 10 min of incubation (Fig. 5D). In addition, OGD condition decreased Akt(Ser473) phosphorylation in cortical neurons, while pretreatment with 5 μM totarol prevented this effect
(Fig. 5E).
3.4. Totarol reduced infarct volume and improved the neurological deﬁcit
after acute focal cerebral ischemia
To investigate whether administration of totarol exhibits neuroprotective effects in vivo, we examined the neuroprotective effect of totarol
in tMCAO rats. A post-ischemia administration of totarol was used in
order to mimic the clinical situation of patients with acute stroke.
When the rats with 2 h of occlusion and 22 h of reperfusion were ﬁrst
treated at 2 h post-ischemia induction, followed by administration at
4 h and 6 h post-ischemia induction, as shown in Fig. 6, the administration of totarol (1 and 10 μg/kg) or edaravone (3 mg/kg) showed significant decreases in infarct volume compared with the Vehicle group.
Furthermore, treatment with totarol (1 or 10 μg/kg) or edaravone
(3 mg/kg) dramatically improved the ischemia-induced neurological
deﬁcit (Fig. 6C). We also found that the administration of totarol
(10 μg/kg) signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume and improved the neurological deﬁcit in rats at 48 h after the onset of ischemia (Fig. 7). These
ﬁndings suggest that totarol is neuroprotective in acute focal cerebral
ischemia.

3.5. Totarol induces HO-1, GSH and SOD production in the cerebral cortex of
rat following acute focal cerebral ischemia
To further explore the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective
effect of totarol in vivo, we investigated the antioxidant protein HO-1
and GSH and SOD activities in the cerebral cortex of rats with MCAO.
We analyzed HO-1 mRNA and protein expression in the cerebral cortex
of rats with MCAO. Totarol (10 μg/kg) signiﬁcantly increased HO-1
mRNA (Fig. 8A) and protein expression (Fig. 8B) in both the ipsilateral
and contralateral cerebral cortexes, compared to the Vehicle group (ischemia treated with vehicle). In comparison with the Sham group (operated but no ischemia), the activities of GSH and SOD in rats subjected
to MCAO and treated with vehicle were remarkably decreased. Treatment with totarol totally prevented the ischemia-induced decrease in
GSH activity (Fig. 8C), and partially but signiﬁcantly prevented SOD activity (Fig. 8D) in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex.
In addition, administration of totarol (10 μg/kg) signiﬁcantly increased HO-1 protein expression in the striatum compared to the Vehicle ischemic group (Fig. 9), indicated by double staining showing the
colocalization of HO-1 protein and MAP-2-positive neurons.
4. Discussion
We report, for the ﬁrst time, that totarol has neuroprotective effects
in primary neuronal cultures and in a brain ischemia rodent model. We
also explored the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of totarol, as illustrated in Fig. 10. The present study

Fig. 9. Totarol administration increased the expression of HO-1 protein in the striatum of rats with tMCAO. Double staining showed the colocalization of HO-1 with MAP-2-positive neurons. The expression of HO-1 was increased after tMCAO compared with Sham group, and totarol (Tot, 10 μg/kg) signiﬁcantly increased the expression of HO-1 compared with Vehicle
group. Scale bar = 50 μm. ***P b 0.001 versus Sham group; ###P b 0.001 versus Vehicle group (tMCAO).

demonstrated that totarol increased the expressions of Nrf2 and HO-1,
and GSH and SOD activity via activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling
pathway.
We tested, in vitro, the neurotoxic effects of three primary neuronal
injury factors: exposure to excitotoxic concentrations of glutamate, nutrient deprivation, and glucose and oxygen deprivation. Prior reports
have demonstrated that glutamate is one of the most important excitatory amino acids in the nervous system, and excessive glutamate production or accumulation induces neuronal death (Kumar et al., 2010).
Exposure to excessive concentrations of glutamate leads to neuronal injury in primary cerebellar granule neuronal cells and primary cortical
neurons. Our report that totarol prevents glutamate-induced
excitotoxicity (Fig. 1B and Fig. 5A). Previous studies described that nutrient deprivation induces neuronal death (Chen and Aguilera, 2010;
Pang et al., 2014). We found that totarol signiﬁcantly protected CGCs
from injury resulting from incubation for 24 h under nutrient deprivation conditions by removing the serum substitute B27 supplement.
Moreover, the OGD induces neurons damage during ischemic stroke
(Chung et al., 2007). Here we report that the treatment of primary
CGCs or primary cortical neurons with totarol suppressed OGDinduced cell damage (Fig. 1D and Fig. 5B).
The in vitro model of neuronal injury using primary cultures of CGCs
exposed to excitotoxic concentrations of glutamate is well-established
(Blondeau et al., 2002; Lysko et al., 1992a; Lysko et al., 1992b; Wang
et al., 2014). Moreover, the CGCs in culture are more vulnerable to
glutamate-induced neuronal damage when compared to the cultured
cortical neurons. Therefore, we selected to study cerebellar granule
cells in vitro.
Akt is a serine/threonine kinase and plays an important role in the
regulation of cell growth and survival (Zhao et al., 2014). Prior research

Fig. 10. A scheme for the proposed mechanisms for totarol neuroprotection. The mechanisms involve not only activation of PI3K/Akt pathway, but also induction of expressions
of Nrf2 and HO-1, and activities of GSH and SOD.

has established that the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in suppressing
neuronal damage (Hetman et al., 1999). GSK-3β is a downstream target
of Akt and plays a crucial role in the regulation of numerous cellular
functions (Cross et al., 1995). Exposure to excitotoxic glutamate concentrations suppresses Akt and GSK-3β phosphorylation (Hu et al., 2013).
This is in agreement with previous reports of a major participation of
PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β pathway in glutamate excitotoxicity (Liu et al.,
2012), and inhibition of PI3K/Akt is followed by subsequent GSK-3β activation leading to glutamate-induced neurotoxicity (Nishimoto et al.,
2008). Our results demonstrate that totarol amelioration of glutamateinduced neuronal injury is associated the prevention of glutamateinduced suppression of Akt and GSK-3β activation.
Nrf2 is a neuroprotective transcriptional factor by binding to the
AREs of antioxidant genes (Kensler et al., 2007). Under stress, Nrf2
translocates into the nucleus to bind AREs of phase II and antioxidant
defense enzymes such as HO-1, inhibiting oxidative stress (Kobayashi
et al., 2004; Takagi et al., 2014). We found that totarol increased the
level of Nrf2 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3A), and prevented the
glutamate-induced suppression of Nrf2 expression (Fig. 3D). Previous
reports have suggested that HO-1 induction degrades free heme and
its metabolites CO and biliverdin, and can directly exhibit
cytoprotection (Doré et al., 1999; Zeynalov and Doré, 2009). This indicates that HO-1 may provide neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia (Panahian et al., 1999). Therefore, we incubated CGCs with
totarol, and then evaluated the levels of HO-1 expression. The data
showed that totarol increased HO-1 mRNA (Fig. 3B) and protein levels
(Fig. 3C). These results indicated that totarol induced Nrf2 and HO-1 expressions, two main factors decreasing oxidative stress, which may be
responsible for totarol neuroprotective effects.
GSH, an endogenously synthesized tripeptide thiol, is involved in
conjugation/detoxiﬁcation reactions, maintaining redox status, and
scavenging free radicals, further reducing oxidative stress (Chan et al.,
2001; Yang et al., 2011). SOD, an endogenous mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme, can scavenge free radicals and prevent the accumulation of superoxide by converting superoxide to hydrogen peroxide
(Valdivia et al., 2009). Increasing GSH and SOD activities would be expected to reduce ROS levels and antagonize ROS-induced cell death. In
the present study, we found that totarol prevented the glutamateinduced reduction of GSH and SOD activities (Fig. 3E and F). This suggests that totarol neuroprotection is the consequence of promotion of
anti-oxidative defenses. This has been further demonstrated by our
ﬁnding that the HO-1 inhibitor ZnPPIX inhibited the effect of totarol
by reversing the increase on the activities of GSH and SOD (Fig. 3E and
F). These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of totarol
may be mediated by HO-1 signaling pathway involving its downstream
GSH and SOD signaling. However, there are three isoforms of SOD
expressed in neurons (Noack et al., 1998). Which isoform of SOD is regulated by totarol needs to be further determined in the future studies.
Moreover, to clarify whether PI3K/Akt activation controlled totarol
effects, we examined the effects of PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor
LY294002 on HO-1 upregulation. The results showed that the neuroprotective effect of totarol was blocked by LY294002 by decreased HO-1 expression and the activities of GSH and SOD (Fig. 4), indicating that the
HO-1 upregulation is dependent on the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway.
These results suggested that Akt/HO-1 pathway plays an important role
in the neuroprotective effect of totarol.
In humans, the middle cerebral artery (MCA) is most commonly affected in ischemic stroke, and experimental MCA occlusion in rats is an
accepted animal model which mimics ischemic stroke in the clinic
(Chen et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2012). In this study, we used the transient
middle cerebral artery (tMCAO) model for ischemic stroke and a postischemia administration of totarol in order to mimic the clinical situation of patients with acute stroke. Our data demonstrate that administration of totarol signiﬁcantly decreased infarct volumes and improved
the neurological deﬁcit in rats at 24 h or 48 h after the onset of ischemia
(Fig. 6, 7). In addition, we also observed that totarol treatment

Y. Gao et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 289 (2015) 142–154

dramatically increased the HO-1 expression and the activities of GSH
and SOD (Fig. 8). These in vivo results suggest that totarol may be neuroprotective in ischemic stroke. More studies are needed to clarify the
detailed mechanisms for totarol neuroprotective effects in vivo.
In conclusion, we report that totarol is neuroprotective both in vitro
and in vivo, by activating the Akt/HO-1 pathway, thus contributing to a
cellular anti-oxidative defense against neuronal injury. Our study indicated that totarol may be a novel neuroprotective agent for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Future studies to evaluate the efﬁcacy of
totarol as a potential neuroprotective agent using additional animal
stroke models are warranted.
