Background: Laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (LDF) is widely used for estimating cerebral blood ﬂow changes
during intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). No investigation has systematically examined LDF efﬁcacy in standardizing outcome. We examined MCAO histologic and behavioral outcome as
a function of LDF measurement.
Materials and methods: Rats were subjected to 90 min MCAO by 4 surgeons having different levels of
MCAO surgical experience. LDF was measured in all rats during ischemia. By random assignment, LDF
values were (Assisted) or were not (Blinded) made available to each surgeon during MCAO (n = 12–17 per
group). Neurologic and histologic outcomes were measured 7 days post-MCAO. A second study examined
LDF effects on 1-day post-MCAO outcome.
Results: Pooled across surgeons, intra-ischemic %LDF change (P = 0.12), neurologic scores (Assisted
vs. Blinded = 14 ± 6 vs. 13 ± 7, P = 0.61, mean ± standard deviation) and cerebral infarct volume
(162 ± 63 mm3 vs. 143 ± 86 mm3 , P = 0.24) were not different between groups. Only for one surgeon
(novice) did LDF use alter infarct volume (145 ± 28 mm3 vs. 98 ± 61 mm3 , P = 0.03). LDF use decreased
infarct volume coefﬁcient of variation (COV) by 35% (P = 0.02), but had no effect on neurologic score COV.
Comparison with existing methods: We compared intraluminal MCAO outcome as a function of LDF use.
Conclusions: LDF measurement altered neither neurologic nor histologic MCAO outcome. LDF did not
decrease neurologic deﬁcit COV, but did decrease infarct volume COV. LDF may allow use of fewer animals
if infarct volume is the primary dependent variable, but is unlikely to impact requisite sample sizes if
neurologic function is of primary interest.

1. Introduction
Rat models of cerebral ischemia are important for increasing our
understanding stroke pathophysiology and investigation of potential therapeutics. In these models, temporary or permanent middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) is widely employed.
The middle cerebral artery (MCA) can be occluded through
either transcranial exposure or intraluminal ﬁlament insertion.
The transcranial approach allows direct MCA visualization assuring occlusion, but this requires sophisticated microsurgical skills.
Intraluminal MCAO is instead achieved by introduction of a ﬁlament into the internal carotid artery, which is advanced to occlude
the MCA (Koizumi et al., 1986; Longa et al., 1989; Memezawa et al.,
1992). This requires only a ventral cervical skin incision and isolation of the major extracranial internal and external carotid arteries.
Thus, less surgical expertise is required. The intraluminal approach
also obviates interruption of muscles of mastication and periocular edema often associated with transcranial approaches. Further,
the intraluminal ischemic insult can be performed largely in the
absence of anesthesia abrogating that potential confound in deﬁning ischemic outcome (Sakai et al., 2007). Because insertion of the
ﬁlament is blind, proper positioning of the ﬁlament so as to occlude
the MCA is uncertain. Inconsistent occlusion may cause a decreased
or variable ischemic insult. Advancing the ﬁlament too far can cause
vessel perforation and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
Use of continuous laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (LDF) to obtain
a consistent magnitude of cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) decrease
during intraluminal occlusion and reperfusion has been advocated to conﬁrm proper ﬁlament placement (Hungerhuber et al.,
2006; Schmid-Elsaesser et al., 1998; Soriano et al., 1997; Woitzik
and Schilling, 2002). However, no investigation has systematically examined LDF effectiveness in standardizing the severity of
ischemic injury. It is important to deﬁne this because the LDF system is expensive and requires an additional scalp incision and
creation of a skull burr hole in animals potentially destined for
recovery analysis.
This study was designed to test the hypothesis that LDF use
does not alter behavioral or histologic outcome from intraluminal
MCAO. Surgeons performed MCAO with and without LDF values
obtained during intraluminal MCAO. Neurologic and histologic outcome were compared measured 7 days post-MCAO. As a secondary
measure, we considered the effect of LDF on outcome variability. An
additional study was performed to assess LDF effects on outcome
in a hyperacute setting of 1-day recovery.

The rat was positioned prone. Via scalp incision, a burr hole
(3 mm diameter) was made in the right temporal bone (1 mm posterior and 5 mm lateral to bregma) to expose the dura. A small
plastic cylinder (1/8 inch internal diameter and 7 mm deep) was
glued to the burr hole. The rat was turned supine and the LDF probe
(TSI Laserﬂo, BPM 403A, TSI Inc., Shoreview MN) was inserted into
the cylinder and opposed to the dura.
Rats were prepared for MCAO as previously described (Koizumi
et al., 1986; Longa et al., 1989; Memezawa et al., 1992) with
modiﬁcation. A midline ventral neck incision was made and the
right common carotid artery identiﬁed. The external carotid artery
was isolated and the occipital, superior thyroid, and external
maxillary arteries were ligated and divided. The internal carotid
artery was dissected distally until the origin of the pterygopalatine artery was visualized. A 20-min interval was allowed for
physiologic stabilization. Arterial carbon dioxide and oxygen tensions, arterial pH, blood glucose, and hematocrit were measured
15 min pre-MCAO, 45 min post-MCAO onset, and 15 min after
reperfusion.
Rats were assigned to either LDF assisted (Assisted) or blinded
(Blinded) groups by computerized randomization. In the Assisted
group, LDF values were continuously available to the surgeon
throughout the procedure. In the Blinded group, the surgeon was
not allowed to see ﬂow velocity values displayed on the LDF monitor at any time.
To initiate MCAO, a standardized 0.25-mm diameter nylon
monoﬁlament, prepared with a silicone tip, was inserted into
the external carotid artery stump and advanced into the internal carotid artery. In the Assisted group, at least a 60% LDF
decrease from the pre-ischemic baseline value was considered
to be sufﬁcient ischemia. The surgeons were allowed to manipulate the ﬁlament during the ischemic insult so as to maintain
LDF values below this target. In the Blinded group, the ﬁlament
was advanced until a resistance was felt (typically 18–19 mm
distal to the carotid bifurcation). In both groups, LDF values were continuously monitored and recorded every minute
from 15 min prior to ischemia until 15 min after reperfusion
onset.
After 90 min MCAO, the ﬁlament was removed to allow reperfusion and the external carotid stump was ligated. The tail artery
catheter was removed. Wounds were inﬁltrated with 0.25% bupivacaine and closed with suture. Isoﬂurane was discontinued. Upon
recovery of the righting reﬂex, the trachea was extubated. The rats
were placed in an acrylic chamber with enriched oxygen for 1 h and
then returned to their cages.

2. Materials and methods
2.2. Neurologic assessment
2.1. Surgical procedures
This study was approved by the Duke University Animal Care
and Use Committee, Durham, NC.
Male Wister rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc. Indianapolis, IN) weighing 250–300 g (age 10–12 weeks) were allowed to
access water but fasted for 12 h to standardize glycemic state.
Anesthesia was induced with 5% isoﬂurane in oxygen. Following tracheal intubation, the lungs were mechanically ventilated
to maintain normocapnia. The inspired isoﬂurane concentration
was adjusted to 1.5% in 40% oxygen/balance nitrogen to maintain anesthesia. A 22-gauge needle thermistor was percutaneously
placed adjacent to the skull beneath the temporalis. Pericranial
temperature was controlled at 37.5 ± 0.2 ◦ C during anesthesia by
surface heating or cooling. The tail artery was cannulated and
used to monitor mean arterial pressure and sample blood. Heparin (50 IU) was given at the time of arterial cannulation to prevent
thrombosis.

A screening neurologic examination was performed 1 h after
reperfusion by use of a 4-point scoring system (Bederson et al.,
1986). After 1 or 7 days recovery, the rats underwent a neurologic examination to evaluate sensorimotor function. Four different
functions were evaluated (general status, simple motor deﬁcit,
complex motor deﬁcit, and sensory deﬁcit) by use of a previously described neurologic scoring system (Yokoo et al., 2004)
that incorporates the major elements of the Bederson and Garcia scoring systems (Bederson et al., 1986; Garcia et al., 1995).
Total possible scores ranged from 0 (no deﬁcit) to 48 (maximal deﬁcit). Values from this scoring system correlate with total
infarct volume in rats (Sakai et al., 2007; Sheng et al., 2012;
Yokoo et al., 2004). Observers were blinded to group assignment and were experienced in performing this scoring system.
For each surgeon, a single observer scored all animals to minimize variability in application of the scoring system between
groups.

2.3. Histologic assessment
After neurologic scoring, the rats were anesthetized with 5%
isoﬂurane and decapitated. The brains were removed, frozen to
−40 ◦ C in 2-methylbutane, and stored at −80 ◦ C. Serial quadruplicate 20-␮m thick coronal sections were taken using a cryotome
at 800-␮m intervals over the rostral–caudal extent of the infarct.
The sections were dried and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
An image analyzer digitized a section at each 800-␮m interval. The
image of each section was stored as a 1280 × 960 pixel matrix and
displayed on a video monitor. With the observer blinded to experimental condition, the following regions of interest were cursor
outlined: non-infarcted ipsilateral cerebral cortex, non-infarcted
ipsilateral subcortex, contralateral cerebral cortex, and contralateral subcortex. The area within each region of interest (mm2 ) was
determined by automated counting of calibrated pixels. Ipsilateral
non-infarcted cortex and subcortex areas were subtracted from the
corresponding contralateral regions of interest values to estimate
the area of ischemic tissue damage to control for edema (Lin et al.,
1993). Infarct volumes (mm3 ) were computed as running sums
of subtracted infarct area multiplied by the known interval (e.g.,
800 ␮m) between sections over the rostral–caudal extent of the
infarct calculated as an orthogonal projection (Warner et al., 1995).
Cortical and subcortical infarct volumes were added to obtain total
infarct volume.
2.4. Experimental designs
Experiment 1: Four surgeons participated in this study. Two were
experts and two were novices in performing intraluminal MCAO.
Surgeon #1 had more than 15 years experience and surgeon #2
had 4 years experience in performing intraluminal MCAO. Surgeon
#3 had only rudimentary experience in rodent surgery. Surgeon
#4 was a novice in performing intraluminal MCAO but had 5 years
experience with other rodent surgery models. All surgeons performed the following protocol independently. Overall, 60 rats were
randomly assigned to the Assisted group and 56 to the Blinded
group.
Experiment 2: A single surgeon (Surgeon #4) performed an additional experiment to assess whether differences in outcome were
present in hyperacute recovery as a function of intra-ischemic LDF
use. Rats were randomly assigned to either the Assisted (n = 20)
or Blinded (n = 14) groups. The above protocol was repeated with
the exception that neurologic function and cerebral infarct volume were measured 1 day post-ischemia. A concurrent sham group
(n = 6) was also included to account for latent effects of anesthesia and surgery. These animals underwent all procedures with the
exception of ﬁlament insertion.
2.5. Statistical analysis
For Experiment 1, LDF was averaged over 5 min epochs and converted to percent change from baseline (100% = averaged value over
5 min immediately prior to MCAO onset). The primary dependent
variables were Day 7 neurologic score and total cerebral infarct volume, pooling values across surgeons. For the primary analysis, all
animals were included regardless of success in meeting the 60%
LDF ﬂow decrease threshold, as the surgeons were blinded to the
magnitude of LDF decrease in the Blinded group and those who
measured neurologic and histologic outcome were also blinded to
group assignment. Data for both variables were tested for normality of distribution, which was found to be present. We then tested
for homogeneity of variance, which was present for neurologic
score, but absent for infarct volume. Accordingly, Welch’s t test
was employed to compare values between Assisted and Blinded
groups for infarct volume and the Student’s t test was used to

113

compare values for neurologic score. Post hoc analysis was then
performed on neurologic score and cerebral infarct volume for
each surgeon using a similar strategy. In those cases where normality of distribution was absent, data were analyzed using the
non-parametric Mann–Whitney U statistic. LDF changes were analyzed by repeated measured analysis of variance (with time as the
repeat variable). Bederson scores assigned at 1 h post MCAO were
analyzed by the Mann–Whitney U statistic. Physiologic data were
analyzed by Welch’s t-test. Identical procedures were used to compare Assisted and Blinded groups in the 1-day outcome experiment,
as appropriate for analysis of a single surgeon. Statistical analyses
were performed with JMP 10 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Parametric data are summarized as mean ± standard deviation and
non-parametric data as median ± interquartile range. P < 0.05 was
considered to be signiﬁcant in all tests.
3. Results
3.1. Mortality and physiologic values
For the 7-day outcome study, 122 rats were entered into the
experimental protocol, but 6 died before group assignment due to
surgical complication and were not used for further analysis. Nine
died during ischemia without complete recording of LDF data and
17 died during the 7-day recovery period yielding a total mortality
rate of 22% (26/116). The cause of death was carefully inspected
for Surgeons #2 and #4. Evidence of SAH was present in 6 cases in
the Assisted group (one for surgeon #2, ﬁve for surgeon #4) and
2 cases in the Blinded group (one for each surgeon). Therefore, we
examined LDF change in 107 rats (54 in the Assisted group, 53 in
the Blinded group) and neurologic and histologic outcome in 90
rats (43 in the Assisted group, 47 in the Blinded group).
For the 1-day outcome study, 34 rats were enrolled in the protocol. Eight died during ischemia without complete recording of LDF
data and 6 died during the recovery period. In these, evidence of
SAH was present in 7 cases (5 in Assisted group and 2 in Blinded
group). Therefore, we examined LDF change in 26 rats (15 Assisted
and 11 Blinded) and neurologic and histologic outcome in 10 rats
in each group. There were no deaths in the sham group.
Physiologic data for Experiment 1 are shown in Table 1.
Although there were several variables for which signiﬁcant differences were present, values in both groups remained within
physiologic range. Physiologic data for Experiment 2 were similar
(data not shown).
3.2. 7-day outcome for four surgeons (Experiment 1)
3.2.1. Changes in LDF
LDF data, averaged across surgeons, are shown in Fig. 1. LDF %
change from baseline during ischemia and reperfusion was not different between the Assisted vs. Blinded groups (P = 0.12, with no
interaction between group and time, P = 0.48). There was a main
effect for time (P < 0.0001), consistent with onset and offset of
MCAO. LDF values for individual surgeons are shown in Fig. 2. A
main effect was present for time for each surgeon (P < 0.0001), but
there were no differences between the Assisted and Blinded groups
(Surgeon #1, P = 0.69, Surgeon #2, P = 0.34, Surgeon #3, P = 0.31,
Surgeon #4, P = 0.53).
3.2.2. Neurologic and histologic assessment
Neurologic scores at 1 h after reperfusion onset, pooled across
surgeons, are shown in Table 2. There was no difference between
the Assisted and Blinded groups (P = 0.25). For individual surgeons,
we detected a difference between LDF groups only in surgeon #3
(P = 0.02).

normally distributed, we used non-parametric statistics to analyze
data from these two surgeons. There were no differences between
the Assisted and Blinded groups for any surgeon. LDF use did not
change coefﬁcients of variation (COV) for values pooled across
surgeons (Assisted = 43%, Blinded = 54%, P = 0.21). COV values for
individual surgeons were not calculated because values from surgeons #1 and #3 were not normally distributed.

other surgeons.

1-day total neurologic score (median value: Assisted vs. Blinded,
19 vs. 19.5, P = 0.76) or total infarct volume (median value: Assisted
vs. Blinded, 277 mm3 vs. 237 mm3 , P = 0.24). For shams, there was
no change in LDF values during the observation period (data
not shown). Negligible neurologic deﬁcit (1 ± 2) and infarction
(12 ± 16 mm3 ) were present.

This study was designed to determine if LDF use alters intraluminal MCAO outcome in the rat. In 5 out of 6 series of comparisons,
we were unable to detect an effect of availability of real-time LDF
information to the surgeon during ischemia and immediate reperfusion on post-ischemic neurologic or histologic outcome. This held
true when data from 4 surgeons were combined and true for data
from 3 of 4 surgeons when analyzed independently, despite considerable variability in the levels of surgeon experience in performing
MCAO or differences of post-ischemic recovery duration. The COV
for cerebral infarct size was smaller when LDF values were provided
during the MCAO procedure. LDF use had no effect on neurologic
score COV.
There are technical concerns for the intraluminal MCAO model
including lack of visual conﬁrmation of ﬁlament tip placement
(Laing et al., 1993; Nagasawa and Kogure, 1989) and risk of SAH
(Bederson et al., 1995; Longa et al., 1989). Variability in infarct volume or functional outcome attributable to these concerns could
decrease reliability of this model. There are methods for conﬁrmation of ischemia during intraluminal MCAO including positron
emission tomography (Martin et al., 2012), magnetic resonance
imaging (Bihel et al., 2010), laser speckle imaging (Akamatsu et al.,
2012), hydrogen clearance (Laing et al., 1993), and ﬂuorometric measurement of mitochondrial NADH (Livnat et al., 2010).
While these monitors have important roles in certain experimental
paradigms, LDF has been advocated because the LDF system is compact, easy to use, and does not require complex surgery or radionuclide use. LDF provides an estimate of relative CBF (Dirnagl et al.,
1989) and offers opportunity to continuously conﬁrm relative ﬂow

also provided for individual surgeons. For surgeons #2, #3 and #4, COV in the Assisted group were smaller by 59%, 69%, and 41% than those in the Blinded group, while COV

reduction in the monitored tissue to a standardized target value.
However, LDF only measures a small fraction (<1 mm diameter) of
the total tissue at risk for ischemia and hence offers, at best, a focal
estimate of ﬂow in a large ischemic region (Fredriksson et al., 2009).
There are reported beneﬁts from LDF use to optimize intraluminal MCAO. Using different MCAO models, Soriano et al. (1997)
reported a close relationship between the magnitude of LDF
decrease and cortical infarct volume. Both Schmid-Elsaesser et al.
(1998) and Woitzik and Schilling (2002) demonstrated LDF to be
a useful tool to conﬁrm persistent ischemia and detect accidental
SAH during ﬁlament placement. Of note, when unintended reperfusion (i.e., spontaneous increase in LDF values) occurred during
the ischemic insult, use of the LDF to reposition the ﬁlament to
restore LDF values to the intended target resulted in worse neurologic deﬁcits and larger infarct volumes, but sample sizes were
small (n = 5–6) and it was not stated whether one or more surgeons
were involved (Schmid-Elsaesser et al., 1998). These observations,
along with the relative ease in measuring LDF have likely contributed to advocacy of its use in rodent ﬁlament MCAO models
(Fisher et al., 2009).
Typically, the LDF probe is placed over the ipsilateral cerebral
convexity within the MCAO ﬂow territory (Schmid-Elsaesser et al.,

1998). This approach requires both a scalp incision and cranial
burr hole. Harada et al. (2005) took a different approach. A single
surgeon having 4 weeks experience in MCAO surgery positioned
an extracranial LDF probe beneath the temporalis via scalp incision in one-half the study rats to guide ﬁlament insertion. In the
remaining rats, no probe was placed. In rats with no probe, the ﬁlament was positioned on the basis of resistance to its advancement
into the MCA. The investigators reported fewer SAH, larger cortical
infarcts, and decreased infarct size COV when LDF was employed.
The authors concluded that LDF use might allow a smaller number
of animals in experimental designs executed by an inexperienced
surgeon. However, careful inspection of this report found arithmetic errors in the COV calculation. While reported cortical COV
values were 35% for no LDF and 29% with LDF, computation of COV
from the reported cerebral infarct volumes provided values of 32%
and 29% respectively. This difference is negligible and the study did
not assess functional outcome.
Evidence of efﬁcacy across surgeons and levels of experience
would seem necessary to justify both the cost and invasiveness of
LDF use as a standard or requisite monitor for intraluminal MCAO
when the primary goal is to establish a uniform ischemic insult
and outcome. We informally examined several reports using the

intraluminal MCAO technique to determine if there was a pattern
of outcome heterogeneity that was superior in studies that did or
did not use LDF. A pattern was not observed. In studies without LDF
use, COV for cerebral infarct volume ranged from 45 to 74% (Sakai
et al., 2007; Sheng et al., 2009), which appeared similar to those in
which LDF was used where COV ranged from 39 to 100% (Esposito
et al., 2013; Renic et al., 2009). Other than the un-blinded reports of
Schmid-Elsaesser et al. (1998) and Harada et al. (2005) described
above, we could ﬁnd no evidence of a direct test of LDF use and
MCAO outcome. These ﬁndings provided impetus for the current
investigation.
When we pooled outcome results across 4 surgeons, we could
not detect a difference in peri-ischemic LDF values between the
Assisted and Blinded groups. Further, LDF use altered neither
neurologic nor histologic outcome as measured at either 1 or 7
days post-MCAO. When the four surgeons were analyzed independently, LDF use impacted infarct size for only 1 surgeon. In the

1-day outcome experiment, LDF values were different between the
Assisted and Blinded groups but this difference was not associated
with outcome. In both cases the LDF values in the Blinded group
failed to be maintained as close to target values as was observed in
the Assisted group. We speculate that this is attributable to concern
by the surgeon that further manipulation of the ﬁlament may cause
SAH. However, the incidence of SAH was not greater in the Blinded
vs. Assisted groups. Regardless, these data indicate that LDF use
does not alter acute or sub-acute post-ischemic tissue responses
sufﬁcient to allow a consistent difference in outcome when all randomized animals are analyzed.
We did detect an effect of LDF use on 7-day total infarct volume
COV, but not neurologic score COV. To test the relevance of these
ﬁndings, power analyses were performed to predict the impact of
LDF on the number of animals needed in the Assisted and Blinded
conditions to detect a priori deﬁned differences in neurologic
score and cerebral infarct volume. As predicted by the presence of

homogeneity of variance for neurologic scores, LDF had a negligible effect on the total number of animals required per experimental
group, although this varied amongst surgeons (Table 3). In contrast,
LDF had a substantial impact on the number of animals required
to detect either a 25% or 40% difference in cerebral infarct size
(Table 4). Thus, if the primary dependent variable is cerebral infarct
size, LDF use should be of value in decreasing requisite sample size.
However, when using the comprehensive neurologic scoring system employed in this study, LDF use would not serve to appreciably
decrease the numbers of animals required to detect important differences between experimental groups.
Some investigators, with the intent to minimize intra-group
variability, may a priori exclude animals from further study that do
not achieve target LDF decrease thresholds or that fail to achieve

119

circling behavior in the immediate post-ischemic recovery phase.
To emulate this, we performed three additional post hoc analyses:
(1) exclusion of rats in the Assisted group for which the mean intraischemic LDF decrease was <60% of the pre-ischemic baseline (4 rats
for surgeon #1, 3 for surgeon #2, 7 for surgeon #3, and 2 for surgeon
#4); (2) exclusion of rats in either group not achieving a 1-h postMCAO Bederson score of 3 (1 rat for surgeon #1, 0 for surgeon #2,
5 for surgeon #3, and 1 for surgeon #4); and (3) exclusion of rats in
either group that met either or both exclusion criteria (4 rats for surgeon #1, 2 for surgeon #2, 12 for surgeon #3, and 3 for surgeon #4).
These exclusion criteria caused little change in conclusions drawn. Although the <60% LDF decrease exclusion caused
remaining intra-ischemic LDF values to be lower in the Assisted
group when pooled across surgeons (P < 0.01), no between group
difference was detected for any single surgeon (P ≥ 0.10). This
exclusion criterion also had no effect on 1-h post-ischemia neurologic scores for either pooled or individual surgeon data except
Surgeon #3, for which the between group difference was lost
(Table 5).
Table 6 shows P values for 7-day Assisted vs. Blinded group
comparisons of neurologic score and cerebral infarct volume as
a function of exclusion criteria. None of the 3 exclusion criteria
altered statistical conclusions drawn for neurologic score when values were pooled across surgeons or for individual surgeons. For
cerebral infarct size, there also was no effect on signiﬁcance of P values when data was pooled across surgeons. When surgeons were
individually analyzed no effect was present except for Surgeon
#3 for which exclusion of rats with a 1-h post-ischemia Bederson score <3 caused loss of statistical signiﬁcance between Assisted
and Blinded groups. Similarly, there was little effect of the exclusion criteria on total infarct volume COV (Table 7). Hence, neither
exclusion criteria, alone or combined, had a meaningful impact on
conclusions drawn.
In summary, we found little evidence to support LDF use as a
requisite tool for performing intraluminal MCAO. This held true

across a range of surgical expertise and when applied to both 1-day
and 7-day neurologic and histologic outcome. LDF use may be
useful to decrease the number of animals needed in experimental
groups when the primary dependent variable is cerebral infarct
size because its use is associated with a decreased COV. In contrast,
LDF use had no affect on neurologic score COV or the predicted
number of animals per experimental group to required detect
relevant interventional differences.
