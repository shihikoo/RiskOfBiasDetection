Abstract: Previous studies have indicated that bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) is
neuroprotective against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury. The present study was
undertaken to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in this effect. Adult male
Wistar rats were subjected to 2 h of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO),
followed by 24 h of reperfusion. BMP-7 (10−4 g/kg) or vehicle was infused into rats at the
onset of reperfusion via the tail vein. Neurological deficits, infarct volume, histopathological
changes, oxidative stress-related biochemical parameters, neuronal apoptosis, and
apoptosis-related proteins were assessed. BMP-7 significantly improved neurological and
histological deficits, reduced the infarct volume, and decreased apoptotic cells after
cerebral ischemia. BMP-7 also markedly enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes
superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), and reduced the level
of malondialdehyde (MDA) in IR rats. In addition, Western blot analysis indicated that
BMP-7 prevented cytochrome c release, inhibited activation of caspase-3, caspase-9 and
caspase-8. Our data suggested that BMP-7 has protective effects against cerebral IR injury
in rats, and the neuroprotective effects may be attributed to attenuating oxidative stress and
inhibiting neuronal apoptosis.

1. Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of death and adult disability worldwide [1,2]. Ischemic stroke accounts for
approximately 80% of all strokes, and occurs when a major cerebral artery is blocked by a thrombus or
embolism [3]. This blockage leads to brain injury through a complex series of pathophysiological
events leading to neuronal cell death and subsequent neurological dysfunction. Thrombolysis with
intravenous administration recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is the only approved
treatment for acute stroke, but fewer than 5% of stroke patients are eligible for this therapy, primarily
due to the narrow time window (<3 h). Besides, it does not provide reperfusion and it increases the risk
of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage [4]. Thus, there is a compelling need to develop novel
therapeutic options for patients with ischemic stroke.
Bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7), or osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1) is a member of the
transforming growth factor (TGF)-β super-family. Both BMP-7 and its receptors (BMPRs) are
expressed in the central nervous system [5,6] and can be upregulated after transient global cerebral
ischemia [7,8]. Exogenous administration of BMP-7 before methamphetamine (MA) administration
reduced the MA-induced increment in cerebral infraction, caspase-3 activation, and behavioral
deficits [9]. Pretreatment with BMP-7 prior to general hypoxia or ischemia reduced brain infarction
volume and mortality in rats [10,11]. The pre-stroke implantation of fetal kidney cells, a tissue
with high levels of BMP-7, into the rodent cortex reduced infarct volume and improved functional
recovery [12]. The protective effects of fetal kidney transplantation were attenuated after
intracerebroventricular delivery of BMP antagonist noggin [13]. Moreover, post-stroke intracisternal
or intracerebroventricular BMP-7 injection partially improves motor function two weeks after
ischemia in rats [14,15]. Taken together, these data suggest that exogenously delivered BMP-7 has
beneficial effects against ischemia.
In vitro studies demonstrated that BMP-7 has anti-oxidant [16] and anti-apoptotic [17] properties.
However, the in vivo protective effect of BMP-7 on focal cerebral ischemia and its mechanisms have
not been well elucidated. Apoptosis is one of the major pathways that leads to cell death after cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury [18]. Oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species (ROS) has long
been considered as a key deleterious factor in cerebral IR injury and may ultimately result in the
initiation of pathways that lead to apoptotic cell death [19]. Considering the facts mentioned above and
the role of apoptosis and oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of IR injury, the present study was
designed to explore the neuroprotective effects of BMP-7, as well as the underlying mechanisms by
focusing on neuronal apoptosis and oxidative stress.
2. Results
2.1. Neurological Deficits
No neurological deficits were seen in the sham group. When tested at 24 or 48 h after reperfusion,
vehicle-treated rats displayed severe neurological deficits. BMP-7 treatment significantly improved the
neurological score compared with the vehicle group (p < 0.05) (Figure 1).

2.2. Effects of BMP-7 on Infarct Volume
There was no infarct area observed in the sham group, while in the vehicle group, a significant
infarction was observed at 24 h after reperfusion. Under treatment with BMP-7, the infarct volume in
the BMP-7 group was significantly smaller than that in the vehicle group (p < 0.05) (Figure 2).

2.3. Effects of BMP-7 on Histopathology
To evaluate the effects of BMP-7 on cerebral IR injury, histological examination in each group was
performed in HE stained sections. The sham group showed normal neurons with no pathological
change. Compared with the sham and BMP-7 group, most of the neurons in the vehicle group had
disappeared. In the vehicle group, neuronal loss was severe and dying neurons showed shrunken
cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei. In the BMP-7 group, the number of surviving neurons was markedly

increased than that in the vehicle group (p < 0.05), and the extent of damage was significantly
ameliorated as well (Figure 3).

2.4. Effects of BMP-7 on MDA Content and Antioxidant Enzymes Activities
To investigate whether BMP-7 affects oxidative stress damage, we evaluated the content of MDA
and the activities of antioxidant enzyme in the penumbral cortex. The content of MDA is an index of
lipid peroxidation, which increased significantly after cerebral IR injury (p < 0.05). BMP-7 treatment
significantly decreased the MDA content compared with the vehicle group (p < 0.05). Additionally,
the activities of antioxidant enzymes including SOD and GSH-PX were decreased significantly in the
vehicle group as compared with the sham group (p < 0.05). However, BMP-7 treatment induced
significant elevation of SOD and GSH-PX activities compared with the vehicle group (p < 0.05)
(Figure 4).
2.5. Effects of BMP-7 on Neuronal Apoptosis
Neuronal injury in the penumbral cortex was analyzed by TUNEL staining. TUNEL-positive
apoptotic cells were sparsely detected in the sham group; while the apoptotic rate was significantly
increased in the vehicle group compared with the sham group (p < 0.05). BMP-7 treatment effectively
attenuated the neuronal death caused by cerebral IR injury, as indicated by significant reduction of
apoptotic rate (p < 0.05) (Figure 5).

2.6. Effects of BMP-7 on Cytochrome C Release, Cleaved Caspase-3, Cleaved Caspase-9 and Cleaved
Caspase-8 Expression after Cerebral IR Injury
We evaluate cytochrome c release, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-8
expression, to try to elucidate possible neuroprotective mechanisms of BMP-7. Western blotting
showed that there are no significant differences in total cytochrome c expression among the three
groups. Compared with the sham group, the cytochrome c expression increased significantly in the
cytosolic fraction but decreased in the mitochondrial fraction after 24 h of reperfusion in the vehicle
group (p < 0.05). BMP-7 treatment markedly elevated the expression of cytochrome c in mitochondrial
fraction and reduced that in the cytosolic fraction (p < 0.05) (Figure 6). These results suggested that
BMP-7 could significantly inhibit the release of cytochrome c.

The expression of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-8 were detected in
different groups for further investigation. From the Western blot analysis, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved
caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-8 were upregulated after cerebral IR injury; however, these changes were
remarkably attenuated by BMP-7 treatment (p < 0.05) (Figure 7).
3. Discussion
BMP-7 is a member of BMPs subfamily that has already been approved by Health Canada and the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and used to treat acute fractures and spinal fusions in more than
340,000 patients worldwide [20]. Apart from its bone formation effect, BMP-7 also exhibits powerful
effects against IR injury in a wide range of organs including brain [9], kidney [21], liver [22],
and heart [23].
Previous experiments have demonstrated that rats intravenously receiving BMP-7 at a dose of
−4
10 g/kg had significantly enhanced locomotor activity, however, these behavioral parameters were
not significantly enhanced in rats receiving a higher dose of BMP-7 (10−3, 10−2 g/kg) [8]. Moreover,
BMP-7 has a short life (about 10–30 min) and works best within a short range. Thus, we selected
10−4 g/kg as the effective dosage of BMP-7, and administered it intravenously at the onset of
reperfusion. In this study we demonstrated that BMP-7 protected against cerebral IR injury by
reducing infarct volume, improving neurological and histological deficits, and these beneficial effects
were associated with inhibition of oxidative stress or neuronal apoptosis-related pathways, such as
reduction of the MDA content, elevation of SOD and GSH-PX activities, inhibition of cytochrome c
release, and suppression of caspase-3, caspase-9 and caspase-8 activation.
Under physiological conditions ROS are generated at low levels and play important roles in
signaling and metabolic pathways [24], however, under pathologic conditions such as IR, their
overproduction lead to oxidative stress, causing cell damage to nervous tissue, which may lead to
DNA oxidation, promoting chain reactions of membrane lipid peroxidation, and alterations in
membrane fluidity [19,25,26]. ROS produces malondialdehyde (MDA), an end product of lipid
peroxidation. Therefore in the present study the level of MDA was estimated to estimate extent of
ROS. Our result showed that the elevated level of MDA was markedly decreased by treatment with
BMP-7, indicating that the neuroprotection conferred by BMP-7 may be attributed to attenuating lipid
peroxidation following transient global cerebral ischemia. The overproduction of ROS can be
detoxified by endogenous antioxidants, causing their cellular stores to be depleted [27]. Superoxide
dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) are thought to be two dominant enzymes
acting as free radical scavengers that could prevent the deleterious stroke-induced ROS
generation [28]. SOD scavenges the superoxide anion radical (O−2) by catalyzing its dismutation to
H2O2, which is scavenged to water by GSH-PX at the expense of glutathione [26]. In the present study,
BMP-7 was found to be effective in stimulating the activities of SOD and GSH-PX. Previous studies
have demonstrated that BMP-7 attenuates hypoxia-induced or H2O2-induced increase in LDH activity
in primary cortical cultures [16]. These data suggest that BMP-7 afford protection against cerebral IR
injury through the amelioration of oxidative stress.
Apoptosis plays a significant role in regulating cell death after cerebral IR injury [18]. Oxygen
deficit due to ischemia may exhaust the reserved ATP and lead to mitochondrial energy abnormality,

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2013, 14

23448

which further initiates mitochondria dysfunction and the activation of apoptotic mediators [29,30].
In this study, a great number of apoptotic cells were found in the penumbral cortex of vehicle group at
24 h after reperfusion, whereas BMP-7 treatment reduced neuronal apoptosis. These results are
consistent with recent findings showing that the neuroprotection of BMP-7 is probably through
inhibition of apoptosis [31,32].
Mitochondria play a pivotal role in regulating apoptotic pathways by releasing pro-apoptotic
proteins such as cytochrome c, apoptosis inducing factor, and Smac/DIABLO [33]. Accumulating
evidence has shown that the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria intermembrane space to the
cytoplasm triggers a cascade of pathological processes that lead to neuronal apoptosis [34,35]. There are
no significant differences in total cytochrome c expression among the three groups, however, we found
that a remarkable release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol at 24 h after reperfusion, which
was alleviated significantly by treatment with BMP-7. Further investigation showed suppressed
activation of caspase-3, caspase-9 and caspase-8 in the BMP-7 treated group. Caspase-9 is a crucial
up-stream initiator enzyme in the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway and its activation can be
achieved either by cleavage or by association with apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) to
form the active apoptosome [36]. In the death receptor pathway, ligation of a receptor belonging to the
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family leads to the induction of apoptosis through activation of
caspase-8 [37]. Both activated caspase-9 and activated caspase-8 can further catalyze down-stream
caspases including the major effector enzyme caspase-3, which leads to DNA fragmentation and
subsequently to apoptotic cell death. In our experiments, the increased activation of caspase-3, caspase-9
and caspase-8 reaches the high level at 24 h after reperfusion, which could be effectively attenuated by
BMP-7 treatment. Recent evidence suggests that exogenous administration of BMP-7 reduces the
MA-induced increment in caspase-3 activation [9]. These findings suggest that the neuroprotection
of BMP-7 is through inhibition of both intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway and extrinsic (death
receptor) pathway.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Animals
Male Wistar rats weighing 250–270 g were obtained from the Experiment Animal Center of
Qingdao Drug Inspection Institute (SCXK (LU) 20090007). All animals were housed in polypropylene
cages at an ambient temperature of 22 ± 2 °C, relative humidity 60% ± 10% under 12 h light/dark
cycle in an animal house. They were allowed free access to food and water before surgery. The study
protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Qingdao University.
4.2. Experimental Groups
Rats were randomly divided into three groups: (1) sham group; (2) vehicle group, IR injury with
phosphate-buffered saline vehicle injected into tail vein at the onset of reperfusion; (3) BMP-7 group,
IR injury with BMP-7 (10−4 g/kg) injected into tail vein at the onset of reperfusion.

4.3. Induction of Cerebral IR Injury
The cerebral IR injury model in rat was similar to that described previously [38]. Briefly, rats were
anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). A 4.0 monofilament nylon
suture with a tip rounded tip was introduced into the right external carotid artery (ECA) and gently
advanced approximately 17–18 mm from the bifurcation of the common carotid artery (CCA) to
occlude the middle cerebral artery. After 2 h of ischemia, the filament was carefully removed to
generate reperfusion injury. Rectal temperature was maintained at 36.5–37.5 °C throughout the surgery
using an incandescent lamp. Sham-operated rats underwent the same surgical procedures without
inserting a filament.
4.4. Neurological Evaluation
Neurological deficits were evaluated by an observer blinded to the treatment of animals after
24 and 48 h of reperfusion according to the method previous described [38]. Score 0: no neurologic
deficit; Score 1: failure to extend left forepaw fully; Score 2: circling to the left; Score 3: falling to the
left; Score 4: did not walk spontaneously and had a depressed level of consciousness. Rats that did not
show neurological deficits immediately after reperfusion (neurological score = 0) were excluded from
the groups.
4.5. Measurement of Infarct Volume
At 24 h after reperfusion, rats were anesthetized and then sacrificed (n = 10 in each group). The
brains were quickly removed and sliced into 5 coronal sections 2-mm thick. Each slice was immersed
in 2% TTC saline solution and incubated at 37.5 °C for 15 min, followed by 10% formalin fixation
overnight. The infarct areas and the hemisphere areas of each slice were determined by an image
analysis system (Image-pro plus 6.0, Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA). The infarct areas on
each slice were summed and multiplied by slice thickness to give the infarct volume. To compensate
for edema and atrophy, the corrected volume was calculated using the following equation: Percentage
hemisphere lesion volume = ((total infarct volume − (right hemisphere volume − left hemisphere
volume))/left hemisphere volume) × 100%.
4.6. Histological Assessment
Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, rats (n = 10 in each group) were anesthetized and
transcardially perfused with saline for 5 min, following by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in
phosphate-buffered saline. The brains were post fixed in 4% PFA overnight and then embedded
with paraffin. A tissue block spanning from the optic chiasm to 4 mm posterior to it was cut and sliced
into 5 μm sections until use. These paraffin blocks were also used for TUNEL staining. Hematoxylin
and eosin staining was performed to assess the histological injury. The damage was evaluated by
counting the number of surviving neurons per 1 mm of cortex cells under a light microscope.

4.7. TUNEL Staining
TUNEL staining was performed to visualize DNA fragmentation using a TUNEL Apoptosis
Detection Kit (Jiancheng Institute of Bioengineering, Nanjing, China). Briefly, sections were digested
by 20 μg/mL proteinase K for 15 min at 37 °C, incubated with TUNEL reaction mixture at 37 °C for
60 min and transferred to wash buffer for 30 min. Finally, the sections were visualized using a
converter-POD with 0.05% 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB). TUNEL-positive cells in the penumbral
cortex were semi-quantitatively scored in five fields.
4.8. SOD, GSH-PX Activity, and MDA Content Measurement
The rats (n = 10 in each group) were anesthetized and decapitated at 24 h after reperfusion. Cortical
tissue from the penumbral cortex was immediately isolated and stored at −80 °C until use. Cortical
tissue was homogenized in ice cold phosphate buffer to make a 10% homogenate. Then
the homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min. Superoxide dismutase (SOD),
glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the supernatant were measured by
using commercially available kits (Jiancheng Institute of Bioengineering, Nanjing, China). All assays
were conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
4.9. Preparation of Mitochondrial and Cytosolic Fraction
Cortical tissues were homogenized in ice-cold isolation buffer. The nuclei and unbroken tissue were
sedimented by centrifugation at 1000× g for 5 min. The supernatant was subjected to further
centrifugation at 12,000× g for 10 min. The resulting pellet, which consisted of mitochondrial fraction,
was gently re-suspended in isolation medium. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 12,000× g for
10 min to obtain the cytosolic fraction. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. The protein content of
each sample was measured by Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) protein assay.
4.10. Western Blot Analysis
Proteins extracted from the cytosolic and mitochondrial fraction were collected for detecting the
release of cytochrome c. Cortical tissues for cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved
caspase-8 assay were isolated and homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer. Proteins were extracted and
protein concentrations were then determined by BCA protein assay. Thirty micrograms of protein from
each sample were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride
membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline at
room temperature for 60 min. The primary antibodies were added and incubated at 4 °C overnight
including anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA),
anti-cleaved caspase-9 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA), anti-cleaved
caspase-8 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA), or anti-cytochrome c (1:1000;
Santa Cruz, CA, USA), followed by one hour incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies at room temperature. The protein bands were visualized using an enhanced
chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The signals were

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2013, 14

23451

quantified by scanning densitometry using a Bio-Image Analysis System (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
Richmond, CA, USA), and β-actin served as internal control.
4.11. Statistical Analyses
All date were expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical analysis of data was performed using one-way
ANOVA followed by the LSD post hoc test. A difference was considered significant at p < 0.05.
5. Conclusions
In summary, our data indicate that BMP-7 has protective effects against cerebral IR injury in rats,
and the neuroprotective effects may be attributed to attenuating oxidative stress and inhibiting
neuronal apoptosis. The findings provide further insight into the mechanism by which BMP-7
exerts its neuroprotection and suggest that BMP-7 might be of therapeutic value for the treatment of
ischemic stroke.
