Ethnopharmacological relevance: Gualou Guizhi decoction (GLGZD) prescribed in traditional Chinese
medicine has been reported to have protective effects on ischemic stroke. The present study is to
investigate the therapeutic effect of GLGZD on ischemic stroke and explore its mode of action.
Materials and methods: GLGZD was studied on transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
followed by reperfusion in vivo, as well as on hippocampal primary neuron cultures in vitro.
Results: In vivo, it was shown that GLGZD treatment for 7 days could ameliorate transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced neurological deﬁcit, histopathology changes and decrease
infarct area. Further study demonstrated that GLGZD inhibited over-activation of astrocytes and
apoptosis of neurons and GLGZD promoted up-regulation of neuronal speciﬁc marker neuron-speciﬁc
nuclear (NeuN) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) in brain. Moreover, the in vitro study
revealed that GLGZD treatment protected against NMDA-induced cell apoptosis and neuronal loss, and
promoted up-regulation of neuronal speciﬁc marker NeuN.
Conclusions: Taken together, the present study demonstrates that GLGZD produces a protection in the
MCAO model rats via inhibiting over-activation of astrocytes, apoptosis of neurons and up-regulation of
neuronal speciﬁc marker NeuN and MAP-2. Our study reveals that GLGZD might be a potential
neuroprotective agent for stroke and can provide basic data for clinical use.

1. Introduction
Stroke, a cerebrovascular disease, has a clear three-high (high
incidence, high morbidity, and high mortality) phenomenon and it
becomes the third worldwide leading cause of mortality and main
cause of handicap following cardiovascular diseases and cancer
(Donnan et al., 2008; Hong and Saver, 2009). It has been reported
that 70–80% of stroke survivors suffer serious physical and
cognitive disabilities, particularly post-apoplectic limb spasm,
which has become an increasingly serious social problem
(Riddoch et al., 1995; Goldstein and Rothwell, 2008). At present,
there are many agents of ischemic stroke in clinic, including
calcium channel blockers, glutamate antagonists, GABA agonists,
antioxidants/radical scavengers, phospholipid precursor, nitric

oxide signal-transduction down-regulator, leukocyte inhibitors,
hemodilution, and a miscellany of other agents (Ginsberg, 2008;
Moskowitz et al., 2010). However due to a short therapeutic time
window (Lees et al., 2010) and poor efﬁcacy or severe toxicity/side
effects of agents (Sahota and Savitz, 2011; Yu et al., 2012), there is
still lack of effective therapy. Therefore, it is extremely urgent to
develop favorable and low side-effects therapeutic agents.
Although many neuroprotective agents have been identiﬁed and
effective in extensive animal research, few are effective in clinic (Liu
et al., 2010a). There are some characteristics of traditional Chinese
medicine, such as safety with less adverse effect, abundant resources,
low-cost, and stable effect. There is an important practical signiﬁcance to explore anti-ischemic stroke drug from a rich treasure house
of traditional Chinese medicine. GLGZD, a well-known traditional
Chinese formula, was ﬁrst recorded in ‘Essentials from the Golden
Cabinet' (Zhang, 2008). It is formulated of six herbs, including
Trichosanthes kirilowii Maxim., Paeonia lactiﬂora Pall., Cinnamomum
cassia Presl., Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch., Zingiber ofﬁcinale Rosc. and
Ziziphus jujuba Mill. According to yin-yang and wu hsing (ﬁve
elements) theory of TCM in a weight ratio of 10:3:3:3:2:3. It has
long been used in clinic to treat muscular spasticity following stroke,
epilepsy or spinal cord injury in China (Zhang and Ai, 2005; Sun,

Y. Zhang et al. / Journal of Ethnopharmacology 158 (2014) 76–84

2010; Yang et al., 2010). And its granule (Min drug system approval
no. S20130001) has developed and become a standard hospital
prescription at Fujian University of TCM Afﬁliated Second People's
Hospital (Fuzhou, China). Our team's clinical study showed good
effects of GLGZD in stroke patients (unpublished data). Previously our
team has evaluated GLGZD on lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced
BV-2 murine microglial cells, which indicated that GLGZD had an
effect upon TLR4/NF-κB pathway (Longa et al., 1989; Hu et al., 2013 ).
We also investigated the neuroprotective effects of GLGZD on
glutamate-induced apoptosis in cultured BV-2 cells. Although there
are some clinical foundation and researches on BV-2 murine microglial cells, there is a little report of GLGZD against cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion injury in rats.
Therefore the current study was designed to conﬁrm the
potential effects of GLGZD on focal cerebral ischemic-reperfusion
injury and elucidate the underlying neuroprotective mechanism
by using a cerebral ischemia model-middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Moreover, the present study aimed to evaluate the
protective effects of GLGZD on hippocampal primary neuron.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Dried drugs were purchased from Tongchun drugstore (Fuzhou,
Fujian, China) and they were authenticated by Prof. Yang (College
of Pharmacy, Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine).
Voucher specimens were deposited in the College of Pharmacy of
Fujian University of traditional Chinese medicine, Fujian, PR China.
Standard substances including gallic acid, protocatechuic acid,
albiﬂorin, peoniﬂorin, liquiritigenin, liquiritin, cinnamaldehyde,
cinnamic acid, and glycyrrhizin were purchased from the National
Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products
(Beijing, China). Their structures are shown in Fig. 1. Methanol and
acetonitrile were of HPLC grade and purchased from Merck Co.

77

(Darmstadt, Germany). All other chemical reagents evolved in this
research were of analysis grade.
All speciﬁc pathogen free (SPF), male Sprague–Dawley (SD)
rats, weighing 280 720 g, were obtained from the Laboratory
Animal Center of Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The principles of laboratory animal care were followed and
the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Fujian
University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, China.
2.2. Preparation of GLGZD
According to the original prescription from the “Jinkui Yaolve”
(Zhang, 2008), to obtain GLGZD water extracts, all medical
materials were decocted by boiling in distilled water twice, 1 h
per time. The solution was then dried under microwave dryer to
obtain GLGZD powder. GLGZD powder was then stored for further
analysis.
2.3. HPLC analysis of GLGZD
zGLGZD powder was subjected to HPLC analysis. GLGZD powder was dissolved and solutions were injected into HPLC system
(Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) for analysis in triplicate. The HPLC
system was equipped with pump LC-20A system, photodiode array
(PDA) detector SPD-M20A, diamonsil C18 reversed-phase column
(I.D. 4.6 mm  250 mm, 5 μm). The mobile phase used was a
mixture of mobile phase A (acetonitrile) and mobile phase B
(water containing 0.1% phosphoric acid) in gradient: 0  5 min,
5% B; 5  50 min, 5%  32% B; 50  60 min, 32% 48% B,
65  105 min, 48% 80% B. Flow rate and injection volume were
1.0 mL/min and 10 μL, respectively.
2.4. Focal cerebral I/R model
An intraluminal suture was used for the induction of focal
cerebral ischemia as described by Longa et al. (1989) and Huang

et al. (2013) with little modiﬁcation. Concisely, rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate solution (0.3 mL/100 g, i.p.). The left
common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA) and
internal carotid artery (ICA) were exposed by a short incision and
then separated from adjacent nerves and tissue. Then, a 3-0 nylon
monoﬁlament was carefully inserted into ICA and was used to
occlude the origin of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) until
light resistance was felt (18–20 mm from CCA bifurcation). After
2 h of MCAO, the ﬁlament was withdrawn allowing reperfusion.
2.5. Experimental grouping and treatment
Forty-eight rats were divided into three experimental groups
and the treatment was carried out as mentioned below. The
experimental animals were grouped as: sham-operated group
(n ¼16): rats were subjected to surgical procedure, but MCAO
was not induced, except for exposure of ICA and ECA, and received
normal saline; MCAO model group (n ¼16): rats received normal
saline and underwent MCAO surgery; GLGZD group (n ¼16): rats
received GLGZD dose (14.4 g/kg) according to the human and
animal drug dose equivalent conversion (Xu, 2002) and underwent MCAO surgery. Rats were administered GLGZD or saline once
a day for 7 days.

overnight incubation with primary antibodies (NeuN antibody,
GFAP antibody, MAP-2 antibody) at room temperature for 2 h.
Then slices were washed using PBS and incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody at 37 1C. After washing using PBS, slices
were exposed to horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin.
Finally, slices were stained with DAB color development solution,
then washed using PBS and counterstained with hematoxylin.
Immunohistochemical score (IHS) was employed to evaluate the
slices (Soslow et al., 2000). IHS was calculated by multiplying the
percentage of immunoreactive cells (quantity score) and the
staining intensity (staining intensity score): no staining, 0;
1–10%, 1; 11–50%, 2; 51–80%, 3 and 81–100%, 4. Staining intensity
was rated on a scale of 0–3, with 0, negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate
and 3, strong.
2.10. Terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay
staining.
TUNEL staining protocol was according to the manufacturer's
instructions by using an apoptosis detection kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Apoptotic index was calculated by multiplying the
quantity and staining intensity scores as described in the IHC
analysis section.

2.6. Scoring neurological defects

2.11. Hippocampal primary neuron cultures

Neurobehavioral deﬁcit of rats were quantiﬁed using a ﬁvepoint scale: 0, no neurological symptoms; 1, unable to completely
extend the front jaw on the other side; 2, rotating while crawling
and falling to the contralateral side; 3, unable to walk without
help; and 4, unconsciousness (Longa, et al., 1989). It was evaluated
in a blinded fashion. Rats with a score of 1–3 points were
considered a successful model and included in the study.

Hippocampal primary neurons were cultured from the cerebral
hippocampi of newborn SD rats (from the Center of Experimental
Animal, Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine) within
24 h. Brieﬂy, newborn rats were sacriﬁced. Hippocampi were
dissected from the brain, and all the meninges were removed
thoroughly under a dissecting microscope. All the tissues were
collected in a conical tube containing neurobasals medium (Life
technologies) supplemented with 2% B-27s serum-free supplement (Life technologies) and 0.5 mM GlutaMAX™-I (Life Technologies) at 4 1C. Then the supernatant was carefully removed leaving
only the tissue covered by the medium, whereafter 2 mg/ml of
papain (Sigma) was added. The tissues were incubated with
papain for 15 min at 37 1C. Enzymatic solution was removed and
1 mL complete neurobasals medium was added to the tube to
disperse the tissue by pipetting up and down. Let undispersed
pieces settle by gravity for 2 min. The cells were transferred to a
new tube leaving behind all the debris. Another 1 mL papain was
added and the cells were spined at 1100 rpm for 1 min. The
supernatant was removed and the cells were resuspended in
1 mL of complete neurobasals medium by pipetting up and down.
The cells were counted using a cell counter and trypan blue.
Optimal cell densities were seeded onto poly-D-lysine (Sigma)
coated 96-well plate or 6-well plate. The cells were incubated at
37 1C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2 atmosphere. Half of
the culture medium was replaced every third day. More than 90%
cells were neurons as veriﬁed by positive staining of microtubuleassociated protein-2 (MAP-2) against DAPI (Fig. 2). Neurons were
used at tenth day. During this period, neurons developed extensive
neuritic networks and formed functional synapses.

2.7. 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining
Eight rats of each group were sacriﬁced by 10% chloral hydrate
and perfused transcardiacally with 0.9% NaCl, then were decapitated to take out the brain quickly. Brains were stored at 20 1C for
10 min, and then cut into six coronal slices (2 mm) continuously
from front to back. The brain tissues were immersed into 2% TTC
solution (T8877; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and stained at 37 1C for 1 h and
turned over several times. A high-resolution digital camera
(IXUS130; Canon, Tokyo, Japan) was used to capture images and
Motic Med 6.0 Digital Medical Image Analysis system (Motic
Instruments Inc., Richmond, Canada) was used to calculate infarct
volume. The infarct volume was calculated as a percentage of the
viable cerebral tissue of the whole brain (Bederson et al., 1986).
2.8. Cerebral histopathology
The eight rats of each group were sacriﬁced by 10% chloral
hydrate and perfused transcardiacally with 4% paraformaldehyde
solution and 0.9% NaCl, then brains were taken out the quickly.
Brains were parafﬁn-embedded routinely, then a series of adjacent
5 μm thick sections were cut and stained with HE (hematoxylineosin). Histopathological changes were observed under a light
microscope.
2.9. Immunohistochemistry
Slices (5 μm) were collected from above parafﬁn. Brieﬂy, the
parafﬁn sections were deparafﬁnized, rehydrated, submerged in
3% hydrogen peroxide, epitope retrieved by citric acid, washed
using PBS and then blocked with goat serum, followed by an

2.12. Cell viability assay
Conventional MTT reduction assay was used to determine cell
viability. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1  104
cells per well. After ten days culturing, the original culture
medium was collected and replaced by NMDA solution for
20 min. Then neurons were washed with DMEM and returned to
the original culture medium with GLGZD (100, 200, 300 mg/mL) for
another 24 h. Finally, the medium was aspirated, dye crystals were
dissolved with 100 mL of dimethylsulfoxide and the absorbance

was read on a microplate reader (Inﬁnite M200 Pro, TECAN) using
a 570 nm ﬁlter. Cell viability was expressed as a percentage of nontreated control.
2.13. Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was used to evaluate protein level. After
treatment, cells and the left cortical tissue were collected and
lysed by lysis buffer, then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min. The
supernatant was collected and the proteins concentration was
determined by the BCA method. Then proteins were mixed with
loading buffer and incubated in 100 1C for 6 min. Ultimately,
samples were stored in  20 1C for further analyses.
Equal amounts of protein (20 mg) were electrophoresed on 12%
density SDS acrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred from the gel to PVDF membranes using an
electric transfer system. Non-speciﬁc binding was blocked with 5%
skimmed milk in TBST buffer for 2 h. Then PVDF membranes were
incubated with antibodies to NeuN (1:1000), Bcl-2 (1:1000), Bax
(1:1000) and actin (1:1000) overnight at 4 1C, after that they were
washed three times with TBST, 10 min per time. Then PVDF
membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with
second antibody (1:7000), after that they were washed three
times with TBST, 10 min per time. Finally they were evaluated
using the ECL western detection reagents.

3. Results
3.1. HPLC of GLGZD
The major components of GLGZD were analyzed by HPLC
(Fig. 3). By comparison with the standard reference compounds,
nine compounds were identiﬁed: gallic acid (1), protocatechuic
acid (2), albiﬂorin (3), peoniﬂorin (4), liquiritigenin (5), liquiritin
(6), cinnamaldehyde (7), cinnamic acid (8) and glycyrrhizin (9).
The percentage content of the nine compounds was estimated
using a calibration curve method. Nine compounds present in

The effect of GLGZD on neurological deﬁcits was evaluated by
measuring neurological performance using a ﬁve-point scale as
described in Section 2. As shown in Fig. 4A, the rats in the shamoperated group (score: 0) showed no neurological deﬁcits; while
the rats in the MCAO model group showed neurological deﬁcit
(score: 1–3) such as circling towards the contralateral side with a
reduced mobility unable to completely extend the front jaw on the
other side, rotating while crawling and falling to the contralateral
side. GLGZD signiﬁcantly improved the neurological symptoms in
the GLGZD-treated group.

breakdown, as well as some vacuolar degeneration and inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration. There was vacuolization in the cytoplasm.
However, after treatment with GLGZD, infarct area was markedly
reduced, the extent of damage was signiﬁcantly diminished as
well. Cytoplasmic hypervacuolization was decreased.
3.4. GLGZD treatment prevents ischemia-induced loss of neuron
and inhibits activations of astrocytes in brain
As shown in Fig. 6A and C, there was a robust loss of neurons in
cortex after ischemia. However, neuronal injury in cortex was
signiﬁcantly prevented by GLGZD treatment. After ischemia,
astrocytes displayed reactive changes in cortex of MCAO model
group which was characterized by increasing the expression of
GFAP. The number of astrocytes in MCAO model group was higher
than that in sham-operated group. GLGZD treatment signiﬁcantly
inhibited the astrocytic activation in brain (Fig. 6B).
3.5. GLGZD treatment inhibits apoptosis in MCAO rats
Data in Fig. 6D show that GLGZD treatment decreased the
proportion of TUNEL-positive cells compared with MCAO model
group, demonstrating an anti-apoptotic activity of GLGZD in vivo.
IHS was used to evaluate the anti-apoptotic activity of GLGZD for
further evaluate these results.
Moreover, as shown in Fig. 7, there was a signiﬁcant decrease in
the protein level of Bcl-2 and increase in the protein level of Bax in
NMDA group, indicating higher apoptosis existed in cortical tissue.
GLGZD treatment up-regulated the protein level of Bcl-2 and
down-regulated the protein level of Bax signiﬁcantly. Taken
together, it is suggested that the GLGZD treatment inhibits
apoptosis in MCAO rats.
3.6. GLGZD treatment protects NMDA-induced cytotoxicity
in hippocampal neurons
Data in Fig. 8 show that after incubation with NMDA, the cell
viability was decreased to 49.1%. Treatment with GLGZD (100, 200,
300 μg/mL) decreased the cell death rate in a concentration
dependent manner (cell survival ratio was 51.2%, 67.1% and
82.3%, respectively).

mean 7SD. nnPo 0.01 vs MCAO, ##Po 0.01 vs sham.

3.7. GLGZD treatment up-reglulates the expression of NeuN
in hippocampal neurons

The cerebral infarct volume of rats was also determined to
evaluate the impacts of GLGZD treatment for 7 days after MCAO.
As shown in Fig. 4B and C, the mean infraction volume in the
MCAO model group was signiﬁcantly higher than the shamoperated group. GLGZD reduced the infarct volume to 0.31 70.12
as compared with that of the MCAO model group.

4. Discussion

3.3. GLGZD treatment improves cerebral histopathology
As shown in Fig. 5, in the sham-operated group, the brain
tissues kept intact, neurons were eumorphism and distributed
uniformity and cytoplasm was pale pink and abundant, no
inﬂammatory cells inﬁltrated. In contrast, in MCAO model group,
the ischemic side of the brain exhibited disorder and high levels of
cell necrosis, with cells showing nucleolar shrinkage and

Western blot analysis revealed a signiﬁcant decrease in the
protein level of NeuN in NMDA group (Fig. 9), indicating higher
apoptosis existed in hippocampal neurons. GLGZD (100, 200,
300 μg/mL) treatment prevents the decrease of NeuN signiﬁcantly.

A stroke, sometimes referred to as a cerebrovascular accident
(CVA), cerebrovascular insult (CVI), or colloquially brain attack, is
the loss of brain function due to a disturbance in the blood supply
to the brain. This disturbance is due to either ischemia (lack of
blood ﬂow) or hemorrhage (Sims and Muyderman, 2009). There
are permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion model and focal
cerebral ischemia model in experimental stroke (Antonuccia et al.,
2010; Li et al., 2013a) Focal cerebral ischemia model is more close
to human beings. Therefore a reversible model of focal ischemia
(i.e. MCAO model) is more relevant than the permanent occlusion
model. The major advantages of this model are ﬁrstly the method
is relatively simple and secondly the middle cerebral artery can be
occluded and reperfused without craniotomy (Belayev et al., 1996).

showed that GLGZD signiﬁcantly decreased the focal infarct
volume, neurological deﬁcit score and apoptosis in MCAO rats
compared to MCAO model rats. It agreed with previous reports
(Chen et al., 2014) and also this was further evidence that GLGZD
has stable and effective neuroprotective effect.
NeuN immunoreactivity is used as a speciﬁc marker for
neurons. The number of NeuN-positive cells decrease under
pathological conditions such as cerebral ischemia (Davoli et al.,
2002), hypoxia (Igarashi et al., 2001) and trauma (Sugawara et al.,
2002). The reduction in immunostainability is considered as
evidence of neuronal death in several experimental studies
(Davoli et al., 2002; Sugawara et al., 2002). It has been proved by
Davoli et al. (2002) that the depletion of NeuN immunoreactivity
in rat brains after ischemic insults was correlated with an increase
of neuronal apoptosis after double labeling with TUNEL and NeuN.
In our study, it was also shown that NeuN immunoreactivity was
markedly reduced after ischemia which was correlated with an
increase in TUNEL labeling. Moreover we also investigated NeuN
immunoreactivity in hippocampal neurons whose result demonstrated that the expression level of NeuN was decreased in NMDAinduced excitotoxicity group.
MAP-2 encodes a protein that belongs to the microtubuleassociated protein family. The proteins of this family are thought
to be involved in microtubule assembly, which is an essential step
in neuritogenesis. MAP-2 has been considered a marker for
neurons (Binder et al., 1984), and extensive recent literature
documents its utility in identifying neuronal cells in tissue culture
paradigms (Lin et al., 2011). In the present study, we found
ischemic insult resulted in down-regulation of MAP-2.
Astrocytes are sensitive to the increased release of these
immunomodulatory peptides and activated when ischemic injury

occurs in brain (Wang et al., 2007; Willis, 2011). In response to the
ischemic injury, glial cells quickly become activated and undergo
morphological transformations, and are accompanied by functional changes, such as increasing expression of cytokines: interleukins (IL-1b, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10), TNFa, interferons and chemokines
(Pickering and O’Connor, 2007; Guo et al., 2012). The accumulation
of pro-inﬂammatory factors should further induce ischemic
damages (Batti and O’Connor, 2010; Chen et al., 2014). GFAP is
an intermediate ﬁlament protein that is expressed by numerous
cell types of the central nervous system including astrocytes
(Jacque et al., 1978). In the present study, we found ischemic
injury substantially increased the expression of GFAP and GLGZD
treatment signiﬁcantly decreased the expression.
To our knowledge, some literature about Trichosanthes kirilowii
Maxim.(Chen et al., 2011a, 2011b), protocatechuic acid (Li et al.,
2013b), catechinic acid (Liu et al., 2010b), curcumin (Lei et al.,
2010), 6-gingerol (Jiang and Xia, 2007), paeoniﬂorin (Guo et al.,
2012), isoliquiritigenin (Zhan and Yang, 2006) and liquiritin (Sun
et al., 2010) proved that they had effect on cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury. In TCM, a number of herbs are often combined
under the theories of traditional Chinese medicine. The combined
interactions of these herbs are hypothesized to contribute more to
the neuroprotective effects of GLGZD compared with single use.
In summary, our data demonstrate that GLGZD produces a
neuroprotective effect on ischemic injury in the rats via upregulating NeuN, MAP-2 and down-regulating GFAP. It is suggested that GLGZD has good neuroprotective effect from results of
in vivo and in vitro.
