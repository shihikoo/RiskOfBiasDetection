Simultaneous determination of four
components in Baige capsule by HPLC:
application to pharmacokinetics and
tissue distribution of normal and middle
cerebral artery occlusion rats
Yuanji Wang, Nan Wang, Lei Wu, Wen Lu and Yanmin Zhang*
ABSTRACT: A sensitive and speciﬁc high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed and applied to the
pharmacokinetics for simultaneous identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of four components – puerarin, daidzein, imperatorin and
isoimperatorin – in the plasma and tissues of normal and middle cerebral artery occlusion rats after oral administration of Baige
capsule. Ferulic was used as the internal standard. The extraction procedure was composed of two independent steps. The
plasma was prepared by liquid–liquid extraction with light petroleum–acetic ether (1:1, v/v) ﬁrst and then protein was precipitated with methanol. The tissue samples were weighted and homogenated with normal saline, then the homogenate was prepared by liquid–liquid extraction and protein precipitation. The parameters of pharmacokinetics were calculated using DAS
2.1.1 software. The calibration curves of all four components in the plasma and tissue homogenates were in good linearity in
the measured range with R2 ≥ 0.9921. The relative standard deviation of the intra- and inter-day accuracy at different levels
was less than ±18.0%. In conclusion, the established method was a simple and effective one to simultaneously detect all four
components in the plasma and tissues of rats, and was successfully applied in the pharmacokinetics of Baige capsule. Copyright

Stroke prevention is an urgent need in present medical science.
Lifestyle modiﬁcation, in the form of diet, exercise, smoking
cessation, antihypertensive therapy, close control of diabetes
and hyperlipidemia, could prevent most strokes (Kirshner, 2012).
Baige capsule is a modern compound recipe which certiﬁed
for its activity in the convalescent period of stroke. The capsule
is composed of the extracts of Angelica dahurica (Fisch. ex
Hoffm.) Benth. et Hook. f. and Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi. In
traditional Chinese medicine, Angelica dahurica (Fisch. ex Hoffm.)
Benth. et Hook. f. has been used for centuries for its antibiotic
(Kim et al., 2011), anti-inﬂammatory and antioxidative stress
(Moon et al., 2012) and anti-asthmatic effects (Lee et al., 2011).
Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi is commonly used in cardiovascular
and cerebrovascular diseases (Wong et al., 2011), owing to its
antioxidative (Bae et al., 2011), neuroprotective (Bebrevska
et al., 2010) and anti-hypertensive effects (Ng et al., 2011).
The effective part and ingredients of Baige capsule were
screened by three kinds of cell membrane chromatography
(Zhao et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2009, 2010; Li and He, 2006),
which were excitatory amino acid receptor chromatography,
Ca2+ antagonist receptor chromatography and platelet activating factor receptor chromatography. The capsule showed apparent effects in activating blood circulation to dissipate blood
stasis, and also displayed protection effects in brain ischemia.
Our previous research has proved that Baige capsule could

signiﬁcantly reduce the infarction area of rats after middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and obviously improve the
neurobehavioral scores.
Puerarin is the main ingredient in Pueraria lobata. It shows
neuroprotective and vasorelaxation effects in modern pharmacological research (Chang et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010a,
2010b). Daidzein has antiallergic and antithrombotic activities
(Choo et al., 2002), it can also relax rat cerebral basilar artery
via activation of large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels
in vascular smooth muscle cells (Zhang et al., 2010a, 2010b).
Imperatorin can induce vasodilatation and display antihypertensive effects in vitro (Nie et al., 2009; He et al., 2007).
Isoimperatorin is an isomer of imperatorin, and has a dual
cyclooxygenase-2 selective/5-lipoxygenase inhibitory activity
(Moon et al., 2008). The chemical structures of four compounds
are shown in Fig. 1.

In order to investigate whether the active components of Baige
capsule could permeate into the brain parenchyma and eventually
display the anti-cerebral ischemia effects after oral administration,
the present study established an effective method which could
determine four main ingredients in both the plasma and the main
tissues of rats simultaneously, and the method was successfully
applied in a pharmacokinetic study. The differences in the pharmacokinetics process and tissue distributions between normal
and cerebral ischemia rats were determined.

Experimental
Reagents and materials
Standards of puerarin, daidzein, imperatorin, isoimperatorin and ferulic
were purchased from The National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products (Beijing, China). HPLC-grade methanol was
purchased from spectrum chemical (Gardena, New Bruswick, NJ, USA).
Light petroleum, acetic ether and methanol were all analytically pure. The
MCAO nylon monoﬁlament (40 mm in length and 0.24 mm in diameter)
was purchased from Beijing Sunbio BioTech Co. Ltd (Beijing, China).
Angelica dahurica was extracted by supercritical ﬂuid extraction, and
Puerariae lobatae was extracted by reﬂux extraction with 70% alcohol.
The extracts were stored at 20°C before use. The contents of the four
components in Baige capsule and the extracts were determined by HPLC
before the pharmacokinetic experiment. The single dosage of administration was as follows: 337 mg/kg puerarin; 13.1 mg/kg daidzein;
108 mg/kg imperatorin; and 66.4 mg/kg isoimperatorin.

Instrument and analytical condition
The HPLC system consisted of 2010A HT separation module, a dual-channel
UV detector and an auto-sampler (Shimadzu, Japan). Chromatographic
separation was performed on a Diamonsil C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm,
5 μm) at a ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The mobile phase consisted of (A)
methanol and (B) 0.1% phosphoric acid in water, delivered in gradient
mode [30–75% A (0–5 min), 75% A (5–12 min), 75–30% A (12–15 min)].
The detection wavelength was 300 nm and the column temperature was
maintained at 30°C. The injection volume was 20 μL.

Preparation of standard solutions

542

Stock solutions of puerarin, daidzein, imperatorin, isoimperatorin and
ferulic were prepared in methanol at 0.4 mg/mL and stored at 20°C
before use. The stock solutions were further diluted with methanol to prepare a standard solution in which the ﬁnal concentration was as follows:
120 μg/mL for puerarin; 8 μg/mL for daidzein; 80 μg/mL for imperatorin;

wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/bmc

40 μg/mL for isoimperatorin; and 20 μg/mL for ferulic. Then the standard
solution was diluted to make serial concentration gradient solutions.

Plasma sample preparation
To 100 μL plasma, 5 μL 20 μg/mL ferulic (IS) was added as the internal
standard. The samples were vortexed for 30 s, and 200 μL of light
petroleum–acetic ether (1:1, v/v) was added. The mixture was vortexed
again and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min. A 200 μL aliquot of the
supernatant was transferred to a clean tube. A 200 μL aliquot of methanol was added to precipitated proteins, then the mixture was vortexed
again and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. A 200 μL aliquot of the
supernatant was transferred to the tube, which was ﬁlled with liquid–liquid
extraction solution. The mixture of two-step extracts was rotated to
evaporate the solvent under reduced pressure at 30°C. The residues were
reconstituted with 300 μL methanol, vortexed and centrifuged at
12,000 rpm for 5 min again. The supernatants were transferred to a sample
vial for instrumental analysis.

Tissue sample preparation
Each tissue of the rats was weighed ﬁrst, then normal saline was added
to the tissues to prepare the homogenate (v/w, 1:1). To 500 μL tissue
homogenate samples, 25 μL 20 μg/mL ferulic (IS) was added as the internal standard. The samples were vortexed ﬁrst for 30 s, then 500 μL light
petroleum–acetic ether (1:1, v/v) was added. The mixture was vortexed
again and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min. A 500 μL aliquot of the
supernatant was transferred to a clean tube. A 500 μL aliquot methanol
was added to precipitated proteins, then the mixture was vortexed again
and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. A 500 μL aliquot of the supernatant was transferred to the tube which was ﬁlled with liquid–liquid
extraction solution. The rest of the procedures were the same as for
the plasma sample preparation.

Method validation
Selectivity. Selectivity was assessed by analyzing extracts of plasma
and tissue samples from six individual animals for the presence of analytical interference and comparing the results with those obtained from
spiking blank plasma and tissues. The representative chromatograms
of each component in the plasma and tissues are shown in Fig. 2.
Calibration curves. A 10 μL aliquot (50 μL to the tissue homogenate)
of different concentrations of stock solutions and 5 μL (25 μL to the
tissue homogenate) ferulic (IS) were added to 100 μL blank plasma
(500 μL blank tissue homogenate). Then the samples were prepared
according to the extraction methods which were described previously.
2
The calibration curves were ﬁtted by least-square regression using 1/x
as the weighting factor of the peak area ratio of analyte to IS. Each
standard curve was paralleled on three consecutive days.

Precision and accuracy. Precision and accuracy were determined
at low, medium and high concentrations of plasma quality control
samples (n = 5). Inter- and intra-day precision and accuracy were
assessed on a single day (n = 5) or on ﬁve consecutive days at three
different concentrations.
Extraction recovery. The extraction recoveries were determined by
comparing the peak areas of low, medium and high concentrations of
plasma quality control samples to the peak areas of standard solutions
which were diluted with the same volume of methanol (n = 5).
Stability. The stability was investigated for three storage conditions.
Plasma samples were stored at room temperature for 24 h, 20°C for
30 days and three freeze–thaw cycles (n = 5). The samples were prepared
as previously described.

homogeneously in distilled water by sonication. The mixture was administered according to the body weight of the rats. The volume of administration was 10 mL/kg.
Blood samples (approximately 0.3 mL) were collected from orbital
vein into heparinized tubes at 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360,
480, 720 and 1440 min after oral administration of the extracts.
Blood samples were centrifugated at 5000 rpm for 5 min. The
plasma was transferred to a clean tube and stored at
20°C
until analyzed.
After the animals were sacriﬁced, saline was perfused through the left
ventricle of the rats until the color of perfusion ﬂuid became light. Tissues including heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and brain were harvested
at 30, 60, 120, 240 and 480 min. Tissues were weighted and homogenized immediately with saline (1:1, v/w). The homogenates were stored
at 20°C until analyzed.

The model of middle cerebral artery occlusion
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (250 ± 20 g) were purchased from Laboratory
Animal Center of Medical College of Xi’an Jiaotong University. The
animals were housed at 20–25°C and humidity of 30–70% under 12 h a
light/dark cycle. The animals were allowed free access to water; food
was withheld for 12 h before the experiment. All the experimental procedures and protocols on animals were approved by the Ethical Committee
of Xi’an Jiaotong University for Animal Research.
The model of MCAO was carried out according to Longa et al.
(1989). Brieﬂy, rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate
(0.3–0.4 mL/kg, i.p.) and placed in dorsal recumbency. A longitudinal
incision of 1.5 cm in length was made in the midline of the ventral
cervical skin. The left common carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid
artery (ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA) were exposed and carefully isolated. A nylon monoﬁlament was inserted from CCA into ICA
and advanced 18 mm to occlude the left MCA for 2 h, and thereafter
the brain blood was allowed to reperfusion by withdrawing the
nylon thread.
The neurologic deﬁcit score was evaluated. The sensorimotor integrity was conducted to assess the neurobehavior at 1 and 24 h after
MCAO in rats (Lee et al., 2002). Five categories of motor neurological
ﬁndings were scored: 0, no observable deﬁcit; 1, forelimb ﬂexion; 2,
forelimb ﬂexion and decreased resistance to lateral push; 3, forelimb
ﬂexion, decreased resistance to lateral push and unilateral circling;
and 4, forelimb ﬂexion, unable or difﬁcult to ambulate. The rats whose
ethology score was >3 were selected for pharmacokinetic research
24 h after the reperfusion. The brain of the rats was taken out for
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (3%, m/v) staining after 24 h of pharmacokinetic study. Figure 3(a) shows a brain slice after staining.

Application to the pharmacokinetics and tissue
distribution study

Biomed. Chromatogr. 2014; 28: 541–547

Plasma concentration–time proﬁles of each component for individual
animals were analyzed using a noncompartmental model for
extravascular administration with DAS 2.1.1 package (Mathematical
Pharmacology Professional Committee of China, Shanghai, China).
All pharmacokinetics results were expressed as mean ± standard
deviation (SD). The concentration–time curves were drawn by
Graphpad prism 5.0 software. Statistical analysis was performed by
t-test (SPSS version 18.0, Chicago, IL). The level of signiﬁcance was
set at p < 0.05.

Results and discussion
Selectivity
Retention times of puerarin, ferulic, daidzein, imperatorin and
isoimperatorin were approximately 4.4, 5.9, 7.2, 10.6 and
13.6 min, respectively. Total run time was 18 min for each
analytical run. No signiﬁcant peaks interfering with the quantitation of target components were detected in the chromatograms of blank plasma and tissue homogenates. The lower
limits of quantitation (LLOQ, signal-to-noise ratio 10) of
puerarin, daidzein, imperatorin and isoimperatorin were 100,
10, 50 and 25 ng/mL, respectively.

Calibration curves
The calibration curves of plasma and tissues were obtained and
the correlation coefﬁcients for all four analytes were ≥0.99 and
RSD <20%. The results are shown in Table 1.

Pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of Baige capsule
Precision, accuracy, extraction recovery and stability
The results of intra- and inter-day precision, accuracy extraction
recovery and stability of the plasma quality control samples are
presented in Table 2. For low, medium and high concentrations
of each plasma quality control samples, the inter- and intra-day
precision was within 18% and accuracy 89–116%.
Average extraction recovery was >60% for all the four
analytes; RSD was within 19%. The extraction recovery of ferulic
(IS) was 86 ± 6.9%; RSD was 8.0%.
In all the three tested storage conditions, the plasma quality
control samples were stable with RSD ≤15%. The results indicated that plasma samples were stable under tested conditions.

Pharmacokinetics results
The mean concentration–time curves of normal rats and
MCAO rats are presented in Fig. 3. All four components could
enter the blood circulation quickly in both normal and MCAO
rats. However, the concentrations were different. For puerarin
(Fig. 3b), imperatorin (Fig. 3d) and isoimperatorin (Fig. 3e),
the concentrations were much higher in MCAO rats compared
with normal rats. Daidzein did not have an apparent absorption

process (Fig. 3c); it was directly eliminated from the blood just
like the mode of intravascular administration. Imperatorin and
isoimperatorin could be absorbed quickly and were maintained
at certain concentrations for almost 10 h (Fig. 3d, e). The main
pharmacokinetic parameters of normal rats are displayed in
Table 3.
The pharmacokinetic parameters of MCAO rats are
displayed in Table 4. The half-lives of puerarin and daidzein
in MCAO rats were signiﬁcantly prolonged compared with
normal rats (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). The area
under curve of puerarin and isoimperatorin was signiﬁcantly
increased after the injury of the operation (MCAO) (p < 0.05
and p < 0.01, respectively). The apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) of daidzein was increased (p < 0.01), but Vz/F was
decreased for isoimperatorin (p < 0.01). The clearance rate of
puerarin and isoimperatorin was signiﬁcantly decreased
(p < 0.01). The mean residence time of daidzein was signiﬁcantly increased (p < 0.01), but it was decreased for
imperatorin (p < 0.01). These results indicated that the clearance of puerarin and isoimperatorin in MCAO rats became
much slower compared with normal rats, while the clearance
of daidzein and imperatorin was increased after the trauma
of the operation (p < 0.05 and p > 0.05, respectively).

Tissue distribution

546

Tissue distribution of all four components in Baige capsule was
investigated following a single administration. The results (Fig. 4)
indicated that imperatorin and isoimperatorin underwent a
rapid and wide distribution into the tissues during the time
course both in normal and MCAO rats. Imperatorin and isoimperatorin could effectively penetrate the blood–brain barrier
and permeate into the brain parenchyma. Puerarin and daidzein
mainly existed in the liver and kidney. After the injury of MCAO,
the content of puerarin was obviously increased in the brain
(p > 0.05).
The aim of the present research was to provide a reliable
experiment to check whether the active ingredients of Baige
capsule could quickly and effectively pass the blood–brain barrier and permeate into the brain. The results showed that all four
components could get into the brain quickly. However,
imperatorin and isoimperatorin showed better pharmacokinetic

wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/bmc

behavior compared with puerarin and daidzein. The bioavailability of puerarin is very low owing to its reverse physiochemical
properties which block it from penetrating the blood–brain
barrier (Tao et al., 2013). The results of this research provides
evidence that the effective ingredients of Baige capsule may
play a signiﬁcant role in the convalescent period of stroke.

Conclusion
In the present study, a sensitive, speciﬁc, accurate and precise
HPLC method for simultaneous determination of four main active
ingredients in the plasma and tissues of normal rats and MCAO
rats was established. All four components could be well separated
and identiﬁed by two-step extraction. Speciﬁcity, linearity, accuracy, precision, and limits of detection and quantiﬁcation were examined for the analytes and were found satisfactory.

Pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of Baige capsule
The results showed that the pharmacokinetic parameters and tissue distributions were signiﬁcantly changed after the injury of
MCAO. These results provided some useful information to better
determine the pharmacokinetics process and tissue distribution of
the effective components in Baige capsule after oral administration.
