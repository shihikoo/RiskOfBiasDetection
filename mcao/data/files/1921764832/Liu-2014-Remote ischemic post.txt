Abstract Remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPostC) has
been proved to protect the brain from stroke, but the precise
mechanism remains not fully understood. In the present study,
we aimed to investigate whether RIPostC attenuates cerebral
ischemia-reperfusion injury by abating endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress response. CHOP, a multifunctional transcription
factor in ER stress, regulates the expression of genes related to
apoptosis, such as Bim and Bcl-2. Male SD rats were subjected to right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h
followed by reperfusion, and RIPostC was induced by three
cycles of 10 min ischemia and 10 min reperfusion on bilateral
femoral arteries immediately after ischemia. CHOP siRNA
(CHOPi) and control siRNA (Coni) were injected into the
right lateral ventricle 30 min before the beginning of ischemia.

RIPostC, CHOPi, or RIPostC + CHOPi application reduced
infarct volume, improved the neurological function, and decreased cell apoptosis. RIPostC increased the protein level of
glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and decreased the protein level of phosphorylated-EIF2α, caspase-12, and CHOP.
Furthermore, the expression of CHOP, Bim and cleavedcaspase-3 was decreased, while Bcl-2 expression was increased in response to application of RIPostC, CHOPi, or
RIPostC + CHOPi. In sum, RIPostC protects against
ischemia-reperfusion brain injury in rats by attenuating ER
stress response-induced apoptosis.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death as well as a
condition responsible for most of adult long-lasting disability.
Despite a large number of animal experiments and clinical
studies, there is no effective therapy available in protecting
against stroke in human. Ischemic postconditioning (IPostC)
is an intrinsic protective phenomenon afforded by brief episodes of ischemia-reperfusion applied after the ischemic insult
[1]. Some studies showed that IPostC can limit the damage
induced by ischemia and reperfusion [2–7]. Remote ischemic
postconditioning (RIPostC) is a special type of IPostC that
applies mild intermittent short ischemic episodes to an organ
remote from the main ischemic target [8]. On account of
simplicity and low-risk for its application in clinical practice,
RIPostC may open new perspectives for stroke treatment [1].
However, the potential of RIPostC to protect against ischemic
stroke and underlying mechanisms remain elusive.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays essential roles in
folding of secreted and membrane proteins. When ER
function is impaired, a pathological state known as ER
stress occurs [9–11]. ER stress causes accumulation of
unfolded proteins in the ER, a phenomenon termed the
unfolded protein response (UPR) [9–11]. Once UPR is
protracted or excessive, apoptosis is induced [9–11]. ER
stress-mediated apoptosis is one of deleterious biochemical events triggered by cerebral ischemia [12, 13] which
ultimately lead to the death of brain cells [14]. The chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is known to
help stabilize protein-folding intermediates and as the
main regulator of the major sensors including protein
kinase RNA (PRKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase
(PERK), inositol-requiring kinase 1 (IRE1α), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) in ER stress signaling
[12]. These sensors all converge on the promoter of the
gene encoding CCAAT/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)
[12, 15]. As a transcription factor, CHOP regulates expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 and the apoptotic gene Bim [16, 17]. In addition, some proteins such as
eukaryotic phosphorylation of translation initiation factor
2α (eIF2α) and caspase-12 are involved in ER stressinduced apoptosis [15, 18]. When misfolded ER proteins
accumulate, PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, inhibiting
translation of messenger RNA into protein [19, 20]. It
has been reported that IPostC protects against cerebral
ischemia injury by attenuating ER stress-induced apoptosis [7]. It is likely that RIPostC may share protective
mechanisms in common with IPostC to reduce cerebral
ischemic injury.
The aims of the present study were as follows: (1) to
determine the effects of RIPostC on cerebral ischemic injury
and implication of ER stress response in the neuroprotection
of RIPostC and (2) to compare the effectiveness of RIPostC
and CHOP interference as a treatment used separately or in
combination. Our results demonstrated that RIPostC protected
against focal cerebral ischemia by attenuating ER stressdependent apoptotic signaling, suggesting it as a potential
option for therapy of ischemic stroke.

Materials and Methods
Animal Model
All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Capital Medical
University and in accordance with the principles outlined
in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals. Male SD rats weighing 280–310 g were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h
followed by reperfusion as previously described [21]. The

693

rats were randomly assigned into seven groups: shamoperated group, MCAO group, MCAO + RIPostC group,
MCAO + Coni group, MCAO + RIPostC + Coni group,
MCAO + CHOPi group, and MCAO + RIPostC + CHOPi
group. In MCAO + RIPostC group, MCAO + RIPostC +
Coni group, and MCAO + RIPostC + CHOPi group,
RIPostC was applied by three cycles of 10 min occlusion
and 10 min reperfusion of bilateral femoral arteries immediately after ischemia. In MCAO + Coni group,
MCAO + RIPostC + Coni group, MCAO + CHOPi
group, and MCAO + RIPostC + CHOPi group, CHOP
siRNA (CHOPi) or control siRNA (Coni) were, respectively, injected into the right ventricle at 30 min before the
beginning of ischemia. To ensure the occurrence of ischemia and reperfusion in MCAO animals, regional cerebral
blood flow was monitored using laser Doppler flowmetry
(LDF, PeriFlux System 5000, Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden) in the following coordinates: 0.5 mm anterior and
5.0 mm lateral from the bregma. Rectal temperature was
controlled at 37.0 °C during and after surgery with a
temperature-regulated heating pad. Mean artery blood
pressure (MABP) was monitored through an apparatus
(MP100A-CE, BIOPAC Systems, Inc., CA, USA).
Intracerebroventricular Injection
SiRNA was purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA,
USA), and the concentration of which was 10 μM. The
coordinates from bregma and pial surface, respectively,
for the tip of the injection needle were AP=−0.8 mm,
ML=+1.4 mm, and DV=−3.7 mm. The siRNA mixture
(8 μl CHOP siRNA or control siRNA, and 2 μl Lipofectamine 2000) was stereotaxically delivered into the ipsilateral ventricle over 10 min. The bone wound was closed
afterward with bone wax.
Neurological Function Assessment
Neurological functional deficits were scored at 24 h after
reperfusion in a blind fashion. Two tests were used to evaluate
neurological function according to the studies reported previously: the postural reflex test to examine upper body posture
while the animal is suspended by the tail [22], and the forelimb
placing test to examine sensorimotor integration in forelimb
placing responses to visual, tactile, and proprioceptive stimuli
[23]. Neurological functions were graded on a scale from 0 to
12 (normal score, 0; maximal score, 12).
Determination of Infarct Volume
The animals were euthanized at 24 h after reperfusion and
were transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline to
eliminate intravascular blood. The brains were quickly

removed and sectioned into six consecutive coronal slices of
2-mm thickness. The slices were stained by immersing into
2 % of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min at 37 °C and then fixed with 4 %
formalin. The border between infarcted and noninfarcted tissue was outlined with Image-Pro Plus Analysis Software
(Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA), and the area
of infarction was measured by subtracting the area of the
nonlesioned ipsilateral hemisphere from that of the contralateral hemisphere. The volume of infarction was calculated by
integration of the lesion areas [24].
Terminal Transferase-Mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling
(TUNEL) Staining
TUNEL staining was performed using an in situ cell death
detection kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Roche Applied Science, South San Francisco, CA, USA).
The paraffin-embedded coronal sections were de-paraffinized
and rehydrated, and then treated with proteinase K (10 μg/ml)
for 30 min at room temperature. After washing three times in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), sections were incubated
with reaction buffer containing enzyme at 37 °C for 30 min

in the dark. The nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI). Sections were observed under the fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). The positive cells and total
cells were counted on three fields at ×200 magnifications by a
blinded technician. The result was presented as a ratio of
positive cell number to the total cell number.
Western Blot Analysis
The cerebral tissues were sampled at 4, 24, and 72 h after
ischemia. The tissue lysates were prepared using a lysis
buffer containing HEPES (pH 7.9; 10 mM), KCL
(10 mM), EDTA (0.1 mM), EGTA (0.1 mM), dithiothreitol (1 mM), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mM),
protease inhibitor aprotinin (5 mg/ml), leupeptin
(5 mg/ml), and phosphokinase inhibitor (10 mg/ml). The
tissues were homogenized and centrifuged at 13,500g for
30 min at 4 °C, and then the supernatant was collected.
Protein concentration was determined by a BCA protein
assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) using bovine serum
albumin as the standard. Protein samples were separated
on SDS polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to
polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica,

at room temperature, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following antibodies: rabbit antiGRP78 polyclonal antibody (1:1,000, Abcam, Hong
Kong, China), rabbit anti-p-eIF2α polyclonal antibody
(1:1,000, Abcam), rabbit anti-CHOP polyclonal antibody

antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz), and rabbit anti-actin polyclonal antibody (1:2,000, Santa Cruz). Membranes were
then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (1:2,000, Santa Cruz) in blocking solution for
1 h. The blots were visualized by chemiluminescence
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Protein levels were

normalized to β-actin, which was used as a loading control. Relative optical density of protein bands was measured after subtracting the film background.
Immunofluorescence Staining
Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded cerebral sections
(4 μm) were de-paraffinized in dimethyl benzene and
rehydrated through graded alcohols. Endogenous peroxidase
activity was blocked with 3 % hydrogen peroxide for 10 min.
Sections were incubated in sodium citrate buffer (0.01 M,
pH 6.0) for 15 min in a microwave oven. After cooling to
room temperature, slides were washed in PBS and immersed
in normal horse blocking serum (Maxin, Fuzhou, China) for
30 min. For double staining, slides were incubated with rabbit
polyclonal anti-GRP78 antibody (1:100; Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti-p-eIF2α antibody (1:100; Abcam), rabbit

with TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody
(1:200; Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories Inc., West
Grove, PA, USA) and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200; Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories Inc.) and incubated for 30 min. The nuclei of cells were
stained by DAPI. Sections were observed under the fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
Statistical Analysis
All data were expressed as mean±standard deviations using
SPSS 11.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The significance of
difference between means was assessed by Student’s t test
(single comparisons) or by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) and post hoc Scheffe’s tests with P<0.05 being
considered as statistically significant.

Results
RIPostC Reduces Infarct Volume and Cell Apoptosis
and Improves Neurological Functional Outcome After
MCAO
Rectal temperature and MABP were monitored for all groups.
The results showed no significant difference in all the variables among groups (data not shown). To confirm the neuroprotective effect of RIPostC on cerebral ischemia injury, infarct volume was measured by TTC staining in brain sections.
The results showed that RIPostC resulted in a reduction in
infarct size after 2 h ischemia and 24 h reperfusion, compared
with the MCAO group (P<0.05) (Fig. 1a, b). The behavioral
functional scores of the rats in different groups were determined at 24 h after MCAO, revealing a significant improvement in neurological function in rats receiving RIPostC
(P<0.05) (Fig. 1c, d). Likewise, TUNEL staining performed
24 h after MCAO demonstrated that IPostC significantly
ameliorated apoptosis compared with the MCAO group
(P<0.01, Fig. 1e).

RIPostC Prevents ER Stress Response After Cerebral
Ischemia

ER Stress Response Plays a Crucial Role
in RIPostC-Mediated Neuroprotection

To gain insight into the role of ER stress response in the
neuroprotection of RIPostC, the expression of GRP78, peIF2α, CHOP, and caspase-12 was investigated in different groups with Western blot and immunofluorescence
staining. Western blot showed that RIPostC manipulation
increased the protein level of GRP78 while decreased the
protein levels of p-EIF2α, CHOP, and caspase-12 in the
ischemic cortex after 2 h ischemia and 24 h reperfusion
(all P<0.05, Fig. 2a, b). Consistent with the Western blot
results, GRP78 expression was increased while p-EIF2α,
CHOP, and caspase-12 expressions were decreased by
RIPostC application in the neurons of ischemic cortex
upon immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 3).

To assess the role of CHOP in cerebral ischemia and RIPostCmediated neuroprotection, CHOP siRNA or control siRNA
was injected into the right ventricle of MCAO or MCAO +
RIPostC rats 30 min before the beginning of ischemia. The
outcome was evaluated 24 h after reperfusion showing that the
percentage of infarct volume was significantly decreased in
MCAO + RIPostC + Coni group (P<0.05), MCAO + CHOPi
group (P<0.05), and MCAO + RIPostC + CHOPi group
(P<0.01), respectively, compared with the MCAO + Coni
group (Fig. 4a, b). A similar pattern of results was observed
for neurological function scores (Fig. 4b) and apoptosis
(Fig. 4c). Of notice, for the three outcomes, the combination
of RIPostC and CHOPi revealed more effective than either

RIPostC or CHOPi alone, which was particularly significant
for apoptosis (P < 0.05 vs. MCAO + RIPostC + Coni;
P<0.001 vs. MCAO + CHOPi; Fig. 4c).
To further explore the role of ER stress response, especially
CHOP and its targets, in RIPostC-mediated neuroprotection,
brain tissues in different groups were harvested at 24 h after
reperfusion and submitted to Western blot. As shown in Fig. 5,
RIPostC, CHOPi, and the combination of the two leaded to a
downregulation of CHOP, Bim, and cleaved-caspase-3 and
upregulation of Bcl-2 in the ischemic cortex. Compared to the

control, RIPostC treatment resulted in a decrease in Bim
expression and an increase in Bcl-2 expression in the ischemic
cortex but not in the ischemic striatum (Fig. 5).

Discussion and Conclusions
We have previously reported the proper time window of
RIPostC and that IPostC reduced cerebral tissue apoptosis in
experimental stroke [21, 25]. In the present study, we further

Transl. Stroke Res. (2014) 5:692–700

investigated the protective effect of RIPostC on cerebral
ischemic injury and the involvement of ER stress response in the underlying mechanisms. We confirmed that
RIPostC induced a marked reduction in cerebral infarct
volume and apoptosis and improved neurological function
in rats subjected to cerebral ischemia and reperfusion.
RIPostC upregulated GRP78 expression and downregulated p-EIF2α, CHOP, and caspase-12, indicating that
RIPostC neuroprotections were exerted by attenuating
ER-stress-dependent apoptotic signaling, especially
CHOP. Our previous study showed that there was no
induced cell apoptosis in sham-operated group and the
group treated with IPostC alone [25]. Moreover, CHOP
was expressed with a low level in sham-operated group.
To save animals, we therefore did not include the CHOPi
without MCAO group as the control to detect the expression of CHOP and its targets. The involvement of ER
stress response in RIPostC neuroprotections was verified
by the fact that cerebral ischemic injury can be reduced by
inhibiting the expression of the transcription factor CHOP
through RNA inference and, importantly, RIPostC had a
similar protection as CHOPi against cerebral ischemia
injury. Moreover, the combination application of RIPostC
and CHOPi exhibited a more efficient effect on apoptosis
than that either of them alone did.
ER stress participates in ischemia-induced apoptosis
and plays an important role in cerebral ischemic injury
[12]. Recent studies suggested that GRP78 and caspase12 play a critical role in cerebral ischemia [26–29]. It
has been reported that overexpression of CHOP protein
induces apoptosis by inhibiting Bcl-2 [16], and deletion
of CHOP can alleviate the cerebral I/R injury [29].
Recent study revealed that CHOP siRNA treatment provided neuroprotection in subarachnoid hemorrhage [30].
In line with these results, we showed the beneficial role
of CHOP siRNA treatment in protecting rats from cerebral ischemic injury. More importantly, we showed a
synergetic effect of CHOP siRNA and RIPostC on
cerebral ischemic injury, which, along with the downregulation of CHOP by RIPostC, highly suggests the
involvement of ER stress response in the mechanism
for RIPostC action. It is worth noting that although
CHOPi and RIPostC have similar effects on stroke,
RIPostC is more feasible in clinical practice due to its
noninvasiveness. CHOP messenger RNA (mRNA) was
degraded rapidly with a half-life of approximately 2–3 h
[31]. Moreover, apoptosis may prolong the half-life of
CHOP mRNA [32]. Therefore, the long-lasting protection effect of CHOPi and/or RIPostC should be detected
in the future study.
The present study has some limitations. First, to assess the
role of ER stress response in neuroprotection of RIPostC, we
demonstrated that the expression of CHOP was

699

downregulated by RIPostC and that downregulation of CHOP
by RNA interference exhibited a similar effect as RIPostC. It
is likely that an additional study is needed using CHOP
overexpression, which is expected to counteract the RIPostC
action that may further verify the involvement of CHOP in the
mechanism for RIPostC. Second, because the major ER stress
sensors all converge on CHOP [15], we chose CHOP as the
target of RNA interference, while the role of major ER stress
sensors including PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 in RIPostC were
not explored in the present study. Further mechanistic studies
are warranted to carefully dissect the role of RIPostC against
stroke and neuronal death.
In conclusion, RIPostC attenuates cerebral ischemia
injury by inhibiting ER-stress-mediated apoptosis. The
combination of RIPostC and CHOPi seems to have a
synergetic neuroprotective effect on cerebral ischemic
injury. RIPostC may be applied as an effective treatment
strategy for stroke.
