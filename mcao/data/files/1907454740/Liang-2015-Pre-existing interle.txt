Abstract
Recurrent stroke is difficult to treat and life threatening.
Transfer of anti-inflammatory gene is a potential gene therapy strategy for ischemic stroke. Using recombinant adenoassociated viral vector 1 (rAAV1)-mediated interleukin 10 (IL10), we investigated whether transfer of beneficial gene into
the rat cerebral vessels during interventional treatment for
initial stroke could attenuate brain injury caused by recurrent
stroke. Male Wistar rats were administered rAAV1-IL-10,
rAAV1-YFP, or saline into the left cerebral artery. Three weeks
after gene transfer, rats were subjected to occlusion of the
left middle cerebral artery (MCAO) for 45 min followed by
reperfusion for 24 h. IL-10 levels in serum were significantly

elevated 3 weeks after rAAV1-IL-10 injection, and virus in the
cerebral vessels was confirmed by in situ hybridization. Preexisting IL-10 but not YFP decreased the neurological dysfunction scores, brain infarction volume, and the number of
injured neuronal cells. AAV1-IL-10 transduction increased
heme oxygenase (HO-1) mRNA and protein levels in the
infarct boundary zone of the brain. Thus, transduction of the
IL-10 gene in the cerebral artery prior to ischemia attenuates
brain injury caused by ischemia/reperfusion in rats. This preventive approach for recurrent stroke can be achieved during

Introduction
Recurrent stroke, the common event after the initial stroke, is
responsible for high morbidity and mortality (1). Endovascular
intervention treatment in patients with ischemic stroke results
in a higher rate of recanalization of the affected cerebral
artery (2). The anti-inflammatory gene has been identified as a
potential therapeutic target for ischemic stroke gene therapy.
However, the combined treatment of these strategies has
never been applied before. We hypothesize that endovascular
intervention treatment for initial stroke together with gene
therapy may optimize the prevention of recurrent ischemic
stroke.
Brain ischemia evokes an inflammatory cascade (3). Interleukin (IL)-10 has been identified as an anti-inflammatory
molecule that can suppress the production of a variety of proinflammatory molecules, including tumor necrosis factor-a
(TNF-a), IL-1b, and IL-8 (4,5). Nomoto et al. found that
AAV vector-mediated systemic IL-10 expression prevented vascular remodeling and inflammatory lesions (6). Systemic
administration of IL-10 protected tissues exposed to a variety

IUBMB Life

of ischemia-reperfusion regimens (7,8). The therapeutic effect
of IL-10 on stroke has been confirmed. It is upregulated in
both hemispheres after experimental ischemic stroke and may
contribute to better outcomes (9). IL-10 deficiency exacerbates
the brain inflammatory response to permanent ischemia (10).
IL-10 transgenic mice are more resistant to focal brain ischemia in mice. Either intracerebral or systemic post-ischemic
administration decreases brain injury caused by ischemia
(11–14). Thus, IL-10 is a desirable gene candidate for demonstrating the feasibility that gene transfer during interventional
treatment for initial stroke could attenuate brain injury caused
by recurrent stroke. Systemic IL-10 has cytoprotective effects
but is also associated with significant side effects, such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and immunosuppression. Thus, longterm systemic administration of IL-10 is not a suitable therapeutic strategy as it may predispose to recurrent stroke. Local
and systemic IL-10 treatment is virtually equipotent, but local
treatment may ameliorate those side effects (15,16). Von Der
€ sen et al. introduced IL-10 into atherosclerosis-prone
Thu
arterial sites and confirmed that this was an effective antiatherosclerosis therapy. Local IL-10 administration significantly ameliorates the side-effects associated with systemic
IL-10 therapy (16).
Intraventricular, intrathecal, stereotaxic, and arterial injection are attractive approaches for gene delivery. Intraventricular and intrathecal routes of administration appear effective for
the wide-spread distribution of gene therapy vectors within the
central nervous system (CNS) (17). Stereotaxic surgery has been
used extensively for the creation of site-targeted lesions, as it
allows the manipulation of gene expression in the brain with
excellent spatiotemporal control (18). The approach by which
IL-10 is delivered to vascular lesions by arterial injection has
several advantages when compared with other methods. First,
direct IL-10 gene transfer into susceptible arteries is rapid and
highly efficient. Second, IL-10 gene delivery can be performed
concomitantly with endovascular intervention surgery, which
avoids the induction of new trauma since a second intervention
is not required. The feasibility of direct transfer of IL-10 to
stroke-prone arterial sites has thus far not been demonstrated.
However, it is likely to be associated with increased local production of IL-10 in advance. The presence of IL-10 locally in
cerebral arteries may also effectively protect the subsequent
injury induced by cerebral artery occlusion.
Recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors mediate the safe and long-term gene expression following a single
administration (19). They have been successfully transduced in
various regions of the brain with no detected toxicity and low
immune reaction. rAAV1-mediated gene transfer was efficient
in neurons and glial cells (20). In this study, rAAV1 was used
to deliver IL-10 to the cerebral vessels through the internal
carotid artery (ICA) and to achieve efficient IL-10 production
over long periods.
Since we used ischemia/reperfusion instead of permanent
ischemia model of stroke, intracellular protective mechanism
may be important because soluble cytokines may be flushed

Liang et al.

out of stroke lesion by the re-established brain circulation.
Previously, we showed that heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mediated memorial and revivable protective effect of ischemic preconditioning on brain injury (21). HO-1 is an inducible enzyme
that degrades the heme molecule into antioxidants, including
biliverdin, carbon monoxide (CO), and iron. Its expression and
activity can be increased by various preconditioning stimuli in
the brain and whole body (22). There is compelling evidence
that HO-1 is associated with protection against brain ischemia
injury (22–24). However, whether HO-1 is involved in the protective effect by pre-existing IL-10 is unknown. Thus, in the
present study, we investigated whether rAAV1-mediated IL-10
gene transfer into the cerebral arteries 3 weeks prior to brain
ischemia could decrease subsequent ischemia/reperfusion
brain damage and determined whether HO-1 is involved in
such a protection by IL-10.

Experimental Procedures
Animals
Thirty-six male Wistar rats weighing 250–300 g were randomly divided into three groups, namely rAAV1-IL-10, rAAV1YFP, and saline group. Investigators were blind to the allocation. All experimental protocols in this study were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai
Medical College, Fudan University, and performed in accordance with the NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals.

Adeno-associated Viral Vector Delivery
Viral construction was performed as previously described
(25,26). The rats were anesthetized with 10% hydrated chlorine aldehyde. The surgical procedure was performed similar
as previously described (27,28). Briefly, the left common
carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA), and internal carotid artery (ICA) were surgically exposed. A curved
microvascular clip was placed across the CCA, and an arteriotomy was performed in the ECA. A PE-08 catheter filled with
infused solutions was introduced into the ECA lumen and then
inserted into the left ICA (15.0 mm from the origin of the ECA).
For each rat, 100 lL of diluted rAAV1-IL-10 or rAAV1-YFP
containing 1 3 1010 particles was introduced into the isolated
carotid segment through a catheter placed in the ICA. The
control groups received an equal volume of saline. After 10
min of incubation, the catheter was then withdrawn. The left
external carotid was ligated at 8 mm from the CCA and blood
flow through the common and internal carotid arteries was reestablished. Rats were allowed to recover from anesthesia and
were returned to their cages.

Transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Three weeks after gene transfer, the rats were anesthetized
with 10% hydrated chlorine aldehyde. Middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) was performed as described previously (21).
Briefly, a new small incision at about 5 mm from the CCA was
made in the left ECA. A nylon filament (diameter, 0.36 mm)

711

IUBMB LIFE

was inserted into the left ICA through the new opening in the
left ECA and advanced further to occlude the left middle cerebral artery (LMCA) for 45 min. The nylon filament was then
removed, and the left ECA was tied. Twenty-four hours after
the blood flow of the left ICA was restored, neurological functions in each rat were detected and the animals were sacrificed for examination.

Analysis of Neurological Function
The rats were assessed for neurological dysfunction by using a
modified Bederson score (29) in a double-blinded manner with
the following definitions:
Score 0: no detectable neurological deficits
Score 1: failure to extend the right forepaw fully
Score 2: circling to the left
Score 3: falling to the left
Score 4: did not walk spontaneously and had a depressed
level of consciousness
Score 5: death before scheduled termination

Rats Sacrificed and Tissue Collection
Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, the rats were deeply
anesthetized with isoflurane (5% in O2) and the brain was perfused with heparinized saline (10 U/mL) in situ for 90 sec.
Each brain was sliced into 2-mm-thick coronal sections by
using a brain matrix (BSR 001.1; Zivic-Miller, Pittsburgh, PA).
Brain sections (except the third coronal section, located at 4–
6 mm from the frontal region) were used for histology analysis. The infarct boundary zone of brain tissue was removed
from the excised third coronal brain section by making a careful incision 1 mm from the edge of the infarct marginal line.
This tissue was used for PCR and Western blot analysis. The
left ICA and middle cerebral artery were separated and collected. Brain and artery samples were flash-frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at 280 8C.

Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay
Blood samples were collected by femoral vein puncture at day
0 and 3 weeks after viral vector infusion. Rat IL-10 in the
serum was measured by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To measure
the TNF-a level, blood samples and brain tissue in the infarct
boundary zone were collected 24 h after ischemia/reperfusion.
Rat TNF-a was measured by ELISA (Yaanda, Beijing, China)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

In Situ Hybridization
To detect viral vector expression in the cerebral vessel, three
oligonucleotide probes labeled with digoxin (DIG) were synthesized as follows: Probe 1: 50 -GCGCAGGGACTTCCTTTGTCCCA
AATCTGTGCGGA-30 . Probe 2: 50 -CTCTAGAGCCTCTGCTAACC
ATGTTCATGCCTTCT-30 . Probe 3: 50 -GTGAAATTTGTGATG
CTATTGCTTTATTTGTAACC-30 . Six-micron-thick coronal paraffin sections were treated with 3% H2O2 for 10 min and then
digested with pepsin (10 mg/L) at 37 8C for 20 min, followed by
hybridization with DIG-labeled probes overnight at 42 8C. The

712

sections were subsequently incubated with an anti-DIG antibody, then reacted with the ABC streptavidin detection system,
and counterstained slightly with hematoxylin before dehydration and mounting.

Evaluation of Cerebral Infarction
Brain sections (except the third section, located at 4–6 mm)
were stained with 0.5% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) (Sigma Chemical Co. St. Louis, MO) for 20 min at 37 8C,
followed by fixation in 4% formaldehyde at 4 8C for 24 h. The
relative infarct area (% of total left hemisphere) was measured
using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Bethesda,
MD) in a double-blinded manner.

Hematoxylin and Eosin Stain
After evaluation of the infarct size, the previously fixed brain
sections were embedded in paraffin. Serial 6-lm-thick coronal
sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Red neuron
and ghost neuron were counted in each of six random nonoverlapping microscopic fields of the ipsilateral hemisphere
using an Olympus light microscope.

Immunohistochemistry
The brain sections were incubated in 3% H2O2 for 10 min to
block endogenous peroxidase activity, which was followed by
three washes in 0.01 M phosphate buffer saline (PBS) . The sections were then blocked with 10% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA) followed by incubation overnight with
the rabbit anti-HO-1 (1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) primary
antibody at 4 8C; subsequently, they were washed and incubated
with horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled donkey anti-rabbit
IgG (1:1,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA) secondary antibodies for 30 min at 37 8C. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used for
visualization of the sections. The slides were counterstained with
hematoxylin before dehydration and mounting. To analyze
immunoreactive signal, photos were performed from individual
six random non-overlapping positive fields in each brain section
with an Olympus microscope. Area and intensity of positive signals were measured using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 and the investigator was blinded to the experimental groups.

Reverse transcription-PCR and Real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from brain tissues in infarct boundary
zones or cerebral vessels by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript
Reverse Transcriptase (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Toyobo, Japan). All samples were analyzed using a
Bio-Rad real-time analyzer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA) and were normalized to b-actin expression.

Western Blot Analysis
Brain tissues in infarct boundary zones were homogenized in
a buffer containing 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.1 M
Tris-Cl, 20% glycerin, and 0.01 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), pH 7.4. After quantification, protein samples
were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and Western

Statistics
Data are presented as mean 6 SEM. Statistical analysis was
performed using ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni test,
except in the case of the neurobiological dysfunction score,
which was analyzed by the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test.
In all cases, a probability value (P-value) less than 0.05 was
considered significant.

Results
rAAV1-mediated IL-10 Gene Transduction and
Expression
The animal experimental protocol is shown in Fig. 1A. To determine whether rAAV1 injection leads to successful gene transduction and expression, we first examined the extent of viral vector
expression after rAAV1 infection by in situ hybridization. As
shown in Fig. 1B, rAAV1 expression was observed in the region
of cerebral vessels 3 weeks after MCAO. In contrast, rAAV1 signal was absent in the saline group. The mRNA expression of IL10 in the cerebral vessel tissue further confirmed the presence
of IL-10 in the rAAV1-IL-10 treated group (Fig. 1C). Moreover,
IL-10 levels in the serum of the IL-10 treated group were significantly elevated 3 weeks after virus injection compared with the
rAAV1-YFP or saline group (Fig. 1D).

Pre-existing IL-10 Gene Reduced Brain Injury Caused
by Ischemia/Reperfusion
In order to investigate whether IL-10 overexpression would
reduced brain injury, neurological score and histological analysis were performed subsequently. Compared with the rAAV1YFP or saline group, those with rAAV1-IL-10 transduction
showed dramatically improved motor performance as assessed
by the neurological deficit scores (Fig. 2, P < 0.05). Furthermore, rAAV1-IL-10 treatment significantly reduced the infarct
volume (Figs. 3A and 3B, P < 0.05). The histopathology of brain
damage was detected by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The
damaged cells, including red neurons and ghost neurons, were
counted in each of six random non-overlapping microscopic
fields. Six slices were selected randomly from each rat and the
percentage of damaged cells was scored. Compared with
rAAV1-YFP or saline treatment, IL-10 decreased the percentage of red and ghost neurons (Figs. 3C–3F, P < 0.05).

IL-10 Transduction Decreased Pro-inflammatory
Mediator TNF-a
To determine whether transfer of IL-10 inhibits the proinflammatory molecules induced by ischemia injury, many
inflammatory mediators in infarct boundary zone were measured by reverse transcription real time PCR. IL-10 transduction significantly reduced pro-inflammatory mediator TNF-a
expression in the infarct boundary zone of the brain. However,
IL-10, IL-1b, monocyte chemotactic protein-1(MCP-1), monocyte inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1a), transforming
growth factor- beta (TGF-b), interferon gamma-induced protein-10 (IP-10), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and

IL-10 gene transduction decreased neurological dysfunction caused by brain injury. Neurologic deficit
scores were determined 24 h after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Compared to treatment with saline or
rAAV-YFP, rAAV-IL-10 administration dramatically
decreased the neurologic deficit scores. Nonparametric analysis (Kruskal–Wallis test) was used to determine significant differences between groups. (n 5 12;
*P < 0.05 vs. rAAV-YFP or saline).

intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1) did not change
significantly (Fig. 4A). As TNF-a mRNA was inhibited by IL-10,
we further measured protein levels of TNF-a in serum and in
the brain infarct boundary zone by ELISA. Compared with
rAAV1-YFP or saline treatment, IL-10 gene transduction significantly decreased serum TNF-a but did not change levels of
this cytokine in the infarct boundary zone (Figs. 4B and 4C).

IL-10 Transduction Increased Intracellular Protective
Protein HO-1
As HO-1 has been reported to play a protective role in brain
ischemia injury (22–24), we examined whether the preexisting IL-10 regulated the expression of HO-1. Compared
with rAAV1-YFP or saline treatment, IL-10 gene transduction
significantly increased HO-1 mRNA and protein levels in the
infarct boundary zone shown by real time PCR (Fig. 5A) and
Western blot analysis (Figs. 5B and 5C, P < 0.05). Furthermore,
immunohistochemical staining with HO-1 antibody revealed
that HO-1 expression was located predominantly in the boundary zone of the infarct area (Fig. 5D).The calculated HO-1 positive area and staining intensity of the rAAV1-IL-10 group was
significantly increased compared to that of the rAAV1-YFP or
saline group (Figs. 5E and 5F, P < 0.05). In addition, IL-10
induced HO-1 protein expression in primary neurons (Supporting Information Fig. 1).

that gene transfer of rAAV1-IL-10 into the cerebral arteries
prior to brain ischemia attenuated brain injury caused by
ischemia/reperfusion and enhanced HO-1 expression.
Many patients with thrombosis in cerebral vessels need
endovascular interventional surgery, such as stent and device
placement. Endovascular interventional therapy is a quick and
effective procedure for recanalization; it is useful for the

Liang et al.

prevention of initial and recurrent stroke (2,30,31). A combined approach consisting of pharmacologic thrombolysis,
manual aspiration devices, and stenting may produce the best
results for stroke therapy (32). Endovascular interventional
surgeries provide a favorable opportunity for the intra-arterial
administration of drugs, cells, and gene vectors. Thus, we suggest that endovascular intervention treatment combined with

IL-10 reduced TNF-a expression but other cytokines did not change significantly. The infarct boundary zone of brain was
removed by making a careful incision 1 mm from the edge of the infarct marginal line, and was used to detect cytokine expression. A: Reverse transcription real time PCR was used to determine the expression of inflammatory mediators, including TNF-a,
IL-10, IL-1b, TGF-b, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1a, VEGF, and ICAM-1. The level of TNF-a mRNA was significantly decreased by rAAV-IL10. TNF-a in serum (B) and in the infarct boundary zone (C) was detected by ELISA. The infarct boundary zone brain tissue and
serum samples were collected 24 h after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Compared with saline or rAAV-YFP, rAAV-IL-10 administration dramatically decreased serum TNF-a level. TNF-a proteins in the infarct boundary zone were not significantly different
among the three groups. All values are means 6 SEM and analyzed by ANOVA tests. (n 5 6; *P < 0.05 vs. rAAV-YFP or saline).

gene therapy may be an efficient approach to provide longterm protection following periods of cerebral ischemia.
Pre-existing gene transduction is an attractive therapy of
cerebrovascular disease because post-ischemic delivering of
protective cytokine into stroke lesion is not always possible.
The patient may arrive too late or the lesion has limited blood
flow. rAAV is a promising tool for maintaining long-term
expression of a transgene because of its ability to transduce
both dividing and non-dividing cells and elicit a limited
immune response (19). Thus, these properties make rAAV an
attractive strategy for gene delivery in the brain. Previous
studies confirmed that intracerebroventricular or intracerebral
rAAV gene transfer of cytoprotective proteins, including bone
morphogenetic protein 7 (33), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (34), heat shock protein 72 (35), insulin-like growth factor
(36), vascular endothelial growth factor (37,38), and
interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (39), may protect against
rodent brain ischemia. While the vectors are safe, the delivery
approaches are traumatic. On the other hand, considering the
size of human brain and the limited diffuse distance of viral
vectors, the effect of intracerebroventricular or intracerebral

Liang et al.

gene transduction in human may not be as effective as in
rodent. In the present study, we demonstrated the rAAV1
transduction efficacy via cerebral artery. The expression of
transduced IL-10 in the brain vessel was confirmed by in situ
hybridization, and IL-10 level in serum was significantly
elevated 3 weeks after virus injection. IL-10, an antiinflammatory cytokine, suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines to protect damaged brain tissue after
ischemic stroke (10–12). Several studies reported that IL-10
gene overexpression was effective in reducing infarction or
attenuating neuronal damage in brain ischemia (11,13,14,40).
In those studies, genes were transferred into the lateral ventricle by stereotaxic injection or systemically into vena caudalis
or muscle. In addition to the limited concentration of IL-10 in
brain tissue, these modalities have often been associated with
adverse host immune responses through systematic administration and expected mechanical damage. Selective transduction of therapeutic genes in susceptible arteries during interventional treatment may increase the local expression of
therapeutic genes and avoid systemic side effects. The middle
cerebral artery is the susceptible artery most often occluded in

717

IUBMB LIFE

stroke. In this study, rAVV1 encoding rat IL-10 was infused
directly into the middle cerebral artery, and 3 weeks later,
high levels of IL-10 were detected in brain cerebral vessels.
This result suggests that gene transfer by cerebral artery
administration was effective. The neurological deficit score
and infarct volume results showed that the overexpression of
IL-10 in cerebral arteries might decrease subsequent brain
injury caused by ischemia/reperfusion. Our results indicated
that forced transduction of the IL-10 gene in susceptible
arteries during endovascular interventional treatment for initial stroke is an efficient strategy for reducing injury caused by
recurrent stroke.
Inflammatory/immune cytokines are important in stroke.
By performing cerebral gene expression microarrays 24 h or
three days after permanent brain ischemia and intracerebral
IL-10 injection, Liesz et al. found that IL-10 mainly downregulates inflammatory genes in the acute phase after stroke and
that the majority of the genes downregulated by IL-10 were
directly associated with immune responses or had roles in
immune-pathways, cell cycle, or cell–cell adhesion (11). Thus,
we examined the functional roles of common inflammatory/
immune cytokines in the effect of pre-existing IL-10 on brain
injury. Among the multiple cytokines, TNF-a was decreased by
AAV1-IL-10 transduction, which was consistent with previous
studies (4,7,41), the accordance results demonstrated that
IL-10 could attenuate ischemia/reperfusion injury by inhibiting
TNF-a. These findings also show that IL-10 protects against
ischemia/reperfusion injury by suppressing the pro-inflammatory
molecules. In this study, the expression of other inflammatory
mediators including IL-10, IL-1b, MCP-1, MIP-1a, TGF-b,
IP-10, VEGF, and ICAM-1 were determined as well. However,
there was no significant difference between the IL-10 group
and the YFP or saline group, which was inconsistent with the
result by Liesz et al. (11). Using microarray, they found that
post-ischemic intracerebroventricular IL-10 treatment effectively downregulated pro-inflammatory signaling cascades,
including parts of what we measured, which were upregulated
by the ischemic lesion in the acute phase after the stroke. To
explain this inconsistency, two reasons were pointed out as follows. First, IL-10 gene was transduced 3 weeks before stroke
instead of delivering IL-10 after stroke. The pre-existing IL-10
may prevent the infiltration of cytokine-producing inflammatory cells. Second, ischemia/reperfusion model was used
instead of electrocauterized permanent ischemic model of
stroke. The re-established blood circulation as well as lacking
of electrical and heat injury in our model may contribute to
the difference.
HO-1 was shown to have anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic,
and pro-angiogenic properties (42–44). It exerts an antiinflammatory action and is important in regulating inflammation (43,45–47). Our previous study showed that HO-1 mediated the protective effect of ischemic preconditioning on brain
ischemia injury (21) and the protective effect of IL-10 on
immune rejection of vascular allograft (26). In this study, we
found that HO-1 mRNA and protein levels in the infarct

718

boundary zone of the brain were significantly increased with
IL-10 treatment. Thus, intracellular protective molecule HO-1
may contribute to the protective effect of pre-existing IL-10 on
brain ischemia injury. Since IL-10 inhibited chronic vascular
inflammation including atherosclerosis and vascular neointimal proliferation (26), whether vascular inflammation contributes to the protective effect of pre-existing IL-10 on stroke
needs to be further investigated.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that transduction of
the IL-10 gene in the cerebral arteries 3 weeks prior to ischemia attenuates brain injury caused by ischemia/reperfusion in
rats. Selective transduction of therapeutic gene in susceptible
cerebral artery during endovascular interventional treatment
of initial strokes may be a desirable strategy to prevent recurrent stroke.
