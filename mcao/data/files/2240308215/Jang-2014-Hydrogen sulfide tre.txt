Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a potent vasodilator and regulates cardiovascular homeostasis. Furthermore, H2S has
a crucial role in ischemia2reperfusion injuries, especially
of the heart, liver, and kidneys. This study indicates that
treatment with hydrogen sulfide is able to restore neurological function after ischemic stroke by promoting angiogenesis. Treatment with H2S augments angiogenesis in
the peri-infarct area, and it significantly improves functional outcomes after 2 weeks in a rat MCAO model. H2S
promotes the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK and
increases the expression of vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1). H2S-treated
rats showed more newly synthesized endothelial cells in
the ischemic lesion (2.31-fold, P < 0.01). H2S-treated
astrocytes increased VEGF and Ang-1 expression, and
the inhibition of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/
AKT signaling by LY294002 significantly reduced H2Sinduced VEGF and Ang-1 expression in astrocytes.
Finally, H2S stimulated endothelial cell migration (3.92fold increase in wound healing assay) and tube formation
(3.69-fold increase, P < 0.001) through PI3K/AKT signaling. In conclusion, treatment with H2S promotes angiogenesis and thereby contributes to improvement of
functional outcome after cerebral ischemia. Our findings
strongly suggest that H2S may be of value in regenerative
recovery after stroke. VC 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous signaling molecule that is endogenously produced from cysteine metabolism, and its biological roles are variable and rapidly
expanding. These regulatory functions include the cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems. The vascular regulatory roles of H2S have been extensively studied,
including vasodilation, vascular protection, and regulation
of blood pressure. Stroke is the second most common
cause of death in the world, and it brings about severe,
long-term disability. Ischemic stroke causes neuronal
death and brain injury, and it then concomitantly entails

regenerative processes, such as angiogenesis and vascular
remodeling, in the area adjacent to the ischemic core. Cerebral angiogenesis is critical for cerebrovascular changes after
brain injury, and it is usually associated with astrocyte and
blood vessels. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has
a crucial role in angiogenesis because it regulates endothelial
growth and differentiation (Marti and Risau, 1999)/VEGF
cooperates with angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and establishes
dynamic blood vessel structure (Saito et al., 2003). Therefore,
the expression of VEGF and Ang-1 may result in angiogenesis and promote better functional outcomes after stroke.
The effects of H2S on cerebral ischemic stroke are
controversial. The inhibition of H2S synthesis reduced
the infarct volume in a cerebral ischemic model (Qu
et al., 2006). However, recent data suggest that H2S is
produced by ischemic stress to protect myocardial injury
(Ren et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011). In an in vivo model of
myocardial ischemia2reperfusion (I/R) injury, the
administration of H2S at the time of reperfusion decreased
the infarct size and preserved left ventricular function,
implying that H2S has a therapeutic role in cardiovascular
disease (Elrod et al., 2007; Calvert et al., 2009; Szabo
et al., 2011). We therefore investigated the therapeutic
possibilities of H2S for cerebral ischemic stroke. Specifically, we describe a role for H2S in angiogenesis. Here we
show that the administration of H2S increases VEGF and
angiogenic factors and subsequently promotes angiogenesis. Our findings support the therapeutic application of
H2S in cerebral ischemia.

Hydrogen Sulfide and Cerebral Ischemia
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and a Transient Focal Cerebral I/R Injury
Model
A transient focal cerebral I/R injury model was induced
bu using the endovascular internal carotid artery suture method
of Longa et al., with minor modifications, as previously
described (Lee et al., 2001). The middle cerebral artery of
Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing 2502300 g (Koatech,
Seoul, Korea) was reperfused 120 min after occlusion. All of
the animal experiments were approved by the IACUC of Seoul
National University Hospital. H2S was administered in the
form of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) diluted in saline. Either normal saline or NaHS (5 mg/kg)
in a final volume of 1 ml was injected via the intraperitoneal
route, with a 32-gauge needle, from day 3 after reperfusion to
day 14.
Behavioral Testing
Neurological evaluation was performed with the forelimb
placing and corner tests before middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) and at 1, 7, and 14 days after MCAO by researchers
who were blinded to the experimental groups (n 5 10). The
forelimb placing test was scored via vibrissae-elicited forelimb
placing (Bland et al., 2000). Independent testing of each forelimb was induced by brushing the vibrissae ipsilateral to that
forelimb on the edge of a tabletop once per trial for 10 trials.
Intact animals placed the forelimb quickly onto the countertop.
The percentage of successful placing responses was determined.
The corner test was performed as previously described (Zhang
et al., 2002), with slight modifications. Briefly, the rat was
allowed to proceed into a corner, the angle of which was 30 .
To exit the corner, the rat could turn to either the left or right,
and this choice was recorded. This process was repeated 10
times, with at least 30 sec between trials, and the percentage of
right turns was calculated. Only turns involving full rearing
along either wall were included. Rats were not picked up
immediately after each turn, so that they did not develop an
aversion for their prepotent turning response.
Infarction Volume
After a cardiac perfusion2fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, brains were cut into 40-lm-thick coronal sections on a
freezing microtome (CM 3050S, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). In
total seven brain sections were processed for Nissl staining. The
infarction volume was measured with an image analyzer. The
percentage of infarction was then determined by comparing the
infarction volume and the total volume of the contralateral
hemisphere.
Western Blot Analysis and Immunofluorescent Staining
Rat brain tissues were extracted at day 7 after I/R injuries
(n 5 5 per group), and astrocytes and bEnd.3 cells were harvested
under the indicated conditions for Western blot analysis, immunofluorescent staining, and TUNEL assay. For Western blot analysis,
equal amounts of each protein sample were subjected to analysis
with specific antibodies against extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), AKT (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-ERK, phospho-AKT (Cell SignalJournal of Neuroscience Research

ing Technology, Danvers, MA), phosphoendothelial nitric oxide
synthase (p-eNOS), eNOS (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom), phosphohypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF1a), VEGF, Ang1, Ang-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and b-actin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Immunofluorescent staining of brain tissue was performed with cryopreserved 40-lm coronal sections. The sections were blocked,
and probed with indicated antibodies against VEGF, Ang-1 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU; Boehringer
Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN), CD-31 (cluster of differentiation 31;
Abcam), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; Chemicon, Temecula, CA), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2; Cell Signaling
Technology), and neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN; Merck
Millipore, Billerica, MA). After washing, the sections were stained
with the fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min or
with the peroxidase substrate diaminobenzidine (DAB; Dako, Carpinteria, CA) for 5 min. For double immunofluorescence staining,
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated streptavidin secondary antibodies (Chemicon) and Alexa 488-conjugated goat antimouse secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were
used. Cell nuclei were visualized with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. A confocal laser scanning biological microscope (LSM 410 Meta; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) was used to
count the double-positive cells. Six predefined sections through the
peri-infarction area were used for cell quantification.
TUNEL Assay
Paraffin-embedded sections were dewaxed, rehydrated,
and then incubated in 20 mg/ml proteinase K for 15 min.
TUNEL was accomplished by using a DNA fragmentation
detection kit (QIA33; Oncogene, Boston, MA). After the sections had been immersed in 100 ll of 3% H2O2 for 5 min, they
were incubated in a TdT labeling reaction mixture in a humidified chamber for 90 min at 37 C. Then, they were incubated
in the stop buffer at 37 C for 5 min. Sections were washed
with PBS before being incubated in a blocking buffer for 30
min at room temperature, colored with diaminobenzidineâ€“
H2O2 solution, and counterstained with methyl green.
Cell Culture and Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation
Mouse brain endothelial cells (MBECsl bEnd.3; ATCC,
CRL-2299) and astrocytes (astrocytes type I clone; ATCC;
CRL-2541) were used for the in vitro experiment. The
LY294002 (a PI3 kinase inhibitor) was obtained from Cell Signaling, and the STAT3 inhibitor VI was from Merck Millipore.
For oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), cells were transferred to
a hypoxic chamber (VS-9000GC, Bionex, Bucheon, Korea)
with an atmosphere of 5% O2 and 95% N2 in glucose-free media
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY) for the indicated times. OGD was
ended by changing to normal media and returning the cultures
to the normoxic incubator for 24 hr before sampling.
Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction
MBECs and astrocytes were harvested, and total RNA
was isolated from cells treated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen,
La Jolla, CA). We obtained Taqman probes for VEGF, eNOS,
Ang1, Ang2, Tie2, and GAPDH RNA from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction

(PCR) was performed by6 using the TaqMan real-time PCR
method on an ABI 7500 Real Time PCR System (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems, Lincoln, CA). The following PCR
conditions were used: after the initial activation of uracyl-Nglycosylase at 50 C for 2 min, AmpliTaq Gold was activated at
95 C for 10 min; the subsequent PCR conditions consisted of
45 cycles of denaturation at 95 C for 15 sec and annealing
extension at 60 C for 1 min per cycle. During the PCR amplification, the amplified products were measured continuously by
determining the fluorescence emission. All PCRs were performed in triplicate, and the relative gene expression data were
analyzed using the 22DDCt method by normalizing to GAPDH
RNA.
Wound Healing and Tube Formation Assays
The cell migration scratch assay and tube formation assay
were performed as previously described (Chen and Easton,
2011). For the wound healing assay, MBECs (5 3 105 per well)
were seeded in six-well plates and allowed to adhere for 24 hr.
The cells were wounded with a yellow tip and washed with
PBS. Fresh, full medium was added, and the cells were treated
with NaHS and LY2994002 (20 lM) as indicated for 20 hr.
Photographs were taken at the same position of the wound. For
tube formation assay, 24-well plates were coated with Matrigel
and incubated at 37 C for 1 hr. MBECs (2 3 104 cells) were
plated with NaHS and LY294002, as indicated in Results.
Tube formation was quantitated 6 hr after treatment.
Statistical Analysis
Values are presented as mean 6 SD. Data were analyzed
via unpaired Studentâ€™s t-test and ANOVA (analysis of variance)
test when appropriate. Otherwise, the nonparametric Mannâ€“
Whitney U test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for
unpaired or paired samples, respectively. A two-tailed value of
P < 0.05 was considered significant.

RESULTS
Treatment With H2S Improves Neurological
Outcome
To investigate the therapeutic possibility of H2S for
the treatment of cerebral ischemic stroke, we administered daily either NaHS (5 mg/kg) or NaCl from the
third day after the reperfusion (Fig. 1A). Interestingly,
treatment with NaHS significantly improved neurological
outcomes on the corner turn test (P < 0.001; Fig. 1B) and
the limb placing test (P < 0.05, P < 0.01; Fig. 1C) compared with control rats. In contrast, the infarction volume
was not significantly reduced in NaHS-treated rats compared with control group rats (Fig. 1D). Therefore, we
hypothesized that H2S affects regeneration after ischemic
brain injury and that it improves neurological function.
Treatment With H2S Significantly Enhances
Endothelial Cell Synthesis
Treatment with H2S significantly increased the percentage of GFAP1 (8.03% 6 1.17% vs. 13.55% 6 2.36%,
P < 0.01), MAP21 (6.93% 6 1.89% vs. 23.74% 6 5.31%,

(11.35% 6 2.25%
vs.
P < 0.001),
and
NeuN1
17.67% 6 4.95%, P < 0.05) cells in the ischemic lesion
compared with the percentage in the control group (Fig.
2A). In addition, H2S treatment increased the number of
BrdU1 cells (8.47% 6 2.08% vs. 19.65% 6 5.4%,
P < 0.001) in the ischemic brain compared with the control (Fig. 2B). However, H2S treatment did not significantly increase the number of BrdU-MAP2 or
BrdU2NeuN double-positive cells. Instead, the percentage of TUNEL1 cells was significantly lower in the H2Streated group (102.2% 6 19.3% vs. 77.85% 6 4.31%,
P < 0.01; Fig. 2C). Therefore, we investigated whether
the hypothesized neurological recovery ability of H2S
comes from vascular regeneration. Figure 2D indicates
that BrdU and CD31 double-positive cells, which were
newly synthesized endothelial cells, were significantly
(3.2 6 0.8 vs. 7.4 6 0.7 cells/mm2, P < 0.01) increased in
the ipsilateral hemisphere of H2S-treated rats compared
with the ipsilateral hemisphere of control rats. Our data
indicated that H2S promotes vasculogenesis after stroke.
H2S Treatment Induces VEGF and Angiogenic
Factor After Ischemic Stroke Through AKT and
ERK Phosphorylation
To examine the signaling pathways through which
H2S improves neurological outcomes after cerebral ischemia, we measured the phosphorylation of AKT and
ERK, and the level of HIF1a by using Western blot analysis. AKT phosphorylation was minimally detected in the
contralateral hemisphere, and a fourfold increase in AKT
phosphorylation was detected in the ischemic lesion
(P < 0.001; Fig. 3A,C). Notably, the ischemic lesion of
H2S-treated rats showed a significantly increased phosphorylation of AKT (1.6-fold increase, P < 0.01) compared with the control group, and even the contralateral
hemisphere showed AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 3A,C).
Consistently, the densities of p-ERK1 and p-ERK2 in
the ischemic lesion were, respectively, 1.27- and 1.32fold higher (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05) in the H2S-treated
group compared with the control group (Fig. 3A,C).
HIF21a was highly expressed in the ischemic lesion of
H2S-treated rats (3.93-fold increase, P < 0.01; Fig. 3A,C).
Because VEGF and Ang-1 are important angiogenic
factors, we next examined their expression in the ischemic brain with or without the administration of H2S. H2S
treatment significantly increased the VEGF levels (3.9fold, P < 0.001) at the ischemic boundary regions compared withnontreated control rats (Fig. 3B,C). Ang-1, a
member of the endothelial growth factor family, was
highly expressed in H2S-treated ischemic lesions (1.65fold, P < 0.05; Fig. 3B,C). Consistently, H2S treatment
showed a 1.82-fold increase of VEGF1 cells and a 1.87fold increase of Ang-11 cells (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001;
Fig. 3D). In addition, stroke itself induced the BrdU1
cells, and treatment with H2S increased the number of
BrdU1 cells, indicating newly proliferating cells (Fig. 2B).
These data indicate that treatment with H2S induced
VEGF and Ang-1, which promotes vascular regeneration.

H2S Enhances Angiogenic Gene Expression in
Astrocytes and MBECs
To elucidate the molecular mechanism of H2S
effects in ischemic stroke, we first assessed an in vitro
OGD model in the astrocytes. AKT and ERK phosphorylation were increased after OGD, and HIF1a was also
increased. Interestingly, 5 mM of NaHS enhanced AKT
and ERK phosphorylation as well as the level of HIF1a
protein compared with NaCl-treated cells (Fig. 4A).
Astrocytes form contacts with blood vessels and secrete
crucial angiogenic factors that promote the proliferation
of endothelial cells. The induction of VEGF, Ang-1, and
Ang-2 was observed after OGD in astrocytes (Fig. 4A),
and quantitative analysis showed 2.5-, 1.48-, and 2.65fold increases, respectively. OGD with 5 mM of NaHS

significantly upregulated 4.13-, 1.59-, 4.61-fold increases
in VEGF, Ang1, and Ang2, respectively, compared with
OGD with NaCl (P < 0.001; Fig. 4A). The real-time
PCR data revealed that astrocytes exhibited a notable
induction of VEGF, Ang-1, and Ang-2 expression
(P < 0.05, P < 0.01, n.s., respectively; Fig. 4C).
In MBECs, H2S treatment significantly increased
the levels of p-AKT, p-ERK, HIF1a, and VEGF in a
time-dependent manner up to 180 min (P < 0.001,
P < 0.01, n.s., respectively; Fig. 4B). For real-time PCR
data, MBECs also showed the induction of VEGF, Ang1, and Ang-2 expression, but not as much as was exhibited by the astrocytes (P < 0.05; Fig. 4D). These data suggest that treatment with H2S induced VEGF and Ang-1,
which promotes vascular regeneration.

PI3K-AKT SignalingMediates H2S-Induced VEGF
Expression and Angiogenesis In Vitro
To elucidate the mechanism underlying H2Sinduced VEGF expression, we treated H2S with or without PI3-kinase or STAT3 inhibitor in astrocytes and
MBECs. Astrocytes were treated with 5 mM NaHS for 2
hr of OGD stimulus. The increase in the VEGF levels
was significantly blocked by the specific PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002; in contrast, the STAT3 inhibitor was not

able to change the VEGF protein level (P < 0.001; Fig.
5A) or the RNA expression (P < 0.01; Fig. 5C). MBECs
were treated with 5 mM NaHS for 6 hr with either
LY294002 or the STAT3 inhibitor VI. The VEGF level
was significantly blocked by 294002 but not by the
STAT3 inhibitor VI. Consistently, the real-time PCR
data showed that VEGF induction was inhibited by
LY294002 but not by STAT3 inhibitor in MBECs
(P < 0.05 and n.s., respectively; Fig. 5B,D).
During angiogenesis, endothelial cells have to
migrate and then reorganize individual cells into a threedimensional, tube-like structure to form vessel lumen.
Therefore, we investigated the effects of H2S on endothelial cell migration by using the scratch wound healing
assay and the tube formation assay. NaHS at 5 mM accelerated the wound healing of MBECs by 3.92-fold compared with NaCl-treated cells (P < 0.001; Fig. 6A,C).
The wound healing effect of H2S treatment was not
detected after treatment with LY294002, suggesting that
H2S promotes endothelial cell migration through PI3K/
AKT cascade signal transduction. The effect of H2S on
tube formation was examined after 20 hr of culture.
NaHS (5 mM) treatment showed a 3.69-fold increase in
microvessel tube formation compared with NaCl treatment, and LY294002 (1.5 mM) treatment blocked the formation of the tube-like structure (P < 0.001, P < 0.01,
respectively; Fig. 6B,C).
DISCUSSION
H2S is known to be involved in many biological processes, including the cardiovascular, nervous, and immune
systems. In ischemic stroke, the administration of H2S
results in neuroprotection against cerebral I/R injuries by
withstanding oxidative stress (Ren et al., 2010; Li et al.,
2011). In addition to its neuroprotective effect, we investigated whether H2S plays a role in regeneration to
explore potential therapeutic possibilities. Through in
vivo and in vitro analysis, we demonstrated that treatment
with H2S enhances angiogenesis in ischemic stroke, and
we demonstrated a cooperative mechanism between
astrocytes and endothelial cells.

Cerebral blood flow is important for the maintenance of neural function (Pratt et al., 2004). Stroke
patients who had an increase in cerebral blood vessel density, for instance, showed better progress and longer survival times (Krupinski et al., 1994). We noticed more
neural cells and fewer apoptotic cells in the H2S-treated
group, and these differences were related to the neuroprotective effect, not to the neurogenesis or astrocytogenesis
(Fig. 2A,C). We hypothesized that H2S promotes angiogenesis, improves cerebral blood flow in the ischemic
lesion, and is eventually beneficial for neural function. Figure 2B,D supports our hypothesis, showing that newly synthesized endothelial cells were increased upon H2S
treatment. To exclude the acute antioxidative effect, we
administered H2S 3 days after MCAO (Fig. 1A), and we
maintained daily administration for 11 days. Figure 1C,D
shows that the administration of H2S significantly improved
functional recovery without reducing infarct volume (Fig.
1B) or changing blood pressure (Supp. Info. Fig. 1).
Interestingly, the VEGF protein level was markedly
increased in the ischemic hemisphere after I/R injury
(Fig. 3B,D). Because VEGF represents a master mediator
that initiates the process of angiogenesis through the
recruitment and proliferation of endothelial cells, the
induction of VEGF by H2S is crucial for reinforcing
stroke-induced angiogenesis. In a previous study, the
administration of recombinant VEGF to ischemic rats
enhanced angiogenesis in the ischemic penumbra and
improved neurological recovery (Zhang et al., 2000; Sun
et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2007). Ang-1 is a member of the
endothelial growth factor family and a ligand for the
endothelial cell-specific receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2
(Marti and Risau, 1999; Saito et al., 2003). Ang-1 and
Ang-2 have been found to regulate the maturation of
new blood vessels from proliferated endothelial cells.
Consistently, we observed that H2S treatment increased
Ang-1 expression in the ischemic brain after Western

data suggest that H2S-induced angiogenesis may be mediated through AKT and/or ERK. The activation of PI3K/
AKT signaling has been reported to promote VEGF production through the regulation of HIF1a stability (Jiang
et al., 2000; Laughner et al., 2001; Semenza, 2003).
Indeed, HIF1a was increased in ischemic brain tissue
(Fig. 3A). Conversely, STAT3 regulates VEGF expression, thereby contributing to HIF1a expression/activity
and to oncogenic angiogenesis (Xu et al., 2005). Interestingly, LY294002 treatment and the inhibition of PI3K/

It is notable that increases in the VEGF protein level
follow AKT and ERK phosphorylation in ischemic brain
tissue. H2S treatment activates AKT and ERK phosphorylation in astrocytes and MBECs (Fig. 4A,B). Thus, our

AKT signaling decreased the H2S-mediated expression of
VEGF; in contrast, the STAT3 inhibitor did not affect
the H2S-mediated induction of VEGF (Fig. 5). Our data

suggest that PI3K/AKT signaling regulates the H2S-mediated increase of VEGF expression. Astrocytes are able to
secrete actively a variety of chemicals for neurovascular
function. Figure 3C indicates that VEGF induced by H2S
treatment seems to localize in astrocytes. Indeed, the in
vitro data revealed that astrocytes exhibited significantly
increased VEGF and Ang-1 gene expression in the H2S
stimuli (Fig. 4C); in contrast, MBECs showed only mildly
increased expression (Fig. 4D). Because MAP2-positive
and NeuN-positive cells are significantly increased in the
ischemic lesion of H2S-treated rats (Fig. 2), we could not
exclude the possibility that H2S also increases phosphorylation of AKT in neurons. In fact, previous authors have
explained how the activation of AKT promotes cell survival and growth and increases the ability of neurons to
survive after brain injury (Brunet et al., 1999, 2001;
Zhang et al., 2012). Therefore PI3K/AKT signaling
should be further characterized.
AKT has a multipotent role that can impact diseases
of the central nervous system, including stroke (Berra
et al., 2000; Shiojima and Walsh, 2002; Byrnes and
Faden, 2007). AKT phosphorylation has been reported to
mediate endothelial cell proliferation and migration in
vitro and to promote vascularization in vivo (Rikitake
et al., 2002; Kawasaki et al., 2003; Silvestre et al., 2003;
Calabro et al., 2004) H2S treatment phosphorylated AKT
in a dose-dependent manner in MBECs (Fig. 4B), and it
increased endothelial cell migration and tube formation
(Fig. 6A,B). The inhibition of PI3K/AKT cascade did
not show H2S-induced angiogenetic effects in MBECs
(Fig. 6A,B). Previous studies have demonstrated that an
AKT-dependent mechanism mediates the phosphorylation of eNOS at S1177 (Dimmeler et al., 1999; Gao
et al., 2002). Furthermore, H2S regulates cardioprotection
through eNOS phosphorylation at the S1177 (King et al.,
2014). In this study, H2S treatment showed increase of peNOS in ischemic lesion (Supp. Info. Fig. 2). Figure 6D
proposes a model for H2S effects in ischemic stroke. H2S
administration provokes astrocytes to secrete angiogenic
factors, which influence endothelial cells to facilitate
angiogenesis, and this cascade significantly improves neurological function after ischemic stroke. PI3K/AKT signaling is crucial for the H2S-mediated angiogenic effect in
ischemic stroke. In future studies, the angiogenic effects
