Abstract
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is linked to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)
and Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) signaling pathways. During
brain ischemia/reperfusion, EGFR could be transactivated, which stimulates these intracellular signaling cascades that either
protect cells or potentiate cell injury. In the present study, we investigated the activation of EGFR, PI3K/AKT, and Raf/MAPK/
ERK1/2 during ischemia or reperfusion of the brain using the middle cerebral artery occlusion model. We found that EGFR
was phosphorylated and transactivated during both ischemia and reperfusion periods. During ischemia, the activity of PI3K/
AKT pathway was significantly increased, as judged from the strong phosphorylation of AKT; this activation was suppressed
by the inhibitors of EGFR and Zn-dependent metalloproteinase. Ischemia, however, did not induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation,
which was dependent on reperfusion. Coimmunoprecipitation of Son of sevenless 1 (SOS1) with EGFR showed increased
association between the receptor and SOS1 in ischemia, indicating the inhibitory node downstream of SOS1. The inhibitory
phosphorylation site of Raf-1 at Ser259, but not its stimulatory phosphorylation site at Ser338, was phosphorylated during
ischemia. Furthermore, ischemia prompted the interaction between Raf-1 and AKT, while both the inhibitors of PI3K and
AKT not only abolished AKT phosphorylation but also restored ERK1/2 phosphorylation. All these findings suggest that Raf/
MAPK/ERK1/2 signal pathway is inhibited by AKT via direct phosphorylation and inhibition at Raf-1 node during ischemia.
During reperfusion, we observed a significant increase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation but no change in AKT phosphorylation.
Inhibitors of reactive oxygen species and phosphatase and tensin homolog restored AKT phosphorylation but abolished
ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting that the reactive oxygen species-dependent increase in phosphatase and tensin homolog
activity in reperfusion period relieves ERK1/2 from inhibition of AKT.

Introduction
Receptors to growth factors are functionally linked to
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) intracellular
signaling pathways. When members of epidermal growth
factor (EGF) family bind to EGF receptor (EGFR), the
EGFR becomes phosphorylated (activated) on tyrosine
residues. Subsequently, the guanine nucleotide exchange
factor Son of sevenless 1 (SOS1) becomes activated,
thus leading to stimulation of the small G-protein Ras.

The latter actuates serine/threonine-kinase Raf, the ﬁrst
kinase of the three-tiered MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway. There
are three Raf isoforms, Raf-1/c-Raf, B-Raf, and A-Raf
(for review, see Matallanas et al., 2011), of which Raf-1
has been extensively studied. Raf-1 has several phosphorylation sites, among which phosphorylation of Ser338 is
required for Raf-1 activation (Mercer and Pritchard,
2003). Phosphorylation of Ser259, to the contrary, inhibits the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway (Abraham et al., 2000;
Yip-Schneider et al., 2000; Dhillon et al., 2002; Adler
et al., 2008). PI3K is a lipid protein kinase functionally
positioned downstream of Ras. Once activated, PI3K
converts membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol (4,5)bisphosphate into phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate. This latter anchors AKT to the plasma membrane
and allows its phosphorylation.
In addition to direct stimulation by EGF family members, the EGFR transactivation is operative under various conditions. In the process of transactivation, an
increase in intracellular Ca2þ concentration ([Ca2þ]i)
(Zwick et al., 1997; Piiper et al., 2003; Peng et al.,
2012) mediated by activation of Gi/o or Gq proteincoupled receptors (Pierce et al., 2001; Peng et al., 2003)
or by other stimuli leads to Zn2þ-dependent metalloproteinase-catalyzed shedding of a growth factor of the
EGFR family (Cai et al., 2011). This agonist stimulates
EGFRs on the same cell or its neighbor(s) and activates
two major intracellular signaling cascades represented by
the MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways (Gu et al.,
2007). Cardioprotection of EGFR transactivation has
been extensively studied in ischemic preconditioning by
exposing the heart to brief cycles of ischemia and reperfusion (for review, see Downey et al., 2007, 2008). EGFR
is also involved in reperfusion-induced arrhythmias (Feng
et al., 2012). In the brain in vivo, hypoxia caused nitric
oxide (NO)-mediated increase of EGFR phosphorylation
and its activity in cerebral cortex of newborn piglets
(Mishra et al., 2010). In middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) model, EGFR phosphorylation was found in
the cortex boundary zone at 3, 7, and 14 days after 1-hr
transient ischemia (Yang et al., 2011). Inhibition of
EGFR with the neutralizing antibody C225 reduced
infarct volume and attenuated reactive astrogliosis in
MCAO model (Yang et al., 2011). The PI3K/AKT pathway is believed to mediate cell protection (Murphy and
Steenbergen, 2008), whereas the functions of MAPK/
ERK1/2 pathway are more complex. Transient, moderate
ERK phosphorylation mediates cell protection, for example, during ischemic precondition (Murphy and
Steenbergen, 2008), whereas sustained, extensive ERK
phosphorylation may induce cell injury (Martin and
Pognonec, 2010). Cell damage in ischemia occurs because
of ATP depletion that leads to a loss of cellular ionic
homeostasis and membrane depolarization, which, in
turn, increases intracellular Ca2þ concentration and

mitochondrial depolarization, decreases intracellular
pH, and triggers massive release of glutamate. In clinical
settings, only a small part of patients experience complete
reperfusion, with majority having either partial reperfusion or no reperfusion at all (see Zhao et al., 2007, and
references thereby). During reperfusion, cells experience
extensive oxidative damage because restoration of oxygen
results in generation of large amount of reactive oxygen
species (ROS; Murphy and Steenbergen, 2008). Further
understanding of signaling pathways during ischemia/
reperfusion could provide detailed information about
mechanisms underlying cell protection or cell injury.
Conceptually, the PI3K/AKT and Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2
represent two parallel signal pathways. Interactions
between PI3K/AKT and Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2 pathways
may occur at several diﬀerent stages and could be either
positive or negative. In preliminary experiments, we
found that ERK activity was dependent on reperfusion.
We hypothesized that the PI3K/AKT signal pathway is
involved in the regulation of ERK activity during ischemia or reperfusion. Therefore, in the following study, we
investigated the activation of EGFR and its two intracellular signal pathways, MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT
during ischemia or reperfusion in MCAO model.

Methods and Materials
Animals
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 280 to 400 g,
were housed in cages on a 12-hr light/dark cycle in a
temperature-controlled (23 C–25 C) colony room with
free access to food and water. All experiments were carried out in accordance with the USA National Institute of
Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals, and all experimental protocols were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
China Medical University.

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Focal brain ischemia was induced unilaterally by occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCAO) as previously described (Longa et al., 1989). Brieﬂy, rats were
anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg,
i.p.), and the right common and external carotid arteries
were exposed. A 30-mm segment of 4-0 ethilon monoﬁlament (Ethilon; Johnson & Johnson, Woluwe, Belgium)
was gently inserted from the external carotid artery into
the internal carotid artery lumen and advanced toward
the origin of the middle cerebral artery until a slight
resistance was felt. The ﬁlament had been coated with
polylysine, and its tip rounded by heating. The rats
were killed after 2 hr of MCAO with/without 0.5, 1, or
2 hr of reperfusion.

Intraventricular injection was performed according to
the rat brain atlas by Paxinos and Watson (2007). Rats
were anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/
kg, i.p.) and were placed in the stereotaxic frame. Midline
incision was made to see the bregma suture. The surgical
site was cleaned, and the holes were made by an electric
dental drill at the right ventricle at 1.0 mm posterior
to bregma, 1.5 mm lateral from midline. Stainless
steel microinjector was stereotaxically implanted
into the hole at 4.0 mm vertically from the skull
surface. The microinjector was left in place for 10 min
to minimize backﬂow and then removed. The
drugs were gently injected intraventricularly, dissolved
in 4 or 5 ll physiological saline, at the following concentrations: 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-benzopyran4-one hydrochloride (LY294002), 2 mM; tyrphostin
4-(3-chloroanilino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline (AG1478),
100 lM; catalase, 20,000 U/ml; rapamycin, 100 lM; 1,4diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio] butadiene (U0126), 1 mM; triciribine hydrate (TCN), 1 mM;
and bisperoxovanadium (BPV), 10 lM. The drugs were
injected into the right lateral ventricle 15 min before
MCAO or 15 min before reperfusion. With a brain
weight in the rat of 1 to 2 g, the intracerebral concentrations are probably at least 100 times smaller.

Brain Section
At the end of experiment, each brain was quickly
removed and collected. Brain sectioning was accomplished according to the protocol previously reported
by Ashwal et al. (1998). Brieﬂy, the brains were sectioned
into three parts, the ﬁrst part begun in 3 mm from the
anterior tip of the frontal lobe. The second part (4 mm
thick) was used for the measurement. Regions from the
right and left hemispheres of the second part that corresponded to the ischemic core and penumbra were dissected. A longitudinal cut (from top to bottom) was
made approximately 2 mm from the midline through
each hemisphere. Then, a transverse diagonal cut was
made at approximately the 2 o’clock position to separate
the core (i.e., striatum and overlying cortex) from the
penumbra (adjacent cortex). Thereafter, tissues were
homogenized in lysis buﬀer containing protease inhibitors (10 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylmethyl
sulfonyl ﬂuoride, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate) and
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 C. Supernatants
were collected and stored at 40 C.

Coimmunoprecipitation of EGFR and SOS1, and
Raf-1 and Phospho-Akt
The brains were homogenized with EBC buﬀer (50 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40,
100 mM NaF, 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM

phenylmethyl sulfonyl ﬂuoride, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate) and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at
4 C. Supernatants were collected and stored at 40 C.
The coimmunoprecipitation was performed with antiEGFR antibody or with anti-Raf-1 antibody and protein
agarose bead. The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with the anti-SOS1 antibody or anti-EGFR
antibody at 1  500 or at 1  800 dilution, or with the
anti-phospho-Akt (p-AKT) antibody or anti-AKT antibody at 1  500 or at 1  1,000 dilution for 2 hr at 25 C.

Western Blotting for Phosphorylated ERK and
p-AKT, p-Raf Ser259, and p-Raf Ser338
The protein content was determined in the homogenates
by the Bradford method (Bradford, 1976), using bovine
serum albumin as the standard. Samples 80 lg of protein
were applied on the slab gel of 10% polyacrylamide.
After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, the samples
were blocked by 5% skimmed milk powder in TBS-T
(30 mM Tris-HCl, 125 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for
1 hr. The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with
the ﬁrst antibody, speciﬁc to phosphorylated ERK
(p-ERK1/2) at 1  1,000 dilution, ERK1/2 at 1  3,000
dilution, p-AKT at 1  1,000 dilution, AKT at 1  1,000
dilution, p-Raf Ser259 at 1  1,000 dilution, p-Raf Ser338
at 1  1,000 dilution, and Raf-1 at 1  1,000 dilution for
2 hr at room temperature. After washing, speciﬁc binding
was detected by goat-anti-mouse or goat-anti-rabbit
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
at 1  1,500 dilution or at 1  3,000 dilution. Staining
was visualized by ECL detection reagents. Digital
images obtained using Gel-Imaging System (Tanon
4200, Shanghai, China). Optical density for each band
was assessed using the Window Alpha-Ease TM FC 32bit software.

(Figure 1(d)). To identify the role for EGFR transactivation, the AG1478, an inhibitor of EGFR or GM6001,
an inhibitor of Zn2þ-dependent metalloproteinase and
therefore the subsequent shedding of growth factor(s)
were injected intraventricularly before ischemia. Both
drugs abolished phosphorylation of AKT (Figure 2(a)
and (b)), indicating the involvement of EGFR activity
and shedding of growth factor(s). In the presence
of both AG1478 and GM6001, we observed an increase
of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting that ERK1/2
phosphorylation during ischemia is suppressed by activation of EGFR and its downstream signals (Figure 2(c)
and (d)). Obviously, this ERK1/2 phosphorylation
is not mediated by EGFR because it is increased
but not inhibited in the presence of AG1478 and
GM6001.

SOS1 and Raf-1 Activation During Ischemia
Statistics
The diﬀerences between individual groups were analyzed
by one-way analysis of variance followed by Fisher’s least
signiﬁcant diﬀerence test. The comparisons were made
between the core region on the lesion side with the
same region on the contralateral side, and the penumbra
on lesion side with the corresponding region on the
contralateral side, to identify the signiﬁcance related to
ischemia/reperfusion. The level of signiﬁcance was set at
p < .05.

Results
EGFR, ERK1/2, and AKT Activation During Ischemia
First, we investigated EGFR status by quantifying its
phosphorylation by immunoprecipitation and speciﬁc
antibodies. EGFR was precipitated with a speciﬁc antibody. Western blot showed an increase of EGFR activity
during ischemia that was conﬁrmed by an antibody speciﬁc to tyrosine phosphorylation sites in both core and
penumbra in ischemic hemisphere (Figure 1(a)). With
site-speciﬁc antibodies, phosphorylation of Y1173,
Y845, and Y1045 was enhanced after 2 hr of ischemia
(Figure 1(b)). The greatest stimulation was observed
at Y845 that was around 400% of contralateral
hemisphere. In contrast, Y992 and Y1068 were not
phosphorylated in both contralateral and ischemia
hemispheres.
Next, we analyzed ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation
by Western blot. There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in
ERK1/2 phosphorylation neither in the core nor in the
penumbra areas between ischemic and contralateral
hemispheres after 2 hr of ischemia (Figure 1(c)). In contrast, AKT phosphorylation was signiﬁcantly increased in
both core and penumbra regions of ischemic hemisphere

Subsequently, we examined the interactions between
SOS1 and EGFR. Coimmunoprecipitation of SOS1
with EGFR antibody showed a signiﬁcant increase of
binding of SOS1 to EGFR after 2-hr ischemia in both
core and penumbra areas in ischemic hemisphere as
expected (Figure 3(a)), indicating that ischemia has a
stimulatory (rather than inhibitory) eﬀect on the interaction and SOS1 activity and that ischemia interferes
with ERK1/2 phosphorylation at a site downstream of
SOS1. Taking in account high levels of AKT activity
during ischemia and its inhibitory eﬀect on Raf-1
(Zimmermann and Moelling, 1999; Moelling et al.,
2002), we further analyzed the phosphorylation of inhibitory Raf-1 Ser259 site and stimulatory Raf-1 Ser338
site of Raf-1 by Western blot. Two hr of ischemia
enhanced Raf-1 Ser259 phosphorylation signiﬁcantly
but had no eﬀect on Raf-1 Ser338 (Figure 3(b)), suggesting that a decrease of Raf-1 activity is likely to be
responsible for the ischemia-induced MAPK/ERK1/2
inactivation.

Crosstalk Between PI3K/AKT and Raf-1 During
Ischemia
To monitor interactions between p-AKT and Raf-1, we
performed coimmunoprecipitation of p-AKT with a speciﬁc antibody to Raf-1. Western blot shows that binding
of p-AKT to Raf-1 was stimulated by ischemia
(Figure 3(c)). Intraventricular injection of LY294002,
an inhibitor of PI3K, performed prior to ischemic insult
abolished the stimulation of AKT phosphorylation
(Figure 4(a)) but increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation,
suggesting a recovery of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by
inhibition of PI3K (Figure 4(b)), and indicating the
inhibitory eﬀect of PI3K/AKT on Raf-1/MAPK/ERK1/
2 pathway. AKT inhibitor, TCN also inhibited AKT

Crosstalk Between PI3K/AKT and Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2
During Reperfusion
Intracerebroventricular injection of U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK after 2 hr of ischemia but before 1-hr
reperfusion reversed the stimulation of p-ERK. Both
p-ERK 1 and p-ERK 2 are signiﬁcantly lower in the
core and penumbra on lesion side than on the contralateral side as expected, while no eﬀect on AKT phosphorylation was observed (Figure 8(a) and (b)),
indicating that MAPK/ERK 1/2 has no inhibitory
eﬀect on PI3K/AKT signal pathway during reperfusion. In Figure 8(b), p-AKT is signiﬁcantly higher
in the core than penumbra in both contralateral and
ischemic sides. However, there is no diﬀerence
between the cores in contralateral and ischemic
sides, suggesting the high p-AKT in core is not related
to ischemia. Finally, we injected catalase, an
enzyme degrading hydrogen peroxide and hence
counteraction eﬀects of ROS after 2-hr ischemia but
before 1-hr reperfusion. Injection of catalase abolished stimulation of ERK 1/2 phosphorylation
(Figure 9(a)), and restored AKT phosphorylation
(Figure 9(b)). BPV, an inhibitor of phosphatase and
tensin homolog (PTEN) had similar eﬀect (Figure 9(c)
and (d)).

Discussion
Experiments on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion model
demonstrated that ERK phosphorylation depends on
reperfusion (Omura et al., 1999), but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Even less is known about the
eﬀects of ischemia/reperfusion in the brain. In the present
article, we performed systematic analysis of EGFR and its
two signal pathways Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT
during ischemia and reperfusion using rat MCAO model.
We have investigated (a) the EGFR transactivation and
the activations of PI3K/AKT and Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2
signal pathways during ischemia, (b) the interaction
between PI3K/AKT and Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2 signal pathways during ischemia, (c) the EGFR transactivation and
the activations of PI3K/AKT and Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2
signal pathways during reperfusion, and (d) the interaction
of PI3K/AKT and Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2 signal pathways
during reperfusion.
First, we found that there was no increase of ERK1/2
phosphorylation during ischemia, but phosphorylation
signiﬁcantly increased in reperfusion. This is similar to
myocardial ischemia/reperfusion model (Omura et al.,
1999). Phosphorylation of AKT was signiﬁcantly
enhanced during ischemia, and it was inhibited by both
AG 1478, an inhibitor of EGFR and GM6001, an inhibitor of Zn2þ-dependent metalloproteinase, indicating an

involvement of EGFR transactivation. Activation of
EGFR was further conﬁrmed by EGFR phosphorylation
at Y1173, Y845, and Y1045 cites during ischemia. In
some cases (Figures 2, 5, and 9), the p-AKT in the core
is higher than in the penumbra in the contralateral side.
We do not know the physiological signiﬁcance of this phenomenon yet, but it seems to be unrelated to ischemia or
reperfusion. The EGF can induce phosphorylation of all

ﬁve tyrosine phosphorylation sites of EGFR (Peng et al.,
2010). Among these sites, Y992, Y1173, and Y1045 are
autophosphorylation sites, with Y1173 as a major one
and Y992 as a minor one. The Y845 is known to be a
major Src phosphorylation site (Biscardi et al., 1999;
Tice et al., 1999; Wu et al., 2002). Ultraviolet B radiation
was also shown to promote the phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues of EGFR, including Y845, and

subsequently potentiate PI3K/AKT phosphorylation and
inactivation of ERK1/2 signaling cascade in epidermal
keratinocytes (Iordanov et al., 2002); this response being
cell-type-speciﬁc. Y1068 is not phosphorylated in the brain
in vivo (Du et al., 2009) neither it is phosphorylated in cultured astrocytes, unless the latter were stimulated by EGF
(Peng et al., 2010) or by ammonium (Dai et al., 2013).
Second, we found that despite the absence of ERK1/2
phosphorylation, the interaction between EGFR and
SOS1 was seemingly normal and was stimulated by ischemia. However, the stimulatory phosphorylation site of

Raf-1, Ser338 was not phosphorylated by ischemia.
Instead, the phosphorylation of inhibitory site Ser259
was enhanced. This indicates that the Raf/MAPK/
ERK1/2 signal pathway is inhibited at the site of Raf-1.
Phosphorylation of Ser338 is required for Raf activation
and also potentiates the association between Raf and
MAPK (Chaudhary et al., 2000; Xiang et al., 2002),
whereas phosphorylation of Raf-1 Ser259 interfered
with membrane association and activity of Raf-1
(Kubicek et al., 2002). Furthermore, we found that coimmunoprecipitation of AKT with Raf-1 antibody

indicated increased interaction between p-AKT and Raf1 during ischemia. The inhibitory eﬀect of PI3K/AKT on
Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway was further conﬁrmed by
the increase of ERK phosphorylation by LY294002, an
inhibitor of PI3K and triciribine hydrate (TCN), an inhibitor of AKT. All these suggest an inhibitory eﬀect of PI3K/
AKT on Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway during ischemic
period. Similar inhibition has been reported for other tissues
and cells, such as AKT-induced phosphorylation of Raf-1 at
Ser259 by insulin-like growth factor 1 in MCF-7, a human
breast cancer cell line (Zimmermann and Moelling, 1999;
Moelling et al., 2002) and by platelet-derived growth
factor in vascular smooth muscle cells (Reusch et al.,
2001). Nevertheless, AKT inhibited the ERK1/2 phosphorylation in human myotubes (Rommel et al., 1999), that
eﬀect possibly not being mediated by the direct phosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser259 (Garcia et al., 2009).
Third, we found no increase of AKT phosphorylation
in reperfusion period. However, ERK phosphorylation
was signiﬁcantly enhanced during reperfusion, and it
was inhibited by both AG 1478, an inhibitor of EGFR
and GM6001, an inhibitor of Zn2þ-dependent

metalloproteinase, indicating an involvement of EGFR
transactivation. The sites of EGFR phosphorylation
were the same as ischemic period. As has been reported
previously, permanent increase of EGFR and ERK activity during reperfusion and inhibition of EGFR and ERK
activity have protective eﬀect (Martin and Pognonec,
2010; Yang et al., 2011).
Fourth, we investigated whether PI3K/AKT pathway is
inhibited by Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway during reperfusion. Our data indicate that it is not the case because inhibition of MAPK and ERK1/2 does not reinstate AKT
phosphorylation. However, inhibition of catalase activity
not only abolishes ERK phosphorylation but also restores
AKT phosphorylation. This indicates that both ERK1/2
stimulation and AKT inhibition during reperfusion are
mediated by ROS. ROS-induced EGFR transactivation
has been repeatedly reported (Frank and Eguchi, 2003;
Papaiahgari et al., 2006; Wolf-Goldberg et al., 2013; Xu
et al., 2013). More interesting, ROS stimulates PTEN, a
negative regulator of PI3K/AKT signaling (Hlobilková
et al., 2003) during reperfusion that in turn releases RafMAPK/ERK from inhibitory eﬀect of AKT. This ﬁnding

is in agreement with the ﬁndings that PTEN inhibitors
protect cells from ischemia/reperfusion-induced cell
damage (Mocanu and Yellon, 2007).
Activity of AKT has been studied in the context of preconditioning in combination with MCAO model (Shibata

et al., 2002; Meller et al., 2005). Preconditioning prolonged the AKT phosphorylation and protected neurons
in the penumbra in MCAO model (Nakajima et al.,

Figure 10. Diagram of crosstalk between Raf/MAPK/ERK and
PI3K/AKT signal pathways during brain ischemia and reperfusion.
Ischemia induces EGFR transactivation and phosphorylation at
Y1173, Y845, and Y1045. The activation of EGFR, in turn, significantly stimulates PI3K/AKT signal pathway. Subsequently, AKT
phosphorylates Raf-1 at its inhibitory phosphorylation site Ser259
and inhibits Raf-1 activity. The inhibition of Raf-1 leads to inactivation of its downstream signal MAPK/ERK. During reperfusion, ROS
stimulates both EGFR and PTEN. The latter, in turn, inhibits PI3K/
AKT signal pathway and restores the activity of Raf-1/MAPK/ERK1/2
signal pathway, which is responsible for reperfusion-induced cell
damage. EGFR ¼ epidermal growth factor receptor; ROS ¼ reactive
oxygen species; PTEN ¼ phosphatase and tensin homolog;

before 5-min lethal ischemia. Although AKT played a
protective role, the activation of AKT would not occur
until 1 day after preconditioning and 12 hr after preconditioning combined with ischemia in CA1 region of
hippocampus (Yano et al., 2001). However, in another
study, 3.5 min of ischemia induced increase of AKT phosphorylation transiently in 10 to 60 min after reperfusion
(Namura et al., 2000). These ﬁndings suggest that (a)
there is a transient increase of AKT activity after preconditioning, at the early stage of ischemia (1–2 hr), and after
several hrs of reperfusion; (b) increase of AKT activity
may have protective eﬀects during ischemia and reperfusion periods; and (c) preconditioning-induced AKT phosphorylation may be not related to the protective eﬀect in
lethal ischemia, that occurs several days later.

In summary, negative crosstalk exists between Raf/
MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT signal pathways during
brain ischemia/reperfusion. Our study provides the information about the underlying mechanisms of this interaction, that is, during ischemia, AKT phosphorylates
Raf-1 at its inhibitory phosphorylation site and decreases
Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2 activity; during reperfusion, ROS
stimulates PTEN that erases the inhibition of AKT on
Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling (Figure 10). PI3K/AKT
signaling pathway contributes to cell protection in diﬀerent cells, tissues, and animal models, including focal
ischemia and ischemic postconditioning (see Zhao
et al., 2013, and references thereby). Nevertheless, the
function of Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling may depend
on the type of the cells, the time and extent of ERK
activation, and the kind of stimulation/insult. ERK phosphorylation mediated by preconditioning (Kovalska
et al., 2014) and by numbers of neuroprotective compounds, such as dexmedetomidine, an a2-adrenergic
agonist, (Du et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2013) reduces cell
damage in brain ischemia. However, inhibition of ERK
phosphorylation by administration of MAPK inhibitor
prior to ischemia (in both global brain ischemia and
MCAO model) decreased cell injury, infarct volume,
and neurological deﬁcit (Kindy, 1993; Wang et al.,
2003; Castañeda et al., 2009). Therefore, the understanding of crosstalk between Raf/MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/
AKT signal pathways during brain ischemia/reperfusion
may eventually lead to the development of new therapeutic strategy for the disease. Our ﬁndings suggest that
ROS removes inhibition of AKT on ERK activity during
reperfusion. The strong stimulation of ERK activity plays
a key role in reperfusion-induced cell damage. Inhibitors
of ROS, PTEN, EGFR, and ERK may have therapeutic
potential in clinic for brain ischemia.
