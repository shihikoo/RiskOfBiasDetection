Abstract
Background: Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system, which is
characterized by autoantibodies directed against the water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4). As one of the main water
regulators in the central nervous system, APQ4 is supposed to be involved in the dynamics of brain edema.
Cerebral edema seriously affects clinical outcome after ischemic stroke; we therefore aimed to investigate
whether NMO-antibodies may exert the same functional effects as an AQP4-inhibitor in-vivo in acute ischemic stroke.
Methods: Sixteen male Wistar rats were randomized into two groups twice receiving either purified NMO-IgG or
immune globulin from healthy controls, 24 hours and 30 minutes before middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
was performed. T2-weighted MRI was carried out 24 hours after MCAO.
Results: MRI-examination showed a significant increase of infarct size in relation to the cerebral hemisphere
volume with NMO-IgG treated animals (27.1% ± 11.1% vs. 14.3% ± 7.2%; p < 0.05) when corrected for the
space-occupying effect of vasogenic edema formation and similar results without edema correction (34.4% ± 16.4%
vs. 17.5% ± 9.3%; p < 0.05). Furthermore, T2-RT revealed a significant increase in cortical brain water content of the
treatment group (19.5 ms ± 9.7 ms vs. 9.2 ms ± 5.2 ms; p < 0.05).
Conclusions: These results support the functional impact of NMO-antibodies and also offer an in-vivo-applicable
animal model to investigate the properties of AQP4 in ischemic stroke.

Background
Brain water homeostasis is important to prevent edema
and functional disturbances in the interplay between neurons and glial cells. Brain edema contributes extraordinarily to morbidity and mortality after cerebral ischemic
stroke, mainly due to its space-occupying effect [1-4].
Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is the main glial (astrocytic) water
channel in the brain and is mainly expressed at fluidtissue borders throughout the central nervous system
[5-7]. Recent data suggest that AQP4 is involved in brain
edema formation as well as in edema elimination [8,9].

AQP4 has also been described as an autoantigen in
neuromyelitis optica (NMO), an inflammatory disease
of the central nervous system, mainly affecting the
spinal cord and the optic nerve [10,11]. The clinical
findings associated with AQP4-antibodies include
idiopathic inflammatory demyelinating disorders summarized as “NMO-spectrum disorders”. The defining
marker of these disorders is the presence of AQP4antibodies in sera and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [12].
AQP4-antibodies are synthesized intrathecally at the
disease onset and a down-regulation of AQP4 on astrocytes in-vitro is induced by degradation and internalization of the protein within minutes [13,14]. However,
Rossi et al. recently doubted, that NMO-IgG leads to
inhibition of AQP4 water permeability at all [15].

activates the classical complement cascade leading to impaired membrane integrity of the cultured astrocytes [14,16].
Interestingly, AQP4-IgG also induced a down-regulation of
excitatory amino-acid transporter 2 (EAAT2), an astrocytic
glutamate transporter. Glutamate has long been known to
play an important role in the pathophysiology of cerebral
ischemia [16-18]. Additionally, AQP4 antibodies increase
the permeability of a blood–brain-barrier model using cocultured astrocytes and brain endothelial cells [19].
Recently, intraventricular injection of AQP4-positive
IgG together with human complement has been
shown to induce NMO-like inflammatory brain lesions
[20], and passive transfer of NMO-IgG to EAE-rats induced an exacerbation of the disease and NMO-like lesions
[21,22]. These studies produce first evidence for functional
properties of AQP4-antibodies in an in-vivo animal model.
The involvement of AQP4 in the dynamics of brain
edema and findings of in-vitro studies on properties of
AQP4-antibodies such as the impairment of cell integrity,
the promotion of excitotoxicity and increased permeability
of the blood–brain-barrier, include important pathways
known from the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke [23].
This leads to the assumption, that anti-AQP4 may exert
also in-vivo effects on the extent of ischemic infarction and
edema as well as on functional outcome.
In the present study, we investigated whether administration of NMO-IgG, extracted from one NMO-patient,
influences the development of stroke in an MRI-based
rat middle-cerebral artery occlusion model. Intravenous
immune globulin can reduce infarct volume in rat
models for stroke [24]; therefore, injection of immune
globulin from healthy controls served as placebotreatment in the control group. We found infarct size
being almost doubled in NMO-IgG treated animals. In
addition, vasogenic edema formation, as detected on
quantitative T2-weighted MR-imaging, was increased in
the cortex of NMO-IgG treated animals.
Our results add important information to the in-vivo
effects of AQP4-antibodies in animal models. This
model can be used to elucidate the functional properties
of AQP4 in ischemic stroke in the future.

Methods
Animal preparation

All procedures were carried out in accordance with our
institutional guidelines and the German animal protection legislation and were approved by the regional ethics
committee (Regierungspraesidium Darmstadt).
Sixteen male Wistar Unilever rats (HsdCpb:WU; Harlan
Winkelmann, Germany), weighing 290 to 350 g, were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane (Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany),
delivered through air at 1.0 L/min for two minutes.
Anesthesia was maintained with 2-3% isoflurane delivered
through air at 0.6 L/min during surgery and MR imaging.

Page 2 of 7

During the surgical procedure and MR measurements,
body temperature was monitored with a rectal probe and
maintained at 37°C by external heating.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion

Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed as described previously [24,25]. Briefly, the right
common (CCA), internal (ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA) were exposed through a midline incision of
the neck and the ECA was ligated with a 4–0 suture. A
4–0 silicone-coated nylon suture with a thermically
rounded tip was introduced through an arteriotomy of
the CCA. The occluder was advanced carefully into the
ICA 17.0 to 21.0 mm beyond the carotid bifurcation
until a mild elastic resistance indicated the tip was properly
lodged in the anterior cerebral artery and thus blocked
blood flow to the MCA. Then the occluder was fixed in
place with a 4–0 suture. Ninety minutes after MCAO, the
nylon suture was drawn from the CCA for reperfusion of
the brain. Then the animals were allowed to recover from
anaesthesia in individual cages with free access to food and
water for the remaining survival time of 24 h.
MR imaging

The animals were fixed in a body restrainer with a
tooth-bar and a cone shaped head holder and were
placed in an MRI spectrometer (Bruker PharmaScan
7.0 T, 16 cm, Ettlingen, Germany). Respiratory rate was
monitored by a pressure probe placed between the restrainer and the animal’s thorax. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane delivered through air at 0.6 L/min.
The isoflurane concentration was varied between 2.0
and 3.0% to keep the respiratory rate between 35 and
45/min. Temperature was monitored using a rectal
probe and maintained at 37°C by a thermostatically regulated water flow system during the entire imaging
protocol [24,25].
The MRI-tomograph operates at 300.51 MHz for 1Himaging and is equipped with a 300mT/m self-shielding
gradient system. The linear polarized volume resonator
(diameter 60 mm) was tuned and matched manually.
Localizer images were acquired using a spin-echo sequence. RARE sequences (20 contiguous slices, 1 mm
thickness, TR = 2500 ms, TE = 41.8 ms) were used to verify
symmetric positioning and were repeated after correction
of slice-angulation, if necessary.
T2-Weighted Imaging (T2WI)

A Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill spin echo imaging sequence
was used to map lesion and hemisphere volumes. Eight
contiguous coronal slices with a thickness of 2 mm (gap
0 mm) were acquired (FOV 37 × 37 mm, matrix 512 ×
256, TR 3833.5 msec, 12 echoes: TE 18–216 msec (ΔTE
18 msec), TA 16.25 minutes, NEX 1).

T2-relaxation time (T2RT) was measured in regions of
interest within the center of the ischemic area on all
slices displaying ischemic lesions and a corresponding
position on the contralateral hemisphere. The difference
in T2RT between the ischemic and unaffected hemispheres was calculated.
Computer aided planimetric assessment of ischemic
lesion volumes and hemispheric volumes were performed
by two blinded investigators experienced in experimental
stroke MRI. Ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheric volume and lesion volume on T2WI were determined with
the image analysis software Image J 1.25 s (National Institutes of Health, USA). After optimal adjustment of contrast, the edges of the hemispheres were traced manually
on each slice, using neuroanatomic landmarks. The edges
of the hyperintense ischemic lesions were traced manually
in a similar fashion. The areas were then summed and
multiplied by the slice thickness to calculate volumes. Lesion volumes were calculated with and without edema
correction and expressed as percent of the hemispheric
volume as described previously [26]:
%HLVuc ¼ LV=ððHVc þ HViÞ=2Þ  100Þ
%HLVec ¼ HVc2 þ LV  ðHVc þ HViÞ−HVi2
=ðHVc  ðHVc þ HViÞÞ  100



(%HLVuc = percent hemispheric lesion volume – not
corrected for edema; %HLVec = percent hemispheric lesion
volume – corrected for edema; HVc = volume of the
contralateral hemisphere; HVi = volume of the ipsilateral
hemisphere; LV = lesion volume)
Midline shift (MLS) -quantification was performed on
T2-weighted images where the position of the third ventricle could be determined clearly in all animals. The distance between the outer border of the cortex and the
middle of the third ventricle was measured from the ipsilateral (A) and contralateral (B) side. Measurements were
performed at the level of maximum lateral displacement of
the ventricle. MLS was calculated using the following
equation [4,27]:
MLS ¼ ðA−BÞ=2

Purification of immune globulin

Plasma from one male NMO-patient aged 41, AQP4-IgG
ratio 70.79 in serum (antibody measured by radioimmunoprecipitation with a ratio <10 being negative) was diluted with glycine buffer (0.1 M, pH 9) and applied to a
protein G column (HiTrap - GE) that binds exclusively
IgG. The IgG-fraction was eluted by changing the pH
from 9 to 2.7. The IgG-concentration was determined
by nephelometry (Boehring). IgG-fractions were dialyzed

against PBS to eliminate the glycine and increase the pH
up to 7.4 and diluted with PBS to 9.5 g/L.
Functional testing

Neurological evaluation was performed prior to anesthesia
and 24 hours after induction of ischemia. We applied a
neurological score with ten different sensorimotor and coordinative items, as described by Nedelmann et al. [28].
Furthermore, animals were placed on a rotarod that was
continuously accelerated from 0 rpm to 30 rpm. The maximum speed the animals tolerated without falling off of
the device was recorded [29].
Experimental protocol

Sixteen animals were randomized into two groups, receiving either NMO-IgG (9.5 g/L) or immune globulin
from a pooled sample of 10 healthy controls (controlIgG) as placebo. Two mL of immune globulin were
twice injected intravenously: 24 hours and 30 minutes
before MCAO.
Twenty-four hours after induction of ischemia, the animals were evaluated clinically, subjected to MR-imaging
and then decapitated while under deep anesthesia. The
brains were quickly removed from the skull and inspected
to detect side-effects such as subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Statistical analysis

Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Group
differences were tested using either Mann–Whitney utest or Student’s t-test where applicable. A p-value <0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Results
Three animals had to be excluded from this study according to our predefined exclusion criteria [25]: One animal
(control-IgG group) developed subarachnoid hemorrhage,
as detected by postmortem inspection, two animals (one
control-IgG group, and one NMO-IgG group) did not develop an ischemic MCA territory stroke, most likely due
to inappropriate insertion depth of the occluder. All excluded animals were replaced.
The remaining animals survived and completed the
study protocol. Injections of NMO-IgG and control-IgG
were well tolerated by all animals without overt side
effects.
Twenty-four hours after ischemia and reperfusion, all
animals displayed clinical signs of MCA territory
stroke. Clinical evaluation indicated a trend towards
more severe neurological deficits in NMO-IgG treated
rats (score 42.1 ± 11.1) as compared to control-IgG
treated rats (37.1 ± 10.7). The difference, however, was
not statistically significant (p = 0.391; u-test). Rotarod
test performance was likewise comparable between
both groups (p = 0.450; u-test).

Juenemann et al. BMC Immunology (2015) 16:30

Infarct size, as determined by MRI and corrected for the
space-occupying effect of vasogenic edema formation, was
significantly increased in NMO-IgG treated animals
(27.1% ± 11.1%) as compared to control-IgG treated rats
(14.3% ± 7.2%; p = 0.026; t-test) (Figures 1 and 2). Infarct
size quantification without edema correction revealed
similar results (34.4% ± 16.4% vs. 17.5% ± 9.3%; p = 0.031;
t-test).
A more pronounced midline shift was also detectable
in NMO-IgG treated animals. However, this was not
statistically significant (0.53 mm ± 0.37 mm vs. 0.31 mm ±
0.16 mm; p = 0.174; t-test) (Figure 3).
Quantification of the brain water content by T2-RT
measurement showed different results for the cortex and
the basal ganglia. In basal ganglia regions no significant
difference in T2-RT could be detected (NMO-IgG:
26.4 ms ± 6.1 ms; control-IgG: 22.1 ms ± 9.5 ms; p =
0.328) (Figure 4). Within the cortex, however, NMO-IgG
treatment resulted in a statistically significant increase in
brain water content (19.5 ms ± 9.7 ms) as compared to
rats treated with control-IgG (9.2 ms ± 5.2 ms; p = 0.045;
t-test) (Figure 4).

Discussion
With the present study we show that NMO-IgG has invivo effects in a stroke animal model, and perturbs brain
water homeostasis. Treatment of rats with NMO-IgG
prior to MCA-occlusion almost doubles infarct size and
significantly increases cortical vasogenic edema formation.
A possible explanation for the larger infarct size might
be that the application of immune globulin, per se, reduces
infarct size in the control-IgG treated group. Recently, this
mechanism has been described for intravenous immune
globulin (IvIg), and also that it is mediated by inhibition of

Page 4 of 7

complement [24,30]. Thus, the control group (controlIgG) would benefit from this effect. However, since the
NMO-IgG-fraction contains a normal amount of total
IgG, the protective effects would be present here as well.
AQP4-IgG has recently been identified as a marker for
Neuromyelitis optica, a disorder with demyelination of
optic nerve and cervical spinal cord [14]. In-vitro observations showed that AQP4-IgG is able to induce a rapid
internalization of AQP4 from the cell surface. Since
these water pores are involved in the formation and
elimination of vasogenic brain edema, application of
AQP4-IgG might affect edema formation and brain
swelling in acute ischemic stroke. Unfortunately, injection of this antibody dramatically increased edema formation in our rat stroke model.
Brain swelling due to cerebral edema can be attributed
to both, cytotoxic and vasogenic brain edema, that often
coexist or condition each other [31]. Evidence exists that
the role of APQ4 differs between these two forms
[31,32]. With respect to cytotoxic edema, where ionic
imbalance results in water influx into the cell within minutes after ischemia onset, AQP4 - deficiency seems to
promote edema reduction: AQP4 knock-out mice with
ischemic stroke showed improved neurological outcome
and reduced cerebral edema within the first 24 h after
MCAO. However, compared to our study that included
temporary MCAO for ninety minutes, Manley at al.
chose a rodent model of permanent MCAO for 24 hours.
Further more, the absolute reduction of tissue damage
could not be determined, because the relation of edema
in infarcted and non-infarcted regions was not known
[8]. Vasogenic edema of the extracellular space is ascribed to leakage of a defective blood–brain barrier.
Studies on models of vasogenic brain edema, including

Figure 2 Infarct size. Treatment with NMO-IgG caused a significant
increase in ischemic lesion volume compared to control-IgG (p < 0.05;
expressed in percent of the affected hemisphere).

intraparenchymal fluid infusion, focal cortical freeze
injury and tumor cell implantation in AQP4 knock-out
mice showed increased elevations of intracranial pressure, increased brain water and worse neurological outcome, suggesting that AQP4 facilitates transcellular
water movement and thereby clearance of vasogenic
edema [33].
The promotion of vasogenic edema formation, displayed
by a prolonged T2-RT, in our experiment could explain
the dramatic increase in infarct size in the NMO-IgG
group. Since the space-occupying effect of brain swelling
is known to impair regional cerebral blood flow in the
border zone of the evolving ischemic lesion - particularly
within the cortex - this could explain the increase of lesion
size [24,34,35]. We have previously shown that elimination
of the space-occupying effect of edema formation
(brought about by bilateral craniectomy prior to stroke
onset) can reduce infarct size by 50%. This finding indicates that the space-occupying effect of vasogenic edema
formation might be responsible for half of the ischemic
damage in large territorial stroke [3]. Interestingly, T2-RT
was generally longer in the basal ganglia compared to the
cortex and statistically significant differences in vasogenic

midline-shift as compared to control-IgG (p > 0.05).

Figure 4 Edema formation within the basal ganglia and the
cortex. T2-relaxation time, a parameter that correlates closely with
vasogenic edema formation, was comparable between NMO-IgG
and control-IgG treated animals if measured within the basal
ganglia (p > 0.05). Vasogenic edema formation within the cortex
was significantly increased in animals treated with NMO-IgG as
compared to control-IgG (p < 0.05).

edema were only found in cortical areas (Figure 4).
This finding may be attributed to on one hand worse
vascular collateralization within basal ganglia and on
the other hand to an inhomogeneous distribution of
AQP4 in the brain: A study on cultured astrocytes isolated from rat cortex and striatum reasoned, that AQP4
is expressed at higher levels within the cortex compared to the striatum [36].
Another - or additional - explanation for the neurotoxic effect of AQP4-IgG is related to excitotoxicity
caused by the release of glutamate during the early
phase of the ischemic cascade [18]. Hinson et al. demonstrated that AQP4-IgG impairs glutamate transport by
down-regulating the glutamate transporter EAAT2 along
with the internalization of AQP4 [14,16]. EAAT2 is responsible for about 90% of total glutamate uptake [37].
Up-regulation of EAAT2 has been shown to induce ischemic tolerance in focal cerebral ischemia, and moreover, down-regulation of EAAT2 led to an increased
infarct volume in a rat ischemia-reperfusion model [38].
Glutamate induced excitotoxicity can be further aggravated
by the reversal of glutamate transporters under conditions
of energy failure, i.e. stroke, where the electrochemical
gradient of Na+/K+ collapses due to a decreased availability of ATP and leads to a glutamate efflux from astrocytes [39-41].
Approaches toward an animal model using AQP4-IgG
necessarily involved a break-down of the blood–brain-barrier. Intravenous administration of AQP4-IgG alone did
not exhibit any effects to the so treated animals [20-22].
Only intraventricular application of AQP4-IgG together
with human complement, or treatment of EAE-rats with
AQP4-IgG, was able to produce pathogenic effects in-vivo.
In our model, NMO-IgG induced changes in the brain
edema after an ischemic stroke. This suggests that not

Juenemann et al. BMC Immunology (2015) 16:30

only inflammatory but also ischemic break down of the
blood–brain-barrier results in effective targeting of AQP4IgG.

Conclusion
Taken together, the present study indicates that human
AQP4-IgG strongly influences vasogenic edema formation and infarct size in our MRI-based rat model of focal
cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Unfortunately, the
antibody leads to an increase of edema and infarct size
and is therefore not suitable for clinical application.
However, this animal model is eligible to further study
the properties of AQP4 in ischemic stroke in-vivo.
