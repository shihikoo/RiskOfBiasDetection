Abstract During an ischemic event, the well-regulated
glutamate (Glu) homeostasis is disturbed, which gives rise
to extremely high levels of this excitatory neurotransmitter
in the brain tissues. It was earlier reported that the
administration of oxaloacetate (OxAc) as a Glu scavenger
reduces the Glu level in the brain by enhancing the brainto-blood Glu efflux. Here, we studied the neuroprotective
effect of OxAc administration in a new focal ischemic
model in rats. Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery
resulted in immediate reduction of the somatosensoryevoked responses (SERs), and the amplitudes remained at
the reduced level throughout the whole ischemic period.
On reperfusion, the SERs started to increase, but never
reached the control level. OxAc proved to be protective,
since the amplitudes started to recover even during the
ischemia, and finally fully regained the control level. The
findings of the histological measurements were in accordance with the electrophysiological data. After Fluoro Jade
C staining, significantly fewer labeled cells were detected
in the OxAc-treated group relative to the control. These

Introduction
Cerebrovascular diseases, stroke, and closed head injuries
are prominent among the leading causes of death worldwide. In the past two decades, the rank of stroke among the
top causes of death has not changed. In 2010, one in four
deaths were due to stroke, as compared with one in five in
1990. Thrombolysis is the only possible neuroprotective
solution in the clinic. Glutamate (Glu), the main excitatory
neurotransmitter in the brain, which is released in excess
quantity in the course of an ischemic attack, plays a central
role in the secondary damage (Choi 1988; White et al.
2000; Vesce et al. 2007). Considerable effort has been
devoted to reducing the effects or the level of the excess
neurotoxic Glu in the brain. Most of the developed methods
proved to be effective in animal experiments, with outstanding results from the use of NMDA blockers, for
instance, but unfortunately these methods failed in the
clinical trials (Ginsberg 2008). In the past decade, a number of new and promising approaches have emerged to
decrease the harmful consequences of brain ischemia. One
of the most promising is Glu scavenging, based on the
enhanced outflow of excitotoxic Glu from the brain into the
blood as a consequence of the decreasing blood Glu level
(Gottlieb et al. 2003).

The homeostasis of Glu is a well-regulated process in
the brain. Glu is present in widely ranging concentrations
in the different compartments of the brain Glu homeostasis
system. Under normal conditions, the Glu level is maintained at *1 lM in the brain interstitial fluid and cerebrospinal fluid. Its levels are much higher in the neurons
(*10 mM) and synaptic vesicles (*100 mM) (O’Kane
et al. 1999). During neuronal communication, the Glu
transporters of the nerve terminals and perisynaptic astrocytes are responsible for the removal of Glu from the
synaptic cleft (Danbolt 2001). Moreover, the Glu uptake
from the interstitial fluid is also regulated by the Na?dependent excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs)
present on the brain capillary endothelial cells (Beart and
O’Shea 2007). Under specific physiological and pathological conditions, Glu can pass into the blood stream via the
endothelial cells with the aid of EAATs and facilitative Glu
transporters on the luminal side (Teichberg et al. 2009).
This unidirectional transport can be enhanced by decreasing the blood Glu level. Previous studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of the i.v. administration
of the Glu-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) in the disappearance of the high level of Glu in the brain under pathological conditions (Zlotnik et al. 2007, 2008; Campos
et al., 2011a). This blood-resident enzyme catalyzes the
transformation of Glu and oxaloacetate (OxAc) to 2-aketoglutarate and aspartate. The peripheral application of
OxAc, as GOT cosubstrate, can also be used for Glu
scavenging. The neuroprotective effect of OxAc has previously been demonstrated in focal (Nagy et al. 2009;
Campos et al. 2011a) and global (Marosi et al. 2009)
ischemic models. We recently described a new focal
ischemic model in the rat (Knapp et al. 2013).
The aim of the present work was to investigate the
possible protective effect of the administration of OxAc in
this new focal ischemic model by electrophysiological and
histological methods.

Materials and methods
Animals and Surgery
Male adult Wistar (Charles River) rats weighing 250–300 g
(N = 5 in each group) were used in the experiments. The
animals were given free access to food and water prior to
surgery. All procedures were approved by the Animal Care
Committee of the University and were conducted according to the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki
and Tokyo. Every effort was made to minimize animal
suffering and to reduce the number of animals used in this
study. Experiments were carried out under Nembutal
anesthesia (65 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg/30 min). Body

temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C through the
use of a self-regulating heating pad (TMP 5-b, Supertech,
Budapest, Hungary) and a rectal probe. The surgical procedure, the experimental protocol applied including the
induction of focal ischemia, the electrophysiological
recording and the histological procedures were similar to
those in our previous study (Knapp et al. 2013). Briefly,
craniotomy was performed over the primary somatosensory
cortex, and on the left side, the temporal skull was opened
for preparation of the trunk of the middle cerebral artery
(MCA). To induce ischemia, the MCA was lifted with a
special micromanipulating hook moved by a micromanipulator. The duration of ischemia was adjusted to
2 9 15 min (interrupted by a 30-min reperfusion). The
survival rate was 91 % (10/11 animals).
Experimental Groups and Treatments
OxAc (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) or saline was
administered into the right tail vein during the first 15-min
ischemic period (volume: 1 ml, duration: 15 min, speed:
66.6 ll/min) with the aid of a microinjection pump (CMA/
100, CMA Microdialysis AB, Kista, Sweden). On the basis
of previous studies (Nagy et al. 2010; Campos et al. 2013),
the dose of OxAc was 3.5 mg/100 g. OxAc was solved in
phosphate buffer; the pH was set to 7.4.
Electrophysiology
Somatosensory-evoked responses (SERs) were induced as
described previously (Toldi et al. 1994) and were recorded
(in 5 animals per group) before, during and after the
ischemic period (120 min). Briefly, the trigeminal nerve
was stimulated by electrical stimulation of the whisker pad
(4 V, 0.2 ms, 0.1 Hz) through a bipolar needle electrode
(Toldi et al. 1994; Farkas et al. 2000). The recordings were
made on the surface of the dura with the aid of a silver
electrode. The punctum maximum of the SERs was identified; it was generally localized 3.5 mm behind the bregma
and 5 mm laterally. The amplified responses were processed and averaged with Experimetria Intrasys software
(Experimetria Ltd., Budapest, Hungary). The 30-min control period was followed by 2 9 15-min ischemic episodes
interrupted by a 30-min reperfusion.
Histology
For histological assessment after a 1-day survival period
(following surgery), the animals (N = 10) received an
overdose of urethane, and were perfused transcardially with
0.1 M ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), followed
by 4 % buffered paraformaldehyde. The brains were
removed, and postfixed overnight in paraformaldehyde at

4 °C. Coronal sections (20 lm) were obtained from -2.0 to
-6.0 mm behind the bregma with a vibratome (Leica
VT1000 S, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). In this
work, every tenth 20-lm slice was analyzed in the length of
4 mm (Fig. 2a) from the area supplied by the MCA. The
early changes in neural viability induced by the ischemia and
reperfusion were visualized by means of Fluoro Jade C (FJC)
staining. Cortical FJC-positive cells were counted in the
quadrant (0.25 mm2) of slices in the same position. The
slices were mounted on gelatine-coated slides, then coverslipped with Fluoromount. Fluorescence photomicrographs
were obtained with an Olympus BX51 microscope fitted with
a DP70 digital imaging system. Solvents were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich Co (Munich, Germany).

Statistical Analysis
Electrophysiology
Repeated measurements of SER amplitudes of the control
and OxAc-treated groups were compared separately with
the aid of the non-parametric Related-Samples Friedman’s
Two-Way Analysis of Variance by Ranks.
Histology
Numbers of FJC? cells were compared with the Generalized Linear Mixed Model. During the data analysis, Poisson distribution of the data was considered. The effects of
the different rats were used as nested random effects, and
the different treatments were used as fixed effects in the
mixed effect linear model (IBM SPSS Statistics version
20). A p value of 0.05 was considered significant.

Fig. 1 Changes in SER amplitudes during the short-lasting (15-min)
ischemic periods. In the control group filled square saline was
injected intravenously during the first ischemic event. The maximum
amplitudes in both reperfusion periods were significantly lower than
those in the control period (see the labeled data range). For the
statistical analysis non-parametric Related-Samples Friedman’s TwoWay Analysis of Variance by Ranks model was used. (***p \ 0.001;
v2: 81,61; df: 2; N = 5, SER amplitudes are expressed as the

was administered analogously to the saline treatment of the controls.
The ischemia-reduced amplitudes finally resumed the control level,

difference from the control period. (p = 0,592; v2: 1,05; df: 2; N = 5;

that in the controls. In the OxAc-treated group, the
recovery of the amplitudes was even faster during the
second ischemic event than during the first one. The
increase was already observed within 2 min after the
beginning of the ischemic period.

Results
Electrophysiology
There was an obvious effect of the focal ischemia on the
SERs (Fig. 1). In the control group, the amplitudes of the
SERs decreased immediately at the beginning of the
occlusion of the MCA and remained at the reduced level
throughout the ischemic period. At the beginning of
reperfusion, the amplitudes started to increase, but never
regained the control level. This result was quite similar to
that in our previous work (Knapp et al. 2013). In the other
group, where OxAc was administered during the first
ischemic event, the result was significantly different. The
decreased amplitudes began to recover even during the
ischemia, and finally reached the control level (Fig. 1). The
increase in the SER amplitudes was markedly faster than

As a result of the occlusion of the MCA with a 1-day
survival period, well-outlined FJC-positive cells emerged
throughout the ipsilateral somatosensory cortices supplied
by the MCA. Staining was prominent in the cell membrane
and the cytoplasm (Fig. 2b). The FJC-positive cells were
easily counted since the FJC dye did not penetrate into the
damaged brain parenchyma during the survival period. In
the control group, the average number of labeled cells in
the slices on the given rectangle obtained at from -2 to
-6 mm from the bregma was different from those of
treated group. The OxAc treatment proved to be protective
against the focal cerebral ischemia, since it led to fewer
labeled cells in the same area. Significant difference was
evinced between the control and the treated groups. The
data of cell counts are showed in Box diagrams (Fig. 2c);
the median of the cell numbers was 38 in the control and 6
in the OxAc-treated group.

Discussion
Despite an intensive search for different neuroprotective
strategies and agents against ischemic brain injury, the only
effective treatment is thrombolysis (Ginsberg 2008). From
the early 2000s, attention turned to Glu scavenging
(Gottlieb et al. 2003). This new trend in the field of neuroprotection had the aim of reducing the excess Glu after
ischemia. The procedure is based on decreasing the blood
Glu level, which enhances the brain-to-blood Glu efflux via
the Na?-dependent EAATs and the facilitative Glu transporters present on the abluminal and luminal sides of the
endothelial cells, respectively (Teichberg et al. 2009). An
important factor which supports this process is the huge
number and surface area of the brain capillaries. The
human brain contains approximately 108 capillaries, which
have a surface area of *12 m2 (Bickel et al. 2001). In the
compartment of the blood–brain barrier, the average distance between a capillary and a neuron is *8–20 lm, and
it may therefore be stated that virtually every neuron has its
own capillary in the brain (Pawlik et al. 1981).
The blood-resident GOT is the key enzyme that influences the blood Glu level. Like in case of Glu–pyruvate
transaminase (GPT) and pyruvate, GOT converts Glu into
2-ketoglutarate in presence of oxaloacetate, serving as the
co-substrate for this reaction. The enzymatic activity of
GOT has been reported to be higher than that of GPT both
in rats and in humans (Teichberg 2011). Boyko et al.

123

Cell Mol Neurobiol (2015) 35:17–22

(2012) first described the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of GOT and GPT. They found that
these two enzymes are largely distributed in the central
circulation and their interactions with Glu also take place
there. The explanation of this phenomenon is the low
permeation of GOT and GPT to the peripheral organs.
These enzymes require a several-hour delay before they
can affect the pool of serum Glu. The Glu-lowering property of GOT proved to be more effective in a higher dose,
which is due to the low OxAc level in the blood. They
therefore concluded that a noteworthy neuroprotective
effect against ischemia may be achieved through the
administration of GOT in a higher dose or through coadministration of the co-substrate OxAc.
The neurological outcome after stroke has been demonstrated to depend on the blood level of GOT. Campos
et al. (2011b) concluded that GOT itself can act as a protective factor against Glu-mediated pathophysiological
processes: a high GOT level in the blood resulted in a
better neurological outcome relative to that at a low GOT
level. It has also been reported that migraine patients
exhibit a lower blood GOT activity and a higher blood Glu
level than those in healthy control subjects (Campos et al.
2013). In one interesting study, the long-lasting neuroprotective effects of Glu scavengers against brain-implanted
gliomas were described. Chronic OxAc treatment proved to
reduce the proliferation and invasiveness of the glioma
cells, decreasing the size of the gliomas and prolonging the
survival of rats and mice. The excess Glu in the peritumoral space of a glioma enhance its invasiveness. The
released Glu kills the neighboring cells, thereby providing
an increased space for the occupancy in the brain (Ruban
et al. 2012).
The scavenging reaction detailed above can be achieved
through the i.v. administration of OxAc after an ischemic
event. This promising four-carbon molecule, takes part in
many metabolic and energy-producing pathways in the
body (e.g., the citric acid cycle, gluconeogenesis, and the
urea cycle). It is well known that, as a component of the
citric acid cycle, OxAc plays a pivotal role in ATP production (Campos et al. 2012). Numerous studies have
described the neuroprotective effect of OxAc. It is protective as a Glu scavenger against focal cerebral ischemia
(Campos et al. 2011a) or global hypoperfusion (Marosi
et al. 2009), and also as an antioxidant against excitotoxic
damage (Yamamoto and Mohanan 2003).
The present study revealed the effects of Glu scavenging
on the cortical evoked potentials in our newly developed
focal ischemia model. In the control group, the SER
amplitudes decreased during the ischemic event, and were
not fully restored after it, reaching *60 % of the control
level. As a result of the i.v. injection of OxAc, the reduced
amplitudes started to increase even during the ischemic

Cell Mol Neurobiol (2015) 35:17–22

period and finally regained the control level. This indicates
the rapid changes caused by Glu scavenging. The cortical
function maintained its state following the ischemia. After
a 1-day survival period, a marked difference was detected
between the two groups on the use of FJC dye. In the
treated group, significantly fewer FJC-positive neurons
were counted than in the controls.
In these experiments, our aim was to investigate the
effect of OxAc treatment in our model. Therefore, in order
to reach the most remarkable effectiveness, the treatment
was performed during the ischemic period. Nevertheless, in
the clinical trials, the neuroprotective effect of Glu scavenging also can be achieved during the hours of occurring
Glu excitotoxicity. Our results clearly demonstrate the
neuroprotective effect of OxAc as a Glu scavenger, and the
value of this ischemic model for the investigation of different neuroactive pharmacological agents.
Several promising studies have suggested the advantageous effects of Glu scavengers, and especially OxAc. The
most beneficial properties of this molecule are that its
effects are not mediated through receptor modulation,
while the process is self-contolled (Teichberg et al. 2009)
and occurs naturally in the human body, so that OxAc can
be administered without serious side-effects. Our results
additionally provide new evidence of the neuroprotective
effect of OxAc, which strengthens the view that it may
potentially be applied as a novel neuroprotective agent for
the treatment of ischemic stroke patients in the future.
