Ischemia induces extensive temporal changes in cerebral transcriptome that influences the neurologic outcome after stroke. In addition
to protein-coding RNAs, many classes of noncoding RNAs, including long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs), also undergo changes in the
poststroke brain. We currently evaluated the functional significance of an LncRNA called Fos downstream transcript (FosDT) that is
cogenic with Fos gene. Following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in adult rats, expression of FosDT and Fos was
induced. FosDT knockdown significantly ameliorated the postischemic motor deficits and reduced the infarct volume. Focal ischemia
also increased FosDT binding to chromatin-modifying proteins (CMPs) Sin3a and coREST (corepressors of the transcription factor
REST). Furthermore, FosDT knockdown derepressed REST-downstream genes GRIA2, NF␬B2, and GRIN1 in the postischemic brain.
Thus, FosDT induction and its interactions with REST-associated CMPs, and the resulting regulation of REST-downstream genes might
modulate ischemic brain damage. LncRNAs, such as FosDT, can be therapeutically targeted to minimize poststroke brain damage.

Significance Statement
Mammalian brain is abundantly enriched with long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs). Functional roles of LncRNAs in normal and
pathological states are not yet understood. This study identified that LncRNA FosDT induced after transient focal ischemia
modulates poststroke behavioral deficits and brain damage. These effects of FosDT in part are due to its interactions with
chromatin-modifying proteins Sin3a and coREST (corepressors of the transcription factor REST) and subsequent derepression of
REST-downstream genes GRIA2, NF␬B2, and GRIN1. Therefore, LncRNA-mediated epigenetic remodeling could determine
stroke outcome.

Introduction
Mammalian genomes are replete with thousands of genes that
transcribe long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs; ⬎200 nt in length)
from intergenic or intragenic locations (Xie et al., 2014). LncRNAs are thought to be crucial regulators of genomic imprinting, chromatin remodeling, transcription, and cell cycle, and
their expression is spatially and temporally restricted to cell types
and stages of development (Wapinski and Chang, 2011; Clark

and Blackshaw, 2014; Maass et al., 2014). Although their function
and mechanism of action are not clear, perturbations in LncRNA
expression have been implicated in many diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, heart pathology, and multiple forms of cancer
(Wahlestedt, 2013; Han et al., 2014; Yarmishyn and Kurochkin,
2015).
We recently showed that focal ischemia significantly alters the
expression of many LncRNAs in adult rat brain (Dharap et al.,
2012a). However, the significance of these changes to postischemic outcome is not known. To fill this void, we currently analyzed the role of an LncRNA called Fos downstream transcript
(FosDT) after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) in adult rats. The rationale for selecting FosDT is that:
(1) it was observed to be highly upregulated during the acute
period after focal ischemia (Dharap et al., 2012a); (2) it is cogenic
to Fos gene and rapid induction of Fos after brain injury is a
marker of cellular stress (Shimazu et al., 1994); and (3) it binds
to chromatin-modifying proteins (CMPs) Sin3 transcription

transcription factor (coREST) that are corepressors of the transcription factor REST, which is known to be induced after stroke
(Noh et al., 2012; Dharap et al., 2013). REST plays a crucial role in
apoptosis and cell differentiation during embryogenesis, and regulates neuronal function in the adult brain (Calderone et al.,
2003; Noh et al., 2012; Baldelli and Meldolesi, 2015). REST complex (REST-coREST-Sin3a) has been shown to increase ischemic
brain damage by modulating its downstream genes AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 (GRIA2), NF␬ L chain enhancer of activated B
cells 2 (NF␬B2), and glutamate receptor, ionotropic, N-methyl
D-aspartate 1 (GRIN1) (Calderone et al., 2003; Noh et al., 2012).
We presently evaluated whether FosDT induction is a promoter
of ischemic brain damage and if, yes, its mechanism of action is by
modulating the REST-downstream gene expression.

Materials and Methods
Focal ischemia. All the surgical procedures were approved by the Research
Animal Resources and Care Committee of the University of WisconsinMadison, and the animals were cared for in accordance with the Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services Publication 86-23, revised). All surgeries were performed under isoflurane anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Transient MCAO of 1 h was induced in adult, male,
spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR; 280 –300 g; Charles River) by an
intraluminal suture method as described previously (Dharap et al., 2011,
2012a). Sham-operated rats served as control. Regional cerebral blood
flow and physiological parameters (pH, Pao2, Paco2, hemoglobin, and
blood glucose) were monitored, and rectal temperature was maintained
at 37.0 ⫾ 0.5°C during surgery.

nmol in 6 ␮l buffer ⫹ 2 ␮l invivofectamine) was incubated at room
temperature for 15 min and injected with a Hamilton syringe (1 ␮l/5
min) into cerebral cortex (bregma; ⫺0.2 mm posterior, 3 mm dorsoventral, 4.5 mm lateral) (Paxinos and Watson, 1998).
Motor function and infarct volume estimation. Neurobehavioral deficits were determined by rotarod test, beam walk test, and adhesive
removal test at 1, 3, 5, and 7 d of reperfusion (Schaar et al., 2010;
Nakka et al., 2011). Rats were killed on day 7, and infarct volume was
measured by National Institutes of Health ImageJ software using cresyl violet-stained serial coronal sections (6 sections/rat; 40 ␮m thick
at an interval of 320 ␮m) as described previously (Tureyen et al., 2008;
Dharap et al., 2009; Nakka et al., 2011). Injury volumes were corrected for edema and differential shrinkage using the Swanson formula (Swanson et al., 1990). Animals were randomly assigned to
groups, and behavioral and histological analyses were performed by
an investigator blinded to the study groups.

with real-time PCR using the SYBR Green method as described previously
(Dharap et al., 2009); 18s rRNA was used as an internal control.
Western blotting and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). In brief, tissue
from peri-infarct area was homogenized in buffer containing protease
and phosphatase inhibitors, centrifuged at 14,000 ⫻ g, and the supernatant
(40 ␮g) was electrophoresed, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and
probed with antibodies against REST (1:500; ARP32478P050, Aviva System

LncRNAs are transcribed from the intergenic or intragenic locations of the
genome and are known to modulate transcription, translation, and epigenetics as
they link DNA, histones, and CMPs, either acting as structural scaffolding or directly recruiting factors to chromatin
(Wapinski and Chang, 2011; Wahlestedt,
2013; Clark and Blackshaw, 2014; Maass
et al., 2014). LncRNA levels and function
are known to be significantly altered and
might play critical roles in many diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases,
cardiac hypertrophy, and cancer (Han et
al., 2014; Yarmishyn and Kurochkin,
2015).
Although LncRNA expression profiles
are known to be altered after stroke
(Dharap et al., 2012a), their functional
significance to poststroke outcome is not
known yet. As a proof of principle to show
whether LncRNAs have a role in stroke,
we tested the postischemic histological

able to Ca 2⫹, which elevates to toxic levels in ischemic neurons
(Calderone et al., 2003), and GRIA2 expression determines the
sensitivity of neurons to ischemic insults (Noh et al., 2012). REST
activated after stroke is known to suppress GluR2 expression,
leading to Ca 2⫹ entry and neuronal death (Calderone et al., 2003;
Noh et al., 2012). NF␬B2 gene encodes NF␬B2 p100/p52 protein,
which exhibits I␬B properties due to a cluster of ankyrin repeats
in the C-terminal domains. NF␬B2 p100 mediates cytoplasmic
retention of NF␬B RelA/p65 to prevent its nuclear translocation,
and thus minimizes inflammation and cell death after ischemia
(Schneider et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2005). Hence, RESTmediated repression of NF␬B2 might be a promoter of neuronal
death after ischemia. GRIN1 codes for GluN1 subunit of NMDA
receptor and, together with GluN2 subunit, forms channels that
are responsible for synaptic plasticity (Hasan et al., 2013). The
present study shows that FosDT knockdown derepressed the
REST target genes (GRIA2, NF␬B2, and GRIN1), indicating that
FosDT might play a role in REST-mediated repression by scaffolding coREST and Sin3a. Following global cerebral ischemia,
expression of GRIA2 was shown to be repressed in the hippocampus (Calderone et al., 2003; Noh et al., 2012). However, we presently did not observe altered GRIA2 expression in cerebral cortex
after focal ischemia. These previous studies used a global ischemia model that kills hippocampal neurons, whereas we used a
focal ischemia model that mainly damages cerebral cortex and
striatum. Furthermore, the neuronal death after global ischemia
is apoptosis while a mixture of necrosis and apoptosis occurs after
focal ischemia. Hence, the mechanisms controlled by FosDT
and/or REST might not be exactly same after focal and global
ischemia. It was also suggested that the majority of RESTresponsive gene promoters do not appear to interact with REST
expressed at the physiological levels, yet retain the ability to bind
REST when its expression levels are increased and thus poised for
REST-mediated repression (Bruce et al., 2004). It was further
suggested that these effects are not attributable to an endogenous REST deficiency; however, the presence of multiple RE1
sites might allow repression to occur at different threshold
concentrations or over a greater range of REST concentrations
(Bruce et al., 2004). Furthermore, REST can target various
other genes, including Na⫹/Ca2⫹ exchanger 1 and mu opioid
receptor 1 (Formisano et al., 2007, 2013; Noh et al., 2012).
We presently show that FosDT interacts with coREST and
Sin3a, which are important corepressors of REST. FosDT might
function by guiding these chromatin modifiers to specific
genomic loci (Dharap et al., 2013; Wahlestedt, 2013). However,
future studies are needed to show whether FosDT modulates any
other REST target genes. Interestingly, FosDT knockdown reduced the levels of FosDT and Fos without altering REST,
indicating that FosDT modulates formation of REST protein
complex but does not directly influence REST expression. Both
FosDT knockdown that disrupts REST complex and direct REST
knockdown are neuroprotective after stroke; hence, both manipulations can be used to develop future therapies. A surprising
finding is that FosDT knockdown prevented postischemic Fos
induction. This is not due to Fos knockdown as siRNAs used are
exclusive for FosDT and does not span the overlapping area of the
FosDT and Fos sequences. This indicates that intragenic
LncRNAs, such as FosDT, can modulate the expression of their
host genes.
Overall, this is the first study that shows that an LncRNA has a
functional role in mediating ischemic brain damage. However,
this is only a proof-of-principle mechanistic study that encourages further studies to evaluate the potential of LncRNA-based

therapies for poststroke neuroprotection. As LncRNAs do not
translate any proteins, developing small molecules to modulate their function is difficult. However, siRNAs and synthetic
LncRNA mimics can be used to prevent or increase LncRNA
levels and function, respectively. They can be therapeutically
translated if formulated to deliver peripherally together with
transfection agents that are not toxic. The pharmacodynamics/
pharmacokinetics also need to be tested. To use them for stroke
therapy, preclinical studies are also needed to test the window of
therapeutic opportunity, effect of age, sex, and comorbid conditions to satisfy Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable
criteria (Albers et al., 2011). Overall, the present study shows that
LncRNAs are candidates for developing novel stroke therapies.
