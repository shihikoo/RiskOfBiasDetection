Abstract Accumulating evidence suggests that chronic metformin preconditioning offers potent neuroprotective effects
against ischemic stroke. However, the underlying mechanisms
remain largely unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that chronic preconditioning with metformin conferred
neuroprotection via suppression of nuclear factor kappa B
(NF-κB)-mediated inflammatory pathway. Male Sprague–
Dawley rats were treated with vehicle or metformin (50 mg/kg

daily, i.p.) for 3 weeks and were subjected to permanent
middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). At 24 h (acute
phase) and 96 h (subacute phase) after pMCAO, infarct volume and neurological deficits were evaluated. Meanwhile, the
activity of NF-κB and the levels of its downstream proinflammatory cytokines were detected at 24 h after pMCAO.
Our results showed that chronic metformin preconditioning
significantly reduced infarct volume and improved neurological deficits at 24 and 96 h after pMCAO. It also suppressed
brain NF-κB activity, which was accompanied by a reduction
of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis
factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and induced nitric oxide
synthase in the peri-infarct regions at 24 h after pMCAO.
Moreover, the microgliosis and astrocytosis induced by
pMCAO were also ameliorated by chronic metformin preconditioning. Collectively, the present study provides the first
evidence that suppression of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory
pathway may represent one potential mechanism underlying
the neuroprotection of chronic metformin preconditioning. In
addition, our findings suggest that metformin, a first-line drug
for glycemic control, has a practical clinical use for stroke
prevention and treatment.

Metformin is a first-line drug for glycemic control as it reduces hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic patients without causing weight gain
[1]. Interestingly, accumulating evidence has shown that metformin confers additional benefits on prevention of cerebrovascular diseases, such as ischemic stroke. The results of

376

recent clinical trials show that chronic metformin treatment
markedly decreases the risk of ischemic stroke by actions that
are independent of its glucose-lowering effect [2–4]. Moreover, several animal experimental studies demonstrate that
chronic metformin treatment prior to stroke offers potent
neuroprotective effects that are similar to ischemic preconditioning [5, 6]. However, the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotection of chronic metformin preconditioning remain
largely unknown.
Among several molecular mechanisms contributing to
brain injury induced by ischemic stroke, inflammation plays
a crucial role not only being involved in the pathophysiology
of cerebral ischemia but is also recognized as a major risk
factor for this disease [7]. The inflammatory responses during
the acute phase of ischemic stroke involve activation of transcriptional regulators and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by immune cells [8]. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), a
well-characterized transcriptional regulator involved in inflammation, exists as heterodimers composed of p50 and
p65 subunits in the cytoplasm, binds to its inhibitory proteins
inhibitor of kappa B (IκB-α), and remains inactive under
normal conditions [9]. Upon stimulation, IκB-α is rapidly
phosphorylated and then degraded by the 26S proteasome,
which facilitates p50/p65 heterodimers to translocate into the
nucleus and subsequently regulate the transcription of downstream gene [9, 10], and p65 was considered to function as a
key regulator of either cell death or survival in neuronal cells
[11]. Several lines of evidence have revealed that NF-κB is
activated during acute phase of ischemic stroke and leads to
the release of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines including
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which subsequently
contributes to the inflammatory brain injury [12–16]. Meanwhile, accumulating evidence suggests that inactivation of
NF-κB by specific or nonspecific NF-κB inhibitors could
attenuate inflammatory injury and improve stroke outcome
in rodents [17–19].
Coincidentally, emerging evidence suggested that metformin treatment is able to attenuate inflammatory responses via
suppression of NF-κB-mediated pathway in several peripheral
tissues including lung, liver, adipose, smooth muscle, and
blood vessels [20–24]. In addition to the peripheral tissues,
recent findings suggested that metformin could cross the
blood–brain barrier and ameliorate inflammatory brain injury
in animal models of Huntington’s disease and multiple sclerosis [25–27]. On consideration of the anti-inflammatory
properties of metformin, in the present study, we tested the
possibility that chronic preconditioning with metformin conferred neuroprotection against brain ischemic injury via suppression of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathway. As less
than 2 % of stroke patients are eligible for thrombolytic
treatment within the first 3 h of ischemic stroke onset while
in most stroke patients there is no reperfusion during the first

24 h [12], we adopted the permanent middle cerebral artery
occlusion (pMCAO) model in this study.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (250–280 g) were obtained from
the Experimental Animals Center of Nanjing Medical University. These rats were housed in a standard animal room with a
12-h light/dark cycle and given free access to food and water.
Animal Care and Management Committee of Qingdao Municipal Hospital approved the protocol of this study, and all
efforts were made to minimize the number of animals as well
as their sufferings.
Drugs Administration and Experimental Groups
Metformin hydrochloride was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Inc. Rats were intraperitoneally injected with saline or metformin (50 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks prior to stroke. The
administration route, dose, and duration for metformin were
chosen according to a previous study from McCullough and
colleagues. The detailed experimental protocol was shown in
Fig. 1.
pMCAO
pMCAO was induced using a nylon monofilament as previously described [17, 28, 29]. Briefly, rats were anesthetized
with 10 % chloral hydrate (3.5 mL/kg, i.p.). The right common carotid artery, external carotid artery (ECA), and internal
carotid artery (ICA) were isolated through a neck midline
incision. A nylon filament was inserted from the right ECA
into the lumen of ICA and then advanced to the Circle of
Willis to occlude the origin of the right middle cerebral artery.
The filament remained there until the rat was killed. The
regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was monitored by a
laser-Doppler flow meter (Moor Instruments Inc.), and induction of pMCAO was considered successful if a >80 % reduction in rCBF was observed in the core region of MCA territory
after occlusion. Rats in the sham-operated group were subjected to the filament insertion into the ICA but with no
reduction in rCBF. During the whole procedure, body temperature was closely monitored with a rectal probe and maintained in the range of 37.0±0.5 °C using a heating pad.
Neurobehavioral Testing
At 24 and 96 h after pMCAO, neurobehavioral tests were
performed using a five-point scale by observers who were
blinded to the experimental groups [30]: 0, rats extended both

forelimbs toward the floor when gently suspended 1 m above
the floor and with no other signs of neurological deficit; 1, rats
consistently flexed the forelimb contralateral to pMCAO; 2,
rats circled toward the contralateral side when the tail was
pulled; 3, rats spontaneously circled toward the contralateral
side when allowed to move freely; and 4, no spontaneous
movement with an apparent depressed level of consciousness.
2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium Chloride (TTC) Staining
At 24 and 96 h after pMCAO, TTC staining was conducted to
evaluate the infarct volume by investigators who were blinded
to our experimental groups. Briefly, rats were killed under
deep anesthesia. The brains were removed and then sectioned
coronally into five slices using a rat brain matrix. The slices
were immersed in the dark staining with 2 % TTC for 30 min
and then fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde. The infarct volume was evaluated by Image Pro-Plus 5.1 analysis system
(Media Cybernetics Inc.) using Swanson’s method which
corrects for edema [31].
Western Blot Analysis
Before pMCAO or at 24 h after pMCAO, rats were killed
under deep anesthesia. Brain tissues from the peri-infarct
regions and the corresponding area of sham-operated rats were
homogenized, and the total proteins were extracted by radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (Beyotime
Inc.). Different samples with an equal amount of protein were
separated on 10 % SDS polyacrylamide gels. Then, they were
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked in 5 %
nonfat milk in 1× Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 0.1 %
Tween 20 (1× TBST) at room temperature for 2 h. Membranes
were incubated with the primary antibodies against Ser32phosphorylated IκB-α (1:500, Santa Cruz Inc.), IκB-α
(1:1,000, Santa Cruz Inc.), Ser536 phosphorylated NF-κB
p65 (1:500, Santa Cruz Inc.), total NF-κB p65 (1:1,000, Cell

Signaling Technology Inc.), Thr172 phosphorylated adenosine
monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (1:600;
Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), AMPK (1:800; Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), Iba1 (1:200; Abcam), glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP) (1:200; Abcam), and β-actin (1:500;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes
were rinsed with 1× TBST, and then, they were incubated with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody
(1:10,000, Zhongshan Golden Bridge Inc.) for 2 h at room
temperature. The protein bands were detected with chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Thermo Scientific Inc.) for 5 min at
room temperature after washing and then exposed to X-ray
film (Fujifilm Inc.). The signal intensity of protein bands was
analyzed using Quantity One software 4.6.2 (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) and normalized to a loading control β-actin.
Immunohistochemistry Analysis
At 24 h after pMCAO, rats were deeply anesthetized and
transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution. Afterwards, brains were removed and post-fixed in 4 % PFA
solution overnight. After dehydrated in alcohol, brains were
embedded in paraffin and cut into 4–5-μm sections. Then,
these sections were de-paraffinized, hydrated in distilled water, and treated with 3 % H2O2 for 30 min to remove endogenous peroxidase activity. After washed again with PBS,
sections were blocked with 5 % normal goat serum in 1 %
BSA for 30 min, incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against total NF-κB p65 (1:400, Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) overnight at 4 °C, and then treated with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (Zhongshan Inc.) for 60 min. Immunoreactivity was then detected with diaminobenzidine.
Lastly, sections were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.), dehydrated, mounted on the slides,
and examined with a microscope equipped with a CCD camera. Cells with NF-κB p65 immunoreactivity in the nucleus

378

were counted as NF-κB p65 nuclear positive cells. Cell
counting was performed on five randomly selected nonoverlapping fields in peri-infarct regions per slide by three independent observers who were blinded to the experimental
groups. Data obtained in each field were added together to
make a final data count for each slide and expressed as
percentage of total cell number within the relevant fields.

between two groups in neurobehavioral testing. The mortality
of rats after pMCAO was calculated with the chi-squared
method. Except for mortality and neurobehavioral scores, all
data are expressed as mean±SD. P<0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Quantitative Real-Time PCR

Results

At 24 h after pMCAO, rats were killed under deep anesthesia.
Total RNA in the brain tissues from the peri-infarct regions
and the corresponding area of sham-operated rats was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Inc.). Equal amounts of total
RNA were reverse transcribed in a final volume of 10 μL
using random primers under standard conditions using the
PrimeScript™ RT Master Mix (Takara Bio Inc.) as described
[32, 33]. The reverse transcription reaction was carried out
under the following conditions: 37 °C for 15 min; 85 °C for
5 s; and then held on 4 °C. After that, quantitative real-time
PCR reactions were performed with SYBR® Premix Ex
Taq™ (Takara Bio Inc.) and specific rat primers (see
Table S1 for detail) at a final concentration of 500 nmol/L to
detect TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and iNOS expression according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Meanwhile, GAPDH was
adopted as an internal control, as its expression showed minimal variation in different tissues. Amplification was conducted at 95 °C for 30 s and followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s
and 60 °C for 34 s in the ABI 7500 real-time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems Inc.). The results were analyzed and
expressed as relative mRNA expression of threshold cycle
value, which was then converted to fold changes.

Chronic Metformin Preconditioning Reduces Infarct Volume
and Neurological Deficits at Acute and Subacute Phase
of Ischemic Stroke

ELISA
At 24 h after pMCAO, rats were killed under deep anesthesia.
Brain tissues from the peri-infarct regions and the corresponding area of sham-operated rats were homogenized. The total
proteins were extracted by RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime Inc.)
and then centrifuged at 10,000×g and 4 °C for 15 min to
remove cellular debris. The supernatant was collected and
stored at −80 °C until use. The concentrations of TNF-α, IL1β, IL-6, and iNOS were detected by specific ELISA kits
(R&D Systems Inc.) according to the manuals provided by the
manufacturer.

During the acute phase of ischemic stroke (within 24 h after
pMCAO), a total of five rats died and was excluded from the
study: three rats (15 %) in the vehicle-treated group and two
rats (10 %) in the metformin-treated group. No significant
differences among mortality of each group were found
(P>0.05).
At 24 h (acute phase) and 96 h (subacute phase) after
pMCAO, infarct volume and neurological deficits were measured by TTC staining and Benderson neurobehavioral tests,
respectively. In vehicle-treated rats, extensive infarction in the
right hemisphere was observed at 24 and 96 h after pMCAO
(at 24 h, 24.08±3.45 % of the whole brain; at 96 h, 22.22±
2.32 % of the whole brain). Meanwhile, vehicle-treated rats
exhibited obvious neurological deficits at 24 and 96 h after
pMCAO. As demonstrated in Fig. 2a, chronic metformin
preconditioning significantly reduced infarct volume at 24 h
after pMCAO (18.22±3.72 versus 24.08±3.45 % of the
whole brain, P<0.05). Meanwhile, chronic metformin preconditioning also markedly attenuated neurological deficits at
24 h after pMCAO (Fig. 2b). More importantly, chronic
metformin preconditioning also significantly reduced the infarct volume and neurological deficits at 96 h after pMCAO
(Fig. 2c, d). It is noteworthy that rCBF (Fig. 3a) as well as
physiological parameters (PaCO2, PaO2, blood pressure, and
blood glucose levels, see Table S2 for detail) after pMCAO
were not significantly altered by chronic metformin preconditioning. Moreover, no significant difference in brain lactate
level was noted between vehicle-treated and metformintreated rats at 24 h after pMCAO (Fig. 3b, P>0.05). Taken
together, these results indicated that chronic metformin preconditioning provide a long-lasting neuroprotection without
causing brain lactate accumulation.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by the SPSS software 13.0
as described [34]. Statistically significant differences were
evaluated by one-way ANOVA or an independent sample t
test followed by least significant difference post hoc test.
Mann–Whitney U test was employed for comparisons

[35]. As shown in Fig. 4a–c, at 24 h after pMCAO, the levels
of IκB-α phosphorylated at Ser32 were increased by 4.4-fold
(P<0.05), whereas the total IκB-α levels were markedly
decreased by 43.3 % (P<0.05), implying an activation of
NF-κB at acute phase of ischemic stroke. Additionally, several
lines of evidence indicated that phosphorylation of NF-κB
p65 subunit at Ser536 increased its transcriptional activity
and was considered as a marker of functional activation of
NF-κB [36, 37]. As revealed in Fig. 4a, d, and e, the protein
levels of NF-κB p65 phosphorylated at Ser536 were markedly
elevated by 3.0-fold, which was accompanied by a 2.0-fold

increment in total NF-κB p65 levels (P<0.05), suggesting that
NF-κB was activated in brain. This result was further confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis, as the percentage of
NF-κB p65-positive cells (NF-κB p65 immunoreactivity
predominantly located in the nuclei rather than cytoplasm)
was increased by 2.1-fold in the peri-infarct regions at 24 h
after pMCAO (Fig. 4f, g, P<0.05). The increments in protein
levels of IκB-α phosphorylated at Ser32, NF-κB p65 phosphorylated at Ser536, and total NF-κB p65 as well as the
reduction of total IκB-α in brain at 24 h after pMCAO were
significantly reversed by chronic metformin preconditioning

in the peri-infarct regions at 24 h after pMCAO by 34.80 %
(Fig. 4f, g, P<0.05). It should be noted that chronic metformin

preconditioning did not significantly affect basal NF-κB pathway in brain (Supplementary Fig. S1). Collectively, these
findings indicated that chronic metformin preconditioning
attenuated brain NF-κB activation at the acute phase of ischemic stroke.

Chronic Metformin Preconditioning Inhibits the Release
of Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines in Brain After pMCAO
As demonstrated in Fig. 5, the mRNA levels of NF-κB
downstream genes including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and
iNOS were significantly upregulated by 5.5-fold
(P<0.05), 5.9-fold (P<0.05), 8.7-fold (P<0.05), and 6fold (P<0.05), respectively, in the peri-infarct tissues at
24 h after pMCAO. Meanwhile, consistent with the
changes in transcription levels, a significant increment in
their protein products was also observed in peri-infarct
tissues at 24 h after pMCAO (Fig. 5), implying a NF-κBmediated inflammatory response at the acute phase of
ischemic stroke. As shown in Fig. 5, chronic metformin
preconditioning effectively reduced the mRNA levels of
TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and iNOS by 57 % (P<0.05), 56 %
(P<0.05), 60 % (P<0.05), and 51 % (P<0.05), respectively, at 24 h after pMCAO. Meanwhile, the protein
levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and iNOS were also

significantly decreased by chronic metformin preconditioning (Fig. 6). Taken together, all these results indicated
that chronic metformin preconditioning effectively attenuated NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses at the
acute phase of ischemic stroke.

microglial marker Iba1 as well as the marker for astrocytes GFAP were significantly increased in brain at
24 h after pMCAO, suggesting a microgliosis and
astrocytosis at acute phase of pMCAO. Chronic metformin preconditioning significantly reduced the protein
levels of Iba1 and GFAP by 32.8 % (P < 0.05) and
46.1 % (P < 0.05), respectively, suggesting that the
microgliosis and astrocytosis were markedly ameliorated
(Fig. 7).

Discussion
The major finding of this study is that chronic metformin
preconditioning confers neuroprotection against ischemic injury in a rat model of ischemic stroke. More importantly, we
demonstrate for the first time that this neuroprotective effects
may be achieved by suppression of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathway in brain during the acute phase of ischemic
stroke.
In the current study, we showed that chronic metformin
preconditioning significantly decreased the infarct volume
and ameliorated the neurological deficits in both acute and
subacute phase of ischemic stroke. These findings were supported by previously conducted clinical trials, which showed
that chronic metformin treatment led to a reduced risk of
ischemic stroke [2–4]. Meanwhile, our results were also consistent with previous studies conducted in rodents. In mice, Li
et.al found that chronic metformin preconditioning had a long
neuroprotective effect against focal cerebral ischemia [5]. In
addition, Ashabi and colleagues discovered that chronic metformin pretreatment was able to improve stroke outcome in
the rats with global brain ischemia [6]. More recently, our
group found that acute preconditioning with a subtherapeutic
dose of metformin conferred neuroprotection in a rat model of
ischemic stroke [28].
Accumulating evidence has indicated that inflammation is
an important pathogenic factor in cerebral ischemia [7]. As a
pivot transcriptional regulator of inflammation, NF-κB was
rapidly activated during acute phase of ischemic stroke [38],
and this was further supported by our observations in the
current study. Interestingly, several lines of evidence suggested a detrimental role of NF-κB activation in acute phase
of ischemic stroke, as it led to the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and
iNOS in brain and subsequently resulted in inflammatory
injury in addition to ischemic damage [12, 16, 38]. Meanwhile, inactivation of NF-κB by specific or nonspecific inhibitors leads to a significant reduction in infarct size and a
remarkable improvement in neurological deficits in both transient and permanent cerebral ischemia models [38–40]. Moreover, deletion of NF-κB subunit was found to exert neuroprotective effects in animal model of ischemic stroke [41], implying that attenuating NF-κB activation might represent a
viable therapeutic strategy for acute ischemic stroke. In our
study, we provided the first evidence that chronic metformin
preconditioning blunted the activation of NF-κB during the
acute phase of ischemic stroke. The levels of its downstream
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and
iNOS in brain were also reduced after chronic metformin
preconditioning. All these findings indicated that suppression
of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathway may represent one
mechanism underlying the neuroprotection of chronic metformin preconditioning. Meanwhile, these observations were

383

supported by previous studies conducted in peripheral tissues
including lung, liver, adipose, smooth muscle, and blood
vessels, which showed that chronic metformin treatment is
able to attenuate inflammatory responses via suppression of
NF-κB-mediated pathway under disease conditions and thereby facilitated tissue repair [20–24].
Microgliosis and astrocytosis were considered as a pathological hallmark at acute phase of ischemic stroke [42, 43].
Microgliosis and astrocytosis led to the uncontrolled release of
pro-inflammatory cytokines and subsequently contributed to
the inflammatory brain damage during the first 24 h of ischemic stroke [44, 45]. Interestingly, our study provided the first
evidence that chronic metformin preconditioning significantly
reduced the protein levels of Iba1 and GFAP, the marker of
microglia and astrocytes, respectively. This finding indicated
that microgliosis and astrocytosis induced by ischemic stroke
were ameliorated by chronic metformin preconditioning, and
this might also represent part of the mechanisms underlying
the metformin-mediated neuroprotection. However, the underlying mechanism by which chronic metformin preconditioning modulates microglia and astrocyte activation needs
further investigation.
It should be noted that a recent study from our group
showed that acute metformin preconditioning enhanced cerebral ischemic tolerance by pre-activation of brain AMPK, a
major regulator of cellular energy homeostasis [46]. However,
in the preliminary experiments of this study, we found that
chronic metformin preconditioning did not significantly affect
the activity of AMPK in brain before and at 24 h after
pMCAO (See Supplementary Fig. 2). This interesting observation implied that acute and chronic metformin preconditioning provided neuroprotection against ischemic stroke though
completely different mechanisms. Meanwhile, this finding
also indicated that there might be no crosstalk between AMPK
and NF-κB pathway during chronic metformin
preconditioning.
However, this study also has some limitations. For example, rats were administrated with metformin via intraperitoneal
injection in the current study. When compared with intraperitoneal injection, oral administration may be a more practical
and less invasive route, and it may display a totally different
dose response curve. Hence, future studies are warranted to
determine the efficacy of oral administration of metformin on
stroke outcome.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that chronic metformin preconditioning confers neuroprotection against ischemic
injury in a rat model of ischemic stroke. More importantly, we
show for the first time that this neuroprotective effect was
probably achieved by suppression of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory pathway in brain. Since metformin is widely used for
the treatment of diabetes and obesity and is well tolerated by
patients during chronic administration, it seems that chronic
metformin administration may represent a convenient and

viable strategy for prevention and treatment for ischemic
stroke.
