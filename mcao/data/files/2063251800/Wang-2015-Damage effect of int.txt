INTRODUCTION

Abstract—Interleukin-23/interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23/IL23R) has been implicated in many inﬂammatory diseases.
Previous research mainly focused on its ability to induce
IL-17 production from T cells. However, few studies have
investigated its role in cerebral ischemic injury. The aim of
our study was to explore the potential eﬀect of IL-23 on cells
of the neurovascular unit (NVU) under an oxygen–glucose
deprivation (OGD) condition and the role of IL-23R in
IL-23-mediated eﬀect. OGD of primary cells of the NVU and
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) were
used to produce experimental stroke in vitro and in vivo,
respectively. IL-23 and IL-23R were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot in pMCAO mice. Metabolic viability of cultured cells was assessed by MTT assay. The cellassociated proteins (Bcl-2, AQP4 and ET-1) were determined
by western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA). Immunoﬂuorescence staining and western blot
were used to detect the IL-23R expression. The results
showed that the expression of IL-23/IL-23R was elevated in
pMCAO mice. IL-23 could aggravate neuron damage, astrocyte swelling, and further impair the integrity of blood–brain
barrier induced by OGD. In addition, the eﬀect of IL-23 on
cells of the NVU is mediated by IL-23R and is likely IL-23Rexpression-level dependent. However, there are no such
biological properties for the IL-23p19 subunit alone. Our
study provides the ﬁrst evidence that IL-23 has a toxic eﬀect
on cells of the NVU under OGD stress, which is mediated by
IL-23R. These results not only help us better understand
the role of IL-23/IL-23R in brain ischemia, but also

Stroke is a devastating illness and a cause of death and
disability worldwide. Deprivation of oxygen and glucose
caused by insuﬃcient blood supply results in
dysfunction of the neurovascular unit (NVU), which
mainly consists of neurons, astrocytes, endothelial cells,
and supporting cells, and involves neuronal loss, brain
edema, and blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown
(Shichita et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012). Inﬂammatory
response has been increasingly recognized as a key contributor to the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke. The
cells of the innate immune system such as macrophages
and neutrophils, as well as T lymphocytes of the adaptive
immune system have been found to inﬁltrate in the ischemic penumbra. Once they have been activated by signals
released from the debris of damaged tissue, or the resident immune cells in the brain, these cells start to secrete
pro-inﬂammatory mediators, which aggravate the process
of secondary injury (Iadecola and Anrather, 2011; Macrez
et al., 2011; Shichita et al., 2012).
Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is a heterodimeric cytokine
composed of a unique p19 subunit and a p40 subunit,
which is shared with IL-12. IL-23, mainly secreted by
activated macrophages and dendritic cells, is a growth
factor and inducer of pro-inﬂammatory IL-17-producing
cells, such as CD4+ memory T cells and cdT cells (Cua
et al., 2003; Langrish et al., 2004; Kroenke et al., 2008).
Speciﬁc interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R), a subunit of
the IL-23 receptor complex, plays a critical role in IL-23mediated signaling pathway (Parham et al., 2002). Both
IL-23/IL-23R axis and IL-17-producing cells are critical
players in several autoimmune inﬂammatory diseases,
such as multiple sclerosis, inﬂammatory bowel disease,
and rheumatic arthritis (Langrish et al., 2005; Rong
et al., 2012; Song et al., 2013; Wojkowska et al., 2014).
In addition, IL-17 could potentiate the neuronal death
induced by oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) exposure
directly, and promote the expression of inﬂammatory
mediators that enhanced apoptotic neuronal cell death

and BBB breakdown indirectly (Wang et al., 2009;
Gelderblom et al., 2012; Swardfager et al., 2013).
In our previous study, high levels of IL-23/IL-17 axis
were detected in an experimental stroke model and
downregulating these inducers could ameliorate the
neurological damage (Li et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2013).
Moreover, depletion of the IL-23 gene showed an obviously protective eﬀect in the brain ischemia reperfusion
model, which indicated that IL-23 might be a potent pathogenic factor in the development of stroke (Shichita et al.,
2009; Konoeda et al., 2010). However, the potential role
of IL-23R in brain ischemia remains unknown. In addition,
besides the indirect injury eﬀect on neuronal cells of IL-23
via inducing IL-17, whether IL-23 directly aﬀects brain
cells’ survival or function has not been characterized so
far. In the present study, we investigated the role of IL23/IL-23R in cerebral ischemic injury and the impact of
IL-23 on oxygen–glucose-deprived cells of the NVU.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Male C57/BL6 mice and young adult Wistar rats
(2 months old) were purchased from Peking Vital River
Laboratory Animal Ltd. Three female rats were mated
with one male rat each cage and the pregnant females
were kept individually. The rat pups were used for
further experiments. All eﬀorts were made to minimize
animals’ suﬀering. All animals were bred and maintained
in accordance with the guidelines of the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals published by the National
Institute of Health.
Experimental permanent middle cerebral artery
occlusion (pMCAO) model
Male C57/BL6 mice weighing approximately 25–30 g were
included in the study. The mice were fasted overnight to
prevent gastric reﬂux and aspiration, but were allowed
free access to water. They were placed in a supine
position after anesthetized and a heating lamp was used
to maintain the head temperature at 37 °C. Brieﬂy, the
right common carotid, internal carotid and external
carotid arteries were surgically exposed. The operation
was then performed by inserting a polylysine-coated 6-0
monoﬁlament into the right internal carotid artery, and
gently advanced to occlude the middle cerebral artery as
described before (Gu et al., 2012). Sham-operated mice
were subjected to an identical procedure without occlusion. The brain samples were collected from sham and
pMCAO groups 3 days after their operation.
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining
Brieﬂy, brain tissues were removed from mice 24 h after
pMCAO. The tissues were then sectioned coronally at a
thickness of 2 mm and incubated in 2% TTC (Sigma–
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 20 min at 37 °C.
Images were captured using a digital camera system.
Primary cell cultures
All primary cells were extracted from Wistar rat pups and were
routinely cultured in conditioned incubators (37 °C/5%CO2).

407

Primary cortical neurons were prepared from Wistar
newborn rats (less than 24 h). Brieﬂy, cerebral cortex
was digested by 0.125% trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C, and
the cell suspension was then passed through a 75-lm
pore ﬁlter. Cells were harvested and seeded on poly-Dlysine (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) precoated
plates in Neurobasal Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
USA) containing 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 1%
penicillin–streptomycin,
and
2 mM
L-glutamine.
Experiments were performed on 8 days in vitro (DIV).
Primary astrocytes were extracted from 1–2 days old
Wistar rat pups as described previously with little
modiﬁcations (Saini et al., 2011). Brieﬂy, the cerebral cortex was digested by 0.125% trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C,
and the cell suspension was then passed through a 75lm pore ﬁlter. Cells were seeded in DMEM/F12 medium
containing 10% FBS (NQBB, Australia) and 1% penicillin–
streptomycin. After 7–10 DIV, the cultures were shaken at
37 °C and 260 rpm for 16 h to remove contaminating
microglias and oligodendrocytes. The third passage of
astrocytes was used for the following study.
Primary rat brain microvascular endothelial cell
(BMVEC) cultures were established as described
previously with little improvement (He and Ji, 2008).
Brieﬂy, 7-day-old rat pups were anesthetized. Brain tissues were extracted and homogenized with type II collagenase/DNaseI (Sigma) for 1 h. Microvessels were
separated after density centrifugation in 20%BSA at
4 °C 1000 g/min for 20 min. Microvessels were digested
using collagenase/dispase (Roche Applied Science,
Mannheim, Germany) solution containing DNaseI and
then suspended in DMEM high-glucose medium containing 20% FBS, 10 ng/ml bFGF, 30 U/ml heparin, 2 mM glutamine and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. Cells were then
seeded on gelatin (1%)-coated ﬂasks and the third passage of BMVECs was used in this study.

OGD treatment
OGD model was established in primary cells of the NVU
in vitro. Brieﬂy, the culture medium was replaced by
glucose-free Hank’s solution, and the cells were placed
in an anaerobic chamber that was equilibrated for
30 min with a continuous ﬂux of gas (95%N2/5%CO2).
Cultured cells were incubated at 37 °C for 0.5, 1, 2, 3 or
5 h to perform the time course experiment. Control cells
were incubated in Hank’s solution with 10 mM glucose
in a normoxic incubator for the same period. To
terminate the OGD treatment, cells were returned to
normoxic (95%air/5%CO2) conditions with normal
maintain medium.

IL-23p19 and IL-23 treatment
Recombinant IL-23p19 (Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan) and IL23 (R&D system, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were
dissolved in sterile PBS and added directly to the cell
cultures at concentrations of 10, 100 or 200 ng/ml for
24 h after OGD. Cells cultured in media with PBS under
normoxic conditions were used as control.

Immunohistochemical staining
Paraﬃn-embedded mice brain samples were prepared.
Brieﬂy, tissue sections were treated for 10 min with 3%
H2O2 and then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin
buﬀer for 20 min at room temperature. The sections
were incubated with anti-IL-23 (Bioss, 1:100, China) and
anti-IL-23R (Bioss, 1:100, China) overnight at 4 °C,
rinsed, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with
goat anti-rabbit IgG-biotin. After that, sections were
stained with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride.
Negative control was performed when the primary
antibody was omitted. The images of the pMCAO group
were collected from peri-infarct area of the ipsilateral
brain. The area of interest and the integrated optical
density (IOD) of each section were measured by ImagePro Plus software (Warrendale, USA). The average
IOD/area in IL-23/IL-23R-positive staining in brain
tissues was then analyzed between the sham and
pMCAO groups.
Immunoﬂuorescence staining for IL-23R
Brieﬂy, frozen sections of brain tissues, cultured rat
neurons, astrocytes and endothelial cells were ﬁxed with
4% paraformaldehyde on ice and then the slides were
blocked in 5% goat serum plus 0.1% Triton-X-100 at
room temperature, followed by overnight incubation with
primary anti-IL-23R (Santa Cruz, 1:200, Dallas, USA),
anti-MAP-2 (Abcam, 1:300, Cambridge, MA, USA), antiGFAP (Abcam, 1:300, Cambridge, MA), anti-vWF or
anti-CD31 (Santa Cruz, 1:200, Dallas, USA) at 4 °C.
The secondary antibodies were Alexa-ﬂuor 488conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa-ﬂuor 594conjugated anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen, 1:200, Carlsbad,
USA), and the slides were incubated for 1 h at room
temperature. After washing with PBS, coverslips were
mounted with DAPI ﬂuorescence mounting medium.
Negative staining was performed with the omission of
primary antibody. Images of cell slides were acquired
using a Zeiss LSM confocal system.

Coomassie Brilliant Blue method. Equal amounts
(45 lg) of proteins were separated by 10% SDS–PAGE
and were transferred onto a PVDF membrane. After
blocking in 5% nonfat milk in Tris Buﬀered Saline with
Tween (TBST) at room temperature for 1 h, the
membranes were incubated with the primary antibody of
IL-23 (Bioss, 1:100, China), IL-23R (Santa Cruz, 1:200,
Dallas, USA), Bcl-2 (CST, 1:1000, Boston, MA, USA)
and AQP4 (Bioworld, 1:750, MN, USA) overnight at
4 °C. After washing with TBST, membranes were
incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h.
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
was used as an internal control to determine protein
loading. Bands were quantiﬁed by measuring the band
intensity for each group with AlphaView SA software.
Measurement of ET-1 by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
To detect ET-1 secretion in primary BMVECs
supernatants in response to OGD stress with IL-23p19
or IL-23 treatment, the levels of ET-1 at diﬀerent time
points and diﬀerent concentrations of IL-23p19 or IL-23
in the culture supernatants were measured by a rat ET1 ELISA kit (R&D system) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The plate was read at
450 nm. Standard curve and sample concentrations
were calculated based on the mean of triplicate for each
sample.
Statistics
All values were presented as mean ± SEM. Two-sample
T test was used to analyze the diﬀerence between two
groups of mice. Multiple comparisons against a single
control group were analyzed by a one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by a post hoc Dunnett’s
test. And all pairwise comparisons were performed by a
one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc Student–
Newman–Keuls test. P < 0.05 indicated statistically
signiﬁcant diﬀerences.

Metabolic viability
To assess the eﬀect of IL-23p19 or IL-23 treatment on the
metabolic viability of each cell type, a quantitative
colorimetric MTT assay was employed. Diﬀerent doses
of recombinant IL-23p19 or IL-23 (10, 100, 200 ng/ml)
were added into each cell cultures after OGD treatment.
After 24 h, MTT solution (5 mg/ml, 10 ll/well) was
added, and the cultures were incubated for an additional
4 h at 37 °C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere. Formazan
produced by the cells was dissolved by adding DMSO
(100 ll/well), and subsequently its absorbance was
measured at 490 nm with a microplate reader. These
experiments were replicated at least three times.

RESULTS
TTC staining after pMCAO
pMCAO could induce large cerebral infarctions in the
middle cerebral artery blood supply zone, the basal
ganglia and the cerebral cortex. The mortality rate of
mice 3 days after pMCAO is 30%. The sections were
acquired from brain tissues 24 h after pMCAO and
incubated in 2% TTC for 20 min at 37 °C. The normal
brain tissue stained in red color, while the ischemic
tissue remained unstained (Fig. 1).

Western blot analysis

The expression of IL-23/IL-23R is upregulated in mice
after cerebral ischemia

The methods of Western blot were used to estimate the
expression levels of IL-23/IL-23R and NVU cellassociated proteins. Total protein was harvested and
the protein concentration was determined by the

time-dependent manner (Fig. 3B, C). OGD at 2 h for
neurons, and 5 h for astrocytes and BMVECs were
therefore chosen for subsequent experiments. Metabolic
viability of NVU cells reduced dramatically under certain
periods of OGD (Fig. 4D, P < 0.001). We found that
application of IL-23p19 had no eﬀect on cells of the
NVU under OGD stress in either protein expression
(Fig. 4A–C, P > 0.05) or metabolic viability (Fig. 4D,
P > 0.05).
IL-23 aggravates cells of the NVU injury and alters
cell-associated protein expression levels

sections were acquired from brain tissues 24 h after pMCAO and
incubated in 2% TTC for 20 min. The normal brain tissue stained in

were used to detect IL-23 and IL-23R expression levels.
As shown in Fig. 2, rare positive staining for IL-23 and
IL-23R was observed in brain tissues of the sham
group, while semi-quantitative analysis of IOD of
positive staining indicated there was more IL-23 and
IL-23R expression in the pMCAO group compared to
the sham group (Fig. 2A–D P < 0.05). The result from
western blotting also indicated the expression levels of
IL-23/IL-23R were signiﬁcantly higher in the pMCAO
group than the sham group (Fig. 2E P < 0.001).

IL-23p19 shows no eﬀect on cells of the NVU
We examined whether IL-23p19 had an eﬀect on each
cell type of the NVU under hypoxic microenvironment
with an in vitro OGD model. First, primary cells of the
NVU were exposed to 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 h of OGD and 24 h
of reoxygenation to assess the cell-associated protein
expression. We also detected GAPDH expression levels
together with total protein under speciﬁc OGD/R
conditions in each cell type of the NVU. Quantiﬁcation of
GAPDH expression was performed by optical density
analysis normalized to Ponceau-S total protein. The
results showed no diﬀerences between diﬀerent time
periods of the OGD/R groups and control group
(P > 0.05), and indicated that GAPDH was suitable for
housekeeping protein in this study (data not shown).
Our results showed that the Bcl-2 protein level in
neurons decreased with 1 h of OGD and reduced further
with increases in the OGD period (Fig. 3A). The AQP4
protein level increased in the astrocytes at 3 h of OGD,
and the ET-1 protein level of BMVECs increased at 4 h
of OGD and both the levels increased in a

To determine the eﬀects of IL-23 on cerebral cells, the
metabolic activity of the cell cultures under both normal
conditions and OGD stress was evaluated immediately
24 h after IL-23 treatment via an MTT assay. There was
remarkable reduction in metabolic activity in cells of the
NVU exposed to IL-23 compared to non-treated cells
under OGD, as well as cells that did not undergo OGD
(Fig. 5A–C, P < 0.05 for neurons; P < 0.01 for
astrocytes; P < 0.001 for BMVECs). However, there
were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between 10 ng/ml,
100 ng/ml, or 200 ng/ml IL-23 groups in each cell type
(P > 0.05). Interestingly, unlike neurons and BMVECs,
IL-23 injured astrocytes under normal conditions
(Fig. 5B, P < 0.001). To further explore the role of IL-23
on cells of the NVU, immunoblotting and ELISA were
used to investigate the cell-associated protein
expression level. Bcl-2 protein levels of neurons
decreased (Fig. 6A, B P < 0.01), but AQP4 of
astrocytes (Fig. 6D, E P < 0.01) and ET-1 (Fig. 6G, H
P < 0.05) protein levels of BMVECs increased under
joint IL-23 and OGD compared to OGD exposure alone.
No diﬀerence was found between 10 ng/ml and 100 ng/
ml IL-23 groups in each cell type (P > 0.05).
Expression of IL-23R on cells of the NVU under
ischemic-hypoxic condition
Previously, IL-23R has been detected in CD4+T cells,
macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer cells
(Parham et al., 2002). However, there is no evidence as
to whether neurons, astrocytes and BMVECs could
express IL-23R. To directly address this issue, doubleimmunoﬂuorescence labeling was used to detect IL-23R
expression on each cell type of the NVU in vivo (Fig. 7)
and in vitro (Fig. 8) ischemic model. In Fig. 7, no expression of IL-23R was observed in sham groups, while
increased expression of IL-23R was detected in the
peri-infarct region in MAP-2/GFAP/CD31 positive cells.
As shown in Fig. 8, higher expression of IL-23R could also
be found in the OGD group in each cell type compared to
the control group, which was consistent with the results of
Western blot.
IL-23 upregulates IL-23R expression on cells of the
NVU under OGD stress
To explore if IL-23 could upregulate IL-23R expression
levels. Immunoblotting was used to investigate the
IL-23R expression level under OGD stress with or
without IL-23 treatment. IL-23 treatment could further

DISCUSSION
pMCAO model is widely used in ischemic stroke
research, and has greater clinical relevance compared

to transient MCA occlusion (tMCAO) model (Hossmann,
2006; Perez-Alvarez et al., 2012). The NVU is considered
the fundamental structure aﬀected by cerebrovascular
pathology (Zhang et al., 2012). In this work, we investigated the eﬀect of IL-23 on cells of the NVU via an
OGD model. Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein, exerts a
pro-survival eﬀect in response to a wide range of cytotoxic
stimuli (van Delft and Huang, 2006). AQP4, a water

channel protein, plays an important role in the formation of
brain edema after stroke (Badaut et al., 2002; Zador et al.,
2009). ET-1 exerts a strong vasoconstrictive activity and
could contribute to the BBB breakdown and the pathological process of brain ischemia (Leung et al., 2004; Yeung
et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2013).
Our data conﬁrmed that insuﬃcient oxygen and
glucose could decrease neuronal survivability via the
reduction of Bcl-2 protein expression, induce astrocyte
swelling by upregulating AQP4 protein level, and
increase BBB permeability by elevating ET-1 secretion.
In addition, there was no diﬀerence between IL-23p19
and non-IL-23p19 treatment groups under OGD stress
in both metabolic viability and cell-associated protein
expression. However, as little as 10 ng/ml of IL-23
exhibited a greater cytotoxicity and was suﬃcient to
modify the cell-associated protein expression in NVU
cells under OGD, which raised the question of whether
IL-23p19 showed biological activity in cells of the NVU.
Researchers Birgit Oppmann and Robin Lesley have
previously conﬁrmed, through various bioassays, that
the p19 protein itself was inactive on T cells. Similarly,
the p40 subunit also failed to induce the proliferation of
lymphoblasts. However, both the subunits showed
bioactivity when combined with the p40 and p35
proteins, respectively, which are termed IL-23 and IL-12.
These results could be ascribed to a lack of
dimerization, which is indispensable for the ability to
bind to the matching receptors with suﬃcient aﬃnity
(Foss et al., 1999; Oppmann et al., 2000). Thus, our

results consistently indicate that IL-23p19 alone shows
no bioactive eﬀect on cells of the NVU.
Though our initial attempts to detect the biological
function of p19 itself failed, we discovered that IL-23
had a damaging eﬀect on cells of the NVU. We suggest
that IL-23 could potentiate neuronal injury, astrocyte
swelling, and further impair the integrity of BBB induced
by OGD, which ultimately aggravated cerebral ischemic
injury. However, the results appeared to be the same
for diﬀerent concentrations of IL-23 treatment after OGD
stress. Prior study showed that in the presence of IL-23,
IL-17 production induced by murine spleen cell cultures
was exactly alike in 10 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml and 1000 ng/ml
IL-23 groups (Aggarwal et al., 2003). The following questions then arose: how does IL-23 work? Why is there no
distinction in groups treated with diﬀerent doses of
IL-23? To assess the mechanism of IL-23-mediated
eﬀects on cells of the NVU, IL-23R was detected. In the
previous study, IL-23 was found to be able to upregulate
IL-23R expression in CD4+T cells (Che Mat et al.,
2011). We found ischemic-hypoxic stress could upregulate the IL-23R expression in cells of the NVU, which
was further enhanced by IL-23 treatment. Similar to the
results described above, equal protein levels of IL-23R
were observed in 10 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml IL-23 treatment
groups, which implied that the eﬀect of IL-23 on each cell
type of the NVU was mediated by IL-23R and was likely
IL-23R-expression-level dependent.
However, the results above cannot be taken as
evidence of an IL-23-IL-23R combination. To better

describe the mechanisms of IL-23-IL-23R combination, a
neutralization assay with IL-23R/Fc Chimera or IL-23
neutralizing antibody needs to be further performed.
Unfortunately, there are no such two commercial
reagents currently available for the rat. Besides, the
downstream molecules in the IL-23-mediated signaling
pathway and the role of IL-12Rb1, another subunit of
IL-23 receptor complex, also require exploration in
future research. Notwithstanding its limitations, our
study does suggest that IL-23R plays a crucial role in
the IL-23-mediated eﬀect on cells of the NVU under
OGD conditions. Inhibiting IL-23R expression has
provided therapeutic beneﬁts in many inﬂammatory

diseases. IL-23R deﬁciency mice showed a defective
Th17 response and were resistant to experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Awasthi et al., 2009).
Also, IL-23R deﬁciency prevented the development of
lupus nephritis (Kyttaris et al., 2010). Therefore, based
on our results, we believe that IL-23/IL-23R may prove
to be a novel and potential therapeutic target in stroke
in the future.
We also found that IL-23 at concentrations up to
200 ng/ml had no eﬀect on NVU cells, except
astrocytes, under normoxic conditions, and that this
interesting result could be due to their multiple
functions in the central nervous system (CNS).

Astrocytes are now considered active players in the
complex regulation of the CNS chemokine and
cytokine network. They could secrete and respond to
various immunoregulatory factors (Falsig et al., 2006;
Burns et al., 2012). Therefore, we speculated that astrocytes were activated by IL-23 and released a large
amount of chemokines and cytokines, which further
ampliﬁed the damage. However, more studies are
essential to verify this hypothesis.

CONCLUSION
In summary, we provide evidence that IL-23/IL-23R plays
a critical role in brain ischemic injury. Furthermore, we
demonstrated the toxic eﬀect of IL-23 on cells of the
NVU under OGD condition for the ﬁrst time. IL-23 could
aggravate neuronal injury, astrocyte swelling, and
further impair the integrity of BBB, which is mediated by
IL-23R. However, there are no such biological properties

for the IL-23p19 subunit alone. These results not only help
us better understand the role of IL-23/IL-23R in brain
ischemia, but also provide a potential therapeutic target
in stroke.
