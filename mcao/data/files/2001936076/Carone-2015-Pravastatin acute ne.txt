Pravastatin post-ischemic administration signiﬁcantly prevented MAP-2 immunoreactivity loss
in ischemic areas, increased ERK phosphorylation in the ischemic hemisphere and enhanced
whole-cell antioxidant capacity. Electrophysiological parameters, vascular tone and AKT signaling
were unchanged. In all tested ischemic brains, ZO-1 fragmentation and FITC albumin extravasation was observed, starting 30 min from ischemia onset, indicating loss of BBB integrity.
Our ﬁndings indicate that the rapid anti-ischemic effects of intravascular pravastatin are
highly dependent on BBB increased permeability after stroke.

Introduction

Statins, also known as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarul-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, are a class of
compounds widely prescribed in cholesterol-lowering therapy. They also exert pleiotropic cholesterol-independent
effects, which may prove useful in acute stroke therapy.
Previous pre-clinical studies demonstrated that statins
increase nitric oxide production and availability, promote
activation of survival kinases, modify anti-oxidative pathways via inhibition of NADPH oxidase-derived superoxide,
alter inﬂammatory and immune responses after stroke,
leading to a reduction of lesion volume and an enhancement
of penumbra cerebral perfusion, endothelial function and
behavioral performance (Hong et al., 2006; Cui et al., 2009;
Endres et al., 2004; Yamada et al., 2000; Endres et al., 1998; van
der Most et al., 2009).
These observations identify statins as candidate treatments for acute ischemic stroke. However, further evaluation
in preclinical studies is still needed, especially since lack of
rigorous preclinical investigation is believed to be one of the
main reasons behind the translational failure of neuroprotective drugs in clinical trials (Lapchak et al., 2002; Ginsberg,
2008; Guo and Lo, 2009; Ginsberg, 2009; O'Collins et al., 2006).
In fact, although a recent meta-analysis (1882 animals) on the
efﬁcacy of statins in animal stroke models concluded for an
evidence of neuroprotection (García-Bonilla et al., 2012), an
almost contemporary meta-analysis (472 animals) expressed
more cautious conclusions, suggesting that further preclinical data are required (Baryan et al., 2012).
In the present study we assess and compare the potential
acute protective effect of early pre-ischemic versus postischemic administration of a single intravascular administration of an hydrophilic statin, pravastatin, with particular
regards to BBB permeability changes.
The novelty of our work is that it addresses some controversies linked to the reported neuroprotective effects of statins.
One ﬁrst issue is the actual timing of statin neuroprotective
effects. Although retrospective studies have shown a better
outcome in ischemic stroke patients already in treatment with
statins (Moonis et al., 2005; Elkind et al., 2005), it is still unclear if
this effect is due to chronic treatment or if these drugs hold an
acute/hyperacute action. According to the largest meta-analysis
to date (Ni Chróinín et al., 2013), statin therapy at stroke onset is
associated with improved outcome, but randomized trials of
statin therapy in acute ischemic stroke are still needed. Drug
formulation is another open topic; according to recent animal
studies, parenteral formulations of statins not only are feasible
but may even exert greater neuroprotective effects compared to
oral formulations (Prinz et al., 2008; Endres and Laufs, 2008), yet
satisfactory data on this matter are still lacking. A third
unsettled issue is whether the ability to freely cross the blood
brain barrier (BBB) has any relevance on statins putative
protective action. BBB crossing properties depend on speciﬁc
chemical–physical proprieties, which differ among different
statins. A previous study from our laboratory demonstrated
how the neuroprotective action of a statin intravascularly
administered just before experimental stroke depended on
the lipophilicity of the drug (Beretta et al., 2011), as only

lipophilic statins can normally cross BBB by simple diffusion
(Desager and Horsmans, 1996, Prueksaritanont et al., 2005).
Nonetheless, shortly after onset of focal cerebral ischemia
neurovascular dysfunction is manifested by the disruption of
BBB integrity and function (del Zoppo, Hallenbeck, 2000; Rosell
et al., 2008). Thus ischemic insults lead to an increased
cerebrovascular permeability (del Zoppo and Milner 2006),
which may coincide with the transit of substances that would
not normally be able to access brain parenchyma. Following
these premises, we decided to test pravastatin, both in consideration of previous in vivo evidence of neuroprotective
activity (Berger et al., 2008) and its hydrophilic proprieties,
which make it an ideal drug to be administered intravascularly,
but unable to signiﬁcantly cross BBB in physiological conditions.
Pravastatin dose was chosen in order to correspond to the
maximum concentration of the drug free fraction after
administration of a clinical relevant dose (40 mg) in humans
(Mason et al., 2005).

Results

2.1.

Electrophysiology

The viability of each brain was veriﬁed by evaluating the responses
evoked by lateral olfactory tract (LOT) stimulation. In all experiments, after MCA occlusion, the evoked responses disappeared
and large, persistent negative-going voltage deﬂections were
recorded in PC of the hemisphere ipsilateral to MCA occlusion
(Fig. 1). We will refer to these events as ischemic depressions or
depolarizations (IDs). In untreated brains, the maximal amplitude
of IDs in the PC (IDPC) was 26.175.5 mV (mean7SD) with an onset
time of approximately 2 min after MCA occlusion (Fig. 1).
In comparison with untreated brains, treatment with
pravastatin (100 nM) displayed no signiﬁcant changes in ID
max amplitude, independently from the experimental protocol. Also, treatment with pravastatin did not induce any
modiﬁcations in the vascular tone.

2.2.

Functional and structural assessment of BBB

As shown in Fig. 2A no Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)albumin leakage is present before ischemia induction. After
30 min of ischemia (Fig. 2B) minimal FITC-albumin leakage is
shown, whilst after 90 min reperfusion (Fig. 2C) severe FITCalbumin extravascular leakage was documented indicating a
progressive loss of function of the BBB over time. As shown in
Fig. 2D, zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) immunoreactivity was
preserved before ischemia induction; on the contrary, ZO-1
expression showed a marked fragmentation pattern indicating an early loss of BBB integrity which is already present
after 30 min of ischemia (Fig. 2E,F). The set of experiments
aimed to explore ZO-1 expression in the presence of pravastatin treatment failed to demonstrate any differences compared to untreated brains (Supplementary Fig. 1).

to 3875.2% (mean7SD) mean ratio observed in untreated
brains and 4177.9% (mean7SD) in brains treated with
100 nM pravastatin before the MCA occlusion (Fig. 3C).

untreated or treated with pravastatin (100 nM) following preischemic experimental protocol application. In both conditions, MAP-2 staining was markedly reduced or absent in the
MCA territory, whereas an intense immunostaining was
observed in large dendrites of superﬁcial and deep layer
neurons of neocortex in the control hemisphere and in
non-ischemic regions ipsilateral to the occluded MCA
(Fig. 3A and B). In cortical areas in which IDs occurred and
in other areas supplied by the occluded MCA, MAP-2 staining
was largely absent and was only preserved in the superﬁcial
molecular layers. In deep layers of the PC and neocortex,
dendrite MAP-2 labeling was sparse and was characterized by
clustered chains of immunoreactivity (Fig. 3A and B). MAP-2
immunoreactivity was signiﬁcantly preserved in the hemisphere subject to MCA occlusion in brains treated with
pravastatin following post-ischemic protocol (Fig. 3C). A

The effect of pravastatin on activation of extracellular signal
regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT kinase, was evaluated in the
ischemic brains by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4). A signiﬁcant
increase in the expression of phosphorylated ERK, coupled with
an increased phosphorylated ERK/total ERK ratio, was selectively observed in the ischemic hemisphere of the brains
treated after ischemia with pravastatin, whereas no change
occurred when the brains were untreated or treated following
pre-ischemic protocol (Fig. 4A).
Phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated AKT/total AKT
ratio showed no changes induced by either ischemia or pravastatin treatment under our experimental conditions (Fig. 4B).

2.5.

Total anti-oxidant capacity

Samples from both the contralateral and the ischemic hemisphere treated with pravastatin (100 nM) after inducing
ischemia displayed a signiﬁcant increase in total antioxidant capacity (Fig. 4C) compared to the untreated control
brains and to brains treated before inducing ischemia.

Discussion

Stroke is a devastating disease that shows increasing prevalence
as the population ages and current therapies are far from
optimal. The only approved treatment in the acute phase is
intravenous rtPA, which dissolves the obstructive clot; however
only a small percentage of stroke patients are eligible for this
treatment (Adeoye et al., 2011; Fonarow et al., 2011). Thus
alternative or complementary therapeutic approaches aimed at
providing neuroprotection or expanding the therapeutic window
for thrombolysis, are of great clinical importance. Although
neuroprotection has been validated in experimental stroke,
clinical trials showed that many putative neuroprotective drugs
failed to achieve clinically relevant beneﬁt. Lack of rigorous
preclinical investigation is believed to be one of the reasons to
explain this translational failure (Lapchak et al., 2002; Ginsberg,
2008; Guo and Lo, 2009; Ginsberg, 2009; O'Collins et al., 2006).
Among candidate neuroprotective drugs, statins have been
regarded as one of the more promising treatments for acute
ischemic stroke, exerting a number of pleiotropic effects of
potential anti-ischemic importance. However, despite being

(ZO-1) immunoreactivity in the in vitro isolated guinea pig brain. Before ischemia induction, ZO-1 (D) and MAP2 (A) expression
are preserved while no FITC-albumin extravascular leakage is documentable (A). After 30 min ischemia, there is a consistent
loss of ZO-1 (E, white arrows) and MAP2 (B) expression suggesting loss of tissue and blood brain barrier integrity while FITCalbumin leakage is minimal (B). After 90 min reperfusion, not only Z0-1 (F, white arrows) and MAP2 (C) loss persists, but there
is also severe background staining of FITC-albumin (C) suggesting increased BBB permeability.

extensively studied, some fundamental issues remain
unsolved. In particular, no deﬁnite evidence is available regarding the advantages of an acute intravascular administration,
compared to an oral administration, in term of neuroprotective
efﬁcacy. Another unsettled issue is whether the different BBB
crossing properties among statins have any relevance on their
putative protective action.
Following these premises, the main objective of our study
was to compare the effects of an acute administration of
pravastatin with regards to different levels of BBB permeability. Pravastatin was chosen in consideration of previous
in vivo evidence of neuroprotective activity (Berger et al.,
2008) and its hydrophilic proprieties, which make it an ideal
drug to be administered intravascularly, but unable to signiﬁcantly cross BBB in physiological conditions.
The main difference between the tested protocols was
pravastatin administration timing; in the post ischemic protocol infusion was conducted while BBB was in a far more
permeable state (Fig. 2). Recent studies conducted on animal
models of ischemia have estimated that BBB loss of integrity
starts around 25 min after ischemia and that BBB permeability
increases considerably in the ﬁrst 2 h of reperfusion (Strbian
et al., 2008; Abo-Ramadan et al., 2009; Durukan et al., 2009).
Preliminary experiments and a previous work (Zehendner
et al., 2011) from our laboratory documented an early loss of

tight junction protein ZO-1 immunoreactivity after 30 min of
ischemia and progressive FITC-albumin leakage during reperfusion, conﬁrming these data.
In all experiments, during MCA occlusion it was possible to
record a disappearance of LOT-evoked response immediately
followed by an abrupt ischemic depolarization (ID); gradual
repolarization and reappearance of LOT-evoked response follow the reperfusion of the MCA territory (Pastori et al., 2007,
2008; Breschi et al., 2010). IDs are associated with massive
depolarization of neurons and glial cells. The massive ion
shifts across the cell membranes, followed by cellular swelling
due to intracellular water accumulation (Hossmann, 1996) play
an important role in the development of cerebral ischemic
damage. No differences were observed for pravastatin-treated
brains compared to untreated brains, regardless of the protocol used. These results indicate that pravastatin, unable to
cross BBB, cannot exert a neuroprotective action if administered before the induction of the ischemic lesion; on the other
hand when administered following post ischemic protocol,
there was too little time to exert any effect on ID, which is
almost an immediate phenomena occurring within few minutes after ischemia onset.
Structural lesions induced by transient ischemia have
been previously shown to be reliably designated by a reduction of MAP-2 immunoreactivity (Pastori et al., 2007, 2008).

MAP-2 is a neuronal microtubule protein that is readily
degraded by calcium-dependent proteolytic enzymes induced
by ischemia (Pettigrew et al., 1996). Nonetheless, MAP-2
immunoreactivity loss has been shown to be reversible and
does not invariably indicate cell death (Huh et al., 2003).
Immunohistochemical analysis on brains exposed to postischemic administration of pravastatin demonstrated partial
to complete preservation of MAP-2 staining suggesting that
pravastatin can signiﬁcantly attenuate the histological
response of the brain tissue to ischemia-reperfusion damage,
while this protective effect was not observed in the preischemic administration of pravastatin.
Pravastatin treatment after ischemic injury seemed to stimulate two separate endogenous anti-ischemic defense systems, the survival kinase ERK and the anti-oxidant capacity.
A number of studies indicate that ERK is among the
endogenous pro-survival kinases, which are activated in the
ischemic cerebral cortex that enhance neuronal survival in
hypoxia/ischemia models (Pignataro et al., 2008; Cadet and
Krasnova, 2009, Han and Holtzman, 2000). The activation of

ERK results in the phosphorylation of more than 150 different
substrates. These can be categorized as transcription factors,
protein kinases, protein phosphatases, cytoskeletal proteins,
scaffolding proteins, receptors, signaling molecules, apoptosis-related proteins, as well as other types of proteins (Lu
and Xu 2006). The protective effect of ERK is thought to be
independent on the induction of endothelial nitric oxide
synthase (Hausenloy and Yellon, 2006). Previous studies
showed that statins reduce cerebral edema by upregulating
eNOS (Mariucci et al., 2011), but also activate ERK upstream to
AKT and eNOS activation (Merla et al., 2007). This is consistent with our ﬁndings, which indicate that pravastatin
induces an early phosphorylation of ERK in the ischemic
hemisphere, whereas no phosphorylation of AKT was
detected. Also the absence of changes in total vascular
resistances during pravastatin infusion (Fig. 1) suggests that
nitric oxide production is not increased under our experimental conditions, since previous experiments demonstrated
that our model is sensitive to nitric oxide-dependent vasodilation (de Curtis et al., 1998; Librizzi et al., 2000).

expression by transcriptional repression. ERK can also promote cell survival by upregulating anti-apoptotic molecules
(Mcl-1) via enhancement of their activity or activation of their
transcription (Lu and Xu 2006).
Our ﬁndings of an increase in tissue total anti-oxidant
capacity induced by pravastatin are also consistent with
previous reports of an anti-oxidative effect of statins
(Franzoni et al., 2003).
In our experiments we implemented a model of transient
focal ischemia in the isolated guinea pig brain maintained
in vitro by arterial perfusion. In this preparation, previous
studies from our group demonstrated the structural and
functional preservation of neuronal and vascular compartments as well as the blood brain barrier (de Curtis et al., 1998;
Librizzi et al., 2000, 2001; Mazzetti et al., 2004).
The major advantage of this model is the possibility to
continuously monitor the very early phases of the ischemic
process, through real time collection of vascular tone and electrophysiological data (Pastori et al., 2007; Breschi et al., 2010). This
feature was considered particularly relevant, since our aim was to
analyze the acute-hyperacute effects of an intravascular administration pravastatin. Moreover since the occlusion site is clearly
visible during the procedure it was possible to reliably obtain
complete occlusion and complete recanalization.
One potential disadvantage of this model is represented
by the lack of circulating leukocytes and other plasma factors
involved in an inﬂammatory process. Complex interactions
between microthrombosis, inﬁltrating leukocytes and the

neurovascular unit (recently termed thrombo-inﬂammation)
are a central part of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.
However, inﬂammatory response to ischemic brain lesion is
believed to start only after a few hours following reperfusion
(Dirnagl et al., 1999) and in our setting brain samples were
collected after 90 min. of reperfusion.
Another issue is that our experimental conditions include
moderate hypothermia (32 1C) to achieve the obligatory
requisite to maintain the brain in an anaesthetized state.
Hypothermia is known to act as a powerful neuroprotectant
(Olsen et al., 2003). Still, typical ischemic patterns could be
induced in our experimental model at this temperature
(Pastori et al., 2007, 2008). In line with this evidence, a clear
effect was demonstrated for pravastatin administered following post-ischemic protocol compared to untreated brains and
brains underwent pre-ischemic treatment with pravastatin
under the same hypothermic conditions, suggesting a net
beneﬁt over hypothermia alone and further encouraging the
concept of combination therapy in the treatment of acute
ischemic stroke (Ginsberg, 2003).
In conclusion our ﬁndings provide further evidence that:
(i) an intra-arterial infusion of pravastatin at nanomolar
concentration, starting at the moment of vessel occlusion
(post-ischemic protocol), provides acute protection against
focal brain ischemia/reperfusion injury, assessed using structural and functional measures; paradoxically, no protection
was observed when pravastatin was given 90 min before and
during ischemia (pre-ischemic protocol); (ii) the effects
induced by treatment with pravastatin observed in the postischemic protocol were associated with increased expression
of the survival kinase ERK in the ischemic hemisphere and
enhanced endogenous anti-oxidant capacity of brain tissue;
(iii) these protective effects were not mediated by direct
vasodilatation on cerebral vessels, as demonstrated by the
absence of effect on measurement of vascular resistance to
perfusion; (iv) these acute protective effects require the drug to
enter brain tissue, since they were observed only in the postischemic protocol, when the BBB was permeable to pravastatin
(Saheki et al., 1994). These effects are dependent on BBB
crossing properties, as already shown for simvastatin lactone
versus its hydroxyacid form (Beretta et al., 2011). Thrombolysis
with tPA after stroke has been shown to increase BBB permeability by directly altering the architecture and function of the
neurovascular unit (Polavarapu et al., 2007; Yepes et al., 2009).
Pravastatin may represent an ideal adjuvant agent for combined thrombolytic therapies.

Experimental procedures

4.1.

Isolated guinea pig brain preparation

Experiments were performed on young adult Hartley guinea
pigs (150–200 g), obtained from Charles River (Calco, Italy).
Following anesthesia with intraperitoneal injection of sodium
thiopental (125 mg/kg Farmotal, Pharmacia, Milan), a transcardiac perfusion with a cold oxygenated complex saline solution
(see below; pH 7.1) was performed. Then the brain was isolated
following the standard technique described elsewhere (de
Curtis et al., 1998; Muhlethaler et al., 1993) and transferred to

37

an incubation chamber. A polyethylene cannula was inserted
into the basilar artery to ensure arterial perfusion with a
complex saline solution (composition: NaCl, 126 mM, KCl,
3 mM, KH2PO4, 1.2 mM, MgSO4, 1.3 mM, CaCl2, 2.4 mM, NaHCO3,
26 mM, glucose, 15 mM, 3% dextran M.W.70000), oxygenated
with a 95%O2–5%CO2 gas mixture (pH 7.3). Arterial perfusion at
7 ml/min was provided via a peristaltic pump (Gilson Minipulse,
France). Brain isolation was performed at low temperature
(15 1C) and experiments were carried out at 32 1C. In these
conditions the brain maintains its physiological properties for
several hours (see Muhlethaler et al., 1993; de Curtis et al., 1998;
Librizzi et al., 2000, 2001; Mazzetti et al., 2004). The preservation
and functional viability of the vascular system in this in vitro
preparation allows for a direct perfusion of drugs through the
basilar artery. The experimental protocol was reviewed and
approved by the Committee on Animal Care and Use and by the
Ethics Committee of the Fondazione Istituto Neurologico
“C. Besta”, in accordance with National and International
guidelines on care and use of laboratory animals.

4.2.

Experimental protocol

The experimental protocols are illustrated in Fig. 1. All brains
were left untreated for at least 90 min to reach the target
temperature of 32 1C. Pravastatin (Sigma-Aldrich; 100 nM) after
being dissolved in the same complex saline solution used to
perfuse the brain (see above), was continuously infused for
120 min, at a rate of 7 ml/min, via the resident arterial system
following two different administration protocols:
Pre-ischemic protocol: Pravastatin was infused starting
90 min before ischemia until MCA re-opening (Fig. 1B);
Post-ischemic protocol: Pravastatin administration started
right after ischemia induction until 90 min after MCA
reopening (Fig. 1C).

In humans the maximum concentration (C max) following
an oral administration of 40 mg of Pravastatin is 45–55 ng/ml
(Mason et al., 2005). We aimed to reach a similar concentration
in our experimental setup. A100 nM solution of Pravastatin
(MW 446.51) corresponds to a 45 ng/ml solution of the drug.
To induce focal ischemia, the proximal portion of one of the
MCA was carefully isolated from the surrounding dura and a
loose silk thread knot was prepared around the vessel. The
extremities of the node threads were pulled and the MCA was
transiently occluded in vitro for 30 min; later reperfusion
(90 min) was obtained by removing the silk knot. At the end
of the in vitro experiment, samples of selected cortical tissue
were immediately dissected for biochemical/biomolecular analyses, and the brains were ﬁxed for further immunohistochemical evaluation. Under our experimental conditions, brains were
maintained in vitro for 5 h. Untreated brains followed the same
experimental protocol, without statin infusion

(2–3 MΩ resistance) positioned at multiple sites in the olfactory cortices of both hemispheres. Recordings were performed in the piriform cortex (PC) and in the lateral
olfactory tubercle (lat-OT) ipsilateral to MCA occlusion and
in the PC contralateral to the occluded vessel (control hemisphere). Electrophysiological recordings were performed
before, during and after the occlusion of the MCA. Bipolar
silver stimulating electrode positioned on the lateral olfactory
tract (LOT) was utilized to evoke ﬁeld potentials in olfactory
cortices before, during and after ischemia. Signals were
ampliﬁed via a multichannel differential ampliﬁer (Biomedical Engineering, Thornwood, NY, USA) and were acquired
utilizing software developed by Dr. Vadym Gnatkovsky (Fondazione Istituto Neurologico “C. Besta”, Milan, Italy) in the
laboratory of the Neurological Institute (ELPHO™). Changes in
resistance to arterial perfusion, an indirect measure of vessel
resistance and therefore of vascular tone, was continuously
recorded from the whole-brain vascular system in the isolated guinea pig brain by means of a pressure transducer
inserted between the peristaltic pump and the micro-cannula
in the perfusion line, downstream the ﬁlters and the bubble
trapper (de Curtis et al., 1998; Librizzi et al., 2000). The
changes in vascular tone were measured as increases or
decreases in the resistance to ﬂow opposed by the entire
cerebral arterial system. The variations in vascular resistance
were expressed as voltage changes acquired at 1000 Hz
sampling rate through the National DAQ board and the
ELPHO acquisition software utilized for the electrophysiological recordings.

4.4.

Functional and structural assessment of BBB

The morphological and functional preservation of the BBB in
the isolated guinea pig brain for several hours during in vitro
incubation was previously demonstrated, as shown by the
analysis of the molecular organization of the microvessels and
the endothelial junctional complexes that are primary components of the BBB (Librizzi et al., 2001; Mazzetti et al., 2004). Both
functional and structural integrity of BBB were evaluated
before ischemia induction, after 30 min of ischemia (without
reperfusion) and after 90 of reperfusion. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-albumin (50 mg/10 ml, Sigma-Aldrich) was perfused for 5 min at the end of the experimental protocol before
ﬁxation. BBB permeability was assessed by intraluminal versus
extravascular FITC-albumin signal under ﬂuorescence microscope. For zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) staining the brains were
perfused at the end of the experiment via the basilary artery
with a solution of paraformaldehyde-lysine-periodate (PLP) in
0.1 mol/l phosphate buffer (PB), ph 7.4 for 10 min. Post-ﬁxation
was carried out in PLP for 2 h at RT. Selected free-ﬂoating
vibratome sections were incubated in 0.01 mol/l PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% triton X-100. Sections
were then incubated overnight at 4 1C with anti-ZO-1 primary
antibody (1:400). Then the slices were rinsed in PBS and were
incubated for 2 h at RT in a Dylight™ 594-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (1:600) and, after repeated rinsing, were mounted in
Fluorosave and were examined under a confocal laser scanning microscope. ). A set of experiments (n¼3), aimed to
explore ZO-1 expression in the presence of pravastatin

treatment, was performed by administrating pravastatin following the pre-ischemic protocol.

4.5.

MAP-2 immunohistochemistry

At the end of the electrophysiological experiment, the brain
was ﬁxed by immersion in a cold 4% paraformaldheyde
solution in phosphate buffer (PB 0.1 M, pH 7.4). The day after,
the brain was cut in serial coronal sections (50 mm thick) with a
vibratome (VT 1000 S; Leica Heidelberg, Germany) throughout
its rostro-caudal extension. Slices were immunoreacted for
microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), previously utilized
as an early marker of ischemic damage (Pettigrew et al., 1996;
Pastori et al., 2007, 2008). Free-ﬂoating coronal sections were
pre-incubated for 10 min in 3% H2O2 in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS; pH 7.4) to inactivate endogenous peroxydase, and
then rinsed in PBS. Nonspeciﬁc sites were blocked in PBS
containing 10% normal horse serum (NHS) and 0.2% Triton
X-100. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 1C with
anti-MAP-2 primary antibody (1:1000 MAP-2 clone AP 20, BioOptica, Fremont, CA, USA) diluted in 1% NHS in PBS. Then the
sections were rinsed in PBS and were incubated for 75 min in
monoclonal biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (1:200; Vector
Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA). The avidine-biotin
peroxydase protocol (ABC kit, Vector Labs) was applied, using
3,30-iaminobenzidine tetra hydrochloride (DAB; Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA) as chromogen. After staining sections were
dehydrated, cleared with xylene and cover-slipped with dibutylphthalate xylene (DPX). MAP-2 staining was quantiﬁed by
measuring the optical density (OD) of both control and
ischemic hemispheres of untreated and treated brains.
The difference in the intensity of MAP-2 immunostaining
between the two hemispheres was calculated by comparing
the degree of OD measured in the ischemic hemisphere with
the OD measured in the control hemisphere within the same
slice, by applying the following equation:
ischemic hemisphere OD/control hemisphere OD  100

4.6.

Western blot analysis

Samples of fresh brain tissue from the PC of both control and
ischemic hemispheres were dissected immediately at the end of
MCA reperfusion with a biopsy puncher and were placed in icecold extraction buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM NaF, 20 mM Na4P2O7, 2 mM Na3VO4,
1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate,
1 mM PMSF, protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails).
Samples were immediately sonicated in ice and frozen at
20 1C. Cell extracts (30 μg of proteins for each sample) were
separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked,
incubated with anti-ERK [pTpY185/187] phosphospeciﬁc, ERK,
phospho-AKT (Ser 473), AKT primary antibodies, (1:1000
dilution, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) overnight at 4 1C and then with suitable horseradish peroxydaselinked secondary antibodies. Signals were revealed by chemiluminescence, visualized on X-ray ﬁlm and protein expression was evaluated by imaging densitometer.

Total anti-oxidant capacity assay

Fresh tissue from the PC of both control and ischemic hemispheres was sampled with a biopsy puncher at the end of the
electrophysiological study and placed in ice-cold extraction
buffer, immediately sonicated in ice and frozen at  20 1C.
Total anti-oxidant capacity assay (BioVision, Mountain View,
CA, USA) was performed according to manufacturer instructions. Brieﬂy, samples were diluted 1:20, copper working
solution was added to the sample wells; the plate was
covered and incubated for 90 min. Absorbance at 570 nm
was read by colorimetric plate reader. Anti-oxidant Trolox
equivalent concentrations were determined using a freshly
prepared Trolox standard curve and related to total protein
content assessed using the method of Bradford.

4.8.

Sample size estimate and data analysis

The higher degree of variability applies to MAP-2 immunoreactivity in our animal population, with previous experiments
from our laboratory indicating a standard deviation of approximately 20% in untreated brains. On this basis, we estimated
that a treatment effect by statins is expected to results in a 35%
absolute difference to be considered of interest. For this
difference to become statistically signiﬁcant, a total of 6 animals
per treatment arm should be evaluated with an 80% power
(1-beta) and a 5% level of signiﬁcance (alpha). Experimental
procedure was performed in 31 animals; all consecutive animals in which brains were successfully isolated, connected to
the artiﬁcial circulation, gradually rewarmed and presenting
regular neurophysiological responses were included in this
study: 9 untreated brains, 9 treated with pravastatin following
pre-ischemic protocol and 9 treated with pravastatin following
post-ischemic protocol. 4 brains were excluded due to procedural errors occurred before reaching target temperature. Electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, biomolecular and
biochemical analyses were all performed for every animal
included in the study. Values obtained from electrophysiological measurements, Western blots and biochemical assays were
expressed as mean7SD. The effects of treatments were analyzed by one/two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's test (see
Figure legends). A value of po0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
No blinding was performed. This work was not designed
as an efﬁcacy study assessing the neuroprotective effects of
pravastatin but rather as a pharmacological study focusing
on the dependency between the hyper-acute effects of
pravastatin and its ability to cross the BBB.
