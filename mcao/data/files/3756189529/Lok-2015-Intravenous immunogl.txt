Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) dampens
neuronal toll-like receptor-mediated responses in
ischemia

Abstract
Background: Ischemic stroke causes a high rate of deaths and permanent neurological damage in survivors. Ischemic
stroke triggers the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as high-mobility group box 1
(HMGB1), which activate toll-like receptors (TLRs) and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) in the
affected area, leading to an exaggerated inflammatory response and cell death. Both TLRs and RAGE are transmembrane
pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that have been shown to contribute to ischemic stroke-induced brain injury.
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) preparations obtained by fractionating human blood plasma are increasingly
being used as an effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of several inflammatory diseases. Its use as a potential
therapeutic agent for treatment of stroke has been proposed, but little is known about the direct neuroprotective
mechanisms of IVIg. We therefore investigate whether IVIg exerts its beneficial effects on the outcome of
neuronal injury by modulating HMGB1-induced TLR and RAGE expressions and activations.
Methods: Primary cortical neurons were subjected to glucose deprivation or oxygen and glucose deprivation
conditions and treated with IVIg and recombinant HMGB1. C57/BL6J mice were subjected to middle cerebral
artery occlusion, followed by reperfusion, and IVIg was administered intravenously 3 h after the start of reperfusion.
Expression of TLRs, RAGE and downstream signalling proteins in neurons and brain tissues were evaluated by
immunoblot.
Results: Treatment of cultured neurons with IVIg reduced simulated ischemia-induced TLR2, TLR4, TLR8 and RAGE
expressions, pro-apoptotic caspase-3 cleavage and phosphorylation of the cell death-associated kinases such as
c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) as well as the p65 subunit of nuclear
factor kappa B (NF-κB). These results were recapitulated in an in vivo model of stroke. IVIg treatment also upregulated
the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) in cortical neurons under ischemic conditions. Finally, IVIg
protected neurons against HMGB1-induced neuronal cell death by modulating TLR and RAGE expressions and
signalling pathways.
Conclusions: Taken together, these results provide a rationale for the potential use of IVIg to target inappropriately
activated components of the innate immune system following ischemic stroke.

Background
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are expressed in a variety of
mammalian immune-related cell types and initiate signals
in response to diverse pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [1]. The signalling pathways activated by
the TLRs are broadly classified into MyD88-dependent
and -independent pathways [2]. Upon receptor activation
and interaction with MyD88, one or more of the toll/
interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-containing adapter proteins
are recruited and MyD88 binds with the TIR domain of
the receptor and phosphorylates interleukin-1 receptorassociated kinase 4 (IRAK4), which, in turn, phosphorylates
IRAK1. After being phosphorylated, IRAK1 dissociates
from MyD88 and interacts with TRAF6. TRAF6 forms
a complex that activates downstream signalling of TLRs
[1]. Major downstream signalling pathways activated by
TLR engagement include the nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such
as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK cascades.
The MyD88-independent pathway signals through the
adaptor TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon (IFN)-β-mediated transcription factor
(TRIF) [1]. TRIF interacts with TRAF3 leading to the
recruitment and activation of tumour necrosis factor
(TNF) receptor-associated factor-family member-associated
NF-κB activator-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor of
nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit epsilon (IKKε). This
culminates in interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation that facilitates IRF3 dimerization and translocation into the nucleus and transcriptional regulation.
In relation to cerebral ischemia, it has been shown that
disruption of downstream MyD88-independent (TRIF)
TLR pathway does not confer protection in in vitro and
in vivo models of cerebral ischemia [3]. A variety of endogenous ligands, such as high-mobility group box 1
(HMGB1), also bind to TLR and activate several intracellular inflammatory pathways, including the NF-κB, JNK
and p38 MAPK pathways [4,5]. The presence of several
TLRs has been reported in the brain, both in glial and
neuronal cells [6-9], and recent studies have reported the
pathological roles of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR8 in ischemic
stroke-induced brain injury [7,9-12]. Neurons were found
to express TLR2, TLR4 and TLR8 under both physiological and pathological conditions, and cortical neuronal

cultures from both TLR2 and TLR4 deficient mice were
protected against cell death induced by energy deprivation
(an in vitro model of ischemic stroke) when compared
with wild type [7]. Furthermore, we have recently provided
evidence that neuronal TLR8 signalling plays a detrimental
role by triggering post-stroke inflammation and neuronal
cell death [9].
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is an FDA-approved
therapeutic modality used for various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases [13]. Recently, we demonstrated that
IVIg treatment significantly reduced brain infarct volume
and mortality in an experimental mouse model of ischemic
stroke [14,15]. IVIg has also been shown to inhibit complement activation, modulate cytokine production, reduce
endothelial dysfunction and death, reduce activation and
infiltration of leukocytes, as well as inhibit neuronal apoptosis by decreasing the cleavage of caspase-3 in primary
cortical neurons subjected to ischemic insults [14,15]. It
was recently shown that IVIg may modulate TLR9 expression and activation in pathological conditions such as
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), suggesting a new
additional mechanism of IVIg [16]. IVIg has also been
shown to modulate the maturation of TLR-primed peripheral blood monocytes [17]. In addition, IVIg suppresses
TLR4-induced cytokine production induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by inhibiting the NF-κB, JNK and p38
MAPK pathways in human monocytic cells [18]. IVIg also
attenuates multiple cell death pathways by decreasing the
phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, JNK, p38
MAPK and c-Jun, in simulated ischemic condition [15].
However, relatively little is known about the role of IVIg
in modulating the expression and activation of TLRs and
endogenous ligand-mediated TLR activation following ischemic stroke. Here, we provide the first evidence that
IVIg protects neurons by decreasing the expression and
activation of TLRs and by suppressing HMGB1-mediated
TLR activation. Our findings further support IVIg as a potential therapeutic modality for targeting ischemic strokeinduced neuronal cell death and brain injury.

embryos, as previously described [19]. Experiments were
performed in 7- to 9-day-old cultures. Approximately
95% of the cells in such cultures were neurons, and the
remaining cells were astrocytes.
Glucose deprivation and combined oxygen-glucose
deprivation

For glucose deprivation (GD) studies, glucose-free Locke’s
buffer containing: 154 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM KCl, 2.3 mM
CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 3.6 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM HEPES,
pH 7.2, supplemented with gentamicin (5 mg/L) was used.
The cultured neurons were incubated in glucose-free
Locke’s buffer for up to 24 h. For combined oxygen and
glucose deprivation (OGD) studies, neurons were incubated
in glucose-free Locke’s buffer in an oxygen-free chamber
for 4.5, 6 or 12 h. To observe the effect of IVIg, IVIg
(KIOVIG, Baxter) was added at the reported concentrations to the cultures during GD or OGD conditions.
The active ingredient in KIOVIG is a human plasmaderived immunoglobulin, concentration of 100 mg/mL
(10% w/v), produced from large pools of human plasma
by a modified Cohn-Oncley cold ethanol fractionation,
yielding an intermediate immunoglobulin G, referred to
as precipitate G. Equal concentration of glycine (Sigma
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), an amino acid with no
known affinity for any cell receptors, was also included
in the experiments as vehicle control for IVIg. To observe the effect of HMGB1, mouse recombinant HMGB1
(Source: E. coli expressed amino acids Met1-Glu215 of
mouse HMGB-1 accession # NM_010439; purity: >98%;
endotoxin: less than 0.01 ng/μg cytokine) (34-8401,
eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) was added either alone
or simultaneously with IVIg to the OGD-treated neuronal
cultures.
Western blot analysis

Protein samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphatepolyacrylamide (7.5% or 10%) gel electrophoresis using a
Tris-glycine running buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
Gels were then electro-blotted using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad) in transfer buffer containing 0.025 mol/L
Tris base, 0.15 mol/L glycine and 10% (v/v) methanol for
1.5 h at 350 mA onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad).

The membranes were then incubated in blocking buffer [5%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) or 5% non-fat milk in TBS-T
(20 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mmol/L NaCl, 0.2%
Tween-20)] for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes
were then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies including those that selectively bind TLR2 (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK), TLR4 (Abcam), TLR8 (Abcam), RAGE
(Abcam), MyD88 (Abcam), TRAF6 (Abcam), p-JNK (Cell
Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), p-p38 MAPK (Cell Signaling), p-p65 (Cell Signaling), p-c-Jun (Cell Signaling),
Bcl-2 (Cell Signaling), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling),
HMGB1 (Cell Signaling) and β-actin (Sigma Aldrich).
After washing three times (10 min per wash) with TBST, the membranes were incubated with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at
room temperature. The membranes were then washed
again with TBS-T and incubated with chemiluminescent
substrate for enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 5 min. The signals were
visualized by exposing the membranes onto X-ray films
(Fujifilm Corporation, Minato, Tokyo, Japan).
Middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion

12- to 14-week-old C57BL/6 J male mice were used for
in vivo experiments. The focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
(I/R) model was similar to that described previously [20].
Briefly, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, a
midline incision was made in the neck, and the left external carotid and pterygopalatine arteries were isolated
and ligated with 6-0 silk thread. The internal carotid artery
(ICA) was occluded at the peripheral site of the bifurcation of the ICA and the pterygopalatine artery using
a small clip, and the common carotid artery (CCA) was
ligated with 6-0 silk thread. The external carotid artery
(ECA) was cut, and a 6-0 nylon monofilament with a
blunted tip (0.2 to 0.22 mm) with a coagulator was inserted
into the ECA. After the clip at the ICA was removed, the
nylon monofilament was advanced into the origin of the
middle cerebral artery (MCA) until light resistance was felt.
The nylon monofilament and the CCA ligature were removed after 1 h of occlusion to initiate reperfusion. In the
sham-operated group, these arteries were visualized but
not disturbed. Mice were administered with 1 g/kg body

weight of IVIg or vehicle by infusion into the femoral vein
(approximately 250 μL) 3 h after the start of reperfusion
period. Cerebral blood flow was measured by placing the
animal’s head in a fixed frame after it had been anesthetized
and prepared for surgery. A craniotomy was performed to
access the left middle cerebral artery and was extended to
allow positioning of a 0.5-mm Doppler probe (Moor LAB,
Moor Instruments, Devon, UK) over the underlying parietal
cortex approximately 1 mm posterior to the bregma and
1 mm lateral to the midline. The animals were included in
the study if they underwent successful MCA occlusion, defined by an 80% or greater drop in cerebral blood flow seen
with laser Doppler flowmetry. The animals were excluded if
insertion of the thread resulted in perforation of the vessel
wall determined by the presence of sub-arachnoid blood at
the time of sacrifice. University of Queensland Animal
Care and Use Committee approved all in vivo experimental procedures.
Statistical analysis

All numerical values are expressed as mean ± SEM. The
overall significance of the data was examined by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Newman-Keuls
post hoc test to determine group differences. Statistical difference was considered as P < 0.05 throughout the study.
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism
software.

Results
IVIg treatment reduces expression and activation of TLRs
in primary cortical neurons subjected to GD and OGD
conditions

We first evaluated the effect of IVIg on the protein expressions of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR8 in a cell culture model of
ischemic neuronal injury in which primary mouse cortical
neurons were subjected to conditions mimicking ischemic
stroke, including glucose deprivation (GD) and combined
oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) (Figure 1). We
have previously shown that low concentrations (0.1 and
0.3 mg/ml) of IVIg significantly increased in vitro ischemic

stress-induced neuronal cell death whereas high concentrations (5 and 10 mg/ml) of IVIg significantly decreased
GD-induced neuronal cell death [15]. Therefore, we used
5 and 10 mg/ml in this study to test the effect of IVIg
against TLR expression and activation. Immunoblot analyses showed that treatment with IVIg (5 and 10 mg/ml)
significantly prevented GD-induced increased expressions of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR8 following 6, 12 and 24 h
(Figure 1A-D). Treatment with IVIg (5 and 10 mg/ml)
also significantly prevented 6 and 12 h OGD-induced increased neuronal expressions of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR8
(Figure 1E-H). We next analysed the effect of IVIg on the
expression levels of myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88) (MyD88) and TNF receptor-associated
factor 6 (TRAF6) following GD and OGD conditions.
Both of these proteins are involved in the downstream
signalling of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR8. Our immunoblot
analyses showed that GD- and OGD-induced upregulation of MyD88 and TRAF6 levels at different time
points was significantly prevented by IVIg treatment
(Figure 2A-F).
IVIg modulates neuronal NF-κB and MAPK activities and
protects neurons against apoptotic cell death following
simulated ischemic condition

Because the activation of NF-κB, JNK and p38 MAPK
pathways are implicated in TLR2, TLR4 and TLR8 signalling and ischemia-induced neuronal cell death [10,21],
we next measured the protein levels of phosphorylated
p65 (a subunit of NF-κB), JNK, p38 MAPK and c-Jun
following GD and OGD in IVIg-treated neurons compared with control neurons. Treatment with both 5 and
10 mg/ml of IVIg significantly attenuated the expression level of the phosphorylated forms of NF-κB p65
(Figure 3A,B), JNK, p38 MAPK and c-Jun following 6,
12 and 24 h of GD when compared to the vehicletreated group (Figure 3A,C-E). We also measured the
levels of these proteins under OGD conditions. Immunoblot analyses showed that IVIg treatments attenuated the
expression level of the phosphorylated forms of NF-κB

p65, JNK, p38 MAPK and c-Jun following 6 and 12 h
of OGD, however statistical significance was not
reached for the expression level of phosphorylated cJun in neurons treated with 5 mg/ml of IVIg following
6 h of OGD (Figure 3F-J). Consistent with our previous findings, the immunoblot results showed that IVIg
treatment significantly prevented an increased expression of cleaved caspase-3 and significantly increased
the expression of Bcl-2 in primary cortical neurons
following 6, 12 and 24 h of GD (Figure 4A-C). Similarly,

we have also observed that IVIg treatment significantly prevented an increased expression of cleaved
caspase-3 and significantly prevented a decreased expression of Bcl-2 in OGD 6- and 12-h-treated neurons
(Figure 4D-F). These results not only confirm our previously published data following GD conditions but
also show for the first time that IVIg can protect neurons following OGD conditions by downregulating
apoptosis and upregulating the anti-apoptotic protein,
Bcl-2.

IVIg reduces the expression and activation of TLRs as well
as NF-κB and MAPK activities in vivo following stroke

We previously reported that pre- and post-treatment with
IVIg reduced brain damage and neurological deficits after
cerebral I/R in mice [14]. However, we do not know if the
IVIg-mediated protective effect in vivo is partly achieved
by modulating TLR expression and activation. Therefore,
we next analysed the expression of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR8
in vivo following cerebral I/R injury. Our data showed that
6 and 24 h of cerebral I/R-induced increased expressions
of TL2, TLR4 and TLR8 were significantly prevented by
post-treatment with 1 g/kg body weight of IVIg 3 h after
the onset of reperfusion (Figure 5A-D). We next analysed
the expression levels of TLR adaptor and signalling proteins, MyD88 and TRAF6 following cerebral I/R. Similar
to the in vitro findings, we observed that 3-h post-treatment
with 1 g/kg of IVIg significantly prevented an increased expression level of MyD88 following 6- and 24-h cerebral I/R
injury (Figure 5A,E). A 1 g/kg of IVIg treatment significantly
prevented an increased expression level of TRAF6 following
6-h cerebral I/R injury, however statistical significance was
not reached following 24-h cerebral I/R injury (Figure 5A,F).
We next analysed the activity of TLR downstream signalling
proteins such as NF-κB and MAPKs in vivo following
cerebral I/R injury. IVIg treatment significantly prevented
an increased expression level of phosphorylated NF-κB
p65 (Figure 6A,B), JNK, p38 MAPK and c-Jun following
6- and 24-h cerebral I/R as compared with control group
(Figure 6A,C-E). Immunoblot analyses showed that IVIg
treatment significantly prevented a decreased level of
Bcl-2 following both 6- and 24-h cerebral I/R as compared
with control group (Figure 6F,G).
IVIg protects neurons against HMGB1-induced cell death
by modulating TLR signalling

High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear protein
and has different roles, both intracellularly and extracellularly. Nuclear HMGB1 regulates chromatin structure
and gene transcription whereas extracellular HMGB1 has
shown to bind to receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) and the TLRs [22,23]. In order to investigate the effect of IVIg against HMGB1-mediated TLR

signalling in neurons following OGD, we first determined
the effective concentration of mouse recombinant HMGB1.
Our data showed that HMGB1 above 50 ng/ml was capable
of significantly increasing neuronal cleavage of caspase-3
after 4.5 h of OGD (Figure 7A,B). We next analysed the
effect of IVIg against HMGB1-mediated TLR expression
following OGD. Our data showed that both TLR2 and
TLR4 expression levels were significantly increased following HMGB1 treatment when compared to OGD alone
(Figure 7C-E). Furthermore, HMGB1-induced increase
in TLR2 and TLR4 expressions was significantly prevented
by 10 mg/ml of IVIg treatment (Figure 7C-E). Similarly,
the levels of MyD88 and TRAF6 were significantly increased with the addition of HMGB1 to OGD cultures
and IVIg significantly prevented HMGB1-induced increase in MyD88 and TRAF6 following OGD condition
(Figure 7F-H). Next, we analysed HMGB1-mediated TLR
signalling pathways following IVIg treatment. Our data
showed that the levels of NF-κB-p-p65, p-JNK, p38 MAPK
and p-c-Jun expressions were significantly increased
following HMGB1 treatment when compared to OGD
alone (Figure 8A-F). IVIg significantly prevented HMGB1induced increases of these proteins following OGD condition (Figure 8A-F). In addition, our data showed that
OGD-induced cleaved caspase-3 level was significantly
increased in the presence of HMGB1 and this increase was
significantly prevented with IVIg treatment (Figure 8G,H).
Furthermore, the decreased expression level of Bcl-2 was
also prevented by IVIg treatment following HMGB1 treatment (Figure 8G,I). Finally, we analysed the total cellular
HMGB1 and RAGE expression levels. Our data showed
that IVIg treatment resulted in preserving HMGB1 level
(Figure 8J,K). Similar to TLRs, RAGE expression level was
significantly increased following HMGB1 treatments compared to OGD alone (Figure 8J,L) and HMGB1-induced increase in RAGE expression was significantly prevented by
10 mg/ml of IVIg treatment (Figure 8J,L).

Discussion
IVIg therapy has been shown to be effective in the treatment of various inflammatory and autoimmune disorders
[24]. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain

expression. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. n = 5 cultures. +P < 0.05 in comparison with OGD 4.5-h group; *P < 0.05 in comparison with

these beneficial effects of IVIg such as attenuating the activity of complement system, the expression of adhesion
molecules, the expression and activation of inflammasome
pathways and cytokine production [14,25,26]. IVIg acts
also by dampening pro-inflammatory and apoptotic gene
expressions [15,27]. We and others have previously
demonstrated that IVIg treatment reduced brain damage, neurological deficit and mortality in experimental
rodent models of stroke [14,15,28]. The current study
reveals that a reduction in TLR expression and activation partly accounts for the protective effect of IVIg
against neuronal cell death following ischemic stroke.
The data indicate that IVIg reduces the expression
levels of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR8 and dampens downstream signalling cascades associated with TLRs such
as the NF-κB and MAPKs pathways. Furthermore, our
data show that IVIg is also targeting HMGB1-mediated
TLR signalling in OGD-injured neurons.
Numerous studies have reported pathological roles of
TLRs and RAGE in ischemic stroke-induced brain injury
[7,9,23]. We previously reported that neurons express several TLRs, and that the levels of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR8
are increased in neurons in response to ischemic conditions [7,9]. Neurons from both TLR2 knockout and TLR4deficient mice were protected against ischemia, and the
amount of brain damage and neurological deficits caused
by a stroke were significantly lesser in mice deficient in
TLR2 or TLR4 compared with control mice [7]. High
concentrations of IVIg prevent neuronal death, but the
neuroprotective mechanism is not well established. Recent studies have indicated that IVIg may attenuate the
expression and activation of TLR9 in B cells from SLE
patients, suggesting a novel additional mechanism of IVIg
[1]. Another recent study showed that IVIg and F(ab)2
fragments of IVIg that lacks the Fc region inhibit TLR4mediated activation of dendritic cells [29]. Our data reveals
that treatment with IVIg significantly prevented ischemiainduced increased neuronal expressions of TLR2, TLR4
and TLR8. In addition, we have also found that ischemia-

induced increased expressions of TLR adaptor and signalling proteins such as MyD88 and TRAF6 were prevented
by IVIg treatment. These expression data indicate that IVIg
may exert its beneficial effect by modulating the expression
and activation of neuronal TLR2, TLR4 and TLR8.
It is well established that the activation of NF-κB, JNK
and p38 MAPK pathways are implicated in TLR2, TLR4
and TLR8 signalling [2,30]. Our data show that IVIg treatments significantly attenuated the expression level of the
phosphorylated forms of NF-κB p65, JNK, p38 MAPK and
c-Jun in neurons following ischemic conditions. It is well
known that NF-κB is a regulator of neuronal apoptosis in
cerebral ischemia [31]. Similarly, p38 MAPK, JNK and
c-Jun are known to contribute to neuronal cell death
following ischemic condition [32]. Our data has shown
that IVIg not only prevented ischemia-induced increased
expression levels of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR8 and attenuated
its signalling cascades but also ischemia-induced cleavage
of apoptotic protease caspase-3.
Our data further suggests that IVIg protects neurons
by modulating TLR expression and activation in vitro are
also true for in vivo. We have previously reported that IVIg
treatment reduces brain damage and improves neurological deficits after cerebral I/R injury [14]. In addition, we
have shown that IVIg reduces ischemic stroke-induced
infiltration of leukocytes and protects against endothelial dysfunction [27]. We also found evidence that the
neuroprotective effects of IVIg are associated with a significant reduction in the levels of NLRP inflammasome
proteins as well as precursors of both IL-1β and IL-18 in a
mouse model of focal ischemic stroke [26]. Here, we show
that the increased expression levels of TLR2, TLR4 and
TLR8, adaptor protein MyD88, signalling protein TRAF6,
TLR downstream signalling proteins such as NF-κB and
MAPKs were significantly prevented in IVIg-treated animals compared to control animals following stroke.
The receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE)
is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is located on the plasma membrane and activated by a variety of

Lok et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2015) 12:73

ligands, including advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs)
and HMGB1 [22,23]. Similar to the TLRs, ligand binding to
RAGE leads to the activation of several intracellular inflammatory pathways, including NF-κB, JNK and p38 MAPK
[33]. We have recently shown that RAGE-deficient mice
were protected from ischemic stroke and HMGB1 promotes
stroke-induced neuronal cell death by activating signalling
cascades associated with RAGE and TLR activation [23]. Experimental evidence suggests that HMGB1 is released in
large amounts into the extracellular space immediately
after an ischemic brain insult and subsequently induces
an inflammatory reaction via the activation of the TLRs
and RAGE in affected brain tissues [23]. We have also
demonstrated that recombinant soluble RAGE (sRAGE),
acting as a decoy receptor for HMGB1, significantly reduced the infiltration of immune cells and improved the
outcome of injury in mice subjected to I/R as well as protecting cultured neurons against ischemic cell death [23].
Our current data show that HMGB1 treatment increases
TLR2, TLR4 and RAGE expression levels, and IVIg significantly prevented HMGB1-induced increases of these
proteins. Similarly, HMGB1-induced MyD88 and TRAF6
expressions were also significantly prevented with IVIg treatment. Furthermore, IVIg significantly prevented HMGB1induced increases of TLR/RAGE signalling cascade proteins
such as NF-κB-p-p65, p-JNK, p-p38 MAPK and p-c-Jun.

Conclusions
Our data establish that IVIg targets expression and activation of TLR and RAGE pathway components as well
as protecting neurons against HMGB1-mediated neuronal
cell death in ischemic stroke.
