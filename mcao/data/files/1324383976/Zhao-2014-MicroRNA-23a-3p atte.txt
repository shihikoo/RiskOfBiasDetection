Introduction

Early cerebral reperfusion with tissue plasminogen activator
(tPA) or mechanical thrombectomy is a conventional theraputic strategy in acute ischemic stroke within the time
window, which have been extensively demonstrated to
restore the brain function (Molina and Alvarez-Sabín, 2009).
However, sudden tissue reperfusion could lead to hemorrhagic transformation or massive brain edema due to ‘reperfusion injury’ (Jin et al., 2014). It is already well accepted that
high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
reactive nitrogen species (RNS) after stroke drive neuronal
cell death (Navarro-Yepes et al., 2014). One major mediator is
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), partly because it is converted to
peroxynitrites and hydroxyl radicals in the presence of nitric
oxide and transition metals (Kalyanaraman, 2013), and H2O2
or its derivates can damage DNA and trigger prodeath
signaling when applied directly to cultures (Whittemore
et al., 1995).
MicroRNAs (miRs) are evolutionarily conserved class of
endogenous noncoding RNAs that modulate gene expression
at the post-transcriptional level, and clinical research and
animal experiments indicate that miRs are potential biomarker and therapeutic target for stroke (Tan et al., 2009;
Liu et al., 2010; Hutchison et al., 2009). Some brain-speciﬁc
miRs have been identiﬁed, and miR-23 is reported to be astrocyte speciﬁc by comparing expression in cultures of embryonic neurons and astrocytes (Smirnova et al., 2005). It is worth
noting that miR-23 participate in retinoic-acid-induced neuronal differentiation of human neuroteratocarcinoma (NT2)
cells (Kawasaki and Taira, 2003). A recent study reported that
the expression of the miR-23-27-24 clusters gradually
increased in mouse cortex during brain development, and
more importantly, neuronal-speciﬁc transgenic mice indicated that overexpression of miR-23b reduced neuronal
apoptosis induced by intrauterine hypoxia through inhibiting
apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) expression
(Chen et al., 2014). However, so far neither the expression
proﬁle of miR-23 nor its potential role during acute ischemic
stroke in adult brain was investigated. MiR-23 could suppress
apoptosis and promote cell viability in different cells, as well

as reduce infarct size in rat model of myocardial infarction by
targeting cysteinyl aspartate-speciﬁc proteinase-7 (caspase-7),
Fas, interferon regulatory transcription factor 1 (IRF-1), APAF-1
(Mao et al., 2013; Ruan et al., 2012; Dong et al., 2013; Liu et al.,
2013; Shang et al., 2014), we proposed that miR-23 might afford
neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia and reperfusion
injury. Therefore we test this speculation by performing transient focal cerebral ischemia using the middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) method in vivo and H2O2-induced oxidative
stress in neuro-2a cells in vitro.

Results

2.1.
Expression of miR-23a-3p on the ipsilateral side in
MCAO mouse model
Using mouse transient MCAO model and real-time PCR, we
detected the expression of miR-23a-3p in the ipsilateral brain
tissue subjected to 1 h ischemia followed by 1, 4 and 24 h of
reperfusion respectively. It was demonstrated that miR-23a3p levels were transiently increased in peri-infarction area at
4 h after reperfusion (Fig. 1A, Po0.05), while it was markedly
increased in the infarction core at 4 h and 24 h after reperfusion in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B, Po0.05).

2.2.
MiR-23a-3p angomir protects against brain ischemiareperfusion injury in MCAO mouse model
To investigate the role of miR-23a-3p treatment on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, the miR-23a-3p angomir
(100 mM) (Kinoshita et al., 2014; Selvamani et al., 2012) was
administrated via intracerebroventricular injection and the
cerebral infarction volume was evaluated after 1 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion by TTC staining. The results
showed that miR-23a-3p angomir signiﬁcantly reduced cerebral infarction volume, as compared with those in the MCAO
group (Fig. 2A and B, Po0.05). Our data indicated that miR23a-3p angomir treatment attenuated the focal cerebral
ischemia-reperfusion injury.

2.3.
MiR-23a-3p angomir deceased oxidative stress injury
in transient MCAO mouse model
ROS and RNS were known to derive from mitochondria, and
MnSOD is a key antioxidative enzyme located in mitochondria, which protects the energy-generating mitochondria
from oxidative damage (Wani et al., 2011). To investigate
the inﬂuence of miR-23a-3p on transient MCAO-induced
brain oxidative stress in vivo, the RNS production including
nitric oxide (NO) and oxidation protein products 3-nitrotyrosine
(3-NT) levels, as well as protein expression of manganese
superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) were measured upon treatment
with miR-23a-3p angomir. It was shown that NO and 3-NT
levels which were observably elevated in the ischemic brain of
MCAO rats compared with sham group, were both signiﬁcantly
decreased by miR-23a-3p treatment compared with the MCAO
group (Fig. 3A and B, Po0.05). In accordance, MnSOD were
slightly decreased in the ischemic brain of MCAO rats, which
was signiﬁcantly improved by miR-23a-3p treatment compared
with both sham and MCAO group (Fig. 3C, Po0.05). Collectively,
miR-23a-3p treatment increased antioxidative enzyme MnSOD
and decreased RNS production during focal cerebral ischemia
and reperfusion.

2.4.
MiR-23a-3p angomir alleviated hydrogen
peroxide-induced oxidative stress injury in neuro-2a cell
To further investigate whether miR-23a-3p treatment decrease
oxidative stress injury in neuronal cell line neuro-2a, we tested
the effect of miR-23a-3p on H2O2-induced cell injury determined
by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and expression of pro-

apoptosis factors caspase-3 in neuro-2a cells. It was shown
that increased LDH leakage from neuro-2a cells by H2O2
exposure were markedly decreased by miR-23a-3p treatment
in the neuro-2a cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A,
Po0.05). In addition, western blot notably demonstrated the
activation of caspase-3 in H2O2-treated neuro-2a cells, and
miR-23a-3p strongly reduced activated caspase-3 (Fig. 4B,
Po0.05), suggesting its role in prevention of apoptosis in
neuro-2a cells upon oxidative stress. Taken together, miR23a-3p treatment actually decreased oxidative stress injury in
neuronal cell line neuro-2a.

2.5.
MiR-23a-3p angomir increased anti-oxidative ability
of neuro-2a cell upon hydrogen peroxide stimulation
To investigate whether miR-23a-3p increase the anti-oxidative
ability in neuro-2a cells, RNS production including NO and 3-NT
levels, as well as the total SOD and MnSOD activity in neuro-2a
cells by H2O2 stimulation alone or plus treatment with miR-23a3p were detected. It was shown that RNS production such as NO
and 3-NT levels which were increased in the neuro-2a cells
upon H2O2 exposure, was also reduced dramatically by miR23a-3p treatment compared with both control and H2O2-treated
group in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A and B, Po0.05).
In line with that, total SOD activity and MnSOD activity which
were markedly decreased in the neuro-2a cells, were both
signiﬁcantly improved by miR-23a-3p treatment (Fig. 5C and
D, Po0.05). In line with the result in vivo, miR-23a-3p could
increase the SOD activity in neuro-2a cells, supporting its antioxidative effect in vitro.

Discussion

In this study, we found that miR-23a-3p levels were increased
transiently in peri-infarction area and increased in a timedependent manner in the infarction core following ischemia
and reperfusion in mice. Importantly, intracerebroventricular
injection of miR-23a-3p angomir decreased cerebral infarction
volume after transient MCAO. Meanwhile, miR-23a-3p reduced
RNS production NO and 3-NT, and increased the levels of
antioxidative enzyme MnSOD. In vitro study demonstrated that
miR-23a-3p dose-dependently decreased H2O2-induced LDH
leakage and activation of caspase-3 in neuro-2a cells. Additionally, miR-23a-3p dose-dependently reduced production of NO
and 3-NT in neuro-2a cells, while upregulated H2O2-induced
decreased activity of SOD and MnSOD. Taken together, our data
demonstrated that miR-23a-3p lessened the ischemiareperfusion and oxidative stress injury, providing a potentially
therapeutic target in acute ischemic stroke.

Several reports have demonstrated that miR-23a functions
as an anti-apoptotic and growth-promoting factor in different
types of cells including mesenchymal stem cells, endothelial
cells, osteoblasts, and tumor cells (Chen et al., 2014; Mao et al.,
2013; Ruan et al., 2012; Dong et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013; Shang
et al., 2014; Tan et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2010). Apoptosis-related
genes including caspase-7, caspase-3, Fas, IRF1, Apaf-1 were
proved to be its targets (Chen et al., 2014; Mao et al., 2013;
Ruan et al., 2012; Dong et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013; Shang et al.,
2014). MiR-23a/b and miR-27a/b alleviated hypoxia-induced
neuronal apoptosis by suppressing Apaf-1 (Chen et al., 2014).
MiR-23a inhibited TNF-α-induced apoptosis of bone marrowmesenchymal stem cells, endothelial cells, and osteoblastic
MC3T3-E1 cells by respectively targeting caspase-7, caspase-3,
and Fas (Mao et al., 2013; Ruan et al., 2012; Dong et al., 2013;).
MiR-23a suppresses paclitaxel-induced apoptosis of gastric
adenocarcinoma cells by targeting IRF1 (Liu et al., 2013), and
miR-23a antisense enhanced 5-ﬂuorouracil-induced apoptosis
in colorectal cancer cells through targeting Apaf-1/caspase-9

pathway (Shang et al., 2014). The above literatures proved the
signiﬁcance of miR-23a-3p in anti-apoptosis, and similarly, our
study ﬁrstly testiﬁed its neuroprotective role during focal
cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Our in vivo study showed
that intracerebroventricular injection of miR-23a-3p angomir
decreased cerebral infarction volume after transient ischemia.
In line with that, our in vitro study showed that miR-23a-3p
reduced neuronal cell death and apoptosis indicated by decreasing LDH leakage and pro-apoptosis factor protein levels of
caspase-3 in neuro-2a cells upon H2O2-induced oxidative stress.
Except for the anti-apoptotic character of miR-23a, we
investigated its potential role on oxidative stress injury. ROS
and RNS play a vital role in the process of apoptosis and most
importantly, excessive ROS and RNS are associated with
decreased performance in cognitive function (Hidalgo et al.,
2007). ROS and RNS were known to derive from mitochondria,
and MnSOD is a key antioxidative enzyme located in mitochondria, which protects the energy-generating mitochondria from oxidative damage (Wani et al., 2011). Our data
showed that RNS production such as NO and 3-NT levels
were increased either in transient MCAO mice model or in the
H2O2-treated neuro-2a cells, which were both reduced dramatically by miR-23a-3p treatment. In line with that, miR23a-3p treatment signiﬁcantly improved H2O2-induced
decreased total SOD and MnSOD activity in the neuro-2a
cells. However, the direct target of miR-23a involved in its
anti-oxidative function and its upregulation of SOD, as well
as the connection between increased MnSOD activity and
reduced RNS production needs further investigation.
In summary, the present study proved for the ﬁrst time that
overexpression of miR-23-3p prevented ischemic brain injury,

and a mechanism of suppressing anti-oxidative stress might be
involved, indicating by upregulated expression and activity of
SOD and depression of RNS production. Therefore, except for
the well established growth-promoting and anti-apoptotic
function, the data from this study raise a potential role of
miR-23-3p as an anti-oxidative factor in experimental ischemic
stroke and protect neuronal cells against oxidative stress injury.

Experimental procedure

4.1.

Animal model of focal cerebral ischemia

All experiments with animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Capital Medical
University. Male C57BL/6J mice (Vital River Laboratory Animal
Technology Co. Ltd.) weighing 22 g were used to perform focal
ischemia using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
method (Hata et al., 1998). To ensure the occurrence of
ischemia by MCAO, regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) was
monitored using laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (PeriFlux System
5000, Perimed, Sweden) at a location 0.5 mm anterior and
5.0 mm lateral from bregma. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37.0 1C during and after surgery with a temperaturecontrolled heating pad (CMA 150 Carnegie Medicin, Sweden).

4.2.

Real-time PCR

Twelve rats were divided into 4 groups (N¼3): sham operation group, ischemia 1 h and reperfusion 1 h, 4 h and 24 h

group. The ipsilateral brain samples of MCAO mouse were
isolated on ice, real-Time PCR was undertaken to detect the
miR-23a-3p levels. 30 mg brain tissue was added to 1 ml Trizol
(Invitrogen), and total RNA were extracted. About 50 ng
total RNA from plasma and 500 ng total RNA from brain was
taken for reverse transcription using the SuperScript™ III
Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, CA, USA) with miRNA RT
primer (GenePharma). The expression of matured mouse miRs
was determined by a stem-loop real-time PCR system using
Maxima™ SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Fermentas, Canada)
and StepOne™ sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, USA).
The PCR primers for miR-23a-3p were 50 -GTCGTATCCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTATTCGCACTGGATACGAGG AAATCC-30 and
50 -TCAGTCGATCACATTGCCAG-30 . U6 primers were 50 -CTCG
CTTCGGCAGCACATATACT-30 and 50 -ACGCTTCACGAATTTGCGTGTC-30 . Relative change of miR-23a-3p was calculated using
the 2  ΔΔCT method and normalizated to U6.

4.3.
Intracerebroventricular injection of MiR-23a-3p
angomir
Eighteen rats were divided into 3 groups (N¼6): sham operation
group, ischemia 1 h/ reperfusion 24 hþcontrol angomir group,
ischemia 1 h/reperfusion 24 hþMiR-23a-3p angomir group. The
sequence of miR-23a-3p angomir is 50 -AUCACAUUGCCAGGG AUUUCC-30 . A double-stranded pre-miR-23a-3p angomir (100 μM) or
nonsensical negative control (100 μM) was mixed with the
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Invitorgen,
USA), incubated at room temperature for 20 min, then injected
ICV (7 μl, 20 min) at 10 min after the MCAO (Burton et al., 2011).

4.4.

2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining

The mice were sacriﬁced at 24 h after reperfusion, and brains
were removed quickly. Infarct volumes were measured by

brain research 1592 (2014) 65–72

TTC staining. Seven 2 mm-thick coronal sections were cut at
3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 mm posterior of the olfactory bulb.
Brain slice #3–7 of mice from each group (except for sham
group) were used to perform TTC-staining. Slices were incubated in 2% TTC solution for 30 min at 37 1C, then ﬁxed in 10%
formalin. The border zone of infarction was outlined with
Image-Pro Plus Analysis Software (Media Cybernetics, USA).
Volume calculation with edema correction was performed
blindly using the following formula: 100  (contralateral hemisphere volume noninfarct ipsilateral hemisphere volume)/
contralateral hemisphere volume. The analysis was done by
investigators who were blinded to the experimental groups.

4.5.

Cell culture and miR-23a-3p angomir transfection

The murine neuro-2a cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modiﬁed Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v)
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin
and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. They were maintained at 37 1C
in 5% CO2/air environment. MiR-23a-3p angomir (100 μM)
were transfected into neuro-2a cells for 48 h using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Invitorgen, USA) as
manufacturer's protocol. To initiate oxidative stress, neuro2a cells were stimulated by H2O2 (100 μM) for 6 h, then
collected for assessment.

4.6.

Western blots

The ipsilateral side of brain slice #2 of mice from each group
was used for western blot. Brain tissue and neuro-2a cells
were processed for Western blot as described (Yin et al., 2002).
Primary antibodies (1:1000) used were those against
MnSOD (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), SOD2 and Bcl-2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, USA), and β-actin (Bioworld,
Nanjing, China), respectively. Blots were detected using
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
(1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) and enhanced
luminescence kit.

4.7.

3-NT determined by ELISA

The ipsilateral side of brain slice #1 of mice from each group
was used for ELISA. Brain homogenates (10%, w/v) were
prepared with cold PBS. 3-NT (Cusabio Biotech Co., Ltd.,
USA) levels in brain homogenate supernatants were detected
by ELISA according to the instructions. 3-NT levels in brain
and neuro-2a cells homogenate were normalized to the total
protein.

4.8.
NO, SOD, and MnSOD detected by biochemical
method
The ipsilateral side of brain slice #1 of mice from each group
was used for NO measurement. Brain homogenates (10%, w/v)
were prepared with cold PBS. NO (Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology, Nantong, China) levels in brain homogenate
supernatants were detected by biochemical method. Total
SOD activity and MnSOD activity in neuro-2a cells was
evaluated by SOD Assay Kit-WST kit (Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology, Nantong, China). NO levels and SOD activity

71

in brain or cell homogenate were normalized to the total
protein.

4.9.

Statistical analysis

Data are expressed as means7SEM. Statistical analysis was
performed with two-way analysis of variance, followed by
Newman–Keuel's test. Po0.05 was considered as statistical
signiﬁcance.
