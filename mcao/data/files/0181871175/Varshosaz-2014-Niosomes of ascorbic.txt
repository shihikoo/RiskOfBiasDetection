The objective of the present study was to prepare a stable iv injectable formulation of ascorbic acid and ùõº-tocopherol in
preventing the cerebral ischemia. Different niosomal formulations were prepared by Span and Tween mixed with cholesterol.
The physicochemical characteristics of niosomal formulations were evaluated in vitro. For in vivo evaluation, the rats were
made ischemic by middle cerebral artery occlusion model for 30 min and the selected formulation was used for determining
its neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia. Neuronal damage was evaluated by optical microscopy and transmission
electron microscopy. The encapsulation efficiency of ascorbic acid was increased to more than 84% by remote loading method.
The cholesterol content of the niosomes, the hydrophilicity potential of the encapsulated compounds, and the preparation method
of niosomes were the main factors affecting the mean volume diameter of the prepared vesicles. High physical stability of the
niosomes prepared from Span 40 and Span 60 was demonstrated due to negligible size change of vesicles during 6 months storage
at 4‚Äì8‚àò C. In vivo studies showed that ST60/Chol 35 : 35 : 30 niosomes had more neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemic
injuries in male rats than free ascorbic acid.

1. Introduction
Cerebral ischemia is the third leading cause of deaths in the
United States [1]. In patient with acute cerebral ischemia,
thrombolysis therapy could reduce death after ischemia [2].
Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-TPA) is the
only FDA approved drug which may be effective in 3 hours
of symptom onset [3]. However, intracerebral hemorrhage
(ICH) and mortality risk with r-TPA have led to development of alternative therapies [2]. Brain is a susceptible
tissue to oxidative stress due to high level of free radicals,
high amounts of unsaturated fatty acids, and fair protective
antioxidant capacity in different parts [4]. It is reported that

free radical oxygen has potential role in neural cell damage in
ischemia-reperfusion disorders [5, 6]. Exogenous antioxidant
such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C), ùõº-tocopherol (vitamin E),
and ùõΩ-carotene can be effective on neuronal cell protection
due to the effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on neuronal
cell damages and fast consumption of endogenous scavenging
antioxidants [5, 7]. But their effectiveness depends on their
ability for transporting through the blood brain barrier
(BBB) [8]. It was reported that oral administration of ùõºtocopherol supplementation despite making high plasma
level could not increase ùõº-tocopherol level in ventricular
cerebrospinal fluid even at high doses which could be related
to limited passage from BBB [9]. On other hand, ascorbic

2
acid (a hydrophilic molecule) cannot transport efficiently
across the BBB due to its polarity and hydrophilicity [8].
To overcome these problems, different drug delivery systems such as dendrimers [10], liposomes [11], poly-butyl
cyanoacrylate (PBCA) nanoparticles coated with polysorbate
80 [12], human serum albumin [13], solid lipid nanoparticles
[14], and polymeric nanoparticles such as poly(lactide-coglycolic acid) ones [15] have been studied for increasing
transport of different therapeutics across BBB. Liposomes
containing ascorbic acid or ùõº-tocopherol were prepared by
Sinha et al. [5]. The results were encouraging, but low
chemical stability and thermo-liability of phospholipids, the
main constituents of liposomes, made us develop niosomes
of these two supplements which are more stable to chemicals
and temperature compared to liposomes.
Noisomes are nonionic surfactant vesicles used as drug
carrier similar to liposomes. The low cost, greater stability,
and resultant ease of storage of nonionic surfactants have
led to the development of these carriers as alternatives to
liposomes [16]. There are some reports about the increased
level of niosomal encapsulated drugs in brain of animals
[17]. Increased uptake of methotrexate was observed after
intravenous administration of methotrexate niosomal formulation in mice [18]. Dufes et al. [19] successfully used glucosebearing niosomes as a brain targeted delivery system for the
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). It was also reported that
niosomal formulation of doxorubicin functionalized with
the glucose-derivative N-palmitoyl glucosamine was able to
improve doxorubicin brain concentration in contrast to its
commercial solution [20]. The successful ability of niosomal
carriers to transport through BBB and the capability of
niosomes in encapsulation of both hydrophilic and lipophilic
compounds provided our rational for designing of niosomal
formulation of antioxidant of vitamin C and E for brain
delivery in preventing stroke. This carrier also provides the
ability of iv administration of lipid soluble molecules such as
vitamin E.
Considering the more physical stability of niosomes
than liposomes and regarding promising results of cerebral
ischemia preventive effects reported for ascorbic acid and
vitamin E liposomes [5], the main goal of our study was to
prepare niosomal formulation of ùõº-tocopherol and ascorbic
acid for enhanced brain delivery of these drugs in preventing
neuronal cell damages during ischemia-reperfusion disorders. Different pharmaceutical parameters such as particle
size, encapsulation efficiency, in vitro release of encapsulated
materials, and stability of the designed formulations were
evaluated. In addition, the neuroprotective effects of the
designed formulations were investigated in an ischemiareperfusion model in male rats. To our knowledge, there is
no report on the production and application of niosomal
formulation of these two vitamins in prevention of ischemiareperfusion model in rats.

nonionic surfactants used as vesicle-forming materials
including polysorbate 40 (Tween 40), polysorbate 60 (Tween
60), sorbitan monopalmitate 40 (Span 40), sorbitan monostearate 60 (Span 60), and cholesterol (Chol) were purchased
from Fluka Company (Switzerland). All organic solvents and
the other chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained
from Merck Chemical Company (Germany).
2.2. Preparation of Drugs-Loaded Niosomes
2.2.1. Conventional Film Hydration Method. Vesicular formulations containing ascorbic acid or ùõº-tocopherol were
prepared by film hydration method [21]. The composition
of different niosomal formulations is shown in Table 1.
Briefly, niosomes of ascorbic acid were prepared by dissolving
400 ùúámol of surfactants (equal molar percent of Tween/Span
with the same hydrocarbon chain type and length)/Chol in
chloroform in a round-bottomed flask. The organic solvent
was evaporated under reduced pressure at 55‚àò C. The resultant
thin lipid film produced on the inner wall of the flask was
then hydrated with 10 mL of normal saline 0.9 w/v% solution
containing 2.5 mg/mL of ascorbic acid at 55‚àò C for 30 min.
ùõº-Tocopherol niosomal formulations were prepared by the
same amounts and types of surfactants/Chol and the same
method as ascorbic acid but 20 mg of ùõº-tocopherol was
dissolved in the chloroform along with the other lipids in
the round-bottomed flask. The compositions of the different
formulations of vesicles are listed in Table 1.
2.2.2. Remote Loading Method. Ascorbic acid was loaded
into preformed niosomes by modifying a remote-loading
technique [22‚Äì24]. The composition of different niosomal
formulations is shown in Table 1. Briefly, 400 ùúámol of surfactants and cholesterol was dissolved in chloroform in a roundbottomed flask. The organic solvent was evaporated under
reduced pressure at 55‚àò C. The dried lipid film was hydrated
with 5 mL calcium acetate (200 mM). Nonentrapped calcium
acetate was removed from the niosomal suspension by
dialysis (molecular weight cutoff of 12 kDa) against dextrose
5 w/v% for 2 h. Then, 5 mL of the solution of ascorbic acid
with concentration of 5 mg/mL was added to the prepared
niosomal suspension and mixed in a rotating water bath for
20 min.

2.3. Vesicle Size Measurement. The particle size of different
formulations was measured using a static laser light diffraction method by Malvern particle size analyzer (Malvern
Instruments, MasterSizer 2000E, UK) 48 h after preparation.
2.4. Encapsulation Efficiency Determination. To separate
nonentrapped ùõº-tocopherol or ascorbic acid from niosomes,
the vesicular suspensions were centrifuged (National labnet,
USA) at 25000 rpm for 60 min at 4‚àò C and washed twice
with normal saline 0.9 w/v%. The amount of entrapped ùõºtocopherol or ascorbic acid in the niosomes was analyzed
by UV/visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 2100, Japan) at
ùúÜ max of 246 and 290 nm for ascorbic acid and ùõº-tocopherol,
respectively, after disrupting the niosomes by ethanol 96%.
The encapsulation efficiency percent of ùõº-tocopherol or
ascorbic acid (EE %) was determined from
EE% = (

where ùê∂ùëù is the active component concentration encapsulated in the niosomes and ùê∂ùëá is the initial drug concentration
added to formulation. Empty niosomes were used as blank.
2.5. In Vitro Drug Release Studies. Ascorbic acid release from
various formulations was evaluated using dialysis method.
The dialysis membrane (molecular weight cutoff of 12 kDa)
that contained 4 mL of ascorbic acid formulation was placed
in a glass flask filled with 40 mL of normal saline 0.9 w/v%
as receptor compartment. Temperature was maintained at
37 ¬± 1‚àò C by a circulating water bath. The medium in the
receptor compartment was magnetically stirred at a rate of
100 rpm. Samples of the medium were withdrawn at fixed
time intervals and replaced with an equal volume of fresh
normal saline for 6 h. The drug released concentration in
the medium was quantified spectrophotometrically. In the
case of lipid soluble material, ùõº-tocopherol, drug release was
negligible in the mentioned period of release test due to
the low partitioning characteristics of vitamin E in aqueous
media and intercalating of this material in lipid bilayers.
2.6. Physical Stability of Vesicles. The vesicles were stored
in glass vials in refrigerator (4‚Äì8‚àò C) for 6 months and the
changes in vesicles diameter were determined by laser light
scattering method. The changes in morphology of multilayered vesicles (MLVs) and also the separation of constituents
were assessed by the optical microscope (HFX-DX, Nikon,
Japan). No special precautions were taken to improve the
stability of the vesicles.
2.7. In Vivo Studies
2.7.1. Pretreatment of Animals with Niosomes and Induction
of Cerebral Ischemia. Male Wistar rats weighing 220‚Äì270 g
were used for study. Animals had free access to food and water
before and after surgical procedures. All animal studies were
done in compliance with the ethics guidelines approved by
the Kerman University of Medical Science (Kerman, Iran).

Rats were divided into 7 groups: group 1 for ascorbic acid
niosomal formulation, group 2 for ùõº-tocopherol niosomal
formulation, group 3 for free ascorbic acid (as ùõº-tocopherol
was not water soluble there was no treated group with iv
administration of free ùõº-tocopherol), group 4 for normal
saline (negative control), group 5 for blank niosomes, group
6 for a mixture of ùõº-tocopherol and ascorbic acid niosomes
in a ratio of 1 : 1 (w/w), and group 7 for sham-operated rats.
All animals received either ascorbic acid or ùõº-tocopherol with
a dose of 8 mg/kg body weight which was injected into the
tail vein of rats 2-3 h before cerebral ischemia [5]. Animals
were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg) and were
made ischemic by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
for 30 min [25]. Under the neurosurgical microscope, the
right common carotid artery (CCA) was exposed to a midline
incision. After blocking all branches of the external carotid
artery (ECA) and extra cranial branches of the internal
carotid artery (ICA), a 4‚Äì0 nylon intraluminal suture was
introduced into cervical ICA and advancing in intracranially
to block blood flow into the middle cerebral artery (MCA).
Following thirty minutes, suture was withdrawn and blood
flow resumed. After recovery from the anesthesia, the animals
were returned to their home cages. Two days after ischemia,
the animals were tested for neurological examination. Neuronal damage was evaluated by optical microscopy and was
estimated as a rate of the number of degenerated pyramidal
neurons to that of both surviving and degenerated in three
distinct areas of the cortex subfield in coronal sections for
each animal [26]. The morphology of neurons was evaluated
under transmission electron microscope (EM300, Philips,
Holland).

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Encapsulation Efficiency. Encapsulation efficiencies (EE)
in all studied formulations are shown in Table 2. ùõºTocopherol had often higher EE% than ascorbic acid, which
is clearly due to its hydrophobic nature and its intercalating
in lipophilic core of surfactant bilayers [27]. Increasing the
amount of Chol from 30 to 50 mole percent reduced the
EE% of ùõº-tocopherol in both types of studied surfactants
which was due to the competition between ùõº-tocopherol
and Chol molecules. Remote-loading procedure by using an
ammonium sulfate gradient method [28] and complexation
with arylsulfonates are two ways reported for intravesicular
precipitate and enhancement of drug retention [29]. In our
study, higher encapsulation efficiency of ascorbic acid was
achieved by the remote-loading procedure by using calcium
acetate gradient method (Table 2) compared to the other
loading method (ùëÉ < 0.05). It was supposed that during
remote loading ascorbic acid diffused in uncharged form
via niosome membrane due to calcium acetate and pH
trans-membrane gradient. There, it loses its proton, becomes
negatively charged, and forms a poorly soluble ascorbate
calcium salt, which precipitates in the intraniosomal aqueous
phase. This method also improved encapsulation efficiency of
ciprofloxacin [30], diclofenac, insulin, and fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled insulin [22] in liposomes and luteinizing

hormone releasing hormone niosomes [31]. Increasing the
molar ratio of Chol from 30 to 40 increased the EE% of
ascorbic acid significantly (ùëÉ < 0.05) (Table 2). This can
be related to increasing the rigidity of the bilayers following
Chol content enhancement which is parallel to gel transition
temperature abolishment following Chol incorporation in
lipid bilayers [32].
3.2. Morphology and Size Distribution of Vesicles. All used
nonionic surfactant compositions formed niosomes in the
presence of cholesterol. Figure 2 demonstrates the formation
of niosomes in different formulations. Morphologically, the
formulated niosomes were frequently as round MLVs as
depicted in Figure 1. Obviously, this was predictable as film
hydration method usually produces MLVs.

The mean volume diameters (ùëëV ) of the prepared nonionic surfactant vesicles with different compositions are
presented in Tables 3 and 4. From data presented in these
tables, it is obvious that, following the increase of cholesterol
molar percent, the ùëëV of neutral niosomes prepared by
film hydration or remote loading methods was increased.
Moazeni et al. [33] also reported the forming of the greater
ciprofloxacin niosomes after raising the cholesterol content
from 30 to 40 and 50 molar percent. The integration of the
drug also has a significant effect on the particle size of the
vesicles. It was revealed that the incorporation of vitamin C or
vitamin E in all formulations led to size reduction compared
to empty niosomes (ùëÉ < 0.05) (the results of empty vesicles
were not shown here). In a similar manner, Junyaprasert et al.
[34] reporeted a slight size reduction in niosomal suspensions

that affected the particle size of vesicles was the method
of preparation. The mentioned niosomes prepared by film
hydration technique were significantly smaller than remote
loading vesicles (ùëÉ < 0.05). In ascorbic acid, niosomal
formulations prepared from Span/Tween 40 and at the low
levels of Chol (30 and 40 molar ratios), the vesicles volume
diameter was more influenced by the preparation method

bilayers composed of stearyl alkyl chain (ùê∂18 ) in Span/Tween

agents must be considered in drug permeation studies in

lipids has clear effect on drug efflux from vesicles as well. In
many cases, the drug release profile from niosomal systems
are biphasic such as caffeine [35] and insulin [32] indicating
a rapid desorption and a slower diffusion of entrapped drug
though bilayer phases. In the present study, similar biphasic
release was observed (Figures 3 and 4). The rapid initial phase
may be related to desorption of drug from the surface of
niosomes. After the initial burst release, a constant ascorbic
acid release was observed during 360 min which was due to
diffusion of ascorbic acid from lipid bilayer. According to
this result, it took time for ascorbate ion to be released from
multiple bilayers of niosomal vesicles that were stabilized
by cholesterol. Interestingly, the overall release amount of

ascorbic acid is adjustable with EE% of drug in which more
EE% led to less drug release.

3.4. Stability Studies. Tables 3 and 4 exhibit the change in
particle size is as a major indicator for niosomes stability
during storage at 4‚àò C for 6 months. In the present study,
high vesicular stability was observed as depicted in Figure 5.
Higher stability in vesicular structure of formulations with
more cholestrol content was seen (ùëÉ < 0.05) (Tables 2 and
3). The role of cholestrol in increasing membrane stability
was reported perviously [33]. On the other hand, relatively
large diameter of all prepared niosomes (>5 ùúám) maybe

ascorbic noisome, (f) ùõº-tocopherol noisome, and (g) niosomal formulation with a mixture of ùõº-tocopherol and ascorbic acid treated rats. As
shown in the micrograph, the normal ultrastructure of cortical neuron is visible in sham-operated group. Ischemia-reperfusion resulted in
severe degenerative changes including chromatin aggregation, organelles swelling of the neurons in the saline-treated and empty niosome
groups. Meanwhile, the whole ultrastructure of cortical neurons was maintained in the other groups mostly in the niosome formulation with
a mixture of ùõº-tocopherol and ascorbic acid. (Scale bar: 630 nm).

another reason for observed vesicular stability during 6month storage at refrigerator temperature because smaller
vesicles are thermodynamically unstable [33]. The last reason
of our niosomal stability could be related to gel state nature
of Span/Tween 40 and Span/Tween 60 bilayers which are less
sensitive to temperature fluctuation and less desire for bilayer
fusion. In some cases such as Span/Tween 40/Chol/vitamin
E (50 molar ratio of Chol), a slight decrease in mean volume
diameter of vesicles was observed (Tables 3 and 4). Similar
results were observed in formulations prepared from Brij
52 and cholesterol [32]. To explain this observation, two
theories are suggested [36]: (i) the ions adsorption to the
bilayer originates a change in the head groups charge and, as
a consequence, the bilayer changes its curvature due to the
electric interactions which in turn causes changing in their
size and (ii) the concentration gradient at both membrane
sides generates an osmotic force due to the membrane
impermeability to some ions, the vesicles react sending off
water, decreasing their size.
3.5. Animal Studies. According to the obtained data in light
microscopy study (Figure 6), the morphology of neurons
in sham-operated group was normal but the most of the
pyramidal neurons in saline-treated and blank niosome
groups showed severe degenerative changes including
eosinophilic and shrunk cytoplasm with extensively dark
picnotic nuclei. In experimental groups that received the
drug, the severity of degenerative changes in cytoplasm and
nucleus were significantly less compared to saline-treated
groups and groups that received blank niosome (ùëÉ < 0.05).

In addition, encapsulated niosomal formulations especially
the mixture of ùõº-tocopherol and ascorbic acid niosomal
formulation (1 : 1 w/w 4 mg/kg) showed more positive effects
in cerebral-induced injuries (Figure 6). In experimental
groups receiving ascorbic acid, loaded niosome and a
combination of ascorbic acid and ùõº-tocopherol niosomal
formulation, the mean number of degenerated neurons were
significantly smaller than free ascorbic acid (ùëÉ < 0.05).
However, the difference between the two niosomal groups
were not statistically significant (ùëÉ > 0.05).
For confirmation of our results in light microscopy, we
also studied the ultrastructure of the pyramidal neurons in
the cortex of male rats using transmission electron microscope (TEM).
Morphology of cortical neurons in sham-operated group
was intact (Figure 7). Some degenerative changes including
organelles swelling, chromatin aggregation, and darkening of
nucleus were observed in saline-treated and blank noisome
groups. Treatment with prepared drugs preserved the ultrastructure of the most cortical neurons especially the mixture
of ùõº-tocopherol and ascorbic acid niosomal formulation
(1 : 1 w/w 4 mg/kg) (Figure 7). In other words, the electron
microscopy results confirmed the data obtained by light
microscopy.

4. Conclusions
To compensate the problems related to transport of natural
antioxidants in brain ischemia due to stroke, two different compounds of ùõº-tocopherol and ascorbic acid were

8
formulated in niosomes composed of sorbitane esters and
their ethoxylated derivatives. The cholesterol content and
the hydrophilicity potential of encapsulated compounds were
the main factors affecting the mean volume diameter of the
prepared vesicles. Furthermore, in ascorbic acid niosomes,
the method of niosome preparation had obvious effect on
the mean diameter of vesicles. High physical stability of gel
state niosomes caused negligible size change during 6-month
storage at 4‚Äì8‚àò C.
In vivo results showed that although there was no significant difference between the mean number of degenerated neurons in the group received ascorbic acid niosomes
with those treated with a mixture of ascorbic acid and
ùõº-tocopherol niosomes and the groups treated with ùõºtocopherol niosomes alone (ùëÉ > 0.05) but, it was significantly
higher in the group receiving free ascorbic compared to the
mixed niosomes. In other words, the effectiveness of the
formulated new drug delivery system in protection of cerebral
tissue against elevation in oxygen free radical concentration
during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion course was more than
the free ascorbic acid. In addition, the designed niosomal
formulation provides a suitable possible way for ùëñV administration of a water insoluble drug like ùõº-tocopherol.
