Mitochondrial dynamics play a critical role in mitochondrial function and signaling. Although mitochondria play a critical role in hypoxia/ischemia, the further mechanisms between mitochondrial dynamics
and ischemia are still unclear. The current study aimed to determine the role of mitofusin 2, a key regulator
of mitochondrial fusion, in a hypoxic model and to explore a novel strategy for cerebral ischemia via modulation of mitochondrial dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to investigate both
mitochondrial function and molecular pathways to determine the role of mitofusin 2 in hypoxia-induced
neuronal apoptosis. In vivo, C57BL/6 mice (male, 19–25 g) underwent a permanent middle cerebral artery
occlusion for 12 or 24 h (n = 6 per group). In vitro, cobalt chloride was used to mimic hypoxia in immortalized hippocampal neurons. Down- or up-regulation of Mfn2 was induced to investigate the role of Mfn2
in hypoxia, especially in mitochondrial function and signaling pathways. The ﬁndings demonstrated that
decreased mitofusin 2 occurred both in vivo and in vitro hypoxic models; second, the anti-apoptotic effect
of Mfn2 may work via restoration of mitochondrial function; third, the modulation of the B Cell Leukemia
2/Bcl-2 Associated X protein and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling pathways highlight
the role of Mfn2 in signaling pathways beyond fusion. In summary, depletion of mitofusin 2 would lead
to apoptosis both in normal or hypoxic conditions; however, mitofusin 2 overexpression could attenuate hypoxia-induced apoptosis, which represents a potential novel strategy for neuroprotection against
ischemic brain damage.

The incidence and mortality of cerebral ischemia have dramatically increased and represent a major cause of disability (Mazighi
et al., 2012). Substantial efforts have focused on understanding
the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of cerebral ischemia
and the development of drugs that potentially prevent ischemiainduced brain damage. However, progress has been unsatisfactory
to date (Hlavica et al., 2015). Mitochondria, which represent cellular powerhouses, play an irreplaceable role in cerebral ischemia. In
general, mitochondria are key players in cellular processes, such
as energy metabolism, calcium storage, reactive oxygen species
(ROS) production, and the regulation of apoptosis (Chan, 2006a;
Martens et al., 2014). Studies have demonstrated that following
cerebral ischemia, mitochondria overproduced ROS, which may
cause macromolecular damage, such as lipid peroxidation, protein
oxidation, DNA oxidation etc. that may lead to cell injury and death
(Chan, 2001; Lou et al., 2008). In addition to ROS, mitochondria regulated apoptotic pathways via Ca2+ sequestration and the storage

30

and release of anti-/pro-apoptotic proteins, such as cytochrome c,
apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), B Cell Leukemia 2 (Bcl-2) family
members etc. in ischemic diseases (Fiskum et al., 1999; Schabitz
et al., 2000). Furthermore, hypoxic injury can also lead to mitochondrial injury, which is similar to that induced by ischemia (Blomgren
and Hagberg, 2006; Yang et al., 2011).
Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that undergo constant ﬁssion and fusion events to maintain mitochondrial structure
and function (Chen et al., 2005). Mitochondrial ﬁssion and fusion
events are mainly regulated by dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)
for ﬁssion, as well as mitofusin protein 1, 2 (Mfn1, 2) and optic
atrophy protein 1 (Opa1) for fusion. Consistent with the critical
roles of mitochondrial dynamics in neurons, defects in mitochondrial ﬁssion and fusion proteins are associated with inherited
or acquired neurodegenerative diseases, such as Charcot-MarieTooth disease or Alzheimer’s disease, respectively (Benard et al.,
2007). Loss of balance in fusion and ﬁssion also lead to other
acute cerebral injuries, especially ischemic stroke. Furthermore,
early-onset stroke has been associated with a novel Mfn2 mutation (P456L) (Chung et al., 2008). Mammals have two mitofusin
genes, Mfn1 and Mfn2, which are GTPases localized on the outer
mitochondrial membrane. These essential components of the
mitochondrial outer membrane fusion apparatus form homopolymers or hetero-oligomers. GTPases and heptad repeat coiled-coil
domains are critical for their activity. They interact in trans with
mitofusin molecules on opposing mitochondria, which thereby
tether adjacent mitochondria together to initiate mitochondrial
fusion (Koshiba et al., 2004).
Emerging studies have suggested that an altered balance in
mitochondrial ﬁssion and fusion may be a potential mechanism
leading to mitochondrial dysfunction in neurological disorders
(Archer, 2013; Su et al., 2010). In addition, mitochondrial fusion
and ﬁssion proteins are also involved in mitochondrial metabolism,
energy metabolism, respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and mtDNA stability (Zheng and Xiao, 2010). In contrast
to Mfn1, Mfn2 exerts potential effects on the cardiovascular system, which extend beyond its fusion function (Chen et al., 2012b;
Guo et al., 2007). Furthermore, Purkinje cells require Mfn2 but
not Mfn1 for dendritic outgrowth, spine formation, and cell survival in the nervous system (Chen et al., 2007). Speciﬁc proteins
involved in mitochondrial fusion/ﬁssion also modulate mitochondrial apoptosis. Previous studies have demonstrated a major role of
Drp1-mediated mitochondrial ﬁssion in neuronal apoptosis associated with acute ischemic brain damage, especially ischemic stroke
and glutamate toxicity (Grohm et al., 2012). However, in contrast
to ﬁssion, mitochondrial fusion supports substitution and regeneration of mitochondrial proteins, mtDNA repair, and functional
recovery (Benard et al., 2007). Therefore, it is likely that Mfn2 plays
an opposite role compared with Drp1, as well as a more important
role in some diseases.
The current study aimed to determine Mfn2 expression in an in
vitro hypoxic model and conﬁrm the ﬁndings in an in vivo MCAO
model. Cobalt chloride (CoCl2 ) was used to mimic ischemic hypoxia
in vitro in HT22 cells (Gallo et al., 2014). Both models have been
used to investigate neuronal apoptosis in previous research (Chen
and Chang, 2009). Based on increasing evidence that supported the
role of Mfn2 in ischemic injury, this study investigated the function of Mfn2 in mitochondrial signaling pathways, in an effort to
investigate the mechanisms of ischemic diseases.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Cell cultures and treatment
Immortalized hippocampal neurons (HT22 cells) derived from
mice were cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium

(DMEM; Gibco, NY, MD, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Gibco, NY, MD, USA). The cells were maintained at 37 ◦ C in
a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were cultured in a low fetal bovine
serum medium and treated with CoCl2 (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA), which caused inactivation of hydroxylase enzymes and
stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1␣ (Hif 1␣) to mimic
chemical hypoxia (Epstein et al., 2001), at various concentrations
for the indicated times.
2.2. MCAO model
A standard model of intraluminal right MCAO was used to
induce permanent focal ischemia as previously described (Ye et al.,
2012). C57BL/6 mice (male, 19–24 g) were anesthetized using 3%
isoﬂurane (1.5% for maintenance) through inhalation. MCAO was
performed with several modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, the bifurcation of the
right common carotid artery (CCA) was exposed through a midline
neck incision. The right CCA and external carotid artery (ECA) were
ligated. A monoﬁlament nylon suture with a blunt end was inserted
through a small incision in the CCA and then gently advanced from
the right CCA into the internal carotid artery (ICA) until resistance
was encountered (9.5 ± 0.5 mm from the CCA bifurcation), which
indicated a blocked right MCA origin. After the indicated time of
MCA occlusion, the mice were euthanized for protein extraction.
Before, during, and after surgery, a heating pad and lamp were used
to maintain the rectal temperature in the range of 37.0 ± 0.5 ◦ C until
the mice recovered from anesthesia. The same surgical procedures
were conducted in the sham-operated mice, with the exception
of MCAO. All experimental protocols and animal handling procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes
of Health (NIH) Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the Fourth Military Medical University.
2.3. Lentivirus infection
The methods for LV preparation of RNAi and overexpression
have been previously described (Rao et al., 2015). To develop shRNA
lentivirus, Mfn2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA: GGA AGA GCA CCG TGA
TCA A) was subcloned into an LV expression vector (GeneChem
Company, Shanghai, China). The LV construct coexpressed EGFP
driven by the ubiquitin C promoter. The LV-Mfn2 overexpression
system (NM 001285920) was developed in a Ubi-3FLAG-MCSIRES-puromycin construct (GeneChem Company, Shanghai, China).
HT22 cells were transfected with the LV vectors (MOI = 20) for 72 h
followed by additional experimental studies. Puromycin was used
to establish a stable strain. LV-Con represented a negative control.
2.4. Cell viability
HT22 cells were placed in 96-well plates for hypoxia exposure
with CoCl2 (Control, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 ␮M) for 24 h. The
cells were analyzed with a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8, Dojindo,
Shanghai, China) following the manufacturer’s protocol. After 2 h
of incubation, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a
microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The cell viability
was expressed as a percentage of the control group.
2.5. TUNEL
The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP
nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was employed to detect cellular
apoptosis. The procedure was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Brieﬂy, the
cells were cultured on plates and treated with 300 ␮M CoCl2 for
24 h. The cells were subsequently washed with phosphate-buffered

C. Peng et al. / The International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology 69 (2015) 29–40

saline (PBS) and ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The
cells were then incubated with the prepared mixture of working
liquid at 37 ◦ C for 1 h in the dark. Prior to detection, the cells were
stained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for
10 min to dry the nucleus and then washed with PBS several times.
The positive control groups were treated according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After staining, the cells were examined under a
confocal microscope (FV10i, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) to observe the
green ﬂuorescence levels. The experiments were performed in triplicate, and the percentage of positive cells was determined (TUNEL
positive cells/Total cells).
2.6. Western blot
An equal amount of protein (30 ␮g) per sample was separated by
SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The nonspeciﬁc binding of antibodies was blocked with 5% nonfat dried
milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature
and then incubated overnight at 4 ◦ C with the appropriate primary
antibodies (Hif 1␣ 1:800, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom;
Mfn2 1:1000, Bax 1:600, Bcl-2 1:500, Caspase 3 1:1000, Cleavedcaspase 3 1:1000, ␤-actin 1:5000, ERK/phospho-ERK 1:1000, Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) as previously described
(Rao et al., 2013).
2.7. Cytochrome c release
Cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm was assessed after
obtaining sub-cellular fractions using the immunoassay kit Quantikine (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Samples were placed
in a lysis buffer (Gibco, NY, MD, USA) that contained protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The cell
lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 600 × g, and the pellets that
contained the nuclei and unbroken cells were discarded. The supernatant was then centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g. The pellet
and supernatant were separated for further analysis. The resulting supernatant was removed and used as the cytosolic fraction.
The pellet was collected as the mitochondrial fraction. The methods were performed as previously described (Chen et al., 2012a).
Absolute cytochrome c release for each condition was deﬁned as:
[supernatant cyto c signal/supernatant + mito cyto c signal] × 100%.
All experiments were repeated at least in triplicate.

31

cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X100, followed by incubation with primary antibodies overnight at
4 ◦ C. The cells were subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa 488 goat–anti-rabbit, Invitrogen, 1:800) for 3 h at
room temperature. The cultures were dehydrated with PBS and
mounted with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)
for nuclear staining. Images were captured using a confocal microscope (FV10i, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). All images were acquired
under identical exposure time to enable comparison of the relative
immunoreactivity levels under different treatment conditions. At
least six images per group were obtained by an evaluator blinded to
the experimental conditions; the procedure was repeated at least
three times.
2.10. ATP
Cellular ATP levels were measured using a ﬁreﬂy luciferasebased ATP assay kit (Beyotime, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Chen et al., 2009). Brieﬂy, after 24 h of hypoxia,
HT22 cells were subjected to ﬁssion and centrifuged at 12,000 g for
5 min. In 24-well plates, 100 ␮L of each supernatant was mixed
with 100 ␮L ATP working dilution. Luminance was measured using
a monochromator microplate reader (Saﬁre II, Tecan, Switzerland).
The ATP release levels were expressed as a percentage of the luminescence levels in the treated control cells. For statistical analysis,
the experiments were repeated at least three times with an n = 4
per treatment condition.
2.11. Mitochondrial oxidative stress
To determine the mitochondrial oxidation level, a novel reporter
gene referred to as Mito-Timer was used, which was engineered
by Laker et al. (2014). Brieﬂy, we transferred a mixture of plasmid
(Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) into cells incubated with serum-free DMEM,
and the medium was changed to 10% serum DMEM after 8 h. After
24–48 h, a confocal microscope (FV10i, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was
used to acquire images that contained green (excitation/emission
488/518 nm) and red (excitation/emission 543/572 nm) channels.
The modiﬁed statistical analysis was performed as described by
Laker et al. (2014).
2.12. MMP

2.8. RNA extraction and real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. After
extraction, 500 ng of total RNA were used as a template to synthesize cDNA using a ﬁrst strand synthesis kit (Takara, Dalian, China).
The cDNA was then used in quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). The primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were as follows: forward, 5 -GGG TCA
GAA GGA TTC CTA TG-3 ; reverse, 5 -GGT CTC AAA CAT GAT CTG
GG-3 . The primers for Mfn2 were as follows: forward, 5 -TGA AGG
CCT GAG TTA ATA CCT AGC-3 ; reverse, 5 -TCA TCA ACT AAG TGA
CAA GGA AGG-3 . The data were analyzed using a comparative
critical threshold (Ct) method in which the amount of target was
normalized to that of endogenous control relative to the control
samples.

HT22 cells were seeded in a 15 mm confocal petri dish (Nest)
and loaded with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester perchlorate
(TMRM) (100 nM; Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in Hanks
Balanced Salt Solution supplemented with 20 mM glucose and
10 mM HEPES (HBSS) (Gibco, NY, MD, USA) for 30 min. The cells
were washed with PBS several times in the dark. During image
acquisition, carbonyl cyanide-4-(triﬂuoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (5 ␮M FCCP; Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added
to produce a consistent decrease in spatially averaged TMRM. The
cells were subsequently detected using a confocal laser scanning
microscope (FV10i, Olympus, Japan). The images were acquired and
analyzed with Olympus confocal software. The differences in the
ﬂuorescence between the initial and ﬁnal readings (approximately
15 min after the addition of FCCP) were compared across groups.
2.13. Mitochondrial morphology

2.9. Immunostaining
Prior to ﬂuorescence intensity measurement, HT22 cells were
exposed to hypoxic conditions (300 ␮M for 24 h). After ﬁxation

For mitochondrial staining, the standard medium was replaced
with a medium that contained 100 nM Mito Tracker® Red (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and the cells were incubated with dye
at 37 ◦ C for 30 min in the dark. The cells were then washed with

32

PBS. Mitochondria in live cells were visualized using laser confocal scanning microscopy (FV10i, Olympus, Japan). The images were
acquired with Olympus confocal software. The cells were classiﬁed
as three different types according to their mitochondrial morphology (Sanderson et al., 2015): Category 1 comprised healthy cells
with an elongated tubular mitochondrial network and mitochondria that were equally distributed throughout the cytosol; Category
2 comprised injured cells that exhibited large round or short tubular mitochondria distributed throughout the cytosol; and Category
3 comprised severely injured cells that exhibited round or punctate
mitochondria located close to the nucleus. For statistical analysis,
the experiments were repeated at least three times with approximately 100 cells per group.
2.14. Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed at least three times. The
statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0
(GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). The data are presented as the
mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM), and signiﬁcant differences between groups were assessed using one-way or two-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s multiple
comparisons test or unpaired t-tests (for two groups).
3. Results
3.1. Reduction of Mfn2 in ischemic/hypoxic conditions in vivo
and in vitro
To determine the Mfn2 expression in ischemic/hypoxic conditions, we examined the Mfn2 level in vivo and in vitro. The
increasing Hif 1␣ level at the indicated concentration gradient
was used to evaluate the CoCl2 -induced hypoxia for 24 h (Fig. 1A).
Furthermore, the increased cleaved caspase 3 level indicated that
apoptosis was induced by hypoxia at different CoCl2 concentrations
for 24 h (Fig. 1B). To investigate the appropriate concentration of
CoCl2 in a hypoxic model in vitro, a CCK-8 assay was used to detect
the cell viability following treatment with different concentrations
for 24 h (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 ␮M; Fig. 1C). Concentrationdependent regulation of Mfn2 was identiﬁed via real-time PCR after
exposure to hypoxia (Fig. 1D). Western blot was subsequently used
to conﬁrm the reduction in Mfn2 after hypoxia (Fig. 1E). Moreover,
the concentration was conﬁrmed by ﬂuorescence, and a decreased
ﬂuorescence intensity was identiﬁed in the hypoxia group, which
conﬁrmed the results (Fig. 2A). These results demonstrated that
Mfn2 was signiﬁcantly decreased following an appropriate dose
of CoCl2 (300 ␮M) for 24 h. The results indicated that Mfn2 was
located in the mitochondria, and there was no difference in the
change of location between the control and injury groups (Fig. 2B).
Following a right permanent MCAO model for 12 and 24 h in vivo,
the Mfn2 level was assessed in the ipsilateral injury side (right)
and heterolateral control side (left) (Solenski et al., 2002). The
ipsilateral Mfn2 expression was signiﬁcantly lower than the heterolateral side at both ischemia timepoints (12 h, P < 0.001; 24 h,
P < 0.0001; Fig. 1F). These results demonstrated that Mfn2 expression was decreased in ischemic and hypoxic conditions. However,
whether the reduced Mfn2 had viable effects on ischemic/hypoxic
injury remains unknown.
3.2. Role of Mfn2 in hypoxia-induced apoptosis
Based on the current ﬁndings, the exact role of Mfn2 in hypoxiainduced injury was investigated. In vitro, the role of Mfn2 in
apoptosis was explored via transfecting shRNA into HT22 cells
both in the control and hypoxia groups, and LV-Mfn2 was used

to determine whether restoration of Mfn2, which was reduced by
hypoxia, attenuated hypoxia-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3A). Following hypoxia in HT22 cells, the CCK-8 results indicated that Mfn2
down-regulation led to decreased cell viability compared with
baseline (Fig. 3B). However, the LV-Mfn2 groups had signiﬁcantly
increased cell viability compared with the negative control (LVCon) group (200, 300 and 400 ␮M; Fig. 3B). Furthermore, HT22
cells were analyzed using a TUNEL assay after hypoxia. Following the selection of several random ﬁelds, two thousand cells were
counted per group. After hypoxia, shRNA groups exhibited a higher
TUNEL-positive rate (19.29 ± 1.24%) compared with the LV-Con
groups (14.57 ± 1.15%; P < 0.05). In contrast, the LV-Mfn2 groups
exhibited a signiﬁcantly less TUNEL-positive rate (5.69 ± 0.73%)
compared with the LV-Con groups (14.57 ± 1.15%; P < 0.001; Fig. 3C
and D). These ﬁndings demonstrated that the down-regulation of
Mfn2 led to increased apoptosis in normal conditions. Moreover,
hypoxia exacerbated this detrimental effect. However, restoration
of the reduced Mfn2 levels induced by hypoxia attenuated apoptosis. Therefore, the apoptosis induced by hypoxia may depend on
the reduction of Mfn2.
3.3. Mfn2 overexpression attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction
and restored mitochondrial morphology induced by hypoxia
Based on the current ﬁndings, reduced Mfn2 is an important factor in hypoxic injury. Therefore, the exact mechanisms
were investigated via Mfn2 overexpression. However, it remained
unclear whether the protective role of Mfn2 was related to mitochondrial function. To assess mitochondrial injury in hypoxia, we
measured the mitochondrial oxidative stress level, MMP, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and morphology, which represented key
pathophysiological conditions in mitochondria. Previous reports
suggested that mitochondria appeared as short tubules and round
fragments after mitochondrial injury (Grohm et al., 2010). In
the absence of hypoxia, mitochondria exhibited interconnected
long tubular networks (category 1), which indicated homeostasis
between mitochondrial fusion and ﬁssion events (Fig. 4A). Following exposure to hypoxia, mitochondria appeared as short tubules
or round fragments (categories 2 and 3) (Fig. 4A). However, the LVMfn2 groups (41.64 ± 5.25%) exhibited a signiﬁcantly lower rate
compared with the LV-Con (68.16 ± 10.19%) in category 3 after
hypoxia (P < 0.05; Fig. 4B). These ﬁndings indicated that reduced
mitochondrial fragmentation and increased fusion events after
Mfn2 overexpression in hypoxia may represent a novel approach
to restore mitochondrial morphology.
We used a novel reporter gene to measure mitochondrial
oxidative stress in hypoxic conditions. To determine whether mitochondrial oxidative stress promoted a shift in the ﬂuorescence
spectrum from green to red, pMito Timer plasmid transfected HT22
cells were exposed to hypoxia. An overall increase in the red/green
ratio of the mitochondrial network under mitochondrial stress conditions was identiﬁed, which was likely a result of increased protein
oxidation rather than altered transcription/translation (Laker et al.,
2014). Following LV-Mfn2 overexpression, the red/green ratio
was signiﬁcantly decreased compared with the LV-Con groups
(Fig. 4C and D; P < 0.05), which indicated that the mitochondrial oxidative level was reduced by Mfn2 overexpression. The
ATP detection results indicated that Mfn2 overexpression ameliorated the injured mitochondrial respiratory function following
hypoxia (Fig. 4E; P < 0.05). Fluorescence of TMRM was used to
identify changes of MMP. The results demonstrated an obvious decrease in MMP in hypoxic injury (Fig. 4F). However,
Mfn2 overexpression signiﬁcantly attenuated the hypoxia-induced
loss of MMP (Fig. 4F; P < 0.01). Thus, Mfn2-regulated apoptosis
induced by hypoxia may modulate mitochondrial function and
morphology.

****P < 0.0001 compared with the untreated HT22 cells.

3.4. Mfn2 overexpression mediated mitochondrial molecular
pathways
To further investigate the molecular mechanisms of the Mfn2mediated reduction in apoptosis, the mitochondrial apoptotic
pathways were identiﬁed. First, as important apoptosis-related
proteins, the Bcl-2 family members, including Bcl-2 and Bax, were
detected by western blot. Following hypoxia, the ratio of Bcl2/Bax was decreased. Strikingly, an increased ratio of Bcl-2/Bax
was identiﬁed in the hypoxic conditions following Mfn2 overexpression compared with the LV-Con groups (Fig. 5A and B;
P < 0.05). Further results indicated increased cleaved caspase 3
expression after hypoxia. And Mfn2 overexpression signiﬁcantly
reduced the increased cleaved caspase 3 in the hypoxic conditions
(Fig. 5C; P < 0.01). Cytochrome c, which is a marker of mitochondrial outer membrane permeability (MOMP) and apoptosis, was
determined using an immunoassay kit after subcellular fraction

preparation. Robust cytochrome c release was identiﬁed after treatment, which suggested apoptosis induced by hypoxia. Also, the
cytochrome c release was signiﬁcantly reduced with Mfn2 overexpression (Fig. 5D; P < 0.05). These results demonstrated that Mfn2
overexpression attenuated apoptosis induced by hypoxia through
the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways.
3.5. Mfn2 overexpression in HT22 cells inhibited increased
phospho-ERK (p-ERK) induced by hypoxia
Consistent with previous viewpoints, pERK was signiﬁcantly
increased after hypoxia (Fig. 6A and B; P < 0.05). However, the pERK
level was signiﬁcantly decreased when Mfn2 was overexpressed
both at baseline in the absence of hypoxia treatment, as well as in
hypoxic conditions (Fig. 6A and B; P < 0.05, P < 0.001). PD98059, the
ERK inhibitor, was used to illustrate the effect of Mfn2. The results
demonstrated that PD98059 efﬁciently down-regulated pERK.

analysis was performed using Mito-tracker and ﬂuorescence following hypoxia (CoCl2 , 300 ␮M for 24 h).

Moreover, Mfn2 overexpression intensiﬁed this effect both in normal or hypoxic conditions. However, PD98059 did not alter Mfn2
expression at baseline in the absence of hypoxia (Fig. 6B, quantitative data not shown), which indicated that Mfn2 may function as
an up-regulator of the ERK signaling pathway. Additionally, mitochondrial morphology was detected following the use of PD98059.
The morphological characteristics were not signiﬁcantly different

between the LV-Con (without PD98059) and LV-Con groups treated
with PD98059 in hypoxic conditions (data not shown), which indicated that the ERK signaling pathway mediated by Mfn2 was
independent of mitochondrial function. It also highlighted Mfn2
signaling effects beyond mitochondrial fusion. These ﬁndings may
provide an alternative explanation of the anti-apoptotic effect of
Mfn2, which may be mediated via the ERK pathway.

4. Discussion
Previous studies have demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction
and fragmentation as primary events in ischemic models; however,
the exact molecular mechanism has remained unclear. Our results
indicated that Mfn2 expression was signiﬁcantly decreased in the
in vitro hypoxic model, which was conﬁrmed in an in vivo ischemic
model. Furthermore, our results supported the protective effects of
Mfn2 in the attenuation of hypoxia-induced apoptosis through upregulation of Mfn2. Finally, the anti-apoptotic mechanisms of Mfn2
may be mediated via restoration of mitochondrial function and
modulation of mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathways. The
present study demonstrated that Mfn2 may mediate mitochondrial
functional and signaling pathways to attenuate hypoxia-induced
apoptosis.
In the present study, Western blot, real-time PCR, and
immunoﬂuorescence were used to identify reduced Mfn2 expression in a hypoxic model of HT22 cells, which was further conﬁrmed
in an in vivo ischemic model. In vitro results also demonstrated
the absence of an altered location of Mfn2 after hypoxic injury
in HT22 cells. To investigate the exact role of Mfn2, shRNA and

LV-Mfn2 vectors were used. Following down-/up-regulation of
Mfn2, the cell viability and apoptotic rates were determined in
hypoxic conditions. The CCK-8 and TUNEL results suggested that
hypoxia-induced apoptosis may be dependent on reduced Mfn2.
In accordance with other reports, the depletion of Mfn2 leads to
several pathological changes, such as ER stress, abnormal Ca2+
homeostasis, mitochondrial fragmentation, and oxidative stress
(Ngoh et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2007; Singaravelu et al., 2011).
Our results also illustrated Mfn2 depletion leads to cell injury
under both normal and hypoxic conditions. However, when Mfn2
was restored using lentivirus, the hypoxia-induced apoptosis was
ameliorated. We suggest that the injury induced by hypoxia was
dependent, in part, on reduced Mfn2. The increased mitochondrial
fusion protected HL-1 cells against cardiac ischemia/reperfusion
injury (IRI) and decreased the susceptibility to mitochondrial
permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening (Ong et al., 2010).
Moreover, Mfn2 overexpression reduced cytochrome c release in
response to staurosorine treatment. However, the overexpression of Mfn1 and Opa1 had no effect on cytochrome c release
or apoptosis in response to a number of apoptotic drugs and

overexpression (Neuspiel et al., 2005; Sheridan et al., 2008). These
ﬁndings illustrated that Mfn2 had other effects, especially the
anti-apoptotic role, in addition to fusion, unlike other fusion proteins. However, Mfn2 has exhibited profound pro-apoptotic effects
in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in several proliferative
diseases. These effects were mediated by the suppression of an Aktdependent cell survival signaling pathway, which resulted in the
activation of mitochondrial apoptotic signaling independent of its
role in mitochondrial fusion (Guo et al., 2007). Nevertheless, this
ﬁnding does not contradict our ﬁndings because the two opposite
effects of Mfn2 may be associated with different cells and pathological disease mechanisms.
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a key characteristic of many diseases, especially Alzheimer’s disease and stroke (Frantseva et al.,
2002). The destruction of the mitochondrial network, MMP and
overproduction of ROS most frequently occur with disrupted mitochondrial homeostasis in cerebral ischemia, and the restoration of
these factors may attenuate injury (Karbowski and Youle, 2003;
Kindler et al., 2003; Piantadosi and Zhang, 1996). In our study, Mitotracker was used to analyze mitochondrial morphology, and the
results indicated that Mfn2 ameliorated mitochondrial fragmentation induced by hypoxia. Furthermore, the mitochondrial oxidative
level, ATP, and MMP were detected to evaluate mitochondrial
function. These results also indicated that Mfn2 may rescue mitochondrial dysfunction induced by hypoxia. Mitochondrial ﬁssion
and fusion are crucial events in the maintenance of mitochondrial
function, rapid repair of mitochondrial damage, and intermixing of
DNA and proteins between mitochondria (Chan, 2006b). A decrease
in connectivity and the formation of short, round mitochondria
occur under conditions that compromise mitochondrial function,
such as mtDNA depletion, or treatment with mitochondrial toxins
(Gilkerson et al., 2000; Legros et al., 2002). These ﬁndings indicate

that the shift from highly branched to fragmented mitochondrial
morphology is most likely regulated by the rates of ﬁssion and
fusion. It has recently been demonstrated that apoptosis induced
control of mitochondrial fragmentation (Frank et al., 2001), which
was restored by inhibition of Drp1, in hypoxia. MMP drives mitochondrial ATP synthesis and can be used to assess mitochondrial
function and integrity. In support of our results, efﬁcient mitochondrial fusion is important as cells defective in fusion exhibit reduced
cell growth, decreased MMP, and defective respiration (Chen et al.,
2005). In our research, a novel reporter gene, Mito-Timer, was
used to illustrate mitochondrial oxidative stress in hypoxia. The
Mito-Timer reporter gene targeted a ﬂuorescent Timer protein to
mitochondria via addition of the mitochondrial targeting sequence
of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIII gene to the N terminus
of the coding region of Timer, under the control of the constitutive CMV promoter. Timer encodes a DsRed mutant (DsRed1-E5)
that ﬂuoresces similar to green ﬂuorescence protein when newly
synthesized and irreversibly shifts the ﬂuorescence spectrum to
red following dehydrogenization of the Tyr-67 residue (Terskikh
et al., 2000; Yarbrough et al., 2001). It has also been used to report
mitochondrial content, structure, stress, and damage under physiological and pathological conditions. The current ﬁndings suggested
that hypoxia induced mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction in HT22 cells, which are likely driven by the hypoxia-induced
reduction of Mfn2. Mfn2 overexpression decreased mitochondrial
fragmentation and dysfunction to attenuate hypoxic injury. Furthermore, another study that involved vascular smooth muscle
cells demonstrated that Mfn2 ameliorates aortic remolding via regulation of mitochondrial function (Wang et al., 2014). Therefore,
these ﬁndings suggest that Mfn2 has a protective role in hypoxiamediated apoptosis that may occur via restoration of mitochondrial
function and morphology.

Furthermore, in our investigation of the exact molecular
mechanisms, Mfn2 overexpression increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio,
which was signiﬁcantly decreased after hypoxic injury. Mfn2
also reduced the increased cleaved-caspase 3 level that resulted
from hypoxic conditions. Thus, Mfn2 modulated the Bcl-2 family
members and their downstream pathways and subsequently
inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis. These ﬁndings suggest that
Mfn2 may attenuate hypoxic injury not only via the restoration
of mitochondrial function but also the modulation of speciﬁc
apoptotic pathways. Bcl-2 family members comprise classic
apoptosis-related molecules, which mainly include the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2/Bcl-XL and the pro-apoptotic proteins
Bax/Bak (Anilkumar and Prehn, 2014). The ratio of anti- and proapoptotic protein expression, such as Bcl-2/Bax, is crucial for the
induction of apoptosis, and it determines the cellular susceptibility
to apoptosis (Cory and Adams, 2002; Erfani et al., 2015). Increased
Bcl-2 or decreased Bax may reduce cytochrome c release and the
activation of caspase 3 and procaspase-9. Accumulating evidence
has demonstrated a signaling role for Mfn2 in the regulation of
apoptosis that extends beyond its role in mitochondrial fusion,
which activates Mfn2 to block mitochondrial fragmentation and
protect neurons against acute injury (Jahani-Asl et al., 2007).
As previously discussed, the mitochondrial pathway activated in
response to cellular stress or damage is regulated by the interaction
of Bcl-2 family members with Mfn2 expression. Several studies
have reported that Mfn2/Drp1/Bax interacted with each other
following stimulation, which led to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), promoted cytochrome c release,
and activated executioner caspase 3 (Sheridan and Martin, 2010).
Mfn2 directly interacts with Bcl-Xl in HEK293 cells, which further

suggests a mechanism for protective cross-talk with anti-apoptotic
Bcl-family proteins. Furthermore, apoptotic stimuli release Baxdependent pro-apoptotic factors from mitochondria to cytosol
and subsequently modulate cell death (Delivani et al., 2006). Mfn2
colocalizes with Bax and Drp1 at sites of future mitochondria
ﬁssion, and Mfn2 may directly interact with Bax to perform
important roles (Karbowski et al., 2002). These studies indicate
that the execution of several Mfn2-mediated functions may
occur in conjunction with Bcl-2 family members, especially Bax.
Consistent with previous reports, our ﬁndings indicated that Mfn2
regulates hypoxia-mediated apoptosis via Bcl-2 family pathways
and subsequently controls downstream signaling pathways.
It is noteworthy that Bcl-2 family members may also inﬂuence
mitochondrial function after brain ischemia, including mitochondrial respiratory function, ROS production, MMP depletion, and
calcium homeostasis. However, there are no obvious conclusions
in this complicated relationship between Bcl-2 family members
and mitochondrial fusion/ﬁssion proteins. Our results suggest that
the role of Mfn2-mediated restoration of mitochondrial function
may occur via Bcl-2 signaling pathways. Bcl-2 family members may
promote mitochondrial ﬁssion during apoptosis via inhibition of
fusion or acceleration of ﬁssion events (Montessuit et al., 2010).
Based on previous reports and the current results, our group suggests that Mfn2 may alter the mitochondrial membrane structure
via interaction with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members, which thereby
triggers a signaling cascade and inhibits MPTP opening; the proapoptotic molecules are thereby prevented from translocating into
the cytoplasm, and mitochondrial function is restored (Galloway
et al., 2012). Thus, the ﬁrst hypothesis described suggests that Bcl-2
members are the central player in the stimulus, whereas our views
support Mfn2 as a crucial component.
Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) regulate diverse
cellular programs, including embryogenesis, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Raman et al., 2007). The effects of
ERK pathways in apoptosis have been investigated previously
(Gladbach et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014). pERK is upregulated in
hypoxia-induced apoptosis in multiple cell types (Haddad and
Hanbali, 2014; Liu et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013). Our results
demonstrated that Mfn2 overexpression reduced the increased
pERK level that was signiﬁcantly increased after hypoxia. Thus,
the role of Mfn2 in hypoxia-induced apoptosis may occur via
ERK-mediated pathways. We subsequently used the ERK inhibitor
PD98059 to determine the Mfn2 level and mitochondrial function, which were not signiﬁcantly affected by PD98059. This result
may be attributed to the absence of direct interaction or a limited
effect of PD98059 under our experimental conditions. Furthermore, the direct and indirect interactions of ERK1/2 with many
molecules are very complicated. For example, the ERK-Bcl-2/Bax
signaling pathways are important in the regulation of apoptosis.
The inhibition of ERK-induced down-regulated Bax and upregulated Bcl-2 leads to reduced apoptosis (Li et al., 2014; Yating
et al., 2014). Bcl-2/Bax may represent downstream signals of ERK.
Therefore, ERK may be an intermediate regulator between Mfn2
and Bcl-2/Bax, which was not detected in our study. Overall,
these ﬁndings highlight a signaling role for Mfn2 in the regulation of apoptosis that extends beyond its role in mitochondrial
fusion.
Mitochondrial dynamics facilitate the exchange of materials
between organelles and repair of defective mitochondria. Defects
in mitochondrial dynamics promote neurodegenerative diseases.
Therefore, an understanding of the function of mitochondrial ﬁssion and fusion regulators enables the elucidation of their roles
in diseases. Therefore, it is important to identify the role of
fusion/ﬁssion proteins in different diseases. Previous reports have
suggested that Opa1 silencing or Drp1 overexpression caused both
mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis. Thus, it is possible that

C. Peng et al. / The International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology 69 (2015) 29–40

Drp1 expression or Opa1 silencing not only provides a ﬁssion signal
but also an apoptotic signal (Olichon et al., 2003). These results indicate the importance of homeostasis between mitochondrial fusion
and ﬁssion events. Disrupted homeostasis may trigger mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of signaling pathways resulting in
apoptosis.
Several experimental limitations should be considered in the
interpretation of these ﬁndings. First, HT22 cells but not primary
cortical neurons were used in all in vitro investigations. Second, the
in vivo investigations were limited, and the in vitro results were not
completely veriﬁed in vivo. Recent evidence has emphasized the
role of Mfn2 not only in mitochondrial function but also in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, calcium homeostasis, and autophagy
(i.e., mitophagy) (Gegg et al., 2010; Schneeberger et al., 2013;
Singaravelu et al., 2011). Additional studies will be conducted to
identify other mechanisms that underlie the relationship between
Mfn2 and cerebral ischemia, such as autophagy in primary cultures
of cortical neurons.
In summary, the present results indicate that hypoxia-induced
apoptosis may depend on reduced Mfn2 expression. However, the
restoration of Mfn2 expression may attenuate apoptosis, which
suggests a potential therapeutic strategy for ischemic diseases
associated with hypoxia. Cellular apoptosis may be prevented via
modulation of mitochondrial functions and apoptotic pathways,
which thereby results in neuroprotective effects.
