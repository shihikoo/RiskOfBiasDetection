Background and Purpose—Ly6Chi monocytes are generally thought to exert a proinflammatory role in acute tissue injury,
although their impact after injuries to the central nervous system is poorly defined. CC chemokine receptor 2 is expressed
on Ly6Chi monocytes and plays an essential role in their extravasation and transmigration into the brain after cerebral
ischemia. We used a selective CC chemokine receptor 2 antagonist, INCB3344, to assess the effect of Ly6Chi monocytes
recruited into the brain early after ischemic stroke.
Methods—Male C57Bl/6J mice underwent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery for 1 hour followed by 23 hours of
reperfusion. Mice were administered either vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide/carboxymethylcellulose) or INCB3344 (10, 30 or
100 mg/kg IP) 1 hour before ischemia and at 2 and 6 hours after ischemia. At 24 hours, we assessed functional outcomes,
infarct volume, and quantified the immune cells in blood and brain by flow cytometry or immunofluorescence. Gene
expression of selected inflammatory markers was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
Results—Ly6Chi monocytes were increased 3-fold in the blood and 10-fold in the brain after stroke, and these increases were
selectively prevented by INCB3344 in a dose-dependent manner. Mice treated with INCB3344 exhibited markedly worse
functional outcomes and larger infarct volumes, in association with reduced M2 polarization and increased peroxynitrite
production in macrophages, compared with vehicle-treated mice.
Conclusions—Our data suggest that Ly6Chi monocytes exert an acute protective effect after ischemic stroke to limit brain
injury and functional deficit that involves promotion of M2 macrophage polarization.   (Stroke. 2015;46:1929-1937.

A

fter ischemic stroke there is an extensive inflammatory
response in the brain, which involves both proliferation
of resident microglia and recruitment of circulating leukocytes such as monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages.1,2 Generation of specific chemokines within a few
hours at the site of injury facilitates and coordinates the selective recruitment, adhesion, and transmigration of leukocytes
via interactions with their chemokine receptor(s) expressed
on the circulating immune cells.3 As leukocyte activation in
association with postischemic inflammation contributes to
secondary brain injury,4,5 pharmacological targeting of chemokine receptors may be an attractive means to selectively
exclude immune cells that might worsen acute damage in the
initial period after a stroke.6,7
The influence of monocytes/macrophages on brain infarct
development and stroke outcome is not well defined. The 2
common types of murine monocytes are classified by their

level of Ly6C expression: Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo. Ly6Chi monocytes are thought to typically exert a proinflammatory role in
tissue injury, and they require their CC chemokine receptor
2 (CCR2) for mobilization and transmigration from the bone
marrow into sites of inflammation.8–10 Indeed, CCR2 is predominantly expressed on Ly6Chi monocytes,11 but is also on a
small number of Ly6Clo monocytes, activated T cells, natural
killer cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells.12 CCR2 is activated by its chemokine ligands, in particular chemokine (C-C
motif) ligand (CCL2), but also CCL7, CCL8, and CCL13.
CCL2 has been identified as an important chemokine involved
in postischemic inflammation and disruption of the blood–
brain barrier after stroke.6,13,14 There is, however, recent evidence for protective effects of Ly6Chi monocytes recruited via
CCR2 during inflammation, which challenges the dogma that
Ly6Chi monocytes are necessarily detrimental through promotion of secondary injury after myocardial infarction15 and in

hemorrhagic infarct transformation after cerebral ischemia.16
Furthermore, there is evidence that CCR2/CCL2 mechanisms
are important for the migration of neuroblasts from neurogenic
regions to damaged regions of brain after cerebral ischemia in
mice, suggesting a role in tissue recovery after stroke.17 Thus,
for the development of future therapies to target detrimental
elements of the poststroke acute inflammatory response, it is
vital to clarify the role of CCR2+/Ly6Chi monocytes.
To our knowledge, no study has examined the effect of a
selective CCR2 antagonist in ischemic stroke. INCB3344 is a
novel CCR2 antagonist that inhibits the binding of CCL2 to
monocytes with high potency and it is highly selective for the
CCR2 receptor.18 It effectively reduces monocyte/macrophage
accumulation in autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice and
in inflammatory arthritis in rats18 and in deoxycorticosterone
acetate/salt-induced hypertension in mice.19 Its potency and
selectivity for CCR2 inhibition have thus been used in this
study to evaluate the effect of inhibiting Ly6Chi monocyte
migration to the brain early during poststroke inflammation.

Materials and Methods
Animals
This study was approved by the Monash University Animal Ethics
Committee (Project MARP/2011/112) and performed in accordance
with the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia
guidelines for the care and use of animals in research. A total of 102
male C57Bl/6 mice were studied (aged 8–12 weeks; 28±3 g). All
mice had free access to water and food pellets and were kept in specific pathogen-free cages at 21°C.

Vehicle or INCB3344 Treatment
Mice were randomly assigned to receive intraperitoneal injections
of vehicle (10% dimethyl sulfoxide/0.9% carboxymethylcellulose;
n=40) or INCB3344 at doses of 10 mg/kg (n=6), 30 mg/kg (n=33),
or 100 mg/kg (n=12) at 1 hour before stroke or sham surgery. Vehicle
or INCB3344 administration was repeated at 2 and 6 hours after reperfusion or sham surgery. Total dosage of INCB3344 was therefore
30, 90, or 300 mg/kg, respectively. Investigators were blinded to the
groups for which each animal was assigned. A further 11 sham-operated animals that did not receive any treatment were also studied.

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Mice underwent either sham surgery (n=25) or 1 hour of cerebral ischemia (n=77) as described previously.20,21 Briefly, mice were anesthetized and the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded with
a nylon monofilament with silicone-coated tip, resulting in severe reduction (>70%) of blood flow to the MCA region, which was recorded
by transcranial laser-Doppler flowmetry. The monofilament was retracted after 1 hour, allowing reperfusion to occur. Reperfusion was
confirmed by an increase in regional cerebral blood flow, which was
measured by transcranial laser-Doppler flowmetry. Concurrent shamoperated control animals underwent all procedures except ligation of
arteries and insertion of the monofilament. Mice were monitored until they regained consciousness and were then returned to their cages
(details of the MCA occlusion surgery is available in the online-only
Data Supplement). Four mice were excluded from the study because
of technical problems during surgery (n=2) or to death before the designated time for euthanasia (n=2). No evidence of hemorrhagic transformation was observed in the brain after cerebral ischemia.

Neurological Assessment
Neurological deficit scoring and hanging grip tests were performed
30 minutes before euthanasia, as described.1 Briefly, neurological

deficit was assessed using a 5-point scoring system (0–4) in which a
score of 0 represents normal motor function and 4 indicates no spontaneous motor activity. A hanging grip test was performed in which
mice were suspended by their forelimbs for ≤60 s on a wire 60 cm
above foam padding, and the average latency to fall was recorded
from 3 trials.

Flow Cytometric Analysis
At 24 hours after stroke or sham surgery, mice were euthanized by
isoflurane overdose. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and
mice were then perfused with PBS, followed by decapitation. The
brain was removed from the skull and, after removing the cerebellum, the ischemic (right) hemisphere was collected for flow cytometry analysis. Leukocytes were isolated from blood and brain tissues
for multicolor flow cytometry, as previously described21 (detailed
protocol of flow cytometry is available in the online-only Data
Supplement).

Infarct Analysis
Consecutive coronal brain sections (30 μm) were obtained every
420 μm throughout the brain and stained with 0.1% thionin to delineate the infarct. Images were captured using a CCD camera with
a light source and analyzed using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda,
MD). Infarct volume and hemispheric swelling were calculated as
described previously.1

Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction
At 24 hours after stroke or sham surgery, mice were euthanized by
isoflurane overdose and perfused with RNAse-free PBS. After removing the cerebellum, the right hemisphere of the brain was snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA extracted from whole ischemic hemispheres was reversed transcribed into cDNA. Levels of RNA expression of selected genes, including Arg1, CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, CCL12,
interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α, and Ym-1
were measured using predesigned Taqman gene expression assays.
Protocols for quantitative polymerase chain reaction are available in
the online-only Data Supplement.

Immunofluorescence for 3-Nitrotyrosine and F4/80
Double-labeled immunofluorescence for 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT; peroxynitrite marker) and F4/80 (macrophage/microglial cell marker)
was performed on 10-μm coronal brain sections using methods similar to those reported previously.22 Detailed protocol of immunofluorescence studies is available in the online-only Data Supplement.

Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean±SEM, except for nonparametric neurological deficit scores for which individual data points and median values are indicated. Statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA). Infarct
volume was compared by Student unpaired t test. Other data were
analyzed by 1-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc tests, except
for neurological deficit scores, which were compared using a Mann–
Whitney test. A robust regression and outlier test was used to identify
statistical outliers. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Effect of a CCR2 Antagonist on
Infiltration of Immune Cells Into the
Brain After Cerebral Ischemia
At 24 hours after cerebral ischemia, there was a 4-fold increase
in the total number of leukocytes, and a 6-fold increase in the
CCR2+ leukocyte subpopulation (ie, 10%–15% of total leukocytes), present in the ischemic hemisphere of vehicle-treated

mice compared with sham controls (Figure 1A). INCB3344
treatment, at a dose of 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg (3× daily), had
no overall effect on total leukocytes but dose dependently
reduced CCR2+ leukocytes in the ischemic brain (Figure 1A).
Among the ≈7000 total leukocytes (CD45hi) infiltrating the
ischemic brain at 24 hours, monocytes (≈12%), neutrophils
(≈35%), and T cells (≈10%) were all prominent (Figure 1A–
1D). Of note, there was a ≈7-fold increase in total monocytes
(ie, both Ly6C+CCR2+ and Ly6C+CCR2−) after stroke in vehicle-treated mice, and this increase was almost completely prevented by the 2 highest doses of INCB3344 (Figure 1B). By
contrast, INCB3344 had no significant effect on total numbers
of neutrophils or T cells in the ischemic brain after cerebral
ischemia (Figure 1C and 1D).

The CCR2+ leukocytes entering the brain after ischemia
consisted mainly of neutrophils (≈50%), monocytes (≈33%),
and T cells (≈7%; Figure 1A–1D). INCB3344 treatment
largely prevented the infiltration of CCR2+ monocytes and
CCR2+ neutrophils but did not affect the number of CCR2+
T cells in the ischemic brain (Figure 1A–1D). Based on these
data, 30 mg/kg was selected as an optimal dose of INCB3344
for study in the remaining experiments.

Effect of INCB3344 on Circulating Immune Cells
After Cerebral Ischemia
Compared with sham animals, the total number of circulating
leukocytes was not different at 24 hours after cerebral ischemia
in vehicle-treated mice and was not affected by INCB3344

treatment (Figure 2A). Among individual cell types, total
numbers of monocytes and neutrophils in the blood tended to
increase after stroke, whereas T cells were reduced, but only
circulating monocytes (≈5% of total leukocytes) were reduced
by INCB3344 (Figure 2A–2D). Circulating CCR2+ leukocytes
consisted of ≈85% monocytes and the ≈2-fold increase after
cerebral ischemia was prevented by INCB3344 (Figure 2A
and 2B). There was no effect of INCB3344 on circulating
CCR2+ neutrophils or CCR2+ T cells (Figure 2C and 2D).

Consistent with this concept, a more detailed analysis of the
monocyte subpopulations in blood revealed Ly6Chi monocytes to be selectively increased (whereas Ly6Clo monocytes
were reduced) after stroke, and that INCB3344 prevented
the increase in Ly6Chi cells (Figure 3A and 3B; Figure I
in the online-only Data Supplement). Similarly, Ly6Chi
monocytes represent the majority of monocytes in the brain
after stroke, and this increase was effectively inhibited by
INCB3344 (Figure 3C and 3D; Figure II in the online-only
Data Supplement).

INCB3344 Selectively Reduced Circulating and
Infiltrating Ly6Chi Monocytes Into the Brain

Gene Expression of CCR2 Ligands

Most circulating CCR2+ monocytes express high levels of
Ly6C, and these CCR2+Ly6Chi monocytes are presumed
to be proinflammatory in that they are typically recruited
to inflamed tissue in a CCR2-dependent manner, where
they may produce Th1-type proinflammatory cytokines.23

Expression of CCR2 ligands, CCL2, CCL7, and CCL12, each
markedly increased in the brain after stroke (by 25- to 180fold; Figure 4), whereas expression of CCL8 was not altered.
Treatment with INCB3344 had no effect on expression of any
of these CCR2 ligands.

Effect of INB3344 on Stroke Outcome
Cerebral blood flow to the cortical region supplied by the
MCA was reduced by ≈80% in animals subjected to MCA
occlusion in both vehicle and INCB treatment groups.
Treatment with INCB3344 did not affect the levels of reperfusion compared with vehicle (Figure III in the online-only Data
Supplement). In vehicle-treated mice, cerebral ischemia–
reperfusion resulted in neurological deficit and reduced hanging grip time compared with sham-operated mice (Figure 5A
and 5B; P<0.05). Treatment with INCB3344 had no effect on
these parameters in sham mice, but markedly exacerbated the
functional deficits after stroke (Figure 5A and 5B; P<0.05).
Representative coronal brain sections from vehicle- and
INCB3344-treated animals at 24 hours after cerebral ischemia are shown in Figure 5C. There was a ≈50% larger infarct

present in INCB3344-treated mice compared with vehicle
controls (Figure 5D; P<0.05). This effect of INCB3344 was
mostly because of a larger subcortical infarct, but there was
also a trend for proportionally similar increases in cortical
infarct volume and hemispheric swelling compared with vehicle-treated mice (Figure 5D).

Effect of INB3344 on Macrophages and Microglia
After Stroke
To better understand the mechanisms underlying the effect of
INCB3344 treatment to exacerbate poststroke brain injury in
association with fewer monocytes in the circulation and infiltrating the brain, we assessed the number of macrophages and
microglia in the brain and expression levels of some inflammation-related genes associated with macrophage polarization.

First, neither the increased number of macrophages (CD45hi/
CD11b+/F4/80+) nor microglia (CD45med/CD11b+/F4/80+) in
the brain after stroke was significantly affected by INCB3344,
although there was a trend for even more microglial cells
(Figure 6A). As monocytes are a key influence on the polarization state of macrophages, we assessed the levels of genes
associated with M1 (classically activated proinflammatory)
or M2 (alternatively activated anti-inflammatory) cells. We
found that cerebral ischemia resulted in marked upregulation
of genes associated with both M1 (ie, tumor necrosis factor,
IL-6, IL-1β; by 20- to 170-fold) and M2 (ie, Ym1, Arg1, IL-10;
by 10- to 20-fold) polarization in the brain (Figure 6B and
6C). However, although INCB3344 had no effect on M1 gene
expression (Figure 6B), it virtually prevented the increases in
expression of the M2 markers Ym1 and Arg1 and also tended
to reduce IL-10 expression (Figure 6C), reflecting much lower
levels of M2-polarized macrophages in the poststroke brain.

Effect of INB3344 on the Proportion of M1
Polarized Macrophages After Stroke
Brain sections double-labeled using immunofluorescence
against 3-NT (peroxynitrite/M1 marker; green) and F4/80
(macrophage marker; red) revealed a ≈3-fold increase in the
proportion of F4/80+ cells that also expressed 3-NT in the
ischemic brain after cerebral ischemia, compared with sham
brains (Figure 6D). Furthermore, despite having an equivalent total number of macrophages (Figure 6A; Figure IV in
the online-only Data Supplement), brains from INCB3344treated animals contained a 2-fold greater proportion of
these cells that were 3-NT+ (ie, M1-polarized, indicated
by yellow arrow in representative image; Figure 6D) compared with vehicle-treated mice after stroke. The number
and morphology of F4/80-stained cells in brain sections
were consistent with those cells being macrophages and not
microglia.

Discussion
There are several major findings of this study that provide
novel insight into the roles of circulating CCR2+ leukocytes,
particularly Ly6Chi monocytes, entering the blood and infiltrating the brain early after cerebral ischemia. First, we found
that stroke markedly and selectively increases Ly6Chi monocyte numbers in the blood and in the ischemic brain within
24 hours. Second, treatment with a selective CCR2 antagonist
(INCB3344) strikingly prevents these increases in monocyte
numbers without affecting levels of CCR2 ligands in the brain.
Third, the effect of INCB3344 after stroke involves a substantial reduction in the ratio of M2:M1 polarized macrophages
in the poststroke brain and results in increased infarct volume and exacerbated functional deficits. The findings therefore indicate that the influx of circulating monocytes plays
an important protective role via promoting M2 macrophage
polarization to limit the development of inflammation-related
brain injury in the early stages after ischemic stroke.
Murine monocytes are commonly classified into 2 subsets
according to their level of Ly6C expression. Ly6Chi monocytes
express high levels of CCR2 and are recruited rapidly to sites
of infection or inflammation. By contrast, Ly6Clo monocytes
express low levels of CCR2 and are thought to function as
patrolling immune cells that migrate along the luminal surface of blood vessels and monitor endothelial cells.24,25 Using

flow cytometry, we characterized the profile of major immune
cells circulating in the blood and entering the brain early after
stroke, and we identified an optimal dose of INCB3344 for
inhibiting CCR2+ cell infiltration. Although there was no
net effect of stroke on the total number of circulating leukocytes, there was a profound increase in the proportion of
monocytes (from ≈20% to >40%), which were predominantly
Ly6ChiCCR2+, whereas T cells were reduced by >50%. More
than 10% of leukocytes infiltrating the ischemic brain were
monocytes, and INCB3344 treatment selectively blocked
this process as well as the stroke-induced monocytosis. This
is consistent with previous findings indicating that CCR2 is
critical for the extravasation of Ly6Chi monocytes from bone
marrow and migration into inflamed tissue.26,27 Furthermore,
treatment with INCB3344 had no effect on the gene expression of CCR2 ligands (CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, and CCL12) in
the brain after stroke, suggesting that INCB3344 inhibited
monocyte migration at the receptor level, without affecting
the level of chemoattractant signaling.
Our study has clearly shown that pharmacological inhibition of CCR2+ monocyte infiltration into the brain is associated with worsened acute stroke outcome. Previous work has
suggested that CCR2-dependent recruitment of Ly6Chi monocytes can promote M1-polarization of macrophages, which
may then exacerbate ischemic damage in the myocardium.28

However, there is recent evidence that Ly6Chi monocytes may
contribute to both the inflammatory and the reparative phases
occurring in the heart after myocardial infarction.15 Here, we
found that CCR2 inhibition selectively reduced the number of
Ly6Chi monocytes in the blood and brain after stroke in association with increased infarct development and exacerbated
motor impairment, strongly suggesting a protective effect of
these cells in limiting acute brain injury. Our finding is consistent with other evidence for protective effects of Ly6Chi
monocytes in the brain during central nervous system injuries
involving inflammation, such as spinal cord injury29 and hemorrhagic infarct transformation.16
To better understand the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of Ly6Chi monocytes, we assessed postischemic changes in gene expression of several inflammatory
markers involved in M1/M2 polarization of macrophages.
Although ischemia promoted macrophage infiltration associated with increased expression of both M1 and M2 polarization markers, INCB3344 treatment selectively blocked the
increase in expression of M2 markers. Consistent with this
finding, INCB3344 treatment also markedly increased the
proportion of brain macrophages expressing 3-NT (a marker
of peroxynitrite30), indicative of greater M1 polarization and
less M2 polarization of macrophages. M2-polarized macrophages are known to exhibit anti-inflammatory and phagocytotic functions, as well as produce growth factors important
for wound healing and repair.31 It was recently demonstrated
that newly recruited macrophages exhibit an M2 phenotype
at early stages (1–3 days) after stroke in mice,32 and several
studies have suggested that M2 macrophages can contribute to
central nervous system repair by promoting neuronal survival
and axon growth.32,33 Taken together, our data provide strong
new evidence that Ly6Chi monocytes enter the circulation and
then the ischemic brain during the acute poststroke period and
serve to limit inflammatory and oxidative injury by promoting M2 macrophage polarization. Our results show that without the entry of these Ly6Chi monocytes into the poststroke
brain, a much greater extent of M1 macrophage polarization
ensues, resulting in a larger infarct and a more severe functional outcome.
It is noteworthy that our findings contrast conceptually
with those made in CCR2−/− mice.34 Importantly, we found
that acute CCR2 inhibition did not affect expression of CCR2
ligands, particularly its main ligand CCL2, in the brain after
stroke. This is a key difference from mice with preexisting
lifelong global CCR2 deletion, which had smaller infarcts,
less hemispheric swelling, and fewer infiltrating neutrophils,
but in which CCL2 expression in the postischemic brain was
significantly lower than in wild-type controls.34 As CCL2
plays a powerful role in disruption of the blood–brain barrier
during cerebral ischemia,14 it is possible that CCR2−/− mice are
protected from postischemic brain injury as an indirect result
of reduced CCL2-dependent blood–brain barrier permeability. Here, INCB3344 treatment was initiated 1 hour before
cerebral ischemia to eliminate early infiltration of monocytes
into the brain after stroke. Although it had no effect on either
CCL2 levels in the brain after stroke or on functional outcome
of sham animals, we cannot rule out the possibility of a briefly

altered baseline inflammatory profile immediately before
ischemia. Any such effect would not, however, influence the
interpretation of our data.
Our findings provide new insight into the role of CCR2+/
Ly6Chi monocytes infiltrating the postischemic brain.
Although it is possible that these monocytes may develop
into M2-polarized macrophages at early stages of ischemia–
reperfusion, we postulate that they instead play a key role in
promoting polarization of adjacent macrophages toward an
M2 phenotype. The data clearly suggest that Ly6Chi monocytes do not always exert detrimental proinflammatory
actions that contribute to secondary tissue injury, but seem
to in fact modulate early postischemic brain inflammation
to limit infarct development, resulting in milder functional
impairment and potentially contributing to early stages of
recovery. As a result, pharmacological targeting of CCR2+/
Ly6Chi monocytes is unlikely to provide benefits after cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion.

Supplemental Methods
Middle cerebral artery occlusion
Mice were anesthetised with a mixture of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), and
body temperature was maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5°C throughout the surgery using a heat lamp. A
midline incision was made, and connective tissue was teased away to expose the common
carotid artery (CCA). After cauterizing a branch of the external carotid artery, that artery was
ligated distal to the bifurcation of the CCA. Focal ischemia was induced by occlusion of the
right middle cerebral artery (MCA) using a nylon monofilament with silicone-coated tip
(0.20-0.22 mm, Doccol Co., Redlands, CA, USA). Transcranial laser-Doppler flowmetry
(Perimed, Jarfalla, Sweden) was used to confirm a severe reduction (>70%) in regional
cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the area of cerebral cortex supplied by the MCA. Mice in
which there was <70% or >93% reduction in rCBF were excluded from the study (n=1). The
filament was withdrawn after 1 h to allow reperfusion. Reperfusion did not occur in one
animal which was excluded from the study. Wounds were sutured and covered with betadine
and spray dressing (Smith and Nephew, Hull, UK). Concurrent sham-operated control
animals underwent all procedures except ligation of arteries. Mice were monitored until they
regained consciousness and were then returned to their cages.
Flow cytometric analysis
At 24 h after stroke or sham surgery, euthanasia was performed by isoflurane overdose. Blood
was collected by cardiac puncture and mice were then perfused with phosphate buffered
saline (PBS), followed by decapitation. Blood leukocytes were purified using red blood cell
lysis buffer (155 mmol/L NH4Cl, 10 mmol/L KHCO3, 3 mmol/L EDTA). The brain was
removed from the skull and, after removing the cerebellum, the right (ischemic) hemisphere
was collected for flow cytometry analysis. Leukocytes and microglia were isolated from brain
tissue as described previously1. Cells were then washed and resuspended in buffer (0.5%
bovine serum albumin in PBS) containing a mixture of antibodies, including allophycocyanin
(APC)-Cy7 anti-CD45, fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-Ly6C, phycoerythrin (PE)-Cy7 antiLy6G, V500 anti-CD3, PE-conjugated CD49b, PE-conjugated NK1.1, PE-conjugated B220,
PE-conjugated CD90.2, brilliant violet 605-F4/80 (all from Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA),
Pacific Blue anti-CD11b (both from eBiosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) and APC-CCR2
(R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). After staining, cells were analysed by LSRII (BD
Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) and FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).
Countbright counting beads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were included to estimate the
number of cells in the samples.
Quantitative PCR
At 24 h after stroke or sham surgery, mice were euthanised by isoflurane overdose, and
perfused with RNAse-free PBS. After removing the cerebellum, the brain was separated into
left and right hemispheres and whole ischemic (right) brain hemispheres were snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction. RNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro Kit-RNA
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), quantified using the Nanodrop 1000D spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and followed by cDNA conversion using RT2 First
Strand Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Pre-designed Taqman gene expression assays were
used to measure RNA expression of selected genes, including Arg1, CCL2, CCL7, CCL8,
CCL12, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and Ym-1. GAPDH (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) expression was used as a house-keeping gene for reference. Expression data were thus

2

normalised to GAPDH and presented as fold-change compared to sham using the comparative
CT method2.
Immunofluorescence for 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and F4/80
To determine if macrophages are colocalised with 3-NT, double-labelled immunofluorescence
was performed using a 3-NT antibody and a macrophage-specific antibody, F4/80. Frozen
brains were sectioned (10 µm) and thaw-mounted onto poly-L-lysine coated slides. Multiple
serial coronal brain sections that spanned the infarct region were taken for analysis. Sections
were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min, washed in 0.01M PBS (3x 10 min) and
blocked with 10 % goat serum and a Mouse on Mouse Ig blocking reagent for 1 h. Sections
were then incubated with a mouse 3-NT antibody (1:50, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and rat
F4/80 antibody (1:100, AbD Serotec, Kidlington, UK) overnight in a humidified chamber.
The following day, sections were washed in 0.01M PBS (3x 10 min) and incubated in goat
anti-rat Alexa Fluor 594 (1:500, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) secondary antibody for 2 h.
Brain sections were then washed in 0.01M PBS (3 x 10 min) and incubated in biotinylated
anti-mouse IgG reagent (Vector Laboratories, CA, USA) for 10 min. After washing in 0.01M
PBS (3 x 10 min), fluorescein avidin DCS (Vector Laboratories, CA, USA) was applied onto
the sections for 5 min. Sections were washed in 0.01 M PBS (3 x 10 min), coverslipped, and
examined using an Olympus fluorescence microscope. Numbers of 3-NT+ cells and F4/80+
cells in the right (ischemic) hemisphere were counted for each brain section. Data were
presented as percentage of 3NT+ cells of total F4/80+ cells. Researchers were blinded during
the experiment and all appropriate controls for primary and secondary antibodies were
performed.
