Visual Diagnosis

Artery Stroke

A 23-day-old girl with a history of transposition of the
great arteries, ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis,
and placement of right modiﬁed Blalock-Taussig shunt
complicated by thrombosis at age 9 days of life presented
with episodes of upper extremity extension and gasping
respirations concerning for seizure. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an extensive, acute right
middle carotid artery territory stroke with occlusion of the
right proximal middle carotid artery. There was also a small
left frontal stroke. Diffusion restriction abnormalities with
simultaneous presence of hyperintensity on T2 sequences in
the corticospinal tract consistent with early Wallerian
degeneration were observed (Figure).1
Discussion

Wallerian degeneration represents antegrade axonal
degeneration after an insult to the cell body.2 Signal abnormalities within the descending corticospinal tract on
diffusion-weighted imaging are a marker of underlying
parenchymal atrophy, gliosis, and myelin loss.2 Early

Wallerian degeneration is be a predictor of poor recovery
from motor deﬁcits in pediatric ischemic stroke patients3
and neonates with hemorrhage4; therefore, brain magnetic resonance imaging could be used as a valuable prognostic tool in these patients.

Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging at 22 days of age revealed diffusion restriction abnormalities in the right middle carotid artery territory (A).
Wallerian degeneration within the right corticospinal tract at the level of internal capsule (A), midbrain (B), rostral pons (C), and caudal pons (D) is depicted
