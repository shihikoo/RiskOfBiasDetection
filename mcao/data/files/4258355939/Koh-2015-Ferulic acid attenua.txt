Ferulic acid provides neuroprotective effects against a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced
cerebral ischemia. Mitogen-activated protein kinases can regulate extensive intracellular processes
including cell differentiation, growth, and death. This study further investigated whether ferulic acid
modulates a protective mechanism through the activation of Raf-MEK-ERK and its downstream targets, including 90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) and Bad during cerebral ischemic injury. Male
Sprague–Dawley rats were treated with ferulic acid (100 mg/kg) or vehicle after the onset of MCAO
and brain tissues were collected 24 h after MCAO. These results indicated that ferulic acid decreases the
volume of the infarct area and the number of cells positive in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Although MCAO injury induces a decrease in the phosphorylation of Raf-1, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2, ferulic acid treatment prevents the injury-induced decrease in these
phosphorylation levels. Ferulic acid also attenuates the injury-induced decrease in p90RSK and Bad phosphorylation levels. These ﬁndings suggest that ferulic acid prevents MCAO-induced neuronal cell death
and that the MEK-ERK-p90RSK-Bad signaling pathway is involved in these neuroprotective effects.

Cerebral ischemia induces serious brain damage through the overproduction of oxidative stress and the destruction of energy
metabolism [1,3]. Polyphenols, such as ferulic acid, exist ubiquitously in plants and play essential roles in cell growth and
development as well as serve a protective function against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and stroke
[5,6,23]. Ferulic acid acts as an antioxidant agent against radical oxidation in neuronal cell culture systems [12] and also exerts a neuroprotective effect through inhibition of apoptosis in focal cerebral
ischemic injury [5,6]. Moreover, ferulic acid provides considerable
protection against various oxidative stress related disorders [26].
Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase is a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that modulate extensive cellular

function such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and death [20].
The p44/42 MAP kinase (ERK1/2) signaling pathway, which interacts with extracellular stimuli such as growth factors and mitogens,
is known as growth factor signaling [2,19,24]. The Raf protein is the
most important up-stream activator of MAP kinase. Raf activates
MEK1/2 through phosphorylation; phosphorylated MEK1/2 then
phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2. Moreover, ERK1/2 regulates
the down-stream targets of MAP kinase such as 90 kDa ribosomal
S6 kinase (p90RSK) and transcription factor Elk-1 [7,14,18,22] . The
phosphorylation of p90RSK by ERK1/2 leads to the phosphorylation of Bad which results in the inhibition of the apoptotic function
of Bad [4,8,25]. Previous studies have been demonstrated the relation of ferulic acid and ERK kinase signaling [10,11,16,17]. Ferulic
acid prevents cells death from radiation-induced oxidative stress
and amyloid ␤-induced neurotoxicity through the activation of Akt
and ERK signaling pathways [10,16]. Moreover, the ERK signaling
pathway controls the anti-oxidation of ferulic acid by regulating

the expression of the antioxidant enzyme, also play important
roles in the protective effect of sodium ferulate against glutamate
toxicity in cortical neurons [11,17]. I previously reported that ferulic acid exerts a neuroprotective effect by activation of the Akt
signaling pathway in focal cerebral ischemia [13]. Although previous studies have been demonstrated the neuroprotective effect
of ferulic acid, the precise neuroprotective mechanism by ferulic
acid treatment in MCAO remains unclear. Moreover, little data is
available regarding the regulation of ERK kinase by ferulic acid in a
MCAO animal model. I propose that ferulic acid treatment regulates
the MEK/ERK/p90RSK-signaling cascade in focal cerebral ischemia.
Therefore, this study investigated whether ferulic acid modulates
the activation of Raf-MEK-ERK and its downstream targets, p90RSK
and Bad.
Sprague–Dawley rats (male, 220–230 g, n = 40) were obtained
from Samtako Co. (Animal Breeding Center, Osan, Korea). Rats
were kept under controlled temperature (25 ◦ C) and lighting
(12/12 h light/dark cycle) and were allowed free access to food.
All experimental procedures for animal use were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Gyeongsang
National University. Animals were randomly divided into four
groups: vehicle + sham group, ferulic acid + sham group, vehicle + middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group, and ferulic
acid + MCAO group. A single dose of ferulic acid (100 mg/kg, Sigma
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) or vehicle was intravenously
injected immediately after MCAO [5]. The vehicle was used the
same volume of normal saline.
The MCAO model was induced as previously described [15]. Animals were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of sodium
pentobarbital (30 mg/kg). The right common carotid artery, external carotid artery, and internal carotid artery were exposed through
a midline cervical incision. A 4/0 monoﬁlament nylon suture with
its tip slightly rounded by heat was inserted through the internal
carotid artery until it blocked the origins of the middle cerebral
artery. At 24 h after the onset of permanent occlusion, animals
were sacriﬁced and brains were removed. Sham-operated animals
underwent the same surgical procedures without insertion of a
nylon ﬁlament.
Brains tissues were cut into coronal slices of 2 mm in thickness
using a brain matrix, and these slices were stained with 2% triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma) for 20 min at 37 ◦ C. Brain
slices were ﬁxed by 10% formalin solution, photographed by a Nikon
CoolPIX990 digital camera (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and measured for
the ischemic lesion by Image-ProPlus 4.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA). The ischemic lesion percentage of
each brain slice was measured by the ratio of the infarction area to
the whole slice area. The brain slices were embedded with parafﬁn
and sectioned into slices of 4 ␮m thickness using a rotary microtome. The identiﬁcation of apoptotic cells was performed using
the DNA Fragmentation Detection Kit (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
The sections were reacted with equilibration buffer and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) enzyme for 60 min at room
temperature. The reaction was terminated by incubation in stop
buffer for 5 min. The sections were washed in PBS three times for
10 min, incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate,
and visualized with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB,
Sigma) substrate. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and the slides were observed under microscope. Five ﬁelds
for each section were selected from the right cerebral cortex. The
total cell number and TUNEL-positive cell number were counted
carefully in each ﬁeld. The percentage of TUNEL-positive cells is
described as the percentage of the number of TUNEL-positive cells
to the total number of cells in each ﬁeld.
Western blot analysis was performed as a previous described
method [21]. The right cerebral cortex tissues (n = 5 per group)

19

were removed and lysed in buffer [1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA in
1 × PBS (pH 74)] containing 10 ␮M leupeptin and 200 ␮M phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride. The lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g
for 20 min at 4 ◦ C and the supernatant was used for Western blotting. The protein concentration of each lysate was determined using
the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the guidelines provided by the manufacturer. Total protein
(30 ␮g) was applied to each lane on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels
and was loaded using a Ready Gel (Bio-Rad Hercules, CA, USA).
After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred from the gel to a
poly-vinylidene ﬂuoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
The membranes were incubated with skim milk solution, washed
in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST), and
then incubated with the following antibodies: anti-phospho-Raf1(Ser338 ), anti-Raf-1, anti-phospho-MEK1/2(Ser217 /Ser221 ), antiMEK1/2, anti-phospho-ERK1/2(Thr202 /Thr204 ), anti-ERK1/2, antiphospho-p90RSK(Ser383 ), anti-p90RSK, anti-phospho-Bad(Ser112 ),
anti-Bad anti-cleaved PARP (diluted 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), and anti-actin (diluted 1:1000, Milipore) as
the primary antibody. The membrane was then incubated with the
secondary antibody (1:5000, Pierce) and the ECL Western blot analysis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA)
was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The intensity
analysis was carried out using SigmaGel 1.0 (Jandel Scientiﬁc, San
Rafael, CA, USA) and SigmaPlot 4.0 (SPSS Inc. Point Richmond, CA,
USA).
For the immunohistochemical study, brain tissues were ﬁxed
in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS,
pH 7.4) solution, embedded with parafﬁn, and sectioned into 4 ␮m
thick slices. The sections were deparafﬁned in xylene, blocked
with 1% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h and then incubated
with anti-phospho-ERK1/2(Thr202 /Thr204 ) antibody (diluted 1:200,
Cell Signaling Technology) at 4 ◦ C for 15 h in a humidiﬁed chamber. The sections were washed in PBS and were incubated with
biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 in PBS) for 1 h.
After washing with PBS, the sections were incubated with an
avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex for 1 h from a Vector ABC Elite
kit (Vector Laboratories Inc. Burlingame, CA, USA), and reacted
with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma) solution with
0.03% hydrogen peroxidase. The sections were counterstained with
hematoxylin, dehydrated in gradient ethyl alcohol series, and
observed under a microscope.
All data are expressed as mean ± S.E.M. The results in each group
were compared by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed
by to post-hoc Scheffe’s test. A P < 0.05 was considered to represent
statistical signiﬁcance.
Fig. 1 clearly shows conﬁrmation the neuroprotective effects
of ferulic acid against MCAO injury. MCAO injury induced brain
infarction and ferulic acid treatment signiﬁcantly decreased infarct
regions (Fig. 1A). The infarct volume was 33.51 ± 3.90% and
15.66 ± 2.51% in vehicle- and ferulic acid-treated animals during
MCAO, respectively (Fig. 1C). Moreover, there was a signiﬁcant
increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the infarct
region of vehicle-treated animals during MCAO, whereas ferulic
acid treatment prevented a MCAO-induced increase in the number
of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 1B). The proportions of TUNEL-positive
cells were 78.1 ± 3.1% and 27.1 ± 3.5% in the cerebral cortex of
vehicle- and ferulic acid-treated animals during MCAO, respectively (Fig. 1D).
Western blots showed that MCAO injury induced a reduction
in phospho-Raf-1 and phospho-MEK1/2 levels while ferulic acid
prevented injury-induced down-regulation of phospho-Raf-1
and phospho-MEK1/2 levels. The levels of phospho-Raf-1 were
0.41 ± 0.03 and 0.78 ± 0.02 in the cerebral cortex of vehicle- and
ferulic acid-treated animals during MCAO, respectively (Fig. 2A).
Moreover, the levels of phospho-MEK1/2 were 0.28 ± 0.02 and

0.72 ± 0.03 in the cerebral cortex of vehicle- and ferulic acidtreated animals during MCAO, respectively (Fig. 2B). The levels
of phospho-ERK1/2 also decreased in the cerebral cortex of
vehicle-treated animals, and ferulic acid treatment prevented
this decrease. The levels of phospho-ERK1/2 were 0.36 ± 0.03
and 0.76 ± 0.03 in the cerebral cortex of vehicle- and ferulic
acid-treated animals during MCAO, respectively (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2D
showed the results of phospho-ERK1/2 immuno-staining in cerebral cortex. Immunoreactivity of phospho-ERK1/2 was observed
in cytoplasmic and nuclear of neuron. The number of positive cells
for phospho-ERK1/2 was decreased in vehicle + MCAO-treated
animals compared with that of sham-operated animals. However,

phospho-ERK1/2 expression in ferulic acid + MCAO animals was
similar to that of sham-operated animals. The levels of phosphop90RS, and phospho-Bad decreased in vehicle-treated animals,
and ferulic acid treatment prevented injury-induced decreases of
these proteins levels. The levels of phospho-p90RSK were 0.34 ±
0.02 and 0.98 ± 0.03 in the cerebral cortex of vehicle- and ferulic
acid-treated animals during MCAO, respectively (Fig. 3A). The
levels of phospho-Bad were 0.21 ± 0.02 and 0.67 ± 0.03 in the
cerebral cortex of vehicle- and ferulic acid-treated animals during
MCAO, respectively (Fig. 3B). However, levels of Raf-1, MEK1/2,
ERK1/2, p90RSK, and Bad proteins in vehicle- and ferulic acid
treated animals during MCAO remained the same as those in the

0.98 ± 0.03 and 0.33 ± 0.02 in the cerebral cortex of vehicle- and
ferulic acid-treated animals during MCAO, respectively (Fig. 3C).
Ferulic acid exerts a neuroprotective effect against oxidative
stress and focal cerebral ischemia [5,6]. This study conﬁrmed that
ferulic acid decreases infarct damage and reduces apoptotic cell
death in the MCAO animal model and further demonstrates that
ferulic acid treatment modulates the MAP kinase signaling pathway in MCAO injury. Ferulic acid protects cells from oxidative
stress by PI3-K and ERK pathways [16]. Moreover, an increase of
phospho-ERK by sodium ferulate treatment attenuates amyloid
␤-induced neurotoxicity [10]. Thus, ERK pathway is considered
as an essential signaling pathway in protective action of ferulic

acid against oxidative stress. I previously demonstrated that ferulic acid modulates Akt signaling pathway during MCAO injury
[13]. PI3-K/Akt pathway plays an important role in cell survival
signaling against oxidative stress. Ferulic acid prevents the MCAO
injury-induced decrease of phospho-Akt and its downstream targets, phospho-Bad and phosphos-GSK-3␤ levels [9,13]. This study
additionally showed the neuroprotective mechanism of ferulic acid
on MEK/ERK/p90RSK signaling cascade in MCAO injury. MAP kinase
is a regulator of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression [4,25].
The growth factors and mitogens that activate a protein kinase cascade include Raf MEK and ERK. These protein kinases are involved
in substrate phosphorylation. In this study, the phosphorylation
of Raf and MEK was decreased in MCAO injury, while ferulic acid

treatment prevented these MCAO-induced decreases. Moreover,
the phosphorylation of ERK was consequently decreased in the
MCAO animal model, indicating that ferulic acid attenuated this
decrease. p90RSK, a MAP kinase downstream target, is activated
by ERK in response to growth factors and it is involved in regulation of apoptotic cell death. Immunohistochemical study conﬁrmed
that phospho-ERK1/2 expression was decreased in cerebral cortex
with MCAO injury, ferulic acid treatment prevented this decrease.
Decrease of phospho-ERK1/2 in the ischemic cortex after focal cerebral ischemia was consistent with the results of previous study [20].
These results also conﬁrmed the neuronal expression of phosphoERK1/2. It is necessary to explain the relationship between ferulic
acid and Raf-MEK-ERK activation. Thus, further studies are needed
to test the kinase inhibitors such as the MAPK inhibitor SB203580
or the ERK inhibitor PD098059.
p90RSK phosphorylates Bad and inactivates the pro-apoptotic
function of Bad [4,8,25]. The results of this study demonstrate
that MCAO injury reduces phospho-p90RSK and phospho-Bad
levels, and ferulic acid treatment attenuates MCAO injury-induced
reduction in phospho-p90RSK and phospho-Bad. Bad which
induces apoptotic cascades, is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2
family [27]. Dephosphorylated Bad forms a heterodimer with

anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins, and is then involved
in the inactivation of these proteins and activation of Bax protein, which ﬁnally initiates apoptotic cell death. However, Bad
phosphorylated by p90RSK forms the Bad and 14-3-3 protein
interaction, which inhibits the binding of Bad with anti-apoptotic
proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Bcl-2 can therefore inhibit
the apoptotic function of Bax protein. Thus, phosphorylation of
Bad is a critical event in the inhibition of apoptosis. This study
demonstrated that ferulic acid treatment attenuates the MCAO
injury-induced decrease of phosphorylated Bad levels. As a ﬁnal
step in apoptosis, cleaved-PARP levels were investigated in the
MCAO model. MCAO injury induces an increase of cleaved-PARP,
while ferulic acid treatment prevents a MCAO-induced increase of
cleaved-PARP. These data demonstrated that MCAO injury induces
a reduction in phospho-Raf-1, phospho-MEK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2,
phospho-p90RSK, and phospho-Bad levels. Ferulic acid treatment
prevents the MCAO injury-induced reduction of these proteins
levels and thereby attenuates apoptotic cell death following
focal cerebral ischemia. In conclusion, these ﬁndings suggest
that ferulic acid exerts a neuroprotective effect through the
activation of the MAP kinase signaling pathway in a MCAO animal
model.
