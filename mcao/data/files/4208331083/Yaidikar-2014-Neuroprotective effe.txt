Lavanya Yaidikar, MPharm, Bavya Byna, MPharm, and Santh Rani Thakur, PhD

Background: Punicalagin (PG) is a hydrolyzable polyphenol in Punica granatum. It has
been previously reported that it has a protective effect against hypoxia-induced
ischemia brain injury. It is a potent antioxidant. The present study is aimed to evaluate the antioxidant potential of PG against focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion
injury in rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Methods: Rats
were randomly divided into sham, MCAO, PG-treated groups. PG (15 and
30 mg/kg) vehicle was administered orally for 7 days before MCAO. Rats were
anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg), xylazine (10 mg/kg), and subjected to
2 hours occlusion, and 22 hours reperfusion. Neurologic deficit, brain water content
(BWC), histopathology changes, and oxidative stress markers were evaluated after
22 hours of reperfusion. In comparison with MCAO model group, treatment with
PG significantly reduced the neurologic deficit scores and BWC. Results: PGattenuated neuronal damage occurred by downregulating the levels of malondialdehyde, sodium–potassium adenosine triphosphatase activity, nitric oxide, protein
carbonyl content, and mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species and upregulating the superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, reduced
glutathione, glutathione reductase activities. Conclusions: Taken together, these
results suggested that supplementation of PG treatment effectively ameliorates
the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion induced oxidative damage by virtue of its
antioxidant potential. Key Words: Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury—
oxidative stress—punicalagin—antioxidant.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is a major cause of mortality and
morbidity worldwide.1,2 It is caused by obstruction of
blood flow to the brain, resulting in energy failure
that initiates a complex series of metabolic events,
ultimately causing neuronal cell death. The ensuing

cascade of events causes a mitochondrial dysfunction
and rapid decrease in adenosine triphosphate (ATP),
which leads to the free radical generation and lipid
peroxidation.3-6 Many recent studies have shown that
oxidative stress plays a major role in neuronal
damage after ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury.7-10
Oxidative metabolism is essential for survival of brain
and is also associated with the generation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS).11 Under physiologic conditions,
regulation of ROS is controlled by endogenous antioxidant defense mechanism and maintains homeostasis,
if any disturbance in this homeostasis results in oxidative stress, which is the key factor for initiation of
inflammation and apoptotic cascades leading to
neuronal damage.12,13 Brain tissues are particularly
susceptible to oxidative damage; therefore, it is
believed that pharmacologic modification of oxidative
damage is one of the most promising avenues for
stroke therapy.

Punicalagin (PG), a hydrolyzable tannin of Punica granatum (Pomegranate) juice is a well-known potential antioxidant, and it is considered as the most powerful,
nutrient defense food for overall good health.14 PG is
the major component responsible for the antioxidant potential and health benefits of pomegranate. It is well
known for its biological properties such as antiproliferative, antioxidant, antihypertensive, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, antiatherosclerotic, antiplatelet, and so
forth.15-23 The potent antioxidant potential of PG
provoked our interest to evaluate its neuroprotective
role against I/R injury in middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) rat model.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
PG is obtained from Natural Remedies, Bangalore.
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, streptomycin sulfate,
(-) – epinephrine, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate reduced form (NADPH), 5,50 -dithiobis-2nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB), 1-chloro-2,4-dinitro benzene,
sodium azide, ouabain, and 20 ,70 dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich
Chemicals Private Limited, India. Other chemicals used
were of analytical grade.

Animals
Male rats of Wister strain weighing 280-300 g were used
for the study. The rats were maintained under conditions
of 12 hours light/dark cycle and had free access to food
and water. All experimental procedures were carried
out after obtaining approval from Institutional Animal
Ethical Committee (No. 1677/PO/a/12/CPCSEA/4).

Experimental Design
After acclimatization, the rats were randomly divided
into 4 groups; each group consisted of 18 rats, treated
with drug or vehicle orally once daily for 7 days before
MCAO. The first group served as sham control and
received 2% tween 80 orally. The second group served
as MCAO model group and received 2% tween 80 orally.
The third and fourth groups were treated with PG 15 and
30 mg/kg postoperatively, respectively for 7 days. After
7 days of pretreatment, rats were subjected to 2 hours
right MCAO via the intraluminal filament technique
and 22 hours reperfusion. Briefly, the right common carotid artery was exposed at the level of the external and
internal carotid artery bifurcation. A 4-0 nylon suture
with a blunted tip was inserted into the internal carotid
artery and advanced into the anterior cerebral artery to
occlude the middle cerebral artery. After occluding the
middle cerebral artery for 2 hours, nylon suture was
removed carefully to restore blood flow and then the
skin was sutured. Animals were then returned to their

cages and closely monitored for 22 hours. The body temperature was maintained at 37 C with a thermostatically
controlled infrared lamp. In the sham-operated group,
the external carotid artery was surgically prepared for
insertion of the filament, but the filament was not inserted. After 22 hours of reperfusion, neurologic deficit
was evaluated. Then, 6 rats in each group were decapitated to obtain brain tissue samples for biochemical analysis, brain tissues from 6 rats were used for analysis of
brain water content (BWC), and brain tissues of the remaining 6 rats in each group were used for histopathology studies.

Evaluation of Neurologic Deficits
A neurologic examination is blindly performed at
22 hours after reperfusion (before killing) according to
the method as previously described.24 The neurologic
findings were scored using a 5-point scale, which are as
follows: no neurologic deficit 5 score 0; failure to extend
forepaw fully 5 score 1; circling to the left 5 score 2; falling to the left or no spontaneous motor activity 5 score 3;
and do not walk spontaneously and have a depressed
level of consciousness 5 score 4.

Determination of BWC
After reperfusion for 22 hours, rats were decapitated
under anesthesia with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), and the brains were removed. The cerebellum, pons, and olfactory bulb were separated and their
wet weights (WWs) were measured.25 Dry weights (DWs)
were assessed after 24 hours at 120 C. BWC was calculated as ([WW2DW]/WW) 3 100.

Histopathologic Analysis
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, rats were anaesthetized and killed by rapid decapitation. The brains were
removed and immersed in cold saline solution for 10 minutes followed by overnight fixation with 10% formalin at
room temperature, sectioned into coronal slices 4-5 mm
thickness and embedded in paraffin blocks, and brain sections of 4-6 mm thickness were stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E).

Biochemical Analysis: Brain Tissue Preparation
The rats were killed by cervical decapitation under
anesthesia and brains were quickly dissected out, homogenized in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing
.1 mM EDTA to yield 5% (w/v) homogenate. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 0 C
in cold centrifuge; the resulting supernatant was used to
determine oxidative product contents, antioxidant
enzyme activities, and redox status in I/R brain.

10 minutes at room temperature. A volume of 375 mL of
thiobarbituric acid (.6%) was added and placed in a
boiling water bath for 60 minutes, and then, the samples
were allowed to cool at room temperature. A mixture of
1.25 mL of butanol:pyridine (1.5:1) was added, vortexed,
and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. The optical
density of the colored layer was measured at 532 nm on
a spectrophotometer against reference blank, and the
rate of MDA formed is expressed as nanomoles of MDA
formed per hour per milligram of protein.

Measurement of Nitrite
To 100 ml of brain homogenate supernatant, 500 ml of
Greiss reagent (1:1 solution of 1% sulphanilamide in 5%
phosphoric acid and .1% naphthylamine diamine dihydrochloric acid in water) was added, and absorbance
was measured at 546 nm.33 Nitrite concentration was
calculated using a standard curve of sodium nitrite and
expressed as micromole of nitrite per milligram of protein.

Measurement of Reduced Glutathione Content

homogenate supernatant was mixed with .75 mL of 4%
sulphosalicylic acid and then centrifuged at 1200 rpm
for 5 minutes at 4 C. From this .5 mL of supernatant
was taken and added to 4.5 mL of .01 M DTNB, and the
yellow color developed was read spectrophometrically
at 412 nm immediately. The GSH content was calculated
as nanomole GSH per milligram of protein.

software (Version 5.0). A value of P less than .05 was
considered as statistically significant.

Measurement of Glutathione Peroxidase Activity
Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was measured according
to the method previously described with minor modifications.37 Briefly, 5 mL of brain homogenate supernatant was
mixed with 10 mL of each of EDTA, sodium azide, GSH,
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and 20 mL of phosphate

with 150 ml of dihydrogen phosphate and 50 ml DTNB.
The absorbance was measured at 412 nm. GPx is expressed as units per milligram of protein. One unit of
GPx activity is defined as GPx in milligram protein,
which related to decrease in micromole per GSH per
minute.

Measurement of Superoxide Dismutase Activity
Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured according to the method of Misra and Fridovich38 by monitoring the auto-oxidation of (-) – epinephrine at pH 10.4

modified version of Aebi.39 Briefly, 100 mL of brain homogenate supernatant was added to 10 mL of 100%
ethanol and placed in ice bath for 30 minutes. The tubes
were allowed to attain room temperature followed by
the addition of 10 mL of Triton X-100. To 50 mL of mixture,
200 mL of phosphate buffer and 250 mL of .066 M H2O2 (in
phosphate buffer) was added. The decrease in optical

UV spectrophotometer. The molar extinction coefficient
of 43.6 Mcm21 was used to determine CAT activity, which
is equal to the moles of H2O2 degraded per milligram of
protein minute.

Results
Effect of PG on Neurologic Deficit and BWC
The neurologic scores after 22 hours of reperfusion
were given in Figure 1. The MCAO model group showed
significantly increased (P , .001) neurologic scores
compared with the sham group. Pretreatment with PG
significantly reduced the neurologic deficits (P , .001)
compared with the model group.
The BWC is measured after 22 hours of reperfusion as
shown in Figure 2. The MCAO rats showed significantly
(P , .001) increased BWC, which depicted the formation
of edema in rats subjected to 2 hours ischemia followed
by 22 hours reperfusion compared with the sham group.
PG-pretreated (15 and 30 mg/kg) rats restored the BWC
significantly (P , .001) compared with the MCAO rats.

Effect of PG on Histologic Changes
H&E stained sections of brains in the MCAO model
group showed significant morphologic changes of large
number of degenerated neurons and vacuolated edematous tissue compared with the sham group. PG-treated
(15 and 30 mg/kg) rat brains showed increased number
of normal neurons with no vacuolated tissue as shown
in Figure 3.

Effect of PG on Na1/K1 ATPase Activity
A significant decrease (P ,.001) in Na1/K1 ATPase activity was observed in MCAO groups compared with the
sham group (Fig 4, A). The PG-pretreated group exhibited
significant attenuation in Na1/K1 ATPase activity in
comparison with the MCAO group (P , .001).

Effect of PG on Mitochondria-generated ROS
Mitochondria are the major source of ROS produced
during I/R injury. To measure this, a fluorescent probe,
DCFH-DA, was used. MCAO group showed significantly (P , .001) increased production of ROS from
mitochondria compared with the sham group, which
substantially supports the fact that there is increased production of ROS from mitochondria in the pathogenesis of
ischemia/reperfusion induced oxidative damage in
brain. However, there is significant restoration
(P , .001) in mitochondria-generated ROS in the PGpretreated groups compared with the MCAO group
(Fig 4, B).

lead to loss of protein function. The MCAO group
showed significantly (P , .001) increased protein
carbonyl content compared with the sham group. However, there is significant restoration (P , .001) in protein
carbonyl content in the PG-pretreated groups compared
with the MCAO group (Fig 4, C).

Effect of PG on the Contents of MDA and Nitrite
A significant increase (P , .001) in the contents of MDA
and nitrite were observed in the MCAO group compared
with the sham group (Fig 5, A,B). Pretreatment with PG
(15 and 30 mg/kg) has significantly restored (P , .001)
the MDA and nitrite levels compared with the MCAO
group and protected the brain from associated damage.

In the present study, we demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of PG against cerebral I/R injury. Overproduction of free radicals and depletion of antioxidant defense
mechanism during I/R injury leads to neuronal damage.
Na1/K1 ATPase is an integral membrane protein, maintains electrolyte and fluid balance in cells, organs, and the
whole body. It couples the hydrolysis of ATP to the vectorial transport of Na1 ions and K1 ions across the plasma
membranes. During ischemia, the decrease in ATP levels
leads to increase in intracellular Ca21, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, acidosis, and edema, ultimately
predispose the brain to the formation of free radicals.40,41
After reperfusion, these events can set out a cascade of
other biochemical and molecular sequela such as the
xanthine–xanthine oxidase reaction and phospholipase
activation, leading to the overproduction of free
radicals.42 The membrane-bound Na1-K1 ATPase
enzyme requires phospholipids for maintenance of its activity and is susceptible to structural changes due to lipid
peroxidation.43 Assessment of the Na1/K1 ATPase activity is also used as an index for oxidant-induced tissue
injury and lipid peroxidation.44 From our results, it is
found that the MCAO rats showed significant inhibition
of the enzyme activity, which is accompanied with membrane damage due to increased lipid peroxidation. PGpretreated rats showed significant improvement in
Na1/K1 ATPase activity because of decreased peroxidation of membrane lipids and maintains cellular integrity,
which may be one of the possible mechanism of neuroprotective effect of PG against ischemia/reperfusion
induced oxidative brain injury.
Cerebral ischemia causes cell swelling and breakdown
of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Generation of ROS contributes to endothelial and cellular dysfunction, resulting
in increased BBB permeability and life-threatening cerebral edema.45,46 In the case of ischemia, irreversible
tissue damage and BBB breakdown leads to the
extravasation of serum proteins and vasogenic brain
edema development.46 Cerebral ischemia and postischemic reperfusion cause cerebral capillary dysfunction,
resulting in edema formation and hemorrhagic conversion. Cytotoxic edema results from energy failure, and
vasogenic edema occurs when the blood vessels are
damaged. Proteases and free radicals are the end result
of a molecular injury cascade. The BWC, which is used
for the evaluation of altered BBB permeability, is accepted
by some researchers as a parameter that indicates the intensity of the injury.47 We have found that cerebral I/R

caused a significant increase in the BBB permeability at
22 hours after the reperfusion. BBB breakdown permits
extravasation of plasma-like fluid into the extracellular
space. Besides these, the failure of the Na/K pumps,
and the altered electrolyte balance of the cell, may also
contribute to brain edema.45,46 In the present study,
brain edema was significantly higher in the MCAO
group parallel to the inhibition of Na1/K1 ATPase
activity. The increased BWC was significantly reversed
with PG pretreatment possibly because of the
maintenance of BBB permeability by improving the
Na1/K1 ATPase activity. Because brain edema causes
an increase in intracranial pressure and leads to
neurologic deficits, we have assessed neurologic deficit
scores at 24 hours. The neurologic scores, which were
significantly higher in the MCAO groups, indicate that
I/R was the cause, compared with the sham group.
However, pretreatment with PG ameliorated the
neurologic signs significantly compared with the
MCAO group. Thus, it showed the neuroprotective
effect, which could be because of improvement in Na1/
K1 ATPase activity, thereby maintaining the cellular
integrity and electrolyte balance with the decrease in
BWC.
ROS is the key factor for the initiation of inflammation
and apoptosis, which contributes to ischemic brain damage.48-50 Mitochondria is the key site for ROS production.
There is robust production of ROS from mitochondria

during I/R injury, which subsequently leads to cellular
membrane, protein, and DNA damage.10,51,52 ROS can
react directly with the proteins or they can react with
molecules such as sugars, amino acids, and lipids,
yielding highly reactive carbonyl derivatives, which
causes an irreversible oxidative damage, often leading
to a loss of protein function.53 Protein carbonylation is
measured in terms of protein carbonyl content, which is
considered a widespread indicator of severe oxidative
damage. Mitochondria-generated ROS and protein
carbonyl content is increased in the MCAO group indicating ROS-induced damage to mitochondria and proteins. It suggested that PG could improve damage to
mitochondria and proteins, which may be one of the
mechanisms for the neuroprotective effect of PG on cerebral I/R injury.
Excessive generation of free radicals induces the lipid
peroxidation in the cell membranes.54 The peroxidation
of the membrane phospholipids continues until either
the exhaustion of the substrate or the termination of chain
propagation by antioxidants. Lipid peroxidation products
are widely accepted group of oxidative stress markers,
especially MDA levels, used as a potentially reliable
and sensitive marker of reperfusion injury.55,56 Several
studies demonstrated higher MDA levels in stroke
patients.57-61 Clinical severity and patient’s outcome is
well correlated with MDA levels.60,61 Online with
previous studies in the present study, MCAO group rats

showed significant increase in MDA levels indicating
reperfusion injury by ROS. The neuroprotection of PG
might be because of its free radical scavenging activity,
which confirmed with significant restoration of MDA
levels.
Nitric oxide (NO) produced during I/R injury reacts
with oxygen radicals to form peroxynitrite, which is not
stable in physiologic pH degrades to nitrogen peroxide
and hydroxyl radicals, which directly hydroxylate and nitrate the aromatic residues of amino acids and nucleotides
in cytosol and nucleus,62,63 resulting in cellular machinery

dysfunction and neuronal loss.64 In this study, NO was
measured in the form of nitrite levels. The nitrite levels
were increased significantly (P , .001) in the MCAO
group compared with the sham group confirming
the production of NO during I/R. It is observed that
PG-treated rats significantly attenuated nitrite levels indicating its protective effect against nitrative stress-induced
damage during I/R.
Brain is highly vulnerable to free radicals; there is
reduction of endogenous antioxidants defense mechanism (SOD, CAT, GSH, GR, and GPx), which are essential
for the maintenance of homeostasis between free radical
generation and defense mechanism. SOD, the primary
line of defense mechanism, prevents the tissue damage
caused by free radicals. It catalyzes the dismutation of
superoxide radical to hydrogen peroxide, thereby
preventing the formation of hydroxyl radical. The
hydrogen peroxide formed by SOD is scavenged by
CAT and GPx, a ubiquitous heme protein that catalyzes
the dismutation of hydrogen peroxide radical to water
and molecular oxygen.10,65 GPx uses hydrogen peroxide
to oxidize GSH. GSH is one of the primary endogenous
antioxidant defense systems in the brain, which
scavenges hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides,66

thereby preventing degenerative cellular process, and the
decline in GSH levels reflects oxidative stress.67 Depletion
of GSH in I/R injury is attributed to several factors such
as cleavage of GSH to cysteine, decrease in the synthesis
of GSH, and the formation of mixed disulfides, causing
their cellular stores to be depleted.68 GR involves in
reduction of glutathione disulphide (GSSH) to GSH.69 In
our study, the MCAO rats showed significant decrease
in antioxidant status as measured by the levels of SOD,
CAT, GSH, GR, and GPx indicating increased production
of ROS during I/R injury. It is observed that PG pretreatment significantly improves the antioxidant status and innervates in maintaining homeostasis between free
radicals and antioxidant defense system, which may be
one of the possible mechanism of neuroprotective effect
of PG against I/R injury.
Histopathologic changes in the brain were assessed by
H&E staining. The presence of highly vacuolated edematous tissue and degenerated neurons in the brains of
MCAO rats confirms the neuronal damage after I/R
injury. Morphologically, PG-pretreated group showed
less neuronal loss compared with the MCAO group.
This infers that PG being a potent antioxidant neutralized
the free radicals generated after I/R, thus inhibiting the
progression of cell death in penumbral region, as evident
from observation of less neuronal loss in the brain histopathology of PG-pretreatment group. These results suggest that PG was able to reduce I/R insults, thus
protecting the brain from further injury.
Taken together, our results, suggested that supplementation of PG showed neuroprotection against cerebral

ischemia/reperfusion induced oxidative brain injury in
transient rat model of focal I/R through its antioxidant
potential.
