Abstract
Tat-NR2B9c, a clinical-stage stroke neuroprotectant validated in rats and primates, was recently deemed ineffective in
mice. To evaluate this discrepancy, we conducted studies in mice subjected to temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) for either 30 or 60 min according to the established principles for dose-translation between species. TatNR2B9c treatment reduced infarct volume by by 24.5% (p ¼ 0.49) and 26.0% (p ¼ 0.03) for 30 and 60 min tMCAO,
respectively, at the rat-equivalent dose of 10 nMole/g, but not at the previously reported 3 nMole/g in mice. Dose
translation is thus critical when preclinical experiments are conducted in new species.

Introduction
The peptide neuroprotectant Tat-NR2B9c, also termed
NA-1, is a clinical-stage therapeutic1 developed from
our discovery that the NMDA receptor-interacting
protein postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) is
a hub for excitotoxic signaling and a stroke therapeutic target.2,3 Tat-NR2B9c binds the second PDZ
domain of PSD95 (EC50 7 nM)2 with high speciﬁcity
and binding selectivity and perturbs synaptic
GluN2B:PSD95:nNOS complexs2,4–9 in vitro and
in vivo. This biological activity is both necessary and
suﬃcient for the neuroprotective eﬀects of this agent.2
Tat-NR2B9c also inhibits p38-mediated death in vitro
and ischemic damage in vivo without inhibiting the capacity of synaptic NMDAR activity to promote neuroprotective changes in gene expression, including
the upregulation of PACAP via CREB, and suppression of the pro-oxidative FOXO target gene Txnip.10,11
An important downstream consequence is that
Tat-NR2B9c attenuates ROS induced by NMDAR
activity.12,13
The preclinical eﬃcacy of Tat-NR2B9c as a stroke
neuroprotectant has been validated by us and others in
several stroke models in rats.2,4,10,14–16 and in comprehensive studies in non-human primates that provided
strong evidence of eﬃcacy.17,18 These led to the

‘‘ENACT’’ trial,1 an international, multi-center, randomized placebo controlled trial that provided encouraging human eﬃcacy data substantially similar to those
seen in primates. Thus, it was surprising to us that two
groups that tested Tat-NR2B9c in mice reported a lack
of eﬃcacy in their hands.19,20 Both groups used a dose
of 3 nMole/g, which is eﬀective in rats.2,4,10,14–16 We
had never validated Tat-NR2B9c in mice since our
research did not require genetically modiﬁed animals
and mouse models reportedly exhibit high variability
between labs even using the same strain, duration of
MCAo, and survival period.21 However, the discrepant
data reported in mice vs. other species raises at least
three possibilities: that the conclusions of rat, primate
and human studies are incorrect, that the conclusions

of published mouse studies were incorrect, or that TatNR2B9c is ineﬀective in mice.
Although Tat-NR2B9c is already in clinical testing, we
felt it relevant to understand the discrepancy between
reported mouse data and that in other species. Such warning signs are too often ignored in drug development, leading to further risks in subsequent development.
According to FDA guidance22 and literature23,24 on
dose translation between species, mice require approximately double the rat dose for dose-equivalence. Thus,
we conducted mouse studies to evaluate the eﬀect dose
and of tMCAO duration on the ability of Tat-NR2B9c
to reduce infarct size in mice.

Materials and methods
Experimental animals
All experiments and procedures were approved by the
University Health Network animal care committee,
were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of
the Canadian Council of Animal Care and are reported
herewith in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines.25
Male C57 Black 6 mice weighing between 21.9–29.7 g
(age 8–10 weeks) were used (Charles River, Ontario,
Canada). They were kept at 21 C and 65% humidity
with a regulated 12-hour light–dark cycle and with free
access to food and water.

through a midline neck exposure. The right common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA), and
internal carotid artery (ICA) were exposed, the ECA
ligated distally, the CCA temporarily occluded with a
microvascular aneurysm clip, and a standard Doccol
0.21  0.02 mm width ﬁlament (6021PK10, Doccol
Corporation, Sharon, MA, USA) was inserted in the
ECA and advanced through the ICA to occlude the origin
of the right MCA. After either 30 or 60 min, the ﬁlament
was removed to allow reperfusion. The thin skull permitted visualization of the brain and cortical arteries,
and was used to conﬁrm reduced CBF and exclude subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) prior to drug treatment.
No animals exhibited a SAH prior to treatment in this
study. One millilitre of saline was injected subcutaneously
for post-operative hydration. The initial body temperature was 34.64  0.89 pre-surgery, and the procedure
commenced when the rectal temperature was 36–37 .
Animals were recovered in a chamber held at 26 C for
2 h post-surgery and were then returned to their cages.
Weights were recorded before surgery and at 24 h.
Neurological Scoring was conducted 3 h and 24 h
post-tMCAO onset using a modiﬁed ﬁve-point
Bederson scale.28 Normal motor function was scored
as 0, failure to extend left forepaw as 1, circling to the
contralateral side as 2, lack of coordination as 3, and no
spontaneous motor activity as 4.

Drug
Study design
In each study animals were randomly allocated to three
treatment groups (0.0, 3.0, 10.0 nMole/g Tat-NR2B9c)
or to sham treatment. The individual performing the
experimental procedures, administering treatments
and performing the analyses was blinded to the treatment assignments. Tat-NR2B9c was prepared at the
indicated doses and administered intravenously via
the tail vein using a pump (KD Scientiﬁc, Holliston,
MA, model # 780200) in a volume of 1 mL/g over
5 min beginning at reperfusion.

Experimental procedures
Temporary MCAO was conducted using the intraluminal
suture method as described by Koizumi et al.26 and
adapted by Clark to the mouse.27 In brief, anaesthesia
was induced with 3% isoﬂurane mixed with O2 in an
anaesthetic chamber and maintained with 2% isoﬂurane
via a facemask. Rectal body temperature was maintained
at 36.9  0.17 C during the surgery with a warming pad.
Cerebral blood ﬂow was measured throughout the surgery via a right temporoparietal exposure of the skull over
the MCA territory using a stainless steel probe (Perimed
403) on a Periﬂux System 5000. MCAO was achieved

Tat-NR2B9c/NA-1 (NoNO Inc., Etobicoke, Canada;
GMP grade Lot #165I1107) was prepared in PBS at a
concentration of either 3 mM/mL or 10 mM/mL.

Experimental outcomes
Infarct volumes (in mm3) were derived after the animals
were sacriﬁced 24 h after tMCAO onset and the brains
harvested and frozen to facilitate sectioning into 8  1 mm
coronal sections. The slices were stained for 20 min at
37 C with 2% TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride:
Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MD, USA) in 0.9% Saline and
photographed with a scanner. The areas of the infarct,
ipsilateral hemisphere and contralateral hemisphere were
measured using NIH Image (Software version 1.48) and
volumes were derived by integrating the edema-corrected
infarct areas (area of contralateral hemisphere minus area
of healthy tissue in ipsilateral hemisphere). Neurological
scores were compared at 3 h and 24 h.

Statistical methods
All analyses were based on intent-to-treat (ITT), analyzing all animals randomized to the study. An animal
was considered randomized if it received any amount of

Teves et al.
study drug. Prespeciﬁed exclusions from the ITT analyses were death during tMCAO, SAH during ﬁlament
removal, and either >20% rCBF during MCAO
or  50% rCBF after reperfusion as measured by laser
Doppler. In the 60-min tMCAO experiment, animals
that were excluded prior to randomization were
replaced. For the 30 min MCAO experiments, 10 animals/group (total 30 animals) were anticipated to sufﬁce to detect a 40% reduction in infarct volume at 0.8
power. In the 60-min MCAO experiments, a smaller
eﬀect size was anticipated (30%) and thus 20 animals/
group (total 80 animals) were required. One-way
ANOVA was used to compare means with a
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.

Results
Since the literature on dose translation between species
suggests that mice require approximately double the rat
dose for dose equivalence,22–24 we examined the impact
of Tat-NR2B9c at both the 3 nM/g dose previously
reported to be ineﬀective in mice19,20 as well a higher
dose of 10 nM/g. These were tested in two separate
studies that diﬀered only in the duration of tMCAO.
In the ﬁrst, tMCAO was for a 30-min duration, whereas
in the second, tMCAO lasted 60 min. The rationale for
the shorter tMCAO duration was to address the possibility that a 60-min tMCAO can in some circumstances
produce a malignant and rapidly progressing stroke
that is diﬃcult to neuroprotect.21

Exclusions and mortalities
Animals were only excluded from analysis if they met
the prespeciﬁed exclusion criteria (Methods section). In
the 30-min tMCAO experiment, two of the 30 animals
(both in the 10 nmol/g group) died upon induction of
tMCAO. In the 60-min tMCAO experiment, 6 of 86
animals died (3 in the 0 nmol/g, 2 in the 3 nmol/g and
1 in the 10 nmol/g groups) during tMCAO. One animal
in the 3 nmol/g did not reperfuse adequately
(rCBF < 50% after suture removal), but was not
excluded from the analysis as it received study drug
and was thus considered to be randomized.

Infarct volumes
The suture occlusion of the MCA reduced rCBF
to < 20% of baseline in all cases (Figure 2(a) and (b)).
Consistent with previous reports,19,20 the dose of 3 nM/
g of Tat-NR2B9c had no impact on infarct volume in
either the 30 min or 60 min tMCAO experiments.
However, treatment with 10 nM/g reduced infarct volumes by 24.5% (p ¼ 0.049) and 26.0% (p ¼ 0.03) for 30
and 60 min tMCAO, respectively (Figure 1(a) and (b)).

Neurological scores
There were no diﬀerences in neurological scores
between groups in either the 30 min or 60 min
tMCAO experiment (Figure 2(c) and (d)).

Discussion
The validity of PSD95 as a signaling hub and therapeutic target is at this stage generally accepted,29,30
Also, the agent Tat-NR2B9c has received signiﬁcant
internal and external validation.5–9,12,31–35 We had not
used mice previously to direct the development of TatNR2B9c due to our concerns about the sensitivity of
the mouse to rapid infarct extension, sometimes over
minutes of MCAo21 that could lead to signiﬁcant variability and malignant infarcts. However, since TatNR2B9c is already in clinical trials, we felt it relevant
to understand the discrepancy between reports of its
ineﬀectiveness in mouse MCAO19,20 and the larger
body of published literature in higher species.
The authors reporting negative studies19,20 tested
Tat-NR2B9c in mice only at 3 nM/g, a dose identical
to that usually used by our group in rats4 and saw no
therapeutic eﬀect. According to Reagan-Shaw and colleagues: ‘‘One often-ignored explanation for drug ineffectiveness is the inappropriate translation of a drug
dose from one animal species to another’’.23 We therefore conducted a dose–response study in male C57BL/6
mice using methods substantially similar to those
reported by the authors,20,36 except that the highest
dose was aligned with dosing requirements for mice.
Also, Tat-NR2B9c was administered at reperfusion
instead of 1 h after reperfusion because of our concern
that the rapid progression of infarction in mice21 would
risk leaving no tissue to protect if the intervention is
given too late.
We found that when established principles for dosetranslation between species are followed, the discrepancy between reported mouse data and our ﬁndings
of eﬃcacy in higher species is largely resolved.
However, while our data explain previously published
negative ﬁndings with a simple dose–response experiment, they show a rather modest eﬀect size, less than
would be expected from previous rat studies. For example, a 90-min tMCAO in rats4,37 or primates18 reduces
the infarction volume by more than 50%. The small
eﬀect size of Tat-NR2B9c in mice may be due to our
relative inexperience conducting mouse tMCAO experiments, to the high variability inherent in mouse
tMCAO models between laboratories,21 to a rapid
malignant progression of the stroke,21 or that mice
are just less sensitive to neuroprotection by TatNR2B9c as compared with higher species. This may
be due to diﬀerences in metabolism, pharmacokinetics,

or the neurobiology of NMDAR-PSD95-nNOS signalling. Due to diﬀerences in protocols between our and
the reported mouse studies, it is also possible that
giving the agent at reperfusion (our experiment) instead
of at 120 min20 after a 60-min tMCAO onset or 30 min
into a permanent MCAO19 was more eﬀective.

One caveat is that the groups reporting negative
mouse data with Tat-NR2B9c obtained it from their
own sources. Since Tat-NR2B9c is in clinical trials,
we have signiﬁcant experience in its production. The
purity and potency of the agent can be highly variable,
depending on the source and synthesis. Speciﬁcally, the

peptide content in some manufacturing processes can
range from as little as 20% and up to 80%. This wide
range would certainly impact on the choice of dose
needed to obtain a biological eﬀect.
In conclusion, the disparity between previously
reported negative experiments that failed to show a
treatment eﬀect of Tat-NR2B9c in mouse tMCAO is
simply explained by adherence to the principles of dose
translation between species. We also recommend that a
dose–response study be conducted whenever an agent is
tested in any new species, since its impact on that species biology is at that point still unknown.
