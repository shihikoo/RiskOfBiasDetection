and had fewer apoptotic cells, whereas recombinant IL-17A-treated mice signiﬁcantly
increased bax and cleaved caspase-3 protein expression and had more apoptotic cells.

Introduction

Inﬂammatory response has a critical role in brain tissue
damage after ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury (Brea et al.,
2009; Gronberg et al., 2013; Lakhan et al., 2009; Muir et al.,
2007; Tuttolomondo et al., 2009). Several studies have shown
that an attenuation of the inﬂammatory process could be a
possible way to widen the therapeutic window (Iadecola and
Alexander, 2001; Yilmaz et al., 2006). Recent reports have
tested that IL-17A secreted by γδ T cell is implicated in the
pathogenesis of myocardial, intestinal and cerebral I/R injury
(Lee et al., 2013; Liao et al., 2012; Shichita et al., 2009). In
cerebral I/R injury, IL-17A plays an important role in the
neutrophils inﬁltration and neuronal damage. IL-17Ablocking treatment in acute phase of stroke could decrease
infarct size and improved neurologic outcome in the murine
model (Gelderblom et al., 2012). In brain tissue of patients
who had a stroke, IL-17A-positive lymphocytes were also
detected (Gelderblom et al., 2012). All these data suggested
that targeting of IL-17A-related signaling might reduce the
acute inﬂammatory response and tissue damage in cerebral
ischemia. However, which signaling that induced the secretion of IL-17A and which pathway that led to the neuronal
damage is still largely unknown.
HMGB1 is a member of the damage-associated-molecularpattern (DAMP) family of proteins that is released by necrotic
brain cells in ischemic stroke (Zhang et al., 2011). HMGB1
functions as an endogenous danger signal molecule in the body
(Bianchi and Manfredi, 2007). It is originally localized in cell
nuclei in the normal brain, translocates into the cytosolic
compartment and is released into the extracellular compartment
in the ischemic condition (Zhang et al., 2011). HMGB1 can bind to
its receptors (glycation end products (RAGE), Toll-like receptor 2
(TLR2), and TLR4) and then trigger inﬂammatory cytokine
expression in damaged tissues (Yang et al., 2010). Furthermore,
recent studies found that TLR4 contributed more to HMGB1mediated ischemic brain injury than RAGE and TLR2 (Qiu et al.,
2010; Yang et al., 2011). Interestingly, the HMGB1-TLR4 signaling
has been recently found to induce IL-17A secretion in druginduced hepatitis and myocardial I/R injury (Wang et al., 2013;
Zhu et al., 2013). However, whether HMGB1-TLR4 signaling
stimulates IL-17A secretion in brain ischemic injury is unclear.
One aim of our study is to investigate the possible role of
HMGB1-TLR4 signaling in the upstream pathway of IL-17A.
Glycyrrhizin, a triterpenoid saponin compound, is the
main constituent of Glycyrrhiza glabra and is composed of

a molecule of glycyrrhetinic acid and two molecules of
glucuronic acid. It has been shown that glycyrrhizin binds
directly with HMGB1 by interacting with two shallow concave
surfaces formed by the two arms of both HMG boxes in
HMGB1 (Mollica et al., 2007). This binding of HMGB1 was
shown to inhibit chemoattractant activity and mitogenic
activity of HMGB1 (Mollica et al., 2007). Recently, accumulating in vitro and in vivo evidences indicate that glycyrrhizin
could confer neuroprotective effects (Cherng et al., 2006; Kim
et al., 2012a).
In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective
effects of glycyrrhizin in the postischemic mice brain after
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and sought to
elucidate the molecular mechanism responsible for its neuroprotective effects. To gain a better insight into the mechanism by which HMGB1 aggravates brain I/R injury, we
investigated the relationships between HMGB1 and IL-17A.
In the present study, we show that glycyrrhizin affords robust
neuroprotection in the postischemic brain through inhibiting
IL-17A induced neuronal apoptosis. HMGB1 may promote
brain I/R injury through increase of IL-17A in a TLR4dependent manner.

Results

2.1.

Physiological parameters

Table 1 shows that systemic parameters including pH, blood
gases and blood pressure (BP) were all within normal range and
there were no differences among wild-type, II-17a  / , C3H/HeJ
and C3H/HeN mice. There were also no signiﬁcant difference in
regional cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) among wild-type, II-17a  / ,

C3H/HeJ and C3H/HeN mice 5 min after right common carotid
artery (CCA) ligation, middle cerebral artery (MCA) ligation or
reperfusion (Fig. 1).

2.2.
Glycyrrhizin suppressed infarct formation and
improved neurological deﬁcits in the postischemic brain
We used middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice to
induce focal cerebral ischemia in vivo. As shown in Fig. 2A,

treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the protein levels of cytosolic HMGB1 (B) representative photographs of TTC staining and

reduced mice infarct size and neurological defects. In contrast, 2 or 5 μg rHMGB1 administration signiﬁcantly increased brain
I/R injury at 3 days reperfusion after MCAO. However, administration of 1 μg rHMGB1 had no effect on brain I/R injury. ICV:

intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg glycyrrhizin signiﬁcantly
reduced the protein levels of cytosolic HMGB1 in the penumbral area following brain I/R injury, which showed that this
dose of glycyrrhizin effectively inhibited the protein expression of cytosolic HMGB1.
Fig. 2B shows representative experiment in which infarct
areas were stained with TTC 3 days after MCAO. The normal
tissue was stained deep red while the infarct area pale gray.
Functional evaluation was examined by an 18-point scoring
system after MCAO (Fig. 2C). Infarct volume and neurological
deﬁcits were largely decreased by glycyrrhizin. In contrast, 2
or 5 μg rHMGB1 treated mice had signiﬁcantly increases in
infarct volume and were associated with severe neurological
deﬁcits compared with MCAO group. However, administration of 1 μg rHMGB1 had no effect on infarct size and
neurological deﬁcits compared with MCAO group (Fig. 2B
and C). Therefore, the dose of 2 μg rHMGB1 was chosen for
our further experiments.

2.3.
HMGB1 stimulates the production of IL-17A
in a TLR4-dependent manner
To further support a role of HMGB1 on IL-17A production in
the mice MCAO model, we investigated the expression of
IL-17A protein in mice brains following MCAO by Western
blotting. It is notable here that glycyrrhizin administration
signiﬁcantly reduced the protein expression of IL-17A.
In contrast, recombinant HMGB1 (rHMGB1) administration signiﬁcantly increased IL-17A protein expression (Fig. 3A and B).
We next investigated whether HMGB1 signals through
TLR4 by using TLR4-defective C3H/HeJ mice. Compared to
wild-type C3H/HeN counterparts, IL-17A expression was signiﬁcantly reduced in C3H/HeJ mice. Administration of
rHMGB1 had no effect on the production of IL-17A when
injected into C3H/HeJ mice (Fig. 4A and B).

2.4.
IL-17A knockout reduced whereas repletion
of exogenous IL-17A increased brain I/R injury
To conﬁrm the effect of IL-17A on the brain I/R injury, we
performed TTC labeling of brain sections and functional evaluation to measure neuronal injury as previously described.
Three days after the ischemic attack, IL-17A knockout reduced
infarct size. Neurological score was also ameliorated signiﬁcantly in IL-17A knockout mice. In contrast, treatment with rIL17A (2 mg) signiﬁcantly increased infarct size and decreased
neurological scores 3 days after reperfusion (Fig. 5A and B).
However, rHMGB1 had no effects on infarct size and neurological deﬁcits in Il17a  / mice following I/R injury (Fig. 5A and B).

2.5.
IL-17A knockout reduced whereas repletion
of exogenous IL-17A increased neuronal apoptosis
In the current study, TUNEL staining showed two distinct
patterns of staining; it either densely stained or weakly
stained the neurons (Fig. 6). Numerous TUNEL positive
neurons were observed in the ischemic penumbra 72 h after
reperfusion. There was a signiﬁcant reduction of TUNEL
positive neurons in the penumbra of IL-17A knockout mice

Western blot, and the lower panel is a summary graph of
IL-17A protein levels relative to β-actin in wide-type C57BL/6
mice. Administration of glycyrrhizin signiﬁcantly reduced
the expression of IL-17A. In contrast, rHMGB1
administration signiﬁcantly increased IL-17A expression at
3 days reperfusion after MCAO. ICV: intracerebroventricular

compared with wide-type mice. The number of TUNEL
positive cells in the ischemic penumbra was signiﬁcantly
increased in the rIL-17A group compared with the vehicle
group (Fig. 6).
In order to further quantitatively assess the effects of
IL-17A on the activation of apoptotic pathways, Western blot
analysis were carried out to measure the levels of expression
of apoptosis regulatory proteins, such as bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic) and bax (pro-apoptotic). A signiﬁcant increase in bcl-2
expression and a decrease in bax expression were observed in
the penumbra of IL-17A knockout mice compared with widetype mice. However, treatment with rIL-17A could attenuate
the decreased expression of bax and the increased expression
of bcl-2 compared with the vehicle group (Fig. 7A).
In this study, the levels of activated caspase-3 were
determined by Western blot detection of a 17/19-kDa fragment (active form). IL-17A knockout decreased the level of
active caspase-3 protein to a greater extent compared to wide
type group. rIL-17A treatment signiﬁcantly increased the level

Discussion

This study shows that glycyrrhizin has a strong neuroprotective effect in the postischemic brain. Glycyrrhizin treatment
was found to decrease infarct formation and improved
neurological deﬁcits at 3 days after middle cerebral artery
occlusion-reperfusion. In addition, administration of glycyrrhizin signiﬁcantly inhibited HMGB1-induced IL-17A secretion. The present results suggest that neuroprotective effect
of glycyrrhizin is, at least in part, attributable to its inhibitory
effects on HMGB1 and subsequently inhibition of IL-17A
induced apoptosis in the postischemic brain.
Recently, a number of studies have indicated that brain
ischemic injury secondary to arterial occlusion is characterized by acute local inﬂammation. During reperfusion after
acute ischemia, neutrophils are believed to exacerbate tissue
damage by both physical obstruction of vessels and release of
oxygen radicals, proinﬂammatory cytokines, and cytolytic
enzymes (Kostulas et al., 1999). Recent reports have provided
evidence that IL-17A has been found to play an important
role in the neutrophils inﬁltration and neuronal damage

(Gelderblom et al., 2012; Shichita et al., 2009). Interleukin
(IL)-17A is a member of the IL-17 family, which includes six
structurally related isoforms: IL-17A, IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D,
IL-17E, and IL-17F (Kolls and Linden, 2004). Increasing evidence indicates that IL-17A does play a key role in the
inﬂammation after cerebral I/R injury. IL-17 contributes to
cerebral I/R injury by inducing neutrophils inﬁltration and
amplifying the production of neurotoxic factors (Gelderblom
et al., 2012; Shichita et al., 2009). Previous studies have
demonstrated that the expression of IL-17A peaked 3 days
after stroke (Gelderblom et al., 2012). Thus, 3 day time point is
chosen for our further study in cerebral I/R injury. We found
that anti–IL-17A monoclonal antibody treatment or IL-17A
knockout markedly ameliorated cerebral I/R injury, which
was consistent with previous studies (Gelderblom et al.,
2012). Conversely, 2 μg rIL-17A signiﬁcantly increased cerebral
I/R injury, further indicating that IL-17A plays an important
role in ischemic I/R injury. Thus, we sought to determine the
mechanism of action and regulation of IL-17A in cerebral I/R
injury.
Previous studies have demonstrated that serum HMGB1
stimulates the production of IL-17A by γδ T cells in a TLR4dependent manner in drug-induced liver injury and cardiomyocyte I/R injury (Wang et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2013).
HMGB1, a well-known DAMP, has been implicated in several
disease states, including sepsis, arthritis, I/R injury, and
cancer (Sims et al., 2010; Tang et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2012).
HMGB1 is passively released from the nucleus to the extracellular milieu by cells that die as a result of necrosis or
damage (Degryse et al., 2001). Preliminary results suggest that
HMGB1 is massively released from necrotic neurons in the
postischemic brain and contributes to cerebral I/R injury (Kim
et al., 2008, 2012a, 2012b; Qiu et al., 2008). And extracellular
HMGB1 activates microglia and prompts induction of proinﬂammatory mediators in brain ischemic injury (Yang et al.,
2010). HMGB1 also has been found to connect excitotoxicityinduced acute damage processes and delayed inﬂammatory
processes in the post-ischemic brain (Kim et al., 2006). In this
study, we found that glycyrrhizin markedly reduced IL-17A
expression and ameliorated cerebral I/R injury. In contrast,
rHMGB1 increased IL-17A expression and markedly increased
I/R injury, conﬁrming the crucial role played by HMGB1 in the
postischemic brain. However, rHMGB1 had no effects on
infarct size and neurological deﬁcits in Il17a  /  mice following brain I/R injury. It indicates that HMGB1 could induce
IL-17A secretion and expends current knowledge of the
immune reaction activated by HMGB1 in ischemic stroke.
Previous studies demonstrate that HMGB1 acts through
multiple receptors, including advanced glycation end products (RAGE), Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and TLR4 (Andersson
and Tracey, 2011). TLR4 seems to play a major role in
ischemic brain injury (Hyakkoku et al., 2010). In the present
study, we showed that HMGB1 stimulated the production of
IL-17A in a TLR4-dependent manner in cerebral I/R injury, as
demonstrated by greatly diminished IL-17A production in
response to in vivo HMGB1 stimulation in C3H/HeJ mice,
which belong to a strain that expresses a phenotype analogous to that of TLR4 knockout mice due to a missense
mutation in the TLR4 gene, thus hindering signal transduction (Qureshi et al., 1999). The point of view was also tested in

treatment with rIL-17A (2 lg) signiﬁcantly increased infarct size and decreased neurological scores. However, rHMGB1 treatment
had no effects on mice infarct size and neurological deﬁcits in Il17a  / mice. ICV: intracerebroventricular injection; Il17a  / :

drug-induced liver injury and cardiomyocyte I/R injury (Wang
et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2013). Although absence of functional
TLR4 signaling in C3H/HeJ mice was insufﬁcient to completely eliminate the effect of HMGB1, we cannot rule out the
possibility that HMGB1 may also act through other receptors
(e.g., TLR2 and RAGE) or other pathways. In addition, whether
HMGB1 affects directly the IL-17A producing cells or it rather
functions via activation of immune cells, which are then
regulating IL-17A producing immune cells, further studies
will be required to answer these questions.
Apoptosis is one of the main forms of neurocyte death in
the ischemic penumbra during the progression of ischemic
stroke. Interactions between the pro-apoptotic Bax and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins on the mitochondrial outer
membrane are believed to play an important role in cell
survival (Vela et al., 2013). Bcl-2—overexpressing transgenic
mice are resistant to cerebral ischemia (Martinou et al., 1994),
and, conversely, antisense bcl-2 treatment exacerbates
ischemic brain damage (Chen et al., 2000). Our results showed

that IL-17A knockout signiﬁcantly decreased Bax expression
but increased Bcl-2 expression in brain I/R injury. However,
rIL-17A treatment signiﬁcantly increased Bax expression but
decreased Bcl-2 expression.
Caspases, a family of cysteine proteases related to the
execution of apoptosis in mammals, are implicated in the
cerebral damage induced by focal ischemia (Hara et al., 1997).
Among the mechanisms for activating caspases, the Bcl-2
family proteins play crucial roles by regulating the release of
cytochrome c, from the mitochondria (Du et al., 2000). Release
of cytochrome c triggers active caspase-3 and ultimately
induces cell apoptosis. Our results showed that the protein
level of activated caspase-3 was signiﬁcantly decreased in
il-17a  /  mice compared to wide type mice. There was a
signiﬁcant reduction of TUNEL positive neurons in the
penumbra of IL-17A knockout mice. In contrast, activated
caspase-3 was signiﬁcantly increased in rIL-17A group compared to vehicle group. And TUNEL positive neurons were
also signiﬁcantly increased in rIL-17A-treated mice.

Glucocorticoids have been shown to inﬂuence neuronal
function and metabolism in multiple ways. Through binding
and activating glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR), glucocorticoids inﬂuence survival/

function of CNS neurons (Numakawa et al., 2013). GR are
abundantly expressed in the brain (Morimoto et al., 1996).
Previous studies have shown that glycyrrhizin have a role in
glucocorticoid metabolism (Ramli et al., 2013; Yoh et al., 2002).

decreased the bcl-2 expression and increased the bax expression. (B) The expression level of active caspase-3 protein was
also examined by Western blot. Active caspase-3 expression decreased in il-17a  /  mice. However, rIL-17A treatment

However, it is unclear whether glycyrrhizin exerts its neuroprotective effects through mediating glucocorticoids metabolism in stroke. Further studies are needed to answer the
question.
In conclusion, glycyrrhizin affords robust neuroprotection
in the postischemic brain through inhibiting IL-17A induced
neuronal apoptosis. Our results provide a better insight into
the mechanism by which HMGB1 aggravates brain I/R injury
and identiﬁes a previously unrecognized mechanism of
HMGB1 in the IL-17A-induced brain I/R injury. In this mechanism, HMGB1 stimulates IL-17A signaling pathway in a TLR4dependent manner. IL-17A is a key point in controlling
HMGB1-induced brain I/R injury. Considering robust neuroprotective effects of glycyrrhizin in MCAO animal model,
investigation on the improvement of therapeutic potency of
glycyrrhizin by modiﬁcation and by producing formulation is
worth pursuing.

University of Science and Technology prior to the initiation of
experimentation. Male C57BL/6 mice (wild-type) (8–10 weeks
old, 23–25 g) were purchased from Wuhan University Laboratory
Animal Center. Male IL-17A knockout (II-17a  / ) mice in a
C57BL/6 background were kindly provided by Y. Iwakura (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (Nakae
et al., 2002). Male C3H/HeJ mice, which have a spontaneous
mutation in the Toll/IL-1 receptor domain of TLR4 (Tlr4Lps-d)
(Poltorak et al., 1998) and control WT C3H/HeN mice were also
purchased from Wuhan University Laboratory Animal Center.
All animals were housed in standard plastic cages in a
temperature-controlled room (2272 1C) on a 12 h reverse lightdark cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum.

Focal cerebral ischemia model

Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by transient occlusion of
the right middle cerebral artery (tMCAO) with a 6-0 siliconecoated nylon monoﬁlament, as previously described (Hata
et al., 1998). Brieﬂy, anesthesia was induced with ketamine
(100 mg/kg, i.p.) and xylazine (8 mg/kg, i.p.). Under the operating microscope, the right common carotid artery (CCA), the
right external carotid artery (ECA), and the right internal
carotid artery (ICA) were isolated and a 6-0 suture was tied
at the origin of the ECA and at the distal end of the ECA.

184

brain research 1582 (2014) 176–186

The right CCA and ICA were temporarily occluded. The
silicon-coated nylon suture was introduced into the ECA
and pushed up the ICA until resistance was felt and the
ﬁlament was inserted about 9 to 10 mm from the carotid
bifurcation, effectively blocking the middle cerebral artery
(MCA). The diameter of the tip of coated suture was considered acceptable between 180 and 220 μm. The suture
remained inserted for 60 min, after which it was removed
and the ECA was permanently tied. In the sham controls, the
arteries were visualized but not disturbed. Regional cerebral
blood ﬂow (CBF) was measured by continuous laser-Doppler
ﬂowmeter (Periﬂux system 5000, PERIMED, Stockholm, Sweden) with a laser doppler probe placed 7 mm lateral and
2 mm posterior to bregma in a thinned cranial skull window
from the beginning of the MCAO surgery until 15 min after
reperfusion. Body temperature was maintained at 3770.5 1C
during and after the surgery with a heating pad. During these
experiments, blood pressure (BP) was monitored through a
femoral artery and blood gas was analyzed at the end (i.e. 3
days after tMCAO or sham procedure). Subcutaneous normal
saline (0.9%) was administered daily, adjusting the volume
according to the animal's weight loss.

4.3.

Experimental groups

As shown in Fig. 1, all C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided
into ﬁve groups: (1) sham group (Sham); (2) Cerebral I/R group
(I/R) (60 min ischemia followed by 3 day reperfusion); (3)
recombinant mouse-IL-17A (rIL-17A) treatment group: mice
were injected IV with 2 μg rIL-17A diluted in PBS containing
0.1% albumin (R&D System, Minneapolis, MN) or PBS containing 0.1% albumin 5 min prior to reperfusion; (4) rHMGB1
treatment group: Full-length, LPS-free recombinant HMGB1
protein was provided by ebioscience. Mice were injected
intracerebroventricularly with 1, 2 and 5 μg rHMGB1 diluted
in normal saline (NS) 1, 24 and 48 h after MCAO; 5) Glycyrrhizin treatment group: 10 mg/mouse glycyrrhizin (TCI,
Shanghai, China) or normal saline was administrated intraperitoneally 1, 24 and 48 h after MCAO.
Male Il17a  /  mice (n ¼9) were also subject to 60 min
ischemia followed by 3 days reperfusion. C3H/HeJ and control
WT C3H/HeN mice were subject to 60 min ischemia followed
by 3 days reperfusion. They were divided into 3 groups: (1)
Control cerebral I/R group (C3H/HeN); (2) Cerebral I/R group
(C3H/HeJ); (3) rHMGB1 treatment group (C3H/HeJ): mice were
injected intracerebroventricularly with 2 μg recombinant
HMGB1 1, 24 and 48 h after MCAO.

4.4.

Neurological scoring

Neurological scores were evaluated with a scoring system
(Garcia et al., 1995) by a blinded observer. An 18-point scoring
system was used to evaluate the sensorimotor deﬁcits. The
scale was based on the following six tests: (1) spontaneous
activity (0 to 3 points); (2) symmetry in the movement of four
limbs (0 to 3 points); (3) forepaw outstretching (0 to 3 points);
(4) climbing (1 to 3 points); (5) body proprioception (1 to 3
points); and (6) response to vibrissae touch (1 to 3 points). The
six individual test scores were summed up at the end of the
evaluation (minimum score, 3; maximum score, 18).

4.5.

Assessment of cerebral infarct size

Brains were removed 3 days after reperfusion and mildly
frozen at  20 1C for 10 min to keep the morphology intact
during slicing. In brief, brains were sliced into 5 serial 1 mm
coronal sections and incubated in a 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Amresco, Solon, OH, USA) for 15 min at
37 1C and then transferred into a 4% paraformaldehyde in
phosphate buffer for ﬁxation at 4 1C. TTC-stained sections
were collected by a Canon EOS D60 digital camera. The extent
of ischemic infarction was traced and the integrated volume
was calculated using Image J software (NIH, USA). The
relative infarction volume was expressed as percentage of
the corrected infarct volume in the whole brain volume.

4.6.

Western blotting

Total protein extraction from the penumbra of the stroke was
performed according to a commercially available kit (KGP250;
Nanjing Keygen Biotech Co. Ltd., Nanjing, China). Cytosolic
protein extraction was performed according to the Nuclear
and Cytoplasmic Extraction kit (Beyotime, Jiangsu, China).
Cytosolic protein extracts were for analysis by Western
blotting for HMGB1. Equal amounts of total protein extracts
were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes (Millipore) by electrophoresis,
and membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST
(0.1% Tween 20 in TBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 1C with anti-IL-17A
(1:500; Abclonal, Shanghai, China), anti-HMGB1 (Abclonal
technology, wuhan, china), anti-bcl-2 (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, USA), anti-bax (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, USA), anticleaved-caspase-3 (1:500, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
USA), anti-β-actin (1:2000; Santa Cruz, CA, USA) followed by
horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG antibody (1:3000; Proteintech Group, Inc., Wuhan, Hubei,
China) or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:3000; Proteintech Group,
Inc., Wuhan, Hubei, China). Labeled proteins were detected
with the ChemiDocXRSþchemiluminescence imaging system
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Protein bands were quantiﬁed
by Image Lab™ image acquisition and analysis software.

4.7.

Double-labeling of TUNEL and NeuN

The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular
Biochemicals, Inc., Mannheim, Germany). To verify the neuronal identity of TUNEL positive cells, sections were washed
in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 (TX-100) and permeabilized with PBS
containing 1% TX-100 for 30 min. The sections were washed
with PBS/0.2% TX-100 again. Nonspeciﬁc binding sites were
blocked with 2% NGS in PBS/0.2% TX-100. The sections were
incubated with rabbit anti-NeuN antibody (Abclonal technology, wuhan, china)/PBS/0.2% TX-100 overnight at 4 1C. The
sections were washed and incubated with CY3 goat antirabbit IgG for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, sections were then incubated with TUNEL reaction mixture for
60 min at 37 1C in a humidiﬁed chamber. Finally, DAPI was
added for 10 min at room temperature. The total number of

brain research 1582 (2014) 176–186

TUNEL-positive neurons in the ipsilateral hemisphere was
counted in three different ﬁelds for each section by an
investigator who was blinded to the studies.

4.8.

Statistical analysis

All values are expressed as mean7SEM. Multiple comparisons were performed by ANOVA followed by Newman–Keuls
multiple comparison tests. Two groups were compared by
unpaired t test. The neurological score data comparison was
analyzed using Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney nonparametric
test. Differences were considered signiﬁcant at Po0.05.
