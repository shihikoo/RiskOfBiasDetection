Memory deficits are common among stroke survivors. Identifying neuroprotective agents that can prevent memory impairment or improve memory recovery is a vital area of research. Glycogen synthase kinase-3b (GSK-3b) is involved in several
essential intracellular signaling pathways. Unlike many other kinases, GSK-3b is active only when dephosphorylated and
activation promotes inflammation and apoptosis. In contrast, increased phosphorylation leads to reduced GSK-3b
(pGSK-3b) activity. GSK-3b inhibition has beneficial effects on memory in other disease models. GSK-3b regulates both
the 5′ AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and transforming growth factor-b-activated kinase (TAK1) pathways. In this work,
we examined the effect of GSK-3b inhibition, both independently, in conjunction with a TAK inhibitor, and in AMPKa2 deficient mice, after stroke to investigate mechanistic interactions between these pathways. GSK-3b inhibition was neuroprotective and ameliorated stroke-induced cognitive impairments. This was independent of AMPK signaling as the protective effects of GSK-3b inhibition were seen in AMPK deficient mice. However, GSK-3b inhibition provided no additive
protection in mice treated with a TAK inhibitor suggesting that TAK1 is an upstream regulator of GSK-3b. Targeting GSK3b could be a novel therapeutic strategy for post-stroke cognitive deficits.

Stroke is the primary cause of long-term adult disability and the
fourth leading cause of death in the USA (Feigin et al. 2003;
Lloyd-Jones et al. 2010; Vaartjes et al. 2013). Ischemic strokes accounts for 80%– 85% of all strokes (Go et al. 2014). Despite the
global burden of stroke, only one FDA-approved therapy is available to treat ischemic stroke patients, the thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator (Ziegler et al. 2005). tPA can only be used in
a small percentage of patients due to its short therapeutic time
window and numerous contraindications (Ziegler et al. 2005).
As our population ages the prevalence and incidence of cerebrovascular disease will continue to increase (Lloyd-Jones et al.
2010; Vaartjes et al. 2013), as will the number of individuals
with post-stroke cognitive deficits. While hospital costs account
for three-fourths of total stroke care costs, the cost of long-term
chronic care is a major economic concern. Stroke survivors with
physical or cognitive impairments often need community-based
care or nursing home placement. No neuroprotective agents
have demonstrated benefit in clinical trials, suggesting the growing need to explore novel pathways and targets.
Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is an evolutionary conserved ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase consisting of two distinct isoforms, GSK-3a and GSK-3b (Liang and Chuang 2007).
It is a multifaceted protein that is highly expressed in the mammalian brain and involved in diverse cellular and neurophysiological functions (Chuang et al. 2011). One of the most notable
qualities of GSK-3 is the vast number of signaling pathways that
converge on it, suggesting that it may be an important biological target (Forde and Dale 2007; Miura and Miki 2009). GSK-3 is
constitutively active under normal resting conditions (Peineau
et al. 2008). A growing body of evidence indicates that activated

GSK-3 is pro-apoptotic (Jendželovský et al. 2012). GSK-3 is inactivated by phosphorylation at Ser9 (McManus et al. 2005;
Chuang et al. 2011). Dysregulation of GSK-3-mediated substrate
phosphorylation and signaling has been implicated in several
pathophysiological conditions including cancer (Luo 2009), Alzheimer’s disease (Engel et al. 2006), diabetes (Eldar-Finkelman
et al. 1999), and mood disorders (Li and Jope 2010).
GSK-3 acts as a regulator of apoptosis and inflammation,
known contributors to stroke-induced cell death (Gao et al.
2008). Loss of GSK-3b, not GSK-3a, suppressed spontaneous neuronal death in extended culture models (Liang and Chuang 2007).
Nonselective GSK-3b inhibition with lithium is neuroprotective
(Chuang et al. 2011; Wei et al. 2013) and GSK-3b inhibitors are
currently being tested in clinical trials for treatment of cognitive
deficits and dementia (Hong-Qi et al. 2012). GSK-3b is known
to interact with the mitogen-activated protein kinase family
(MAPKs) and promotes signaling after stress (Kim et al. 2003).
Transforming growth factor-b-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) is a member of the MAPK family that is also known as mitogen-activated
protein kinase kinase kinase-7. TAK1 is activated by TGF-b, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), and other cytokines including
interleukin-1 (IL-1) (Takaesu et al. 2001). TAK is also an upstream
kinase of 5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase
(AMPK), a key energy sensing kinase involved in stroke. We
have recently found that inhibition of TAK1 is neuroprotective
after focal ischemia (White et al. 2012). Our previous work demonstrated that neuroprotective effects of TAK1 inhibition are independent of its activation of AMPK (White et al. 2012).

GSK-3b inhibition improves stroke outcomes

6.1% for vehicle versus 75.1% + 5.8% for drug, P . 0.05, n ¼ 4/vehicle group, n ¼ 4/drug group) which showed the expected preference for a novel versus a familiar object (Fig. 2C; Bevins and
Besheer 2006). GSK-3b inhibitor treated mice showed significantly improved time spent on rotarod compared with vehicletreated group at 6 d after stroke (41 + 6 s for vehicle versus 67 +
9 s for GSK-3b inhibitor, P , 0.05, n ¼ 9/group). No differences
between drug and vehicle groups were seen in spontaneous locomotor activity in the open field (1332 + 123 for vehicle versus
1476 + 198 for drug).

In the present study, we utilized GSK-3b Inhibitor VIII, a
specific and highly potent GSK-3b inhibitor to examine the effects
of GSK-3b inhibition on ischemic injury and stroke-induced
memory impairment. Furthermore, we investigated interactions
between GSK-3b, AMPK, and TAK1 signaling by using combined
treatment paradigms and coimmunoprecipitation.

Results
GSK-3b inhibition significantly reduced infarct size
Significantly reduced infarct volumes were seen after ischemic
stroke with both early and delayed inhibition of GSK-3b. Immediate treatment with a GSK-3b inhibitor at the onset of stroke led
to a significant reduction in cortical (vehicle 51.1 + 2.8 versus
drug 40.1 + 3.7; P , 0.05), striatal (vehicle 67.8 + 1.6 versus drug
54.8 + 3.4; P , 0.05), and total hemisphere (49.4 + 2.6 versus
drug 35.9 + 2.4; P , 0.05) (n ¼ 10/vehicle group; n ¼ 11/drug
group) infarct at 48 h of reperfusion (Fig. 1A,B). Interestingly, similar protective effects were also observed when treatment was delayed, with the first dose administered 2 h after ischemia and a
second dose 24 h after ischemic onset, in the cortex (vehicle
54.8 + 2.8 versus drug 39.2 + 3.8; P , 0.05), striatum (vehicle
63.8 + 2.1 versus drug 51.6 + 3.2; P , 0.05), and in total hemisphere (vehicle 49.7 + 3.1 versus drug 32.2 + 1.6; P , 0.05) (Fig.
2A,B) (n ¼ 10/group) even 7 d after injury. Three mice from the vehicle treated and one mouse from the GSK-3b inhibitor treated
group died by day 7 of reperfusion. No mortality was observed
in either vehicle or in GSK-3b inhibitor treated groups at 48 h after
reperfusion.

Treatment with a GSK-3b inhibitor significantly increased
pGSK-3b levels but did not change pLKB1, b-Catenin,
pAMPK, or pTAK1 levels
Western blot analysis was performed on brain lysates 6 h after
stroke (Fig. 3). ANOVA for changes in GSK-3b protein levels
showed stroke alone significantly increased pGSK-3b protein
levels compared with shams in vehicle-treated groups (sham
1.0 + 0.3 versus stroke 2.2 + 0.3; P , 0.05). Treatment with the
GSK-3b inhibitor further increased pGSK-3b levels after stroke
(sham 1.4 + 0.2 versus stroke 3.2 + 0.14; P , 0.01), implying significant additional effects of the drug in stroke mice (Fig. 3; n ¼
4/sham group; n ¼ 6/drug group).). We did not see any significant
changes in pLKB1 levels with inhibitor treatment. No significant
changes were seen in b-Catenin, pAMPK, or pTAK1 levels with
drug treatment at this time point (data not shown).

GSK-3b inhibition was neuroprotective and improved
memory even in the absence of AMPK
A significant neuroprotective effect of the GSK-3b inhibitor VIII
was seen in AMPK-a2 KO mice compared with vehicle-treated
AMPK-a2 KO mice (n ¼ 10/group), in the cortex (42.9 + 3.5 versus
30.0 + 4.9; P , 0.05), striatum (54.6 + 5.0 versus 43.1 + 3.4; P ,
0.05), and in the total hemisphere infarcts (36.8 + 3.4 versus
26.9 + 3.2; P , 0.05) (Fig. 4A). Significant differences in neurological scores between groups were seen that showed an improved
functional outcome in the GSK-3b inhibitor treated group
1.0[0.5], compared with the vehicle group, 2.0[0.5], n ¼ 10/group;
P , 0.05. Compared with vehicle (54.6% + 3.5%), the GSK-3b
inhibitor VIII treated cohort (69.0% + 4.3%) spent significantly
more time with novel object; n ¼ 10/group (Fig. 4B). No significant differences were seen in spontaneous locomotor activity.

GSK-3b inhibition improved neurological deficit scores
and post-stroke cognitive performance in the novel
object-recognition test (NORT)
Improved neurological deficit scores were seen with GSK-3b inhibition 48 h after stroke with both immediate treatment (Vehicle
3[0.25] n ¼ 10 versus Drug 1[0.25]; n ¼ 11; P , 0.05) and with delayed treatment (Vehicle 2[0] n ¼ 10 versus Drug 1.0[0.5]; n ¼ 10;
P , 0.05). At 7 d, delayed treatment (given 2 and 24 h after onset of stroke) significantly reduced stroke-induced cognitive deficits as measured by the novel object-recognition test (NORT);
46.6% + 3.5% with vehicle versus 64.0% + 3.1% with GSK-3b
inhibitor VIII, P , 0.05, (n ¼ 9/group). No significant differences
were seen between drug versus vehicle in sham mice (66.9% +

We then investigated whether an additive neuroprotective effect was seen
with simultaneous inhibition of both
TAK1 and GSK-3b. Compared with GSK3b inhibition alone, combined GSK3b + TAK1 inhibition did not offer any

disorders (Koh et al. 2008; Hong et al.

To further investigate if TAK1 interacts with pGSK-3b, brain homogenates from additional cohorts of mice were examined 6 h after sham and stroke surgery to determine if the neuroprotective
effect and cognitive improvement seen with GSK-3b and TAK1
inhibition occurs via a direct interaction between TAK1 and
pGSK-3b. Coimmunoprecipitation studies with anti-TAK1 and
anti-pGSK-3b antibodies in brain homogenates revealed a clear interaction between TAK1 and pGSK-3b in both stroke and sham
brain lysates (Fig. 6). IgG controls and whole lysate were run for
controls.

GSK-3b inhibition improves stroke outcomes

The roles for GSK-3 in neuronal differentiation, maturation,
and development are increasingly recognized. For example, overexpression of GSK-3b in the central nervous system of developing
mice results in a reduction in the size of the brain and spinal
cord (Spittaels et al. 2002), and GSK-3b gene disruption causes embryonic lethality (Hoeflich et al. 2000). One of the most studied
mechanisms of GSK-3 regulation is via the canonical Wnt pathway (Valvezan and Klein 2012). Although we observed a significant increase in GSK-3b phosphorylation with drug treatment,
we did not find a corresponding decrease in b-Catenin phosphorylation (data not shown). Similar findings were reported in recent
study using a traumatic brain injury model (Dash et al. 2011), the
reason for this is not clear at present, it is possible that the activity
of GSK-3a, which can also phosphorylate b-Catenin, was unaffected by stroke (Soutar et al. 2010; Dash et al. 2011) and maintained b-Catenin phosphorylation levels.
In our previous studies, we found that global AMPK inhibition or genetic deletion of the catalytic a2 isoform confers neuroprotection after stroke, demonstrating that AMPK-a2 is critical in
the response to an ischemic challenge (McCullough et al. 2005;
Li et al. 2007; Venna et al. 2012a). The mechanisms by which
acute AMPK activation increases ischemic damage remains unclear, but increased glucose uptake due to unregulated glucose
transporters in the reperfusion phase, enhanced lactate accumulation, and increased autophagy likely contribute to increased neuronal death after ischemic reperfusion (McCullough et al. 2005;
Li et al. 2007; Arsikin et al. 2012). A recent study has shown that
GSK-3b acts as a critical sensor for anabolic signaling and regulates
AMPK; others have found that AMPK activation mediates learning
and memory (Suzuki et al. 2013; Kobilo et al. 2014). To address
the role of AMPK in the neuroprotective and cognitive benefit
of GSK-3b inhibition, we treated AMPK-a2 deficient mice with

inhibitor VIII (Koh et al. 2008). Earlier
studies that utilized GSK-3b inhibitor
VIII were performed in in vitro cell culture systems (Nair and Olanow 2008)
but in vivo rat models have also demonstrated the efficacy of this agent when administered through the external jugular
vein (Koh et al. 2007, 2008). Although a
few studies have shown a benefit of nonselective GSK inhibitors in stroke, these
were limited by lack of pharmacological
specificity of the inhibitor used, and the
mechanism was not clearly identified.
Most of these studies also only examined
inhibition initiated prior to or immediately at the onset of stroke, and assessed
only acute endpoints (1 –2 d), limiting
their translational relevance. Changes
in pGSK-3b levels have been previously
documented after stroke (Chuang et al.
2011; Wei et al. 2013). Consistent with
these earlier studies we found that
stroke-induced phosphorylation of GSK3b, suggesting that GSK-3b activation
may be an endogenous neuroprotective response to stroke. Treatment with
GSK-3b inhibitor VIII further inhibited
GSK-3b as visualized as increased pGSK3b in drug-treated brain lysates at 6 h
after stroke confirming the potency and
bioavailability of the inhibitor (Liang
and Chuang 2007).

pathogenesis of dementia and memory disorders, and that the development of GSK-3b-specific inhibitors is ongoing, GSK-3b inhibitors may become a viable therapeutic intervention for both
acute stroke and to treat post-stroke cognitive deficits.

GSK-3b inhibitor VIII. AMPK-a2 deficient mice have smaller infarcts at baseline compared with WT mice (Li et al. 2007). We hypothesized that the GSK-3b inhibitor would be ineffective in the
absence of catalytic AMPK-a2 if signaling was mediated by the
same pathway. To our surprise, the GSK-3b inhibitor maintained
its neuroprotective effects and increased cognitive recovery in
these knockout mice. This suggests that neuroprotective effects
of GSK-3b inhibition are mediated through pathways that are independent of AMPK signaling.
Once it was clear that AMPK was not the signaling pathway
by which GSK-3 b inhibition exerts its neuroprotective effects in
this model, we investigated the role of TAK1. GSK has been recently demonstrated to increase the stabilization of TAK1’s interaction
with its binding partner, TAB (TAK1-binding protein) (Bang et al.
2013), but no studies have investigated the direct interaction of
GSK-3b and TAK1. Acute inhibition of TAK1 is neuroprotective
and stroke-induced memory deficits can be ameliorated by TAK1
inhibition (White et al. 2012). Activation of TAK1 enhances caspase activity via downstream JNK signaling (Sanna et al. 2002).
TAK1 has also been implicated in pro-inflammatory signaling
through induction of the transcription factor AP-1 with the subsequent expression of inflammatory genes such as COX-2 (Sanna
et al. 2002; Zhang et al. 2010b). GSK-3b also has a strong regulatory effect on inflammation in neurodegeneration models that have
associated impairments in memory. Although GSK3b and TAK1
appear to share similar mechanisms that regulate cell survival
or cell death, it is unknown if they interact with each other after
injury. Interestingly, no additive neuroprotective effect was seen
with combined TAK and GSK inhibition suggesting that these
share a common signaling pathway (Supplemental Fig. 2). Although it is possible that there was a “floor” effect, this is unlikely
as the residual infarct was still .30% of the ischemic hemisphere
even after combination treatment, due to the length of the occlusion. Infarct in this model has the potential to be reduced to as low
as 16% (Zhang et al. 2010a). However, treatment with the GSK3b
inhibitor had no effect on pTAK1 levels. To directly assess interaction after ischemic injury, we performed co-IP studies. A clear
TAK1/pGSK-3b interaction was seen, and this interaction was reduced after stroke. We speculate that this TAK1/pGSK-3b interaction restrains deleterious pro-apoptotic signaling during stroke,
and is consistent with our results showing that the inhibition
TAK1 or GSK3b is neuroprotective. The downstream effects and
targets of this TAK1/pGSK-3b interaction are not yet known but
likely include JNK/c-Jun signaling as seen in prior studies (White
et al. 2012). While these findings are encouraging, this work has
several limitations. This study only used pharmacological methods, as mice with genetic deletion of GSK3b are unavailable due
to lethality. In addition the effects seen on cognitive “recovery”
may simply reflect the reduction in infarct size, and the acute neuroprotective effects of the inhibitor, rather than enhanced recovery. In addition mice were studied for only 1 wk post stroke. In
clinical settings, cognitive deficits may improve even months to

Materials and Methods
Experimental animals
C57Bl/6 male mice were purchased from Charles River laboratories (Wilmington, MA). All mice used for these experiments
were 20 –25 g, housed five per cage with ad libitum access to
food and water. All animal work was approved by the Center for
Animal Care at University of Connecticut Health Center and
was performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health
guidelines. Surgical procedures were performed following the
five criteria derived from the stroke therapy academic industry
roundtable (STAIR) group guidelines for preclinical evaluation
of stroke therapeutics: (1) cerebral blood flow was monitored by
using laser Doppler to confirm the MCA occlusion; (2) mice
were randomly assigned to treatment groups; (3) investigators
were blinded to treatment administration; (4) analysis were performed by researcher blinded to treatments; and (5) core body
temperature were monitored and maintained during the surgery
period (Philip et al. 2009).

Drugs and treatment groups
The potent GSK-3b Inhibitor, GSK-3b Inhibitor VIII, was purchased from Calbiochem, a highly selective TAK1 inhibitor, 5Z7-oxozeaenol was purchased from Tocris Bioscience and both
inhibitors were diluted in a small quantity (5 mg/130 mL) of
DMSO (Sigma) and the desired volume was achieved by adding saline (Hospira) pH balanced to 7.4. Control mice were treated with
a corresponding volume of DMSO in saline (vehicle). Dose volumes were 100 mL/10 g body weight. Inhibitors and their doses
were carefully selected from the literature and from our previous
study using TAK1 inhibitor (Koh et al. 2008; White et al. 2012).
All control animals were treated with equal volume of vehicle.
For first experiment mice were treated with GSK-3b Inhibitor
VIII (4 mg/kg, 10 min before the onset intraperitoneally (i.p.))

Figure 6. Coimmunoprecipitation followed by Western blot revealed
that TAK1 interacts with pGSK-3b. Co-ip of whole-cell lysate obtained
from sham (sh) and stroke (ss) hemispheres of TAK1 (total, rabbit) lysate
probed with pGSK-3b (mouse) demonstrated a significant interaction of
TAK1 and pGSK-3b in both sham and stroke brains. Flow through and
IgG controls were used as positive controls.

and second doses were injected at 24 h from the onset of MCAO.
Infarct analysis was performed on brains after 48 h of reperfusion.
For the second set of experiments the GSK-3b Inhibitor VIII (4
mg/kg) treatment was delayed and doses were administered at 2
and 24 h after the onset of stroke. To test durability of the effect
the infarcts were analyzed at 7 d after stroke. An additional cohort
of AMPK-a2 KO mice were used to investigate the efficacy of the
GSK-3b inhibitor in a similar paradigm as above, with delayed
dosing as in the second set of experiments. A separate cohort
of animals was used to test the combined effect of TAK and GSK
inhibitors. Mice were either treated with GSK-3b Inhibitor VIII
(4 mg/kg) alone or in combination with the TAK inhibitor
5Z-7-oxozeaenol (5 mg/kg) administered i.p. 2 h after the onset
of stroke with a second dose at 24 h after stroke. Infarcts analysis
and NORT were performed at 7 d of reperfusion.

open-field chambers were cleaned after each individual test session using 70% ethanol (White et al. 2012).

Object-recognition test
The novel object-recognition test (NORT) was performed as described earlier (Bevins and Besheer 2006; White et al. 2012). In
brief, animals were placed individually in a Plexiglas chamber
containing two identical objects and allowed to habituate with
the objects for duration of 10 min at 7 d after stroke. Animals
should spend at least 38 sec with each object to be selected for
test. Mice were returned to their home cages and were reintroduced 1 h later for a 5-min exploration test, at this time one of
the objects was replaced with a novel object. Data was recorded
by an investigator blinded to treatment conditions and time spent
exploring the novel object was expressed as a percentage.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion model
Cerebral ischemia was induced by 90 min of reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) under Isoflurane anesthesia, as described previously (Venna et al. 2012b; White et al. 2012). In brief,
a midline ventral neck incision was made, and unilateral right
MCAO was performed by advancing a 6.0 silicone-coated nylon
monofilament into the internal carotid artery 6 mm from the internal carotid-pterygopalatine artery bifurcation via an external
carotid artery stump. Rectal temperatures were continuously
monitored with a Monotherm system (VWR LabShop) and temperature was maintained with a heating pad at 37˚C during surgery and ischemia. Separate cohorts of mice were used to assess
changes in physiological variables such as mean arterial blood
pressure and cortical cerebral perfusion data were obtained as previously described (Li et al. 2010). Cerebral blood flow measurements by laser Doppler flowmetry (DRT 4/Moor Instruments
Ltd) confirmed ischemic occlusion (reduction to 85% of baseline)
during MCAO and restoration of blood flow during reperfusion.
Surgical controls are used for Western blot analysis, a sham surgery in which the suture was not advanced into the carotid artery
(controls). Additional cohorts (n ¼ 4/group) were used for investigating differences in physiological parameters.

Rotarod
Prior to stroke all animals were trained four trials per day for 3 d on
the rotarod apparatus (Med Associates). Latency was assessed by
measuring the length of time each mouse remained on the rotating drum as it accelerated from 4 to 40 rpm over a span of 2 min.
The latency of each mouse to fall from the rotating drum was recorded for each trial (in seconds), and the average latency was
used for further analysis. Animals were then tested on day 2 and
day 6 after surgery, with four trials as in the training period, and
the average latency was recorded.

Western blotting

After 48 h or 7 d of reperfusion all animals were euthanized, brains
for infarct analysis were collected and hardened at 220˚C for 5
min, cut into five 2-mm coronal sections and stained with 1.5%
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) for 8 min at 38˚C.
Slices were formalin-fixed (4%) and then digitalized and infarct
volumes analyzed using Sigma Scan Pro software as previously described (Venna et al. 2012b). The final infarct volumes are presented as percentage volume (percentage of contralateral structures
with correction for edema).

Western blots were performed as described previously (Venna
et al. 2012b; White et al. 2012). Six hours after the onset of cerebral ischemia or a sham surgery with vehicle and GSK-3b inhibitor
treatment, the mice were euthanized; brains were rapidly collected and flash frozen. The brain was homogenized in lysis buffer, a
BCA assay was performed to determine protein concentrations
and an equal amount of protein was loaded on a 4%–15% gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate– polyacrylamide gel and subsequently
transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. p-GSK-3b
(Ser-9) (1:2500;Santa Cruz Biotechnology), TAK1 (1:500; Cell
Signaling Technologies), b-Catenin (1:1000; Cell Signaling
Technologies); b-actin (1:5000; Sigma) was used as the loading
control. Blots were incubated overnight in primary antibody at
4˚C in Tris-buffered saline containing 4% bovine serum albumin
in 0.1% Tween20. Secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG
1:10,000 and goat antimouse IgG; Chemicon) were diluted
and incubated for 45 min at room temperature, ECL (Pico) detection kit (ThermoScientific) was used for signal detection.
Densitometry was performed using Adobe Photoshop software.

Behavioral testing

Coimmunoprecipitation

Infarct analysis

Coimmunoprecipitation (co-ip) was performed using Protein
A-Sepharose beads. Whole-cell lysate (100 mg) from the right
hemisphere of sham (Sh) and stroke (ss) mice was incubated for
1 h with 1 mg of the TAK1 antibody at room temperature to
form the immune complex. Then, 100 mL of a 50% slurry of
Protein A beads in PBS was added to the complex and incubated
for 1 h at room temperature as described in Turtzo et al. (2013).
Beads were spun down, the unbound fraction removed and then
the beads were extensively washed. To elute off the complex,
the beads were incubated in sample buffer and boiled. Western
blotting was performed (as detailed above) to assess the pGSK-3
interaction.

Neurological scores
Neurological deficit scores (Holmes et al. 2008) were obtained during the intraischemic period and at 24 h post-stroke. Our standard
scoring system was as follows: 0, no deficit; 1, forelimb weakness
and torso turning to the ipsilateral side when held by tail; 2, circling to affected side; 3, unable to bear weight on affected side;
and 4, no spontaneous locomotor activity or barrel rolling as described previously (Venna et al. 2012b; White et al. 2012).

Open-field analysis
Mice were acclimatized to the testing room for 1 h prior to the test.
Testing was performed during the light phase of the circadian cycle, between 9:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m. under normal fluorescent
room lights. For testing, mice were individually placed in the
open-field chamber (15′′ × 15′′ ) equipped with 16 infrared beam
emitting LEDs on each side for a duration of 20 min. The total
number of beam breaks was automatically collected by a computer-operated PAS Open-Field system (San Diego Instruments). The
