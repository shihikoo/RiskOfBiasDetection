Abstract Transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4)
is a voltage-dependent, nonselective cation channel. Under
pathological conditions, sustained activation of TRPM4 leads
to oncotic cell death. Here, we report the upregulation of
TRPM4 in vascular endothelium following hypoxia/
ischemia in vitro and in vivo. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, TRPM4 expression was increased at both the
mRNA and protein levels following oxygen–glucose deprivation. Blocking TRPM4 with 9-phenanthrol greatly enhanced
tube formation on Matrigel. In a rat permanent middle cerebral
artery occlusion model, TRPM4 was upregulated in the vascular endothelium within the penumbra region after stroke.
TRPM4 expression peaked 1 day post-occlusion and gradually decreased. In vivo siRNA-mediated TRPM4 silencing
enhanced angiogenesis and improved capillary integrity. A
twofold reduction in infarct volume and a substantial recovery
of motor function were observed in animals receiving the
siRNA treatment. Interestingly, the protective effect of
TRPM4 suppression disappeared 5 days after stroke induction, indicating that TRPM4 upregulation is critical for

Introduction
Transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) is a
voltage-dependent, nonselective cation channel. It is impermeable to Ca2+, activated by elevated cytosolic Ca2+, and
modulated by ATP [29]. TRPM4 belongs to the mammalian
transient receptor potential superfamily. The TRPM4 and
TRPM5 are unique because they only conduct monovalent
cations, whereas most other TRP channels are permeable to
both monovalent and divalent ions. TRPM4 is important for
the function of immune cells, including dendritic, mast, and T
cells [2, 13, 30]. When activated, TRPM4 can depolarize the
membrane potential and regulate Ca2+ homeostasis by decreasing the driving force for Ca2+ entry in non-excitable cells.
Gain-of-function mutations in TRPM4 are associated with
familial heart disease [12, 14]. TRPM4 also participates in
the pathophysiology of spinal cord injury (SCI) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [7, 20]. Ectopic
expression of TRPM4 has been found in capillaries after SCI
and in neurons after EAE. Activation of TRPM4 in SCI and
EAE results in unchecked ion influx and subsequently leads to
oncotic cell death.
Cerebral edema following brain injury is bound to cell
death. Edema resulting from ischemic stroke leads to tissue
damage and worsens neurological functions. Recently,
upregulation of the nonselective cation channel NCCa-ATP
was observed in neurovascular cells, including astrocytes,
neurons, and vascular endothelia, after ischemic stroke [22].
Enhanced NCCa-ATP current can lead to unchecked Na+ entry,

564

subsequently oncotic cell death, and is believed to cause brain
edema [10]. The current exhibits many properties similar to
those of TRPM4, including a smaller single-channel conductance, permeability to Na+ and Cs+, and activation by intracellular Ca2+ [22, 25]. The NCCa-ATP current is also involved
in other central nervous system injuries, including traumatic
brain injury, spinal cord injury, and subarachnoid hemorrhage
[23, 24, 26]. However, studies of NCCa-ATP channel in stroke
have mainly focused on the sulfonylurea receptor-1, an auxiliary subunit of KATP channels [22]. The role of TRPM4 after
ischemic stroke is unclear. Using a rat permanent middle
cerebral artery occlusion model (MCAO), we investigated
the expression and functions of TRPM4 in ischemic stroke.

Materials and methods
Animal model
This study was approved and performed in accordance with
the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Neuroscience Institute, Singapore. As
per the approved protocol, male Wistar rats weighing approximately 300 g were subjected to MCAO. Prior to surgery, the
animals were anesthetized with ketamine (75 mg/kg) and
xylazine (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. Under an operating
microscope, the left common carotid artery was exposed and
temporarily ligated using a vascular clip (Aesculap, B. Braun,
Germany). Next, the left external carotid artery (ECA) and
internal carotid artery (ICA) were dissected from the surrounding tissues. Occipital artery and superior thyroid artery
(branches of ECA) were occluded. The ECA was then ligated
with a 4–0 silk suture. The ICA was also free from the adjacent
vagus nerve. Subsequently, a loose knot was made at the ECA
stump near the bifurcation with a 4–0 silk suture. The extracranial branch of ICA was temporarily ligated with a vascular
clip as well. The distal end of the ECA was cut and a siliconcoated filament (0.37 mm, Cat #403756PK10, Doccol Corp,
Redlands, CA) was introduced into the ICA through the ECA
stump. Subsequently, the suture around the ECA stump was
tightened around the intraluminal filament, and the microvascular clip was removed. The filament was then gently advanced from the ECA to the ICA lumen for approximately
18–20 mm. The ligation on the CCA was released after the
suture on the ECA-intraluminal filament was tightened. The
sham-operated rats underwent similar procedures, except for
the insertion of the suture.

component of the TTC solution, to form a formazan pigment.
After the animals were euthanized, the brains were collected,
and the cerebellum and overlying membranes were removed.
The brain was sectioned into 2-mm-thick coronal slices using
a brain-sectioning block. The sections were stained with 0.1 %
TTC (Sigma, USA) solution at 37 °C for 30 min and then
preserved in 4 % formalin solution. The sections were scanned
and the infarct size was analyzed using an image analyzer
system (Scion image from Windows, Microsoft).
Immunofluorescent staining
The animals were euthanized and perfused with saline followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were then
collected and post-fixed with 4 % PFA for 2 h. Dehydration
was subsequently carried out by immersing the brain in a 15 %
sucrose solution, followed by 30 % sucrose solution. Next, the
rat brain was cryosectioned at 20 μm of thickness. After
washing with 0.2 % Triton X-100 phosphate buffered saline
(PBST), 100 μl of the blocking serum (10 % goat serum and
1 % bovine serum albumin in 0.2 % PBST) was added to the
sections for 1 h. The brain sections were then incubated with
primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies
used in the study are anti-TRPM4 (sc-27540, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA), anti-NeuN (MAB377, Millipore), anti-GFAP (IF03L,
Calbiochem, Millipore), anti-smooth muscle actin (CBL171,
Millipore), and anti-von Willebrand factor (vWF) (AB7356,
Millipore, MA, USA). On the following day, the tissue sections were washed three times with TNT wash buffer (0.1 M
Tris–HCl buffer pH 7.5 containing 0.15 M NaCl and 0.05 %
Tween 20). The slides were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times
of wash buffer, the slides were mounted with FluorSaveTM
reagent (Merck, Germany). The results were visualized by a
laser scanning confocal microscope (Fluoview BX61, Olympus). The negative control underwent an identical procedure
with the exception of the primary antibody incubation; no
positive signal was observed.
Capillary counting
Capillary counting was conducted stereologically. Every fifth
100-μm brain section across the entire region of infarction
was counted. For random sampling, six fields per brain section
were randomly chosen under a confocal microscope under
×40 magnification. The number of blood vessels was measured by counting the number of elongated tube-like structures with positive vWF immunoreactivity.

Tissues from the penumbra region and the contralateral control sites were collected from the TTC-stained brain slices as

described earlier [32]. The brain tissues were homogenized in
300 μl of HEPES lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, 137 mM
NaCl, 1 % Triton X-100, 10 % glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
1 mM EGTA) with freshly added protease inhibitors (1:50
dilution, Roche Diagnostics). The homogenized samples were
then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatants were collected. Protein concentration was determined
using the Bradford assay. For Western blot analysis, 200 μg
of lysate (with 2× protein loading dye) was separated on an
8 % SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was then transferred overnight at
30 V onto a PVDF membrane at 4 °C. Subsequently, the
membrane was blocked with 1 % BSA in 1× PBS+0.1 %
Tween 20 for 1 h and probed with an anti-TRPM4 goat
polyclonal antibody (1:2,000 dilution, SC27540, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the membrane was washed hree times with 0.1 % Tween 20 in 1× PBS
for 10 min. The membrane was then probed with a goat
secondary antibody conjugated to HRP (1:5,000 dilution,
A5420, Sigma Aldrich) for 1 h. After washing, the TRPM4
band was detected using the Amersham ECL Western Blotting
Analysis System (RPN2109, GE Healthcare).
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells culture and hypoxia
induction
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Lonza,
Wokingham, UK) were cultured at 37 °C with 5 % CO2. The
culture medium is endothelial growth medium-2 (EGM-2)
consisting of endothelial basal medium (EBM), supplemented
with 2 % fetal bovine serum, hydrocortisone, hFGF, VEGF,
R3-IGF-1, ascorbic acid, HEGF, GA-1000, and heparin
(Lonza, Wokingham, UK). Cells at passage 6–10 were used
for experiments. HUVECs were subjected to oxygen/glucose
deprivation (OGD). To achieve supplement deprivation,
EGM-2 was changed to EBM without fetal bovine serum or
growth supplements. Hypoxia was induced by culturing the
cells in a hypoxic chamber (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) with 1 % O2 and 5 % CO2 at 37 °C for 24 h.
Trypan blue exclusion and MTT assay
Cell viability was determined using the Trypan blue exclusion
method. The cells were trypsinized and incubated with Trypan
blue. The number of cells was quantified by light microscopy
using a hemocytometer chamber and is expressed as the
percentage of viable cells. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay
(Roche, Switzerland) was performed to assess cell viability.
Cell viability was quantified by the amount of MTT reduction.
The cells were incubated with anhydrous MTT for 4 h, and the
product was solubilized in a DMSO solution. The optical
density was measured at 540 nm. The data is expressed as
the percentage of viable cells.

Tube formation
HUVECs were divided into the following groups: normoxia,
normoxia+5 μM 9-phenanthrol (Sigma), hypoxia, and hypoxia+5 μM 9-phenanthrol. A 24-well culture plate was
precoated with 250 μl of growth factor-reduced Matrigel
(Sigma, USA) at 37 °C for 30 min. Twenty-four hours after
OGD, 4×104 cells (in 300 μl of EGM-2) from each group
were seeded onto the Matrigel-coated plates. The formation of
capillary structures was examined under a light microscope
after 4 h. This study was replicated more than four times.
Reverse transcriptase PCR
Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies Corporation, USA) according
to the manufacturer's protocol. Superscript III (Invitrogen,
Life Technologies Corporation, USA) was used to generate
first strand cDNA. The PCR was performed as follows: a
denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for
30 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; and a final extension
step at 72 °C for 10 min. GAPDH was used as the endogenous
control. The primers used for TRPM4 were as follows: 5′CTGGTTCTCGCCTTCTTTTG-3′ (forward) and 5′CATGAAGTCGATGCAGAGGA-3′ (reverse); and GAPDH:
5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACG-3′ (forward) and
5′-TGCCATGGGTGGAATCATATTGG-3′ (reverse).
Patch clamp measurements
Whole-cell currents were recorded under voltage clamp with
Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices Corp. Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Data were digitized at 10 kHz and filtered at
1 kHz. The pClamp 10.2 software was used for data acquisition and analysis. The internal pipette solution contained (in
millimole/liter): CsCl 140, NaCl 5, MgCl2 1, BAPTA 1,
CaCl2 0.83, and pH 7.2 adjusted with CsOH. The bath solution contained (in millimole/liter): NaCl 140, CsCl 5, CaCl2 2,
MgCl2 1, glucose 10, HEPES 10, and pH 7.4 adjusted with
NaOH.
In vivo siRNA delivery
TRPM4 in vivo Ready siRNA was purchased from Ambion,
Life Technologies Corporation, USA. The sequences were as
follows: sense 5′-CGCUAGUAGCAGCAAAUCUtt-3′ and
antisense 5′-AGAUUUGCUGCUACUAGCGtg-3′. Immediately after operation, the rats received a loading dose of
19 nmol siRNA intravenously. Subsequently, 6 nmol siRNA
was given via the jugular vein through an implanted miniosmotic pump (Alzet, Durect Corporation). The infusion rate
was 7.8 μl/h for 24 h.

566

Behavioral analysis
Motor function after MCAO was evaluated using a rotarod
apparatus (Ugo Basile, Italy). The performance of the rats was
measured by observing the latency with which the rats fell off
the rotarod. Three days before the surgery, the rats received
three training trials each day with 15-min intervals. The accelerating rotarod was set from 4 to 80 rpm within 10 min. The
mean duration of time that the animals remained on the device
was recorded 1 day before MCAO as an internal baseline
control. At different time points following surgery, the mean
duration of latency was recorded and compared to the internal
baseline control.
Statistics
All of the results are presented as the mean ± S.E.M.
Data were graphed using Prism, version 4 (GraphPad
Software, CA). Student's t test was used to compare
two sample means and one-way ANOVA followed by
Dunnett's post hoc tests was used to compare the means
of data from three or more groups. The results were
considered significant if P <0.05.

Results
Upregulation of TRPM4 in the vascular endothelium
after MCAO
To investigate the role of TRPM4 in ischemic stroke, we
permanently occluded the middle cerebral artery in rats. The
infarction was located in ipsilateral cortex and striatum (left
hemisphere in this study). DAB staining of the capillaries with
the endothelial marker vWF in the contralateral and ipsilateral
regions indicated prominent angiogenesis in the penumbra
region 1 day post-stroke (Fig. 1a). Endothelial vWF staining
was stronger in the penumbra region than in the contralateral
brain tissues possibly due to endothelial activation and/or
dysfunction after stroke [5]. Using a TRPM4-specific antibody, we detected strong staining of TRPM4 in the penumbra
region that was co-labeled with vWF 1 day post-MCAO
(Fig. 1b). TRPM4 was almost undetectable in the vascular
endothelium in the uninjured contralateral hemisphere
(Fig. 1b) and sham-operated brain (Supplementary Fig. 1a).
Another TRPM channel, TRPM5, which is structurally similar to TRPM4, was not expressed in the endothelium (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
Western blot analysis revealed a twofold upregulation of
TRPM4 in the penumbra region (Fig. 4a) as compared to the
contralateral region. The rat TRPM4 is approximately
135 kDa, suggesting that this protein represents the longer
TRPM4b isoform [17]. The same antibody was able to detect

Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol (2014) 466:563–576

the mouse TRPM4 protein which was expressed in HEK
cells as a positive control, confirming the specificity of
the antibody for TRPM4. We consistently observed that
the size of rat TRPM4 was slightly smaller than the
mouse TRPM4.
We further studied the expression of TRPM4 in the vascular endothelium within the penumbra at the following time
points post-MCAO: 0 h, 6 h, 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days (Fig. 2).
Strong TRPM4 staining was observed in the endothelium as
early as 6 h. The expression levels remained prominent at
1 day post-operation. The almost complete colocalization of
TRPM4 with vWF indicated that the majority of the endothelial cells within the penumbra region expressed high levels of
TRPM4 following stroke. However, by day 3, TRPM4 expression began to decrease gradually. Many vWF-positive
cells did not express TRPM4. Furthermore, we observed
vascular fragmentation within penumbra region after stroke
induction, a typical sign of the loss of vascular integrity. This
fragmentation was prominent by day 3 and correlated with the
reduced expression of TRPM4. Thus, we postulate that
TRPM4 upregulation in the vascular endothelium may contribute to capillary death post-stroke.

In vitro blockade of TRPM4 in human umbilical vein
endothelial cells induces tube formation
We tested this hypothesis in HUVECs under OGD. The cells
were exposed to hypoxic conditions and starved of glucose
and serum/growth factors. After 24 h of OGD, significant cell
death occurred. A twofold increase of TRPM4 mRNA by RTPCR (Fig. 3a) and a 1.7-fold increase of TRPM4 protein by
Western blot (Fig. 3b) were observed after OGD treatment.
Such increase was further confirmed by immunofluorescence
staining (Fig. 3c).
To test the functional impact of TRPM4 on HUVECs, we
incubated the cells with the TRPM4-specific blocker 9phenanthrol. This blocker does not affect the TRPM5 channel
[8], another TRPM channel with similar electrophysiological
properties to TRPM4 [16, 29]. A study was performed in
which 9-phenantrol with the concentration ranged from 0.1
to 30 μM was added to HUVECs. No difference was observed
in cell death between 0.1 and 5 μM. Cell death became
prominent when 10 μM 9-phenanthrol was added to the
culture medium. Very few cells survived treatment with
30 μM 9-phenanthrol (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Thus, 5 μM
9-phenanthrol was used to treat HUVECs. Unexpectedly, 9phenanthrol treatment did not reduce cell death after OGD
(Supplementary Fig. 2b, c). However, we observed a large
enhancement of tube formation on Matrigel by 9-phenanthrol
treatment after OGD (Fig. 3d). This in vitro study proves that
blocking TRPM4 improves endothelial functions under
hypoxic conditions.

TRPM4 currents are increased in HUVEC cells after hypoxia
To evaluate the functions of upregulation of TRPM4 in cultured
HUVEC cells after hypoxia, we used whole-cell patch clamp
method to measure the TRPM4 currents. A typical ramp protocol
was applied to the cells under normoxia or hypoxia treatment for
1 day. An increased outward rectifying current sensitive to 9phenanthrol (Fig. 3e) was recorded from the cells after hypoxia
treatment (Fig. 3f) correlating with the increased expression of
TRPM4 channels. Although the current density was higher in

hypoxic cells, no significance was observed when compared to
the control cells (Fig. 3g), P =0.33.
In vivo TRPM4 knockdown enhances angiogenesis
and reduces infarction after MCAO
To demonstrate that TRPM4 is critical for vascular endothelial
functions in vivo, we used an siRNA against rat TRPM4 in our
animal model of MCAO. A total of 25 nmol of siRNA was
delivered into rats with a body weight of 300 g. A single dose of

19 nmol was injected intravenously post-operation and the
remaining 6 nmol was delivered into the jugular vein with an
osmotic pump for 24 h. Intravenous delivery reduces the loss of
siRNA during absorption via other routes and maximizes contact
with the endothelium.
Western blot analysis revealed that in the saline-treated
animals there was an upregulation of TRPM4 in the ipsilateral

region and very low expression of TRPM4 in the contralateral
region. Knockdown of TRPM4 via siRNA successfully
prevented the upregulation of TRPM4 in the ipsilateral hemisphere 1 day post-MCAO (Fig. 4a). TRPM4 protein levels
were reduced to a level similar to that in the contralateral
region. De novo expression of TRPM4 was previously shown
to contribute to the damage of capillary integrity following

SCI [7]. We studied the capillary structure in the rat brains
3 days post-MCAO. In the saline-treated animals, the capillaries were generally short, and fragmentation was present in
almost all capillaries (Fig. 4b). The capillaries within the
penumbra region of the siRNA-treated animals were elongated without segmentation, indicating greater structural integrity. In addition, the number of capillaries in the penumbra

hemisphere according to TTC staining (Fig. 4c). Both the cortex
and striatum were affected. By contrast, siRNA treatment greatly
reduced infarction. The cortex was preserved almost completely,
while a smaller infarction occurred mainly in the striatum. The
infarction volume was greatly reduced from 24±3.2 to 8.8±1 %
(P =0.0017, Student's t test) (Fig. 4c).

infarct volumes were smaller than those in the saline-treated
animals, there was no difference between the two groups
(Fig. 6b). Thus, we believe that the protective effect of
TRPM4 knockdown is transient and occurs during the acute
phase of stroke. These results support that brain tissue loss
correlates with functional changes after MCAO.

In vivo TRPM4 knockdown improves motor function
after MCAO

Extended siRNA treatment does not improve motor functions

We used the rotarod test to evaluate the motor function of the
rats receiving siRNA treatment. The sham-operated animals
performed well on the test (Fig. 5a). The performance of
MCAO rats (n =8) receiving saline treatment decreased to
28±4 % 1 day post-operation and gradually improved in
subsequent days. The performance of the 21 siRNA-treated
MCAO rats greatly improved to 57±3.7 % 1 day postMCAO, which is significantly higher than the saline group
but lower than the sham-operated group (P <0.0001, one-way
ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post hoc analysis). The effects
of siRNA were most prominent 3 days post-MCAO. There
was no difference between the siRNA-treated animals and
sham-operated animals (Fig. 5b). The protective effect lasted
until day 5 post-operation. By day 7, the motor function deficit
in the siRNA-treated animals decreased to levels that were
similar to those in the saline-treated animals (Fig. 5a).
Transient protective effect of TRPM4 knockdown
The results from the rotarod test suggest that TRPM4 knockdown does not maintain functional improvement after the
acute phase of stroke. To study the effects of TRPM4 knockdown on tissue loss after the acute phase, we performed TTC
staining to measure the infarction volume at different time
points (Fig. 6a). In the saline-treated rats, the infarct volume
decreased gradually by day 7, indicating that the process of
reabsorption was occurring. By contrast, the protective effects
of siRNA treatment disappeared by day 5. Although the mean

To examine the effects of extended siRNA treatment, we gave
a second dose of siRNA to MCAO rats intravenously on day 4
after operation. Day 4 was chosen for the boosting dose
because the motor functions were well preserved on days 3
and 5 in rats receiving single-dose siRNA. Motor functions of
the rats with the double-doses siRNA treatment were similar
from day 5 until day 21 except for day 7 to those with singledose treatment (Fig. 7a). However, the improved motor functions observed at day 7 by the boosting siRNA were not
different from those with single-dose siRNA (Fig. 7b).

Discussion
The ectopic expression and activation of TRPM4 is generally
harmful to cells. Under pathological conditions, an increase in
intracellular Ca2+ concentrations and the depletion of ATP
leads to TRPM4 activation [29], resulting in oncotic cell death
due to unchecked Na+ influx [7]. The cessation of the blood
supply to part of the brain after ischemic stroke can increase
intracellular Ca2+ levels and lower ATP concentrations within
the affected area [19]; both events can enhance TRPM4
activities.
An increase in TRPM4 current has been observed in
cardiomyocytes from spontaneous hypertensive rats [9]. In
the central nervous system, de novo expression of TRPM4
has also been identified in the capillaries following SCI [7].
We observed a similar upregulation of TRPM4 protein in the
capillary endothelia after stroke. In cultured HUVECs,

formation, a sign of angiogenesis after hypoxia. Thus, the
upregulation of TRPM4 is harmful to endothelial cells, and
TRPM4 inhibition can protect HUVECs from hypoxic insult.
This is supported by another study indicating that blocking
TRPM4 can prevent HUVECs from lipopolysaccharideinduced cell death [3].
In SCI, de novo expression of TRPM4 in the endothelium
caused capillary fragmentation, and deletion of TRPM4 greatly enhanced recovery by promoting angiogenesis [7]. The loss
of vascular integrity was also apparent within the penumbra
region in our MCAO model. The disrupted vascular structure

TRPM4 was expressed at basal levels under normoxic conditions, similar to a previous report [3]. In this study, TRPM4
expression is low in the healthy rat brain. The culture conditions may have caused the increased TRPM4 expression in
HUVECs. OGD treatment increased TRPM4 expression at
both the transcriptional and translational levels. As a result,
increased TRPM4 currents were observed in HUVECs after
1 day OGD. Interestingly, there was no significance for the
current density. This is possibly due to an enlarged cell volume caused by hypoxia-induced cellular edema. Blocking

was likely partially caused by the upregulation of TRPM4 that
leads to oncotic cell death. TRPM4 knockdown via siRNA
greatly promoted angiogenesis and improved the motor functions of the rats. This indicates that the upregulation of
TRPM4 in the endothelium following stroke plays a similar
pathological role as in traumatic SCI. The increased expression of TRPM4 in the capillaries after SCI led to secondary
hemorrhage. It is possible that the upregulation of TRPM4 is a
cause of hemorrhage transformation observed in many patients with ischemic stroke.
In the MCAO model, the animals that were treated with the
siRNA displayed not only intact capillaries but also an increased number of capillaries compared to the saline-treated
rats. However, blocking TRPM4 in HUVECs only improved
tube formation without increasing the cell number. This could

be due to the differences in the levels of growth factors in the
two studies. In the animal model, VEGF and other growth
factors generated after the onset of stroke could promote
capillary proliferation, whereas in HUVECs under OGD, we
completely removed the serum and growth factors. Thus, no
cell proliferation was observed.
The ectopic expression of TRPM4 within the axonal processes contributes to the tissue damage induced by EAE [20].
TRPM4 was also found in cerebral vascular smooth muscle
cells. Blocking TRPM4 with antisense oligonucleotides greatly reduced arterial constriction [6, 18]. However, TRPM4
knockout mice are hypertensive due to elevated circulating
catecholamines, which is independent of the TRPM4 deletion
in endothelial and smooth muscle cells [15]. The reasons for
the difference are unknown. Our initial staining result did not

The expression of TRPM4 was transient after ischemic
stroke. It peaked within 1 day and then gradually decreased.
As angiogenesis occurs soon after the onset of stroke, TRPM4
is likely to affect the regeneration of capillaries. In fact,
TRPM4 knockdown immediately after MCAO preserved vascular integrity, enhanced angiogenesis, and as a result, reduced infarction, and promoted functional recovery. However,
the effect of siRNA treatment was transient. By day 5, the
rotarod performances of the animals were similar to those of
the saline-treated rats. When the rats received a boosting
siRNA on day 4 post-MCAO, motor functions were only
slightly improved on day 7 but with no statistical difference.
These results suggest that TRPM4 upregulation only participates in endothelial damage during the acute phase of stroke.
This is supported by the observation that by day 7, many
vascular endothelial cells did not express TRPM4 channels.
The mechanism for this unique expression pattern is not
known. Acute stroke reperfusion treatments are currently restricted by the very narrow time window (<4.5 h for intravenous thrombolysis), limiting this treatment to only a minority
of patients. This is due to the progression of the ischemic
penumbra to infarction over the first few hours following
cerebral arterial occlusion [1]. According to our animal study,
blocking TRPM4 during the acute phase protects the brain
tissue for as long as 5 days. Thus, blocking TRPM4 could
potentially extend the therapeutic time window of acute reperfusion treatments.
The role that TRPM4 plays in the immune response after
stroke is unknown. Functional TRPM4 is required for dendritic cell (DC) migration and the release of cytokines in mast
and T cells [2, 13, 30]. Although these cells are not present or
activated in the healthy brain, they can be recruited into the
infarct and activated to participate in the immune response due
to the disruption of blood–brain barrier (BBB) after stroke [11,
28, 31]. Enhanced endothelial TRPM4 expression may contribute to the BBB disruption and facilitate the migration of
immune cells to the damaged brain tissues. TRPM4 may have
opposite effects in these cells. DCs invading the brain after
stroke activate T cells, inducing a long-lasting immune response [11]. Blocking TRPM4 could reduce DC migration
and ameliorate neurological deficits. By contrast, the release
of cytokines from mast cells contributes to cell death after
stroke. TRPM4 blockade can induce mast cell degranulation
[30] and potentially increases BBB disruption and edema
[27]. However, TRPM4 expression is also critical for mast
cell migration [21]. TRPM4 inhibition may reduce mast cell
recruitment and cytokine-induced tissue damage. In T cells,
blocking TRPM4 increases IL-2 production [13]. Inhibiting
TRPM4 after stroke can enhance cytokine production in T
lymphocytes. Suppressing the immune response often ameliorates acute ischemic damage [4]. Thus, blocking TRPM4 in
T cells may enhance IL-2 secretion and lead to further tissue
damage. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no

575

reports studying the expression and functions of TRPM4 in
immune cells after ischemic stroke. The functional role of
TRPM4 warrants further investigation.
In summary, the transient expression of TRPM4 during the
acute phase following ischemic stroke is critical for capillary
integrity. Blocking TRPM4 can protect brain tissue by promoting angiogenesis and could be a potential drug target for
stroke therapy.
