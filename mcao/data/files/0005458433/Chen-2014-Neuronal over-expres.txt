Angiotensin (Ang) II exaggerates cerebral injury in ischemic damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme
type 2 (ACE2) converts Ang II into Ang (1-7) and thus, may protect against the effects of Ang II. We
hypothesized that neuronal ACE2 over-expression decreases ischemic stroke in mice with Ang II overproduction.
Human renin and angiotensinogen double transgenic (RA) mice and RA mice with neuronal
over-expression of ACE2 (SARA) were used for the study. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated
from telemetry-recorded blood pressure (BP). SARA mice were infused peripherally with Norepinephrine
to “clamp”the BP, or intracerebroventricularly-infused with a Mas receptor antagonist (A-779).
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery was performed to induce permanent focal ischemic
stroke. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and neurological function were determined. Two days after surgery,
brain samples were collected for various analyses. Results showed: 1) When compared to chronically
hypertensive RA mice, SARA mice had lower basal MAP, less MCAO-induced infarct volume, and
increased CBF, neurological function and cerebral microvascular density in the peri-infarct area; 2) These
changes in SARA mice were not altered after MAP “clamping”, but partially reversed by brain infusion of
A-779; 3) Ang (1-7)/Ang II ratio, angiogenic factors, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression
and nitric oxide production were increased, whereas, NADPH oxidase subunits and reactive oxygen
species were decreased in the brain of SARA mice. ACE2 protects brain from ischemic injury via the
regulation of NADPH oxidase/eNOS pathways by changing Ang (1-7)/Ang II ratio, independently of MAP
changes.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke, the third leading cause of death in the United
States, is known as a severe complication of hypertension and
arteriosclerosis. There are limited avenues for preventing and
treating ischemic stroke. Contribution of the Angiotensin converting
enzyme (ACE)/angiotensin (Ang) II/AT1 receptor (AT1R)
pathway, the main axis of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), is
well accepted in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke (Chrysant,
2005; Saavedra et al., 2006). Overproduction of Ang II induces
enlarged brain ischemic injury (Chen et al., 2009). ACE inhibitors
and AT1R blockers have been shown to protect the brain from
ischemic injury in both animal studies (Nishimura et al., 2000;
Iwanami et al., 2010) and clinical trials (Dahlöf et al., 2002;
Kjeldsen et al., 2005). The protective effect may relate to blood
pressure (BP) control and improvement of cerebral blood supply
(Nishimura et al., 2000; Iwanami et al., 2010). However, there is
limited information regarding BP-independent effects of Ang II on
ischemic stroke. On the other hand, a new arm of the RAS, ACE2/
Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor (MasR), has been shown to counteract the
effects of ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis (Guo et al., 2008). ACE2 cleaves Ang
II into the vasodilatory peptide Ang (1-7), which in turn, binds the
MasR to exert opposite properties to Ang II (Guo et al., 2008). An
earlier study showed that central administration of Ang (1-7)
stimulates nitric oxide (NO) release and upregulates endothelial
nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression in ischemic tissues
following focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in rats (Zhang et al.,

2008). Another report further demonstrated that the beneficial
effects of central administration of Ang (1-7) or pharmacological
activation of ACE2 in endothelin-1-induced ischemic stroke, which
can be reversed by A-779, a Mas receptor antagonist (Mecca et al.,
2011). Recent evidence demonstrates that ACE2 has vascular protective
effects by counteracting the deleterious actions of Ang II on
BP regulation and vascular function (Silva et al., 2005; Chen et al.,
2011). Therefore, ACE2 holds a great potential for developing new
avenues to treat vascular diseases. However, whether the ACE2/Ang
(1-7)/MasR axis exhibits protective effects on ischemic stroke by
counteracting the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis and what are the underlying
mechanisms remains to be determined.
The diverse actions of ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis on vascular and
cerebral damage are mediated by coupling to NADPH oxidase (Nox)
which generates reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nox-derived ROS
play a key role in Ang II-induced endothelial damage (Doughan
et al., 2008), neuronal apoptosis and cerebral inflammation
(Yamamoto et al., 2008). Moreover, Ang II-induced endothelial
dysfunction is associated with the reduction of NO bioavailability
and decreased NO production, which also plays an important role
in cerebrovascular disease (Sierra et al., 2011). Recent evidence
show that ACE2 has an anti-atherosclerotic effect by downregulating
Ang II-mediated ROS production (Doughan et al.,
2008). Although there is much evidence for Nox/ROS and eNOS/
NO as downstream pathways of the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis, there is
still a paucity of information regarding how these pathways are
modulated by the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/MasR arm in ischemic stroke.
We previously showed enlarged ischemic injury in the human
renin and angiotensinogen double transgenic (RA) mice (Chen
et al., 2009). In this study, we examined the counteracting effect
of ACE2/Ang (1-7)/MasR axis to ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis on ischemic
stroke by over-expressing ACE2 in the neurons of RA mice. The BP
independent and downstream (Nox/ROS, eNOS/NO and cytokines)
mechanisms were investigated.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental animals
RA mice were produced using colonies maintained in our laboratory and genotyped
as previously described (Iida et al., 2005). RA mice were bred with synhACE2
transgenic mice with neuron-specific ACE2 over-expression to generate a
triple transgenic model (SARA) (Xia et al., 2009). Male SARA and RA mice aged 6e10
weeks were used for all experiments in this study. Mice were fed with standard
chow and water ad libitum. All experimental procedures were approved by the
Wright State University Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee and were in
accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals issued by the
National Institutes of Health.
2.2. Experimental protocols for experiment 1
The brain and blood samples from healthy RA and SARA mice were obtained
(Fig.1). The blood samples were used for measuring the level of Ang II and Ang (1-7)
(2.3.). Brain tissues were used for immunohistochemical staining of ROS/NO production
(2.5.), and for isolating total protein or blood vessels and brain parenchyma
fractions for ELISA (2.4. and 2.6.) and western blot analyses (2.7.).
2.3. Measurements of plasma concentration of Ang II and Ang (1-7)
The blood samples were taken from the left ventricle of heart the blood samples
were taken from the left ventricle of heart in a chilled blood collection tubes with a
cocktail of protease inhibitors (25 mmol/L EDTA, 0.44 mmol/L o-phenylenediamine,
and 0.12 mmol/L pepstatin A) as previously reported (Iyer et al., 1998). After immediate
centrifuge, plasma samples were quickly transferred into a pre-cooled tube,
and put into the dry ice container, then stored in80C. The levels of Ang II and Ang
(1-7) in the plasma were determined by commercial ELISA kits (Enzo Life Sciences,
Farmingdale, NY) within 3 days. The 96-well plates were placed on a microplate
reader (Packard; Meriden, CT) to measure absorbance at 450 nm.
2.4. Measurements of brain concentration of angiogenic cytokines
After collection of blood, the brain tissues were immediately dissected and the
protein was extracted in lysis buffer. After centrifuge at 10,000 for 10 min, the
protein was transferred to a new tube on dry ice and stored in80 C. The levels of
angiogenic cytokines in the total brain protein was determined by angiogenesis
ELISA assay kit (Signosis, Sunnyvale, CA). The cytokines included in this kit are
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF),
interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon gamma (IFN-g), tumor necrosis factora (TNF-a),
Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-b), and
Leptin.
2.5. Measurement of ROS production and NO generation
After collection of blood from heart, the brains collected from RA and SARA mice
were immediately frozen in Tissue-Tek OCT embedding medium, cryostat-sectioned
(20 mm) directly onto chilled microscope slides, and dried without fixation. The
sections were sequentially put into six separate wells of a 6-well plate containing
2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For ROS measurement, brain sections were
reacted with dihydroethidium (DHE, 2 mmol/L) in dark for 10 min at room temperature
(RT) (Yamamoto et al., 2008). For NO determination, brain slices were

incubated for 1 h at 37C in DMEM (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) containing 10mMdye
4-amino-5-methylamino-20,70-difluorofluorescein diacetate (DAF-FM Diacetate)
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (Kojima et al., 2001). After incubation, sections were
washed twice for 3 min with phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Following thefinal wash,
sections were coversliped and imaged using a fluorescence microscope (Leica TCS
SP2). Fluorescence extent of random chosen microscopyfields located in cortex and
stratum areas was quantified using Image J. Totallyfive random microscopyfields in
each and slice and six slices of each brain were averaged to present the data of each
mouse. The data were expressed as percentile offluorescence level in the sections of
RA mice.
2.6. Isolation of cerebral vessel and brain parenchyma
In the other set of experiment, the cerebral blood vessel and brain parenchyma
were separately isolated from the brains of RA and SARA mice according to previous
methods (Williams et al., 1988; Williams and Chung, 2006). Briefly, The brains were
removed free of meninges, dissected into small pieces and homogenized in 0.4 M
sucrose solution containing 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.4 mM MES buffer, 0.1 mM ATP, 1% BSA,
and 20,000 IU sodium heparin at 4 C. The protease inhibitors (0.5 mg/ml aprotinin,
0.5 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 mg/ml pepstatin) and 0.1 mM EDTA were added. The
homogenate was subsequently passed through nylon mesh sieve (125 mm). After
centrifuging at 200gfor 5 min, the pellet was resuspended in 18% Detran solution
and centrifuged at 10,000gfor 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in Ca2þeMg2þ
free Hank balance salt solution (HBSS) and pass through nylon meshfilters (75mm).
The microvasculature retained on the filter was obtained by rinsing the filter with
HBSS. The resulting blood vessel and brain parenchyma fractions were used for
determining brain Ang II/Ang (1-7) level by ELISA kit (see 2.3.) and gene expression
by western blot analyses (see below).
2.7. Western blot analysis
Proteins from blood vessel and vessel-depleted brain parenchyma fractions
were isolated with lysis buffer (Roche Diagnostic, San Francisco, CA). The proteins
(50 mg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes. The primary antibodies used were eNOS (1:1000, Abcam,
Cambridge, MA), Nox2 (1:1000, Abcam) and Nox4 (1:250, Abcam). The second
antibody used was horseradish peroxidase conjugated IgG (1:40000, Jackson Lab).
b-actin (1:4000, Sigma, MO) was used to normalize protein loading.
2.8. Experimental design for experiment 2
The time flow is shown in Fig. 1. All animals were implanted with telemetric
probes for BP recording. Meanwhile, animals were randomly divided into three
groups: vehicle, “clamping” and A-779. The mice in both vehicle and “clamping”
groups were infused with artificial cerebrospinalfluid (aCSF), the mice in “clamping”
group were infused with norepinephrine (NE) via an osmotic minipump, and the
mice in A-779 group were infused with A-779 by intracerebroventricular (icv) and
‘mock’clamped by infused with saline via a minipump. Seven days aftericvinfusion,
mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery for
inducing permanent focal ischemic stroke. The neurological deficit scores (NDS)
were evaluated 24 h after MCAO surgery. Two days after MCAO, mice were euthanized
and the brain samples were collected for infarct volume and cerebral microvascular
density (cMVD) analyses.
2.9. BP recording and “clamping”
A radiotelemetry system (TA11PA-C10, Data Science International) was used for
recording arterial pressure as we described previously (Chen et al., 2009, 2006). The
telemetric probe was implanted in the left carotid artery. BP was continuously
recorded for 24 h before and after MCAO to calculate the mean arterial pressure
(MAP). We recorded the BP for 10 min (sample rate 500 hz) once a hour for 24 h. The
BP was started to record at the same time for each mouse. To exclude the benefits of
the ACE2 BP-lowering effect on ischemic stroke, NE (5.6 mg/kg/day, minipump) was
used to “clamp” the BP of the SARA mice to a similar level as the RA group (Cassis
et al., 2009).
2.10. Intracerebroventricular infusion
Mice were instrumented with a mouse brain infusion kit (ALZET, infusion rate,
0.25ml/h) for chronicicvinfusion of aCSF or the MasR antagonist (A-779, 200 ng/kg/
min, Bachem) for 7 days. The dose for A-779 was chosen based on a previous study
(Xiao et al., 2011). The flow moderator of the minipump was connected with a
polyethylene catheter to a metal cannula (30-gauge) to allow for long-term icv
infusion. The minipump was placed in a sterile isotonic saline solution overnight at
37 C to initiate their operation at a constant pumping rate and to minimize the
possibility of clot formation in the catheter. Implantation of infusion kit was performed
in a stereotaxic apparatus. The skull was exposed by a midline sagittal
incision through the scalp and a subcutaneous pocket was prepared at the back of
the mouse. The minipump was placed into the pocket, and the metal cannula was
inserted through the skull into the brain (1.0 mm lateral and caudal 0.6 mm to the
bregma, 3 mm in depth) to reach the ventricle.
2.11. MCAO surgery
Mice were subjected to MCAO by an intraluminal filament according to our
previous reports (Chen et al., 2009, 2011). Briefly, mice were anaesthetized with 2.5%
isoflurane inhalation, and body temperature was maintained in the range of
37.0  0.5 C with a heating pad throughout the procedure. The right common carotid
artery, external carotid artery (ECA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) were
isolated through a ventral midline incision. A 2.0-cm-length of monofilament nylon
suture (size, 7e0), with its tip rounded by heating near a flame, was inserted from
the right ECA into the lumen of ICA, then advanced until resistance was felt (0.8e
1.0 cm from the bifurcation). The filament remained there until the mice were
sacrificed. Pain and discomfort were minimized by an initial injection of Buprenorphine
(0.1 mg/kg, sc) and Carperofen (5 mg/kg, sc) followed with another Carperofen
injection every 24 h.
2.12. Cerebral blood flow measurement
The relative CBF in the peri-infarct area was determined immediately before and
after MCAO surgery (Girouard et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2013). Briefly, mouse was
anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane and placed on a stereotaxic apparatus. Before
MCAO surgery, the volumes of CBF at the site (core: 2 mm posterior, 6 mm lateral to
bregma; peri-infarct: 2 mm posterior and 3 mm lateral to bregma) representing the
blood flow supplied by the MCA were sequentially determined for 5 min using a
laser Doppler flowmeter (PF2B, Perimed, Sweden) for measuring the basal CBF.
Immediately after MCAO surgery, the CBF was recorded at the same site (peri-infarct
area) for another 5 min. The averaged volume over 5 min was used to represent CBF
for each site. The relative CBF was calculated using the formula: relative CBF¼ CBF
after MCAO/basal CBF 100%. The person who performed CBF measurements was
unaware of the information of animal grouping.
2.13. Functional evaluation of neurological deficits
The NDS were evaluated 24 h after MCAO surgery by using the 5-point scale
method as previously described (Chen et al., 2013). The five points are: 0, normal
motor function; 1,flexion of contralateral torso and forelimb upon lifting the whole
animal by the tail; 2, circling to the contralateral side but normal posture at rest; 3,
leaning to the contralateral side at rest; 4, no spontaneous motor activity. The
neurologic behavior of mice was scored by an investigator who was unaware of
animal grouping.
2.14. Measurement of infarct volume
Mice were sacrificed 2 days after MCAO surgery. The brains were immediately
collected andfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight and in 4% PFA plus 30%
sucrose for 3 days. The brains were then stored at80 C. For measurement, each

frozen brain was cryostat-sectioned into coronal sections (20 mm) and sequentially
put into a 6-well plate containing 2 ml/well of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
Totally four representative slices (from rostral to caudal) with similar locations in
each brain were selected to stain with Fluoro-Jade (Histo-chem, Jefferson, AR) to
reveal the infarct area. To compensate for brain edema, the percentage of the infarct
area to the total brain slice area was calculated by using Image J software (NIH) as we
previously described (Chen et al., 2013, 2011). In all experiments involving image
analysis, the individual(s) taking the photomicrographs and conducting the analysis
was blinded to the treatment grouping.
2.15. Measurement of cerebral microvascular density
The measurement of cMVDs in the contralateral and the ipsilateral (peri-infarct
area) were achieved by immunofluorescence staining (Chen et al., 2013, 2011).
Briefly, brain sections were reacted with primary antibody (CD31, 1:50 in 1% donkey
serum, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and second antibody (Alexa Fluor 594-
conjuated donkey anti-rat IgG, 1:200, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Five images in the non-ischemic cortex or peri-infarct regions, determined by
staining the adjacent sections with Fluoro-Jade as described above, were taken from
each section under a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP2, Wetzlar, Germany).
Quantification of vessel density was obtained from these pictures using Image J
software (NIH). The mean volume of cMVD from six sequential brain sections of
individual mouse was calculated and expressed as numbers/mm2.
2.16. Statistical analysis
All data, excepting neurologic deficit scores, are presented as mean  SE. The
neurologic deficit scores were expressed as median (range). The neurological deficit
scores among different groups were compared by the KruskaleWallis test. When the
KruskaleWallis test showed a significant difference, the ManneWhitney U-tests
were applied. For the remaining experiments, comparisons for two groups were
performed by the student’s t test. Multiple comparisons were analyzed by one- or
two-way ANOVA. For all tests, a P-value<0.05 was considered significant.

The level of Ang II was decreased and the level of Ang (1-7) was
increased in the brain parenchyma of SARA mice (P< 0.01). There
were no changes in the plasma and cerebral vessels. These data
indicates that the beneficial effects of ACE2 over-expression might
be attributed to the increased brain Ang (1-7) and decreased Ang II
level.
3.2. Neuronal over-expression of ACE2 increases the brain level of
angiogenic factors
The ELISA assay revealed that the levels of VEGF, EGF, IL-6 and
IFN-gin the total brain protein of SARA mice were higher than in RA
mice (P< 0.05 or 0.01; Fig. 2).
3.3. Neuronal over-expression of ACE2 changes the Nox/eNOS
expression and NO/ROS levels
The ROS immune-staining was lower, while the NO levels were
higher in SARA mice than those in RA mice (P< 0.05; Fig. 3). The
eNOS expression of SARA mice was higher than RA mice both in
cerebral vessel and vessel-depleted brain parenchyma fractions
(P< 0.05 or 0.01; Fig. 4A). The Nox 2, 4 expressions of SARA mice
was lower than RA mice both in cerebral vessel and vessel-depleted
brain parenchyma fractions (P< 0.05 or 0.01; Fig. 4B and C).
3.4. Both peripheral infusion of NE and icv infusion of A-779 can
increase the MAP of SARA mice to a similar level as RA mice
As shown inFig. 5, there is no different between the MAP before
and after MCAO. SARA mice had lower MAP than RA mice
(1196 mmHgvs.134 11 mmHg,P<0.05). To “clamp”the BP in
SARA mice similarly as in RA mice, we chose to use a continuous
infusion of NE. As we expected, after “clamping”for 7 days, the MAP
in SARA group was shown to increase to the same level as that in RA
group (P>0.05). Aftericvinfusion of A-779 for 7 days, the MAP was
significantly increased (P < 0.05), and was similar to that in the
“clamping” group (P>0.05), suggesting that Ang (1-7) stimulation
of the MasR is important for the central regulation of BP.
3.5. Neuronal over-expression of ACE2 decreases ischemia induced
cerebral injury and improves neurological function in a BP-
independent manner
On day 2 after MCAO, there was no mortality across different
groups. The stroke volume in SARA mice was significantly less than
in RA mice (15.3  0.6 vs. 21.5  1.0%, SARA mice vs. RA mice,
P< 0.05; Fig. 6A and B). After BP “clamping”, the MCAO-induced
infarct volume in SARA mice was similar as those before BP
“clamping” (17.2  0.5 vs. 15.3  0.6%, “clamping” vs. vehicle,
P > 0.05). A-779 significantly increased the infarct volume
(P < 0.05). Similarly, SARA mice had better neurological function
after MCAO (P< 0.05; Fig. 6C). BP “clamping” did not change the
NDS of SARA mice (P>0.05;Fig. 6C). In contrast, A-779 significantly
increased the NDS (P< 0.05). These data suggest that reduction of
the infarct volume and improvement of neurological function is
independent of BP level and requires the activation of MasR
signaling pathways.
3.6. Neuronal over-expression of ACE2 preserves CBF in the periinfarct
area in a BP-independent manner
SARA mice had better preservation of CBF in the peri-infarct
area (18.9  1.0% vs. 50.2  4.2%, for SARA mice and RA mice,
respectively; P< 0.05; Fig. 7A). BP “clamping” did not change the
CBF in the peri-infarct area of SARA mice (P > 0.05; Fig. 7A). In
contrast, A-779 significantly decreased the CBF in the peri-infarct
area (P< 0.05). These data suggest that preservation of CBF is independent
of BP level and dependent on the activation of MasR
signaling pathways.
3.7. Neuronal over-expression of ACE2 increases cMVD in the periinfarct
area in a BP-independent manner
There is no different between RA mice and SARA mice on the
basal level of cMVD (in contralateral). The cMVD in the peri-infarct
area of SARA mice was significantly higher than those of RA mice
(P<0.05;Fig. 7B). BP “clamping”had no effect on cMVD in the periinfarct
area of SARA mice (P> 0.05; Fig. 7B). Interestingly, A-779
was able to decrease the cMVD in the peri-infarct area (P< 0.05).
These data suggest that elevation of cMVD is independent of BP
level and dependent on the activation of MasR signaling pathways.
Altogether with the data on the increased angiogenic factors in
SARA mice, these data imply that the increased level of angiogenic
factors might contribute to the increase of cMVD.

4. Discussion
There are three major findings in the present study. Firstly and
importantly, MCAO-induced brain injury is decreased in the SARA
mice when compared with the chronically hypertensive RA mice.
Blockade of the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/MasR pathway in the brain
partially abolishes the beneficial effects of ACE2 overexpression.
Secondly, the protective effect of neuronal ACE2 over-expression is
BP-independent. This is evidenced by the similar brain injury after
BP “clamping”. Thirdly, the mechanisms of the cerebral protective
effect of ACE2 is probably due to the up-regulation of eNOS/NO,
angiogenic factors, and down-regulation of Nox/ROS expression.
The data from this study suggest that activation of brain ACE2/Ang
(1-7)/MasR pathway could protect from cerebral ischemic injury.
Transgenic models have the advantage of providing stable and
chronic expression of target genes and offer a useful tool for
studying the role of the RAS in ischemic stroke. Our previous study
demonstrates that brain injury is exaggerated in the RA mice model
following MCAO-induced ischemic stroke (Chen et al., 2009). To
investigate the critical role of central ACE2, Xia et al. (Xia et al.,
2009) generated the triple transgenic SARA mice. They found that
neuronal ACE2 over-expression exhibits protective effects on
spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity, parasympathetic tone and BP. In
the present study, we found the levels of MAP in SARA mice to be
lower compared to the RA, which is consistent with previous data
(Xia et al., 2009). The main mechanism involved is thought to be
the ACE2 cleaving of Ang II into Ang (1-7). Since Ang II causes cerebral
vasoconstriction, activation of brain ACE2 activity in SARA
mice could accelerate Ang II degradation and Ang (1-7) production,
which results in inhibition of AT1R-mediated vasoconstriction and
lower BP. Based on this, we measured the Ang II and Ang (1-7)
levels in the plasma, brain parenchyma and cerebral vessel. Our
data show that the level of Ang (1-7) in the brain parenchyma is
increased, while the Ang II level is decreased. This is consistent with
previous study showing that after chronic ACE2 over-expression in
the mouse brain, the formation of Ang (1-7) is the major pathway
involved in BP regulation (Feng et al., 2010).
Previous study shows the presence of ACE2 in the mouse brain,
including in regions involved in the central regulation of vascular
function (Doobay et al., 2007). Diz et al. (Diz et al., 2008) reported
that pharmacological inhibition of ACE2 in the dorsal brain stem
results in the reduction of the reflex bradycardia in anesthetized
rats, suggesting the importance of ACE2 in the central regulation of
BP. However, very few studies have investigated the role of central
ACE2 expression/activity in ischemic stroke. The main goal of this
study is to assess the effects of ACE2 over-expression on Ang II-
mediated responses in ischemic stroke. Our data provide the first
evidence that neuronal over-expression of ACE2 counteracts Ang II-
mediated responses on MCAO-induced ischemic stroke by showing
the deceased infarct volume, lower neurological deficits, increased
CBF and elevated cMVD in the peri-infarct area of SARA mice.
Elevated cMVD in the peri-infarct area could be a mechanism for
increased CBF. Interestingly, neuronal over-expressing ACE2 had no
effect on cMVD in contralateral side (basal level of cMVD). That
could be explained by the protective effects of ACE2 on injury.
Moreover, blockade of the MasR with A779 reversed those effects,
which provides further evidence for the protective effects of ACE2/
Ang (1-7)/MasR activation on ischemic stroke. Taken together,
these findings suggest a critical role for ACE2 in the central protection
of ischemic stroke.

Recent clinical evidence suggests that the beneficial effect of
AT1R blockade on ischemic stroke can be observed independent of
the effects on BP and cerebral flow (Dahlöf et al., 2002). This
conclusion is also supported by a study of cultured embryonic
neurons showing that cells from AT1R/ mice had less damage
after oxygen-glucose deprivation (Walther et al., 2002). However,
data supporting a BP-independent effect of ACE2 on ischemic
stroke are lacking. To exclude the possible influence of low BP-
mediated improvements in SARA mice, BP “clamping” was performed
in the triple transgenic mice, to maintain a high BP level in
these mice. Accordingly, we found that BP “clamping” did not
change the beneficial effects of ACE2 over-expression on ischemic
stroke. This finding supports the novel concept that ACE2 could
exhibit protective effects on ischemic stroke by a BP-independent
manner. In addition, the reduction in infarct volume is more
striatal than cortex, which is the area was reflected by the
improvement of CBF with laser Doppler. Therefore, the reduction in
infarct volume in striatal area might suggest that the protective
effects of ACE2 overexpressing could be independent on the
improvement of CBF. Although this deduce need further investigation
, it is well supported by our a previous report showing Ang II
overproduction exaggerates ischemic injury by using oxygen and
glucose deprivation (OGD) experiment on brain slices, which
indicate the effect of Ang II on ischemic stroke is blood flowindependent
(Chen et al., 2009). Taken together, our current findings
suggest that ACE2 could induce both blood flow dependent
(cortex) and independent (stratum) protective effect on ischemic
stroke.
As mentioned above, ACE2 plays a central role in Ang (1-7)
formation and our data show a decreased Ang II/Ang (1-7) ratio in
the brain of SARA mice. Based on these, we consider the beneficial
effects of ACE2 over-expression on ischemic stroke that might come
from both decreased Ang II and increased level of Ang (1-7). Since
the detrimental effect of Ang II on ischemic stroke has been
confirmed in our previous study (Chen et al., 2009), decreased Ang
II could account for the protective effects of ACE2 on ischemic
stroke. Besides the reduction of Ang II’s detrimental effects, the
increased production of Ang (1-7) should be an important direct
factor contributing to the protective effects. Ang (1-7) is the main
angiotensin peptide in the CNS and is widely expressed in different
regions of the brain, including the hypothalamus, hippocampus,
amygdala and many others (Becker et al., 2007). Recent studies
show that central administration of Ang (1-7) or an ACE2 activator
diminishes the cerebral infarct size and behavioral deficits (Mecca
et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2012), which provide evidence to support
our results.
There are several possible underlying mechanisms for the
beneficial effect of ACE2 over-expression on ischemic stroke. One of
the possible molecular pathways involved in these mechanisms is
the synthesis of NO, a crucial factor for vessel dilation that is
modulated by Ang (1-7). Indeed, Zhang et al. have shown that
central administration of Ang (1-7) up-regulates eNOS expression
and consequently increases NO release in ischemic tissues in rats
(Zhang et al., 2008). ACE2 over-expression also increased eNOS and
NO levels in cerebrospinal fluid of mice (Feng et al., 2010). During
the early stages of cerebral ischemia, eNOS-derived NO is beneficial
as it promotes collateral circulation and microvascular flow
(Veltkamp et al., 2002). Interestingly, our data add new information
to this concept, showing that neuronal ACE2 over-expression upregulates
the expression of eNOS and elevates NO production in the
brain tissue. The other possible mechanism involved is the oxidative
stress pathway. Nox-derived ROS play a key role in Ang II-
mediated detrimental effects on ischemic stroke (Doughan et al.,
2008). A recent study also demonstrates that the cerebroprotective
action of Ang (1-7) is mediated by its antiinflammatory effects through a reduction of oxidative stress
(Jiang et al., 2012). Our results showed neuronal ACE2 overexpression
down-regulates the expression of Nox 2/Nox 4 and alleviates
the ROS production, which is consistent with a previous
study showing ACE2-mediated reduction of oxidative stress in the
central nervous system (Xia et al., 2011). Furthermore, we deepen
the research by studying the levels of angiogenic factors in the brain
of SARA mice. Indeed, our results show that over-expression of
ACE2 in the brain could up-regulate the expressions of VEGF, FGF,
IFN-g and IL-6 in the brain. VEGF was demonstrated to exert neuroprotective
action and associated with reduced neurological deficits
after focal cerebral ischemia (Gora-Kupilas and Josko, 2005).
EGF is a potent growth factor which enhances proliferation and
survival of neural progenitor cells (Ramasamy et al., 2013). Previous
clinical studies in patients with ischemic stroke suggest that IL-6
induces an excessive inflammatory response, which may aggravate
ischemic cerebral damage (Beamer et al., 1995). In contrast,
accumulating paradoxical experimental data have revealed that ILFig.

6 can promote a pro-survival signaling pathway and then involved
in cytoprotection and angiogenesis (Lecour and James, 2011).
Therefore, our study adds a new mechanism for cerebroprotective
action of ACE2 after ischemic stroke.
In conclusion, our results establish the importance of central
ACE2 in the regulation of eNOS/NO and Nox/ROS, and its potential
as a novel target for the prevention and treatment of ischemic
stroke.
4.1. Limitations and translational potential of the study
In this study, we examined the effects of neural over-expressing
ACE2 on ischemic stroke. The possible impact of Ang II and ACE
activity feedback was not explored (Schunkert et al., 1993). We
revealed that eNOS/NO and Nox/ROS pathways are the mechanisms
underlying the protective effects of ACE2. Nevertheless, other
mechanisms such as inflammation cytokines and MMP need
further investigation. In addition, the effects of A779 on ischemic
stroke injury were tested by administrating A779 seven days before
MCAO, which let the animal recover from the surgery oficvinfusion
kit implantation and to allow the drug fully enters into brain tissue.
Of note, this approach could induce other changes in the brain.
The present work is intended to inform future therapeutic approaches
to the management of stroke. The mode of experimentation
we have used also lends itself as an experimental paradigm
not only of the immediate protective effects on stroke events but
also potentially for the exploration of longer term cognitive
impairment effects following stroke such as is very relevant for
vascular dementia. In this study we focused mainly on motor effects
, yet a longer study including cognitive measures might provide
equally thought provoking results in relation to protection
against vascular event induced cognitive impairment.
