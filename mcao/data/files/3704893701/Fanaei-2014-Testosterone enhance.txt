Introduction

Stroke is one of mainly responsible factors for long-term disability and death throughout the world (Roger et al., 2012; Wang
et al., 2012). Epidemiological studies have shown that overall
incidence of stroke is higher in men in relation with agematched women in most countries. A large part of this difference
between sexes is attributed to sex steroids (Liu et al., 2009).
Previous studies demonstrated that estrogen and progesterone
give protection against cerebral ischemia by several mechanisms
(Liu et al., 2009; Herson et al., 2009). Human studies suggested
male susceptibility to cerebral ischemia is high, because male
sex is a stroke risk factor in humans and low testosterone levels
have been associated with risk for stroke and worse outcomes
after stroke in men (Herson et al., 2009). In rodents, endogenous
testosterone removal by castration before cerebral ischemia
decreased the histological damage; whereas testosterone replacement increased brain injury (Liu et al., 2009; Herson et al.,
2009). In contrast, testosterone replacement after cerebral ischemia in castrated rodents improved histological and behavioral
recovery (Liu et al., 2009; Herson et al., 2009; Fanaei et al., 2013;
Uchida et al., 2009). It is now well documented through in vivo
and in vitro studies that estrogen provides powerful protection
against ischemic brain injury through several mechanisms (e.g.
reduces inﬂammatory response and oxidative stress, increases
neurogenesis and angiogenesis) (Liu et al., 2009; Herson et al.,
2009). But much less is known with regard to mechanisms of
neuroprotective effects of testosterone after cerebral ischemia.
Accordingly, we aimed at assessing the effects of testosterone
replacement after focal cerebral ischemia in male castrate rats
on oxidative stress, BDNF levels, infarct volume, neurogenesis,
and functional recovery.

Biochemical analysis of serum

2.2.1. Effect of testosterone post-treatment on
Malondialdehyde (MDA) level in serum
Signiﬁcant differences (po0.001) in MDA level was observed
in MCAO group animals when compared to sham group on
1st, 3rd, 7th and 10th days after cerebral ischemia (Fig. 1).
On 7th and 10th days after ischemia, only testosterone
post-treated (MCAOþT) group exhibited signiﬁcant reduction
in MDA levels in comparison to MCAO (both po0.001) and
MCAOþT/F (po0.05 and po0.001 respectively) groups. Animals of MCAOþT/F group showed no signiﬁcant differences
in MDA level as compared to MCAO group during experiment.

2.2.2. Effect of testosterone post-treatment on superoxide
dismutase (SOD) activity in serum
The activity of SOD was signiﬁcantly reduced (po0.001) in all
ischemic groups as compared to sham group on 1st day after
cerebral ischemia (Fig. 2). Testosterone post-treatment signiﬁcantly recovered the activity of SOD in MCAOþT group as
compared to MCAO group on 3rd (po0.01), 7th (po0.001) and
10th days (po0.001) and as compared to MCAOþT/F group on
3rd (po0.05), 7th (po0.001) and 10th days (po0.01), respectively. There were no signiﬁcant differences in the activity of
SOD between MCAOþT/F group and MCAO group.

2.2.3. Effect of testosterone post-treatment on catalase (CAT)
activity in serum
In the ischemic groups, CAT activities were signiﬁcantly
(po0.001) lower as compared to sham group values during
experiment (Fig. 3). CAT activity gradually increased in
MCAOþT group and had signiﬁcant differences with MCAO
group on 7th (po0.01) and on 10th (po0.001) days and with
MCAOþT/F group on 3rd (po0.05) and on 10th (po0.001) days

after ischemia. No statistical difference in CAT activity
observed when comparison was made between MCAO group
and MCAOþT/F group.

2.2.4. Effect of testosterone post-treatment on lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) level in serum
As shown in Fig. 4, cerebral ischemia signiﬁcantly (po0.001)
increased LDH levels in the serum of all ischemic groups on
1st day when compared to sham group. Animals of MCAOþT
group showed signiﬁcant diminution in LDH levels in comparison to MCAO and MCAOþT/F groups on 3rd, 7th and 10th
days after ischemia (all days po0.001). MCAOþT/F group had
no signiﬁcant differences in LDH level as compared to
MCAO group.

2.2.5. Effect of testosterone post-treatment on BDNF level in
serum
Analysis of serum samples clearly indicated that testosterone
therapy in MCAOþT group increased the level of BDNF in
comparison with MCAO and MCAOþT/F groups (Fig. 5). After
cerebral ischemia, the mean concentrations of BDNF levels in
serum were declined in all ischemic groups. Consequently,
BDNF concentrations slowly increased as the experiment
continued till the end, in all ischemic groups. But, this
improvement was signiﬁcantly greater in MCAOþT group as
compared to MCAO group on 3rd (po0.05), 7th (po0.001) and

Testosterone levels

Serum samples from animals of sham and MCAO group had
serum testosterone concentrations below the limit of detection. There was no signiﬁcant difference in serum testosterone concentrations between MCAOþT (3.8770.38 ng/ml) and
MCAOþT/F (4.170.4 ng/ml) groups.

2.3.

Biochemical analysis of brain

2.3.1. Effect of testosterone post-treatment on MDA level
in brain
The levels of brain tissue MDA in MCAO and MCAOþT/F
groups were signiﬁcantly higher (po0.05) than sham group
(Table 1). Post-treatment with testosterone in MCAOþT group
signiﬁcantly reduced the elevated MDA level (po0.05) as
compared with the MCAO group on 10th day after cerebral
ischemia. Though MDA level in MCAOþT/F group had no
signiﬁcant difference with the MDA level in MCAO group.

2.3.2. Effect of testosterone post-treatment on activities
of SOD and CAT in brain
The levels of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and CAT) in brains of
MCAO group were signiﬁcantly (po0.05) lower than sham
group (Table 1). Their activities in brains of MCAOþT group
were signiﬁcantly (po0.05) elevated as compared to MCAO
group. Although CAT activity in MCAOþT group was signiﬁcantly (po0.05) lower than sham group, SOD activity did not
show signiﬁcant difference with sham group.

2.3.3. Effect of testosterone post-treatment on LDH content
of brain
In the MCAO group, a signiﬁcant (po0.05) decrease of LDH
levels in brains were seen as compared to sham values
(Table 1). This reduction in LDH level was signiﬁcantly
(po0.05) restored by post-treatment with testosterone in
MCAOþT group as compared to MCAO group. No signiﬁcant
restoration in LDH levels in brains of MCAOþT/F group was
seen when compared to MCAO group.

2.3.4. Effect of testosterone post-treatment on BDNF levels
of brain
To determine whether BDNF mediates the effect of testosterone, BDNF levels in brains were measured. As shown in
Table 1, no statistical differences in BDNF levels in brains
were observed between sham, MCAO and MCAOþT/F groups.
However, BDNF level in brains of MCAOþT group was signiﬁcantly (po0.05) higher than MCAO and MCAOþT/F groups.

2.4.

Neurobehavioral tests

2.4.1.

Ladder rung walking test

Prior to MCAO, baseline assessments were exhibited, rats
from all groups were able to cross the ladder with minimum
errors and similar scores (Fig. 6a). Following MCAO surgery,
the mean scores of ladder rung walking test were signiﬁcantly (po0.001) reduced in all ischemic groups than sham
group on 1st day after ischemia.
MCAO and MCAOþT/F groups showed slight improvement
as the experiment continued till the end process, but their
scores were signiﬁcantly lower (po0.001) than sham group on
3rd, 7th and 10th days after ischemia. Animals of MCAOþT

group showed better improvement than MCAO and MCAOþT/
F groups during the experiment process and on 10th day after
ischemia MCAOþT group had shown signiﬁcantly (po0.001)
better score than them.

2.4.2.

Rotarod test

One day after MCAO surgery there was a similar signiﬁcant
(po0.001) reduction in time of all ischemic groups as compared to sham group (Fig. 6b) and then their ability to stay on
rotarod device slightly improved toward the 10th day after
ischemia. In addition, when MCAOþT group compared with
MCAO and MCAOþT/F groups had signiﬁcantly (po0.001)
better improvement in the average of time that rats stayed
on the rotarod device on 7th and 10th days after ischemia.

2.4.3.

Adhesive removal test

This test showed that somatosensory function signiﬁcantly
(po0.001) weakened after ischemia in all ischemic groups as
compared to sham group (Fig. 6c). No signiﬁcant differences
in adhesive removal times were between ischemic groups on
1st day after ischemia. On 7th and 10th days after ischemia,
MCAOþT group had signiﬁcant (po0.001) lower adhesive

78

brain research 1558 (2014) 74–83

removal times than MCAO and MCAOþT/F groups, indicating
that testosterone therapy after cerebral ischemia has beneﬁcial effects to sensorimotor impairment.

2.5.
Effects of testosterone post-treatment on neurogenesis
in the ischemic brain
In this study, we examined whether testosterone therapy
enhanced neurogenesis in the ischemic brains or not (Fig. 7).
As expected, cerebral ischemia signiﬁcantly increased (po0.05)
the number of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) positive cells (as a
marker of cell proliferation) and Doublecortin (DCX) positive
cells (as a marker of migrating neuroblasts) in the subventricular zone (SVZ), striatum and cortex of the ipsilateral
ischemic brain hemisphere of MCAO group after ischemia, as
compared with the sham group (Fig. 8).
Remarkably, treatment of ischemic animals with testosterone in MCAOþT group signiﬁcantly (po0.05) increased the
number of BrdU/DCX positive cells in all the areas listed (SVZ,
striatum and cortex) than MCAO and MCAOþT/F groups.
In contrast, number of BrdU/DCX positive cells in the ipsilateral SVZ, striatum and cortex regions of MCAOþT/F group
had not shown signiﬁcant difference with the MCAO group.

2.6.

Brain infarct volume

On the 10th day after ischemia, testosterone post-treatment
in MCAOþT group reduced the infarct volume to 16.9373.9%,
which was signiﬁcantly (po0.05) less than the MCAO group
volume (37.1876.26%), (Fig. 9). The infarct volume of
MCAOþT/F group also had no signiﬁcant difference with
MCAO group at this time.

3.

Discussion

This study showed several important new ﬁndings about
effects of testosterone post-treatment in castrated male rats
after focal cerebral ischemia. First, testosterone reduced severity of stroke-induced oxidative stress during the experiment
process. Second, testosterone markedly increased BDNF levels
in serum and brain tissue. Third, testosterone therapy
increased stroke-induced neurogenesis. In the present study
to prove the hypothesis testosterone signals through the
androgen receptor impacts on stroke outcomes, ﬂutamide
(well-characterized antiandrogen) was used. Because of its
ability to pass through blood–brain barrier and it has been
widely used in rodent experiments for elimination effects of
testosterone (Uchida et al., 2009; Ali Reza and Nayebi, 2008,
2004; Chen et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2009). Co-administration of
the ﬂutamide with testosterone in our study inhibits all
testosterone effects. Based on these results, signaling mechanisms correlated with androgen receptor are involved in these
beneﬁcial effects of testosterone. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production markedly increases in brain under ischemic conditions. Furthermore, brain ischemia attenuates the antioxidant
defense system and thereby exacerbates oxidative damages
(Ahmad et al., 2006; Nazam Ansari et al., 2008). To our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst report about the potential advantageous effects of testosterone on oxidative stress and the

antioxidant defense system after cerebral ischemia in rodents.
In consistent with our results, Túnez et al. (2007) showed
testosterone has neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress
induced by 3-nitropropionic acid in ovariectomized rats. They
have shown 3-nitropropionic acid administration increased
MDA levels and reduced CAT activity in striatum; whereas
these effects were reversed by testosterone administration
(Túnez et al., 2007). In addition, a few in vitro studies have
reported that testosterone increases the expression of some
antioxidant factors. For example, Ahlbom et al. (1999) showed
testosterone administration increases CAT activity and protect
cerebellar granule cells against oxidative stress (Ahlbom et al.,
1999). Our study demonstrated that post-treatment with testosterone can increase BDNF levels in serum and brain tissue
after cerebral ischemia. Again there was no information available about the effects of testosterone therapy on BDNF levels
after cerebral ischemia. Nevertheless, a recent study showed
castration of male mice decreases BDNF levels in CA1 area of
the hippocampus (Li et al., 2012). In addition, several studies
reported in male rats, castration reduces BDNF levels and
BDNF's receptor (trkB) expression in spinal motorneuron populations, which was prevented by testosterone replacement
(Osborne et al., 2007; Verhovshek et al., 2010; Ottem et al.,
2007, 2010). Also, in adult canaries, testosterone treatment
increased BDNF levels in the higher vocal center and then
BDNF induces neurogenesis and promotes survival of new
neurons (Rasika et al., 1999; Alvarez-Borda et al., 2004;
Brenowitz 2012; Chen et al., 2013). Brain ischemia induces an
acute stress reaction that led to reductions in circulating
testosterone (Herson et al., 2009; Fanaei et al., 2013). Therefore,
testosterone reduction after ischemia can be one of the reasons
of BDNF reduction after cerebral ischemia in our study and it
seems reasonable, that testosterone therapy in our study could
restore BDNF levels in serum and brain tissue after stroke.
Although brain ischemia itself stimulates endogenous neurogenesis (Lindvall and Kokaia 2010), testosterone administration
in our study yet increased stroke-induced neurogenesis in SVZ,
striatum and cortex areas. Mechanisms by which testosterone
act to enhance neurogenesis in our study is not well known, but
one candidate may be BDNF. This is consistent with previous
studies demonstrating that testosterone modulates expression
of BDNF protein and its receptor (Fargo et al., 2009). Our study
indicates testosterone post-treatment can reduce histological
damage and enhance sensorimotor recovery after cerebral
ischemia. The behavioral improvement in our study was likely
to reﬂect the smaller infarct volume rather than neurogenesis
(as it improved on 7th day well before any neuronal connection
could be made to account for recovery).
Our results appear to be consistent with results of Uchida
et al. (2009) showed that testosterone improves the histologic
and behavioral impairment after stroke in mice, which were
blocked by ﬂutamide (Uchida et al., 2009). Studies have shown
that most of the histologic and sensorimotor improvements
after strokes are related to neurogenesis, angiogenesis, inhibition of apoptosis and viability enhancement of cerebral
cells (Yuan, 2009; Zhang and Chopp, 2009; Chopp et al., 2009).
May be, most enhanced recovery by testosterone in our study
was more likely due to inhibition of apoptosis and enhancement of cell viability that were secondary to enhanced BDNF
levels and antioxidant defenses, because recovery caused by

neurogenesis required more time than that we assessed in
our study.

Conclusions

In summary, results of our study showed that testosterone
post-treatment may be contribute to histologic and sensorimotor recovery via gradual enhancement of antioxidant
defense system, BDNF levels and neurogenesis. Therefore,
we suggest further studies to evaluate different doses and
durations of testosterone therapy after cerebral ischemia.

Experimental procedures

This study was approved by the Institutional Animal
Research Ethics Committee at Tehran University of Medical
Sciences. Financial support was provided by Tehran University of Medical Sciences. All chemicals were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich (America), unless otherwise stated.

5.1.

Animals

Experiments were carried out on male Wistar rats weighing
300–350 g. The rats were maintained under controlled conditions with temperature at 22–24 1C, relative humidity of 40–
50% and a 12 h lighting cycle and permitted ad libitum access
to water and standard lab chow.

The experimental animals were randomly divided into four
groups (16 in each group). For all animals, castrations were
conducted 7 days before MCAO that induced cerebral ischemia. The ﬁrst group served as sham (sham group). Second
was MCAO animals and received vehicle only (MCAO group),
third was MCAO animals post-treated with testosterone
(2 mg/kg/day in 1 ml sesame oil; sc.) (MCAOþT group) and
fourth was MCAO animals post-treated with testosterone and
ﬂutamide (testosterone 2 mg/kg/day; sc.þﬂutamide 10 mg/kg/
day; sc.) (MCAOþT/F group). The dose of ﬂutamide was
selected based on previous studies (Ali Reza and Nayebi,
2008, 2004). All of animals in the sham group were castrated,
but they were sham ischemia rats. In all treatment groups,
drugs were administered once daily for 10 days from 24 h
after induction of brain ischemia. All animals were euthanized on 10th day following MCAO surgery. Eight animals in
each group were decapitated to obtain brain tissue samples
for biochemical analysis and brain tissues of the remaining
eight animals in each group were used for histopathological
evaluation.

Experimental design

Transient focal cerebral ischemia

MCAO was induced by intraluminal ﬁlament method as previously described (Fanaei et al., 2013; Vakili et al., 2007). Brieﬂy,
animals were anesthetized with Ketamine (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and
Xylazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Right common carotid artery (CCA) and
external carotid artery (ECA) were exposed and carefully

brain research 1558 (2014) 74–83

separated from the vagus nerve. MCAO was produced by
advancing a silicone-coated nylon monoﬁlament through the
ECA into the internal carotid artery and then into the circle of
Willis until a mild increase in resistance was felt. Such light
resistance indicates that the tip of the nylon thread reached the
origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) (18–20 mm from CCA
bifurcation). Later on, ﬁlament was ﬁxed in place by fastening a
silk suture around the ECA. Blood ﬂow of the MCA territory was
measured by laser-Doppler ﬂowmetry (LDF) (moorVMS-LDF1HP, Moor Instruments Ltd., Oxford, England). The effectiveness
of MCAO was conﬁrmed by sustained reduction in LDF signal
dropped to o25% of pre-ischemic baseline. Surgery was operated in 15 to 20 min. Ninety minutes later, the ﬁlament was
withdrawn to allow brain tissue reperfusion. Rats were then
allowed to recover and were observed according to the experimental protocol. In sham-operated rats, the ECA was surgically
prepared for the insertion of the ﬁlament, but the ﬁlament was
not inserted.

Adhesive removal test

To assess somatosensory deﬁcit, adhesive removal test was
performed (Chen et al., 2001; van der Zijden et al., 2008). Two
small pieces of adhesive tapes (113 mm2) were placed on the
distal-radial region on the wrist of both forelimbs. Before
MCAO, animals were ﬁrst familiarized with the test and to
do this the animals were trained for 3 days (ﬁve times in
each day). After MCAO, ﬁve trials per testing day were
performed and time to removing each stimulus from forelimbs was recorded.

5.5.3.

Rotarod test

The rotarod test was used to assess motor recovery after
MCAO (Kawai et al., 2010; Ulbrich et al., 2012). Before MCAO,
each rat trained once per day during a 3 day interval. After
MCAO, four trials per testing day were performed and the cutoff time was 5 min between trials. Rotarod apparatus was set
to accelerate from 4 to 40 rpm over a 5 min period. The time
that each rat spent on the rotarod was recorded as the
animal's run time.

5.6.

Determination of serum testosterone concentration

The blood was collected on 1st, 3rd, 7th and 10th days after
MCAO from rat's tail and centrifuged (4 1C, 3000g for 15 min)
to separate the serum. Brain samples were obtained at the
10th day after MCAO and then they were homogenized with a
homogenizer. After that, homogenized brain samples were
centrifuged (4 1C, 10,000g for 10 min) and supernatant was
collected. Serum and brain BDNF (ELISA kit, Promega, USA)
and MDA (A003; Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute,
Nanjing, China) levels and LDH (A020-1; Nanjing Jiancheng
Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China), SOD (A001; Nanjing
Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) and CAT
activities were measured by using commercial kits, according
to the manufacturer's instructions.

Serum testosterone was measured for all animals to conﬁrm
the elimination of endogenous testosterone in castrated and
vehicle injected rats and to determine the effects of exogenous
testosterone injections on serum testosterone levels. Blood
samples were taken from animals at the 10th day after MCAO
and then were centrifuged for serum separation and serum
testosterone levels were determined by radioimmunoassay
kits (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, USA).

5.5.

5.8.

Neurobehavioral tests

All neurobehavioral evaluations were managed in a blinded
mode. On 1st, 3rd, 7th, and 10th days after MCAO, rats
experienced the following three neurobehavioral tests. Loss
and recovery of sensorimotor functions after MCAO were
assessed using the ladder rung walking test, adhesive
removal test, and rotarod test.

5.5.1.

Ladder rung walking test

For the ladder rung walking test, rats were run in the
horizontal ladder ﬁve times before MCAO to familiarize them
with the test and to establish baseline performance. In each
test session, rats had to cross the ladder ﬁve times consecutively. All test sessions were digitally recorded and then
hindlimb and forelimb placements were analyzed image by
image and scored according to Metz and Whishaw (2002)
(0, total miss; 1, deep slip; 2, slight slip; 3, replacement; 4,
correction; 5, partial placement; and 6, correct placement).
Final results were calculated from the total number of errors/
number of steps for each limb.

5.7.

BrdU labeling

To label proliferating cells, all animals were intraperitoneally
injected with BrdU (50 mg/kg) once daily from 1st to 10th day
after MCAO surgery.

Immunoﬂuorescence histochemistry

Single or double-label immunoﬂuorescent staining of brain
tissues were performed using cryopreserved 50-μm coronal
sections. For blocking, sections were incubated in 0.5% BSA/
0.3% Triton-X followed by 10% normal serum in PBS for 1 h.
For BrdU staining, sections were ﬁrst incubated in 1.5 M HCl
for 30 min at 37 1C and then incubated in blocking solution.
Sections with primary antibody were placed for 16 h at 4 1C.
After washing, sections were incubated for 2 h at room
temperature with ﬂuorophore-conjugated secondary antibody. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse
monoclonal anti-BrdU (1:200; Biodesign, San Diego, CA), goat
poly-clonal anti-Dcx (1:100; to label migrating neuroblasts;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). We analyzed data
on single labeling of BrdU and double labeling of BrdU/DCX.

5.9.

Measurement of brain infarct volume

Brain infarct volume evaluation was performed on the 10th
day after MCAO. Animals were deeply anesthetized and
transcardially perfused with 100 ml of saline and 150 ml of

82

brain research 1558 (2014) 74–83

4% paraformaldehyde, and then brains were removed. Subsequently, the brains were cut into coronal sections (50 μm)
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Sections were
scanned using a ﬂatbed scanner (Scanjet, Hewlett-Packard,
USA) connected to a computer. The images were analyzed
with Image J software (NIH). The infarct volume was calculated using the following formula: Infarct volume¼ (contralateral hemisphere volumenon-infarct volume in ipsilateral
hemisphere)/contralateral hemisphere volume.

5.10.

Statistical analysis

All data are expressed as mean7SD. Comparisons (infarct
volume, biochemical analysis of brain, cell proliferation, and
serum testosterone levels) were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test followed by Tukey's multiple
comparison tests. Neurobehavioral and serum biochemical
data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with repeated measures and further evaluated by Bonferroni post-hoc analyses.
Mortality was analyzed with chi-square. po0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad
Software, Inc., CA, USA) was used for the analyses and
calculations.
