Aim: Human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) have been shown to ameliorate cerebral ischemia in animal
models. In this study we investigated the effects of hUCB-MSCs on inflammatory responses and neuronal apoptosis during the early
stage of focal cerebral ischemia in rabbits.
Methods: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in male New Zealand rabbits by occlusion of MCA for 2 h. The blood samples were
collected at different time points prior and during MCAO-reperfusion. The animals were euthanized 3 d after MCAO, and the protein
levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α in the serum and peri-ischemic brain tissues were detected using Western blot and ELISA,
respectively. Inflammatory cell infiltration, neuronal apoptosis and neuronal density were measured morphologically. hUCB-MSCs
(5×106) were iv injected a few minutes after MCAO.
Results: The serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were rapidly increased, and peaked at 2 h after the start of MCAO. hUCB-MSC
transplantation markedly and progressively suppressed the ischemia-induced increases of serum IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels within
6 h MCAO-reperfusion. Focal cerebral ischemia decreased the serum level of IL-10, which was prevented by hUCB-MSC transplantation.
The expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α in the peri-ischemic brain tissues showed similar changes as in the serum. hUCB-MSC
transplantation markedly suppressed the infiltration of inflammatory cells, and increased the neuronal density around the ischemic
region. Furthermore, hUCB-MSC transplantation significantly decreased the percentage of apoptosis around the ischemic region.
Conclusion: hUCB-MSCs transplantation suppresses inflammatory responses and neuronal apoptosis during the early stage focal
cerebral ischemia in rabbits.

Introduction

Cerebral vascular diseases (CVD) are a major cause of
mortality and disability worldwide. In China, stroke is the
leading cause of death and the most common cause of serious adult disability. With an incidence of at least 1 500 000
patients, approximately 30% of patients become severely
and permanently disabled[1]. Many other survivors are left
with permanent functional impairments. Cerebral ischemia accounts for 60%–80% of all CVDs. The therapeutic
options for acute ischemic stroke remain very limited. Some

interventions during the acute phase of cerebral ischemia
such as thrombolytic and neuroprotective agents may
improve patient outcomes, such as survival and residual
disability.
In the background of this imperative clinical need, hundreds of studies have been published investigating the
therapeutic potential of endogenous or transplanted stem
cells in laboratory models of cerebral ischemia [2]. Therefore, the elucidation of potential mechanisms is vital for
the further development of stem cell therapy techniques
and, ultimately, their translation to the bedside. A number of proposed mechanisms have been investigated in
preclinical cerebral ischemia models, including the formation of new neuronal circuitry, reduced apoptosis, promotion of angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and other endogenous

repair processes [3–6].
Inflammatory processes have fundamental roles in the
pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia (and
its later reperfusion) leads to an inflammatory response that
is initiated in the microcirculation, which contributes to cellular destruction[7]. There are few data about stem cells
and inflammatory response. We hypothesized that stem cell
transplantation could modulate the inflammatory response in
the hyper-acute stage of cerebral ischemia. The use of human
mesenchymal stem cells to treat focal cerebral ischemia in animal models has been extensively studied[8–10].
In the present study, we examined the effect of human
umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cell (hUCB-MSC)
transplantation in focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rabbits. The inflammatory markers that we measured were tumor
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and
IL-10 during the early stage. Inflammatory cells infiltrate the
peri-ischemic region, particularly neutrophils, which are the
major inflammatory cell type, and contribute to the apoptosis
of the ischemic cortex. These results have contributed to the
elucidation of the mechanism of hUCB-MSC treatment during
ischemic injuries.

Materials and methods

All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Clinic College, Anhui
Medical University. Sixty-four male New Zealand white rabbits (provided by the Experimental Animal Center of Anhui
Medical University; age, 3 months; weight 2.51±0.22 kg) were
randomly divided into the following groups: ischemia-reperfusion group (IR, n=16), hUCB-MSC-treated group (IR+hUCBMSC, n=16), sham group (SH, n=16), normal saline-treated
group (IR+NS, n=16). They were housed in a conventional
state under adequate temperature (21 °C) with a 12-h light/
dark cycle and humidity (60%) controls. Each group could
freely access food and tap water. The handling and care of the
animals conformed to the established guidelines and complied
with the current international laws and policies (NIH Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, NIH Publication
No 85–23, 1985, revised 1996).
Cerebral ischemia model
The cerebral ischemia model was established according to the
method described by Nabavi et al[11]. Briefly, the right common
carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA), and internal carotid artery (ICA) were exposed through a ventral, midline incision. A nylon monofilament suture with a rounded
tip (head-end diameter 0.53 mm) was introduced into the
CCA lumen and gently advanced into the ICA until it blocked
the bifurcating origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA).
Two hours after occlusion, animals were re-anesthetized and
reperfused by withdrawing the suture until its tip cleared the
lumen of the CCA. All the experiments were randomized.
During the ischemic period, rabbits experiencing death, coma,
or convulsions were excluded from the experiment.

Culture of hUCB-MSCs and transplantation
Human UCB samples (80–100 mL) were collected from the
umbilical vein after deliveries with informed maternal consent. The isolation and expansion of hUCB-MSCs was conducted as previously reported[12]. Briefly, mononuclear cells
were isolated by centrifugation. The separated mononuclear
cells were washed, suspended in DMEM medium, and seeded
at a concentration of 1×106 cells/mL. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5%
CO2 with a change of culture medium twice per week. UCBderived mononuclear cells were set in culture, and the onset
of fibroblast-like adherent cells was observed. One to three
weeks later, when the monolayer of MSC colonies reached
80% confluence, the cells were trypsinized (0.25% trypsin),
washed, resuspended in culture medium, and subcultured
at a concentration of 5×104 cells/cm2. The MSCs from each
hUCB harvest were expanded ex vivo by successive sub-cultivations under the same conditions. The cells from the fifth
to eighth passage of each hUCB harvest with more than 1000fold expanding capacity were used for the experimental work.
Ethical approval for the use of hUCB-MSCs was obtained from
the Clinic College, Anhui Medical University.
hUCB-MSCs were injected intravenously within several
minutes after cerebral ischemia. hUCB-MSCs (5×106) diluted
in 2 mL PBS were injected slowly for five minutes via the right
femoral vein in the IR+hUCB-MSC group. For the IR+NS
group, 2 mL PBS without hUCB-MSCs were injected in the
same manner as the IR+hUCB-MSC group.
Blood collection and serum parameters measurement
Blood samples from each group were collected at pre-ischemia
(T0), ischemia 30 min (T1)，ischemia-reperfusion 2 h (T2),
4 h (T3) and 6 h (T4). Blood samples were centrifuged at
4600 r/min and stored at -80 °C until assayed. An ELISA kit
(Yuanye Biotech Co, Shanghai, China) was used to measure
the serum IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α expression levels
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Specimen preparations
After 3 d of MCAO, all rabbits were anesthetized with 20%
urethane. The brains were obtained and used for Western
blot, histopathological, and immunohistochemical studies.
Western blot
The production of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α at the protein
level was detected via Western blot. Total proteins from the
cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from the peri-ischemic
brain tissue. The protein concentration was determined by the
BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The protein
samples were boiled for 10 min in sample buffer [including
250 mm Tris-HCl, pH=6.8, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS),
10% glycerol, 2% mercaptoethanol, and 0.003% bromophenol
blue], separated on denaturing 7.5%, 10%, or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels; the samples were then electrotransferred onto
nitrocellulose membranes.

After being blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris buffered saline (TBS) with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room
temperature, the membranes were washed three times for
5 min in TBS-T. Then, the membranes were incubated with
primary Aβ (anti-IL-1β, anti-IL-6, anti-IL-10, and anti-TNF-α;
1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) in
blocking solution at 4 °C overnight with the appropriate secondary Abs in TBS for 1 h. Then, the membranes were reacted
with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) and exposed to films. The protein levels were
quantified by densitometry scanning using an image analysis
system (GSD8000, UVP, Cambridge, UK).
Histopathological studies
The brains were fixed with 10% formalin. After formalin fixation (24 h), the tissues were embedded in paraffin. Serial sections (6-μm thick) through the ischemic cortex were cut from
each rabbit. These sections were stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) for microscopic evaluation. Neurons in a linear
length (1 mm) were counted for each specimen. The quantity
of inflammatory cell infiltration around the ischemic region
was measured in each section. The number of inflammatory
cells was examined using a light microscope. At least 500 cells
from each group were examined in a blinded manner. The
data were averaged.
Immunocytochemistry
Brain sections were pre-boiled in citric buffer, pH 6.0, for 15
min. We observed leukocyte infiltration with monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) against Ly-6G (neutrophil-specific marker).
They were detected using the Ly-6G Detection Kit (Biosynthesis Biotech Co, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Four fields of view were examined for each slice.
The TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP
nick-end labeling) assay was then performed using an
ApopTag Fluorescein In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Roche)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Incubation with
labeling solution without the enzyme served as a negative
labeling control. TUNEL-positive cells were considered to be
undergoing apoptosis. The percentage of apoptosis (apoptotic
index: AI) was determined as a percentage of the total cell
number.
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as the mean±standard errors (SEM).
Student’s t-test was used to compare the differences between
two groups, and a one-way ANOVA was used to determine
significant differences between multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05.

Results

The effect of hUCB-MSCs on serum IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α
expression levels in the focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion
rabbit
To determine the effect of hUCB-MSCs on inflammatory
responses after focal cerebral ischemia, we measured the

serum IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α expression levels of rabbits with focal cerebral ischemia. The serum levels of IL-1β
and IL-6 increased after cerebral ischemia and peaked 2 h
after reperfusion. The serum levels of IL-1β and IL-6 in the
IR+hUCB-MSC group were lower than those of the IR and
IR+NS groups at each time point (P<0.05).
Interestingly, the serum level of TNF-α increased and
peaked 30 min after cerebral ischemia. The serum level of
TNF-α in the IR+hUCB-MSC group was lower than those of
the IR and IR+NS groups at each time point (P<0.05).
The serum level of IL-10 decreased after cerebral ischemia. The serum level of IL-10 in the hUCB-MSC group was
much higher than the IR and IR+NS groups after reperfusion
(P<0.05) (Table 1).
The effect of hUCB-MSCs on IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α expres­
sion within the ischemic region
Western blot analysis was performed for each inflammatory
factor of interest. Compared with the IR and IR+NS groups,
the IR+hUCB-MSC group had a decreased protein expression
of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α and a markedly increased protein
expression of IL-10 (P<0.05) (Figure 1).
The effect of hUCB-MSCs on inflammatory cell infiltration within
the peri-ischemic region
Multiple inflammatory cells (mainly neutrophils) were present
in the IR and IR+NS groups. The average number of inflammatory cells in the IR group was significantly increased. The
IR+hUCB-MSC group had a lower inflammatory cell count
than did the IR or IR+NS groups (P<0.05, Figure 2, 3).
The effect of hUCB-MSCs on neurons within the ischemic cortex
In the SH group, the neuronal density within the cortical ischemic area was 215±22 mm. In the IR and IR+NS groups, the
cortical ischemic area neuronal density was 121±7 mm and
115±6 mm, respectively. These data suggest that extensive
neuronal damage occurs during the IR period. However, the
neurons within the cortical ischemic area were well preserved
in the IR+hUCB-MSC group. The neuronal density in this
group was 203±13 mm, which is higher than those in the IR
and IR+NS groups (P<0.05) (Figure 2).
To investigate how hUCB-MSC transplantation prevents
ischemic damage, we examined AI in the ischemic cortex
using the focal cerebral ischemia model. The TUNEL-positive
cells displayed a brown stain within the nucleus or cytoplasm
in the apoptotic cells. There were occasional apoptotic cells
in the Sham group and multiple apoptotic cells in the IR and
IR+NS groups. The AI in the IR group was significantly
increased. The IR+hUCB-MSC group had a lower AI than did
the IR or IR+NS groups (P<0.05) (Figure 4).

Discussion

Ischemic brain injury is a complex pathology that leads to cell
death through energy depletion and triggers a variety of postischemic responses, especially inflammation[13]. The inflammatory response leads to neuronal destruction. Neurons, astroActa Pharmacologica Sinica

cytes, microglia, and endothelial cells are activated in response
to ischemia and release proinflammatory cytokines, including
IL-1 and TNF-α, which initiate this inflammatory response.
Then, the cytokines induce a secondary inflammatory response
and activate IL-6 and IL-8, which mediate the development of
an acute phase response (fever, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen) and the release of cell adhesion molecules that can cause

microvascular occlusion. Then, certain cytokines, such as IL-6
and TNF-α, stimulate matrix metalloprotease (MMP) production, which helps the migration of leukocytes to the vascular
wall and causes blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, leading
to vascular edema and neuronal cell death[14–16].
IL-1β directly enhanced the expression of chemokines
(eg, RANTES, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and IL-8) in
microglia and astrocytes[17, 18]. Because the loss of IL-1β function is reported to reduce infarct size, it is considered to be a
neurotoxic mediator. In addition, TNF-α promotes neurotoxic
effects by increasing the expression of chemotactic factors and
adhesion molecules of the vascular endothelium, which leads
to the early infiltration of monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells into the sites of injury and BBB breakdown[19].
TNF-α knockout mice have a reduced infarct volume compared to control mice. Moreover, excess IL-6 can stress liver
cells and increase the secretion of fibrinogen, which increases
the blood viscosity through thrombose[20]. However, IL-10 is
expressed as an anti-inflammatory cytokine that is produced
from regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg). It was reported that
IL-10 could suppress the neurotoxic functions of TNF-α and
IFN-γ[21] and alleviate BBB damage. IL-10 is also conductive
to the restoration of nerve cells and has a neuroprotective
effect[22].
Today, hUCB-MSCs have emerged as an alternative to bone
marrow-derived MSCs because of their greater availability,
weaker immunogenicity, and lower risk of mediating viral
transmission. The transplantation of hUCB-MSCs has induced
functional improvements in animal models. hUCB-MSC
transplantation reduces the number of activated microglia

and blocks the infiltration of immune cells in the brain following ischemic brain injury[23, 24]. In the present study, the
injection of hUCB-MSCs during the early stage reduced the
IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α expression levels in the serum and
enhanced IL-10 expression levels. Western blot analysis for
IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α three days after hUCB-MSC
transplantation strengthened these findings. The results suggest that hUCB-MSC transplantation could modulate the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. We also found
that hUCB-MSC transplantation reduced the accumulation of
inflammatory cells within the peri-ischemic region, which sug-

gests that hUCB-MSC treatment attenuates ischemic neuronal
injury by inhibiting inflammatory cell infiltration. Therefore,
hUCB-MSCs could provide neuroprotection by modulating
the inflammatory response, which might be a supplementary
mechanism for the treatment of ischemic stroke with hUCBMSCs. It is well known that NF-κB is a crucial transcription
factor that is involved in the regulation of inflammation.
NF-κB regulates a vast number of genes, including those
encoding cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, MCP-1, and
interferon-β)[25]. The transplantation of MSCs could inhibit the
activity of NF-κB and modulate the cytokine production in the
peri-infarct myocardium[26]. The hUBC-MSCs might downregulate NF-κB activity to modulate cytokines during reperfusion
after cerebral ischemia.
The role of apoptosis cannot be ignored in the progression
of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Evidence suggests
that MAPK-signaling cascades play an important role in apoptotic cell death. The MAPK family includes the extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK),
and p38 MAPK. They are activated in response to ischemiareperfusion-induced brain injury, and it is believed that the

gest that cytokines could induce neuronal apoptosis through a
variety of pathways.
Dasari and his colleagues [35] found that the mechanism
underlying hUCB neuroprotection involves the activation
of the Akt signaling pathway. Their research identified the
neuroprotective potential of hUCB against glutamate-induced
apoptosis in cultured cortical neurons. In the present study,
we observed that hUCB-MSC transplantation significantly
inhibited ischemia-reperfusion-induced neuronal apoptosis.
We speculate that the anti-inflammatory effect of hUCB-MSCs
may contribute to the anti-apoptotic action. Specifically,
hUCB-MSCs weaken the inflammatory cascade and reduce
the neurotoxic cytokine effects by reducing proinflammatory
cytokines during the early stage to achieve the inhibition of
apoptosis.
In conclusion, hUCB-MSC transplantation modulated the
inflammatory response during the early stage and inhibited
cortical apoptosis in a focal ischemia model in rabbits. The
intravenous delivery of hUCB-MSCs can be clinically applied
as an efficient, non-invasive transplantation therapy for ischemic brain injuries.

activation of MAPKs exerts deleterious effects through postischemic neuronal apoptosis[27–29]. It should be noted that JNK
and p38 are activated by proinflammatory cytokines and promote apoptosis[30]. Excess proinflammatory cytokines, such as
IL-1β, can lead to neuronal death and promote the synthesis
of nitric oxide in the brain. IL-1β can increase the intracellular calcium concentration and release neurotropic factors,
which can induce neuronal apoptosis[31]. TNF-α can stimulate neutrophils to produce calcium-dependent superoxide
anion, which directly damages DNA and non-chromosomal
DNA and induces neuronal apoptosis. TNF-α can also induce
arachidonic acid metabolite release, which generates the
synthesis of prostaglandin-mediated excitatory amino acids
(such as glutamate) to produce neurodegenerative toxicity. In
addition, TNF-α binds to TNFR-I, which activates caspase-8
and caspase-3 and leads to apoptosis[32]. IL-6 has neurotoxic
effects and promotes ischemic injury. It can also induce phospholipase A2 expression, which results in the production of
inflammatory mediators such as leukotriene, prostaglandins,
and platelet-activating factor[33]. However, IL-10 can reduce
the expression of apoptosis regulatory genes (fasL, caspase
and c-fos), oxygen free radicals, and cytokines, which could
decrease apoptosis during ischemia-reperfusion-induced brain
injury and have a neuroprotective effect[34]. These results sugActa Pharmacologica Sinica
