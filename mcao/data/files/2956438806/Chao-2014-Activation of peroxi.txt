Background: Peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor (PPAR)-b/d is a transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor family. There is little information about the effects of the immediate administration of specific ligands of
PPAR-b/d (GW0742) in animal models of acute ischemic stroke. Using a rat model
of middle cerebral ischemia occlusion (MCAO) in vivo, we have investigated the effect of pretreatment with GW0742 before MCAO. Methods: The neuroprotective effect of GW0742 against acute ischemic stroke was evaluated by the neurologic deficit
score (NDS), dry–wet weight, and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. The
levels of interleukin (IL)-1b, nuclear factor (NF)-kB, and tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-a were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expressions
of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), Bax, and Bcl-2 were detected by Western
blot. The apoptotic cells were counted by in situ terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl
transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling assay.
Results: The pretreatment with GW0742 significantly increased the expression of
Bcl-2, and significantly decreased in the volume of infarction, NDS, edema, expressions of IL-1b, NF-kB, TNFa, and Bax, contents of iNOS and the apoptotic cells in
infarct cerebral hemisphere compared with rats in the vehicle group at 24 hours after
MCAO. Conclusions: The study suggests the neuroprotective effect of the PPAR-b/
d ligand GW0742 in acute ischemic stroke by a mechanism that may involve its antiinflammatory and antiapoptotic action. Key Words: PPAR-b/d—GW0742—middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)—anti-inflammatory—rat.

ACTIVATION OF PPAR ATTENUATES ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE

well understood, but many studies have clearly shown
that inflammatory response and oxidative stress have
been found to play an important role in the pathogenesis
of cerebral ischemia.3
Peroxisome proliferator–activated receptors (PPARs)
are ligand-activated transcription factors that belong to
the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily.4 There are
three members of the PPAR subfamily: PPAR-a, PPARb/d, and PPAR-g. PPARs have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of a number of diseases, including diabetes
mellitus, obesity, atherosclerosis, and neurologic diseases.5 There is good evidence that WY14643, a selective
PPAR-a agonist, and rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, two
PPAR-g agonists, have the neuroprotective effect on cerebral ischemia.6,7 However, there is less information about
the role of ligands of PPAR-b/d in acute ischemic stroke.
PPAR-b/d exerts a strong protection from renal and gut
ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury.8,9 And many studies
had clearly shown that GW0742, a potent PPAR-b/
d agonist, exerts anti-inflammatory effects in atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, endotoxic shock, and lung
inflammation.10-13 Recent research indicated that PPARb/d plays an important role in integrating and regulating
central inflammation and food intake after middle
cerebral ischemia occlusion (MCAO).14
So the aim of our present study was to examine the neuroprotective effect of the PPAR-b/d ligand GW0742 on
MCAO in rats and its potential mechanisms.

MCAO and at reperfusion. The right femoral artery was
cannulated for continuous monitoring of blood pressure
and arterial blood sampling. A rectal probe was inserted
to monitor core temperature. Arterial blood gases and
plasma glucose were measured at baseline, during
MCAO and at reperfusion.

Experimental Protocol
Male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided
into 3 groups: sham group; vehicle group, which was pretreated with saline at 30 minutes before MCAO; GW0742
group, which was pretreated with GW0742 .3 mg/kg
(intraperitoneally) at 30 minutes before MCAO. The
rats in each of the groups were subdivided into 5 subgroups consisting of 8 animals. The first subgroup was
used for neurologic deficit score (NDS) and 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining; the second subgroup was used for brain water content; the third
subgroup was used for detecting nuclear factor (NF)-kB,
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, and interleukin (IL)-1b
by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; the fourth
subgroup was used for detecting inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS), Bcl-2, and Bax by Western Blot; and
the fifth subgroup was used for terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL). The sham
group was only subjected to surgical procedures, whereas
other animals were subjected to focal ischemia by MCAO
using intraluminal thread, and after 2 hours of MCAO reperfusion allowed by retracting the thread.

Animals
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 260-280 g
and aged 11-12 weeks were purchased from Xi’an Jiaotong
University Animal Services for this study. The protocol
was approved by the institutional animal care and use
committee and the local experimental ethics committee.
All rats were allowed free access to food and water before
surgery under optimal conditions (12/12 hours light/dark
with humidity of 60 6 5% and temperature of 22 6 3 C).

Evaluation of Neurologic Impairment
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, the neurologic deficit
of each rat was evaluated according to the Longa method
of a 5-point scale16 by the same experimenter, who was
blinded to the different treatments in the experiment
(no neurologic deficit 5 0, failure to extend right paw
fully 5 1, circling to right 5 2, falling to right 5 3, and being unable to walk spontaneously and depression of
consciousness 5 4).

Model of MCAO
MCA thread occlusion was induced according to the
previously published methods.15 Rats were anesthetized
with chloral hydrate at the dose of 380 mg/kg, intraperitoneally. The right common carotid artery was exposed
and separated carefully from the vagus nerve and ligated
at the more proximal side through a right paramedian
incision. The external carotid artery was ligated. The occipital and pterygopalatine arteries were coagulated.
Ischemia was produced by advancing a tip rounded .30mm nylon suture into the internal carotid artery through
the external carotid artery. Reperfusion was produced by
withdrawal of the intraluminal nylon suture. The physiological variables in rats were measured at baseline, during

Measurement of Infarct Volume
After the NDS, rats were killed and their brains quickly
removed and frozen at 220 C for 15 minutes. Coronal
brain sections (2-mm thick) were stained with 2% 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride at 37 C for 20 minutes followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brain slices
were scanned individually and the unstained area was
analyzed by the image analyzing system (Adobe Systems
Incorporated, San Jose, CA). To compensate for the effect
of brain edema, the corrected volume was calculated
using the following equation: percentage hemisphere
lesion volume (% HLV) 5 {[total infarct volume 2 (right
hemisphere volume 2 left hemisphere volume)]/left

hemisphere volume} 3 100%. Infarct volume measurements were carried out by an investigator blinded to the
treatment groups.

Evaluation of Cerebral Edema
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, cerebral edema was
determined by measuring the brain water content according to the wet–dry method.17 The rats were killed with
chloral hydrate anesthesia, and the brain was rapidly
removed and dissected. Brain samples from the ischemic
hemisphere were immediately weighed on an electronic
balance and then dried in an oven at 110 C for 24 hours
to obtain the dry weight. Brain water content was calculated as follows: brain water content (%) 5 (wet
weight 2 dry weight) 3 100/wet weight.

Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, rats were sacrificed and
the brain tissue homogenates were obtained from the infarct
cerebral hemisphere. The contents of NF-kB, TNF-a, and IL1b were measured in brain tissue homogenates using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits according
to the manufacturers’ instructions (NF-kB: Themicon International Inc Temecula, CA; TNF-a: Uscn Life, Wuhan,
China; IL-1b: Bender Medsystems, Burlingame, CA).

Western Blot
Brains were quickly removed at 24 hours after MCAO.
Samples were collected from the ischemic brain tissue.
Whole-cell lysates were obtained by homogenizing the
samples with a homogenizer in 5 volumes of buffer
(20 mmol/L of 4-(2hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, 1.5 mmol/L of MgCl2, 10 mmol/L of KCl,
1 mmol/L of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1 mmol/L
of ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 250 mmol/L of sucrose,
.1 mmol/L of phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/L
of dithiothreitol, and proteinase inhibitor cocktail tablets;
pH 7.9). Samples were further centrifuged at 750g for 15 minutes at 4 C to separate the sample into supernatant A and
pellet A. Supernatant A, containing the cytosolic/mitochondrial protein, was further centrifuged at 12,000g for
30 minutes at 4 C to separate supernatant B from pellet
B. Supernatant B was used as the cytosolic fraction and pellet B was used as the mitochondrial fraction after resuspension in buffer. The protein samples were separated on 10%
or 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (30 mg/lane) and then transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The
membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Trisbuffered saline containing 0.1% Triton 3-100 buffer and
then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at
4 C. The primary antibodies and their dilutions were as
follows: Bcl-2 and Bax (Santa Cruz Inc, 1:200); iNOS (Signal
Transduction, 1:1000); and b-actin (Abcam Inc, London,

UK; 1:5000). After being extensively rinsed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton 3-100 buffer, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (Santa
Cruz Inc, Santa Cruz, CA; 1:2000) for 1 hour at room temperature, and then the bar graph depicts the ratios of semiquantitative results obtained by scanning reactive bands
and quantifying the optical density using Videodensitometry (Bio-1D vers. 99 image software, Bio-Rad).

TUNEL Assay
A TUNEL assay was used to assess DNA damage. The
sections were treated as instructed with an in situ cell
death detection kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Diaminobenzidine (Sigma St. Louis, MO) was used as a chromogen. TUNEL-positive cells displayed brown staining
within the nucleus of apoptotic cells. DNA fragmentation
was quantified under high-power magnification (3400)
by an investigator who was blinded to the studies and
was expressed as number per square millimeter.

Statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as the means 6 standard deviation.
Statistical evaluation of the data was performed by an
analysis of variance. All assays were conducted in triplicate. A value of P less than .05 was considered statistically
significant.

Results
Physiological Parameters
There were no significant differences for these variables
(mean arterial blood pressure, arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure, arterial oxygen partial pressure, pH, rectal
temperature, and blood glucose) at baseline, during
MCAO and at reperfusion. These variables remained in
the normal range during the experimental period
observed (Table 1).

Effects of Pretreatment with GW0742 on Neurologic
Deficit and Infarction
To determine the neuroprotective effect of GW0742
against cerebral ischemic injury, we examined the neurologic deficit and infarct volume at 24 hours after MCAO.
No infarct and neurologic deficit was observed in the
sham group rats, in contrast, cerebral infarct volume
and NDSs in the vehicle group rats were significantly
higher (Fig 1A-C). As shown in Figure 1A-C, pretreatment with GW0742 decreased cerebral infarct volume
and ameliorated neurologic deficit induced by MCAO.

MCAO. Pretreatment with GW0742 significantly reduced
brain edema in comparison with the vehicle group rats.

Effect of Pretreatment with GW0742 on the Expressions
of NF-kB, TNF-a, and IL-1b
To investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of GW0742
on MCAO rats, we examined expressions of NF-kB,
TNF-a, and IL-1b in infarct cerebral hemisphere at
24 hours after MCAO. Table 2 shows that the expression
contents of NF-kB, TNF-a, and IL-1b in the vehicle group
were much higher than that in the sham-operated group.
Pretreatment with GW0742 significantly also brought
down increased expression contents of NF-kB, TNF-a,
and IL-1b of rats at 24 hours after MCAO.

in the vehicle group compared with the sham group.
And pretreatment with GW0742 reduced Bax expression,
whereas increased Bcl-2 expression.

Effect of Pretreatment with GW0742 on in Situ Labeling
of DNA Fragmentation
Cerebral apoptosis was determined by TUNEL
staining. In the TUNEL assay, a large number of
TUNEL-positive cells were observed in infarct cerebral
hemisphere of rats, whereas TUNEL-positive cells were
not detected in the sham group rats. The number of
TUNEL-positive cells was significantly reduced in the
pretreatment with the GW0742 group compared with
the vehicle group at 24 hours after MCAO (Fig 4).

PPAR-b/d plays an important role in acute ischemic
stroke. The mechanisms underlying the biological effects
induced by activation of PPAR-b/d are mediated through
a number of potential pathways. Ding et al21 found that
ligands of PPAR-b/d can lead to anti-inflammatory activities and interfere with NF-kB signaling. It is known from
the literature that NF-kB is activated in tissue ischemia
and reperfusion, which is a protein that acts as a switch
to turn inflammation on and off in the body. We also
found that NF-kB was significantly increased in rat at
24 hours after MCAO, which can exacerbate cerebral
injury induced by I/R. In the present study, we found
that pretreatment with GW0742 can significantly reduce
I/R-induced activation of cerebral NF-kB after reperfusion. NF-kB plays a central role in the regulation of

Discussion
In the present study, we first investigated the neuroprotective effect of GW0742 in a model for MCAO. Acute
ischemic stroke is a major cause of disability and death
in developed countries, and because of limited therapeutic strategies there is increasing interest in prophylactic
pharmacologic treatment.18 Inoue et al19 found resveratrol, a dual agonist for PPAR-a and PPAR-g, protects the
murine brain from stroke in a PPAR-a–dependent
manner. After that more studies found that PPAR-a agonists and PPAR-g ligands have neuroprotective effects
on brain ischemic injury. Recently, GW0742, specific and
potent PPAR-b/d agonist, exerts beneficial effects in animal models of I/R injury.5,20 In the present study, we
found that pretreatment with GW0742 significantly
reduced the infarct volumes, the NDSs, and cerebral
edema of rats submitted to MCAO compared with rats
in the vehicle group at 24 hours after MCAO. These
results suggest the neuroprotective effect of GW0742 in
MCAO model of rats.
The mechanisms underlying neuronal injury in acute
ischemic stroke are not yet well understood. However,
accumulating evidence demonstrated that postischemic
inflammation contributes to the development of neuronal
injury and cerebral infarction. It has been well known that

many genes responsible for the generation of mediators
or proteins in inflammation. These include the genes for
TNF-a, IL-1b, and iNOS.22 There is good evidence that
TNF-a and IL-1b, as proinflammatory cytokines,
contribute to pathogenesis, exacerbating I/R brain tissue
damage.23 We also found that TNF-a and IL-1b were
significantly increased in rat at 24 hours after MCAO.
Various studies have clearly reported that inhibition of
TNF-a formation significantly prevents the development
of the inflammatory process.24 Di et al found that
GW0742 can attenuate TNF-a and IL-1b production in
acute lung injury. In the present study, we found that
pretreatment with GW0742 can significantly reduce I/Rinduced production of cerebral TNF-a and IL-1b after reperfusion. It is clear that activation of TNF-a and IL-1b
can increase iNOS, cyclo-oxygenase-2, and various chemokine productions, which can raise brain tissue inflammation and destruction. High levels of NO production
generated by iNOS are an important mediator associated
with the cerebral damage during I/R injury. In the present
study, we found that the expression of iNOS was significantly increased in rat at 24 hours after MCAO and pretreatment with GW0742 can significantly bring down
the increased expression of iNOS. Therefore, the inhibi-

tion of the production of TNF-a, IL-1b, and iNOS by
GW0742 described in the present study is most likely
attributed to the inhibitory effect of activated NF-kB.25
It is now well known that apoptosis during I/R injury
plays a major role in brain injury associated with stroke.26
Recently, it has been demonstrated that the PPAR-b/d agonists possess potent antiapoptotic properties in vitro.27
Bax, a proapoptotic gene, plays an important role in central
nervous system injury, and Bcl-2 is the most expressed antiapoptotic molecule in adult central nervous system.28 The
ratio of proapoptotic to antiapoptotic molecules, such as
Bax/Bcl-2, determines the response to a death signal. In
the present study, we found that pretreatment with
GW0742 reduced Bax expression, whereas increased Bcl-2
expression. Our results also showed that the number of
TUNEL-positive cells was significantly reduced in the
ischemic brain tissue compared with that of the vehicle
group at 24 hours after MCAO by quantitative analysis.
Therefore, the antiapoptotic property of GW0742 might
contribute to a beneficial effect against acute ischemic stroke.

Conclusions
PPAR-b/d agonist GW0742 can protect neuronal damage induced by significant reduction in the infarct
volume, cerebral edema, and the NDSs of rat submitted
to MCAO by reducing inflammatory mediators and
apoptosis. Our results imply that PPAR-b/d agonist

injuries.
