Abstract Brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMVEC) injury induced by ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) is the initial phase
of blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, which results in a
poor prognosis for ischemic stroke patients. Autophagy occurs
in ischemic brain and has been shown to exhibit protective
effects on endothelial cell against stress. However, the potential
effects of BMVEC autophagy on BBB permeability during I/R
and the mechanisms underlying these effects have yet to be
elucidated. In the current study, we answered these questions
by using chemical modulators of autophagy, including
rapamycin and lithium carbonate acting, respectively, as
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent and
mTOR-independent autophagy inducers and 3-methyladenine
(3-MA) as an autophagy inhibitor. To mimic I/R injury,
BMVECs were exposed to oxygen–glucose deprivation/
reoxygenation (OGD/R), and a rat transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model was performed.
All the drugs were given at 0.5 h before OGD/R or MCAO/R.
First, enhancement of autophagy by rapamycin and lithium
carbonate attenuated, whereas suppression of autophagy by 3MA intensified BMVEC apoptosis and the high level of ROS
induced by OGD/R. In addition, rapamycin and lithium carbonate pretreatments significantly reversed the decreased level
of tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) induced by
Haiying Li and Anju Gao contributed equally to this work.

OGD/R and promoted the distribution of ZO-1 on cell membranes. Finally, pretreatments with rapamycin and lithium carbonate reduced evans blue extravasation and brain water content in the ischemic hemisphere of the rat. In contrast, 3-MA
pretreatment exerted opposite effects both in vitro and in vivo.
These results may indicate a beneficial effect of BMVEC
autophagy on BBB integrity during I/R injury.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke and its recanalization therapy provoke the
disruption of blood–brain barrier (BBB) and increased vascular permeability, which result in the development of brain
edema and a poor clinical outcome in ischemic stroke patients
[1]. As a barrier structure between the brain and blood vessel,
BBB is composed of endothelial cells, associated astrocytic
end-feet processes, perivascular neurons, and pericytes.
Among them, brain microvascular endothelial cells
(BMVECs) are connected by tight junctions that form an
almost impenetrable barrier and play a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the BBB [2, 3]. Because of its location
at the intraluminal surface of brain capillary, endothelial cell
represents an important site of signaling and injurious effects
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ischemia, inflammation,
and other pathological conditions [4]. Experimental studies
have demonstrated that, as a key event in oxidative stress
injury of BMVECs, redistribution and degradation of tight
junction proteins, such as zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), are the
initial phase of BBB opening, while BMVEC apoptosis induced by oxidative stress was suggested to disrupt the BBB
integrity, subsequently leading to brain edema [5, 6].

Transl. Stroke Res. (2014) 5:618–626

Therefore, protection of BMVEC against oxidative stress
induced by ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) may be potentially
beneficial for the prognosis of thrombolytic stroke therapy.
In recent years, there is a good amount of evidence that
moderate autophagy can protect endothelial cell against cell
injury under stressful circumstances [7, 8]. As a degradation
pathway essential for energy and cellular homoeostasis, autophagy primarily acts as a protective mechanism that may
prevent cell death [8] and plays a critical role in a range of
normal human physiological processes, while defective autophagy is associated with diverse diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancers [9]. As regulated by different signaling pathways, autophagy is divided into the mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent autophagy and mTORindependent autophagy that are amenable to chemical perturbations [10]. Several small molecules modulating autophagy,
including rapamycin and lithium carbonate, act, respectively, as
inducers of mTOR-dependent autophagy and mTORindependent autophagy, and 3-methyladenine (3-MA) acts as
an inhibitor of autophagy, have been used to identify the
potential therapeutic application of autophagy in diverse human central nervous system diseases. Previous studies in our
laboratory and others have shown that rapamycin was able to
attenuate BBB disruption in a rat model of subarachnoid hemorrhage [11, 12], while 3-MA exerted an opposite effect [11].
Moreover, previous studies have also described that rapamycin
and lithium carbonate could protect the integrity of the BBB in
rats exposed to epilepsy and traumatic brain injury, respectively
[13–15]. Evaluating the above studies, the protective potential
of autophagy in BBB integrity and brain damage is evident.
Furthermore, there was evidence that autophagy occurs in
ischemic brain [16] and both rapamycin and lithium could
effectively relieve the brain damage induced by I/R [17, 18].
However, whether autophagy inhibits BMVEC injury induced
by I/R and whether autophagy, especially BMVEC autophagy,
has beneficial effects on BBB integrity during I/R are unclear.
In the present study, we used rat BMVECs subjected to
oxygen–glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) and rats
exposed to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion/
reperfusion (MCAO/R) to determine the potential effects of
autophagy on BMVEC injury and BBB integrity under I/Rstimulating conditions by using chemical modulators of autophagy, including rapamycin, lithium carbonate, and 3-MA.
Our findings demonstrated that rapamycin and lithium carbonate effectively prevented OGD/R-evoked BMVEC injury
by induction of protective autophagy and that damage induced
by simulated I/R conditions was enhanced when autophagy
was blocked by 3-MA. Pretreatment with rapamycin and
lithium carbonate reduced brain water content and evans blue
extravasation in ischemic hemisphere of the rat exposed to
MCAO/R, while 3-MA exerted opposite effects. All the results indicated the potential protective effect of BMVEC
autophagy on the integrity of BBB during I/R.

Materials
DMEM/F-12 medium (12400-024) and fetal bovine serum
(FBS, 10437036) were purchased from Gibco. Rapamycin
(R0395), lithium carbonate (13010), 3-MA (M9281), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, D5879), sulforhodamine B (SRB,
S1402), hoechst 33258 (861405), and trichloroacetic acid
(TCA, T6399) were from Sigma-Aldrich. Antibodies against
LC3 (2775) and ZO-1 (5406) were from Cell Signaling Technology. The antibody specific to GAPDH (365062) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027, Santa
Cruz) was a negative control for immunofluorescence assay.
Alexa Fluor-488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (A21206)
was from Invitrogen. Tissue-Tek optimal cutting temperature
(OCT) embedding medium (4583) was from Sakura Finetek.

Methods
Animals
All experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of
the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University and were
in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of
Health on the care and use of animals. Newborn SpragueDawley (SD) rats (about 10 days old) and adult male SD rats
(250–300 g) were purchased from Animal Center of Chinese
Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. The rats were housed
in temperature- and humidity-controlled animal quarters with
a 12-h light/dark cycle.

Cell Culture
Rat BMVECs were isolated as described previously with
some modifications [19]. In brief, 10-day-old newborn SD
rats were sacrificed and soaked in 75 % ethanol for 5 min.
After opening the cranial cavity and removal of the meninge
and visible blood vessels, the cerebral mantle was divided and
minced into small tissue pieces (about 1 mm3). The tissue was
then digested stepwise with collagenase and dispase. By gradient centrifugation, BMVECs were obtained and cultured on
gelatin-coated plastic dishes in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 20 % FBS and 70-ng/ml basic fibroblast growth
factor. Cells were passaged on day 2.

In Vitro Application of OGD/R
To mimic I/R in vitro, BMVECs were exposed to OGD/R as
previously described [20]. Briefly, the cells were maintained
in low-serum (2 % FBS) and glucose-free medium in a

620

humidified incubator containing 95 % N2 and 5 % CO2 at
37 °C for 6 h. For reoxygenation with glucose reintroduction,
cells were again cultured in standard medium and placed in an
incubator containing 70 % N2, 25 % O2, and 5 % CO2 for 4 h.
Rat Model of Cerebral I/R
Eighty adult male SD rats were divided into five groups: sham
group, MCAO/R + vehicle group, MCAO/R + rapamycin
group, MCAO/R + lithium carbonate group, and
MCAO/R+3-MA group (n=16 per group). Following the
intraperitoneal anesthesia with chloral hydrate (36 mg/100-g
body weight), under an operating microscope, focal cerebral
ischemia was achieved by right-sided endovascular MCAO.
In brief, the right common, external, and internal carotid
arteries (CCA, ECA, ICA) were revealed via a midline cervical incision. Then, a piece of 4-0-monofilament nylon suture
with blunted tip coated with poly-lysine was inserted through
the right CCA and advanced it along the ICA until the tip
occluded the proximal stem of the middle cerebral artery
(MCA). Rectal temperature was maintained between 36.5
and 37.5 °C with a heating pad. After 2 h of ischemia, the
filament was withdrawn to allow reperfusion. At 22 h after
reperfusion, the brain tissue samples were obtained for assays.
Deaths (<5 %/group), typically occurring within 2 h of
MCAO, were attributable to anesthesia or surgery with no
stroke-related deaths encountered. At least six rats per group
finally entered brain water content analyses or evans blue
analyses, respectively.

neutral-buffered formaldehyde for 10 min, stained by hoechst
33258 (10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for
15 min, washed with PBS for three times, and then observed
by a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS BX50/BX-FLA/
DP70; Olympus Co., Japan). Normal cell nuclei are homogeneously stained blue, while the nuclei of apoptotic cells display chromatin condensation and/or nuclear fragmentation.
Apoptosis was assessed in ≥300 cells.

SRB Assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 6×104 cells/cm2
and treated with chemical modulators of autophagy at the
specified concentrations for indicated times. Cell viability
was evaluated by SRB assay [27]. Briefly, the medium
was poured off, and cells were fixed by cold 10 % TCA
(100 μl/well) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and then, the plate was washed with
double-distilled water for five times and dried, then 0.4 %
(w/v) SRB solution (50 μl/well) in 1 % acetic acid was
added and shaken for 5 min on a microtiter plate shaker.
Plate was washed with 1 % acetic acid for five times and
dried. Then, 10-mM unbuffered Tris base (pH 10.5,
100 μl/well) was added to the plate and shaken for
5 min to dissolve the dye. Finally, the absorbance was
measured at 540-nm wavelength using a multifunctional
enzyme mark (FilterMax F5, Molecular Devices).
Western Blot Analysis

Drug Administration
Rapamycin was dissolved in DMSO at the stock concentration of 0.01 M, while lithium carbonate and 3-MA were
dissolved in double-distilled water at the stock concentrations
of 0.01 and 0.25 M, respectively. As described previously [21,
22], rapamycin (2 μM), lithium carbonate (300 μM) and 3MA (10 mM) were given at 0.5 h before OGD/R. The final
concentration of DMSO was below 0.1 % (v/v) in culture
medium so that the cell viability would not be affected [23].
In addition, rapamycin (150 μg/kg), lithium carbonate
(20 mg/kg), and 3-MA (0.15 mg/kg) were injected via the tail
vein at 0.5 h before MCAO/R. The doses were chosen according to previous reports [24, 25] since they observed
beneficial effects in models of cerebral ischemia, spinal cord
injury, and subarachnoid hemorrhage using the same doses.
Hoechst 33258 Staining
Cell apoptosis was observed by hoechst 33258 staining [26].
Briefly, after treatments as indicated, cells were fixed with 4 %

Protein samples (20 μg/lane) were loaded on a 15 % SDSpolyacrylamide gel, separated, and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (IPVH00010,
Millipore), which was probed with primary antibodies, then
horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies, and revealed with use of an enhanced chemiluminesence detection
kit. The relative quantity of proteins was analyzed based on
densitometry analysis by use of ImageJ program and normalized to that of loading controls.
Immunostaining of Cells
BMVECs were fixed in 4 % neutral-buffered formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and blocked in 5 %
goat serum (v/v) for 30 min, then incubated with ZO-1
antibody overnight at 4 °C. Then, cells were washed with
PBS for three times and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488
donkey anti-rabbit at 37 °C for 1 h. Normal rabbit IgG
was used as a negative control for the immunofluorescence assay (data not shown). The fluorescence images
were captured using a fluorescence microscope

(OLYMPUS BX50/BX-FLA/DP70; Olympus Co., Japan).
The fluorescence intensity was measured by use of
ImageJ program. Briefly, the regions of interest were
selected by using the selection tools, and corresponding
integrated densities and areas were obtain from the analyzed menu. In the same way, regions next to the regions
of interest that have no fluorescence were selected, and
then, the mean fluorescence of background was calculated. Finally, fluorescent intensity per cell was obtained by
the formula below: Fluorescent intensity per cell = [integrated density–(area of selected region × mean fluorescence of background)] / cell number in selected region. At
least 200 cells were imaged and scored per group.

colorless. The same region as the brain water content assay
was quickly embedded in OCT embedding medium, and then,
7-μm-thick cryosections were cut. Subsequently, the sections
were coverslipped with a water-based mounting medium and
captured by a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS
BX50/BX-FLA/DP70; Olympus Co., Japan). Finally, the residual brain tissues were removed and homogenized in icecold PBS. Trichloroacetic acid was then added to precipitate
protein, and the samples were cooled and centrifuged. The
resulting supernatant was measured for absorbance of evans
blue at 610 nm using a spectrophotometer.

In Vitro ROS Assay

Data are expressed as mean±SEM. SPSS 11.5 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis. Data were
analyzed by one-way ANOVA (followed by Scheffé F test
for post hoc analysis). p<0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Cells were plated on 24-well plates, and the intracellular
ROS was measured spectrofluorometrically by the Cellular ROS Detection Assay Kit (139473, abcam) following
the manufacturer’s protocol. The fluorescence images
were captured using a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS BX50/BX-FLA/DP70; Olympus Co., Japan) with
excitation and emission at 485 and 530 nm, respectively,
and the fluorescence intensity was measured by use of
ImageJ program.

Brain Water Content
After the indicated treatments, rats were deeply anesthetized
with urethane (1,000 mg/kg) and decapitated. The brain was
removed quickly and frozen in a stainless steel brain matrices
(−20 °C) for 10 min. The brain was subsequently sectioned
coronally into 2-mm thick slices starting from the frontal pole.
The third brain slice from the frontal pole was separated into
left hemisphere and right hemisphere, and right hemisphere
(ischemic hemisphere) was obtained for brain water content
assay as previously described [11]. Briefly, after collected, the
tissues were weighed immediately (wet weight), dried in
100 °C for 72 h, and then weighed (dry weight). The percentage of water content was calculated as [(wet weight–dry
weight) / wet weight]×100 %.

Results
Effects of Rapamycin, Lithium Carbonate, and 3-MA
on BMVEC Autophagy under OGD/R Conditions
To elucidate the effect of OGD/R stimulation on BMVEC
autophagy and whether chemical modulators of autophagy
still could regulate BMVEC autophagy under OGD/R condition, we assessed the protein level of autophagy marker LC3
by Western blot (Fig. 1). The results revealed increases in the
protein level of LC3-II and LC3-I conversion in OGD/R
group. In addition, the protein levels of LC3-II and LC3-I
conversion were further enhanced by rapamycin and lithium
carbonate pretreatments under OGD/R condition, while 3-MA
pretreatment had an opposite effect, indicating that rapamycin
and lithium carbonate still could act as autophagy inducers
and 3-MA as an autophagy inhibitor in BMVECs under OGD/
R condition.

BBB disruption was evaluated by evans blue staining [28, 11].
After the indicated treatments, evans blue in saline (2 %, 3 ml/

60 min, mice were deeply anesthetized with urethane
(1,000 mg/kg) and killed by transcardially perfused with icecold PBS until the fluid coming from the right atrium is

To detect the effects of these chemical modulators of
autophagy on cell apoptosis and viability of BMVECs,
we performed hoechst 33258 staining and SRB assay
(Fig. 2). Compared with the normal group, cells
exhibiting apoptotic characteristics such as chromatin
condensation and nuclear fragmentation were significantly
increased in the OGD/R group, which was remarkably

Effects of Rapamycin, Lithium Carbonate, and 3-MA
on the Protein level and Distribution of ZO-1 in BMVECs
Under OGD/R Conditions
To test the potential effects of these chemical modulators of
autophagy on BBB integrity, immunofluorescence staining
and Western blot were performed to evaluate the protein level
and distribution of tight junction protein ZO-1 (Fig. 3). In the
normal group, ZO-1 was distributed mainly on cell membranes, while an overall reduction in fluorescence intensity
and disruption of ZO-1 staining were observed in OGD/R
group. Consistently, Western blot showed that the protein
level of ZO-1 was significantly lower in OGD/R group compared to normal groups. In addition, the results also showed
that pretreatments of BMVECs with rapamycin and lithium
carbonate attenuated the decrease protein level of ZO-1 induced by OGD/R and promoted the distribution of ZO-1 on
cell membranes.

Effects of Rapamycin, Lithium Carbonate, and 3-MA on ROS
Production in BMVECs Induced by OGD/R
As BMVEC injury induced by oxidative stress during I/R
is a critical factor leading to BBB dysfunction, we then
tested the effects of rapamycin, lithium carbonate, and 3MA on the intracellular ROS level of BMVECs under
OGD/R conditions (Fig. 4). As shown in the fluorescence
imaging, ROS production was significantly increased in
OGD/R group, as compared with the normal group. Further quantification showed that pretreatment with autophagy inducers rapamycin and lithium carbonate decreased
the ROS production induced by OGD/R. For 3-MA administration, the mean values of ROS level had no significant difference between OGD/R control group and
OGD/R+3-MA group.
Collectively, rapamycin and lithium carbonate induced
protective autophagy in BMVECs exposed to OGD/R.
However, whether rapamycin and lithium carbonate have
beneficial effects and whether rapamycin and lithium
carbonate protect BBB integrity in vivo are unknown.

Effects of Rapamycin, Lithium Carbonate, and 3-MA
on the BBB Permeability in a Rat I/R Model
To evaluate the influences of the chemical modulators of
autophagy on the permeability of BBB during I/R injury
in vivo, a rat model of cerebral I/R caused by MCAO was
performed. Then, the permeability of BBB was revealed
by evans blue staining. As shown in Fig. 5a, evans blue
was restricted to blood vessels in the sham group. In the
MCAO/R group, diffuse red fluorescence intensity was

623

detected in the brain parenchyma as well as vessels,
indicating the vascular leakage of evans blue, which was
inhibited by rapamycin and lithium carbonate pretreatments. By contrast, pretreatment with 3-MA resulted in
more intense red fluorescence from the brain parenchyma,
while the signal from blood vessels was reduced. In line
with the results described above, the quantitative analysis
of evans blue content indicated that rapamycin and lithium carbonate pretreatments attenuated the increase in
evans blue content induced by cerebral I/R, which was
further strengthened by 3-MA pretreatment (Fig. 5b, n=6
per group).
Effects of rapamycin, lithium carbonate, and 3-MA on
brain edema in a rat I/R model. To assess brain edema,
brain water content assay was performed (Fig. 6). Significant increase in brain water content was detected in
MCAO/R group compared with sham group. The mean
value of brain water content was decreased by rapamycin
and lithium carbonate pretreatments and increased by 3MA pretreatment. The results suggested that rapamycin
and lithium carbonate pretreatments could attenuate brain
edema in this rat I/R model.

Discussion
Although there is accumulating evidence that moderate autophagy can protect endothelial cell against cell injury under
stressful circumstances and autophagy plays a neuroprotection
role against I/R injury, this is the first study that specifically
confirmed the protection effect of BMVEC autophagy on
BBB integrity following brain I/R.
A recent study reported that rapamycin effectively
prevented human umbilical vein endothelial cell
(HUVEC) damage induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation via induction of protective autophagy in an mTORdependent manner [29]. This study reinforces the previous
conclusions, as we found that rapamycin could inhibit
BMVEC apoptosis induced by OGD/R and protect BBB
integrity following brain I/R in vivo. Notably, in this
study, we found that, as an mTOR-independent autophagy
inducer, lithium carbonate also could ameliorate BMVEC
injury and BBB disruption induced by I/R stimulation.
This finding contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of BMVEC autophagy on BBB
integrity. In addition, inasmuch as microvascular endothelial cells differ in a variety of ways from large vessel
endothelial cells [30], BMVECs uesd in this study are
more suitable than HUVECs for the research of BBB.
In this study, we monitored autophagy by measurement
of the protein level of autophagosome mark LC3 and the
conversion of cytoplasmic form of LC3 (LC3-I) to

phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated form (LC3-II),
which is necessary for autophagosome form [31]. As
describe above, the modest increases in LC3-II and the
conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in OGD/R group are similar to that observed when autophagy was induced. However, impaired autophagic flux caused by failure of
autophagosome-lysosome fusion may also result in increases in the number of autophagosomes, as observed
by the increase in LC3-II in several diseases [9, 32]. In
addition, it has been reported that stimulation of autophagy could only be beneficial if autophagic flux was intact,
while impaired autophagic flux could lead to ejection of
autophagosomes or lysosomal leakage, as well as cell
death [2]. As we have found that the protein level of
LC3-II was increased in OGD/R group with increasing
cell apoptosis and ROS production, autophagic flux may

be impaired in OGD/R group, but this needs further
elucidation.
As reported previously [33], there exists negative feedback
regulation to maintain the dynamic balance of ROS production and removal at the tissue level. Increased ROS levels
could activate the negative feedback loop that downregulates
the inducing enzymes (less production of ROS) and
upregulates the antioxidant enzymes (increased removal of
ROS) thereby limiting subsequent higher levels of ROS production. This view can readily explain our result that ROS
levels were not significantly different between OGD/R groups
(Fig. 4).
In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that
upregulation of BMVEC autophagy has the potential to maintain BBB integrity after I/R mediated by decreasing ROS
production and increasing the expression of tight junctional
protein ZO-1.
