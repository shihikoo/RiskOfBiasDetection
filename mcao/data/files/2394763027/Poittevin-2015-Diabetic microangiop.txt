BBB permeability (extravasation of Evans blue) at D1. At
D7, CD31+/Ki67+ double-immunolabeled cells and
VEGFa and Ang2 expression were signiﬁcantly increased, indicating delayed angiogenesis. We show that
cerebral microangiopathy thus partly explains stroke

Diabetes is an independent risk factor for stroke, tripling
its incidence and affecting stroke severity (1) and related
mortality (2). Although stroke is classically considered as
a macrovascular complication of diabetes due to accelerated atherosclerosis and carotid artery disease, there is
increasing evidence that microvasculature of the brain is
also severely affected in diabetic patients. Indeed, in
addition to diffuse brain atrophy, leukoaraiosis, microbleeds, and asymptomatic lacunar infarcts (,15 mm in
diameter, often multiple) have been reported on brain
MRI or in postmortem studies (1). Moreover, the prevalence and severity of other microvascular diabetes complications, such as retinopathy and proteinuria, are
correlated with increased stroke risk (1). Functional

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Diabetes increases the risk of stroke by three, increases
related mortality, and delays recovery. We aimed to
characterize functional and structural alterations in
cerebral microvasculature before and after experimental cerebral ischemia in a mouse model of type 1
diabetes. We hypothesized that preexisting brain microvascular disease in patients with diabetes might partly
explain increased stroke severity and impact on outcome. Diabetes was induced in 4-week-old C57Bl/6J
mice by intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (60
mg/kg). After 8 weeks of diabetes, the vasoreactivity of
the neurovascular network to CO2 was abolished and
was not reversed by nitric oxide (NO) donor administration; endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and neuronal
NO synthase (nNOS) mRNA, phospho-eNOS protein,
nNOS, and phospho-nNOS protein were signiﬁcantly
decreased; angiogenic and vessel maturation factors
(vascular endothelial growth factor a [VEGFa], angiopoietin 1 (Ang1), Ang2, transforming growth factor-b
[TGF-b], and platelet-derived growth factor-b [PDGFb]) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) occludin and zona
occludens 1 (ZO-1) expression were signiﬁcantly decreased; and microvessel density was increased without changes in ultrastructural imaging. After permanent
focal cerebral ischemia induction, infarct volume and

Diabetic Cerebral Microangiopathy

cerebral microcirculation such as decreased baseline regional cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) and impaired vasoreactivity to CO2 have been shown in diabetic patients (3).
Yet, vessel diameter is a key determinant of stroke extension. Under normal physiological conditions, vessel diameter is regulated by several pathways that ensure
sufﬁcient blood ﬂow. After cerebral artery occlusion, the
consecutive drop in local CBF is compensated for by collateral artery recruitment and vasodilation, which limit
lesion extension, a phenomenon mediated by nitric oxide
(NO) (4,5). Later on, angiogenesis initiated during the
ﬁrst 3 days after brain injury participates in brain recovery by triggering neurogenesis and the migration of neural progenitors to the infarct (6).
The superimposition of a secondary injury on preexisting cerebral microvascular disease could have
deep effects on neurological function. However, the
microvascular “response” during the acute and subacute
phases of stroke in patients with diabetes remains
unstudied.
Our working hypothesis is that chronic hyperglycemia
will result in dysfunctional cerebral microcirculation that
in turn will contribute to enhance brain injury after focal
cerebral ischemia, during the acute phase by compromising local collateral artery recruitment, an important step
in tissue preservation, and during the subacute phase by
compromising angiogenesis, an important step in brain
repair. We ﬁrst characterized functional and structural
alterations in cerebral microvasculature in an experimental model of type 1 diabetes induced by streptozotocin
(STZ) in adult male C57Bl/6J mice, and then evaluated
the effects of experimental focal cerebral ischemia by
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo) 1
day and 1 week after stroke.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

All experiments using animals were performed according
to National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for the
care and use of laboratory animals (B 75-10-03). The
study was speciﬁcally approved by our local institutional
ethics committee (CEEALV/2012-05-01). All experiments
were performed by investigators blind to the diabetes
status of mice.
Animals and Diabetes Induction

Male C57Bl/6J mice (JANVIER LABS, Le Genest-SaintIsle, France) aged 4 weeks with a mean body weight of
18–20 g were divided into two groups: one group received ﬁve consecutive daily intraperitoneal injections
of STZ (60 mg/kg in 100 mL of citrate buffer) to induce
diabetes, and the nondiabetic group received only buffer
citrate. Glycemia was tested weekly for 8 weeks. Mice
with sustained hyperglycemia (.300 mg/dL) were considered to be diabetic.

functional and structural impairment of microcirculation
in chronic diabetic mice before cerebral ischemia. A) We
measured vasoreactivity to CO2 and NO, characterized the
expression of NO synthases and brain factors involved in
vessel regulation using PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry, and performed transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) of cerebral capillaries and arterioles.
Brain MRI was performed before cerebral ischemia in
order to detect asymptomatic microvascular lesions.
Next, we studied the impact of diabetic microangiopathy
on stroke damage and cerebral repair. B) We evaluated
infarct volume (cresyl violet staining and brain MRI), neurological deﬁcit, and angiogenesis at D1 and D7. Bloodbrain barrier (BBB) protein modiﬁcation was measured at
D1 (Fig. 1).
Physiological Parameters

Systolic blood pressure was measured in unanesthetized
mice by the tail-cuff method (Kent Scientiﬁc Corporation, Torrington, CT) after daily acclimatization for 2
weeks.
Doppler Imaging of Vasoreactivity to Inhaled CO2

Thermoregulated mice were subjected to ultrasound
measurements under 0.5% isoﬂurane anesthesia using
an echocardiograph (Acuson S 3000, Erlangen, Germany)
equipped with a 14-MHz linear transducer (14L5 SP) as
previously reported (4). Heart rate, peak systolic, enddiastolic, and time-averaged mean blood ﬂow velocities
(mBFVs) were measured in the basilar trunk (BT) before
cerebral ischemia 1) under air (all mice), 2) 5 min after
starting to breathe a gas mixture of 16% O2, 5% CO2, and
79% N2 (n = 7–10), or 3) 5 min after administration of an
NO donor (NONOate; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) (n =
4–5) (1 mg/kg, i.p.), in order to discriminate between
endothelial and smooth muscle cell (SMC) dysfunction.
Indeed, vasodilation is reestablished by the NO donor if
endothelium only is dysfunctional. Vasoreactivity was
estimated for each mouse as the percentage increase in
mBFV recorded under gas mixture or NONOate compared
with mBFV recorded under normoxic air; acidosis and
hypercapnia were assessed by blood gas measurements.
Real-time PCR Analysis of mRNAs for NO Synthase
Isoforms, Factors Regulating Cerebral Vessel and
BBB Components

The procedure was performed as previously described (n =
5–8) (7) using custom-designed primers for all genes of
interest (Table 1) and a ready-to-use primer for the housekeeping gene peptidylprolyl isomerase A (cyclophilin A)
(Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). We normalized the results
for each gene to cyclophilin A levels. Results are expressed
as arbitrary units (AU).

and equal amounts of proteins (40 mg) were resolved by
SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and immunoblotted using the
antibodies indicated in Table 1. Blots were scanned and
analyzed using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD).
Permanent Focal Cerebral Ischemia by pMCAo and
Infarct Volume Assessment

In brief, as previously described (7), thermoregulated
(37 6 0.5°C) and anesthetized (2% isoﬂurane in air)
mice were subjected to left middle cerebral artery electrocoagulation (pMCAo) using bipolar forceps. The overall
mortality was ,5% in 24 h. Cortical infarct volume was
evaluated on cresyl-violet–stained sections (every eighth
30-mm-thick coronal section) using NIH ImageJ (n = 5–9).
Assessment of Neurological Deﬁcit

Neurological deﬁcit was assessed 24 h after pMCAo, based
on ﬁve neurological tests (neurological score, grip and
string tests, beam walking, and the pole test), and used to
calculate a global neurological score (/21) (n = 7–9). The
lower the neurological score, the more severe the deﬁcit (8).
Evaluation of BBB Permeability

A 2% solution of Evans blue dye (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) in PBS was administered through the tail vein of
mice (4 mL/kg) 24 h after stroke (n = 5–6). Two hours
later, animals were transcardially perfused under isoﬂurane anesthesia, with 20 mL of 1% heparinized saline,

until a colorless perfusion ﬂuid was obtained. Each hemisphere was placed separately in 2 mL formamide and
allowed to soak for 72 h at room temperature. The absorbance of the supernatant solution was measured against
a pure formamide standard at 625 nm using a spectrophotometer. The tissue was then dried in the oven at 95°C for
5 days (6), and relative absorbance measured (units/g dry
weight). Results are expressed as the percentage of the
value measured in nondiabetic mice (100%).
Immunohistochemistry and Morphological Analysis

Coronal 30-mm-thick ﬂoating sections were incubated
with primary antibody overnight at 4°C; anti-Ki67
(1:200; Thermo Scientiﬁc, Fremont, CA) and anti-CD31
(1:200; BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) were used to detect
proliferating cells and endothelial cells, respectively, and
double immunolabeling to detect angiogenesis (n = 5–6).
Appropriate Alexa Fluor 594 or 488–labeled secondary
antibodies (1:400; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were
applied for 1 h at room temperature. Speciﬁcity was
checked by omitting the primary antibody. Cell counts
and microvessel density measurements were performed at
three coronal brain levels (+0.80, 20.80, and 21.20 mm
relative to bregma) that consistently contained the infarct
area. Angiogenesis was assessed in three regions of interest
(ROIs; 0.06 mm2 each) located in the peri-infarct area, and
expressed as the average number of Ki67+/CD31+ cells per

immunolabeling by calculating the integrated pixel density
of the images using NIH ImageJ. The average integrated
pixel density of one ﬁeld of view (203) located in the periinfarct area was used for analysis.
TEM

Mice (n = 4) were transcardially perfused for 12 min with
a ﬁxative containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, and 2 mmol/L CaCl2 in 0.1 mol/L cacodylate
buffer (CB), pH 7.4, at room temperature (n = 4). Brains
were removed, and 1-mm3 brain fragments were postﬁxed
in the same ﬁxative for 1 h at 4°C, extensively washed in
CB, and ﬁxed in 1% OsO4 in CB for 45 min at 4°C. After
washing in CB, samples were ﬁxed in 1% aqueous uranyl
acetate and ﬁnally rinsed in water. After dehydration in
graded ethanol, followed by propylene oxide, the fragments were embedded in epon. Ultrathin (80 nm) sections were prepared, stained with lead citrate, and
photographed with a Jeol S100 TEM equipped with
a 2kx2k Orius 200-830 camera (Gatan-Roper Scientiﬁc,
Evry, France).
MRI

Brain MRI was performed before and at D1 and D7 after
cerebral ischemia, in order to detect pre- and poststroke
(secondary hemorrhagic transformation) hemorrhages in
the mouse brain. All MR examinations were performed
using a 7.0 Tesla MR unit (PharmaScan; Bruker Biospin,
Ettlingen, Germany) equipped with a surface coil with an
internal diameter of 10 mm, in thermoregulated and
anesthetized (0.8–1% isoﬂurane in O2 30%/N2O 70%)
mice (n = 5–6). Infarct volume was measured on T2weighted images according to the RARE sequence type
parameters; TR = 6,475.1 ms; TE = 8,894 ms; effective TE =
53.36 ms; ﬁeld of view = 20 3 20 mm; matrix = 128 3 128;

slice thickness = 0.5 mm (0.156 3 0.156 = voxel 3
0.5 mm3); ﬂip angle = 180°; RARE factor = 16; and number of averages = 2. Maximal gradient slope was 300 mT/m.
Gradient-echo T2-weighted images (T2-star) were obtained
to evaluate the presence of hemorrhagic spots with the
following parameters: TR = 260 ms; TE = 6 ms; ﬁeld of
view = 20 3 20 mm; matrix = 256 3 256; slice thickness =
0.75 mm; ﬂip angle = 55°; and number of averages = 2. The
brain of each mouse was imaged before and after an intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 mmol/kg gadopentetate
dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA; Magnevist; Berlex Laboratories,
Wayne, NJ) with a ﬁnal set of postcontrast T1-weighted
images with the following parameters: spin-echo sequence;
TE = 10 ms; TR = 500 ms; FOV = 20 3 20 mm; matrix =
256 3 256; 12 slices; slice thickness = 0.75 mm; and total
imaging time = 2 min.
Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed with Prism 5 software
(Prism 5.03; GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Data are expressed as mean 6 SD. Comparisons between nondiabetic
and diabetic mouse groups were carried out using the
nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. A P value of ,0.05
was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
RESULTS

Mean blood glucose concentration (424 6 54 vs. 161 6
10 mg/dL; P , 0.001) was signiﬁcantly increased and
body weight (23.7 6 1.1 vs. 21.08 6 2.4 g, P = 0.003)
signiﬁcantly decreased in diabetic mice compared with
nondiabetic mice. At 12 weeks, systolic, diastolic, and
mean arterial pressures were not signiﬁcantly different
between groups. Blood gas after CO2 inhalation showed
signiﬁcant acidosis and normoxic hypercapnia in both
groups compared with measurements under air (Table 2).

A) Functional and Structural Impairment of
Microcirculation in Chronic Diabetic Mice Before
Experimental Ischemia
CO2 and NO Donor–Mediated Vasoreactivity Are
Impaired in Diabetic Mice

Inhalation of a CO2 gas mixture resulted in signiﬁcant
hypercapnia (P = 0.017) and acidosis (P = 0.006) in diabetic and nondiabetic mice (Table 2); mBFV in the BT
was not signiﬁcantly modiﬁed after CO2 inhalation in diabetic mice (air 100 6 14.5% vs. CO2 98.8 6 11.9%; P =
1), whereas mBFV in the BT was signiﬁcantly increased in
nondiabetic mice (air 100 6 6.4% vs. CO2 124.2 6
24.2%; P = 0.0004) (Fig. 2A). After NO donor injection,
the BT mBFV of diabetic mice was not signiﬁcantly modiﬁed (air 100 6 13.8% vs. NO 90.2 6 17.4%; P = 0.2),
whereas it was signiﬁcantly increased in nondiabetic mice
(air 100 6 6.2% vs. NO 122.6 6 8.7%; P = 0.0009) (Fig. 2B).
Diabetes Alters NO Synthase Isoforms

There was a signiﬁcant decrease in endothelial NO synthase
(eNOS) mRNA (0.63 6 0.4 vs. 1.44 6 0.7 AU; P = 0.04)
and phospho-eNOS protein expression (0.59 6 0.32 vs.
1 6 0.10 AU; P = 0.02) in diabetic compared with nondiabetic mice, although eNOS protein levels were not signiﬁcantly different (0.99 6 0.1 vs. 1 6 0.21 AU; P = 1)
(Fig. 3A). The mRNA for neuronal NO synthase (nNOS)
(0.59 6 0.37 vs. 1.32 6 0.61 AU; P = 0.03) and protein
levels of nNOS (0.92 6 0.06 vs. 1 6 0.04 AU; P = 0.05)
and phospho-nNOS (0.36 6 0.26 vs. 1 6 0.12 AU; P =
0.002) were signiﬁcantly decreased in diabetic compared
with nondiabetic mice (Fig. 3B).
Alteration of BBB Protein Expression in Diabetic Mice
Without Ultrastructural or Brain MRI Modiﬁcations

mRNA for the adherens junction molecule vascular
endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) was signiﬁcantly
decreased (0.71 6 0.49 vs. 1.39 6 0.61 AU; P = 0.03)
in diabetic compared with nondiabetic mice, whereas
VE-cadherin protein levels (1.75 6 0.24 vs. 1.89 6
0.44 AU; P = 0.5) remained unchanged. There was a signiﬁcant decrease in mRNA (0.41 6 0.18 vs. 0.94 6 0.31
AU; P = 0.001) and protein levels (0.19 6 0.03 vs.

0.27 6 0.05 AU; P = 0.01) of the tight junction protein
zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) in diabetic compared with nondiabetic mice (Fig. 4A). However, TEM did not show any
modiﬁcation of tight junction structure in the microvessels of diabetic mice (Fig. 4B). Brain MRI did not show
any hemorrhages or gadolinium enhancement (data not
shown).
Alteration of Factors Regulating Vessel Expression in
Diabetic Mice

Cortical microvessel density was increased (mean gray
surface value: 21.5 6 0.9 vs. 15.61 6 1.81 AU; P = 0.02)
in diabetic versus nondiabetic mice. Vascular endothelial
growth factor a (VEGFa) mRNA (0.56 6 0.29 vs. 1.01 6
0.39 AU; P = 0.02) and protein expression (0.51 6 0.09
vs. 1.0 6 0.36 AU; P = 0.05) were signiﬁcantly decreased
in diabetic compared with nondiabetic mice; angiopoietin
2 (Ang2) mRNA (0.24 6 0.13 vs. 0.32 6 0.14 AU; P =
0.3) was not signiﬁcantly modiﬁed, although Ang2 protein levels were decreased (0.56 6 0.21 vs. 1 6 0.18 AU;
P = 0.001) (Fig. 4C). In addition, mRNAs for Ang1 (0.48 6
0.33 vs. 0.88 6 0.39 AU; P = 0.05), transforming growth
factor-b (TGF-b) (0.77 6 0.19 vs. 1.25 6 0.43 AU; P =
0.02), and platelet-derived growth factor-b (PDGF-b)
(0.41 6 0.16 vs. 0.80 6 0.24 AU; P = 0.003) were significantly decreased in diabetic compared with nondiabetic
mice.
B) Impact of Diabetic Microangiopathy on Stroke
Damage and Cerebral Repair
Diabetes Worsens Infarct Volume and Neurological
Deﬁcit at D1 and D7 After Cerebral Ischemia

Infarct volumes were signiﬁcantly larger in diabetic
compared with nondiabetic mice at D1 (17.72 6 2.82
vs. 14.02 6 0.99 mm3; P = 0.03) and D7 (14.24 6 4.50
vs. 2.84 6 0.50 mm3; P = 0.04) (Fig. 5A and B). The
neurological score (/21) was signiﬁcantly worse at D1
(13 6 3 vs. 18 6 2; P , 0.001) and D7 (11 6 5 vs.
19 6 1; P = 0.008) in diabetic compared with nondiabetic
mice, which did not show any neurological deﬁcit (Fig.
5C). No hemorrhagic transformation or suffusion of blood
was visible on brain MRI at either time point (Fig. 5D).

Diabetes Worsens BBB Permeability at D1

Evans blue extravasation was increased in diabetic (114 6
9%) compared with nondiabetic mice (100 6 4%; P =
0.02) (Fig. 6A). ZO-1 (0.12 6 0.02 vs. 0.16 6 0.04 AU;
P = 0.03) and VE-cadherin protein levels (1.16 6 0.21 vs.
1.87 6 0.32 AU; P = 0.03) were signiﬁcantly decreased in
diabetic compared with nondiabetic mice (Fig. 6B).
Diabetes Delays Angiogenesis

At D1, endothelial cell proliferation (36 6 11 vs. 46 6 11;
P = 0.2) was not signiﬁcantly different between diabetic
and nondiabetic mice. Similar to prestroke conditions,
VEGFa, TGF-b, and PDGF-b mRNA levels at D1 were
lower in diabetic compared with nondiabetic mice (data
not shown). In contrast, at D7, there was a signiﬁcant
increase in endothelial cell proliferation (16 6 3 vs.
11 6 4 cells/ROI; P = 0.05) and a signiﬁcant increase in
VEGFa mRNA (0.67 6 0.20 vs. 0.42 6 0.12 AU; P = 0.03)
and protein (0.89 6 0.49 vs. 0.37 6 0.13 AU; P = 0.05),
and Ang2 mRNA (0.96 6 0.67 vs. 0.36 6 0.11 AU; P =
0.05) and protein levels (1.91 6 0.81 vs. 4.0 6 1.66 AU;

DISCUSSION

The current study, performed in mice with STZ-induced
type 1 diabetes, shows that cerebral microcirculation is
affected after 8 weeks of hyperglycemia; vasoreactivity to
inhaled CO2 is abolished and not reversed by NO donor
administration, whereas mRNA and protein levels of
phospho-eNOS, nNOS, and phospho-nNOS are decreased,
suggesting smooth muscle and endothelial cell dysfunction. In addition, microvessel density is increased,
whereas the downregulation of BBB proteins and the pattern of angiogenic factor expression suggest an immature
vascular network. After the induction of experimental
cerebral ischemia, infarct volume, neurological deﬁcit,
and BBB permeability are signiﬁcantly increased and angiogenesis, which is important for brain repair process, is
delayed. Taken together, these ﬁndings could explain the
greater damage during the acute phase of stroke and
delayed brain repair in these mice.
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to reproduce
impaired cerebral vasoreactivity after CO2 inhalation in

diabetic mice, facilitating the extrapolation of our methodology and results to humans. Our diabetic mice did not
exhibit cerebral vasodilation after CO2 inhalation or
NONOate injection, suggesting an SMC dysfunction.
SMC alterations have already been reported in diabetes
(9) and might be explained by primary reduced NO bioavailability or direct cell toxicity by increased production
of reactive oxygen species and peroxynitrite. NO is the
main vasodilator involved in the increased CBF induced
by experimental hypercapnia in normal brains, since cerebral vasoreactivity is suppressed by NOS inhibitors and
reversed by NO agonists (10). NO is produced in the brain
by endothelial cells (eNOS) and neurons (nNOS) (11).

However, the data concerning their involvement are conﬂicting (12–15). Although endothelial dysfunction in the
cerebral arteries of patients with diabetes is generally accepted (16), there is no modiﬁcation of eNOS protein
level in STZ-induced diabetic rats (17), downregulation
in high-fat diet–induced diabetic mice (18), or upregulation in obese diabetic Zucker rats (19). Upregulation was
unevenly interpreted as a compensatory mechanism to
maintain acceptable NO levels. In our model, although
there was no modiﬁcation in eNOS protein levels, we
did observe a decrease in the enzymatically active phosphorylated form of the protein (20). Since the endothelial
production of NO requires the phosphorylation of speciﬁc

Figure 5—Diabetes leads to a larger infarct volume (A and B) and a more severe neurological deﬁcit (C) at D1 and D7 (n = 5–9). D: Brain MRI

eNOS residues by protein kinase B or Akt and since
insulin-mediated Akt phosphorylation is impaired in
diabetic mice, we can speculate that this might be
responsible for the downregulation of eNOS in the brain
of diabetic mice. Consistent with these results, mice with
the phosphomimetic “SD” mutation of eNOS display reduced infarct size and neurological deﬁcit after MCAo
compared with eNOS mice with the unphosphorylatable
“SA” mutation (21). The expression of nNOS, whose enzymatic activity similarly depends on its phosphorylation
(22), is decreased (17) or unchanged (19) in STZ-induced
diabetic rats. We therefore also systematically investigated nNOS phosphorylation in the brain of diabetic
mice and demonstrate, to our knowledge for the ﬁrst
time, that both eNOS mRNA and phospho-eNOS protein
as well as nNOS mRNA and nNOS and phospho-nNOS
protein levels are decreased in diabetic mice, suggesting
that a downregulation of both NOS isoforms may contribute to impaired CBF regulation in diabetic mice.
In acute stroke settings, collateral circulation can
sustain tissue perfusion following a proximal arterial
occlusion. The leptomeningeal collateral network represents the ﬁnal route for the perfusion of ischemic
territory distal to the proximal occlusion (23). After arterial occlusion, the reduction in CBF is more pronounced in
the infarct core and less severe at the periphery or penumbra, due to NO-dependent collateral circulation recruitment (24). Furthermore, the inactivation of both
nNOS and eNOS activity leads to lesion extension (5).
Here, we have shown that a combination of endothelial

and SMC dysfunction and eNOS and nNOS downregulation in 8-week diabetic mice prevents the dilatation of
cerebral arterioles, compromising the adaptation of blood
ﬂow to metabolic rate, and potentially explaining the
greater infarct volume and neurological deﬁcit. One
should thus encourage the development of therapeutic
strategies that aim to improve the early recovery of vasoreactivity, for example by using statins or angiotensin
type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers to modify the NO pathway
(25).
Another mechanism that might take part in increased
stroke severity is increased BBB permeability, as shown
by Evans blue extravasation, and as already demonstrated in a model of cerebral artery occlusion and
reperfusion (tMCAo) in type 2 diabetic mice (26). We
found no hemorrhagic transformation on brain MRI, in
accordance with previous reports indicating that hemorrhage is mainly found in tMCAo (27). There was also
no gadolinium enhancement, although BBB proteins
levels were lower in diabetic mice, suggesting that gadolinium assessment might not be sufﬁcient to detect
these changes.
Blood vessel stabilization depends on the equilibrium
between proangiogenic factors (VEGFa and Ang2) and
maturation and stabilization factors (Ang1, PDGF-b, and
TGF-b). We have shown that prior to cerebral ischemia,
the brain microvasculature in diabetic mice is immature,
with a decrease in VEGFa, Ang2, Ang1, PDGF-b, and TGF-b
mRNA levels. This is consistent with another model of
diabetes, the Goto-Kakisaki rat, in which there are more

Figure 6—A: Diabetes induces an increase in BBB permeability as shown by Evans blue extravasation (n = 5–6) and a decrease in BBB
proteins at D1 (n = 5–8). Diabetes increases endothelial cell proliferation (B) and angiogenic factors (VEGFa and Ang2) (C) at D7 (n = 5–8).

prominent unperfused new brain vessels and a decreased
pericyte-to-endothelial cell ratio, suggesting a “destabilizing vessel proﬁle” (28). However, this immature vascular
phenotype is associated with increased cortical vascular
density in Goto-Kakisaki rats, also reported in Leprdb/db
mice by Prakash and colleagues (28,29), and increased
VEGFa protein levels in micro- but not macrovessels (28).
This is in contrast with our own ﬁndings, where increased
vessel density was instead associated with a downregulation of VEGFa mRNA and protein levels. In contrast to our
experimental conditions, Prakash et al. (28,29) used a rat
genetic model of type 2 diabetes with a shorter duration
of diabetes and measured VEGFa levels in microvessels
and not the whole brain. As the duration of chronic hyperglycemia is longer in our protocol, it is possible that
toxic metabolic end products due to the disease might
interfere with proangiogenic pathways under chronic
conditions (30).

At D1 poststroke, mRNAs for angiogenic factors in
diabetic mice were not different from values obtained
before stroke, and still lower than those in nondiabetic
mice. At D7, PDGF-b, TGF-b, and Ang1 mRNA were not
signiﬁcantly different between diabetic and nondiabetic
mice, whereas a signiﬁcant upregulation of VEGFa and
Ang2 mRNA and protein levels was observed, with increased angiogenesis. From these time points, we can deduce that the time course of vessel repair is delayed in our
model, since these factors should have returned to basal
levels otherwise (31). These results are in contrast to
those of Cui et al. (26) who investigated the regulation
of Ang1 and Ang2 1 day after stroke in a model of type 2
diabetic mice and found early modiﬁcations with decreased Ang1 and increased Ang2 levels. However, protein
levels in their study were not compared with nonischemic
mice but with the contralateral hemisphere. Since there
could be compensatory changes in the contralateral

1008

Diabetic Cerebral Microangiopathy

hemisphere, we chose to compare our ischemic diabetic
mice to nonoperated diabetic mice. Poststroke angiogenesis results in increased vessel density from D1
that continues until D21 (31), and is maximal between
D3 and D7. In a model of tMCAo in CD1 mice, VEGFa
and its receptor ﬂk1 (VEGFR2) were maximally upregulated from 3 h until D3 for the ligand and until D7 for
the receptor, at which time they returned to baseline.
Ang2 follows the same time course, whereas Ang1
expression is delayed with maximal expression at D7.
To our knowledge, there is no report as to the time
course of proangiogenic factors after stroke. As we
have shown previously in C57Bl/6J mice following
pMCAo that angiogenesis is also maximal between D3
and D7 (6), we suggest that the time course of expression of proangiogenic factors is also comparable, despite
the use of different models. To our knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst time that these factors have been sequentially
measured in diabetic mice after stroke. NO is also a positive regulator of neovascularization by contributing to
the proangiogenic effect of growth factors (32), and its
downregulation in diabetic mice might prevent proper
angiogenesis.
Although our experimental data were obtained from
two different sets of animals and a causal relationship
thus cannot be strictly veriﬁed, we believe that cerebral
microvessel impairment, already present in nonoperated diabetic mice, is at least partly responsible for
worsened stroke outcome. 1) After cerebral ischemia,
the magnitude of vasoreactivity, i.e., the recruitment of
collateral circulation, is inversely proportional to brain
damage (24), and the vasoreactivity impairment in our
model suggests that after stroke, compensatory mechanisms, such as collateral opening and patency, are not
sufﬁcient to limit brain damage. 2) The magnitude of
BBB opening after stroke determines the extent of the
infarct (33). This is also observed in the diabetic mice
in our study, whose cerebral vessels display an immature phenotype with a relative decrease in proangiogenic factors and BBB proteins, suggesting BBB
“fragility.” 3) As shown in a previous work (6), cerebral
repair is partly dependent on angiogenesis, and we
could speculate that if proangiogenic factors are already decreased before stroke, they will be less effective
in initiating an angiogenic response after stroke, as also
observed in the diabetic mice in our study. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the involvement of other
factors such as brain-speciﬁc basal inﬂammation in
diabetic mice in worsened stroke outcome. Indeed,
inﬂammation is a key contributor to brain damage after
stroke (34), and the level of inﬂammatory cytokines
(interleukin-1b, tumor necrosis factor-a, and interleukin-6) has been shown to be increased in the hippocampus of obese and diabetic db/db mice (35). The
contribution of inﬂammation to brain damage STZinduced diabetic mice following stroke warrants further
study.

Diabetes Volume 64, March 2015

Alterations of the microvasculature associated with
peripheral diabetic neuropathy have also been reported.
Demiot et al. (36) have observed an impaired pressureinduced vasodilation response associated with neuropathy in male Swiss mice 8 weeks after they were given
a high dose of STZ (200 mg/kg), and Jeong et al. (37)
have observed decreased vasa nervorum in the sciatic
nerve in a similar model. In human diabetic neuropathy,
a thickening of the basement membrane, endothelial
fenestration, decrease of periendothelial coverage,
reduction of nerve blood ﬂow correlated with the severity of diabetic neuropathy (38–41), and a reduction
(40,41) or increase of capillary density (42) have all
been reported. The absence of microvascular structural
abnormalities in our model at the time of analysis could
indicate that such modiﬁcations are milder or occur later
in the brain.
We chose to develop a chronic induced type 1 diabetic
mouse model in order to exclude hypertension and
dyslipidemia, which are also responsible for vascular impairment, and other confounding factors, from our analysis.
Although type 1 diabetes only represents ;10% of diabetic
patients, though this proportion is greater at younger
ages (43), the relative stroke risk is four times greater
in type 1 than in type 2 diabetes. Moreover, in most
genetic type 2 diabetic models, the lack of the leptin
receptor may introduce a bias since leptin is neuroprotective, and the lack of leptin signaling worsens damage after
cerebral ischemia (44). The duration and degree of hyperglycemia in diabetes may also be critical for neurovascular
outcomes. Most animal studies have been performed after
acute or short-term (2–5 weeks) hyperglycemia, which
might not be sufﬁcient to cause the microangiopathy
that needs to be taken into account in the pathophysiology
of diabetic stroke, in particular in repair mechanisms that
occur later than purely metabolic effects. However,
although STZ induction is a well-accepted model of type
1 diabetes (45), it does not recapitulate the complex
pathophysiology observed in type 1 diabetic patients,
and the extrapolation of our ﬁndings to these patients
is thus premature.
Our results provide for the ﬁrst time direct evidence
that diabetes alters cerebral vasoreactivity, microvessel
density, permeability, and stability, all of which inﬂuence
neuronal and vascular damage following ischemic brain
injury not only in the short-term but at longer times. These
results offer another insight into the crucial role of the
neurovascular network in the outcome of stroke. They
highlight the fact that there is an urgent need to understand the basic mechanisms that limit or enhance brain
repair after stroke and to develop appropriate experimental
models to lead to customized stroke therapies.
