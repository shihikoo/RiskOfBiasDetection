Purpose of research: Since, transient focal cerebral ischaemia exhibits detrimental effect not only during the
course of ischaemia but also after the onset of reperfusion, the current study is focussed on identifying the appropriate therapeutic time point at which NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) exerts better neuroprotection.
Principal results: Pre-ischaemic administration of L-NAME ameliorated neurological deﬁcits much better than the
during ischaemic and post-ischaemic groups. Pre-ischaemic L-NAME has also mitigated glutamate excitotoxicity,
increased glutamine synthetase activity, ATP and NAD levels, decreased nitrate/nitrite content, down regulated
TNF-α and upregulated IL-10 expressions and reduced the cerebral infarction signiﬁcantly than the during ischaemic and post-ischaemic groups.
Major conclusion: Current study revealed that L-NAME improved neurological deﬁcit at the pre-ischaemic state in
transient focal cerebral ischaemia and has also signiﬁcantly ameliorated glutamate excitotoxicity. Though LNAME showed neuroprotective effects when administered at during and post-ischaemia (during reperfusion),
it exerts considerable neuroprotection when administered pre-ischaemically.

1. Introduction
Cerebral ischaemia is a debilitating condition which causes enduring
physical impairment or mortality. Treatment of cerebral ischaemia still
remains a daunting due to its complex pathophysiological cascade and
lack of time dependent therapeutic intervention (Trent et al., 2012).
Though treatments such as thrombolytic agents (tissue plasminogen activator and pro-urokinase) and other endovascular procedures are currently available, pitfall like long and poor recanalisation rates, vascular
rupture (haemorrhagic) and vasospasm restricts their use (Paramdeep
et al., 2013; Kurre et al., 2013; Arnaout et al., 2012; Davalos et al.,
2005). Extensive investigations over the past few decades revealed generation of nitric oxide, as one of the primary ground for the devastating
effects of cerebral ischaemia. Massive release of nitric oxide is triggered
by the calcium dependent activation of neuronal NOS (nNOS) and inducible form of NOS (iNOS) which leads to oxidative stress in turn neuronal death. In particular, the concentration of NO is augmented about
50% in the ischaemic regions within 30 min of reperfusion (Iadecola
et al., 1995). Hence, inhibition of NOS is considered as a potential target
in acute ischaemic stroke treatment (Nicole et al., 2012). Though the

neuroprotection afforded by NOS inhibition is demonstrated in many
studies, these molecules tend to fail in clinical trials due to lack of
knowledge on their appropriate therapeutic time window.
Current study has been designed to investigate the therapeutic time
window of a non-selective NOS inhibitor, L-NAME. Although extensive
investigations were carried out to establish the optimum therapeutic
time window of L-NAME for its neuroprotection (Margaill et al., 1997;
Batteur-Parmentier et al., 2000; Bemeur et al., 2004), a closer time
point investigation i.e., at pre-ischaemic (before the ischaemia), during
ischaemic (on-going ischaemia) and post-ischaemic (after reperfusion)
states, is yet to be studied. In the present study, L-NAME (non-selective
NOS inhibitor) was administered at three different time points to determine its therapeutic time window in transient focal ischaemic rats.
Optimal therapeutic time window of L-NAME was measured in terms
of the neurological deﬁcit, glutamate, aspartate, glutamine synthetase,
ATP, NAD, nitrate/nitrite, TNF-α and IL-10 and brain infarction in
MCAO/R rats.

2.2. Animal ethical clearance and maintenance of animals
The study was approved by IAEC committee of Sri Ramachandra
University (IAEC/XXXIII/SRU/250/2013). Male Sprague Dawley rats
weighing 290–640 g were used and housed individually in ventilated
room in which an air exchange of 12–15 changes per hour with
55:45% air exchange ratio was maintained. Temperature and humidity
was maintained at 22 ± 3 °C and 30–70% respectively. Photoperiod of
12 h light and dark was maintained and the animals were fed with
extruded pellet feed from Provimi, Bangalore, and puriﬁed water ad
libitum. Animals were acclimatised under laboratory conditions for
7 days prior to experiment start.

2.6.1. Estimation of glutamate and aspartate
Glutamate and aspartate contents were estimated following the
method of Babu et al. (2007). Brain tissue was homogenised using a
mixture of 0.1 N HCL and 80% ethanol. 200 μl was used for about
10 mg of tissue. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4500 rpm for
20 min at 25 °C. The supernatant was collected and glutamate and
aspartate were estimated in HPTLC (CAMAG — version 1.3.4, CSA). Silica
gel GF254 was used as the stationary phase. Mobile phase is prepared
with 65:15:25 (v/v) ratio of n-butanol, glacial acetic acid and water.
0.2% ninhydrin was used for detection and 486 nm was set as the wavelength. L-Glutamic acid and L-aspartic acid were used as standard at a
concentration of 20–200 ng to plot calibration curve.

2.3. Middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R)
Middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion method was followed
to induce transient cerebral focal ischaemia using modiﬁed method of
Longa et al. (1989). Rats were anaesthetised with chloral hydrate
(35 mg/kg, i.p.). An incision was made on the upper thoracic region
and the right common carotid artery was identiﬁed following which
the bifurcation of external and internal carotid artery was identiﬁed. A
small nick was made 0.2 mm spring scissors in the external carotid artery just above the branching and 4-0 nylon ﬁlament coated with
0.01% poly-L-lysine was inserted into it and proceeded further into the
internal carotid artery. Nylon ﬁlament was inserted until a slight resistance was felt in the internal carotid artery. The time lapse of nylon ﬁlament insertion was about 15–25 s. The ﬁlament was held in position by
soft ligation with the internal carotid artery. External incision was sutured and after 2 h of ischaemia, rats were again anaesthetised and the
external suture was removed exposing the ﬁlament. The ﬁlament was
then pulled out slowly and reperfusion of blood was assured by visualisation. The external and internal incisions were sutured and the rats
were placed in a cage under an incandescent lamp for 1 h until recovery
to maintain the temperature to counteract possible hypothermic effects.
2.4. Animal grouping and experimental design
Animals were segregated into ﬁve groups, each containing 12 rats.
First group is sham-operated (SO), in which, only the incision is made
and ﬁlament not inserted. This group received a dose of 0.9% saline.
Second set is the ischaemic reperfusion (IR) group, which also received
0.9% saline. The other three groups were pre-, during and postischaemic/reperfusion groups, which received 3 mg/kg of intraperitoneal L-NAME (Buisson et al., 1993). Pre-ischaemic group received L-NAME
30 min prior to the surgery, during ischaemic group received the drug
2 h after inducing ischaemia and the post-IR group received the drug
3 h after the onset of reperfusion (time points were ﬁxed on the basis
of our earlier research) (Saravana Babu and Ramanathan, 2009). All animals were subjected to neurological scoring and then sacriﬁced using
CO2 asphyxiation. Brains were quickly removed and ipsilateral part
was dissected over ice-cold methanol using the atlas of Paxinos and
Watson (1986).
2.5. Assessment of neurological deﬁcit
Neurological scoring was performed following the method of
Bederson et al. (1986), with minor modiﬁcation. Rats were scored
based on the following observation:
No evident neurological deﬁcit — Score 0.
Flexion of contralateral forelimb — Score 1.
Decreased deﬁance to lateral push — Score 2.

2.6.2. Glutamine synthetase activity
Glutamine synthetase activity was determined following the method of Sadasivam and Manickam (2003). Mixture of 0.5 ml of Tris HCL
buffer, 25 μl of 0.2 M glutamate, 25 μl of 100 mM ammonia, 50 μl of
3 mM MgCl2 and 100 μl of ATP was prepared and preincubated for
5 min at 37 °C. To this, 100 μl of 10% homogenate was added and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was arrested by adding 500 μl of
10% TCA. To this again 100 μl of 10% homogenate was added. The mixture was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min. To 200 μl of supernatant,
distilled water (925 μl), ammonium molybdate (125 μl) and amino-2napthol-4-sulphonic acid (50 μl) was added and incubated for 10 min
at 37 °C. Colour intensity was read at 640 nm using a spectrophotometer
(Perkin Elmer). Potassium dihydrogen phosphate (1.6–8.0 μg) was used
as standard for plotting calibration curve.
2.6.3. ATP and NAD contents
ATP and NAD were determined following the method of Zhang
et al. (2009). Homogenate was sonicated with 0.1 N ice cold perchloric
acid to inactivate ATPases and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min
under 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and neutralised with 1 N NaOH
and quantiﬁed in reverse phase HPLC (Perkin Elmer). Hypersil C18
was used as the column and mobile phase is prepared with 100 mM
KH2PO4 and K2HPO4 buffer of pH-6.0. Wavelength used was 254 nm
and ATP & NAD standards were prepared according to the method of
dissolving standard (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).
2.6.4. Nitric oxide (in terms of nitrate/nitrite)
Nitrate/nitrite was estimated using the method of Green et al.
(1982). To the homogenate (0.2 ml) 0.4 ml of sulphosalicylic acid
(35%) and 1.8 ml of saline was added to precipitate the protein. The
mixture was then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. To 1 ml of the
supernatant, 2 ml of Griess reagent was added and mixed well. The mixture was then allowed to stand for 20 min in dark. The colour intensity
was read at 412 nm using a UV/Visible spectrophotometer (Perkin
Elmer). Sodium nitrate/nitrite was used as the standard.
2.7. Protein expression using western blot
Western blotting of TNF-α and IL-10 was performed following
the method of Lee et al. (2010). β-Actin was used as the standard.
Brain tissue was homogenised in 0.1 M ice cold Tris HCL and then centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min. Protein content of the supernatant
was determined using Bradford reagent. Aliquots containing 50 μg of
protein were loaded with β-mercaptoethanol and bromophenol blue
on 12% SDS PAGE. Proteins after separation were transferred on to
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes and then blocked overnight
with 3% BSA in Tris-buffered saline and then probed with primary antibodies. Membrane was washed three times in Tris-buffered saline for

248

5 min and then probed with secondary antibodies for 1 h and washed
with Tris-buffered saline and again incubated with BCIP/NBT for
10 min. Bands were visualised under a scanner and quantiﬁed using
BioID software using the expression of β-actin.
2.8. TTC staining
TTC staining was performed as per the method of Kim et al. (2004).
Brain was collected after performing transcardiac perfusion of normal
saline and the brain was frozen. Coronal section of frozen brain measuring about 2 mm was taken and immersed in 4% TTC for 20 min at 37 °C
and then ﬁxed in 10% formalin. The infracted portion of the brain
appears unstained or colourless where as the viable part of the brain appears brick red in colour. Infarction was expressed as the ratio of the infarct in the ipsilateral side to the contralateral side of the brain. Stained
brain slices were visualised using a Motic DMB1-2 MP microscope and
the infarct area was quantiﬁed using Image J software.
3. Statistical analysis
Neurochemical, biochemical and behavioural data were expressed
as mean ± SEM. One way ANOVA followed by Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test as post hoc was used to analyse the statistical differences
between the groups. Neurological scoring were represented as median
and expressed in interquartile range. Comparisons of the neurological
scores were analysed using Mann–Whitney U test. GraphPad Prism 5
software (version 5.03) was used for all statistical calculations including
correlation. Statistical signiﬁcance was set as p b 0.05.
4. Results
The current investigation was carried out to unravel the therapeutic
time window of L-NAME based on its inﬂuence on neurological functioning, biochemical parameters and expression of TNF-α, IL-10 in rats
subjected to MCAO/R. One animal in the IR group was found dead at
24 h after MCAO/R.
4.1. Assessment of neurological deﬁcit
Rats in the IR group exhibited signiﬁcant neurological deﬁcit than
sham operated (median = 4.0, p b 0.001). Pre-ischaemic administration
of L-NAME signiﬁcantly ameliorated neurological deﬁcits than during
ischaemic (median = 0.0, p b 0.001) and post-ischaemic treatments respectively (median = 2.0, p b 0.001). Amongst the three, pre-ischaemic
administration of L-NAME has signiﬁcantly improved neurological deﬁcit (Table 1).
4.2. Estimation of glutamate and aspartate
A signiﬁcant increase in ipsilateral glutamate content was observed
in the IR rats than sham operated rats [F (4, 54) = 5.348, p b 0.01]
(p b 0.01, 127.11%). Glutamate content was found to be signiﬁcantly reduced in pre-ischaemic rats (p b 0.01, 57.50%). A slight non-signiﬁcant

reduction in the glutamate content was observed in during ischaemic and post-ischaemic groups (19.76 and 17.71%) respectively. Preischaemic L-NAME treatment has signiﬁcantly reduced the glutamate
content (Fig. 1).
A signiﬁcant [F (4, 54) = 3.463, p b 0.001] increase in ipsilateral aspartate was observed in the IR rats than sham operated rats (p b 0.5,
56.41%). Aspartate content was found to have reduced signiﬁcantly in
pre-ischaemic rats (p b 0.5, 54.48%). Whereas, in the during ischaemic
and post-ischaemic groups, slight non-signiﬁcant reduction (23.07
and 21.79%) in the aspartate level was observed respectively. Preischaemic L-NAME treatment was found to signiﬁcantly reduce the ipsilateral aspartate level (Fig. 1).
4.3. Glutamine synthetase activity (GS activity)
MCAO/R rats showed signiﬁcant increase in GS activity than sham
operated [F (4, 54) = 4.866, p b 0.01, 63.23%]. GS activity was found
to be decreased signiﬁcantly in the pre-ischaemic group than the ischaemic rats (p b 0.01, 41.98%). Whereas, a non-signiﬁcant reduction in
the GS activity was observed in both the during ischaemic and postischaemic groups (23.60 and 27.29%) respectively. Amongst the
three treatments, activity of GS was substantially reduced in the preischaemic group (Fig. 1).
4.4. ATP and NAD
In the MCAO/R group signiﬁcant decrease in ATP content was
observed in the ischaemic group than the sham operated [F (4, 54) =
23.69, p b 0.001, 333.70%]. Compared to the ischaemic group, ATP
level was signiﬁcantly reduced in the pre-ischaemic (p b 0.001,
299.43%) and during (p b 0.05, 125.28%) ischaemic groups. A non-significant reduction in the ATP level was observed in the post-ischaemic
group (111.23%) (Fig. 2).
With regard to NAD, signiﬁcant decrease in the NAD level was
observed in MCAO/R rats than sham operated [F (4, 54) = 24.06,
p b 0.001, 64.29%]. A signiﬁcant increase in the NAD level was observed
in the pre-ischaemic group (p b 0.001, 182.44%). A slight signiﬁcant
increase was observed in during ischaemic (p b 0.01, 81.31%) and
post-ischaemic groups (p b 0.01, 81.60%). ATP and NAD levels were
found to be signiﬁcantly augmented in the pre-ischaemic than during
ischaemic and post-ischaemic groups (Fig. 2).
4.5. Estimation of nitrate/nitrite
Nitrate/nitrite was signiﬁcantly increased in the MCAO/R group than
sham operated [F (4, 54) = 23.61, p b 0.001, 446.29%]. A signiﬁcant reduction in the nitrate/nitrite content was observed in pre-ischaemic
(p b 0.001, 82.05%), during ischaemic (p b 0.05, 197.28%) and postischaemic (p b 0.05, 211.93%) groups respectively. Amidst the three
treatments, pre-ischaemic administration of L-NAME has greatly reduced the nitrate/nitrite content than during ischaemic and postischaemic administrations respectively (Fig. 2).

TNF-α was upregulated in the MCAO/R group than the sham operated [F (4, 54) = 8.618, p b 0.001]. Pre-ischaemic administration of LNAME down regulated the expression of TNF-α than the ischaemic
group (p b 0.001). Slight non-signiﬁcant decline in the expression of
TNF-α was observed in during ischaemic and post-ischaemic groups respectively (Fig. 3).
IL-10 was down regulated in the MCAO/R group than the sham operated [F (4, 54) = 3.906, p b 0.001]. Expression of IL-10 was also observed to be signiﬁcantly up regulated in the pre-ischaemic and
during ischaemic rats (p b 0.001), whereas no difference was observed
in the expression of IL-10 in post-ischaemic group. Pre-ischaemic

administration of L-NAME has mutually upregulated IL-10 and down
regulated TNF-α than the other groups (Fig. 3).
4.7. TTC staining
In the MCAO/R group severe infarct volume of about 40.0% was observed when compared to the sham operated [F (4, 54) = 35.72,
p b 0.001]. Amongst the other three groups, pre-ischaemic administration (p b 0.001) of L-NAME had reduced the infarction signiﬁcantly
when compared to the IR group. In the during ischaemic and post-ischaemic treatments about 29.47% and 29.84% of infarct volumes were observed respectively. Compared to the other groups, pre-ischaemic
administration of L-NAME had signiﬁcantly reduced the infarct volume
(Figs. 4 & 5).
4.8. Correlation analysis
As pre-ischaemic administration of L-NAME was found to signiﬁcantly improve the neurological functioning and mitigate excitotoxicity,

correlation analysis of nitrate/nitrite with neurological functioning,
brain infarction, TNF-α and IL-10 was performed (Fig. 6). A strong
positive correlation of nitrate/nitrite was observed with neurological
scoring (r = 0.912) and % infarction of brain (r = 0.769) and TNF-α
(r = 0.886) respectively. A strong negative correlation of nitrate/nitrite
was observed with IL-10 (r = −0.839). Pre-ischaemic administration of
L-NAME was found to signiﬁcantly improve the overall behaviour and
biochemical parameters in the MCAO/R rats (Fig. 6 & Table 2).

5. Discussion
The current study reveals the neuroprotection and suitable therapeutic time window of L-NAME, a NOS inhibitor, in ischaemic reperfusion rats. Reports showed that low doses of non-selective NOS
inhibitors have wide therapeutic time window in MCAO model of transient focal cerebral ischaemia (Margaill et al., 1997). As it was reported
in many previous studies, that L-NAME exerts better neuroprotection at
a dose of 3 mg/kg b.w., the same dose was utilised in the current study

(Wei and Quast, 1998; Akihiro et al., 2011; Gu et al., 2012). Signiﬁcant increase in glutamate, aspartate, GS activity, nitrate/nitrite, ATP
and NAD contents in the ischaemic reperfusion (IR) rats reveals the
excitotoxic events induced by the MCAO/R. In addition, the larger
cerebral infarct area also conﬁrms the signiﬁcant neuronal insult in
the IR rats. Administration of L-NAME at different time points, i.e., before
inducing ischaemia (pre-ischaemic), during ischaemia (1 h after the
onset of ischaemia) and post-ischaemia (3 h after ischaemia) revealed
that pre-ischaemic administration of L-NAME ameliorated glutamate
excitotoxicity better and improved neurological functioning than during ischaemic or post-ischaemic administration (Fig. 7).
Better reduction in glutamate level by L-NAME may be attributed to
the fact that early inhibition of NOS, decreases nitric oxide generation,

251

leading to the activation of cytochrome oxidase which restores mitochondrial function thereby leading to decreased glutamate production and ameliorating glutamate excitotoxicity (Cooper et al., 1994;
Clementi et al., 1999; Jekabsone et al., 2007; Brown and Neher, 2010).
Glutamine synthetase activity is increased in the IR group due to the increased extracellular glutamate level (Afolabi et al., 2015). The decrease
in GS activity may be corroborated to the decreased glutamate level in
MCAO/R rats.
Pre-ischaemic L-NAME administration increased the ATP and NAD
levels by reducing the glutamate content thereby decreasing the glutamine synthetase activity. Research revealed that red blood cells liberate
ATP in response to a variety of stimuli, including ﬂow-induced deformation and this stimulates the formation of nitric oxide from endothelium,
which may reinstate cerebral vascular ﬂow (Sarah et al., 2014). Postischaemic administration of L-NAME, leads to decreased intracellular
Ca2, thereby inhibiting caspase and prevents apoptosis (Mishima et al.,
2003). Singh et al. (2010) ascertained that L-NAME treatment signiﬁcantly reversed the mitochondrial complex-I activity and caspase-3 activity. The decreased infarct volume i.e., increased uptake of TTC stain in
brain sections reveals that early inhibition of nitric oxide load could
restore mitochondrial function. This is in corroboration with the ﬁnding
that pre-ischaemic administration of L-NAME signiﬁcantly reduces the
infarct volume in TTC staining (Nagafuji et al., 1993). Inhibition of
NOS by L-NAME also decreases extracellular glutamate and increases
neuronal viability, and thereby confers neuroprotection and neuronal
plasticity (Stoll et al., 2000). On the other hand, decrease in NO generation, inhibits the formation of peroxynitrate, the primary candidate of
nitrooxidative stress (Tsai et al., 2007).
Pre-ischaemic administration of L-NAME considerably decreased the
protein expression of TNF-α and increased IL-10 expressions which is
consistent with earlier ﬁndings (Chen et al., 2014). The neuroprotective
effect of L-NAME may be partially substantiated to the fact that TNF-α
exerts neurotoxicity only in the presence of elevated inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS) (Zhou et al., 2013). Awooda et al. (2013) demonstrated that pretreatment of middle cerebral artery occluded/reperfused

rats with L-NAME signiﬁcantly improved neurological functioning and
also reduced cerebral infarction due to its antioxidant property. Reduction of cerebral infarct volume by L-NAME at doses 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg
b.w. is also demonstrated by Kamii et al. (1996).
Kalaivani et al. (2014) reported that nitric oxide surge occurs only
after 6 h of ischaemia and it is an mediator of Parp activation. Improved
neuroprotection of pre-ischaemic administration of L-NAME may be
attributed to the fact that it reaches the target site before the start of
ischaemic event. Whereas, in the case of during ischaemic and postischaemic administrations, the peak damage has already ensued by
the time of therapeutic intervention. Further, in the case of ongoing
ischaemic state, the delay/decreased drug bioavailability in the site of
action may be associated to reduced blood ﬂow due to ischaemia.
Kalaivani et al. (2014) has identiﬁed that activation of Parp is an early
event preceding the pathophysiological events. Pre-ischaemic L-NAME
also inhibits nitric oxide synthases thereby decreasing the expression
of PARP which sustains ATP level without reducing and there by inhibits
neuronal death (Valerie, 2009). Though there are evidences to show

the neuroprotection afforded by L-NAME pre-clinically, one of the setbacks in evaluation of L-NAME clinically, may be the lack of complete information on the appropriate therapeutic time window. Current data
may present a forefront for clinical trial attempt for assessing
neuroprotectivity of L-NAME in stroke.

6. Conclusion
To conclude, pre-ischaemic administration of L-NAME improves
neurological functioning, abrogates glutamate excitotoxicity, alleviates
nitric oxide mediated neurotoxicity, reduces cerebral infarction and
ameliorates oxidative and nitrooxidative stress in ischaemic reperfused
rats. Based on the current study and the previous reports on L-NAME, it
is evident that the dose and time of therapeutic intervention with NOS
inhibitor plays a vital role in exhibiting neuroprotection. Current study
reveals the precise therapeutic time point of L-NAME at which it ameliorates glutamate excitotoxicity and improves neurological functioning.
