SUMMARY
Aim: To study whether endogenous endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are involved in
neovascularization after stroke. Materials and methods: Animal stroke models were
established by subjecting male SD rats to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
(pMCAO). Vessels in ischemic boundary zone (IBZ) were stained with antibody against
laminin at 1 to 21 days after pMCAO. EPCs and newly formed vessels were identified by
staining with special markers. After inhibiting recruitment of EPCs with AMD3100, a
CXCR4 antagonist, endogenous EPCs, capillary density, cerebral blood flow (CBF) in IBZ,
and neurobehavioral functions were assessed by staining, FITC-dextran, laser-Doppler perfusion monitor, and neurologic severity score. Results: After pMCAO, vessels were found
in IBZ at day 3, reaching a peak at day 14. The change in number of laminin-positive cells
showed a similar pattern with that of vessels. Apart from few endothelial cells, most of laminin-positive cells were endogenous EPCs. After treatment with AMD3100, the number of
endogenous EPCs, capillary density, and CBF in IBZ were significantly reduced, and neurobehavioral functions were worse as compared with the normal saline group. Conclusions:
Our findings suggested that endogenous EPCs participated in the neovascularization via
CXCR4/SDF-1 axis after pMCAO and mobilizing endogenous EPCs could be a treatment
alternative for stroke.

Introduction
Mounting evidence showed that neovascularization is an
important event in the regeneration of ischemic tissues [1].
The newly formed blood vessels stimulate neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and enhance neuronal and synaptic plasticity [2].
Nevertheless, the exact mechanism of the post-stroke neovascularization, an important target of stroke intervention,
remains elusive.
Recently, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) transplantation
has been clinically used for treatment for ischemia [3]. EPCs are
immature hematopoietic cells circulating in peripheral blood
and capable of differentiating into mature endothelial cells, taking part in neovascularization and promoting recovery after
ischemic events, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), limb
ischemia, and stroke [4–7]. In stroke patients, the level of circulating EPCs increases and is negatively correlated with lesion
volume and outcome of stroke [8]. However, little is known

about of role of endogenous EPCs in the neovascularization
after stroke.
Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and its cellular receptor
CXC-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) are key regulators of EPCs
mobilization and recruitment [9]. Most studies showed that EPCs
expressed CXCR4 receptor [4, 6, 9]. In most ischemic models,
SDF-1 expression was upregulated in ischemic area, and contributed to recruitment of transplanted EPCs to ischemic area [4, 6,
10]. In this study, we found neovascularization of ischemic
boundary zone (IBZ) after stroke. A question naturally presents
itself as to whether endogenous EPCs take part in neovascularization of IBZ via CXCR4/SDF-1 axis after stroke.
In the present study, we used a rat permanent middle cerebral
artery occlusion (pMCAO) model to examine (i) the change in the
number of vessels in IBZ of brain; (ii) possible involvement of
endogenous EPCs in the neovascularization in IBZ; and (iii)
recruitment of endogenous EPCs to IBZ by CXCR4/SDF-1 axis
after pMCAO.

Materials and methods

Western Blotting

Establishment of pMCAO Model

The rats were sacrificed at 3, 6, 12 h, 1, 3, and 7 days after pMCAO.
Then, the tissue samples from the ischemic boundary zone (IBZ)
were taken, put into the lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor,
homogenized, and centrifuged. Protein (30 lg) was added to 16.5%
SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to
polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated
with primary antibodies: rabbit anti-SDF-1 (1:300, Novus). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G
was used as secondary antibody (1: 2000; Santa Cruz). Proteins
were visualized using a Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescence
kit (Thermo Scientific, USA). b-actin (1:500, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX,
USA) served as internal control. The protein bands were scanned
using Chemi Imager 5500 V2.03 software package, and integrated
density values (IDV) were calculated using Image J (NIH Shareware) program, with b-actin serving as internal control.

Adult male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 190–240 g, 6–
7 weeks old, were used in this study. Rats were obtained from
and maintained in the Animal Care and Use Committee of Tongji Medical College at Huazhong University of Science and
Technology, Wuhan, China. All procedures involving animal
treatment were approved by the institutional committee of animal care and use. Rats were randomly divided into different
groups. Rats were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection
of 10% chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg). Rectal temperature was
maintained at 37.3  0.5°C with a feedback-regulated heating
pad during the procedures. Permanent middle cerebral artery
occlusion (pMCAO) was created according to a previous report
[11]. In brief, the right common carotid artery, right external
carotid artery, and right internal carotid artery were isolated via
a midline incision. The right external carotid artery was ligated
with a 6–0 nylon suture. Then, a poly-L-lysine-coated 4–0
monofilament nylon suture (Sunbio Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing,
China) was inserted from the right internal carotid artery and
advanced for about 18 mm to occlude the origin of right MCA.
Neurobehavioral functions tests and TTC staining were used to
verify the success of surgery 1 day after pMCAO. Sham-operated
rats underwent identical procedures but without filament
insertion.

Administration of AMD3100
AMD3100 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), a specific CXCR4
antagonist, was dissolved with normal saline solution to an injection concentration of 1 mg/ml. AMD3100 (1 mg/kg/day) was
injected intraperitoneally 1 h after pMCAO for seven consecutive
days. The same amount of normal saline solution was used in the
saline-treated group.

Immunofluorescence Examination
Immunofluorescence staining was performed on 4-lm paraffinembedding sections. The following primary antibodies were
used: chicken anti-Laminin (1:100, Abcam), mouse anti-Iba1
(1:100, Abcam), rabbit anti-CD163 (1:100, Abcam), rabbit antiGFAP (1:100, Abcam), mouse anti-vWF (1:100; Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Hudson, NH, USA), rabbit anti-Ki67 (1:100, Abcam),
mouse anti-CD34 (1:100; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO,
USA), goat anti-VEGFR2 (1:100, Abcam), and rabbit antiCXCR4 (1:100, Abcam). For double or triple immunostaining,
various combinations of primary antibodies were used. All sections were examined under a TCS SP5 multiphoton laser scanning confocal microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Images were
processed by using Adobe Photoshop CS (Adobe Systems,
Mountain View, CA). Positive cells or vessels were counted
with Image J (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The means were
calculated from five randomly selected microscopic fields in IBZ,
and three consecutive sections were analyzed for each brain by
a person blind to the grouping. Data were expressed as mean
numbers of cells or vessels per square millimeter as a previously
report [12].

Measurement of Capillary Density
Capillaries were identified, as described previously, by intravenous injection of 0.2 ml FITC-dextran (average mol wt 70,000,
50 mg/ml, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) 10 min before animals
were sacrificed[13]. Three coronal cryosections (20 lm) from
each rat at bregma 0.2, 0.8, and 2.8 mm were analyzed using
a TCS SP5 multiphoton laser scanning confocal microscope (Nikon). Briefly, ten fields of view from each coronal section were
acquired in the IBZ. A threshold was applied to each digitized
image to ensure that the numbers of FITC pixels reflected the original FITC-dextran-perfused patterns. Data were presented as the
numbers of FITC pixels divided by the total numbers of pixels
within the field of view, expressed as a percentage.

Neurobehavioral Functions Tests
Modified neurologic severity score was used for assessing neurobehavioral function after pMCAO as described previously [14].
Neurologic severity score examination consists of the motor, sensory and reflex tests. According to the method, the severity of
injury was graded on a scale of 0 to 14 (with normal score being 0
and maximal deficit score 14). One point was awarded either for
the inability to perform, or for abnormal task performance or for
the lack of a tested reflex. Neurobehavioral functions were evaluated independently by two person blind to the grouping.

Measurement of Cerebral Blood Flow
A laser-Doppler perfusion monitor (PF-5010; Periflux system,
Anyang-si, Korea) was used for the measurement of cerebral
blood flow (CBF). The relative CBF in the IBZ was determined as
described previously [15]. After rats were anesthetized, an incision was made on the scalp to expose the skull. The CBF at the
IBZ of ischemic side (1.5 mm posterior, 5 mm lateral to bregma)
and the contralateral area (1.5 mm posterior, 5 mm contralateral
to bregma) was continuously monitored in all animals for at least
5 min, and the average value was recorded. The relative CBF was
calculated using the formula: relative CBF = CBF of ischemic side/
CBF of contralateral side 9 100%. CBF was measured by a person
blind to the grouping.

Statistical Analyses
All values were presented as mean  standard deviation (SD).
Statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for
the Social Sciences (SPSS 13.0, USA) software. The two-tailed Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Fisher’s
LSD multiple comparison test was used for significance assessment. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Results
The Features of Neovascularization in IBZ of
Brain after pMCAO
New vessels were found in the ischemic area of rat brain after
pMCAO, with most of them at IBZ (Figure 1A). The vessels arose
at day 3 after pMCAO, and the number of the vessels increased
gradually, arriving at a peak at day 14. Then, the vessels merged
into larger vessels at day 21 (Figure 1B,C). Simultaneously, plenty
of laminin-positive cells were found in IBZ. The number of laminin-positive cells in IBZ increased gradually from day 1, reaching
a peak at day 14, and then decreased (Figure 1B, 1D). The change
in the number of laminin-positive cells showed a pattern similar
with that of the new vessels.

Involvement of Endogenous EPCs in the
Neovascularization of IBZ after pMCAO
To identify the laminin-positive cells in IBZ (Figure 2A), we first
stained the cells with the antibodies against the markers of

inflammatory cells, such as anti-Iba1 (a marker of microglial
cells) and anti-CD163 (a marker of macrophages). Our results
showed that these laminin-positive cells were neither microglial
cells (Figure 2B,C) nor macrophages (Figure 2D,E). Then, we
stained these laminin-positive cells with antibodies against the
markers of glial cells (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP). And
we found that the GFAP-positive cells did not merge with laminin-positive cells, suggesting that laminin-positive cells were not
glial cells (Figure 2F,G).
Finally, we stained the cells with the antibody of endothelial
marker (von Willebrand factor, vWF) and found that some of laminin-positive cells integrated with vWF-positive cells (Figure 3A).
Moreover, we also found that some endothelial cells formed new
vessels in IBZ after staining with both anti-vWF antibody and an
anti-Ki67 antibody (Figure 3B,C). Compared with the contralateral side, the laminin-positive endothelial cells and new vessels
that endothelial cells formed in IBZ were significantly more
(Figure 3D,E).
To identify the remaining laminin-positive cells, we detected
specific EPC surface markers (CD34 and VEGFR2) [16] on the
cells. Our results exhibited that most of laminin-positive cells in
IBZ co-expressed VEGFR2 and CD34 (Figure 4A), verifying that
the cells were EPCs. Moreover, combination staining with both
Ki67 and EPC antibodies showed that EPCs also formed new vessels (Figure 4B). Compared with the contralateral side, EPCs and
vessels that EPCs formed in IBZ were significantly more (Figure 4C,D). These findings suggested that, apart from endothelial
cells, endogenous EPCs also took part in neovascularization in the
IBZ of brain after pMCAO.

of CXCR4/SDF-1 axis in EPC recruitment, we used CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 to block the axis. The results exhibited that the

EPCs were recruited to the IBZ via CXCR4/SDF-1 axis after pMCAO.

Effects of Endogenous EPCs on Capillary
Density, CBF, and outcome after pMCAO
After FITC-dextran injection via tail vein, we examined the capillary density in IBZ after pMCAO. Consistent with the EPC recruitment, continuous AMD3100 treatment decreased the capillary
density in IBZ, when compared with the normal saline-treated
rats after pMCAO (Figure 6A). Using a laser-Doppler perfusion
monitor to measure CBF, we found that the relative CBF in
IBZ was significantly less in AMD3100 treatment group than in
saline-treated group (Figure 6B). We also evaluated the neurobe-

pMCAO, as compared with the saline-treated rats (Fig 6C). Collectively, these results indicated recruitment of EPCs could
increase capillary density and CBF in IBZ and improve outcome
after pMCAO.

Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that (i) neovascularization
took place in IBZ of brain, and the change in the number of vessels followed a pattern mimicking that of laminin-positive cells
after pMCAO; (ii) apart from few endothelial cells, most of the
laminin-positive cells were endogenous EPCs, which were
responsible for the neovascularization; (iii) endogenous EPCs

were recruited to the IBZ of brain via CXCR4/SDF-1 axis after
pMCAO; (iv) recruited EPCs increased capillary density and CBF
in IBZ and improved outcome after pMCAO. These findings indicated that the endogenous EPCs take part in neovascularization
after pMCAO and have potential to be used as a target for the
treatment for stroke.
Neovascularization plays an important role in the functional
recovery of ischemic tissues [4, 17]. An early autopsy study
revealed angiogenesis in the IBZ of human brain [18]. Angiogenesis genes and proteins such as VEGF, ang-1, ang-2, and so on,
were found to be increased in ischemic areas for days to weeks
[19, 20]. However, the exact mechanism of the post-stroke neovascularization is unclear. In the present study, we investigated
the change in neovascularization over time in IBZ after pMCAO.

The results showed that the vessels arose at day 3 after pMCAO
and gradually increased, reaching a peak at day 14, and then
merging into larger vessels. The change in the number of vessels
paralleled that of laminin-positive cells in the IBZ after pMCAO.
Laminin is an extracellular matrix protein and combines with
adhesion receptor of endothelial cells and glial cells to form the
basement membrane [21]. By combination staining, we found
that laminin-positive cells were neither glial cells, nor inflammatory cells, but endothelial cells and EPCs. Bone marrow-derived
endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) is angioblast that is believed to
take part in the formation of the new blood vessels in CAD [4].
Intravenously transplanted hEPC was capable of homing into
ischemic areas of brain, promoting angiogenesis, and improving
neurobehavioral outcome in MCAO mice [6]. In the present

study, we found that endogenous EPCs were involved in neovascularization of IBZ after pMCAO rats.
EPCs are immature hematopoietic cells circulating in peripheral
blood. Studies showed that the number of circulating EPCs is
reduced in various stroke risk factors, such as diabetes [15], hypertension [16]. However, the level of cEPCs is increased after stroke
and is negatively correlated with lesion volume and severity of
the outcome [8, 22]. These results demonstrated that endogenous
EPCs are involved in occurrence and recovery of stroke. In this
study, we found that endogenous EPCs were incorporated into
newly formed vessels of IBZ after pMCAO. On the other hand,
previous studies showed that recruited EPCs could also secret various growth factors and cytokines, such as VEGF, SDF-1 [16], and
MMP-9 [4], to improve recruitment of EPCs and neovasularization. Apart from EPCs, we found that endothelial cells in IBZ,
which may be from differentiated EPCs, and also from in situ
endothelial cells, were also important component of neovascularization in IBZ. Thus, endothelial cells could be stimulated to serve
therapeutic purpose after stroke.
Chemokines are important factors that regulate cellular migration. Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) is a key regulator of
various CXCR4-positive cells [9]. CXCR4/SDF-1 axis mediates the
migration of endogenous neuroblasts and exogenous (transplanted) bone marrow-derived cells to the ischemic area after
stroke [23]. After stroke, plasma SDF-1 was increased and was
strongly correlated with the number of cEPCs [8]. Meanwhile, we
found that SDF-1 expression and EPCs in the IBZ were also
increased. Previous studies documented that most of EPCs
expressed CXCR4 receptors [4, 6, 9]. After treatment with

ª 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

(C)

AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist [4, 24], recruitment of EPCs in
IBZ was significantly decreased. Collectively, our data suggested
that EPCs were mobilized and recruited to IBZ via CXCR4/SDF-1
axis after stroke. We also showed that capillary density and CBF
were significantly reduced in IBZ and neurobehavioral functions
were significantly impaired in AMD3100 group as compared with
normal saline group. Moreover, Chen et al. [15] found that
recruited EPCs increased neurogenesis after stroke, which also
contributed to improved outcome. These findings suggested that
endogenous EPCs recruited to IBZ through SDF-1/CXCR4 axis
and improved outcome after pMCAO.
However, CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 not only inhibited
EPCs, but also might affect other cells expressing receptor CXCR4,
such as inflammatory cells [25], neural progenitors [26]. Huang
et al. [25] showed that AMD3100 reduced leukocyte infiltration,
attenuated brain edema, and improved outcome of stroke. The
discrepancy between their finding and our result might be due to
the fact that different phase was targeted after stroke. Huang et al.
focused on the early phase after stroke and found that inflammatory cytokines and leukocytes were significantly increased within
3 day, and AMD3100 attenuated brain edema by inhibiting acute
inflammatory response. In our study, we targeted the neovascularization in the subacute stage of stroke. Circulating EPCs were
significantly increased at day 7 after ischemia [4]. AMD3100
inhibited neovasularization and aggravated outcome by inhibiting
the recruitment of EPCs. Therefore, determination of period for
the treatment is of great importance.
To sum up, this study showed that endogenous EPCs partook in
neovascularization via CXCR4/SDF-1 axis after pMCAO, and

mobilizing endogenous EPCs could be a treatment alternative for
stroke.
However, our study also had some limitations. First, although
endogenous EPCs were found in IBZ after pMCAO, we could not
reach the conclusion that endogenous EPCs in IBZ are from circulating EPCs, as they might come from brain itself. Second,
AMD3100 might affect other CXCR4-expressing cells, so except
EPCs, and neurobehavioral functions might be impaired by other
mechanisms in AMD3100-treated rats. Further studies are
warranted to resolve these limitations.
