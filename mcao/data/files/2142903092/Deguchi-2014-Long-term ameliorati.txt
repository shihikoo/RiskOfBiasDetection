Telmisartan is expected to ameliorate not only hypertension, but also metabolic syndrome as a metabosartan. We examined the effects of telmisartan on metabolic
syndrome-related molecules such as insulin receptor (IR), peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma (PPAR-g), and angiotensin 2 type 1 receptor (AT1R) in
stroke-resistant spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR-SR) after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), by administering telmisartan at either 0 (vehicle),
.3 mg/kg/day (low dose), or 3 mg/kg/day (high dose), postoperatively, from
3 months of age and performed immunohistologic analysis at 6, 12, and 18 months
of age. Compared with the vehicle group, the 2 telmisartan groups dose dependently
decreased the number of IR- and AT1R-positive neurons in the cerebral cortex in the
ipsilateral cerebral cortex from 6 to 18 months after tMCAO. On the other hand, the
number of PPAR-g-positive neurons increased in a dose-dependent manner in the 2
telmisartan groups from 6 to 18 months. The present study suggests that telmisartan
dose-dependently ameliorated metabolic syndrome-related changes in the poststroke brain of SHR-SR with a direct protective effect (low dose) and an additive
benefit, an antihypertensive effect at a high dose, for long-term protection after
tMCAO. Key Words: Angiotensin 2 type 1 receptorâ€”ischemic strokeâ€”metabolic
syndromeâ€”peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gammaâ€”spontaneously
hypertensive ratâ€”transient middle cerebral artery occlusion.

AMELIORATION OF TELMISARTAN IN SHR-SR
2

â€˜â€˜Syndrome Xâ€™â€™ by Reaven et al and â€˜â€˜deadly quartetâ€™â€™ by
Kaplan et al,3 recent reports have shown the close relationship between ischemic stroke, dementia, and metabolic syndrome.4-6
Recent studies demonstrated that the expression of
angiotensin 2 type 1 receptor (AT1R) and peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-g) play a
pivotal role in metabolic syndrome. Angiotensin receptor
blockers (ARBs), by blocking AT1R, are believed to eliminate the effects of angiotensin 2 such as inhibition of the
intracellular insulin signaling pathway at the levels of
insulin receptor substrate 1 and phosphoinositide-3 kinase and to promote oxidative stress, thereby improving
insulin resistance.7,8 In addition, an ARB, telmisartan,
has been shown to increase PPAR-g activity and
improve metabolic abnormalities such as hypertension,
insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia.9-11 Furthermore,
telmisartan also improved the cognitive function of an
Alzheimer disease rat model by affecting PPAR-g.12
However, there are no reports on the long-term effect
of telmisartan in relation to chronic hypertension, ischemic stroke, and metabolic syndrome-related molecules. Thus, in this study, stroke-resistant spontaneously
hypertensive rats (SHR-SR) were selected with transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) to examine
whether telmisartan could continue to ameliorate both
hypertension and metabolic abnormalities by affecting insulin receptor (IR), PPAR-g, and AT1R at 2 doses, namely
a low dose simply for improving metabolic syndrome and
a high dose for improving both metabolic syndrome and
hypertension.

Material and Methods
Animals
Seven-week-old male SHR-SR were provided from the
Disease Model Cooperative Research Association (Kyoto,
Japan) and placed on a basal diet. Animals were maintained for at least 7 days before the experiment in a
temperature-regulated room (23 C-25 C) on a 12 hours
light/dark cycle. The rats were fasted but allowed free access to water overnight before surgery.

Ischemia/Reperfusion Model
Transient focal ischemia was induced in rats by right
middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion at 12 weeks of
age (body weight, 260-280 g). Briefly, the rats were anesthetized by inhalation of a 69%/30% (v/v) mixture of
nitrous oxide/oxygen with 1% halothane using a face
mask. A midline neck incision was made, and the right
common carotid artery was exposed. The right MCA
was occluded by insertion of a 4-0 surgical nylon thread
with a silicone coating through the common carotid artery
as described previously.13 Using this technique, the tip of
the thread occludes the origin of the right MCA. During

2647

these procedures, body temperature was monitored
with a rectal probe and was maintained at 37 6 .3 C using
a heating pad. The surgical incision was then closed and
the animals were allowed to recover at room temperature.
After 90 minutes of tMCAO, the suture was removed to
restore blood flow (reperfusion). The animals were kept
at ambient temperature until sampling, with free access
to water and food.

Drug Preparation
On the day of tMCAO (at 12 weeks of age), the above
SHR-SR (n 5 51) were divided into the following 3
groups, that is, the SHR-SR vehicle group (SHR-SR/Ve,
n 5 19), the SHR-SR low-dose telmisartan group in which
blood pressure (BP) did not fall (SHR-SR/Low, n 5 16),
and the SHR-SR high-dose telmisartan group in which
BP fell significantly by 30 mm Hg or more (SHR-SR/
High, n 5 16), receiving daily oral doses of .5% methylcellulose (MC, .1 mL) only, .5% MC plus low-dose telmisartan (.3 mg/kg/day) or .5% MC plus high-dose
telmisartan (3 mg/kg/day) for the subsequent 3, 9, and
15 months, respectively until killed by oral gavage.
The dose of telmisartan was determined as previously
described.14,15 A previous report demonstrated that
the plasma concentration of telmisartan increased in a
dose-dependent manner.16 Telmisartan, which was provided by Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim am Rhein,
Germany), was given to the 2 rat groups as a suspension
with 5% MC in .1 mL of water every day.
At 6, 12, or 18 months of age, the rats were transcardially perfused with 5 U/mL chilled heparinized saline
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer
(pH 7.6) under deep anesthesia with pentobarbital
(20 mg/250 g rat). After decapitation, their brains were
removed. All experimental procedures were approved
by the Animal Committee of the Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry, Okayama University. The present
study focused on IR, PPAR-g, and AT1R in a whole
project aimed at examining the effect of telmisartan on
SHR-SR.17

Immunohistochemistry
After the brains were removed, they were immersed
and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde with .1 M phosphate
buffer (pH 7.6) for 8 hours, embedded in paraffin, and 5
mm-thick sections were prepared for subsequent immunostaining. For IR, PPAR-g, and AT1R immunostaining,
the brain sections were pretreated by heating them 3
times in a 500-week microwave for 5 minutes in 10 mM
(pH 6.0) citric acid buffer. Pretreated sections were then
immersed in .5% periodic acid to block intrinsic peroxidase and treated with 5% normal horse serum in 50 mM
phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing .05%
Tween 20 to block any nonspecific antibody response
and were finally incubated overnight with each primary

2648

antibody. The following primary antibodies were used in
this study: mouse anti-IR monoclonal antibody (1:100;
Millipore, Temecula, CA), mouse anti-PPAR-g monoclonal antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA), and mouse anti-AT1R monoclonal antibody
(1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom). A biotinylated anti-mouse antibody was used as the secondary
antibody, and specific labeling was visualized by a VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA). To
guarantee the specific staining of primary antibodies,
brain sections were also stained without primary antibodies.

Detection and Analyses
The previously mentioned stained sections were digitized with a digital microscope camera (Olympus BX-51;
Olympus Optical Co, Tokyo, Japan). Then the number
of IR-, PPAR-g, and AT1R-positive cells per 1 mm2 of
cerebral cortex in hemispheric coronal sections were
counted at 3 randomized areas.
Data are expressed as mean 6 standard deviation. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance with repeated measures (multiple comparisons).
Planned comparisons were used for the Tukeyâ€“Kramer
post hoc analysis. P less than .05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed with Statcel
statistical package (Statcel 2; OMS Inc, Tokorozawa,
Japan).

Results
Blood Pressure
Systolic blood pressure (SBP) showed no significant differences among all 3 SHR-SR groups at 3 months of age.
The SHR-SR/High group maintained a significantly
lower SBP than the SHR-SR/Ve group at 6, 12, and
18 months (P , .05). Diastolic BP showed a similar
decrease as SBP (P , .01), but heart rate showed no significant differences among the 3 groups. These results were
described in a previous report.17

IR Staining in the Peri-ischemic Lesion
IR was clearly labeled in the cytoplasm of cerebrocortical neurons on the ipsilateral side at 6 months of
age in the SHR-SR/Ve group (Fig 1, A, a), and the number
of positive cells gradually decreased at 12 and 18 months
without displaying significant differences (Fig 1, A, d, g).
In the 2 other telmisartan groups (SHR-SR/Low and
SHR-SR/High), IR was only weakly labeled at 6 months
in the cytoplasm of cerebrocortical neurons (Fig 1, A, b,
c), and the number of positive cells in the cerebral cortex
decreased with age (Fig 1, A, e, f, h, i).
Quantitative analysis showed that the mean number of
IR-positive neurons in 1 mm2 of cerebral cortex in the
SHR-SR/Ve group was 200.1 6 70.1 at 6 months,

at 12 months (**P , .01 vs. SHR-SR/Ve group), and
72.3 6 27.7 at 18 months (*P , .05 vs. SHR-SR/Ve group;
Fig 1, B).

PPAR-g Staining in the Peri-ischemic Lesion
PPAR-g was slightly labeled in the cytoplasm of cerebrocortical neurons on the ipsilateral side at 6 months in
the SHR-SR/Ve group (Fig 2, A, a), which was consistent
at 12 and 18 months (Fig 2, A, d, g). In the 2 other telmisartan groups (SHR-SR/Low and SHR-SR/High),
PPAR-g became strongly labeled in the cytoplasm of cerebrocortical neurons in an age- and dose-dependent
manner at 6 and 12 months (Fig 2, A, b, c, e, f) with a slight
decrease at 18 months (Fig 2, A, h, i).
Quantitative analysis showed that the mean number of
PPAR-gâ€“positive neurons in 1 mm2 of cerebral cortex in
the SHR-SR/Ve group was 175.0 6 49.7 at 6 months,
217.1 6 24.0 at 12 months, and 177.1 6 21.0 at 18 months
and that in the SHR-SR/Low group was 180.4 6 70.8 at
6 months, 277.1 6 62.8 at 12 months, and 204.3 6 50.7 at
18 months and that in the SHR-SR/High group was
307.1 6 55.3 (*P , .05 vs. SHR-SR/Ve group, #P , .05
vs. SHR-SR/Low group) at 6 months, 395.7 6 84.0
(**P , .01 vs. SHR-SR/Ve group, #P , .05 vs. SHR-SR/
Low group) at 12 months, and 304.3 6 61.6 (**P , .01
vs. SHR-SR/Ve group, #P , .05 vs. SHR-SR/Low group)
at 18 months (Fig 2, B).

AT1R Staining in the Peri-ischemic Lesion
AT1R was clearly labeled in both the nucleus and
cytoplasm of cerebrocortical neurons on the ipsilateral
side at 6 months in the SHR-SR/Ve group (Fig 3, A, a),
which retained the same level at 12 and 18 months (Fig
3, A, d, g). In the 2 other telmisartan groups (SHR-SR/
Low and SHR-SR/High), AT1R staining showed a dosedependent decrease at 6-18 months (Fig 3, A, b, c, e, f, h, i).
Quantitative analysis showed that the mean number of
AT1R-positive neurons in 1 mm2 of cerebral cortex in the
SHR-SR/Ve group was 562.5 6 57.3 at 6 months,
538.6 6 104.1 at 12 months, and 560.7 6 95.2 at 18 months
and that in the SHR-SR/Low group was 388.6 6 122.1 at
6 months (*P ,.05 vs. SHR-SR/Ve group), 430.4 6 127.0 at
12 months, and 451.4 6 35.9 at 18 months and that in the
SHR-SR/High group was 314.3 6 19.6 at 6 months
(**P , .01 vs. SHR-SR/Ve group), 350.0 6 42.9 (*P , .05
vs. SHR-SR/Ve group) at 12 months, and 305.7 6 61.7
(**P , .01 vs. SHR-SR/Ve group, #P , .05 vs. SHR-SR/
Low group) at 18 months (Fig 3, B).

Discussion
The present study investigated the long-term change in
metabolic syndrome-related factors such as IR and PPARg and in a renninâ€“angiotensin system-related factor,
AT1R, and in the cerebral cortex of SHR-SR after tMCAO.
The results demonstrated that IR-positive neurons in the
cerebral cortex of SHR-SR significantly decreased in a
dose-dependent manner in response to telmisartan and
decreased moderately in an age-dependent manner
(Fig 1). In addition, PPAR-gâ€“positive neurons showed a
significant increase in a dose-dependent manner with
respect to telmisartan (Fig 2), whereas AT1R-positive neurons significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner,
also with respect to telmisartan (Fig 3). Although previous studies demonstrated an effect on metabolic
syndrome-related factors such as insulin resistance18
and chronic hypertension19 in SHR-SR until 6 months of
age, our present study observed such factors in the

SHR-SR brain after cerebral ischemia with or without telmisartan treatment up to 18 months of age.
Although no significant differences were observed in
the plasma glucose level,20 telmisartan significantly
decreased the plasma insulin level of Otsuka LongEvans Tokushima Fatty rats more than control rats, and
telmisartan also suppressed the plasma insulin level in
humans after glucose loading.21 The present study demonstrates that the long-term administration of telmisartan
dose dependently decreased IR expression in rat cortical
neurons after tMCAO up to 18 months (Fig 1), suggesting
an effect of telmisartan on reducing insulin metabolism
and insulin resistance in the neurons after tMCAO.
Insulin resistance is the most important factor in metabolic syndrome, which is mainly caused by obesity with
the following 3 candidate molecules.22 Circulating free
fatty acids inhibit glucose uptake and use in muscle.23
Tumor necrosis factor a, secreted by adipocytes, inhibits
glucose uptake in muscle,24 causes phosphorylation of

Note a dose-dependent increase of PPAR-gâ€“positive neurons among the vehicle group and the
2 telmisartan groups from 6 to 18 months
(*P , .05, **P , .01 vs. vehicle group, #P , .05

IR substrate 1 on serine residues,25 and downregulates
glucose transporter isoform 4.26 Finally, the elevated
serum level of leptin also causes insulin resistance.27
Several ARBs increase PPAR-g activity in adipose tissue,9
thus improving glucose homeostasis by affecting the previously mentioned 3 molecules. Telmisartan is one ARB,
but is characterized by the strong activation of PPARg.11 The present study demonstrates that the long-term
administration of telmisartan dose dependently potentiated PPAR-g expression in rat cortical neurons after
tMCAO (Fig 2).
AT1R affects cardiovascular, renal, neuronal, endocrine, hepatic, and other target cells, which include the
regulation of arterial BP, electrolyte and water balance,
thirst, hormone secretion, and renal function.28 Furthermore, ARBs or selective AT1R antagonists improved
endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling in clin-

ical and experimental hypertension.29-34 Among all ARBs,
telmisartan has the strongest binding affinity to AT1R31;
thus, long-term administration of telmisartan dose
dependently suppressed the expression of AT1R in the
neurons of the rat cortex after ischemia for a long period
of time (Fig 3). In addition, our previous study showed
that AT1R was upregulated in neuronal cells at 24 hours
after tMCAO in the Zucker metabolic syndrome rat
brain.35 Such activation of AT1R was markedly improved
in amlodipine, atorvastatin, and their combination therapy, resulting in the protection of the ischemic brain.35
The inhibition of AT1R may play a pivotal role not only
in antiatherogenic action36 but also in neuroprotection after cerebral ischemia (Fig 3).
Although a previous report demonstrated a primary effect of telmisartan on the antiatherosclerosis through the
activation of PPAR-g and a blockade of AT1R,37 the

present study further showed a direct protective effect on
cerebrocortical neurons under chronic hypertension after
tMCAO in SHR-SR both through the activation of PPAR-g
and the suppression of AT1R up to 18 months (Figs 2, 3).
The present data may be consistent with our recent results
on the reduction of amyloid b, phosphorylated tau, and asynuclein in the same animal model.17,38 Although
downregulation of IR in skeletal muscle causes insulin
resistance,39 the present study showed that long-term
administration of telmisartan dose dependently suppressed IR expression in rat cortical neurons after tMCAO
up to 18 months (Fig 1).
The SHR-SR/High group kept a significantly lower
SBP and diastolic BP than the SHR-SR/Ve group at 6,
12, and 18 months in the present study.17 Although temporal profiles of cerebral blood flow were not monitored
in this study, a previous report demonstrated that cerebral

blood flow autoregulation was significantly maintained
in SHR administered both a low and high dose of telmisartan.14 Moreover, telmisartan showed good antihypertensive activity in hypertensive human patients with
chronic-stage stroke without affecting hemispheric blood
flow.40 This study might show that telmisartan can
continue to ameliorate both hypertension and metabolic
abnormalities by affecting IR, PPAR-g, and AT1R at a
low dose simply by improving metabolic syndrome and
at a high dose by improving both metabolic syndrome
and hypertension. Recent data suggest that Alzheimer
disease represents molecular and biochemical features
related to the activation of PPAR-g and AT1R within the
brain.41 The present findings provide evidence that telmisartan ameliorated metabolic syndrome-related changes
in the poststroke brain of SHR-SR (Figs 1-3), accounting
for the preventive role in the progression of dementia

2652

via amyloid b, phosphorylated tau, and a-synuclein
protein in long-living hypertensive rats.17,38
