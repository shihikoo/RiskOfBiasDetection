Abstract Telmisartan is expected to reduce not only the level
of blood pressure but also neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity via pleiotrophic effects as a metabo-sartan. We examined
the effects of telmisartan on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology in spontaneously hypertensive rat stroke resistant (SHRSR) after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO)
by giving either telmisartan at 0 (vehicle), 0.3 mg/kg/day (low
dose, with no reduction of blood pressure), or 3 mg/kg/day
(high dose, with a significant reduction of blood pressure) p.o.
from 3 months (M) of age, and performed immunohistological
analysis at 6, 12, and 18 M of age. The numbers of amyloid β
(Aβ)-positive neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus
and senile plaque (SP) in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex progressively increased with age until 18 M in the SHR-SR after
tMCAO. On the other hand, low-dose telmisartan significantly reduced the number of Aβ-positive neuron as well as SP at
6, 12, and 18 M. High-dose telmisartan showed further reductions of the above AD pathology. The present study suggests
that telmisartan reduced both intracellular Aβ and extracellular SP accumulations after tMCAO in SHR-SR, with a further
improvement by combined BP lowering. Such a strong effect
of telmisartan could provide a preventative approach for AD
in post-stroke patients with hypertension.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common dementia in
aged population, which is neuropathologically characterized
by abnormal accumulations of senile plaque (SP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that are mainly consisted of amyloid-β
peptide (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (pτ), respectively. Recent
studies suggested that stroke and a factor of metabolic syndrome such as hypertension and dyslipidemia is an important
risk factor of AD [1–3] via promoting inflammatory responses
[4, 5]. We have reported that anti-hyperlipidemic statin reduced
the numbers of senile plaques with reducing inflammatory
responses in AD model mice [6, 7].
Spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) develops not only
chronic hypertension [8] but also metabolic syndrome [9],
immune alterations [10], and progressive neurobehavioral
impairment [11]. In fact, SHR displayed a typical AD pathology such as pτ, NFTs, and neuroinflammation [12, 13]. Some
antihypertensive drugs prevented a cognitive decline or an
incidence of dementia [14, 15], among which angiotensin
receptor blockers (ARBs) showed superior effects on cognitive function [16] with the pleiotrophic effects against neuroinflammation and vascular remodeling [17, 18]. Telmisartan is
a highly selective angiotensin type 1 (AT-1) antagonist of
angiotensin 2 receptor with high lipid solubility [19, 20] and
improves metabolic abnormalities of not only hypertension
but also insulin resistance and dyslipidemia [21–24].
There has been, however, no report on the long-term effect
of telmisartan in relation to chronic hypertension, stroke, and
progressive dementia model of rats such as spontaneously
hypertensive rat stroke resistant (SHR-SR) after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). We therefore examined the effects of telmisartan on dyslipidemia and Alzheimer
pathology in SHR-SR with tMCAO in both doses, i.e., low
dose just for pleiotrophic effect which improved metabolic

syndrome of rats and high dose for both improving and
hypertension and pleiotropic effect which improved metabolic
syndrome of rats.

Animal Committee of the Graduate School of Medicine and
Dentistry, Okayama University.
Physical Parameters and Serum Substances

Materials and Methods
Animals and Drug Preparation
Seven-week-old male SHR-SRs were provided by the Disease
Model Cooperative Research Association (Kyoto, Japan) and
placed on a basal diet.
When the rats reached 3 months (M) of age (body weight
250–280 g), the above SHR-SRs were anesthetized with a
nitrous oxide/oxygen/isoflurane mixture (69:30:1 %) during
surgical preparation. The right middle cerebral artery (MCA)
was occluded by insertion of a 4-0 surgical nylon thread with
silicon coating through the common carotid artery as described previously [25]. Body temperature was maintained at
37±0.3 °C using a heating pad during the surgical procedure
for transient MCA occlusion (tMCAO). Eighty percent of the
operated animals showed gait disturbance following tMCAO.
Asymptomatic rats were excluded from the experiment. After
90 min of tMCAO, cerebral blood flow (CBF) was restored by
removing the nylon thread. After the incision was closed, the
animals were kept at ambient temperature until sampling with
free access to water and food.
Immediately following MCAO, the above SHR-SRs (n=
50) were divided into the following three groups as treatment
groups, i.e., SHR-SR vehicle group (SHR/Ve, n=14), SHRSR low-dose telmisartan group in which the blood pressure
did not fall significantly (SHR/low, n=15), and SHR-SR highdose telmisartan group in which the blood pressure fell by
30 mmHg or more (SHR/high, n=21), receiving daily oral
doses of 0.5 % methylcellulose (MC) in 0.1 ml water only
(SHR-SR vehicle group), 0.5 % MC plus low-dose
telmisartan (0.3 mg/kg/day), or 0.5 % MC plus high-dose
telmisartan (3 mg/kg/day) for the subsequent 3–18 M by oral
gavage, respectively. The dose of telmisartan was determined
as previously described [26, 27]. Telmisartan was provided by
Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany) and
was given to the two rat groups as a suspension with 5 % MC
in 0.1 ml water every day.
At 6, 12, or 18 M of age, the physical parameters and serum
levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (T-CHO), and
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-CHO) were measured by collecting 1 ml of blood from the internal jugular
vein under a nitrous oxide/oxygen/isoflurane mixture (69/30/
1 %) anesthesia. Under deep anesthesia with pentobarbital
(20 mg/250 g rat), the rats were then transcardially perfused
with 5 U/ml of chilled heparinized saline followed by 4 %
paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB). After decapitation, their brains were removed and the brain weights were

As physical parameters, body weight (BW) and brain weight
(BrW) were measured at 3, 6, 12, or 18 M and 6, 12, or 18 M,
respectively, by a portable balance (Sartorius Mechatronics,
Goettingen, Germany). Blood pressure (BP) was also measured using a BP monitor (MK-1030, Muromachi Kikai Co.,
Ltd.) at 3, 6, 12, or 18 M. Serum levels of TG, T-CHO, and
LDL-C were measured by a standard biochemical method in
SRL, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan).
Immunohistochemistry
After measuring BrW, the brains were immersed and fixed in
4 % paraformaldehyde with 0.1 M PB (pH 7.6) for 8 h and
embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm-thick sections were prepared
for subsequent immunostaining. For Aβ immunostaining, the
brain sections were pretreated with formic acid for 3 min.
These pretreated sections were then immersed in 0.5 % periodic acid to block the intrinsic peroxidase, were treated with
5 % normal horse serum in 50 mM phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS, pH 7.4) containing 0.05 % Tween 20 to block any nonspecific antibody response, and were finally incubated overnight with each primary antibody. The monoclonal antibody
4G8 (1:1,000, Signet, Dedham, MA, USA) was used for Aβ
immunostaining in this study. A biotinylated anti-mouse antibody for Aβ was used as the secondary antibody, and specific
labeling was visualized by a Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector,
Burlingame, CA, USA). To guarantee the specific staining of
the primary antibody, brain sections were also stained without
the primary antibody.
Detection and Analyses
The above stained sections were digitized using a digital
microscope camera (Olympus BX-51; Olympus Optical Co.,
Japan). Then the numbers of Aβ-positive neuron and the area
of Aβ-positive senile plaque per each 1 mm2 cerebral cortex
in ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheric coronal sections of
MCAO lesion were counted at three levels (frontal cortex,
basal ganglia, and posterior hippocampus). Three serial sections were used for each level, and all cell counts in the
cerebral cortex per animal were determined and added.
Furthermore, Aβ-positive neuron was quantified by counting
the stained cells in CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus
and expressed as the percentage of Aβ-positive neuron over
the total number of neurons in those regions.
Data are expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were
performed using ANOVA with repeated measures (multiple

comparisons). Planned comparisons were used for Tukey–
Kramer post hoc analysis. A value of p<0.05 was considered
significant. All statistical analyses were performed using
Statcel statistical package (Statcel 2; OMS Inc., Tokorozawa,
Japan).

Result
Physical Parameters
At 3 M of age, BW in two telmisartan groups was significantly
lower than SHR/Ve group (p<0.01). At 12 and 18 M, BW
increased, but there was no significant difference among the
all three SHR-SR groups (Table 1). There was also no significant difference in BrW among all three SHR-SR groups at 6,
12, and 18 M. However, BrW of the SHR/high group was
saved compared with those of SHR/Ve and SHR/low groups
at 6, 12, and 18 M (Table 1), and the infarct defect was smaller
in SHR/high group compared with SHR/Ve and SHR/low
groups at 20 M (Fig. 1, arrowheads).
There is no significant difference of systolic BP (SBP)
among all three SHR-SR groups at 3 M of age. SHR/high
group kept a significantly lower SBP than the SHR/Ve group
at 6, 12, and 18 M (p<0.05). Diastolic BP (DBP) showed a

In the two telmisartan groups, Aβ was scarcely labeled in the
cytoplasm of cerebrocortical neurons at 6 M, which slightly
increased at 12 and 18 M (Fig. 2a, b). The numbers of Aβpositive neurons of ipsilateral cerebral cortex in the SHR/low
group were 87.4±18.7/mm2 (p<0.01 vs SHR/Ve) at 6 M, 88.7±
28.0/mm2 at 12 M, and 97.7±35.9/mm2 (p<0.01 vs SHR/Ve) at

number of Aβ-positive neurons in the SHR/high group
tended to be lower than SHR/low group, but there was
no significant difference between each group at any age.

Aβ Staining in the Hippocampus
In SHR/Ve group, Aβ-positive neurons were slightly detected
at 6 M in the cytoplasm of hippocampal CA1 neurons, which
became stronger in both ipsilateral and contralateral sides at
12 and 18 M (Fig. 3a, b(a,d,g)). In the two telmisartan groups,
Aβ was more weakly labeled at 6 M in the cytoplasm of

112

hippocampal CA1 neurons compared with the SHR/Ve group
(Fig. 3a, b(a–c)), which became a little stronger at 12 and
18 M. The staining strength was always weaker in the contralateral side than the ipsilateral side (Fig. 3a vs Fig 3b).
The ratios of Aβ-positive neuron in ipsilateral hippocampal CA1 sector were 0.48±0.09 in the SHR/Ve group, 0.18±
0.04 in the SHR/low group (p<0.01 vs SHR/Ve), and 0.09±

The ratios of Aβ-positive neuron in the contralateral hippocampal CA1 sector were 0.25±0.12 in the SHR/Ve group,
0.15±0.06 in the SHR/low group, and 0.07±0.04 in the SHR/

Senile Plaque in the Periischemic Lesion
Senile plaques (SPs) were weakly detectable in the
periischemic cerebral cortex at 6 M (Fig. 4a(a, arrowheads)),
which spread progressively with age at 12 and 18 M

Transl. Stroke Res. (2015) 6:107–115

(Fig. 4a(d,g)). On the other hand, such SPs were not detected
in two telmisartan groups at 6 M (Fig. 4a(b,c)), which then
became detectable only in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex of
periischemic lesion at 12 and 18 M (Fig. 4a(e–j)).
Quantitative analysis showed that the sums of each SP size
in 1 mm2 of the ipsilateral cerebral cortex were 1.01±1.42×
103 μm2 in the SHR/Ve group and 0 μm2 in the two
telmisartan groups at 6 M (Fig. 4b). At 12 M, the sums of
each SP size were 1.31±1.83×103 μm2 in the SHR/Ve group,
0.36±0.72×103 μm2 in the SHR/low group, and 0.33±0.39×
103 μm2 in the SHR/high group (Fig. 4b). At 18 M, the sums
of each SP size were 2.21±0.91×103 μm2 in the SHR/Ve
group, 0.88±0.48×103 μm2 in the SHR/low group, and
0.62 ±0.21 × 103 μm2 in the SHR/high group(p< 0.05 vs
SHR/Ve) (Fig. 4b). The two telmisartan groups showed no
significant difference to each other.

Discussion
This is the first report that examined the long-term effect of
telmisartan for reducing the amyloid pathology in SHR-SRs
up to 18 M of age. In the present study, the treatment of
telmisartan reduced the numbers of Aβ-positive neurons both
in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Fig. 3). Telmisartan
also reduced SP in ipsilateral cerebral cortex even without
lowering the blood pressure (SHR/low), which was further
improved with lowering blood pressure (SHR/high). There
results suggest that a low-dose telmisartan prevented Aβ
accumulation probably due to its anti-inflammatory effect
and that a high-dose telmisartan showed a better improvement
through its additive antihypertensive action (Figs. 2, 3, and 4).
A strong association among hypertension, stroke, and AD
has been reported in previous studies [1–5, 28, 29].
Antihypertensive treatment by ARB prevented a cognitive
decline through a mechanism beyond the reduction of both
BP and the risk of stroke [30]. Among ARBs, telmisartan is
highly lipid soluble and penetrates more to the brain [19, 20],
and thus a special protective effect is expected against both
ischemic brain damage and dementia.
In addition to hypertension, SHR model is also characterized by cognitive impairment [12]. Recent studies suggest that
an intracellular accumulation of Aβ may be an early event in
the pathogenesis of AD and Down syndrome [31, 32]. In the
present study, the intracellular Aβ was already detected at 6 M
(Fig. 2); otherwise, SP was detected weakly at 6 M (Fig. 4),
suggesting that the intracellular Aβ accumulation was promoted by either or both of hypertension and stroke as an early
event in the progression of AD pathology. By treatment of
telmisartan, intracellular Aβ accumulation was significantly
reduced with or without lowering blood pressure in the cerebral cortical neurons from 6 M (Fig. 2) and SP accumulation at
18 M (Fig. 4), suggesting that telmisartan ameliorated Aβ

113

accumulation from early to late stages in the cerebral cortex
after tMCAO.
Both animal and human studies demonstrated an association between ARB treatment and preservation of cognitive
function [16, 30, 33–36], and telmisartan in fact improved
memory impairment with reducing neural apoptosis in the
hippocampus [37, 38]. In present study, the numbers of Aβpositive neurons of two telmisartan groups were significantly
lower than SHR/Ve group in ipsilateral hippocampal CA1
sector from 6 to 18 M (Fig. 3). Such a protective effect of
telmisartan on hippocampal neurons could account for the
clinical improvement of the cognitive function.
ARBs showed superior effects on cognitive function with
the pleiotrophic effects [16–18], in which telmisartan improved metabolic abnormalities of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia as well as hypertension [21–24]. As to lipid profiles,
Derosa et al. described that telmisartan decreased all of TCHO, LDL-CHO, and TG in patients with mild hypertension
[39], but other study described that TG was significantly
reduced, while total T-CHO was unchanged [40]. In this study,
we also examined about lipid profiles, but no significant
difference was found among the three SHR-SR groups
(Table 2). However, we detected the reductions of intracellular
Aβ and extracellular SP accumulations in SHR/low group
(without BP reduction) as well as in SHR/high group (with
BP reduction) (Figs. 2, 3, and 4), suggesting that telmisartan is
effective by pleiotropic effects other than the effect for dyslipidemia in this study. The effect is even stronger with combined BP lowering.
In summary, telmisartan reduced both intracellular Aβ and
extracellular SP accumulations via its pleiotropic effects with
a further improvement by combining BP lowering after
tMCAO in SHR-SRs. Such a strong effect of telmisartan
could provide a preventative approach for AD in post-stroke
patients with hypertension.
