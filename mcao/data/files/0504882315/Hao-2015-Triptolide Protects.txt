Triptolide Protects Against Ischemic Stroke in Rats
Maolin Hao,1,3 Xianghua Li,2 Jianli Feng,1 and Ning Pan1

Abstract—Inflammatory response plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke and
anti-inflammatory agents may provide a choice of treatment. Triptolide is reported to be antiinflammatory. In this study, we investigated the effects of triptolide on cultured neuronal cell line
in vitro and experimental ischemic stroke in vivo. Oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) and tumor
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) stimulated SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with triptolide. In vivo, rats were
subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1 h, followed by reperfusion for 23 h. Results
of this study showed that triptolide treatment reduced the OGD-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis and
blocked TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB and p38MAPK in SH-SY5Y cells. Intraperitoneal injection of triptolide showed significant neuroprotective actions in stroke rats. Triptolide attenuated neurological deficit, brain infarct volume, and brain water content, and inhibited activation of NF-κB and
p38MAPK. These data show that triptolide protects rats against ischemic cerebral injury via inhibiting
NF-κB and p38MAPK signaling pathways.

the effect of triptolide in ischemic stroke has not been
investigated yet. In this study, we tested the effects of
triptolide on cultured neuronal cell line and rat ischemic
stroke.

INTRODUCTION
Stroke, a major cause of death and impairment in
humans, is the third leading cause of death in industrialized
countries and the most common cause of permanent disability in adults globally [1]. Stroke is a constantly expanding area of research. Surviving patients demonstrate significant risk for the development of new acute neurological
symptoms and death [2]. The mechanisms that trigger
ischemic brain damage are complex, but inflammatory
response has been considered as a key element in ischemic
stroke of both animals and human [3, 4].
Triptolide is extracted from Tripterygium wilfordii,
which is a traditional Chinese medicine and exhibits immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tumor activities [5–7]. Triptolide exhibits anti-inflammatory activities
in cultured lung cells and in rat models with chlorineinduced acute lung injury [8]. However, to our knowledge,

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Triptolide was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.
(St. Louis, MO, USA), with purity of more than 98 %. The
human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y was purchased
from American type culture collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA, USA).
Cell Culture
SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) solutions (Gibco Laboratories,
Grand Island, NY, USA), supplemented with 10 % fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island,
NY, USA). Cells were kept at 37 °C in a humidified 5 %
CO2 incubator. The dissociated cells were seeded in poly5
2
L-lysine-coated plates at a density of 5 × 10 /cm and
cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine
serum. The medium was changed twice weekly. After

8 days of culture, SH-SY5Y cells were randomly divided
into seven groups: normal group (no oxygen–glucose deprivation), oxygen–glucose deprivation group (control
group), and oxygen–glucose deprivation + triptolide (dissolved in DMSO, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 ng/ml) groups. For
oxygen–glucose deprivation, the SH-SY5Y cells were
washed twice in glucose-free balanced salt solution
(BSS), and incubated in BSS (glucose-free) in a humidified
chamber filled with 95 % N2/5 % CO2 for 3 h at 36.5 °C,
while the normal group and triptolide group (no oxygen–
glucose deprivation) filled with 5 % CO2/95 % O2 and
incubated in glucose-free BSS. After oxygen–glucose deprivation, the cultures were replaced into neurobasal medium and incubated with triptolide in a CO2 incubator for
12 h.

reperfusion as described before [10]. The vehicletreated group received 1 % phosphate buffered saline
(PBS)/DMSO. Neurological deficits were determined
at 24 h after ischemia followed by brain infarct
volume examination.

Determination of Cell Viability and Apoptosis

Evaluation of Infarct Volume and Brain Water Content

After oxygen–glucose deprivation for 3 h followed by
12-h incubation with or without triptolide, cell viability
was assessed using 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Genebase,
Shanghai, China). Apoptotic cells were evaluated using
an Annexin-V FITC apoptosis detection kit (Genebase,
Shanghai, China). In brief, cells were harvested, washed,
and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min in the dark with annexinV FITC and propidium iodide, then analyzed on a FACS
Vantage SE flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, USA).

After 23-h reperfusion, rats were anesthetized
with sodium pentobarbital through intraperitoneal injection. The adequacy of anesthesia was monitored
by the level and stability of the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and absence of the corneal reflex, and
adequate levels of anesthesia and analgesia were ensured with supplemental intraperitoneal injection of
pentobarbital sodium given as required, then brains
were quickly removed. The total wet weight of the
brain was measured accurately. The starting site of
the brain was cut at forebrain 3 mm, and each brain
was sliced into sections of 2-mm thickness each, then
stained with a 2 % solution of tetrazolium chloride
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in saline at 37 °C for
10 min, and photographed. The images were digitized, and infarct volume was calculated with a Compix system computer. Then, brain water content was
determined as an indicator of cerebral edema using a
wet/dry method.

Induction of Rat Cerebral Ischemia and Treatments
All the experiments were approved by our Animal
Care Committee. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (250–280 g)
were supplied by the Animal Center of our University and
maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark regime. All rats were
provided with food and water ad libitum. The animals were
acclimatized to the laboratory conditions for 7 days before
surgery. Animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 10 % chloral hydrate. Rectal temperature was
recorded and maintained at 37 °C throughout the surgical
procedure. The rats were subjected to middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) by intraluminal placement of a
filament as described previously [9]. Sham-operated rats
(n = 10) were subjected only to exposure of the MCA
without coagulation. Anesthesia duration was similar in
all groups.
The mortality rate after the surgery was nearly
20 % and we chose the surviving rats for further
experiments. Rats were randomly divided into two
groups with ten rats each. Rats received intraperitoneal 1.0 mg/kg triptolide (dissolved in DMSO) after

Evaluation of Neurological Deficits
Neurological deficits were evaluated using a 0–5
scoring system [11] by an investigator who was
blinded to each experimental group: 0, no neurological deficits (normal); 1, failure to extend left forepaw fully; 2, circling to the left; 3, falling to the left;
4, no spontaneous walking with a depressed level of
consciousness, and 5, death.

Evaluation of Blood–Brain Barrier Leakage
with Evans Blue Extravasation
Determination of Evans blue extravasation was
based on a previous method [12]. After reperfusion,
0.1 ml of 4 % Evans blue in saline was administered
via tail vein. Twenty-three hours after ischemia, rats
were anesthetized with chloral hydrate then perfused
with 20 ml 10 U/ml heparinized saline to wash out
the blood. The brain was then isolated, weighed, and
homogenized in 50 % solution of trichloroacetic acid
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). After centrifugation at
600g for 15 min, the supernatant was

spectrophotometrically measured at 490 nm. Cerebral
Evans blue was quantified as micrograms of dye per
gram of wet weight.

Western Blot
For the experiment of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) stimulated SH-SY5Y cell lines in vitro, SH-SY5Y cells
(5×106) were pre-incubated with triptolide (40 ng/ml) for
12 h, then incubated with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 30 min.
Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS on ice and
lysed in cell lysis buffer (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA).
For western blot analysis, brains were harvested and the
right hemispheres containing the ischaemic sites were excised
and nuclear and cytosolic extracts of cells or tissues were
isolated using the NE-PER kit (Life Technologies, Foster
City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Equal amounts of cell protein (50 μg) were separated by
SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using specific
antibodies to NF-κBp65 (polyclonal rabbit, Cat No.

RESULTS
Triptolide Protected Cultured SH-SY5Y Cells
Against Oxygen–Glucose Deprivation-Induced
Cytotoxicity and Apoptosis
The MTT assay was used to assess the effect of
triptolide on the oxygen–glucose deprivation-induced
cytotoxicity and we found that cell viability was markedly
decreased after oxygen–glucose deprivation for 3 h followed by 12-h incubation with neurobasal medium
(Fig. 1a). In contrast, the cytotoxicity was significantly
attenuated by triptolide (5–80 ng/ml) treatment in a
concentration-dependent manner. To further investigate
the protective effect of triptolide, apoptosis was estimated
by flow cytometric analysis of annexin-V and propidium
iodide-labeling cells. The oxygen–glucose deprivation for
3 h followed by 12-h incubation with neurobasal medium
significantly increased the apoptosis (Fig. 1b). Triptolide
(5–80 ng/ml) for 12 h arrested the apoptosis in a
concentration-dependent manner.

Triptolide Inhibited Activation of NF-κB
and p38MAPK in Cultured SH-SY5Y Cells
After TNF-α (20 ng/ml) stimulation for 30 min, NFκB and p38MAPK were both significantly activated in SHSY5Y cells. We compared the effect of triptolide on the
TNF-α-induced (20 ng/ml for 30 min) activation of NF-κB
and p38MAPK in the SH-SY5Y cells. As shown in Fig. 1,
40 ng/ml triptolide showed the best effectiveness, and we
chose this concentration for the following experiments. We
found that 40 ng/ml triptolide pretreatment blocked the
TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB and p38MAPK
(Fig. 2).
Triptolide Reduced Neurological Deficit Scores, Brain
Infarct Volume, and Brain Water Content in Stroke
Rats
Cerebral ischemic injury results in behavioral disturbance and histological changes in MCAO rats, showing
that ischemic region was white and non-ischemic region
was red. Compared with the sham-operated rats, neurological deficit scores, the ischemic regions and brain water
content were significantly increased in rats with experimental stroke. Our results showed that triptolide (1.0 mg/

kg) after reperfusion immediately decreased neurological
deficit scores, cerebral infarct volume, and brain water
content (Fig. 3).
Triptolide Reduced Blood–Brain Barrier Breakdown
in Stroke Rats
Evans blue extravasation was used to assess blood–
brain barrier (BBB) breakdown after cerebral ischemia.
Vehicle-treated rats showed elevated Evans blue extravasation compared with the sham-operated rats. In contrast,
our results showed that triptolide significantly attenuated
Evans blue extravasation (Fig. 4).
Triptolide Inhibited NF-κB and p38MAPK Activation
in Stroke Rats
In order to investigate the molecular mechanism of
triptolide, NF-κB and p38MAPK activation was examined. Activation of NF-κB and p38MAPK was significantly increased in rats after cerebral ischemia. However, triptolide treatment reduced nuclear NF-κBp65 and pp38MAPK, indicating that triptolide blocked activation
of NF-κB and p38MAPK in stroke rats (Fig. 5).

DISCUSSION
It is well established that MCAO is a classical model
of cerebral ischemia [13]. In this study, we showed that
triptolide improved neurological dysfunction, reduced infarct size, and BBB permeability after MCAO. These
protective effects might be mediated via inhibiting NFκB and MAPK signaling pathways.

A growing body of evidence has implicated inflammatory response as a key role in secondary ischemic brain
damage and that inflammatory response leads to ischemic
brain damage, occurring within minutes after onset of
cerebral ischemia [14, 15]. Accumulating data suggest that
NF-κB and p38MAPK are an important transcription factors responsible for inflammatory response in stroke [16,
17]. Anti-inflammatory treatment reduces the ischemic
brain diseases via downregulating NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways [16, 17]. The activation of NF-κB is
upregulated in ischemic stroke and contributes to cerebral
injury induced by ischemia [18]. Inhibition of NF-κB
activation attenuates inflammatory response [19]. Also,
p38MAPK pathway may promote BBB disruption with
secondary vasogenic edema after ischemia-reperfusion injury and inhibitor of p38MAPK can result in a reduction in
BBB disruption, edema formation, and infarct volume
[20].
T. wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat autoimmune and

1622
inflammatory diseases for centuries [21, 22]. Triptolide, a
purified component of TwHF, accounts for its major
bioactive effect. Clinical trials have shown the safety
and efficacy of triptolide in treating patients with
rheumatoid arthritis and other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases [23, 24]. As shown in the present and in previous studies, triptolide inhibited the
activation and the expression of NF-κB in vitro and
in vivo [25, 26]. NF-κB is a pleiotropic transcription
factor that controls the expression of several target
genes, mainly of them involved in inflammation. The
NF-κB activation led to the increased expression of
inflammatory mediators, including pro-inflammatory
cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β), which contributed to the
recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells
(macrophages, T lymphocytes). Of particular interest
in this study is the identification of molecular mechanism by which triptolide inhibits ischemic stroke.
Triptolide protects brain against ischemic cerebral
injury via alleviating BBB breakdown.
In summary, results of this study demonstrate that
triptolide reduced neurological deficit scores, brain infarct
volume, and brain water content in rats. Further data show
that triptolide protects the brain against ischemic cerebral
injury via alleviating BBB breakdown, which may be
mediated via inhibiting NF-κB and MAPK pathways.
Our findings indicate that triptolide can be regarded as a
potential candidate for treatment of ischemic stroke.
