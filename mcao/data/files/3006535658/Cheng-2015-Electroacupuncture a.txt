Abstract
Background: This study aimed to determine the effects of electroacupuncture stimulation at the Baihui (GV20) and
Fengfu (GV16) acupoints, at frequencies of 5Hz (EA-5Hz) and 25Hz (EA-25Hz), 7 days after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion
(I/R) injury, and to evaluate the possible signaling mechanisms involved in mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathways.
Methods: Rats were subjected to 30 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) followed by 7 days of reperfusion.
EA-5Hz or EA-25Hz was applied immediately after MCAo and then once daily for 7 consecutive days.
Results: Results indicated that EA-5Hz and EA-25Hz both markedly attenuated cerebral infarction and neurological
deficits. EA-5Hz and EA-25Hz both markedly downregulated cytosolic glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), mitochondrial
Bax, mitochondrial and cytosolic second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspase/direct inhibitor of apoptosis
protein-binding protein with low isoelectric point (Smac/DIABLO), and cytosolic cleaved caspase-3 expression,
and effectively restored cytosolic phospho-p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK), cytosolic cAMP response element-binding
protein (CREB), mitochondrial Bcl-xL, and cytosolic X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) expression, in the
ischemic cortical penumbra 7 days after reperfusion. Both EA-5Hz and EA-25Hz also significantly increased the ratios of
mitochondrial Bcl-xL/Bax and Bcl-2/Bax, respectively.
Conclusions: Both EA-5Hz and EA-25Hz effectively downregulate reactive astrocytosis to provide neuroprotection
against cerebral infarction, most likely by activating the p38 MAPK/CREB signaling pathway. The modulating effects of
EA-5Hz and EA-25Hz on Bax-mediated apoptosis are possibly due to the activation of p38 MAPK/CREB/Bcl-xL and p38
MAPK/CREB/Bcl-2 signaling pathways, respectively, and eventually contribute to the prevention of Smac/DIABLO
translocation and subsequent restoration of XIAP-mediated suppression of caspase-3 in the cortical periinfarct
area 7 days after reperfusion.

Background
Apoptosis in the penumbra, occurring through various
signaling pathways, is considered the major cause of
cerebral infarct expansion following ischemia-reperfusion
(I/R) injury [1, 2]. Mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPKs), including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2), and p38
MAPK, are mediators of various cellular signaling pathways in response to extracellular apoptotic stimuli and
intracellular oxidative stress after transient focal cerebral
ischemia [3, 4]. MAPKs might play roles in the regulation
of cell death and survival, depending on the cell type and
cerebral ischemic model [5]. Studies have reported that
p38 MAPK activation initiates glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity after focal cerebral ischemia, and that selective
inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling cascades provides
neuroprotection against cerebral I/R injury [3, 6]. Studies
have also indicated that p38 MAPK activation upregulates
the expression of the cAMP response element-binding
protein (CREB)-regulated cell survival proteins Bcl-2
and Bcl-xL in cerebral ischemic preconditioning
models [7–9]. The Bcl-2 family proteins, including
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bax, play pivotal roles in regulating
mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. Neuronal
death or survival is determined by the balance
between proapoptotic (Bax) and antiapoptotic (Bcl-2
and Bcl-xL) proteins during cerebral ischemia [10, 11].
Studies have suggested that Bax heterodimerization
with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL is essential for antiapoptotic activity in the central nervous system [11]. Following activation of the apoptotic signaling cascade after cerebral
I/R injury, Bax/Bcl-2 and Bax/Bcl-xL heterodimers are
rapidly dissociated, and the monomeric form of Bax
translocates from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane, where it is cross-linked as a Bax homodimer, and
opens the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.
Pore opening leads to the release of cytochrome c and second mitochondrial-derived activator of caspase (Smac)/
direct inhibitor of apoptosis -binding protein with low
isoelectric point (DIABLO) from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol [10, 12]. The release
of cytochrome c and dATP-dependent formation of
apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1)/caspase9 complex (apoptosome) then initiates the activation of
downstream effector caspases [13]. The inhibitor of
apoptosis protein (IAP) family members, including Xlinked IAP (XIAP), c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and Survivin, participate in apoptosis regulation by directly binding to
caspases (−3, −7, and −9). Of all IAP family members,
XIAP has the most potent antiapoptotic properties
[14]. During cerebral ischemia, mature Smac/DIABLO
interacts with XIAP in the cytosol, which abrogates the
anticaspase function of XIAP and triggers caspase-3
dependent apoptosis [15].

Electroacupuncture (EA) combines traditional acupuncture and modern electrotherapy, and is effective
at treating various ailments, including stroke [16]. Studies
have shown that EA stimulation at acupoints at various
frequencies exerts neuroprotective effects against cerebral
I/R injury by activating ERK1/2 [17–19] or p38 MAPK
signaling [20]. According to traditional Chinese medicine
theory, the Baihui (GV20) and Fengfu (GV16) acupoints
both lie on the Governing Vessel, which connects directly
to the brain. These acupoints are commonly used to treat
brain disorders. In Lu et al. (2010), EA stimulation at
Fengfu and Fengchi (GB20) acupoints, at a frequency of
2/15Hz, provided neuroprotective effects by downregulating S100β-mediated neurotoxicity during craniocerebral
tumor resection [21]. In studies on experimental stroke
rats, EA stimulation at the Baihui acupoint (2/15Hz) reduced glutamate toxicity [22] and exerted antiapoptotic
effects by increasing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio [16] during
the acute phase, and EA stimulation (3Hz) improved
behavioral performance by increasing brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) production [23] during
the subacute phase after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Tian et al. (2013) demonstrated that
EA stimulation at the Baihui, Mingmen (GV4), and
Zusanli (S36) acupoints (30/50Hz) provided neuroprotection against brain edema through the activation of
Na+, K+-ATPase in rats after transient global cerebral
ischemia [24].
Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the
effects of EA stimulation at the Baihui and Fengfu acupoints (EA at acupoints), at a frequency of 5 or 25Hz,
after 30 min of cerebral ischemia followed by 7 days of
reperfusion, and to evaluate the possible involvement of
MAPK cascades in the ischemic cortical penumbra.

Methods
Experimental animals

Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats weighing 300–350 g
(aged approximately 8–9 weeks) were used in experiments. They were maintained at a humidity of 55 % ±
5 % on a 12 h light–dark cycle, at 22 ± 2 °C. All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with
the ethical guidelines approved by the China Medical
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(Permit Number: 102-249-c), and the committee recognized that the study design and proposed experimental
procedures followed the Animal Protection Law by the
Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, Taiwan. All the
experimental procedures involving animals avoided or
minimized discomfort, pain, and stress in animals.
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion

The MCAo model was established in the SD rats by using
intraluminal suture methods as described previously [25].

Cheng et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2015) 15:241

Briefly, the rats were anesthetized with a 5 % isofluraneoxygen mixture, maintained on a 2 % isoflurane-oxygen
mixture, and the right distal middle cerebral artery (MCA)
was exposed through a cranial burr hole (2.5 mm lateral
and 2.0 mm posterior to the bregma). After dissection, the
right common carotid artery (CCA) and internal carotid
artery (ICA) were exposed, and the pterygopalatine artery
was ligated close to its origin. A 3–0 nylon thread with a
blunt tip, made by heating near a flame, was inserted into
the ICA to block blood flow to the MCA. After 30 min of
MCAo, the suture was carefully removed to restore
blood flow. Blood flow in the MCA was monitored by
Laser-Doppler flowmetry (DRT4, Moor Instruments
Inc, Wilmington, USA) through the cranial burr hole in
the preischemia (>500 units), ischemia (<100 units), and
reperfusion (>300 units) periods. These data were used to
confirm the success of the cerebral I/R procedure.
Electrode implantation

Before the MCAo operation, the head of each anesthetized rat was fixed to a stereotactic frame. The electrodes consisted of two stainless steel wires (diameter
0.5 mm) used for acupoint (or nonacupoint) stimulation.
Electrodes were implanted in the Baihui (midpoint of
the parietal bone, 4 mm depth, forward insertion) and
Fengfu (the depression below the spinous process of
the second cervical vertebra, 7.5 mm depth, vertical insertion) acupoints [26], or in bilateral costal regions
(nonacupoints).
Evaluation of neurological function

The neurological score of each rat was evaluated after 1,
3, and 7 days of reperfusion. Motor, sensory, balance,
and reflex functions were evaluated using modified
neurological severity scores, as described previously [27].
The overall neurological function of each rat was graded
using a numerical scale from 0 to 18 (reference score, 0;
maximal deficit score, 18).
Experiment A
Grouping

The rats were randomly divided into Sham, Model, EA5Hz, Non-acup-5Hz, EA-25Hz, and Non-acup-25Hz
groups (n = 5). The rats in the EA-5Hz group were subjected to MCAo and simultaneously received EA at acupoints at a frequency of 5 Hz (EA-5Hz). The rats were
received the first EA at acupoints for 25 min during
MCAo. They were subjected to 30 min of ischemia
followed by reperfusion. After 1 day of reperfusion, the
rats received EA-5Hz (25 min) once daily for 6 (total 7)
consecutive days, and were sacrificed 7 days after reperfusion. The rats in the Non-acup-5Hz group were subjected
to the same procedures as the rats in the EA-5Hz group
but received EA at nonacupoints (Non-acup-5Hz). The

rats in the EA-25Hz group were subjected to the same
procedures as the rats in the EA-5Hz group but received
EA at acupoint at a frequency of 25Hz (EA-25Hz). The
rats in the Non-acup-25Hz group were subjected to the
same procedures as the rats in the EA-25Hz group but received EA at nonacupoints (Non-acup-25Hz). The rats in
the Model group were subjected to the same procedures
as the rats in the EA-5Hz group but did not receive EA.
The rats in the Sham group were subjected to the same
procedures as the rats in the Model group but the MCA
origin was not occluded.
Electroacupuncture at acupoints or nonacupoints

An electrical stimulator (Trio 300, ITO Co, Germany)
was used to generate EA at acupoints (EA-5Hz and
EA-25Hz) or nonacupoints (Non-acup-5Hz and Nonacup-25Hz) for 25 min once daily for 7 consecutive
days. The stimulation parameters were a 5- or 25-Hz
amplitude-modulated wave of 2.7-3.0 mA intensity and
150-μs pulse width. During EA at acupoints or nonacupoints, the rats were fully awake in the cages.
Assessment of cerebral infarction

Following neurological assessment 1, 3, and 7 days
after reperfusion, the rats were sacrificed. Their brains
were removed immediately and cut into 6 coronal 2mm sections. The sections were stained with 2 % 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Merck, Germany)
for 5 min at 37 °C. The brain tissues were differentiated according to white infarct and red noninfarct
areas, and the cerebral infarct areas were measured
using image analysis software (ImageJ, Java). The ratio
of cerebral infarction areas/total brain areas was then
calculated.
Experiment B
Grouping

The rats were randomly divided into 6 groups: Sham,
Model, EA-5Hz, Non-acup-5Hz, EA-25Hz and Nonacup-25Hz groups (n = 4). They were then subjected to
the experimental procedures described in Experiment A.
Western blot analysis

Seven days after reperfusion, the rats were sacrificed,
and their brains were removed and then coronally
sectioned from −4.3 to +1.7 mm bregma. The right
ischemic cortex was carefully separated into its penumbra (frontoparietal cortex chosen between 3 mm and
8 mm to the ischemic core) and ischemic core fractions.
The right penumbral cortex was further separated into
cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (#K256-100 BioVision, USA).
The protein concentrations in the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were determined using the Bio-Rad assay.

The samples were subjected to gel electrophoresis and
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in western
blot analysis as described previously [28]. The transferred membranes were then incubated with a rabbit
anti-SAPK/JNK (JNK; 1:1000 dilution, #9252 Cell

4 °C. The transferred membranes were also probed with
antibodies specific for mouse anti-actin (1:5000 dilution,
MAB1501 Chemicon) and mouse anti-cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX IV; 1:5000 dilution, AB14744-100
Abcam), as an internal control for the cytosolic and
mitochondrial fractions, respectively. After washing, the
membranes were incubated with either an anti-rabbit
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated IgG (1:5000
dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch) or an anti-mouse
HRP-conjugated IgG (1:5000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody for 1 h at room temperature (RT).
Blots were then developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL-plus GE Healthcare) on a luminescence image analyzer (LAS-3000, FujiFilm). Densitometric
analysis was performed using ImageJ analysis software.
Results were expressed quantitatively as optical density ratios of proteins/actin or COX IV.

Immunofluorescent (IF) costaining

After 30 min of cerebral ischemia followed by 7 days
of reperfusion, the rats were sacrificed under deep
anesthesia. After transcardial perfusion with 4 % paraformalaldehyde (pH 7.4), the rat brains were removed
immediately. The procedure for preparing brain sections
was performed as described previously [29]. Brain sections
were blocked using 10 % normal animal serum (ScyTek,
Logan, Utah, USA) in Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered
saline (DPBS; Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min at RT. They were
then incubated with a mouse anti-phospho-CREB (pCREB; 1:200 dilution, DAM1482729 Millipore) antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing 3 times with
DPBS, the sections were incubated with a DyLight 594conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG antibody
(red, 1:400 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h
at RT. The p-CREB-stained sections were counterstained
with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 1:1000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich, USA, nuclear staining) for 10 min at
RT. Finally, all sections were mounted in an aqueous
mounting medium (Aquatex, HC886685 Merck) and the
cortical periinfarct areas were viewed under a fluorescent
microscope (CKX41, Olympus). Sections incubated without the p-CREB primary antibodies were analyzed as the
negative controls.
Statistical analysis

Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
All variables were approximately normally distributed
and all parametric testing, such as analysis of variance
(ANOVA), was appropriate. Data from all experimental groups were compared using a one-way ANOVA
followed by post-hoc analysis by using the Scheffe test.
A P value of less than 0.05 indicates a statistically significant difference.

Results

The rats developed prominent cerebral infarction after
30 min of MCAo followed by 7 days of reperfusion
(P < 0.05 vs. Sham group; Figs. 1 and 2a). The percentage cerebral infarct areas were significantly lower in the
EA-5Hz and EA-25Hz groups than in the Model group
7 days after reperfusion (both P < 0.05; Figs. 1 and 2a).
However, the percentage cerebral infarct areas in the
Model, Non-acup-5Hz, and Non-acup-25Hz groups exhibited nonsignificant differences (P > 0.05).
Effects of EA-5Hz and EA-25Hz on neurological function

The rats had moderate neurological impairment after
30 min of MCAo followed by 1 day of reperfusion, as indicated by neurological deficit scores of approximately
6.4-7.6. The neurological deficit scores of the Model,
EA-5Hz, Non-acup-5Hz, EA-25Hz, and Non-acup-25Hz

Discussion
In this study, we observed that 30 min of MCAo produced gross cerebral infarction in the MCA territory 7
days after reperfusion. These results are consistent with
those of a previous study, which showed a large cerebral
infarction caused by delayed infarct expansion in the
subacute phase after mild transient focal cerebral ischemia [1]. Our results indicated that both EA-5Hz and
EA-25Hz, applied immediately after cerebral ischemia
and then once daily for 7 consecutive days, markedly
ameliorated brain infarction and neurological deficits 7
days after reperfusion following 30 min of MCAo,
whereas Non-acup-5Hz and Non-acup-25Hz did not
reduce cerebral infarct areas or improve neurological
status. Previous studies have reported that astrocytic activation contributes to increased infarct size through
neuron-glial interactions during the subacute phase of
cerebral ischemia, and that GFAP, a marker of reactive
astrocytes, is predominantly expressed in the periinfarct
border zone from 1 to 7 days after the onset of cerebral
ischemia [30, 31]. Our western blot analyses revealed

significantly upregulated GFAP expression in the ischemic cortical penumbra, and indicated that EA-5Hz and
EA-25Hz both effectively downregulated GFAP expression in the ischemic cortical penumbra 7 days after
reperfusion. Our and previous studies’ findings thus suggest that electroacupuncture stimulation at Baihui and
Fengfu acupoints, but not at nonacupoints, at a frequency of 5 or 25Hz, exerts neuroprotective effects
against cerebral I/R injury, and that such antiinfarct
effects are, at least in part, caused by the downregulation
of reactive astrocytosis-mediated neurotoxicity in the
periinfarct cortex 7 days after reperfusion.
Previous studies have reported that MAPK and
phosphatidylinositol-3-kniase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways are involved in the neuroprotective effects of EA
against cerebral I/R injury in mild transient focal cerebral ischemia [32, 33]. The MAPK family consists of
JNK, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK proteins, which are activated by various stimuli, including growth hormones and
cellular stresses [34]. Studies have shown that p38
MAPK signaling is involved in reactive astrogliosis and

plays a crucial role in the synthesis of proinflammatory
mediators in the cortical penumbra, leading to progressive infarction in the subacute phase of cerebral ischemia
[1, 35]. Studies have also shown that active p38 MAPK
expression in the periinfarct cortex or hippocampus
peaks at 6 h, and lasts 1–3 days, after ischemia, and exerts neuroprotective effects against ischemic brain injury
by activating antiapoptotic or CREB signaling pathways
in ischemic [36], anesthetic [37] preconditioning, and
global ischemia [38] models. A study done by Luo et al.
has also demonstrated that the activation of Akt exerts
neuroprotective actions against ischemic brain injury by
activating the CREB signaling pathway in a neonatal rat
model of cerebral hypoxia-ischemia [39]. CREB is a selective nuclear transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes for cell survival, neuroplasticity, and
neurogenesis [40]. CREB phosphorylation (on Ser 133)
predominantly occurs 1 h after ischemia and lasts up to
3 days followed by cAMP response element (CRE)-

mediated gene transcription, which produces antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in the periinfarct
region after MCAo [41]. Some studies have demonstrated that HSP70 is a downstream target of p38
MAPK, associated with upregulated Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression in in vivo and in vitro models [42, 43]. Our immunoblot analysis results indicate that p-p38 MAPK was
derived from total p38 MAPK, and that p-p38 MAPK,
but not p-JNK, p-ERK1/2, or p-Akt, expression was
markedly downregulated in the cytosolic fraction in the
cortical penumbra; however, this expression was
effectively restored by EA-5Hz and EA-25Hz 7 days after
reperfusion. P-CREB, but not HSP70, immunoreactivity
showed a similar pattern to cytosolic p-p38 MAPK
immunoreactivity. Further analysis of p-CREB/DAPI
costaining indicated p-CREB immunoreactivity in the
cytoplasm and intense p-CREB immunoreactivity within
the nuclear compartment in the cortical penumbra. These
results are consistent with those of a previous study,

which indicated that cytosolic p-CREB expression is positively associated with nuclear p-CREB expression and reflects the activation and nuclear translocation of CREB
following hypoxic preconditioning [44]. Based on previous
reports and our results, we propose that EA-5Hz and EA25 Hz both provide neuroprotection against astrocytemediated toxicity, most likely by activating p38 MAPK
signaling, and that their neuroprotective effects are possibly due to the activation of p38 MAPK/CREB, but not
p38 MAPK/HSP70, signaling in the ischemic cortical penumbra 7 days after reperfusion.
Studies have shown that the protective effect of
CREB phosphorylation against ischemia-induced neuronal
death can be attributed to overexpression of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL [40, 45]. During cerebral ischemia, ischemic insults result in a reduced Bcl-2
(Bcl-xL)/Bax ratio and shift the balance toward apoptosis

by promoting the release of cytochrome c, and Smac/
DIABLO from mitochondria [45]. Pharmacological treatments increase the Bcl-2 (Bcl-xL)/Bax ratio, and shift the
balance toward antiapoptotic effects by blocking the release of apoptogenic factors from mitochondria and
subsequently inhibiting apoptotic cascades [45]. In previous studies, Bax expression was markedly upregulated,
whereas Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression was significantly
downregulated, in the ischemic region 1 day after transient cerebral ischemia [10, 46]. In this study, the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax was predominantly
upregulated, whereas that of the antiapoptotic protein
Bcl-2 was significantly downregulated, in the cytosolic
fraction of the ischemic cortical penumbra 7 days after
reperfusion. Bax expression was markedly upregulated
in the mitochondrial fraction, whereas Bcl-xL expression was downregulated. However, EA-5Hz effectively

Fig. 8 Effects of EA-5Hz and EA-25Hz on the expression of cytosolic cleaved caspase-8, XIAP, and cleaved caspase-3 in the ischemic cortical penumbra.
a Representative images show the expression of cleaved caspase-8, XIAP, and cleaved caspase-3 in the cytosolic fraction of the ischemic cortical
penumbra in the Sham, Model, EA-5Hz, Non-acup-5Hz, EA-25Hz, and Non-acup-25Hz groups 7 days after reperfusion. The relative cytosolic expression
of b cleaved caspase-8, c XIAP, and d cleaved caspase-3 was measured in the ischemic cortical penumbra in the Sham, Model, EA-5Hz, Non-acup-5Hz,

restored cytosolic and mitochondrial Bcl-xL expression,
thereby contributing to the downregulation of mitochondrial Bax expression in the ischemic cortical penumbra.
Interestingly, EA-25Hz prevented the downregulation of
cytosolic Bcl-2 and mitochondrial Bcl-xL proteins, and
significantly upregulated mitochondrial Bcl-2 expression,
leading to abrogated cytosolic and mitochondrial Bax
expression 7 days after reperfusion. EA-5Hz increased the
Bcl-xL/Bax ratio in the mitochondrial fraction, which
shifted the balance of the Bcl-2 family proteins toward
survival. EA-25Hz markedly increased the Bcl-2/Bax and
Bcl-xL/Bax ratios in the cytosolic fraction and strongly
inhibited Bax translocation from the cytosol to the mitochondria, resulting in an increased mitochondrial Bcl-2/
Bax ratio. This change exerted beneficial effects by stabilizing mitochondrial permeability transition after cerebral
I/R injury. Studies have demonstrated that cytosolic p53,
which is predominantly found in the ischemic region
12 h-2 days after ischemia, rapidly translocates to the

mitochondria in response to cerebral ischemic insults,
where it interacts with the pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2
family proteins and severely disrupts mitochondrial membrane integrity, leading to p53-mediated apoptosis [47, 48].
In this study, cytosolic and sparse mitochondrial (data not
shown) p53 expression levels in the ischemic cortical penumbra were unaffected by EA-5Hz or EA-25Hz 7 days
after reperfusion. Considering these and previous findings,
we suggest that both EA-5Hz and EA-25Hz exert neuroprotective effects against Bax-mediated apoptosis, possibly
due to the activation of p38 MAPK/CREB signaling, and
that the downregulating effects of EA-5Hz and EA-25Hz
on the insertion of Bax into mitochondria can be attributed to increased mitochondrial Bcl-xL/Bax and Bcl-2/Bax
ratios, respectively, but not suppressed p53 signaling, in
the cortical periinfarct area 7 days after reperfusion.
Evidence has suggested that Bax activation during

formation of homo-oligomers, and that these processes
lead to mitochondrial fragmentation and consequent
release of apoptogenic proteins, including cytochrome c,
Smac/DIABLO, and AIF [49–51]. The release of cytochrome c, coinciding with Bax translocation, facilitates
the formation of the apoptosome, which binds and activates caspase-9 to initiate caspase-3-mediated apoptosis.
This cascade is accompanied by Smac/DIABLO release
to the cytosol, where Smac/DIABLO binds and neutralizes XIAP and prevents XIAP-mediated caspase
suppression. By contrast, translocation of AIF from
mitochondria to the nucleus initiates DNA fragmentation through a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway
[52]. Druse et al. (2006) used an in vitro ethanoltreated cell culture model to show that the pharmacological restoration of Bcl-xL and XIAP expression
plays a crucial role in neuroprotective effects against
apoptosis [53]. Other research has found that activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic caspase-dependent
apoptotic pathways, and activation of the caspaseindependent apoptotic pathway occur in the penumbra
zone, and shown the expression of cleaved caspase-8,
cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-3, XIAP, and AIF in the
cytosol after 4 h of reperfusion in a rat model of MCAo
[52]. Our study results indicate that EA-5Hz and EA25Hz did not affect the expression of cleaved caspase-8,
and thus exerted no influence on extrinsic pathwaymediated (caspase-8-mediated) apoptosis. We observed
upregulated cytosolic and mitochondrial Smac/DIABLO

expression, upregulated cytosolic cleaved caspase-3 expression, and downregulated cytosolic XIAP expression,
in the cortical penumbra after MCAo. However, EA5Hz and EA-25Hz effectively reduced the extent of
Smac/DIABLO and cleaved caspase-3 upregulation, and
simultaneously restored XIAP expression, 7 days after
reperfusion. Nonsignificant differences in the cytosolic
and mitochondrial cytochrome c and AIF among the
model and treatment groups indicated that EA-5Hz
and EA-25Hz exert nonsignificant effects on cytochrome c- or AIF-mediated apoptosis. Our results thus
strongly suggest that EA-5Hz and EA-25Hz are neuroprotective against Bax-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting
the translocation of Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria
to the cytosol, thereby restoring XIAP-mediated suppression of caspase-3 activity in the ischemic cortical
penumbra 7 days after reperfusion. According to our
research, this study is the first to show that EA at acupoints (5 and 25Hz) exerts neuroprotective effects by
modulating Bcl-xL- and Bcl-2-mediated signaling pathways in the subacute phase after mild transient MCAo.
Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 localize in different cell types and
subcellular locations, and exert functionally different
types of anti-apoptotic activity [54–56]. Bcl-xL has
been shown to be more effective than Bcl-2 (approximately 10-fold) at inhibiting apoptosis in a cell culture
model of breast cancer [56]. In this study, EA-25Hzactivated Bcl-2-mediated signaling influenced neurological recovery as early as 3 days after reperfusion,

Cheng et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2015) 15:241

and the downregulating effects of Bcl-xL/Bax- and Bcl2/Bax-mediated signaling on caspase-3 activation were
similar 7 days after MCAo. However, further investigation is required to clarify the differences between these
signaling pathways.

Conclusions
Overall, our results suggest that EA-5Hz and EA-25Hz
both effectively downregulate reactive astrocytosis to
provide neuroprotection against cerebral infarction,
most likely by activating p38 MAPK/CREB signaling.
The modulating effects of EA-5Hz and EA-25Hz on
Bax-mediated apoptosis are possibly due to the activation of p38 MAPK/CREB/Bcl-xL and p38 MAPK/CREB/
Bcl-2 signaling, respectively, thereby preventing Smac/
DIABLO translocation and restoring XIAP-mediated
caspase-3 inhibition in the ischemic cortical penumbra 7
days after reperfusion. Our results indicate that electroacupuncture stimulation at the Baihui and Fengfu acupoints, at frequencies of 5 and 25Hz, provide promising
therapeutic strategies in the subacute phase after MCAo.
Further investigations are required to clarify the precise
signaling mechanisms and the differences in these neuroprotective effects of EA-5Hz and EA-25Hz before
future clinical application.
