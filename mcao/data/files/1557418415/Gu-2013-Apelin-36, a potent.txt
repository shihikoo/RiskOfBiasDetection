Apelin is an endogenous ligand of G protein-coupled receptor-apelin and angiotensin-1-like receptor
(APJ). The biological effects of apelin–APJ system are reported in multiple systems including cardiovascular, endocrinal, and gastrointestinal system. Previous studies had shown that apelin-13 is a potential protective agent on cardiac ischemia; however, the role of apelin in the central nervous system remained
unknown. In this study, we investigated therapeutic effects of apelin-36, a long form of apelin, in ischemic brain injury models. We found that apelin-36 reduced cerebral infarct volume in the middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) model and the neonatal hypoxic/ischemic (H/I) injury model. Apelin-36
improved neurological deﬁcits in the MCAO model and promoted long-term functional recovery after
H/I brain injury. We further explored the protective mechanisms of apelin-36 on H/I brain injury. We
clearly demonstrated that apelin-36 signiﬁcantly reduced the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, two
well-established apoptotic markers after H/I injury, indicating the anti-apoptotic activity of apelin-36
in ischemic injury. Since apelin-36 increased the level of phosphorylated Akt after H/I injury, we treated
neonates with a speciﬁc PI3K inhibitor LY294002. We found that LY294002 decreased the phosphorylated Akt level and attenuated protective effects of apelin-36 on apoptosis. These suggested that the
PI3K/Akt pathway was at least in part involved in the anti-apoptotic mechanisms of apelin-36. Our ﬁndings demonstrated that apelin-36 was a promising therapeutic agent on the treatment of ischemic brain
injury.

1. Introduction
Neonatal hypoxia/ischemia encephalopathy (HIE) is a common
central nervous system disease in perinatal patients. It is a serious
threat to newborn health for its poor prognosis, high mortality, and
disability. Cerebral palsy, epilepsy, learning disability, memory
retardation, or other abnormal behaviors are often observed in
most survivors of HIE (Arteni et al., 2003; Hagberg et al., 2005;
Jin et al., 2007). Importantly, these neurological complications
seriously affect their life quality and increase social burdens.

Therefore, it is very important to study the pathogenesis of HIE
and ﬁnd out therapeutic targets to maximally reduce neurological
complications (Cull-Candy et al., 2001). Previous studies have demonstrated that mitochondrial damage, free radicals production,
inﬂammation, glutamate excitatory toxicity, endothelial cell dysfunction, caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis are involved in pathological mechanisms of HIE (Bickler and Fahlman, 2006; Jantas and
Lason, 2009). Neuroprotective agents, which target these different
pathological mechanisms, may offset or reduce harmful biochemical activities, or strengthen protective signaling pathways, providing a promising strategy to treat HIE.
Apelin is an endogenous ligand of apelin and angiotensin-1-like
receptor (APJ), a G protein-coupled receptor. Human APELIN gene
encodes a pre-proprotein of 77 amino acids (Tatemoto et al.,
1998). After translation and cleavage, the proprotein of apelin generates several active fragments, including a 36-amino acid peptide
corresponding to the sequence 42–77 (apelin-36), a 17-amino acid
peptide corresponding to the sequence 61–77 (apelin-17), and a
13-amino acid peptide corresponding to the sequence 65–77

(apelin-13). The active forms of apelin are widely distributed in different tissues including the brain and the heart (O’Carroll et al.,
2000). The biological effects of apelin–APJ system are involved in
the multiple systems (Falcao-Pires et al., 2009; Tatemoto et al.,
1998). In the cardiovascular system, apelin is found to have cardiovascular protection by activating phosphokinase C, protein kinase
C, and endogenous Na+–H+ converting enzyme, inhibiting the production of angiotensin II, and increasing myocardial contractility
(Barnes et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2005; Zeng et al., 2009). In the
endocrinal system, apelin inhibits insulin secretion induced by
high blood glucose (Wei et al., 2005); also, distribution of APJ
mRNA in the hypothalamus is similar to that of anti-diuretic
hormone, implying that apelin–APJ is involved in the hypothalamus–adrenal–pituitary axis to regulate water balance and feeding
activities (O’Carroll et al., 2003). The role of apelin in the central
nervous system remains unclear and needs further investigations.
A recent result showed that apelin-13, had neuroprotective effects by reducing excitotoxicity of excitatory receptor NMDA and
ROS production and activating ERK1/2 and the PI3K/Akt pathway
in cultured cortical neurons (Cheng et al., 2012; Zeng et al.,
2010). In addition, apelin-13 at the doses of 50 and 100 lg (intracerebroventricularly, i.c.v.) protects against cerebral ischemia injury in a cerebral middle artery occlusion (MCAO) model
(Khaksari et al., 2012). Although these studies demonstrated neuroprotective effects of apelin-13 on ischemia injury in vitro and
in vivo, it is unclear whether apelin has protective effect on HIE.
In this study, we demonstrated low dose (0.1 lg) of apelin-36, a
long form of apelin, had a high potent protection in a MCAO model.
Further, we examined the neuroprotection of apelin-36 in a HIE
animal model. We conﬁrmed its protection on neonatal hypoxia/
ischemia (H/I) injury and explored its protective mechanisms.
2. Materials and methods

2.3. The cerebral H/I injury model
The newborn rat model with cerebral H/I injury was established
as described previously (Rodrigues et al., 2004; Ten et al., 2003;
Vannucci et al., 1999). Newborn rats at the age of day 7 were anesthetized with diethyl ether and the left CCA was ligated. The duration of the procedure was less than 5 min, followed by 1 h break.
During 1 h recovery, the body temperature of the pups was maintained with a heating carpet. The mice were then placed into a
hypoxic chamber ﬂushed with the mixed gas of 8% O2 and 92%
N2. The hypoxic chamber was partially submerged in a water bath
at 37 °C to maintain a constant internal temperature. After 2.5 h of
ischemia, the rats were returned the cages. Apelin-36 (1 lg in
100 ll saline) was administrated intraperitoneally (i.p.) at the
beginning of recovery.
2.4. Experimental groups
For the MCAO model, mice were randomly divided into four
groups (n = 6–8): vehicle-treated group (sham group); apelin-treated group (apelin group); vehicle-treated ischemia/reperfusion
group (I/R group); apelin-treated I/R group (I/R + apelin group).
For the H/I injury model, newborn rats were randomly assigned
into 4 individual groups (n = 6–8 for each group): sham surgical
group (sham group): the left CCA was exposed but not ligated,
and then placed into the hypoxic compartment; hypoxia/ischemia
group (H/I group): as described above; apelin-treated H/I group
(apelin group): 1 lg apelin-36 was injected (i.p.) 1 h before ischemia and other conditions were same as H/I group; apelin/
LY294002-treated H/I group (LY294002 group): after the neonates
received 1 lg apelin-36 and recovered for 1 h, PI3K inhibitor
LY294002 (0.1 ml 1 mg/ml in 1% dimethylsulfoxide, Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) was then administrated (i.p.) before
ischemia; other conditions were same as apelin group.

2.1. Experimental animals
Male ICR mice (23–28 g, about 5-week old) and Sprague–Dawley rats (postnatal day 5) were purchased from SLAC Company
(Shanghai, China). Mice were used for the MCAO model and rat
pups were used for the H/I injury model. All animal procedures
were approved by the University Committee on Animal Care of
Soochow University and performed according to the NIH Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All efforts were made
to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals.
2.2. The MCAO model
MCAO was carried out by using a nylon monoﬁlament as described previously (Xu et al., 2006). Brieﬂy, a mouse was anesthetized by 7.2% chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg body weight). When the
right common carotid artery (CCA) and the right external carotid
artery (ECA) were isolated, the ECA was ligated with a silk suture
at 2 mm distal from the ECA–CCA branch. A 6-0 nylon ﬁlament
(Ethilon, Ethicon Inc., USA) coated with silicon resin was inserted
through the incision near the ECA–CCA branch about 1.5 mm into
the right internal carotid artery and advanced about 9–11 mm.
Reperfusion was achieved by withdrawing the monoﬁlament after
75 min of MCAO. Sham mice underwent the same experimental
procedures but the nylon ﬁlament was advanced only about
5 mm. Body temperature was maintained at 36.5–37.5 °C between
the beginning of surgery and the recovery from anesthesia after
surgery. The local cerebral blood ﬂow was measured by a laserDoppler blood ﬂow meter. Apelin-36 (0.1 lg in 10 ll saline, Peptide International, Louisville, Kentucky, USA) or saline was injected
(i.c.v.) into the left lateral ventricle at 30 min before MCAO.

2.5. Intracerebroventricular administration of apelin-36
A small burr hole was drilled in the parietal region of mice
(0.5 mm posterior and 1.0 mm lateral to the Bregma). Apelin-36
or saline was injected into the left lateral ventricle via the hole
with a depth of 2.5 mm.
2.6. Neurological deﬁcit evaluation
Neurological deﬁcits were evaluated at 24 h after the MCAO.
The modiﬁed neurological deﬁcit evaluation system was based
on a 5-point scale system described previously (Xu et al., 2010):
no deﬁcit, 0; ﬂexion of the contralateral torso and forelimb, 1;
turning to the ipsilateral side when held by tail, 2; leaning to affected side, 3; no spontaneous locomotor activity, 4.
2.7. The measurement of infarct volume
After indicated time points, the animals were anesthetized and
the brains were removed for the measurement of infarct volume.
The brains were sliced into 1-mm slices and incubated with 0.1%
solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) for 30 min at 37 °C. After ﬁxing in
4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, the slices were photographed. The
cross-sectional area of infarction in each brain slice was determined with AlphaEase Image Analysis Software V 3.1.2 (Alpha
Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). The percentage of hemispheric
infarction volume was calculated as described in our previous
study (Xu et al., 2008).

2.8. Western blot analysis
The rats were sacriﬁced at 24 h after H/I injury. The brains were
quickly removed on ice and the left ischemic cortical tissue was
collected for Western blot analysis. Proteins were extracted and
the concentrations were then determined. Samples (30–60 lg)
were loaded on a 12% of sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and then electrotransferred to
nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were blocked with PBST (3.2 mM
Na2HPO4, 0.5 mM KH2PO4, 1.3 mM KCl, 135 mM NaCl, pH 7.4,
0.1% Tween-20) containing 5% of nonfat dry milk for 2 h at 4 °C,
and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight with shaking at 4 °C. After washing, blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody in blocking solution for 1.5 h, and
developed by the ECL chemiluminescence system (Thermo Company, West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA) on autoradiographic ﬁlms
(Kodak Company, Rochester, New York, USA). Densitometric analysis of the bands was performed with AlphaEase Image Analysis
Software. Primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473, Catalogue No. 9271, Cell Signaling Technology
Inc., Danvers, Massachusetts), rabbit polyclonal anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Catalogue No. 9661, Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, Massachusetts), and mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH
(Catalogue No. G8795, Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA).
2.9. Neurological function evaluation after H/I injury
Neurological functions were evaluated by the foot-fault test.
The foot-fault test measures the percentage of foot-faults of the left
forepaw to total steps to reﬂect the accuracy of forepaw placement
on a non-equidistant grid. The rats were examined at 7 d and 14 d
after H/I injury as described previously (Kaur and Ling, 2008). The
rats were placed on a horizontal grid ﬂoor (50 cm  40 cm, with a
square size of 3 cm  3 cm). The foot fault is deﬁned that the paw
falls between the grid bars when the rat misplaces a forelimb or
hind-limb. The number of foot-faults and total steps of both forelimb and hind-limb were recorded in 2 min. The foot-fault rate of
steps of right forelimb and hind-limb was calculated.
2.10. Statistical analysis
Data were presented as means ± SEM. Statistical analysis were
performed using SPSS13.0. Differences between groups were
determined with Student’s t-test for infarct volume; the differences among groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparison test if
there was a signiﬁcant difference between groups. p < 0.05 was
considered signiﬁcant difference.
3. Results
3.1. Apelin-36 reduced infarct volume in the MCAO model
Because previous studies demonstrated that apelin-13 has protective effects on oxygen–glucose deprivation-induced cell death
in primary neurons and ischemic injury in a MCAO model (Khaksari et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2010), we examined whether apelin36, a long form of active apelin, has higher potent protection on
I/R injury in a MCAO model. According to our previous study on
the protection of a 24-amino acid peptide humanin in a MCAO
model, the dose of 0.1 lg humanin is effective on ischemic injury
(Xu et al., 2006). Therefore, we treated (i.c.v.) the mice with a dose
of 0.1 lg apelin-36 for each mouse in this study. After 75 min of
ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion, TTC staining for brain slices
was performed. As expected, I/R injury resulted in a large infarct.

537

Interestingly, 0.1 lg aplein-36 markedly reduced infarct volume
in I/R + apelin group (Fig. 1A), suggesting that apelin-36 was also
an active form on ischemic injury. Quantitative analysis conﬁrmed
the signiﬁcant difference between I/R group and I/R + apelin group
(p < 0.05, Fig. 1B). These data demonstrated that apelin-36 had a
high potency for the protection on I/R injury.
3.2. Apelin-36 improved neurological deﬁcits after ischemia/
reperfusion injury
Before the mice were sacriﬁced for TTC staining, the neurological deﬁcits were evaluated by a neurological deﬁcit evaluation system. Compared with sham group and apelin group, I/R injury
signiﬁcant increased the neurological score. However, apelin-36
treatment reduced the neurological score. There was a signiﬁcant
difference between I/R group and I/R + apelin group (p < 0.05,
Fig. 2), indicating the improvement of neurological deﬁcits by apelin-36.
3.3. Apelin-36 reduced infarct volume in the cerebral H/I injury model
Since both apelin-13 and apelin-36 showed the protection on
cerebral I/R injury in a previous study (Khaksari et al., 2012) and
in our study, we speculated that apelin-36 also have protective effects in a HIE rat model. In order to demonstrate the neuroprotective effects of apelin-36 on neonatal rats with brain H/I injury, we
performed TTC staining at 48 h after H/I injury. In H/I group, H/I injury resulted in an infarct volume about 49.28 ± 2.96% of the hemisphere (Fig. 3A and B). Compared with H/I group, apelin-36
treatment signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume (21.22 ± 2.43% of
the hemisphere, Fig. 3A and B, p < 0.05). These results indicated
that apelin-36 had protective effects on H/I injury.
3.4. Apelin-36 promoted neurological function recovery after cerebral
H/I injury
In order to observe neurological recovery after apelin-36 treatment on H/I injury in neonatal rats, the foot-fault test was carried
out at 7 d and 14 d after H/I injury. Our data indicated that there
was a signiﬁcant decrease of total number of steps/min in H/I
group compared with sham group. The total numbers of steps in
H/I group were 52.6 ± 5.68 steps/min at 7 d and 70.9 ± 3.90 steps/
min at 14 d, which were much less than that in sham group
(78.50 ± 5.21 steps/min at 7 d and 91.5 ± 12.47 steps/min at 14 d,
respectively, p < 0.05). Apelin-36 treatment increased the total
number of steps/min at 7 d (67.3 ± 5.74 steps/min) and 14 d
(87.5 ± 5.44 steps/min) (Fig. 4A, p < 0.05). The foot-fault rates of
right forelimb were signiﬁcantly decreased in apelin-treated rats
at 7 d (15.61 ± 4.88) and 14 d (12.7 ± 3.35) after H/I injury compared with H/I group (19.46 ± 5.09% at 7 d and 15.9 ± 4.25% 14 d,
respectively, Fig. 4B, p < 0.05). Similarly, apelin-36 treatment also
decreased the foot-fault rates of right hind-limb at 7 d and 14 d
(Fig. 4C, p < 0.05).
3.5. Apelin treatment reduced the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax
and increased phosphorylated Akt, but these effects were reversed by a
PI3K inhibitor LY294002
More and more evidences had demonstrated that there are different types of cell death after H/I injury, including necrosis, apoptosis, and autophagy (Balduini et al., 2012). Apoptosis and necrosis
were the main forms of cell death after cerebral H/I injury (Iriyama
et al., 2009; Meloni et al., 2011). Therefore, in this study, we examined cleaved caspase-3 and Bax, two widely used apoptotic cell
death markers, at 24 h after H/I injury. We collected brain tissues
from ischemic cortex and then extracted proteins for Western blot

the level of cleaved caspase-3 was reduced in apelin group
(Fig. 5A and B, p < 0.05). Similarly, Bax, another apoptosis indicator,
was signiﬁcantly increased after H/I injury and its level was markedly decreased by apelin-36 treatment (Fig. 5A and C, p < 0.05).
These data demonstrated that apelin-36 treatment reduced apoptotic cell death after cerebral H/I injury.
Zeng et al. have shown that phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) is increased after apelin-13 treatment in cultured primary neuron
(Zeng et al., 2010). It is unclear whether PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is also involved in the protection of apelin-36 on cerebral H/
I injury. In order to conﬁrm this, we examined the p-Akt level after
H/I injury. We found that H/I injury signiﬁcantly increased p-Akt
level compared with sham group (Fig. 5A and D, p < 0.05). Apelin-36 treatment further increased p-Akt level compared with H/I
group (p < 0.05). Although apelin-36 increased p-Akt level after
H/I injury, whether Akt activation plays an important role in the
protection of apelin-36 remained unknown. Therefore, we used
LY294002, a speciﬁc PI3K inhibitor, as a tool to decreased p-Akt level as shown in Fig. 5A. LY294002 decreased p-Akt level to the normal level after H/I injury (Fig. 5D, p < 0.05). At the same time, the
decrease of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax by apelin-36 treatment
was partially blocked by LY294002 (Fig. 5, p < 0.05). These results
indicated that apelin-36 activated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
after H/I injury, but LY294002 abolished the anti-apoptotic effect
of apelin-36 by blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway.
4. Discussion

Fig. 3. Apelin-36 reduced infarct volume after H/I injury. Infarct volume was
evaluated by TTC staining at 48 h after H/I injury. (A) The representative pictures in
H/I group and apelin group were shown. (B) Quantiﬁcation of infarct volume was

analysis. Compared with sham group, we found that the level of
cleaved caspase-3 was increased in H/I group, indicating that H/I
injury also caused apoptotic cell death in our study. However,

In this study, our data demonstrated that apelin-36 had protective effects on ischemic brain injury in a MCAO mouse model and
an H/I rat model. It reduced cerebral infarct volume (Figs. 1 and 3)
and improved neurological functions in (Figs. 2 and 4). In addition,
our ﬁndings also indicated that apelin-36 reduced the levels of
cleaved caspase-3 and Bax after H/I injury by activating the PI3K/
Akt signaling pathway (Fig. 5).
In 1998, Tatemoto et al. found apelin as a vasodilator agent
from secretes of cow stomach (Tatemoto et al., 1998). In the following years, it has been extensively studied in different systems
including cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal system, urinary
tract system, and endocrine system. These studies showed that
apelin has the biological effects on blood pressure (Ishida et al.,
2004), the contraction of the heart and blood vessels (Chen et al.,
2003; Szokodi et al., 2002), vasopressin synthesis, diuresis (Reaux

et al., 2001), insulin resistance, high glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion (Heinonen et al., 2005; Sorhede Winzell et al., 2005),
and ﬂuid balance (Hosoya et al., 2000). However, the role of apelin
in the nervous system was not clear (Cheng et al., 2012). As a newly discovered regulatory peptide, the functions of apelin needed
further study. Although previous study had demonstrated the protection of apelin-13 at high doses of 50 and 100 lg for each animal
in the MCAO model (Khaksari et al., 2012), our data showed that
apelin-36 (0.1 lg) reduced infarct volume and improved neurological functions in the same model (Figs. 1 and 2), demonstrating the
high potency of apelin-36 on cerebral I/R injury. This suggested

that apelin-36 may have higher afﬁnity for APJ receptor than apelin-13. In our H/I model, the infarct volume was signiﬁcantly reduced by apelin-36 after ischemic brain injury (Fig. 3).
Neurological function recovery by apelin-36 was also found at
7 d and 14 d after surgery (Fig. 4). These demonstrated that apelin-36 improved long-term neurological functions after H/I injury
in newborn rats and that apelin-36 is a powerful protective agent
on brain injury in neonatal rats.
We also found that apelin-36 reduced the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax in the cortex in the neonatal rats with H/I injury
(Fig. 5). However, LY294002 partially reversed the protective

effects of apelin-36. Since LY294002 is a PI3K inhibitor and the
PI3K/Akt pathway is a key point in the signal transduction after
cerebral hypoxia/ischemia; the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway
is an important target for the protection on H/I brain injury (Alvarez-Tejado et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2008). In this study, we further
provided evidences that the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway
mediated neuroprotective effects of apelin-36 (Fig. 5). LY294002
inhibited the PI3K/Akt pathway and almost completely blocked
the effect of apelin-36 on cleaved caspase-3. Therefore, we concluded that the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is one of the
protective mechanisms of apelin-36; however, the PI3K/Akt pathway may not the only protective mechanism of apelin-36.
5. Conclusion
In summary, apelin-36 reduced infarct volume and neuronal
apoptosis in ischemic brain injury models and had a great impact
on functional recovery after brain injury. Due to its high potent
neuroprotection, apelin-36 may be a promising agent for the treatment of ischemic brain injury such as stoke or neonatal HIE.
