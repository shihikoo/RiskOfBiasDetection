Blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption and hemorrhagic transformation (HT) following ischemic/reperfusion injury contributes to post-stroke morbidity and mortality. Bryostatin, a potent protein kinase C
(PKC) modulator, has shown promise in treating neurological injury. In the present study, we tested the
hypothesis that administration of bryostatin would reduce BBB disruption and HT following acute ischemic stroke; thus, prolonging the time window for administering recombinant tissue plasminogen
activator (r-tPA). Acute cerebral ischemia was produced by reversible occlusion of the right middle
cerebral artery (MCAO) in 18–20-month-old female rats using an autologous blood clot with delayed
r-tPA reperfusion. Bryostatin (or vehicle) was administered at 2 h post-MCAO and r-tPA was administered
at 6 h post-MCAO. Functional assessment, lesion volume, and hemispheric swelling measurements were
performed at 24 h post-MCAO. Assessment of BBB permeability, measurement of hemoglobin, assessment of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) levels by gel zymography, and measurement of PKCε, PKCα,
PKCδ expression by western blot were conducted at 24 h post-MCAO. Rats treated with bryostatin prior
to r-tPA administration had decreased mortality and hemispheric swelling when compared with rats
treated with r-tPA alone. Administration of bryostatin also limited BBB disruption and HT and downregulated MMP-9 expression while up-regulating PKCε expression at 24 h post-MCAO. Bryostatin administration ameliorates BBB disruption and reduces the risk of HT by down-regulating MMP-9 activation and up-regulating PKCε. In this proof-of-concept study, bryostatin treatment lengthened the timeto-treatment window and enhanced the efﬁcacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy.

1. Introduction
Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) remains the
only Federal Drug Administration approved therapeutic for ischemic stroke. The time window for r-tPA administration is 3–
4.5 h for intravenous administration; consequently, less than 5% of
stroke victims are eligible to receive r-tPA due to an elevated risk
of hemorrhagic transformation (HT). The elevated vascular risk is
due, in part, to blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption and increased
basement membrane remodeling from matrix metalloproteinase

(MMP) activation (Wang et al., 2003b; Wang and Lo, 2003). Thus, a
pressing need exists for identifying therapeutics that can work in
combination with r-tPA to reduce complications and extend the
time window for administration.
In a prior study, we demonstrated that bryostatin, a protein
kinase C (PKC) modulator, reduced ischemic brain injury in agedfemales when administered at 6 h following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (Tan et al., 2013). In a separate study, we
showed that bryostatin provided neuroprotection in young-adult
males by modulating PKC activity at the BBB following neural injury (Lucke-Wold et al., 2014). Increased PKC activity has been
shown to affect structural and functional integrity of the BBB following ischemic brain injury (Willis et al., 2010). PKCε enhances
BBB integrity by upregulating claudin-5 expression, while PKCδ
increases BBB permeability through alterations in tight junction
protein localization (Selvatici et al., 2003). Following MCAO/

Z. Tan et al. / European Journal of Pharmacology 764 (2015) 404–412

reperfusion, upregulated expression of PKCα occurs concurrently
with the downregulation of tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1, occludin, and VE-cadherin leading to increased BBB permeability and HT (Yu et al., 2012). PKCδ and PKCα also initiate the
ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathway,
which is known to regulate MMP-9 activation (Arai et al., 2003).
Following the onset of ischemia/reperfusion with delayed r-tPA¸
MMP enzymes are excessively activated and expressed leading to
profound remodeling of the basement membranes (Romanic et al.,
1998). The activation and overexpression of MMPs cause endothelium damage that leads to cleavage of extracellular matrix
(ECM) proteins such as collagen, proteoglycan, and basal laminin.
Ultimately, these perturbations trigger migration of inﬂammatory
cells and large toxic molecules into the brain (Arai et al., 2003). It
has been suggested that acute inhibition of MMP-9 could be
beneﬁcial following cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury while a
later upregulation being beneﬁcial for remodeling and repair
(Zlokovic, 2006).
In this proof-of-concept study, we reversed the treatment
paradigm of our previous study to determine if administration of
bryostatin at 2 h after MCAO could reduce the BBB disruption and
HT associated with r-tPA administration at 6 h after MCAO. We did
this using a clinically relevant ischemic stroke model that utilized
r-tPA reperfusion in aged female rats. Results of this study demonstrate that administration of bryostatin extended the time-totreatment window of r-tPA with reduced mortality and hemispheric swelling, decreased BBB disruption, and attenuated HT.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals, drug treatment, and inclusion/exclusion criteria
Fifty-six female Sprague–Dawley rats (18–20 months old) were
purchased from Hilltop Laboratories (Scottdale, PA) and housed
under 12 h light–dark conditions with food and water available ad
libitum. The West Virginia University Animal Care and Use Committee approved all work involving rats. Study 1 (N ¼27 rats) assessed mortality, neurological score, infarct volume, hemispheric
swelling, and hemoglobin concentration at 24 h post-MCAO. Study
2 (N ¼ 15 rats) measured changes in BBB permeability to vascular
impermeant markers, Evans blue (EB) albumin and sodium ﬂuorescein (NaF), at 24 h post-MCAO. Study 3 (N ¼ 14 rats) identiﬁed
changes in MMP activity and PKC expression at 24 h post-MCAO.
All the studies, aside from the PKC expression study, included two
treatment groups: Group 1 (r-tPA): MCAO, 0.9% vehicle (saline þ10% dimethylsulfoxide) at 2 h post-MCAO, r-tPA (5 mg/kg;
30% bolus infused over 30 min) at 6 h post-MCAO and Group 2 (rtPA þbryostatin): MCAO, bryostatin (2.5 mg/kg; i.v. dissolved in
0.9% saline) at 2 h post-MCAO, r-tPA at 6 h post-MCAO. For the
third study, a sham was added to compare immunohistochemistry
stains between groups. In the PKC expression study, a sham group
was needed to observe basal activation of PKC levels without
MCAO. All studies were performed with researchers blinded to
treatment groups.
2.2. Surgical procedure for MCAO
Rats were given a reversible embolic MCAO as previously described (Dinapoli et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2009). Brieﬂy, rats were
anesthetized with 2% isoﬂurane in a mixture of 30% oxygen and
70% nitrous oxide. A servo-controlled homeothermic heating
blanket, equipped with a rectal thermometer, was used to maintain body temperature at 37 °C. Cerebral blood ﬂow was

405

monitored with a laser Doppler probe precisely positioned over
the area supplied by the middle cerebral artery (MCA). A modiﬁed
PE 50 microcatheter was inserted into the external carotid artery
stump and advanced into the MCA. Placement in the proximal
MCA was veriﬁed by a sudden decrease in cerebral blood ﬂow as
measured by laser Doppler. The microcatheter was withdrawn
 1 mm, allowing cerebral blood ﬂow to return to baseline, and
then a 25 mm ﬁbrin-enriched clot was injected. Successful MCA
occlusion was conﬁrmed by a drop in perfusion greater than 80%
of baseline ﬂow. Recanalization was achieved when cerebral blood
ﬂow increased to at least 75% of initial baseline. Rats not achieving
these standards were excluded from the study. The sham group
received anesthesia and surgery without the MCAO.
2.3. Neurological functional assessment
Neurological functional assessments were measured at 24 h
post-MCAO by an investigator blinded to treatment groups. The
modiﬁed Neurological Severity Scores (mNSS) evaluated motor,
sensory, balance and reﬂex measures. The scoring range was from
0 to 17, with higher scores indicating greater neurological injury
(Seyfried et al., 2004).
2.4. Measurement of infarction volume by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC)
At 24 h following MCAO, rats were killed and infarct size and
volume were measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC; 2%) staining. Seven 2 mm coronal brain slices were sectioned
and stained for 15 min at 37 °C. Brain sections were scanned and
analyzed using Image J software. On each section, the non-stained
area (ischemic brain) was outlined, and the corrected infarct volume (CIV) calculated using the following equation: CIV ¼(CHV 
[IHV  IHI])  d, where CHV was the area of the contralateral cortex
or striatum in mm2, IHV was the area of the ipsilateral cortex or
striatum in mm2, IHI was the infarct area (cortical or striatal) in
mm2, and d was slice thickness (2 mm). Hemispheric swelling was
calculated as follows: Hemispheric swelling ¼([volume of ipsilateral hemisphere volume of contralateral hemisphere]/volume
of contralateral hemisphere)  100% (Schielke et al., 1998).
2.5. Spectrophotometric assay of hemoglobin
HT was quantiﬁed using a spectrophotometric assay (Quantichrom Bioassay Systems) of hemoglobin content in the right and
left brain hemispheres. At 24 h after MCAO, rats were anesthetized
with ketamine/xylazine (90 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg; i.p.) and perfused
transcardially with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The
brain was sectioned into seven 2 mm slabs and the MCA area
(Sections 2–5) from both hemispheres was dissected, weighed,
and homogenized in 0.1 M PBS. After 30 min of centrifugation
(13,000xg), 50 ml aliquots of sample were transferred into a 96 well
plate with 200 ml of reagent. After 15 min at room temperature,
optical density was measured at a wavelength of 400 nm per
manufacturer's instructions. A standard curve was generated using
absorbance from serial dilutions of hemoglobin added in incremental aliquots from control rats to the homogenized brain tissue
from control rats. Hemoglobin content was expressed as mg/g
brain.
2.6. Assessment of BBB permeability
BBB permeability was assessed using EB and NaF as impermeant vascular space markers. Saline (0.9%) containing EB (2%:

406

5 ml/kg) and NaF (2%: 5 ml/kg) was administrated intravenously to
anesthetized (ketamine/xylazine) rats. After 30 min, anesthetized
rats were perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline. Brains were
excised, meninges and ependymal organs removed, hemispheres
separated, and tissue from MCA area (Sections 2–5) were weighed
and homogenized in 1 ml of 50% trichloroacetic acid. The suspension was divided into two 0.5 ml aliquots. One aliquot was
incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, centrifuged at 10,000xg for 10 min, and
the supernatant measured by absorbance spectroscopy at 620 nm
for EB albumin determination. The other aliquot was centrifuged
at 10,000xg for 10 min and neutralized with 5 N sodium hydroxide. For NaF determination, the supernatant was measured with a
ﬂuorometer at 485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission wavelengths. Standard curves using absorbance from serial dilutions of
EB and NaF were used to determine concentration.
2.7. MMP zymography
Rats were anesthetized (ketamine/xylazine) and perfused
transcardially with 0.1 M PBS at 24 h post-MCAO. Using gel zymography, protein isolated from the MCA regions (Sections 2–5) of
ipsilateral hemispheres was assessed for MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity. Equal concentrations and volumes (50 mg/20 ml) of proteins
were loaded and separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel with 0.1% gelatin. After electrophoresis, gels were washed in 2.5% (w/v) Triton
X-100 for 1 h and then incubated in a developing buffer (50 mM
Tris–HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 2 mm ZnCl2 and 0.02% Brij-35;
pH 7.6) for 48 h at 37 °C. Gels were stained with 1% Coomassie
blue and de-stained in a buffer containing 30% methanol and 10%
glacial acetic acid. Images of gelatinolytic activities were scanned
and analyzed using Image J software.
2.8. Measurement of changes in PKCε, PKCα, PKCδ protein expression at 24 h after MCAO
Rats were anesthetized (ketamine/xylazine) and perfused
transcardially with 0.1 M PBS at 24 h post-MCAO. Brain tissue from
MCA regions (Sections 2–5) of the ipsilateral hemisphere was used
for analysis. Brain tissue was homogenized in 1% SDS (95 °C) and
protein concentration was determined using a Bradford assay kit
(Pierce; Rockford, IL). Samples were loaded with 2X lamelli buffer
at 20 μg of protein/well on 4–12% 10-well gels (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA). Proteins were immunoblotted onto polyvinylidene
ﬂuoride membranes, which were then blocked for non-speciﬁc
binding using 5% fat-free milk/tris buffered saline and Tween 20
for 2 h. Primary antibodies against PKCε, PKCα, and PKCδ (1:200;
Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) were incubated
overnight at 4 °C. A monoclonal β-actin (1:10,000; Cell Signaling)
was used as an endogenous control. Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit
IgG HRP-linked secondary antibodies (1: 2000; Cell Signaling)
were incubated with gentle shaking for 2 h. Molecular weight was
determined using pre-stained standards (Life Technologies). Imaging was conducted using 20X LumiGLO chemiluminescent substrate (Cell Signaling) andi changes in densitometry were analyzed
using ImageJ.
2.9. Immunohistochemistry
Animals were anesthetized with 4% isoﬂurane and transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline and then 10% formalin for 10 min.
Following perfusion the brain was extracted and post-ﬁxed in 10%
formalin overnight. The brain was sliced into seven 2 mm sections
and sections were parafﬁn embedded using the Tissue-Tek TEC
5 embedding system (Sakura Finetek). Tissues were then sliced
with a Leica RM2235 microtome (Leica Microsystems) and
mounted onto slides for staining. Standard ﬂuorescent staining

protocols were utilized for antibodies against PKCα, PKCδ (Santa
Cruz), PKCε (Invitrogen), calcium and receptor for activated C kinase 2 (Rack2); (Abcam). Images were acquired from the MCA
region of the cortex. Imaging for ﬂuorescence was performed
using a Zeiss Axio Observer and the Just Another Co-localization
plugin for ImageJ was used to determine Pearson's coefﬁcient with
background threshold adjusted to baseline.
2.10. Statistical analysis
All data were compiled and analyzed by an investigator blinded
to treatment groups and presented as mean 7 S.E.M. Functional
data and band densities were compared by Student's t-test or
analysis of variance (ANOVA). Mortality data were compared using
Fisher's exact test. Co-localization was reported as a Pearson's rvalue for immunoﬂuorescent staining. Level of signiﬁcance was set
at Po 0.05.

3. Results
3.1. Bryostatin decreased mortality and brain swelling in rats at 24 h
post-MCAO
Bryostatin administration signiﬁcantly (P¼ 0.049) reduced
mortality from 50% in r-tPA alone group (n ¼18) to 11% in the
r-tPA þbryostatin group (n ¼9) (Fig. 1A). No difference (P ¼0.4) in
mNSS was noted between rats in the r-tPA group (10 71; n ¼9)
and the r-tPA þbryostatin group (10 71; n¼ 8) (Fig. 1B). No difference in cortical (P¼ 0.06), striatal (P ¼0.11), or total hemispheric
(P ¼0.59) infarction volume was observed between rats in the
r-tPA (347 3%, 567 5%, 41 73%; n¼ 9) and r-tPA þ bryostatin
(457 4%, 4276%, 44 74%; n ¼8, cortical, striatal, total) groups
(Fig. 1C). A signiﬁcant (P ¼0.0005) reduction in cerebral swelling
was measured in rats from the r-tPA þbryostatin group (19 72%;
n¼ 8) compared to the r-tPA alone group (37% 73%; n¼ 9) at 24 h
post-MCAO (Fig. 1D).
3.2. Bryostatin decreased HT in cortex and total hemisphere of rats
at 24 h post-MCAO
Hemoglobin concentration in the cortex, striatum, and total
cortical hemisphere was measured at 24 h post-MCAO (Fig. 2A). A
signiﬁcant decrease in relative hemoglobin concentrations in cortex (P ¼0.04), striatum (P¼ 0.049), and total cerebral hemisphere
(P ¼0.03) were observed in rats in the r-tPA þbryostatin group
(0.056 70.008, 0727 0.014, 0.064 70.009; n ¼8) compared to rats
in the r-tPA group (0.096 70.015, 0.111 70.030, 0.104 70.014;
n¼ 8). Representative coronal sections show that administration of
bryostatin reduced the severity of hemorrhage at 24 h post-MCAO
(Fig. 2B).
3.3. Bryostatin reduced BBB disruption in cortex, striatum, and total
hemisphere of rats at 24 h post-MCAO
Diffusion of EB-bound albumin into cortex, striatum, and total
hemisphere was measured at 24 h post-MCAO (Fig. 3A). A signiﬁcant decrease in relative EB-bound albumin concentration
within cortex (P¼ 0.03), striatum (P¼ 0.049) and total hemisphere
(P ¼0.03) was observed in the r-tPA þbryostatin group (37 715%,
47 718%, 427 16%; n ¼4) compared to the r-tPA alone group
(100 720%, 100 78%, 100 713%; n ¼5). NaF diffusion into cortex,
striatum, and total hemisphere was measured at 24 h post-MCAO
(Fig. 3B). A signiﬁcant decrease of relative NaF concentrations in
cortex (P ¼0.002), striatum (P¼ 0.02), and total hemisphere
(P ¼0.008) was noted in rats from the r-tPA þbryostatin group

Fig. 3. Changes in BBB post-stroke (A) Measurement of changes in BBB permeability to EB albumin at 24 h post-MCAO showed a signiﬁcant reduction in the cortex, striatum,
and total hemisphere of rats in the r-tPA þbryostatin group (n ¼5) compared to rats in r-tPA alone group (n ¼4). (B) Results showed a signiﬁcant decrease in relative EB
concentration in cortex, striatum and total hemisphere in r-tPA þ bryostatin group (n ¼5) compared with r-tPA group (n¼ 4). (B) Measurement of relative sodium ﬂuorescein

after the onset of ischemia had extensive EB leakage while pretreatment with bryostatin at 2 h had less EB leakage. The leakage of EB is noted in the lateral caudo–putamen
and the somatosensory cortex within the MCA territory. * ¼P o0.05, ** ¼ P o0.01.

(43 76%, 25 76%, 30 75%; n ¼4) compared to the r-tPA alone
group (100 711%, 100 727%, 100 721%; n ¼5). Representative
coronal slices without TTC staining showed that rats in the r-tPA
group had extensive EB albumin leakage compared to rats in the
r-tPA þbryostatin group (Fig. 3C).
3.4. Bryostatin decreased pro-MMP-9 and activated-MMP-9 activities but not MMP-2 levels in ischemic striatum of rats at 24 h postMCAO
Band intensity was quantiﬁed for pro-MMP-9 and activated
MMP-9 (Fig. 4A and B). A signiﬁcant (P ¼0.01) decrease in proMMP-9 levels was observed in rats from the r-tPA þbryostatin
group (27 73%; n ¼4) compared to the r-tPA group (100 724%;
n ¼3). A signiﬁcant (P ¼0.03) decrease in activated MMP-9 levels
was observed in rats from the r-tPA þbryostatin group (69 76%;
n ¼4) compared to the r-tPA group (100 712%; n ¼3). Band intensity was quantiﬁed for MMP-2 (Fig. 4C) with no difference
(P ¼0.54) between rats in the r-tPA group (1007 11%; n ¼3) and
the r-tPA þbryostatin group (1097 8%, n ¼4). A representative
gelatin zymogram shows MMP-2/9 levels for both groups (Fig. 4D).
3.5. Bryostatin increased PKCε protein expression with no change in
PKCδ and PKCα expression in rats at 24 h post-MCAO
A signiﬁcant (P¼ 0.03) increase in PKCε expression was observed in rats from the r-tPA þbryostatin group (194 721%; n ¼4)
compared to the r-tPA group (1007 22%; n ¼3) (Fig. 5A and B). No
difference (P ¼0.23) in PKCδ expression was observed between
rats in the r-tPA group (100 711%; n¼ 3) compared to the
r-tPA þbryostatin group (68 718%; n ¼4) (Fig. 5C and D). No difference (P ¼0.96) in PKCα expression was observed between rats
in the r-tPA group (1007 25%; n ¼ 3) and the r-tPA þbryostatin
group (113 7 18%; n ¼4) (Fig. 5E and F).

3.6. Bryostatin increased PKCε activity with no effect on PKCδ
activity
Calcium serves as an important co-activator for PKCα and PKCδ,
and is necessary for these isozymes to function. We co-stained for
calcium in conjunction with these isozymes and quantiﬁed colocalization with an image J plug-in. A weak correlation was seen
for PKCα and calcium in the control sham group with a Pearson's
coefﬁcient r ¼0.258 (Fig. 6A). A strong correlation was seen for the
r-tPA group r ¼0.773 (Fig. 6B). Although a visible increase in PKCα
was observed in the r-tPA þ bryostatin group, co-localization was
weak r ¼0.255 indicative of reduced activation (Fig. 6C). A weak
correlation was also seen for PKCδ and calcium in the control
sham group r ¼0.155 with strong correlations for the r-tPA group
r ¼0.77 and r-tPA þbryostatin group r ¼0.761 (Fig. 6D–F). Bryostatin had no effect on PKCδ activity. In order for PKCε to exert its
neuroprotective activity, it must be translocated by its chaperone
(RACK2). We co-stained PKCε and RACK2 and found a weak correlation for the control sham group r ¼ 0.307, modest correlation
for the r-tPA group r ¼0.451, and strong correlation for the
r-tPA þbryostatin group r ¼0.819 (Fig. 6G–I). Bryostatin increased
PKCε translocation and activity.

4. Discussion
The primary ﬁnding of this study was that bryostatin administration extended the time window for r-tPA administration out
to 6 h post-MCAO. The mortality rate in this study with bryostatin
and extended r-tPA administration was similar to previous studies
where r-tPA was administered at 2 h (Tan et al., 2013; Kelly et al.,
2009). Results of the study demonstrate that bryostatin improved
survival and reduced cerebral swelling in aged female rats that
received bryostatin at 2 h and r-tPA at 6 h following MCAO. While

Fig. 6. PKC isozyme activity was altered by bryostatin administration in the MCA region. PKCα was weakly co-localized with its co-activator calcium in the sham control
group (A), was strongly co-localized in the r-tPA group (B), and was weakly co-localized in the r-tPA þbryostatin group (C). PKCδ was weakly co-localized with its co-activator
calcium in the sham control group (D), and strongly co-localized in the r-tPA group (E) and r-tPA þ bryostatin group (F). In order for PKCε to be active, it must translocate by
binding to its chaperone RACK2. PKCε was weakly co-localized with RACK2 in the sham control group (G), moderately co-localized in the r-tPA group (H), and strongly colocalized in the r-tPA þbryostatin group (I).

infarct volumes were not signiﬁcantly reduced, the reduction in
cerebral hemisphere swelling is particularly signiﬁcant as edema
formation is one of the most important signs of poor prognosis
following ischemic stroke (Strbian et al., 2013). Additionally, the
increased risk for BBB breakdown and development of HT is a
dangerous complication observed clinically and in rodent models
of ischemic stroke when r-tPA is administered past the recommended time window (Fan et al., 2014). In this study, the
signiﬁcant decrease in hemoglobin measured in the brain parenchyma of rats administered bryostatinþ r-tPA as compared to
rats administered only r-tPA following MCAO showed the potential
therapeutic beneﬁt.
Activation or inhibition of speciﬁc PKC isozymes has been
shown to confer a vasculo-protective effect following ischemia.
PKCε can prevent the generation of reactive oxygen species and
limit intracellular damage (Sun et al., 2013). Bryostatin has been
shown previously to decrease levels of PKCα and increase levels of
PKCε (Tan et al., 2013). Although we report in the current paradigm that bryostatin did not decrease PKCα when administered
prior to r-tPA, it did reduce co-localization with the calcium coactivator on ﬂuorescent IHC. Bryostatin also enhanced translocation of PKCε by its chaperone RACK2 (Schechtman and MochlyRosen, 2001). Bryostatin is a potent modulator of PKC activity and
ongoing research is needed to discover how different dosing

strategies facilitate recovery post-ischemia. The timing, localization, and which PKC isozymes are activated play critical, and
sometimes contrasting, roles in how the injury process progresses
(Hongpaisan and Alkon, 2007). Previous studies demonstrate that
an initial increase in PKCε activity initiates cell survival signaling
pathways following ischemic stroke and reperfusion (Bright and
Mochly-Rosen, 2005). PKCα and PKCδ activation however deregulates the structural and functional integrity of BBB tight junctions
(Qi et al., 2008). Our results show that bryostatin signiﬁcantly upregulated PKCε activation early without signiﬁcant regulation of
PKCα and PKCδ activation. It is likely that PKCα activity would be
down-regulated if bryostatin was administered at a later time
point. The current study suggests that up-regulation of PKCε activation by bryostatin may play a critical role in decreasing damage
to tight junctions within the BBB, and decrease the risk of hemorrhagic transformation following reperfusion by r-tPA.
A strong relationship between MMP-9 and cerebral hemorrhage and BBB disruption in ischemia/ reperfusion injury has been
demonstrated in animals and humans (Wang et al., 2003a). After
activation, MMP-9 degrades matrix proteins of the basal lamina
and the proteins of the extracellular matrix (Woessner, 1991), such
as collagen, ﬁbronectin, and laminin. This degradation leads to BBB
disruption and swelling formation (Rosenberg et al., 1998). Also,
activation of MMP-9 likewise causes the degradation of critical

Z. Tan et al. / European Journal of Pharmacology 764 (2015) 404–412

neurovascular units predisposing to the development of hemorrhage (Hamann et al., 1996). MMPs are therefore terminal enzymes
in the remodeling cascade that result in deleterious brain swelling
and hemorrhage. We demonstrated that bryostatin treatment can
decrease the up-regulation of active MMP-9 but not MMP-2 following ischemic stroke. Our results support that inhibition of
MMP-9 may be one potential mechanism by which bryostatin
improves stroke outcomes following ischemic stroke through reducing BBB disruption, hemorrhagic transformation, and swelling.
Bryostatin's effect on MMP-9 is independent of PKCδ because no
modulation of this isozyme was observed. PKCε has recently been
shown to regulate MMP-9, which might account for our ﬁndings
(Ding et al., 2011).
Due to the marked sexual dimorphism that exists between
young adult and aged male rats, this study used female rats. Using
only female rats maintained the intragroup consistency in terms of
clot diameter and length that was needed to ensure reliable
thrombolysis with r-tPA. As investigation of the beneﬁts of
bryostatin for the treatment of ischemic stroke progress, use of
male subjects will need to be conducted in adherence with STAIR
recommendations. A particular limitation of this study is that the
r-tPA (5 mg/kg; i.v.) dosage used in this study is 5 times higher
than the clinical dose (0.9 mg/kg) administered. The reason is that
the ﬁbrinolytic system in rats has been determined to be 10 times
less responsive to r-tPA than humans; thus most preclinical studies
use a dose of 10 mg/kg to reperfuse the rodent following MCAO
(Jin et al., 2014). In developing our stroke model, we determined
that due to the small clot used and the precise placement of the
clot into the MCA (Z90%), we can use a dose that is half that of
other labs. This reduction in dose has had the beneﬁcial effect of
reducing the likelihood of HT in our model following MCAO (Tan
et al., 2013). The animals in the r-tPA alone group, exhibited extensive hemorrhagic transformation and enlarged infarcts. The
higher mortality rate seen in the r-tPA group may introduce a
survival bias in that the most severely infarcted and impaired
animals died and were excluded from further analysis. Thus, the
difference in parameters between the r-tPA alone and r-tPA þbryostatin groups is likely even larger than reported.

5. Conclusion
Our study shows that bryostatin treatment reduces mortality,
brain swelling, BBB disruption and cerebral hemorrhage with delayed r-tPA treatment for focal ischemic stroke in aged rats. Activation and enhanced translocation of PKCε as well as inhibition of
PKCα activity and MMP-9 levels may explain some of the mechanisms underlying bryostatin's BBB protection and hemorrhagic
reduction. We suggest that the neurovascular protective effects of
bryostatin may support a new therapeutic strategy to reduce BBB
disruption and hemorrhage. EMT personnel could potentially administer bryostatin to suspected stroke patients on the way to the
hospital. This proof-of concept study suggests that bryostatin may
lengthen the time-to-treatment window and enhance the efﬁcacy
and safety of thrombolytic therapy in stroke patients.
