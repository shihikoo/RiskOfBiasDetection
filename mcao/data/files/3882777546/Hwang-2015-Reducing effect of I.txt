Abstract Neuroinflammation is important for the development of several neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and stroke. Since
changes of cytokine level are critical for neuroinflammation in
the brain, we investigated whether IL-32α overexpression
could change neuroinflammation and, thus, affect stroke development. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) induced development of ischemia, and ischemic neuronal cell
death were reduced in IL-32α-overexpressing transgenic mice
(IL-32α mice) brain through the decreased release of
neuroinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α) and activation of astrocytes, but enhancement of anti-neuroinflammatory
cytokines (IL-10). Reactive oxygen species generation and lipid

peroxidation as well as expression of inducible nitric oxide and
cyclooxygenase-2 were also reduced in the IL-32α mice
brain. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), a critical transcriptional factor regulating neuroinflammation, was
much lower, but activation of signal transducer and activator
of transcription 3 (STAT3), which plays a crucial role in cell
survival and proliferation, was much higher in IL-32αoverexpressing mice brain compared to those of wild-type mice
brain. These results suggest that IL-32α can prevent cerebral
ischemia damage via upregulation of anti-neuroinflammatory
cytokine expression and STAT3 activation, but downregulation
of neuroinflammatory cytokines and NF-κB activation.

Introduction
Stroke is the third leading cause of mortality and the first cause
of disability in adults in most developed countries [1].
Although the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator has
been shown to be an effective drug to treat stroke, it must be
administered within 3.5 h of stroke onset, and only a few
patients (less than 3 %) can benefit from this therapy [2].
The physical, emotional, and financial toll stroke inflicts on
the patients and their families cannot be overstated. Therefore,
the development of new methods for stroke intervention is
imperative [3]. To develop new methods, more fundamental
action mechanisms could be elucidated.
Interleukin-32 (IL-32) is a recently discovered inflammatory cytokine produced by T lymphocytes, NK cells, epithelial
cells, and blood monocytes and has six isoforms (IL-32α to
IL-32ζ) [4]. IL-32 induces several other cytokines such as
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1beta (IL1β), interleukin-16 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) [5] and
thereby plays an important role in inflammatory diseases [6].
Our previous studies showed that IL-32β and IL-32γ act as
cytokines inhibiting cancer cell growth through reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines [7]. In another study, IL32γ showed an increase of constitutive IL-10 release, but
reduces TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-32 itself, which accounts for
less inflammation in humans with ulcerative colitis [8, 9].
Thus, it could be possible that similar to these effects, IL-32
could act as an anti-inflammatory cytokine in the brain.
Oxidative stress may be defined as an imbalance between
cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
antioxidants. The processes associated with inflammatory
responses are complex and often involved in the production
of ROS. There are many mediators, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α which initiate and amplify
oxidative stress in inflammatory cells [10]. Reactive oxygen
species (ROS) are known to have a critical role in brain
damage after a brain stroke [11–13]. ROS are produced under
the hypoxic conditions found in an ischemic brain and induce
the release of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, consequently inducing necrotic or apoptotic neuronal cell death.
Expression profiles of antioxidants in brain tissues from a
variety of patients including ones with stroke, Parkinson’s
disease (PD), and Alzheimer’s disease showed lower antioxidant levels [14–17]. Recent presented data also showed that,
neuroinflammation is closely associated with oxidative stressmediated neurodegeneration [18, 19].
The transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-кB)
pathway is the most distinctive, leading to the production of
various inflammatory mediators, including cytokines,
chemokines, and vasoactive peptides [20]. Activation of
NF-κB is triggered by phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of inhibitor of κB (IκB). This process subsequently

649

leads to the translocation of the free NF-κB to the nucleus,
where it promotes the expression of pro-inflammatory genes
such as pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β,
etc.), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and inducible nitric oxide
synthase [21, 21]. These have been demonstrated to cause
neuronal apoptosis [22, 23]. In an ischemic brain injury, mice
lacking the p50 subunit of NF-κB develop significantly smaller infarcts after transient focal ischemia [24, 25]. Other studies
have also proved that the activation of NF-κB is linked to the
pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia [26–28].
Signal transducers and activators of transcription 3
(STAT3) also play a crucial role in neuronal cell survival
and proliferation. Injury to neuronal cells could induce the
activation of STAT3, and STAT3 activation has been shown to
cause neuroprotection [29, 30]. The activation of STAT3
signaling pathway proved to be necessary as a protective
mechanism during heart ischemia [31, 32]. Several cytokines
and growth factors released after injury in the body are believed to function as key regulators for the activation of
STAT3 during cerebral ischemia [33]. The phosphorylation
of tyrosine on STAT3 by Janus kinases (JAKs) has been found
to increase after cerebral ischemia and provides neuronal
protection [29].
Considering the significance of cytokines, and the relationship between ROS and neuroinflammation in the development
of neurodegenerative diseases, we investigated whether IL32α could inhibit neuroinflammation and oxidative stress via
alternative regulation of other cytokines in the development of
stroke. We also investigated the involvement of NF-κB and
STAT3 pathways by IL-32α in this process.

Methods
Generation of IL-32-Transgenic Mice
The generation of IL-32 overexpressed transgenic mice was
described previously [7]. The IL-32 level was significantly
higher in IL-32α overexpressed transgenic mice compared to
non-transgenic mice [7]. All of the experimental procedures
were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) of Chungbuk National University (approval
number: CBNUA-144-1001-01).
Ischemia Surgery
The acclimated C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized with a gas
mixture of 75 % N2O and 25 % O2. The right common carotid
artery and the right external carotid artery (ECA) were exposed through a midline neck incision. The ECA was dissected distally, ligated, and coagulated along with the terminal
lingual and maxillary artery branches. A minimal incision was
made in the ECA stump, at an angle of incidence, with

650

iridectomy scissors. Following the incision, occlusion of the
middle cerebral artery (MCA) was performed by sutures
(Doccol Corp, Sharon, MA, 0.22 mm). During the occlusion
period and postoperative period (1 h after occlusion), the
animals were kept on a thermostatically controlled warming
plate in order to maintain body temperature at 37 °C to prevent
hypothermia. Following the occlusion, the clips were removed to restore blood for recirculation. The same surgically
operated animals without cerebral artery occlusion served as
control animals.
Assessment of Neurological Deficit Score
Neurological deficits were evaluated as reported by Longa
et al. [34]. Check the five types of disorder ((1) failure to
extend the left forepaw, (2) decreased grip strength of forepaw,
(3) circling left by pulling the tail, (4) spontaneous circling,
and (5) falling down). Then rating 1 point each assessment,
and the scores were totaled up. Neurological function assessment was performed by an investigator blinded to the experimental groups.
Rota-rod Test
The rota-rod test was performed 1 day after surgery. Mice
were placed on a rota-rod treadmill at an accelerating speed
from 10 rpm for 3 min. The latency to fall was measured, and
the mice were trained before the experiment to remain
on a 25-mm diameter rod rotating at 10 rpm for 120 s.
Two or three trials were sufficient for the animals to learn
this task.

Cresyl Violet Staining
The brains were taken out from the skull and postfixed in 4 %
paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C. The brains were transferred to 30 % sucrose solutions. Subsequently, the brains
were cut into 25-μm sections by using cryostat microtome
(Leica CM1850; Leica Microsystems, Seoul, Korea).
The sections of the brains were thoroughly washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove the excess
fixative agent and then transferred to gelatin-coated slide
glasses and stained with 0.1 % cresyl violet (2–5 min) for
the purpose of identifying cortical layers and cytoarchitectural
features of the isocortical region. After this, the sections were
washed in distilled water then dehydrated through ascending
grades of ethanol, 50, 70, 90, and 100 % ethanol for 2 min in
each grade followed by 10 min immersion in a 1:1 mixture of
absolute alcohol and xylene. They were cleared in xylene for
5–10 min and mounted in mounting medium (Cytoseal™
XYL; Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, CA).
Reactive Oxygen Species Generation
Generation of ROS was assessed by 2,7-dichlorofluores-cein
diacetate (DCFH-DA, Sigma Aldrich), an oxidation-sensitive
fluorescent probe. Intracellular H2O2 or low-molecular-weight
peroxides can oxidize 2,7-dichlorofluoresce in diacetate to the
highly fluorescent compound dichlorofluorescein (DCF).
Briefly, tissue lysates were plated in black 96-well plate and
incubated with 10 μM DCFH-DA at 37 °C for 4 h.
Fluorescence intensity of DCF was measured in a microplate
reader at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission
wavelength of 538 nm.

Morphometric Determination of Infarct Volume
Lipid Peroxidation
For the detection of the ischemia infarction area of the brain, a
cross-sectional infarction area on the surfaces of each brain
slice was defined by the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) staining method. After 1-h reperfusion, the gerbils
received an intracardiac perfusion of 0.9 % buffered saline.
The brain was then removed and cut into 2-mm serial slices
starting 1 mm from the frontal pole. The coronal slices were
then immersed in a 2 % phosphate-buffered solution for
50 min at 37 °C. After TTC staining, the slices were fixed in
a 10 % phosphate-buffered formalin, and the infarction area
was then determined by an image analyzer using the Leica
Qwin program (Leica Microsystems Imaging Solution Ltd.,
Cambridge, UK). The infarct area (mm2) from each 2-mm
thick brain slice was determined through image program (Sion
image, Scion Corporation, MD), and then the infarct volume
of the whole brain (mm3) was calculated by the sum of all the
slice (seven slices in one brain) infarct areas’ volume×thickness (2 mm). The relative infarction volumes were indicated
by the percentage of control brain infarction volume.

The formation of malonaldehyde, as a lipid peroxidation
product in the whole brain homogenate of ipsilateral hemisphere (or left hemisphere of the sham-operated control), was
determined using lipid peroxidation assay kit (Cell Biolabs,
Inc. San Diego, CA).
Western Blot Analysis
The brain tissues were homogenized with lysis buffer (PROPREP; iNtRON, Sungnam, Korea; n=8 mice per group) and
centrifuged at 2,500×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of
total protein (40 μg) isolated from brain tissues were resolved
on 8 or 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels and
then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL;
Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Membranes
were incubated at room temperature for 2 h with the following
specific antibodies: anti-COX-2, anti-IκB, anti-p-IκB, antiSTAT3 (Tyr 705), anti-p-STAT3 (Tyr 705) (Cell Signaling

Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), anti-inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS) (1:1,000 Novus Biologicals, Inc., Littleton,
CO), anti-p50, anti-p65, anti-BOX, anti-cleaved caspase-3
(1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc., Santa Cruz,
CA), and anti-β-actin (1:2,500; Sigma, St Louis, MO). Blots
were then incubated at room temperature for 2 h with corresponding peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (1:2,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz,
CA). Immunoreactive proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection
system. The relative density of the protein bands was scanned
densitometrically using My Image (SLB, Seoul, Korea) and
quantified by Lab Works 4.0 (UVP, Upland, CA).
Gel Electromobility Shift Assay
Gel shift assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, 5×106 cells
were washed twice with 1× PBS, followed by the addition of
1 ml of PBS, and then cells were scraped into a cold Eppendorf
tube. Cells were spun down at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and the
resulting supernatant was removed. Cells were suspended in
400 μl of solution A containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9,
1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; vigorously vortexed; allowed to
incubate on ice for 10 min; and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for
6 min. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in solution C
(solution A+420 mM NaCl, 20 % glycerol) and allowed to
incubate on ice for 20 min. The cells were centrifuged at
15,000 rpm for 15 min, and the resulting nuclear extract supernatant was collected in a chilled Eppendorf tube. Consensus
oligonucleotides were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P] ATP for 10 min at 37 °C. Gel shift reactions
were assembled and allowed to incubate at room temperature for
10 min followed by the addition of 1 μl (50,000–200,000 cpm)
of 32P end-labeled oligonucleotide and another 20 min of incubation at room temperature. Subsequently, 1 μl of gel loading
buffer was added to each reaction and loaded onto a 6 % nondenaturing gel and electrophoresis until the dye was four fifths of
the way down the gel. The gel was dried at 80 °C for 1 h and
exposed to film overnight at −70 °C.
Immunohistochemical Staining
After being anesthetized with diethyl ether, subgroups of mice
were perfused intracardially with 50 ml saline. The brains
were taken out from the skull and postfixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C. The brains were transferred to
30 % sucrose solutions. Subsequently, brains were cut into
25-μm sections by using cryostat microtome (Leica CM1850;
Leica Microsystems, Seoul, Korea). After multiple washing in
PBS, endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubation of the samples in 3 % hydrogen peroxide in PBS for

651

30 min, followed by a 10-min wash in PBS. The sections were
then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a rabbit/
mouse polyclonal antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), iNOS (1:300; Novus Biologicals, Inc., Littleton,
CO) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against COX-2,
p-STAT3 (Tyr 705) (1:300; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.,
Beverly, MA). After incubation with the primary antibodies,
sections were washed in PBS before being incubated for 1 h at
room temperature in the presence of biotinylated goat antirabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (1:1,000;
Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were then
washed with PBS and incubated with avidin–peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min before
the immunocomplex was visualized using the chromogen 3,3diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).
Sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin. Finally,
sections were dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylene, and
covered with Permount (n=8 mice per group).
Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism 4 software
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Data (tumor volumes and
weights) are presented as mean±SD. The homogeneity of
variances was assessed using the Bartlett’s test. When the
variances were homogeneous, differences were assessed by
a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Other data were
assessed by ANOVA. When the P value in the ANOVA test
indicated statistical significance, the differences were assessed
by the Dunnett’s test. A value of P<0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.

Results
Effect of IL-32α on Behavior Disorder
IL-32α-transgenic mice were compared behavior disorder
with the non-transgenic mice during ischemia/reperfusion
using the assessment of neurological deficit score and rotarod tests. A neurological deficit score on a 5-point rating scale
is commonly used for the evaluation of neurological function
in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model [35]. The
neurological deficit score is measured according to the five
types of disorders ((1) failure to extend the left forepaw, (2)
decreased grip strength of forepaw, (3) circling to left by
pulling the tail, (4) spontaneous circling, and (5) falling
down). This assessment is to determine the prevention effect
of IL-32α on behavior disorder. The IL-32α mice exhibited
lower scores of neurological deficit by 24-h ischemia reperfusion compared to the non-transgenic mice (Fig. 1a). Rotarod test was measured to determine the prevention of motor
deficit effect of IL-32α. One day before the rota-rod test, all

neuroinflammation. Thus, we determined cell death rate to see
whether IL-32α could change induction of neuronal cell death
by ischemia/reperfusion. We examined cresyl violet staining.
Histopathological changes were predominantly limited to the
injured brain and involved in the cortex and striatum. After
ischemia/reperfusion and stained with cresyl violet, neuronal
depletion was significantly elevated in the non-transgenic
mice brain, but in IL-32α overexpressed transgenic mice
brain, neuronal loss was significantly lowered compared to
non-transgenic mice brain (Fig. 2a). No significant neuronal
depletion was apparent in the control brain. The number of
viable neurons in whole brains (% of cresyl violet-stained
area) were quantitatively analyzed (Fig. 2b). Western blot data
for Bax and caspase-3 (a pro-apoptotic protein) expression
was also decreased in IL-32α mice brain by ischemia/
reperfusion compared to the expression in non-transgenic
mice brain (Fig. 2c).

were trained on learning day. After 1 day, the retention time on the test
stick was recorded (b). Brain infarction after ischemia/reperfusion caused
by the occlusion of the bilateral common carotid artery. The brain infarction was detected in brain slices cut at 6-mm away from the frontal pole

the “Methods” section (c). The graph represents quantitation of infarction
area (d). Each value is presented as mean±SD from eight mice. *P<0.05

mice were placed on the rota-rod treadmill at a speed of
10 rpm for 3 min. The latency to fall after ischemia/
reperfusion (42.27±7.3 s) was significantly increased compared to non-transgenic mice (13.4±1.25 s) (Fig. 1b).
Effect of IL-32α on Ischemia/Reperfusion-Induced Brain
Infarction
The effect of the ischemia and reperfusion time on brain
infarct was examined initially. Different degrees of ischemia
infarction volume were created by varying duration of ischemia and reperfusion (data not shown). The highest infarct
volume (total infarction volume was 26±3 %) was induced
in the non-transgenic mice after ischemia/reperfusion. In IL32α overexpressed mice, the ischemia/reperfusion-induced
brain infarction was lowered (9±4 %) (Fig. 1c, d).
Effect of IL-32α on Cellular Apoptosis Caused
by Ischemia/Reperfusion
Neuronal cell death is a major factor (or you can say is
a major cause) in the development of a stroke through

Biochemical parameters were compared between the brain after
ischemia/reperfusion and control brains. The hydrogen peroxide level was significantly increased by the ischemia/
reperfusion (from 195±93 to 688±76 nmole/mg protein) in
the non-transgenic mice brain, but the increase of hydrogen
peroxide level was significantly lowered in the IL-32α
overexpressed mice brain (to 501±99 nmole/mg protein)
(Fig. 3a). The lipid peroxidation product (malonaldehyde) level
was also significantly increased by ischemia/reperfusion (to
0.78±0.1 μg/ml) in non-transgenic mice brain. However, the
increase of lipid peroxidation products was also lowered in IL32a overexpressed mice brain (to 0.57±0.02 μg/ml, Fig. 3b).
Effect of IL-32α on Inflammatory Cytokine Levels
Pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β play
important roles in inflammatory disease. Ischemia/
reperfusion significantly elevated TNF-α and IL-1β levels
in non-transgenic mice brain. However, TNF-α, IL-1β, and
IL-6 release were inhibited in IL-32α overexpressed mice
brain (Fig. 3c–e). However, anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL10 (Fig. 3f), level was significantly increased after ischemia/
reperfusion in IL-32α overexpressed mice brain.
Effect of IL-32α on Activation of Astrocyte and Expression
of COX-2 and iNOS
Activation of astrocytes is one of the characteristic features in
neuroinflammation, and they can promote inflammatory
responses when they are activated. We thus compared
activation of astrocytes in the brains of IL-32α overexpressed
transgenic mice and non-transgenic mice after ischemia/
reperfusion. GFAP-reactive cell number (activated astrocytes)

was elevated in the brains of ischemic-injured non-transgenic
mice brain, but the cell number was significantly lower in
ischemia/reperfusion IL-32α overexpressed transgenic mice
brain compared to the brains of non-transgenic mice (Fig. 4a).
To confirm these results, we investigated the expression
of GFAP by Western blot analysis. The results revealed that
the GFAP levels were significantly decreased in IL-32α
overexpressed transgenic mice brain by ischemia/reperfusion
compared with non-transgenic mice brain (Fig. 4b). We also
investigated the effect of IL-32α overexpression on neuroinflammation; thus, the expression of iNOS and COX-2 were
determined by immunohistochemical analysis and Western
blot. Expression of the inflammatory proteins such as iNOS
and COX-2 in the brain of ischemic-injured IL-32α
overexpressed mice brain was much lower than in nontransgenic mice brain.

Effect of IL-32α on NF-κB and STAT3 DNA-Binding
Activity
The activation of NF-κB plays a critical role in neuroinflammation since it controls several genes involving neuroinflammation as well as ROS generation. To determine whether
overexpression of IL-32α could decrease the activation of
NF-κB in the ischemia/reperfusion brain, we measured the
DNA-binding activity of NF-κB by gel electromobility shift
assay (EMSA), and translocations of p50 and p65 into nucleus
and the protein expression were determined by Western blotting. The DNA-binding activity of NF-κB (Fig. 5a) and the
nuclear translocations of p50 and p65 (Fig. 5c) in the
ischemic-injured brain of non-transgenic and IL-32αoverexpressed transgenic mice brain were increased.
Ischemia/reperfusion also increased the phosphorylation of

determined by ELISA. Method was as described detail in the “Methods”

IκB. However, activity of NF-κB and the nuclear translocations of p50 and p65 in the brain of ischemia/reperfusion
IL-32α overexpressed transgenic mice were much lower
than those in the non-transgenic mice brain (Fig. 5c).
Dissimilar to NF-κB, the DNA-binding activity of STAT3 and
phosphorylated STAT3 levels were higher in the brains of IL32α overexpressed transgenic mice compared to the nontransgenic mice after ischemia/reperfusion brain (Fig. 5b, d).
These findings indicate that reduced NF-κB activation and
increased STAT3 activation in IL-32α overexpressed transgenic mice brain may be associated with not only decreased
neuroinflammation and oxidative damages but also ischemic
brain injury.

reduce ischemia/reperfusion-mediated brain injury; however,
action mechanisms are not clear.
The induction of cerebral ischemia by the MCAO in animals is a commonly used method to investigate the pathophysiology of stroke [34, 36]. Furthermore, the occlusion of
MCA caused increase of ROS production. It was found that
MCAO was accompanied by a steady increase of ROS production [37]. Inflammatory cytokines play an important role
in induction of cerebral ischemia by the MCAO. Recently,
studies demonstrated that after MCAO, the level of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) was increased
[38–40]. In other studies, anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10,
reduced infarct volumes after MCAO by multiple routes [41,
42], but IL-10-deficient mice developed larger infarcts after
MCAO [43]. ROS is known to cause macromolecular damage
such as lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and DNA oxidation which contribute to ischemic brain injury [44].
Regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines is also intimately
related with generation of ROS. In a recently study, expressions of pro-inflammation-related genes such as IL-1, IL-6,
and TNF-α were increased by the induction of ROS via
transcription and NF-κB-dependent mechanisms [21, 45].
Thus, glutathione which is a famous antioxidant, regulates
inflammation in mouse model through ROS degeneration
[46]. ROS and cytokines are also important factors in the
apoptotic process in the brain. The excess generation of
ROS leads to apoptotic cell death via increased mitochondrial
membrane permeability and damages the respiratory chain

Discussion
Our present data showed that MCAO-induced development of
ischemia brain damages were reduced in the IL-32α
overexpressed transgenic mice brains compared to nontransgenic mice brains. Less behavior disorder in the IL-32α
overexpressed transgenic mice was associated with decreased
neuroinflammatory cytokines and ROS level and apoptotic
neuronal cell death in the brain. It was also found that the
activation of STAT3 in the brains of the IL-32α overexpressed
transgenic mice was significantly higher, but NF-κB activation was significantly lowered in IL-32α overexpressed mice
after ischemia/reperfusion. Thus, it is clear that IL-32α could

Fig. 4 Effect of IL-32α on the expression of COX-2, iNOS, and GFAP.
The effect of IL-32α on reactive astrocytes was measured by immunohistochemical analysis and Western blotting analysis. The sections of
mice brain were incubated with anti-GFAP, COX-2, and iNOS
primary antibody and the biotinylated secondary antibody (n=3).

The representative stained tissues were viewed with a microscope
(×50 or 200) (a). Expression of GFAP, COX-2, and iNOS were
also examined by specific antibodies in the brain (b). The graph represents arbitrary density of each blot (c). Each blot is representative for three
mice

[47]. ROS also has been known to promote caspase-3 activation, and many chemicals such as toluene increase the activity
of caspase-3, leading to apoptosis by ROS [48]. In this study,
ROS generation was significantly decreased in IL-32α
overexpressed transgenic mouse brain compared to nontransgenic mouse brain after ischemia/reperfusion. It was also
found that, IL-32-transgenic mice showed lower levels of lipid
peroxidation with higher glutathione levels after ischemia/
reperfusion brain injury. The expression level of proinflammatory cytokine levels (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α) was
also decreased, but anti-inflammation cytokine IL-10 was
elevated in IL-32α overexpressed transgenic mouse brain
after ischemia/reperfusion. These data indicate that overexpression of IL-32α could protect ischemia/reperfusioninduced brain injury through reduction of not only expression
of pro-inflammatory cytokine but also ROS generation.
However, action mechanisms are not clear.

It is interesting to know that NF-κB is shortly upregulated
by the ischemia-induced brain injury [28, 49–51]. NF-κB is a
positive regulator in the expression of a variety of rapidresponse genes involved in inflammatory and reactive oxidative stress [52–54] which significantly contribute to the biochemical consequence of ischemic brain injury. Many stimuli,
including IL-1 and TNF-α, activate NF-κB in cells to cause
oxidative stress or pro-inflammatory brain injury. Moreover,
ischemia-induced brain damages in rats were significantly
elevated via stimulating NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses [55]. In a recent study, it was also demonstrated that
inhibition of NF-κB-mediated suppression of local inflammation after cerebral ischemia might contribute to neuroprotection [56]. Other studies have also shown that NF-κB
inactivation protects neurons against oxidative stresses
or ischemia-induced neurodegeneration via expression of
genes encoding anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 [54, 57]

in the nuclear extracts of brain of IL-32α transgenic mice. Decreased
effect of IL-32α overexpressed transgenic mice on nuclear translocation
of p50, p65, pIκBα, and IκBα expression (c). The graph represents
arbitrary density of each blot (p50 and p65 and pIκBα and IκBα) (d).

Increased effect of IL-32α overexpressed transgenic mice on pSTAT3
expression (e). Nuclear translocation of p50, p65, pIκBα, IκBα, pSTAT3,
and STAT3 expression levels in the brain were determined by Western
blots. Each blot is representative for three mice. The graph represents
arbitrary density of each blots (STAT3 and pSTAT3) (f)

and downregulation of the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax
and Fas which are critical downstream target genes of the
NF-κB pathway [58]. Furthermore, acute brain injury induced
by intracerebral injection of IL-1 provoked rapid activation of
brain NF-κB. NF-κB knockout mice, which lack the antiinflammatory p50, had brain injury associated with increased
neutrophil recruitment to the brain compared with wild-type
mice [59]. Another study also showed ischemia/reperfusion
damage was significantly reduced in the p50 knockout when
compared to wild-type mice [60]. Thus, lowered activation of
NF-κB in IL-32α overexpressed transgenic mice brain could
be a significant protective mechanism. In this regard, we
found that NF-κB activation was significantly lowered in IL32α overexpressed transgenic mice brain after MCAO. With

this lowered activation of NF-κB, we also found that the
expression of pro-apoptotic NF-κB target proteins such as
Bax and caspase-3 was greatly decreased in the ischemia/
reperfusion injured brain of IL-32α overexpressed transgenic
mice brain compared to non-transgenic mice. It was also
found that neuronal cell death was greatly decreased in the
IL-32α overexpressed transgenic mice brain compared to
non-transgenic mice brain after ischemia/reperfusion.
Astrocytes have been shown to increase their survival via
protection of neurons from neuroinflammation. Controlling
astrocyte functions is an important strategy to enhance neuronal survival and improve the outcome following cerebral
ischemia. Astrocytes have been shown to protect neurons
from oxidative stress by increasing neuronal glutathione levels

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 51:648–660

[61, 62]. Activation of astrocytes releases many soluble factors such as ROS, NO, TNF-α, and IL-1β which are critical
for neuronal cell death [63]. Similarly, a recent study showed
that high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β,
IL-6, and TNF-α, mostly produced by reactive astrocytes, are
also detected in the brain [64]. Additionally, recent studies
have shown that astrocytes may use NF-κB as a mediator of
transcriptional responses to a variety of stimuli, including
tissue injury and diseases [65–67]. In this regard, a lower
elevation of neuroinflammation evidenced by the expression
of iNOS and COX-2 could be related with a lower induction
level of GFAP expression (activation of astrocyte). Moreover,
in response to brain injury, astrocytes become reactive and
express various inflammatory mediators that play important
roles in secondary injury causing neuronal cell death. In this
study, not only were the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines
significantly decreased but also activation of astrocytes were
significantly decreased in the ischemia/reperfusion-injured
brain of IL-32α overexpressed transgenic mice brain compared to non-transgenic mice. These data thus indicate the
protective effect of IL-32α against cerebral ischemic injury, at
least in part, through the lessening of ischemia-induced generation of pro-inflammatory factors as well as NF-κB via
inactivation of astrocytes.
Activation of STAT3 was upregulated in the IL-32α
overexpressed transgenic mice brain in this study after
ischemia/reperfusion. The phosphorylation of tyrosine on
STAT3 by JAKs has been found to increase after cerebral
ischemia and provide neuronal protection [29]. Experimental
evidence suggests that cerebral ischemic stress activates the
JAK/STAT pathway [68]. Suzuki et al. (2001) elucidated the
chronological, topographical, and cellular alterations in
pSTAT3 protein in a transient cerebral ischemia rat model.
Another study suggests that the activation of STAT3 in the
ischemic rat brain mediated anti-apoptosis and caused a neuroprotective effect [69]. Activation of STAT3 regulates the
transcription of target proteins, such as Bcl-2, which is known
to protect against both apoptotic [70] and necrotic death [71].
In vivo, activation of STAT3 and DNA-binding activity were
increased in neurons, microglia, and astrocyte during reperfusion [72, 73]. Another study showed that aged rats, which
showed enhanced neurodegeneration and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, when compared to young
rats after ischemia/reperfusion, the STAT3 activation was also
reduced [72]. Furthermore, in STAT3 knockout (KO)
(neuronal-specific) mice, the adaptive response to ischemic
injury, activation of pro-survival/repair, antioxidant, and
energy-related activities were delayed [74]. These studies
support the protective effect of STAT3 signaling in the brain
physiology. In our study, activation of STAT3 was significantly increased in IL-32α overexpressed transgenic mice brain
compared to non-transgenic mice brain after ischemia/
reperfusion. These data suggest that the increase of STAT3

657

activation could also contribute to neuroprotective effects in
IL-32α overexpressed transgenic mice.
Our data indicated that IL-32α exerts a neuroprotective
role through the stimulation of STAT3, but inhibits NF-κB
signaling pathways. Similar to our present data, we found that
IL-32γ ameliorated acetaminophen-induced liver damages as
well as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced brain damages in Parkinson’s models using our transgenic mice (unpublished data). We also found that IL-32γ
inhibits cancer cell growth through inactivation of NF-κB and
STAT3 signals [7]. In another study, IL-32β was reported to
promote the production of IL-10 in human cell lines [4]. Choi
et al. elucidated the paradoxical effect of IL-32. They demonstrated that IL-32γ overexpressed transgenic mice exhibited
an exacerbated acute inflammation early following the initiation of dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. However, after
6 days, there was less chronic inflammation and improved
survival rate compared with wild-type mice [9]. Even though
IL-32 was expressed and the level could be elevated in the
inflammatory diseases, the role of IL-32 is not clear whether it
can act as a preventive or causative factor. Thus, the time and
disease status dependences and complicated regulation of IL32 on the inflammatory responses during the course of inflammatory diseases should be further elucidated. However,
our present data suggest that IL-32α could protect ischemia/
reperfusion-mediated brain injury.
