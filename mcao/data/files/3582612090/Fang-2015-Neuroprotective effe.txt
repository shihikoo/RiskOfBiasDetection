Atorvastatin has been reported to ameliorate ischemic brain damage after stroke, but the underlying
mechanisms are not clear. This study investigated the effect of atorvastatin on dynamic expressions of
MMP9 and TIMP1 in rats after cerebral ischemia reperfusion (I/R). Atorvastatin (5 mg kg−1 d−1 ) or vehicle was administered orally to rats for 21d before middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) for 2 h, with
perfusion at 3-, 12-, 24-, 48-, or 96-h thereafter. To evaluate functional outcome, a 5-point behavioral rating scale was performed. Ischemic lesion volume was assessed via triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC)
staining. mRNA levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were detected by reverse transcription-PCR, and protein
levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were measured by immunohistochemical SABC method. At all reperfusion
time points, atorvastatin pretreatment was associated with signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) improved neurological
function and reduced brain infarct sizes compared with vehicle treatment, and MMP9 levels were significantly (P < 0.05) lower and TIMP1 levels were signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) higher in both mRNA and protein
levels. In conclusion, Oral administration of atorvastatin before stroke may reduce the severity in I/R
injury and improve neurological outcome by lowering MMP9 levels and elevating TIMP1 levels.

1. Introduction
Stroke is a devastating neurological disease with high rates of
morbidity, disability, and mortality. It also places a great emotional
and ﬁnancial burden on families and society [3]. There is currently
no satisfactory drug for clinical treatment of stroke.
Blood-brain barrier injury and neuronal death after cerebral
ischemia and reperfusion(I/R) is accompanied by increased lev-

els and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), an effect
that is attenuated by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1
(TIMP1) [2,9,13,16,20]. Thus, it is reasonable to suppose that
the effects of treatment after cerebral ischemic injury may be
evaluated by monitoring changes in the levels of MMP9 and
TIMP1.
Statins (or, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl [HMG]-coenzyme A
[CoA] reductase inhibitors) are the principle agents applied to lower
serum cholesterol, but they also have other associated protective
effects including signiﬁcant reduction in cerebrovascular disease
[1,10,21,24]. The present study investigated, via the temporal
changes in expressions of MMP9 and TIMP1, whether atorvastatin has a neuroprotective role against injury due to cerebral I/R
injury.

(mm3 ) were calculated by multiplying the appropriate area with
the section/interval thickness.

The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Dalian Medical University, China, approved this study.
2.1. Study design
Ninety-six adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (180–220 g) were
provided by the Laboratory Animal Center of Dalian Medical University, China. Rats were randomly apportioned to a sham-operated
(n = 16), ischemia–reperfusion (I/R; n = 40), or I/R-atorvastatin
(n = 40) group. The I/R-atorvastatin group received atorvastatin (5
mg kg−1 d−1 ; Pﬁzer, NY, USA), while the sham-operated and I/R
groups received the normal saline vehicle; the atorvastatin or normal saline was administered orally for 21 d before experiments.
In the I/R and I/R-atorvastatin groups, the right middle cerebral
artery was occluded for 2 h, and then perfused for 3, 12, 24, 48, or
96 h (n = 8, from each group). The neurological function of each rat
was assessed after perfusion, before euthanasia. Four brains each
from the I/R or I/R-atorvastatin groups were reserved for immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, and the other 4 brains of each group
were used for infarct area measurement. For the sham-operated
group, only immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR were performed,
at 24 h and 48 h (n = 4, each).
2.1.1. Rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO)-reperfusion
The rat MCAo model was established with reference to the
method of Longa et al. [14]. Brieﬂy, rats were anesthetized with 10%
chloral hydrate (0.3 mL/kg, Wuhan Hechang Chemical, China). The
right common, external, and internal carotid arteries were exposed.
A 40-mm length of 4-0 monoﬁlament nylon suture (DAIWA, Japan)
was heated near a ﬂame to round its tip, and then advanced from
the external carotid artery into the lumen of the internal carotid
artery until mild resistance was felt, indicating that the tip was at
the origin of the middle cerebral artery. Sham-operated animals
underwent the same operative procedure, but without insertion of
the suture into the internal carotid artery.
Two hours after MCAO, animals were reanesthetized with 10%
chloral hydrate (0.3 mL/kg, Wuhan Hechang Chemical, China), and
reperfusion was performed by withdrawal of the suture until resistance was felt. Rats with successful I/R awoke about 1 h after
surgery, and showed one of the following signs: circling to the
left; left forepaw adduction when lifted by the tail; or right Honer’s
syndrome.
2.1.2. Evaluation of neurological function
Neurological evaluations were carried out using a 5-point
behavioral rating scale as described in Longa et al. [14]: 0, no neurological deﬁcit; 1, failure to fully extend the left forepaw; 2, circling
or walking to the left side; 3, falling to the left side; and 4, walking
only when stimulated. Investigators were blinded to the grouping.
2.1.3. Measurement of ischemic lesion volume
Ischemic lesion volume was assessed via triphenyl tetrazolium
chloride (TTC) staining [5]. Brieﬂy, animals were anesthetized
intraperitoneally with 10% chloral hydrate (0.3 mL/kg, Wuhan
Hechang Chemical, China), transcardially perfused with 0.9%
sodium, and the brains removed. Brain tissues were cut into coronal
slices, 2 mm in thickness. Tissues from corresponding sections of I/R
and I/R-atorvastatin groups were stained at 37 ◦ C in 4% TTC (Arcros,
Belgium) for 30 min and then ﬁxed using 4% paraformaldehyde. The
ﬁgures were captured with a digital camera (Canon, Japan). The
areas of lesion were measured by tracing the areas observed on the
photos with a Luxex-Fimage analyzer (Fuji, Japan). The volumes

2.1.4. Tissue preparation for reverse transcription-PCR and
immunohistochemistry
Rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal administration of
10% chloral hydrate (0.3 mL/kg, Wuhan Hechang Chemical, China)
and transcardially perfused with 0.9% sodium chloride. The brains
were rapidly removed, and brain tissues were kept −2 mm to
3 mm (anterior-posterior). One hundred milligrams of the ischemic
boundary of the cortex and subcortex from the anterior half of the
tissues were cut into small pieces and homogenized in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction (below). The posterior half of the tissues
were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 ◦ C for 24–48 h, dehydrated
at room temperature by sucrose gradient (10%, 20%, and 30%; Qingdao Yufengda Fine Chemical Industry, China), embedded in methyl
cellulose (Qingdao Yufengda Fine Chemical Industry, China), and
stored at −20 ◦ C for 10 min for future processing. Coronal brain sections (5-␮m thick) were cut on a cryostat and thaw-mounted onto
gelatin-coated slides for immunostaining.

2.1.5. RNA isolation and reverse transcription-PCR ampliﬁcation
Total RNA from the prepared tissues mentioned above was isolated using Trizol reagent in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Reverse transcription
was conducted using the kit for RT-PCR in accordance with the manufacturer’s procedure (Takara, Dalian, China). Polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) was performed in a thermal cycler (Thermohybaid,
IL, USA). Program parameters provided by the manufacturer were:
2 min at 94 ◦ C, 1 min at 94◦ C, 1 min at 54 ◦ C, and 1 min at 72 ◦ C.
Samples were ampliﬁed in 35 cycles. The PCR product was resolved
via 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, photographed, and documented
with a GDS-8000 Gel Documentation Systems densitometer (UVP,
CA, USA) under UV light. Optical density was analyzed using LabWorks 3.0 software provided by the manufacturer (UVP, CA, USA).
Primers used in this study were designed by Takara (Takara,
Dalian, China): MMP9 (forward, 5 -AAG GAT GGT CTA CTG GCA C-3 ;
reverse, 5 -AGA GAT TCT CAC TGG GGC-3 ), TIMP1 (forward, 5 -ACA
GCT TTC TGC AAC TCG-3 ; reverse, 5 -CTA TAG GTC TTT ACG AAG
GCC-3 ), and ␤-actin (forward, 5 -CGT GCG TGA CAT TAA AGA -3 ;
reverse, 5 -CTG GAA GGT GGA CAG TGA G -3 ).

2.1.6. Immunohistochemistry for presence of MMP9 and TIMP1
Brain tissues prepared as above were processed using a SABA kit
in accordance with the manufacturer’s procedure (BOSTER, Wuhan,
China). To detect MMP9 and TIMP1 molecules, goat anti-MMP9 and
goat anti-TIMP1 antibodies (1:100, Santa Cruz, USA, both) were
used. Images of staining were captured under a Nikon inverted
microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with identical light intensity and
exposure time for all groups. Positive brown staining could be
observed in the cytosol. Five random high-power ﬁelds (400×) per
slide from around the ischemic boundary were chosen and 100 cells
were counted per ﬁeld by investigators blinded to the grouping.
The average numbers of cells stained positive in the 5 ﬁelds were
considered representative for each slide.

2.1.7. Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. The differences between 2 groups were evaluated using Student’s t-test and
analysis of variance was used for more than 2 groups. Analysis was
performed using SPSS 11.0 (SPAA, IL, USA) software. P < 0.05 was
considered signiﬁcant.

4.1. Time courses of MMP9 and TIMP1 expressions after
ischemia–reperfusion

3.1. Functional outcome and infarct volume
We ﬁrst examined the neuroprotective effect of atorvastatin
on ischemia–reperfusion injury (Table 1). After 2 h MCAO plus
perfusion, the mean 5-point score and lesion volume of the I/Ratorvastatin group were signiﬁcantly lower than those of the I/R
group (P < 0.05, all). The difference was observed at all reperfusion
time points (3, 12, 24, 48, or 96 h).

3.2. Effect of atorvastatin on MMP9 and TIMP1 expression
To examine the effect of cerebral I/R on MMP9 expression, RTPCR was performed. There was no signiﬁcant higher Mmp9 mRNA
3 h after I/R, but levels were signiﬁcantly higher compared with the
sham-operated group beginning at 12 h, and reached a maximum
at 48 h (P < 0.05); (Fig. 1A).
The results of immunohistochemistry support the RT-PCR data.
The numbers of MMP9-positive immunoreactive cells were significantly higher after I/R (Fig. 2A–E, and K) and reached maximum at
48 h compared with the sham-operated group.
To examine whether I/R has an effect on levels of TIMP1, MMP9’s
endogenous tissue inhibitor, similar experiments were performed.
Our results showed that levels of TIMP1 were also signiﬁcantly
(P < 0.05) higher after I/R with the peak at 24 h for mRNA expression (Fig. 1A) and 48 h for immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3A–E,K)
compared with the sham-operated group.
We then detected whether atorvastatin pretreatment affects
MMP9 and TIMP1 levels after I/R (Fig. 1B–E). In the I/R + atorvastatin
group, MMP9 mRNA levels were signiﬁcantly lower compared with
the I/R group (P < 0.05; Fig. 1B and D), and TIMP1 mRNA levels were
signiﬁcantly higher (P < 0.05; Fig. 1C and E).
Similar results were detected by immunohistochemistry. In
the I/R + atorvastatin group, there were signiﬁcantly fewer MMP9positive cells compared with the I/R group (P < 0.05; Figs. 2A–J and
3L), but signiﬁcantly more TIMP1-positive cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 3A–J,
and L).

MMP9 is a member of the MMP family comprising more than
20 enzymes identiﬁed to date. The major targets of MMP9 are
components of the extracellular matrix, including collagen, elastin,
integrin, and regulatory factors of angiogenesis [11,19]. It is mainly
immunolocalized to brain endothelium, and also can be found in
neurons, macrophages/microglia, and astrocytes. Under physiological conditions, the production and activities of MMP9 are closely
controlled by the level of transcription, by activation of the precursor zymogen with tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen
activators, and by the endogenous inhibitor TIMP1 [11,19]. An
imbalance between MMP activation and inhibition occurs in a number of pathological events [11,19].
We compared the temporal MMP9 expression patterns of the
I/R and sham-operated groups. Compared with the sham-operated
group, MMP9 levels of the I/R were similar at 3 h, signiﬁcantly
higher starting at 12 h, reached maximum at 48 h. These patterns
are in agreement with the dynamic changes in the biphasic opening
of the blood-brain barrier after stroke [16], indicating that MMP9
has an important role in blood-brain barrier damage. Many factors
can induce production of MMP9 after I/R, including the proinﬂammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)␣, interleukin (IL) 1
and IL6; the epidermal, ﬁbroblast, and vascular endothelial growth
factors (EGF, FGF, and VEGF, respectively); and oxygen free radicals
[8,18].
I/R may have inﬂuence on changes in TIMP as well. TIMP1 is the
speciﬁc inhibitor of MMP9. It binds proMMP9 or MMP9 in a 1:1 stoichiometry [4]. Our study showed that after I/R, TIMP signiﬁcantly
increased at 12 h and reached the maximum at 24 h (mRNA) or
48 h (immunochemistry). Its expression time course is compatible
with that of MMP9 expression. Our data are consistent with published studies [15,23]. Wang et al. found that in permanent MCAo
as well as temporary MCAo followed by reperfusion, TIMP1 mRNA
was signiﬁcantly induced at 12 h and reached a peak at 48 h. Signiﬁcantly increased TIMP1 levels were also reported in stroke patients’
plasma samples [23]. Our study, along with other studies [15,23],
indicates that induction of TIMP1 (endogenous or exogenous) may
limit the damage of MMP9 and have neuroprotective roles.

4.2. The neuroprotective role of atorvastatin after
ischemia–reperfusion
4. Discussion
Here we investigated the nesuroprotective role of atorvastatin
pretreatment in a rat I/R model. Our data show that compared with
the sham-operated group, after I/R, both MMP9 and TIMP1 mRNA
levels were higher as detected by RT-PCR, and more MMP9 and
TIMP1 immunoreactive cells appeared. Treatment with atorvastatin prior to I/R signiﬁcantly lowered MMP9 and increased TIMP1
mRNA levels compared to I/R group. In addition, the peri-infarct
area was smaller and neurofunctional outcome was better after
atorvastatin pretreatment.

Prior studies have suggested the neuroprotective role of atorvastatin after cerebral ischemia, but either there was no pretreatment
with atorvastatin in the study [22] or no effects were observed
in the pretreatment group [17]. The present investigation found
improved neurological function and reduced infarct sizes in the
I/R+atorvastatin rats compared with the sham-operated group. The
differences in results among studies may be due to different pretreatment periods. In our study, atorvastatin was administrated
orally for 21 days; in Saito et al.’s [17] study, atorvastatin was only
given for 7 days.

We found that in rats treated with atorvastatin before I/R,
increases in TIMP1 occurred in parallel with decreases in MMP9.
The effect of statins on MMP9/TIMP expression has been primarily studied in coronary artery diseases [6,7], and only one study
reported that simvastatin, given after the onset of stroke, may affect
the MMP9/TIMP1 ratio [12]. Our investigation provides evidence
that atorvastatin pretreatment can inﬂuence MMP9/TIMP1 expression.
