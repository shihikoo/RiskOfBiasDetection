Aim: Paeoniflorin from Chinese herb Paeoniae Radix has been shown to ameliorate middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced ischemia
in rats. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective action of PF in cultured rat cortical
neurons.
Methods: Primary cultured cortical neurons of rats were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) insult.
Cell survival was determined using MTT assay. HEK293 cells stably transfected with A1R (HEK293/A1R) were used for detailed
analysis. Phosphorylation of the signaling proteins was evaluated by Western blot or immunoprecipitation. Receptor interactions were
identified using co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining.
Results: Paeoniflorin (10 nmol/L to 1 μmol/L) increased the survival of neurons subjected to OGD/R. Furthermore, paeoniflorin
increased the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 in these neurons. These effects were blocked by PI3K inhibitor wortmannin or MEK
inhibitor U0126. Paeoniflorin also increased the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 in HEK293/A1R cells. Both A1R antagonist DPCPX
and EGFR inhibitor AG1478 not only blocked paeoniflorin-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt in HEK293/A1R cells, but also
paeoniflorin-increased survival of neurons subjected to OGD/R. In addition, paeoniflorin increased the phosphorylation of Src kinase
and activation of MMP-2 in HEK293/A1R cells. Both Src inhibitor PP2 and MMP-2/MMP-9 inhibitor BiPs not only blocked paeoniflorininduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (and Akt) in HEK293/A1R cells, but also paeoniflorin-increased survival of neurons subjected to
OGD/R.
Conclusion: Paeoniflorin promotes the survival of cultured cortical neurons by increasing Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation via A1Rmediated transactivation of EGFR.

Introduction

Paeoniflorin (PF) is the main active component isolated from
the herbal medicine Paeoniae Radix[1]. PF has many biological activities and has been shown to be anti-inflammatory[2–4],
analgesic[5], and an antioxidant[6, 7]. Furthermore, PF is a potential neuroprotective agent. An increasing number of studies
have shown that natural compounds have great potential for
preventing or treating cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injuries[8]. Our previous studies have demonstrated that PF pretreatment could decrease the infarct volumes of rats suffering
from a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)[9]. Such neu* To whom correspondence should be addressed.

roprotective effects might be mediated by adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) activation, because the A1R antagonist 8-cyclopentyl1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) could suppress the protective
effect of PF.
A 1R is a subtype of adenosine receptors that are highly
expressed in the brain[10] and is coupled to the Gi protein.
When ischemic injury occurs, extracellular adenosine increases
and activates A1R, which works as a neuromodulator to inhibit
excitotoxic neuronal injury[11] . This induces presynaptic A1Rs
to decrease the release of glutamate and relieves Ca2+ overloading at postsynaptic A1Rs[12]. A1R activation therefore prevents the damage to neurons caused by overstimulation with
excitatory transmitters and promotes their survival after ischemic injury and reperfusion[12]. Oxygen-glucose deprivation
followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R) mimics an ischemia and

reperfusion injury and is often used as a model of ischemic
injury in neurons and other cells.
The PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways are
also known as the reperfusion and ischemia salvage kinase
(RISK) pathways owing to their involvement in ameliorating ischemia and reperfusion injuries. The activation of RISK
pathways is associated with an inhibition of apoptosis[13-15].
Several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) activate both the Akt
and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Many G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) transactivate RTKs, resulting in Akt and
ERK1/2 activation, which results in cell protection and survival[16]. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a typical
RTK expressed in the membrane of many kinds of cells. EGFR
plays a major role in cell growth, proliferation, survival, differentiation, and so on. Several phosphorylation sites in the
C-terminal domain of EGFR, when activated, further stimulate
the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including
MAPK, Akt, and JNK[17]. The selective A1R agonist cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) promotes neuronal survival after an OGD/R
injury, most likely through PI3K/Akt signaling induced by
A1R-mediated transactivation of EGFR[18]. Consistent with its
role in neuronal protection, it has also been found that A1Rmediated transactivation of EGFR protects cardiac cells against
ischemia and reperfusion[19].
The molecular mechanism of the anti-ischemic effect of PF
remains unclear. We hypothesize that PF works as an agent
that preconditions the brain against ischemic injury by activating the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.
Preconditioning with PF could protect cells from subsequent
injury and death through the activation of A 1 R. In this
research, PF was applied to primary cultured cortical neurons
and HEK293 cells stably transfected with A1R (HEK293/A1R)
to explore its mechanism of neuroprotection.

Primary culture of cortical neurons
All animal procedures were performed following a protocol
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, permit number (2011-03-FLY-06). Cortical
neurons were cultured from Sprague-Dawley rats at embryonic day 18 (E18) using a modified method that has been previously described[18]. Fetal brains were removed under sterile
conditions. Isolated cerebral cortices were digested with
0.125% Trypsin, and cells were cultured on Poly-D-Lysinecoated plates in DMEM with 10% FBS. After 4 h, the neurons
were placed in growth media (Neurobasal medium with B27
supplement) and cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 humidified
air.
Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) and MTT
assay
OGD was carried out on 7–8 DIV (days in vitro) cultures.
Briefly, neurons were pretreated with PF in B27/Neurobasal
media for 2 h. The cells were washed once and maintained
in glucose-free DMEM without serum at 37 °C in a humidified, sealed chamber that had been flushed with 95% N2/5%
CO2 for 5 min. At the end of the 4-h OGD period, the cultures
were returned to growth media for another 24 h. In some
assays, wortmannin (100 nmol/L), U0126 (1 μmol/L), AG1478
(1 μmol/L), DPCPX (1 μmol/L), PP2 (5 μmol/L) or BiPs (10
μmol/L) was added for 30 min before the PF pretreatment.
The test compounds were always included in the OGD solution during the OGD/R period. MTT solution (0.5 mg/mL)
was added to each well, and cells were maintained in growth
media for an additional 4 h. After solubilization with DMSO,
the absorbance of the formazan dye was measured using a
microplate reader (NovoStar, BMG) at 595 nm. In each experiment, cultures exposed to OGD/R were compared with normoxic controls, which were maintained under standard incubation conditions.

HEK293/A1R cell culture
A derivative of the HEK293 cell line that stably expresses the
human A1R (HEK293/A1R cells) was established previously
and maintained in our laboratory[18, 21]. Cells were cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 500 μg/mL G418,
and cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 humidified air.
The plasmids of mutant A1Rs used for transient transfections were constructed previously in our laboratory[22]. After
transfection, the cells were cultured in the same conditions as
the HEK293/A1R cells.
Western blot analysis
The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer [20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and
protease inhibitor cocktail] and centrifuged at 15 000×g for 10
min at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined using
a Bradford assay. The samples were electrophoresed on an
SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The
membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk in Tris-buffered
saline and 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 h and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody diluted in Trisbuffered saline with 5% BSA and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20. After
incubation with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody for 1 h, the blots were developed by chemiluminescence and exposed to X-ray film. If necessary, the blot was
stripped and reprobed with additional antibodies.
Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay
HEK293/A 1R cells were serum-starved overnight at 37 °C
before treatment. The cell lysates were prepared by incubating the cells in lysis buffer on ice. Clarified lysates were
immunoprecipitated with an anti-A1R antibody or an antiEGFR antibody overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with Protein A/G-PLUS agarose beads. Equivalent amounts of protein
were analyzed for each condition. Normal IgG was used as a
negative control. The immune complexes were boiled in an
SDS sample buffer and loaded on SDS-PAGE gels for immunoblot analysis.
Immunofluorescence staining
HEK293/A1R cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30
min at 4 °C. The cells were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer
(5% normal goat serum, 1% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1%
sodium azide in PBS), then incubated with anti-A1R and antiEGFR antibodies diluted in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight.
The cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG
and Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at
room temperature in the dark. Images were acquired with a
confocal microscope (Olympus, Japan). To determine the colocalization level of A1R and EGFR, Pearson’s and Manders'
coefficients were calculated using FV10-ASW2.1 software
(Olympus) according to the previously reported analysis
methods[23]. Briefly, Pearson’s correlation coefficient describes
the correlation of the intensity distribution between the channels, ranging from -1.0 to 1.0, where 0 indicates no significant
Acta Pharmacologica Sinica

correlation. The overlap coefficient according to Manders’
indicates an actual overlap of the signals ranging from 0 to 1.0,
while 0.5 means that 50% of both selected channels co-localize.
cAMP assay
Following the instructions of the HTRF cAMP test kit (Cisbio, #62AM4PEB), HEK293 cells and HEK293/A1R cells were
harvested and resuspended in DMEM with rolipram (30
μmol/L). The cells were counted and pretreated with PF (100
nmol/L) or CPA (100 nmol/L) for 30 min and then forskolin
for an additional 30 min. The cells were lysed and intracellular cAMP was detected using a competitive immunoassay.
The cAMP concentration was calculated according to the fluorescence ratio (665 nm/620 nm).
Docking experiments
Homology modeling was used to determine the structure of
A1R. The structure of A2AR (PDB code: 3EML[24]) was used as a
template, and Modeler 9.10[25] was used to build the structure.
Lysozyme was removed and the missing residues in ICL2
were modeled by the loop-model module in Modeler. The
default values were used for all other settings. Ten models
were generated, and the best model was chosen by experience.
Docking experiments were performed using the Autodock
4.2 suite[26]. A docking box covering the entire extracellular
domain and the orthodox binding site was used. A genetic
algorithm was used for the conformation search, and a
Lamarckian genetic algorithm was adopted for conformation
evaluation. The 50 best energy-preferred conformations were
noted.
Statistical analysis
Data were obtained from at least three independent experiments and presented as the mean±SEM. Statistical analysis of
the results was carried out using one-way ANOVA followed
by the Dunnett test, using Graphpad Prism software (La Jolla,
CA, USA). P values <0.05 were considered significant.

Results

PF protects cortical neurons from OGD/R injury
PF (10 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L, or 1 μmol/L) was added to cortical neurons 2 h before OGD until the end of the reoxygenation
period (24 h). As expected, compared with the normoxia
group, exposure to OGD/R caused an impairment in the cortical neurons that appeared to damage their somas and neurites,
as observed under a phase contrast microscope. Compared to
the OGD/R neurons, neurons pretreated with PF were more
likely to maintain their morphology (Figure 2A). PF improved
neuronal viability as detected using an MTT assay. The neuroprotective effects of PF were significant at concentrations
above 100 nmol/L (Figure 2B).
PF activates the Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways

μmol/L) inhibited neuronal survival after OGD/R, an effect
that was partially reversed by PF (100 nmol/L) (Figure 3C).
Although pretreatment with wortmannin or U0126 slightly
modified the effect of PF, it is likely that the activation of the
PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways worked in
concert for the total neuroprotective effect stimulated by PF.
These results indicate that the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK
signaling pathways are simultaneously essential for the neuroprotective effect of PF. Next, PF (10 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L, or
1 μmol/L) was added to primary cultured neurons for a short
period of 15 min. PF (100 nmol/L) induced both Akt and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 4A and 4B). Neurons were
then treated with PF (100 nmol/L) for varying lengths of time.
Significant phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 was observed
at 15 min and lasted for 1 h (Figure 4C and 4D). These results
indicate that PF can ameliorate ischemic injury by activating
survival signaling pathways, including the PI3K and ERK1/2
pathways.

neurons exposed to OGD/R injury. Primary cultured cortical neurons were
treated with PF (10 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L, or 1 μmol/L) for 2 h and then
exposed to OGD injury for 4 h, as previously described. The morphology

(Thr202/Tyr204) phosphorylation levels were evaluated using
Western blot analysis. Neurons treated with PF (100 nmol/L)
showed increased Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels
compared to non-PF-treated OGD/R neurons (Figure 3A and
3B), suggesting that PF may protect neurons from ischemic
injury by activating Akt and ERK1/2.
To identify the role of Akt and ERK1/2 in the neuroprotective effect of PF, inhibitors of PI3K and MEK were used
to inhibit the activation of Akt and ERK1/2, respectively.
Pretreatment with wortmannin (100 nmol/L) and U0126 (1

Akt and ERK1/2 activation by PF is dependent on A1R
In has been reported that pretreatment with the A1R-selective
antagonist DPCPX can block PF’s neuroprotective effects in
the MCAO rat model of ischemic stroke[9]. Molecule dockings
were therefore conducted on PF, CPA (an A1R agonist), and
DPCPX (Supplementary Figure S1). The molecular docking
revealed that both DPCPX and CPA bind to A1R at the orthodox binding site, which is located within the transmembrane
helical bundles. PF, conversely, docks at an extracellular site.
Out of the 50 best energy-preferred conformations, 32 were
docked to an extracellular site, while 18 were docked to a site
above the orthodox site. These results suggest that PF binds to
A1R differently from selective agonists.
To further investigate the detailed molecular mechanism of
PF neuroprotection, A1R activation by PF in stably transfected
HEK293/A1R cells was examined. PF-induced phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 was apparent at 5 min (Figure 5A and
5B) and lasted for approximately 1 h (Figure 5C and 5D), as
in the cortical neurons. These results also confirmed that the
selective A1R agonist CPA could stimulate Akt and ERK1/2
phosphorylation in HEK293/A1R cells and suggest that the
signaling pathways induced by PF might also be dependent
on A1R.
To determine the role of A1R in Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to PF, several experiments were designed.
First, cAMP levels were evaluated, because A1R activates Gi
protein signaling, which in turn induces cAMP downregulation. PF could depress the increase in cAMP levels induced by
forskolin (1 μmol/L) in HEK293/A1R cells but not in control
HEK293 cells. These results indicate that PF can target and
activate A1R (Figure 6A). PF did not induce Akt and ERK1/2
phosphorylation in control HEK293 cells without A1R (Figure
6B). Furthermore, the A1R antagonist DPCPX could inhibit
the Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by PF, in agreement with results in MCAO rats[27] (Figure 6C and 6D). Next,
several A1R mutants were transiently transfected into HEK293
cells. The mutants include L65T (Leu-65 to Thr-65), I69S

Figure 3. The neuroprotective effect of PF is mediated by the activation of both PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK in cortical neurons exposed to OGD/R injury.
Cortical neurons were treated with PF (10 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L, or 1 μmol/L) for 2 h and then exposed to OGD for 4 h and reoxygenation for 30 min.
The cell lysates were analyzed for Akt and ERK1/2 phos­phorylation by Western blot. Neurons maintained at normoxia were used as a control (A and B).

(Ile-69 to Ser-69), I69T (Ile-69 to Thr-69), I69V (Ile-69 to Val-69),
and F185L (Phe-185 to Leu-185)[22]. The mutated residues were
chosen based on their possible involvement in PF binding
to A1R, particularly residues with hydrophobic amino acids.
Several mutants resulted in a reduced phosphorylation of Akt
and ERK1/2 compared to wild-type A1R (Figure 6E and 6F).
These results suggest that A1R is essential for PF-induced Akt
and ERK1/2 phosphorylation.
EGFR is involved in Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response
to PF
It has been demonstrated that the A1R agonist CPA can activate Akt and/or ERK1/2 in a manner that is dependent on
EGFR transactivation. This Akt and ERK1/2 signaling protected neurons and cardiac cells against injury from ischemia
and reperfusion in vitro[18, 19].

Acta Pharmacologica Sinica

After treatment of cortical neurons and HEK293/A1R cells
with PF for 5 min, EGFR was phosphorylated at Tyr1068, as
detected by Western blot (Figure 7A and 7B). It is notable
that PF failed to activate Akt and ERK1/2 through EGFR in
HEK293 cells but did so only in the HEK293/A1R cells (Figure
6B and 7B).
AG1478 (1 μmol/L), a selective inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, suppressed Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in
response to PF (Figure 7C and 7D). This suggests that EGFR
phosphorylation was involved in the activation of the Akt
and ERK1/2 signaling pathways as an upstream event. These
results imply that the PF-induced transactivation of EGFR was
mediated by A1R and resulted in the phosphorylation of Akt
and ERK1/2. The phosphorylation of EGFR at Tyr1068 was
always associated with MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt activation,
suggesting that PF could activate EGFR.

PF strengthened the interaction between A1R and EGFR
Since PF activation of the Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways
required A1R and EGFR activation, the interaction between
these two receptors after PF treatment was examined next.
In an experiment with OGD/R neurons, pretreatment with
DPCPX or AG1478 suppressed the neuroprotective effects
of PF (Figure 8A). In HEK293/A1R cells, a co-IP assay also
indicated that PF could strengthen the interaction between
A1R and EGFR (Figure 8B). PF (100 nmol/L) treatment of
HEK293/A1R cells for 5 min enhanced the co-localization of
A1R and EGFR on the cell surface, as observed using confocal

microscopy (Figure 8C). The increase in their co-localization
coefficients indicates that this interaction facilitates downstream signal transduction (Figure 8D and 8E).
Both Src and MMP-2 are involved in signaling pathways induced
by PF
Two patterns of GPCR transactivation of EGFR have been
reported. One mechanism is the direct activation of the EGFR
tyrosine kinase at the C terminus (in particular, at Tyr845
and Tyr1101) by Src kinase, and the other mechanism is the
cleavage of endogenous ligands of EGFR, including heparinActa Pharmacologica Sinica

binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) and transforming
growth factor (TGF)-α, by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs)[28].
In our study, Src tyrosine kinase was phosphorylated at
Tyr416 in response to PF treatment in HEK293/A1R cells. The
pretreatment of cells with PP2 (5 μmol/L), a selective inhibitor
of Src, but not PP3 (an analogue of PP2 that serves as negative
control) inhibited the phosphorylation of Src kinase (Figure
9A). Furthermore, EGFR was also phosphorylated at Tyr845
by the PF treatment (Figure 9B). The pretreatment with PP2
also lowered the phosphorylation levels of Akt and ERK1/2
(Figure 9C and 9D), which indicates that Src is involved in the
signaling pathways induced by PF. These data suggest that
Acta Pharmacologica Sinica

A1R activates Src, which then activates EGFR, resulting in the
observed downstream signaling.
To investigate the other potential mechanism of EGFR
transactivation, MMP activation was evaluated by Western
blot. BiPs, an inhibitor of MMP-2/MMP-9, inhibited the
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in response to PF in HEK293/
A 1R cells (Figure 10A). MMP-2/MMP-9 cleaves pro-HBEGF into free HB-EGF that could activate the EGFR at the cell
membrane. PF increased the generation of active MMP-2 and
BiPs inhibited this effect (Figure 10B). MMP-9 did not change
after PF treatment (data not show). These data indicate that
PF increased the amount of HB-EGF and induced EGFR

Because both Src and MMP-2 were involved in the activation of the Akt and/or ERK signaling pathways by PF, they
might also be involved in the neuroprotective effect of PF.

effect of PF via the activation of EGFR.

Discussion

While stroke is becoming a worldwide financial burden and
health challenge, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of
brain damage remain unclear. No neuroprotective agents exist
to protect against an ischemic cerebrovascular injury[29]. PF
was isolated from one herbal medicine that has been demonstrated to be neuroprotective in the MCAO rat model of ischemic stroke, although the underlying mechanism is unknown.
In our studies, PF preconditioning exerted a neuroprotective
effect against ischemia and reoxygenation via the activation of
the Akt and ERK1/2 survival signaling pathways. It has been
known that the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 inhibits
apoptosis and can rescue cells from injury following ischemia
and reperfusion[15]. In this study, the treatment of cortical
neurons with PF induced Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation
during the reoxygenation period and promoted their survival.
PI3K/Akt pathway activation is found in many studies and
plays a key role against ischemia/reperfusion injuries[30, 31].
Activation of the ERK cascade has also been shown to promote the restoration of learning and memory after cerebral
Acta Pharmacologica Sinica

ischemia[8].
The activation of Akt and ERK1/2 by PF was mediated by
the transactivation of EGFR through A1R. Akt and ERK activation is likely downstream of the EGFR activation stimulated
by PF; thus, they play a common role in the neuroprotective
effect exerted by PF against OGD/R injury. PF could not
induce Akt or ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the absence of A1R,
which demonstrates that PF activates these two pathways via
transactivation. This might explain why inhibiting A1R or
EGFR reduced neuronal survival compared with PF treatment
alone.
Although PF is not a typical A1R agonist, several studies
have shown that PF targets the A1R[9, 27, 32, 33]. In our study, PF
was found to activate A1R and reduce cAMP levels. Some A1R
mutants are thought to be related to the ligand-receptor binding[22] that would affect the signaling induced by PF especially
L65T and I69S in which hydrophobic residues are replaced
by hydrophilic ones located in the second transmembrane
region of A1R. It will be interesting to explore the relationship
between the structure and function of PF binding to A1R.
To further understand the binding behavior of PF, the
molecular docking of PF was compared to that of CPA and

Figure 8. A1R and EGFR are essential for the effects of PF. Cortical neurons were pretreated with DPCPX (1 μmol/L) or AG1478 (1 μmol/L) for 30
min and then treated with PF for 2 h. Afterwards, the neurons were exposed to OGD/R and survival was evaluated using the MTT assay (A). Data are
presented as the mean±SEM. cP<0.01 vs OGD/R. fP<0.01 vs OGD/R+PF, n=8. HEK293/A1R cells were treated with PF (100 nmol/L) and EGF (5 ng/
mL) for 5 min. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-A1R antibody and immunoblotted with antibodies against A1R and EGFR (B).
HEK293/A1R cells were treated with PF (10 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L, or 1 µmol/L) for 5 min. Confocal microscopy showed that A1R and EGFR co-localized
at the cell membrane, as revealed by immunofluorescence staining. The scale bar represents 50 μm (C). The extent of co-localization was evaluated by
correlation coefficients (D and E). Data are presented as the mean±SEM. bP<0.05, cP<0.01 vs control. n=30.

DPCPX (Supplementary Figure S1). GPCRs have been known
to have allosteric binding sites within the extracellular loops,
and the docking results suggested that PF would bind to either
an allosteric site in an extracellular loop or a site in the extracellular region. These binding site differences may explain the
difference in the biological activities of PF and DPCPX.
It has been shown that A1R transactivation of EGFR exerts
protective effects against ischemia and reperfusion[18, 19]. PF
acted at the surface of HEK293/A 1R cells to promote an

interaction between A1R and EGFR, which increased signal
transduction from the two receptors. The phosphorylation of
EGFR at Tyr1068 and Tyr845 induced by PF is thought to be
involved in MAPK and Src activation, respectively. Both Src
tyrosine kinase and MMP-2 were involved in the transactivation of EGFR after PF treatment. Src seems to play a greater
role than MMP-2 in HEK293/A1R cells, because inhibition of
MMP-2 with BiPs only inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation
and not Akt phosphorylation. However, the inhibition of Src

Figure 9. Src is involved in the activation of both Akt and ERK1/2 by PF. HEK293/A1R cells were pretreated with PP2 (5 μmol/L) or PP3 (5 μmol/L) for
30 min and then treated with PF for 5 min. The cell lysates were analyzed for phosphorylation of Src at Tyr416 (A). HEK293/A1R cells were treated with
PF and EGF for 5 min. Phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr845 was detected using immunoprecipitation with an anti-EGFR antibody (B). HEK293/A1R cells
were pretreated with PP2 for 30 min and then treated with PF for 5 min. The phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 was detected by Western blot (C and D).

or MMP in neurons abolished the neuroprotective effects significantly, indicating that differences in the mechanisms of PF
could exist in different cell types.
The literature of cerebral ischemia indicates that MMPs play
multiple roles[34]. MMP-9 exhibits high levels of activity during ischemia, especially in the acute phase, while MMP-2 has
been found to be elevated in the delayed phase and showed
contrary performance which remains to disclosure[35]. Here,
we found that PF could activate MMP-2 and subsequently
EGFR in HEK293/A1R cells, an effect that might occur via
sheared HB-EGF release. However, it is only inferred that an
increase in MMP-2 could contribute to the neuroprotective
effect of PF, as neurons are different from HEK293/A1R cells.
The phenomenon of GPCR transactivation of RTKs is universal and may represent a novel target for drug development[36]. Several studies have found that GPCRs transactivate
Acta Pharmacologica Sinica

RTKs that exert neurotrophic effects, such as the insulin
growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor, EGFR, and TrkA/B[37-39]. PF
has been studied for decades and has many effects in vivo
and in vitro, several of which are independent of A1R [3, 20].
We explored the mechanism of action of PF in HEK293/A1R
cells and cortical neurons because both A1R and EGFR are
expressed in these two cell types. PF functioned as a neurotrophic factor to protect cortical neurons from OGD/R injury.
These results explain the anti-ischemic effect of PF in MCAO
rats, because the cortex suffers from ischemia and reperfusion in that model. In addition to the other effects of PF, the
neurotrophic-like effects of PF could rescue neurons during
ischemic stroke and other cerebrovascular diseases.
In conclusion, PF preconditioned neurons to enhance their
survival after ischemic injury. This effect was dependent on
Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which was induced by
