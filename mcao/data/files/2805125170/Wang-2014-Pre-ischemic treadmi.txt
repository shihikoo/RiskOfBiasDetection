edema and neurological deﬁcits, also decreased the over
expression of PKC-a and increased the expression level of
GLT-1, Akt and PI3K after ischemic stroke (p < 0.05). The
over-expression of mGluR5 and NR2B mRNA was also
inhibited by pre-ischemic exercise (p < 0.05). In summary,
exercise preconditioning ameliorated brain damage after
ischemic stroke, which might be involved in two signal
pathways: PKC-a–GLT-1–Glutamate and PI3K/Akt–GLT-1–
Glutamate. Ó 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract—Physical exercise could play a neuroprotective
role in both human and animals. However, the involved
signal pathways underlying the neuroprotective eﬀect are
still not well established. This study was to investigate the
possible signal pathways involved in the neuroprotection
of pre-ischemic treadmill training after ischemic stroke.
Seventy-two SD rats were randomly assigned into three
groups (n = 24/group): sham surgery group, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group and MCAO with exercise group. Following three weeks of treadmill training
exercise, ischemic stroke was induced by occluding the
middle cerebral artery (MCA) in rat for 2 h, followed by reperfusion. Twenty-four hours after MCAO/reperfusion, 12 rats
in each group were evaluated for neurological deﬁcit scores
and then sacriﬁced to measure the infarct volume (n = 6)
and cerebral edema (n = 6). Six rats in each group were
sacriﬁced to measure the expression level of glutamate
transporter-1 (GLT-1), protein kinase C-a (PKC-a), Akt, and
phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) (n = 6). Two hundred
and eighty minutes (4.67 h) after occlusion, six rats in each
group were decapitated to detect the mRNA expression level
of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) and
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit type 2B (NR2B)
(n = 6).The results demonstrated that pre-ischemic treadmill training exercise reduced brain infarct volume, cerebral

INTRODUCTION
Ischemic stroke is a main cause of death and disability
both in developing and developed countries. Due to the
limitation of speciﬁc and eﬀective treatments, preconditioning methods attracted more and more attention
to improve the prognosis of stroke (Goldstein et al.,
2011). According to the previous studies, laboratory data
from animals demonstrated that physical exercise could
alleviate brain damage after ischemic stroke by promoting
enhanced survival, decreasing neurological deﬁcits, ameliorating blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and
increasing neurovascular integrity (Stummer et al.,
1995; Ang et al., 2003; Endres et al., 2003; Li et al.,
2004; Ding et al., 2006). However, the involved signal
pathways underlying the neuroprotection was still not very
clear, which was worthy of investigating.
It is well established that the excessive release of
glutamate played a key role in the process of brain
damage after ischemic stroke, which was closely
associated with most of the ischemic stroke-related
brain injuries (Kostandy, 2012). There were ﬁve diﬀerent
Na+-dependent high aﬃnity glutamate transporters
(excitatory amino acids transporter, EAAT) to regulate
extracelluar glutamate (Shigeri et al., 2004), including
EAAT1 (GLAST), EAAT2 (GLT-1), EAAT3 (EAAC1) and
EAAT4 and EAAT5. Glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1)
played the most important role in removing glutamate in
the neuroaxis (Danbolt, 2001).
It was reported that Na(+)-dependent glutamate
transporters, including GLT-1, were required for
eliminating extracellular glutamate in both physiological

and pathological conditions (Danbolt, 2001). Activation of
protein kinase C (PKC) decreased cell surface expression
of the GLT-1 (Kalandadze et al., 2002), which might inhibit the clearance of extracellular glutamate. PKC-a might
interact with and regulate GLT-1 (Gonzalez et al., 2005),
which might inﬂuence the concentration of extracellular
glutamate. Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase
(PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt) pathway was also involved in the protection mechanism
(Zhang et al., 2013a). However, whether PI3K/Akt pathway and PKC pathway were involved in the mechanism
of neuroprotection which was induced by pre-ischemic
exercise was still unknown.
In addition, our previous study showed that preischemic exercise treadmill training could decrease the
over-release of glutamate, which might be related to the
changes of event-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) (Zhang
et al., 2010b). In this study, we found that there were
two glutamate peaks at 80 min (1.33 h) and 280 min
(4.67 h) following middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO), indicating the excitotoxicity of glutamate was
very serious at the two time-points (Zhang et al.,
2010b). It was logically speculated that pre-ischemic exercise might reduce the expression levels of glutamate
receptors at the two time-points so as to ameliorate the
excitotoxicity of glutamate. Our further research demonstrated that exercise preconditioning could inhibit the
expression of glutamate receptors, metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) and N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor subunit type 2B (NR2B), alleviating the neurotoxicity of glutamate over-release at 80 min (1.33 h) following
MCAO (Zhang et al., 2010a). However, whether the
mRNA expression of glutamate receptors (mGluR5 and
NR2B) could be inﬂuenced by pre-ischemic exercise at
280 min (4.67 h) following MCAO was still unknown.
The GLT-1 played a key role in glutamate regulation. It
has been shown that ischemic/hypoxic pre-conditioning
induces brain ischemic tolerance by increasing the GLT1 expression level (Liu et al., 2011; Gong et al., 2012).
Thus, the decrease of excess glutamate concentration
following ischemic stroke might be closely associated with
the change of GLT-1 level induced by pre-ischemic treadmill training.
Thus, this study was designed to explore whether
exercise preconditioning could regulate the glutamate
transporter and glutamate receptors, which might
involve in two signal pathways, including PKC-a–GLT1–Glutamate and PI3K/Akt–GLT-1–Glutamate.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Seventy-two male Sprague–Dawley rats (body weight
from 200 to 220 g) were supplied by Hebei Province
Laboratory Animal Center. The rats were fed in a
standard laboratory animal room with a 12-h light/dark
cycle. Both food and water were ad libitum. All the
procedures in this study were approved by the
Animal Care and Use Committee of Hebei Medical
University.

Treadmill training
The seventy-two rats were randomly divided into three
groups (n = 24/group): sham surgery group, MCAO
group and MCAO with exercise group. Twenty-four
hours after MCAO/reperfusion, 12 rats in each group
were evaluated for neurological deﬁcit scores and then
sacriﬁced to measure the infarct volume (n = 6) and
cerebral edema (n = 6). Six rats in each group were
sacriﬁced to measure the expression level of GLT-1,
PKC-a, Akt, and PI3K (n = 6). Two hundred and eighty
minutes (4.67 h) after occlusion, six rats in each group
were decapitated to detect the mRNA expression level
of mGluR5 and NR2B (n = 6).
For the adaptive training, the rats in the MCAO with
exercise group started to do exercise for 3 days by the
speed of 6–7 m/min for 25 min everyday with a treadmill
training machine (DSPT-202 Type 5-Lane Treadmill;
Litai Biotechnology Co., Ltd, China). Following the 3-day
exercise training, the rats began to do formal exercise
training at a speed of 20 m/min, 30 min per day and
6 days per week for 3 weeks. The rats in both sham
surgery group and MCAO group were free to run in their
own cages. The training procedures were also
described in our previous study (Zhang et al., 2010a).
MCAO model
Following the exercise training, the 72 rats received
MCAO surgery or sham surgery. Rats were
anesthetized intraperitoneally by 4% chloral hydrate
(10 ml/kg) and further doses were required if the rat
could not maintain quiet state during the process of
operation. The rat’s body temperature was kept at
37 °C by a heating pad. The surgery procedures were
mainly consistent with Longa EZ (Longa et al., 1989)
method.
In brief, at ﬁrst, the left common carotid artery (CCA),
external carotid artery (ECA) and internal carotid artery
(ICA) were separated gently. A suture (4–0 nylon) with
a rounded tip coated by poly-L-lysine (Beijing Sunbio
Biotech Co. Ltd, Beijing, China) was accurately inserted
into the prepared incision of ECA. Then, the suture was
inserted into ICA via CCA, ﬁnally arrived at the starting
end of middle cerebral artery (MCA) to occlude the
blood ﬂow. Following occlusion for 120 min, reperfusion
was achieved by removing the ﬁlament.
In the sham surgery group, the rats endured the
same procedures but without occlusion of MCA. The
physiological parameters in the process of operation
were monitored by a Blood Gas and Electrolyte
System (Radiometer ABL505, Copenhagen, Denmark),
including paO2 (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial
blood), pH (hydrogen ion concentration) and paCO2
(partial pressure of carbon dioxide). Rats’ neurological
deﬁcits were assessed at 24 h after reperfusion
according to a widely used scale as follows: 0, without
neurological symptoms; 1, unable to completely extend
the front jaw on the contralateral side; 2, rotating while
crawling and falling to the contralateral side; 3, unable
to walk without assistance; and 4, unconsciousness
(Longa et al., 1989).

Determination of brain infarct volume
At twenty-four hours following reperfusion, rats were
decapitated with chloral hydrate (10%) anesthesia. The
obtained brain tissues were frozen at a temperature of
20 °C for ten minutes, and divided evenly into six
coronal slices (nearly 2-mm thick) from the anterior pole
to the optic chiasm along the brain mid line. Then all the
brain slices were immediately immersed into a 2% TTC
(2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride)
solution
at
temperature of 37 °C for 30 min, then ﬁxed in 4%
paraformaldehyde buﬀer. After 24 h, the infarct volume
was determined on the basis of the pictures achieved by
a digital camera (DC240; Kodak, USA) and imaging
software (Adobe Photoshop 7.0). The total brain
infarction volume was equal to the sum of the infarct
size in each of six sections. In order to minimize the
error due to brain edema, the corrected formula to
calculate infarct volume was as follows (Ding et al., 2006):
Infarct volume ¼ contralateral hemisphere region  non-infarcted
region in the ipsilateral hemisphere
Infarct percentage ¼ Infarct volume=volume of the contralateral
hemisphere  100%

Water content measurement
Cerebral edema was measured by detecting both the wet
weight (WW) and dry weight (DW) in order to obtain the
water content. Brain tissue samples from three groups
were immediately weighted to calculate the WW. Then,
the brain tissues were dried in a drying oven at 70 °C
for 72 h and measured again to get the DW. The
detailed procedures were described in our previous
study (Zhang et al., 2011). A percentage of WW was used
to calculate the water content by the formula (WW  DW)/
WW  100%.
Western blot
The cortex brain tissues surrounding the ischemic region
were taken. The brain tissue protein was extracted
by the commercialization protein extraction reagent
(Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA), and the
concentration of protein extraction was measured by the
bicinchoninic acid assay. The equal amounts of protein
extract (40 lg) and buﬀer solution were mixed well and
maintained at 95 °C circumstance for 5 min, and the
mixture was loading onto 10% polyacrylamide gels. The
proteins on gels were transferred onto Hybond nylon
membrane (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA) in 350 V
for 1.5 h surrounded by the cold pack, kept in 5% BSA
blocking solution for 60 min at 25 °C, and incubated for
12 h at 40 °C in anti-Akt (1:1000 dilution; Upstate,
Millipore-Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) or anti-phospoAkt antibody (1:1000 dilution; Upstate, Millipore-Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany) or anti-GLT-1 antibody (1:1000
dilution; Upstate, Millipore-Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)
or anti-PI3K antibody (1:1000 dilution; Upstate, MilliporeMerck, Darmstadt, Germany) or anti-PKC-a antibody
(1:1000 dilution; Upstate, Millipore-Merck, Darmstadt,

Germany). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit
secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution; Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was used to
detect the immunoreactivity for 1 h at room temperature
with blocking buﬀer. Ultimately, the membrane was
immersed by 300 lL enhanced ECL solution (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) for 5 min and
exposed to Kodak ﬁlm for 5–30 s. b-Actin was employed
as a loading control in this study.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Six rats in each group were decapitated at 280 min
(4.67 h) min after occlusion of MCA. The striatum of
ischemic hemisphere was taken and immediately frozen
in liquid nitrogen for further process.
Stored striatum tissue was mixed with Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), which were
homogenized for extraction of total RNA according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Subsequently, the cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA) was used for reverse transcription. Each
tube accommodated a 20 lL reaction volume, including
0.8 lL of 25 dNTP (100 mM), 2 lL 10 RT buﬀer,
2 lL 10 RT Random Primers, 0.6 lg of total RNA
(10 lL)
and
50 units
of
MultiScribe
Reverse
Transcriptase. Tubes were placed for 10 min at 25 °C,
2 h at 37 °C and 5 s at 85 °C. The tubes were placed at
20 °C until PCR ampliﬁcation.
Gene-speciﬁc primers (as demonstrated in Table 1)
and SYBRÒ Green (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA) were prepared for real-time PCR quantiﬁcation of
both NR2B and mGluR5 by an ABI PRISM 7000 realtime thermal cycler. Primer Express software (Applied
Biosystems) was used for designing oligonucleotide
primers. Beta actin (b-actin) was used as the
standardized control.
The reaction sequences were set up as follows: 1
cycle at 50 °C (2 min), 1 cycle at 95 °C (10 min) and 40
cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Cycle
threshold values were determined according to the
linear range from log scaling and the baseline. The
20 lL reaction system included cDNA (2 lL), of each
primer (300 nM) and SYBRÒ Green PCR Master Mix
(10 lL), which contained AmpliTaq Gold DNA
polymerase. Sequence Detector software (SDS version
1.6, Applied Biosystems) was used to detect SYBR
Green reporter dye ﬂuorescence. The relative change of
mRNA expression for NR2B and mGluR5 after MCAO
was reckoned by the following formula (Livak and
Schmittgen, 2001):
Fold change = 2DCt; DCt = (Cttarget  Ctb-actin).
Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed by SPSS for Windows, version
11.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). The relative mRNA
expressions, the protein expression level of GLT-1,
PKC-a, PI3K, Akt, and cerebral edema among the three
groups were analyzed by a one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA), and a post hoc Tamhane multiple
comparison test was used for multiple comparisons. The

DISCUSSION
Ischemic stroke was a main reason of death and
disabilities in Western countries (2011). Therefore, the
strategies to ameliorate brain damage following

ischemic stroke attracted more and more attention. A
series of intervention methods were used for this
purpose, including physical exercise training (Krarup
et al., 2008). In order to encourage more people with high
risk factors of stroke to start to accept regular exercise
program, the detailed mechanism underlying physical
exercise should be elucidated.
Among the pathological mechanisms following
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion, the excitotoxicity caused
by excessive glutamate was a major damaging factor
(Guyot et al., 2001). The EAATs exerted a crucial role
in the over-release extracellular glutamate uptake process (Suchak et al., 2003; Beart and O’Shea, 2007). An
EAAT inhibitor could markedly decrease glutamate
uptake ability, up-regulating as much as 65% glutamate
concentration following diﬀuse brain injury (Hinzman
et al., 2012). GLT-1 (EAAT-2) which was mainly located
in astrocytes in diﬀerent brain areas, including the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Kanai and Hediger,
2004), was in charge of 90% of glutamate re-uptake
primarily in the prosencephalon of rats (Verma et al.,
2010). GLT-1 knockout mice demonstrated selective neuronal deterioration in the region of hippocampal CA1,
implying the vital role of GLT-1 in neuroprotective mechanism (Tanaka et al., 1997). The result in the present study
indicated that exercise preconditioning increased the
expression level of GLT-1, thus ameliorating the exciototoxicity caused by over-release of glutamate.

Fig. 4. Diﬀerence in PI3K protein expression among the three groups. The PI3K protein expression of MCAO group is higher than sham surgery
group (⁄⁄p < 0.05). MCAO with exercise group showed a promotion in PI3K protein expression compared with MCAO group (#p < 0.05). The PI3K
protein expression of MCAO with exercise group is higher than sham surgery group (⁄p < 0.05). Data represent the mean ± SEM.

The glutamatergic system played an important role in
normal state of brain function and controls the activity of
glutamate, which was the most key neurotransmitter in
the CNS, and metabotropic G protein-coupled receptors,
ionotropic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), a-amino-3hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and
kainic acid (KA) receptors(Ozawa et al., 1998). It was
suggested that regulating these glutamate receptor subtypes might be a novel therapeutic approach to reduce
stroke damage (Spooren et al., 2003).
Based on previous studies, both mGluR1 and mGluR5
were very important for the regulation of pyramidal cell
excitability (Mannaioni et al., 2001; Ireland and
Abraham, 2002). Antagonists of mGluRs seemed to be
neuroprotective, and agonists of mGluRs could aggravate
neuron death in vitro study (Copani et al., 1995; Nicoletti
et al., 1999; Allen et al., 2000). Furthermore, the selective

mGluR5 antagonist MPEP obviously decreased neuronal
damage and promoted neurological recovery in ischemic
stroke animal model (Bao et al., 2001). In addition, MPEP
and its structurally associated selective mGluR5 antagonist SIB-1893 markedly alleviated post-traumatic cell
injury in vitro and promoted functional recovery in vivo
(Movsesyan et al., 2001). Another study indicated that
the neuroprotective eﬀect of mGluR5 antagonists was
stronger relative to mGluR1 antagonists (Szydlowska
et al., 2007). Thus, depressing hyperactivation of mGluR5
following ischemic stroke seemed to be neuroprotective.
Previous studies indicated that the NMDA receptordependent cellular signaling pathways involved in the
induction of brain ischemic tolerance and new protein
synthesis was also required in vivo (Barone et al., 1998;
Miao et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006). In vitro, NMDA-type
glutamate receptors were proved to be related to both

neuronal ischemic damage and ischemic tolerance
(Grabb and Choi, 1999). In addition, depressing NR2B
could alleviate ischemic cell death and promote preconditioning-induced neuroprotection (Chen et al., 2008).
Six months of voluntary exercise training on a running
wheel could inﬂuence the expression of NR2B in
7 months old 3xTg-AD (Alzheimer’s disease) mice
(Revilla et al., 2014). The low intensity treadmill exercise
obviously reduced hippocampal expression of p-NR2B
but without changing the expression of total NR2B, alleviating brain damage following ischemic stroke (Zhang
et al., 2012). Physical exercise could alleviate aberrant
phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit in hippocampal,
improving water maze performance (Muller et al., 2011).
Based on above mentioned results, it was speculated that
NR2B played a vital role in the neuroprotective eﬀect of
physical exercise.

According to our previous study, there were two
glutamate peaks at 80 min (1.33 h) and 280 min (4.67 h)
after MCAO, implying that the excitotoxicity of glutamate
over release was very serious at the two time-points
(Zhang et al., 2010b). Then, our subsequent study demonstrated that exercise preconditioning could reduce the
expression of glutamate receptors (mGluR5 and NR2B),
decreasing the neurotoxicity of glutamate over-release
at 80 min (1.33 h) following MCAO (Zhang et al.,
2010a). Furthermore, the result in the present study
shows that the mRNA expression level of glutamate
receptors (mGluR5 and NR2B) is reduced by preischemic exercise at 280 min (4.67 h) following MCAO.
In the present study, exercise pre-training reduced brain
injury following ischemic stroke. It is logically speculated
that exercise preconditioning exerts neuroprotection via
depressing the expression level of NR2B and mGluR5

mRNA, which alleviated the excitotoxicity of glutamate
over-release.
Our previous study demonstrated that exercise
preconditioning could inhibit the over-expression of
ERK1/2 in cortex brain tissues surrounding the ischemic
region so as to induce the brain ischemic tolerance
(Zhang et al., 2010b). In this study, we further to explore
whether exercise preconditioning could regulate the
glutamate transporter and glutamate receptors, which
might involve in two signal pathways, including PKC-a–
GLT-1–Glutamate and PI3K/Akt–GLT-1–Glutamate.
Therefore, the cortex brain tissues surrounding the ischemic region were examined in this study. Moreover, in our
previous study, there were two peaks of extracellular
glutamate concentration (Zhang et al., 2010b). It was
speculated that the excitotoxicity was most serious in
the two time points of peaks. The striatum was vulnerable
for ischemic damage. Then, our subsequent study demonstrated that exercise preconditioning might induce brain
ischemic tolerance by reducing the mRNA levels of
mGluR5 and NR2B in the striatum of rats at 80 min after
MCAO (Zhang et al., 2010a). Therefore, in this study we
further to investigate the eﬀect of exercise preconditioning
on the mRNA levels of mGluR5 and NR2B in the striatum
of rats at 280 min after MCAO. In summary, in order to

further to investigate the mechanism of exercise preconditioning in the basis of our previous results, we continue
to perform WB in the cortex and qPCR in the striatum.
Furthermore, it is logical to speculate that exercise
preconditioning might down regulate the expression
level of glutamate receptors which could exert harmful
eﬀects after combining with excessive glutamate
following ischemic stroke. This might explain why sham
rats showed a higher mGluR5 and NR2B expression
than MCAO with exercise rats in our study.
As for the PI3K/Akt pathway in the neuroprotection of
exercise, a recent study indicated that forced running
exercise ameliorated neurocognitive deﬁcits and
hippocampal neurogenesis impairment, involving in
regulation of Akt following radiotherapy injury (Ji et al.,
2014). Quercetin promotes exercise-regulated functional
recovery following brain ischemia via increasing PI3K/
Akt activity to activate antioxidative and anti-apoptotic signaling (Chang et al., 2014).
Treadmill exercise ameliorated aggressive tendency
and increased correct decision in the spatial learning
memory in the autistic rats, which was related to the
changes of phosphorylated Akt (Seo et al., 2013). A
recent study reported that Ginsenoside Rd promoted the
levels of phosphorylated protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) in

X. Wang et al. / Neuroscience 274 (2014) 393–402

astrocyte culture following oxygen-glucose deprivation
and increased mRNA and protein expression levels of
GLT-1 in rats after ischemic stroke (Zhang et al.,
2013b). Furthermore, the eﬀect of Rd on GLT-1 expression could be eliminated by PI3K/AKT inhibitor
LY294002, indicating that Rd could advance glutamate
clearance by increasing GLT-1 expression through
PI3K/Akt pathway (Zhang et al., 2013b). In our study,
the result proved that pre-ischemic exercise could promote GLT-1 expression, which might be partially through
PI3K/Akt pathway.
Furthermore, in both primary co-cultures of neurons
and astrocytes and C6 glioma cells transfected with
GLT-1, activation of PKC resulted in a reduction in
GLT-1 cell surface expression, which might represent a
mechanism to regulate extracellular glutamate through
PKC–GLT-1 pathway (Ganel and Crosson, 1998). PKC
is signiﬁcantly increased after voluntary exercise compared with those in rats without exercise (Mizutani et al.,
2014). In our study, exercise preconditioning exerted neuroprotective eﬀect following ischemic stroke, which might
be due to the down-regulation of PKC-a and up-regulation
of GLT-1.

CONCLUSION
In summary, the results in this study indicated that
pre-ischemic exercise could exert neuroprotection
against ischemic injury by promoting GLT-1 to promote
the uptake of glutamate and inhibiting the mRNA
expression level of NR2B and mGluR5 to reduce the
excitotoxicity of glutamate, which might involve in the
two signal pathways: PKC-a–GLT-1–Glutamate and
PI3K/Akt–GLT-1–Glutamate.
