Hypothermia treatment is a promising therapeutic strategy for brain injury. We previously demonstrated that 5Û∏Ä† -adenosine
monophosphate (5Û∏Ä† -AMP), a ribonucleic acid nucleotide, produces reversible deep hypothermia in rats when the ambient
temperature is appropriately controlled. Thus, we hypothesized that 5Û∏Ä† -AMP-induced hypothermia (AIH) may attenuate brain
ischemia/reperfusion injury. Transient cerebral ischemia was induced by using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model
in rats. Rats that underwent AIH treatment exhibited a significant reduction in neutrophil elastase infiltration into neuronal cells
and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R), tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR), and Toll-like
receptor (TLR) protein expression in the infarcted area compared to euthermic controls. AIH treatment also decreased the number
of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling- (TUNEL-) positive neuronal cells. The overall infarct volume
was significantly smaller in AIH-treated rats, and neurological function was improved. By contrast, rats with ischemic brain injury
that were administered 5Û∏Ä† -AMP without inducing hypothermia had ischemia/reperfusion injuries similar to those in euthermic
controls. Thus, the neuroprotective effects of AIH were primarily related to hypothermia.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the leading cause of severe, long-term disability
worldwide [1]. A number of chemical agents have been shown
to have neuroprotective effects following ischemic brain
injury in the laboratory, only to fail in the clinic [2], indicating
a need for novel therapeutic strategies. An active and important area of cerebrovascular research is therapeutic hypothermia after stroke. Mild or deep hypothermia has yielded
beneficial results in animal models of brain ischemic injury
[3, 4]. Artificially lowering body and brain temperatures can
significantly reduce the deleterious effects of several forms
of brain injury, including traumatic brain injury [5], stroke
[6], and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy [7].

However, despite widespread recognition of the beneficial
effects of hypothermia, acceptance of this method of treatment within the medical community is limited. In the United
States, only 2% of eligible patients receive this treatment
option [8]. There are several reasons why this form of
treatment remains underutilized. One major factor limiting
the medical use of hypothermia is the technical difficulty of
cooling a patient [9]. In this study, we sought to determine
whether 5Û∏Ä† -AMP-induced hypothermia (AIH) can overcome
this obstacle and facilitate the use of therapeutic hypothermia.
5Û∏Ä† -Adenosine monophosphate (5Û∏Ä† -AMP), also known as
Û∏Ä†
5 -adenylic acid, is a nucleotide that is found in DNA. 5Û∏Ä† -AMP
is an ester of phosphoric acid and the nucleoside adenosine.

2
We previously reported [10] a novel method for using 5Û∏Ä† -AMP
to facilitate the induction of a hypometabolic state in mice
following a rapid lowering of body temperature. When we
maintained the ambient temperature (Ta) at approximately
15‚àò C, the animal‚Äôs core body temperature (Tb) could be
safely reduced to 16-17‚àò C. This hypothermic state is linked to
hypometabolism and a low affinity of erythrocytes for oxygen. Mice subjected to this treatment remained in this deep
hypothermic state for several hours if the ambient temperature was maintained at approximately 15‚àò C. During
the hypothermic period, Tb can be maintained without
encountering a severe thermoregulatory defense. When Ta is
increased to normal room temperature, Tb also increases to
normal body temperature. However, if Ta is normal during treatment with 5Û∏Ä† -AMP, 5Û∏Ä† -AMP does not induce deep
hypothermia. These characteristics of 5Û∏Ä† -AMP offer a practical way to control core body temperature. Additional
experiments demonstrated that AIH treatment also has a
cardioprotective effect after myocardial infarction in mice.
Thus, in the present study, we sought to determine
the dose of 5Û∏Ä† -AMP capable of inducing stable and deep
hypothermia in rats. We then investigated whether such deep
hypothermia induced by 5Û∏Ä† -AMP reduces brain infarct size,
inflammation, and neuronal apoptosis and improves neurological function in a brain ischemia/reperfusion model in
rats.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Animals and Experimental Groups. Adult male SpragueDawley (SD) rats weighing 270‚Äì300 g were housed under
diurnal lighting conditions (12 h light/dark). Experiments
were performed in accordance with international guidelines
for animal research. All experiments were approved by the
Ethics Committee of the Animal Care and Experimental
Committee of the School of Medicine of Shanghai Jiao Tong
University, Shanghai, China.
For the dose study, rats were randomly assigned to four
groups: (1) vehicle (Veh, ùëõ = 9); (2) low dose (AMP(0.25),
ùëõ = 9): 0.25 mg 5Û∏Ä† -AMP/g body weight was injected intraperitoneally (IP); (3) median dose (AMP(0.5), ùëõ = 9): 0.5 mg
5Û∏Ä† -AMP/g body weight was injected IP; and (4) high dose
(AMP(1.0), ùëõ = 9): 1.0 mg 5Û∏Ä† -AMP/g body weight was injected
IP. For the neuroprotection study, animals were randomly
assigned to four groups: (1) sham (sham, ùëõ = 18): rats
underwent the same surgical procedure without ischemia; (2)
focal ischemia/reperfusion + normothermia (MCAO, ùëõ =
22): Tb in rats in this control group was approximately 37‚àò C;
(3) normothermia + 5Û∏Ä† -AMP (NT, ùëõ = 22): at the end of
ischemia, 5Û∏Ä† -AMP was administered IP, but the Tb of the rats
was kept euthermic by maintaining Ta at 33-34‚àò C for 6 h;
(4) hypothermia + 1.0 mg 5Û∏Ä† -AMP/g body weight (HT(1.0),
ùëõ = 20): 1.0 mg 5Û∏Ä† -AMP/g body weight was administered at
the end of ischemia/reperfusion, and the rats were kept at Ta
of 15‚àò C; after 6 h at 15‚àò C, all AIH-treated rats were returned to
normal care; and (5) hypothermia + 0.5 mg 5Û∏Ä† -AMP/g body
weight (HT(0.5), ùëõ = 20): all procedures were similar to those
for the HT(1.0) group, except that the 5Û∏Ä† -AMP dose was
0.5 mg/g body weight.

Mediators of Inflammation
2.2. Induction of Deep Hypothermia by 5Û∏Ä† -AMP. 5Û∏Ä† -AMP was
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Anesthesia
was induced by inhalation of 5% isoflurane and maintained
with 2% isoflurane during surgery and the early stages
of reperfusion. A freshly prepared solution of 5Û∏Ä† -AMP in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was injected IP. During the
experiments, Tb was monitored using a digital thermometer
(T&W Industry Co., Ltd., China) with the probe placed
approximately 1 cm into the anus. A six-needle electrocardiogram (ECG) and consecutive measurements of femoral artery
blood pressure were recorded for all rats. The tail artery was
cannulated to measure physiological parameters (pH, pCO2 ,
and pO2 ) using a blood gas analyzer (International Technidyne Co., USA).
2.3. Transient Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Protocol. Transient cerebral ischemia was induced in rats by middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) as described previously [11]. After
anesthesia a midline neck incision was made to expose the
left common carotid artery. The external carotid artery was
ligated using a bipolar coagulator. A nylon filament (diameter
0.24‚Äì0.28 mm) was gently inserted into the left internal
carotid artery until resistance was felt. Cerebral blood flow
then dropped sharply, indicating that the ischemia model was
successfully established. Reperfusion was induced by removing the filament after 90 min of ischemia. Sham-operated
animals were subjected to the same anesthesia, incision,
and exposure of the vessels but without blood occlusion.
Before the AMP treatment, the body temperature was monitored and maintained at 37.5 ¬± 0.5‚àò C with a rectal thermistor
and a heat lamp.
2.4. CBF Measurements. A laser Doppler flow meter (PeriFlux System 5000, Perimed, Sweden) was applied to detect
CBF throughout the experiments and was connected to a
standard laser Doppler monitor (PeriFlux 5000 LDPM unit
and PF5000 main unit, Perimed, Sweden). The holder for the
Doppler probe was attached on the left side of the skull in the
ischemic penumbra region, 2 mm lateral and 2 mm posterior
to bregma. The CBF recorded prior to occlusion was regarded
as the baseline value. All CBF values were expressed as
percentages of the baseline value.
2.5. Neurological Behavioral Assessment. The rotarod treadmill (AccuScan, Inc., Columbus, OH, USA) test was used to
test motor function 1 day after the surgery and treatment.
Each animal was placed in a neutral position on a cylindrical
rod (3 cm diameter for rats), and the rod was then rotated
with the speed accelerating linearly from 0 to 24 rpm within
60 s; the time spent on the rotarod was recorded automatically. The maximum score given to an animal was set to 60.
The average score for the three trials was recorded for 9
animals in each group.
2.6. Infarct Volume Measurement. Animals were euthanized
with CO2 following neurological assessment. The brains
were frozen for 3 minutes in ‚àí20‚àò C refrigerator and divided
into six 2 mm thick coronal sections. Tissue sections were
then immediately stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium

Mediators of Inflammation
chloride (TTC) in PBS at 37‚àò C for 20 min. Stained sections
were imaged using a digital camera (Nikon E5100) and
quantified using ImageJ software (version 1.37c, NIH). The
infarct volume was computed as the sum of the measured
infarct areas of the evenly sliced (2 mm) brain sections
(Simpson‚Äôs rule).
2.7. In Situ Labeling of DNA Fragmentation Using TUNEL
Staining. Twenty-four hours after surgery, the rats were
euthanized with CO2 and perfused transcardially with cold
PBS. TUNEL staining of tissue sections was used to assess
apoptosis in the infarcted area in accordance with the manufacturer‚Äôs protocol (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim,
Germany) for 9 animals in each group. Briefly, the sections
were washed with PBS at room temperature for 30 min
and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium
citrate solution at 4‚àò C for 2 min. Approximately 50 ùúáL of
the TUNEL reaction mixture solution was incubated with
each slide at 37‚àò C for 1 h. All sections were overlaid with
ProLong mounting reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen, Oregon,
USA) and covered with coverslips. A Nikon ECLIPSE Ti fluorescence microscope and a CoolSNAP photometric camera
were used to detect and acquire the images. TUNEL-positive
cells (bright green fluorescence) were quantified using NISElements BR diagnostic software, version 3.2.
2.8. Immunofluorescence Staining. Brain sections (10 mm)
were incubated with 10% normal goat serum/0.1% Triton-X
100 in PBS (blocking solution) at room temperature for 1 h
for 9 animals in each group. Anti-neutrophil elastase (1 : 200,
Epitomics, Burlingame, CA, USA, Cat No. ab21595) and
anti-NeuN (1 : 500, Millipore, MA, USA, Cat No. MAB377)
primary antibodies were added to the slides, and the slides
were incubated overnight at 4‚àò C. After incubation, the slides
were washed and then were incubated for 1 h with a secondary
antibody: Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1 : 300,
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA, Cat No. A-24922) or Alex
Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG (1 : 500, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA, Cat No. A-11031). DAPI was used to stain the nuclei
in the tissue sections. All fluorescence results were obtained
using a Nikon ECLIPSE Ti fluorescence microscope (400√ó
magnification) coupled to a CoolSNAP photometric camera.
2.9. Western Blot Analysis. The levels of inflammation-related
proteins were detected by western blot analysis 24 h after
reperfusion for 9 animals in each group. Protein extraction
reagents were used to extract total protein. Approximately
50 ùúág of protein was separated by electrophoresis in an
11.5% sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel. Polypeptides were transferred onto an Immobilon PVDF membrane
(Millipore) by electrophoretic transfer at 300 mA for 1 h
on ice. The membranes were then blocked with 5% nonfat
milk in TBS-Tween (TBST). After blocking, the membranes
were rinsed and then incubated overnight with the following
antibodies: matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) (1 : 200, Cell
Signaling, Woburn, MA, USA, Cat No. 3852), interleukin1 receptor (IL-1R) (1 : 200, Cell Signaling, Woburn, MA,
USA, Cat No. 3865), tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)

(1 : 500, Epitomics, Burlingame, CA, USA, Cat No. 11119), Tolllike receptor (TLR) (1 : 600, Cell Signaling, Woburn, MA,
USA, Cat No. 12276), or ùõΩ-actin (1 : 1000, Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA). The membranes were then washed with
TBS and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1 : 800, Santa Cruz Inc., USA) in 1%
nonfat milk in TBST for 2 h at room temperature. The results
were visualized using the ChemiDoc XRS Imaging System
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), and the band
densities were quantified using the MultiGauge Software of
Science Lab 2006 (Fujifilm Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Six
animals were analyzed for each group for the western blot
analysis.
2.10. Statistical Analysis. All data are expressed as the mean
¬± SEM. The neurological scores were analyzed using the
Mann-Whitney nonparametric test. Statistical analysis was
performed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett‚Äôs post hoc test.
The 95% confidence level (ùëÉ < 0.05) was considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical
software (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version
15.0).

3. Results
3.1. 5Û∏Ä† -AMP Induces Deep Hypothermia and Reduces Heart
Rate in Rats. Three different doses of 5Û∏Ä† -AMP were investigated in our study; the vehicle, PBS, was used in the control
group. Both the 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg 5Û∏Ä† -AMP/g body weight
doses reduced the Tb of rats when the Ta was maintained
at approximately 15‚àò C (Table 1). Only 1.0 mg/g body weight
5Û∏Ä† -AMP induced deep hypothermia at approximately 16‚àò C in
rats. The heart rates of anesthetized rats also decreased by
approximately 50% within minutes of 5Û∏Ä† -AMP administration. During hypothermia, there were no large differences
in blood gases, glucose, hemoglobin, and mean arterial
blood pressure. These data indicate that the rats entered
a safe state of hypometabolism and hypothermia. Because
hypometabolism may be beneficial for alleviating metabolic
stress after brain ischemic injury, our study was undertaken to
examine the possible neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory
effects of 5Û∏Ä† -AMP-induced hypothermia (AIH) using an
MCAO model in rats. The two different doses (0.5 mg/g and
1.0 mg/g body weight) of 5Û∏Ä† -AMP were also compared.
3.2. AIH Reduces Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) after
Ischemia/Reperfusion in Rats. During the 90 min occlusion
of the middle cerebral artery, local CBF decreased to
approximately 51.64 ¬± 3.08% of baseline in all groups except
the sham group. After reperfusion, rapid hyperperfusion
(up to 168.67 ¬± 6.11% of baseline) lasting approximately
30 min was observed in the MCAO, NT, and HT(0.5) groups
(Figure 1). The 1.0 mg/g body weight AIH treatment reduced
CBF to 138.67 ¬± 3.29% and 123.50 ¬± 3.85% of baseline 10 min
and 20 min after reperfusion (ùëÉ < 0.05 versus the MCAO,
NT, and HT(0.5) groups, Figure 1).
3.3. AIH Reduces Brain Infarct Volume in the Ischemia/Reperfusion Rat Model. Brain infarct volumes were measured by

TTC staining. To determine the effects of AIH on brain
ischemic injury, the infarct size due to ischemic insult was
calculated using imaging software. Representative images
of infarcted areas (white) are shown in Figure 2(a). In the
MCAO group, a large infarcted area was predominantly
located in the cerebral cortex and the striatum. The normalized infarct volume in the MCAO, NT, and HT(0.5)
groups was 42.15 ¬± 1.78%, 39.39 ¬± 0.98%, and 32.22 ¬± 0.65%,
respectively. AIH treatment reduced brain infarct volume to
5.33 ¬± 1.30% (ùëÉ < 0.05 versus the MCAO, NT, and HT(0.5)
groups, Figure 2(b)).
3.4. AIH Improves Neurological Function after Ischemic Brain
Injury. The rotarod test was administered to measure the
neurological function of rats after ischemic injury. The time
on the rotarod was calculated to determine the effect of
AIH treatment. The rats in the MCAO, NT, and HT(0.5)
groups remained on the platform for approximately 22.23 ¬±
1.98 s, 23.17 ¬± 2.42 s, and 29.22 ¬± 1.11 s, respectively. AIH
treatment improved the time on the platform to 42.29 ¬±
2.01 s, indicating that AIH treatment significantly attenuated
the neurological deficits induced by ischemic brain injury

compared to the MCAO, NT, and HT(0.5) groups (ùëÉ < 0.05,
Figure 3).
3.5. AIH Inhibits Apoptosis in the Infarcted Brain. TUNEL
staining was used to explore apoptosis in the infarcted area.
Brains from rats in the MCAO, NT, and HT(0.5) groups
displayed significant numbers of TUNEL-positive nuclei
(bright green fluorescence) compared to the sham group
(Figures 4(a), 4(b), 4(c), and 4(e)). The number of TUNELpositive nuclei in the infarcted brains from the HT(1.0) group
was reduced to 10.68% of the level observed in the MCAO
group (Figure 4(d)). Quantitative analysis indicated that AIH
treatment significantly inhibited apoptosis in the infarcted
brain area compared to the MCAO, NT, and HT(0.5) groups
(ùëÉ < 0.05, Figure 4(f)).
3.6. AIH Decreases Levels of Neutrophil Elastase Infiltration
in the Infarcted Brain. Ischemia/reperfusion injury is typically associated with increased inflammation. Sometime the
level of neutrophil elastase expression in the infarct area is
an indicator of inflammation. Immunofluorescence staining
using rat neutrophil-specific antibodies was used to detect

neutrophil elastase infiltration in all groups. The results
indicated that there were few neutrophil elastases expressions
in the sham group (Figure 5(a)). In the MCAO control group
we found significant upregulation of neutrophil elastases
expression in the neuronal cells in the infarcted brain area
(Figure 5(b)). The NT group, which was administered 5Û∏Ä† AMP but maintained at a Tb in the euthermic range, exhibited
a level of neutrophil elastases similar to that observed in
the MCAO control group (Figure 5(c)). The same level of
neutrophil elastases was also observed in the HT(0.5) group
(Figure 5(e)). Only the HT(1.0) group exhibited significantly
decreased levels of neutrophil elastases expression in the neuronal cells in the infarcted brain region (Figure 5(d)). Further
quantitative analysis indicated that AIH treatment significantly inhibited neutrophil elastases expression in the neuronal cells in the infarcted brain area compared to the MCAO,
NT, and HT(0.5) groups (ùëÉ < 0.05, Figure 5(f)).
3.7. AIH Reduces MMP-9, IL-1R, TNFR, and TLR Protein
Expression in the Infarcted Brain. Western blot analysis was
performed to detect the levels of the inflammation-related
proteins MMP-9, IL-1R, TNFR, and TLR. As with neutrophil
infiltration, the MMP-9, IL-1R, TNFR, and TLR protein levels
were increased in the MCAO control group and the NT
group (Figure 6(a)). The dose of 0.5 mg 5Û∏Ä† -AMP/g body
weight also did not reduce the MMP-9, IL-1R, TNFR, and
TLR levels (Figure 6(a)). A greater reduction of MMP-9, IL1R, TNFR, and TLR expression was observed in the 1.0 mg
5Û∏Ä† -AMP/g body weight treatment group (Figure 6(a)). To
confirm this observation, ùõΩ-actin levels were used as an

In agreement with previous studies [10], this study demonstrated that a high dose of 5Û∏Ä† -AMP could reduce the Tb to
approximately 16‚àò C under appropriate Ta. Controlling Ta is
a useful way to regulate an animal‚Äôs Tb after administration
of 5Û∏Ä† -AMP. For example, rats given 5Û∏Ä† -AMP but kept at a
Ta of 33‚àò C, such as the NT group, can maintain their Tb in
the euthermic range. However, when the Ta was maintained
at 15‚àò C, the Tb of the rats dropped to approximately 16‚àò C.
This synchronous change in Tb with the administration of
5Û∏Ä† -AMP renders 5Û∏Ä† -AMP a good agent for the induction of
hypothermia. Thus, in the present study, we examined the
effects of AIH treatment on brain ischemic injury in rats.
AIH treatment reduced brain infarct volume, improved neurological function, and inhibited neuronal apoptosis. Further
experiments indicated that AIH treatment induced a significant inhibition of neutrophil infiltration into the infarcted
brain area and a significant reduction in MMP-9, IL-1R,
TNFR, and TLR protein levels in the ischemic brain. Taken
together, these data suggest that AIH treatment has a neuroprotective effect in focal brain ischemic injury and that this
effect is mediated by inhibition of an inflammatory reaction.
The concept of neuroprotection has generated much
enthusiasm over the past two decades and has triggered a
substantial amount of research focused on its use in the
treatment of ischemic stroke [12]. It has been suggested that
therapeutic hypothermia may be the most potent neuroprotective strategy [13, 14]. A potential advantage of therapeutic
hypothermia over other methods for neuroprotection is its
ability to activate numerous pathways simultaneously by
several mechanisms during the ischemia and reperfusion
windows and to reduce damage beyond the neuron, within
the entire neurovascular unit. Mild hypothermia treatment
reduces brain infarct size in several ischemic animal models
[3, 15]. However, a previous study in rats using 5Û∏Ä† -AMP
to reduce Tb to approximately 33-34‚àò C for 2.5 h did not
yield a beneficial outcome in a model of transient cerebral
ischemia [16]. By contrast, we determined that 5Û∏Ä† -AMP could
reduce the Tb to approximately 16‚àò C in rats and maintain
that temperature for approximately 6 h with low Ta. A low
Ta not only reduced Tb but also decreased the required dose
of 5Û∏Ä† -AMP. Mammals may differ in their preference for the
torpor state, depending on their metabolic rates [17, 18]. Large
mammals, such as bears, technically do not hibernate but
instead undergo torpor at a Tb of approximately 32‚àò C, while
small rodents can hibernate at a Tb of less than 10‚àò C. Thus,
we suggest that small rodents, such as mice and rats, that have
high metabolic rates must be cooled to much lower than 34‚àò C,
even to approximately 10‚àò C, to prevent ischemic injury.
Inflammation is a central component in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemic injury [19]. Brain ischemia triggers
both local and systemic inflammatory responses. Studies have

suggested that brain ischemic injury caused by cerebral blood
occlusion followed by reperfusion is neutrophil-dependent
[20]. One crucial factor underlying ischemic damage during
the reperfusion phase is neutrophil infiltration. Thus, one
strategy for attenuating ischemic brain injury is to use treatments targeting neutrophils, such as antineutrophil drugs and
anti-neutrophil antibodies.
Neutrophil elastase (NE), a kind of leukocyte-derived
proteases, degrades the basement membrane to allow neutrophil extravasation and infiltration. Therefore, in our study,
we would like to show if NE could injure or infiltrate the neuron in the infracted area after brain ischemic injury. Then we
aimed to investigate if 5Û∏Ä† -AMP-induced hypothermia could
attenuate this NE-mediated injury. As we all know, leukocytederived proteases, such as NE, degrade the basement membrane to allow leukocyte extravasation into the surrounding
tissue, jeopardizing BBB integrity in the process. In addition,
some studies [21, 22] have discussed the role of NE in injury of
neuronal cells. Once present in the parenchymal extracellular
space, NE may also degrade additional extracellular matrix
substrates (e.g., collagens, laminins) to threaten neuronal and
glial viability. In our study, we also found that NE could

invade into the antineuronal nuclei positive cells. Although
the exact mechanism is still not clear, the hypothermia could
attenuate the invasion. Our further study will use NE-null
mice or pharmacologic inhibition of NE to investigate which
signal pathway will be involved in this NE-related neuronal
injury.
However, randomized clinical trials of anti-inflammatory
agents in ischemic patients have not demonstrated a significant neuroprotective effect [23, 24]. A potential reason for
the poor outcomes of these studies is that the inflammation
cascade triggered by brain ischemia involves many different
chemokines and cytokines. Inflammation is triggered by
receptors of the innate immune system, including Tolllike receptors (TLRs) or cytokine receptors such as tumor
necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) and interleukin-1 receptor
(IL-1R). Activation of these pathways results in the induction
of inflammatory genes that are mediators or effectors of
the ischemic stimulus. Systemic hypothermia induced by
AIH treatment may represent a better approach to inhibiting
inflammation by reducing a broad array of inflammatory
responses. In our study, we observed that AIH treatment

reduced the protein levels of the initial inflammatory receptors IL-1R, TNFR, and TLR. These receptors are known
to induce proinflammatory gene expression, microglial and
endothelial activation, and leukocyte infiltration.
Activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), the
largest class of human proteases, plays an important role
during the early stage of ischemic brain injury [25]. Accumulating data suggest that MMPs are actively involved in the
inflammatory process [26, 27]. MMPs are believed to have an
impact on many of the cytokines and chemokines involved in
the inflammatory response, often with apparently opposing
outcomes. Activated MMP-9 colocalizes with infiltrating

neutrophils after brain ischemia and reperfusion. Dual
MMP/neutrophil elastase (NE) inhibitors reduce endotoxindriven airway cellular inflammation in vivo [28, 29]. Synthesized MMP inhibitors and several compounds used for secondary stroke prevention, such as anti-inflammatory drugs,
could potentially reduce MMP activity and improve the
acute treatment of brain ischemia in humans. Our studies
suggest that AIH treatment attenuates ischemia/reperfusion
injury by reducing both MMP-9 protein levels and neutrophil
infiltration.
Apoptotic cell death plays an important role in inflammatory processes and in the resolution of inflammatory

reactions [30]. Multiple in vivo studies have demonstrated
the attenuation of ischemic reperfusion injury through the
inhibition of apoptosis [31]. Hypothermia may protect against
neuronal apoptosis induced by ischemic injury by inhibiting
both extrinsic and intrinsic signaling pathways. Our studies
demonstrate that neuronal apoptosis is largely prevented by
AIH treatment.

Reduction of the brain workload is thought to be beneficial in brain ischemia. We previously suggested that the
bradycardia effect of 5Û∏Ä† -AMP is not driven by dephosphorylation of 5Û∏Ä† -AMP to form adenosine but rather by the induction
of hypothermia in mice [10]. In the present study, we observed
the same bradycardia effect in rats after administration of 5Û∏Ä† AMP. After recanalization to restore CBF, CBF can increase

to above baseline levels in cerebral ischemia. Postischemic
hyperperfusion is a sequel of ischemic damage in regions
that are likely to undergo infarction. Using a CBF monitor,
we demonstrated that 5Û∏Ä† -AMP administration reduces CBF
after ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats. AIH treatment
attenuated the state of rapid hyperperfusion observed upon
increased CBF, particularly after reperfusion.
In conclusion, our present study tested the neuroprotective effect of 5Û∏Ä† -AMP administration in a rat model of
brain ischemia/reperfusion. By controlling Ta, 5Û∏Ä† -AMP safely
induced a reversible deep hypothermia that reduced ischemic
injury following focal brain ischemia in rats. The neuroprotective effects of AIH were shown to be related to the antiinflammatory effect of AIH.
