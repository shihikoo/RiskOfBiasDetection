Background: Oxidative damage plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemic stroke and
may represent a target for treatment. Our previous studies have proved that nuclear factor E2-related
factor 2 (Nrf2) and its downstream genes served as a key mechanism for protection against oxidative
stress. Paeonol (PN) is reputed to possess a broad range of therapeutic properties probably by virtue of
its antioxidative ability. However little is elucidated regarding the underlying mechanisms in ischemic
stroke. The aim of this study was to explore PNs effect in ischemic injury and the role of the pAkt, Nrf2 and
hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the mice brains of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO).
Methods: Male CD-1 mice were subjected to pMCAO and randomly divided into ﬁve groups: Sham (shamoperated + 0.9% saline), pMCAO (pMCAO + 0.9% saline), Vehicle (pMCAO + vehicle), PN-L (pMCAO + PN
30 mg/kg) and PN-H (pMCAO + PN 60 mg/kg) groups. PN was pre-administered intragastrically once daily
for 3 days and with the last administration at 30 min before the operation in the fourth day. Neurological
deﬁcit scores, brain water content and infarct volume were measured at 24 h after pMCAO. Western blot
and qRT-PCR were employed to determine the expressions of pAkt, Nrf2, HO-1 and claudin-5. Superoxide
dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured by spectrophotometer.
Results: Compared with Vehicle group, PN signiﬁcantly alleviated neurological deﬁcit, infarct volume and
brain edema (P < 0.05), upregulated the expression of pAkt, Nrf2, HO-1and SOD (P < 0.05), decreased the
level of MDA (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the expression of claudin-5 was also enhanced.
Conclusions: PN reduced ischemic brain injury after pMCAO; this effect may be accompanied with upregulation of pAkt, Nrf2, HO-1 and ameliorating BBB permeability.

1. Introduction
The ischemic cascade starts with a drastic disruption of cerebral blood ﬂow that deprives brain cells of oxygen and glucose
supply, leading to a reduction in energy production associated
with building up toxic metabolites such as glutamate and free

radicals that could ultimately result in neurodegeneration (Kok
et al., 2010). So consolidation of the antioxidant defense system
at the early stage of ischemia provides an attractive therapeutic
strategy. The serine/threonine kinase Akt has emerged as one of
the most versatile protein kinases in neuronal survival. When cells
undergo ischemic insults, the phosphorylation of Akt may provide
a protective role (Brendan et al., 2007). After Akt activation, it could
phosphorylate lots of different targets involved in a large variety of cellular processes, including Bcl-2-associated death protein
(Bad), caspase-9, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (Zhang
et al., 2013), and facilitate the translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus
(Huang et al., 2002). Nrf2 is an essential mediator on the expression of antioxidant enzymes and prevents cell dysfunction from
free radical production (Kwak et al., 2004). It heterodimerizes with

members of the small Maf family of transcription factors and binds
to the cis-acting antioxidant response element (ARE) sequence in
the promoter regions of various phase II detoxiﬁcation genes. The
latter encode for a group of enzymes, such as quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) (Yang et al., 2009), superoxide dismutase (SOD),
hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) (Alam et al., 1995), essential in the suppression of oxidative stress. In addition, our previous studies have
proved that the increasing activity of Nrf2 could attenuate oxidative injury induced by focal brain ischemia (Chen et al., 2012; Yang
et al., 2009).
Paeonol (PN, 20-hydroxy-40-methoxyacetophenone), an active
component isolated from the radix of Paeonia suffrutico, is reputed
to possess a broad range of therapeutic properties probably by
virtue of its anti-inﬂammatory and free radical scavenging properties, including antiproliferative (Xu et al., 2007), anti-platelet
aggregation (Lin et al., 1999), anti-diabetic (Lau et al., 2007), as well
as the counteraction of neurological disorders (Zhou et al., 2011;
Zhong et al., 2009). PN has been found to strengthen antioxidant
defense system through the activation of Nrf2 related pathway in
isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction model (Li et al., 2012)
and exert neuroprotective effect through enhancing HO-1 expression on 6-hydroxydopamine-induced oxidative damage in cortical
neurons (Tseng et al., 2012). Previous studies demonstrated that
PN might be beneﬁcial for protect against cerebrovascular damage (Hsieh et al., 2006). But the mechanisms underlying are poorly
understood. In this study, we pursue to investigate the potential
protective effect of PN in the mice model of pMCAO, and investigate whether the therapeutic beneﬁt of PN is associated with the
activation of pAkt, Nrf2 and HO-1.
2. Methods and materials
2.1. Experimental animals
Animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Committee of Experimental Animal Administration of Hebei Medical University. Male
CD-1 (ICR) mice (25–30 g, n = 135) were purchased from Vital River
Laboratories (Beijing, China). All mice were allowed free access
to food and water under controlled conditions (12/12 h light/dark
with humidity of 60% ± 5%, 22 ± 3 ◦ C). The mice were randomly
divided into ﬁve groups (twenty-seven mice in each group): sham
operated group that received equal volume 0.9% NaCl (Sham);
MCAO group that received equal volume 0.9% NaCl after pMCAO
(MCAO); low dose group that received PN at 30 mg/kg after pMCAO
(PN-L); and high dose group that received PN at 60 mg/kg after
pMCAO (PN-H); Vehicle group received the corresponding vehicle
after pMCAO (Vehicle).
2.2. Mice model of permanent focal cerebral ischemia
A standard model of pMCAO was used to make permanent focal
ischemia as previously described (Yang et al., 2009). Brieﬂy, mice
were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital
sodium (50 mg/kg). In anesthetized mice, the right side of common
carotid artery was exposed and isolated. Middle cerebral artery
(MCA) was occluded by inserting a monoﬁlament nylon suture
with a heat-rounded tip into the internal carotid artery, which was
advanced further until it closed the origin of the MCA. During the
experiments, MCA blood ﬂow was monitored using a blood ﬂow
monitor (moorVMS-LDF, Moor Instruments Ltd, UK) with a ﬁber
optic probe, adhered onto the skull surface of core area supplied by
the MCA (5 mm lateral and 2 mm posterior from the bregma) before
and after clamping the right MCA. Mice that showed a decrease in

percentage of MCA blood ﬂow less than 70–80% of the initial value
were excluded. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 ◦ C
by means of a heating blanket and heating lamp throughout the
surgery. Sham-operated control mice received the same surgical
procedure without inserting a ﬁlament.
2.3. Drug administration
PN (Zelang Medical Technology Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China) with
purity of more than 99%, was ultrasonically dispersed in distilled
water to which 1%Tween 80 had been added. All drugs were prepared immediately before use and were administered in a volume
of 30 mg/kg (Low) and 60 mg/kg (High) body weight by oral gavage (Zhong et al., 2009). PN was administered intragastrically once
daily for 3 days, after 30 min of PN pretreatment on the fourth day.
In the cases of the MCAO and Sham group, equal volume 0.9% saline
was administered in the same manner.
2.4. Evaluation of neurological deﬁcit
Neurological deﬁcit was scored in each mouse at 24 h after
the ischemic insult in a blinded fashion according to the following graded scoring system: 0 = no deﬁcit; 1 = difﬁculty in fully
extending the contralateral forelimb; 2 = unable to extend the
contralateral forelimb; 3 = mild circling to the contralateral side;
4 = severe circling; 5 = falling to the contralateral side (Longa et al.,
1989).
The higher the neurological deﬁcit score, the more severe
impairment of motor motion injury. The mice were from groups
of brain water content, infarct volume, Western blot (n = 18).
2.5. Measurement of brain water content
Brain water content was measured using the standard wetdry method (Hatashita et al., 1988). Mice were anesthetized with
10% chloral hydrate and the brains were quickly removed (n = 8).
Cerebral hemispheres (ipsilateral and contralateral) were packaged with pre-weighed tin foil. The packed slices were immediately
weighed on an electronic balance to obtain wet weight and then
dried for 8 h in oven at 120 ◦ C to get the dry weight. Brain
water content was calculated as (wet weight − dry weight)/wet
weight × 100%.
2.6. Measurement of infarct volume
Infarct volume after MCAO was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) at 24 h after MCAO (n = 6 per group).
Animals were euthanized and the brains were quickly collected.
Then the brain tissue was sliced into ﬁve coronal section (2 mm
thick each) and stained with 2% solution of TTC at 37 ◦ C for 20 min,
followed by ﬁxation with 4% paraformaldehyde. The normal tissue was stained deep red, while the infarct area was stained
a pale gray color. TTC-stained sections were photographed and
the digital images were analyzed using image analysis software
(Image-Pro Plus 5.1). The lesion volume was calculated by multiplying the area by the thickness of slices. To compensate for
the effect of brain edema, the percentage hemisphere lesion volume (%HLV) was calculated by the following formula (Tatlisumak
et al., 1998): %HLV = {[total infarct volume − (the volume of intact
ipsilateral hemisphere − the volume of intact contralateral hemisphere)]/contralateral hemisphere volume} × 100%.
2.7. Western blot
Total protein was extracted respectively from rat ischemic
and control cortex using a Total Protein Extraction Kit (Applygen

Y. Zhao et al. / Brain Research Bulletin 109 (2014) 61–67

Technologies Inc., Beijing) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
The protein concentrations of extracts were determined using a
BCA Protein Assay reagent kit (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA). 50 ␮g
of protein (n = 6 in each group) were separated by SDS/PAGE, transferred 2 h on to PVDF membranes, and the nonspeciﬁc binding
of antibodies were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS.
Then they were incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies (Nrf2, 1:200, Santa; claudin-5, 1:200, Santa; pAkt, 1:500,
Cell Signaling; Akt, 1:500, Cell Signaling; HO-1, 1:500, Enzo) at
4 ◦ C overnight. Membranes loaded with primary antibodies were
washed with 0.1% tween-20 Tris-buffered saline on the second
day, and then were incubated with ﬂuorescent labeling second
antibodies (goat anti-rabbit/mouse, 1:8000, Rockland, Gilbertsville,
PA) for 1 h at room temperature. An imaging densitometer (LICORBioscience) was used to analyze the relative density of each
band. Anti-mouse ␤-actin (1:500, Zhongshan Biotechnology) was
used as internal control.
2.8. RNA isolation and quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qR-T PCR)
was used to analyze the levels of Akt, Nrf2, HO-1, claudin-5 (n = 3).
Mice were anesthetized and the brains were removed and frozen
in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from the ischemic
cortex in ipsilateral hemisphere using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Only
samples with an OD260/OD280 value >1.8 were considered appropriate for use. Reverse transcription was performed with 2 ␮g total
RNA using Revert Aid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas
International Inc, Burlington, Canada). Forward and reverse primers
were 5 -GGCGGATTACGACAAGAAGAACT-3 and 5 -TAGTGATGGTCAACGGACTCTG-3 for claudin-5, 5 -TAAGACCGCCTTCCTGCTCA3 and 5 -CTGACGAAGTGACGCCATCT-3 for HO-1, 5 -AAAATCATTAACCTCCCTGTTGAT-3 and 5 -CGGCGACTTTATTCTTACCTCTC3 for Nrf2, 5 -GGCAGGATGTGTATGAGAAGAAG-3 and 5 -GAGTAGGAGAACTGGGGGAAGT-3 for Akt. Ampliﬁcation and detection
were carried out with the ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using Ultra SYBR Mixture (with
Rox) (ConWin biotech Co, Beijing, China) under the following
conditions: 95 ◦ C for 10 min, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 ◦ C for
15 s, annealing at 57 ◦ C for 15 s and extension at 72 ◦ C for 30 s.
Results for each sample were collected at least three times. All the
threshold cycle values of target genes were normalized relative to
that of the ␤-actin, and relative expression ratios were calculated
via the 2−CT method.
2.9. Determination of SOD and MDA levels
Cortical tissues from 6 mice of each group were collected at 24 h
after MCAO. The samples were rinsed, weighed, and then homogenized in 9 volumes of 9 g/L ice-cold saline for 10 min using a Dounce
Tissue Grinder (Kimble and Kontes, Vineland, NJ, USA). Supernatant
homogenate was collected after centrifugation at 4000 rpm/min for
10 min at 4 ◦ C. SOD and MDA levels were measured using assay
kits (A001 and A003; Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute,
Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturers’ instructions (Chen
et al., 2012; Feng et al., 2012).
2.10. Statistical analysis
Group data in this study was analyzed using SPSS 13.0 software.
Quantitative data was represented as mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was performed by One-way ANOVA followed by LSD test for
intergroup comparisons. For neurological deﬁcits, Mann–Whitney

3. Result
3.1. PN attenuated the neurological dysfunction after cerebral
ischemia
Neurological deﬁcit was examined and scored on a 6-point scale
at 24 h after pMCAO and Mann–Whitney U test analysis was conducted. Both mice in pMCAO and Vehicle groups got higher scores
than in Sham group. Compared with Vehicle group, there was
signiﬁcant alleviation in motor function in PN-H group (P < 0.05)
(Fig. 2A). PN-L could also reduce neurological deﬁcit scores, but did
not reach a signiﬁcant level.
3.2. PN reduced brain edema after cerebral ischemia
Edema surrounding the infarct disrupts nearby neuronal function and results in propagating damage in acute phase of stroke.
Brain water content in ipsilateral hemisphere was 79.08% ± 0.78%
in Sham operated group, while it increased to 84.61% ± 0.61% at 24 h
after occlusion in Vehicle group. The two doses of PN decreased
the percentage of brain water content in ipsilateral hemispheres
after stroke. Compared with Vehicle group, water content markedly
reduced to 82.16% ± 1.02% in PN-L and 81.68% ± 1.23% in PN-H
(P < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). But no statistical signiﬁcance in brain water
content was observed between PN-L and PN-H groups.
3.3. PN decreased infarct volumes after cerebral ischemia
Infarct size was observed at 24 h after MCAO using vital staining
with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) (Tatlisumak et al.,
1998). The infarction area was white in color, while the noninfarction area was red (Fig. 2C). No infarction was observed in
Sham-operated group, while in MCAO and Vehicle groups, extensive lesion was developed in both striatum and lateral cortex.
Compared with Vehicle group, the infarct volume was signiﬁcantly
reduced in both PN-H (41.95% ± 3.84% vs. 33.37% ± 1.88%) and PN-L
groups (41.95% ± 3.84% vs.27.78% ± 2.03%) (P < 0.05) (Fig. 2D).
3.4. PN attenuated oxidative stress after cerebral ischemia
To investigate the changes of endogenous antioxidant system
under the inﬂuence of PN, the activity of cortical SOD was evaluated (Table 1). The activity of SOD in healthy mice brain (without
pMCAO) was 71.75 ± 0.70 U/mg. Stroke insult by MCAO caused a
signiﬁcant elevation in SOD activity, to 91.00 ± 4.75 U/mg. Under
the treatment of PN, the SOD activity was reduced in a dosedependent manner. PN-L treatment could statistically increase
the activity of SOD to 109.72 ± 8.57 U/mg, whereas PN-H treatment statistically increase to 127.02 ± 2.44 U/mg, indicating the
protective effect of PN. The level of MDA is an index of lipid
peroxidation; therefore, it is one of the biomarkers for oxidative

Fig. 1. Schematic presentation of the functional interaction between Akt and Nrf2. When cells underwent oxidative injury, the phosphorylation of Akt provided a prosurvival
signal during the cellular response. Under the basal condition, Nrf2 was sequestered in the cytoplasm by a chaperone molecule, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap l).
Upon oxidant stimulation, Nrf2 was phosphorylated and escaped from Keap-1. In this process, Akt phosphorylated Nrf2 at Ser-40 and facilitated its release from the cytoplasmic
anchor Keap1. After translocated into nuclear, phosphorylated Nrf2 worked by binding as a heterodimer with Maf or other partners to a cis-acting DNA regulatory element,
namely the antioxidant response element (ARE), which was located in the upstream region of the target genes, stimulating the transcription of an expansive set of anti-oxidant
enzymes and phase II detoxiﬁcation enzymes, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Though Akt modulates Nrf2 function, the direct mechanistic link between the two pathways
remains to be elucidated.

( P < 0.05) and PN-H group ( P < 0.05) than in Vehicle group.

stress. As shown in Table 1, MDA level increased signiﬁcantly from
2.17 ± 0.06 nmol/L to 3.17 ± 0.14 nmol/L per milligram of tissue
under the stroke insult by MCAO. Compared with Vehicle group,
pretreatment with PN signiﬁcantly decreased the production of
MDA in both dosages at 24 h after MCAO (PN-L at 2.64 ± 0.08 nmol/L
and PN-H at 2.23 ± 0.01 nmol/L) (Table 1).
3.5. PN up-regulated the expression of HO-1, Nrf2 and pAkt
Western blotting analysis was conducted to detect the protein
level of Nrf2 in nuclear and HO-1, Akt, pAkt in cytosolic extracted
from mice cortex. The protein levels of HO-1 and Nrf2 were upregulated (Fig. 3A and B), while the protein level of pAkt was
down-regulated in MCAO and Vehicle group (Fig. 3C). High dose
PN signiﬁcantly enhanced the expression of Nrf2 in nuclear at the
protein level (P < 0.05, Fig. 3E). However, there were no signiﬁcant differences between Vehicle group and PN-L group (P > 0.05,
Fig. 3E). Both PN-L and PN-H groups elevated the expressions of HO1 and pAkt compared with Vehicle group (P < 0.05, Fig. 3F and G).
But total Akt was not affected in protein levels (P > 0.05, Fig. 3D and
G).qRT-PCR analysis was further performed to evaluate the effect of
PN on the Akt, Nrf2 and HO-1 at the mRNA level in ischemic cortex.
Cerebral ischemia triggered the up-regulation of HO-1 and Nrf2
at the gene level. The mRNA expressions of HO-1 and Nrf2 were
signiﬁcantly induced by treatment with high doses of PN (P < 0.05,
Fig. 4D), but low doses of PN did not display this effect. Consistent
with the results of Western blot analysis, total Akt was not affected
in transcriptional level.
3.6. PN protected BBB structure after cerebral ischemia
The permeability of brain blood barrier (BBB) was assessed by
claudin-5 which was primarily present in tight junctions of brain
endothelia. According to our data, the expression of claudin-5 in
cerebral ischemia was signiﬁcantly up-regulated at both protein
(Fig. 4A and B) and mRNA levels (Fig. 4C) after treatment with both
doses of PN (P < 0.05).
4. Discussion
In this study a well-characterized mouse model of stroke was
used to demonstrate that the cerebral ischemic insults were associated with an increased production of free radicals, speciﬁcally
hydroxyl radical and superoxide, higher lipid peroxidation, and
lower enzymatic antioxidant defenses. Targeting these damage factors or essential cellular pathways determining neuronal survival
may foster a successful therapeutic platform for cerebral ischemia.
PN has been proved to elicit a variety of biological effects in
treatment of tumors and neurodegenerative diseases and plays a
role in scavenging activity against reactive oxygen species (ROS)
(Matsuda et al., 2001). Due to PNs small molecular weight and
amphiphilic nature, it appears able to penetrate the blood brain
barrier. With this rationale, we tested the therapeutic potentials of
PN on pMCAO-operated mice. After pMCAO, mice had severe neurological deﬁcit score throughout the entire study. But systemic
administration of PN could decrease the infarct volume, alleviate the neurological impairment, indicating the lesser histological
damage was observed as compared with the vehicle group.
In addition to the above changes, we sought to investigate the
potential molecular mechanisms underlying the chemopreventive
and antioxidant effects of PN in the acute stage of ischemic stroke.
In oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS) could damage
macromolecules such as nuclear acid and lipid to generate oxidized
products MDA (Ikonomidou and Kaindl, 2011). In vivo, superoxide dismutase (SOD) collaborated to modulate the quantity of ROS

65

(Ikonomidou and Kaindl, 2011). Therefore, in our study, we compared the level of MDA and the activity of SOD under the condition
with or without PN treating when suffered cerebral ischemia. Consistent with previous reports, our results showed that the activities
of MDA and SOD were both elevated signiﬁcantly in ischemia brain.
By contrast, PN signiﬁcantly reduced the formation of MDA and
enhanced the activities of SOD. This revealed that PN could attenuate oxidative stress via simultaneous upregulating endogenous
antioxidant defense enzymes and reducing lipid peroxidation.
The serine/threonine kinase Akt, known as protein kinase B
(PKB), is a central node in cell signaling downstream of growth factors, cytokines, and other cellular stimuli (Brendan et al., 2007).
When cells underwent oxidative injury, the phosphorylation of
Akt, at residues Thr308 in the activation loop of the kinase and at
Ser473 in the carboxy terminus, may provide a pro survival signal
during the cellular response (Wang et al., 2000). Whenever being
activated, Akt could phosphorylate a variety of survival regulatory
molecules including caspase-9, GSK3␤, eNOS and Nrf2, leading to
cell survival (Franke et al., 2003; Kwak et al., 2004; Zhang et al.,
2012; Wang et al., 2012). In the present study, we demonstrated
that PN concentration-dependently increased phosphorylation of
Akt in the brain followed ischemia. In contrast, total Akt was not
affected in both protein and gene levels. Thus, we may speculate
that increased activation of Akt provides an excellent therapeutic
target for PN to preserve neuron viability during the acute ischemic
period. Nrf2, as a downstream signaling of Akt, was related to HO1 expression (Kwak et al., 2004; Pi et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2001).
A schematic summary of the functional interactions of Akt and
Nrf2 is presented in Fig. 1. In a wide range of tissues, Nrf2 acts
as a master regulator of the antioxidant response (Kaspar et al.,
2009). Under basal nonactivated conditions, Nrf2 interacts with
Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap l) to form the Keap1-Nrf2 complex and limits Nrf2-mediated gene expression. Upon
activation, the Keap-1-Nrf2 complex is dissociated, Nrf2 translocates into the nuclei to bind ARE and coordinately upregulates
expression of several antioxidative enzymes recognized to play
important roles in combating oxidative stress, including HO-1, SOD
(Zhang and Gordon, 2004; Chen and Kong, 2004). Earlier reports
suggested the increasingly endogenous HO-1 provided potent survival signals during ischemia (Moreira et al., 2007; Sakata et al.,
2010). Furthermore, previously we presented clearly that the upregulation of nuclear Nrf2 and HO-1 were began at 3 h and peaked
at 24 h in ischemic cortex (Yang et al., 2009). Here, our ﬁndings
showed remarkable accumulating nuclear Nrf2, accompanied by
up-regulation of HO-1 in the ischemic penumbra of cortex treated
with PN at early stage of cerebral ischemia, suggesting that PN preconditioning may gain neuroprotection by regulating Nrf2 and its
target genes, HO-1. This concept is also supported by the report
in a model of 6-hydroxydopamine-induced oxidative damage in
cortical neurons (Tseng et al., 2012). Unexpectedly, in PN-L group,
compared with vehicle group, the activities of Nrf2 revealed no
obviously elevation at both the protein and gene levels. While,
on the contrary, the expression of pAkt increased. Considering
that Nrf2 phosphorylation dependent on multiple kinases, including PI3K/Akt, MEK/ERK and p38MAPK (Lee and Surh, 2005), the
approaches where PN works inducing Nrf2 activation may not be
conﬁned to one pathway, which will need further research.
As the gatekeeper of the CNS, the blood–brain barrier (BBB)
conceptualizes the presence of an immunological, transporter,
metabolic and physical barrier between the blood and the brain
(Persidsky et al., 2006). To establish BBB, well-developed tight junctions (TJs) between adjacent endothelial cells are indispensable,
in addition to various transporters in their plasma membranes.
TJs are one mode of cell–cell adhesion, and play a central role in

Fig. 3. Effect of PN on the protein expression of pAkt (Ser473), Akt, HO-1 and nuclear Nrf2 in ischemic cortex at 24 h after pMCAO. Western blotting analysis showed that
protein levels of Nrf2 in nuclei (A) and HO-1 in cytoplasm (B) were upregulated after pMCAO. Bar graph of western blot illustrated that PN induced to protein of nuclear Nrf2
(E) and HO-1 (F) ( P < 0.05) vs. Vehicle group. PN also promoted Akt phosphorylation after pMCAO. Western blotting photographs (C, D) and the respective quantity analysis
bar chart (G) showed the expression of pAkt (Ser473) was increased in PN-L and PN-H group ( P < 0.05) vs. Vehicle group. However total Akt was not affected in protein level
(D, G).

Fig. 4. Effect of PN on the protein and gene expression of claudin-5 (A, B, C). Western blotting photographs (A) and the respective quantity analysis bar chart (B) showed
the PNs effect on claudin-5 protein level, the bar graph (C) showed induction of claudin-5 mRNA by PN treatment (30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg). The expression of claudin-5
was signiﬁcantly promoted in protein and mRNA level in PN-L and PN-H ( P < 0.05) vs. Vehicle group. Effect of PN on gene expression of Akt, Nrf2 and HO-1 was shown
in (D). Compared with Vehicle group, PN up-regulated the expression of HO-1 and Nrf2 at 24 h in mRNA level after pMCAO, but only in PN-H group the difference showed
signiﬁcance ( P < 0.05). The expression of total Akt was not affected in gene level (P > 0.05, D).

transmembrane protein of TJs, is a critical determinant of BBB permeability in mice. Thus, altered expression of claudin-5 can lead to
“opening” of the paracellular route and increase brain endothelial
barrier permeability (Stamatovic et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2013). In
light of the important role of claudin-5 in regulating BBB permeability of cerebrovascular endothelial cells, we assess whether PN
exerts an impact on claudin-5. Our data showed the reduction of
claudin-5, induced by cerebral ischemia, was reversed by PN at the
protein and mRNA levels effectively, suggested that PN may ameliorate the BBB permeability through promoting the expression of
claudin-5. However, whether PN could sustain the integrity of BBB
is unclear and more work is required to understand the potential
effects of PN on attenuating the disruption of BBB.
Taking together, our ﬁndings validate that PN protect brain
tissues from oxidative insults. At least part of the neuroprotective
action of PN lies in upregulation of pAkt, Nrf2 and induction of
HO-1, which, along with other phase II enzymes (SOD), serve as
a defense system against oxidative stress. Moreover, sustaining
the tight junction of BBB further demonstrated the potential neuroprotection of PN. Thus, a corollary of this study is that PN may
represent a potentially beneﬁcial therapeutic avenue to harness
the neuroprotective Akt, Nrf2 and HO-1 for focal cerebral ischemic
stroke treatment.
