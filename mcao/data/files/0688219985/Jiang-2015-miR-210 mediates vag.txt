Abstract
Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) exerts neuroprotective effects
against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and modulates redox status, potentially through the activity of miR-210,
an important microRNA that is regulated by hypoxia-inducible
factor and Akt-dependent pathways. The aim of this study was
to determine the mechanisms of VNS- and miR-210-mediated
hypoxic tolerance. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were preconditioned with a miR-210 antagomir (A) or with an antagomir
control (AC), followed by middle cerebral artery occlusion and
VNS treatment. The animals were divided into eight groups:
sham I/R, I/R, I/R+AC, I/R+A, sham I/R+VNS, I/R+VNS, I/
R+VNS+AC, and I/R+VNS+A. Activation of the endogenous
cholinergic a7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (a7nAchR)
pathway was identiﬁed using double immunoﬂuorescence
staining. miR-210 expression was measured by PCR. Behavioral outcomes, infarct volume, and neuronal apoptosis were

Although many studies addressing neuroprotective treatments and strategies have been performed in animals, few
studies have been applied in clinical settings. Reestablishment of the blood supply, which is the most effective
treatment for acute cerebral ischemia, can also cause
reperfusion injury (Fu et al. 2014). Therefore, it is necessary
to investigate and develop more effective adjuvant treatments. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) – a safe and effective
treatment for epilepsy (Morris et al. 2013), treatmentresistant depression (Conway et al. 2012), and circulatory
shock (Guarini et al. 2003) – has also been shown to be
beneﬁcial for the treatment of ischemic stroke (Ay et al.
2009; Mravec 2010). However, the precise molecular
mechanisms underlying this treatment have not been
elucidated.

observed at 24 h following reperfusion. Markers of oxidative
stress were detected using ELISA. Rats treated with VNS
showed increased miR-210 expression as well as decreased
apoptosis and antioxidant stress responses compared with the
I/R group; these rats also showed increased p-Akt protein
expression and signiﬁcantly decreased levels of cleaved
caspase 3 in the ischemic penumbra, as measured by western
blot and immunoﬂuorescence analyses, respectively. Strikingly, the beneﬁcial effects of VNS were attenuated following
miR-210 knockdown. In conclusion, our results indicate that
miR-210 is a potential mediator of VNS-induced neuroprotection against I/R injury. Our study highlights the neuroprotective
potential of VNS, which, to date, has been largely unexplored.

MicroRNAs are highly conserved, small, noncoding RNAs
that are typically 18–24 nucleotides in length, and these
molecules have emerged as important regulators of many
biological processes, including differentiation, proliferation,
development, migration, and apoptosis. Under hypoxic
conditions, miR-210 regulates the translation of multiple
downstream genes and has profound effects on many disease
outcomes (Hong et al. 2013). To date, it has been demonstrated that miR-210 not only inﬂuences cardiac survival by
targeting apoptosis genes in vivo, but also, that it slows down
mitochondrial respiration to increase cell survival (Kim et al.
2009; Zhu and Fan 2012). It is appreciated that the excessive
generation of reactive oxygen species following ischemic
stroke can exacerbate DNA, protein, and fatty acid damage,
as well as impair tissue and cell survival. Several studies
indicate that VNS decreases reactive oxygen species production in myocardial and cerebral ischemic tissues (Kong
et al. 2012; Ekici et al. 2013). Moreover, miR-210 regulation is dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor and the Aktdependent pathway in both normal and transformed cells
(Greco et al. 2014). Interestingly, a growing body of
evidence suggests that VNS likely exerts an anti-infarct
effect on ischemic heart damage through activation of the
Akt cascade (Katare et al. 2009), which also has protective
effects in the CNS (Chen et al. 2014). Therefore, VNSinduced neuroprotection may be associated with antioxidant
and/or anti-apoptotic mechanisms. In our previous study, we
demonstrated that VNS most likely exerted its neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemic insult by activating a7
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (a7nAchR), leading to an
increase in p-Akt expression (Jiang et al. 2014). These
ﬁndings prompted us to hypothesize that miR-210 may be
involved in the neuroprotective effects of VNS on I/R injury
in the brain.
To verify this hypothesis, we ﬁrst examined the stimulation efﬁciency of VNS by measuring the expression of
a7nAchR in neurons and astrocytes, as well as by determining neurological scores, infarct volume, and neuronal
apoptosis. We subsequently explored the molecular effects
of miR-210 in the VNS response by assaying the levels of
three oxidative stress markers and caspase 3 activity in
ischemic stroke rats pretreated with a miR-210 antagomir or
an antagomir control.

Materials and methods
Animals and miR-210 antagomir preconditioning
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (250–300 g, n = 360) were obtained
from the Experimental Animal Center of Chongqing Medical
University. All experimental protocols were performed according to
the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and
were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Chongqing
Medical University (Permit No. SCXK (Chongqing) 2007-0001)
and the State Science and Technology Commission of China. The

animals were maintained in a 12/12 h light/dark cycle at 24  1°C
and 60% humidity and were given an adequate supply of food and
water. During the experiment, the rats were randomly divided into
eight groups: sham I/R, I/R, I/R+AC, I/R+A, sham I/R+VNS,
I/R+VNS, I/R+VNS+AC, and I/R+VNS+A.
To better identify the function of miR-210 in the VNS-induced
antioxidant stress and anti-apoptotic responses, a miR-210 antagomir (A) was used to knockdown miR-210 expression. The rats were
deeply anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (60 mg/kg) and
xylazine (10 mg/kg) and placed in a stereotaxic frame with a head
holder. The miR-210 antagomir and antagomir control (AC)
(Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China) were dissolved
in artiﬁcial CSF (aCSF; 119 mmol/L NaCl, 3.1 nmol/L KCl,
1.2 mmol/L CaCl2, 1 mmol/L MgSO4, 0.50 mmol/L KH2PO4,
25 mmol/L NaHCO3, 5 mmol/L D-glucose, and 2.2 mmol/L urea,
pH 7.4) at a concentration of 20 nmol/mL and continuously infused
at a rate of 1 lL/h into the lateral ventricles of the rat cohorts (n = 8/
group). The solution was infused using a minipump (Alza Co., Palo
Alto, CA, USA) connected to an Alzet brain infusion stainless steel
cannula via peristaltic tubing, according to a previous description
(Dharap et al. 2009) (coordinates: 0.8 mm posterior, 4.8 mm
dorsoventral, and 1.5 mm lateral to Bregma). The surgery to
implant both the cannula and pump was also performed under
anesthesia, according to a previous study (Dharap et al. 2009). After
3 days, the rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) surgery for 2 h, and reperfusion and VNS treatment were
subsequently initiated.

Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model and VNS
Three days after administration of the miR-210 antagomir or
antagomir control, transient MCAO was induced in the rats for 2 h
using the intraluminal suture technique, as previously described
(Koizumi et al. 1986), which was followed by reperfusion. Brieﬂy,
the rats were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (60 mg/kg)
and xylazine (10 mg/kg) during the surgery, and 24 G catheters
(Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey,
USA) were inserted into the caudal ventral artery of the tail. Blood
pressure was continuously monitored during the experiment. The
right common and external carotid arteries (CCA and ECA) were
exposed and ligated; the ECA was then cut at the distal portion. A 30 monoﬁlament nylon suture (Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co. Ltd.,
Beijing, China) coated with silica gel was inserted into the CCA and
advanced into the internal carotid artery. In addition, the cerebral
blood ﬂow changes of the right middle cerebral artery were
monitored by continuous laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (Perimed, North
Royalton, OH, USA), as previously described (Hiraki et al. 2012).
Decreases in average cerebral blood ﬂow to < 20–30% of the
baseline rate were considered as successful MCAO models. Blood
gas levels and heart rate were also monitored during these
procedures, and body temperature was maintained at normal
physiological levels using a heating pad, as previously described
(STARR Life Sciences, Allison Park, PA, USA) (Goyagi et al.
2011). After 30 min of ischemia, the animals were maintained in an
anesthetized state and received right cervical VNS delivered using a
Grass Model S48 stimulator and constant current unit. The
stimulating electrodes were self-constructed according to the method
used by Smith (Ay et al. 2011), and they comprised two polyethylene-coated curved silver wires held 1.5 mm apart by a solid bar.

Ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats

The electrodes were sutured to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and
wrapped around the right cervical nerve using a microscope, as
performed in our previous study (Jiang et al. 2014). The stimulation
pulses consisted of repeated square pulses of 0.5 mA in 30-s trains
(0.5 ms length at 20 Hz), which were repeated every 5 min and
lasted for 60 min (Ay et al. 2011). Two hours after occlusion,
reperfusion was initiated, and blood ﬂow restoration was conﬁrmed
by laser Doppler ﬂowmetry. Rats from the sham I/R group
underwent CCA and ECA surgical exposure but did not undergo
ﬁlament insertion; rats from the sham I/R+VNS group only received
electrical stimulation without occlusion.
Assessment of neurological deficit scores and infarct volumes
Neurological deﬁcit scores after 24 h of reperfusion were evaluated
using a scoring system that ranged from 0 to 4, which was modiﬁed
as previously described (Sch€abitz et al. 1996). The scores were
determined as follows: 0, no deﬁcit; 1, failure to extend the left
forepaw; 2, decreased grip strength of the left forepaw; 3, circling to
the left by pulling the tail; and 4, spontaneous circling (n = 8/
group).
Infarct volume was assessed using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) staining, as
previously described (Burnett et al. 2006). The brains (n = 8/group)
were rapidly removed and sliced into ﬁve serial 2-mm-thick sections
using a rodent brain matrix. The slices were stained with 1% TTC at
37°C for 30 min, ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde, photographed, and
quantiﬁed for ischemic damage using Image J Software, as
previously described (Won et al. 2014) (NIH Image, Bethesda,
MD, USA).
miRNA real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
The ischemic penumbra regions of the right cerebral cortex were
collected and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen (n = 8/group). Total
RNA was extracted from isolated cerebral cortices using the acid
guanidinium thiocyanate–phenol–chloroform method (TRIzol
reagent), and the RNA was resuspended in RNase-free water. The
A260/A280 ratios of the puriﬁed RNA samples were between 1.8
and 2.0. For the miR-210 expression analysis, total RNA was
transcribed using a TaqMan MicroRNA reverse transcription kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. miR-210 expression was assessed using
real-time PCR according to the TaqMan MicroRNA assay protocol
(Applied Biosystems). Ampliﬁcations were performed at 95°C
followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 70°C for
1 s. The levels of miR-210 were normalized to the endogenous
levels of U6 in each triplicate sample, and average expression levels
were calculated. The data were analyzed using the 2DCt method
(Livak and Schmittgen 2001), and p < 0.05 were considered
statistically signiﬁcant. The miR-210 sequence was 50 -CUGUG
CGUGUGACAGCGGCUGA-30 . The miR-210 antagomir was
synthesized by Ribobio Co. (Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd.); this
antagomir was a single-stranded RNA analog complementary to
mature miR-210.
Double immunofluorescence for a7nAChR and NeuN/GFAP and
immunofluorescence for caspase 3
The rats (n = 8/group) were deeply anesthetized and transcardially
perfused with saline and 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde.

175

The brains were sliced into 10-lm-thick coronal sections, incubated
with 0.4% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and washed with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) for 15 min. After blocking with donkey serum
for 30 min at 37°C, the sections were incubated with primary
antibodies diluted in PBS [rabbit anti-a7nAchR, 1 : 500, mouse antiNeuN, 1 : 200, rabbit anti-cleaved caspase 3 (1 : 100; Abcam,
Cambridge, UK) or mouse anti-glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (1 : 100;
Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA)] at 4°C overnight.
The sections were subsequently treated with Alexa Fluor-555 donkey
anti-rabbit Ig (H+G) (1 : 200) or IFKine Green Donkey anti-mouse
IgG (H+G) (1 : 200) for 90 min at 37°C. Three areas in the cortex of
the ischemic penumbra were imaged using laser-scanning confocal
microscopy (Nikon TE2000, Tokyo, Japan and LEICA TCS SP2,
Solms, Germany). Caspase 3-positive cells were quantitatively
measured using ImageJ software. All analyses were performed by
investigators who were blinded to the treatment conditions.
TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay
To examine brain histopathology at 24 h post-I/R, brain slices
(n = 5/group) were stained using an in situ cell death detection kit,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Yang et al. 2000).
Brieﬂy, the sections were permeabilized with 1% proteinase K for
15 min, rinsed with PBS, exposed to the TdT-mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) reaction for 1 h at 37°C, and then washed
again in PBS for 5 min. Five randomly selected regions within the
ischemic penumbra in the right cerebral hemisphere were counted
under high-power magniﬁcation (4009). Three slices per brain were
counted by a blinded investigator, and the average number of
TUNEL-positive cells was recorded.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
Twenty-four hours after surgery, the rats (n = 8/group) were
sacriﬁced, and the brains were immediately removed. Brain tissues
were isolated and homogenized in potassium phosphate buffer.
After centrifugation, the supernatant, which contained the crude
membranes, was prepared for measuring methane dicarboxylic
aldehyde (MDA); the remainder of the supernatant was centrifuged
once again and used to estimate superoxide dismutase (SOD) and
glutathione (GSH) levels. The levels of MDA, SOD, and GSH in the
ischemic penumbra cortex tissue homogenates were analyzed using
commercially available kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Biological Technology, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The experiments were performed in triplicate.
Western blotting
The rats (n = 8/group) were decapitated at 24 h after reperfusion.
The brain tissues of the ipsilateral penumbra were dissected on ice.
The samples were homogenized with protein extraction reagent
(Pierce, Illinois, USA) supplemented with protease inhibitors. The
supernatants were collected, and the total protein concentrations
were analyzed with a Bio-Rad Dc protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA). Equivalent amounts of total protein were separated using
10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,
transferred onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA), blocked with a 5% skim milk solution,
washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 and
probed with primary antibodies, including a rabbit anti-phospho Akt
(1 : 1000; Cell Signaling Technology), a rabbit anti-cleaved caspase

3 antibody (1 : 1000; Abcam) and a mouse anti-b-actin antibody
(1 : 5000; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), at 4°C overnight. The
membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies for 2 h at 37°C.
The western blot signals were quantiﬁed using an enhanced
chemiluminescence kit and examined using the Bio-Image Analysis
System (Bio-Rad). The expression ratio of each target protein was
normalized against the expression of b-actin.
Statistical analyses
All values are expressed as the mean  SEM of at least three
independent experiments performed in triplicate. Comparisons
between multiple groups were conducted using one-way ANOVA,
followed by a post hoc Tukey’s multiple-comparisons test. The
neurological scores were analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis test.
p < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. All statistical analyses were
performed using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS)
(Version 17.0).

Results
Physiological parameters
The mean values for blood pressure, heart rate, and blood gas
were not signiﬁcantly different among the groups, and all
values were within the normal range (Table 1). The results
indicated that VNS treatment had no signiﬁcant effect on
these parameters during the experiment, which was consistent with previous study. (Sun et al. 2012).
Activation of a7nAChR in the ischemic penumbra following
VNS treatment
To determine the stimulation effectiveness in ischemic stroke
rats, we used a double immunoﬂuorescence staining assay to
detect the induction of a7nAchR expression. As shown in
Fig. 1, ischemic insult caused a signiﬁcant reduction in
a7nAchR expression at the surfaces of neurons and astrocytes, whereas VNS treatment mitigated this effect. Our
results demonstrate that VNS treatment affects brain tissues
through the activation of a7nAchR, the expression of which
plays an important role in the activation of intracellular
signaling pathways via a7nAchR expression.

miR-210 levels under various experimental conditions
As miR-210 is robustly and uniquely increased during
hypoxia, we conﬁrmed the expression of miR-210 using realtime PCR at 24 h following reperfusion near the ischemic
boundary in rats. As shown in Fig. 2, compared with the I/R
group, miR-210 level was not signiﬁcantly different from
that in the I/R+AC group; however, it was signiﬁcantly
decreased following miR-210 blockade (p < 0.05). A further
increase in miR-210 expression was identiﬁed in the I/
R+VNS and I/R+VNS+AC groups (p < 0.05), whereas the
level of miR-210 was reduced in the I/R+VNS+A group,
albeit to a lower extent (p < 0.05). These results suggested
that as a protective factor, miR-210 activity could be blocked
using the miR-210 antagomir. Moreover, VNS treatment
could continue to enhance the expression of miR-210
following ischemic stroke, whereas in the I/R+VNS+A
group, the level of miR-210 was down-regulated, which
indicates that miR-210 was likely involved in the response
induced by VNS. Furthermore, the levels of miR-210 were
not different between the I/R+VNS+AC and I/R+VNS
groups and decreased in the I/R+VNS+A group compared
with the I/R+VNS group. These ﬁndings further support the
relationship between miR-210 and VNS treatment. Incidentally, the miR-210 level was increased to a greater extent in
the I/R and I/R+VNS groups compared with the sham I/R
and sham I/R+VNS groups, respectively (p < 0.05). These
ﬁndings indicate that miR-210 is rapidly up-regulated in
response to hypoxia, consistent with previous studies (Qiu
et al. 2013).
Blockade of miR-210 impairs the improvements in
neurological deficit scores and infarct volumes induced by
VNS
As shown in Fig. 3(a and b), we evaluated neurological
scores and infarct volumes in rats pretreated with the miR210 antagomir to determine the effects of silencing miR-210
expression following I/R and VNS treatment. There was no
signiﬁcant difference between the I/R+AC and I/R groups.
Increased neurological deﬁcit scores and infarct volume were
identiﬁed in the I/R+A group compared with the I/R group.

Consistent with previous studies, VNS exerted signiﬁcant
neuroprotective effects, including improvements in neurological function and reductions in infarct volume compared
with ischemic stroke rats; similar effects were also observed
in the I/R+VNS+AC group. By contrast, these results
appeared more severe in the I/R+VNS+A group compared
with the I/R group. No changes were observed between the I/
R+VNS+AC and I/R+VNS groups. The improvements in
neurological deﬁcit scores and infarct volume induced by
VNS treatment were signiﬁcantly reduced as a result of miR210 knockdown, which was demonstrated via the comparison of the I/R+VNS+A and I/R+VNS groups. Based on our
ﬁndings, we conclude that miR-210 exerts protection against
ischemic infarct and mediates the neuroprotective effect of
VNS in cerebral ischemia rats.
Blockade of miR-210 via its antagomir attenuates the
VNS-mediated protection against I/R injury
As shown in Fig. 4, to further explore the role of miR-210 in
mediating the protection induced by VNS against I/R injury
in rats, we measured neuronal apoptotic markers after
blocking miR-210. Compared with the I/R group, the number
of TUNEL-positive cells was not remarkably different from

that of the I/R+AC group and was signiﬁcantly increased
compared with the I/R+A group, whereas it decreased after
VNS treatment (p < 0.05). By contrast, an increased number
of TUNEL-positive cells was identiﬁed in the ischemic
penumbra in the I/R+VNS+A group compared with the I/R
group. These ﬁndings indicated that miR-210 silencing
exacerbated neuronal damage under hypoxic conditions.
VNS treatment attenuated the apoptotic response, whereas
this protection was decreased following miR-210 blockade
preconditioning. Furthermore, there was no signiﬁcant
difference between the I/R+VNS+AC and I/R+VNS groups.
However, the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the
I/R+VNS+A group was greater than in the I/R+VNS group
(p < 0.05). The results indicated that miR-210 down-regulation could markedly inﬂuence the VNS-mediated suppression of neuronal apoptosis. Thus, it appeared that miR-210
played a crucial role in the VNS-mediated anti-apoptosis
effect against ischemic injury in rats.
miR-210 is involved in the VNS-regulated oxidative stress
response following cerebral ischemia in rats
Cerebral ischemia results in the generation of excessive free
radicals and lipid peroxidation. The three tested markers did
not show signiﬁcant changes in the I/R+AC group compared
with the I/R group. MDA was signiﬁcantly unregulated,
whereas SOD and GSH were both down-regulated in the
I/R+A group compared with the I/R group. Consistent with
previous studies, we veriﬁed that VNS could decrease MDA
levels and increase SOD and GSH levels to prevent further
damage to brain tissues. No signiﬁcant difference was
identiﬁed between the I/R+VNS+AC and I/R+VNS groups.
After miR-210 knockdown, the MDA level was higher in the
I/R+VNS+A group compared with the I/R and I/R+VNS
groups, whereas GSH and SOD activity levels remained
lower (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5). In addition, ischemic stroke led to
the up-regulation of MDA and the down-regulation of SOD
and GSH activity; however, these effects were reversed
following VNS treatment. These results also indicate that
increased miR-210 expression reduces oxidative stress and
that the antioxidant stress effects of VNS treatment are
inhibited by miR-210 blockade.

Suppression of postischemic apoptosis induced by VNS is
attenuated following miR-210 knockdown preconditioning
To examine the role of miR-210 mediation in the antiapoptotic effect induced by VNS, the protein levels of p-Akt and
activated caspase 3 were measured by western blot analysis.
There were no signiﬁcant differences in p-Akt protein
expression among the I/R+AC, I/R+A and I/R groups,
whereas there was an increase in p-Akt expression in the
I/R+VNS, I/R+VNS+AC, and I/R+VNS+A groups compared
with the I/R group. No signiﬁcant differences were detected
among the I/R+VNS, I/R+VNS+AC and I/R+VNS+A
groups. Therefore, VNS caused an increase in p-Akt protein
expression following ischemia and was not signiﬁcantly
affected by miR-210 knockdown. Caspase 3 activity did not
signiﬁcantly change in the I/R+AC group, but it was
markedly up-regulated in the I/R+A group compared with
the I/R group. Importantly, the activity of caspase 3 was
suppressed following VNS, whereas this inhibition was
diminished in the I/R+VNS+A group compared with the I/R
and I/R+VNS groups (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6a and b). Furthermore, caspase 3 protein expression in the I/R and I/R+VNS
groups was signiﬁcantly higher compared with the sham I/R

and sham I/R+VNS groups, respectively (p < 0.05). These
results also suggested that VNS suppressed the apoptotic
response following I/R. During this process, the action of
miR-210 appears to be a protective factor that augments
brain tissue survival. As expected, the anti-apoptotic effect
induced by VNS treatment was decreased after miR-210
antagomir preconditioning. Therefore, miR-210 could
mediate the antiapoptotic response induced by VNS in
postischemic rat brains.

Discussion
Recent studies demonstrated that VNS initiated 30 min after
cerebral middle artery occlusion in rats reduced ischemic
lesion volume, improved the neurological outcomes, reduced
brain water content, and suppressed inﬂammatory cytokines
(Mravec 2010). The beneﬁts of VNS are associated with its
central projections to various brain structures. The afferents
of the vagus nerve ﬁbers project bilaterally to the nucleus
tractus solitarius in the medulla oblongata, which then
projects to the locus coeruleus, the major source of
norepinephrine in the brain. Furthermore, polysynaptic

projections from the nucleus tractus solitarius also innervate
many other brain areas, including the thalamus, hypothalamus, limbic system, and cerebral cortex. It is well established
that norepinephrine can stimulate 5-HT and acetylcholine

(ACh) release to exert potent anti-inﬂammatory effects in the
brain (Cheyuo et al. 2011). Abundant evidence suggests that
a7nAchR, which is an effector receptor that can be activated
by drugs or electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve, plays an

important role in the protective effects of VNS toward I/R
injury in the brain. For example, the activation and
up-regulation of Akt phosphorylation is involved in
donepezil-dependent neuroprotection, which counteracts
glutamate-induced neurotoxicity via a7nAchR activation
(Oda et al. 2007). In our study, we measured various
physiological parameters during the experimental process, all
of which remained within the normal range. The simultaneous activation of a7nAchR on neurons and astrocytes was
identiﬁed via immunoﬂuorescence after VNS treatment,
providing visual evidence of the effectiveness of electrical
stimulation in the rat brain following ischemia.
miR-210 is a highly conserved, small, noncoding RNA
that participates in hypoxia-dependent disease states, including apoptosis, inﬂammation, and tumorigenesis. miR-210
exhibits neuroprotective effects via the inhibition of apoptosis in a murine model of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
(Qiu et al. 2013). Similarly, a recent study demonstrated that
the introduction of a minicircle vector carrying a miR-210
precursor into an ischemic heart could dramatically improve
heart function by the promotion of angiogenesis and the
inhibition of apoptosis (Zhu and Fan 2012). In addition,
Yang et al. (2012) demonstrated that miR-210 down-regulation signiﬁcantly increased the apoptotic rate and radiosensitivity of human hepatoma cells. Our results indicate that
miR-210 expression was up-regulated following VNS compared with the corresponding I/R groups. Furthermore, the
up-regulation of miR-210 was positively correlated with
lower neurological scores and smaller infarct volumes.
Following miR-210 blockade, the neuroprotective effects of
VNS were decreased. These results suggest that miR-210 is
involved in the VNS-mediated neuroprotection.
miR-210 is not only a potential stroke marker, but it may
also be a key factor in the repression of mitochondrial
metabolism in many cell types under hypoxic conditions. In
one study, miR-210 overexpression increased the protection
of mesenchymal stem cells against oxidative stress-induced
injury; in another study, miR-210 knockdown in myoblasts
signiﬁcantly elevated myotube sensitivity to oxidative stress
and resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction (Greco et al.
2014). VNS also confers protection against the accumulation
of free radicals during myocardial and cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion (I/R) in rats (Kong et al. 2012; Ekici et al.
2013). Therefore, we attempted to determine whether miR210 was also involved in the VNS-mediated antioxidant
signaling pathway. Our results indicate that VNS can
signiﬁcantly modulate the oxidative stress response, concomitant with an increase in miR-210. Indeed, the antioxidant effect of VNS induction was greatly decreased by miR210 blockade. Therefore, we infer that miR-210 plays an
important role in the VNS-mediated antioxidant response,
which also leads to an anti-apoptotic effect.
Kim et al. (2009) demonstrated that rat mesenchymal
stem cell survival was improved by increasing the expres-

sion of miR-210, which led to decreased levels of
CASP8AP2, a direct target of miR-210 that was negatively
correlated with cell survival. Increased miR-210 levels could
have an effect on the activity of caspase 3/7 in hypoxia.
Some, but not all, studies have suggested that miR-210 may
be induced by p-Akt, which is another regulator of the
hypoxia response (Chan and Loscalzo 2010). Kawada and
coworkers conﬁrmed that VNS signiﬁcantly enhanced
myocardial interstitial ACh levels in the ischemic region
compared with baseline levels, triggering a cascade of
survival signals through Akt phosphorylation and the
inhibition of proapoptotic cascades (Kawada et al. 2007).
These ﬁndings indicate that miR-210 and p-Akt could be
correlated with the VNS-mediated antiapoptotic effects
against ischemic damage. Consistent with this hypothesis,
our results indicate that VNS exerts an anti-apoptotic effect,
which is accompanied by an increase in p-Akt protein levels
in the rat brain following I/R and a concomitant increase in
miR-210 expression. Therefore, our ﬁndings suggest that
VNS plays a critical role in facilitating the adaptation of
brain tissues to hypoxic stress. To further evaluate the role of
miR-210 in the anti-apoptotic effect of VNS, a miR-210
antagomir was administered to the lateral ventricles prior to
MCAO surgery and VNS treatment. The anti-apoptotic
effect induced by VNS was decreased after miR-210
knockdown pretreatment, and brain damage was not reduced
under these conditions. These results indicate that miR-210
mediates the VNS-induced antiapoptotic effects in ischemic
stroke in rats.
Although the results of the miRNA array analysis
indicated that there are also many other endogenous miRNAs
involved in cerebral I/R processes, when considering our
previous ﬁndings, we chose to focus on miR-210, which
emerged as a major potential regulator of the VNS-mediated
neuroprotective effect. Additional investigations of other
miRNAs are required in the future.
Taken together, these results indicate that miR-210 may be
involved in the antioxidant and anti-apoptotic responses
induced by VNS against I/R damage. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report regarding the neuroprotective mechanism of VNS at the mRNA level. The downregulation of miR-210 attenuated the antiapoptotic and
antioxidant effects induced by VNS in I/R rats. In summary,
our ﬁndings provide valuable insight into the association
between miR-210 and VNS-induced neuroprotection.
