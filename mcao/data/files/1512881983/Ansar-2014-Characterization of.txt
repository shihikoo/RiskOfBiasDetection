Abstract This study characterizes a new model of thromboembolic stroke of the middle cerebral artery in C57 black/6J
mice, thus offering an opportunity to use the model for studying ischemic stroke in transgenic mice. Thromboembolic
stroke was induced by local injection of either 1.5 or 3.0 UI
of thrombin directly into the right MCA of C57 black/6J mice.
Cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity was measured continuously
by laser Doppler flowmetry, which allowed documentation of
both MCA occlusion and of spontaneous recanalization. After
24 h, all animals were euthanized. Cryosections were cut at
400-μm intervals and silver stained with the high-contrast method for volumetric assessment of infarct size. Interleukin (IL)-6,
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), caspase-3 and hsp 70
protein levels were investigated by immunofluorescence.
Thrombin injection resulted in clot formation in all animals.
Cortical infarction occurred in 63 % of the mice while 37 % had
a spontaneous MCA recanalization during the first 20 min
following thrombin injection. In cases of successful MCA occlusion with consequent infarction, the clot was stable up to 2 h
after formation. Subsequently, 20 % recanalized spontaneously.
Infarctions were restricted to the cortex with a mean lesion
volume of 36±5 for 1.5 UI and 56±8 for 3.0 UI thrombin.
Protein levels of IL-6, TNF-α, caspase-3, and hsp 70 were
significantly increased after MCAO. The results demonstrate
that the mouse thromboembolic stroke model produces cortical
infarctions of consistent size in C57 black/6J mice, which is
dependent upon the amount of thrombin used for clot formation.
Spontaneous MCA recanalization occurs after 2 h of ischemia in
20 % of mice. Thus, the thromboembolic model is an applicable

features of human stroke, including spontaneous recanalization.
However, strain differences between Swiss and C57 black/6J
mice must be taken into account when using the model.

Introduction
Although numerous treatment strategies have shown a beneficial effect in animal models of cerebral ischemia, very few
have been shown to improve outcome in human phase III
trials [20]. Indeed, the outcome of statistically reliable prospective phase III trials was positive in only 3 out of 11
thrombolytic interventions and in none of 19 neuroprotection
trials [13]. Even the Stroke Acute Ischemia NXY-059
(SAINT) trial failed to show any efficacy, despite convincing
preclinical and phase IIb data [23]. Apart from a multitude of
factors related to poor study design [17], the animal model
itself may contribute to this lack of translation through its
inability to adequately represent the pathophysiology of
naturally occurring cerebral ischemia. Different models of
experimental focal cerebral ischemia are known to exhibit
different pathophysiologies, which respond differently to
therapeutic interventions but which are of variable relevance
to the clinical setting [11].
A number of stroke models have been used in a variety of
species [3, 6, 11, 15, 16]. The intraluminal suture transient
MCA occlusion (MCAO) model is the most frequently used
model as it produces much lower mortality than the permanent
MCAO model, provides reproducibility and allows reperfusion. Its relevance to naturally occurring stroke in
humans, however, is questionable. Indeed, it was recently
recommended that this model should be eliminated from

Transl. Stroke Res. (2014) 5:526–533

the repertoire of preclinical stroke research [13], because
it leads to a secondary injury developing after a free
interval of as long as 6–12 h, which does not reflect the
true pathophysiology of stroke [13]. The thromboembolic
stroke model mimics human stroke more closely than
other models, since most of the human strokes are caused
by thromboembolism [6, 15]. However, these models
have accomplished limited significance in the stroke research field due to their variability in producing accurate
and reproducible infarct volumes [19, 28]. In addition, the
mortality rate is high [1]. Thus, there remains a need to
develop appropriate animal models for stroke preclinical
research.
Recently, a novel mouse model based on an in situ thromboembolic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was
described that demonstrated a precise and reproducible infarct
volume with low mortality rate [21]. In this study, we characterize the adaptation of this model to C57 black/6J mice, a
mouse strain offering the advantage of investigating stroke
pathophysiology in transgenic mice.

Materials and Methods
All animal procedures were carried out strictly within national
laws and guidelines and were approved by the Ethical
Committee for Laboratory Animal Experiments at the state
council in Karlsruhe, Germany. All institutional and national
guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals were
followed.
Thromboembolic Stroke
Thromboembolic stroke was induced by local injection of
thrombin directly into right MCA of mice as originally described by Orset et al. [21]. Briefly, male C57 black/6J mice
(20–30 g) were anesthetized with 5 % isoflurane and thereafter maintained with 1–2 % isoflurane during the surgical
procedure. An electric temperature probe was inserted into
the rectum of the mouse to record body temperature, which
was maintained at 37 °C with a heat pad. The mice were
placed in a stereotaxic device and the temporal muscle was
retracted. A small craniotomy was performed, the dura was
excised, and the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was exposed.
The laser Doppler flow probe for measurement of cortical
CBF was placed on the skull in the MCA territory with a drop
of glue. Finally, a micropipette filled with 1 μl of purified
murine alpha-thrombin (1.5 or 3 UI) was introduced into the
lumen of the MCA bifurcation and injected carefully to induce
the formation of a clot in situ (Fig. 1). The pipette was
removed 10 min after the injection at which time the
clot had stabilized. CBF velocity was measured continuously
by laser Doppler flowmetry allowing determination of

spontaneous clot dissolution. A clot was defined as successful
when the cerebral blood flow velocity decreased to a
minimum of 60 % from baseline at the time of thrombin
injection and remained stable. CBF was measured
throughout the duration of the experiment. After 24 h
mice were euthanized and the brains were removed and frozen
in isopentane.
Quantification of Infarct Size
Postmortem, 10-μm coronal cryosections were cut at 400-μm
intervals and stained with high contrast silver infarct method
[27]. Focal edema in the ischemic hemisphere was determined
according to Swanson et al. [26]. Photographs of each coronal
section were taken and analyzed using ImageJ.
Histology Examination
Hematoxylin–eosin–saffron staining was carried out for further neuropathological analysis. The neurons in the ischemic
area were classified as intact or necrotic. The neurons were
classified as necrotic when the cell was swelling and showed
karyolysis, pyknosis, karyorhexis, cytoplasmic eosinophilia
or loss of affinity for hematoxylin [7, 14, 24]. The area of
severe ischemic neuronal damage (necrotic) was expressed as
percentage of the total area of the brain and corrected for the
presence of edema [5].
Immunohistochemistry
For immunohistochemistry, the indirect immunofluorescence
method was used. The brains were removed and frozen in icecold isopentane. They were then sectioned into 10-μm-thick
slices in a cryostat. The cerebral cryosections were fixed for
10 min in ice-cold acetone and thereafter rehydrated in

528

phosphate buffer solution (PBS) containing 0.25 % Triton X100 for 15 min. The tissue was then permeabilized and
blocked for 1 h in blocking solution containing PBS, 0.25 %
Triton X-100, 1 % BSA and 5 % normal donkey serum. The
sections were incubated over night at 4 °C with the following
primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal IL-6 (Abcam, ab6672),
diluted 1:200, rabbit polyclonal hsp 70 (Abcam, ab2787),
diluted 1:50, rabbit polyclonal caspase 3 (Abcam, ab4051),
diluted 1:50, rabbit polyclonal TNF-α (Abcam, ab6671), diluted 1:200. All dilutions were done in PBS containing 0.2 %
Triton X-100, BSA 1 and 2 % normal goat serum. Sections
were subsequently washed with PBS and incubated with
secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibody used was goat-anti-rabbit Alexa 488 conjugated
(Invitrogen), diluted 1:400 in PBS containing 0.2 % TritonX100 and BSA 1 %. In addition, double staining with DAPI
(KPL) 1:5,000 was performed. The sections were washed
subsequently with PBS and mounted with mounting medium
(Moviol). The same procedure was used for the negative controls but primary antibodies were omitted. The immunoreactivity
of the antibodies were visualized and photographed with
a Nikon confocal microscope A1R fitted with fluorescence
optics at the appropriate wavelength.
Images were analyzed using the ImageJ software (http://
rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The fluorescence in different areas in
each section was measured and a mean value was calculated.
The same ROI was used for the ipsilateral and contralateral
sides. These values are presented as percentage fluorescence
in the ipsilateral compared to the contralateral group, where
the contralateral side is set to 100 %.

Results
Thromboembolic Stroke Model
A total of 126 surgeries were performed. A total of 82 (65 %)
of animals were excluded from the study because of an unsuitable location of the MCA bifurcation for thrombin injection, bleeding complications, or spontaneous reperfusion
within 20 min (for details see Fig. 2). Out of the 82 animals,
46 were excluded before thrombin injection. Of the 70 animals that were injected with thrombin, 63 % demonstrated
stable clot formation and cortical brain injury (Fig. 3). In 37 %
of the animals, we obtained a spontaneous recanalization
within 20 min which is equivalent to unstable clot formation
(Fig. 2) As a result of injecting the thrombin, the cortical blood
flow dropped rapidly to 13±4 % of resting flow. The stability
of the clot was studied by laser Doppler measurement up to 5 h
after clot formation. The results showed a stable clot up to 2 h
after formation, subsequently 20 % of the animals recanalized
spontaneously (Fig. 4). In all animals where a stable clot was
obtained after 20 min, the clot remained stable up to 2 h. There

was no difference in success of clot formation between 1.5 and

more in MCAO as compared to control (100±14 %) and (7 %)
(Figs. 7 and 8).

Infarct Volume

Discussion

Injection of thrombin resulted in an infarct that was restricted
to the cortex with a mean lesion volume of 36±5 mm3 for
1.5 UI and 56±8 mm3 for 3.0 UI thrombin (Fig. 5). The infarct
size and location was highly reproducible. No edema was
detected for any of the groups.

In this study, we characterized the model of thromboembolic
stroke reported by Orset et al. for C57 black/6J mice [21].
Thrombin injection into the MCA resulted in clot formation in
all animals. Cortical infarction occurred in 63 % of the mice
while 37 % had a spontaneous MCA recanalization during the
first 20 min following thrombin injection. In cases of successful MCA occlusion with consequent infarction, the clot was
stable up to 2 h after formation. Subsequently, 20 %
recanalized spontaneously. Infarctions were restricted to the
cortex with a mean lesion volume of 36±5 mm3 for 1.5 UI and
56±8 mm3 for 3.0 UI thrombin. Protein levels of IL-6,
TNF-α, caspase-3, and hsp 70 were significantly increased
after MCAO.
Thus, the model that we have characterized in this study
satisfies major criteria for an appropriate animal model for
stroke research: (1) it produces a clot formation with accurate
and reproducible brain damage, (2) it mimics the human
situation where the majority of ischemic strokes results from
a sudden occlusion of a blood vessel (most often middle
cerebral artery) by a thrombus or embolism, (3) it activates
the common cascades such as inflammatory reactions, stress
genes, and apoptosis that are normally triggered 24–48 h after
stroke [4, 8, 12, 22].

Histopathological Features
The ipsilateral cortex showed massive vacuolation of neutrophils
and shrunken, scalloped, and pycnotic neurons (Fig. 6).
Protein Expression Examined with Immunohistochemistry
The localization and activation of the protein levels were
examined by confocal microscopy and immunocytochemistry
using selective antibodies towards inflammatory mediators
(IL-6, TNF-α), apoptosis (caspase 3) and stress factor (hsp
70). Double immunohistochemistry staining versus nucleus,
were performed to verify the localization. The inflammatory
mediators IL-6 (182±14 %) and TNF-α (227±30 %) protein
levels were increased in the infarct compared to the contralateral side (100±14 %) (Figs. 6 and 7). Similarly, caspase-3
(259±17 %) and hsp 70 (178±21 %) proteins were expressed

Unfortunately, 65 % of animals were excluded from the
study because of an unsuitable location of the MCA bifurcation
for thrombin injection, bleeding complications, or spontaneous
reperfusion within 20 min. Further obstacles of this model
include the necessity for a craniotomy and the difficulty of
assessing functional neurological deficits. In this study, we
evaluated for the first time this stroke model's effect upon
inflammatory processes, stress genes, and apoptosis. In addition,
we evaluated the stability of the clot to determine the suitability
of the model for investigations of new therapies. The results
show that if the clot remains stable during the first 20 min,

after thrombolysis may be difficult, since late spontaneous
recanalization may occur (in our study 20 %). Previous investigations have evaluated the new thromboembolic model in
Swiss mice[21]. In the present investigation, we have adapted
and characterized the model in another strain, the C57 black/6J
mouse, which provides new opportunities for studies with

transgenic animals. Several studies have demonstrated that the
same stroke model may produce variable results in different
strains. Thus, it is of great importance that the thromboembolic
model developed in Swiss mice is carefully characterized in C57
black/6J mice before performing stroke-related experiments in
these animals. The major variation that we could observe with

532

the two strains is that a higher concentration of thrombin is
required in C57 black/6J mice to obtain a comparatively similar
size of infarction as in the Swiss mice [10, 21] of similar weight.
This may be due to differences in the cerebrovascular anatomy
of the circle of Willis, which has been shown to result in
different susceptibility to cerebral infarction following MCAO
in different mouse strains [2]. Elegant studies have been performed showing the high density of collaterals between the
ACA and MCA in C57BL/6j mice. However, there is a paucity
of such information on Swiss mice. Wang et al. reported that
anastomoses between the MCA and ACA in Swiss mice were
present at birth but were almost absent within 2 weeks [29]. So
we could assume that there are likely significant differences in
such anastomoses between C57BL/6J and Swiss mice. It may
be that a higher dose of thrombin was required to shut down
collateral flow as compared to the Swiss mouse. Furthermore,
physical trauma to the MCA during the injection of thrombin
could limit blood flow and small clots formed at more distal
sites could limit flow in collaterals and the descending arterioles.
However, in our histological examinations on animals with
stable clots after 20 min, we did not observe a downstream
distribution of clots in such specimens. Likewise, we have not
seen signs of distal embolism outside the infarct area in 9.4 T
MRI monitoring of this procedure (data not shown). Another
difference between the models is that C57 black/6J mice seem to
be less suitable for the surgical procedure than Swiss mice, due
to the location of the MCA bifurcation for thrombin injection,
which is often less accessible.
The question of how clot composition can affect treatment
efficacy of an occluded vessel is currently a topic of keen
interest [18]. Previous analysis of clots produced by the model
of thrombin injection in Swiss mice has demonstrated that
they consist mainly of polymerized fibrin containing a low
number of cells and platelets [21]. This composition is likely
different from that of clots in humans. Analysis of clots
causing cerebral infarction in humans retrieved by means of
the Merci device showed that about 75 % of the clots
demonstrated platelet/fibrin accumulation, linear neutrophil/
monocyte deposition, and erythrocyte-rich accumulation [25].
Interestingly, the data from this study showed no correlation of
thrombus histology with presumed stroke etiology. Moreover,
there was no association between thrombus histology and
treatment response. One explanation for the difficulty in
assessing the response of thrombolytic therapies in terms of
clot composition alone may be the highly complex ultrastructure of clots. Electron scanning microscopy has demonstrated
a wide variety of thrombi from occluded cerebral arteries in
humans with a highly diverse organization of fibrin, platelets,
and red cells both within each thrombus and across various
thrombi studied [18]. Thus, although our model may not
accurately reflect clot composition in human ischemic stroke,
it may provide an opportunity for studying the influence of
different clot components in the same model, e.g., injection of

Transl. Stroke Res. (2014) 5:526–533

thrombin vs. injection of FeCL3 (leading to platelet-rich
thrombi) on the efficacy of rt-PA thrombolysis. Further studies
evaluating thrombolysis with rt-PA in our model will be
necessary to validate these contentions.
Brain temperature is a well-known critical variable in
stroke research. In the present study, we monitored body
temperature with a rectal probe. Our previous data on invasive
brain temperature monitoring demonstrated a direct correlation of rectal temperature and brain temperature in rats [9].
When the rat brain temperature rose, there was an equal rise in
the rectal temperature. However, this relationship may be
more precarious in the mouse. There is some evidence that
normal C57 black/6J mice have a slightly lower brain temperature as compared to their rectal temperature and that under
intoxication with ethanol, for example, this relationship no
longer holds. Whether invasive brain temperature monitoring
is necessary in the mouse stroke model may depend upon the
type of experiments that are performed. At any rate, should
inconsistent results occur when using the model, it would
be important to rule out brain temperature as a possible
confounding factor.
In summary, the novel thromboembolic model in mice
provides a useful tool to stroke researchers in the evaluation
of efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapies and for studies
of transgenic animals.
