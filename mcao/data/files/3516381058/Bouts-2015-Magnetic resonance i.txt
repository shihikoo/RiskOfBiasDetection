Abstract 
Background:  Spatial and temporal changes in brain tissue after acute ischemic stroke are still poorly understood.
Aims of this study were three-fold: (1) to determine unique temporal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns at
the acute, subacute and chronic stages after stroke in macaques by combining quantitative T2 and diffusion MRI indices into MRI ‘tissue signatures’, (2) to evaluate temporal differences in these signatures between transient (n = 2) and
permanent (n = 2) middle cerebral artery occlusion, and (3) to correlate histopathology findings in the chronic stroke
period to the acute and subacute MRI derived tissue signatures.
Results:  An improved iterative self-organizing data analysis algorithm was used to combine T2, apparent diffusion
coefficient (ADC), and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps across seven successive timepoints (1, 2, 3, 24, 72, 144, 240 h)
which revealed five temporal MRI signatures, that were different from the normal tissue pattern (P < 0.001). The distribution of signatures between brains with permanent and transient occlusions varied significantly between groups
(P < 0.001). Qualitative comparisons with histopathology revealed that these signatures represented regions with
different histopathology. Two signatures identified areas of progressive injury marked by severe necrosis and the presence of gitter cells. Another signature identified less severe but pronounced neuronal and axonal degeneration, while
the other signatures depicted tissue remodeling with vascular proliferation and astrogliosis.
Conclusion:  These exploratory results demonstrate the potential of temporally and spatially combined voxel-based
methods to generate tissue signatures that may correlate with distinct histopathological features. The identification of
distinct ischemic MRI signatures associated with specific tissue fates may further aid in assessing and monitoring the
efficacy of novel pharmaceutical treatments for stroke in a pre-clinical and clinical setting.

[1]. Greater understanding of the temporal evolution of
DWI under conditions of ischemia and revascularization
is important for accurate diagnosis and management of
stroke patients. Serial MRI studies performed in experimental rat stroke models have shown that the spatiotemporal progression of tissue injury after focal ischemia is
heterogeneous and differs between animals that revascularize and those that do not [2]. However, because

rodents have intrinsically different stroke evolution patterns than primates [3], serial studies using gyrencephalic
primates may potentially provide more representative
insight into human stroke [4]. A previous study on poststroke changes in T2 and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
found that lesion evolution after permanent and transient stroke in cynomologous macaques is more consistent with changes observed in human stroke patients,
compared to rodent stroke models [5]. In that study, differences in lesion evolution were investigated using volumetric analysis that may introduce bias from regional
tissue averaging, potentially obscuring local temporal
variations in lesion development [6, 7].
Several studies have demonstrated that voxel-based
cluster analysis can provide improved insights into the
local characteristics of regional tissue changes after
stroke [6–8]. Iterative self-organizing data analysis
(ISODATA) circumvents the need for substantial userinteraction and a priori specification of the number of
clusters by dynamically determining the optimal number
of clusters [6, 7]. ISODATA has been used to create tissue signatures that correlated with lesions on radiological
outcomes in human stroke and to histological outcome
in lissencephalic rodent stroke models [2, 8, 9]. Yet, the
utility of ISODATA for investigating gyrencephalic nonhuman primate stroke models for which histological
tissue outcome can confirm tissue injury or recovery
remains unexamined. This study, therefore, investigated
the evolutionary changes of diffusion and T2 MRI indices
after stroke in cynomologous macaques using a modified ISODATA analysis. The first aim of this study was
to identify unique temporal MRI patterns in the acute,
subacute, and chronic stages after stroke by combining
multiple MRI measures on a voxel-wise basis. The second aim focused on characterizing spatial and temporal
differences in T2 and DTI parameters between macaques
with transient versus permanent middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAo). The final aim of this study was to
compare the MRI-determined tissue signatures with
histopathology.

Results
Stroke model

Analysis was conducted on two macaques with permanent MCAo (pMCAo1, pMCAo2) and two macaques
with 3-h transient MCAo (tMCAo1, tMCAo2). For
three animals (two permanent and one 3-h transient
MCAo), spatially and temporally adjusted ISODATA
(ST-ISODATA) was used to combine serial DTI and
T2 data from approximately 1  h (1.33  ±  0.30  h), 2  h
(2.41 ± 0.44 h), 3 h (3.04 ± 0.44 h), 24 h (23.34 ± 1.57 h),
72 h (70.26 ± 1.54 h), 144 h (142.18 ± 1.83 h), and 240 h
(232.22 ± 9.92 h) after stroke onset. For the fourth animal

Page 2 of 13

(tMCAo2) ISODATA cluster analysis included MRI up
till 144  h, since T2 maps at 240  h were unavailable. For
“chronic” lesion volumes, the 17-day (406.98  ±  2.31  h)
T2 maps were used except for one animal (pMCAo2)
that died before the 17-day time-point; in that case the
10 days data was used instead.
Tissue classifications

In the permanent MCAo group, 48 % of the voxels with
abnormal tissue signature were assigned to the Core tissue class. 41  % of the voxels were initially normal but
became abnormal by 17  days (Growth). Recovery and
Edema areas comprised 4 and 7  % respectively of the
abnormal signature voxels. For the transient MCAo
group, the majority of voxels were assigned to the Edema
tissue class (58 %, P = 0.002), while the Core tissue class
was smaller (14 %, P = 0.07). Percentage-wise, there were
more Growth voxels in the permanent (41 %) than in the
transient MCAo group (14 %) (P = 0.10), whereas Recovery voxels made up a larger percentage of the transient
MCAo group (14 %) (P = 0.02).
ISODATA‑based tissue signatures

Figure  1 shows examples of tissue lesions as measured
with ADC and T2 across time for the four MCAo brains.
Figure 2 shows the measured lesion volumes across time
from all brains. Overlap (i.e. Dice Similarity Index DSI)
between the spatially and temporally adjusted ISODATA
(ST-ISODATA) identified lesions and ‘Maximal Lesion’
ROI was significantly different depending on the input
MRI-parameters used. Highest DSI was obtained with
a combination of ADC, FA, and T2 (DSI = 0.80 ± 0.17)
(Table  1). Therefore combined ADC, FA, and T2-based
ST-ISODATA was subsequently used with the minimum
number of voxels within a cluster (ΦN), the minimum
inter-cluster distance (ΦC), and the maximum allowed
intra-cluster dispersion (ΦS) set to 100, 0.98 ± 0.34, and
0.52 ± 0.03, respectively. This resulted in 12–17 clusters
that were identified for each brain. Subsequent coefficient of variance (CoV) pruning with a threshold of
0.05, the threshold with highest overlap between STISODATA identified lesions and ‘Maximal Lesion’ ROI
(DSI  =  0.80  ±  0.16), reduced the number of identified
clusters to 2–6 per brain. The resulting normalized ipsilateral clusters were pooled across brains, creating six
signatures with ranges 1–5 (Signature N), 6–15 (Signature I), 26–35 (Signature II), 36–45 (Signature III), 46–55
(Signature IV), or 56–65 (Signature V). No cluster values ranging from 16 to 25 or 66 to 100 were observed
and therefore signatures were not generated encompassing these cluster values. Signature N was consistent with unaffected tissue while the other five indicated
varying degrees of tissue abnormality corresponding to

datasets (a–d) from brains with permanent MCAo (I:

signatures.
The five identified abnormal signatures showed differences in the temporal evolution of relative ADC (rADC),
FA (rFA) and T2 (rT2) (P  =  0.002) (Fig.  4). Decreased
acute rADC were observed for Signature II, IV, and
V (P  <  0.001 versus Signature N), with largest rADC
decrease for Signature II and particularly V (P < 0.03 versus all other Signatures). Decreased rADC were followed
by a sharp increase in rADC in the first 24  h for Signature IV, whereas for Signature II rADC further decreased
(P = 0.05). For Signatures II and III, rADC was reduced
for at least 24 h before slowly increasing towards normal
values (Signature II: P  =  0.01 24  h versus 240  h; Signature III: P = 0.05 24 h versus 144 h). In the chronic phase,
Signatures I and IV showed a slow decrease, whereas
Signature V exhibited a progressive increase in rADC

(P = 0.02 24 h versus 240 h). Decreased values in acute
rFA were only observed for Signature V (P < 0.01 versus
Signature N). All signatures showed a decreasing trend in
rFA up until 144 h. After 144 h, rFA started to normalize in Signatures I and IV. For Signatures I and IV, rT2
increased until 144 h, after which a gradual decrease was
observed. Signature III displayed progressive increase in
rT2, until stabilizing at 72  h. The rate of increase in rT2
after 3  h was greater for Signature IV compared to the
other signatures (P  <  0.01), except for Signature V. For
Signatures II and V, rT2 progressively increased across all
time-points. However, rT2 values at 240 h differed statistically significantly from normal tissue only for Signature
V (P = 0.003).
The distribution of signatures differed between permanent and transient MCAo groups (P  <  0.0001). The
permanent MCAo group was primarily composed of Signatures II and III while the transient MCAo group consisted mostly of Signatures IV and V. For both transient
(P < 0.0001) and permanent MCAo (P = 0.006) groups,

MCAo brains (P < 0.0001), in the latter predominantly in
regions of Edema (49 %), and to lesser extent in regions
of Core (15 %) (P = 0.02), Growth (19 %) (P = 0.05) and
Recovery (17 %) (P = 0.03).

regions of ‘Maximal Lesion’ and were used for parameter optimization
of ST-ISODATA. pMCAo2 died before 408 h follow-up, the 240 h was
used as follow-up instead. tMCAo2 240 h T2 was not available

differed between the four tissue classes (Core, Edema,
Growth, Recovery) (Fig. 5a). In one brain (tMCAo1), Signature I was found almost exclusively within areas of
Edema (98.8  %), with some voxels in regions of Growth
(0.1  %) and Recovery (1.1  %) (Fig.  5b). Signature IV was
found in permanent but particularly in 3-h transient

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), luxol fast blue (LFB) and
myelin basic protein (MBP)-stained brain sections from
all cases were analyzed with particular attention given to
regions identified by Signatures I through V. Lesion characteristics from each available signature area from the
four brains are summarized in Table 2. Histopathological
alterations in the brain included extensive necrosis with
brain tissue loss and cavitation; axonal swelling; astrogliosis; edema and spongiosis; vascular proliferation;
and the presence of activated and foamy microglia/macrophages (gitter cells) with phagocytized necrotic debris.
In the permanent MCAo brains, Signature II was primarily found in gray matter (GM) areas (central, supra marginal and temporal gyri) and corresponded to the most
severe lesions with areas of extensive necrosis, tissue loss,
dead neurons, and gitter cells (Fig. 6I). Signature III was
detected solely in permanent MCAo brains in areas of
white matter (WM) (external capsule, and precentral and
temporal WM) and gray-white matter junctions (parietal and temporal cortices). These regions showed areas
of neuronal injury with features of degenerating neurons
and axons, but absence of gitter cells. Parietal temporal
WM was also affected in Signatures IV and V defined
volumes. Signature IV corresponded to a prominent border region between infarcted and surviving tissue with
vascular proliferation, spongiosis, and astrogliosis. These
histological changes were found in both permanent and
transient MCAo brains. Astrogliosis along with some
neuronal mineralization and edema were also observed
in Signature I, present in only one transient MCAo brain
(Fig. 6II).

Discussion
In this study, T2 and diffusion (ADC, FA) MRI indices
acquired at acute, subacute, and chronic stages after
stroke were combined on a voxel-wise basis to identify
unique spatiotemporal MRI profiles, and to determine
differences in stroke evolution after permanent or transient MCAo in non-human primates. The ST-ISODATA
approach identified six distinct tissue signatures, with
one signature consistent with non-ischemic normal tissue. The five other (abnormal) signatures showed substantial differences from this normal signature. These
abnormal signatures exhibited differences in tissue class
distribution and temporal profile depending on duration
of occlusion (permanent or transient) and level of neuronal damage.

induction (a), and 240 h follow-up T2 maps (b) of animals with permanent (I) or 3 h transient MCAo (II) are shown. For each animal the quantitative
maps from 1 h up to 240 h after MCAo were combined using a ST-ISODATA approach resulting in five abnormal signatures (c; overlaid on 240 h
follow-up T2 maps), that were consistent with regions of affected tissue on LFB-stained histological sections (red-outlined regions; d)

Despite its general use, the utility of single acute MRI
parameters like T2 or ADC for the prediction of tissue
infarction are still being debated [10–13]. As we have
demonstrated, using a single MRI parameter such as
ADC cannot reliably identify irreversibly damaged “core”
tissue, since tissue with decreased ADC may “recover”
at subsequent timepoints as a result of early reperfusion. The merits of using multiparametric MRI measures
on a voxel-wise basis have been previously illustrated in
rodent [2, 7, 9] and in human studies [14, 15]. Yet, previous histological validation of multiparametric MRIbased algorithms was primarily based on lissencephalic
rodent models [2, 9, 16] for which translation of findings
to human subjects are not straightforward [4]. Therefore recent guidelines recommend further validation
using higher order animals, e.g. non-human primates

as employed in this study, to improve insights based on
increased anatomic similarity with human brains [4].
Variations in temporal evolution of signatures classified as abnormal may inform on varying degrees of
neuronal damage [5, 10, 17–20]. Increased or decreased
acute FA values may be associated with different levels
of cell swelling in white or gray matter structures [17,
19, 21]. Alternatively, these FA alterations may reflect
initially preserved cytoarchitecture or increased extracellular space tortuosity as a result of cytotoxic edema
(observed as a reduction of rADC) that gradually
decayed as ischemia progressed towards tissue necrosis (manifested as increases in rADC) [19]. Regions of
relatively acutely increased FA were observed in areas of
cortical gray matter while decreased FA were primarily
observed in temporal and parietal white matter regions.

Future studies should extensively examine differences in
gray and white matter FA evolution after ischemia. The
differences in ADC pseudo-normalization and increased
T2 may have been accelerated by reperfusion. Reperfusion may reinstate energy metabolism and ion-pump
function effecting permanent or transient reversal of
ADC [12, 22, 23]. Alternatively flow restoration may
aggravate blood–brain-barrier disruption resulting in
vasogenic edema [17, 24]. Subsequent renormalization
of T2 (along with ADC and FA) in the more chronic
stages may most likely be associated with resolution of

edema [25]. However, it may also highlight areas with
delayed tissue damage [18] or more likely (in our case)
long-term tissue remodeling. Regions that exhibited
increased FA in chronic stages were also associated
with glial scar tissue. At early time-points, these same
regions typically showed reduced FA values, most likely
as a result of early edema from reperfusion. As edema
resolved, these reduced FA values renormalized, ultimately increasing to values above normal tissue, consistent with findings reported in chronic rodent stroke
models [26–28].

Fig. 5  Temporal tissue signature distributions. Percentage distribution of the temporal tissue signatures over the four tissue classifications (a) and the four tissue classes over the five abnormal signatures
(b). In the permanent MCAo group (N = 2), tissue classes consisted
predominantly of Signatures II and III, particularly depicting Core
and Growth types. Signature V was found only in the transient MCAo
group (N = 2). In this group the most prevalent signature across all
tissue classes was IV. The Edema type made up 99 % of Signature I
and 46 % of Signature IV in the transient MCAo group, but only 20 %
of Signature IV for the permanent group (P < 0.0001)

Cluster analysis may be affected by the quality of the
underlying data. Biologically induced deformations (like
edema) or imaging induced distortions (like residual
eddy current distortions or susceptibility artifacts) may
contribute to an increased number of (artefactual) clusters that may negatively influence subsequent analysis
[29]. In this study several pruning steps—including spatial contiguity constraints, CoV analysis, and advanced
(non-) linear registration—were employed to reduce
these potential artifacts. However, despite these efforts
not all artifacts could be resolved and therefore signature analysis was restricted to the ipsilateral parenchyma
only. It may be furthermore argued that CoV pruning and
the “intra-dataset” signature merging steps may oversimplify or obscure additional tissue profiles. Nevertheless,
we identified biologically interpretable MRI signatures

that corresponded with specific features of tissue damage as verified with histology and showed highest overlap
between ISODATA-segmented abnormal tissue regions
and the manually-defined ‘Maximal Lesion’ regions. Our
study was furthermore limited by retrospective analysis
of a small cohort of animals precluding generalization of
specific MRI tissue signatures heralding histological tissue damage. However, the scope of the current retrospective study is to analyze the MRI data with regard to size
and characterization of lesions. Future prospective studies should investigate histopathological changes in individual brains to assess the predictive value of these MRI
tissue signatures for infarct evolution and to compare
these changes with pre-specified cellular markers (e.g.
microglia, macrophages, leukocytes, astrocytes, blood
vessels) that could further inform about the potential origin of the observed diverse MRI signals. Abnormal cluster regions from brains with relatively large lesions (like
tMCAo1, pMCAo1) corresponded better with ‘Maximal Lesion’ regions than those with smaller lesions (like
tMCAo2) and possibly dominated clustering results. Subtle temporal changes that may occur with smaller tissue
lesions may as a result be obscured. Another limitation
is the relatively large field-of-view and low spatial-resolution that was used as a result of performing these studies
on clinical large bore scanners. Future studies using MRI
systems with higher gradient strengths and specialized
head coils would allow for acquisitions with higher spatial resolution [30]. Diffusion measures, and hence cluster
results, may also be improved with additional number of
gradient directions. In the future, multiparametric MRI
analysis should be validated on larger cohorts of animals
to establish robust categories of tissue signatures. This
may open opportunities for improved insights regarding
treatment-induced changes and provide an additional
tool for optimizing the translation of experimentally
obtained findings to human stroke applications.

Conclusions
This study highlighted the applicability and potential
of multiparametric MRI-based algorithms to identify
ischemic tissue sub-types and to further characterize
tissue progression after stroke in gyrencephalic brains.
Despite the limited number of animals included in this
study, the spatio-temporal assessment of MRI parameters
enabled us to distinguish distinct tissue evolution patterns that represented specific histological outcome.

Animal Care (SRAC), the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC) of our institution that follows
the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals. Unilateral stroke was
induced in seven adult male macaques (Macacca fascicularis, 7.7 ± 1.2 kg, 6–12 years old) by obstruction of the
M1 branch of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) either
by injection of a small volume of cyanoacrylate creating
a permanent MCAo (n  =  2), or by transient insertion
of a micro infusion catheter. The catheter was subsequently removed after 3 h to effect reperfusion for a transient MCAo model (n  =  5). Stroke induction followed
procedures previously described [31]. Briefly, animals
were sedated with diazepam (1 ml), then anesthesia was
induced with atropine (0.04  mg/kg, i.m.) and ketamine
(10  mg/kg, i.m.) and maintained either with isoflurane
(2–3  %) in a 80/20 air/oxygen mixture or with propofol
(300 µg/kg per hour, i.v.) in combination with remifentanil (0.1 µg/kg per hour, i.v.). Animals were mechanically
ventilated with 20  % oxygen in air mixture to maintain
end-tidal CO2 between 30 and 40 mm Hg, and physiological signs were monitored continuously.
Three 3-h transient MCAo group animals were
excluded from analysis because of incomplete occlusion

(N  =  1), extensive imaging artifacts (N  =  1), and MRI
scanner problems in the hyperacute stage after stroke
onset (N = 1).
MRI

Serial MRI data were acquired on a 1.5 T MRI scanner (GE
Signa) at 1 h intervals up to 6 h post-MCAo, and at 1, 3, 7,
10, 17, and 30 days. DTI (monopolar single-shot echo planar
imaging, repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) 8400/65.9 ms,
128 × 128 matrix, number of scans (NEX) 1, b-values of 0
(b0) and 1000  s/mm2 (6 directions), field-of-view (FOV)
200 mm, 3 mm slice thickness), and dual echo T2-weighted
MRI (fast spin echo, TR/TE1/TE2 4200/10.7/95.9 ms, echo
train length 16, 512  ×  512, NEX 2, FOV 200  mm, 2  mm
slice thickness, 0.5 mm slice gap) were obtained. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy
(FA) maps were calculated from eddy-current corrected
DTI datasets (MRVision, Winchester, MA, USA); T2 maps
were calculated from the T2-weighted images.

evidenced by the presence of numerous, large eosinophilic gemistocytes (thin arrows). Signature IV (II.b) corresponded with brain regions with vascular proliferation, spongiosis, and marked astrogliosis.

procedure. In the first step global alignment was achieved
using a full affine, mutual information based registration procedure (Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI),
Autoreg) [32]. In the second step, ventricular distortions, mid-line shifts, and sequence-induced distortions
were largely compensated for using a mutual information
based B-splines approach with a specialized cost function
that enforced rigid transformations for particular volumes of interest (VOI) [33]. This prevented local lesion
volume expansion or compression, effectively reducing
potential co-registration induced artifacts.
Before cluster analysis, surrounding muscle and skull
tissue was removed from the MRI (FMRIB Software
Library (FSL) Brain Extraction Tool) [34]. Tissue with
ADC values greater than 1.2  ×  10−3  mm2/s at the first
time-point, mostly arising from CSF and large vessels,
were excluded [2]. The resulting segmentation served as
a mask for the cluster analysis. Relative ADC (rADC), FA
(rFA) and T2 (rT2) maps were calculated by dividing each
map by its mean contralateral hemispheric value.
ISODATA cluster analysis

Temporal lesion evolution was assessed using a spatially and temporally adjusted ISODATA (ST-ISODATA)
approach [6, 7]. ST-ISODATA determined the number
of clusters (K) based on the underlying data rather than
by prior specification of the expected number of clusters. A detailed description of the original algorithm
can be found elsewhere [2, 9]. In brief, ISODATA is a
K-means related unsupervised segmentation algorithm
that automatically determines the number of clusters
used for segmentation by iteratively merging and splitting clusters based on intra- and inter-cluster dispersion terms. These terms—that include the minimum
number of voxels within a cluster (ΦN), the minimum
inter-cluster distance (ΦC), and the maximum allowed
intra-cluster dispersion (ΦS)—can be set prior to and
may allow for certain control over the segmentation process. For this study values for ΦC were derived by calculating the Mahalanobis distance between contra-lesional
white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM) [2, 14]. ΦS
was obtained by calculating the standard deviation of
WM values over all datasets within each brain. An initial guess of the number of clusters (k) was necessary to
initialize the algorithm. The initial k cluster means were
calculated using a semi-randomized approach where the
new cluster mean (µj) was chosen to be proportional to
a randomly selected fraction of the total distance to all
the previously selected cluster means [35]. K defined the
cluster range in which splitting and merging was allowed
and was defined as 0.5*K < K < (2*K + 1). At each iterative step, voxels were assigned to the clusters where the
Mahalonobis distance to the centroid (i.e. cluster mean)

Page 10 of 13

was smallest. Clusters with less than ΦN voxels were
discarded and their voxels were redistributed over the
remaining clusters based on their smallest relative distance. Subsequently, the intra-cluster distances (Dintra:
the average Mahalanobis distance between voxel vectors and the cluster centroid) and inter-cluster distances
(Dinter: the Mahalanobis distance between two cluster
centroids (µi, µj)) were calculated. When Dintra was more
than ΦS or Dinter was less than ΦC, clusters were split or
merged respectively. Subsequently, the cluster means
were recalculated and a new iteration was initiated provided the stopping criteria had not been met. Clustering
was completed when the algorithm converged or a maximum number of iterations (I) was reached. The stopping
and merging criteria were based on maximum number
of iterations (I), convergence error threshold (ɛr), and
number of merging steps per iteration (L). For this study
ΦN,k,K I, ɛr, and L were empirically derived and set to:
100, 6, 8, 100, 0.0001, and 1, respectively, to ensure convergence of the algorithm.
Additional spatial contiguity constraints were previously suggested to reduce the influence of noise and outliers on the ISODATA clustering results [2]. In this study,
ISODATA was extended with spatial contiguity constraints that for each voxel calculated the local neighborhood intensity homogeneity weighted by the distance of
the neighboring voxels to the voxel in the center prior to
ISODATA clustering [36]. For each animal’s MRI dataset,
a t x f feature matrix was created for each voxel (v)—for
which t represents the number of time points and f the
number of features per time point—and evaluated using
ISODATA. To further reduce temporal artifacts particularly at tissue boundaries, the resultant ISODATA maps
were pruned according to the amount of temporal dispersion measured using coefficient of variance (CoV) analysis. CoV was employed to reduce the influence of small
noisy fluctuations in MRI indices over time. Temporal
cluster dispersion was measured as the ratio between its
temporal standard deviation and its mean. A cluster with
dispersion above a pre-defined threshold was considered
abnormal; clusters with less dispersion were merged into
the normal tissue cluster.
Because the number of clusters identified may depend
on the data used for clustering and the order in which the
cluster values are assigned by ISODATA may vary per segmentation, the pruned maps were normalized using previously described techniques [16]. Pruned maps were scaled
by assigning the cluster matching the cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) region to 100 and the cluster matching the contralateral WM region to 1, the remaining clusters identified by
the algorithm were scaled to values between 1 and 100
depending on the difference of each cluster’s mean centroid
and those of the CSF or contralateral WM regions [16].

For group comparisons, global group evolution profiles
or signatures were obtained by binning in groups of 10
the normalized signatures within the ipsilateral hemisphere. Values below signature 5 were classified as a signature consistent with “normal”. Remaining signatures
were binned in steps of 10 and represented regions of
abnormal tissue signatures.
Statistical analysis

Region-of-interests (ROIs) were manually outlined
by two experienced researchers blinded to the ISODATA results. These manually delineated lesion volumes were enlarged with three 3-dimensional dilation
steps. Four tissue classes were operationally defined
as: ‘Core’, ‘Growth’, ‘Recovery’, or ‘Edema’. Voxels within
the 1-h ADC lesion that overlapped with the “chronic”
lesion outlined on the 17-day T2 map were used to
define ‘Core’ voxels. Voxels that did not overlap were
subdivided in voxels that were within the “chronic”
lesion, but not within the ‘Core’. These were defined
as lesion Growth voxels. Voxels included in the ‘Core’,
but not in the “chronic” lesion, were marked as lesion
Recovery regions. Areas of Edema were defined as voxels that appeared abnormal at the time-point for which
the maximum T2 lesion volume occurred (‘Maximal
Lesion’), but were normal at both the 1-h and 17-day
time points (Fig. 7). All remaining voxels were classified
as normal tissue.

Five combinations of input MRI-parameters were
considered: ADC, FA, T2, ADC  +  FA, ADC  +  T2, and
ADC + FA + T2. Additionally, CoV thresholds were varied from 0.1 to 0.01 with steps of 0.01 to determine the
threshold that resulted in highest overlap between calculated abnormal ST-ISODATA regions and the ‘Maximal
Lesion’ ROI. Overlap was calculated by subdividing the
clustered voxels in voxels that were correctly classified as
abnormal (TP); incorrectly classified as abnormal (FP);
incorrectly as classified normal (FN); or correctly classified as normal (TN) and expressed as Dice’s similarity
index (DSI  =  (2*TP)/(2*TP  +  FP  +  FN)) [37]. DSI of 1
represented excellent overlap, DSI of 0 no overlap.
Repeated measures one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with post hoc Tukey correction was used to
compare DSI of the ST-ISODATA models using the different MRI input parameters or CoV thresholds. Tissue
class volumes were compared using Chi Square test.
Repeated-measures ANOVA with post hoc Tukey correction was used to evaluate differences between temporal
signatures. Values are reported as mean  ±  SD. P  <  0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Histological brain tissue preparation and analysis

Animals were euthanized by an intravenous overdose of
sodium pentobarbital at 30  days post-stroke induction
with the exception of one animal that was sacrificed earlier (17 days) due to poor prognosis. Brains were removed

operationally defined as Core (d red); voxels abnormal at follow-up (c), but normal at the acute stage (a) were considered Growth areas (d: copper);
voxels abnormal in the acute stage (a), but normal at 17 days follow-up (c) represented Recovery regions (d.I: green); and voxels transiently abnormal

and fixed with 10 % formalin followed by gross sectioning
of the brains into 2.5 mm blocks, to match the MRI slice
thickness and orientation. Coronal blocks were embedded
in paraffin and consecutively sectioned into 6  µm thick
slices from the cut face throughout the entire lesion area.
Successive slices were stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E), myelin basic protein (MBP), and luxol fast blue
(LFB), scanned (Epson® Perfection 3170 Photo Scanner
Epson America, Miami FL, USA), and pictures digitally
stored. A template of the brain showing the boundaries
of the affected regions and the outline of the brain was
manually traced on the pictured sections. The stained sections were examined and rated by an experienced primate
neuropathologist. Histopathological tissue features within
abnormal MRI tissue signatures were assessed.
