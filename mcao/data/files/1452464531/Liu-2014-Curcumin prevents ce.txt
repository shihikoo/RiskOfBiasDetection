Abstract Curcumin is known to have neuroprotective
properties in cerebral ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury.
However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Recently, emerging evidences suggested that
increased mitochondrial biogenesis enabled preventing I/R
injury. Here, we sought to determinate whether curcumin
alleviates I/R damage through regulation of mitochondrial
biogenesis. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a 2-h
period of right middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by
24 h of reperfusion. Prior to onset of occlusion, rats had been
pretreated with either low (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal

of curcumin for 5 days. Consequently, we found that curcumin pretreatment enabled improving neurological deficit,
diminishing infarct volume and increasing the number of
NeuN-labeled neurons in the I/R rats. Accordingly, the index
of mitochondrial biogenesis including nuclear respiratory
factor-1, mitochondrial transcription factor A and mitochondrial number significantly down-regulated in I/R rats were
reversed by curcumin pretreatment in a dose-dependent
manner, and the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 presented
the similar change. Taken together, our findings provided
novel evidence that curcumin may exert neuroprotective
effects by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis.

Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability
worldwide. Nowadays, increasing treatments of acute

Neurochem Res (2014) 39:1322–1331

ischemic stroke with intravascular techniques and thrombolytic agents have significantly decreased functional deficits. However, reperfusion itself yielding excess
endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) results in
reperfusion injury [1–5]. Thus, effective prevention of
reperfusion injury is of great clinical value.
Curcumin, a polyphenols derived from powdered rhizome of C. longa Linn, is widely used as a dietary spice in
food in several Asian countries [6]. Previous studies
demonstrated that curcumin have neuroprotective properties in cerebral ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury [7].
Mechanisms underlying these neuroprotective properties of
curcumin remain poorly understood, although the molecular effects of its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory were
intensively reported [8–10].
Recently, accumulating evidences have shown that
mitochondria is a key target for cerebral I/R injury [11–14].
Correspondingly, some studies revealed that increased
mitochondrial biogenesis may exert neuroprotection [15,
16]. For example, adaptive mitochondrial biogenesis was
reported to contribute to the improvement of overall oxidative function and energy state of hypoxic-ischemic brain
[17]. In addition, Valerio et al. [18]. found that increased
mitochondrial biogenesis could help alleviating oxygen
glucose deprivation (OGD)-mediated neuronal impairment
and ischemic cerebral injury.
This research was designed to study whether curcumin
was capable of preventing I/R damage through regulation
of mitochondrial biogenesis. Mitochondrial transcription
factor A (TFAM) is a nucleus-encoded protein in charge of
maintaining mitochondrial DNA copy number [1]. The
expression of TFAM is controlled by nuclear respiratory
factors-1 (NRF-1), the transcriptional partner of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor c coactivator-1a that
regulates the entire mitochondrial biogenesis program [15].
Uncoupling protein 2(UCP2), an inner mitochondrial
membrane anion-carrier protein, is available to protect
neurons from cerebral ischemia injury through inhibition of
ROS generation and limitation of mitochondrial Ca2? [3].
Using measurements of mitochondrial transcription and
replication factors (NRF-1 and TFAM), mitochondrial
number and mitochondrial protein UCP2, we demonstrated
that mitochondrial biogenesis was increased in the middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) reperfusion model of
rats with curcumin in a dose-dependent manner.

Materials and Methods
Animal Experiment
All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of Chongqing Medical University.

1323

One hundred of twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats
weighing between 220 and 300 g were randomly divided
into four groups: sham-operated (n = 28), ischemia reperfusion (I/R) (n = 32), curcumin 50 mg/kg ? I/R (n = 32)
and curcumin 100 mg/kg ? I/R (n = 32). Rats were anesthetized initially with chloralic hydras (400 mg/kg, ip) to
perform preparative surgery. The MCAO model was performed according to the previous study [19]. Briefly, a
fishing thread with 0.234 mm in diameter was introduced
into the right external carotid artery and advanced into the
internal carotid artery for a length of 18 mm from the
bifurcation, where the origin of the middle cerebral arteryall
was blocked [8]. During anesthesia body temperature was
maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C with a thermostatic table. The
fishing thread was left in place for 2 h. After recovering of
consciousness, the rats were returned to the animal room for
postoperative recovery in individual cages,and sacrificed at
24 h after the fishing thread was withdrawn. For shamoperated animals, common carotid artery, external carotid
artery and internal carotid artery were just dissected from
connective tissue with no fishing thread inserted in.
Drug Treatment
100 mg curcumin (Sigma,USA) was dissolved in 1 ml of
dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma, USA). In drug groups, the rats
have been pretreated with either low (50 mg/kg, ip) or high
(100 mg/kg, ip) dose of curcumin for 5 days prior to the onset
of occlusion [7]. The other two groups were injected intraperitoneally with the same volume of dimethylsulfoxide.
Neurological Score
Neurological assessment was carried out after 30 min to
confirm successful MCAO and immediately before rats
were sacrificed after 24 h [7]. Neurological deficit was
scored on a 5-point scale [19]. No neurological deficit = 0,
failure to extend left paw fully = 1, circling to left = 2,
falling to left = 3, did not walk spontaneously and has
depressed levels of consciousness = 4.
Measurement of Infarct Volume
The brain tissues (n = 6) were immediately collected
while the rats were deeply anesthetized. The obtained brain
samples were frozen for 20 min at -20 °C, then sliced into
2-mm-thick coronal sections. The sections were stained
with 2 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma,
USA) for 30 min at 37 °C [20]. The white zone of sections
were considered as infarct areas. Sections were photographed using a digital camera (DSC-W320, Sony, Japan).
The infarct area in each coronal brain slice was measured
using Imagepro plus 6.0 analysis software (Media

123

1324

Neurochem Res (2014) 39:1322–1331

Cybernetics, USA). The infarct volume was calculated as
follows: 100 9 (contralateral hemisphere volume - nonlesioned ipsilateral hemisphere volume)/contralateral
hemisphere volume [21].
Detecting of Immunoreaction
General Tissue Treatment
All groups of rats were deeply anesthetized and intracardially perfused with 0.9 % saline followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde. The brain tissue samples were removed and
fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde overnight. The samples cut
from 3 to 7 mm backward of the antinion were embedded
in paraffin [22, 23], and coronally cut into 5 lm thick
sections.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
The immunostaining was performed as reported previously
[24]. Paraffin sections were dewaxed with dimethylbenzene and graded ethanol series. After heat induced epitope
retrieval, sections were processed through 0.3 % H2O2 for
15 min, and then 5 % bovine serum albumin for blocking
for 1 h. Sections were incubated with primary NeuN antibody (1:100, Millipore, USA) overnight at 4 °C, followed
by incubation with anti-rabbit secondary antibody
(Zhongshan Golden Bridge, Beijing, China) for 30 min at
37 °C. The immunoreactivity was visualized by treatment
with Dako Envision kit HRP. Finally, counterstaining was
carried out with hematoxylin. NeuN-positive immunoreactivity in the cortex was definite in the deeply brownstained cells, especially located at the nucleus. 15 random
visual field images for every sample were automatically
and semiquantitatively analyzed using the Imagepro plus
6.0 image analysis system (Media Cybernetics, America).
Immunofluorescence
The procedure of immunofluorescence was the same as
IHC on the first day while in the absence of incubation in
0.3 % H2O2. The primary antibody used was goat antiUCP2 N-terminus (1:25, Santa Cruz, USA). On the second
day, sections were incubated in dark place with fluoresceinconjugated affinipure rabbit anti-goat IgG (Zhongshan
Golden Bridge, Beijing, China) for 30 min at 37 °C. After
several washes, sections were coverslipped in 50 %

glycerol. Immunoreactivity was detected under laser
scanning confocal microscopy (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH, Germany) on an Olympus IX 70 inverted
microscope (Olympus, Japan).
Electron Microscopy Evaluation of Mitochondrial
Number
At 24 h after reperfusion, the animals were deeply anesthetized and intracardially perfused with 0.9 % saline followed by solution of 4 % paraformaldehyde mixed with
2.5 % glutaraldehyde in PBS. Peripheral penumbra of
infarct areas were cut into pieces about 1 mm3 and processed as described previously (Fig. 1) [23, 25]. Briefly, a
coronal section was cut from 3 to 7 mm backward of the
antinion, then a longitudinal cut (from top to bottom)
approximately 2 mm from the midline through the right
hemisphere. We then made a transverse diagonal cut at
about the ‘‘2 o’clock’’ position to separate the core from the
penumbra. To measure the mitochondrial number, 15 randomly selected penumbra areas per animal, which included
large neuronal-like nuclei covering about one-third of the
visible image, were photographed at 95,000 magnification
and counted according to the method described previously
with minor modifications (3 animals per group) [17].

Collection of Tissue Samples from the cortex
Animals were sacrificed at 24 h after reperfusion, and the
brain tissues were placed on a piece of gauze moistened
with ice-cold 0.9 % saline for the removal of the ipsilateral
cortex [22]. The collected samples were rapidly frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C before use.
RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription (RT): PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the specific cortex using
RNAiso Plus reagent (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). A
2–3 ll template RNA was adopted to synthesize the first
strand of cDNA using a reverse transcription kit (Takara
Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). PCR of cDNA was performed
(S1000TM Thermal Cycler, Bio-Rad, USA) using the

forward and reverse primer sequences provided in Table 1.
GAPDH served as an internal control, to the level of which
the amount of target mRNA was normalized.
Western Blotting Analysis
Total proteins of cortex were extracted and quantified by the
method of BCA with a protein assay kit (Beyotime, Jiangsu,
China). Western blot analysis was performed as previously
described [25]. Protein samples were subjected to 8 or 10 %
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electroblotting onto PVDF membranes. The primary antisera used
included: goat polyclonal antibody against UCP2 (1:100,
Santa Cruz, USA), rabbit polyclonal antibody against NRF-1
(1:100, Anbo Biotechnology,USA) or TFAM (1:100, Biovision, USA), or b-actin (1:3,000, 4A Biotech, Beijing, China).

(KeyGEN Biotech, Nanjing, China). The intensity of immunoblot bands was quantified using Quantity One image analysis (Bio-Rad, USA), and values were normalized to b-actin
in each sample.

Results
Assessing Neuroprotective Properties of Curcumin
Neurological deficit was initially evaluated at 30 min after
MCAO. Consequently, obvious neurological deficit was
observed in the MCAO rats, suggesting that the MCAO model
was successfully constructed. Due to severe cerebral infarction,
five rats were died within 24 h after MCAO. And then, the
neurological deficit was examined again at 24 h after MCAO.

123

Compared to the I/R group, high but not low dose of curcumin
could significantly lower the neurological scores (Fig. 2a). To
confirm the neuroprotective characteristic of curcumin, TTC
staining was used to visualize and quantify the infarct volume.
Therefore, we found that both low and high dose of curcumin
were capable of decreasing the infarct volume (Fig. 2b, c).
In addition, to further assess the effect of curcumin on
preventing neuronal death, the level of Neu-N in neurons of
cerebral cortex were tested by IHC. Compared to the shamoperated group, the number of Neu-N-positive neurons was
significantly decreased in the I/R group. The decrease of
Neu-N-positive neurons was partly reversed by either low
or high dose of curcumin (Fig. 3).
Effect of Curcumin on the Number of Mitochondria
The number of mitochondria in the peri-infarct region of
the cortex was quantified by electron microscopy. A

significant decrease of mitochondrial number was observed
at 24 h after ischemia reperfusion. Pretreatment with curcumin at the dose of 50 or 100 mg/kg could inhibit the loss
of mitochondria (Fig. 4).

To further validate this finding, the expression level of
mitochondrial protein was investigated. UCP2, which is one
of the members of mitochondrial transporter proteins [27],
is predominantly present in the cell cytoplasm [28].

Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis for UCP2
were detected in the cortex of the middle cerebral artery
distribution. Compared to sham-operated group, the UCP2
level was greatly decreased in the I/R group. The decrease
of UCP2 immunoreactivity was reversed by high but not
low dose of curcumin (Fig. 5a), yet in western blotting
analyses we found both low and high dose of curcumin
could inhibit the reducion of UCP2 protein. The amount of
UCP2 expressions in the two groups displayed statistically
significant difference (Fig. 5b).

We then investigated the changes in mitochondrial biogenesis so as to assess their possible contribution to the
curcumin-mediated neuroprotection. Both the mRNA and
protein levels of NRF-1 and TFAM were decreased in the
I/R group relative to the sham-operated group, which were
completely reversed by pretreatment with both low and
high dose of curcumin. The changes observed were in a

of NRF-1 did not show significant difference between low
and high dose groups (Fig. 6c). Regulation of NRF-1
mRNA has not, in some ways, been followed by the change
in protein expressions, suggesting possible posttranscriptional regulation of NRF-1 expressions.

Discussion
The present study showed that the curcumin had neuroprotective effects againt I/R injury. Correspondingly, we
observed that the indexs of mitochondrial biogenesis
(NRF-1, TFAM), mitochondrial number, and the

123

1330

mitochondrial protein UCP2, which were significantly
down-regulated in rats with I/R injury, were reversed by
curcumin pretreatment. Our findings provided the evidence
for the first time that increased mitochondrial biogenesis by
curcumin may be a pathway to preventing cerebral I/R
injury.
The neuroprotective mechanisms of curcumin in cerebral I/R injury remain in dispute. Yang et al. [29]. pointed
out that activition of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway by
curcumin was a key contributor to the cellular response to
neuronal ischemia injury, and that HO-1, along with other
phase II enzymes, served as a defense system against
oxidative stress. Curcumin could aslo decrease expressions
of NF-jB and ICAM-1 to alleviate inflammatory response
in cerebral I/R injury [9, 30]. Moreover, antiapoptotic
mechanisms of curcumin has been described in the inhibition of cerebral I/R injury. Zhao et al. [8]. claimed that
curcumin attenuated the downstream caspase activation of
apoptosis through increasing the mitochondrial levels of
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein and decreasing the subsequent
cytosolic translocation of cytochrome c. In another word, it
suggested that the mitochondrial pathway was an important
target for curcumin. Here, we found that curcumin was
capable of increasing mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby
providing neuroprotective effects against cerebral I/R
injury. This is not surprising since disruption of mitochondrial function plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of I/R injury [31], and mitochondrial biogenesis was
recognized as one kind of neuroprotective mechanisms [18,
32].
We found that the level of NRF-1 was increased by
curcumin in I/R injury, and NRF-1 has been taken for the
transcriptional partner of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor c coactivator-1a (PGC-1a) [33]. PGC-1a
has been usually described the initiate factor of mitochondrial biogenesis and could induce the gene expressions
of NRF-1 [18, 34], which was located at unique consensusbinding site of the TFAM gene [33]. The cooperative
actions of TFAM and NRF-1 integrate the transcription of
mtDNA with the expression of nuclear DNA-encoded
proteins related to oxidative phosphorylation, such as
mitochondrial UCP2 [33, 35–37]. These findings imply that
curcumin may stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis program
by activition of PGC-1a, and curcumin induced upregulation of PGC-1a was previously proved [38, 39]. Although
it has been verified that protective effects of curcumin on
cerebral ischemic injury were markedly attenuated by
GW9662, an inhibitor of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor c [39], the relationship between neuroprotection of curcumin and PGC-1a activated mitochondrial
recovery requires further study. Besides, we found that
curcumin enabled preventing the loss of mitochondria and
reversing the decrease of UCP2. Previously, Andrews et al.

123

Neurochem Res (2014) 39:1322–1331

[40]. have reported that it is in wild-type but not UCP2-/mice that ghrelin increased mitochondrial number in neuropeptide Y neuronal perikarya, suggesting that mitochondrial proliferation may be controlled by UCP2. Thus,
we propose UCP2 may be the direct cause of curcumin on
mitochondrial biogenesis.
In conclusion, the present research provided novel evidence that curcumin played neuroprotective effects on I/R
injury possibly by increasing mitochondria biogenesis. This
finding paves a way for development of a new therapeutic
target to treat cerebral ischemic stroke. Further studies
should be performed to explore the molecular pathway of
curcumin to promoting mitochondria biogenesis.
