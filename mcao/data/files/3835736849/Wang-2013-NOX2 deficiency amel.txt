Although NADPH oxidase (NOX)-mediated oxidative stress is considered one of the major mechanisms
triggering the pathogenic actions of ischemic stroke and very recent studies have indicated that NADPH
oxidase is a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production controlling glutamate release, how
neuronal NADPH oxidase activation is coupled to glutamate release is not well understood. Therefore, in
this study, we used an in vivo transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model and in vitro primary cell
cultures to test whether complexins, the regulators of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor
attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes necessary for vesicle fusion, are associated with
NOX2-derived ROS and contribute to glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in ischemic stroke. In this study,
we ﬁrst identiﬁed the upregulation of complexin II in the ischemic brain and evaluated its potential role
in ischemic stroke showing that gene silencing of complexin II ameliorated cerebral injury as evidenced
by reduced infarction volume, neurological deﬁcit, and neuron necrosis accompanied by decreased
glutamate levels, consistent with the results from NOX2  /  mice with ischemic stroke. We further
demonstrated that complexin II expression was mediated by NOX2 in primary cultured neurons
subjected to oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) and contributed to OGD-induced glutamate release
and neuron necrosis via SNARE signaling. Taken together, these ﬁndings for the ﬁrst time provide
evidence that complexin II is a central target molecule that links NADPH oxidase-derived ROS to
glutamate-mediated neuronal excitotoxicity in ischemic stroke.

Stroke is one of the most common pathologies and the second
leading cause of death in the world. Although considerable clinical
and animal model studies have implicated several mechanisms as
being involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, oxidative
stress is considered one of the major mechanisms triggering
the pathogenic actions of ischemic stroke [1,2]. In stroke,
ischemia-induced oxygen and nutrient deﬁciency leads to cellular
energy failure and neuronal damage. Moreover, rapid restoration
enhances the level of tissue oxygenation and accounts for a second
burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 generation, resulting in

reperfusion injury [3]. Although multiple enzymes contribute to
oxidative stress in various tissues or cells, recent studies have
demonstrated that NADPH oxidase is a major superoxide (O2  )producing enzyme in several types of cells in the brain, such as
neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, under pathophysiological conditions [2]. NADPH oxidase, originally found on leukocytes, consists of membrane subunits p22phox and gp91phox and cytoplasmic
subunits p47phox, p40phox, p67phox, and Rac GTPase. In the past few
years, a family of gp91phox-like proteins, termed NOX proteins, was
also discovered in mammals, denominated NOX1 to NOX5, dual
oxidase (DUOX) 1, and DUOX2 [4]. Although several NOX homologs are expressed in neuronal tissue and NOXs have been
documented to be involved in the pathogenesis of stroke [5],
current data provide evidence for NOX2 as the most important
NADPH oxidase mediating cerebral injury [6]. Mice with genetic
NOX2 ablation had smaller infarcts than wild-type (WT) littermates [7,8] and less blood–brain barrier damage in experimental
stroke [9]. The contributory role of NOX2 to the inﬂammatory
response accompanying stroke has been conﬁrmed in recent

Z. Wang et al. / Free Radical Biology and Medicine 65 (2013) 942–951

studies by the observation that mice deﬁcient in NOX2 had
decreased levels of proinﬂammatory mediators [10]. Recent studies have also implicated glucose as an important NOX substrate
leading to reperfusion injury and suggested that NOX inhibition
can improve the detrimental effects of hyperglycemia in stroke [11].
Other studies have observed that NOX inhibition ameliorates
complications of thrombolytic therapy by reducing blood–brain
barrier disruption, edema formation, and hemorrhage [5,12].
Preclinical trials using antioxidant treatments to scavenge ROS
failed to demonstrate efﬁcacy against oxidative stress exacerbated
by reperfusion. Antioxidants may interfere with the physiological
functions of ROS or may not reach the crucial target proteins of
ROS-induced cerebral injury. Therefore, achieving therapeutic
efﬁcacy in ischemic stroke is one of the biggest challenges in
translational neurobiology.
Glutamate-induced excitotoxicity has been recognized to play
an important role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke [13,14].
Physiologically, glutamate is released at presynaptic terminals by
fusion of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane, a process known as SNARE (soluble
N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor)
protein-dependent synaptic vesicle exocytosis [15,16]. Synaptic
vesicle fusion is driven by assembly of trans-SNARE complexes
from the membrane proteins, and some speciﬁc proteins have
been identiﬁed that are responsible for the regulation of SNAREmediated fusion. Among them, complexins are key regulators of
synaptic exocytosis for neurotransmitter release [17,18]. Studies
have indicated that complexin binds in an antiparallel α-helical
conformation to the groove between synaptobrevin and syntaxin
and stabilizes the interface between these two SNAREs that bears
the repulsive forces between the apposed membranes [19]. Complexins consist of four members (complexins I–IV) with approximately 120 residues that are evolutionarily conserved in all
animals and play critical roles in the control of fast synchronous
neurotransmitter release. Complexins I and II are highly expressed
in the brain, complexin III is most strongly expressed in the retina
and much less in the brain, and complexin IV is detectable only in
the retina [20,21]. However, whether complexins are involved in
the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke is unclear. Given that ROS can
modulate speciﬁc synaptic neurotransmission in the brain [22,23]
and excitatory amino acid release and free radical formation may
cooperate in the genesis of ischemia-induced neuronal damage
[24], the present study was designed to investigate whether the
regulation of complexins is associated with NADPH oxidasederived ROS and contributes to glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity
in ischemic stroke.

Materials and methods
Animals
NOX2  /  mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory
(Bar Harbor, ME, USA). All protocols were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Shandong University and conducted in accordance with the U.S. National
Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.
Model for transient focal cerebral ischemia
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was
induced in 12-week-old male NOX2  /  and WT mice as described
[25,26]. After 2 h of MCAO, the suture was carefully removed to
restore blood ﬂow. During and after the surgery, rectal temperature was controlled with a homeothermic blanket and kept at

943

37 1C until the complete recovery of the animal from the anesthesia.
After 24 h of reperfusion, the animals were anesthetized and then
decapitated. The sham groups were subjected to the same procedure
except for the occlusion of the MCA.
Neurological function assessment and infarct volume
Stroke outcomes were assessed at 24 h after reperfusion using
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA) staining and a ﬁve-tiered neurological scoring system as
described previously [25].
Morphological examinations
The ﬁxed brains were parafﬁn-embedded, and sections were
prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) or 0.1% (w/
v) cresyl violet (Sigma) to determine the neural morphology in the
cerebral cortex and hippocampus as described [27].
Primary cell cultures and treatments
Primary cortical neuron and astrocyte cultures were performed
as described previously [25,28]. Cells were subjected to the model
of oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) (1 h of OGD followed by 24 h
of reoxygenation) as described [29].
Recombinant lentivirus infection and stereotaxic injection in the brain
Recombinant lentivirus vectors harboring a short-hairpin RNA
(shRNA) sequence targeting NOX2 (LV-shRNA-NOX2) or complexin
II (LV-shRNA-complexin II) were produced by GenePharma Co. Ltd
(Shanghai, China) at a titer of 109 transfection units/ml. The DNA
target sequence for shRNA to complexin II (5′-GAAGAGCGCAAGGCCAAACAT-3′) was designed based on the core sequence of
mouse complexin II cDNA (Accession No. NM_009946.2); the
target sequence for shRNA to NOX2 (5′-GAGTGGTGTGTGAATGCCAGA-3′) was designed based on the core sequence of mouse NOX2
cDNA (Accession No. NM_007807.4). Neurons were infected with
lentivirus at day 6 in vitro at a multiplicity of infection of 20 in
complete medium containing Polybrene (5 μg/ml) and then subjected to OGD 4 days after infection (day 10 in vitro) as described
previously [30].
For in vivo gene silencing of complexin II, cortical injection of
LV-shRNA-complexin II or scramble was carried out by using
a stereotaxic instrument as described [31,32]. Each mouse
was subjected to three cortical injections as follows: point 1,
0.3 mm anterior to bregma, 3 mm lateral, 2 mm deep; point 2,
0.8 mm posterior to bregma, 3 mm lateral, 2 mm deep; point 3,
1.9 mm posterior to bregma, 3 mm lateral, 2 mm deep. All the
target points were in the right cortex within the MCAO territory.
The lentivirus suspension (0.7 μl) was injected at each point using
a 10-μl Hamilton syringe at a rate of 0.2 μl per minute, with an
additional 10 min wait before the needle was removed. Two weeks
after injection of lentivirus, the mice were subjected to MCAO as
described above.
Glutamate content measurements
Glutamate concentration in mouse brain homogenates or cell
supernatants was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using ODSC18 chromatographic columns (4.5 
150 mm, 5 μm, Varian, USA) in an HPLC system with a 2475 multiﬂuorescence detector (Waters, USA). The procedure was followed
as in previous studies [33]. β-Mercaptoethanol (Fluck, Switzerland),
O-phthalaldehyde (Sigma), and L-glutamic acid standard (Sigma)
were used in this study.

RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the brain or cells and mRNA levels
were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR using a Bio-Rad iCycler system
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) [25]. The speciﬁc primers for target
gene and housekeeping gene sequences are shown in Table 1.
Western blot analysis
Total cellular homogenate preparation and Western blot analysis were performed as described previously [34]. Antibodies to
complexins I, II, and III were from ProteinTech Group (Chicago, IL,
USA); antibodies to NOX2 and syntaxin were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). To document the loading controls, the membrane was reprobed with a primary antibody against the
housekeeping protein β-actin (ProteinTech Group).
Immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence
Immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescent staining were
performed as previously described [35]. Images were obtained by
confocal laser-scanning microscopy using an LSM780 laser scanning
confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a PlanApochromat 63  /1.4 objective. Images were assembled in the Adobe
Photoshop 7.0 software package.
Measurement of NADPH oxidase activity
NADPH oxidase activity was determined by measurement of
O2  production in brain or cell homogenates. Fluorescence
spectrometry for O2  production was performed by using a
modiﬁed dihydroethidium (Invitrogen) ﬂuorescence spectrometric
assay as described previously [25].

shows that the infarction volume at 24 h after reperfusion was
signiﬁcantly reduced in NOX2  / mice (19.3873.02%) compared
with WT mice (35.2573.36%), which was consistent with the
decreased neurological deﬁcit score (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, HE
staining was used to show morphological features of injured neurons
(Fig. 1C) and cresyl violet staining was used to examine the surviving
neurons (Fig. 1D) in ischemia-evoked neuronal injury. We found that
cerebral ischemia induced severe neuron necrosis, with shrunken
cytoplasm, pyknotic nucleus, and reduction of Nissl substance, which
was improved by NOX2 deﬁciency. Collectively, these results implicated the lack of NOX2 in reduced cerebral injury during ischemia.
NOX2 deﬁciency reduced glutamate release and complexin I and II
expression in ischemic stroke
To explore the role of NOX2 in neuronal excitotoxicity, we
measured the glutamate content in ischemic cerebral cortex homogenates. Consistent with previous studies [33], glutamate levels were
not signiﬁcantly different between WT and NOX2  / mice under
nonischemic (normal and sham-operated) conditions. However, NOX2
deﬁciency signiﬁcantly decreased the enhanced glutamate levels after
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (Fig. 2A), indicating that NOX2mediated glutamate release is activated under ischemic conditions.
We further found that both complexin I and complexin II levels were
signiﬁcantly increased in the brain from ischemic mice by real-time
RT-PCR (Fig. 2B) and Western blot (Fig. 2C) analyses, which were
markedly attenuated by NOX2 deﬁciency. However, the expression of
complexin III showed no signiﬁcant change. Our immunohistochemical studies also conﬁrmed the increased levels of complexin I and

complexin II in the ischemic hemisphere (Fig. 2D). Moreover, we
observed that complexin I was expressed only in neurons and
complexin II was expressed in both neurons and astrocytes (Fig. 2E).
The upregulation of complexin II in neurons (Fig. 2F) and astrocytes
(data not shown) was further conﬁrmed in ischemic stroke by
immunoﬂuorescence analysis. Considering that both neurons and
astrocytes are responsible for glutamate release [37], we investigated
mainly the regulatory mechanisms and functions of complexin II in
ischemic stroke.
Gene silencing of complexin II ameliorated cerebral injury
in ischemic stroke
To address the role of complexin II in glutamate-mediated
neuronal injury in ischemic stroke in vivo, we infused LV-shRNAcomplexin II into the right cortex of mice by stereotaxic injection.
Two weeks later, we induced ischemia in the right hemisphere by
MCAO and tested neurological outcome and infarct size at 24 h after
reperfusion. Fig. 3A shows the gene silencing efﬁciency of

complexin II in the right cortex of mice by stereotaxic injection.
We found that LV-shRNA-complexin II treatment signiﬁcantly
decreased infarct size (Fig. 3B) and neurological deﬁcit (Fig. 3C),
indicating an amelioration of ischemic injury. Moreover, the cerebral ischemia induced glutamate increase was markedly attenuated
by knockdown of complexin II (Fig. 3D). Although SNARE complex
proteins spontaneously assemble into a very stable ternary complex, which resists dissociation when dissolved in SDS, the ternary
SNARE complex is heat sensitive, and high-order oligomers can be
separated by SDS–PAGE under boiling conditions [38,39]. Therefore,
as shown in Fig. 3E, we observed that total syntaxin as deﬁned by
the levels of monomeric syntaxin ( 35 kDa) seen in boiled SDSextracted homogenates remained constant, but SNARE complex
formation ( 70 kDa) was signiﬁcantly increased in the brain
homogenates from ischemic mice, which was attenuated by complexin II knockdown as evidenced by the amounts of SNARE
complex in samples without prior heating. Taken together, these
data provide direct evidence for the contribution of complexin II to
SNARE-mediated glutamate release in cerebral ischemia injury.

Complexin II expression was mediated by NOX2 in primary
cultured neurons and astrocytes subjected to OGD
In an in vitro study, primary cultured cortical neurons and
astrocytes subjected to OGD were employed. Consistent with the
increased NADPH oxidase activity (Fig. 4A) and NOX2 expression
(Fig. 4B), OGD signiﬁcantly induced complexin II expression in
neurons (Fig. 4C). To further investigate the role of NOX2 on the
regulation of complexin II, NOX2 gene silencing was used in this
study. Our results showed that knockdown of NOX2 (Fig. 4D and E)
signiﬁcantly blocked OGD-induced complexin II expression (Fig. 4F),
indicating the contribution of NOX2 to the regulation of complexin

II in neurons. Similar results were also found in astrocytes (data not
shown).

NOX2-mediated complexin II expression contributed to OGD-induced
glutamate release and neuron necrosis
To further investigate the role of complexin II in glutamatemediated neuronal injury in vitro, a lentivirus vector harboring
shRNA targeting complexin II was used in this study. Our studies
showed that silencing of complexin II expression by LV-shRNAcomplexin II infection (Fig. 5A) blocked OGD-induced glutamate

Discussion
In this study, we identiﬁed for the ﬁrst time the upregulation
of complexin II in the ischemic brain and evaluated its potential
role in ischemic stroke, showing that gene silencing of complexin
II ameliorated cerebral injury. We further demonstrated that

NOX2-mediated complexin II signaling contributed to glutamate
excitotoxicity in ischemic stroke (Fig. 6).
As an important excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate is
physiologically released at presynaptic terminals by a process
known as SNARE-dependent synaptic vesicle exocytosis [40] and
plays a pivotal role in acute neurological disorders including
stroke, trauma, and neurodegenerative disease [41]. Increased glutamate levels during cerebral ischemia with excessive neurological
stimulation cause the glutamate-induced neuronal excitotoxicity,
leading to activation of many cellular signaling cascades [42],

ultimately resulting in cerebral injury. Pharmacological targeting of
glutamatergic pathways may help design a new approach to developing therapeutic strategies for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
However, there are currently no pharmacological interventions
targeting glutamate receptor blockers capable of providing signiﬁcant neuroprotection in the clinical setting of cerebral ischemia or

injury. Therefore, efforts have been made to attach glutamate in
earlier stages by inhibition of synthesis or release.
Although very recent studies have indicated that NADPH
oxidase is a major source of ROS production controlling glutamate
release and associated behavioral alterations after acute ketamine
exposure [33], how neuronal NADPH oxidase activation is coupled

to glutamate release is not well understood. In this study, one of
the most important ﬁndings is that we discovered the role of
complexin II in NADPH oxidase-mediated glutamate release and
consequent glutamate-induced neuronal excitotoxicity in ischemic
stroke. Complexins are important SNARE-modulating proteins that
bind reversibly to the SNARE complex consisting of the vesicle
protein synaptobrevin and the plasma membrane proteins syntaxin and SNAP25, thereby become part of the synaptic release
apparatus, which makes vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane
[43]. Recent studies have indicated that inhibition of the SNARE
pathway attenuated damage after stroke [44,45]. Evidence has also
shown that complexins are anchored on the SNARE complex and
then activate and clamp SNARE complexes to regulate neurotransmitter release [17,46]. Genetic elimination of complexins from
mammalian neurons causes a strong reduction in evoked neurotransmitter release, and altered complexin expression levels with
consequent deﬁcits in synaptic transmission were suggested to
contribute to the pathogenesis of Huntington disease, Parkinson

disease, Alzheimer disease, and traumatic brain injury [47]. However, it remains unclear whether complexins are associated with
cerebral ischemia injury. In this study, we found that cerebral
ischemia caused a signiﬁcant increase in complexin I and II
expression in the damaged cerebral cortex accompanied by
enhanced glutamate release and neuronal damage, which was
attenuated by NOX2 deﬁciency, indicating the role of NOX2 in the
regulation of complexins in ischemic stroke. Further results
showed that complexin I was expressed only in neurons and
complexin II was expressed in both neurons and astrocytes.
Although neurons are far more susceptible to ischemic damage
than neighboring astrocytes and the main victims suffering from
glutamate-induced neurotoxic injury, astrocytes can also release
vesicles that contain glutamate, which has a variety of actions on
neurons, many of them relevant to ischemic brain damage [37]. In
addition, it has been reported that complexin I is predominantly
detected in axosomatic terminals, which are presumed to be
inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acidergic, whereas complexin II is
selectively enriched in axospinal and axodendritic presynaptic
terminals, which are mostly excitatory glutamatergic [48]. Therefore, considering that complexin II is expressed in both neurons
and astrocytes and is mainly localized in excitatory synapses [49],
we focused on the role of complexin II in ischemic stroke in this
study. To examine whether gene silencing of complexin II protects
against cerebral ischemia injury, we generated a lentiviral vector
harboring shRNA targeting complexin II and infused it into the
cortex of mice before induction of ischemia by MCAO and found
that LV-shRNA-complexin II treatment signiﬁcantly ameliorated
ischemic cerebral injury as evidenced by decreased infarct size,
neurological deﬁcit score, glutamate release, and SNARE complex
formation, supporting the role of complexin II in the pathogenesis
of ischemic stroke.
To further conﬁrm the contribution of NADPH oxidase–complexin II signaling to the regulation of glutamate-induced

neurotoxic injury, primary cortical neuronal cultures were performed in this study. In vitro, we found that the expression of
NOX2 and NADPH oxidase activity were dramatically increased by
OGD. The expression of complexin II was signiﬁcantly increased
together with glutamate release, which was attenuated by NOX2
knockdown. These results add further evidence to support the
essential role of complexin II in mediating NOX2-induced glutamate release in ischemic stroke. It should be noted that the
present study did not further explore the regulatory mechanisms
of complexin II expression by NADPH oxidase activity; further
studies need to address this issue.
Taken together, these ﬁndings for the ﬁrst time provide
evidence that complexin II, as a central target molecule, links
NADPH oxidase-derived ROS to glutamate-mediated neuronal
excitotoxicity in ischemic stroke. Pharmacological targeting of
NOX2-mediated glutamate signaling pathways via complexin II
at multiple levels may help design a new approach to developing
therapeutic strategies for prevention of deterioration of cerebral
function and for the treatment of acute neurological disorders
including stroke, trauma, or other neurodegenerative diseases.
