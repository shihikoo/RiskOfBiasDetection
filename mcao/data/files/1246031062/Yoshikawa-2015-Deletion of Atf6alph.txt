Abstract
To dissect the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and
unfolded protein response in brain ischemia, we investigated
the relevance of activating transcription factor 6a (ATF6a), a
master transcriptional factor in the unfolded protein
response, after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) in mice. Enhanced expression of glucose-regulated
protein78, a downstream molecular chaperone of ATF6a,
was observed in both neurons and glia in the peri-infarct
region of wild-type mice after MCAO. Analysis using wildtype and Atf6a/ mice revealed a larger infarct volume and
increased cell death in the peri-ischemic region of Atf6a/
mice 5 days after MCAO. These phenotypes in Atf6a/

mice were associated with reduced levels of astroglial
activation/glial scar formation, and a spread of tissue
damage into the non-infarct area. Further analysis in mice
and cultured astrocytes revealed that signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-glial ﬁbrillary acidic
protein signaling were diminished in Atf6a/ astrocytes. A
chemical chaperone, 4-phenylbutyrate, restored STAT3-glial
ﬁbrillary acidic protein signaling, while ER stressors, such as
tunicamycin and thapsigargin, almost completely abolished
signaling in cultured astrocytes. Furthermore, ER stressinduced deactivation of STAT3 was mediated, at least in
part, by the ER stress-responsive tyrosine phosphatase, TCPTP/PTPN2. These results suggest that ER stress plays

Stroke is a major cause of death and long-lasting disability
in the most industrialized countries. Brain damage after
cerebrovascular occlusion occurs through both ﬂow-dependent and -independent mechanisms (Hossmann 2006;
Amantea et al. 2009). A few minutes after the onset of
ischemia, brain damage starts in the center of the ischemic
region, or the ischemic core. At this stage, cell death is
caused by acute energy failure and loss of ionic gradients
associated with permanent and anoxic depolarization (Hossmann 1994; Dirnagl et al. 1999). A few hours later, the
infarct area starts to expand into the bordering zone,
penumbra, in which energy metabolism is partially preserved. Several pathways such as excitotoxicity, organelle
dysfunction, and intracellular stress may be included in this
step. Further brain damage is observed days to weeks after
ischemia through vasogenic edema and inﬂammation. In
contrast to the vulnerability of neurons, astrocytes, the most
abundant glia in the brain, can survive and become
activated after brain ischemia. Highly activated astrocytes
form a barrier, the so-called glial scar, in the bordering zone
that restricts inﬂammation and brain damage within the
barrier (Sofroniew 2009).
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is characterized by the
accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, and occurs in
many pathophysiological conditions such as ischemia,
impairment of protein modiﬁcation, disturbance of Ca2+
homeostasis, and production of a large amount of proteins
in the ER. Eukaryotic cells respond to ER stress by
activating a set of pathways known as the unfolded protein
response (UPR) (Walter and Ron 2011). In mammals, the
UPR is transmitted through three types of sensor proteins:
Protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase
(PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1a (Ire1a), and activating transcription factor 6a (ATF6a) (Walter and Ron 2011).
Downstream molecules of Ire1a and ATF6a include
molecular chaperones in the ER, such as glucose-regulated
protein78 (GRP78), and oxygen-regulated protein 150
(ORP150), and ER-associated degradation molecules such
as Derlins, and homocysteine-inducible endoplasmic reticulum stress protein (Herp). In contrast, PERK activation
induces the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of
eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2a), which
suppresses general protein synthesis to reduce protein loads
into the ER, and activating transcription factor 4, which
up-regulates the expression of heme oxygenase 1 and

C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) (Lewerenz and Maher
2009).
Ours and other groups have reported that brain ischemia
causes ER stress and UPR activation both in human
postmortem brains and rodent stroke models, the latter
including both transient and permanent middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) models (Tamatani et al. 2001;
DeGracia and Montie 2004; Morimoto et al. 2007). We have
also reported that both of GRP78 and OPR150 are upregulated in cultured astrocytes exposed to hypoxia, and that
over-expression of ORP150 in neurons increased neuronal
survival after brain ischemia in mice (Tamatani et al. 2001).
Compounds such as the chemical chaperone Sodium 4phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) and UPR activator immunoglobulin
heavy-chain binding protein (BIP) inducer X (BIX), both of
which can ameliorate ER stress, have also been demonstrated
to protect cortical neurons against brain ischemia in mice (Qi
et al. 2004; Kudo et al. 2008). However, it is not yet clear
whether the neuroprotective effect of the UPR against brain
ischemia is mediated through cell-autonomous or non-cellautonomous mechanisms.
To expand our understanding of the role of the UPR in
brain ischemia, we initiated this study by estimating the
status of UPR activation after permanent MCAO in wild-type
mice. We then compared stroke size, neuronal death, glial
activation/scar formation between wild-type and Atf6a/
mice. Finally, we analyzed the impact of ER stress on
astroglial activation using cultured astrocytes. Our data
indicate that ER stress impedes astroglial activation/scar
formation by suppressing signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3)-Glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) signaling, and enhances neuronal death and stroke
volume after brain ischemia.

dependent deacetylation (Kimura et al. 2012). In our model,
tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors such as orthovanadate and
bpV, but not a HDAC inhibitor, TSA, or Sirt1 inhibitor,
Ex527, enhanced levels of p-STAT3, and Gfap in both of
normal and Tm-treated conditions (Fig. 7a and b). There are
several PTPs expressed in astrocytes and/or C6 astroglioma
(Navis et al. 2010), and some, such as PTP1B/PTPN1 and
TC-PTP/PTPN2, are located, at least partly, in the ER. In our
model, Ptpn2 had the strongest response to ER stress (Fig. 7c
and d), and knockdown of Ptpn2, but not other genes,
enhanced the level of p-STAT3 in all conditions tested
(Fig. 7f).
TC-PTP/PTPN2 is a ubiquitously expressed, non-receptortype PTP that has a similar structure to PTP1B/PTPN1
(Navis et al. 2010). Two protein isoforms, TC45 and TC48,
are generated by alternative splicing (Mosinger et al. 1992).
TC45 is located in the nucleus, and regulates diverse
signaling molecules including STAT3 (Muppirala et al.
2013). TC48, in contrast, is anchored to the ER membrane
using its hydrophobic carboxyl terminus, and may function
in a secretory pathway (Muppirala et al. 2013). Our results
indicate that both of TC45 and TC48 are expressed in
astrocytes, and are up-regulated by ER stress, although the
expression level may be higher in TC45 (Figure S2), as
previously described (Mosinger et al. 1992). Further crude
cell fractionation analysis revealed that not only T48 but also
the majority of T45 was observed in the microsome fraction
in our system (Fig. 7e), suggesting that TC45 may be
recruited to some type of membrane in the secretory
pathway. It has been reported that the expression of
PTP1B/PTPN1, but not TC-PTP/PTPN2, is increased by
ER stress in pancreatic b cells (Beamer et al. 2006). The
discrepancy with our results may be attributed to the duration
of ER stress (days vs. hours) and the cell types (pancreatic b
cells vs. astrocytes). At this moment, we do not exclude the
possibility that other PTPs, such as SHP-1, may also play
important roles in regulating astroglial and microglial
activation, as previously described (Hashida et al. 2012).
Further studies will be required to clarify the roles of TCPTP and other PTPs in diverse neuropathological situations,
including Parkinson’s disease, in which we also observed
reduced astroglial activation in Atf6a/ mice (Cheng et al.
2002). It will also be intriguing to test the effect of PTP
inhibitors on astroglial activation and neuroprotection in
vivo.
It has been reported that both PTP1B and TC-PTP play
critical roles in the insulin and/or leptin resistance through
the suppression of STAT3 pathway (Zabolotny et al. 2002;
Fukushima et al. 2010). As astrocytes also contribute to
energy homeostasis in the brain both in normal and
pathological conditions, it would be important to ﬁnd the
role of these PTPs in the insulin/leptin signaling in
astrocytes. Analysis of PTPs in astrocytes will provide new

insight into the research of stress response and neuronal
death in the central nervous system.

Activation of the UPR after MCAO
We ﬁrst analyzed the activating status of the UPR in our stroke
model, in which the left MCA is permanently coagulated in
mice (Taguchi et al. 2004). qRT-PCR analysis revealed
enhanced mRNA expression in several UPR-target genes
such as Hspa5 and Hyou1, which encode molecular chaperones in the ER, GRP78, and ORP150, respectively, and Ddit3,
which encodes a cell death-related molecule, CHOP, 8–24 h
after MCAO (Fig. 1a). Western blot analysis conﬁrmed the
enhancement of GRP78 and CHOP protein levels 2 days after
MCAO (Fig. 1b), suggesting that the effect of UPR activation
may continue from the acute (hours) to subacute (days) phase
after MCAO. Further immunohistochemical analysis revealed
up-regulation of GRP78 expression in the border between the
infarct and non-infarct area after MCAO (Fig. 1c ii). In the
control condition (sham operation), a moderate level of
expression of GRP78 was observed in NeuN-positive cortical
neurons, but not in glial cells. In contrast, 1–3 days after
MCAO, enhanced expression of GRP78 was observed both in
neurons, GFAP-positive astrocytes, and Iba1-positive
microglia/macrophages. In our model, UPR activation occurs
earlier in astrocytes (24 h after MCAO) than in microglia/
macrophages (72 h after MCAO).
Enhanced infarct size and cell death in Atf6a/ mice after
MCAO
To evaluate the neuroprotective role of the UPR in the
MCAO model, we analyzed infarct volume (Fig. 2a) and cell
death (Fig. 2b), using TTC staining and immunohistochemistry against ssDNA, respectively. Although there were no
signiﬁcant differences in TTC staining between wild-type
and Atf6a/ mice until 3 days after MCAO, the latter mice
displayed a larger infarct volume than the former
(15.5  2.1 mm3 and 23.2  6.6 mm3, respectively) 5 days
after MCAO (Fig. 2a). Consistent with these results, ssDNApositive apoptotic cells or FJC-positive neurodegenerative
cells were restricted to the infarct area in wild-type mice
5 days after MCAO, while they were extended to the periinfarct area in Atf6a/ mice (Fig. 2b, Figure S1c). Importantly, glial scar formation in Atf6a/ mice was less obvious
than in wild-type mice (Fig. 2b). Further analysis revealed
that the majority of ssDNA-positive cells in the border
regions of Atf6a/ mice were NeuN-positive neurons, while
some of those are GFAP-positive astrocytes (Figure S1b).

shown are the mean  SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, signiﬁcantly different between 2 conditions (n = 4). Scale bars = 1 mm (a), 20 lm (b).

Impaired astroglial activation in Atf6a/ mice after MCAO
As the UPR was activated both in neurons and glial cells
(Fig. 1c ii), and glial scar formation in Atf6a/ mice was
less obvious than in wild-type mice (Fig. 2b), we hypothesized that glial activation, which could strongly inﬂuence
neuronal survival/death, may be affected by deletion of Atf6a
gene. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that hypertrophic, GFAP-positive astrocytes were accumulated at the
border between infarct and non-infarct area 3 days after
MCAO in wild-type mice. In contrast, this astroglial
accumulation was less observed in the same condition in
Atf6a/ mice (Fig. 3a i). Interestingly, the size of each
astrocyte was smaller in Atf6a/ mice, while the number
was not signiﬁcantly different between wild-type and Atf6a/

mice (Fig. 3a ii), suggesting that deletion of Atf6a gene

may impair hypertrophic change, rather than proliferation of
astrocytes after MCAO. In this period, the size and number
of Iba1-positive microglia was not signiﬁcantly changed in
both genotypes (Fig. 3a iii). Five days after MCAO, the size
of each astrocyte was still smaller in Atf6a/ mice, when
compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 3b i, ii). In addition, the
number of Iba1-positive microglia/macrophages was somewhat lower in Atf6a/ mice when compared with wild-type
mice (Fig. 3b i, iii). Consistent with the lower levels of
astroglial activation/glial scar formation, the 3-nirotyrosine
(3-NT)-positive area, which is a marker of oxidative stress
and tissue injury, was expanded into non-infarct areas in
Atf6a/ mice 5 days after MCAO (Fig. 3c).
To conﬁrm the reduced levels of astroglial activation in
Atf6a/ mice after MCAO, western blot analysis was
performed using samples of ipsilateral (I) and contralateral
(C) cortex in both genotypes. As early as 2 days after
MCAO, the expression of marker proteins for astroglial
activation such as phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) and
GFAP (Okada et al. 2006; Herrmann et al. 2008) was lower
in the Atf6a/ ipsilateral cortex when compared with
wild-type ipsilateral cortex, and this lasted until 5 days after

MCAO (Fig. 4a–c). The expression of GRP78 was lower in
both of ipsilateral and contralateral cortex of Atf6a/ mice
when compared with wild-type mice between 2 and 5 days
after MCAO (Fig. 4a–c). In contrast, the expression of
CHOP, which is mainly regulated by PERK pathway, was
not different between wild-type and Atf6a/ mice 2 days
after MCAO (Figure S2a). The expression of Iba1, a
common marker of microglia/macrophages, was not significantly different between two genotypes until 3 days after
MCAO, and expression became lower in the Atf6a/ipsilateral cortex 5 days after MCAO (Fig. 4a–c), which was
consistent with the result of immunohistochemistry result
(Fig. 3b i, iii). These results collectively suggest that deletion
of the Atf6a gene affects astroglial activation at relatively
early stages following ischemic injury.
Reduced STAT3 signaling in Atf6a/astrocytes after MCAO
Several cytokines and growth factors that are secreted from
damaged neurons or other cells in the brain can induce
astroglial activation, predominantly through the STAT3GFAP pathway (Okada et al. 2006; Herrmann et al. 2008).
Therefore, we examined the expression level of these genes

there was no difference between two genotypes (Fig. 5a).
The expression of (transforming growth factor) TGFb
(Tgfb1) (Fig. 5a) or ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)
(Cntf) (data not shown) was not signiﬁcantly enhanced after
MCAO in either genotype. Consistent with these results,
western blot and ELISA analysis revealed that there was no
signiﬁcant difference in the expression of LIF (Fig. 5b) or
IL-6 (Fig. 5c) between wild-type and Atf6a/ mice after
MCAO. Further immunohistochemical analysis revealed that
IL-6 was mainly produced in damaged neurons in these
periods (Figure S2b). In contrast, the activating status of
STAT3, which was determined by the level of p-STAT3, was
lower in Atf6a/ mice when compared with wild-type mice
1 day after MCAO (Fig. 5b), suggesting that the reduced
level of astroglial activation in Atf6a/ mice is associated
with impaired signaling pathways in astrocytes.
Impaired STAT3-GFAP signaling in Atf6a/ and ER stressexposed astrocytes
To conﬁrm the impairment of activation-related signaling
pathways in Atf6a/ astrocytes, we employed cultured
astrocytes isolated from the cerebral cortices of neonatal

wild-type and Atf6a/ mice. After serum deprivation for
8 h, cells were stimulated with FSK or IL-6 for 30 min.
Western blot analysis revealed that p-STAT3 was detected in
the normal condition in wild-type astrocytes, consistent with
a previous report showing that cultured astrocytes are at least
partially activated without stimulation (Zamanian et al.
2012). p-STAT3 expression was enhanced to 140% and
170% by FSK and IL-6 treatment, respectively (Fig. 6a,
white bars). In contrast, the level of p-STAT3 in Atf6a/
astrocytes was signiﬁcantly lower in both of control and
stimulated conditions (approximately 40, 65, and 65% when
compared with wild-type astrocytes in normal, FSK-stimulated, and IL-6-stimulated conditions, respectively) (Fig. 6a,
black bars). Consistent with these results, the expression of
Gfap was lower in Atf6a/ astrocytes when compared with
wild-type astrocytes (Fig. 6b). To analyze the role of ER
stress in the reduced activation of the STAT3/GFAP pathway
in Atf6a/ astrocytes, cells were treated with the chemical
chaperone 4-PBA for 8 or16 h. 4-PBA is often used for
attenuating ER stress (Qi et al. 2004; Kimura et al. 2012).
Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses revealed that 4-PBA
enhanced the level of p-STAT3 and Gfap in both wild-type
and Atf6a/ astrocytes in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 6c
and d). In contrast, when wild-type astrocytes were treated
with common ER stressors, such as Tm and Tg, the

expression of p-STAT3 and Gfap was almost completely
abolished (Fig. 6e and f). These results suggest that ER stress
strongly suppresses STAT3-mediated astroglial activation.
Involvement of TC-PTP in the impaired STAT3-GFAP
signaling in ER stress-exposed astrocytes
To dissect the mechanism underlying the ER stress-mediated
impairment of STAT3-GFAP signaling in astrocytes, we
treated wild-type astrocytes with several compounds which
are known to regulate p-STAT3 expression (Kimura et al.
2012), in the presence or absence of Tm. Orthovanadate
(Vana), a broad PTP inhibitor, dose-dependently enhanced
expression of p-STAT3 in both normal and ER stress
conditions (Fig. 7a). Similarly, bisperoxovanadium (bpV), a
more potent PTP inhibitor, strongly enhanced expression of
p-STAT3 in the presence of Tm (Figure S2a). In contrast, the
HDAC 1 inhibitor, TSA, or Sirt1 inhibitor, Ex527, did not
enhance expression of p-STAT3 in the same condition
(Figure S2a). These results suggest that PTPs may play an

important role in the regulation of STAT3 signaling in
astrocytes. Consistent with these results, the expression of
Gfap was enhanced by Vana under ER stress condition
(Fig. 7b).
Previous reports have demonstrated that several PTPs,
such as PTP1B/PTPN1, TC-PTP/PTPN2, SHP1/PTPN6, and
SHP2/PTPN11, are expressed in astrocytes and/or C6
astroglioma (Faure and Posner 1993; Servidei et al. 1998;
Horvat et al. 2001). Therefore, we hypothesized that PTPs
may be critical for regulating STAT3-GFAP signaling in
astrocytes both in normal and under ER stress. qRT-PCR
revealed that Ptpn2, and to a lesser degree Ptpn1, were upregulated by both Tm and Tg (Fig. 7c), suggesting a possible
association with these genes and ER stress. As there are two
protein isoforms, TC45 and TC48, in TC-PTP/PTPN2, we
analyzed whether both isoforms respond to ER stress.
RT-PCR with isoform-speciﬁc primers revealed that expressions of both TC45 and TC48 are enhanced by ER stressors,
although the expression level may be higher in TC45 (Figure

S2). In contrast, expression of Ptpn6 was slightly enhanced
by Tg, but suppressed by Tm (Fig. 7e), and that of Ptpn11
was not enhanced by Tm or Tg (Fig. 7c). Suppressor of
cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) is also a potent endogenous
regulator of STAT3; therefore, we measured expression of
Socs3 in cultured astrocytes. qRT-PCR revealed that Socs3
was not induced by Tm or Tg in our model, but its expression
level was reduced by Tm (Fig. 7d). At protein levels, western
blot analysis using samples after crude cell fractionation
revealed that TC-PTP/PTPN2 was located in the microsome
fraction and, to a lesser extent, in the nucleus fraction
(Fig. 7e). The expression of TC-PTP/PTPN2 was enhanced
by Tm in both fractions (Fig. 7e). In contrast, PTP1B/PTPN1
was located exclusively in the microsome fraction, and its
expression did not changed by Tm (Fig. 7e).
To conﬁrm the suppressive effect of PTPs on the STAT3
activation, gene-silencing experiments were performed using
wild-type and Atf6a/ astrocytes. Two independent siRNAs
per gene were introduced, and cell lysates were analyzed by
western blot (Fig. 7f). Knockdown of Ptpn2 signiﬁcantly
enhanced expression of p-STAT3 in both normal and ER
stress conditions (Fig. 7f). However, knockdown of other
Ptps (Figure S2b) or Socs3 (data not shown) failed to
enhance the expression of p-STAT3. In these gene-silencing
experiments, the expression of each gene was reduced to less
than 20% of control levels (Fig. 7f and Figure S2b).

Discussion
In this study, we have demonstrated that deletion of Atf6a
gene increases infarct volume and neuronal death in the periinfarct region after MCAO in mice. These phenotypes in
Atf6a/ mice were associated with reduced astroglial
activation/glial scar formation and a spread of tissue damage
into the non-infarct region. Further analysis revealed that ER
stress shut down the STAT3-GFAP signaling, one of the
most critical pathways for astroglial activation, at least in
part, through the ER stress-responsive tyrosine phosphatase,
TC-PTP.
Astrocytes play important roles in various neuropathological situations, including acute brain insults such as stroke
and trauma. In these conditions, astrocytes undergo hypertrophy and up-regulate intermediate ﬁlaments such as GFAP
and vimentin, and this is referred to as reactive astrogliosis or
astroglial activation. Although reactive astrogliosis has both
detrimental and beneﬁcial aspects, recent studies have
emphasized its neuroprotective role through the regulation
of inﬂammation and restoration of brain tissue (Okada et al.
2006; Herrmann et al. 2008; Li et al. 2008). Our results also
demonstrated that attenuated astrogliosis/glial scar formation,
caused by deletion of Atf6a/, lead to a spreading of tissue
damage and cell death 5 days after MCAO (Figs 2b and 3c).
In contrast to the phenotypes in astrocytes, altered microglia/
macrophage phenotypes in Atf6a/ mice were not seen until

351

3 days after MCAO, while they became signiﬁcant 5 days
after MCAO. There were lower numbers of Iba1-positive
cells in the border between infarct and non-infarct area in
Atf6a/ mice (Fig. 3b i, iii). These phenotypes in Atf6a/
microglia/macrophages may be attributed to a direct effect of
Atf6a deletion on microglia/macrophages, or an indirect
effect through a reduced level of astrogliosis. Further studies
using conditional Atf6a knockout mice will provide detailed
mechanisms regarding the phenotypes found in Atf6a/
microglia/macrophages.
We have previously reported that neuron-speciﬁc overexpression of ORP150, a downstream molecule of ATF6a,
protected against brain ischemia through mechanisms
including Ca2+ homeostasis and production of neurotrophic
factors (Kitao et al. 2001; Tamatani et al. 2001). In contrast,
the current study emphasizes the neuroprotective role of
ATF6a through a non-cell-autonomous mechanism, astroglial activation/scar formation. These discrepancies could be
attributed to different types of genetic modiﬁcation in mice
and different models used to induce brain ischemia. In the
previous report, we used neuron-speciﬁc ORP150 Tg mice or
Hyou1+/ mice, because Hyou1/ mice are embryonic
lethal (Kitao et al. 2001), while in this study, we have used
Atf6a/ mice as they have normal development and can be
used for MCAO. Furthermore, in the previous work, we
estimated stroke volume and neuronal survival 24 h after
MCAO, when glial scar was not yet formed, while, in this
study, we did measure up to 5 days after MCAO. The basal
expression of GRP78 protein in Atf6a/ mice was not
different from that in wild-type mice (Fig. 4). This may be
because of the compensatory function of other UPR
pathways such as ATF6b and Ire1 (Yamamoto et al. 2007).
Among intracellular signaling pathways, STAT3 pathway
is among the most critical for inducing astrogliosis (Okada
et al. 2006; Li et al. 2008). In response to extracellular
signals such as IL-6, CNTF, and LIF, STAT3 is phosphorylated and translocates to the nucleus, where it promotes
transcription of downstream genes including Gfap (Yeo
et al. 2013). In the current study, the expression of IL-6, LIF,
or CNTF was not altered between wild-type and Atf6a/
mice in either control or ischemic conditions, while the level
of p-STAT3, phosphorylated STAT3, was lower in Atf6a/
mice when compared with wild-type mice after MCAO
(Fig. 5b). Similarly, the level of p-STAT3 was lower in
Atf6a/ astrocytes than wild-type astrocytes in vitro
(Fig. 6a). Treatment of cells with a chemical chaperone,
4-PBA, or with ER stressors, such as Tm and Tg, increased
and decreased the levels of p-STAT3 and Gfap, respectively
(Fig. 6c–f). These results suggest that enhanced level of
ER stress in the basal Atf6a/ astrocytes suppresses
STAT3-GFAP signaling.
Recent reports have demonstrated that ER stress regulates
STAT3 signaling through different mechanisms, including
PTP1B-dependent tyrosine dephosphorylation and HDAC-

dependent deacetylation (Kimura et al. 2012). In our model,
tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors such as orthovanadate and
bpV, but not a HDAC inhibitor, TSA, or Sirt1 inhibitor,
Ex527, enhanced levels of p-STAT3, and Gfap in both of
normal and Tm-treated conditions (Fig. 7a and b). There are
several PTPs expressed in astrocytes and/or C6 astroglioma
(Navis et al. 2010), and some, such as PTP1B/PTPN1 and
TC-PTP/PTPN2, are located, at least partly, in the ER. In our
model, Ptpn2 had the strongest response to ER stress (Fig. 7c
and d), and knockdown of Ptpn2, but not other genes,
enhanced the level of p-STAT3 in all conditions tested
(Fig. 7f).
TC-PTP/PTPN2 is a ubiquitously expressed, non-receptortype PTP that has a similar structure to PTP1B/PTPN1
(Navis et al. 2010). Two protein isoforms, TC45 and TC48,
are generated by alternative splicing (Mosinger et al. 1992).
TC45 is located in the nucleus, and regulates diverse
signaling molecules including STAT3 (Muppirala et al.
2013). TC48, in contrast, is anchored to the ER membrane
using its hydrophobic carboxyl terminus, and may function
in a secretory pathway (Muppirala et al. 2013). Our results
indicate that both of TC45 and TC48 are expressed in
astrocytes, and are up-regulated by ER stress, although the
expression level may be higher in TC45 (Figure S2), as
previously described (Mosinger et al. 1992). Further crude
cell fractionation analysis revealed that not only T48 but also
the majority of T45 was observed in the microsome fraction
in our system (Fig. 7e), suggesting that TC45 may be
recruited to some type of membrane in the secretory
pathway. It has been reported that the expression of
PTP1B/PTPN1, but not TC-PTP/PTPN2, is increased by
ER stress in pancreatic b cells (Beamer et al. 2006). The
discrepancy with our results may be attributed to the duration
of ER stress (days vs. hours) and the cell types (pancreatic b
cells vs. astrocytes). At this moment, we do not exclude the
possibility that other PTPs, such as SHP-1, may also play
important roles in regulating astroglial and microglial
activation, as previously described (Hashida et al. 2012).
Further studies will be required to clarify the roles of TCPTP and other PTPs in diverse neuropathological situations,
including Parkinson’s disease, in which we also observed
reduced astroglial activation in Atf6a/ mice (Cheng et al.
2002). It will also be intriguing to test the effect of PTP
inhibitors on astroglial activation and neuroprotection in
vivo.
It has been reported that both PTP1B and TC-PTP play
critical roles in the insulin and/or leptin resistance through
the suppression of STAT3 pathway (Zabolotny et al. 2002;
Fukushima et al. 2010). As astrocytes also contribute to
energy homeostasis in the brain both in normal and
pathological conditions, it would be important to ﬁnd the
role of these PTPs in the insulin/leptin signaling in
astrocytes. Analysis of PTPs in astrocytes will provide new

insight into the research of stress response and neuronal
death in the central nervous system.
