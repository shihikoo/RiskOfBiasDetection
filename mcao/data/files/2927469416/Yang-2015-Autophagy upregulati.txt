It has previously been demonstrated that ischemic stroke activates autophagy pathways; however, the mechanism remains unclear.
The aim of this study is to further investigate the role that autophagy plays in cerebral ischemia. 2, 4-diamino-6-hydroxy-pyrimidine
(DAHP), for its nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibiting neuroprotective effect, and triptolide (TP), for its anti-inflammatory
property, were selected to administer pre middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The drugs were administered 12 hours prior
to MCAO. Both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining showed that the
drugs reduce the area of infarction. Immunoblotting analysis revealed increases in Beclin-1 and myeloid cell leukelia-1(Mcl-1) in
treated rats. This could be a contributing factor to the reduction in autophagy induced damage. Immunochemistry and western
blot showed that mTOR expression in treated rats was marginally different 24 h after injury, and this could also be significant in
the mechanism. Furthermore, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase- (TdT-) mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining
proved that the drugs are effective in reducing apoptosis. The upregulation of Beclin-1 and Mcl-1 and downregulation of Bcl-2,
caspase-3, and the Bcl-2/Beclin-1 ratio infer that the neuroprotective effect of DAHP and TP act via the mediation of autophagy
and apoptosis pathways.

1. Introduction
Stroke remains the third leading cause of death in industrialized countries, with an incidence of approximately 0.25%‚Äì4%
and a mortality rate of around 30% [1]. And it is becoming
an evermore prominent global threat [2]. Ischemic stroke
occurs when there is an acute blockage of arterial blood flow
to the brain tissue. Thus, minimising infarction area and the
generation of new neuronal cells in the injured brain are
considered important strategic approaches [3]. Developing
consistently effective therapy for ischemic stroke is a major
challenge [4].
Brain edema is the first indication to the level of the
ensuing disease course and the development of MRI and CT;
brain edema has become one of the major determinate factors
of livability in patients beyond the first few hours after stroke
[1]. With regard to the pathological mechanisms of cerebral

ischemia, it has been well established that caspase signaling, inflammatory factors, and excitotoxicity represent the
main causes of neuronal apoptosis. Caspase inhibitors and
antioxidants that are associated with the absence of complete
biochemical and morphological characteristics of neuronal
apoptosis have proved to be ineffective [5]. In light of this, we
indicate that there must be other important cell death
pathways that contribute to the pathophysiology [5, 6].
Recently, the possible role of autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases and tumor suppression has increasingly been
examined. It is possible that diseases such as Huntington‚Äôs,
Parkinson‚Äôs, and Alzheimer‚Äôs could result due to autophagy
deficiency. It has been reported that autophagy is not only
activated in neurons by closed head injury or focal cerebral
ischemia but also by hypoxic or excitotoxic stimuli [7, 8]. It is
now a widely held view that autophagy can be viewed as a
double-edged sword. To be more specific, it can be protective

2
when activated by mild physiological stressors yet detrimental to neuronal survival when overactivated, leading to a
series of fateful consequences [5].
It is known that autophagy can be rapidly upregulated in
many processes such as ischemia [9], but the exact mechanisms underlying autophagy in cerebral ischemia remain
unclear. It has been proved, however, that Nampt regulates autophagy in neurons upon cerebral ischemia through
the TSC2 Ser1387-TOR-S6K1 signaling pathway via aSIRT1dependent manner [5]. Moreover, previous study has shown
that autophagy inhibitors can attenuate the secondary thalamic damage that follows focal cerebral infarction. Apoptosis
is also involved in the process [10]. According to several
studies, Beclin-1 is a major participant involved in ischemiainduced autophagy and Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic protein member of the Bcl-2 family, regulates the balance between autophagy and apoptosis [11, 12]. Also, it has been hypothesised
that Mcl-1 and Beclin-1 may operate together in the same
cells after ischemic reperfusion; results showed that both
LC3 and Beclin-1 were evident in ischemic brains between 4
and 72 hours after MCAO. The coexpression of Mcl-1 with
Beclin-1 might attenuate Beclin-1 dependent autophagy during ischemic stroke in rats [13]. Some studies demonstrated
that, as one component of the class III phosphatidylinositol
kinase (PI3K), Beclin-1 has been proved to initiate autophagy
through interacting with the other components of PI3K pathway. However, there has also been research elucidating that
autophagy induced by regulation of the TSC2-mTOR-S6K1
signaling pathway promotes neuronal survival during cerebral ischemia [5, 12].
DAHP, an inhibitor of GTP-cyclohydrolase I (GTP-CHI),
has been proved to have anti-inflammatory properties and
neuroprotective effects in many diseases, including cerebral
ischemia. Previous study shows that DAHP treatment significantly reduced infarction volume [14]. However, its mechanism remains unknown. According to one investigation
into the mechanism of DAHP, the pretreatment effects are
related to inhibition of biopterin (BH(4)) and nitric oxide
(NO) production [15]. To date, there has been no research
concerning DAHP and autophagy.
With regard to the other drugs selected for this study,
TP is one of the major active components of the traditional Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook.f. and it
has been reported to have potent anti-inflammatory and
immunosuppressive properties. Furthermore, its effect on the
pathogenesis of neurological disorders, such as Parkinson‚Äôs
disease, has been researched and found to play a protective
role on dopaminergic neurons through its ability to limit
lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory damage. The NFùúÖB signaling pathway has been reported to be involved
in the protective effects of TP. Therefore, TP treatment
should be considered as a potential therapy for cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion injury [16, 17]. However, the particular
protective effects of TP in cerebral ischemia are still unclear.
Firstly, preliminary experiments were done on DAHP
and TP treated MCAO model rats. We have found that the
neuroprotective effect of DAHP was from inhibition of BH(4)
and NO production. This process may be involved in the
apoptosis pathway. Preexperimental results also showed that

Mediators of Inflammation
NF-ùúÖB signaling pathways may be involved in the effect of
TP pretreatment on ischemia. The results also reaffirmed that
the drugs induced inflammatory and apoptotic responses.
Correspondingly, we concluded that DAHP and TP were
associated with cell apoptosis.

2. Material and Methods
2.1. Animal Preparation. All the animals used in this study
were pathogen-free male Sprague‚ÄìDawley rats weighing
250‚àº280 g, provided by the Animal Center of Zhejiang
University. All rats had access to food and water and kept in an
air-conditioned room with a constant temperature of 24¬±1‚àò C.
They were kept under a 12 hour light/dark cycle in separated
clean cages. All feeding and breeding operations used in this
study were compliant with the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
guidelines, which have also been approved by the Ethics
Committee for Use of Experimental Animals in Zhejiang
University.
2.2. Experimental Groups. A total number of 60 male
Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly separated into 5 groups.
Each group had 12 rats, 6 of them for extracting proteins and
the other 6 for perfusion. The experimental groups were
normal rats (control group), DMSO group (vehicle group),
MCAO group, DAHP treatment group, and TP treatment
group.
2.3. Drugs Administration. TP was purchased from Merck
(Darmstadt, Germany), and DAHP was obtained from Sigma
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). TP was dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) and then injected intraperitoneally at a
dose of 0.2 mg/kg [18]. The time point of administration is 12
hours before the MCAO operation. The rats in DMSO group
were given an equivalent dose of DMSO under the same
approach. DAHP was also dissolved in DMSO and injected
intraperitoneally at a dose of 0.5 g/kg [14, 19]. The time point
is also 12 hours before ischemia, because it has been reported
to be the optimum time for neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases [14].
2.4. Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion. Temporary focal
cerebral ischemia was induced by occlusion of the right
MCAO. In brief, after anesthetising with 10% chloral hydrate
intraperitoneally, a nylon thread, which is 0.26 mm in diameter with a distal cylinder, was inserted into the lumen of
the external carotid artery and advanced to the origin of the
middle cerebral artery (MCA). A 4-0-monofilament nylon
suture was prepared for making the knots [5, 8]. And three
knots were made on arteries. After 90 minutes, the nylon
thread was then removed to allow reperfusion. All the animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia and were
sacrificed the following day for histological analysis and
immunoblotting [8].
2.5. MRI Examination. A 3.0-Tesla (T) MRI animal scanner Magnetom Trio with TIM system (Siemens, Erlangen,

Mediators of Inflammation
Germany) was used to examine the rats‚Äô brains. The rats‚Äô
heads were subjected to a custom device, of which the inner
diameter is 30 mm, for signal excitation and detection. MRI
parameters were set as follows: TE = 92 ms, TR = 3620 ms,
FOV = 8 √ó 8 cm, ùëÄ = 256 √ó 256, NA = 2, thickness =
2 mm, and gap = 0 mm. And then, after optimal adjustment of
contrast by analyzing ‚Äúmean density value‚Äù in Image-Pro Plus
5.0 software (Media Cybernetic, Bethesda, MD, USA), we
obtained the images of hemisphere intensity.
2.6. TTC Staining. TTC staining was exploited for detecting
infarction volume and was conducted as described previously. In breif, rats were deeply anesthetised with 10% chloral
hydrate intraperitoneally and sacrificed by decapitation. The
brain was rapidly dissected and sectioned into six coronal
blocks in an adult rat brain matrix (Kent Scientific Corporation) with an approximate thickness of 2 mm. These
sections were stained by incubating them in a solution of 2%
TTC (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min at 37‚àò C in
the dark and then a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde. TTC
was dissolved in physiological saline solution. The unstained
areas were considered to be the infract areas, as presented
in the figures. The total infarction volume for each slice was
calculated by including all brain slices. The possible interference of brain edema to infarction volume was corrected by
the following standard method, the noninfarcted area of the
ipsilateral hemisphere/total noninfarcted area (from both the
ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres) [20].
2.7. Immunohistochemistry. The first procedure of immunohistochemistry is to get the tissue prepared. Briefly, the rats
were deeply anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate and then
perfused transcardially with 500 mL of 0.9% saline to flush
the vascular system, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in
0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). The brains
were removed and soaked in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution. After 24 hours, the brains were transferred to a 30%
sucrose solution. Frozen sections, of which the thickness
is about 18 ùúám, were incubated with 5% normal blocking
serum for 1 h at room temperature (RT) and then overnight
at 4‚àò C with primary antibody as follows: anti-beclin-1 (rabbit,
monoclonal, 1 : 100; CST#3495), while the negative control
sections were incubated with 0.01 M PBS instead of primary
antibody. The next day, after being washed in 0.01 M PBS for 5
minutes three times, sections were incubated for 60 min with
secondary antibody, which is goat anti-rabbit IgG included in
the kit [7]. Then 0.01 M PBS for 5 minutes five times before
DAB detecting (UltraVision HP IHC detection kit, TL-015QHD). After hematoxylin staining, the sections were washed
with ddH2 O for 20 minutes and differentiated using 1%
hydrochloric acid alcohol.
2.8. Immunofluorescent Labeling and TUNEL Staining. The
frozen sections were rinsed in 0.01 M PBS for 5 minutes.
After oven drying at 37‚àò C, sections were blocked with 5%
normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Thereafter, they were incubated with the caspase-3 (1 : 100, CST
#9665) primary antibodies at 4‚àò C overnight. Negative control

3
sections were incubated with 0.01 M PBS rather than primary
antibody [13]. The next day, after being washed in 0.01 M PBS
for 5 minutes three times, sections were incubated at RT for
1 h with FITC goat anti-rabbit IgG (1 : 100, Boster BA1105).
After being washed three times, the sections were prepared
for fluorescence. TUNEL staining was done on sections of
each group. All the procedures are following the manufacturer‚Äôs suggestions of the in situ cell death detection kit (Calbiochem, QIA39). Fluorescence signals were detected by a
fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51, NIKON, Japan) at
excitation/emission wavelengths of 550/570 nm (Cy3, red)
and 492/520 nm (FITC, Green and blue) [10].
2.9. Western Blot Analysis. Total protein was extracted with
western blot lysis buffer containing 20 mM TRIS-HCl (pH
7.4), 1.5 M NaCl, 1%TritonX-100, 0.1%SDS, 1 mM Na2 EDTA,
and 1% PMSF (Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, Beyotime
ST505). The homogenate was then centrifuged at 12000 rpm
for 20 min at 4‚àò C and the supernatant was preserved at ‚àí80‚àò C
[10]. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA
kit (KeyGEN, Nanjing, China). Twenty mg of protein from
each sample was subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDSPAGE gel using a constant voltage [21]. Electrophoresis was
performed at 100 V for 20 min, then 180 V for 40 min, and
separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane in a Bio-Rad
TransBlot apparatus, which was performed at 100V for
120 min. The blots were blocked with 5% rehydrated nonfat
dry milk for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated with
primary antibody overnight at 4‚àò C. The primary antibodies
were rabbit polyclonal antibody against ùõΩ-actin (1 : 2000,
Abmart #P30002), Beclin-1 (1 : 1000, CST#3495), mTOR
(1 : 1000, EPITOMICS, p42345), and Mcl-1 (1 : 100, SANTA
CRUZ, sc-819). The following day, after 5 minutes of TBST
washing over 3 times, the blots were incubated with goat antirabbit IgG antibody (AURAGENE, SA009) for 2 hours at
room temperature. The detection reagents were placed on the
blot for 1 min and then exposed to Hyperfilm-ECL for 2‚Äì
30 min and then exposed with Kodak X-OMAT films [8].
2.10. Statistical Analysis. The statistical differences between
two groups were analyzed using the established t-test. Oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine
statistical significance with SPSS 16.0 program. The null
hypothesis was rejected at the 0.05 level. GraghPad prism 5
was used to perform the histograms.

3. Results
3.1. MRI Outcome Demonstrates That Both DAHP and TP
Attenuate Cerebral Ischemia. MRI is considered the most
promising and noninvasive approach for examining brain
edema formation. With T2-weighted imaging, we can determine the edema induced by I/R to evaluate cerebral edema.
As we can ascertain from the images in Figure 1(b), the
MCAO group has obvious hyperintensity, while no hyperintensity was shown in the control group. Both the DAHP treatment group and TP treatment group have less hyperintensity

Figure 1: The representative images of TTC staining and MRI outcome show the effects of DAHP and TP on MCAO-induced focal cerebral
ischemia in rats. (a) Mean change in infarction volume is significant in MCAO group (MCAO), DAHP treatment group (DAHP), and TP
treatment group (TP) in comparison with the normal control (control). Infarction area was less in the treatment groups than the MCAO
group, thus presenting their neuroprotective effects. Data is expressed as means ¬± SEM (ùëõ = 5‚Äì10); ‚àó ùëÉ < 0.05, ‚àó‚àó ùëÉ < 0.01, and ‚àó‚àó‚àó ùëÉ < 0.001
compared with normal control. (b) Compared with vehicle group (vehicle) and control, the images show hyperintensity in MCAO, DAHP,
and TP, among which MCAO has the largest hyperintensity areas. (c) The images of TTC staining in each group show the same tendency
of ischemia infarction as the MRI results; DAHP and TP attenuate cerebral ischemia. TTC staining results revealed that the differences in
infarction areas were significant in rats pretreated by DAHP and TP, which is consistent with MRI results.

than the MCAO group. From this result, we can deduce that
both DAHP and TP attenuate cerebral ischemia [22].

was higher in the TP treatment group than the DAHP
treatment group; results can be seen in Figures 3(b) and 3(c).

3.2. TTC Staining Shows That DAHP and TP Treatments Can
Reduce Infarction Volume Following Focal Brain Ischemia.
Representative samples of TTC-stained brain sections are
shown in Figure 1(c), and corresponding infarction volumes
are shown in Figure 1(a). No cerebral infarction was observed
in the sham group or the control group. A significant increase
in infarction volume in the MCAO group can be seen. When
compared with the DMSO group, there was a clear reduction
in infarction volume in the DAHP treatment group and the
TP treatment group (Figure 1(a)).

3.5. Mcl-1 Expression Showed the Same Change Tendency
as Beclin-1 according to Western Blot Detection. From
Figure 4(a), it can be seen that, much like Beclin-1 expression,
Mcl-1 expression was lower in the MCAO group but elevated
in DAHP and TP treatment groups. Therefore, in agreement
with previous studies [10, 12], our western blot results also
showed a similar change trend in Beclin-1, which can be seen
in Figure 4(b). The expression of Mcl-1 in the MCAO group is
lowest, then the two treatments groups and finally the control
group. The similarity in the changes between Mcl-1 and
Beclin-1 levels in each group indicates that the two proteins
could be concomitantly involved in the regulation autophagy.

3.3. Immunofluorescent Labeling and TUNEL Staining Results
Present a Decrease in Apoptosis after DAHP and TP Treatments. TUNEL-positive cells represent apoptotic cells. From
Figure 2(c), we can see that the proportion of positive cells in
MCAO group is markedly higher than the control group. The
proportion of positive cells in the DAHP treatment group and
the TP treatment group is significantly less than the MCAO
group but still more than the control group. In addition,
immunofluorescent labeling of caspase-3 showed a similar
decrease in apoptosis in the DAHP treatment group and the
TP treatment group. This can be seen in Figure 2(d). Caspase3 expression in the DAHP treatment group and the TP
treatment group was higher than the control group.
3.4. Immunochemistry and Western Blot Staining Reveal an
Upregulation of Beclin-1 in DAHP and TP Treatments Groups.
Representative figures of the immunofluorescent and western
blot staining results are shown in Figures 3(d) and 3(a),
respectively. Previous research has proved that autophagy
inhibition by Beclin-1 knockdown can attenuate secondary
thalamic damage after focal cerebral infarction. In comparison with the MCAO group, a clearly elevated level of Beclin-1
was detected in the DAHP treatment group and the TP
treatment group. Furthermore, both the western blot and the
immunochemistry analysis showed that Beclin-1 expression

3.6. Western Blot and Immunochemistry Staining Reveal an
Upregulation of mTOR after MCAO. As shown in Figures
5(a) and 5(b), western blot analysis revealed that mTOR
expression levels were higher in the MCAO group than the
vehicle and control groups. The DAHP treatment group and
the TP treatment group were lower than the MCAO group
but higher than the vehicle and control groups. The immunochemistry results presented the same phenomenon. From
Figure 5(d), it can be seen that the positive staining area is
greater in the MCAO group than the control group, while
the DAHP treatment group and TP treatment groups were
in between the two; corresponding changes can be seen in
Figure 5(c). Both western blot and immunochemistry staining showed that mTOR was upregulated after MCAO and
attenuated with DAHP treatment and TP treatment.
3.7. Immunofluorescent Analysis of Bcl-2 Expression Shows
That DAHP and TP Have Antiapoptotic Effects. The antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 has been proved to play a role in
Beclin-1 dependent autophagy. From Figures 6(b) and 6(a),
it can been seen that the immunofluorescent results showed a
dramatic decrease in Bcl-2 expression in the MCAO group in
comparison with the vehicle and control groups, while the
DAHP group and TP group attenuated this change. Our result

is consistent with previous study, which demonstrated that
Bcl-2 can inhibit Beclin-1 induced autophagy.

4. Discussion
This present study used the MCAO model and two intraperitoneally administered drugs, DAHP and TP, selected due to
their proven neuroprotective ability in certain diseases. MRI
and TTC staining were exploited, and the result demonstrated that DAHP and TP can reduce the infarction area.
Immunoblotting analysis shows that both the DAHP treatment group and the TP treatment group increased Beclin-1
and Mcl-1 levels after MCAO. Furthermore, TUNEL staining
proved the drugs effective in reducing apoptosis. Thus, we
concluded that DAHP and TP can regulate autophagy and
apoptosis in MCAO model rats.
DAHP has been firmly proved to be play a role in inhibiting BH(4) and NO production. TP has been shown to have
anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, both DAHP and
TP have neuroprotective potential in neurodegenerative diseases, including cerebral ischemia. Although much research
has been done to explore the exact mechanism of ischemic
stroke, it remains unclear whether a pretreatment of DAHP
or TP could be considerably protective for cerebral ischemia.
And the mechanism closely related with autophagy and
apoptosis needs more investigation [21, 23]. Our present
study employed a sophisticated MCAO model, aiming to testify the protective mechanism of DAHP and TP. Meanwhile,
we are exploring the connections between protection and
autophagy.
The complete role that autophagy plays in the pathogeneses of some neurodiseases has yet to be agreed upon.
However, researcher have uncovered that tumor necrosis
factor-ùõº (TNF-ùõº) upregulates the expression of LC-3 and
Beclin-1 induces autophagy by activating the JNK pathway

and inhibiting the AKT pathway [24, 25]. Recent studies have found that some autophagy related proteins are
directly involved in immune and inflammatory responses,
throughout the whole autophagy process. We also know that
macrophages contain Toll like receptor (TLR) ligand coated
particles of phagosome and lysosome, and the fusion process
for autophagy requires the participation of Beclin-1 and LC-3.
Also, in dendritic cells, autophagy related proteins are
involved in the fusion of lysosomal and TLR phagosomes,
containing apoptotic cell antigen [26]. Beclin-1-PI3K compound, LC3, and Atg12 can be recruited to the gram negative
bacteria vesicles [27]. It was from this that we concluded our
hypothesis that each of the aforementioned factors may be
concomitantly involved in autophagy‚Äôs role in neuron destruction in cerebral ischemia (Figure 7).
To date, a consensus has not been reached on whether
autophagy has protective or detrimental role in neuronal
damage. Our results indicate that both apoptosis and autophagy play protective roles at the beginning [28, 29]. However, they become detrimental later on, after crossing the
warning fence. Researches have shown that Beclin-1 interacts
with Bcl-2 to inhibit autophagy, leading to a downregulation
of apoptosis in the central nervous system (CNS). However,
since Beclin-1 and Bcl-2 are separated, autophagy is always
happening [30, 31]. Beclin-1 is important in autophagy related
processes. The expression of Beclin-1 promotes autophagy.
Thus, downregulated Beclin-1 expression reduces autophagic
activity [9]. Beclin-1 plays an important role in all autophagy
related procedures, except for the formation of autophagic
vacuoles. Therefore, we suspect that Beclin-1 is a crucial protein regulating autophagy, but not necessary for autophagy to
take place. Recent studies show that Beclin-1 works in both
the autophagy and apoptosis processes. Bcl-2, an antiapoptosis factor, also has regulatory effects that interact with Beclin-1
to participate in the regulation of autophagy and apoptosis.
From the above-mentioned statement about these two crucial
factors, the interrelation of autophagy and apoptosis can be

closely related with Beclin-1 and Bcl-2 interactions [31, 32].
We found a dramatic elevation in Beclin-1 expression levels in
both the DAHP treatment group and the TP treatment group
challenged by cerebral ischemia. This result is in agreement
with previous literature data [21, 33].

Our results showed that the change in Mcl-1 expression
followed the same trend as Beclin-1. And this phenomenon
is in accordance with previous study, which demonstrated
that Mcl-1 potentially modulated Beclin-1 induced autophagy.
Mcl-1 is a key regulator of apoptosis during central nervous

system development [21, 34]. Emerging data suggest that Mcl1 is critical for the survival of different cells. It is an antiapoptosis gene in the Bcl-2 family, so inhibition of Mcl-1 promotes
cell death [6, 35]. Many chemotherapeutic drugs induce
apoptosis through downregulation of Mcl-1 expression in
tumor cells to reach their therapeutic effects. And there has
been an increasing amount of research on interdisciplinary
studies between cancer and neurodegenerative diseases [36].
Our results demonstrate that apoptosis was clearly
increased after MCAO, while autophagy was downregulated.
Moreover, in the DAHP treatment group and the TP
treatment group, neuroprotective roles were conducted
through the downregulation of apoptosis and upregulation of
autophagy, resulting in an attenuation of cerebral ischemia. In
addition, there already existed papers on the effective treatments of these two drugs on other diseases. It has been well
accepted that autophagy is a double-edged sword in ischemia
[27], in that it can be moderately activated to promote
cell survival under certain circumstances, like starving and
hypoxia [29], yet it is disastrous when it is overactivated,
leading to cell lysis and cell death. Therefore, we hypothesised
that DAHP and TP achieve their protective effects in ischemic
stroke by moderately regulating autophagy rather than
disastrously overactivating it. Similarly, apoptosis was also
appropriately adjusted, thus moderately regulating both
apoptosis and autophagy. Therefore, only when autophagy is
activated to within a certain range can the drugs be effective
in treating cerebral ischemia.
From our experiment, we have proven our hypothesis
on both a protein and a histological level. However, there
were certain limitations on our experiments; for instance, the
results were only from 24 h reperfusion. However, some other
researches conducted parallel experiments and explored the
relationship between reperfusion time points and treatment
effects of certain drugs. Furthermore, there have already been
studies indicating that autophagy exhibited the strongest
effect at 72 h after reperfusion. Accordingly, we plan to
conduct experiments with a larger timescale, the 72 h mark in
particular.
