Abstract
The role of nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) in early blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption was determined using a new mouse
model of transient focal cerebral ischemia. Ischemia was induced by ligating the middle cerebral artery (MCA) at its M2
segment and reperfusion was induced by releasing the ligation. The diameter alteration of the MCA, arterial anastomoses
and collateral arteries were imaged and measured in real time. BBB disruption was assessed by Evans Blue (EB) and sodium
fluorescein (Na-F) extravasation at 3 hours of reperfusion. The reperfusion produced an extensive vasodilation and a
sustained hyperemia. Although expression of NOSs was not altered at 3 hours of reperfusion, L-NAME (a non-specific NOS
inhibitor) abolished reperfusion-induced vasodilation/hyperemia and significantly reduced EB and Na-F extravasation. L-NIO
(an endothelial NOS (eNOS) inhibitor) significantly attenuated cerebral vasodilation but not BBB disruption, whereas L-NPA
and 7-NI (neuronal NOS (nNOS) inhibitors) significantly reduced BBB disruption but not cerebral vasodilation. In contrast,
aminoguanidine (AG) (an inducible NOS (iNOS) inhibitor) had less effect on either cerebral vasodilation or BBB disruption.
On the other hand, papaverine (PV) not only increased the vasodilation/hyperemia but also significantly reduced BBB
disruption. Combined treatment with L-NAME and PV preserved the vasodilation/hyperemia and significantly reduced BBB
disruption. Our findings suggest that nNOS may play a major role in early BBB disruption following transient focal cerebral
ischemia via a hyperemia-independent mechanism.

peroxynitrite [6,7]. The rapid restoration of blood flow following
ischemia increases the level of tissue oxygenation but accounts for
a burst of NO and superoxide generation, which may result in a
rapid increase in peroxynitrite formation. Peroxynitrite was
reported to activate MMPs 2 and 9 following transient focal
cerebral ischemia [8]. A previous study found that preischemic
treatment with L-NAME, a non-specific inhibitor of NOS,
significantly reduced early BBB disruption following transient
global ischemia [9]. Recently, preischemic treatment with LNAME was shown effective in preventing early BBB disruption
following transient focal cerebral ischemia [10]. In addition,
methylene blue ameliorated early BBB disruption following
transient global ischemia by decreasing NO metabolites [11]. All
three isoforms of NOS, endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal NOS
(nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS), may be involved in NO
synthesis following transient focal cerebral ischemia. Thus, our
first goal was to identify the NOS isoform that plays the major role
in early BBB disruption following transient focal cerebral ischemia.
Since postischemic hyperemia has been suggested to associate with
adverse events, including ischemic edema, BBB disruption, and
poorer outcome [12], it is possible that excessive production of NO
during reperfusion lead early BBB disruption via a sustained
vasodilation/hyperemia. Thus, our second goal was to determine

Introduction
Stroke continues to be a leading cause of death and permanent
disability worldwide [1]. Due to the use of thrombolytic therapy,
transient focal cerebral ischemia has become one of the most
common types of ischemic stroke. Although establishment of
reperfusion is important for the cells in the penumbral zone,
reperfusion is the most powerful independent predictor of BBB
disruption [2]. BBB disruption occurs in early and late phases
following ischemic stroke [3]. Early BBB disruption can be found
as early as within first hour of reperfusion [4], whereas late BBB
disruption occurs between 24 hours to 72 hours of reperfusion [3].
Early BBB disruption has been considered as an antecedent event
to infarction and hemorrhagic transformation [2,5]. Although the
mechanism remains poorly delineated, activation of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9 has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of early BBB disruption following transient focal
cerebral ischemia [3].
Nitric oxide (NO), synthesized by NO synthases (NOSs), is a
well-known vasodilator, neurotransmitter and key mediator of
immunity. However, NO has detrimental effect under pathophysiological conditions especially when it is excessively produced and/
or oxidative stress is being involved. Overproduction of NO may
lead cell damage by directly altering protein structure/function
and/or indirectly through the formation of highly reactive

BBB disruption.

(10 mM) and PV (10 mM) are reported effective in cerebral
vasculature [13,14,15,16,17].

Materials and Methods

Measurement of regional vasodilation
Image recording of cerebral vasculature was started one minute
before MCAL and continued throughout the experiment with an
Orca-Flash 2.8 CMOS camera (Szxz-FOF, Olympus, Japan). The
images at 5, 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes of ischemia and 5, 10,
30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes of reperfusion were analyzed
with a Visiopharm Integrator System (Olympus, Japan). Percentage
change of vascular diameter at the middle of the MCA branches,
arterial anastomoses, and terminal branches of the anterior cerebral
artery (ACA) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA), which are
anastomosing the terminal branches of the MCA, were calculated.
We classified all the imaged vessels by their baseline diameters: MCA:
M3 (d$70 mm), M3 (60 mm#d,70 mm), M3 (50 mm#d,60 mm),
M3 (40 mm#d,50 mm), M3 (30 mm#d,40 mm), M3 (d,30 mm);
arterial anastomoses and terminal branches of ACA/PCA.

Preparation of animals
Animal studies were approved by the University Committee on
Animal Resources of the Louisiana State University Health
Science Center-Shreveport and conducted in accordance with
the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments)
guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. At 4 months
of age (body weight 25 to 30 g), male C57BL/6J mice (n = 72)
were anesthetized with thiobutabarbital sodium (Inactin, 100 mg/
kg, ip), and a tracheotomy was performed. The mice were
ventilated mechanically with room air and supplemental oxygen
using a small animal ventilator (Harvard apparatus, March,
Germany) at a fixed inhalation-exhalation ratio (1:1). A catheter
was placed into right femoral vein for injection of Evans Blue (EB)
and sodium fluorescein (Na-F). Blood pressure was measured using
a CODA mouse tail-cuff system (Kent Scientific, Torrington, CT,
USA). Body temperature was maintained at 37uC using a rectal
temperature regulated heating pad (TC1000, CWE, Ardmore, PA,
USA).
To perform ischemia/reperfusion, observe cerebral vasculature
and topically administrate NOS inhibitors and NO-independent
vasodilator, the mice were placed on a stereotaxic frame. A cranial
window (6 mm68 mm, 1 mm from midline to the zygomatic
arch) was prepared over the left frontal, parietal and temporal
cortex (Figure 1). The cranial window was suffused with artificial
cerebrospinal fluid bubbled continuously with 95% nitrogen and
5% carbon dioxide. The temperature of the suffusate was
maintained at 37uC. The cranial window was connected via a
three-way valve to an infusion pump, which allowed for infusion of
NOS inhibitors and NO-independent vasodilator into the cranial
window. This method will maintain temperature, pH, PCO2 and
PO2 of the cranial window at normal physiological range during
the experiment. The MCA was ligated at its M2 segment just
proximal to the first bifurcation/trifurcation with a 10-0 nylon
suture for 2 hours (Figure 1). To prevent potential damage to the
MCA during the ligation and easily induce reperfusion, a segment
of 5-0 monofilament nylon suture was ligated together with the
MCA. Reperfusion was induced by removing the nylon suture at
2 hours of ischemia (Figure 1). In Sham group, 10-0 nylon suture
was not ligated.

Measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)
To determine whether cerebral vasodilation during ischemia
produces a hyperemia, we monitored rCBF at left somatosensory
area. The probe of Laser Doppler Flowmetry (Periflux System
5000, Perimed, Sweden) was attached on the surface of anterior
central gyrus 4–5 mm lateral to the midline. The rCBF was
measured at the time points when cerebral vasculature was
imaged. Changes in rCBF is calculated and expressed as
percentage changes to the baseline.

Assessment of BBB disruption
EB and Na-F were used to evaluate large and small solute
permeability of BBB respectively. EB (4%, 6 ml/kg, Sigma) and
Na-F (0.4%, 6 ml/kg, Sigma) saline solution were mixed and
injected into the femoral vein at two and half hours of reperfusion
(Figure 1 D). At 3 hours of reperfusion, mice were transcardially
punctured to collect blood sample and then perfuse saline (about
50 ml) until colorless fluid was obtained from the right atrium.
Brains were removed quickly, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at 280uC. To determine the content of EB and Na-F in the brain
tissues, ischemic side and contralateral cerebral hemispheres were
separated, homogenized in 400 ml PBS and centrifuged at 4uC for
10 minutes at 1300 g. The supernatant was collected and protein
concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad,
CA, USA) with BSA as the standard. The supernatant was added
with 50% trichloroacetic acid at 2:1 ratio and stored at 4uC for
12 hours. The mixture was centrifuged at 4uC for 15 minutes at
15000 g, 100 ml supernatant was added with Borate buffer at 1:2
ratio and transferred to 96-well black plates. The concentration of
Na-F was determined at 485-nm excitation/538-nm emission with
Cyto Fluor Series 4000 fluorescence multiwell plate reader
(PerSeptive Biosystems, MA, USA). To determine the content of
EB in the brain tissues, the pellet of the homogenates were
suspended with 500 ml formamide and incubated at 50uC for
72 hours. The mixture was centrifuged at 4uC for 20 minutes at
21000 g, and 300 ml supernatant was transferred to 96-well clear
plate. The concentration of EB was determined at 550-nm
excitation/620-nm emission with a Microplate Spectrophotometer, Spectra Max 190 (Molecular Devices, CA, USA). To
normalize the content of EB and Na-F in brain tissues, plasma
concentration of EB and Na-F was measured. Blood sample was
centrifuged at 4uC for 10 minutes at 3000 g. The supernatant was
diluted with water at 1:4 ratio. Diluted plasma was added with
20% trichloroacetic acid at 1:10 ratio and put into cool room (4uC)
for 12 hours. The mixture was centrifuged at 4uC for 15 minutes

Experimental protocol
The cranial window was superfused with artificial cerebrospinal
fluid for 30 minutes before ligating the MCA. We examined the
influences of NOS inhibitors (non-specific NOS inhibitor: L-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME); selective nNOS inhibitors:
N(omega)-propyl-L-arginine (L-NPA) and 7-nitroindazole (7-NI);
relatively selective eNOS inhibitor: L-N(5)-(1-iminoethyl)ornithine
(L-NIO); selective iNOS inhibitor: aminoguanidine (AG)) and
NO-independent vasodilator (papaverine (PV)) on MCA ligation
(MCAL)/reperfusion-induced regional vasodilation, hyperemia
and early BBB disruption. The animals were divided into seven
groups: Control (n = 12), Sham (n = 4), L-NAME (n = 8), L-NPA
(n = 8), 7-NI (n = 8), L-NIO (n = 8), AG (n = 8), PV (n = 8) and LNAME+PV (n = 8). Drugs were mixed in artificial cerebrospinal
fluid and then superfused into the cranial window. The
superfusion of NOS inhibitors and NO-independent vasodilator
was started 10 minutes prior to the reperfusion and then
continued throughout 3-hour reperfusion. The window concentration of L-NAME (300 mM), L-NPA (5 mM), 7-NI (10 mM), AG

at 15000 g, 100 ml supernatant was added with Borate buffer at

incubated at 50uC for 72 hours. The mixture was centrifugation
at 4uC for 20 minutes at 21000 g, and 30 ml supernatant was

dilution. The concentration of EB was read at 550-nm excitation/

use of mouse anti-eNOS (BD Bioscience, CA, USA), mouse antinNOS (Santa Cruz, TX, USA), rabbit anti-iNOS (Santa Cruz,
TX, USA) and rabbit anti-b-tubulin (Santa Cruz, TX, USA) as
primary and peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and goat
anti-rabbit IgG as the second antibodies. The bound antibody was
detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection (Pierce
Chemical, IL) and the bands were analyzed using ChemiDocTM
MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad). For quantification, NOS proteins
were normalized to the expressed b-tubulin.

Statistical Analysis
For comparison of the various treatments, results were
compared using a two-way repeated measure ANOVA with
Tukey’s post hoc test. Student t tests were used to compare NOS
expression before and following transient focal cerebral ischemia.
Values are means 6 SEM. A p value of 0.05 or less was considered
to be significant.

Western Blot Analysis
Additional four brains from the control group were used to
measure the expression of NOSs. Under microscope, infarct core
was identified as opaque area, and the cortex bordering 2 mm the
infarct core was considered as the peri-infarct area. Parietal cortex
and striatum tissues punched at the peri-infarct and contralateral
corresponding areas were used for measuring eNOS, nNOS and
iNOS. Brain tissues were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer
containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris HCl, 10 mM EDTA,
0.1% Tween-20, 1% Triton, 0.1% mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 5 mg/mL leupeptin, and 5 mg/mL
aprotinin, pH 7.4. Homogenates were centrifuged at 4uC for
10 minutes at 10000 g, and the supernatants were collected.
Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method
(Bio-Rad, CA, USA) with BSA as the standard. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed on a 10%
gel on which 20 mg of total protein per well was loaded. After
SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane. Immunoblotting was performed with the

Results
MCAL/reperfusion-induced cerebral vasodilation
Cerebral vasodilation occurred in nearly all branches of MCA,
arterial anastomoses, and terminal branches of ACA/PCA during
both ischemia and reperfusion. It started immediately after
MCAL, reached to the peak between 10 to 30 minutes after
MCAL and kept at a steady state during the rest period of
ischemia. The magnitude of cerebral vasodilation was varied in
branches more than 40 mm in diameter and similar in smaller
branches (Figure 2). Cerebral vasodilation continued during the
entire 3-hour reperfusion. The magnitude of cerebral vasodilation
during reperfusion was less during the first 150 minutes and
greater at 180 minutes of reperfusion compared with the
vasodilation during ischemia.

contrast, topical treatment with L-NIO and AG only inhibited
Na-F extravasation (Figure 4).

Effects of NOS inhibitors on cerebral vasodilation
As shown in Figure 2, topical treatment with 300 mM L-NAME
abolished cerebral vasodilation in all branches of the MCA,
arterial anastomoses and terminal branches of ACA/PCA during
reperfusion. Topical treatment with L-NIO at 10 mM similarly
inhibited reperfusion-induced cerebral vasodilation as L-NAME.
In contrast, topical treatment with 10 mM AG (Figure 2), 5 mM LNPA and 10 mM 7-NI (Figure 3) only significantly attenuated the
vasodilation in arterial anastomoses.

Effects of PV on vasodilation/hyperemia and BBB
disruption
As shown in Figure 5, topical treatment with 10 mM PV alone
further induced cerebral vasodilation and hyperemia during
reperfusion. Interestingly, PV significantly reduced both EB and
Na-F extravasations at 3 hours of reperfusion (Figure 6). In
addition, PV abolished the inhibitory effect of L-NAME on
cerebral vasodilation and hyperemia during reperfusion (Figure 5),
but didn’t affect the inhibitory effect of L-NAME on EB and Na-F
extravasations (Figure 6).

Effects of NOS inhibitors on BBB disruption
Since the ligation of the MCA in our new model was
complete with little individual variability, the extravasation of
EB and Na-F was steady and significant at 3 hours of
reperfusion in mice undergone MCAL compared with the
mice in Sham group (Figure 4). Topical treatment with
L-NAME completely prevented both EB and Na-F extravasations at 3 hours of reperfusion. Either L-NPA or 7-NI similarly
inhibited both EB and Na-F extravasations as L-NAME. In

beneficial in preventing early BBB disruption following
ischemic stroke.
A reliable animal model of transient focal cerebral ischemia is
critical to study the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke and
evaluate therapeutic approaches. Intraluminal occlusion of MCA
using a suture methodology has been extensively used due to a
minimal direct invasion to the brain [18]. However, the final
ischemic brain damage with this method could be variable due to
possible incomplete obstruction of CBF to the MCA territory.
Suture type, length of insertion and the anatomical variations at
the MCA origin are factors that may affect the obstruction of the
MCA [19,20]. Thus, a modified suture technique was suggested to
improve the consistency of MCAO model [21]. In present study,
focal cerebral ischemia was induced by directly ligating MCA at its
M2 segment. This new model has several strengths. First, a
complete obstruction of CBF to the MCA territory can be
identified under the surgical microscope. Second, the cranial
window makes the topical treatment possible, and thus avoids the
systemic influence of experimentally tested agonists/antagonists
and neuroprotective agents. Third, response of cerebral vasculature during either systemic or topical treatment of the drugs can be
measured in real time. However, it is important to note that only
cerebral cortex can be studied using this model since ligating the
MCA at M2 segment doesn’t obstruct the blood flow to striatum.
In addition, the cranial window impedes the possibility to study the
late ischemia/reperfusion injury.
There are various factors including mechanical factors, circulating stimuli, endothelium-derived vasoactive factors, and perivascular nerves that contribute to the tone of cerebral arteries
under basal conditions [22]. When focal ischemia occurs, dilation
of the pre-existing collateral arteries is a critical mechanism for
regional CBF rebuilding. The present study is the first to directly
show that cerebral vasodilation and hyperemia are substantially
induced during ischemia and reperfusion. In addition, we found
that the vasodilation appeared more prominent in/near the
terminal branches of MCA and anastomosing arteries indicating
that these arteries may be more critical for effective collateral
circulation remodeling. NO is an important signaling molecule
that regulates vascular tone [23]. It has been suggested that a burst
of NO generation occurs within the first few minutes after
ischemia [24,25] and this ischemia-induced NO overproduction
has been correlated with glutamate-mediated increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, which subsequently results in a
calmodulin-dependent activation of nNOS in the ischemic area
[26,27]. In addition to increased activity, there is also a transient
increase in the expression of both nNOS [28] and eNOS [29] in
the ischemic area, which may also contribute to the initial burst of
NO generation and NO-mediated vasodilation and hyperemia
[30]. Following the early and transient rise in NO formation, a
secondary wave of NO overproduction starts to develop several
hours after the initial ischemic insult and is sustained for up to 4–7
days [31,32]. This enhanced and prolonged NO release can be
entirely ascribed to the induced expression of iNOS in response to
locally produced inflammatory cytokines following ischemia with
or without reperfusion [33,34]. However, NO concentration is
transiently increased by 50% for about 30 minutes if reperfusion
occurs even when iNOS has not been induced [35,36]. A previous
study suggested that NO generation during early reperfusion was
mostly derived from eNOS [36]. In the present study, eNOSspecific inhibitor showed a strong inhibitory effect on cerebral
vasodilation during early reperfusion, whereas nNOS-specific and
iNOS-specific inhibitors only showed inhibitory effect on cerebral
dilation in certain branches of the MCA. Thus, although all three

parietal cortex and striatum punched at the peri-infarct area.
However, all three isoforms of NOS were not altered in either
parietal cortex or striatum at 3 hours of reperfusion (Figure 7).

Discussion
The present study developed a new transient focal cerebral
ischemia model to observe cerebral vasculature, measure CBF
and study BBB permeability. In addition, there are several new
findings from this study. First, reperfusion following focal
cerebral ischemia produced a sustained NOS-dependent
vasodilation and hyperemia, in which all three types of NOS
might be involved. Second, nNOS inhibitors have strong
inhibitory effect on the early BBB disruption. Third, early BBB
disruption following transient focal cerebral ischemia was not
related to the sustained vasodilation and hyperemia. Fourth,
PV significantly suppressed early BBB disruption following
transient focal cerebral ischemia. We suggest that nNOS may
play a major role in early BBB disruption following transient
focal cerebral ischemia via a hyperemia-independent mechanism. In addition, NO-independent vasodilators may be

collateral arteries during the entire ischemia. In addition, a
reversed blood flow from dilated collateral arteries and arterial
anastomoses was seen to supply the ligated artery. These findings
suggest that vascular endothelial cells may suffer a less hypoxia
than neurons and the surrounding support cells during ischemia.
Upon reoxygenation, thus, excessive NO and superoxide may be
mainly produced by neurons and/or the surrounding support
cells.
Hyperemia during reperfusion was reported to associate with
adverse events including BBB disruption in rat MCAO model
[12]. Since NO is potent vasodilator, excessive production of NO
during reperfusion may also lead BBB disruption via a sustained
hyperemia. In the present study, however, L-NIO significantly
inhibited cerebral vasodilation during reperfusion, but only
reduced small solute permeability of BBB. In addition, PV
preserved the inhibitory effect of L-NAME on cerebral vasodilation/hyperemia, but did not affect the inhibitory effect of LNAME on early BBB disruption. These findings suggest that
excessive production of NO during reperfusion leads BBB
disruption via a vasodilation/hyperemia-independent mechanism.
Since both early BBB disruption and postischemic hyperemia
associate with an excessive production of NO, it is not surprised to
find a correlation between hyperemia and early BBB disruption
[12]. Interestingly, we further found a reduced BBB disruption in
PV-treated group, in which the hyperemia was actually increased.

isoforms of NOS are involved, eNOS may play a major role in the
vasodilation and hyperemia during early reperfusion.
The present study identified the NOS isoform that plays the
major role in early BBB disruption following transient focal
cerebral ischemia. A recent study reported that preischemic
treatment with L-NAME was beneficial in preventing early BBB
disruption following transient focal cerebral ischemia [10]. In the
present study, L-NAME, topically given at 300 mM during
reperfusion, completely inhibited both cerebral vasodilation and
early BBB disruption. We further found that topical treatment
with L-NPA at 5 mM and 7-NI at 10 mM during reperfusion
produced similar inhibitory effect on BBB disruption as L-NAME.
In contrast, topical treatment with L-NIO at 10 mM and AG at
10 mM only had inhibitory effect on small solute permeability of
BBB. Although we only tested one dose for each specific inhibitor,
the dose is not a likely factor to make difference on BBB disruption
since L-NIO produced a stronger inhibition on cerebral vasodilation than L-NPA and 7-NI. Moreover, iNOS expression was not
upregulated at 3 hours of reperfusion. Thus, nNOS may play a
major role in early BBB disruption following transient focal
cerebral ischemia. Excessive production of NO during ischemia/
reperfusion may lead BBB disruption by altering protein
structure/function and/or through the formation of highly
reactive peroxynitrite. In the present study, an extensive vasodilation was found in the ligated MCA, arterial anastomoses and

There are several limitations in the present study. First, BBB
disruption also occurs between 24 hours to 72 hours of reperfusion. Due to the limitation of the model, late-stage BBB disruption
couldn’t be evaluated. Second, hyperemia during reperfusion may
be beneficial on preventing early BBB disruption. It would be
necessary to further study the mechanism. Third, while a lot of
people under 65 have strokes, ischemic stroke is common among
the elderly people. Cerebral vasoreactivity may be different

Thus, hyperemia during early reperfusion may be beneficial on
preventing early BBB disruption. The mechanism underlying the
beneficial effect of PA is not clear, but may be related to an
increased regional CBF, which may improve regional oxidative
status. Thus, a combined treatment with antioxidant, nNOS
inhibitor and NO-independent vasodilator during early reperfusion may lead to a better prognosis in patients with transient focal
cerebral ischemia.

animals were used in our studies, it would be necessary to further
evaluate the effect of NOS inhibitors and NO-independent
vasodilators on the BBB disruption in aged animals.

In summary, the present study determined the role of NOSs in
early BBB disruption following transient focal cerebral ischemia.
We suggest that nNOS-mediated NO may be responsible for the
