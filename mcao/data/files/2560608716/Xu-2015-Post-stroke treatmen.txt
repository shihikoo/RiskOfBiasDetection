a b s t r a c t
miR-181 has deleterious effects on stroke outcome, and reducing miR-181a levels prior to middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) was shown previously to be protective. Here we tested the effect of post-ischemic treatment
with miR-181a antagomir by intracerebroventricular and intravenous routes of administration on infarct size,
neurological outcome, inﬂammatory response and long term behavioral outcome. Post-treatment with
miR-181a antagomir signiﬁcantly reduced infarction size, improved neurological deﬁcits and reduced NF-κB activation, numbers of inﬁltrating leukocytes and levels of Iba1. Targets affected by miR-181a antagomir administered after stroke onset include BCL2 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). Post-treatment with
miR-181a antagomir signiﬁcantly improved behavioral outcome assessed by rotarod at one month. These
ﬁndings indicate that post-treatment with miR-181a antagomir has neuroprotective effects against ischemic
neuronal damage and neurological impairment in mice, and the protection is long lasting including recovery of
motor function and coordination over one month. The ability to protect the brain with post-treatment with
miR-181a antagomir with long lasting effect makes this a promising therapeutic target and may be an innovative
and effective new approach for stroke therapy.

Introduction
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and the
leading cause of long-term neurological disability. Although many clinical stroke trials have been completed, the only clinically efﬁcacious
treatment to date is thrombolysis (Blakeley and Llinas, 2007). Suggested
reasons for the many failures include the complex interplay among
multiple signaling pathways and intracellular organelles, interaction between different cell types, and the potentially short therapeutic window
for neuroprotection after stroke.
MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs. Mature
miRs are generated from primary miR transcripts by sequential endonucleolytic processing and act as posttranscriptional regulators of gene
expression including in the setting of cerebral ischemia (for review

see Ouyang et al. (2013)). Many miRs exist in families. The miR-181
family contains four highly conserved members, miR-181a, miR-181b,
miR-181c and miR-181d, which are derived independently from 6 precursors located on 3 chromosomes as identiﬁed using TargetScan
(http://targetscan.org).
Our previous study reported increased injury with increased levels
of miR-181 and a protective effect of reducing miR-181a levels using
antagomir when administered the day prior to middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) in male mice (Ouyang et al., 2012b). Reduced levels
of miR-181 were associated with reduced oxidative stress in in vitro ischemia (Ouyang et al., 2012a). Previously validated targets of miR-181
include the ER stress protein GRP78 (Ouyang et al., 2012b) and three
antiapoptotic proteins, BCL2, MCL1 (Ouyang et al., 2012a) and XIAP
(Hutchison et al., 2013). While treatment before stroke provides
evidence that anti-miR-181 can protect in acute stroke, treatment
after stroke onset will be needed in most cases, as patients often present
hours after stroke onset. Thus to assess potential translational relevance
we tested the effect of post-ischemic treatment with miR-181a
antagomir administered by intracerebroventricular (ICV) or intravenous (IV) injection in a transient focal cerebral ischemia model.
We assessed both short term and long term outcomes with posttreatment, including rotarod neurobehavioral assessment.

miRNA-181a antagomir
miRNA-181a antagomir and a negative control (mismatched (MM)miR-181a antagomir) were from Thermo Scientiﬁc (Hudson, New

Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(RT-qPCR)
RT-qPCR for miRNA quantitation in the brain tissue was reported
previously (Ouyang et al., 2012b). All materials were from Applied
Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol®,
then reverse transcription of equal amounts of RNA (200 ng) was
performed using the TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit and
1.3 mM dNTPs (with dTTP), 50 U reverse transcriptase, 10 U RNase inhibitor, and speciﬁc miRNA reverse transcriptase primers at 16 °C for
30 min, 42 °C for 30 min, and 85 °C for 5 min. PCR reactions were then
conducted using the TaqMan® MicroRNA Assay Kit at 95 °C for
10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min.
Each reaction contained 0.75 μl of the RT reaction product, 5 μl TaqMan
2 × Universal PCR Master Mix in a total volume of 10 μl using the
7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, South San
Francisco, CA, USA). Predesigned primer/probes for miRNAs and
mouse U6 were from Applied Biosystems. The expression of miR-181a
was normalized using U6 as the internal control. Measurements were
normalized to U6 (ΔCt) and comparisons calculated as the inverse log
of the ΔΔCT to give the relative fold change for all miRNA levels (Livak
and Schmittgen, 2001). Liu et al. have validated U6 as not changing in
cerebral ischemia (Liu et al., 2010). The PCR experiments were repeated
3 times, each using separate sets of samples.
Transient focal cerebral ischemia
All experimental protocols using animals were performed according
to protocols approved by the Stanford University Animal Care and Use
Committee and in accordance with the NIH guide for the care and use
of laboratory animals. Adult male CB57/B6 mice (25–30 g from Charles
River) were anesthetized with 2% isoﬂurane in balance O2 by facemask
and focal cerebral ischemia was produced by 1 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with a silicone-coated 6-monoﬁlament (Doccol
Co, Redlands, CA, USA) followed by reperfusion as described before
(Ouyang et al., 2012b). Sham-operated mice underwent an identical
procedure, without inserting the suture but tying off the ipsilateral
external carotid artery. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37 ±
0.5 °C controlled by a Homeothermic blanket control unit (Harvard
Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). Temperature and respiratory rate
were monitored continuously. Mice were randomized to surgery or
sham, and mice with no evidence of acute neurological deﬁcit or with
evidence of hemorrhage were excluded from analysis. A total of 220
mice were subjected to sham or MCAO surgery, 18 were excluded
from analysis, 12 animals died prior to day 7, 4 had evidence of hemorrhage, and 2 had no evidence of neurological deﬁcit acutely. After different durations of reperfusion, mice were deeply anesthetized, and brains
were removed after transcardiac perfusion with ice cold phosphate

Intracerebroventricular infusion (ICV) and intravenous injection (IV) of
181a antagomir
Two hours after MCAO miR-181a antagomir or control mismatch
antagomir (MM) was injected intracerebroventricularly as shown previously (Ouyang et al., 2012b). Mice were anesthetized and placed in a
stereotaxic frame with a mouse head holder. The brain infusion cannula
was stereotaxically placed into the left lateral ventricle (bregma:
− 0.58 mm; dorsoventral: 2.1 mm; lateral: 1.2 mm) via a burr hole
(Xiong et al., 2011) and afﬁxed to the skull. Antagomir (3 pmol/g in
2 μl ﬁnal volume) or MM (same amount) was mixed with the cationic
lipid DOTAP (4 μl; Roche Applied Science, San Francisco, CA). After
mixing for 5 s and incubating at 37 °C for 15 min, the mixture (total
6 μl) was infused into the left lateral cerebral ventricle over 20 min.
After that the bone wound was closed with bone wax. For intravenous
infusion, 1 h after MCAO miR-181a antagomir (30 pmol/g) or control
(MM) in sterile saline (100 μl) was administered into the internal
jugular vein. The schematic timecourse is shown in Fig. 1A.
Determination of infarct volume and neurological status
Cerebral infarction volume was determined after 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma, T8877, St. Louis, MO 63103, USA) staining of brains harvested at 48 h reperfusion. Four sections/mouse were
analyzed by a blinded observer, and corrected for edema using Adobe
Photoshop CS3 as described previously (Han et al., 2009). Neurological
status was assessed by a neurologic deﬁcit score at 24 h reperfusion
(Xiong et al., 2011). Neurological deﬁcit score: 0 — no observable
neurological deﬁcits, 1 — failure to extend right forepaw, 2 — circling
to the right, 3 — falling to the right, and 4 — cannot walk spontaneously.
Rotarod test
Motor coordination and learning were assessed with the accelerating rotarod (SD Instruments, San Diego, CA). Beginning on the ﬁrst
day of training and continuing every other day for a total of 9 training
days each mouse was placed on the 2.75 cm diameter rod with rotation
speed increasing from 5 to 10 rpm over 5 min. The time in which the
mouse was able to stay on the rotating rod before falling was determined up to a maximum duration of 300 s. The test was repeated
three times each day for each mouse, and the scores were averaged
for each day. Any mouse not able to achieve at least a 200 second average on the rotarod after 9 days of training was excluded from the study.
Rotarod testing was performed 3 days, and 1–4 weeks after surgery.
Immunohistochemistry
Ischemic or sham-operated mice were deeply anesthetized and
perfused with cold 0.9% saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) 24 or 48 h after MCAO. The
brains were kept in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 3 days
then cut into 50 μm sections with a vibratome (VT1000S, Leica
Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Sections were immunostained
using Polyclonal Rabbit Anti-Human Myeloperoxidase (MPO dilution
1:600, Cat # A03978 Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) to detect inﬁltrating
neutrophils, polyclonal antibody to Iba1 (Iba1, dilution 1:200, Cat #
019-19741 Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA, USA) to identify activated
microglia/macrophages, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)
antibody (1:500 dilution, catalog #3331, ProSci, Poway, CA, USA).
After staining, evaluation was done in a ﬁxed 1 mm × 1 mm area of
the penumbra. The penumbra was deﬁned as the region of generally
morphologically normal cells surrounding the core (see Fig. 1B). To
quantify levels of ﬂuorescence intensity 4 brain sections for each of

ﬁve animals per group were evaluated using ImageJ (National Institutes

counted in an area of 220 μM × 200 μM in the penumbra on 4 slides/
mouse for 5 mice/group.

Immunoblotting
Protein samples from the ipsilateral brain tissue were harvested 24 h
after MCAO. Immunoblotting was performed as shown previously
(Ouyang et al., 2012b). Equal amounts (50 μg) of protein were separated
on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, and electrotransferred to Immobilon
polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membrane. Membranes were blocked and incubated overnight with a primary antibody against GRP78 (1:10, PA1-

37806, Afﬁnity BioReagents), BCL2 (1:1000, #2870, Cell Signaling,
Danvers, MA, USA), XIAP (1:1000, catalog #3331, ProSci) and β-actin
(1:1000, #926–42,210, LiCOR Bioscience) and were washed and
incubated with secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the LICOR Odyssey infrared imaging system according
to the manufacturer's protocol. Densitometric analysis of bands was
performed using ImageJ software (NIH) and the intensity was normalized to β-actin.

cortices were dissected and placed in liquid nitrogen. Complete lysis
buffer AM2 from the TransAM NF-κB p65 Activity Assay kit (Active
Motif, Carlsbad, CA 92008, USA) was added to the tissue at a 1:5 ratio
and the mixture was sonicated for 5 s. In total 20 μl of the mixture
was added to each well and measured according to manufacturer's
instructions. All samples were run in duplicate. Data are presented as

Post-stroke treatment with miR-181a antagomir reduces inﬂammation
The signiﬁcant increase in activation of the inﬂammatory mediator
NF-κB at 24 h following MCAO was reduced by post-stroke IV injection
of antagomir relative to control injection (MM), though early activation
at 5 h reperfusion was not blocked (Fig. 4A).
MCAO causes signiﬁcant microglial/macrophage activation (increased IBa1 staining) in MM treated brains 48 h after MCAO compared
to sham (Fig. 4B, left panel). IV injection of miR-181a antagomir 1 h
following MCAO signiﬁcantly reduced this activation by about 60% compared to control (MM MCAO; Fig. 4, right panel). In sham-operated

Post-stroke ICV treatment with miR-181a antagomir reduces infarct
volume and reduces acute neurological deﬁcit
Antagomir treatment reduced miR-181a in the brain to very low
levels 24 h later by quantitative RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2A). Using the
same dose of miR-181a antagomir as used previously for pretreatment
(Ouyang et al., 2012b), antagomir or MM was administered ICV 2 h
after MCAO. The infarction size after miR-181a antagomir treatment
(31.9 ± 3.6%) compared to MM control group (49.4 ± 2.3%) was
reduced at about 35% (p b 0.05) at 48 h reperfusion (Fig. 2B) and the
neurologic deﬁcit at 24 h was signiﬁcantly improved (Fig. 2C).

Post-stroke-treatment with miR-181a antagomir improves long-term
recovery
Both miR-181a antagomir and MM groups of mice were able to learn
the rotarod task and by the 7th training day performance reached a plateau (Fig. 2D). Sham mice had similar rotarod performance immediately
before and after sham surgery and through 4 weeks of post-testing,
demonstrating that the mice achieved maximum performance prior to
surgery and sham surgery did not affect their ability to perform the
rotarod task when assessed beginning 3 days after anesthesia and
sham surgery. At 3 days after MCAO surgery there was a marked drop
in performance in both groups with MM group dropping more than
miR-181a antagomir group. With increasing time, the miR-181a
antagomir mice had greater recovery and reached that of sham by 21
days, while the MM mice still had a signiﬁcant deﬁcit in performance
which appeared stable by 21 days. Treatment with antagomir also
improved survival (Table 1). For the MM control group 5/22 animals
died by the end of 7 days, whereas in the antagomir treated group
only 2/21 mice died. No mice died between 7 and 28 days.

Post-stroke IV treatment with miR-181a antagomir reduces brain
miR-181a level and protects from MCAO
For clinical relevance we next tested IV administration to see if this
route could also provide protection. The time-course of change in the
brain miR-181a expression level following IV injection of miR-181a
antagomir is shown in Fig. 3A. miR-181a levels were signiﬁcantly reduced as early as 2 h following IV injection. Levels were still signiﬁcantly
reduced 24 h after IV treatment with antagomir (Fig. 3A). IV injection
of antagomir 1 h after MCAO signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume at
48 h by TTC staining (Figs. 3B and C). Neurologic deﬁcit score was also
signiﬁcantly improved following IV injection of miR-181a antagomir
(Fig. 3D).

brain, there are almost no myeloperoxidase (MPO) positive cells identiﬁed (left panel Fig. 4C). A marked increase in MPO positive cells was
observed following MCAO, indicating inﬁltration of inﬂammatory neutrophils (Fig. 4, left panel). MPO positive cell number was signiﬁcantly
reduced by post-stroke IV injection of 181a antagomir compared to
control (MM) (Fig. 4C, right panel).

miR-181a antagomir treatment increases BCL2 and XIAP
To further investigate the effects of miR-181a antagomir by IV posttreatment we examined levels of 3 known targets, GRP78 (Ouyang et al.,
2012b), BCL2 (Ouyang et al., 2012a), and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis
(XIAP; Hutchison et al. (2013)). Using Western blot we found no significant difference in GRP78 protein level between miR-181a antagomir
treated and MM treated brains (Fig. 5A). In contrast protein levels of
BCL2 and XIAP were modestly but signiﬁcantly higher in miR-181a
antagomir treated brains compared with the MM control, 24 h after
cerebral ischemia (Fig. 5A). To further conﬁrm the increased XIAP Western results we immunostained sections from post-stroke brain (Fig. 5B).
The brightness of the images was increased representing increased XIAP
expression in the miR-181a antagomir group after MCAO compared
with MM group.

Discussion
The main ﬁndings in this study are (1) post-stroke treatment with
miR-181a antagomir has neuroprotective effects against ischemic neuronal damage, and improves long-term neurobehavioral recovery in
mice; (2) both ICV and IV administrations were effective; (3) miR181a antagomir administered shortly after stroke reduces evidence of
inﬂammation and (4) miR-181a antagomir increases levels of BCL2
and XIAP but not GRP78 when given during reperfusion.
Previous studies have reported that miR-181a has anti-tumor effects
(Fei et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2008; Shin et al., 2011). In agreement with
those ﬁndings our recent work demonstrated that reducing miR-181a
prior to stroke protects brain cells from ischemic injury in vivo and
in vitro (Ouyang et al., 2012a,b). To further assess translational potential
we tested post-stroke treatment with both ICV and IV administrations.
We found that post-treatment with miR-181a antagomir by either
route signiﬁcantly reduced infarction size and improved neurological
deﬁcits. There are several reports from different labs of the effect of
pre-stroke treatment with individual miRNAs, but this is the ﬁrst report,
to our knowledge, testing post-stroke treatment or IV administration.
Several neuroprotective strategies have been shown to have transient effects. Dietrich et al. demonstrated that strong protection by
mild post-ischemic hypothermia seen at 3 days was reduced at 7 days

and absent at 2 months (Dietrich et al., 1993). Intraischemic isoﬂurane
treatment reduced infarct area acutely, but the effect was lost by
14 days (Kawaguchi et al., 2000). Thus assessment of long-term
outcome is essential. Here we show that when animals are allowed to
survive for 4 weeks after focal ischemia neurobehavioral performance
is signiﬁcantly improved in miR-181a antagomir treated mice.
The immune response is an important element contributing to the
fate of the ischemic brain (Harari and Liao, 2010; Iadecola and
Anrather, 2011) and the miR-181 family is implicated in immune
regulation in several studies. An earlier report found miR-181 increased
in B cells and overexpression in precursors increased the number of B
lineage cells (Chen et al., 2004). T cell sensitivity to peptide antigens
was found to be regulated by miR-181a (Li et al., 2007). A key element
of inﬂammation is activation of the master inﬂammatory transcription
factor NF-κB, which also plays a role in control of apoptosis (Harari
and Liao, 2010; Hoffmann and Baltimore, 2006).
A recent report demonstrated an anti-inﬂammatory effect of miR181a, direct down-regulation of IL1a, in monocyte and macrophage
cell lines (Xie et al., 2013). Other work showed an anti-inﬂammatory
effect of miR-181c in astrocytes exposed to LPS, and also validated
XIAP as a target of miR-181c (Hutchison et al., 2013). Although antiinﬂammatory effects of miR-181 family members have been reported,
these were in response to a pure pro-inﬂammatory stimulus, and differ
from our observations in the complex setting of stroke.
While our and others' results consistently show that miR-181 aggravates cell injury after stress (Hutchison et al., 2013; Ouyang et al., 2012a,
b) and miR-181 was shown to sensitize glioblastoma cells to apoptosis
by reducing BCL2 (Chen et al., 2010) this family clearly regulates both
cell death regulatory pathways and proinﬂammatory pathways, and
these pathways may overlap in signaling. The reduced inﬂammation
observed in our study with miR-181a likely reﬂects several factors.
First, the strong protective effect likely leads to a signiﬁcant reduction
in the induction of inﬂammation. Second, since miR-181 targets
proteins that affect mitochondria, improved mitochondrial function
may contribute directly to an anti-inﬂammatory effect (Voloboueva

et al., 2013) just as impaired mitochondria can contribute to inﬂammation (López-Armada et al., 2013).
Mitochondria are centrally involved in both ischemic injury and recovery of the brain tissue after cerebral ischemia due to their major
roles in ATP generation, ROS production and regulation of cell death
and inﬂammation. Both the heat shock protein 70 family (HSP70) and
the antiapoptotic BCL2 protein family inﬂuence mitochondrial function
and protect the brain from ischemia when overexpressed. miR-181 targets both families, HSP70 family member GRP78, and anti-apoptotic
BCL2 family members BCL2 and MCL1. Protection from ischemia with
pretreatment with miR-181a inhibitor was associated with improved
mitochondrial function (Ouyang et al., 2012a). The signiﬁcant increase
of BCL2 protein level in the miR-181a antagomir group suggests it is
likely one of the mechanisms reducing injury and improving mitochondrial function with possibly a secondary reduction in inﬂammatory
response.
It should also be mentioned that miR-181a affects different cell types
differently. Reducing miR-181a increased BCL2 as one of the targets and
increased the survival of primary astrocytes (Ouyang et al., 2012a) and
N2a cells (Moon et al., 2013) while it failed to signiﬁcantly change levels
of BCL2 and did not change outcome in primary neurons after ischemialike injury (Moon et al., 2013). Combined with the fact that expression
of the miR-181 family is strongly enriched in cultured astrocytes
compared to neurons (Hutchison et al., 2013) the protective effect of
anti-miR-181a in the present and earlier studies (Moon et al., 2013;
Ouyang et al., 2012b) may result signiﬁcantly from protection of astrocytes, in addition to possible direct protection of neurons.
Members of the miR-181 family are directly involved in the regulation of both apoptosis regulatory proteins (BCL2 family and XIAP) and
inﬂammatory mediators. Apoptosis regulatory proteins, especially the
inhibitors of apoptosis family and caspases are also involved in the
regulation of inﬂammation independent of cell death regulation, so it
is clear that the effects of altered miR-181 levels on survival and inﬂammation will depend on the cell type and the presence or absence of
other mediators, such as pro-inﬂammatory signaling. There is already
evidence that the functions of the miR-181 family members are not redundant, and disparate effects are observed in different cell types. This
work thus adds to current knowledge of the effects of modulating
miR-181a on brain injury.
The ability to reduce brain damage in both focal (Ouyang et al.,
2012b) and forebrain ischemia (Moon et al., 2013) as well as with either
pre- or post-stroke treatment, makes miR-181a antagomir a promising
target. Deﬁning the effective post-treatment window remains an important next step to investigate. The ability to reduce brain injury with
intravenous post-stroke treatment is encouraging for potential translation to clinical use.
