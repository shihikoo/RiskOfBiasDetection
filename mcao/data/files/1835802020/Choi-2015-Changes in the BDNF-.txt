BDNFþ cells in layer I was signiﬁcantly less than in layer II/III in the cingulate cortex and in
the motor and sensory areas. The increase in the number of BDNFþ cells in layer I 8 days after
MCAO was more remarkable than layer II/III, in all regions except the area of cingulate cortex
farthest from the infarct core. Only BDNFþ–Ox-42þ cells showed a tendency to increase
consistently toward the infarct core in both layers I and II/III, implying a major source of
BDNF for response to ischemic injury. The present study suggests that some beneﬁcial effects
during recovery from ischemic injury, such as increased supportive microglia/macrophages,
occur owing to a sensitive response of BDNF in layer I.

(Bothwell, 2014). BDNF is also involved in learning, memory,
and neuroplasticity (Nakai et al., 2014). Exogenous treatment
with BDNF, an enriched environment, or exercise, all of which
increase BDNF, facilitates recovery from brain injury (Schabitz
et al., 2007; Vaynman et al., 2003). Blocking BDNF by using
antisense nucleic acids abolishes exercise-induced cognitive
functional recovery after focal ischemia (Ploughman et al.,
2009). Finally, BDNF also promotes neurogenesis in the adult
brain (Pencea et al., 2001; Scharfman et al., 2005).
Several studies have reported the presence of neurogenesis
in the adult mammalian neocortex under pathological conditions such as brain injury and stroke (Jin et al., 2006; Leker
et al., 2007; Moraga et al., 2014). Interestingly, a recent study
showed that there are neural progenitor cells in neocortical
layer I of adult rats, which can differentiate to GABAergic
interneurons under ischemic conditions (Ohira et al., 2010).
Neocortical layer I is an important region in which the
feedforward and feedback information from other cortical
areas and subcortical regions can be integrated (Barbas et al.,
2013; Jiang et al., 2013), but the role of BDNF expressed in layer I
in recovery from ischemia is still not well understood.
According to several studies, the expression of neuronal
survival- or growth-associated proteins including BDNF peaks
at 7 days after cerebral ischemia (Batchelor et al., 1999;
Miyake et al., 2002). These protein changes correlate well
with ﬁndings that the critical period of stroke recovery ranges
from 1 to 2 weeks after injury (Murphy and Corbett, 2009).
Therefore, in the present study we examined quantitative
changes in BDNF immunopositive cells in neocortical layers I
and II/III of several neocortical regions at 8 days following
ischemic injury, during the period of maximal BDNF levels.
We also evaluated the type of cells primarily involved in the
change in BDNF following an ischemic event to elucidate
which cells play a greater role in the recovery progress.

2.

Results

Reperfusion after 1 h of occlusion produced an infarct around
25% of the total area of the brain slice at bregma (according to
the atlas of Paxinos and Watson, 2004), consisting of a large
portion of the cortex and striatum at day 8 after MCAO (Fig. 1A).

There was a peri-infarct area, the so-called penumbra, between
the intact area and infarct core, although the border was
difﬁcult to deﬁne (Fig. 1A and B). From the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining results, regions Cg1 and Cg2
of the brain slice at the level of bregma were mostly unaffected
by the ischemia, but M2 and M1 were predictably affected.
More speciﬁcally, in some rats of the MCAO group, these
regions were in the peri-infarct area, but in others, they were
partially within the infarct core. The S1 region was mostly
found to be in the infarct core after ischemic injury.
To examine differences related to ischemic injury, we
examined the number of BDNF-positive (BDNFþ) cells of
layers I and II/III in several cortical regions that showed the
amount of infarct damage. BDNFþ cells in a ﬁxed sized area
(100 μm  600 μm) were counted. The number of BDNFþ cells
was represented as a percentage of total cell count by DAPI.
Generally, the number of BDNFþ cells in layer I is signiﬁcantly
less than in the corresponding layer II/III of a given region in
sham animals (Fig. 1C and Fig. 2B).
MCAO signiﬁcantly increased the number of BDNFþ cells in
layer I as well as in layer II/III of all regions except Cg2 and the
increase in layer I was larger than that in layer II/III, although
total cell counts by DAPI were not increased in both layers of all
regions except S1. (Fig. 2A and B). When an increase was
represented as a ratio of the number of BDNFþ cells in the
MCAO to that in the sham condition (MCAO/sham ratio), the
ratio was greater in layer I than in layer II/III of all regions
except Cg2, such that the differences of the ratios between
layer I and layer II/III were statistically signiﬁcant (Fig. 2C).
To investigate the type of cells that are BDNF immunoreactive and responsible for generating the change in the
BDNF-positive cell population in layers I and II/III after MCAO,
the numbers of neurons (double-labeled with BDNF/NeuN),
astrocytes (BDNF/GFAP-labeled), and microglia/macrophages
(BDNF/Ox-42-labeled) were determined in the intact area,
peri-infarct area, and infarct core (Fig. 3). In infarct core, total
cell counts were signiﬁcantly higher than intact or periinfarct area in layer I and II/III (Fig. 3C). In layer I, the number
of BDNFþ/NeuNþ cells of the infarct core was signiﬁcantly lower than in the other two areas. The numbers of
BDNFþ/GFAPþ cells tended to be reduced toward the core. In
layer II/III, the numbers of BDNFþ/NeuNþ and BDNFþ/GFAPþ

cells of the infarct core were signiﬁcantly lower than those of
the intact and peri-infarct areas. However, the BDNFþ/GFAPþ
cells were more frequent in the peri-infarct area than in the
other two areas. Contrary to the other two cell types, the
numbers of BDNFþ/Ox-42þ cells tended to increase toward
the infarct core in both layers I and II/III coinciding with
the trend of total cell number. This result implies that
microglia/macrophages are key contributors to increased
BDNF expression after ischemia.

Discussion

The cerebral cortices of humans and rodents have a characteristic layered structure, such that the neocortex is commonly described as a 6-layer structure (DeFelipe et al., 2002).
Neocortical layer I, called the molecular layer, is composed
predominantly of extensions of dendrites of pyramidal neurons located in deeper layers, though it contains horizontally

80

brain research 1605 (2015) 76–82

oriented axons as well. It contains astrocytes and only a few
neurons (Shipp, 2007). Reﬂecting the small proportion of the
cellular component, the present results show that the number of BDNFþ cells in layer I was much less than that in layer
II/III in intact regions.
Interestingly, the present study showed a differential
change in the number of BDNFþ cells in layer I after ischemic
injury, when compared to layer II/III of the same region. Except
for the Cg2 region, which was farthest from the infarct core,
layer I of all regions investigated seemed more sensitive to
ischemic injury in terms of BDNF-immunoreactivity than layer
II/III. Considering the structural architecture of layer I, dendritic
and axonal connections receive feedback inputs from the
cortex, as well as inputs from the thalamic nuclei (Barbas
et al., 2013) and other subcortical regions. Moreover, the apical
dendrites of pyramidal neurons in layers II–VI reach layer I
(Lund and Wu, 1997). Thus, layer I is an important region in
which the feedforward and feedback information from higher
cortical areas, as well as from other lower cortical areas and
subcortical regions, could be integrated (Jiang et al., 2013; Zhu
and Zhu 2004). Recently, the roles of the interconnection of
layer I with other layers and subcortical structures have been
elucidated with regards to somatosensation, cognition and fear
learning (Barbas et al., 2013; Letzkus et al., 2011; Petreanu et al.,
2012). Therefore, the sensitive response of BDNF in layer I to
ischemia may facilitate the layer's recovery from the injury,
necessary to restore its critical functions.
Only BDNFþ/Ox-42þ cells showed a strong tendency to
increase in both layers I and II/III toward the infarct core,
suggesting that BDNF is expressed predominantly by microglia/macrophages in the injured area. Post-ischemic microglial
proliferation peaks at 48–72 h after focal cerebral ischemia, and
may last for several weeks after the initial injury (LalancetteHebert et al., 2007). In addition, blood-derived macrophages are
recruited into the ischemic brain tissue most abundantly at
days 3–7 after stroke (Jin et al., 2010). Since the brain samples
were obtained at day 8 after MCAO in this study, it is hard to
determine which cells expressed BDNF, because Ox-42 does
not discriminate between microglia and macrophages, and
both can express BDNF (Barouch et al., 2001; Yan et al., 1997).
Although the post-ischemic activation of microglia can be
either beneﬁcial or detrimental, there is growing evidence that
after ischemic injury, microglia could be neuroprotective (Eyo
and Dailey, 2013; Neumann et al., 2006; Sohrabji and Williams,
2013) and promote adult neurogenesis (Kim et al., 2009). One of
the mediators of these effects in immune cells is BDNF
(Madinier et al., 2009). The number of BDNFþ/NeuNþ cells
was consistently reduced towards the core, while BDNFþ/
GFAPþ cells demonstrated a similar tendency, except for an
increase in layer II/III of the peri-infarct area. Taken together,
the present results imply a major role of microglia/macrophages in BDNF activation as a response to ischemic attack,
especially in layer I. However, the role of BDNF released from
microglia or macrophages should be investigated closely.
Neurogenesis in the CNS of adult mammals has been of
particular interest to the ﬁeld of neuroscience. A recent study
suggested that neural stem cells in neocortical layer I are a
source of adult neurogenesis under ischemic conditions
(Ohira et al., 2010), although prior to these data, adult
neurogenesis was known to occur in two regions: the

subventricular zone (SVZ) and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of
the hippocampus (Lim and Alvarez-Buylla, 1999; Oomen
et al., 2010). A series of recent studies have indicated that a
brain insult evokes neurogenesis in various brain regions,
such as the hippocampal cornu ammonis region, striatum,
and cortex (Ohira, 2011). Factors that increase BDNF in the
brain such as exercise and stroke have been proven to
modulate neurogenesis in these regions (Abrous et al., 2005;
Tonchev, 2011). Therefore, the normally quiescent local
progenitors in neocortical layer I may be activated after
ischemia, giving rise to new interneurons through a BDNFsensitive mechanism.
In conclusion, the present study showed that BDNF
immunoreactivity in cortical layers is sensitive to ischemia
and the level of immunoreactivity in layer I was more
sensitive than that in layer II/III. In addition, the increase in
BDNF immunopositive cells was primarily due to microglia/
macrophages. This sensitive response of BDNF in neocortical
layer I could be beneﬁcial in recovery after ischemic injury.

Experimental procedures

4.1.

Animals

Male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 280–320 g at the time of
surgery were housed in groups of three per cage at 2273 1C,
with a 12/12-h light-dark cycle and laboratory chow and water
available ad libitum. After 7 days of acclimation, the rats were
subjected to focal cerebral ischemia by middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO). All animals were treated in accordance with
the animal care guidelines of the Korean Academy of Medical
Science. All experimental procedures were approved by the
Committee for Animal Experimentation and the Institutional
Animal Laboratory Review Board of Inje University.

4.2.

Induction of focal cerebral ischemia

Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced by MCAO, a
commonly used surgical procedure for this purpose. MCAO was
achieved as described previously with some modiﬁcations
(Longa et al., 1989; Nagasawa and Kogure, 1989). Brieﬂy, rats
were anesthetized with a mixture of tiletamine/zolazepam
(0.8 mL/kg, Zoletil 50; Virbac, France) and xylazine (0.5 mL/kg,
Rompun; Bayer, Germany). The right common carotid artery
was exposed and carefully dissected free of the vagus nerve.
The right external and internal carotid arteries were also
isolated. The external carotid artery was then ligated at the
distal end and cut off. A 4-0 nylon thread precoated with silicon
resin (Xantopren Bayer Dental, Osaka, Japan) was aseptically
introduced into the right carotid artery in an anterograde
fashion towards the carotid bifurcation. It was then directed
distally up to the right internal carotid artery to a distance of
about 20 mm from the carotid bifurcation to occlude the origin
of the middle cerebral artery. After 1 h, the thread was withdrawn for reperfusion. All animals experienced ischemia for
1 h and then underwent reperfusion. Rectal temperature was
maintained at 3770.5 1C throughout the surgical procedure
using a thermostatically controlled warming plate and overhead lamp. For sham-operation, all surgical procedures were

brain research 1605 (2015) 76–82

same but the nylon thread was not inserted. All animals were
anesthetized and killed via transcardial perfusion 8 days after
MCAO. The brain was carefully removed, dissected into 2-mmthick coronal sections, and immersed sequentially in a 2%
solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) in normal
saline at 37 1C for 20 min.

4.3.

Immunohistochemistry and image quantitation

Anesthetized animals were perfused transcardially with 9.25%
sucrose followed by 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer
8 days after MCAO. The brains were removed quickly and then
immersed in same ﬁxative solution for 6 h at 4 1C. The ﬁxed
brains were frozen and sliced into 10-μm coronal sections by
using a cryostat (HM 525, Thermo Scientiﬁc, USA). After blocking with goat serum for 2 h, the sections were incubated with
primary antibodies against NeuN (1:700, Chemicon, USA), GFAP
(1:700, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), Ox-42 (1:500, Millipore, USA) and
BDNF (1:500, Santa Cruz biotechnology, USA) diluted in Trisbuffered saline (TBS) containing 1% BSA (w/v) and 0.025%
Triton-X 100. The sections were incubated overnight at 4 1C
and then rinsed in TBS and incubated with Cy3 (1:500, Amersham, USA) and FITC (1:300, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) conjugated
secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The sections
were then rinsed in TBS and mounted in aqueous mounting
medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, USA). Cell counts of
immunopositive cells for BDNF, NeuN, GFAP, and Ox-42 were
determined using ImageJ software (NIH, USA), in which cells
were counted in a ﬁxed-size rectangular box (100 μm  600 μm).
To exclude extracellular or non-speciﬁc signals, only BDNFpositive cells counterstained with the nuclear marker DAPI
were counted.

4.4.

Statistical analysis

Quantitative data were expressed as the mean7standard error.
Statistical comparisons were conducted using Student's t-test
and Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Mann–Whitney U-test. A
value of po0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.
