Abstract Microglia, resident immune cells in the brain, contribute both to the damage and resolution of ischemic stroke.
However, the mechanisms of microglia's detrimental or beneficial role in the disease are poorly understood. The voltagegated proton channel, Hv1, rapidly removes protons from
depolarized cytoplasm, and is highly expressed in the immune
system. In the brain, Hv1 is selectively and functionally
expressed in microglia but not neurons. Although the physiological function of microglial Hv1 is still not clear, Hv1 is one
of major ion channels expressed in resting microglia. Under
pathological conditions, microglial Hv1 is required for
NADPH oxidase (NOX)-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by providing charge compensation for
exported electrons and relieving intracellular acidosis. In a
mouse model of cerebral middle artery occlusion, Hv1 knockout mice are protected from ischemic damage, showing reduced NOX-dependent ROS production, microglial activation
and neuronal cell death. Therefore, microglial Hv1 aids in
NOX-dependent ROS generation, which subsequently induces
neuronal cell death and a significant fraction of brain damage
after ischemic stroke. These studies illuminate a critical role of
microglial Hv1 in ischemic brain injury, providing a rationale
for Hv1 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of
ischemic stroke. The current understanding of Hv1 in ischemic
injury through NOX-dependent ROS production may serve as
a common model to reveal the deleterious role of microglia in
neurological diseases other than ischemic stroke, such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and neuropathic pain.

Introduction
Microglia are the principal resident immune response cells in
the brain and play important roles in both physiological and
pathological brain functions [1, 2]. During ischemic stroke,
microglia are the primary initial responders, followed by the
recruitment of the circulating immune cells of the inflammatory response [3]. However, the detrimental or beneficial role
of microglia in ischemic stroke is still debated. Reactive
molecules containing oxygen (reactive oxygen species
[ROS]) are produced in ischemic brain and react with lipids,
proteins, cofactors and DNA, in turn activating apoptotic
pathways [4, 5]. Therefore, oxidative stress produced by damaged neurons and glia is one of the major mechanisms leading
to cell death [6, 7]. Among several sources of oxidative stress
in the brain, NADPH oxidase (NOX) is a membrane–bound
enzyme that is abundantly expressed in phagocytic cells,
including microglia [8]. NOX-mediated ROS production in
microglia may have evolved as a defense against invading
bacteria, but it nonselectively damages bystander cells such as
neurons and glia in the brain [9, 10]. Indeed, NOX and ROS
are consistently reported to participate in the pathogenesis of
cerebral ischemic injury; NOX1, 2 or 4 knockout mice exhibit
less brain injury after stroke [11–14]. Thus, reducing NOXrelated oxidative stress could ameliorate neuronal damage in
ischemic stroke.
During microglial activation in ischemic stroke, NOX generates superoxide by transferring electrons across the membrane, rapidly depolarizing and acidifying these cells. As
excessive depolarization and intracellular acidification inhibits further expulsion of electrons, charge-compensating
and acidosis-relieving mechanisms are needed to maintain
NOX activity [15, 16].
The voltage-gated proton channel, Hv1, a recently cloned
ion channel highly expressed in microglia, can rapidly remove
protons from the depolarized cytoplasm [17–19]. By sensing
both voltage and pH gradients, Hv1 is ideally suited to the task
of charge compensation for NOX activation. Hv1 is activated

100

only upon depolarization, but the amount of depolarization
needed is inversely proportional to the pH gradient. Thus, the
larger the pH gradient, the less depolarization is needed to
activate Hv1. This dual dependence on voltage and pH is a
consequence of the interactions between water molecules in a
central cleft of Hv1 and its voltage sensor [20], and is the
unique feature of Hv1. This means that upon cell acidification,
less depolarization from rest is required to allow protons to
exit the cell, exactly the conditions under which NOX is active
during ischemia.
Indeed, genetic deletion or inhibition of Hv1 greatly reduced
NOX–dependent ROS production in leukocytes and bone marrow cells [21, 22]. In a mouse model of ischemic stroke, Hv1
knockout (Hv1 −/−) mice are protected from ischemic damage,
showing reduced microglial activation and neuronal cell death
[23]. The mechanisms that involve NOX and Hv1 in brain
microglia act in concert to produce ROS via the channel's
effectiveness in maintaining cytoplasmic charge balance after
NOX-mediated export of electrons. Therefore, experimentally
induced ischemia elicits ROS production from microglia that
damages neurons and perhaps other brain cells. Hv1 is a crucial
component of this response since elimination or inhibition of
Hv1 reduces cell damage in cell culture, in brain slices, and in
intact animals [23]. In this review, I set out to summarize the
recent studies on microglial Hv1 in neuronal damage in ischemic brain injury. Based on these studies, it is proposed that Hv1
could serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of
stroke and oxidative stress–related brain disorders.

depletion of phagocytic microglia exacerbates brain damage
72 h after MCAO in neonatal mice [29]. (2) In addition, exogenous microglia injection in brain improved neuronal survival
and behavioral function after MCAO in adult rats [30, 31].
Therefore, it is difficult to distill a simple single function
for microglia in ischemic stroke. The consensus is that microglia may play different roles at different stages of stroke
insult; the pro-inflammatory cytotoxic aspects of activated
microglia might be important early in stroke while microglia's
anti-inflammatory effects become more prominent later, during tissue repair. However, signals that trigger the phenotypic
conversion of neurotoxic microglia to neurotrophic microglia
remain to be elucidated. In spite of the controversy, it is clear
that microglia play an important role during ischemic stroke
and thus are in need of further study. What could be the
mechanisms underlying neuroprotective or neurodegenerative
functions of microglia in ischemic stroke? We know that
microglia are activated in ischemic stroke and release a plethora of microglial factors. Some of these are neurotoxic, including ROS, nitric oxide (NO), glutamate, matrix metalloproteinases, and cytokines, like tumor necrosis factor alpha
(TNFα), IL1β, IL6. Microglia also release a number of neurotrophic factors, which include brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β),
IL10, and IL12. These trophic factors released from microglia
are critical in tissue repair/remodeling, phagocytosis of cell
debris, and in maintaining neuronal integrity after an ischemic
insult [3, 24]. In the current review, I will focus on the
neurotoxic effects of microglial ROS in ischemic stroke.

Microglia in Ischemic Stroke
Microglia-Derived ROS in Ischemic Brain Injury
Microglial activation and inflammation are hallmarks for brain
injuries during ischemic stroke. However, the role of microglia
in ischemic stroke is hotly debated, as both detrimental and
beneficial effects of microglia in stroke brain injury are well
documented [3, 24]. Literature has shown the microglia are "the
bad guys" or "the good guys" in ischemic stroke using genetic
ablation or pharmacological inhibition of microglia. For example, previous studies have highlighted deleterious effects of
microglia on neurons in vitro and brain injury during stroke
in vivo: (1) Microglia conditioned medium after experimental
ischemia, oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), induces neuronal
cell death in vitro [25]. Similarly, in microglia–neuron coculture, microglia directly induced neuronal cell death under
OGD conditions [23]. (2) Inhibition of microglial activation by
minocycline reduces inflammation and protects against both
global and focal cerebral ischemia with a wide therapeutic
window [26, 27]. In contrast, experiments also showed that
microglia are neuroprotective during schemic brain injuries:
(1) Ablation of endogenous proliferating microglia increased
neuronal cell death and ischemic injury 72 h after middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in adult mice [28]. Similarly,

ROS are one of the most studied neurotoxic factors that can be
released by microglia under ischemic conditions. Various
ROS include superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite,
hypochlorous acid, carbonyl radical, and hydroxyl radical.
ROS target DNA, membrane lipids, phosphatases/kinases,
transcription factors, and ion channels to exert cell toxicity
[4]. There are three major sources of ROS production: (1) the
mitochondrial electron transport chain, which "leaks" about
1–2% of its electrons; (2) unfolded proteins with disulfide
generate ROS during the unfolded protein response; and (3)
NOXs, including five NOXs (Nox1–5) and two dual oxidase
NOX variants. NOX generates superoxide by transferring
electrons across the membrane. NOXs are activated in response to stimulation of associated receptors, such as those
for TNFα, platelet-derived growth factor, nerve growth factor,
the antibody Fc chain, and complement [8].
OS production by microglia occurs primarily by NOX activation. The NOX complex includes six protein components:
two membrane-bound components (gp9phox and p22phox) and
four cytosolic components (p67phox, p47phox, p40phox, and Rac)

Transl. Stroke Res. (2014) 5:99–108

[8]. Free electrons exported by NOX form superoxide in
phagocytic compartments and in the extracellular space; these
reactive oxygens can be converted to hydrogen peroxide and
then to hypochlorous acid [15]. Originally designed to kill
invading microbes, NOX-derived ROS play a key role in host
defense, which is manifested in chronic granulomatous disease,
an inherited disease with most loss-of-function mutations in
major NOX subunits [32]. Although effective in clearing infection, the NOX system can be harmful to the host system,
inflicting damage to bystander cells, and thus is a key component in neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation. During ischemic
conditions, microglial NOX-mediated ROS production is reported to induce cell death of neurons, astrocytes and endothelial cells [23, 33]. In addition, several groups have shown that
NOX knockout mice (NOX1, NOX2 and NOX4) or inhibition
of NOXs by apocynin have smaller infarcts than do wild-type
mice after ischemic stroke [12–14, 34]. Considering the high
expression of NOX in microglia, it is plausible that microglial
NOX may play a crucial role in brain damage after ischemic
stroke. NOXs are also expressed in cell types other than microglia in the brain. Therefore, mice with microglia-specific
knockout of NOX are needed to address whether microglia
directly account for the protective effect of NOX deletion or
inhibition. It is important to note that ROS are not entirely
detrimental, as emerging evidence has shown their beneficial
effects in tissue repair and remodeling following ischemic
injury [28]. In particular, ROS as cerebral vasodilators may be
beneficial when they are generated at low levels in the vicinity
of the cerebral vascular wall [3, 35]. Therefore, the function of
microglial ROS may depend on the temporal and spatial generation of ROS in the ischemic brain.

Microglia Expresses Voltage-Gated Proton Channel Hv1
Voltage-gated proton currents were first described in snail
neurons [36], but a gene encoding a protein with voltagedependent, proton selective flux was only recently identified
as Hv1 [17, 18]. The human voltage-gated proton channel,
Hv1, contains 273 amino acids. The predicted structure of
Hv1 channel protein has four transmembrane domains (S1–
S4) without a typical S5–S6 pore domain; both the N and C
termini are intracellular. Mutagenesis studies identified that
three arginine residues in S4 are responsible for voltage gating, while two histidine residues are required for extracellular
inhibition of Hv1 by Zn2+ [17]. Hv1 is the most selective ion
channel known, showing no detectable permeability to other
ions. The ion selectivity filter of Hv1 channel is believed to be
comprised of aspartate 112 in S1 and arginine 211 in S4 [37,
38]. Hv1 is a dimer and the cytosolic domain of the channel is
necessary and sufficient for dimerization. Interestingly, each
subunit of the Hv1 dimer is functional and has a separate
permeation pathway with its own pore and voltage sensor

101

[39]. Recent studies showed that the opening of the two
pathways in Hv1 channels is highly cooperative, which involves interactions between the two subunits of the Hv1 dimer
to initiate the conformational change during activation [40].
Hv1 is highly expressed in the cells of immune system [18].
Not surprisingly, studies have shown that Hv1 is critical for
immune function. For example, Hv1 is reported to regulate B
cell receptor signaling and antibody production [41], neutrophil
migration [42], T-cell homoeostasis [43], basophil histamine
release [44], and eosinophil activation-induced cell death [45].
Interestingly, Hv1 also regulates acid secretion from airway
epithelium [46] and human spermatozoa [47]. In the mammalian nervous system, whether Hv1 is functionally expressed in
neurons and glia is largely unknown. The voltage-gated proton
current has been characterized in cultured microglia [48–50],
while its presence in situ (i.e., within the brain) is debated [51,
52]. Recent studies found that Hv1 is selectively expressed in
microglia but not neurons [21, 23]. Consistently, the electrophysiological results directly show that Hv1 is the sole ion
channel mediating the voltage-gated proton current in microglia
but not in neurons or astrocytes in the mouse brain (Fig. 1a).
The current is largely reduced by Zn2+, the known inhibitor of
Hv1, and is completely abolished in mice deficient in Hv1 −/−
microglia (Fig. 1a) [23].
Three points on the presence of Hv1 in the brain are worth
noting. (1) Although snail neurons exhibit rapidly activating
proton-selective currents [36], the gene encoding this invertebrate channel has not been identified. In contrast, proton
currents have rarely been reported in mammalian neurons.
An Hv1-like current was reported in cultured hippocampal
neurons, but the current was neither blocked by Zn2+ [53] nor
confirmed in another study using acute hippocampal slices
[23]. Therefore, it is unlikely that Hv1 functions as a membrane voltage-gated proton channel in mouse hippocampal
neurons. (2) Compared with neurons, microglia express fewer
ion channels [54]. Under resting conditions, Hv1 is a major
functional ion channel along with K+ and Cl− channels. The
function of microglial Hv1 is not noticeably regulated by
development after birth, as the Hv1-mediated proton current
persisted in both neonatal and adult microglia [23], although
an immunostaining study suggests the developmental upregulation of microglial Hv1 expression [21]. (3) Hv1 showed
surprising species variations. For example, the voltage-gated
proton current is much smaller in rat microglia compared with
those in mouse microglia [23, 51]. Considering that mouse
and rat Hv1 share 89% homology in protein sequence, it
would be informative to understand the mechanisms underlying the functional difference between mouse and rat Hv1. In
addition, it was also shown that human but not mouse sperm
cells express functional Hv1 [47]. Thus, although a voltagegated proton current was observed in cultured human microglia [23], the existence of functional Hv1 needs to be further
confirmed in human brain tissue in situ.

of Hv1 activation is quite stringent, requiring both intracellular acidosis and membrane depolarization.
Are there any physiological/pathological conditions that are
able to activate Hv1? Interestingly, there is indeed one known
condition, NOX activity during respiratory burst, which is associated with both intracellular acidosis and membrane depolarization (Fig. 2b) [15]: (1) NOX activation induces electron
transfer across the membrane, which depolarizes the membrane.
The best estimate of the membrane depolarization during the
respiratory burst was +58 mV in neutrophils [57]. The depolarization could even reach 190 mV within 20 ms if there is no
charge compensatory mechanism [16]; (2) during NOX activation, protons are left behind as electrons are transported across
the cell membrane. Indeed, NOX activity induces a sharp decrease in cytoplasmic pH in human neutrophils during phagocytosis [58]. Hexose monophosphate shunt activity is believed
to be a source of electrons and protons for the respiratory burst
[59]. Together, NOX activation associated with membrane depolarization and intracellular acidosis seem sufficient to activate
Hv1. On the other hand, NOX is inhibited by membrane depolarization and by intracellular acidosis [15]. Therefore, to maintain NOX activity, particularly under constant activation such as
respiratory oxidation, there must be mechanisms to compensate
for the charge transfer and to relieve intracellular acidosis.
Obviously, Hv1 is ideally suited for this function in cooperation
with NOX. Consistent with this idea, accumulated evidence
indicates that Hv1 is coupled to NOX-dependent pH regulation,
membrane depolarization, or ROS production in a variety of
cells, including neutrophils [42], B cells [41], and eosinophils
[45]. In microglia, NOX and Hv1 are cooperatively activated;
the Hv1 −/− microglia show intracellular acidosis when NOX is
activated by PMA and other proton extrusion pathways are
inhibited. More importantly, Hv1 is required for NOXdependent ROS production (Fig. 1c) [23].

What is the cellular function of Hv1 in brain microglia? The
Hv1 channel is activated by membrane depolarization and
mediates outward proton current. Therefore, Hv1 affects,
and potentially regulates, intracellular pH. As distinct from
other proton extrusion pathways, such as the sodium proton
exchanger (NHE) and sodium bicarbonate co-transporter [55],
the Hv1 channel is unique in that (1) proton extrusion through
Hv1 requires not only intracellular acidosis but also membrane depolarization; (2) Hv1-mediated proton extrusion is
much more efficient than exchangers or transporters. Due to
the requirement of membrane depolarization, Hv1 is not usually required to maintain pH homeostasis under resting condition as wild-type and Hv1 −/− microglia show similar basal
intracellular pH (Fig. 1b) [23, 42]. Even when there is a
dramatic drop in the intracellular pH (~6.5), Hv1 channels
are not activated to correct the acidosis. However, when there
is membrane depolarization (such as induced by increasing
the extracellular K+ concentration), Hv1 could promptly relieve the acidosis (Fig. 1b) [23]. Therefore, without membrane
depolarization, it seems that proton transfer mechanisms other
than Hv1 channel, particularly the NHE1, are playing a critical
role in pH homeostasis [23, 56]. Together, recent studies
indicate that Hv1 is able to function as an efficient pH regulator, but might do so only under conditions of strong membrane depolarization (Fig. 1b). This raises three points: (1)
since all the studies were performed in cultured microglia and
intracellular acidosis was artificially induced, the hypothesis
needs to be confirmed under more physiological conditions
from microglia in situ or in vivo; (2) as Hv1 is not ubiquitously expressed, its function in pH homeostasis is assumed to be
limited and unique. Obviously, Hv1 is more efficient than
NHE1 when both are activated [23, 56]; (3) the requirement

MCAO are shown. b Diagram showing Hv1 function in microglial

are the first responders during ischemia, preceding leukocyte infiltration.

Activated microglia produce ROS through activation of NOX, primarily
NOX2. Hv1 is required for full activation of NOX2, by serving a charge
compensation function, as well as by removing intracellular H+. In the
mouse brain, Hv1 is highly expressed in microglia but not neurons or
astrocytes. Microglial Hv1-related ROS production partially contributes
to neuronal cell death in early stages of ischemic stroke

It is evident that Hv1 can provide compensating charge or
relive intracellular acidosis for NOX [16, 60, 61]. In the
absence of Hv1, however, do other ion channels/transporters
also perform this function? Certainly there is a wealth of ion
channels that could balance the charge; voltage-gated K+
channels, Ca2+-activated K+ channels, and Cl− channels have
all been proposed to act in this regard [62–64]. However, Hv1
has a distinct advantage over other channels for this function,
as the operation of other channels would result in osmotic
changes with swelling (K+ influx) or shrinking (Cl− efflux)
while proton current can balance electron flux without net
osmotic change [15]. Many studies also suggest that NHE1
functions as a pH regulator during NOX activation in neutrophils and in cultured microglia [56, 58, 65]. However, it is still
unclear the respective contributions of Hv1 and other ion
channels/transporters (K + channels, Cl − channels, and
NHE1) to coupling with NOX function. Nonetheless, although Hv1 is ideally working with NOX, it seems alternative
mechanisms exist, which are reasonable given the critical role
of the NOX system in immune function.

function in the immune system using the knockout mice.
Unexpectedly, Hv1 −/− mice were able to clear several bacterial
infections in vivo including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, despite a significant reduction in superoxide production [22]. The lack of a
bacterial infection phenotype in the Hv1 −/− mice may be due
to redundant mechanisms for bacterial clearance. For example, both superoxide- and NO-dependent systems are shown
to function synergistically for bacterial clearance in vivo [66].
However, Hv1 −/− mice showed defective B cell responses and
impaired antibody production [41]. The mechanism involves
the regulation of B cell receptor-mediated ROS production
and its downstream signaling, Syk, Akt and SHP-1 by Hv1
activation. A recent study also found that Hv1 −/− mice have
autoimmune disorder phenotypes, such as splenomegaly, autoantibodies and nephritis [43]. The phenotype might be due
to the impaired T-cell homoeostasis, although T cells express
very low density of functional Hv1 [67]. Since Hv1 is
expressed in almost all cell types in the immune system, future
studies employing cell-specific Hv1 deletion are required to
dissect the role of Hv1 in immune function.
In the brain, microglial cells are the only resident cell type
that highly expresses Hv1. Therefore, it is an advantage to use
general Hv1 −/− mice to study microglial Hv1 function in the
brain. Given that Hv1 is one of major ion channels in microglia,
it is easy to step back and examine the role of microglia in the
brain if we want to understand Hv1 function. Traditionally,
microglia were largely implicated in pathological conditions,
including ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's
disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated

Microglial Hv1 in Brain Damage in a Mouse Model
of Ischemic Stroke
At the cellular level, Hv1 is able to regulate intracellular pH
and is coupled with NOX to produce ROS. Then what would
be the function of Hv1 in vivo? To answer the question, Hv1 −/
−
mice were generated by both the Clapham and Okumura
laboratories recently [21, 22]. Most studies focused on Hv1

104

dementia, neuropathic pain, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and Nasu-Hakola disease
[7, 68]. However, recent studies also suggest an interesting role
for microglia in nervous system development and maintenance
[69, 70]. In theory, microglial Hv1 could be involved in any of
these pathological and physiological functions of microglia
in vivo. Currently, only microglial Hv1 function in the ischemic
stroke has been reported (Fig. 2a) [23], although studies on
microglial Hv1 in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease as
well as neuropathic pain are ongoing.
The rationale to study microglial Hv1 in ischemic stroke
comes from the role of NOX the in disease [3, 34, 71]. As
discussed above, earlier studies have shown that NOX1, 2, 4
knockout mice showed less ischemic brain damage [11–14].
As NOX2 is highly expressed in microglia and Hv1 is coupled
to NOX2 activation, it is possible that Hv1 −/− mice may be
protected in this disease. Indeed, Hv1 −/− mice exhibited small
infarct volume and better neurological behavior associated
with brain injury, compared with those in wild-type mice after
MCAO, a commonly used mouse model of ischemic stroke
[23]. The protective effects were observed by TTC staining in
brain slices as well as in vivo MRI and PET imaging (Fig. 2a).
The protection was long lasting, even observed 7 days after
MCAO. Also, the reduced brain injury in Hv1 −/− mice was
confirmed in MCAO, both with permanent occlusion and
transient occlusion followed by reperfusion. Further study
found decreased neuronal cell death in the penumbra of the
ischemic brain from Hv1 −/− mice [23]. Together, these results
convincingly indicate that Hv1 −/− mice are protected in ischemia and show decreased neuronal damage, suggesting a critical role of microglial Hv1 in enhancing neuronal cell death
and ischemic brain injury.

Microglial Hv1 in Neuronal Injury in Ischemic Stroke
The next question is how microglial Hv1 activation leads to
neuronal cell death and ischemic injury? One major mechanism for ischemia-induced brain damage is NOX activation
and ROS generation [3, 71]. Microglia become activated and
NOX cytosolic subunits translocate to the membrane to be
functional in response to ischemia. Therefore, it is conceivable
that microglial Hv1 contributes to ischemic brain damage via
the NOX pathway. Indeed, the idea is supported by several
lines of evidence [23]. First, NOX-dependent ROS production
after experimental ischemia, OGD, was significantly reduced
in Hv1 −/− microglia compared with wild-type microglia.
However, release of NO, glutamate, and cytokines such as
TNFα, IL1β, and IL6 is comparable between wild-type and
Hv1 −/− microglia after OGD. Second, ROS production in
brain microglia in situ after stroke was reduced in Hv1 −/−
mice. Third, reduced neuronal death and brain damage were
observed in Hv1 −/− mice compared to wild-type mice after

Transl. Stroke Res. (2014) 5:99–108

stroke. Fourth, OGD-induced neuronal death in microglia
(Hv1 −/−)-neuron co-cultures was less than in wild-type cocultures. Fifth, both Hv1 and NOX2 are upregulated after
MCAO. Finally, ROS scavenger rescue from ischemic damage was less prominent in Hv1 −/− mice. Taken together, these
results suggest that Hv1 plays a critical role in microgliaderived ROS generation that accounts for a significant amount
of brain injury that occurs after experimental stroke in mice
[23]. The redox-sensitive targets for ROS in neuronal cell
death include lipids, membrane receptors, intracellular kinases
and phosphatases, as well as pro-apoptotic transcription factors [4]. Since Hv1 −/− mice have normal synaptic transmission, plasticity, and unaltered NMDA receptor function, glutamate neurotoxicity is unlikely to underlie the mechanism for
Hv1's contribution to brain damage after stroke [23]. TRPM2
and TRPM7 channels are particularly interesting ROS targets
as both ion channels are implicated in stroke-related neuronal
cell death [72–74].
Thus, the function of Hv1 is coupled to NOX activation,
ROS production, and subsequently neuronal cell death in the
ischemic brain [23]. Hv1 proton channel plays two critical
roles in cooperating with NOX: compensating electron charge
and relieving intracellular acidosis (Fig. 2b). Although Hv1 is
ideally suited for this function, an alternative mechanism
might be employed in the absence of Hv1. For example,
NHE1 is shown to be able to correct NOX-induced intracellular acidosis and thus also is involved in NOX-dependent
ROS production [56]. In addition, it is reported that inhibition
or partial genetic deletion of NHE1 also protected the brain
from ischemic damage, likely via the NOX pathway [75].
During ischemia, cells rapidly acidify; in simple summary,
reduced delivery of oxygen to mitochondria impairs ATP
production, triggering anaerobic glycolysis that generates
H+. Therefore, a mechanism that reduces cell acidification,
such as the Hv1 or NHE1 function, should relieve ischemic
damage. However, Hv1−/− mice or NHE1+/− mice are
protected from ischemic damage [23, 75]. These results suggest that Hv1 or NHE1's detrimental function in coupling with
NOX surpasses their beneficial role in relieving intracellular
acidosis. As for Hv1, it could rapidly correct cell acidification,
but this requires that the cells depolarize and possess sufficient
numbers of Hv1 channels. Microglia and neurons differ greatly in both respects. Neurons frequently depolarize and can
acidify, but lack Hv1 channels. Thus, Hv1's deleterious contribution to ischemic damage is not via neurons themselves.
Hence, activation of microglial Hv1/NOX may only increase
the stress on neurons, without providing benefit in the absence
of infection.
Another interesting point is that the activation of microglial
Hv1 channels is able to release protons into the extracellular
space. This could be a route for activation of neuronal acidsensing ion channel (ASICs) as: (1) ASICs are proton-gated
ion channels that are abundantly expressed in central neurons

Transl. Stroke Res. (2014) 5:99–108

and are highly sensitive to extracellular acidosis [76, 77]. (2)
Under ischemic conditions, there is intracellular acidification
due to anaerobic glycolysis. If Hv1 is activated, a significant
amount of protons can be released. (3) The protons released
from Hv1 are able to acidify the small extracellular space if the
proximity between microglia Hv1 and neuronal ASICs are
close. Coincidently, both ASIC1a knockout mice and Hv1 −/−
mice show a reduced brain damage phenotype after ischemic
stroke [23, 78]. These results indirectly suggested a possible
link between microglial Hv1 and neuronal ASICs. The idea
that protons released from microglial Hv1 causes neuronal cell
death via activation of neuronal ASICs is provocative. Several
caveats need to be addressed. (1) Morphological evidence of
the close proximity between microglial Hv1 and neuronal
ASIC1a should be provided using electron microscopy. (2)
The extracellular acidosis after microglial Hv1 activation
should be tested using pH-sensitive dyes or fluorescent proteins. Electrophysiology would be able to directly measure
ASIC activation by protons released from microglial Hv1. (3)
Considering the limited number of microglia in the brain, it is
still questionable whether protons released from microglial
Hv1 are the major source for activation of neuronal ASICs
in ischemic brain.

Hv1 in Other Cell Types Contributes to Stroke Damage
All cell types in the brain possess NOXs, and mice deficient in
NOX1, NOX2 or NOX4 have better stroke outcomes [11–14].
Astrocytes comprise a significant proportion of cells in the
brain, perhaps as high as 50% in rodents. Astrocytes express
NOX 1, 2 and 3 [79] and toxic stimuli, such as β-amyloid,
could activate astrocytic NOX to evoke neuronal death [80].
However, questions remain to be answered about Hv1's potential role in astrocytes. First, it is not known whether ischemic stroke activates astrocytic NOX. Second, the expression
of Hv1 in astrocytes has not been confirmed. Considering the
low expression of Hv1 in whole brain lysates, it seems unlikely that Hv1 is expressed in astrocytes [23]. Moreover, no
measurable Hv1 current was observed in astrocytes in brain
slices. Even if there is functional Hv1 in astrocytes, whether
Hv1 or other channels may be required for charge compensation for NOX activation in astrocytes must be tested. In
contrast, astrocytes may have protective roles in ischemia by
reducing neuronal oxidant stress. For example, astrocytes
support neuronal glutathione metabolism, release ascorbate,
and take up its oxidized form, dehydroascorbate [81].
Circulating phagocytic cells such as neutrophils and macrophages express functional Hv1 and may contribute to ROS
generation. Large numbers of circulating blood cells enter the
brain tissue at late stages after stroke in mice or humans (~2
days after MCAO) [82–85]. However, the time course and the
degree of the recruitment of inflammatory cells may vary

105

depending on different animal stroke models (e.g., permanent
or transient MCAO) [86]. Bone marrow transplantation experiments suggest that microglial Hv1, but not leukocyte Hv1,
contribute to ischemic brain damage, at least at early time
points after MCAO in mice [23]. Interestingly, NOX inhibition has been reported to protect against cerebral damage by
alleviating neutrophil infiltration [34]. Migration in response
to a bacterial peptide is impaired in Hv1 −/− neutrophils [42],
but Hv1 −/− microglia have normal ATP-induced chemotaxis
and MCP-1- or TNFα-induced migration [23]. Nevertheless,
it is unlikely that microglia are the only sources of ROSmediated ischemic brain damage since ROS are released from
all metabolically stressed mitochondria.

Hv1 as Therapeutic Target for Treatment of Ischemic
Stroke
Despite tremendous effort in the search for effective therapies,
limited treatments for ischemic stroke are available [6]. Given
the acceptance of NOX-mediated ROS production as a mechanism for neurotoxicity, its inhibition would likely benefit
patients. However, recent studies using NOX inhibitors in
experimental stroke show conflicting results, perhaps due to
poor NOX selectivity [6, 13]. Hv1 channels may be more
tractable targets for prevention of brain injury during ischemia. Hv1 is a relatively simple homodimer [39, 87], whereas
NOX is assembled as a complex of diverse proteins [8].
Furthermore, since Hv1 conducts 10–100 protons for every
NOX electron transfer, there are presumably many fewer Hv1
channels per NOX complex [15]. The lower number of Hv1
molecules requiring binding for inhibition might translate into
lower doses of therapeutics. Notably, Hv1 inhibitors would
only target microglia but not neuronal NOX in the brain. Thus,
Hv1 represents a new and unique potential target, which could
be extended to other ischemic disorders and neurodegeneration, such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
Alzheimer's disease, and neuropathic pain. Moreover, developing pharmacologic tools for Hv1 will unravel the physiological and pathological roles of Hv1 in vitro and in vivo.
However, we have to be aware of the beneficial role of both
microglia and NOX-dependent ROS in ischemic stroke. For
example, microglia may exert important protective effects by
producing IL-10 and TGF-β, as well as growth factors in the
post-ischemic brain [88]. Similarly, NOX-dependent ROS
may also have beneficial effects in tissue repair and remodeling following ischemic injury [28]. The role of microglial
ROS probably depends on its temporal and spatial generation
in the ischemic brain. Therefore, the dual protective/
destructive effects of microglia and ROS should be considered. In addition, a potential side effect of targeting Hv1 in
stroke treatment is the possible immunosuppression, considering the critical function of Hv1 in the immune system. Post-

106

stroke immunodepression and the resulted increase in infections have been considered a major determinant of poor neurological outcome. Although our previous study showed that
Hv1 −/− mice do not have a bacterial infection phenotype, poststroke infections in these mice should be further investigated
when targeting microglial Hv1 for stroke treatment.

Conclusion and Future Directions
Hv1 is a newly discovered ion channel that is mainly
expressed in the immune system to support NOX activity in
innate immunity. In the brain, Hv1 is highly and selectively
expressed in microglia and is one of the major ion channels in
resting microglia. The cellular functions of microglial Hv1
include pH regulation and NOX-dependent ROS production.
The physiological or pathological significance of Hv1 in vivo
is largely dependent on the phenotypes of Hv1 −/− mice. In the
ischemic brain, it is believed that microglial Hv1 is coupled to
NOX activation, thereby generating ROS and causing neuronal cell death. However, it is unlikely that the Hv1 or microglia evolved to be detrimental to the brain; the plausible explanation is that microglial Hv1 exert their innate immune response during stroke insults, which is associated with damage
to neurons. Microglial Hv1 might also have beneficial roles in
tissue repair and remodeling following ischemic injury. Neuroprotective or neurodegenerative function of microglial Hv1
may depend on the cue it receives during stroke progression.
Understanding Hv1 physiology will help elucidate the role
of microglia in the brain. In addition, Hv1 might represent a
novel therapeutic target for treatment of ischemic stroke and
other neurological disorders related to ROS and neuroinflammation. Future studies are needed to address the following
critical questions about Hv1's function in the brain. (1) Functional Hv1 expression in human brain. Due to the species
differences, it is important to determine the presence of Hv1
in human brain. (2) NOX-independent mechanisms of Hv1
function in microglia. It is unlikely that Hv1 participate only in
support of NOX activation in microglia. In addition, Hv1 does
not seem to be involved in pH homeostasis under normal
conditions. (3) The function of microglial Hv1 in the late stage
of ischemic stroke. It is still speculative that microglial Hv1
may play a beneficial role in recovery from stroke. (4)
Microglial Hv1 functions in neurological diseases, such as
multiple sclerosis, ALS, Alzheimer's disease, and neuropathic
pain. Currently, Hv1 function in the brain was only reported in
a mouse model of ischemic stroke. Its role in other pathologies
needs to be investigated. (5) The role of microglial Hv1 in
neurodevelopment and maintenance. Physiological function
of microglia in the brain has drawn significant attention in
recent years. As a major ion channel in resting microglia, it
would be interesting to know whether microglial Hv1 function
in neuronal circuits. (6) The development of selective Hv1

inhibitors. Currently, zinc is the mostly used inhibitor for Hv1
research. Recently developed guanidine derivatives (such as
2-gunaidiniumbenzimidazole) are potent for voltage-sensitive
domain of Hv1 channel [89]. However, these compounds bind
Hv1 channel from the intracellular side of the membrane and
thus do not appear to have therapeutic potential. Future studies
using high throughout functional screening might be helpful
to identify Hv1 inhibitors with higher affinity and selectivity
for the channel.
