mechanisms, the expression level of apoptosis, inﬂammation and autophagy-related markers
in brain tissue were detected with kits or by western blot. It was observed that w007B rapidly
and signiﬁcantly reduced caspase-3 activity and NO production in the injured semi-brain, and
also lowered the level of the p65 subunit of NF-κB in the nucleus. Besides, it also reduced the
expression of Beclin-1 and LC3B-II, and increased the level of p62, the autophagy-related
proteins in I/R-injured hemisphere. In conclusion, w007B exerts neuroprotective effect on
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury with wider therapeutic time window and better safety;
its mechanisms may be associated with its anti-inﬂammation, anti-apoptosis and antiautophagy action. These results suggest that w007B shows strong potential as a clinical
neuroprotective candidate for the treatment of ischemic stroke.

(Roger et al., 2012). Although some effective thrombolytic
agents have been applied in the treatment of acute ischemic
stroke (Blakeley and Llinas, 2007), many victims without
effective treatment suffer serious physical and cognitive

brain research 1558 (2014) 100–108

disabilities, due to a further progression of neuronal damage
after Ischemia–Reperfusion (I/R) (Goldstein and Rothwell,
2008). Therefore, neuroprotective therapy during ischemia
and reperfusion is considered as a crucial strategy to reduce
neuronal damage. Numerous clinical trials of neuroprotective
agents in acute stroke have failed after promising results in
animal models (Lo, 2009) and the need for clinically effective
neuroprotective drugs is still very strong.
Honokiol is the main biphenyl neolignan isolated from the
cortex of Magnolia ofﬁcinalis used in traditional Chinese medicine
(Peng et al., 2010). Honokiol shows neuroprotective effects
through various mechanisms, including anti-apoptosis (Yang
et al., 2013), anti-inﬂammation (Zhang et al., 2013), antioxidation (Hu et al., 2006), anti-platelet aggregation (Pyo et al.,
2002) and disturbing PSD95–NO interaction (Hu et al., 2013).
However, its poor solubility and narrow therapeutic index restrict
its application (Wang et al., 2011). w007B (Beijing Honghui New
Medical Technology Co. Ltd., 2013), a newly synthesized derivative of honokiol, has a greatly improved water-solubility. This
study aims at investigating the effects of w007B on cerebral I/R,
its acute toxicity and main mechanisms of action.

the infarct volume to 31.073.6% and 12.172.4%, respectively
(Fig. 2B). The inhibitory percent of infarct volume for 10 mg/kg
and 50 mg/kg w007B was about 35.2% and 74.6%, respectively.
Besides, w007B reduced the neurological deﬁcit scores in a
dose-dependent manner, consistent with the effect on the
infarct volume (Fig. 2C). In addition, 10–50 mg/kg w007B signiﬁcantly decreased brain water content (Fig. 2D).
In order to assess the therapeutic time window of w007B,
brain infarct volume, neurological deﬁcit scores and brain
water content in rats treated with w007B were measured 0, 1,
3 and 5 h after reperfusion (2, 3, 5, and 7 h after ischemia).
Infarct volume was observed 24 h after reperfusion (Fig. 3A,
white region), and w007B administered 0–3 h after reperfusion effectively reduced infarct volume (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of
infarct volume at 0, 1 and 3 h was measured at 74.6%, 67.1%
and 27.3%, respectively. w007B reduced the neurological
deﬁcit scores in a time-dependent manner (from 0 to 3 h
after reperfusion or 2 to 5 h after ischemia) (Fig. 3C).
In addition, w007B signiﬁcantly decreased brain water content when administered 0 or 1 h after reperfusion (2 or 3 h
after ischemia) (Fig. 3D).

Assessment of preliminary acute toxicity

Results

2.1.
Cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) monitoring of
LDF measurement
Filament occlusion and laser-Doppler ﬂowmetry (LDF) measurements were performed as described in Section 4. A
minimum reduction of 70% of the initial LDF reading was
considered as a successful occlusion of middle cerebral artery
(MCA) (Fig. 1).

w007B protected brain against I/R injury

To detect the effect of w007B against I/R injury, vehicle or
agents were immediately administered after reperfusion
(single IV bolus). In middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
model group, the infarct volume was 47.872.8% (Fig. 2A,
white region). The infarct volume for 2 mg/kg w007B was not
signiﬁcantly reduced. 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg w007B reduced

To determine the preliminary acute toxicity, w007B and its
precursor honokiol (1000  50 mg/kg) or vehicles were administered to mice by a single dose of intraperitoneal injection
(IP). No abnormal symptoms were observed for animals
treated with w007B and vehicles. However, mice treated with
honokiol showed depressive status, such as hypokinesia and
lethargy, 60% of mice were dead within 6 d (Table 1). Body
weights of mice treated with w007B and vehicles in the two
weeks did not show signiﬁcant variation (Fig. 4). These results
suggest that w007B presents a lower toxicity than honokiol
but further studies are needed to obtain a more complete
safety assessment.

2.4.

w007B inhibited caspase-3 in I/R-injured hemisphere

In order to explore the underlying mechanisms of w007B's
action, an investigation of its potential inhibition of cell
apoptosis induced by ischemia–reperfusion injury was conducted. Caspase-3 activity in semi-brain tissue was detected
by colorimetric assay. The caspase-3 relative activity was
expressed as the fold of sham operation group, it was 3.597
0.4 and 1.8570.62 for model rats and for 50 mg/kg of w007Btreated rats, respectively. The results showed that caspase-3
relative activity was signiﬁcantly decreased by w007B, indicating an inhibitory effect of w007B on apoptosis (Fig. 5).

2.5.
w007B decreased NO production and nuclear p65
subunit of NF-κB in I/R-injured hemisphere

Fig. 1 – CBF monitoring during ﬁlament occlusion. The laser
Doppler probe was located 4–5 mm lateral and 1–2 mm
posterior to Bregma. PU: perfusion units.

The results showed that nitric oxide (NO) level was signiﬁcantly
increased in I/R semi-brain (0.6870.16 mM/mg tissue) compared
with that in sham operation brain (0.1070.01 mM/mg tissue),
and NO level in w007B-treated brain tissue was signiﬁcantly
reduced (0.1770.02 mM/mg tissue) (Fig. 6A), that is, w007B
reduced NO production by 87.9%.

Then the inﬂuence of w007B on NF-κB pathway activation
in I/R semi-brain was examined. The results showed that the
level of nucleus p65, one subunit of the NF-κB, was elevated
in I/R-injured hemisphere to about 3.5 fold compared with
ipsilateral hemisphere of the sham operation. w007B signiﬁcantly reduced the elevated p65 expression (from 3.5070.99
to 1.4570.14) (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that w007B may
also act on the signaling pathways related to inﬂammation.

2.6.

w007B inhibited autophagy in I/R-injured hemisphere

To investigate whether w007B can also inhibit the autophagy
induced by I/R injury, we examined the expression level of
several proteins related to autophagy. Concurrent increase of
both Beclin-1 and LC3B-II and decrease of p62 represents
activation of autophagy. The results showed that the relative
expression of both Beclin-1 and LC3B-II were signiﬁcantly
increased in I/R semi-brain, and w007B signiﬁcantly reduced
the elevated expression of the two proteins (Fig. 7B and C)
by 70.3% and 57.5%, respectively. Additionally, the relative

expression of p62 protein was decreased in ipsilateral hemisphere, and w007B signiﬁcantly elevated the level of p62
compared with I/R model (Fig. 7D). These results imply that
w007B may also confer the neuroprotective effect via inhibition of autophagy activated by I/R injury.

Discussion

Honokiol is a compound with neuroprotective activity (Lin
et al., 2006), but has some limits in application for clinical
trials (Wang et al., 2011). w007B was synthesized as a honokiol
precursor presenting a much higher water-solubility. This
study demonstrates that its pharmacological effect on cerebral
I/R injury in rats remains prominent.
Our results showed that w007B markedly improved neurological deﬁcit, reduced both infarct volume and brain
edema when given by single IV bolus after reperfusion.
We also simultaneously observed the effects of honokiol and
three agents clinically applied in China (positive controls).

The dose of both w007B and honokiol were 50 mg/kg.

w007B (50 μg/kg) reduced the infarct volume by 74.6%, which is
similar to the results obtained with honokiol in the same mole
dose, and the three positive agents (edaravone, 3 mg/kg;
butylphthalide, 50 mg/kg; and nimodipine, 1 mg/kg) which
reduced the infarct volume by 62.8%, 60.6% and 61.2% respectively. Besides, the effect on neurological deﬁcit scores was
similar to that on infarct volume (Fig. 2), suggesting that w007B

has more potent neuroprotective effect than these positive
agents. In order to detect the therapeutic time window, w007B
was administered at 0, 1, 3 and 5 h after reperfusion. The
results showed that it signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume
when given at 0–3 h after reperfusion (2–5 h after ischemia)
(Fig. 3), suggesting that the therapeutic time window is at least
3 h after reperfusion or 5 h after ischemia.

In order to evaluate the safety of w007B, mice were treated
with a single dose w007B (1000 times the highest effective
dose). No sign of toxicity or mortality was observed, in

contrast with honokiol which, used in the same method,
resulted in the death of 60% of the mice within 6 d. These
ﬁndings strongly suggest that w007B may be safer than
honokiol.
Apoptosis has been implicated in cerebral ischemic injury
(Charriaut-Marlangue et al., 1998) and honokiol has been
proved to inhibit endothelial cell apoptosis (Zhang et al.,
2007). As a honokiol derivative, w007B may inﬂuence the
process of apoptosis. Some studies have shown that caspase3 acts as an effector caspase and determines the incidence of
apoptosis (Du et al., 1997). In order to investigate the effect
of w007B on apoptosis induced by I/R injury, the activity
of caspase-3 was monitored. Results showed that w007B
reduces caspase-3 activity in I/R-injured hemisphere by 67.2%
(Fig. 5). This observation suggests that w007B may exert its
neuroprotective effect through the inhibition of neuronal
cells apoptosis.
NO is an important cytotoxic factor in the process of
inﬂammation (Liu et al., 2002). Our previous studies showed
that honokiol inhibited NO production in gial cells induced by
LPS (Zhang et al., 2013) and in cortical neurons induced by
glutamate and glycine (Hu et al., 2013) and it was therefore
supposed that w007B, as a honokiol derivative, may have
a similar action mechanism. w007B was indeed found to
markedly reduce NO level in I/R tissue (Fig. 6A), which
suggests inhibition of NO production during I/R. In addition,
NF-κB plays a key role in the initiation of inﬂammation
(Hyun-Ja et al., 2010) and is involved in I/R injury (Khan
et al., 2012). It has been demonstrated that NF-κB is activated
after transient MCAO, as revealed by the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit p65 (Chen et al., 2009). We observed
that w007B inhibited the level of the p65 subunit of NF-κB in
the nucleus by 82.0% (Fig. 6B). These data suggested the
inhibition of w007B on inﬂammatory response may be one
of crucial mechanisms against I/R injury.
Autophagy has been demonstrated to be involved in
cerebral injury induced by ischemic stroke (Adhami et al.,
2006). Beclin-1 and LC3 have been reported as two reliable
markers in the study of autophagy (Rami et al., 2008;
Mizushima et al., 2010). LC3 is expressed as three isoforms
in mammalian cells, LC3A, LC3B and LC3C, but only LC3B-II

correlates with increased levels of autophagic vesicles (Barth
et al., 2010). In addition, the autophagy-related protein p62/
SQSTM1 is selectively incorporated into autophagosomes
through direct binding to LC3, then degraded by autophagy,
namely, the p62 protein is unable to be cyclically used
(Komatsu et al., 2007). Monitoring of the levels of Beclin-1,
LC3B-II and p62 revealed a decrease of both Beclin-1 and
LC3B-II, and an increase of p62 levels in the w007B-treated
tissue, compared with vehicle-treated tissue. These observations suggest that w007B may exert its inhibitory effect
by inactivating autophagy through decreasing Beclin-1 and
LC3B-II, and increasing the level of p62, and thus achieve a
cerebral protective effect.
In conclusion, this study provides some evidence that
w007B, a newly synthesized derivative of honokiol, signiﬁcantly protected rats against ischemia–reperfusion induced
brain injury. Besides, w007B has a therapeutic time window
of at least 3 h after reperfusion or 5 h after ischemia. Moreover, it is less toxic than its precursor honokiol. It may exert
neuroprotective effect, at least partly, through inhibiting the
processes of inﬂammation, apoptosis and autophagy in I/Rinjured brain. All data suggest that w007B can be further
developed as a clinical neuroprotective candidate in ischemic
stroke.

MCAO reperfusion model in rats

Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as described previously
(Hu et al., 2013) under anesthesia with chloral hydrate
(350 mg/kg, IP), the ﬁlament was removed 2 h after MCAO.
Sham-operated control rats received the same procedure
except ﬁlament induction. The body temperature of rats
was maintained and monitored at 3770.5 1C by holding
operation table, and relative regional Cerebral Blood Flow
(rCBF) was monitored with laser Doppler measurement (PeriFlux System 5000) during the surgery. A minimum reduction
of 70% of the initial reading of LDF was considered as a
successful occlusion of MCA perfusion territory (DiNapoli
et al., 2006).
Experiment 1: Ninety rats were randomly assigned to nine
groups: sham group, vehicle group (normal saline), w007Btreated groups in different doses (2, 10, 50 mg/kg), honokioltreated group (28.5 mg/kg), edaravone-treated group (3 mg/kg),
NBP-treated group (50 mg/kg) and nimodipine-treated group
(1 mg/kg), 10 rats per group. Vehicle or agents were administered
immediately after reperfusion intravenously.
Experiment 2: Sixty rats were randomly assigned to six
groups: sham group, vehicle group (normal saline), w007Btreated groups at different time points (0, 1, 3, 5 h after
reperfusion), 10 rats per group. Animals were treated at
different times after reperfusion intravenously.
Neurological deﬁcit was evaluated 24 h after reperfusion
according to the Longa's method (Longa et al., 1989). Then the
brains were dissected and cut into 5 coronal slices, 2-mm
each, the slices were incubated in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Amresco, USA) for 15 min at 37 1C,
according to the previous method (Bederson et al., 1986) with
slight modiﬁcation, followed by immersion-ﬁxation in 4%
paraformaldehyde. TTC-stained sections were photographed
and the digital images were analyzed using image analysis
software (NIH ImageJ software). Infarct areas were ﬁrst
measured using image analysis software and then compiled
to obtain the infarct volume (mm3) per brain. The lesion
volumes were calculated as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere volume to compensate for the effect
of brain edema using the following formula (Tatlisumak
et al., 1998):
f½total infarct volume
 ðthe volume of intact ipsilateral hemisphere
 the volume of intact contralateral hemisphereÞ
=contralateral hemisphere volumeg  100%:

Cerebral edema extent was determined by measuring
the brain water content according to the wet–dry method
as described in previous reports (Chao et al., 2010) with some
modiﬁcations. In brief, brains were immediately weighed to
obtain wet weight after removal, then dried in an oven at
110 1C for 16 h and weighed again to obtain the dry weight.
Brain water content was calculated as follows:
Brain water content ð%Þ
¼ ½ðwet weightdry weightÞ=wet weight  100%:

4.4.

Preliminary acute toxicity

Forty ICR mice were randomly assigned to four groups:
w007B-treated group, vehicle control group (normal saline),
honokiol-treated group, and vehicle control group of honokiol
(solution A). Following a single dose of the agents (50 mg/kg;
IP), mice were observed for 14 d. All the animals were
weighed before the treatment and the following days. Mortality, survival times (days) and symptoms induced were
recorded within 14 d.

4.5.

Determination of casepase-3 activity

The inﬂuence of w007B on I/R-induced apoptosis was evaluated
by detecting the activity of caspase-3 using a Colorimetric Assay
Kit (KeyGen Biotech, Nanjing, China). Proteins were extracted
from fresh ischemia ipsilateral cortical samples 24 h after
reperfusion. Tissues were homogenized in cold lysis buffer
containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA,
0.1% Triton 100, 2 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM PMSF. The
homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000g for 30 min at 4 1C,
and the supernatants were collected. The protein concentration
was determined by BCA assay (M&C Gene Technology, Beijing,
China) and adjusted to 10 mg/ml. Then 500 mg proteins were
added to 50 ml 2  reaction buffer supplement with 5 ml
caspase-3 substrate and incubated at 37 1C away from light
for 4 h. Caspases-3 activities were quantiﬁed spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 405 nm. The activity of caspase-3 was
expressed as the fold of the activity of sham group.

4.6.

Determination of inﬂammatory markers

The inﬂuence of w007B on I/R-induced inﬂammatory molecule
of NO was determined by 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (DAN; Fluka)
as previously reported (Misko et al., 1993). In brief, cerebrum
was collected and homogenized in cold PBS; the supernatant
was obtained by centrifugation at 1000g for 10 min. All procedures were performed at 4 1C. Supernatants were either used
directly or stored at  80 1C. Protein concentrations were
determined by the BCA method, and 100 ml of the supernatants
of brains tissue supernatants was transferred to 96-well plates,
mixed immediately with the solution of DAN (20 μl; 50 μg/ml in
0.62 M HCl), and incubated for 15 min in the dark at 25 1C. The
ﬂuorescence was measured with a FlexStation3 microplate
reader with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 450 nm after
adding NaOH (100 ml; 0.28 M). The nitrite concentration was
determined based on the standard regression line for NaNO2.
The nuclear translocation level of p65 subunit of NF-κB was
detected through western blotting, nucleus proteins extracted
with cold Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (CWBIO,
Beijing, China) were analyzed by Western blot. Western blot
procedure followed standard protocols (Shimamura et al., 2006).
Shortly, 35 μg of total protein were separated in 12% SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and blotted onto
PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Antibodies
included Mouse anti-NF-κB p65 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), mouse anti-Histone H1 (1:500,
Zhongshan Golden Bridge Bio-technology, Beijing, China) and
appropriate secondary antibodies (1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Protein bands were detected with

brain research 1558 (2014) 100–108

a chemiluminescent reagent (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
Optical density of the bands was quantiﬁed in Image Lab
software, and the housekeeping protein Histone H1 was used
as a control and tested simultaneously by mouse monoclonal
anti-Histone H1 antibody.

4.7.

Determination of autophagy-related proteins

The effect of w007B on I/R-induced autophagy by western blot
analysis with autophagy speciﬁc antibodies against Beclin-1,
LC3B-II and p62, proteins extracted from the brains in cold
RIPA Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton
X-100, 1% C24H40O4 Na, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM Na4P2O7, 25 mM
β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4 and 1 mM PMSF) were
subjected to Western blot analysis. Western blotting procedure followed standard protocols (Shimamura et al., 2006):
35 μg of total protein were separated in 15% or 12% SDS-PAGE
and blotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA). Antibodies included rabbit anti-Beclin-1 antibody
(1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA),
rabbit anti-LC3B antibody (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA), rabbit anti-p62 antibody (1:500, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), mouse anti-β-actin
(1:1000, Zhongshan Golden Bridge Bio-technology, Beijing,
China), and appropriate secondary antibodies (1:5000, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Protein bands
were detected with a chemiluminescent reagent (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA). Optical density of the bands was quantiﬁed in Image Lab software, and the housekeeping protein
β-actin was used as a control and tested simultaneously by
mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody.

Statistical analysis

All data were expressed as mean7SEM. The one way ANOVA
was used to assess differences among groups, Signiﬁcant
differences between groups at each time point were assessed
by Student's t-test. Po0.05 was considered to be statistically
signiﬁcant.
