The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has a potential role as a damage-sensing
molecule; however, to date, its involvement in the pathophysiology of stroke and its modulation following
neuroprotective treatment are not completely understood. We have previously demonstrated that
expression of distinct RAGE isoforms, recognized by different antibodies, is differentially modulated in
the brain of rats subjected to focal cerebral ischemia. Here, we focus on the full-length membrane-bound
RAGE isoform, showing that its expression is signiﬁcantly elevated in the striatum, whereas it is reduced in
the cortex of rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Notably, the reduction of
cortical levels of full-length RAGE detected 24 h after reperfusion is abolished by systemic administration
of a neuroprotective dose of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, N-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylacetamide (PJ34). More interestingly, a signiﬁcant reduction of plasma
soluble RAGE (sRAGE) occurs 24 h after reperfusion and this effect is reverted by a neuroprotective dose of
PJ34. Soluble forms of RAGE, generated either by alternative splicing or by proteolysis of the full-length
form, effectively bind advanced glycation end products, thereby competing with the cell surface full-length
RAGE, thus providing a ‘decoy’ function that may counteract the adverse effects of receptor signaling in
neurons and may possibly exert cytoprotective effects. Thus, our data conﬁrm the important role of RAGE
in ischemic cerebral damage and, more interestingly, suggest the potential use of sRAGE as a blood
biomarker of stroke severity and of neuroprotective treatment efﬁcacy.

1. Introduction
Recent ﬁndings have highlighted the important role of peripheral inﬂammation in the pathophysiology of ischemic brain
damage. Pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1,
IL-6, IL-18 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and some chemokines,
such as SDF-1alpha and fractalkine, have attracted considerable
interest as putative markers of stroke severity and neurologic
outcome (Amantea et al., 2014a). However, the exact relationship
between peripheral inﬂammatory markers, severity of ischemic
insult and outcome in stroke patients remains poorly understood.

The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) has
been implicated in the development and progression of stroke
(Lotze and Tracey, 2005; Hudson et al., 2005; Kalea et al., 2009).
Alternative splicing generates at least 3 major forms of the receptor:
(1) full-length (ﬂ-) membrane-bound RAGE; (2) N-terminally truncated RAGE, incapable of binding ligands; and (3) soluble RAGE,
including sRAGE and endogenous secretory (es)RAGE. Fl-RAGE is
mainly expressed in neurons and in microglia/macrophages. Modiﬁcations of its expression have been reported after both permanent
and transient focal cerebral ischemia in rodents (Qiu et al., 2008,
Zhai et al., 2008; Hassid et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010, Greco et al.,
2012) and in the ischemic hemisphere of stroke patients (Hassid
et al., 2009). In mice, activation of ﬂ-RAGE on microglia/macrophages by high mobility group box (HMGB)-1 protein released from
dying neurons contributes to the development of ischemic brain
damage (Muhammad et al., 2008; Qiu et al., 2008). Additionally,

blockade of ﬂ-RAGE signaling improves cell survival and reduces
infarct volume in animal models of stroke (Liu et al., 2007, Kim
et al., 2006; Muhammad et al., 2008).
We previously observed reduced levels of circulating RAGE in
rats subjected to either transient or permanent focal cerebral
ischemia (Greco et al., 2012). This is of interest since soluble forms
of RAGE, generated either by alternative splicing or by proteolysis
of the full-length form, effectively bind AGEs, thereby competing
with the cell surface ﬂ-RAGE, thus providing a ‘decoy’ function
that may counteract the adverse effects of receptor signaling in
neurons (Hanford et al., 2004; Koyama et al., 2007; Pichiule et al.,
2007; Muhammad et al., 2008; Basta, 2008). The very few clinical
studies that have attempted to correlate sRAGE with stroke outcome have led to inconclusive results. Some studies have reported
an association between circulating sRAGE levels and brain infarct
volume, stroke severity (Park et al., 2004a; Yokota et al., 2009) and
inﬂammatory status (Cui et al., 2013), others have suggested that
sRAGE levels at onset may predict cognitive impairment after
cerebral ischemia (Qian et al., 2012). Menini et al. (2014) reported
that serum sRAGE at admission was not signiﬁcantly different
between stroke patients and healthy controls, while increased the
following days after the ischemic event.
Here, we aim at assessing whether cerebral and circulating
RAGE levels are affected by an ischemic insult and, more importantly, by neuroprotective treatment with the poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP)-1 inhibitor N-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylacetamide (PJ34).

2. Materials and methods
Adult male Wistar rats (Charles River, Calco, Como, Italy) were
housed under controlled environmental conditions with ambient
temperature of 22 1C, relative humidity of 65% and 12 h light: 12 h
dark cycle, with free access to food and water at the Centralized
Animal Facility of the University of Pavia. Four to six animals per
group were used for the experiments and all procedures were in
accordance with the European Convention for Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Animal Care
Committee of the University of Pavia.
2.1. Focal cerebral ischemia and drug treatments
Animals were randomly assigned to 6 experimental groups as
follows:
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)
6)

MCAo 1 h (saline, 1 ml/kg, i.p., 15 min before MCAo)
MCAo 1 h þPJ34 (5 mg/kg, i.p., 15 min before MCAo)
Sham-operated animals (Sham 1 h)
tMCAo (saline, 1 ml/kg, i.p., 15 min before MCAo)
tMCAoþPJ34 (5 mg/kg, i.p., 15 min before MCAo)
Sham-operated animals (Sham)

MCAo was induced in rats weighing 300 720 g using an
intraluminal ﬁlament (Longa et al., 1989; Greco et al., 2011).
Brieﬂy, anesthesia was induced with isoﬂurane in air and body
temperature was kept at 37 1C during the surgical procedure with
a heating pad. Under an operating microscope, the external and
internal right carotid arteries were exposed and the external
carotid artery was cut approximately 3 mm above the common
carotid artery bifurcation. A silicone-coated nylon ﬁlament (diameter: 0.37 mm, Doccol Corporation, Redlands, CA, USA) was then
advanced into the internal carotid artery, approximately 18 mm
from the carotid bifurcation, up to the origin of the middle cerebral
artery in the Willis circle. Successful occlusion was conﬁrmed by
monitoring cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) by laser-Doppler ﬂowmetry

(Periﬂux System 5000, Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden) in the
ipsilateral cortex as previously described (Armogida et al., 2011).
The wound was then sutured and anesthesia discontinued. Animals belonging to experimental groups 1 and 2 (MCAo 1 h) were
killed after 1 h MCAo, whereas those belonging to experimental
groups 4 and 5 (tMCAo) were brieﬂy re-anaesthetized with
isoﬂurane, and the nylon ﬁlament was withdrawn 1 h after MCAo
to allow reperfusion for 24 h. After wound closure and discontinuation of isoﬂurane, the animals were allowed to awake in their
cages, with free access to food and water. Sham-operated animals
of experimental groups 3 and 6 were subjected to the same
procedures of groups 1 and 4, respectively, except for the insertion
of the silicon-coated ﬁlament that was stopped before occluding
the origin of the middle cerebral artery.
The PARP inhibitor PJ34 was dissolved (2.5 mg/ml) in saline
(0.9% NaCl) and administered i.p. 15 min before MCAo at a dose
(5 mg/kg) selected on the basis of previous evidence (Abdelkarim
et al., 2001; Iwashita et al., 2004). Vehicle-injected animals
received an injection of 2 ml saline under the same schedule.
2.2. Neuropathology and quantiﬁcation of ischemic damage
Cerebral infarct volume was evaluated 24 h after reperfusion, in
rats subjected to 1 h MCAo and pre-injected with PJ34 or vehicle,
using the triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) vital staining method.
Animals were killed by decapitation and the brains rapidly dissected and sliced in eight serial sections at 2-mm intervals from the
frontal pole using a rat brain matrix (RBMA-300 C, 2- Biological
Instruments, Besozzo, Italy). To measure ischemic damage, brain
slices were stained for 10 min in a 2% solution of TTC in saline, at
37 1C. Sections were then post-ﬁxed in 4% neutral-buffered paraformaldehyde and stored at 4 1C prior to analysis. Images of TTCstained sections were captured using a digital scanner and analyzed
using an image analysis software (ImageJ, version 1.30). The infarct
volume (mm3) was calculated as previously described (Greco et al.,
2011).
2.3. sRAGE Assay
Plasma samples were obtained from trunk's blood, following
decapitation of the rats 1 h after MCAo or 24 h after reperfusion.
Blood samples, collected into plastic tubes containing EDTA (K3),
were rapidly centrifuged for 10 min at 500 g and stored at  80 C1,
until the analysis was performed. Total sRAGE (sRAGE and esRAGE)
levels were quantiﬁed using a commercially available enzymelinked immunosorbant assay kit (RayBios Rat RAGE ELISA Kit)
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2.4. Western blotting analyses
Ispilateral and contralateral brain cortices and striata were
rapidly dissected out in ice and immediately processed for the
preparation of total protein extracts. Samples were lysed (CelLyticTM Mammalian Tissue Lysis/Extraction Reagent, SIGMA), supplemented with a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors
and incubated on ice for 20 min. Tissue lysates were centrifuged at
10,000 g for 10 min, at 4 1C, and supernatants were stored at
 80 1C. Protein assay was performed by the BCA method. Fifty
micrograms of protein were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels
10%, then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). After blocking with blocking buffer (Odyssey, Li-Cor
Bioscience) the blots were probed overnight, at 4 1C, with an antiRAGE C-terminal goat antibody (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
All blots were subsequently probed with a secondary speciﬁc
antibody labeled with a green ﬂuorochrome (1:10,000, Li-Cor
Bioscience). Membranes were also incubated with a polyclonal

we observed a signiﬁcant reduction in the volume of infarction
assessed 24 h after reperfusion, mainly involving the cortical
tissue, as compared with the group of rats that received vehicle
alone (Fig. 1).

2.5. Statistics

Western blotting analysis using the anti-RAGE C-terminal goat
antibody reveals the presence of one band at  50 kDa corresponding to the ﬂ-RAGE (Greco et al., 2012). The intensity of this
band is decreased in the right injured cortex as early as 1 h after
MCAo (Fig. 2A and C), whereas it is not affected in the ipsilateral
striatum (Fig. 3A and C). Pre-treatment with PJ34(5 mg/kg, i.p.,
15 min before MCAo) does not modify ﬂ-RAGE expression neither
in the cortex (Fig. 2A) nor in the striatum (Fig. 3A). At later stages
(i.e., 24 h after reperfusion), a signiﬁcant reduction of ﬂ-RAGE
levels occurs in the ischemic cortex as compared to sham, and this
effect is abolished by systemic administration of PJ34 (Fig. 2B and
C). However, the elevation of RAGE expression observed in the
striatum is not inﬂuenced by PJ34 administration (Figs. 3A and C).

Data were expressed as mean 7S.E.M. and the differences
between groups were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. For comparisons
between two experimental groups (i.e., infarct volume), unpaired
two-tailed t-test was used. A probability level of less than 5% was
regarded as signiﬁcant.

without reperfusion). Interestingly, the decrease of sRAGE circulating levels produced by transient MCAo was reversed by pretreatment with a neuroprotective dose of PJ34 (Fig. 4).

4. Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrate that ischemia–reperfusion injury in rats is associated with a signiﬁcant reduction of
cortical ﬂ-RAGE levels and of circulating sRAGE. Both effects are
reverted by pre-treatment with a neuroprotective dose of the
PARP inhibitor PJ34 at 24 h reperfusion.
Growing evidence demonstrates the participation of RAGEligand interactions in the development and progression of various
immune-mediated disorders, including vascular and neurodegenerative (Kalea et al., 2009; Park et al., 1998; Towler, 2011;
Muhammad et al., 2008). We have previously observed that
transient MCAo in rats produces elevation of ﬂ-RAGE (  50 kDa)
and its isoforms in 72–100 kDa range in the cerebral ischemic core,
whereas a reduction of ﬂ-RAGE (  50 kDa) and its isoforms in the
26–43 kDa range occurs in the cortical penumbra (Greco et al.,
2012). Here, we demonstrate that ﬂ-RAGE expression is signiﬁcantly reduced in the ischemic cortex as early as 1 h after MCAo,
thus suggesting that RAGE participates in the initial phases of
ischemic brain damage. The reduction of cortical ﬂ-RAGE persists
up to 24 h after reperfusion and is prevented by pretreatment with
a neuroprotective dose of PJ34. This is consistent with previous
studies showing that PJ34 reduces ischemia-induced BBB leakage
at late (i.e., 24–48 h) but not early reperfusion times (Lenzsér et al.,
2007). By contrast, in the ischemic striatum, elevation of ﬂ-RAGE
occurring after 24 h of reperfusion is not affected by PJ34 administration reﬂecting the fact that the drug does not rescue this brain
region (Fig. 1A).
PJ34 is a potent inhibitor of PARP that has been previously
shown to reduce brain infarct volume in rodents subjected to
either transient or permanent MCAo via mechanisms including
blockade of pro-inﬂammatory mediators production, preservation
of blood brain barrier integrity and reduced hemorrhagic transformation (Abdelkarim et al., 2001; Iwashita et al., 2004; Park
et al., 2004b; Haddad et al., 2006, 2008; Vagnerova et al., 2010). In
fact, the mechanisms by which PARP-1 activation contributes to
post-ischemic brain damage include reduction of NAD levels,
release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria,
induction of the expression of pro-inﬂammatory mediators,
reduced expression of pro-survival factors, increased blood–brain

95

barrier permeability and brain edema induction (Endres et al.,
1997; Moroni and Chiarugi, 2009; Moroni et al., 2012). Interestingly, the ischemic brain tissue rescued by PJ34 does mainly
correspond to the cortical penumbra (Memezawa et al., 1992)
where we observe ﬂ-RAGE modulation by the drug. Further
studies are needed to clarify whether there is a direct involvement
of PJ34/PARP-1-modulated pathways in the modiﬁcations of cerebral RAGE expression. Moreover, this work does not clarify
whether RAGE isoforms, other than ﬂ-RAGE, are modulated by
PJ34, neither a comparison was made with other beneﬁcial drugs
acting via different mechanisms, also including thrombolytic
agents.
The very few studies investigating the involvement of RAGE in
experimental cerebral ischemia have led to opposing results (Qiu
et al., 2008; Zhai et al., 2008; Hassid et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010;
Kamide et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2013), since either cytoprotective
or detrimental effects have been suggested for RAGE-ligand interactions in stroke (Pichiule et al., 2007; Muhammad et al., 2008).
We have previously demonstrated that modulation of RAGE and
its isoforms strongly depends on the intensity of the insult in the
brain region examined; with a distinct modulation in the core and
penumbra regions (Greco et al., 2012). In our study, ﬂ-RAGE
expression in the penumbra appears to be inversely correlated to
cerebral damage, thus suggesting that the receptor may play
beneﬁcial roles on the evolution of damage after ischemia–
reperfusion injury as also shown in other experimental settings
(Han et al., 2011). Alternatively, reduced brain levels of ﬂ-RAGE
may depend on ischemic neuronal damage, being the receptor
mainly expressed in neurons (Greco et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2013),
or may represent a compensatory mechanism to excessive receptor stimulation by its ligands. This latter mechanism does not
seem to apply to the striatum where elevation of RAGE observed
after 24 h of reperfusion is associated to irreversible damage of
this core region. Indeed, HMGB-1 released from dying neurons
contributes to the development of ischemic brain damage via the
activation of RAGE on microglia/macrophages (Muhammad et al.,
2008; Qiu et al., 2008). This further complicates the comprehension of the exact role of RAGE, since previous studies have
established that, depending on the cell type, distinct and often
opposite receptor signaling pathways may be activated upon
binding with advanced glycation end products (AGEs) (Soman
et al., 2013).
Release of HMGB1 from the ischemic core may promote upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the cortex,
which cleave RAGE (Zhang et al., 2008). Gelatinases, MMP-2 and
MMP-9, are usually elevated after an ischemic insult following
different time- and region-dependent activation patterns. In
rodent models of transient MCAo, cytosolic activity of gelatinases
is increased in the cortex between 2 and 22 h of reperfusion,
whereas in the striatum protease activity is detected at later timepoints (Amantea et al., 2008; 2014b). More interestingly, at early
reperfusion times, the activated (87–88 kDa) form of MMP9 is
elevated in the cortex but not in the striatum (Fujimura et al.,
1999; Amantea et al., 2007). This may account for the different
modulation of ﬂ-RAGE observed in these two areas after ischemia,
being the receptor cleaved in the cortex from early reperfusion
times. Alternatively, RAGE up-regulation in the striatum may also
be sustained by the increased production of reactive oxygen
species during reperfusion (Yao and Brownlee, 2010), which
contributes to lipid peroxidation and neuronal death in the core
region after transient focal ischemia (Chan, 2001; Liu et al., 2003;
Matsuda et al., 2009).
An important ﬁnding of the present work refers to the
modulation of sRAGE levels following ischemia–reperfusion. The
circulating truncated variant isoform, sRAGE, corresponds to the
extracellular domain of the full-length receptor (Basta, 2008;

96

R. Greco et al. / European Journal of Pharmacology 744 (2014) 91–97

Koyama et al., 2007). Exogenously administered sRAGE has been
successfully used to antagonize AGEs-RAGE-mediated vascular
damage, myocardial and brain ischemia–reperfusion injury
(Bucciarelli et al., 2002, 2006; Wendt et al., 2006; Tang et al.,
2013). In fact, sRAGE may compete with cell-surface RAGE ligands,
thus functioning as a decoy and possibly exerting a cytoprotective
effect (Kolominsky-Rabas et al., 2001; Ageno et al., 2002; Tang
et al., 2013). Accordingly, here we demonstrate that circulating
sRAGE levels are signiﬁcantly reduced after 1 h MCAo followed by
24 h of reperfusion. This is consistent with our previous ﬁndings
documenting reduced levels of plasma RAGE 8–24 h after either
transient or permanent MCAo (Greco et al., 2012). Nevertheless, as
shown here, 1 h MCAo is not sufﬁcient to exert a signiﬁcant
modulation of sRAGE. More interestingly, we have found that the
reduction of sRAGE produced by ischemia–reperfusion injury is
abolished by pre-treatment with a neuroprotective dose of the
PARP inhibitor PJ34. Thus, higher levels of sRAGE may underlie the
neuroprotective effects of PJ34, being associated to reduced detrimental activation of ﬂ-RAGE by ligands such as HMGB1 or S100
(Muhammad et al., 2008; Tang et al., 2013). Whether this is a
mechanism by which PJ34 exerts its beneﬁcial effects or a
consequence of its neuroprotective action needs further investigation. Nevertheless, data presented here strongly suggest that
sRAGE may represent a useful circulating biomarker of stroke
severity and of effective neuroprotective treatment. Nevertheless,
in order to validate the clinical utility of sRAGE as a biomarker to
decide whether the patient can be eligible for thrombolysis,
further studies comparing its modulation under ischemic vs
hemorrhagic conditions and at early times after the insult should
be conducted.
Research using protein biomarkers in patients with ischemic
cerebrovascular disease have mainly focused on pathophysiology,
diagnosis, prognostication, and neuronal death in stroke (Lynch
et al., 2004). C-reactive protein is a typical example of protein
biomarkers (Ridker et al., 1997, 2008; Van Der Meer et al., 2002);
however, recent studies have raised the possibility that the
relation may result from various biases (Hemingway et al., 2010).
Numerous studies suggest that decreased levels of sRAGE may be
useful as a biomarker of ligand-RAGE pathway hyperactivity and
inadequate endogenous protective responses, thus providing a
powerful complement to cardiovascular risk stratiﬁcation and an
interesting target of therapeutic interventions (Santilli et al.,
2009). A previous study has demonstrated that low plasma levels
of sRAGE are associated with severe leukoaraiosis in acute stroke
patients (Yokota et al., 2009), while Park et al. (2009) have
reported that plasma sRAGE levels in patients with acute ischemia
are signiﬁcantly lower than in the control subjects, supporting a
potential value for sRAGE as a peripheral biomarker. By contrast,
Montaner et al. (2012) showed that sRAGE levels in ischemic
patients were signiﬁcantly higher than those in stroke-mimic
patients, but this study did not recruit matched control subjects,
and no further association analysis for sRAGE was done. Additionally, Tang et al. (2013) reported that within 48 h after ischemic
stroke in patients the levels of sRAGE were signiﬁcantly elevated
when compared with the controls, and then decreased signiﬁcantly at 5–7 days after when compared with initial sRAGE levels.
These apparent discrepancies depend on the evidence that sRAGE
levels are signiﬁcantly different among stroke subtypes. In fact,
levels of circulating sRAGE are signiﬁcantly higher in patients with
cardioembolic stroke (Montaner et al., 2008; Tang et al., 2013),
whereas lower sRAGE blood concentrations occur in lacunar and
atherothrombotic strokes and in severe leukoaraiosis (Montaner
et al., 2008; Yokota et al., 2009).
Moreover, sRAGE has an antiatherogenic role and is decreased
in diabetes and hypertension, both risk factors for large- or smallvessel atherothrombotic disease (Falcone et al., 2005). In fact, low

plasma levels of sRAGE have been suggested to reﬂect the
neurological severity of ischemic stroke, especially in subjects
without identiﬁable conventional risk factors, such as diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia (Park et al.,
2009). Similarly, in the work by Cui et al. (2013), ischemic stroke
patients have lower circulating sRAGE levels, which correlate to a
higher inﬂammatory status.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that ischemia–reperfusion injury induced by 1 h MCAo followed by 24 h reperfusion is
associated to reduced cerebral expression of ﬂ-RAGE and of
circulating sRAGE in rat. Both effects are abolished by pretreatment with a neuroprotective dose of PJ34, suggesting the
involvement of RAGE in ischemic cerebral damage and, more
interestingly, highlighting the potential use of sRAGE as a blood
biomarker of stroke severity and neuroprotection.
