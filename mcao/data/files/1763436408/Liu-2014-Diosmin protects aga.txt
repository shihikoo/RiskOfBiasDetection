Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability
worldwide (Shyu et al., 2004). In recent years, apoptosis
has attracted a close attention in cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion (I/R), and the overall weight of evidence
favors an important contribution from anti-apoptosis to
neuronal protection in cerebral ischemia (Liu et al.,
2013; Xia et al., 2013). Diosmin (DM), a naturally
occurring ﬂavonoid substance derived from the ﬂavonoid
hesperidin and various other plants, is considered to be
a vascular-protecting cure for chronic venous
insuﬃciency, hemorrhoids, lymphedema, and diabetes,
etc. (Benavente-Garcı́a and Castillo, 2008) Data
suggesting that DM possesses an anti-apoptotic eﬀect
in numerous damage such as varicose veins (Iriz et al.,
2008) and renal injury (Rehman et al., 2013) have
blossomed. However, little is known about the eﬀect of
DM on cerebral ischemic damage.
After ischemia, neuronal cells can die by either
necrosis or apoptosis (Choi, 1996), and in the latter the
balance of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and proapoptotic
protein Bax is very important (Yao et al., 2005).
Decreasing the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 could be achieved
by induced-phosphorylation of Janus-activated kinase-2
(JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription-3
(STAT3) signal pathway (Haga et al., 2003). In this
pathway, STAT3 is phosphorylated by phospho-JAK2
(pJAK2) and subsequently transferred to the nucleus,
where it regulates the transcription of its target genes by
binding to promoter regions of genes containing
gamma-activated sequences (Oliva et al., 2012).
Constitutive activation of STAT3 signaling has been
reported to convey resistance to apoptosis in human
U266 myeloma cells (Catlett-Falcone et al., 1999) and
oncogenic ras-stimulated cells (Zushi et al., 1998).
Furthermore, the activation of JAK2/STAT3 signal
pathway was associated with a reduction in ischemic
brain damage, including a decrease in the area of the
infarct and the number of TUNEL-positive cells (Suzuki
et al., 2001). Analyzing the diﬀerent classes of
proteomics-identiﬁed proteins, Domenico et al. reported
the role of STAT3 as a mediator of neuronal function
after transient focal ischemia by controlling metabolic,
synaptic, structural and transcriptional pathways, and
observed that the adaptive response to I/R injury was

Abstract—Background and object: Apoptosis is a major
form of cell death in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)
pathogenesis and may represent a target for treatment.
Diosmin (DM), a micronized puriﬁed ﬂavonoid drug, possesses an anti-apoptotic eﬀect in the treatment of varicose
veins and renal injury. However, the eﬀect of DM in the acute
phase of cerebral I/R is not clear. This study investigated
DM’s role in cerebral I/R and its potential mechanism.
Methods: Male CD-1 mice were subjected to transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Experiment 1 was used to
evaluate the time course expression of Janus tyrosine kinase2 (JAK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3
(STAT3), phosphorylated JAK2 (pJAK2) and phosphorylated
STAT3 (pSTAT3) after cerebral I/R, and six time points were
included. In experiment 2, DM was given orally at doses of
50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg for 6 consecutive days before receiving tMCAO. At 24 h after reperfusion, neurological deﬁcit, Nissl staining, brain water content and infarct volume were
examined. Bcl-2, Bax, pJAK2, and pSTAT3 were detected by
immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and Western blot. Confocal
microscope was used to observe the location of pSTAT3 in
the cerebral cortex.
Results: Compared with Vehicle group, the high dose of DM
signiﬁcantly alleviated neurological deﬁcit, brain water content, infarct volume, increased the Nissl-positive cells, upregulated the expression of pJAK2, pSTAT3 and Bcl-2 and
downregulated Bax (P < 0.05).
Conclusion: These results showed that DM protected against
cerebral I/R injury through activating JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway. Ó 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

delayed in neuronal-speciﬁc STAT3 knockout mice (Di
Domenico et al., 2012). Recently, reports suggested
that JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway played an essential
role in the neuroprotection of estradiol (Sehara et al.,
2013) and erythropoietin (Jiang et al., 2013). DM
decreased the DNA fragmentation of LPS-induced cells
via decreasing the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 (Dholakiya and
Benzeroual, 2011) which could be achieved by JAK2/
STAT3 signal pathway (Haga et al., 2003). Thus it is
worthy to clarify whether JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway
mediates DM neuroprotective eﬀect, if any, in cerebral
I/R. The present project is to investigate the possible
neuroprotection of DM against focal cerebral I/R injury
induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(tMCAO) in mice and detect its targeted and protective
signal pathway.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals and ischemia protocol
All mice experiments were performed in compliance with
the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health Guide
for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Conforming to
internationally
accepted
ethical
standards,
the
experimental procedures were approved by the local
experimental ethics committee and the institutional
animal care and use committee. We made great eﬀorts
to alleviate animal suﬀering, to minimize the number of
animals used in experiment, and to utilize alternatives to
in vivo techniques, if permitted. Male CD-1 mice (25–
30 g) purchased from the Vital river, Beijing, China,
were kept on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with free
access to food and water, and they were allowed to
acclimatize the new surrounding for at least 3 days
before using in experiments.
Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced as
described by Clark et al. (1997). Brieﬂy, mice were
subjected to 60-min MCAO under 10% chloral hydrate
anesthesia
(400 mg/kg)
by
inserting
a
nylon
monoﬁlament with a heat-rounded tip (Beijing Shadong
BioTechnologies Co., Ltd., China) into the right side of
common carotid artery, which was advanced further until
it closed the origin of the MCA. Reperfusion was
achieved by withdrawing the suture after 1 h of occlusion
to restore blood supply to the MCA territory. Monitoring
of occlusion and reperfusion of MCA was achieved using
a laser Doppler blood ﬂow assessment (moorVMS-LDF,
Moor Instruments Ltd, Est Axminster Devon, UK)
positioned 1 mm posterior and 3 mm lateral to the
bregma. Body temperature was maintained 37 ± 0.5 °C
throughout the surgery by means of a heating blanket
and a lamp. Sham-operated control mice underwent the
same surgical procedure without inserting a ﬁlament.
Groups and drug administration
Experiment 1: the time course expression of pJAK2,
JAK2, pSTAT3 and STAT3 in the cortices after tMCAO.
Forty-two mice were randomly assigned to seven groups
(six mice in each group) including normal-control group

319

(Sham), and 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h six time point
groups after reperfusion. In this part, Western blotting
was used to detect the time course variation of pJAK2,
JAK2, pSTAT3 and STAT3.
Experiment 2: neuroprotective role of DM. Groups:
One hundred and ﬁfty-three mice were randomly divided
into ﬁve groups: Sham-operated group (n = 31) that
received equal volume of 0.9% NaCl (Sham); tMCAO
group (n = 30) that received equal volume of 0.9%
NaCl (tMCAO); Vehicle group (n = 31) that received
equal volume of 10% lactose (Vehicle); low-dose group
(n = 30) that received DM at 50 mg/kg (DM-L); and
high-dose group (n = 31) that received DM 100 mg/kg
(DM-H).
Drug administration: DM (Daﬂon 500-mg tablets
consisting of 90% DM and 10% hesperidin, Hongkong)
was comminuted and dissolved in 10% lactose at
concentration of 5 or 10 mg/ml. The animals received
0.1 ml of DM suspension or vehicle or 0.9% saline per
10-g body weight. The mice in DM-L and DM-H
received an oral treatment of DM at doses of 50 and
100 mg/kg body weight respectively for 6 consecutive
days, and the last administration was given 1 h before
surgery. In the cases of the Vehicle group, tMCAO and
Sham group, equal volumes of 10% lactose or 0.9%
saline was administered in the same manner.
Experimental methods
Neurological deﬁcit scores (NDS) were evaluated by an
investigator blinded to the experimental groups at 24 h
after reperfusion following a modiﬁed scoring system
developed from Bederson et al. (1986) as follows: 0,
normal motor function; 1, contralateral forelimb
weakness and torso turning to the ipsilateral side when
held by tail; 2, circling to the aﬀected side but normal
posture at rest; 3, leaning to the contralateral side at
rest; and 4, no spontaneous activity or barrel rolling.
The higher the NDS, the more severe impairment of
motor motion injury.
Brain water content was measured using the standard
wet/dry weight method (Hatashita et al., 1988) at 24 h
after reperfusion as previously described (Cui et al.,
2010) with a little change in that the brains were cut
coronally in 3-mm thickness after dissecting free 2-mm
frontal pole.
Infarct volume 24 h after reperfusion was determined
by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride
(TTC)
as
described previously (Dong et al., 2013).
For Nissl staining, the slices which were from samples
for immunohistochemistry were hydrated in 0.1% Cresyl
Violet for 3 min. Then they were dehydrated in gradient
ethanol and cleaned with xylenes (Amantea et al., 2011).
The slides were viewed and photographed with a  400
light microscope (Nikon, Est Axminster Devon, Japan).
Standard Immunohistochemistry processing was
performed as previously described (Yang et al., 2009;
Liu et al., 2012) with a modiﬁcation of antibody: After
being blocked in 3% H2O2 and 3% normal goat serum,
the slices were incubated with pJAK2, pSTAT3, Bcl-2
and Bax (1:100, Bioworld Biotechnology) rabbit

320

polyclonal antibodies respectively in 0.01 mol/L
phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS) overnight.
Qualitative analysis of the location of pSTAT3 protein
was identiﬁed by immunoﬂuorescence as we previously
reported (Ji et al., 2012; Du et al., 2012). Frozen
coronal brain sections (30 lm-thick) were blocked with
PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat
serum, and then incubated with rabbit anti-pSTAT3
(1:100, Bioworld technology, Minnesota, America) and
mouse anti-SMI32 (1:500, Sternberger Monoclonals
Incorporation, Lutherville, China) or mouse anti-GFAP
(1:200,
Sternberger
Monoclonals
Incorporation,
Lutherville, China) overnight at 4 °C. Slices were
washed with PBS on the second day and incubated with
secondary antibody (anti-rabbit Dye-light 594, 1:100
dilution, Beijing; anti-mouse FITC, 1:100 dilution,
Beijing) for 1 h and then observed using 20 Laser
Scanning Confocal Microscope (Olympus FV10-ASW,
Japan).
For Western blotting, extraction and analysis of the
protein were described as in previous reports (Chen
et al., 2012). Just the antibody were insteaded by rabbit
polyclonal antibody anti-JAK2 (1:500, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas, U.S.A.), anti-STAT3, antipJAK2, anti-pSTAT3, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bax (1:500,
bioworld Biotechnology), and anti-b-actin (1:3000, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas, U.S.A.).
As described previously (Zhang et al., 2013), the
mRNA expression of Bcl-2 and Bax was detected by
qRT-PCR (MX 3005P, USA) in the presence of a
ﬂuorescent dye (SYBR Green I; Cwbio). The primers
are as follows: Bcl-2 forward 50 -CGGGAGAACAGGGT

ATGA-30 , reverse 50 -CAGGCTGGAAGGAGAAGAT-30 ;
Bax forward 50 -GCAGGGAGGATGGCTGGGGAGA-30 ,
reverse 50 -TCGAGACAAGCAGCCGCTCACG-30 ; b-actin
forward 50 -GCCATGTACGTAGCCATCCA-30 , reverse
50 -GAACCGCTCATTGCCGATAG-30 .
All data in this study were analyzed using SPSS 13.0
software. Quantitative data were represented as
mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed by a
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
LSD test for intergroup comparisons. NDS were
analyzed by the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis analysis
of ranks. Diﬀerences with P < 0.05 were considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

RESULTS
DM ameliorated the neurological deﬁcit, decreased
the brain edema and lessened the infarct volume
Compared with the Sham group, the NDS were
remarkably higher in the tMCAO group and Vehicle
group (Sham vs. Vehicle, P < 0.01). Scores were
signiﬁcantly ameliorated in DM-H group (DM 100 mg/kg
vs. Vehicle, P < 0.05). Though lower scores of DM-L
group than Vehicle group were seen, there was no
signiﬁcant diﬀerence (Fig. 1A).
Ipsilateral brain water content of the Sham group was
78.24 ± 1.71%. In tMCAO and Vehicle groups, the brain
water content was considerably increased and there was
no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two groups.
Compared with tMCAO, DM-H group showed an intense
decline in the percentage of brain water content (Vehicle

group vs. DM-H group: 84.01 ± 1.12% vs. 81.78 ±
1.12%, P < 0.01), while the change in the DM-L group
was not signiﬁcant (Fig. 1B).
In the Sham group, no infarction was observed. An
extensive lesion was developed in tMCAO and Vehicle
groups (Fig. 1C), and no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was seen
between the groups. The infarct volume was
signiﬁcantly reduced from 62.06 ± 4.86% in the Vehicle
group to 40.42 ± 6.60% in the DM-L group and
21.44 ± 3.77% in the DM-H group (P < 0.01) (Fig. 1C,
D).
DM increased the Nissl-positive cells
In Fig. 2A, representative Nissl staining of the coronal
brain sections from the Sham, Vehicle and the DM-Htreated mice 24 h after the injury is presented. Neurons
with abundant Nissl bodies were signiﬁcantly decreased
in the tMCAO and Vehicle groups compared with the
Sham group, which was signiﬁcantly restored by DM
administration (P < 0.01), particularly in the DM-H
group (Fig. 2B).
Phospho-JAK2 and phospho-STAT3 were
up-regulated in the acute phase of cerebral I/R
JAK2, pJAK2, STAT3 and pSTAT3 molecules were
examined in the ipsilateral I/R cortices using Western
blotting respectively at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after
reperfusion and the Sham group. Levels of total JAK2
and STAT3 were slightly variable, but there was no
signiﬁcant change at any time points examined. While
faint immunoreactivity for pJAK2 and pSTAT3 were
detected in the cerebral cortex after Sham-operation,
and compared with the Sham control, the protein levels
of pJAK2 and pSTAT3 were up-regulated from the third
hour on, rising to the highest levels at 24 h after
reperfusion (Fig. 3). However, these molecules did not

signiﬁcantly increase at 72 h after tMCAO, suggesting a
rapid and temporal variation in pJAK2 and pSTAT3
expression during the acute phase of I/R.
The location of pSTAT3 in cerebral after tMCAO
Phosphorylated STAT3 was detectable in few neurons
and almost none in astrocytes in the Sham-operated
cortex. In contrast, pSTAT3 were predominately
localized to the nuclei of neurons (Fig. 4A) and
astrocytes (Fig. 4B) in the Vehicle group, which was
also observed in the DM-H group with an increased
pSTAT3 staining intensity compared to the Vehicle
(without statistical analysis).
DM upregulated the expression of pJAK2, pSTAT3
and Bcl-2 and downregulated the expression of Bax
Representative western photographs for pJAK2 and
pSTAT3 were exhibited in Fig. 5A. Compared with the
Sham group, protein levels of pJAK2 and pSTAT3 in the
ischemic cortex tended to be higher in tMCAO and
Vehicle groups, and after administration of DM, pJAK2
and pSTAT3 further increased in the ipsilateral cortex
(Fig. 5B). Fig. 5C displayed the representative
immunohistochemistry photographs for pJAK2 and
pSTAT3. In agreement with results of Western blotting,
immunohistochemistry also showed a signiﬁcant
increase of pJAK2 and pSTAT3 in the DM-H group. In
the Sham group, few cells stained by pJAK2 and
pSTAT3 were seen in the cortex. 24 h after reperfusion,
an intense staining of pJAK2 and pSTAT3 was
observed in the ischemic cortex. In both DM-L and DMH groups, the number of cells labeled with pJAK2 and
pSTAT3 ascend signiﬁcantly vs. Vehicle (P < 0.01)
(Fig. 5D). Representative photographs in Figs. 6A, C
showed the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax. For Bcl-2,
diﬀerences between DM-H and Vehicle were signiﬁcant

observed in the Sham group, while an increased number of pSTAT3 and SMI32 or GFAP colocalized cells could be detected in the DM-H group and
the Vehicle group, especially in the former. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version

of Bcl-2 was signiﬁcantly upregulated (P < 0.05) after
systemic administration of DM (100 mg/kg) in the I/R
brain (Fig. 6E). The level of Bcl-2 was higher in DM-L
than Vehicle, but statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between DM-L and Vehicle (P < 0.01) was, indeed,
observed only in immunohistochemistry. Along with the
results of qRT-PCR, the expression of Bax in Western
blotting (Figs. 6A, B) was up-regulated in Vehicle and
tMCAO group which signiﬁcantly reduced by treatment
with DM high dose (both P < 0.05). Compared with
Vehicle group, Bax was signiﬁcantly reduced in the DMH group (P < 0.01) by immunohistochemistry, Western
blotting and qRT-PCR. But DM low dose displayed this
eﬀect only in qRT-PCR (Fig. 6).

DISCUSSION
It is well known that tMCAO is a well-characterized and
classical model to study the mechanisms of cerebral I/R
(Clark et al., 1997; Xu et al., 2006). The present study
demonstrated that DM protected against cerebral I/R
damage in a mice tMCAO model as evidenced by
decreasing the neurological deﬁcit, brain edema and
infarct volume and increasing the Nissl-positive cells. In
accordance with these results, some researches have
indicated that DM was eﬀective in reducing leg
ischemia–reperfusion injury and controlling edema by
suppressing post ischemic leukocyte adhesion and
emigration and venular protein leakage (Friesenecker
et al., 1995; Korthuis and Gute, 1997). Perhaps
decreased leukocyte-dependent endothelial damage
was connected with the eﬀect of DM on alleviating brain

edema and infarct volume, and relevant research will be
conducted in the future.
Severe ischemic injury may cause excitotoxicity,
acute Ca2+ overload, free radicals, and inﬂammatory
responses, all of which lead to necrosis and apoptosis
(Choi, 1996; Dirnagl, 2004; Xu et al., 2006). It is
recognized that apoptosis contributes importantly to
brain damage after global or focal ischemic insults
(Choi, 1996). Over expression of human Bcl-2
(Martinou et al., 1994) or delivery of the human Bcl-2
gene to the cortex via herpes virus vectors (Linnik
et al., 1995), both reduced infarction in rodent brains
subjected to focal ischemic insults. Flavonoids, are part
of a family of naturally occurring polyphenolic
compounds characterized by a common benzoc-pyrone structure, show various biological functions
and have antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inﬂammatory,
and antiapoptotic properties (Benavente-Garcı́a and
Castillo, 2008; Rehman et al., 2013). DM (C28H32O15)
occurs naturally from Scrophularia nodosa as a
glycoside, meaning that it has a sugar molecule
attached to its three-ringed ﬂavonoid structure.
Pharmacokinetic investigations have shown DM is
rapidly transformed by intestinal ﬂora to its aglycone
form, diosmetin, which is absorbed and rapidly
distributed throughout the body with a plasma half-life
of 26–43 h. Diosmetin is degraded to phenolic acids or
their glycine-conjugated derivatives and eliminated
through the urine. DM or diosmetin not absorbed is
eliminated in the feces (Cova et al., 1992; LysengWilliamson and Perry, 2003). DM was ﬁrstly introduced
as a therapeutic agent in 1969. It has been used for
more than 40 years as a vascular-protecting agent to
treat chronic venous insuﬃciency (Ramelet, 2001),

hemorrhoids (Buckshee et al., 1997), lymphedema and
varicose veins (Bergan et al., 2001). The mechanisms
of action include improvement of venous tone,
protection of capillary bed microcirculation, reduced
capillary permeability, increased lymphatic drainage,
inhibition of inﬂammatory reactions and apoptosis (Le
Dévéhat et al., 1997; Smith, 1999; Bergan et al., 2001;
Ramelet, 2001). Recently DM has been investigated for
other therapeutic purposes such as cancer (Dung et al.,
2012), hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury (Tanrikulu
et al., 2013) and diabetes (Forte et al., 2013). DM
signiﬁcantly decreased the DNA fragmentation of LPSinduced cells and increased cells survival via antiapoptotic eﬀect which was conﬁrmed by the decrease
in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 (Dholakiya and Benzeroual,
2011). Consistent with these researches, in the present
study, DM treatment signiﬁcantly increased Nisslpositive cells, upregulated Bcl-2 and down-regulated
Bax after tMCAO, indicating that DM might have a
potent anti-apoptotic eﬀect in cerebral I/R.
In this study, the expression of pJAK2 and pSTAT3
was up-regulated shortly at 3 h, and peaked at 24 h

after cerebral ischemia. They remained at high levels,
though they gradually decreased at 72 h. The result
coincides with the knowledge that normal mature
neurons do not display immunoreactivity for pSTAT3,
whereas neurons in the peri-infarct area exhibit marked
STAT3 phosphorylation (Suzuki et al., 2001). Despite
that some studies have suggested that activation of
STAT3 might be involved in neuronal death after
ischemic brain injury (Wen et al., 2001; Satriotomo
et al., 2006), data in this research are consistent with
other ﬁndings claiming a protective role (Yamashita
et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2013). Alternatively, the
increased pSTAT3 level after cerebral ischemia may be
the result, but not the cause, of the larger infarction in
the brain. STAT3 induces the expression of
neuroprotective genes, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL
(Stephanou et al., 2000; Sepúlveda et al., 2007), TIMP1 (Lin et al., 2006) and decreased levels of Bax
(Solaroglu et al., 2006). The activation of pSTAT3 in the
neurons and astrocytes has been demonstrated to
provide a beneﬁcial eﬀect after cerebral ischemic injury
(Amantea et al., 2011). In the present study, confocal

325

microscope results supported that DM-H could increase
the expression of pSTAT3 existing in the nucleus of
neurons and astrocytes.
After tMCAO, cytokines, such as IL-6 (Loddick et al.,
1998), IL-1b (Buttini et al., 1994) and tumour necrosis
factor-a (TNF-a) (Liu et al., 1994), have been found to
increase in ischemic tissue. Binding of neurokines and
cytokines to the membrane receptor glycoprotein 130
(gp130) results in the activation of JAKs (JAK1, JAK2,
JAK3 and TYK2), which in turn phosphorylates
cytoplasmic STATs (STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4,
STAT5A, STAT5B, and STAT6). Phosphorylated STATs
form homo- or heterodimers followed by translocating to
the nucleus, where they regulate the transcription of
target genes (Loddick et al., 1998; Suzuki et al., 2001).
Therefore, the JAK/STAT pathway provides cells with a
vital mechanism for responding to diverse extracellular
stimuli including ischemic stress (Suzuki et al., 2001).
The JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway is involved in many
physiological processes, such as cell survival,
inﬂammation,
development,
proliferation,
and
diﬀerentiation (Bergan et al., 2001). The wide series of
functions of pSTAT3 derive from its ability to control
diﬀerent gene sets according to cell-type and
stimulation. There is increasing evidence that the JAK2/
STAT3 signal pathway also has neuronal-speciﬁc
functions in the central nervous system. For example,
this pathway was implicated in leptin-induced
neuroprotection (Bjørbæk and Kahn, 2004; Amantea
et al., 2011) and was related to Alzheimer’s disease and
memory (Chiba et al., 2009). The neuroprotective eﬀect
of 17b-estradiol (E2) appeared to be mediated via
pSTAT3
because
STAT3
phosphorylation
was
increased by estradiol in an aortic endothelial cell line
(Bjornstrom and Sjoberg, 2002) and pharmacological
inhibition of pSTAT3 abolished the protective eﬀect of
E2 on infarct size (Dziennis et al., 2007). Erythropoietin
(EPO) promoted regeneration through the activation of
STAT3 and facilitated neuronal survival following
ischemia (Jiang et al., 2013). These researches
suggested that JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway maybe a
potentially important therapeutic target in an in vivo
model of cerebral ischemia. In the current study,
increased levels of pJAK2 and pSTAT3 were found in
the DM-treated mice compared to the Vehicle group and
decreased injury of cerebral I/R was observed after the
administration of DM. These ﬁndings indicated that the
JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway might be responsible at
least in part for the neuroprotection eﬀect of DM.
However, the mechanism by which DM could activate
the JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway remains unclear. Some
researches indicated that the phosphorylation of JAK
and STAT in the wild-type mouse neurons could be
activated by the production of reactive oxygen species
and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (Liu et al., 2005), and
interleukins in microvascular endothelial cells and
hepatocytes could induce the increase of the expression
of JAKs and STATs (Wrighting and Andrews, 2006;
Wang et al., 2008). Further study with JAK2-speciﬁc
inhibitor AG490 is being performed to research the
activated mechanism by DM.

CONCLUSION
Results showed that DM had beneﬁcial eﬀects in cerebral
I/R with a potential mechanism of activating the JAK2/
STAT3 signal pathway and more study is needed for
clinical tests in the future.
