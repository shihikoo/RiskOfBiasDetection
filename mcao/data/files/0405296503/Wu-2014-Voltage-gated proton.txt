Abstract
Microglia are brain resident immune cells and their functions are implicated in both the normal and diseased brain.
Microglia express a plethora of ion channels, including K+ channels, Na+ channels, TRP channels, Cl− channels, and
proton channels. These ion channels play critical roles in microglial proliferation, migration, and production/release of
cytokines, chemokines, and neurotoxic or neurotrophic substances. Among microglial ion channels, the voltage-gated
proton channel HV1 is a recently cloned ion channel that rapidly removes protons from depolarized cytoplasm and is
highly expressed in the immune system. However, the function of microglial HV1 in the brain is poorly understood.
Recent studies showed that HV1 is selectively expressed in microglia but not neurons in the brain. At the cellular
level, microglial HV1 regulates intracellular pH and aids in NADPH oxidase-dependent generation of reactive oxygen
species. In a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion, microglial HV1 contributes to neuronal cell death and
ischemic brain damage. This review discusses the discovery, properties, regulation, and pathophysiology of microglial
HV1 proton channel in the brain.

Introduction
Microglia are the principal brain immune cells and are
actively engaged in physiological and pathological brain
functions (Kettenmann and others 2011; Perry and others
2010; Ransohoff and Perry 2009). Recent studies have
shown that microglia have remarkably dynamic processes
and are frequently interacting with neurons and synaptic
elements. Through these interactions, microglia may
monitor neuronal/synaptic activities and thus survey the
microenvironment in the brain (Eyo and Wu 2013). As
resident immune response cells, microglia are also well
known to employ their immune functions in the diseased
brain, such as during bacterial meningitis, ischemic stroke,
Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and neuropathic pain (Ransohoff and Perry 2009).
Microglia bear a number of ion channels, including K+
channels, Na+ channels, TRP channels, Cl− channels, and
proton channels. These ion channels may play important
functions in proliferation, production of cytokines and
cytotoxic substances, morphological changes, and migration of microglial cells (Black and others 2009; Carrithers
and others 2007; Craner and others 2005; Eder 1998;
Kettenmann and others 2011). The voltage-gated proton
current has been well characterized in microglia since
1995 (Eder and DeCoursey 2001), but its molecular

identity as the voltage-gated proton channel HV1 was
only recently discovered (Ramsey and others 2006;
Sasaki and others 2006). HV1 rapidly removes protons
from depolarized cytoplasm and is highly expressed in
the immune system. Recent studies showed that HV1 is
selectively and functionally expressed in microglia but
not neurons in the mouse brain (Wu and others 2012).
Microglial HV1 regulates intracellular pH and aids in
NADPH oxidase (NOX)-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In a mouse model of cerebral
middle artery occlusion, HV1 knockout mice were protected from ischemic damage, showing reduced NOXdependent ROS production, microglia activation, and
neuronal cell death (Wu and others 2012). These studies
illuminate a critical role of microglial HV1 in ischemic
brain injury, providing a rationale for HV1 as a potential
therapeutic target for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
The current understanding of microglial HV1 in ischemic
injury through NOX-dependent ROS production may

serve as a common model to reveal the deleterious role of
microglia in neurological diseases other than ischemic
stroke, such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, Alzheimer’s diseases, and neuropathic pain.
Moreover, understanding microglial HV1 function will
unravel the physiological and pathological roles of
microglia in the normal and diseased brain (Wu 2013).

Voltage-Gated Proton Currents in
Microglia
Voltage-gated proton currents were first revealed in snail
neurons by Thomas and Meech in 1982 (Thomas and
Meech 1982). After they injected HCl into snail neurons,
they found that depolarization induced large outward proton currents that were associated with the recovery from
intracellular acidosis. In mammalian cells, DeCoursey
first recorded the voltage-gate proton currents in rat alveolar epithelial cells in 1991 (DeCoursey 1991). In microglia, the current was first recorded in microglial culture
from the murine neonatal brain in 1995 (Eder and others
1995). Subsequently, the voltage-gated current was
observed in cultured rat and human microglia as well as
microglial cells lines (Eder and DeCoursey 2001).
As microglia are extremely sensitive to the environment, cultured microglia have transformed into amoeboid

cells, which represent an activated form of microglia.
These activated microglia showed dramatic differences in
membrane properties and electrophysiology compared
with the ramified microglia in the acutely isolated slice
preparation (Boucsein and others 2000). For example, the
inwardly rectified potassium current is normally observed
in cultured microglia; however, potassium current is
rarely seen in resting microglia from brain slices
(Boucsein and others 2000; Wu and others 2007).
Similarly, functional AMPA/kainate receptors were
observed in cultured microglia but not in microglia from
brain slices (Noda and others 2000; Wu and Zhuo 2008).
In terms of the voltage-gated proton current, it has been
well characterized in cultured microglia. However, there
has been a debate about whether microglia in brain slices
express functional voltage-gated proton currents, as no
current was seen in microglia in P21 rat brain slices
whereas the current was observed in microglia in P5-9
mouse brain slices (De Simoni and others 2008; Schilling
and Eder 2007).
The controversy on whether microglia in situ express
voltage-gated proton current was resolved in a recent
study by recording microglia in both rat and mouse brain
slices under the same condition (Wu and others 2012)
(Fig. 1). Surprisingly, it seems that mouse but not rat
microglia in brain slices express functional voltage-gated

proton currents (Fig. 2). Considering the close sequence
homology between mouse and rat HV1 proton channel,
future studies are needed to investigate the mechanism
underlying the species difference in microglial voltagegated proton current. The species differences also raise
the concern of the existence of voltage-gated proton currents in human brain tissue in situ, though voltage-gated
proton currents were observed in cultured human microglia (McLarnon and others 1997; Wu and others 2012). In
addition, the study suggests that the stage of postnatal
development may not underlie the differences, as microglial proton current is not noticeably regulated by development after birth and the proton current persisted in both
neonatal (P1 and P7) and adult mouse microglia (P21 and
P42) (Fig. 1). In contrast to the electrophysiology results,
a recent study using immunostaining indicated that the
HV1 proton channel is absent in the neonatal mouse brain
but present in adult microglia (Okochi and others 2009).

The Discovery of Voltage-Gated
Proton Channel HV1
Since the observation of voltage-gated proton currents in
immune cells, there has been a debate about whether a
component of NOX is the voltage-gated proton channel
responsible for the proton currents (DeCoursey 2003).
The discovery of the voltage-gated proton channel
resolved the dispute and convincingly showed that the
voltage-gated proton current results from its own ion

channel. A gene encoding an ion channel with voltagedependent, proton selective flux was recently identified
by two groups independently (Ramsey and others 2006;
Sasaki and others 2006). Through sequence homology to
the voltage sensor domain of voltage-gated cation channels, the Clapham lab fished out the gene HVCN1 encoding the voltage-gated proton channel from human genome
using bioinformatics searches and named the channel as
HV1. (The H stands for the conducted ionic species, H+;
the V subscript indicates voltage sensitivity, and 1 is the
first member in the family.) At the same time, using a
similar strategy, the Okamura lab identified mouse voltage-gated proton channel, mVSOP (mouse voltage-sensor domain–only protein) (Sasaki and others 2006),
which is a homologue of the first voltage-sensitive lipid
phosphatase discovered by the same group previously
from Ciona intestinalis (Murata and others 2005).
Subsequently, voltage-gated proton channels have been
identified in coccolithophores (Taylor and others 2011)
and a dinoflagellate (Smith and others 2011). Genes that
are homologous to HVCN1 are present in many species,
from green alga, zebrafish, to monkey (DeCoursey 2013),
and thus future studies are needed to confirm functional
voltage-gated proton channels in these species.
The HV1 channel belongs to the voltage-gated ion
channel superfamily but has surprising and remarkable
features. Human HV1 proton channel protein has four
transmembrane domains (S1-S4) without a typical S5-S6
pore domain required for ion conduction; it contains 273

amino acids with intracellular N- and C-termini.
Mutagenesis studies identified that three arginine residues in S4 are responsible for voltage gating, whereas
two histidine residues are required for extracellular inhibition of HV1 by Zn2+ (Ramsey and others 2006). HV1 is
the most selective ion channel known, showing no detectable permeability to other ions. The ion selectivity filter
of HV1 channel is believed to be composed of aspartate
112 in S1 and arginine 211 in S4 (Berger and Isacoff
2011; Musset and others 2011). HV1 is a dimer, and the
cytosolic domain of the channel is necessary and sufficient for dimerization. Interestingly, each subunit of the
HV1 dimer is functional and has a separate permeation
pathway with its own pore and voltage sensor (Tombola
and others 2008). Recent studies showed that the opening
of the two pathways in HV1 channels is highly cooperative, which involves interactions between the two subunits of the HV1 dimer to initiate the conformational
change during activation (Qiu and others 2013).
In mammals, the HV1 is enriched in immune tissues
such as the lymph node, bone marrow, and spleen (Ramsey
and others 2006; Sasaki and others 2006). Not surprisingly,
HV1 is also expressed in microglia, the principal immune
cells in the brain (Wu and others 2012). HV1 is expressed
in many species, and thus its functions are very diverse,
from triggering bioluminescent flash in dinoflagellates
(Fogel and Hastings 1972), facilitating calcification in coccolithophores (Taylor and others 2011), bacterial killing by
macrophages (Ramsey and others 2009), to sperm activation (Lishko and others 2010). Interestingly, a naturally
occurring mutation producing the M91T mutant HV1 proton channel was found in human airway epithelium cells
(Iovannisci and others 2010). The M91T channel activates
around 30 mV more positive than the wild-type (wt) HV1
channel. Consequently, the activation of acid secretion in
epithelia expressing M91T HV1 channel required 0.5 unit
higher extracellular pH than wt epithelia (Iovannisci and
others 2010). The properties and potential functions of the
HV1 proton channel in biological systems have been
reviewed thoroughly (DeCoursey 2013). The current
review will mainly discuss the properties, regulation, and
pathophysiology of HV1 proton channel in microglia.

HV1 Mediates Voltage-Gated Proton
Current in Microglia but Not in
Neurons or Astrocytes
As we mentioned above, voltage-gated proton currents
have been characterized in cultured human, mouse, and
rat microglia (Eder and DeCoursey 2001). In addition,
the voltage-gated proton current was reported in microglia from mouse acute brain slices but not in rat brain slices
(De Simoni and others 2008; Schilling and Eder 2007;

Wu and others 2012). To test whether the HV1 channel
mediated voltage-gated proton currents in microglia from
mouse brain slices, multidisciplinary methods including
biochemical, electrophysiological, pharmacological, and
genetic approaches were used (Wu and others 2012). (1)
Quantitative PCR results showed that Hvcn1 mRNA is
expressed in the brain and cultured microglia.
Consistently, HV1 protein expression in cultured microglia was confirmed. However, HV1 protein cannot be
detected in whole brain lysate, which might be because of
the limited number of microglia in the brain. (2) Using
transgenic mice where microglia are selectively labeled
with GFP, whole-cell recording were performed in
microglia in acute brain slices. Depolarization-induced
slowly activating outward currents were observed in
microglia and were shown to possess pH dependence and
proton selectivity, suggesting the presence of voltagegated proton currents in mouse microglia. (3) The voltage-gated proton current in microglia is largely reduced
by Zn2+, the known inhibitor of HV1. (4) More important,
the voltage-gated proton current in microglia is completely abolished in microglia from HV1−/− mice (Fig. 1).
These results demonstrated that HV1 mediated voltagegated proton currents in microglia. Particularly, the
results suggest that HV1 is the only channel that is responsible for voltage-gated proton currents in mouse microglia. Interestingly, under the same condition, the
voltage-gated proton current is 10 times smaller in rat
microglia compared with those in mouse microglia (De
Simoni and others 2008; Wu and others 2012) (Fig. 2).
Considering that mouse and rat HV1 share 89% identity in
protein sequence, it would be informative to understand
the mechanisms underlying the functional difference
between mouse and rat HV1.
The voltage-gated proton current was first reported in
snail neurons (Thomas and Meech 1982), which prompted
investigation to test whether HV1 is also expressed mouse
neurons. Indeed, an HV1-like current was reported in cultured hippocampal neurons (Cheng and others 2008).
However, several lines of evidence suggest that HV1 is
unlikely to function as a membrane voltage-gated proton
channel in mammalian neurons. (1) The HV1-like current
in the cultured hippocampal neurons cannot be blocked
by Zn2+ (Cheng and others 2008). (2) Immunostaining
results have shown that HV1 is selectively expressed in
microglia but not neurons (Okochi and others 2009). (3)
Western blot cannot detect HV1 expression in the whole
brain lysate or cultured neurons. Also, the expression of
Hvcn1 gene in neurons is extremely low compared with
that in microglia (Ramsey and others 2006; Wu and others 2012). (4) Electrophysiological recordings showed
that the HV1-like current in hippocampal pyramidal neurons cannot be abolished in HV1−/− mice nor is it affected
by changing the proton gradient (Wu and others 2012).

Figure 3.  Microglial voltage-gated proton currents were enhanced by H2O2. (A) In acute mouse hippocampal slices, microglial
voltage-gated proton currents were increased after H2O2 (1 mM) perfusion. Proton currents were recorded using perforated
patch clamp method to preserve physiological intracellular conditions. Voltage steps from −80 to +80 mV were used to activate
proton currents in microglia. Holding potential was −60 mV. Zn2+ inhibited the proton current. (B) Voltage–current relationships
showing increased voltage-gated proton currents 20 minutes after H2O2 perfusion.

Similarly, low expression of HV1 and no functional HV1
current was observed in astrocytes. Together, these results
suggest that neither hippocampal pyramidal neurons nor
astrocytes express functional HV1 proton currents in the
mouse brain. Whether HV1 is expressed in certain types
of neurons (such as GABAergic interneurons) or in different nuclei (such as respiratory chemoreceptor areas of
the brainstem) in the brain is still unknown.

Microglial Activation and Hv1 Proton
Channel Function
In contrast to neurons or astrocytes, microglia undergo
dramatic alterations in the morphology when they are activated in many neurological diseases, such as ischemic
stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and neuropathic pain
(Ransohoff and Perry 2009). It is not surprising that
microglial ion channels are associated with different activation status of microglia. For example, both outward and
inward rectifying K+ channels are up-regulated during
microglial activation under nerve injury or epilepsy
(Boucsein and others 2000; Menteyne and others 2009).
Under resting conditions, HV1 is a major functional ion
channel in microglia along with K+ channels and TRP
channels (Schilling and Eder 2007; Wu and others 2012).
The voltage-gated proton current in cultured microglia is
reported to be regulated by microglial activation status.
An early study showed that when cultured microglia
treated with astrocyte condition medium, which deactivate microglia, proton currents are decreased and the
kinetics of current activation are slowed (Klee and others
1999). Interestingly, activated microglia by LPS treatment
exhibited reduced proton currents (Klee and others 1999).
It is still unknown how deactivation by astrocyte c­ ondition

medium and activation by LPS have a similar modulation
on voltage-gated proton currents in microglia.
In the ischemic brain, after middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO), activated microglia in the ipsilateral
brain showed enhanced HV1 proton currents compared
with control microglia in the contralateral brain (Wu and
others 2012). Several different mechanisms may underlie
the increased HV1 proton current in microglia after ischemic stroke. First, it seems that the HV1 protein expression
is up-regulated in the brain after stroke (Wu and others
2012). However, whether the increased HV1 expression is
because of the increased number of microglia after proliferation/infiltration or HV1 up-regulation in activated
microglia is still unclear. Second, the increased HV1 proton current could be because of the modulation by inflammatory mediators, such as arachidonic acid or reactive
oxygen species (ROS), which are released by neurons or
glial cells in ischemic stroke (Chan 2001). Arachidonic
acid can robustly increase proton conductance in neutrophil and macrophage (DeCoursey and Cherny 1993). In
addition, ROS like H2O2 can significantly enhance the
HV1 current in brain microglia (Wu and others 2012)
(Fig. 3). However, the mechanism by which these inflammatory mediators regulate HV1 channel function is largely
unknown. A recent study showed that HV1 channel can be
phosphorylated at the site of Thr29 in N-terminal by protein kinase C, which increased proton channel gating and
conductance of the HV1 channel (Musset and others 2010).
It would be interesting to test whether arachidonic acid or
ROS may enhance the HV1 current through activation of
kinases and thereby HV1 channel phosphorylation. Third,
it is possible that there is an increase in the number of
membrane HV1 channels because of the trafficking in activated microglia in the ischemic brain. Early studies using

Figure 4.  Microglial HV1 channel in pH regulation and NOX-dependent ROS production. (A) Microglial HV1 relieves
intracellular acidosis during membrane depolarization. Intracellular pH (pHi) was reduced in response to NH4+-induced acid
load, but cannot recover in Na+-free solution (Na+ is replaced by NMDG). Membrane depolarization induced by K+-rich solution
caused rapid pHi recovery in wt but not HV1−/− microglia. (B) Microglial HV1 is required for NOX-dependent ROS production.
NOX was activated by PMA and ROS was detected by ethidium (ET) in the brain slices. Microglia were labeled with GFP in green
and ROS production was labeled in red (shown by arrows, left). NOX-dependent ROS production was gradually accumulated in
wt microglia but not in HV1−/− microglia (right).

cultured microglia showed reduced proton current after
chronic but not acute treatment of cytoskeletal disruptive
agents, such as cytochalasin or colchicine (Klee and others 1998), suggesting that the trafficking HV1 channels
might be important for the microglial proton current.
Nevertheless, although many studies have shown that the
trafficking of ion channels/receptor is critical in their
physiological or pathological functions (Krugers and others 2010), the trafficking of HV1 channels in microglia is a
largely uncharted area.
Does HV1 contribute to microglial activation? Activation
of microglia is accompanied by changes in morphology,
proliferation, up-regulation of immune surface antigens,
and the production of cytotoxic or neurotrophic molecules
(Ransohoff and Perry 2009). Under normal conditions,
HV1−/− microglia seem to have similar morphology compared with wt microglia. However, the enlarged cell bodies
after stroke were attenuated in HV1−/− microglia compared
with wt microglia, suggesting that HV1 contributes to
microglial activation after ischemia (Wu and others 2012).
In the neutrophil, HV1 is reported to participate in the Ca2+
signaling and neutrophil migration (El Chemaly and others
2010). It is still unknown whether the attenuated microglial
activation in HV1−/− mice after stroke results from the
impaired Ca2+ influx or indirectly from the impaired ROS
production/pH homeostasis as we will discuss below.

Cellular Functions of Microglial
HV1: pH Homeostasis and ROS
Production
The HV1 proton channel is activated by membrane depolarization and mediates outward proton currents.

Therefore, there are two consequences to the cells with
HV1 activation: one is the hyperpolarization of plasma
membrane and the other is the alkalization of intracellular
cytosol. The HV1-mediated membrane hyperpolarization
might be important for Ca2+ entry through store-operated
Ca2+ channels (El Chemaly and others 2010). The HV1mediated intracellular alkalization potentially regulates
pH homeostasis that was intensively studied in neutrophils (El Chemaly and others 2010; Morgan and others
2009).
In brain microglia, it has been shown that the activation of HV1 drastically adjusts intracellular acidification
under certain conditions such as during microglial depolarization (Wu and others 2012). As HV1 activation
requires membrane depolarization, it seems that the
sodium-proton exchanger (NHE1) but not HV1 channels
maintain basal intracellular pH under resting condition
(Liu and others 2010; Wu and others 2012). Even when
there is a dramatic drop in the intracellular pH (~6.5),
HV1 channels are not activated to correct the acidosis
because of the high voltage threshold for HV1 activation.
Microglial membrane depolarization, however, could
activate HV1 and promptly relieve the intracellular acidosis (Fig. 4A). Compared with NHE1-dependent proton
extrusion, HV1-mediated pH recovery is several times
faster than that of NHE1 in microglia. Therefore, microglial HV1 is able to function as an efficient pH regulator
but might do so only under conditions of strong membrane depolarization, such as induced by increased extracellular K+ concentration or NOX activation. However,
future in vivo studies are needed to determine whether
HV1 indeed regulates pH homeostasis under physiological conditions, considering the fact that the requirement
of HV1 activation is quite stringent. Consistent with this

MCAO compared with that in wt mice. TTC staining of coronal brain slices (upper) and transverse MRI brain images (lower) from wt
and HV1−/− mice after MCAO are shown. (B) Diagram showing HV1 function in microglial ROS production and neuronal damage after
ischemic stroke. Microglia are the first responders during ischemia, preceding leukocyte infiltration. Activated microglia produce
ROS through activation of NOX, primarily NOX2. HV1 is required for full activation of NOX2, by serving a charge compensation
function, as well as by removing intracellular H+. In the mouse brain, HV1 is highly expressed in microglia but not neurons or
astrocytes. Microglial HV1-related ROS production partially contributes to neuronal cell death in early stages of ischemic stroke.

notion, HV1 channels do not participate in ATP-induced
chemotaxis in microglia (Wu and others 2012), although
NHE1-mediated intracellular alkalization is known to be
critical for fibroblast and neutrophil migration (Casey
and others 2010). We have known that ATP activates P2Y
receptor-coupled K+ channel and thus might hyperpolarize microglia (Boucsein and others 2003; Wu and others
2007). Therefore, HV1 cannot be activated and participate
in the ATP-induced chemotaxis.
Proton currents were proposed to function cooperatively with NOX activities during respiratory burst, which
is associated with both intracellular acidosis and membrane depolarization (DeCoursey 2003): (1) NOX activation induces electron transfer across the membrane,
which depolarizes the membrane. The best estimate of
the membrane depolarization during the respiratory burst
was +58 mV in the neutrophil. The depolarization could
even reach 190 mV within 20 ms if there is no charge
compensatory mechanism (DeCoursey and others 2003).
(2) During NOX activation, protons are left behind as
electrons are transported across the cell membrane.
Indeed, NOX activity induces a sharp decrease in cytoplasmic pH in human neutrophils during phagocytosis
(Morgan and others 2009). Together, NOX activation
associated with membrane depolarization and intracellular acidosis seems sufficient to activate HV1. On the other
hand, NOX is inhibited by membrane depolarization and
by intracellular acidosis (DeCoursey 2003). Therefore, to
maintain NOX activity, particularly under constant activation such as respiratory oxidation, there must be mechanisms to compensate for the charge transfer and to
relieve intracellular acidosis. Obviously, HV1 is ideally
suited for this function in cooperation with NOX

(Fig. 5B). Consistent with this idea, accumulating evidence indicates that HV1 is coupled to NOX-dependent
pH regulation, membrane depolarization, and ROS production neutrophils (El Chemaly and others 2010), B
cells (Capasso and others 2010), and eosinophils (Zhu
and others 2013).
In brain microglia, HV1 and NOX (particularly NOX2)
are highly expressed. The HV1−/− microglia show intracellular acidosis when NOX is activated by phorbol
myristate acetate (PMA), suggesting that NOX and Hv1
are cooperatively activated (Wu and others 2012). In
addition, HV1 is required for NOX-dependent ROS production and HV1−/− microglia accumulate significantly
less ROS compared with that of wt microglia in brain
slices (Fig. 4B). More important, microglial HV1 is also
critical for NOX-dependent ROS production in ischemia
conditions both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, similar to
that in other immune cells, the HV1 proton channel in
microglia aids in NOX activation and subsequent ROS
production probably under disease conditions. However,
we have to keep in mind that NOX-dependent ROS production is not completely abolished in HV1−/− microglia.
These results suggest that NHE1 and other ion channels
may serve as alternative mechanisms to compensate
NOX activities, even though the HV1 channel seems to be
the ideal channel coupled to NOX.

Physiological and Pathological
Function of Microglial HV1
To study the pathophysiological function of HV1 in vivo,
HV1−/− mice were generated by both the Clapham and
Okumura laboratories recently (Okochi and others 2009;

Ramsey and others 2009). Most studies focused on HV1
function in the immune system using the knockout mice.
Unexpectedly, HV1−/− mice were able to clear several
bacterial infections in vivo including S. aureus,
Pseudomonas aeurginosa, and Burkholderia cepacia,
despite a significant reduction in superoxide production
(Ramsey and others 2009). The lack of a bacterial infection phenotype in the HV1−/− mice may be because of
redundant mechanisms for bacterial clearance. For example, both superoxide- and nitric oxide-dependent systems
are shown to function synergistically for bacterial clearance in vivo (Shiloh and others 1999). However, HV1−/−
mice showed defective B cell responses and impaired
antibody production (Capasso and others 2010). The
mechanism involves the regulation of B cell receptormediated ROS production and its downstream signaling,
Syk, Akt, and SHP-1 by HV1 activation. A recent study
also found that HV1−/− mice have autoimmune disorder
phenotypes, such as splenomegaly, autoantibodies, and
nephritis (Sasaki and others 2013). The phenotype might
be because of the impaired T-cell homoeostasis, although
T cells express very low density of functional HV1 channel (Schilling and others 2002). Because HV1 is expressed
in almost all cell types in the immune system, future studies employing cell-specific HV1 deletion are required to
dissect the role of HV1 in immune function.
In the brain, microglial cells are the only resident cell
type that highly expresses HV1. Therefore, it is advantageous to use general HV1−/− mice to study microglial HV1
function in the brain. Microglial HV1’s function in ischemic stroke has recently been reported (Wu and others
2012). The rationale to study microglial HV1 in ischemic
stroke comes from the earlier studies that NOX1, 2, 4
knockout mice showed less brain damage during the
pathology (Bedard and Krause 2007; Wu 2013). As
NOX2 is highly expressed in microglia and HV1 is coupled to NOX2 activation, it is possible that HV1−/− mice
may be protected in this disease. Indeed, HV1−/− mice
exhibited smaller infarct volumes and better neurological
behaviors associated with brain injury, compared with
those in wt mice after MCAO (Fig. 5A). The protection
was long lasting, even observed 7 days after MCAO.
Further study found decreased neuronal cell death in the
penumbra of the ischemic brain from HV1−/− mice (Wu
and others 2012). Additional evidence demonstrated that
microglial HV1 contributes to neuronal death and ischemic brain damage via the NOX pathway using a microglia-neuron co-culture system. These results suggest that
HV1 plays a critical role in microglial-derived ROS generation that accounts for a significant amount of neuronal
cell death and brain injury that occurs after experimental
stroke in mice (Wu and others 2012) (Fig. 5B). ROS target DNA, membrane lipids, phosphatases/kinases, proapoptotic transcription factors, and ion channels to exert

cell toxicity (Nathan and Ding 2010). TRPM2 and
TRPM7 channels are particularly interesting ROS targets, as both ion channels are implicated in stroke-related
neuronal cell death (Wu and others 2010) (Fig. 5B).
Alternatively, a NOX-independent HV1 function in cell
death might involve neuronal acid-sensing ion channel
(ASICs) (Fig. 6B), beacuse ASICs are proton-gated ion
channels abundantly expressed in central neurons and are
highly sensitive to extracellular acidosis (Wu and others
2004). Coincidently, both ASIC1a knockout mice and
HV1−/− mice show a reduced brain damage phenotype
after ischemic stroke (Wu and others 2012; Xiong and
others 2004).
Recent studies using NOX inhibitors in experimental
stroke show conflicting results, perhaps due to poor NOX
selectivity (Bedard and Krause 2007). HV1 channels may
be more tractable targets for prevention of brain injury
during ischemia, because (1) HV1 is a relatively simple
homodimer (Tombola and others 2008), whereas NOX is
assembled as a complex of diverse proteins (Bedard and
Krause 2007). (2) Because HV1 conducts 10 to 100 protons for every NOX electron transfer, there are presumably many fewer HV1 channels per NOX complex
(DeCoursey 2003). The requisite of lower numbers of
HV1 molecules binding for inhibition might translate into
lower doses of therapeutics. (3) HV1 inhibitors would target only microglial but not neuronal NOX in the brain.
However, currently there is no available selective HV1
antagonist that holds therapeutic potential (Hong and others 2013). In addition, it is highly improbable that microglial HV1 evolved to be detrimental to the brain because
only benign and advantageous mutations endure the process of natural selection. The more plausible explanation
is that microglial HV1 exert their innate immune response
to stroke insults, which is associated with damage to neurons. Microglial HV1 might also have beneficial roles in
tissue repair and remodeling following ischemic injury.
Neuroprotective or neurodegenerative functions of
microglial HV1 may depend on the stimuli/signal it
receives as well as temporal and spatial generation of
microglial ROS in the ischemic brain. In addition, a
potential side effect of targeting HV1 in stroke treatment
is possible immunosuppression, considering the critical
function of HV1 in the immune system. Although our previous study showed that HV1−− mice do not have a bacterial infection phenotype, poststroke infections in these
mice should be further investigated when targeting
microglial HV1 for stroke treatment.
Given that HV1 is one of the major ion channels in
microglia, stepping back and examining the general role
of microglia in the brain is a practical approach to understanding HV1 function. Traditionally, microglia were
largely implicated only in pathological conditions,
including ischemic stroke, Alzheimer’s disease,

HV1 channel aids NOX in the production of ROS, which is able to activate neuronal TRP channels, such as TRPM2 and TRPM7.

neuropathic pain, epilepsy, bacterial meningitis, multiple
sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, HIV dementia, Huntington’s disease, and NasuHakola disease (Perry and others 2010). In theory,
microglial HV1 could potentially be involved in any of
these pathological conditions. Using HV1−/− mice, our
recent results suggest that spinal microglial HV1dependent ROS is critical for neuropathic pain, whereas
brain microglial HV1 is involved in the phagocytosis of
β-amyloid in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (Wu
and others, unpublished data). In addition, HV1−/− mice
are being tested in other disease models, such as
Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord
injury by several research groups. The resulting characterizations of microglial HV1 in these various neurological diseases will enrich our understanding of microglia
and HV1 channel function in the brain as well as in
peripheral systems. Recent studies also suggest that
microglia play interesting roles under physiological conditions, particularly in nervous system development and
maintenance (Eyo and Wu 2013; Schafer and others
2013). Indeed, microglia have close interactions with
neurons observed in vivo or in situ (Fig. 6A). It is possible that HV1 could potentially exert a central role in
microglia-neuron communication by releasing proton
and ROS production. The microglia-derived protons and
ROS can target neuronal ASICs and TRP channels,

respectively (Fig. 6B). Future studies are needed to test
these interesting ideas.

Conclusion and Future Directions
In summary, HV1 is a newly discovered ion channel primarily expressed in the immune system to support NOX
activity in innate immunity. In the brain, HV1 is highly
and selectively expressed in microglia and is one of the
major ion channels in resting microglia. The cellular
functions of microglial HV1 include pH regulation and
NOX-dependent ROS production. The physiological or
pathological significance of HV1 in vivo is largely dependent on the phenotypes of HV1−/− mice. In the ischemic
brain, microglial HV1 is thought to be coupled to NOX
activation, thereby generating ROS and causing neuronal
cell death. HV1 might represent a novel therapeutic target
for the treatment of ischemic stroke and other neurological disorders related to ROS and neuroinflammation,
such as Alzheimer’s disease, neuropathic pain, epilepsy,
bacterial meningitis, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, HIV dementia,
Huntington’s disease, and Nasu-Hakola disease (Perry
and others 2010). Future studies are needed to determine
the role of microglial Hv1 in these diseases. Particularly,
the beneficial role of microglial HV1 as well as NOXindependent mechanisms of HV1 function in microglia in
