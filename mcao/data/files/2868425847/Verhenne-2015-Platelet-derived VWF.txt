cells and megakaryocytes. Megakaryocyte-derived VWF is stored in a-granules of

VWF-glycoprotein (GP)Ib interaction abrogated this platelet VWF-mediated injury. These
data suggest that whereas platelet-derived VWF does not play a crucial role in hemostasis and arterial thrombosis, it aggravates
thrombo-inflammatory diseases such as stroke via a GPIb-dependent mechanism. (Blood. 2015;126(14):1715-1722)

Key Points

Introduction
Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is an adhesive multimeric glycoprotein
that is crucial for normal hemostasis. The best-known functions of
VWF are facilitating platelet adhesion at sites of vascular injury
and protecting clotting factor VIII against early degradation in the
circulation. Consequently, absence or dysfunction of VWF results
in bleeding symptoms, as observed in patients with von Willebrand
disease.1 Intriguingly, it has become clear that VWF is also implicated in various nonhemostatic processes, such as tumor metastasis,
inﬂammation, and angiogenesis.2 In particular, the pathophysiological role of VWF in ischemic stroke has recently gained increased
attention.3-7
Biosynthesis of VWF is restricted to endothelial cells (ECs) and
megakaryocytes. Endothelial VWF is constitutively secreted into
plasma and subendothelium, or stored as “ultra-large” (UL)-VWF
multimers in Weibel-Palade bodies. VWF produced in megakaryocytes ends up as UL-VWF in the a-granules of platelets. VWF present in endothelial and platelet storage organelles is secreted in a
regulated process in response to stimulation by secretagogues.
Platelets contain a signiﬁcant amount of VWF, accounting for
15% to 20% of the total amount of circulating VWF. Interestingly,
an increasing body of evidence shows that platelet VWF differs in
various biochemical aspects from endothelial VWF.8 Williams
et al9 showed that platelet VWF binds more efﬁciently to glycoprotein
(GP)IIb/IIIa and heparin in comparison with plasma VWF, whereas,

it is less capable of binding to GPIb. Divergent glycosylation
proﬁles could explain these differences. Indeed, platelet VWF exists
as a distinct glycoform, characterized by a signiﬁcantly reduced
degree of N-linked sialylation and by the absence of expression of
AB blood group determinants.8,10 This differential glycosylation
also renders platelet VWF more resistant to ADAMTS13 proteolysis.10 With platelet VWF being enriched in UL-VWF, this
resistance to ADAMTS13 cleavage could become particularly relevant
in settings where local accumulation of UL-VWF is detrimental, such
as cerebral or myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.6,11,12 Given
variable platelet VWF antigen and activity levels between individuals, it is important to understand the biological activity of this
speciﬁc pool of VWF. Only a few studies have tried to dissect the
different (patho)physiological roles of platelet and plasma VWF.
Although experimental evidence shows that platelet VWF indeed
contributes to initial platelet adhesion to collagen at sites of vascular injury 13-15 in vivo data on the role of platelet VWF in
thrombosis is limited. The role of VWF from platelets in ischemic
stroke has never been investigated. In the present study, we found
that plasma VWF, but not platelet VWF is needed for normal
hemostasis and carotid artery thrombus formation, whereas platelet
VWF by itself is able to mediate ischemic brain injury via a GPIbdependent mechanism, shedding new light on the role of platelet
VWF in thrombo-inﬂammatory disease.

Methods
Mice
2/2

FeCl3-induced carotid artery thrombosis model
16

(VWF knockout [KO]) and littermate wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J
Vwf
mice were used. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with
protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
the KU Leuven (Belgium).
Bone marrow transplantation
Bone marrow cells were collected from the femur and tibia of 6- to 10-week-old
donor mice. The mononuclear cell (MNC) population was isolated using Ficoll
gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque Premium 1.084; GE Healthcare, Waukesha,
IL). The 6- to 8-week-old recipient VWF KO and WT mice were conditioned
for cellular transplantation with a single lethal dose of 1100 cGy total body
irradiation using a dual linear energy accelerator (Clinac DHX, 6MV; Varian
Medical Systems, CA). Twenty-four hours after irradiation 10 3 106 MNC,
dissolved in 250 mL sterile phosphate-buffered saline, were infused by intravenous injection in irradiated recipient mice. Three to four weeks after transplantation, full chimerism was conﬁrmed via ﬂow cytometry.
Blood collection
Animals were anesthetized using 5% isoﬂurane (Nicholas Piramal Limited,
London, UK) in 100% O2. Blood was collected by retro-orbital puncture on
0.5 M EDTA (1 volume to 40 volumes of blood) or 3.8% trisodium citrate (1 volume
to 6 volumes of blood). EDTA-treated blood was used to determine platelet
counts using the Hemavet 950FS Multi-species Hematology system (Drew
Scientiﬁc, Oxford, CT). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared from citrated
blood by centrifugation at 325 g for 5 minutes at room temperature and immediately used for ﬂow cytometric analysis. Platelet-poor plasma was prepared
from citrated blood by centrifugation at 4300 g for 6 minutes at 4°C and stored
at 220°C for further analysis.
Flow cytometry
At 3 to 4 weeks after transplantation, citrated PRP was prepared from
chimeric and control mice. After ﬁxation, permeabilized platelets were incubated with a primary rabbit anti-human VWF antibody (1:100; Dako,
Glostrup, Denmark) and a secondary ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated
swine anti-rabbit antibody (1:40; Dako), as described in the supplemental Methods on the Blood web site. To quantify the relative amount of
VWF-positive platelets, a standard curve (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%
VWF-positive platelets) was made by combining PRP from WT and VWF
KO mice. Results were expressed as percentage of WT values. To identify
the platelet population, platelets were stained with rat anti-mouse CD41
antibody conjugated with phycoerythrin (1:50; eBioscience, San Diego,
CA). Expression of CD41 and intracellular platelet VWF was determined
using a Beckman Coulter EPICS XL-MCL ﬂow cytometer and analyzed
with the WinMDI 2.9 free FACS analysis software.
VWF and FVIII analysis
VWF antigen levels in plasma were determined using an in-house developed
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A detailed description of this assay is provided in the supplemental Methods. Factor VIII (FVIII) activity (FVIII:C) in
mouse plasma was determined using the COATEST SP4 FVIII (Chromogenix, Molndal, Sweden), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Pooled
plasma from 10 to 20 WT mice was used as a reference (100%) and results
were expressed as percentage of WT values.
Tail clip bleeding time assay
Tail clip bleeding times were assessed as described.17 At 5 to 6 weeks after
transplantation, mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (80 mg/g; Nembutal, Ceva Santé Animale, Brussels, Belgium).
Immediately after removing 5 mm of the tail tip using a surgical scalpel, the tail
was immersed in 0.9% NaCl prewarmed at 37°C. The time until blood loss

At 8 to 10 weeks after transplantation, mice were anesthetized using 2.5%
isoﬂurane in 100% O2. The right carotid artery was subsequently exposed
and a Doppler ﬂow probe (Transonic TS420 perivascular ﬂowmeter module; AD Instruments, Oxford, UK) was positioned around the artery to
monitor blood ﬂow via a laser Doppler perfusion monitor (PeriFlux System
5000; Perimed AB, Järfälla-Stockholm, Sweden) coupled to a PowerLab
8/35 data acquisition unit (AD Instruments) using LabChart v8.0.5 software
(AD Instruments). Arterial thrombosis was induced by applying a piece of
Whatman ﬁlter paper (1 3 1 mm; GE Healthcare) saturated in 12% FeCl3
solution, for 3 minutes upstream of the ﬂow probe. The time to occlusion
was recorded. If the time to occlusion exceeded 50 minutes, the experiment
was ended.
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced 8 to 10 weeks after transplantation by
60 minutes transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, as described.5 To
block the VWF-GPIb interaction, 100 mg rat anti-mouse GPIba (p0p/B)
Fab18 or rat IgG Fab control was injected intravenously 5 minutes after
inducing reperfusion of the right middle cerebral artery. All stroke experiments were conducted according to the recommendations for research in
experimental stroke studies and the current ARRIVE guidelines (http://
www.nc3rs.org/ARRIVE). Animals were randomly assigned to the operators by independent persons not involved in data acquisition and analysis.
Surgeries and evaluation of all readout parameters were performed while
being blinded to the experimental groups.
Determination of infarct size
Assessment of infarct size was performed 24 hours after induction of
cerebral ischemia, as described.5 After sacriﬁcing the animal, the brain was
removed and sectioned in three consecutive 2-mm thick sections. Sections
were stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich)
in phosphate-buffered saline and ﬁxated. Pictures were taken and the infarct
volume was calculated via planimetry (ImageJ software, National Institutes
of Health).
Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis for ﬁbrin/ﬁbrinogen was performed as previously
described.5 The 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride-stained coronal brain sections of 1 mouse were separated in ipsilateral and contralateral parts, pooled, and
homogenized. Immunoreactivity for ﬁbrin(ogen) [anti-ﬁbrin(ogen) pAb 1:500;
Acris Antibodies GmbH, Herford, Germany] was detected by western blot
analysis and quantiﬁed by densitometry using ImageJ software. Actin served as
a loading control. The amount of ﬁbrin(ogen) was normalized to the actin signal.
The ratio of the normalized ipsilateral ﬁbrin(ogen) band density relative to the
normalized band density of contralateral ﬁbrin(ogen) served as a measurement
for relative ﬁbrin(ogen) deposition. A detailed description of this assay is provided in the supplemental Methods.
Statistics
Data are expressed as mean 6 standard error of the mean. For statistical analysis,
the Prism Version 6.0 software (GraphPad Software; La Jolla, CA) was used.
Statistical analysis was conducted using one-way analysis of variance followed
by the Tukey’s multiple comparison post hoc test to assess variance between
FVIII:C levels, cerebral infarct sizes, and ﬁbrinogen deposition in different experimental groups. The Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison post hoc test was used to compare plasma VWF antigen levels, tail clip
bleeding times, and arterial occlusion times. Values of P , .05 were considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Generation of chimeric mice expressing VWF only in
megakaryocytes or endothelial cells

To determine the contribution of platelet VWF in hemostasis and
thrombosis, we generated chimeric mice that produced VWF only in
megakaryocytes or ECs, respectively. MNCs were isolated from WT
donor mice and transplanted into lethally irradiated VWF KO acceptor
mice, resulting in chimeric mice with only platelet VWF (VWF
PLT chimeric mice) (Figure 1A). By transplanting VWF KO MNCs
into WT acceptor mice, chimeric mice that speciﬁcally lack VWF in
platelets were obtained (VWF EC chimeric mice) (Figure 1B). No
difference in platelet count between chimeric, VWF KO, and WT mice
was observed (data not shown). To conﬁrm successful transplantation,
the relative amount of VWF-containing platelets was determined via
ﬂow cytometry (Figure 1C). As in VWF KO mice, no VWF-positive
platelets were detected in VWF EC chimeric mice. The relative amount
of VWF-positive platelets in VWF PLT chimeric mice (98.44 6 1.87%;
n 5 18) was similar to WT mice (99.94 6 1.31%; n 5 12) (Figure 1C).

Absence of VWF-positive platelets in VWF EC chimeric mice
conﬁrms previous ﬁndings that endocytosis of VWF from plasma
to platelet a-granules does not occur.15,19 As expected, platelets do not seem to release signiﬁcant amounts of VWF into
the circulation under normal conditions (Figure 1D). Indeed,
normal plasma levels of VWF antigen were found in WT mice
(99.9 6 7.1%; n 5 16) and VWF EC chimeric mice (106.3 6 9.3%;
n 5 8), whereas no detectable levels of VWF were observed in
plasma of VWF KO mice (n 5 14) and most VWF PLT chimeric
mice (n 5 21). However, in some (7 of 21) VWF PLT chimeric mice,
there were trace amounts of VWF observed, which could account for
the slightly (but nonsigniﬁcantly) increased FVIII activity (14.3 6 1%;
n 5 16) compared with VWF KO mice (6.3 6 0.4%; n 5 12)
(Figure 1E). FVIII activity levels in the VWF EC chimeric mice
(83.6 6 3.1%; n 5 10) were slightly decreased when compared
with WT mice (100 6 4.6%; n 5 12), but remained in the normal
range (Figure 1E). These data further conﬁrm the notion that
plasma VWF mainly originates from endothelial cells and that no
platelet VWF is constitutively secreted into the circulation under
normal circumstances.

However, the exact role of platelet VWF in in vivo thrombus
formation in mice has never been studied. To address this question,
we performed a FeCl3-induced carotid artery thrombosis model
(Figure 3). In WT mice, an occlusive thrombus was consistently
formed within 10 minutes (9.2 6 0.5 minutes; n 5 8). In contrast, no
occlusive thrombus was formed within the ﬁrst 50 minutes in VWF
KO mice (n 5 5). Interestingly, arterial occlusion times in VWF EC
chimeric mice (10.6 6 0.4 minutes; n 5 6) were similar to WT mice,
whereas no occlusive thrombi were formed in VWF PLT chimeric
mice (n 5 8). These results indicate that on the one hand, plateletderived VWF alone is not able to support normal thrombus formation
in this model, and that on the other hand, lack of VWF in platelets does
not affect normal arterial thrombosis.
Both endothelial cell- and platelet-derived VWF alone are able
to mediate ischemic brain injury
Figure 2. Plasma VWF is the major determinant to control bleeding in a tail clip
bleeding assay. Five mm of the tail of WT (n 5 15), VWF KO (n 5 14), VWF PLT
chimeric (n 5 16), and VWF EC chimeric (n 5 9) mice was removed. Subsequent tail
bleeding in pre-warmed saline was monitored and the time needed to stop the bleeding
was recorded. If bleeding did not end within the first 10 minutes, the experiment was
ended with a recorded bleeding time of 600 seconds. ns, not statistically significant.

Plasma, but not platelet VWF, is the major determinant for
normal hemostasis

To unravel the speciﬁc role of platelet VWF in hemostasis, we used our
chimeric mice in a tail clip bleeding assay. After removing 5 mm of the
tip of the tail, the time needed to stop bleeding was recorded (Figure 2).
As expected, most WT animals stopped bleeding within 3 minutes
(100.9 6 18.7 seconds; n 5 15), whereas VWF KO mice were not able
to control the bleeding within 10 minutes (.600 seconds; n 5 14).
Interestingly, most of the VWF PLT chimeric mice also bled longer
than 10 minutes (528.2 6 38.9 seconds; n 5 16). Bleeding stopped
spontaneously in 3 of 16 mice (19%). In chimeric mice that only produced endothelial cell–derived VWF, bleeding times were comparable
to those of WT mice (101.1 6 17.3 seconds; n 5 9). These data suggest
that platelet VWF alone is not able to support normal hemostasis and
that lack of platelet VWF does not affect bleeding in this model.
Plasma, but not platelet VWF, regulates arterial
thrombus formation

Ex vivo ﬂow chamber studies have previously shown that plateletderived VWF plays a role in platelet adhesion to collagen.13-15

We and others have shown that VWF plays a crucial role in ischemic
stroke most probably by recruiting platelets and leukocytes in the reperfused tissue.3-5 Interestingly, absence of ADAMTS13 further aggravates ischemic brain damage, suggesting a speciﬁc contribution of
UL-VWF multimers in the pathophysiology of stroke.4,12,20 Given the
abundance of UL-VWF multimers in a-granules of platelets, we explored the speciﬁc contribution of platelet VWF in ischemic brain injury. After 60 minutes of focal cerebral ischemia, blood ﬂow in the
middle cerebral artery was restored to allow reperfusion of the ischemic
territory. Twenty-four hours after induction of ischemia, cerebral infarction sizes were determined (Figure 4). In accordance with our previous studies,3,5 cerebral infarct sizes observed in VWF KO mice
(34.4 6 5.2 mm3; n 5 12) were signiﬁcantly reduced compared with
WT mice (78.9 6 10.2 mm3; n 5 10). As expected, VWF EC chimeric
mice developed infarcts that were similar in size to WT animals
(76.7 6 8.4 mm3; n 5 9). Surprisingly, however, VWF PLT chimeric
mice expressing VWF only in platelets also showed infarct sizes that
were similar to WT mice (79.6 6 8.1 mm3; n 5 16). Because cranial
irradiation may induce persistent neuroinﬂammation in C57BL/6J
mouse brain21,22 we tested lethally irradiated VWF KO mice transplanted
with VWF KO MNCs to exclude any potential effect of irradiation on
cerebral injury in our model (Figure 4C). In this separate set of
experiments, infarct sizes were still small (18.71 6 4.31 mm3; n 5 7) and
comparable with those observed in VWF KO mice (19.43 6 5.49 mm3;
n 5 7). Hence, the irradiation procedure had no effect on infarct size
in VWF KO animals. Together, these data show that the presence of
either platelet VWF or plasma VWF alone is sufﬁcient to cause VWFmediated ischemic stroke injury.

Figure 3. Plasma VWF, but not platelet VWF, determines thrombotic occlusion rates in a carotid
artery thrombosis model. (A) The carotid artery of
WT (n 5 8), VWF KO (n 5 5), VWF PLT chimeric

application of a filter paper saturated with 12% FeCl3.
Carotid artery blood flow was monitored and the time
needed to form an occlusive thrombus was recorded. If
no occlusion occurred within 50 minutes, the experiment was ended (time to occlusion of 50 minutes).

PLATELET VWF IN ISCHEMIC STROKE

GPIb, collagen, and platelet GPIIb/IIIa. Interestingly, however,
Williams et al9 have shown that platelet-derived VWF binds GPIba
with lower afﬁnity than plasma VWF. To test whether binding of
platelet VWF to GPIb is important in ischemic stroke, we blocked
the VWF-GPIba axis using an anti-GPIba (p0p/B) Fab fragment
(Figure 5).23 Administration of p0p/B signiﬁcantly reduced cerebral
infarct development in VWF PLT chimeric mice (44.8 6 10.19 mm3;
n 5 8) to levels as observed in VWF KO mice (43.38 6 10.02 mm3;
n 5 5). These were half the size of those observed in nontreated WT
mice (92.19 6 11.52 mm3; n 5 6) or VWF PLT chimeric mice that
received IgG control Fab (83.07 6 3.7 mm3; n 5 12). These data
suggest that the detrimental effect of platelet VWF in ischemic stroke
is mediated by a platelet GPIba-dependent mechanism.
It is interesting to note that no cerebral hemorrhagic events were
observed in all experimental groups after macroscopic analysis of
whole brains and of 2-mm brain sections (data not shown), which is
in line with our previous studies.3,5,23
Platelet-derived VWF exacerbates ischemic brain injury by
promoting intracerebral thrombosis

To gain further insight on how platelet VWF promotes cerebral injury,
we measured ﬁbrin(ogen) deposition in the brain after stroke (Figure 6).

Figure 4. Platelet-derived VWF alone mediates ischemic stroke injury. Transient
focal cerebral ischemia was induced by 60 minutes occlusion of the right middle
cerebral artery, followed by 23 hours of reperfusion in WT (n 5 12), VWF KO
(n 5 10), VWF PLT chimeric (n 5 16), and VWF EC chimeric (n 5 9) mice. (A)

Platelet VWF-mediated ischemic brain injury is

Next we wanted to further elucidate the mechanism by which platelet
VWF exacerbates ischemic stroke. The main interactions of VWF in
platelet adhesion and thrombus formation are binding to platelet

Figure 6. Platelet-derived VWF contributes to ischemic
brain injury by promoting intracerebral thrombosis.
Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced by
60 minutes occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery,
followed by 23 hours of reperfusion in WT (n 5 9), VWF
KO (n 5 8), nontreated VWF PLT chimeric (n 5 7), antiGPIba Fab-treated VWF PLT chimeric (p0p/B, n 5 5),
and control IgG Fab-treated VWF PLT chimeric (IgG
Fab; n 5 6) mice. Twenty-four hours after induction of
ischemia, the amount of fibrin(ogen) in both the contralateral and ipsilateral hemisphere was determined by semiquantitative western blot analysis. (A) Representative
immunoblot showing accumulation of fibrin(ogen) in
ipsilateral (I) and contralateral (C) hemispheres. (B) Band
intensities from A were quantified by densitometry. Each
fibrin(ogen) density signal was first normalized to the
corresponding actin density signal. The ratio of the
normalized ipsilateral fibrin(ogen) density relative to
the normalized contralateral fibrin(ogen) band served
as a measurement for relative fibrin(ogen) deposition
(ratio ipsilateral/contralateral [ratio IPSI/CONTRA]).
ns, not statistically significant. *P , .05; **P , .01;
***P , .001.

In WT mice, the ischemic hemisphere contained almost four times
more ﬁbrin(ogen) than the contralateral hemisphere (ratio ipsilateral/
contralateral of 3.69 6 0.37; n 5 9) 24 hours after stroke, suggesting
thrombotic events occurring during the ischemia/reperfusion phase.
In VWF KO mice, signiﬁcantly less ﬁbrin(ogen) was found in the ipsilateral hemisphere (only a 1.44 6 0.17-fold increase of contralateral;
n 5 8). Reconstitution of the platelet VWF compartment in VWF KO
mice (VWF PLT chimeric mice) again signiﬁcantly increased cerebral
ﬁbrin(ogen) deposition in the affected hemisphere (ratio ipsilateral/
contralateral of 2.99 6 0.56; n 5 7). Interestingly, when VWF PLT
chimeric mice were treated with anti-GPIba Fab, ﬁbrin(ogen) in the
ipsilateral hemispheres was reduced (ratio ipsilateral/contralateral
of 1.28 6 0.10; n 5 5). Administration of control IgG Fab to VWF
PLT chimeric mice did not alter ﬁbrin(ogen) deposition in the brain
(ratio ipsilateral/contralateral of 3.75 6 0.34; n 5 6). These data suggest
a signiﬁcant contribution of platelet-derived VWF in intracerebral ﬁbrin
(ogen) deposition during ischemic stroke that depends on VWF binding
to GPIba.

Discussion
As a main ﬁnding of this study, we showed that platelet VWF is not
essential for normal hemostasis and arterial thrombus formation, but
this speciﬁc pool of VWF can contribute to ischemic brain injury via
a GPIba-dependent mechanism.
Although normal plasma VWF levels were observed in VWF EC
chimeric mice, no VWF was detected in their platelets. This observation
conﬁrms earlier transplantation studies performed in both mice15 and
pigs,19 and this corroborates the absence of VWF in platelets of von
Willebrand disease type 3 patients after replacement therapy.24 Hence,
our data further support the hypothesis that platelet VWF originates
solely from megakaryocytes and is not taken up from plasma, in

contrast to ﬁbrinogen, for example. Chimeric mice with VWF only
in platelets did not show any signiﬁcant amounts of VWF in plasma. In
addition, no signiﬁcant increase in circulating FVIII was observed. Similar observations were obtained in chimeric pigs.19 Interestingly, Kanaji
et al15 showed trace amounts of circulating VWF in chimeric mice that
only have VWF in platelets. One possible explanation of this discrepancy could be a difference in VWF enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay detection sensitivities. Alternatively, slight platelet activation can
result in the release of VWF in the plasma.
The contribution of platelet-derived VWF in normal hemostasis is
still not totally clear. Case studies in humans suggested that plateletderived VWF is beneﬁcial for normalization of bleeding.25-28 Our tail
clip bleeding experiments show that endothelial cell-derived VWF is
the major determinant in the process of normal hemostasis. This concept is further supported by earlier observations of defective hemostasis
in mice15 and pigs29,30 with VWF only in platelets. Furthermore, hydrodynamic gene transfer experiments that target the liver for VWF expression also show that VWF present only in plasma can correct the
bleeding diathesis of VWF KO mice.17,31 Nevertheless, we observed
that a small subset (19%) of mice expressing VWF only in platelets had
partially corrected bleeding times, suggesting that in some cases
platelet-derived VWF is more or less able to support hemostasis.
Similar results were obtained by Kanaji et al15 who showed that 38% of
their VWF PLT chimeric mice also had a partially corrected bleeding
time. Why bleeding stopped in some of our VWF PLT chimeric mice
remains unclear. These mice did not show higher platelet counts nor did
they have higher levels of plasma VWF or FVIII. Although less likely,
differences in size and quantity of VWF in the platelet granules might
contribute to these observations. More studies are needed,
preferably using bleeding models that more closely mimic clinically
relevant human hemorrhage, to further clarify the speciﬁc function of
platelet VWF in bleeding.
Platelet VWF is important for initial in vitro platelet adhesion
on collagen-coated surfaces.15,30 To test whether this is relevant for in

vivo thrombus formation, we used a FeCl3-induced carotid artery
thrombosis model. Interestingly, mice having VWF only in platelets
could not form occlusive thrombi, whereas chimeric mice with only
endothelial cell–derived VWF did so within 10 minutes. Thus, overall
arterial thrombus formation does not seem to be largely dependent on
VWF in platelets, which is in line with earlier thrombosis studies in
chimeric pigs.29 In our model, we were not able to assess initial platelet
adhesion rates after carotid artery injury, but lack of VWF in platelets
seemed to slow down the rate of blood ﬂow reduction compared with
WT mice, an effect that was lost, however, in the total kinetics of
occlusive thrombus formation in the large carotid artery. Studies using
other thrombosis models would be helpful to further explore the
speciﬁc role of platelet VWF in thrombus formation.
Increased platelet adhesion at sites of vascular injury could be
important in thrombotic pathologies affecting the microcirculation such
as ischemic stroke. We and others have shown that VWF KO mice
are protected from stroke.3-5 Chimeric mice that lack VWF in platelets
developed the same cerebral infarctions as observed in WT animals,
suggesting that plasma VWF alone can mediate the VWF-dependent
ischemic brain injury. These ﬁndings are in agreement with the same
large infarctions observed in VWF KO mice reconstituted with plasma
VWF via hydrodynamic VWF gene transfer.5 Surprisingly, stroke
lesions in VWF PLT chimeric mice were also similar to those seen in
WT mice. Indeed, whereas VWF PLT chimeric mice display
a phenotype similar to VWF KO animals in the tail clip bleeding and
carotid artery thrombosis model, this is not the case in the stroke model.
Hence, the contribution of VWF in platelets seems to be speciﬁcally
relevant in the setting of cerebral ischemia. In addition, we observed an
increased intracerebral deposition of ﬁbrin(ogen) in VWF PLT
chimeric mice compared with VWF KO mice indicating that local
release of platelet VWF can promote intracerebral thrombosis. It
is tempting to speculate that platelets adhere to activated endothelium
(or subendothelium) in the area of ischemia/reperfusion and upon
activation, secrete their granular contents, including large amounts of
UL-VWF. This may result in the formation of platelet-derived VWF
strings that may even be more resistant to ADAMTS13 proteolysis.10,32
Similar to endothelial cell–derived VWF strings, VWF strings from
platelets could recruit new platelets and inﬂammatory cells resulting in
platelet/leukocyte plugs that block the microvasculature and
contribute to the no-reﬂow phenomenon. Interestingly, such platelet
derived-VWF strings have been shown in vitro.33 Future studies
speciﬁcally addressing the inﬂammatory nature of plateletderived VWF will deﬁnitely shed more light on its role in this
thrombo-inﬂammatory process.

PLATELET VWF IN ISCHEMIC STROKE

1721

Despite in vitro data showing that puriﬁed platelet VWF has a lower
afﬁnity for GPIba than plasma VWF,9 we found that platelet VWF
mediates ischemic brain injury via a GPIb-dependent mechanism. This
ﬁnding further supports the crucial importance of the VWF-GPIb axis
in stroke.5-7,23,34 Although p0p/B is not cytotoxic to platelets,23 we
observed a small decrease in platelet count in p0p/B-treated mice
compared with the control group (657.4 6 115.6 vs 895.7 6 107.1,
respectively; P , .01). This difference in platelet count cannot, however, account for the observed difference in infarct size as 10% of normal platelet counts is already sufﬁcient to induce full brain infarction
after transient ischemic stroke.35
In conclusion, our data shed an unexpected new light on the activity
of platelet VWF and expand our insights on VWF-mediated mechanisms underlying ischemic stroke. This study further supports the idea
that blocking the GPIb-VWF axis would be an interesting novel
treatment strategy in stroke.
