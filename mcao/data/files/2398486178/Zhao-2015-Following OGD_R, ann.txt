Abstract Transient receptor potential cation channel,
subfamily M, member 7 (TRPM7) is a bifunctional
channel protein that contains an α-kinase domain at its
C-terminal. Previous studies have indicated that oxygenglucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) induces
neuronal apoptosis via TRPM7. Annexin 1 and myosin
IIA have been identified as TRPM7 kinase substrates;
however, the role of annexin 1 in OGD/R-induced neuron apoptosis remains unclear. Here, we report that
OGD/R induces nuclear translocation of annexin 1 in
primary cultured neurons. Interestingly, ablation of the
TRPM7 kinase or a point mutation in Ser5 interferes
with TRPM7 kinase-annexin 1 binding, decreasing
annexin 1 nuclear translocation, and thereby reducing
neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, mutation of Arg205,
which intercepts annexin 1-formyl peptide receptor
binding, also decreased annexin 1 nuclear translocation.
Coimmunoprecipitation indicated that annexin 1 is
moved as cargo through the cytoplasm by myosin IIA.
However, inhibiting myosin IIA can decrease annexin 1
nuclear translocation. Moreover, blocking myosin IIA
function by antagonist injection into the lateral ventricle
was found to improve learning and memory in rats after
middle cerebral artery occlusion and could also improve
cell viability after OGD/R. Last, we determined that the
annexin 1-myosin IIA complex is recognized and

Introduction
Neuronal apoptosis following an ischemic event is a complicated process, with Ca2+ overload playing a major factor in the
eventual excitotoxic demise of neurons [1, 2]. Transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 7
(TRPM7) has been identified as a bifunctional channel protein, which contains an α-kinase domain on its intracellular Cterminal [3]. Aarts et al. have described a novel mechanism
whereby gating of TRPM7, a Ca2+-permeable nonselective
cation channel, mediates Ca2+ overload and the eventual death
of anoxic neurons [4]. Additionally, it has been reported that
the TRPM7 kinase domain participates in Fas-induced apoptosis [5]. Our previous study showed that, following oxygenglucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R), TRPM7 channel activation resulted in an influx of Ca2+ as well as Mg2+ [6].
Taken together, these studies suggest that TRPM7 is involved,
as a channel protein, in neuronal apoptosis. Annexin 1, particularly a conserved serine residue (Ser5) [7], has been identified as a substrate for the TRPM7 kinase. Annexin 1 is a
Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding protein, which can promote
Ca2+-dependent membrane fusion [8, 9]. Furthermore, it has
been shown that when annexin 1 interacts with the formyl
peptide receptor (FPR), it can modulate neutrophil

730

extravasation and play a role in the anti-inflammatory response [10]. Our previous study indicated that following
FPR interaction, annexin 1 can elicit analgesic effects in
inflammatory pain at the level of the dorsal root ganglion
[11]. In contrast, Zhang et al. found that in cancer cells,
annexin 1 association with NF-κB can suppress NF-κB transcriptional activity by preventing its binding to DNA; interestingly, this is accompanied by enhanced apoptosis [12]. It
has recently been found that upregulated annexin 1 expression
in DU145 cells can induce cell apoptosis via a mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway [13]. We therefore hypothesize that
annexin 1 performs diverse roles in different cells, subcellular
structures, and/or disease models.
Myosins are motor proteins in cells, which move along
actin by changing shape after making stereospecific interactions with actin subunits [14]. Most researchers are familiar
with the two-headed myosin II involved in contractility and
tension generation, which is regulated by the phosphorylation
of its light and heavy chains [15, 16]. Myosin IIA is phosphorylated by the TRPM7 kinase [15, 17, 18]. However, the
effect of the TRPM7 kinase on myosin IIA activation after
OGD/R and whether myosin IIA is involved in OGD/Rinduced cargo transport remain unclear.
In this study, we investigated the effects of TRPM7 kinase
on annexin 1 after OGD/R, and explored the role of annexin 1
in neuronal apoptosis. Subcellular translocation of annexin 1
seems to be involved in neuron apoptosis after OGD/R.
However, the process of annexin 1 nuclear translocation is
complicated. It has been shown that FPR, myosin IIA, and
importin β assist annexin 1 transportation and translocation.
Therefore, to investigate whether nuclear translocation of
annexin 1 is involved in cell apoptosis, we conditionally
decreased the expression of annexin 1 in the nucleus to determine its effect on cell viability after OGD/R and learning and
memory in rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO).

Materials and Methods
Animals
Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250±20 g were obtained
from the Experiment Animal Center of Tongji Medical
College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
Animals were kept in a room on a 12-h light-dark cycle at
25 °C with sufficient food and water. All experiments were
performed according to the National Institutes of Health
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory animals (NIH
Publication No. 8023, revised 1978). Efforts were made to
minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of
animals used.

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Following anesthesia with 10 % chloral hydrate, a midline
neck incision to expose the left carotis communis artery was
made. A 4-0 silicon-coated nylon monofilament with a heatthickened cone was inserted over the left carotis communis
artery into the internal carotid artery, which led into the MCA.
The monofilament was left for 60 min in the MCA until
reperfusion. In sham-operated animals, a silicon-coated nylon
monofilament was withdrawn immediately after reaching the
MCA to avoid ischemia [19].
Behavioral Tests
We used the Morris water maze in order to assess learning and
memory. Briefly, rats were trained to find a platform through
context-specific cues located on the walls surrounding the
maze, between 14:00 and 18:00. Water was colored using
ink in order to provide contrast for the rat, and each rat
received 20 trials in each of the four quadrants for 5 days.
Latency and total swim distance were recorded on the fifth
day (one day after surgery) to evaluate learning and memory
[20]. We used an automated shuttle box for the step-through
passive avoidance test, which was divided into an illuminated
compartment and a dark compartment. Animals were placed
into the illuminated compartment, facing away from the dark
compartment, and were allowed to move freely into the dark
compartment. Latency to leave the illuminated compartment
was recorded, and the test was repeated for 5 days (beginning
with the day after surgery). For the active avoidance test, we
used a two-way shuttle box (60×25×25 cm), which was
subdivided into two compartments with independently electrified stainless steel bars as floors, but without any physical
separation between them. Prior to this session, rats were
allowed to freely ambulate in the shuttle box for 2 min in
order to become familiar with the environment. In each trial, a
tone (80 dB, 2.4 kHz) was used as the conditioned stimulus
and was presented for 10 s. Subsequently, an electrical foot
shock 0.9–1.5 mA was given for 10 s. If rats moved to the
other side of the box during the presentation of the conditioned stimulus alone, no shock was presented, and the response was scored as an active avoidance. Total shock number
and active avoidance responses were recorded.
Primary Cortical Neuron Culture
The protocol for the use of rats for neuronal cultures was
performed according to the principles of the Animal Care
Committee of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.
Briefly, cortex tissue was isolated from rat embryos aged at
18 days and incubated with 0.25 % trypsin/EDTA for 15 min
at 37 °C. Freshly prepared Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (DMEM)/F-12 medium containing 10 % fetal bovine

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 51:729–742

serum was used to end the digestion procedure. Fire-polished
glass pipettes were then used to gently triturate the tissue mass
into the cell suspension. Finally, cells were counted and plated
in poly-L-lysine-coated culture dishes, in 6-well plates at a
density of 1×107 cells per well. Neurons were maintained at
37 °C in a humidified 5 % CO2 atmospheric incubator. After
24 h, the culture medium was changed to Neurobasal medium
supplemented with 2 % B-27, and cultures were fed once a
week. Neurons were used for experiments between in vitro
days 7 and 10 [4, 6].
TRPM7-Expressing Cell Lines
Stable transfectant-expressing wild-type (TRPM7/WT) or kinase domain-truncated mutational TRPM7 (TRPM7/ΔKin)
HEK293 cells were established, using the Flp-In system and
Flp-In T-Rex 293 cells. Flp-In T-Rex 293 cells contain the
tetracycline repressor as well as a single Flp recombinase

the TCG codon encoding serine 1501 into a stop codon) (gift
of Loren W. Runnels, UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson
Medical School, USA) was cotransfected into Flp-In T-Rex
293 cells with the Flp recombinase expression plasmid
pOG44 (Invitrogen, USA) using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells with correct integration of our constructs into the single FRT site of the Flp-In T-Rex 293 cells
were selected with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (InvivoGen,
USA) in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and
15 μg/ml blasticidin (InvivoGen, USA). Cell clones were
pooled and maintained in DMEM containing 10 % FBS,
100 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 15 μg/ml blasticidin.

Transfected Flp-In T-Rex 293 cells were defined as 293TRPM7/WT cells (transfected with pcDNA5/FRT/TO/
mTRPM7) and 293-TRPM7/ΔKin cells (pcDNA5/FRT/TO/
mTRPM7ΔKin).
Oxygen Glucose Deprivation/Reoxygenation
Culture medium was changed into glucose-free DMEM equilibrated with nitrogen, and cultures were transferred to an
incubator containing 5 % CO2 and 95 % N2 at 37 °C for
1 h. After washing cultures with DMEM three times, cultures
were maintained in glucose-containing normoxic DMEM at
37 °C in a humidified 5 % CO2 incubator. In all experiments,
the culture medium pH was maintained at 7.2.
Protein Extraction and Preparation
Protein samples were prepared using the Thermo Scientific
NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents kit
according to the recommended protocol.
Apoptosis Assay
The proportion of apoptotic cells was measured by flow
cytometry using Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit
(KeyGEN, Nan Jing, China) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, collected cells were rinsed twice with
prewarmed (37 °C) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2 % bovine serum albumin (BSA), and then resuspended
in binding buffer at 5×105 cells/500 μl, supplemented with
5 μl of Annexin V-FITC and 5 μl of propidium iodide (PI).
After a 10-min incubation at room temperature in the dark,
cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a BD
FACSCalibur TM flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San
Jose, CA).
MTT Assay
Cell survival was determined by assaying the reduction of
methylthiazol tetrazolium (MTT, Sigma, USA). Briefly, cells
were seeded into 96-well plates and subjected to various
treatments. MTT was then added to each well at a final
concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and cells were further incubated
for 4 h at 37 °C. After incubation, media was removed, and
100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added for the
dissolution of formazan crystals. The amount of MTT
formazan was quantified by determining the absorbance at
570 nm using an ELISA plate reader.
Plasmid Construct and Transfection
Plasmids encoding the annexin 1 fragment were constructed
according to standard protocol. The Ser5 mutation to Ala (SA)

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 51:729–742

or Asp (SD) and the Arg205 mutation to Pro were performed
using the Fast Mutagenesis System (TRANSGEN). HEK293
cells were then transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagents
(Invitrogen).
Immunoprecipitation
Immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described
with a slight modification; cellular lysate was divided into two
parts. One portion of the lysate was used for the immunoprecipitation assay, while the other portion was used for total
protein analysis. For immunoprecipitation, proteins were precipitated from cellular lysate with a polyclonal antibody
against annexin 1 (sc-11387, Santa Cruz) at 4 °C on a rotating
device overnight, followed by addition of protein A/G plus
agarose (Santa Cruz, USA) for 2 h. After washing four times
with lysis buffer, samples were eluted by boiling in 1× SDSPAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) sample buffer for 5 min. Proteins were then separated by
SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting using antibodies
against myosin IIA (1:1,000, #3403S, CST), FPR (1:200, sc66901, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), importin β (1:1,000,#86735,
CST), and phosphoserine (1:2,000, ab9332, Abcam).
Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotides
Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ASODN) were designed
according to the sequence of the annexin 1 gene (GenBank
Accession No. NM0007000). Sequences used in this study

Data expressed are mean values ± standard error of

one-way ANOVA combined with the least significant
difference (LSD) test or paired Student’s t test, as appropriate. P ≤ 0.05 was considered to be statistically

Previous data have demonstrated that annexin 1 is
phosphorylated by TRPM7 kinase at Ser5. In order to
investigate the function of TRPM7 kinase on annexin 1
nuclear translocation, we used HEK293/Δkin cells,
which comprised a truncated TRPM7 kinase. As shown
in Fig. 1a, we observed that TRPM7/WT was mainly
localized at the plasma membrane and nuclear membrane, while annexin 1 was evenly distributed throughout the cells. Double-label immunofluorescence analysis revealed colocalization of TRPM7/WT with annexin

coimmunoprecipitation to further evaluate the direct
association of TRPM7 and annexin 1. TRPM7/WT
complexes were precipitated with anti-HA antibodies,
and the presence of annexin 1 was detected by Western
blot. These studies revealed that annexin 1 was only
slightly expressed in a complex with TRPM7/WT in
normal Tet-treated 293-TRPM7/WT cells, while the
number of annexin 1-TRPM7/WT complexes increased
with increasing duration of reoxygenation (Fig. 1b).
This suggests that the interaction between TRPM7
and annexin 1 was enhanced by OGD/R. Tet-treated
293-TRPM7/WT cells expressed higher levels of
annexin 1 than untreated cells or TRPM7/ΔKin cells
24 h after reoxygenation (Fig. 1b, c), suggesting that
OGD/R promoted higher expression of annexin 1 in
293 cells and that the TRPM7 kinase domain played
an important role in this process. Furthermore, annexin

1 precipitated with the phosphoserine antibody, suggesting that OGD/R activated annexin 1 via TRPM7
kinase functional enhancement (Fig. 1d).
The immunofluorescence staining assay (Fig. 2e) showed
that annexin 1 in Tet-pretreated 293-TRPM7/WT cells accumulated to the cell membrane and was predominantly localized to the nucleus after 24 h of reoxygenation. In contrast,
annexin 1 in Tet-untreated 293-TRPM7/WT cells and Tetpretreated 293-TRPM7/ΔK in cells still distributed diffusely
from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Similar results were also
obtained by Western blot analysis. In normal cells, most
annexin 1 was present in the cytosolic fraction, and the expression of annexin 1 in separate cellular fractions in Tettreated cells was not different from untreated cells. However,
after 24 h of reoxygenation, annexin 1 was mostly present in
the nuclear fractions in Tet-untreated 293-TRPM7/WT cells
(Fig. 2a, b), while annexin 1 remained diffusely distributed
from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after OGD/R in Tet-

pretreated 293-TRPM7/ΔKin cells (Fig. 2c, d). These data
suggest that in HEK293 cells, the subcellular translocation of
annexin 1 after OGD/R is dependent on TRPM7 kinase
function.
Western blot results indicated that in primary cultured
neurons treated with 1 h of OGD followed by reoxygenation,
the expression of annexin 1 in the nucleus was markedly
increased, but the expression of annexin 1 in the cytoplasm
was not changed (Fig. 2f, g). We constructed point mutation
annexin 1 Ser5 plasmids, including a point mutation Ser5 to
Ala (S5A), which silenced serine phosphorylation, and mutation to Asp (S5D), which resulted in serine phosphomimetic.
Following transfection of HEK293 cells with the S5A plasmid
for 12 h, we examined the expression of annexin 1 in the
cytoplasm and nucleus. Our results indicated that silencing
Ser5 reduced annexin 1 nuclear translocation with most
annexin 1 being localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2h, i).
Furthermore, following transfection of HEK293 cells with
the S5D plasmid, we found that Ser5 phosphomimetic induced
more annexin 1 nuclear translocation. However, expression of
annexin 1 in the cytoplasm seemed to be unchanged
(Fig. 2j, k). We also used TRPM7 siRNA to partly interfere
with TRPM7 kinase function in neurons and found that a blot
of the precipitate indicated that TRPM7 kinase function was
partly downregulated, resulting in a decrease of annexin 1
nuclear translocation compared with the OGD/R group
(Fig. 2l, m). Together, these results indicate that the TRPM7
kinase functionally determines annexin 1 activation and subcellular translocation.

Interaction Between FPR and Annexin 1 Promotes Nuclear
Translocation of Annexin 1
To investigate the role of FPR on annexin 1 nuclear translocation, we performed a nuclear extraction with Western blot
and found that OGD/R increased the expression of FPR in the
nucleus (Fig. 3a). Previous data have indicated that annexin 1FPR binds at Arg205. We therefore constructed a plasmid of
FPR Arg205 containing a point mutation to Pro (R205P) and
transfected HEK293 cells with this plasmid in order to test the
function of FPR. Blot of the annexin 1 precipitates with the
FPR antibody revealed that point mutations of Arg205
decreased the binding of annexin 1 and FPR in nucleus
(Fig. 3b). Furthermore, transfection with R205P significantly reduced annexin 1 nuclear translocation
(Fig. 3c, d). We also applied the FPR antagonist,
BOC1, to primary cultured cortical neurons in order to
assess the consequences of blocking FPR and found that
FPR inhibition significantly reduced annexin 1 nuclear
translocation (Fig. 3e, f). These data suggest that in the
process of nuclear translocation, FPR might attract
annexin 1 to move toward the nucleus.

Downregulation of Annexin 1 Nuclear Translocation
by Blocking Myosin IIA Function Improved Cell Viability
and Enhanced Learning and Memory Ability After MCAO
In order to explore the effect of myosin IIA on annexin 1
nuclear translocation, we treated primary cultured neuron and
HEK293 cells with the myosin IIA antagonist, blebbistatin
(BLE). We found that treatment with BLE 1 h before OGD
resulted in a significant reduction of annexin 1 in the nucleus
when compared to treatment with OGD/R + DMSO
(Fig. 4a, b). We also observed similar results when we administered myosin IIA siRNA to neurons, with Western blots
revealing that annexin 1 nuclear translocation decreased and
that most annexin 1 was retained in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4c, d).
Tet-pretreated 293-TRPM7 cells and Tet-untreated 293TRPM7 cells were introduced to 1 h of OGD followed by
either reoxygenation for 24 h or no reoxygenation (normal).
BLE or DMSO was included in the media 1 h before OGD
and was replenished during reoxygenation. A Western blot
indicated that, in Tet-pretreated 293-TRPM7/WT and DMSOtreated cells, annexin 1 accumulated at the nucleus from
the cytoplasm after 24 h of reoxygenation. In contrast,
annexin 1 did not accumulate at the nucleus in BLEtreated 293-TRPM7/WT cells (Fig. 4e, f). Moreover,
BLE-treated cells failed to alter the subcellular localization of annexin 1 in 293-TRPM7/ΔKin cells after OGD/
R. The expression of annexin 1 rarely varies in the cytoplasm and nucleus in each group of 293-TRPM7/ΔKin cells
(Fig. 4g, h). These findings suggest that myosin IIA assists
annexin 1 nuclear translocation after OGD/R and that this
event is also TRPM7 kinase-dependent.

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 51:729–742

To investigate the role of myosin IIA in the process of brain
ischemia, we made an animal model of brain ischemia using
MCAO. We then treated animals with 50 μmol/l BLE (2 μl) in
the lateral ventricle 30 min before surgery. The Morris water
maze and passive avoidance and active avoidance tests (automated shuttle boxes) were then used to examine learning and
memory. In the Morris water maze, animals treated with
MCAO+BLE exhibited a significant improvement in latency

737

and total swim distance compared with the MCAO group
from days 1 to 3 (Fig. 5a, b). In the active avoidance test,
MCAO+BLE yielded positive results in the relative number
of shocks and number of active avoidances compared with the
MCAO group. Additionally, the passive avoidance test demonstrated similar results (Fig. 5c, e). These findings indicate
that treating with BLE significantly reversed rats’ cognitive
deficit that had been induced by MCAO (Fig. 5f). To evaluate

738

neuron viability, we collected neurons with annexin V-FITC
and PI double staining and analyzed using flow cytometry. We
also examined the viability of neurons and HEK293 cells with
the MTT test. Our results indicated that OGD/R induced
neuronal apoptosis but that blocking myosin IIA function
could significantly reduce the apoptotic consequences of
OGD/R (Fig. 5g–i). Together, these findings suggest that
functionally blocking myosin IIA with BLE can improve
learning and memory after MCAO and that myosin IIA might
be involved in ischemia-reperfusion-induced neuronal
apoptosis.
Importin β Translocates Annexin 1 into the Nucleus
by Recognizing a Myosin IIA Nuclear Localization Sequence
Domain
Bioinformatics have indicated that myosin IIA contains a
nuclear localization sequence (NLS) domain. With the purpose of investigating myosin IIA function, we constructed a
plasmid with full-length myosin IIA but without the NLS
domain. Transfected HEK293 with plasmid myo/ΔNLS
12 h before OGD/R resulted in reduced expression of annexin
1 in the nucleus when compared with the OGD/R+vector
group (Fig. 6a, b). Interestingly, the protein myosin IIA did
not translocate to the nucleus after OGD/R (Fig. 6c, d). We
used coimmunoprecipitation and found that myosin IIA physically associates with annexin 1 and that their binding is
enhanced by OGD/R in primary cultured neurons (Fig. 6e).
Importin β translocates hundreds of different proteins into the
nucleus. In order to identify the role of importin β on annexin
1 nuclear translocation, we used coimmunoprecipitation to
examine the binding between these two proteins. We found
that, in neurons, annexin 1 physically interacts with importin
β and that OGD/R increases their association. Furthermore,
treating with BLE reduced the number of annexin 1-importin
β complexes (Fig. 6f). Previous studies have suggested that
myosin IIA might bind with annexin 1 as a complex in the
cytoplasm during transportation; therefore, we examined the
interaction between myosin IIA and importin β and found that
OGD/R enhanced the binding of these two proteins (Fig. 6g).
We then used TRPM7/WT or TRPM7/ΔKin to precipitate
complexes with anti-HA antibodies and to detect the presence
of myosin IIA via Western blot. We found that myosin IIA was
absent in both TRPM7/WT and TRPM7/ΔKin complexes
(Fig. 6h).

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 51:729–742

while annexin 1 was not affected by SODN. The MTT assay
revealed that after 24 h of OGD/R, the viability of Tetpretreated 293-TRPM7/WT cells was significantly reduced
to 64.07±0.78 % in the absence of ASODN or SODN, compared to the normal condition. However, the viability of OGD/
R-treated cells was markedly increased to 83.04±0.91 % of
the normal condition in the presence of annexin 1 ASODN
(Fig. 7d). In contrast, application of annexin 1 SODN to OGD/
R-treated cells did not affect cell viability (65.01±1.33 % of
the normal condition, Fig. 7d). Next, we investigated the
potential role of annexin 1 in OGD/R-induced apoptosis and
found that application of annexin 1 ASODN to OGD/Rtreated 293-TRPM7/WT cells (Tet+) significantly reduced
the percentage of apoptotic cells by 19.6 ± 1.01 %
(Fig. 7a, c). However, the apoptotic rate of OGD/R-treated
Tet+cells was retained at a high level in the presence of
annexin 1 SODN (33.7±1.56 %, Fig. 7a, c), indicating that
annexin 1 is responsible for OGD/R-induced cell apoptosis
via TRPM7 kinase. We then examined the viability of neurons
in the presence of TRPM7 siRNA, and the viability of HEK
293 cells transfected with S5A/S5D by MTT. We found that
decreasing kinase function, mutating annexin 1 phosphorylation site, significantly improves cell viability after OGD/R
(Fig. 7e, f). In order to assess the function of annexin 1 in
the nucleus, especially its cross-linking with apoptotic genes,
we used ChIP to extract the annexin 1-DNA-binding complex,
then used Solexa Genome Analyzer to identify this complex;
these experiments were conducted with support from BGIShenzhen. Interestingly, we found that annexin 1 might associate with the BH3 interacting-domain death agonist, or BID
gene, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family that
is involved in Bax oligomerization in isolated mitochondrial
outer membranes. In order to confirm this finding, we then
extracted cDNA from neurons and HEK293 cells to examine
BID gene expression. Our polymerase chain reaction results
indicated that transfection with FPR R205P (which reduces
annexin 1 nuclear translocation) decreased the expression of
BID when comparing the OGD/R group with HEK293 cells.
Furthermore, downregulation of annexin 1 nuclear translocation with BLE reduced the expression of BID in neurons
compared with OGD/R (Fig. 7g–i). Therefore, annexin 1
nuclear translocation might be involved in neuronal apoptosis
via regulation of the expression of BID.

Annexin 1 Nuclear Translocation Regulates Cell Viability

Discussion

The suppression of annexin 1 by ASODN or sense
oligodeoxynucleotides (SODN) was assessed by Western
blot. As seen in Fig. 7b, the overexpression of annexin 1
induced by OGD/R in Tet-pretreated 293-TRPM7/WT cells
was significantly decreased by ASODN to normal levels,

In the present study, we elucidated the role of TRPM7 kinaseannexin 1 in OGD/R-induced neuron apoptosis. Specifically,
we found that following OGD/R, activation of the TRPM7
kinase leads to annexin 1 translocation from the cytoplasm to
the nucleus. Since FPR is an annexin 1 receptor, it serves to

expression of BID. Interestingly, we found that blocking
myosin IIA function with BLE could improve learning and
memory. Moreover, we found that BLE administration to an
animal model of MCAO could improve cell viability after
OGD/R.
In the first part of this study, we wanted to address how
annexin 1 is activated by TRPM7 kinase and what effect
TRPM7 kinase has on annexin 1 after OGD/R. We found that
a lack of TRPM7 kinase activity via inhibition of serine
phosphorylation decreased annexin 1 nuclear translocation;
moreover, phosphomimetic of the TRPM7 kinase could increase annexin 1 nuclear translocation. In other words, translocation of annexin 1 to the nucleus occurs in a kinase dependence manner. Furthermore, when primary cultured neurons
were transfected with TRPM7 siRNA, which partly decreases
kinase function, annexin 1 nuclear translocation was reduced,
and neuron survival rate after OGD/R was improved. This
suggests that TRPM7 kinase is involved in cellular apoptosis
via regulating annexin 1 nuclear translocation. Annexin 1
translocation can be reduced in several different ways, and
we have demonstrated a number of them in the current study.
For example, annexin 1 translocation to the nucleus can be
reduced by interrupting the binding of annexin 1 with FPR, by
blocking myosin IIA function with BLE, or via truncating
myosin IIA by omission of the NLS domain. Interestingly,
treating HEK293 cells with BLE decreased annexin 1 nuclear
translocation, but in the absence of the TPRM7 kinase, this
effect seemed to be abolished. These data suggest that as the
substrate of the TRPM7 kinase, activation of myosin IIA
seems to be dependent on kinase function.
As previously described, OGD/R induces annexin 1 nuclear translocation in a TRPM7 kinase-dependent manner.
Ryazanova and colleagues reported that Mg2+ can directly
modulate TRPM7 kinase activity in vitro [3]. Our previous
study indicated that anoxia induced an increase in Mg2+ via
the TRPM7 channel in rat hippocampal neurons. These data

741

suggest that Mg 2+ influx induced by OGD/R might
activate the TRPM7 kinase, and then upregulate annexin
1 phosphorylation rate.
Protein cytoplasmic nuclear trafficking is a complicated
process. The importin α/β heterodimer targets different proteins to the nuclear pore complex by recognizing the NLS
domain [21, 22]. Myosin IIA is located in both the cytoplasm
and nucleus; however, there is no evidence to suggest that
myosin IIA is recognized by importin α. Interestingly, bioinformatics have revealed that myosin IIA contains an NLS
domain. Furthermore, our current study has revealed that
myosin IIA combines with annexin 1 that is translocated by
importin β. Moreover, truncated myosin IIA without the NLS
domain results in a downregulation of annexin 1 nuclear
translocation. Therefore, the myosin IIA-annexin 1 complex
might be recognized by importin α and translocated by
importin β due to the myosin IIA NLS domain.
Several cargo proteins of myosin IIA translocate to the
nucleus and membrane following OGD/R; therefore, there
are multiple candidates responsible for inducing apoptosis.
A number of studies have demonstrated that intracellular
localization of annexin 1 can be redistributed following specific stimulation, for example, in response to glucocorticoids
[23], lipopolysaccharides [24], and hepatocyte growth factors
[25]. In contrast, PKC [26] and oxidative stress induce [27]
annexin 1 translocation to the nucleus. Recently, annexin 1
has been implicated in cell apoptosis. For example, annexin 1
expression is upregulated in DU145 cells in which apoptosis
had been induced via a mitochondrial pathway [13].
Additionally, it has been shown that annexin 1 in cancer cells
suppresses the transcriptional activity of the prosurvival molecule, NF-κB, which results in enhanced apoptosis [12]. In
this study, we found that activation of myosin IIA in response
to OGD/R results in the binding of myosin IIA with annexin 1
and that this association might assist annexin 1 translocation
to the nucleus. According to our current study, myosin IIA is
not directly activated by the TRPM7 kinase; however, this
observation is in contrast to those reported from several
former studies.
It has been reported that annexin 1 interacting with FPR
plays an anti-inflammatory role, and our previous study also
indicated the same phenomenon. However, in this study, we
reported that annexin 1 enhanced cell apoptosis. This discrepancy could be explained by a number of factors. First, OGD/R
is a complicated process, involving many different signaling
pathways, channels, and enzymes. In the current study,
TRPM7 kinase was activated by OGD/R, which then induced
Mg2+ influx. This influx could have caused more annexin 1 to
be phosphorylated by the α-kinase, which therefore could
have resulted in more nuclear translocation of annexin 1.
Second, the previous studies that reported anti-inflammatory
effects of annexin 1 were performed on immune cells, whereas
the current study was conducted on neurons and HEK293

742

cells. Neurons are terminally differentiated cells, and even
though they were stimulated by the same treatment, their
reaction to OGD/R might be different from that of immune
cells. Finally, our study focused on the nucleus. To the best of
our knowledge, there has been no evidence to date that has
demonstrated the function of annexin 1 in the nucleus.
Therefore, our study is the first to identify a role for annexin
1 in the neuronal nucleus.
Taken together, our findings have led us to propose the
above pathway, which is triggered after OGD/R, begins with
the activation of the TRPM7 kinase, and ends with annexin 1
nuclear translocation and the interaction of annexin 1 with
BID to modulate neuronal apoptosis. Importantly, where or
how annexin 1 binds to BID remains unresolved and should
be the subject of future studies.
