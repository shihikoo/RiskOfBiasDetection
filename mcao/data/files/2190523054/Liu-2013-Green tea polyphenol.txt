Abstract
Background: It has been supposed that green tea polyphenols (GTPs) have neuroprotective effects on brain damage
after brain ischemia in animal experiments. Little is known regarding GTPs’ protective effects against the blood-brain
barrier (BBB) disruption after ischemic stroke. We investigated the effects of GTPs on the expression of claudin-5,
occludin, and ZO-1, and the corresponding cellular mechanisms involved in the early stage of cerebral ischemia.
Methods: Male Wistar rats were subjected to a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 0, 30, 60, and 120 min.
GTPs (400 mg/kg/day) or vehicle was administered by intragastric gavage twice a day for 30 days prior to MCAO. At
different time points, the expression of claudin-5, occludin, ZO-1, and PKCα signaling pathway in microvessel fragments
of cerebral ischemic tissue were evaluated.
Results: GTPs reduced BBB permeability at 60 min and 120 min after ischemia as compared with the vehicle group.
Transmission electron microscopy also revealed that GTPs could reverse the opening of tight junction (TJ) barrier at
60 min and 120 min after MACO. The decreased mRNA and protein expression levels of claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1
in microvessel fragments of cerebral ischemic tissue were significantly prevented by treatment with GTPs at the same
time points after ischemia in rats. Furthermore, GTPs could attenuate the increase in the expression levels of PKCα
mRNA and protein caused by cerebral ischemia.
Conclusions: These results demonstrate that GTPs may act as a potential neuroprotective agent against BBB damage
at the early stage of focal cerebral ischemia through the regulation of TJ and PKCα signaling.

Background
Ischemic brain damage is an extremely complex multifactor, multi-level pathological process accompanied by
structural and functional changes of blood-brain barrier
(BBB) [1]. Many factors such as plasmin, gelatinases, free
radicals, inflammatory factor, vasoactive substances, neuroglia and so on are involved in the changes of BBB

permeability, resulting in a series of brain tissue damage
during cerebral ischemia. Therefore, BBB damage plays an
especially important role in the pathological changes of
ischemia [2,3]. Since cerebral ischemia and BBB damage
are closely correlated, approaches for protecting the BBB
integrity and reducing BBB permeability could help to elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanism in
brain ischemia, to guide treatment as well as to evaluate
drug’s efficacy. A large amount of drugs have been
screened to change the BBB permeability and to reduce
the ischemic brain damage by acting on different therapeutic targets. Green tea is one of the world’s most popular beverages. Green tea polyphenols (GTPs) are the most
important biologically active components of green tea,

among which (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the
main component and essential functional ingredient.
EGCG has been proved to be a natural antioxidant and
free radical scavenger [4]. Mounting evidence suggests
that GTPs may help reducing neuronal damages in
some neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s or
Alzheimer’s diseases. Moreover, animal data demonstrated
that EGCG improved focal ischemia/reperfusion-induced
brain injury including the infarction volume, neurological
deficit, etc by attenuating neuronal damage due to its potent anti-oxidant effects [5-7]. Our previous study observed the change of BBB permeability within 4 h after
brain ischemia, and preliminarily confirmed the protective
effects of GTPs on maintaining rat’s BBB integrity through
inhibiting increased eaveolin-1 expression at the early
stage of ischemia [8]. Thus, EGCG has a good prospect as
a neuroprotective agent against brain ischemia due to its
multi-targeted, multi-directional protective effects on the
neuronal injury and BBB leakage.
BBB permeability is closely related to structural and
functional alterations in the endothelial cells of cerebral
microvessels and tight junctions (TJs) between adjacent
cells. Caveolae-mediated internalization belongs to one of
the classical transcellular pathways. We have previously
demonstrated that the expression of caveolin-1, a marker
protein of caveolae, significantly increased after middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats, associated with
the increase in BBB permeability. And GTPs could decrease the mRNA and protein expression of caveolin-1,
thus in turn decreased the BBB permeability [8]. Increased
paracellular permeability following TJ barrier damage
directly contributes to the developments of cerebral
vasogenic edema, hemorrhagic transformation and increased mortality after ischemic stroke [9]. The TJ proteins claudin-5, occludin and ZO-1 contribute to the
integrity of the BBB, and changes in their composition
and expression are associated with increased vascular permeability [10,11]. We wondered whether GTPs could attenuate the BBB disruption by protecting the TJ barrier
after brain ischemia. It is very necessary to clarify the
neuroprotective effects of GTPs on cerebral ischemia,
which has been the major purpose of this work.
Studies suggest that protein kinase Cα (PKCα) activation has a prominent role in the neuronal injury after
brain ischemia. The occurrence of progressive ischemic
neurodegeneration was accompanied by sustained increases in PKCα activity [12]. Recently, it has been
reported that recombinant human angiopoietin1 could
prevent BBB damage by inhibiting the expression of PKCα
after focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in rats [13].
Moreover, PKCα serves as a regulator of brain endothelial
paracellular permeability by alternating TJ proteins and
F-actin filament reorganization [14]. GTPs have been
reported to inhibit testosterone production in rat Leydig

cells by inhibiting the PKA/PKC signaling pathways [15].
We aimed to observe the expression of PKCα in the ischemic brain tissue as early as 30 min after cerebral ischemia
and the effect of GTPs on PKCα activity.
In the current study, we focused primarily on whether
GTPs may reduce postischemic BBB damage by attenuating increased paracellular permeability in Wistar rats.
To provide a more comprehensive insight into the neuroprotective effects of GTPs on early brain ischemia, we
examined the changes in TJ morphology, the mRNA and
protein expression levels of claudin-5, occludin, ZO-1 and
PKCα in microvessel fragments of cerebral ischemic
tissue within 2 h of ischemia following the prophylactic
neuroprotective treatment of GTPs.

Methods
Animals and grouping

Adult male Wistar rats (250–300 g) were purchased from
the Center of Experimental Animals, China Medical University. All experiments were performed in accordance
with NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals and approved by the Ethical Committee of Animal Experiments of the China Medical University. The animals were housed in laboratory cages maintained on a
12-h light-dark cycle, with free access to food and water
throughout the study period. Mean arterial blood pressure
was monitored and rectal temperature was maintained at
37°C during the surgery. Animals were randomly assigned
to the control and GTPs groups. GTPs (400 mg/kg/day;
Hangzhou Gosun Biotechnologies Co. Ltd, Hangzhou,
China) were administered with intragastric gavage method
twice a day for 30 day before surgery. Vehicle (saline) was
given in the same way as mentioned above. Then experiments of each group were performed at four time points:
0, 30, 60 and 120 min after ischemia. After 30 d, all groups
were performed surgery of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The physiological parameters such as body
weight, blood pressure or cerebral blood flow were
maintained the same between the vehicle and GTPstreated groups.
Cerebral ischemia model

Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by MCAO at different time points in rats as described by Zea Longa [16].
Briefly, Rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate
(350 mg/kg, i.p.). After a median incision of the neck skin,
the left common, external, and internal carotid arteries
were isolated. A nylon filament (diameter 0.26 mm) was
inserted into the internal carotid artery via an incision
in the common carotid artery and advanced until the
rounded tip reached the origin to the left middle cerebral
artery. To confirm proper MCAO, a laser-Doppler probe
(Millwey, Axminste, UK) was fixed on the skull (1.5 mm
posterior to the bregma and 5 mm from the midline on

the left side) to measure local cortical blood flow in an
area supplied by the middle cerebral artery during the operation. The successful occlusion was determined by a
30% decrease to baseline in local cortical blood flow. In
the 0 min group, the rats underwent a similar surgical
procedure but the left arteries were not occluded. The behavioral testing was assessed according to Zea Longa’s
method. At different time points of ischemia, the rats were
scored blindly on a five-point scale: 0 = normal; 1 = drags
forepaw, twisting when lifted; 2 = circling spontaneously;
3 = falls; 4 = does not walk, comatose; 5 = dead [16]. The
rats that obtained a score of 4–5 were excluded from the
study.
Evaluation of BBB permeability

Evans blue staining was performed to determine if GTPs
treatment could alternate BBB permeability after a focal
cerebral ischemia [17,18]. Briefly, 2% EB in saline (2 mg/kg)
was injected intravenously 2 h before each expected time
point. At expected time points after ischemia, rats were
deeply anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate and transcardially perfused with heparinized saline until colorless
perfusion fluid was obtained from the right atrium. After
decapitation, the hemispheres were separated along the
sagittal suture. Both hemispheres were weighed and immersed into formamide (1 ml/100 mg) at 60°C for 24 h.
The content of dye extracted from each brain was determined with a spectrophotometer (at 620 nm). The quantitative calculation of the dye content in the brain was
based on the external standards dissolved in the same
solvent.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

The postischemic Ultrastructural changes of TJ following
prophylactic treatment with GTPs were examined using
TEM. At expected time points after ischemia, the deeply
anesthetized rats were perfused transcardially with 2.5%
glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde. The ischemic
brain tissues were divided into some pieces of 1 mm3,
fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4°C. According to the
standard procedures, semi-thin and ultra-thin sections
were prepared and stained with uranyl acetate and
lead citrate, and then samples were observed by TEM
(JEM-1200EX, Japan).
Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

Cerebral microvessels were isolated from rat cortical
gray matter for the analysis of TJs gene [19,20]. Isolated
microvessels were routinely examined to confirm enrichment of microvessels. RT-PCR was used to investigate
the mRNA expression of claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1.
Total RNA was isolated from the brain microvessel fragments of ischemic tissue using Trizol (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer’s

Page 3 of 10

protocol. cDNA was generated from 1.0 μg of the total
RNA from each sample with a reverse transcription kit by
avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The applied PCR primers were as follows: claudin-5: (forward:
5′-CGGGCGTCCAGAGTTCA-3′, reverse: 5′- TTCAGC
GGTGGTCGTCA-3′, 185 bp); occludin: (forward: 5′- TC
GCTTCCTTGGTGA-3′, reverse: 5′-CAGAGGCGGTG
ACTTAT-3′, 593 bp); ZO-1: (forward: 5′- CTCGGGCAT
TATTCG -3′, reverse: 5′- CTCCAGGTTGACATTAGT
T -3′, 817 bp); PKCα (forward: 5′ -GTGCCAAGTTT
GCTGTT- 3′, reverse: 5′-CGCAGGTGTCGCATT-3′
209 bp); ß-Actin: (forward: 5′-CATCTCTTGCTCG
AAGTCCA-3′, reverse: 5′-CGCAGGTGTCGCATT-3′,
318 bp). PCR amplification was carried out for 30 cycles.
β-Actin served as an internal control. PCR products were
separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose/TBE gels.
Gels were photographed using the Chemi Imager 5500 gel
image analysis instrument (AlPha InnCh). The integrated
density value (IDV) of PCR product bands was calculated
by computerized image analysis (Fluor Chen 2.0) and normalized with that of β-Actin.
Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemical staining was used to determine the
distribution and expression of claudin-5, occludin and
ZO-1 in postischemic brain microvessels after pretreatment with GTPs. Rat brains were post fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 24 h, and then immersed in 30% sucrose solution in phosphate-buffered saline for 24 h in
both GTPs and control groups. Coronal sections at the
level of the anterior commissure in the ischemic region
were cut into 10-μm-thick pieces. The sections were
incubated with anti-claudin-5 antibody (diluted 1:150;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-occludin antibody (diluted 1:150; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-ZO-1 antibody (diluted 1:150, Zymed) at 4°C overnight, and then
the remaining procedures conformed to the standard procedures. For semi-quantitative measurements of claudin-5,
occludin and ZO-1 density, the sections were photographed and analyzed using a computer-assisted image
analyzing system (MoticImages Advanced 3.2).
Western blot assessment

Western blot was used to detect the protein expression
of TJ associated proteins, PKCα in the ischemic cortex.
Cerebral microvessel segments were obtained from rat
cortical gray matter in the ischemic region as previously
described [19,20]. Equal amounts of proteins were separated by 7.5% to 10% sodium dodecyl sulphatepolyacrylamide gels, electrophoretically transferred to
nitrocellulose, and then stained overnight at 4°C respectively with anti-claudin-5 antibody (diluted 1:400; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), anti-occludin antibody (diluted
1:400; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ZO-1 antibody

Liu et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2013, 13:187

(diluted 1:400; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PKCα
(diluted 1:400, Bioworld Technology, Inc.). After the
protein was incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:3000; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature, enhanced chemiluminescence analysis (ECL kit, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) was performed to determine the
immunoreactive bands. The protein bands were scanned
with Chemi Imager 5500 V2.03 software, and the IDV
were calculated using a computerized image analysis
system (Fluor Chen 2.0) and normalized with that of
β-Actin.
Determination of PKCα activity

Cytosolic and membrane fractions of ischemic tissue
were separated according to the procedure to evaluate
the translocation of PKC [21]. And then, PKC activity of
cytosolic and membrane fraction was measured. The
following PKC assay was performed according to the
manufacturer’s suggestions: colorimetric PKC assay
(PepTag; Promega, Madison, WI) and specific PKCα
assay (PKCα KinEASETM FP fluorescein green assay,
Upstate) [14]. The PKC translocation was calculated for
each group by the corresponding membrane-to-cytosol
ratio.
Statistical analysis

All data are presented as the means ± SD. Differences
among multiple groups were statistically analyzed using
one-way ANOVA. Two sample T-tests with Bonferroni’s
correction were applied to test differences between
groups. Statistical significance was assumed if P value was
less than 0.05.

Results
GTPs attenuated BBB disruption after focal ischemia

The effects of GTPs on BBB permeability within 120 min
after ischemia were evaluated with Evans blue staining. Increased Evans blue signal was detected in the ischemic
hemispheres at 60 and 120 min after ischemia, whereas
no staining could be observed in the 0 and 30 min ischemic groups. As shown in Figure 1, the content of Evans
blue increased significantly at 60 and 120 min after ischemia in the saline-treated group as compared with the
0 min group (P < 0.01). There was no significant change in
the Evans blue content of the ischemia between 30 min
and 0 min group (P > 0.05). In the GTPs-treated groups,
the exudation of Evans blue decreased significantly compared with the vehicle group at the time points of 60 min
and 120 min after ischemia (P < 0.01). Evans blue staining
results indicated that the increased BBB permeability
could be attenuated by GTPs pre-treatment at the early
stage of brain ischemia.

GTPs altered the postischemic changes in TJ morphology

The results of TEM have qualitatively shown the changes
in the integrity of the TJ barrier after GTPs treatment. In
the vehicle and GTPs groups at 0 and 30 min, TJ lay in
the plasma membrane of adjacent brain microvascular
endothelial cells (BMECs) and sealed the intercellular
cleft, appearing as a series of electron-dense zones
(Figure 2A1, A2, B1, B2), whereas intercellular cleft was
clearly recognized between adjacent endothelial cells in
the vehicle groups at 60 and 120 min after ischemia
(Figure 2A3, A4). In GTPs-treated groups, the reverse of
TJ opening after ischemia was observed at 60 and
120 min after ischemia (Figure 2B3, B4), indicating that
GTPs might repair the postischemic TJ integrity.
GTPs changed the mRNA and protein expression of
claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 following cerebral ischemia

To investigate the effects of GTPs on BBB disruption after
brain ischemia, RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and
western blot were undertaken to determine the mRNA
and protein expression of claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1.
As shown in Figure 3(A-D), RT-PCR results showed that
the mRNA expression levels of claudin-5, occludin, and
ZO-1 significantly decreased in cerebral microvessels in
vehicle groups at 60 and 120 min after ischemia compared
with that of 0 min group (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the expression of claudin-5, occludin,
and ZO-1 between the vehicle groups at 0 min and
30 min, respectively (P > 0.05). The mRNA expression of
claudin-5, occludin and ZO-1 was significantly promoted
in the GTPs-treated groups at 60 and 120 min after ischemia compared with the vehicle groups at the same time
points, respectively (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the mRNA expression of claudin-5,
occludin, and ZO-1 between the vehicle groups and the
GTPs-treated groups at 0 and 30 min after ischemia, respectively (P > 0.05).
The immunohistochemistry results revealed that the
staining of claudin-5, occludin and ZO-1 was continuously, sharply, perfectly located in the cerebral microvessels of vehicle groups at 0 and 30 min. Loss of
continuity in the distribution and attenuated expression of
these three TJ associated proteins were observed in the vehicle groups at 60 and 120 min after ischemia. Moreover,
the mean optical density values of claudin-5, occludin and
ZO-1 were significantly decreased in the vehicle groups at
60 and 120 min after ischemia compared with those of the
vehicle group at 0 min (P < 0.01). Claudin-5, occludin, and
ZO-1 still presented a perfect localization and normal expression in the cerebral vascular structures in the GTPstreated groups at 0 and 30 min after ischemia. The mean
optical density values of claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 in
the GTPs-treated groups at 60 and 120 min were significantly increased compared with those at the same time

points, respectively (P < 0.01), indicating that GTP pretreatment could protect the integrity of the BBB TJ barrier
(Figure 4).
Western blot was performed to further investigate the
protective effects of GTPs on the TJ barrier at the early
stage of cerebral ischemia. In concordance with our RTPCR and immunohistochemical staining results, the western blot results also verified that the expression of
claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 proteins were significantly
attenuated at 60 min and 120 min after ischemia compared with those at 0 min in the vehicle groups, respectively (P < 0.01). Accordingly, the expression of claudin-5,
occludin, and ZO-1 proteins were significantly recovered
at 60 and 120 min in the GTP-treated groups compared
with those in the vehicle group at the same time points,
respectively (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Therefore, the expression

Page 5 of 10

of TJ associated proteins was promoted by GTPs pretreatment, which indicated the protective effects of GTPs
against the ischemic BBB leakage (Figure 5A-D).
GTPs reduced the increased activity and expression of
PKCα after Cerebral Ischemia

It has been reported that PKCα expression was significantly elevated after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion [13].
We further investigated the changes of PKCα expression
and the effects of GTPs on PKCα pathway at the early
stage of brain ischemia. As shown in Figure 3A, E, PK
Cα mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated at
60 min and 120 min after ischemia as compared with
0 min in the vehicle groups (P < 0.01). The mRNA
expression levels of PKCα were significantly decreased at
60 and 120 min after ischemia in the GTPs-treated

same time points, respectively (P < 0.01). The western
blot and specific PKCα translocation assay data showed
a similar tendency with the RT-PCR results. Membraneto-cytosol ratio of PKCα activity and protein expression

were also significantly attenuated by GTPs at the same
time points after ischemia (Figure 5A, E; Figure 6, P <
0.01). These results revealed that GTP administration
could attenuate the increased activity and expression of
PKCα at the early stage of cerebral ischemia.

Discussion
The present study demonstrated that the prophylactic
neuroprotective treatment with GTPs modulated the
postischemic changes of TJ barrier and PKCα signaling in
rat models of MCAO. GTPs significantly reduced the BBB
permeability after cerebral ischemia within 120 min. The
mRNA and protein expression of TJ-associated proteins
claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 were significantly decreased
at the early stage of ischemia. Accordingly, the opening of
the TJ barrier was observed by ETM. Whereas, GTPs significantly prevented the reduction of claudin-5, occludin,

and ZO-1 expression at the time points of 60 and 120 min
after ischemia. The PKCα expression was also found to be
increased significantly and could be blocked by GTPs pretreatment at 60 and 120 min after ischemia. These results
demonstrated that increased paracellular permeability was
also involved in the BBB disruption during the early stage
of cerebral ischemia, and GTPs might protect BBB TJ
integrity by enhancing the expressions of claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 and inhibiting PKCα expression.
Ischemic cerebrovascular disease has been paid more
attention to by neurologists because of its high disability

and death rate as well as refractory neuron damage. The
aims of neuroprotective treatment for ischemic stroke
are to prevent the harmful physiopathologic changes, to
further reduce neuron damage, to improve survival rate
and status and to decrease the rate of disability [22]. The
concept of neurovascular unit emphasizes that the overall
protection of the brain after ischemic stroke also includes
vessels and glial cells apart from the neuron damage [23].
Recently, plant polyphenols have shown some promising
effects as potent free radical scavengers in treating stroke.
It has been reported that EGCG reduced the infarction
volume, the neurological deficit total score, the level of
malondialdehyde and the ratio of oxidized/total glutathione in rat transient focal ischemia models with 24-h reperfusion following 2-h occlusion of the middle cerebral
artery [7]. Moreover, EGCG was also reported to protect
against neuronal damage and brain edema after unilateral
cerebral ischemia in gerbils [24]. During the early stage of
cerebral ischemia, it was thought that the BBB disruption
and glial cells damage played a more important role than
neuron damage in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia.
We have preliminary found that GTPs could protect BBB
damage from 1 h after ischemia [8]. Since GTPs may protect against ischemic brain injury concurrently through
the different mechanism, we further investigated the potential protective mechanism of GTPs on BBB damage in
rat models of early focal cerebral ischemia.
The structural and functional changes and damage of
BBB after cerebral ischemia could be the initiating factors
for a series of irreversible neurodegenerative disorders
[25]. Generally, increased vascular permeability determined by EB extravasation was observed within 1-2 h after
cerebral ischemia, and remained until 24 h in the process
of ischemia [26]. There have been reports demonstrating

that early BBB permeability was increased from 30 min
after MCAO [27]. Whereas, barrier damage determined
by HRP permeability appeared immediately at the 2nd
min after complete cerebral ischemia induced by cardiac
arrest in the rat [28]. In this study, BBB opening appeared
at 60 min following cerebral ischemia induced by MCAO,
and GTPs might significantly attenuate this early BBB disturbance. The results were consistent with our previous
report [8], reinforcing the notion that GTPs administration has a protective effect on early BBB permeability alterations after ischemic insult.
BBB disturbances during cerebral ischemia are associated with the multifactorial impairment such as TJ opening between BMECs, increased expression of AQP4 and
matrix metallo proteinases (MMPs), free radical generation and so on [29,30]. Disruption of TJ barrier integrity
and subsequent increase of paracellular permeability are
major contributors to the pathogenesis of BBB damage in
ischemic stroke [30]. Our TEM results showed an increase in the gap at TJ from 60 min following MCAO, indicating that TJ barrier alterations participated in early
BBB changes after cerebral ischemia in rats. Claudin-5,
occludin, and ZO-1 are the major structural proteins of
the TJs, and the changes of their expression are closely
related to the paracellular permeability of BBB and brain
edema [11,31]. Previously, we confirmed that the expression levels of these TJ associated proteins were significantly decreased compared with the sham-operated
group within 120 h of reperfusion in a time-dependent
manner [32]. In this study, we focused on their expression during the early ischemia within 120 min. The RTPCR, immunohistochemical staining and western blot
results demonstrated that the expression of claudin-5,
occludin, and ZO-1 has already decreased from 60 min
after ischemia, which further verified the specific roles
of these three TJ proteins in a focal cerebral ischemic
insult.
As a natural beverage, the medical and health benefits
of green tea are paid more and more attention to. GTPs,
as a potent free radical scavenger and antioxidant, were
reported to be used in the prevention and treatment of
chronic diseases such as heart disease, various types of
cancer and neurodegenerative diseases [33]. Previously,
we first reported that a prophylactic treatment with GTPs
for 30 d before MCAO could decrease the elevated
transcelluar BBB permeability during the early brain ischemia by reducing the expression of caveolin-1 [8]. In this
study, we investigated deeply the mechanism relating the
protective effects of GTPs aganist early ischemic BBB
damage. The results showed that the postischemic decreased expression of claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 was
significantly ameliorated by GTPs pre-treatment. Collectively, preventive medication of GTPs could exhibit significant neuroprotection against early cerebral ischemia

by elevating both transcelluar and paracelluar BBB
permeability.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that PKCα might
play an important role in the regulation of BBB permeability during the cerebral ischemia [14]. Our previous data
demonstrated that PKCα expression in the ischemic brain
microvessels was significantly increased at 12 h, 48 h and
7d after focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in rats, and
the up-regulated expression of PKCα might be closely associated with the down-regulated expression of occludin
and ZO-1 caused by ischemia/reperfusion injury [13].
Subsequent studies have demonstrated that the activity
and expression levels of PKCα were up-regulated at
60 min and 120 min after ischemia. The time course was
consistent with that of TJs changes, which heightened the
speculation that the expression changes of PKCα were related to TJ alterations during brain ischemia. There are reports indicated that GTPs could inhibit PKCα signaling in
several types of cells [15,34]. We have also characterized
the effect of GTPs on the postischemic changes of PKCα.
The up-regulation of membrane-to-cytosol ratio of PKCα
activity and expression was alleviated by GTPs pretreatment, suggesting that PKCα was possibly involved in
the process of GTPs protection against early cerebral
ischemia.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have reported for the first time that pretreatment with GTPs alleviated MCAO-induced BBB
damage by protecting the TJ barrier intact and inhibiting
PKCα signaling in rats. The results have given another
insight into the thinking that GTPs could be chosen as a
potential multi-targeted neuroprotective agent in the
treatment of early cerebral ischemia.
