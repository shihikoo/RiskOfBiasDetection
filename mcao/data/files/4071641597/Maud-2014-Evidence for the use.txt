Since an ethical issue has been raised regarding the use of the well-known anesthetic agent chloral hydrate, owing to its mutagenic
and carcinogenic effects in animals, attention of neuroscientists has turned to finding out an alternative agent able to meet not
only potency, safety, and analgesic efficacy, but also reduced neuroprotective effect for stroke research. The aim of this study was to
compare the potential of chloral hydrate and isoflurane for both modulating the action of the experimental neuroprotectant MK801
and exerting analgesia. After middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats, no difference was observed in 24 h survival rate, success
of ischemia, or infarct volume reduction between both anesthetics. However, isoflurane exerted a more pronounced analgesic
effect than chloral hydrate as evidenced by formalin test 3 hours after anesthesia onset, thus encouraging the use of isoflurane
in experimental stroke models.

1. Introduction
A cerebrovascular accident is defined by a sudden neurological deficit of vascular origin, as the damage of brain
parenchyma arises from infarction (ischemic stroke) or
bleeding (hemorrhagic stroke). Stroke is the third cause of
death and the leading cause of acquired adult disability in
the world, with still no neuroprotectant and few therapeutic
options. This situation challenges the current knowledge of
stroke pathophysiological events as well as the relevance of
experimental models. This led researchers to develop several
ischemic stroke models in a variety of species. To simulate
human ischemic stroke, with 80% of which being thrombotic
or embolic occurring in the territory of the middle cerebral
artery (MCA), the intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model has been set up and has been proved
to be valuable in the field. This model requires a particularly
efficient anesthesia of animals to induce stroke surgically.
Indeed, it has both to last enough time for the microsurgery

of the brain to be successful and to allow the awakening
to be rapid. Moreover, in addition to safety, anesthesia of
experimental stroke models has to be free of neuroprotective
effect in order to avoid bias in the neuroprotection studies. Finally, for ethical reasons, the ideal anesthetic should
provide postoperative analgesia since analgesics cannot be
used in stroke model because of their potent neuroprotective
action [1, 2].
To date, experimental anesthesia is based on an intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate since this method was
confirmed as safe and realistic [3], with minimal effects on
cardiovascular function or reflexes, as well as absence of synergistic neuroprotection in stroke studies [4]. However, when
surgical anesthesia doses are administered, the safety margin is significantly reduced and recovery is prolonged [5].
Chloral hydrate metabolism has received increased attention
in recent years as a metabolite of trichloroethylene, a metaldegreasing solvent found to be carcinogen in rodents [6, 7].
Moreover, hepatocarcinogenicity has been associated with

2
the cardiopathic effect of high dose of chloral hydrate [8].
For these reasons, the French Agency for Safety of Health
Products (AFSSAPS) has questioned the benefit/risk ratio of
this compound in 2000, leading to possible withdraw from
the market [9].
Isoflurane is a volatile halogenated gas that is currently
used in stroke studies but also reported to exert neuroprotection [10, 11], the mechanisms of which are however poorly
understood. Among numerous mechanisms, isoflurane may
antagonize the NR1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) glutamate receptor, thus preventing its input on
synaptic transmission [12, 13]. However, this anesthetic agent
has very interesting advantages such as ease of use, titration,
and rapid awakening which deserves interest in MCAO
model.
To assess the ability of isoflurane and chloral hydrate to
interfere with pharmacologically induced neuroprotection,
we used MK801, a well-described NMDA receptor antagonist, used as a reference compound for experimental neuroprotection in rodents [14‚Äì16]. Since animal pain is centrally
considered in the ethical issues of experimental studies, and
therefore in the requirements for anesthetics, a pain assessment was included in the study in order to check for the postoperative analgesic potential of both compared anesthetics.

2. Experimental Procedure
2.1. Animals and Drugs Administration. All experiments
were performed in accordance with the European Community Legislation (2010/63/UE). The Local Ethics Committee
approved the experiments. All rats in this study were adult
male Wistar (Janvier SAS, Le Genest-St-Isle, France) weighing 280‚Äì330 g according to MCAO model. Animals were
housed under controlled laboratory conditions, with a 12hour dark cycle, a temperature of 21 ¬± 2‚àò C, and a humidity
of 60 to 70%. The animals had ad libitum access to standard
chow and tap water.
Two experimental protocols were conducted during this
study. The first protocol aimed at studying the modulation of
infarct volumes by both anesthetics (with or without MK801).
The second protocol has examined the analgesic potential of
these anesthetics through a pain test, the formalin test. This
test was performed on either healthy animals or ischemic
animals.
Two modes of anesthesia were tested (see Table 1). MK801
(SIGMA, M107; 0.5 mg/kg in saline) was injected intravenously 3 minutes before MCAO.
One hundred and five animals were included in the study
and were randomly assigned to the different groups. Ninety
animals have experienced cerebral ischemia (I/R groups):
chloral (CHLO), ùëõ = 20; chloral with MK801 treatment
(CHLO + MK), ùëõ = 25; isoflurane (ISO), ùëõ = 20; isoflurane
with MK801 treatment (ISO + MK), ùëõ = 25. Ten animals
were included in the SHAM group (operated animals without
MCAO), ùëõ = 5 per group (CHLO and ISO). Five animals
were included in the Healthy group for formalin test. Healthy
animals underwent no anesthesia and no surgery and were
considered as controls (Figure 1).

BioMed Research International
Animals that died at the end of the protocol or survived
but without successful ischemia (i.e., without lesion or with
only subcortical lesion) were excluded from the study.
2.2. The MCA Occlusion Model. After anesthesia, a rectal
probe was inserted and body temperature was maintained at
37 ¬± 0.5‚àò C with a heating lamp.
The ostium of the right MCA was occluded intraluminally, as previously described [17]. The right carotid arteries
were exposed through a midline cervical incision and the
common carotid and external carotid arteries were ligated
with a silk suture. The pterygopalatine artery was exposed (by
developing a plane alongside the internal carotid artery) and
then ligated at its origin with a fine silk. An aneurysm clip
was placed across internal carotid artery and an arteriotomy
was made in the common carotid artery stump, allowing the
introduction of a 4/0 monofilament nylon suture with its tip
rounded by flame heating. Once the suture was in place, the
aneurysm clip on the internal carotid artery was removed.
The suture was gently advanced into the internal carotid
artery and passed into the intracranial circulatory system to
lodge in the narrower lumen of the origin of the MCA. Mild
resistance to this advancement indicated that the intraluminal occluder had entered the anterior cerebral artery. After 60
minutes, the suture was carefully removed, until its tip was
blocked by a ligature placed on common carotid artery (to
allow reperfusion). The animals were placed in a cage to
recover from anesthesia at room temperature and were then
allowed to eat and drink ad libitum. The sham operation
consisted of the same manipulation but without introduction
of the monofilament.
2.3. Formalin Test (Pain Test). The formalin test was carried
out in a 30 √ó 30 √ó 30 cm clear plastic chamber. Behavior
was rated for 1 hour from a score calculated for each minute
period. 5 rats of each group were tested. Formalin (50 ùúáL) was
injected subcutaneously into the plantar surface of the right
hind paw while the rat was restrained manually. Behaviors
were observed 3 h after the MCAO in order to be sure that
animals were awaked and for 1 h. The scored behaviors were
those originally described by Dubuisson and Dennis [18]:
0 = normal weight bearing the injected paw; 1 = lameness
during locomotion or resting the paw lightly on the floor; 2 =
elevation of the injected paw so that at most the nails touch
the floor; 3 = licking or biting of the injected paw. For clarity of
the results, we grouped the scores every 5 minutes for 1 hour.
2.4. Infarct Volume Measurement. 24 hours after reperfusion, rats were killed with an overdose of pentobarbital
(200 mg/kg, ip). Brains were rapidly removed and placed in
ice-cold isopentane solution, frozen, and coronally dissected
into 50 ùúám thick slices on a cryostat at 12 levels in 1 mm steps,
according to the Paxinos and Watson stereotaxic atlas. Sections were stained with cresyl fast violet. The unstained area
of the brain was defined as the infarct zone. Infarcted cortical
and subcortical areas and hemispheric areas were calculated
separately for each coronal slice using image analysis software
(ImageJ) after digitization.

isoflurane anesthesia (4% induction, 2% maintenance); CHLO: chloral hydrate anesthesia (300 mg/kg ip). MK801 group corresponded to
animals who received MK801 IV injection (0.5 mg/kg) 3 minutes before MCAO.

Next, infarct volumes (total, cortical, and subcortical)
and hemispheric volumes (in mm3 ) were calculated by the
summing the respective areas for all sections for all animals
and the distance between them. Lastly, the infarct volumes
were corrected for the brain edema effect using the following
equation: corrected infarct volume = total infarct volume ‚àí
(left hemisphere volume/right hemisphere volume) [17].
2.5. Statistical Analysis. All values were expressed as mean ¬±
standard error of the mean (SEM). Continuous variables were
compared with a one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc
Tukey‚Äôs Multiple Comparison Test if variance analysis was
significant or with a t-test analysis. A value of ùëÉ < 0.05
indicated statistical significance.

3. Results
3.1. Effect on 24-Hour Survival and Ischemic Event Rates. Survival of ischemic animals depended on both the type of anesthesia and MK801 treatment. Thus, the death rate reached 31%
in animals that were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (14/45)
and 33% in anesthetized animals using isoflurane (15/45). The
total ischemia rate was similar in the two groups (Figure 2).
3.2. Effects on Infarct Volume. One-hour MCAO was followed by 23 h of reperfusion in rats according to the 2 different modes of anesthesia. The resulting infarct volumes

were not different between groups, in term of total infarct
volume (ùëÉ = 0.98), cortical infarct volume (ùëÉ = 0.75),
or subcortical infarct volume (ùëÉ = 0.41) (total: CHLO,
268.65¬±13.93 mm3 , ISO, 268.29¬±14.24 mm3 ; cortical: CHLO,
200.13 ¬± 14.58 mm3 , ISO, 209.51 ¬± 13.76 mm3 ; subcortical:
CHLO, 62.27 ¬± 3.28 mm3 , ISO, 68.51 ¬± 3.11 mm3 ) (Figure 3).
3.3. Compared Abilities to Modulate MK801-Induced Neuroprotection. First of all, we evaluated the neuroprotective
effect of MK801 at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg IV 3 minutes before
MCAO in animals anesthetized with chloral hydrate. The
resulting infarct volumes obtained from animals treated with
MK801 (CHLO + MK) decreased significantly in comparison
with vehicle treated animals (CHLO) (CHLO: 268.65 ¬±
13.93 mm3 , versus CHLO + MK: 194.10 ¬± 13.76 mm3 ; ùëÉ <
0.05). Independently, MK801 induced neuroprotection in
animals group anesthetized with isoflurane (ISO + MK).
A significant decrease in infarct volume was found (ISO:
268.29 ¬± 14.24 mm3 , versus ISO + MK: 174.98 ¬± 17.01 mm3 ;
ùëÉ < 0.05) (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). To test whether isoflurane
modulates MK801-induced neuroprotection, we compared
neuroprotection observed in both anesthetics. No difference
was observed between ISO + MK and CHLO + MK group
(ùëÉ > 0.05).
3.4. Compared Analgesic Abilities after MCAO. To assess
the analgesic effect of both anesthetic agents, we used the

formalin test on animals and scored their reaction every
minute for 1 hour and pooled the scores every 5 minutes.
Healthy animals (HEALTHY) underwent no anesthesia and
no surgery and were considered as controls for the experiment. This test was carried out 3 h after induction of anesthesia, to allow for time for all the animals to wake up
and to be operational for testing. As a first step, we studied
the pain felt after formalin injection for 1 hour in sham
animals anesthetized with either chloral hydrate or isoflurane
(Figure 5(a)). A significant difference was observed between
isoflurane group and healthy animals at 15 min after formalin
injection (ùëÉ = 0.02). No significant difference was observed
between isoflurane and chloral groups. In a second step,
we performed the formalin test on ischemic animals (I/R)

anesthetized either with chloral hydrate or isoflurane. In
the same way, this test was realized 3 h after induction of
anesthesia. A significant difference was observed at 35 min
(ùëÉ = 0.03) and at 50 min (ùëÉ = 0.005) after formalin injection
between isoflurane group and healthy animals (Figure 5(b)).
However, no significant difference was observed between
isoflurane and chloral groups.

4. Discussion
In this study, we wanted to study the effect of different
anesthetic agents on the extent of ischemic injury. There are
different classes of anesthetics used in animal testing. Among
them, we can find not only injectable anesthetics, such as

of anesthesia; ùëõ = 5 animals per group. In the SHAM group (Figure 5(a)), a significant difference was observed between isoflurane treated
and healthy animals at 15 min of the formalin injection according to one-way ANOVA test (ùëÉ = 0.02). At the other time points, no significant
difference was observed between the different groups according to one-way ANOVA test. In the group I/R (Figure 5(b)), a significant difference

barbiturates, cholinergic or morphine mimetics, but also
volatile anesthetics, such as nitric oxide or halogenated gas.
In the literature, pentobarbital is a widely used barbiturate,
but its use is delicate because it may result in a deep sleep and
respiratory distress [19, 20]. The mixture ketamine-xylazine
is also commonly used in MCAO studies, but it is often
reported to have an inconsistent anesthetic effect, with an
extended and fluctuating induction time [21]. We therefore
performed MCAO in animals asleep with either chloral
hydrate or isoflurane. No significant difference was observed
in terms of infarct volume and mortality in different groups.
In addition, we wanted to investigate the modulation of
the neuroprotection induced by MK801, an antagonist of
NMDA receptor, extensively studied in stroke animal models
[14‚Äì16]. Whatever the anesthetic agent used here was, the
infarct volume was reduced when animals were treated
with MK801. As isoflurane exerts neuroprotection through
additional targets other than NMDA receptor, including twopore-domain potassium channels, and NO-mediated cerebral artery vasodilation, we expected a potentiation of neuroprotection when coadministered with MK801 [22‚Äì27]. The
surprising absence of synergistic neuroprotection in the
isoflurane treated animals, compared to chloral hydrate
treated animals, suggests that our single dose of isoflurane
can be used without interfering with early mechanisms of
stroke pathophysiology such as excitotoxicity. This hypothesis
is supported by the work of Sarraf-Yazdi et al. [28], who
observed the same results despite the use of lower doses of
isoflurane and a higher dose of MK801 on the same MCAO
model in rats. This interesting property appears with much
shorter anesthesia duration, and the gas nature of isoflurane enables much easier monitoring of the anesthetic process compared to injections [29].
The second part of our study aimed at evaluating the pain
felt by the animal, since it is considered as an ethical problem
in experimental research [30]. The formalin test is a model
of somatic pain which can be achieved in animals [31, 32]. In
each experiment, we obtain a biphasic response: at the early
stage (possibly related to noninflammatory processes) and
the late stage (surely inflammatory) [33]. This dual response
occurs through the activation of different mechanisms of pain
[31], the early phase one involving the stimulation of nociceptors [18] and the late phase one resulting from peripheral
inflammatory processes mediated by histamine, serotonin,
or prostaglandins [34]. Besides, changes in information
processing take place at the spinal level during the late phase,
after the afferent stimulation previously elicited in the early
phase. In 1993, Field and colleagues described chloral hydrate
ability to promote a sufficient anesthesia and analgesia depth
for surgical procedures [35], whereas the analgesic effect
of isoflurane was poorly investigated. Here, the variability
found from one animal to another in the pain felt after
ischemic stroke onset, appearing less intense in ischemic than
in healthy animals, suggests an impact of stroke-induced
damage on brain cortical and subcortical structures involved
in pain feeling. Brain infarcts may modify the perception of
pain since ischemic animals were less algesic than healthy
animals. Although the formalin test was carried out in
the nonhemiplegic limb, some adaptive or countervailing

BioMed Research International
mechanisms may modify pain signal, as put forward by
the Canadian Council on Animal Care [36]. However, the
differences between both anesthetics used in this pain study
were of low magnitude. Isoflurane seemed to have a slight
analgesic effect, especially at the end of the first pain phase for
both sham-operated and ischemic animal groups and also at
the end of the second phase in the ischemic animal groups. In
the literature, isoflurane affects synaptic transmission of pain
and may contribute to analgesia, up to a loss of consciousness
by diminishing the strength of arousing stimuli. This effect
might be involved in pain prevention during anesthesia [37].
The pain felt by sham-operated animals was thus investigated
in order to check whether isoflurane could keep its analgesic
effect in control condition. Pain intensity was found similar
in sham-operated animals to that felt by healthy animals,
except for 15 minutes after the beginning of the test, where
animals under isoflurane were less sensitive than the ones of
the other groups. As this time point corresponds to the very
end of the first phase (noninflammatory phase) and thus to
the beginning of the next (inflammatory) phase, our results
suggest that isoflurane may either stimulate nociceptors or act
on the peripheral inflammatory processes, as reported by Liu
and colleagues at the spinal level [38].
To conclude, isoflurane seems to be a good candidate
for chloral hydrate replacement and use in the rat MCAO
model, with additional advantages: (i) it is easy to administer
and to titrate, (ii) it has a rapid onset and recovery, (iii) it
produces adequate and reproducible anesthesia depth, and
(iv) it causes minimal cardiac depression. Furthermore, this
anesthetic agent displays a slight analgesic effect, fulfilling
an important ethical criterion for animal experimentation as
referred to in the guidelines of ethics committees.
