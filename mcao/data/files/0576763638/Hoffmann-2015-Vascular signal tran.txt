Background—Poststroke angiogenesis contributes to long-term recovery after stroke. Signal transducer and activator of
transcription-3 (Stat3) is a key regulator for various inflammatory signals and angiogenesis. It was the aim of this study
to determine its function in poststroke outcome.
Methods and Results—We generated a tamoxifen-inducible and endothelial-specific Stat3 knockout mouse model by
crossbreeding Stat3floxed/KO and Tie2-CreERT2 mice. Cerebral ischemia was induced by 30 minutes of middle cerebral artery
occlusion. We demonstrated that endothelial Stat3 ablation did not alter lesion size 2 days after ischemia but did worsen
functional outcome at 14 days and increase lesion size at 28 days. At this late time point vascular Stat3 expression and
phosphorylation were still increased in wild-type mice. Gene array analysis of a CD31-enriched cell population of the
neurovascular niche showed that endothelial Stat3 ablation led to a shift toward an antiangiogenic and axon growthinhibiting micromilieu after stroke, with an increased expression of Adamts9. Remodeling and glycosylation of the
extracellular matrix and microglia proliferation were increased, whereas angiogenesis was reduced.
Conclusions—Endothelial Stat3 regulates angiogenesis, axon growth, and extracellular matrix remodeling and
is essential for long-term recovery after stroke. It might serve as a potent target for stroke treatment after the acute
phase by fostering angiogenesis and neuroregeneration.  (Circulation. 2015;131:1772-1782. DOI: 10.1161/

Most angiogenic factors, like vascular endothelial growth
factor (Vegf), may increase vascular permeability and thus
increase edema formation. In addition, angiogenesis is strongly
related to inflammatory pathways. For instance, Vegf and interleukin 6 (Il6) converge on the signal transducer and activator
of transcription-3 (Stat3) signaling pathway; on the other hand,
activation of Stat3 by Il6 increases Vegf production.5 In endothelial cells, Stat3 activation promotes angiogenesis by regulating endothelial cell migration and proliferation6 and is involved
in vascular diseases such as pulmonary hypertension.7
Stat3 shows neuroprotective properties in the acute phase
of stroke, inhibiting apoptosis and scavenging reactive oxygen species in neurons, thereby reducing infarct size.8–13 It
might, however, induce detrimental effects in the subacute
phase after stroke. It has been shown that Stat3 is mainly
expressed and activated in microglia and macrophages 24

ong-term recovery after brain ischemia is linked to angiogenesis. How newly formed vessels can improve functional
outcome is unclear. Angiogenesis restores oxygen and nutrient
supply to the affected brain tissue, but poststroke angiogenesis
starts too late to interact with ischemic cell death cascades. The
newly formed vessels seem to be more relevant for regenerative mechanisms, such as neurogenesis, axonal growth, and synaptic plasticity.1 Angiogenesis and neurogenesis are intricately
linked.2 Axonal growth cones and endothelial tip cells of sprouting vessels share many features and respond to the same signaling pathways.3 Angiogenic vessels provide neurotrophic support
to newly generated neurons and facilitate synaptogenesis.4

Clinical Perspective on p 1782
Treatments are needed that foster regeneration at later time
points. Strategies focusing on angiogenesis are ambivalent.

to 72 hours after cerebral ischemia.14 Blocking Stat3 phosphorylation within the first 72 hours reduced lesion size; this
effect is mediated by an inactivation of Stat3 in microglia and
macrophages.
After brain ischemia, endothelial cells seem to express and
phosphorylate Stat3 later than neurons and microglia, beginning at 48 hours and continuing for at least 7 days.8 This is
the time window in which expression and phosphorylation of
Stat3 by endothelial cells reach their highest levels compared
with those of other cell types.8 This delayed activation of the
angiogenic Stat3 pathway in endothelial cells after cerebral
ischemia may indicate an important function of endothelial
Stat3 in regenerative mechanisms. We demonstrated previously that lack of Il6 increased lesion size and worsened
functional outcome 28 days after ischemia. The underlying
mechanism seemed to be a reduction of angiogenesis.15
It was therefore the aim of this study to search for the
specific role of endothelial Stat3 in the pathophysiology of
cerebral ischemia and in particular its effects on poststroke
angiogenesis and long-term outcome. To obtain a knockout of Stat3 that is restricted to endothelial cells in vivo, we
used an inducible endothelial-specific Stat3 knockout mouse
model by crossbreeding Stat3floxed/KO mice16 with Tie2-CreERT2
mice17 (endothelial-Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO). Tie2-CreERT2 littermates treated with tamoxifen served as controls. Cerebral
ischemia was induced by filamentous occlusion of the middle
cerebral artery (MCAo) for 30 minutes. This study shows for
the first time that endothelial Stat3 activation is necessary
for poststroke angiogenesis, alters long-term lesion size, and
plays a beneficial role in functional improvement after stroke.
Endothelial loss of Stat3 leads to an antiangiogenic and axon
growth-inhibiting micromilieu within the neurovascular niche
with induced Adamts9 expression and, consequently, an
altered remodeling of the extracellular matrix.

Methods
A detailed Methods section is provided in the online-only Data
Supplement.

1 μg of RNA was transcribed with murine leukemia virus reverse
transcriptase (Promega). Real-time polymerase chain reaction was
performed with intron spanning primers for tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein and succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit A, flavoprotein as internal
controls19 and primers for Stat3 using Sybr green (Qiagen, Limburg,
the Netherlands). Fold amount of mRNA compared with mean
of internal controls was calculated using the following equation:
2–(Ct[gene of interest]–Ct[internal control]).

Histology and Immunofluorescence
Mice were placed under deep anesthesia, cardially perfused with
NaCl solution, and decapitated. The brains were snap frozen in
–40°C isopentane for cryostat sectioning 2 and 28 days after MCAo.
Cryosections (20 μm) were fixed with acetone/methanol and stained
for caveolin-1, pStat3 (Tyr705), bromodeoxyuridine, NeuN, isolectin-B4, and Adamts9. Cytospins after CD31-MACS were stained
for caveolin-1. Orthogonal projections of vascular networks in the
peri-infarct region were stained with isolectin-B4 (see the online-only
Data Supplement for details).

Lesion Volume Determination and Functional
Outcome
We quantified cerebral lesion volume with ImageJ analysis software
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) on 20-μm NeuN-3,3'diaminobenzidine–stained cryostat sections and calculated volume
by summing up the infarct sizes of each section as described previously18 or by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Functional
outcome was determined with behavioral tests (Rotarod test and the
extended neuroscore). To determine lesion size, we used a total of
16 endothelial-Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO and 23 Tie2-CreERT2 littermates. All underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 2 days after
ischemia. A subset of 9 endothelial-Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO and
12 Tie2-CreERT2 littermates was killed at 2 days after ischemia and a
subset of 7 endothelial-Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO and 11 Tie2-CreERT2
littermates at 28 days for histological lesion size determination. For
behavioral tests, 12 endothelial-Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO and 12 Tie2CreERT2 littermates were used.

Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for determining Vegf (R&D
systems) and Il6 (Invitrogen) levels were performed according to
manufacturer’s instructions.

Animals and Treatments
All of the animal experiments were approved by the local governmental authorities (Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales,
G0354/11). Stat3floxed/KO mice16 were crossbred with Tie2-CreERT2
mice.17 Endothelial-specific knockout of Stat3 was induced by a
5-day intraperitoneal application of tamoxifen (1 mg/d) 7 days before
surgery. Tie2-CreERT2 littermates were treated with tamoxifen and
served as a control group. In a total of 3 animals, 2 wild-type mice
and 1 knockout animal, no lesions developed. These 3 animals were
excluded from the study.

Model of MCAo
Filamentous middle cerebral artery occlusion of the left side was performed for 30 minutes with indicated reperfusion time points according to the published standard operating procedure in our laboratory18
in the DIN9001-certified laboratories at the Charité Department of
Experimental Neurology.

Real-Time Reverse-Transcription Polymerase
Chain Reaction
RNA from sections of ischemic and contralateral hemispheres
was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A total of

Isolation of CD31-Enriched Cells
Mice were killed 4 days after cerebral ischemia. The ipsilateral and
contralateral hemispheres were divided and processed separately.
Hemispheres from 7 animals were pooled. The tissue was dissociated using the Papain Neural Tissue Dissociation kit (Miltenyi
Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Myelin was removed following a protocol published elsewhere.20 Cells were labeled with antiCD31 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). We performed MACS isolation
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA from MACS
was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen). A total of 21
endothelial-Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO and 21 Tie2-CreERT2 littermates
were used and divided to 3 groups each before isolation.

GeneChip Microarray Assay
Sample preparation for microarray hybridization was carried out
as described in the Ambion WT Expression kit protocol (Life
Technologies, Frederick, MD) and the Affymetrix WT Terminal
Labeling and Hybridization user manual (Affymetrix, Inc, Santa
Clara, CA). Sample processing was performed at an Affymetrix
Service Provider and Core Facility, KFB Center of Excellence for
Fluorescent Bioanalytics (Regensburg, Germany).

Conditional Ablation of Endothelial Stat3
An endothelial-specific conditional knockout mouse for Stat3
was generated by crossbreeding endothelial specific CreERT2 mice
(Tie2-CreERT2 mice) with Stat3floxed/KO mice, which have the exon 22
of Stat3 flanked by LoxP sites. A phosphorylation of the tyrosine
residue at position 705 in the protein domain encoded by the exon
22 is indispensable for activation of Stat3. We used the Tie2-CreERT2
mouse generated by Forde et al17 (MGI:2450312), which showed
highly specific endothelial expression with negligible expression
in hematopoietic cells. To test efficacy and specificity of endothelial-Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO after tamoxifen administration,
we performed immunofluorescence costaining of pStat3(Y705)
and caveolin-1. Phosphorylation of Stat3 was induced by ischemia. We observed a significant decrease of phosphorylated
Stat3+/caveolin-1+ endothelial cells of Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO
mice compared with their Tie2-CreERT2 littermates (Figure 1A
and 1B). As expected, we observed no reduction of phosphorylated Stat3 in caveolin-1 negative or nonendothelial cells in
endothelial-Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO mice (Figure 1A and 1C).
However, we did observe pStat3+/caveolin-1+ cells in endothelial Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO mice with tamoxifen treatment and
ischemia. In endothelial cells, the loss of pStat3(Y705) was still
evident at 28 days.

Increased Gene Expression and Stat3
Phosphorylation 28 Days After Ischemia
We determined the expression of Stat3 mRNA after a 30-minute left MCAo and differing reperfusion times up to 28 days
after ischemia. In the ischemic hemisphere, there was a strong
increase in Stat3 expression. The mRNA level was highest 2
days after reperfusion (4-fold induction) and then declined
again at 3 days after reperfusion, but levels were still elevated
at 28 days (Figure 1D). No induction took place at any time
in the nonischemic hemisphere. The amount of activated Stat3
in endothelial cells was determined by immunofluorescence
costainings for pStat3 and caveolin-1 at 2 and 28 days after
cerebral ischemia. In endothelial cells of the peri-infarct area,
Stat3 was still being phosphorylated at 28 days. Furthermore,
at this time point, significantly more endothelial cells were
immunoreactive for pStat3 than had been the case 2 days after
ischemia (Figure 1E).

Conditional Ablation of Endothelial Stat3 Causes
Worse Long-Term Stroke Outcome
Endothelial-Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO and Tie2-CreERT2 littermates received tamoxifen for 5 consecutive days and were
subjected 2 days later to 30 minutes of MCAo (Figure 2A).
In magnetic resonance imaging 2 days after ischemia, no
difference was detected between the genotypes (Figure 2B
and 2C). A subset of both genotypes (n=12 Tie2-CreERT2 littermates and n=9 Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO mice) was killed
for histological evaluation of lesion size at 2 days after ischemia. NeuN immunohistochemistry and quantification of
the lesion size consistently failed to reveal any difference
in the degree of neuronal loss between endothelial-Tie2CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO and Tie2-CreERT2 littermates (Figure 2D
and 2E). However, at 28 days after ischemia, we observed
that genomic ablation of Stat3 had led to lesion sizes that
were larger than those in Tie2-CreERT2 littermates (Figure 3A
and 3B). At 14 days after 30-minute MCAo, functional
outcome as tested by behavioral analysis was worse. In
the Rotarod test, the time-to-drop was significantly lower
(Figure 3C) and the extended neuroscore in endothelialTie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO mice was lower (Figure 3D). Taken
together, ablation of endothelial Stat3 had no effect on shortterm poststroke outcome. In fact, at 14 days after stroke, the
functional outcome was worse, and at 28 days after stroke,
lesion volume was greater.

Endothelial Stat3 Promotes Angiogenesis After
Cerebral Ischemia
Next, we analyzed angiogenesis after cerebral ischemia and
endothelial Stat3 ablation. Vessel density was determined
by measuring the caveolin-1 positive area (see Methods section for details). We observed at 28 days after reperfusion
that endothelial ablation of Stat3 had reduced vessel density
(Figure 4A and 4C). The number of caveolin-1/bromodeoxyuridine double-positive cells was significantly reduced
by 60% (P<0.005; Figure 4B and 4D), indicating a reduced
proliferation of endothelial cells. Vessel density in peri-infarct
striatal regions was reduced as visualized after 3-dimensional
rendering of confocal z-stacks (Figure 4E and 4F and Movie I
in the online-only Data Supplement). Il6 induces the expression of Vegf by activating the Stat3 signaling pathway. At 2
and 28 days after MCAo, we measured the serum levels of Il6
and Vegf using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. There
was no difference between the 2 genotypes, either at 2 or 28
days, for either Il6 or Vegf (Figure IA and IB in the onlineonly Data Supplement).

Endothelial Stat3 Ablation Is Followed By Increased
Percentage of CD11b+/CD45low Cells and of CD11b+/
CD45high Cells
With fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis at 4 days
after MCAo, we determined the percentage of CD11b+/
CD45low and CD11b+/CD45high cells in the total cell population. It is generally assumed that CD11b+/CD45low cells are
microglial cells and that CD11b+/CD45high cells represent
invading myeloid cells. We found an increase of CD11b+/
CD45low cells in the ischemic hemisphere compared with the
contralateral hemisphere, and this increase was significantly

higher after endothelial Stat3 ablation (Figure 4G and 4H).
In Tie2-CreERT2 littermates, we found a slight trend toward
increased invasion of myeloid cells in the ischemic hemisphere compared with the contralateral side, whereas a significant increase of invading myeloid cells was evident in
endothelial-Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO. However, the number of
myeloid cells in the ischemic hemisphere did not differ significantly between endothelial-Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO and
Tie2-CreERT2 littermates.

Endothelial Stat3 Ablation Results in an
Antiangiogenic, Axon Growth-Inhibiting and
Extracellular Matrix–Degrading Micromilieu
We analyzed the transcriptional profile of CD31-enriched
cells at 4 days after cerebral ischemia and endothelial Stat3
ablation. Our isolation and enrichment method maintains
the interaction between endothelial cells and adjacent cells.
We determined the cellular composition of the isolated cells
by immunostaining cytospins after CD31-MACS and found

endothelial cells to be the dominant fraction (Figure 5A).
We found marker genes for endothelial cells, neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes to be present in the isolated RNA
(Figure 5B). In summary, the isolated cell population reflects
the cellular composition of the neurovascular niche.
The expression of 255 genes differed significantly (by >2fold) between the genotypes (Table I in the online-only Data
Supplement). Gene arrays were performed from 3 independent
experiments with 7 animals per experiment and genotype (in
total, 21 Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO and 21 Tie2-CreERT2 littermates). Overall, we found a complex network response with
an increase of antiangiogenic factors and a decrease of angiogenic factors after endothelial Stat3 ablation (Figure 5C and
Table 1). Moreover, we observed an increase of factors that
inhibit axonal growth and a decrease of factors that promote
axonal growth (Figure 5D and Table 2). We also identified
a decreased expression of several components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and an induction of ECM-degrading
enzymes. Interestingly, Adamts9, a potent antiangiogenic and

ECM-degrading enzyme, is strongly induced after endothelial
Stat3 ablation. In the rat it is reported to be expressed exclusively in neurons and astrocytes directly after cerebral ischemia.22 In immune staining we found Adamts9 to be expressed
mainly in endothelial cells of the peri-ischemic area at 4 days
after ischemia (Figure 6A). In addition, we found a slight but
significant increase of reactive oxygen species–producing
genes like iNOS and NOX4 and induced expression of CD14
(Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). These changes
point to an increased inflammatory activation after endothelial
Stat3 ablation.
In summary, endothelial Stat3 ablation leads to a shift of
the transcriptional profile within the neurovascular niche
toward an antiangiogenic and axon growth-inhibiting micromilieu. Moreover, we found a shift toward an ECM-degrading
micromilieu.

Endothelial Stat3 Ablation Changes the
Glycosylation Pattern of the ECM After Cerebral
Ischemia
The composition of the ECM changes after cerebral ischemia.23 Prominently, the expression of proteoglycans is
increased. This type of ECM composition hinders growing
axons from entering the lesion volume and thereby impairs
axonal plasticity and functional recovery. The axon growthinhibiting properties of the proteoglycans are conditioned
by the glycosylation pattern of the glycosaminoglycan side
chains.23 Isolectin-B4 is a lectin derived from Griffonia simplicifolia that binds terminal α-d-galactosyl residues, which
are present mainly on the surface of endothelial and monocytic cells. It has been shown that isolectin-B4 binds the
proteoglycan versican.24 We stained the brains with isolectinB4 at 28 days after cerebral ischemia to identify functional

found an increased staining of the ECM in the ischemic
area (Figure 6B). Moreover, the volume of the isolectin-B4
positive ECM area increased after endothelial Stat3 ablation
(Figure 6B and 6C).

Stat3 is crucial for long-term outcome after stroke. We generated an endothelial-specific and inducible knockout mouse

wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) we used 1 sample t test to test fold mRNA against the hypotheses that these values are 0 on average.
For antiangiogenic genes the fold change was on average 2.0 (P=0.133); for angiogenic genes it was –1.6 (P=0.054), for axon growth
promoting genes it was –2.5 (P<0.001), and for axon growth–inhibiting genes it was 0.6 (P=0.884).

analyze the function of endothelial Stat3 in stroke. Endothelial
Stat3 ablation caused increased lesion size in the long term
after stroke but not in the short term. Angiogenesis was
reduced, whereas the percentage of microglia increased, indicating microglia proliferation. The expression profile within
the neurovascular niche was changed to an antiangiogenic,
axon growth inhibiting micromilieu with ECM degradation.
Most prominently, expression of the antiangiogenic and proteoglycan-cleaving Adamts9 was induced after endothelial
Stat3 ablation and cerebral ischemia. We found Adamts9 to
be expressed mainly in endothelial cells in the peri-ischemic
area. Moreover, after endothelial Stat3 ablation, we found
altered glycosylation patterns of the ECM. In the end, functional outcome was worse after endothelial Stat3 ablation and
cerebral ischemia.
Short-term analysis of lesion volumes 2 days after reperfusion revealed no differences between the genotypes, either in
magnetic resonance imaging or in histology, after 30 minutes
of MCAo (Figure 2A through 2D). This confirms previous
data on the kinetics of Stat3 phosphorylation: Stat3 is highly
induced and activated in neurons in the ischemic core and
peri-infarct region within 8 hours after stroke.8 Stat3 exerts its
antiapoptotic effects in neurons.11,25,26 Stat3 phosphorylation
in contrast does not start in endothelial cells before 48 hours
after ischemia.8 An endothelial-specific knockout of Stat3
should therefore not impact the acute outcome after stroke.
Our results thus fit nicely together with the known kinetics of endothelial Stat3. We compared genotype lesion sizes
at 28 days after ischemia and detected yet upregulated and
phosphorylated Stat3 in endothelial cells (Figure 1D and 1E).
Endothelial Stat3 ablation increased the lesion volume at this
later time point (Figure 3A and 3B).

At 28 days after ischemia, vessel density (Figure 4A and
4C) and endothelial cell proliferation (Figure 4B and 4D) were
reduced after endothelial Stat3 ablation. After cerebral ischemia, Stat3 is activated by several inflammatory factors, including Il6, Lif, and Cntf.27–29 Activation of Stat3 by Il6 is followed
by increased angiogenesis, which is in part mediated by transcriptional induction of Vegf.30 This led us to seek differences
in Il6 and Vegf serum levels after endothelial knockout of Stat3.
Contrary to our expectations, however, endothelial ablation
of Stat3 had no impact on systemic Il6 or Vegf levels (Figure
IA and IB in the online-only Data Supplement). Endothelial
Stat3 is apparently not involved in elevated Il6 serum levels
after cerebral ischemia, and the induction of angiogenesis after
stroke by Stat3 activation is independent of Vegf.
We established a method to isolate endothelial cells and
adjacent cells of the neurovascular niche after endothelial
Stat3 ablation and cerebral ischemia and we analyzed the
transcriptional profile of this cell population by gene array
analysis. Capillary endothelial cells are embedded in a firm
basal membrane consisting mainly of collagens. The triple
helix structure of collagens can be destroyed by collagenase
digestion but is resistant to cleavage by trypsin, pepsin, or
papain.31 Therefore, we digested the brain matrix with papain
to maintain the interaction between the basal membrane of
the vasculature and the adherent cells of the neurovascular
niche. Endothelial cells and all adherent cells were isolated by
CD31-MACS. We chose a time point 4 days after ischemia,
when angiogenesis and axonal growth are still going on but
mechanisms of the acute phase after ischemia have already
ceased.
In the CD31-enriched population 4 days after cerebral
ischemia, we identified 255 genes that showed differing

expression levels between genotypes (Table I in the onlineonly Data Supplement). Overall, endothelial Stat3 ablation
led to an antiangiogenic and axon growth–inhibiting micromilieu (Figure 5A and 5B). Interestingly, endothelial Tie2CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO mice showed higher expression of apelin,
apelin receptor, and placental growth factor, all potent angiogenic factors, than did their Tie2-CreERT2 littermates. This
might indicate a compensatory activation of alternative angiogenic pathways that, after activation, however, did not change
angiogenesis. It is known that, after ischemia, the outgrowing
vessels support neuroblast migration in a scaffold-like manner, directing migration to the damaged areas.2 The reduction

of angiogenesis after endothelial Stat3 ablation precludes this
process and might thus contribute to impaired neuroplasticity.
Most prominent was an increased expression of Adamts9
with strong antiangiogenic activity.32 It is reported that
Adamts9 in the rat is mainly expressed in neurons 24 hours
after cerebral ischemia.22 We found its expression mainly in
endothelial cells in the peri-ischemic tissue 4 days after ischemia. Adamts proteases are classified in 3 subfamilies based
on their preference for cleaving specific ECM components.33
Adamts9 belongs to the proteoglycanases and degrades chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are major components of the ECM and are characterized

After cerebral ischemia, the composition of the ECM is
changed to a more juvenile matrix type.34 Therefore, the ECM
first has to be degraded. In proteoglycans this is performed
predominantly by Adamts proteases. Finally, the expression
of all proteoglycans is much higher after ischemia, and they

contribute to a large extent to the development of the ECM
component in the lesion volume. The chronic lesion volume
on the one hand improves the physical stability of the ischemic area; on the other hand it strongly impairs neuroplasticity.23 Thus, digestion of proteoglycans by Adamts proteases
is thought to have beneficial effects.33 Endothelial Stat3 ablation led to an intense upregulation of Adamts9, which quite
specifically cleaves the long variants of the proteoglycans,

aggrecan and versican, but not the short proteoglycan brevican.
However, the expression of the short proteoglycans neurocan
and brevican was reduced, as was the expression of tenascinR. Also reduced was the expression of phosphacan and its cellular binding partners Ncam, Nrcam, and contactin-2.
In general, the expression pattern of the matrix within the neurovascular niche was shifted toward the juvenile matrix type with
a looser mesh-size and thus axon growth-promoting ECM environment, with less intercellular ECM binding after endothelial
Stat3 ablation. Nonetheless, the expression of other axon growthinhibiting genes and the suppression of growth-promoting genes
seemed to outweigh this effect after endothelial Stat3 ablation.
Adamts9 expression was not able to reduce chronic lesion size
or improve functional outcome. Furthermore, in isolectin-B4
staining we found an increase of α-d-galactosyl residues in the
chronically damaged tissue. The axon growth-inhibiting activity
of proteoglycans is partly mediated by their glycosylation patterns. Endothelial Stat3 might be highly relevant for regulation
of the glycosylation pattern of the ECM in the chronic lesion and
might thereby influence axon growth and neuroplasticity.
Beyond that, we found a slightly increased invasion of
monocytes 4 days after cerebral ischemia and endothelial
Stat3 ablation. Proliferation of microglia was increased. The
expression of reactive oxygen species–building genes, such as
iNOS and NOX4, as well as CD14, was higher, which might
contribute to delayed neuronal cell death and increased lesion
size in the long term after ischemia.
As a consequence, treatment strategies that focus on Stat3
signaling of endothelial cells offer the following 3 advantages:
1) accessibility for intravenous treatment, 2) treatment options
in the acute phase of stroke beyond the narrow time window
for thrombolysis, and 3) pleiotropic neuroregenerative action
with widespread consequences for brain plasticity through
changes in the microenvironment. Although this study provides substantial insight into the consequences of endothelial
Stat3 signaling on long-term outcome after cerebral ischemia,
further studies need to address the beneficial effects of endothelial-specific Stat3 signaling as a treatment option. We suggest using drugs that do not pass the blood–brain barrier to
achieve an endothelial-specific stimulation of Stat3 and avoid

activation of microglial Stat3, which might have detrimental
consequences.

Clinical Perspective
The number of patients experiencing ischemic stroke is increasing because of an aging population. Acute treatment is limited
to thrombolysis, which has a short therapeutic window (4.5 hours) and poor accessibility. Poststroke angiogenesis correlates
with recovery and might be causally related to functional brain recovery. Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3
ablation, which in mice was restricted to endothelial cells and induced only a few days before focal brain ischemia, increased
lesion size and worsened long-term functional outcome after stroke but had no effect in the short term. Signal transducer and
activator of transcription-3 ablation reduced angiogenesis and changed the transcriptional profile within the neurovascular
niche to an antiangiogenic and axon growth–inhibiting micromilieu with increased remodeling of the extracellular matrix
and altered glycosylation patterns of the extracellular matrix. This is the first study that provides a link between a pure endothelial intervention and neuroplasticity. We identified endothelial signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 as a key
factor for angiogenesis and modification of the microenvironment of the neurovascular niche. Drugs targeting endothelial
signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 have the following potential advantages: extended treatment window (for
up to 48 hours after stroke onset) and endoluminal access (oral or intravenous); thus, there is no need for penetration of the
blood–brain barrier. Our study improves our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying poststroke recovery in
mice. In particular, this novel mechanism provides evidence for a causal role of angiogenesis in neuronal recovery and supports the concept of endothelial targeting of drugs for the treatment of cerebral ischemia.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
Supplemental Methods
Animals and treatments
All animal experiments were approved by the local governmental authorities (Landesamt für
Gesundheit und Soziales, G0354/11). Mice had access to food and water ad libitum and
were kept under a 12 hours light and dark cycle. Stat3floxed/KO mice1 were crossbred with Tie2CreERT2 mice.2 Both transgenic mouse lines were backcrossed onto a C57Bl/6_N background
and littermates were used for the experiments. Mice were genotyped by standard
polymerase chain reaction protocols. Endothelial specific knock out of Stat3 was induced by
a 5 day i.p. application of Tamoxifen (1 mg/d) which results in an excision of exon 22 that
codes for the domain including tyrosine 705 (Y705) which is phosphorylated for activation of
Stat3. Tie2-CreERT2 littermates served as control group. The concealment to the genotypes
was blinded throughout the entire experiment and histological analysis. Scientists were
blinded to the allocation of the mice to the groups. Litters were caged in mixed groups after
heterozygous breeding and undergone surgery after randomization. Animals for experiments
were gender and age matched. Tie2-CreERT2 littermates and Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO mice
were 4.8 ± 1.8 and 4.6 ± 1.6 month old. The sex ratio between Tie2-CreERT2 littermates and
Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO mice did not differ as analyzed using Fisher’s Exact test.
Endothelial specific knock out of Stat3 was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of
phosphorylated Stat3 (Y705). Mice received BrdU (50 µg/g body weight) i.p. from day 2-7
after MCAo at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. 3 animals in total were excluded from the study
due to the lack of a lesion while two of them being Tie2-CreERT2 littermates and 1 Tie2CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO.

Model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo)

Filamentous middle cerebral artery occlusion of the left side was performed for 30 minutes
with indicated reperfusion time points according to the published standard operating
procedure in our laboratory.3 In brief, mice were anesthetized with 1.0% isofluorane in a
mixture of 70% vol/vol N2O and 30% vol/vol O2 using a vaporizer and face mask. Brain
ischemia was induced with an 8.0 nylon monofilament coated with a silicone resin /hardener
mixture (Xantopren M Mucosa and Activator NF Optosil Xantopren, Haereus Kulzer,
Germany) as described. The filament was introduced into the left internal carotid artery up to
the anterior cerebral artery. Thereby, the middle cerebral artery and anterior choroidal
arteries were occluded. Filaments were withdrawn after 30 min to allow reperfusion.

RNA-isolation
Mice were deeply anesthetized, cardially perfused with NaCl-solution, decapitated and the
brain removed after 2, 3, 7, and 28 days of reperfusion. The brains were cut in 1 mm coronal
slices using a brain matrix. In the slices ischemic and contralateral hemispheres were
separated and snap frozen and pestled in liquid nitrogen, homogenized using a Dounce
homogenizer and RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen). RNA was stored at -80 °C
prior to transcription.

Real-time RT-PCR
1 µg of RNA was transcribed with MLV-reverse transcriptase (Promega) using random
primers (Roche) and oligo-dT primers (Eurofins-MWG). Real-time PCR was performed with
intron spanning primers for Ywhaz and Sdha as internal controls and primers for Stat3 using
Sybr green (Qiagen). Comparable primer efficiency was confirmed. For all runs melting
curves were analyzed. No template and untranscribed RNA served as negative controls.
Fold-amount of mRNA compared to mean of internal controls was calculated using the
equation: 2-(Ct(gene of interest)-Ct(internal control))

Histology and immunofluorescence
Mice were deeply anesthetized, cardially perfused with NaCl-solution, decapitated, and
brains snap frozen in -40 °C isopentane for cryostat sectioning at 2 and 28 days after MCAo.
20 µm cryosections were fixed with Aceton/Methanol for 10 min at -20 °C and washed
3 times for 5 min with PBS. Sections that were stained for caveolin-1 (B&D) or
pStat3 (Tyr705) (Cell signaling) were blocked in PBS with 10 % normal goat serum and
0.1 % Triton for 1 h and incubated with caveolin-1 (1:100, BD), Adamts9 (1:50; Santa Cruz)
or pStat3 (1:50, Cell signaling) antibodies over night, washed 2 times with PBS, incubated
with goat anti-mouse antibody (1:400, conjugated with Alexa 488) or goat anti-rabbit antibody
(1:400, conjugated with Alexa 594) for 2 h, washed 2 times for 5 min with PBS, incubated
3 min with DAPI, washed 2 times with water and mounted with immunomount (GeneTex).
Sections that were stained for BrdU were incubated with 2 N HCl for 30 min at 37 °C followed
by an incubation in 0.1 M borate buffer for 10 min at room temperature, washed 6 times for
10 min with TBS, blocked in TBS with 10 % normal goat serum and 0.1 % Triton for 30 min,
incubated with primary antibody against BrdU (1:100, AbD Serotec) in TBS with 1 % normal
goat serum and 0.1 % Triton over night, washed 2 times for 5 min with TBS and 1 time for
15 min with TBS with 1 % normal goat serum and 0.1 % Triton, incubated with secondary
antibody (1:400) for 2 h washed 2 times for 5 min with PBS, incubated 3 min with DAPI,
washed 2 times with water and mounted with immunomount (GeneTex). Sections stained for
NeuN were incubated with 0.3 % H2O2, washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS, blocked in PBS
with 1 % normal goat serum and 0.1 % Triton for 30 min, incubated wit anti-NeuN-biotin
antibody (1:100, Chemicon (Millipore)) over night, washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS,
incubated with VECTASTAIN Elite ABC-kit reagent (Vector labs) for 1 h, washed 3 times for
5 min with PBS, incubated with Vector DAB substrate (Vector labs) for 10 min, washed
3 times for 5 min with water, dehydrated with ethanol, incubated with Rotihistol (Carl Roth)
and mounted with Vitroclud (R. Langenbrinck, Labor- und Medizintechnik).

For orthogonal projections, brains were perfused with NaCl-solution with subsequent 4%
PFA perfusion, and brains were vibratome-sliced into frontal 500 µm sections, incubated with
isolectin-B4 (Griffonia simplicifolia) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, Germany) without further permeabilization to specifically label the blood vessel
network. In addition, the slices were optically cleared with a solution consisting of 4 M urea,
10% glycerol (v/v), 0.1% TritonX-100 (v/v) for 2 days.
Microscopy
Widefield fluorescence microscopic images were collected using an Olympus IX81 inverted
microscope equipped with a MT10 illumination system, a CCD camera (Hamamatsu,
Ammersee, Germany) and a Scan FM table (Maerzhaeuser, Wetzlar, Germany) for
automated image acquisition under the control of Xcellence software (Olympus, Hamburg,
Germany). For whole brain slice images (multiple image alignments) UPlan FLN 4x and for
all other images LCACHN 20x were used.
Confocal images of isolectin B4 stained vascular networks were collected with a spinning
disc system consisting of a Axio Observer Z.1 microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped
with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 unit using a 20x/0.4 Korr M27 objective and processed with
ZEN2012 software (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Orthogonal projections (60 µm) and
supplementary movie were generated by ImageJ.
Lesion volume determination and behavioral tests
Cerebral lesion volume was quantified with ImageJ analysis software (NIH, USA) on 20 µm
NeuN-DAB-stained cryostat sections and calculated by summing the infarct sizes of each
section as described previously.3 To assess motor coordination, a Rotarod test was used
(TSE Sytems). Mice were placed on an accelerating rotating rod (acceleration from 2 rpm to
40 rpm within 5 min) and a stop-clock was started. When the mice dropped and touched the
sensing platform below, the stop-clock stopped automatically. Each animal performed three
trials.

An extended neuroscore that consisted of several components was performed. The first
component was a modified Bederson score that provided a quick overall assessment of the
activity and locomotor capabilities of the mouse with a score of 0 indicating normal
spontaneous movement, a score of 4 indicating no movement, and circling behaviours or
forelimb flexion making up the middle range of the score.4 The next three components
consisted of 3 point score hand tests. The first two require that the mouse be lowered by the
base of the tail towards the lid of the home cage. A mouse would score 0 (normal postural
reflex) if both forelimbs were extended, while a score of 2 would be assigned for
asymmetrical forelimb extension or curved body posture. An animal would score 0 on the
third component (normal forelimb grasping reflex) if both forelimbs grasped the lid of the
home cage, versus 1 for asymmetrical grasping, or 2 for no grasping. Finally, the vertical
screen test was conducted in which the animal was placed on the lid of the home cage and
the lid was gently tilted to a 90 ° angle. A score of 0 would indicate normal locomotor
behaviour as the mouse would hang on and climb around, whereas a score of 2 indicates the
inability to remain on the lid, or jumping off. A composite score was determined for each
mouse at each timepoint.
For lesion size determination a total number of 16 endothelial-Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO and
23 wildtype littermates were used. All underwent MRI at 2 days after ischemia. A subset of 9
endothelial-Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO and 12 wildtype littermates were killed at 2 days after
ischemia and a subset of 7 endothelial-Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO and 11 wildtype littermates
at 28 days for histological lesion size determination. For behavioral tests 12 endothelial-Tie2CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO and 12 wildtype littermates were used.

MRI
Magnet resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using a 7 Tesla rodent scanner
(Pharmascan 70 ⁄ 16AS) with a 16 cm horizontal bore magnet and a 9 cm (inner diameter)
shielded gradient with an H-resonance-frequency of 300 MHz and a maximum gradient

strength of 300 mT/m. For imaging a 1H-RF quadratur-volume resonator with an inner
diameter of 20 mm was used. Data acquisition and image processing were carried out with
the Bruker software Paravision 4.0. During the examinations mice were placed on a heated
circulating water blanket to ensure constant body temperature of 37 °C. Anaesthesia was
induced with 2.5% and maintained with 1.0–2.0% isoflurane delivered in an O2/N2O mixture
(30/70%) via a facemask under constant ventilation monitoring. A RARE-T2-weighted
sequence was used. Imaging parameters: for T2 TR / TE = 4200 / 36 ms, RARE factor 8, 4
averages). 20 axial slices with a slice thickness of 0.5 mm, a field of view of 2.75 x 2.75 cm
and a matrix of 256 x 256 were positioned over the brain excluding olfactory bulb. Data
evaluation was performed with Analyse 5.0.
For stroke volumetry the hyperintense areas of ischemic tissue in T2-weighted images were
assigned with a region of interest tool (ROI). This enables a threshold-based segmentation
by connecting all pixels within a specified threshold range about the selected seed pixel and
results in a 3D object map of the whole stroke region. Further the total volume of the whole
object map was automatically calculated.

Vessel density determination by immunofluorescence
Vessels were stained with anti-caveolin-1 antibodies and images of the brain section
containing the ischemic area were taken in 40x magnification and aligned to a multiple image
alignment (MIA) of the complete brain section. The area stained for caveolin-1 was
determined using ImageJ software by selecting a constant color threshold for all MIAs. The
ratio of the area of caveolin-1 on the ischemic hemisphere to the area on the contralateral
hemisphere was calculated to normalize the values for different brain sizes. In addition
caveolin-1 and BrdU double positive cells were counted.

ELISA

ELISA assays for determining Vegf (R&D systems) and Il6 (Invitrogen) levels were
performed according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Isolation of CD31-enriched cells
Mice were euthanized 4 days after cerebral ischemia by i.p. injection of 200 μl pentobarbitalsodium (Narcoren, Pharmazeutischen Handelsgesellschaft) and perfused using a 0.9 %
NaCl solution. The brain was extracted and stored in ice-cold HBSS (Gibco-Invitrogen). The
olfactory bulbs and the cerebellum were cut by a scalpel and discarded. The ipsi- and
contralateral hemispheres were divided and processed separately. Hemispheres from 68 animals were pooled.
The tissue was dissociated using the Papain Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec,
Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To remove the
myelin we followed a protocol published elsewhere.5 In brief, per one hemisphere the brain
cell suspension was mixed with a total of 25 ml of a 22 % Percoll (Th.Geyer, Renningen,
Germany) solution and a layer of 5 ml cold PBS (Gibco-Invitrogen) was added on top.
Centrifugation at 950 g with slow acceleration and without breaks created a gradient that
separated the cell pellet on the bottom of the tube from the myelin which was carefully
aspirated. The cell pellet was resuspended in sorting buffer for subsequent magneticactivated cell sorting (MACS) or flow cytometry analysis. A total number of 21 endothelialTie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO and 21 wildtype littermates were used and divided to 3 groups each
before isolation.

MACS sorting
The CD31+ samples for the microarray were generated using MACS. Following percoll
gradient centrifugation, cell pellets were resuspended in PBS, containing 0.5% FCS and 2

mM EDTA and labeled with anti-CD31 microbeads™ (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-097-418). The
MACS isolation was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions and cells were
subsequently used for RNA isolation. Purity of CD31+ sorted cells was assessed by flow
cytometry and cytospin. For cytospin, 50,000 MACS-sorted cells in 100 µl were centrifuged
onto glass slides for 5 min at 650 rpm using a Shandon Cytospin 3 cyto-centrifuge. Total
RNA from MACS or FACS-sorted cells was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). Total RNA was eluted in RNase-free water and RNA yield was measured
using a Nanodrop 1000 (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE, USA) spectrophotometer and quality
was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Samples
were stored at -80 °C until further use.

GeneChip microarray assay
Sample preparation for microarray hybridization was carried out as described in the Ambion
WT Expression Kit Protocol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the Affymetrix WT
Terminal Labeling and Hybridization User Manual (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA).
In brief, 300 ng of total RNA were used to generate double-stranded cDNA. 12 µg of
subsequently synthesized cRNA was purified and reverse transcribed into sense-strand (ss)
cDNA, whereat unnatural dUTP residues were incorporated. Purified ss cDNA was
fragmented using a combination of uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) and apurinic/apyrimidinic
endonuclease 1 (APE 1) followed by a terminal labeling with biotin. 3,8 µg fragmented and
labeled ss cDNA were hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays for 16 h at 45 °C
in a rotating chamber. Hybridized arrays were washed and stained in an Affymetrix Fluidics
Station FS450, and the fluorescent signals were measured with an Affymetrix GeneChip
Scanner 3000 7G.

Sample processing was performed at an Affymetrix Service Provider and Core Facility, “KFB
- Center of Excellence for Fluorescent Bioanalytics” (Regensburg, Germany; www.kfbregensburg.de).

Microarray data analysis
Summarized probe set signals were calculated by using the RMA6 algorithm with the
Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Console Software. After exporting into Microsoft Excel,
average signal values, comparison fold changes and significance P values were calculated
using unequal variance Student’s t test. Probe sets with a fold change above 2.0 fold and a
p-value lower than 0.05 were considered as significantly regulated.

FACS
For FACS analysis, a sample of each single cell suspension (200 µl) after tissue dissociation
and before MACS analysis was transferred into round bottom FACS tubes followed by a
washing step with 3 ml FACS buffer (PBS, 1 % BSA, 0.1 % EDTA). After centrifugation cells
were re-suspended in 50 µl FACS buffer containing the antibody mix. For determination of
the auto fluorescence of the cells, one sample of unstained cells was set aside and staining
controls with respective isotypes were prepared by splitting the samples before staining. The
FACS analyzer was calibrated using BD™Calibrite beads followed by the automated
compensation

program.

To

distinguish

between

resident

microglia

and

invading

macrophages, we used the markers CD11b-APC and CD45-efluor™450 for FACS analysis
(all antibodies from eBioscience, San Diego, CA). The percentage of positive cells
determined over 10,000 events were analyzed on a BD Biosciences LSR Fortessa 5 Laser
analyzer and fluorescence intensity is expressed in arbitrary units on a logarithmic scale. Coexpression of anti-mouse CD11b-APC and CD45-efluor™450 are shown in density plots.

CD11b+CD45hi cells are infiltrating monocytes/macrophages while CD11b+CD45low are the
intrinsic microglial population. Data are presented as mean +/- SD, n = 3.

Statistical analysis
All data are presented as scatter dot blots with mean ± standard deviation. The sex ratio was
tested using Fisher’s exact test. All data were analyzed using unpaired two-tailed Students tTest. Deviation from normal distribution was checked with histograms and calculation of
skewness. In case of an absolute value of the skewness lower one we treated the data as
sufficiently normally distributed with regard to statistical methods which require normal
distributed data. In case of skewness we log-transformed the data before analyses or used
non-parametric methods. Unequal variance t-test for independent samples was used for
gene expression analysis and if indicated (Figure 1e). Data of the extended neuroscore were
tested using the Whitney-Mann-U-test.
For the test of endothelial specific ablation of Stat3 we used regression analysis with robust
variance estimates to overcome the problem of unequal variances with day, genotype and
the interaction of both as independent variables.
Stat3 mRNA (log-transformed) after MCAo over time in wildtype mice ipsi/contra was tested
with a linear mixed model including interaction term for time*ipsi/contra to account for
clustering of data within mice (random intercept model). FACS data were analyzed similarly
with a linear mixed model using FACS as dependent variable (log-transformed) and
genotype, CD11b+/CD45low/CD11b+/CD45high and ipsilateral/contralateral as independent
variables. In the model we also included interaction terms for genotype*ipsi/contra and
CD11b+/CD45low/CD11b+/CD45high*genotype.

All

reported

p-values

are

derived

from

regression based post hoc tests using Bonferroni-adjustment for multiple testing. Bonferroni
adjustment was done for post-hoc tests in a particular regression model. Otherwise no
adjustment for multiple testing was applied since this an exploratory study.

For testing expression levels of angiogenic or axon-modulating genes between WT and KO
we used one sample t-test to test fold_mRNA against the hypotheses that these values are 0
on average.
Regression models, unequal variance t-test and one sample t-test were calculated using IBM
SPSS 22.0. The regression model with robust variance estimates was calculated using
STATA/IC 13.1.

Supplemental Figure

 
 
Supplemental Figure 1. Endothelial Stat3 has no impact on systemic Il6 and Vegf
serum levels after cerebral ischemia. Serum levels of Il6 (A) were determined at 2 days
and 28 days after cerebral ischemia. Data are presented as scatter dot blots with mean ± s.d.
Two way ANOVA was followed by Tukey’s posthoc analysis with F(1,36) = 8.6 for reperfusion
time point with p = 0.006. There was no significant difference between genotypes with
F(1,36) = 0.08 and p = 0.78. *p = 0.02 versus corresponding 2 days reperfusion time points
within the same genotype group. Serum levels of Vegf (B) were determined 2 days and 28
days after cerebral ischemia. Data are presented as scatter dot blots with mean ± s.d. Two
way ANOVA was followed by Tukey’s posthoc analysis with F(1,40) = 94.4 for reperfusion time
point with p < 0.001. There was no significant difference between genotypes with F(1,40) = 0.5
and p = 0.51. ***p < 0.001 versus corresponding 2 days reperfusion time points within the
same genotype group.

Supplemental video legend
Supplemental movie 1. Post-ischemic angiogenesis is reduced after endothelialspecific ablation of Stat3. Tie2-CreERT2 littermates (n=11) and Tie2-CreERT2;Stat3floxed/KO
(n=7) were subjected to 30 min MCAo after 5 days of daily tamoxifen administration followed
by a free interval of 2 days and were killed 28 days after cerebral ischemia and stained for
caveolin-1. Confocal images of isolectin B4 stained vascular networks were collected with a
spinning disc system consisting of a Axio Observer Z.1 microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany)
equipped with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 unit using a 20x/0.4 Korr M27 objective and processed
with ZEN2012 software (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Orthogonal projections (60 µm) and
supplementary movie were generated by ImageJ. 3D projections of peri-infarct vascular
networks.
