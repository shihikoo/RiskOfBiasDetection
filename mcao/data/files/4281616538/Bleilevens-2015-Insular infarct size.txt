Abstract  Cerebral injuries can trigger stress-related cardiomyopathy. The extent of cerebral injury and the involvement of the insular cortex influence the incidence and
extent of myocardial injury (MI), and drugs with proven
neuroprotective and cardioprotective properties such as
levosimendan might be beneficial. This hypothesis was
addressed in a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion. Transient brain ischemia was induced for 60 min
by intraluminal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in
40 male Wistar rats. Treatment with levosimendan (24 µg/
kg) was started briefly before reperfusion. Hemodynamic
parameters were recorded and cerebral and MI quantified
after 24 h. Levosimendan treatment significantly reduced
cerebral infarct size in the cortex, but not in the striatal
and insular regions. However, its effects on survival (28
vs. 45 %), incidence of MI (8 vs. 33 %) as indicated by
a troponin I (sTnI) threshold of 4.8 µg/L and large insular
infarcts of ≥10 mm3 (23 vs. 50 %) failed to reach statistical
significance. Blood pressure demonstrated significant differences related to insular infarct size during reperfusion.
Levosimendan demonstrated no relevant effects on markers
of MI (sTnI = 1.5 ± 2.8 vs. 5.3 ± 7.2 µg/L, P = 0.121).
Insular infarct size could be identified as the only predictor of MI (odds ratio = 1.86, P  = 0.037). In conclusion,
the current investigation confirmed insular infarct size as a
predictor of MI and source of hemodynamic compromise,

region might explain this.

Introduction
Several types of brain injuries, especially stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), can trigger cardiac injury and
impede myocardial function (Samuels 2007). Although
the exact mechanism is still unknown, elevated circulating catecholamine, cardiac autonomic damage and accelerated cardiac sympathetic tone were assumed to be the
major source, leading to the term “stress cardiomyopathy.”
This syndrome is also known as “broken heart syndrome”
or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and is represented by “neurogenic stunned myocardium” (Guglin and Novotorova
2011). The diagnostic criteria include transient regional
wall motion abnormalities in the mid segments of the left
ventricle with or without apical involvement exceeding the
perfusion area of one major coronary vessel, presence of
severe stressors, ST-segment abnormalities, elevated serum
troponin levels and absence of coronary disease, pheochromocytoma or myocarditis (Iltumur et al. 2006). Because
the prognosis of the patients was crucially influenced by
fatal cardiac events, such as myocardial infarction (19 %),
heart failure (9 %) and sudden death (22 %) (Prosser et al.
2007; Rincon et al. 2008), the treatment of cardiac insufficiency and cardioprotective therapeutic regimes might
improve outcomes.
The calcium sensitizer levosimendan has not only cardioprotective properties similar to volatile anesthetics or

13

	
150

opioids (Metzsch et al. 2007; Hein et al. 2009) but is also
useful for the treatment of severe heart failure, especially
in catecholamine-resistant shock (Werdan et al. 2012).
In contrast to other positive inotropic agents, it bypasses
β-adrenergic receptors and phosphodiesterase type III and
thus does not increase myocardial oxygen consumption or
trigger proapoptotic signaling pathways (Talan et al. 2011).
Its neuroprotective properties (Katircioglu et al. 2008; Lafci
et al. 2008; Hein et al. 2013) might support this action; the
incidence and extent of myocardial injury (MI) correlated
with cerebral infarct size (Iltumur et al. 2006). Therefore,
we tested the hypothesis that levosimendan could reduce
the incidence and extent of MI triggered by experimental
stroke either by limiting neurological injury or by directly
protecting the heart against neurogenically induced stress.
Hemodynamic responses and markers of MI were investigated in a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) with and without levosimendan treatment and were analyzed with respect to the extent of cerebral injury.

Materials and methods
Animals
Recordings, serum samples and tissue specimens were
taken from a previous study on the effects of levosimendan
on cerebral reperfusion injury in a rat MCAO model (Hein
et al. 2013). Selection of data followed different criteria,
and additional analyses were performed (quantification of
insular infarct volume, heart rate variability and MI). Forty
male Wistar rats (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) with
verifiable cerebral infarction after MCAO and bodyweight
between 350 and 450 g could be included retrospectively.
Additional six sham-operated animals were used as negative controls for gene expression analyses. All procedures
were in accordance with the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised in 1996)
and were approved by the Governmental Animal Care
and Use Committee of the State Nordrhine Westfalia (No.
8.87-50.10.37.09.258; Landesamt für Natur-, Umwelt- und
Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen, Recklinghausen,
Germany).

ventilated and monitored with electrocardiogram, pulse
oximetry and invasive measurement of blood pressure.
Cerebral ischemia was induced for 60 min by insertion of
a filament through the left common and internal carotid
artery to occlude the origin of the left middle cerebral
artery, which was validated by a reduction in blood flow in
the parietal cortex to 20–30 % of baseline values, as measured by laser Doppler (VP10M200ST/P10d, Moor Instruments, Devon, UK). SAH would induce a further decrease
in blood flow (Schmid-Elsaesser et al. 1998). After 30 min
of reperfusion, all catheters were removed, the vessels were
ligated, and all wounds were closed after local application
of 0.2 % ropivacaine (Naropin, AstraZeneca, Plankstadt,
Germany). The animals received intraperitoneal 20 mg/kg
metamizole (Novalgin, Sanofi Aventis, Frankfurt, Germany) as pain prophylaxis and were extubated when spontaneous breathing and righting reflex returned.
Experimental groups
Forty animals were randomized to the treatment or control
group using an envelope system and received either an i.v.
bolus infusion of 24 µg/kg levosimendan (Simdax, Orion
Pharma, Espoo, Finland) or an equal amount of saline
(NaCl) over the time course of 20 min, starting 5 min prior
to the onset of reperfusion. Six sham-operated animals
were used as controls.
Hemodynamics
A data acquisition system (PowerLab, ADInstruments,
Spechbach, Germany) was used to monitor and record the
arterial pressure, electrocardiogram, cerebral blood flow
and body temperature. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood
pressure (MAP) and parameters of heart rate variability
(HRV) were analyzed from recordings of 3, 10 and 20 min
before ischemia, as well as every 10 min after induction of
ischemia and for the first 30 min of reperfusion (LabChart
7.3.7 Pro, ADInstruments, Spechbach/Germany). To quantify HRV, the spectral powers of a low-frequency region
(0.195–2.5 Hz) and high-frequency region (0.605–2.5 Hz)
were used to describe changes in sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Both values were normalized to total
power minus the very-low-frequency component below
0.195 Hz (HF/TP, LF/TP) (Cheung et al. 1997).

Surgical procedures
Quantification of neurological injury
As described previously, anesthesia was induced by an
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 100 mg/kg S-ketamine
(Ketanest S, Pfizer, New York, USA) and 10 mg/kg xylazine (Xylazin 2 %, Medistar, Ascheberg, Germany) and
maintained by repetitive i.p. injections of 20 mg/kg S-ketamine. After oral intubation, the animals were mechanically

13

At 24 h after the onset of reperfusion, the rats were killed
after intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg thiopental (Trapanal, Nycomed, Konstanz, Germany), and serum samples
were collected before transcardial perfusion with 100 mL
ice-cold Ringer’s solution. Immediately after the procedure,

Exp Brain Res (2015) 233:149–156	

the head was detached and the brain removed and cut into
seven 2-mm cross sections, which were stained with 1 %
2.3.5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, SERVA, Antwerpen, Belgium) for 15 min at 37 °C to differentiate between
the ischemic lesion and the viable tissue. After digitalization, the infarcted areas in the cortex and striatum were calculated by planimetry (ImageJ 1.42, National institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD/USA) and corrected for edema volume as the difference between left and right hemispheric
volumes, as described previously (Ryang et al. 2011; Bleilevens et al. 2013). Involvement of the insular cortex was
further quantified after its boundaries were marked according to the Paxinos brain atlas (Paxinos and Watson 2007;
Min et al. 2009).
Quantification of myocardial injury
Troponin I (sTnI), which was assayed with a commercially available ELISA Kit (2010-2-HS, Life Diagnostics
Inc., West Chester, PA, USA), was used as a serum marker
of MI and for the definition of relevant MI a priori: The
threshold value of 4.8 µg/L from a previous investigation in
rats to predict myocardial infarction was used in this analysis (Vietta et al. 2013).
The heart of each animal was dissected immediately
after transcardial perfusion, and left ventricular specimens
were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C
until quantification of RNA content of different markers. As described earlier, the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) was performed on a PCR system (StepOne-Plus,
Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA/USA) (Roehl et al.
2013) using specific TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems)
for the following genes related to heart failure, calcium
signaling and inflammation: connective tissue growth factor (CTGF, Rn00573960_g1), (BNP, Rn00676450_g1),
osteopontin (OPN, Rn00563571_m1), sarco/endoplasmic
reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2 (SERCA2, Rn01499544_m1),
ryanodine receptor-2 (RyR2, Rn01470303_m1), adenylate
cyclase-7 (AdCy7, Rn01538054_m1), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα, Rn00562055_m1) and interleukin 6 (IL6,
Rn01410330_m1). Relative quantities (RQ) of targets were
calculated according to the 2−ΔΔCt method and normalized
to the reference gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Rn99999916_s1) and relative to expression
in hearts from non-diseased rats (StepOne Software v2.3,
Applied Biosystems) (Livak and Schmittgen 2001). To
compare gene expression between groups, the ratio of corresponding RQ values was calculated.
Statistical analysis
Animals that did not survive were excluded from the analysis. In contrast to the original investigation, all animals with

151

cerebral infarction were included independent of size and
pattern or cerebral perfusion profiles (Hein et al. 2013).
Indices of the extent of neurological injury and treatment
were tested for their predictive value by a univariate logistic regression analysis. Receiver operator curves (ROC)
were used to define threshold values for significant predictors of MI to form subgroups and thus describe infarct
size independent of any cardioprotective effects of levosimendan. The effect of levosimendan on survival, incidence
of MI and excess of threshold values of infarct sizes were
analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. To describe the effects
of levosimendan on neurological and cardiac injury, additional groups were formed according to thresholds for MI
and infarct size, respectively. Time-dependent changes of
hemodynamic variables are displayed as the mean plus or
minus the standard error of the mean (SEM) to improve
clarity. The median and its interquartile range as well as
scattered dot plots were used to describe and plot the results
for parameters of neurological or cardiac injury. Significant
differences between groups were analyzed using univariate analysis of variance and variance analysis for repeated
measurements with contrast analysis between consecutive
time points. Differences for RQ values relative to shamoperated animals were tested for significance using the
Wilcoxon signed-ranks test. We consider an RQ significant
when there is a minimum of a twofold change. P values
≤0.05 were considered statistically significant (SPSS Statistics 22, IBM, Ehningen, Germany).

Results
Of the 40 rats, 22 were randomized to the NaCl group and
18 to the levosimendan group. Ten animals in the control
group (45 %) and 5 in the levosimendan group (28 %) did
not survive 24 h after MCAO (P = 0.33). Within the surviving animals, there was no significant difference in the
occurrence of MI between groups (P = 0.16): In four animals from the control group (33.3 %) and in one from the
levosimendan group (7.7 %), sTnI levels exceeded 4.8 µg/L
(Fig.  1). Cumulative dosage of S-ketamine after induction was comparable in the NaCl (41.7 ± 21.7 mg) and
levosimendan groups (37.0 ± 21.4 mg). No SAH could be
detected on animals that survived.
Neurological injury
After forming additional groups according to MI, it could
be demonstrated that treatment with levosimendan significantly reduced only the cortical fraction of cerebral
infarction from 163 (45–162) mm3 to 74 (12–122) mm3
(P = 0.033). No effect on striatal or insular infarct volume
and edema was found (Fig. 2). Additionally, the infarcted

Logistic regression determined only insular infarct volume as a predictor of MI, not edema or striatal or cortical
infarct volume. Similarly, treatment with levosimendan
failed significance (Table 1).
Using ROC analysis, a threshold of ≥10 mm3 for
insular infarct volume could be defined to predict a significant MI with a sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of
80 % (AUC = 0.92, P  = 0.004). Thus, animals could be
classified into subgroups with large (≥10 mm3) or small
(<10 mm3) insular infarcts for further analysis of treatment
effects on the incidence of significant neuronal injury and
hemodynamics. Six out of 12 animals demonstrated large
insular infarcts in the control group (50 %), as did 3 out of
13 in the levosimendan group (23 %) (P = 0.226, Fig. 1).
Hemodynamic effects

infarct size: differences between groups for volumes of edema and

P values from ANOVA)

volume of the insular region was larger in animals with MI
(13.4, 10.8–15.4 mm3) in comparison with animals without
injury (7.0, 1.1–9.8 mm3).

13

The threshold values for insular infarct size were used for
additional grouping of hemodynamic parameters in order to
describe infarct size and levosimendan-dependent effects. HR
increased significantly over time (P  = 0.002), with no differences between groups. Contrast analysis demonstrated a
significant effect during early ischemia (10 min) and reperfusion (0 and 20 min). A significant decrease in MAP could be
observed 10 min after induction of ischemia (P = 0.001) and
immediately after reperfusion (P = 0.005). The effect of time
on MAP was different between animals with large or small
insular infarcts (P  = 0.014). This difference became obvious during reperfusion. Although MAP remains low in animals with large insular infarcts, a significant increase could
be measured in the other animals after 30 min (P = 0.009).
No effect of levosimendan could be demonstrated (Fig. 3).

Whereas LF/TP decreased significantly with the induction of
cerebral ischemia (P = 0.01), an increase could be observed
at reperfusion (P  = 0.04). Although this effect seemed to
be more pronounced in untreated animals with large insular infarcts, no significant differences between or within
groups could be detected. HF/TP decreased in all animals
over time (P < 0.001), especially immediately at reperfusion
(P = 0.047). Levosimendan or infarct size did not influence
the time course (Fig. 3).
Myocardial injury
To demonstrate the effects of levosimendan on MI independent of cerebral infarct size, a grouping for treatment
and insular infarct size was performed. Animals with large
insular infarcts were found to have significantly higher sTnI
values (P = 0.002), but levosimendan failed (P = 0.121) to
demonstrate an effect (Fig. 4).
An increased myocardial expression of genes related to
heart failure after MCAO could be detected only for BNP
(2.2-fold, P  = 0.001, Fig. 4). Following treatment with

levosimendan, CTGF expression was reduced by 1.6-fold
relative to vehicle-treated animals (P = 0.017, Fig. 4). No
differences between small and large insular infarcts or for
OPN could be detected (Table 2).
Of the calcium-handling genes, only the expression of
AdCy7 was down-regulated after MCAO by a factor of 1.2
(P  = 0.021). There were no differences detected between
groups for the expression of SERCA2 or RyR2 (Table 2).
Inflammatory markers in the myocardium were observed
to be regulated differently between groups. Whereas only
IL6 was significantly up-regulated (by 2.5-fold) after
MCAO (P = 0.007, Table 2), the expression of TNFα was
1.4-fold lower after levosimendan treatment (P  = 0.034)
and 1.3-fold lower in the myocardium of animals with large
insular infarcts (P  = 0.047) relative to vehicle treatment
and small insular infarcts, respectively (Fig. 4).

Discussion
Whereas previous studies demonstrated the neuro- and cardioprotective effects of levosimendan, this work illustrates
that the incidence and extent of MI after ischemic stroke
were influenced only by the degree of neurological injury
and not by levosimendan. Only the insular infarct volume
could be identified as a predictor of MI. Animals with
insular infarct volumes of ≥10 mm3 demonstrated higher
values of sTnI and lower MAP after cerebral ischemia.
Although levosimendan reduced cortical infarct volume,
it failed to influence the incidence and extent of MCAOtriggered MI. Whereas MCAO induced a significant MI in
20 % of the animals, the gene expression of different markers of cardiac injury remained normal or was only marginally up-regulated (BNP, IL6) after 24 h.

Although no significant effects of levosimendan could
be demonstrated, a trend toward a lower incidence of myocardial injuries (8 vs. 33 %) and larger insular infarcts (23
vs. 50 %) could be observed. The potential mechanisms of
action are assumed to involve a reduction of neurological

Table 2  Effect of levosimendan and insular infarct volume on relative quantity (RQ) of expression of osteopontin (OPN), sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2 (SERCA2), adenylate cyclase-7
(AdCy7), ryanodine receptor-2 (RyR2) and interleukin 6 (IL6) after

injury, reducing the risk for cardiac damage and a direct
protection of the heart against neurogenic stress.
As described previously, levosimendan was able to
reduce neuronal injury after transient ischemia (Katircioglu et al. 2008; Lafci et al. 2008; Hein et al. 2013). As this
effect was additionally dependent on the timing and extent
of reperfusion (Bleilevens et al. 2013) and no animals were
excluded related to cerebral perfusion profiles as in the associated investigation (Hein et al. 2013), the effect of levosimendan reached statistical significance on infarct size only
in the cortex in this analysis. Nevertheless, the involvement
of the insular cortex appeared to be crucial for subsequent
MI. The incidence and extent of structural and functional
cardiac compromise increased with progressive effects on
the left insular cortical region (Cheshire and Saper 2006;
Iltumur et al. 2006). Because the left insular cortex influences the sympathetic/parasympathetic balance, catecholamine surge and subsequent myocytolysis and cardiac dysfunction might be related to severe damage to this region
(Min et al. 2009). Indeed, insular infarct size was proven
to be a predictor of MI, and an increase in sympathetic and
decrease in parasympathetic tone could be observed during
reperfusion, as described previously (Cheung et al. 1997;
Dutsch et al. 2007). The continuous increase in HR is a consequence of this vegetative imbalance. Although HRV and
MAP were affected early during ischemia, relevant changes
occurred only during reperfusion, as demonstrated by a
significant effect of insular infarct size on MAP. The lower
blood pressure in animals with large insular infarcts during
reperfusion might indicate a persistent functional compromise. However, it should be mentioned that a lower blood
pressure during reperfusion might aggravate neurological
injury and thus trigger a vicious circle, although cerebral
blood flow as measured by laser Doppler flow was not significantly different between groups (data not shown).

Levosimendan failed to influence the insular infarct size
and thus the incidence and extent of MI and hemodynamic
responses. Although the insula might be part of the penumbra at the lower margin of the ischemic area, it remains
unclear why neuroprotection by levosimendan failed in
this region of the cortex. As described earlier, the largest
decrease in blood flow during MCAO could be observed
in the lower part of the frontoparietal cortex. This poorly
perfused region was more frequently infarcted when compared with other regions and was thus more susceptible to
ischemia, which could hardly be salvaged by reperfusion
or protected by pharmacological agents (Memezawa et al.
1992).
Furthermore, a direct action of levosimendan on the
myocardium, that is, cerebral infarct size independent,
should be possible. Previous studies have described distinct
regulation of genes related to calcium signaling, heart failure and inflammation in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Izumi
et al. 2009; Nef et al. 2009; Pirzer et al. 2012). Upregulation of heart-failure-related genes (BNP, CTGF, OPN),
differential regulation of the calcium-handling-related
genes, such as RyR2 (down), SERCA2 (down) and AdCy7
(up), and increased expression of IL6 have been described.
In this first report on experimental stroke-related cardiac
injury, significant at least twofold regulation could only be
detected after 24 h for BNP and IL6, although there were
differences between groups for CTGF and TNFα but not
calcium-handling-related genes. In theory, levosimendan
should influence the expression of genes related to inflammation, calcium handling and heart failure (Louhelainen
et al. 2009), but it fails to demonstrate relevant effects in
the current investigation.
This leads us to the following major limitation of this
study: It was an analysis to expand upon a prior investigation, it had insufficient power and important tests are
absent, particularly an analysis of cardiac function after
24 h. The irregular distribution of animals between groups
(only three large insular infarcts and one observed MI in
the levosimendan group) limits the analytical possibilities.
Thus, levosimendan failed to show significant effects on
outcome parameters, and further investigations are needed.
However, other important aspects of experimental stroke
research could be proven and should be highlighted: Cerebral injury might provoke MI, which will influence the outcome, if it is not monitored. Causes of death and elevated
serum levels of brain-specific acidic protein S-100β might
be misinterpreted. Levels of S-100β are related to infarct
size in myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (Cai et al.
2011) and correlated with TnI levels in the current investigation (R  = 0.673, P  = 0.001). Furthermore, retrospective analysis of rats subjected to MCAO (Bleilevens et al.
2013) under isoflurane anesthesia demonstrated a low incidence of myocardial injuries (1 out of 18). Thus, positive

155

effects on survival during isoflurane anesthesia compared
to S-ketamine might be related to fewer cardiac complications. Therefore, monitoring of cardiac function, continuous registration of blood pressure or ECG and immediately
autopsy in case of premature death should be proposed.
In conclusion, the current investigation proved the connection between the involvement of the insular cortex and
MI, but failed to provide evidence for the cardioprotective properties of levosimendan on stroke-induced MI.
This result might be related both to the fact that the insula
region could hardly be protected and to the low observable
MI early after MCAO. Further studies with higher power
are needed for a better judgment. Despite these limitations,
levosimendan may still be a promising drug for the treatment of stroke-related cardiomyopathy, with effects beyond
its reversal of hemodynamic compromise.
