Isoﬂavone formononetin is a typical phytoestrogen isolated from Chinese medical herb red clover. It has been reported that estrogens have neuroprotective properties, and dietary intake of phytoestrogens could reduce stroke
injury in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) animal models. In the present research, we sought to investigate the
molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of formononetin on I/R rats. Male Sprague–
Dawley rats were subjected to a 2 h period of right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24 h
of reperfusion. Then neurological deﬁcits and brain edema were evaluated. To provide insight into the functions
of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathway in
formononetin-induced neuroprotection, the expression of ER-α, Bax, Bcl-2, p-Akt (phosphorylated protein kinase B), and p-ERK1/2 (phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2) was determined by qPCR or
Western blot assay. Consequently, we found that formononetin has signiﬁcantly reduced the infarcted volume
and the brain water content, and improved the neurological deﬁcit. Formononetin also exhibited an upregulation
in ER-α and p-Akt, a downregulation in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. However, formononetin had little effect on p-ERK1/
2 proteins expression. Taken together, formononetin has shown neuroprotective effects in cerebral I/R rats, and
the molecular mechanisms may correlate with the downregulation of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the activation of
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

1. Introduction
Stroke refers to a sudden focal or global neurological impairment
that victims may suffer paralysis, speech disorder, as well as loss of consciousness due to either ischemia or hemorrhage. Stroke is considered
as one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide [1]. Nowadays, intravascular techniques and thrombolytic agents have remarkably decreased functional deﬁcits. Despite advances in treatment,
there is still little that can be done to prevent stroke-related brain damage. Thus, effective prevention and control of cerebral I/R injury is of
great clinical value.
Recently data from many investigations support the idea that estrogens provide neuroprotective effects in a variety of cerebral ischemia
animal models [2–4]. However, due to the undesirable side effects of estrogens, such as increased risk of breast and endometrial cancer and irregular bleeding, phytoestrogens have received considerable attention
as an alternative [5]. Phytoestrogens are estrogen-like molecules

which have been found widely in many natural products. Because of
their structural similarity with estrogen, phytoestrogens can produce
estrogenic or/and anti-estrogenic effects. They have the ability to selectively bind estrogen receptors (ERs) to regulate gene expression mediated by estrogen response elements [6]. Phytoestrogens have been
investigated intensively in recent years because of their potential protective effects against many diseases [7,8]. It has been demonstrated
that dietary intake of phytoestrogens could reduce stroke injury in animal model of focal and global cerebral ischemia [9–11]. However, it remains incomplete to understand the underlying protection mediated by
phytoestrogens from ischemic injury [12].
Formononetin (FN), isolated from Trifolium pratense L. (red clover),
is a bioactive isoﬂavonoid and is considered as a typical phytoestrogen. Red clover contains estrogen-like isoﬂavonoid that has been reported to relieve menopausal symptoms and be applied for various
medicinal purposes [13]. In addition, our previous ﬁndings indicated
that formononetin mediates the inhibitory proliferative and proapoptotic effects on cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo [14–17].
However, the information associated with formononetin-mimic estrogen effect on cerebral I/R remains unexplored. In the present study,
we investigated the potential beneﬁts of formononetin on cerebral I/
R rat, along with the underlying mechanisms.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Drug and animals
Formononetin (purity N 98%, veriﬁed by high performance liquid
chromatography; purchased from Phytomarker, China) was dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to make a 200 mM stock solution and
stored at 4 °C for further use. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (Grade II, No.
140222) of uniform age and weight (225–285 g) were obtained from
the Experimental Animal Center of Guangxi Medical University. All the
experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the
guidelines of the Experimental Research Institute of Guangxi Medical
University.
2.2. Focal cerebral I/R model
Rats were randomly divided into sham-operated group, I/R group, and
high-, medium- and low-dose of polysaccharides of the formononetin
(50, 25 and 12.5 mg·kg·d−1 respectively). The formononetin groups
were injected intraperitoneally with drugs for 14 days. 1 h after the last
administration, all rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate. A
nylon monoﬁlament with a round tip was inserted into the right common
external carotid artery and advanced into the internal carotid until a slight
resistance was felt. Such resistance indicated that the ﬁlament had
reached the circle of Willis, where the origin of the middle cerebral artery
was blocked. The rectal temperature was monitored and maintained at
37–38 °C with a heating lamp and heating pad. The room temperature
was controlled in the range of 25–27 °C throughout the experimental
procedure. After ischemia for 2 h, the ﬁlament was gently removed and
the animals were allowed to recover. For the sham-operated group, rats
underwent a neck dissection and surgical preparation of the external carotid artery, but not insertion of ﬁlament.
2.3. Neurological deﬁcit evaluation and measurement of infarct volume
After 2 h ischemia followed by 24 h reperfusion, rats were evaluated
for neurological deﬁcits using a 5-point scoring system according to the
previously described method [18]. Then the rats were anesthetized with
intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate (400 mg·kg−1). The
brains were carefully removed from skull and sliced to 2 mm thickness,
incubated in a 2% solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)
for 30 min at 37 °C. The infarct areas were photographed online, as previously depicted in detail [19]. Image analysis software (NIH Image, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Version 1.63) were used for the
measurement of the infarcted area.
2.4. Measurement of brain edema
Brain water content was measured by the standard wet–dry method. After 24 h reperfusion, rats were decapitated and brains were immediately removed. Each hemisphere was weighed (wet weight). The
tissue was then dried at 100 °C for 24 h to determine the dry weight.
The degree of brain edema was calculated by the following equation:
water content = (wet weight − dry weight) / wet weight × 100%.
2.5. qPCR
Total RNA was extracted from the ischemic regions of right cerebral
cortices using a Trizol reagent kit (Gibco-BRL, USA). The tissues were
collected and were quickly frozen. Then the tissues were transferred
into Trizol in a 1.5 mL tube for 15 min. Chloroform was added to the
tube, shaken vigorously and then incubated for 10 min. The reaction
tube was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. The upper portion
was transferred into another tube. An equal volume of isopropyl alcohol
was added, shaken and incubated for 10 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 12000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The RNA pellet was washed with

101

ice-cold 75% ethanol, and centrifuged at 7500 g for 5 min at 4 °C. The
RNA pellet was air-dried, then dissolved into RNase-free dH2O. RNA
was stored at −80 °C for further use. Total RNA was reverse transcribed
with the RevertAid™, First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, USA)
following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR and analysis of PCR
products were performed using the ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detector
(PE Applied Biosystems) as described in manufacturer's instructions.
Data were analyzed using a Ct cycle method (Bulletin, PE Applied
Biosystems). GAPDH served as an internal control, to the level of
which the amount of target mRNA was normalized.
2.6. Western blot analysis
The ischemic regions of right cerebral cortices (n = 3 per group)
were prepared in ice-cold lysis buffer. The lysates were centrifuged at
12000 g for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations in the resulting
supernatants were determined by Bio-Rad assay kit. Equal amounts of
protein (40 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto
0.22 μm polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad laboratories, USA). The membranes were blocked in TBST (Tris-buffered solution, pH 7.6, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dried milk.
Membranes were further incubated sequentially with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The following primary antibodies were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. After three washes, the blots were subsequently incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies (1:3000;
ZhongshanGlodenbridge Biotechnology Co, Beijing, China) coupled to
horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 1 h and then developed
in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) Western blot detection reagents
(Beyotime, China).
2.7. Statistics
Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. The Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 13.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL)
was used for statistical analyses including one-way ANOVA and
Student's t-test. A probability (p)-value b0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Formononetin improves the brain function and injured area in cerebral
I/R rats
Neurological deﬁcit was evaluated after MCAO. Consequently, obvious neurological deﬁcit was observed in the I/R group (Fig. 1), suggesting
that the MCAO model was successfully constructed. The neurological
deﬁcit was ameliorated in high or medium formononetin group as compared with I/R group.
Infarct tissue was visualized as an area of unstained part in I/R group,
in contrast to viable tissue, which is stained red, while there was no infract part in sham-operated group. As shown in Fig. 2, after treatment
with formononetin, the infarcted volume and the brain water content
were signiﬁcantly reduced as compared with I/R group (p b 0.01).
3.2. Effects of formononetin on ER-α, Bax and Bcl-2 expression in
cerebral I/R rats
In order to investigate formononetin-triggered apoptosis, we also
examined the mRNA and proteins expression of ER-α (Estrogen
receptor-α), Bcl-2 (B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2) and Bax (Bcl2-associated X protein). As shown in Fig. 3, the RT-PCR and Western blot results suggested that Bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels were gradually
increased following the formononetin administrations (12.5, 25, and
50 μM), while Bax expression was evidently reduced (p b 0.01). Moreover, the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in treated groups was obviously decreased

(p b 0.01). Formononetin also could enhance ER-α mRNA and protein
expression in a concentration-dependent manner.
3.3. Effects of formononetin on Akt, ERK protein expression in cerebral I/R
rats
To further analyze formononetin-induced neuroprotection, we performed the Western blot for Signaling pathways activated by ER in apoptotic regulation. As shown in Fig. 4, formononetin increased the
protein expression of p-Akt in a dose-dependent manner. However,
formononetin had little effect on p-ERK1/2 protein expression.
4. Discussion
Increasing evidences have suggested that estradiol and phytoestrogen exert neuroprotective effects in cerebral focal and global ischemia
by binding the classical estrogen receptors. However, the mechanisms
underlying these protective effects are still under investigation. In the
present study, formononetin, a typical phytoestrogen, has been shown
to improve the brain function and injured area in cerebral I/R rats.
Formononetin also exhibited an upregulation in ER-α and p-Akt, a

downregulation in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. However, formononetin had
little effect on p-ERK1/2 protein expression.
It has been reported that exogenous administration of 17β-estradiol
could reduce infarct volume following middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) in ovariectomized female rats [20]. One potential mechanism
for estradiol-induced neuroprotection is that it modulates expression
of genes involved in control of cell death and apoptosis, including
anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family proteins. Following recent clinical studies
suggesting possible negative health consequences of hormone therapy,
the use of phytoestrogens as a natural alternative to estrogen replacement after menopause has increased. Phytoestrogens have emerged as
a promising alternative means of cardiovascular neuroprotection.
Phytoestrogens regulate gene expression through interaction with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), which
are both expressed in the brain [21]. ERα and ERβ are principally localized in the nucleus of cells, but extra-nuclear localization has also been
found in the cytoplasm and membrane of cells. Both ERs have been
demonstrated to mediate nuclear receptor-signaling as well as nongenomic extranuclear signaling pathways in cells [22,23]. Activation of
nuclear ER leads to genomic signaling in which the expression of prosurvival/anti-apoptotic genes increased and pro-death/apoptotic genes
decreased. In contrast, activation of extra-nuclear ER is suggested to regulate correlative kinases and post-translationally modify other proteins'
activation to exert neuroprotective effects [24]. At present, the predominant view suggests that ER-α plays a primary role in mediating neuroprotection of estrogen and estrogen-like compounds against cerebral
ischemia [25,26]. ERs act as ligand-dependent nuclear transcription factors, and estradiol has been shown to regulate the expression of diverse
genes involved in neuroprotection including growth factors, and apoptotic and anti-apoptotic mediators. Recently, targets of estradiol action
have moved beyond classical nuclear signaling to involve an extensive
range of targets [4]. Estradiol has been proven to act on membrane associated ER, GPER (G protein-coupled estrogen receptor), interactions
with several signaling pathways including PI3K/Akt, MAPK/src, cAMP/
PKA/CREB, and growth factors [24,27–29]. These factors, in turn, regulate the activation or inactivation of cell survival and death.
There is evidence that PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways have been
linked to neuronal cell survival and/or cell death and been increasingly
researched in the ﬁeld of stroke. Akt activity is suggested to be upregulated by phosphorylation through the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases by growth factors. Akt is known to block apoptosis via the
phosphorylation of multiple downstream signaling molecules [30], including inactivation of the Bcl-2 family member Bad [31] and inhibition
of cell death pathway enzyme caspase-9 [32]. Further studies showed
that there existed cross-coupling between ER and PI3K [33]. Our ﬁndings conﬁrmed that formononetin induced phosphorylation of Akt

in vivo. However, ERK might play only a minor role in formononetin's
neuroprotection. Therefore, formononetin reduces neuronal damage
primarily via the Akt pathway, rather than the ERK pathway.
In conclusion, our studies indicate that formononetin has shown
neuroprotective effects in cerebral I/R rats. Formononetin has signiﬁcantly reduced the infarcted volume and the brain water content, and
improved the neurological deﬁcit. Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotection exhibited
by formononetin seem to involve, at least in part, estrogen receptor

activation, an upregulation p-Akt, and downregulation in the ratio of
Bax/Bcl-2 which leads to nerve cell proliferation. Additional investigations are needed to determine the detailed molecular targets mediating
the neuroprotective action of formononetin.
