Abstract Chemoattraction of leukocytes into the brain after
induction of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) increases
the lesion size and worsens disease outcome. Our previous
studies demonstrated that partial MHC class II constructs can
reverse this process. However, the potential application of
pMHC to human stroke is limited by the need to rapidly match
recipient MHC class II with the β1 domain of the pMHC
construct. We designed a novel recombinant protein comprised
of the HLA-DRα1 domain linked to MOG-35-55 peptide but
lacking the β1 domain found in pMHC and treated MCAO after
4 h reperfusion in humanized DR2 mice. Infarct volumes were
quantified after 96 h reperfusion and immune cells from the
periphery and CNS were evaluated for expression of CD74
and other cell surface, cytokine and pathway markers. This study
demonstrates that four daily treatments with DRα1-MOG-35-55

reduced infarct size by 40 % in the cortex, striatum and hemisphere, inhibited the migration of activated CD11b+CD45high
cells from the periphery to the brain and reversed splenic atrophy.
Furthermore, DRα1-MOG-35-55 bound to CD74 on monocytes
and blocked both binding and downstream signaling of macrophage migration inhibition factor (MIF) that may play a key role
in infarct development. The novel DRα1-MOG-35-55 construct
is highly therapeutic in experimental stroke and could be given to
all patients at least 4 h after stroke onset without the need for
tissue typing due to universal expression of DRα1 in humans.

Introduction
It has now been well established that experimental stroke triggers
inflammation in brain as well as rapid activation of the peripheral
immune system, resulting in migration of monocytes, neutrophils and T-cells across the blood–brain barrier into the growing
infarct and further activation of microglial cells (Gee et al. 2007;
Nilupul Perera et al. 2006; Wang et al. 1993). These infiltrating
cells contribute to ischemic damage through localized inflammation. The magnitude of the inflammatory response is strongly
associated with stroke outcome in patients (Emsley et al. 2005;
Smith et al. 2004). Furthermore, the peripheral immune system is
massively activated after cerebral ischemia. This vast activation
is followed by immunosuppression that is marked by atrophy of

38

the spleen and thymus (Offner et al. 2006a, b). Thus, immunotherapeutic approaches for treatment of ischemic stroke could
reduce the inflammatory milieu, target specific mechanisms of
the inflammatory pathway and maintain homeostasis of peripheral immunity.
Recombinant T-cell receptor ligand (RTL) molecules consist of the α1 and β1 domains of MHC class II molecules
expressed as a single polypeptide with or without antigenic
amino terminal extensions (Burrows et al. 1999; Vandenbark
et al. 2003). We previously demonstrated that RTL could
prevent and/or reverse clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and subsequently showed that
an RTL construct could effectively treat experimental stroke in
mice (Akiyoshi et al. 2011; Burrows et al. 1998, 2001; Huan
et al. 2004; Subramanian et al. 2009; Vandenbark et al. 2003).
We reported previously that treatment with RTL1000 that is
comprised of an HLA-DR2 moiety linked to human MOG35-55 peptide in humanized DR2 mice reduced infarct size
(Akiyoshi et al. 2011). Recently, we found that the RTL and
HLA-DRα1 domain directly binds to and downregulates the
cell surface expression of the MHC class II invariant chain
(CD74) on CD11b+ monocytes, and the RTL inhibit binding
of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) to CD74 and
blocks downstream inflammatory effects in the CNS
(Benedek et al. 2013; Vandenbark et al. 2013). We have
further demonstrated that the potency of the DRα1 domain
could be enhanced by addition of a peptide extension (MOG35-55 peptide) (Meza-Romero et. al. manuscript in preparation). Moreover, because the DRα1 domain is present in all
humans and thus would not be recognized as foreign, treatment using DRα1 constructs would not require HLA screening of potential recipients and could be used for treatment of
CNS diseases.
We demonstrate herein that DRα1-MOG-35-55 strongly
reduces infarct size and reverses splenic atrophy after stroke
when administered at a clinically relevant time-point; 4 h after
the onset of stroke, mediated in part by reduced expression of
the CD74 MIF cell surface receptor and migration of CD11b+
monocytes into the ischemic brain.

Materials and methods
Ethics statement The study was conducted in accordance with
National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of experimental animals, and the protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees at Oregon Health & Science
University and the Portland Veteran Affairs Medical Center.
Animals All experiments used age-matched, sexually mature
(20 to 25 g) male HLA-DRB1*1502 (DR2-Tg) mice produced by Dr. Chella David (Gonzalez-Gay et al. 1996). The
mice were housed and bred at the Veterans Affairs Medical

Metab Brain Dis (2014) 29:37–45

Center, and studies were conducted at Oregon Health &
Science University.
HLA-DRα1-MOG-35-55 cloning, production and
purification DRα1-MOG-35-55 domain cloning, production
and purification have been described elsewhere (MezaRomero et. al. manuscript in preparation). Briefly, DRα1MOG-35-55 was constructed using the DRα1 construct as a
template. The mouse MOG (35–55) peptide DNA encoding
sequence was attached to the N-terminus of the DRα1 domain
with a linker-thrombin-linker intervening element.
Treatment with DRα1-MOG-35-55 Mice were randomized to
receive 0.1 ml (500 μg) DRα1-MOG-35-55 or 0.1 ml Vehicle
(5 % dextrose in Tris–HCl, pH 8.5) by subcutaneous injection
4 h after the onset of reperfusion followed by similar doses at
24, 48, and 72 h of reperfusion for a total of 4 treatments each
of DRα1-MOG-35-55 or Vehicle. Both DRα1-MOG-35-55
and Vehicle treated MCAO mice were euthanized at the 96 h
time-point for evaluation of tissues and cells.
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in male DR2-Tg mice for 1 h by
reversible right MCAO under isoflurane anesthesia followed
by 96 h of reperfusion, as described previously with slight
modifications (Offner et al. 2006a). Head and body temperature were controlled at 36.5±0.5 °C throughout MCAO surgery with warm water pads and a heating lamp. Laser-Doppler
flowmetry (LDF; Model DRT4, Moor Instruments Ltd., Oxford, England) was monitored throughout the ischemic period
with a LDF probe affixed to the skull to ensure effective
occlusion and reperfusion. The common carotid artery was
exposed and the external carotid artery was ligated and cauterized. Unilateral MCAO was accomplished by inserting a 6–
0 nylon monofilament surgical suture (ETHICON, Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA) with a heat-rounded and silicone-coated
(Xantopren comfort light, Heraeus, Germany) tip into the
internal carotid artery via the external carotid artery stump.
Animals were excluded if mean intra-ischemic LDF was
greater than 30 % pre-ischemic baseline. At 1 h of occlusion,
the occluding filament was withdrawn to allow for reperfusion. Mice were then allowed to recover from anesthesia and
survived for 96 h following initiation of reperfusion.
Determination of infarct size The brains were harvested after
96 h of reperfusion and sliced into four 2-mm-thick coronal
sections for staining with 1.2 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in saline as
described previously (Hurn et al. 2007). The 2-mm brain
sections were incubated in 1.2 % TTC for 15 min at 37 °C,
and then fixed in 10 % formalin for 24 h. Infarct volume was
measured using digital image analysis software (Systat, Inc.,
Point Richmond, CA, USA). To control for edema, infarct

Metab Brain Dis (2014) 29:37–45

volume (cortex, striatum, and hemisphere) was calculated by
subtraction of the ipsilateral non-infarcted regional volume
from the contralateral regional volume. This value was then
divided by the contralateral regional volume and multiplied by
100 to yield regional infarct volume as a percent of the contralateral region.
Leukocyte isolation from brain and spleen Spleens from
MCAO-treated mice were removed and a single-cell suspension was prepared by passing the tissue through a 100 μm
nylon mesh (BD Falcon, Bedford, MA). The cells were washed
using RPMI 1640 and the red cells lysed using 1× red cell lysis
buffer (eBioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA) and incubated for
3 min. The cells were then washed twice with RPMI 1640,
counted and resuspended in stimulation medium (RPMI, containing 2 % FBS, 1 % sodium pyruvate, 1 % L-glutamine,
0.4 % βME). The brain was divided into the ischemic (right)
and nonischemic (left) hemispheres, digested for 60 min with
1 mg/ml Type IV collagenase (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)
and DNase I (50 mg/ml, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN)
at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Samples were mixed every
15 min. The suspension was washed 1× in RPMI, resuspended
in 80 % Percoll overlayed with 40 % Percoll and centrifuged for
30 min at 1600 RPM. The cells were then washed twice with
RPMI 1640, counted and resuspended in staining medium.
Flow cytometry All antibodies were purchased (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA or eBioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA) as
published. Four-color (FITC, PE, APC and PerCP) fluorescence flow cytometry analyses were performed to determine
the phenotypes of cells following standard antibody staining
procedures. One million cells were washed with staining
medium (PBS containing 0.1 % NaN3 and 1 % bovine serum
albumin (Sigma, Illinois) and incubated with combinations of
the following monoclonal antibodies: CD80 (16-10A1),
HLA-DR (TU39), CD11b (MAC-1), CD74 (In-1), CD45
(Ly-5), CD62L (MEL14), ICAM-1 (3B2), and CD44 (IM7),
CCR2 (475301), CD4 (GK1.5) for 20 min at 4 °C. Propidium
iodide was added to identify dead cells. Data were collected
with CELLQUEST (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and FCS
EXPRESS (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, CA) software
on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences).
Intracellular staining for TNF-α Splenocytes were resuspended
(2×106 cells/ml) in stimulation media (RPMI 1640 media
containing 2 % FCS, 1 mM pyruvate, 200 μg/ml penicillin,
200 U/ml streptomycin, 4 mM L-Glutamine, and 5×10−5 M
2-β-ME with PMA [50 ng/ml], ionomycin [500 ng/ml], and
Brefeldin A [10 μg/ml] [all reagents from BD Bioscience]) for
4 h. Fc receptors were blocked with mouse Fc receptor-specific
mAb (2.3 G2; BD PharMingen) before cell-surface staining and
then fixed and permeabilized using a Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD
Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

39

Permeabilized cells were washed with 1×Permeabilization Buffer (BD Bioscience) and stained with either PE-conjugated
TNF-α (MP6-XT22) or Isotype matched mAb that served as a
negative control. Data were collected with CELLQUEST (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and FCS EXPRESS (De Novo
Software, Los Angeles, CA) software on a FACSCalibur (BD
Biosciences).
Real time PCR Splenocytes or brain cells were isolated from
DR*1502-Tg mice. Total RNA was isolated from cells using an
RNeasy cultured cell kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Quantitative real time PCR
was performed using the ABI7000 sequence detection system
with gene-on-demand assay products (Applied Biosystems) for
TaqMan array mouse immune response or for IL-4 (Assay ID:
Mm00445259_m1), ACE (Assay ID: Mm00802048_m1) and
CCL3 (Assay ID: Mm00441249_g1). GAPDH housekeeping
gene was amplified as an endogenous control. Primers were used
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analysis Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical differences in cortical, striatal, and total (hemispheric) infarct volume, as well as spleen and brain cell counts and percentages of cellular subtypes from FACS analyses were determined by Student’s t-test. Statistical significance was p <0.05.

Results
DRα1-MOG-35-55 treatment significantly reduces infarct size
after MCAO in DR2-Tg mice Evaluation of brain infarcts 96 h
after MCAO demonstrated that DRα1-MOG-35-55-treated
male DR2-Tg mice had significantly reduced infarct volumes
compared with the Vehicle-treated group as shown in Fig. 1a.
Cortical infarct volume was 25.9±4.67 % in DRα1-MOG-3555 -treated compared to 47.0±2.5 % in vehicle-treated mice
(p <0.01). Similarly, striatal infarct volume was 40.8±5.4 %
vs. 64.5±2.0 % respectively in DRα1-MOG-35-55-treated vs.
Vehicle-treated mice (p <0.01), whereas the total hemispheric
infarct volume was 19.4±3.6 % vs. 31.1±1.71 %, respectively
(p <0.01). Quantitative assay of TTC stained cerebral sections
after 96 h of reperfusion illustrated the smaller infarct area in
DRα1-MOG-35-55-treated mice compared with Vehicletreated mice (Fig. 1b). There were no significant differences
in laser-Doppler perfusion before, during or immediately after
MCAO between DRα1-MOG-35-55-treated and Vehicletreated groups (data not shown).

Representative 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride stained cerebral sections after 96 h of reperfusion following 1 h of MCAO

due to diminished number of infiltrating inflammatory cells in
the brain after MCAO. DRα1-MOG-35-55 treatment significantly reduced the absolute number of mononuclear cells in
the right ischemic brain compared with Vehicle-treated mice
(13.14×104 vs. 21.33×104 respectively, p <0.05) (Fig. 2a).
This difference is attributed mainly to the reduction in the
number of activated CD11b+CD45high monocytic cells (4.7×
104 vs. 11.85×104 respectively, p <0.01). There were no
significant differences in the absolute numbers of the CD4+
T cells or the resting microglia (CD11b+CD45low) (Fig. 2b). In
the non-ischemic left brain there were no differences in the
total absolute number of mononuclear cells or in any cell type
(Supplemental Fig. 1).
Previously, it was demonstrated that DRα1 treatment of
EAE also leads to reduction of activated CD11b+ cells in the
Central Nervous System (CNS) and that DRα1 reduces the cell
surface expression of the MIF receptor, CD74, on the activated
CD11b+ cells. In order to determine if DRα1-MOG-35-55
treatment has the same effect in MCAO, expression of CD74
cell surface levels was evaluated on CD11b+CD45high cells. As
shown in Fig. 2c, there was a significant reduction in the level
of CD74 expression as measured by the Mean Fluorescent
Intensity (MFI) in the DRα1-MOG-35-55 -treated mice compared with the Vehicle-treated mice (p <0.01). Taken together,
these results demonstrate that DRα1-MOG-35-55 can reduce
the number of activated microglia and infiltrating monocytes in
the ischemic brain and affect the expression of CD74 on the
surface of these cells.

levels of the DRα1-MOG-35-55-treated sample was analyzed
relative to the Vehicle-treated sample (Fig. 3). Validation of 3
genes: IL-4, CCL3 and ACE, using individual samples, demonstrated that the expression trends were the same as in the
immune array, although not all of the genes showed a significant difference (Supplemental Fig. 2). The immune array data
demonstrate that there was a decrease in the expression of
monocyte-related genes such as CCL3, CCL2 and increases in
Th1 and Th2 related genes such as IL-12, Tbx21, IL-4 and IL13. It is important to note that several genes that were associated previously with cerebrovacular function and ischemic
brain injury, including ACE and EDN1, were down regulated
after DRα1-MOG-35-55 treatment relative to Vehicle
treatment.

DRα1-MOG-35-55 treatment affects the immune gene expression profile in the ischemic brain after MCAO In order to
assess the DRα1-MOG-35-55 treatment effect on the expression of immune related genes in brain, mRNA was isolated
from the ischemic brains of 3 Vehicle-treated mice and 3
DRα1-MOG-35-55 -treated mice. A real-time PCR assay
was performed on pooled cDNA samples and expression

DRα1-MOG-35-55 treatment reverses MCAO-Induced splenic atrophy To evaluate the effects of DRα1-MOG-35-55 treatment on stroke-induced splenic atrophy, cell numbers in the
spleen were counted in post-ischemic Vehicle- and DRα1MOG-35-55-treated mice. As expected, MCAO induced a
significant decrease in spleen numbers in the Vehicle-treated
group (Fig. 4a). Interestingly, viable cell counts were significantly increased in spleens of DRα1-MOG-35-55-treated versus Vehicle-treated mice (64.67×106 vs. 32.11×106 respectively, p <0.01) 96 h after reperfusion. The increase in spleen
cell numbers was reflected in the absolute numbers of CD11b+
cells (p <0.01) and CD4+ cells (p <0.05) (Fig. 4b). Although
DRα1-MOG-35-55 treatment increased the cell numbers in
the spleen, it reduced the frequency of CD4+ cells and did not
change the frequency of the CD11b+ cells in the spleen
(Fig. 4c).

no differences in the level of expression of CD80, ICAM-1,
HLA-DR and CCR2 on CD11b+ cells between DRα1-MOG35-55-versus Vehicle-treated mice. Evaluation of CD4+ activation by the expression of CD44 and CD62L revealed that
the frequency of both CD62L low and high activated CD4+
cells in the spleen were increased after treatment with DRα1MOG-35-55 compared with Vehicle (p <0.05 for both). In
addition, spleen cells from DRα1-MOG-35-55- or Vehicletreated mice were stimulated with PMA/Ionomycine for 4 h
and evaluated by flow cytometry for intracellular staining of

TNF-α. There was no difference in production of TNF-α by
CD4+ or CD11b+ cells in spleens from DRα1-MOG-35-55- or
Vehicle-treated mice (Supplemental Fig. 3).

55-treated mice were analyzed relative to the Vehicle-treated
mice (Fig. 6). The expression levels of 3 genes: IL-4, CCL3
and ACE were validated using individual samples (Supplemental Fig. 4). Interestingly, the expression of several of the genes in
the spleen, such as CCL3, IL-4, Stat6, ACE, FN1 and C3) had an
opposite trend compared with their expression in the brain after
DRα1-MOG-35-55 treatment. In addition, the expression of
monocyte related genes, such as CD68, were increased in the
spleen of DRα1-MOG-35-55-treated mice relative to Vehicletreated mice. These expression results are in correlation to the
absolute numbers of cells in the spleen.

Discussion
Our study demonstrates for the first time that treatment with
DRα1-MOG-35-55 after onset of MCAO reduces infract size,
inhibits infiltration of activated monocytes into the ischemic
brain and reverses splenic atrophy, which is typically induced
after MCAO. We have previously demonstrated that partial
MHC class II constructs which are comprised of the linked
β1α1 domains tethered to antigenic peptides, could treat CNS
diseases such as experimental stroke and EAE (Akiyoshi et al.
2011; Sinha et al. 2009, 2007; Subramanian et al. 2009).

However, the novel DRα1-MOG-35-55 construct represents
an improved immunotherapy which would not require HLA
screening prior to use. In contrast to RTL1000, in which the
MOG peptide is linked to the DR2β1 domain and thus can be
given only to HLA-DR2 matched subjects, the MOG peptide
in the new construct is linked to the DRα1 domain. Hence, the
lack of the polymorphic β1 domain and the fact that the DRα1
domain is invariable and thus universally tolerogenic enables
its use without pre-screening for HLA genotype.
We have recently shown that DRα1-MOG-35-55 binds to
and down-regulates CD74 on CD11b+ cells. This binding has
a bi-functional inhibitory effect on MIF/CD74 interactions
and blocks downstream MIF effects in the CNS during EAE
(Meza-Romero et. al. manuscript in preparation). In addition,
we have demonstrated the RTL can inhibit MIF binding to
CD74 (Benedek et al. 2013). However, it is not yet clear
whether the treatment effect of DRα1-MOG-35-55 in MCAO
is MIF dependent, MIF independent or both. In the literature,
the contribution of MIF to the outcome of MCAO is controversial and one report even indicates that deletion of MIF
worsens MCAO in females (Inacio et al. 2011a, b, c; Turtzo
et al. 2013), suggesting a protective effect. It is thus important
to note that the parent RTL1000 construct can treat MCAO in
both male and female mice ((Akiyoshi et al. 2011) and HO
unpublished data). Assuming similar mechanisms with
RTL1000, the DRα1-MOG-35-55 treatment might thus have
a MIF independent effect, at least in female mice, either via
the tethered MOG-35-55 peptide or by reduction of CD74
surface expression on activated CD11b+ cells. Consistent with
this line of reasoning, Fan et. al. demonstrated that macrophages from CD74 KO mice showed increased random migration compared with WT macrophages, while the random
migration levels of MIF KO and WT macrophages did not
differ (Fan et al. 2011). This result would suggest a MIFindependent role of CD74 on macrophage migration that
might also be affected by DRα1-MOG-35-55.

The infiltration of inflammatory cells into the brain after
MCAO was reported in detail previously and it was shown that
of the activated cells in the brain the predominant population is
macrophages/activated microglial cells (both cell types are
CD11b+CD45high in inflamed CNS) (Stevens et al. 2002;
Subramanian et al. 2009). Our results clearly demonstrate that
DRα1-MOG-35-55 treatment reduces the infarct volume and
the number and frequency of CD11b+CD45high cells in the
ischemic brain. This result is very similar to the previously
described effect of RTLs in blocking activation of resident
microglia and cellular infiltration into the CNS during EAE
and MCAO (Benedek et al. 2013; Subramanian et al. 2009).
The gene expression profile of immune related genes in the
brain of DRα1-MOG-35-55-treated relative to Vehicle-treated
mice was concurrent with the reduction of activated CD11b+
cells in the ischemic brain 96 h after MCAO. Interestingly,
several genes that were shown to be involved in the induction
and outcome of stroke, such as Endothelin 1 (EDN1) (Ziv et al.
1992) and Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) were down
regulated (Yusuf et al. 2000) at this time point. It is also
important to note that up-regulated genes such as CXCL10,
CXCR3 and CCR7 in DRα1-MOG-35-55-treated vs. Vehicle
MCAO mice could reflect a lesser degree of MCAO-induced
immunosuppression (similar to sham-treated vs. untreated
MCAO mice) at 96 h(Offner et al. 2006b). Thus, treatment
with DRα1-MOG-35-55 is directly affecting the number of
infiltrating cells, mainly monocytes, into the brain and in
addition is restoring immune homeostasis to the ischemic brain.
The effects of cerebral damage from stroke on the peripheral
immune system are profound (Offner et al. 2006a, b; Seifert
et al. 2012). This drastic loss of cell numbers in the spleen 96 h
after MCAO induction was largely reversed after DRα1-MOG35-55 treatment. The absolute numbers of CD11b+ and CD4+
cells as well as total splenocytes were significantly increased.
We also observed that DRα1-MOG-35-55 treatment did not
alter the frequency of CD11b+ cells or their activation state. As

for the CD4+ cells, although the frequency of these cells was
reduced in the spleen after DRα1-MOG-35-55 treatment, the
frequency of the activated CD4+ cells was significantly higher
suggesting that the activated cells are retained in the spleen.
The gene expression profile of the spleen from DRα1-MOG35-55-treated mice relative to Vehicle-treated mice was almost a
mirror image to the expression in the ischemic brain. Taken
together, these data suggest that the DRα1-MOG-35-55 mechanism of action in stroke involves alteration of the migration
patterns of activated cells in the periphery. Down regulation of
CD74 on activated CD11b+ cells by DRα1-MOG-35-55 could
induce random migration or inhibit chemotactic migration of
these cells, as was shown in CD74 deficient macrophages or by
down regulation of CD74 cell surface expression by RTLs.
In summary, our study demonstrates that four daily treatments with DRα1-MOG-35-555 beginning 4 h after MCAO
reduces the migration of activated cells from spleen to brain,
thus contributing to a reduction in infarct size. This immunomodulatory agent might thus represent the next generation of
partial MHC class II constructs with therapeutic activity for
CNS diseases. Further studies are underway to determine how
long after MCAO DRα1-MOG-35-55 is effective and what is
the minimal effective dose that can be given.
