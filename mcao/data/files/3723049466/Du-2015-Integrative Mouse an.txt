Background and Purpose—The extent of ischemic injury in response to cerebral ischemia is known to be affected by native
vasculature. However, the nonvascular and dynamic vascular responses and their genetic basis are not well understood.
Methods—We performed a genome-wide association study in 235 mice from 33 inbred strains using the middle cerebral
artery occlusion model. Population structure and genetic relatedness were accounted for using the efficient mixed-model
association method. Human orthologs to the genes associated with the significant and suggestive single-nucleotide
polymorphisms from the mouse strain survey were examined in patients with M1 occlusions admitted with signs and
symptoms of acute ischemic stroke.
Results—We identified 4 genome-wide significant and suggestive single-nucleotide polymorphisms to be associated with
infarct volume in mice (rs3694965, P=2.17×10–7; rs31924033, P=5.61×10–6; rs32249495, P=2.08×10–7; and rs3677406,
P=9.56×10–6). rs32249495, which corresponds to angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1), was also significant in the recessive model
in humans, whereas rs1944577, which corresponds to ZBTB7C, was nominally significant in both the additive and
dominant genetic models in humans. ZBTB7C was shown to be upregulated in endothelial cells using both in vitro and
in vivo models of ischemia.
Conclusions—Genetic variations of ANGPT1 and ZBTB7C are associated with increased infarct size in both mice and
humans. ZBTB7C may modulate the ischemic response via neuronal apoptosis and dynamic collateralization and, in
addition to ANGPT1, may serve as potential novel targets for treatments of cerebral ischemia.   (Stroke. 2015;46:35143522. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.010767.)

erebral ischemia remains a major public health concern
with >20 million strokes occurring annually worldwide,1
making it the third leading cause of death2 and the leading
cause of adult disability.1 It is widely accepted that the extent
of cerebral infarction after an ischemic insult is dependent on
the degree of vascular collateralization. The contribution of the
native vasculature to infarct volume has been shown in rodent
models where different strains of mice exhibit different degrees
of cerebral infarction after occlusion of the middle cerebral
artery.3 Investigation in a few strains of mice showed that the
completeness of the circle of Willis, particularly the presence

of the P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery, contributes
to the degree of cerebral perfusion and infarct size after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery.4,5 It has also been shown
that native pial collaterals contribute to infarct size.6 However,
there are other factors beyond native vasculature that modulate
ischemic damage. One of the other components is the dynamic
remodeling of the vasculature that occurs with ischemic injury.7
More recently, it has been shown that differences in infarct volume in different mouse strains using the distal middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) model are associated with genetic
variation in integrin α-L that is independent of the effects of

collaterals.8,9 In this study, we used the proximal MCAO model
in 235 mice from 33 inbred strains to examine the genetic basis
of the ischemic response. We have demonstrated in the mice
examined that large vessel anatomy is not significantly correlated with infarct size. By integrating the strain survey results
with human data, we identified ANGPT1 and ZBTB7C as susceptibility genes for ischemic injury.

Methods
MCAO Model

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

Thirty-three inbred strains of mice were obtained from the Jackson
Laboratory (Table 1). The permanent MCAO model was performed
on 5 to 25 mice for each strain (total 235 mice) in a random order.
Eight- to 10-week-old male mice (14–45 g) were used for the MCAO
model. The MCAO model was performed as described previously10
and detailed in the online-only Data Supplement. The number of mice
excluded for each strain because of unsuccessful surgery or death is
shown in Table I in the online-only Data Supplement. Physiological
parameters for each strain of mice are detailed in Table II in the
online-only Data Supplement. All animal housing, care, and experiments were performed according to the guidelines and regulations of
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
The brain was dissected into 1-mm coronal sections using a brain
matrix and incubated in 2% triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) at room temperature for 15 minutes. The total infarct
volume was calculated by summing the infarct area across all slices
by an investigator blinded to the genetics data at the time of measurement. The indirect Swanson method11 was used where the infarct
ratio was defined as (contralateral volume−ipsilateral noninfarcted
volume)/contralateral volume.

Assessment of Circle of Willis
The circle of Willis was visualized using India ink perfusion as described previously12 and in the online-only Data Supplement. This
was performed in 13 strains of mice: 129S1/SvImJ, A/J, BALB/cJ,
BTBR T+ tf/J, C57BL/10J, C57BL/6J, C57BLKS/J, C57L/J, DBA2/J,
KK/HlJ, NOD/LtJ, P/J, and SWR/J. Four to 7 animals were used for
each strain. The ratio of the diameter of the left P1 segment of the
PCA to the diameter of the ICA at its bifurcation was measured using
ImageJ 1.43 (National Institutes of Health).

of acute ischemic stroke, who had only M1 occlusions, and who
were genotyped, were included to achieve a similar phenotype to the
murine MCAO model. Thirty-three patients fit the inclusion criteria. Of those, 12 were women, and 21 were men. Twenty-three head
computed tomographies (CTs) and 10 magnetic resonance imagings
were performed on admission, before any thrombolytic therapy.
The human portion of this study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board.
CT and CT angiography (CTA), and magnetic resonance imaging were performed on admission based on routine clinical stroke
work-up and clinical requirements. For the purposes of this study,
magnetic resonance imaging diffusion-weighted imaging performed
at admission within 24 hours of symptom onset was used to assess
the baseline infarct volume. All CT/CTAs used were performed at
admission before thrombolytic treatment. Routine CTA imaging
protocols for the diagnosis of large vessel occlusions adopted in
the Screening Technology and Outcome Project in Stroke (STOPStroke) study was used and are reported elsewhere.18 Patients who
underwent at least a CT/CTA or magnetic resonance imaging before
thrombolytic therapy with an occlusion of the M1 division of the
MCA were included. All lesion volumes were corrected for differences in overall brain size using midsagittal cross-sectional intracranial area as a surrogate measure of the intracranial volume.19 All
volumetric data were measured using a validated semiautomated
protocol.20 The intraclass correlation coefficient for the volumetric
lesion analysis was 0.99 for diffusion-weighted imaging volume.21
Imaging analyses were performed by an experienced and trained
neurologist blinded to clinical and genetic data.
The Illumina Quad610 Beadchip and Affymetrix Human SNP
Array 6.0 were used for genotyping. PLINK22 was used to exclude
SNPs that failed the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test (P<0.001),
had minor allele frequency <1%, and had >5% of missing data.
Additional SNPs were excluded using the linkage disequilibrium–
based SNP pruning procedure in PLINK with a window size of 50,
step of 5, and r2 threshold of 0.5. The SNPs from the candidate genes
were then extracted from the pruned set and analyzed.
A linear model was used to perform the association study using R with the normalized infarct volume as the phenotype and age,
sex, genotyping platform, and imaging modality as covariates. The
additive, dominant, and recessive genetic models were evaluated.
Adjustment for multiple testing was performed using the Benjamini
and Hochberg correction.15

Genome-Wide Association Analysis

Oxygen Glucose Deprivation

Genome-wide association mapping, with infarct ratio as the phenotype, was performed on the 33 inbred strains of mice using the
R package, emma, where the efficient mixed-model association
method was used to adjust for population structure and genetic
relatedness in inbred mice.13 The Broad mouse HapMap SNP sets
containing 132 285 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) were
used (http://www.broadinstitute.org/mouse/hapmap/,http://mouse.
cs.ucla.edu/mousehapmap/emma.html). Using the R package nortest,14 the Anderson–Darling test of normality was used to evaluate
normality of the infarct ratios. The P values were corrected for multiple testing by the Benjamini and Hochberg15 false discovery rate
algorithm (referred to as Q value). SNPs with P<10–5 were considered suggestive.
Associated genes were obtained within 500 kbp of each SNP
from MGI Mart using the NCBIM37 data set (http://biomart.informatics.jax.org). The rationale for this size window is to ensure that
regulatory SNPs are included because most enhancers and repressors occur <500 kbp away from the gene.16 Corresponding human
orthologs of each gene were also obtained using MGI Mart. SNPs
within each human gene were then obtained using the biomaRt
package in R.17

Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis

Consecutive white patients, who were admitted to the Massachusetts
General Hospital emergency department with signs and symptoms

Ischemic conditions were modeled in vitro using the oxygen glucose
deprivation (OGD) model as previously described23 on murine brain
endothelial cell line (bEnd.3) derived from BALB/c mice and human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (online-only Data Supplement). OGD
is performed overnight (at least 16 hours). Cells were harvested immediately after termination of OGD. Three sets of experiments were
performed for each cell type for a total of 6 control and 10 OGD
cultures for murine endothelial cell lines and 6 control and 9 OGD
cultures for human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed as described previously24 and detailed in the online-only Data
Supplement to determine expression of ZBTB7C. Relative gene expression was determined using the 2−ΔΔC method and assessed by the
t test.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described25 (see
online-only Data Supplement for details). The following primary
antibodies and dilutions were used: ZBTB7C (1:50, rabbit polyclonal, Abcam, Cambridge, MA); NeuN (1:200, mouse monoclonal, Abcam); GFAP (1:200, mouse monoclonal, Abcam); and CD31
(1:100, rat monoclonal, BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA). Fluorescent

secondary antibodies, AlexaFluor488 or AlexaFluor594 (1:500 for
ZBTB7C and 1:200 for all others, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR),
were used.

Quantification of Staining
For quantification of ZBTB7C staining, we selected 5 random fields
from the cortex on coronal sections of each of 3 MCAO and 3 control SWR/J mice. The ratio of ZBTB7C+NeuN+, ZBTB7C+CD31+,
and ZBTB7C+GFAP+ cells to NeuN+, CD31+, and GFAP+ cells
was obtained to determine the fraction of ZBTB7C+ neurons, endothelial cells, and astrocytes, respectively. Differences in the proportions of ZBTB7C+ cells in each cell type were assessed using the
t test.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank
test, Welch t test, and linear regression in R (version 3.0.2). P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. In the cases of
genome-wide association testing, Q values <0.05 were considered
genome-wide significant.

Identification of Candidate Genes for Susceptibility
to Ischemic Injury in Inbred Mice
The infarct ratios for 33 inbred strains of mice measured 24
hours after MCAO are shown in Figure 1. The infarct ratios
ranged from 0.40 to 0.78. The Anderson–Darling test of normality demonstrated that the infarct ratio is approximately
normally distributed (P=0.16). There was no association
between age, weight, and mean arterial pressure with infarct
ratio (P>0.05).
Completeness of the Circle of Willis
We examined the circle of Willis in 13 strains of mice
with infarct ratios ranging from 0.40 to 0.78 to capture the
full range of infarct ratios. In particular, we examined the
ratio of left P1 diameter to left ICA diameter (Figure 1).
The left P1 was chosen because we performed a left
MCAO model, but the results are similar for the right P1.
Pearson’s correlation between the infarct ratio and the left
P1/ICA ratio was 0.049 (P=0.88). There was therefore no
apparent correlation between infarct ratio and completeness of the circle of Willis in the strains examined. The
proximal MCAO model could therefore be used without
significant confounding by variations of the circle of
Willis. This also avoids the problem of branch selection
in a distal MCAO model.
Genome-Wide Association Testing
Using the efficient mixed-model association to account
for population stratification among inbred strains of mice,
we found 2 genome-wide significant SNPs (rs32249495,
P=2.02×10–7 and rs3694965, P=2.05×10–7) and 2 suggestive
SNPs with P<10–5 (rs31924033, P=5.50×10–6 and rs3677406,
P=9.31×10–6; Figure 1; Table 2).

Association of ZBTB7C Polymorphisms in Human
Data Set
There were 38 genes within 500 kbp of the 4 significant and
suggestive mouse SNPs (Figure 2). These genes were associated with 24 human orthologs. The 24 human genes contain
36 179 SNPs, 99 of which were common among the included
ischemic stroke data sets. Among 33 white subjects with M1
occlusions, the acute infarct volumes ranged from 1.2 to 249.2
cm3 (Figure 2). The 99 SNPs common to the ischemic stroke
data sets that correspond to the 24 human orthologs were
examined for association with infarct volume in patients with
M1 occlusions (Figure 2; Table 3). The additive genetic model
yielded 4 nominally significant SNPs (rs1944577, P=0.011;
rs2514830, P=0.015; rs8043555, P=0.020; and rs11074858,
P=0.046) corresponding to the genes ZBTB7C, RSPO2,
KIAA0556, and IL21R, respectively. The dominant model
yielded 5 nominally significant SNPs (rs1944577, P=0.006;
rs8043555, P=0.020; rs11639671, P=0.040; rs11074858,
P=0.042; and rs1489169, P=0.046) corresponding to the
genes ZBTB7C, KIAA0556, GSG1L, IL21R, and ZBTB7C,
respectively. The recessive model yielded 7 nominally significant SNPs (rs1283687, P=3.94×10–4; rs10163610, P=0.008;
rs2514830, P=0.021; rs3091235, P=0.026; rs2189521,
P=0.032; rs12934152, P=0.036; and rs1000031, P=0.046)

corresponding to the genes ANGPT1, ZBTB7C, RSPO2,
IL21R, IL21R, IL21R, and CTIF, respectively. ANGPT1
(angiopoietin-1) remained significant in the recessive model
after adjustment for multiple testing (Q=0.039), whereas the
others did not.

ZBTB7C Expression Is Increased in Endothelial
Cells After Ischemia
As ANGPT1 has been well studied in the context of cerebral
ischemia, we proceeded to further characterize ZBTB7C.
Analysis of Gene Expression Omnibus data sets, GSE26500
and GSE26844, did not demonstrate a difference in baseline expression of ZBTB7C (online-only Data Supplement)
across strains. This suggests that the difference in expression
of ZBTB7C may occur in the ischemic or hypoxic setting

rather than at baseline. We thus investigated the expression
of ZBTB7C under ischemic/hypoxic conditions using the in
vivo MCAO model and the in vitro OGD model. ZBTB7C
expression in the MCAO model was performed using SWR/J
and DBA2/J mice, where SWR/J had a high infarct ratio of
0.77, whereas DBA2/J had a low infarct ratio of 0.50.
Quantitative PCR was performed on whole brain extracts
to determine the expression of ZBTB7C 24 hours after MCAO
compared with control mice (Figure 3). For DBA2/J mice, there
was no difference in ZBTB7C expression between the MCAO
hemisphere and control (P=0.170), whereas there was a significant difference in SWR/J mice (P=0.016). There was also a significant difference in ZBTB7C expression between the MCAO
hemispheres of SWR/J and DBA2/J mice (P=0.010). This demonstrates that the most marked difference in ZBTB7C expression
occurs after ischemic or hypoxic injury rather than at baseline.

SNP indicates single-nucleotide polymorphism.
*MAF is minor allele frequency, based on the 33 strains of mice examined.
†β is the correlation coefficient between SNP and infarct ratio based on the minor allele from an additive model.
‡Q values were obtained using the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate algorithm.

To determine the cell types in which ZBTB7C expression
occurs, we performed immunohistochemical analysis on control and MCAO mice of the SWR/J strain (Figure 3). We found
that there is a significant increase in ZBTB7C expression in
CD31+ endothelial cells in the MCAO hemisphere compared
to the contralateral hemisphere and control (P=1.89x10-4 and
8.46x10-6, respectively). There was no significant difference
in ZBTB7C expression in astrocytic (GFAP+) or neuronal
(NeuN+) cells.
To confirm this finding in the in vitro model, we performed
OGD experiments on human umbilical vein endothelial cells and
murine endothelial cell lines. The in vitro results are consistent
with the above immunohistochemical analysis. ZBTB7C expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (Figure 3).
There was a significant increase in relative ZBTB7C expression
by real-time PCR in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and
endothelial cells under OGD compared with controls (relative
expression: 2.90 and 1.62, P=0.031 and 0.006, respectively).

Discussion
Although many genetic studies have been performed on risk
of ischemic stroke,26–29 few have focused on the susceptibility

to ischemic damage.8,9 The 2 questions are fundamentally different as the former addresses the propensity to develop stroke
because of factors, such as atherosclerotic disease, whereas
the latter addresses the likelihood of ischemic damage given
the presence of an ischemic insult. Understanding the basis of
this susceptibility to ischemic damage can lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies.
To understand the genetic basis for such susceptibility,
we integrated the results from a mouse model with human
data. Strain differences in infarct size in the presence of focal
ischemia has been shown in a few strains to be related to the
completeness of the circle of Willis, particularly that of the P1
segment of the posterior cerebral artery (frequently denoted as
posterior communicating artery in rodents).4,5 We have demonstrated that across the strains examined in this study, the
infarct size is independent of the circle of Willis. As such, the
proximal MCAO model could be used. Such a model obviates
the need for a craniotomy for intracranial exposure of the vasculature or for selection of a distal branch as is done in distal
occlusion models, which may potentially have effects on the
ischemic response.

MAF indicates minor allele frequency; and SNP, single-nucleotide polymorphism.
*β is the correlation coefficient between SNP and infarct ratio based on the minor allele.

Infarct volume has been shown to be associated with
native pial collateral circulation.6 The extent of such collateral circulation has been shown to have a genetic association.6,30 In particular, Wang et al30 have demonstrated 2 QTLs
on chromosome 7 to be associated with collateral numbers.
In addition, however, after ischemia, several vascular changes
occur, such as increases in vascular density, branching, and
collateral development,7 that are independent of the native collateral numbers. These changes will also affect the degree of
ischemic damage. Moreover, it has been shown that there is a
genetic effect on ischemic tolerance beyond the effects of the
vasculature. Keum et al8 have shown that genetic variation in
Itgal modulates ischemic brain injury beyond vascular effects.
In our study, we identified ZBTB7C and ANGPT1 as candidate genes for the association with susceptibility to ischemic
injury. Although animal models of ischemia are attractive
because of the ability to control environmental and ischemic
conditions, the relevance of the findings to humans remains
an important consideration. A SNP associated with ZBTB7C
was identified as the most significant SNP in a human cohort
in both the additive and dominant genetic models, whereas
ANGPT1 was associated with the most significant SNP in
the human recessive model. The convergence of the findings
across both mouse models and humans further strengthens the
evidence for ANGPT1 and ZBTB7C as potential significant
mediators of ischemic injury.
ZBTB7C is a protein that contains an N-terminal BTB/
POZ domain that is known to mediate protein–protein interaction and 4 DNA-binding C2H2 zinc finger domains.31 It is
highly expressed in the brain.32 Our data for baseline expression of ZBTB7C are consistent with the previous work by

Zhang et al33 with the expression by neurons and astrocytes
≈7- to 9-fold higher than that of brain endothelial cells (http://
web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brain_rnaseq.html). We did
not find differential expression of ZBTB7C at baseline among
the mouse strains that correlated with infarct size, suggesting
that ZBTB7C is unlikely to be involved in the formation of
native collaterals. However, ZBTB7C is significantly upregulated in endothelial cells under ischemic conditions. Although
such an association does not prove causality, prior studies
have shown that ZBTB7C is involved in pathways that would
result in increased neuronal death,34–36 decreased formation of
vascular network,37 and endothelial dysfunction.36
ZBTB7C has been described as participating in 2 different
pathways, via its interaction with p53 and SREBP1c (Figure
I in the online-only Data Supplement). ZBTB7C has been
shown to physically interact with and inhibit p53, a transcriptional activator of p21,38 thereby negatively regulating p21.
P21 has been shown to be antiapoptotic in neurons34 via cell
cycle–dependent39 and cell cycle–independent pathways.40
Under mild oxidative stress, p21 upregulates Nrf2, which is
a transcription factor that activates an antioxidant response,
protects against cellular damage,41 including that of ischemic
neurons,35 and also stimulates the formation of vascular networks.37 However, under moderate oxidative stress, p21 initiates cell cycle arrest to allow DNA repair in response to
DNA damage.41 ZBTB7C thus increases apoptosis in neurons
and inhibits the formation of vascular network via the p53/
p21 pathway, both of which would lead to increased ischemic
damage.
As an alternative pathway, ZBTB7C has also been shown
to interact with and enhance the activity of sterol regulatory

element–binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c).42 SREBP-1 has
been shown to increase neuronal damage during ischemia.36
In addition, SREBP1c has been shown to be a repressor of
dimethylarginine dimethyl-aminohydrolase with resultant
increase in asymmetrical dimethylarginine, decrease in nitric
oxide synthase, and resulting endothelial dysfunction.36
An increase in ZBTB7C may thus increase ischemic neuronal damage and increase endothelial dysfunction via the
SREBP-1c pathway.
The involvement of ZBTB7C in the formation of vascular networks suggests that it may play a role in the dynamic

collateralization process after ischemia, in addition to modulating neuronal apoptosis. The specific mechanism by which
this occurs would require further study.
Beside ZBTB7C, ANGPT1 was also associated with the
response to ischemia in both mice and humans and was significant after adjustment for multiple testing in both. ANGPT1
is expressed in astrocytes, neurons, pericytes, and endothelial cells but is predominantly expressed by astrocytes in
the brain.43–46 Angiopoietin-1 has previously been shown to
reduce infarct size by stabilizing endothelial cell integrity,
reducing blood–brain barrier permeability, and promoting

Du et al   Genetic Susceptibility to Ischemic Injury    3521
angiogenesis.47–49 It has also been shown to be a regulator of
microvascular tone.50 ANGPT1 therefore, like ZBTB7C, modulates ischemic injury independently of native collaterals, but
does so via astrocytes that are in close contact with the endothelial cells.

Limitations

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

Our findings should be considered in the context of some
important limitations. First, although we demonstrated that
there is no significant correlation between the completeness
of the circle of Willis via the P1 segment and the infarct size in
the mouse strains examined, such an effect may still confound
the results. Several mice were excluded because of unsuccessful surgery or death. This may lead to attrition bias. Because
the researcher was not blinded to the strain of mice undergoing surgery, this may introduce additional bias. Furthermore,
although the ZBTB7C and ANGPT1 baseline expressions were
not associated with infarct size, the genetic variations may still
be associated with the native collateral formation via mechanisms other than gene expression. In addition, the human
data set used was small. Further replication of our results in a
larger human cohort is warranted. Finally, although it is plausible from prior work that the increase in ZBTB7C is involved
in dynamic collateralization and neuronal apoptosis, further
studies using ZBTB7C knockout mice and knockdown/overexpressing endothelial cells to examine the specific mechanism are still required.

Conclusions
Although it is known that the extent of cerebral infarction
is dependent on native collaterals, there is increasing evidence that there are also dynamic vascular and nonvascular
modulators of ischemic damage. By integrating mouse and
human data, we demonstrated an association between genetic
variations of ANGPT1 and ZBTB7C and the extent of ischemic damage. ZBTB7C may act via modulation of neuronal
apoptosis, as well as dynamic collateralization and endothelial dysfunction, whereas ANGPT1 has been shown to affect
endothelial integrity and angiogenesis. Together, ZBTB7C and
ANGPT1 may provide potential targets for novel treatments of
cerebral ischemia.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
Middle cerebral artery occlusion model
Animals were anesthetized with 1-3% isoflurane in 70% nitrous oxide and 30% oxygen.
A silicone-coated 7-0 monofilament was introduced in the internal carotid artery and advanced to
occlude the middle cerebral artery. Regional blood flow was measured with a laser Doppler
(Perimed, Jarfalla, Sweden) probe over the lateral frontal bone. Rectal temperature was
maintained between 36.5°C and 37.5°C with a warm water pad (Gaymar, New York). Occlusion
is considered successful when relative cerebral blood flow decreased by at least 80%. Animals
were sacrificed 24 hours after MCA occlusion. Euthanasia was performed by first anesthetizing
the animals with 1-3% isoflurane in 70% nitrous oxide and 30% oxygen, followed by cervical
dislocation.
India Ink Perfusion
Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100mg/kg) and xylazine (10mg/kg). Perfusion
fixation was performed by transthoracic cannulation of the left ventricle and opening of the right
atrium. Perfusion was begun with warm PBS (1-2 minutes) followed by 10% formalin (3
minutes) and finally a mixture of 5% gelatin/saline and India ink at 55°C (15 seconds). All
perfusates were delivered at pressures of 60-80 mm Hg.
Gene expression datasets
Microarray data was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)1. Two
GEO expressions sets were available for analysis across a large number of mouse strains.
GSE26500 utilized Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 expression beadchip to determine gene expression
in the hippocampus of 100 strains of mice2. Of the 100 strains, 24 matched those used in our
study. In addition, gene expressions in the cortex of 30 strains of inbred mice were obtained from
GSE26844, which utilized Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array3. Of the 30 strains, 27
matched those used in our study. For the Affymetrix chips, the Robust Multichip Average
(RMA) preprocessing was done. For the Illumina chips, log transformation and quantile
normalization were performed. In analyzing the GEO datasets, p-values were combined by first
converting two-sided p-values to one-sided p-values taking into account the direction of the
effect, and then using Fisher’s method.
Cell cultures
Murine brain endothelial cell line (bEnd.3) derived from BALB/c mice was purchased
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Both mouse endothelial cell
lines and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, and 1%
streptomycin/penicillin (100 µg/mL streptomycin, 100 IU/mL penicillin).
Oxygen glucose deprivation
The culture medium was replaced by glucose-free Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles’ Medium
(Cellgro, Manassas, VA). The glucose-free DMEM was placed in a hypoxia incubator chamber
(Billups-Rothenberg, Del Mar, CA). Oxygen in the medium was displaced with 95% N2/5% CO2
by placing the medium in the chamber, flushing the chamber with 95% N2/5% CO2 at 5L/min for
10 minutes and keeping the medium in the incubator overnight. The media in the cell cultures

1

were then replaced with the glucose-free media and the cultures were kept in the hypoxia
incubator flushed with 95% N2/5% CO2 overnight (at least 16 hours). Cells were harvested
immediately after termination of OGD.
RNA isolation and real-time PCR analysis
RNA isolation was performed on whole brain tissue and cell cultures with RNeasy
reagents (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). First-strand cDNA was generated using High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). Real-time PCR was performed
on an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using SYBRGreen assays (Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions: 95°C for 30 seconds, 40
cycles of 95°C for 5 seconds and 60°C for 30 seconds. All assays were run in triplicates. Primer
sequences used were: mouse β-actin GTCCCTCACCCTCCCAAAAG forward,
GCTGCCTCAACACCTCAACCC reverse; mouse Zbtb7c
AGCCAGCCCTACGTGTATGAG forward, CATTGAGGATGTGCTTGACG reverse; human
β-actin AGCGAGCATCCCCCAAAGTT forward, GGGCACGAAGGCTCATCATT reverse;
human ZBTB7C AGCCAGCCCTACGTCTATGAG forward,
CGTTGAGGATGTGCTTGACA reverse. Relative gene expression was determined using the
2!∆∆!! method and assessed by the t-test. β-actin served as the internal standard.
Immunohistochemistry
Frozen sections were used for immunohistochemical analysis. Sections were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes, permeabilized and blocked in 0.3% Triton X-100 and
5% goat serum in PBS for 20 minutes at room temperature and then incubated with the primary
antibody in the same buffer. Fluorescent visualization of antibody reactions were performed
with secondary antibodies labeled with the fluorochromes AlexaFluor488 or AlexaFluor594
(1:500 for ZBTB7C and 1:200 for all others, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nuclei were
detected with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were acquired with a Zeiss
Axioskop fluorescent microscope using ImageJ (NIH).

Supplemental Results
Expression data in mice
Given that ANGPT1 is significant in the recessive model from the strain survey and
ZBTB7C is the most significant gene in the additive and dominant models and the second most
significant gene in the recessive model, we further analyzed ANGPT1 and ZBTB7C gene
expressions. The expressions of ANGPT1 and ZBTB7C in the hippocampus and cortex of 24
and 27 strains of mice were obtained from GEO databases GSE26500 and GSE26844,
respectively. There was no correlation between baseline expression of ANGPT1 (p=0.876) or
ZBTB7C (p=0.182) and infarct ratio.
