a b s t r a c t
Enhancing endogenous neurogenesis is a potential therapeutic strategy in stroke treatment. We have previously demonstrated that treatment with a fraction of serum with molecular weight of less than 100 kDa
(100K) combined with bFGF promoted neurogenesis of cultured stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs). In this
study, we further evaluated the efﬁcacy of intraventricular administration of 100K with bFGF (100K/bFGF)
in a rat model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Rats administered 100K/bFGF on
post-stroke day 1 exhibited a higher number of Ki67 and Nestin immunoreactive cells at the subventricular zone (SVZ) area and in the infarcted brain, indicating promotion of NSPCs proliferation. The 100K/bFGF
treatment also predominantly increased the number of MAP-2 immunoreactive cells rather than GFAP
immunoreactive cells at the SVZ area and in the infarcted regions, implying that 100K/bFGF dominated
NSPCs differentiating into neurons rather than astrocytes. Importantly, treatment with 100K/bFGF signiﬁcantly improved the animals’ motor coordination. These ﬁndings demonstrated that treatment with
a low serum fraction and bFGF beneﬁted ischemic stroke likely through promotion of the proliferation
and neuronal differentiation of endogenous NSPCs.

group of stroke patients, recent extensive investigations for stroke
are also focusing on neuroprotective treatment and regenerative
therapies [15,32]. Adult neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs)
locate at the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and
the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus, where
they give rise to neurons throughout adulthood [6,33]. Adult neurogenesis is occurred in all mammalian species and may serve to
replace cells damaged by brain insults [14]. Focal cerebral ischemia
stimulates NSPC proliferation at SVZ and induces NSPC migration
toward infarct regions, followed by neurogenesis [10,20]. Con-

ditional ablation of NSPCs in adult mice diminished poststroke
motor and cognitive functional improvement and reduced synaptic connectivity [11,12,24], which demonstrated the importance of
endogenous neurogenesis in stroke recovery. Therefore, enhancing
endogenous neurogenesis may be a potential therapeutic strategy
in stroke treatment.
Several endogenous growth factors are able to promote neurogenesis after ischemia neurogenesis is observed [13]. Neurotrophic
factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BNDF) [5] and
insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) [34], both enhanced cell proliferation in SVZ and facilitated angiogenesis in infarcted areas,
paralleled by function improvement in rodent stroke models.
Hematopoietic growth factors, including granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) [7] and erythropoietin [29], were able
to trigger neurogenesis, suppress inﬂammatory reactions, and
reduced stroke volume after rodent cerebral ischemia. Since these
growth factors are normally present in blood stream, blood serum
thus contains various beneﬁcial elements for stroke therapy.
It is well-known that blood serum could support the survival,
enhance proliferation, and promote differentiation of numerous
cell types in vitro [19,25,28]. However, cultured NSPCs treated
with serum differentiated predominantly into astrocytes rather
than neurons [2,9,22], impeding further application in the disease
therapy. It may be because the differentiation of NSPCs could be
inﬂuenced by numerous factors in serum, including growth factors,
cytokines, neurotransmitters, and electrolytes, etc [16]. Nevertheless, we recently demonstrated that treatment using only a fraction
of serum with molecular weight of less than 100 kDa (100K) combined with basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (bFGF) dominated the
differentiation of NSPCs into neurons [18]. Here we try to apply
this treatment strategy, treatment of 100K with bFGF (100K/bFGF),
in stroke therapy. This study is aimed to investigate whether continuous intraventricular infusion of 100K/bFGF would enhance the
neurogenesis of endogenous NSPCs and improve the functional
recovery in an experimental model of transient cerebral ischemia.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Serum fraction
The serum fraction was obtained and collected according to protocols described previously [18]. Serum fractions with molecular
weight less than 100 kDa (100K) were prepared by centrifugation
of FBS (Biological Industries) with a molecular exclusion of 100 kDa
(Amicon® Ultra, Millipore) at 2600 g at room temperatures. After
collection of a low fraction of serum (100K), double-deionized
water was added to the original volume.
2.2. Animal surgery
The animal model was following with the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals published by the United States National
Institutes of Health and approved from the Laboratory Animal Center at National Taiwan University College of Medicine (Taiwan). The
animal experiments for middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
were followed the protocols as described previously [27,30]. Brieﬂy,
male Wistar rats (270–350 g) were anesthetized with isoﬂurane
(1.5% in a mixture of 70% N2 O and 30% O2 ). A 4–0 nylon suture
(DermalonTM ) with a heat-produced round tip was inserted from
the right common carotid artery into the right internal carotid
artery and then to the Willis’ Circle to occlude the origin of the right
middle cerebral artery. During and after surgeries, the body temperature was maintained at 37 ± 1 ◦ C throughout the surgery with a
heating pad. Then, an hour after MCAO, the nylon suture was withdrawn for cerebral reperfusion. Supplemental Fig. 1 showed the

cerebral infarcted areas using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
staining.
In the 100K/bFGF treatment group, an osmotic pump (Alzet® ),
containing whole 100K with bFGF at 20 ng/ml (Invitrogen), was
placed subcutaneously on the back of each rat one day after MCAO.
The 100K/bFGF solution was thus continuously infused for the following 5 days [17,21] into the right lateral ventricle of rats at
stereotaxic coordinates: 1.5 mm lateral, 0.8 mm posterior to the
bregma, and 3.5 mm below the brain surface. The time course of
the study design was shown in Fig. 1. To validate the procedure of
intraventricular infusion, we inoculated trypan blue solution into
the right lateral ventricle of rats via the above infusion pump. The
blue coloration was detected in the lateral and third ventricles, indicating the feasibility of the infusion technique (Supplemental Fig.
2).

2.3. Immunohistochemistry
The detailed methods for immunohistochemistry were
described previously [18,27]. Brieﬂy, animals were anesthetized
with a lethal dose of isoﬂurane and ﬁxed by transcardial perfusion with saline, followed by 4% formaldehyde. The brains were
removed and submerged in 30% sucrose. A series of 20 ␮m-thick
sections were then cyocut and stored at −80 ◦ C. The brain sections
were further incubated with primary antibodies, including antiMAP (Millipore), anti-GFAP (Millipore), anti-nestin (Millipore),
and anti-Ki67 (abcam) for 2 h at 37 ◦ C. Samples were washed and
incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with the appropriate
ﬂuorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies. Samples were also
counterstained with DAPI. These immunostained samples were
then visualized by the ﬂuorescent microscope (Lieca DMI600)
and confocal microscope (Leica TPC SP5), under similar imaging
conditions (brightness, contrast and intensity).
To quantify the cellular density in brain sections, we calculated the number of GFAP, MAP2, nestin, or Ki67 immunoreactive
cells among the DAPI-stained cells in three low-power microscopic
ﬁelds was evaluated in a randomized fashion. The average percentages of immunoreactive ratio within cells immunoreactive for
anti-GFAP, MAP2 nestin, or Ki67 were calculated from the numbers
of phenotypic marker-cells divided by the number of DAPI-stained
cells. At least 200 cells were counted in each condition by a randomized fashion. Data were collected from three independent
experiments for each condition.

2.4. Behaviors testing
Three behavioral tests (rotarod test, neurological severity score
test, and body asymmetry test) were used to evaluate the motor
function of rats before and after MCAO (Fig. 1) as our previous
reports [27,30]. Detailed procedures are available online (Supplemental methods).

3. Results
3.1. 100K/bFGF promoted NSPC proliferation after focal cerebral
ischemia
Six days after MCAO, confocal ﬂuorescent images showed some
NSPCs located at SVZ expressing a proliferation marker, Ki67. We
then infused 100K/bFGF into the lateral ventricles of the stroke rats
one day after MCAO. Post-MCAO treatment with 100K/bFGF significantly increased the number of Ki67-immunoreative NSPCs in SVZ
regions ipsilateral to infarcted brain (31.3 ± 2.0 vs. 6.7 ± 0.9) (Fig. 2A
and C). In addition, while there was no Ki67-immunoreative cells
detected in the hemisphere outside the SVZ contralateral to the
ischemic brain, abundant cells located in infarcted areas expressing Ki67 six days after stroke. The MCAO rats receiving 100K/bFGF
treatment showed more Ki-67 immunoreactive cells within the
infarcted regions as compared to untreated rats (114.3 ± 14.4 vs.
67.8 ± 2.5 per mm2 ) (Fig. 2B and D).
Using immunostaining to detect nestin, an NSPC marker, the
immunoreactivity of nestin was grossly higher in the infarcted
regions (178.4 ± 12.4 vs. 102.8 ± 9.9 per mm2 ) (Fig. 3A and D) and
around the SVZ areas of 100K/bFGF-treated than untreated MCAO
rats (83.0 ± 5.6 vs. 16.7 ± 3.5 per ﬁeld) (Fig. 3C and F). Confocal ﬂuorescent images further demonstrated that 100K/bFGF treatment
increased the expression of nestin-immunoreactive cells in the
infarcted brain of MCAO rats (49.0 ± 4.6 vs. 11.0 ± 2.6) (Fig. 3B and
E). These above ﬁndings indicated that post-MCAO treatment with
intraventricular 100K/bFGF infusion promoted NSPC proliferation

in the SVZ regions associated with more NSPCs migrating toward
the infarcted areas.
3.2. 100K/bFGF dominated NSPCs differentiating into neurons
after cerebral infarction
We further investigated the NSPC differentiation in the infarcted
regions six days after MCAO. Using immunostaining to detect
MAP-2 (a neuronal marker) and GFAP (an astrocyte marker), the
immunoreactivity of MAP-2 and GFAP was both higher in the
infarcted regions and the SVZ areas of 100K/bFGF-treated than
untreated MCAO rats (Fig. 4A and B). Confocal ﬂuorescent images
showed that 100K/bFGF treatment increased the expressions of
MAP-2-immunoreactive cells (169.7 ± 6.6 vs. 36.9 ± 3.9 per mm2 )
and GFAP-immunoreactive cells in the infarcted brain (240.7 ± 14.2
vs.102.8 ± 10.0 per mm2 ) of MCAO rats (Fig. 4C). The percentage of
MAP-2-immunoreactive cell number over a combination of MAP-2and GFAP-immunoreactive cell number was higher in 100K/bFGFtreated than untreated rats (41.4 ± 0.5 vs. 26.4 ± 0.6%) (Fig. 4D and
E). These ﬁndings indicated that post-MCAO treatment with intraventricular 100K/bFGF infusion dominated NSPCs differentiating
into neurons rather than astrocytes in infarcted areas.
3.3. 100K/bFGF treatment facilitated functional improvement of
the MCAO rats
In both treated and untreated groups, the time that rats were
able to stay on an accelerating rotarod declined sharply 1 day
after MCAO and then gradually increased toward the baseline level
(Fig. 5A). On day 6 after MCAO, compared with rats receiving no
treatment, MCAO rats treated with intraventricular infusion of
100K/bFGF had notable increases in the amount of time that they
stayed on the rotarod (159.3 ± 7.6 vs. 94.1 ± 13.3 s). Similarly, neurological deﬁcits and increased body tilting were observed 1 day

Fig. 3. The 100K/bFGF treatment increased the number of nestin immunopositive cells in the infarcted brain. Immunostaining with the NSPCs marker nestin (red) and nuclear

after MCAO, but these changes gradually approached toward the
baseline conditions in both groups (Fig. 5B and 5C). Treatment
with 100K/bFGF signiﬁcantly enhanced the recovery on neurological score (3.4 ± 0.2 vs. 4.4 ± 0.4) and body tilting (13.6 ± 1.3 vs.
17.8 ± 0.9 s) at day 6 after MCAO.

4. Discussion
Since the ability of neuronal regeneration after stroke is limited [8,23], enhancing proliferation and neuronal differentiation of
endogenous NSPCs provides an attractive therapeutic strategy for
stroke treatment. In this study, post-insult infusion of 100K/bFGF
into the ventricle ipsilateral to the infarcted area facilitated NSPC
proliferation at the SVZ in a transient focal cerebral ischemic rodent
model. In addition, 100K/bFGF treatment promoted NSPCs differentiating into neurons rather than astrocytes. Importantly, these
alterations in NSPC characters translated to stroke recovery of the
rats as illustrated by improvement in motor behaviors. The present
study is the ﬁrst to demonstrate that treatment with a low serum
fraction and bFGF beneﬁted ischemic stroke likely through promo-

tion of the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of endogenous
NSPCs.
Focal cerebral ischemia stimulates NSPC proliferation at SVZ
and induces NSPC migration toward infarct regions [10,20].
In 100K/bFGF-treated MCAO rat, numbers of Ki-67 and nestin
immunoreactive cells were higher than untreated rat in SVZ and
infarcted regions. These ﬁndings indicated that 100K/bFGF promoted endogenous NSPC proliferation after focal cerebral ischemia.
Additionally, although 100K/bFGF increased numbers of both neurons and astrocytes in infarcted areas, the number increase was
more prominent in neurons than astrocytes. The above results
were consistent to our previous in vitro reports that 100K/bFGF
co-treatment dominated the differentiation of cultured NSPCs
into neurons [18]. After infusion of 100K/bFGF into ventricles,
some growth factors in 100K accompanied with bFGF stimulated
NSPCs at the SVZ near the ventricles. The treated NSPCs thus
robustly proliferated and differentiated predominantly into neurons.
Inhibition or ablation of NSPCs in adult mice diminished poststroke motor and cognitive functional improvement [11,12,24],
implying that endogenous neurogenesis directly participates in

stroke recovery. The potential effects of post-stroke neurogenesis incude neuroprotection, immunomodulation, angiogenesis,
neurotrophism, and possibly neuronal replacement [31]. In this
study, the motor functional behaviors were signiﬁcantly better
in 100K/bFGF-treated than untreated MCAO rats at post-stroke
day 6. Although NSPC proliferation and neuronal differentiation
did occur within 7 days in this in vivo and our previous in vitro
studies [18], it is still too short to develop neurons with functional network. Therefore, Neuronal replacement is thus less likely
the major mechanism contributing to the functional improvement
in our 100K/bFGF-treated rats. Thus, the rotarod resultus with
slight signiﬁcant difference could be reasonable to suggest that, by
100K/bFGF induction, increase of endogenous NSPCs and the components such as growth factors in serum fraction might provide a
neuroprotective effect on reduction of neuron death in the ischemia
brain so that increasing the probability of motor function recovery
of a massive MCAO model at the early stage.
Although blood serum contains various growth factors, such
as BDNF, IGF-1, G-CSF, and erythropoietin, which could facilitate
neurogenesis and potentially promote functional recovery after
stroke [5,7,13,29,34], cultured NSPCs treated with whole serum
differentiated predominantly into astrocytes rather than neurons
[2,9,22]. The feature of astrocyte-preferenced differentiation after
whole serum stimulation impeded further application of serumbased treatment in stroke therapy. Here, we showed that treatment
with only a low fraction of serum could overcome this problem in NSPC differentiation. The low fraction of serum (100K)
could be easily obtained from stroke patients with sequential
centrifugation of whole blood. Autologous transfusion a part of
serum prevents tissue rejection and allergic reaction. Use a low
fraction of serum rather than speciﬁc growth factors or protein
for disease therapy also reduces the cost of recombinant protein
production. Therefore, treatment with 100K and a low concentration of bFGF provides a concept that patient could treat an
ischemia by their own serum components, which is as the protein, peptide, or thrombolytic drug injection for ischemic stroke
[1,4,26].
5. Conclusion
In the present study, we successfully translated our previous in
vitro ﬁndings into stroke rats and demonstrated that intraventricular treatment with 100K/bFGF improved functional outcome in
cerebral infarct via enhancement of neurogenesis. Importantly, by
animal model, treatment with 100K/bFGF signiﬁcantly improved
the animals’ motor coordination. These ﬁndings demonstrated that
treatment with a low serum fraction and bFGF beneﬁted ischemic
stroke likely through promotion of the proliferation and neuronal
differentiation of endogenous NSPCs. It strengthened the role of
endogenous neurogenesis in stroke recovery and provided a concept for ischemia therapeutic stagey. Furthermore, future studies
were also mandatory to investigate the key speciﬁc factors in a low
fraction of serum for stroke therapy.
