Stroke is one of the most common diseases that caused high mortality and has become burden to the health care systems. Stem cell
transplantation has shown therapeutic effect in ameliorating ischemic damage after cerebral artery occlusion mainly due to their
neurogenesis, immune regulation, or effects on the plasticity, proliferation, and survival of host cells. Recent studies demonstrated
that skin-derived precursor cells (SKPs) could promote central nervous system regeneration in spinal cord injury model or the
neonatal peripheral neuron. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of SKPs in a rat model of cerebral ischemia. SKPs
were isolated, expanded, and transplanted into rat cortex and striatum after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Our results
revealed that SKPs transplantation could improve the behavioral measures of neurological deficit. Moreover, immunohistology
confirmed that SKPs could secrete basic FGF and VEGF in the ischemic region and further markedly increase the proliferation of
endogenous nestin+ and ùõΩIII-tubulin+ neural stem cells. Furthermore, increased angiogenesis induced by SKPs was observed by
vWF and ùõº-SMA staining. These data suggest that SKPs induced endogenous neurogenesis and angiogenesis and protected neuron
from hypoxic-ischemic environment. In conclusion, SKPs transplantation may be a promising approach in treatment of stroke.

1. Introduction
Stroke is a neurodegenerative disorder and a leading cause of
death and disability in many countries, but only a few options
support efficient recovery in stroke patients. Over the last
20 years, stem cell-based therapies were raising increasing
attention on the treatment of stroke [1, 2]. Administration of
stem cells resulted in beneficial effects on neuronal survival
and recovery after experimental stroke [3, 4]. But limited
stem cells for clinical application including ethical and safety
concerns associated with the use of pluripotent stem cells
have spurred great interest in the search for alternative stem
cell sources for stroke treatment.

Autologous stem cells such as bone marrow mesenchymal
stem cells (BM-MSCs) appeared as candidate for the regenerative therapy in the stroke treatment [3, 5, 6]. Nevertheless,
BM-MSCs must be isolated by bone marrow aspiration,
which is traumatic and painful. Moreover, the percentage of
stem cells in bone marrow is very low and decreases with age,
thus making it difficult to harvest a sufficient number of highquality cells for clinical application. Recently, skin-derived
precursor cells (SKPs) have attracted attention because they
are more readily accessible from adult tissue [7] which belong
to neural crest cell populations in various locations of the
adult organism [8]. SKPs can proliferate and differentiate into
subpopulations of cells expressing neuronal, glial, smooth

2
muscle, and adipocyte markers in vitro [7, 9, 10]. Moreover,
SKPs show some properties like Schwann-like cells in the process of somatic nerve regeneration [11‚Äì13]. However, there has
been no study on whether SKPs can effectively recover function of brain after stroke. Meanwhile, the exact effect of transplanted SKPs on damage tissue has not been clarified [14].
Most studies have shown that the underlying mechanisms
of functional recovery following autologous stem cells transplantation are likely mediated by the release of growth factors,
which promotes endogenous repair mechanisms, rather than
stimulates neuronal differentiation or implant integration
at the ischemic site [15, 16]. Moreover, neural crest-derived
stem cells have been proved to secrete several active factors
such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and Glial cell line-derived
neurotrophic factor (GDNF) to enhance neurogenesis in
brain after stroke [17, 18]. Besides, transplanted SKPs can be
easily became functional vascular SMCs [19] and endothelial
cells [20, 21] in the healing wound. According to these
evidences, we speculated that SKPs might protect neurons,
promote angiogenesis and neural regeneration, and further
reduce functional deficits following transplantation into
lesion areas in a rat model of transient ischemia induced
by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Our results
suggested that SKPs exert multiple, independent effects on
the ischemic brain that may modify outcome after stroke.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Isolation, Cultivation, and Characterization of SKPs.
Neonatal male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from
the Laboratory Animal Center of the Academy of Military
Medical Sciences (Beijing, China). All experimental procedures were conducted in conformity with institutional
guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
in Nankai University Animal Care and Use Committee.
SKPs were isolated and cultured as described previously
[9]. Briefly, SKPs were prepared from infant rat skin (1‚Äì
3 weeks) which was cut into 2-3 mm2 pieces by a sterile
razor blade and then transferred into a 50 mL tube containing 1 mg/mL Dispase II and 0.5 mg/mL collagenase I
in DMEM/F12 medium for 30 min at 37‚àò C, mechanically
dissociated, and filtered through a 40 ùúám cell strainer. Cells
were plated at a density of 1‚Äì2.5 √ó 104 cells/mL in proliferation
medium including DMEM/F12 (Gibco) 3 : 1 containing 0.1%
penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 40 ng/mL bFGF (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL EGF(Invitrogen), and 2% B27 supplement
(Invitrogen) at 37‚àò C, 5% CO2 .
To passage SKPs, floating spheres were mechanically
dissociated and reseeded in fresh medium containing B27
and growth factors at a density of 1 √ó 105 cells/mL. Cells
were passaged every 7 days. To characterize the isolated
SKPs, we utilized flow cytometry (FACS) method. SKPs single
cell suspensions from day 14 were obtained by treatment
with 0.5 mg/mL of Dispase II (Roche, Indianapolis) at 37‚àò C
for 30 min. Cells were passed through a 40 ùúám cell strainer
and were incubated with triton X-100 for 10 min at RT
and then, and cells were incubated for 30 min at 4‚àò C with

BioMed Research International
mouse anti-nestin and anti-ùõº-SMA antibody, respectively.
After being washed three times, the FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies were added into the
cell suspensions and incubated for 1 hour at 4‚àò C. Cells
were analyzed using FACScan (BD Pharmingen, San Jose,
CA). To determine the differentiation potential of SKPs,
myogenic, neurogenic and adipogenic differentiation was
induced by medium (DMEM/F12 3 : 1 containing 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2% B27 supplement). Medium changes
were carried out every two days. Adipogenic differentiation
was assessed by the cellular accumulation of neutral lipid
vacuoles after cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, stained
with Oil red O (Sigma-Aldrich).
To identify undifferentiated or differentiated SKPs, cells
were centrifuged at low speed, dissociated, collected, and
adhered to a poly-D-lysine substratum overnight. For
immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and treated with different
antibodies including nestin (Abcam), fibronectin (Santa
Cruz), P75 (Abcam), ùõº-SMA (Abcam), glial fibrillary acidic
protein GFAP (Santa Cruz), and ùõΩ-III tubulin (Santa
Cruz). After overnight incubation at 4‚àò C with primary
antibodies, cells were incubated at room temperature for
60 min with secondary antibodies. The secondary antibodies
included Rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse, FITCconjugated anti-rabbit, and anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen). After
washing in PBS, samples were counterstained with a mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and
examined by fluorescence microscopy.
2.2. Animal Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Model. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced
as previously reported [22] with a slight modification.
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 280‚Äì300 g were
anesthetized with 5% isoflurane in O2 using an induction
chamber and maintained at 3% isoflurane using a face mask.
Temperature was maintained at 37‚àò C throughout the surgical
procedure, using an electronic temperature controller linked
to a heating pad. The right common carotid artery (CCA),
external carotid artery (ECA), and internal carotid artery
(ICA) were exposed through a ventral midline incision. A
4-0 monofilament nylon suture with a rounded tip was
introduced into the CCA lumen and gently advanced into
the ICA until it blocked the bifurcating origin of the MCA.
Reperfusion was accomplished by withdrawing the suture
after 60 min of ischemia.
2.3. Experimental Groups and Transplantation Procedures.
The animal experiments consist of three groups: Group 1:
SKPs (0.5 √ó 106 ) (ùëõ = 6); Group 2: Saline (ùëõ = 5);
Group 3: Sham (ùëõ = 3). The injection operations were
performed 24 h after MCAO. Prior to transplantation, SKPs
were digested. Particularly, cell spheres were collected by
centrifugation and then added 1 mg/mL dispase II enzyme
to digest for about 30 min. The spheres were dissociated
into single cells through mechanical approach, which were
collected by centrifugation. DiI was dissolved in absolute
ethanol (2.5 mg/mL) and added to the cell suspension so that
the final concentration was 40 ùúág/mL. Cells were incubated

BioMed Research International
in the DiI-containing medium for 30 minutes at 37‚àò C and
then washed three times with PBS. Stereotaxic injections were
performed using Hamilton microsyringe with a 26-gauge
blunt needle. Each animal received an injection of 10 ùúáL (at
the rate of 1 ùúáL/min, and concentration 50000 cells/ùúáL) of
DiI-SKPs into the striatum (from bregma: A + 1.0 mm, L +
2.0 mm, V 22.6 mm). The needle was left in situ for 2 min after
injection before removal. At day 7 after cell transplantation,
rats received injection of BrdU (Sigma, 10 mg/mL in saline)
twice a day (50 mg/kg, i.p.) for 7 consecutive days. These rats
were sacrificed 14 days after the cells injection [23].
2.4. Behavioral Testing. All animals were trained for 1 week
after MCAO. And these behavioral measurements were performed every day since induction of MCAO until sacrifice. A
modified neurological severity score (mNSS) was used in this
study which includes (1) response to raising the rat-tail and
placing it on the flat surface; (2) abnormal movement such
as immobility, tremor, and seizures; (3) sensory deficit; (4)
absent reflexes such pinna, corneal, and startle. Normal score
is 0; maximal deficit score is 18 [6].
2.5. Histological and Immunohistochemical Assessment. Animals were reanaesthetized with 5% isoflurane in O2 14 days
after surgery. Rat brains were fixed by transcardial perfusion
with saline, followed by perfusion and immersion in 4%
paraformaldehyde, and the brain were embedded in paraffin
and cut into 5 ùúám sections. The area of both hemispheres
was measured on eight serial coronal sections per brain
(200 ùúám apart) stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and the
infarction area was averaged over these eight levels. The lesion
size was estimated as a percentage of the whole brain by
using the following formula: [(area of contralateral hemisphere) ‚àí (area of remaining ipsilateral hemisphere)/(area of
contralateral hemisphere) √ó 100/2]. To identify proliferating
cells, samples were incubated in 2 N HCl at 37‚àò C for 30
minutes and then rinsed in 0.1 M boric acid with pH =
8.6. Samples were incubated with primary antibodies against
BrdU at 4‚àò C for overnight. After washing with 0.01 M PBS,
samples were incubated with secondary antibodies (FITClabeled polyclonal goat anti-mouse). For a morphological analysis of vessels, a polyclonal antibody against Von
Willebrand factor (vWF; Dako) and ùõº-SMA (Abcam) was
used. The secondary antibodies were Rhodamine-conjugated
donkey anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen). Slides were observed under confocal laser scanning
microscopy (Leica TSC SP8, Germany). To investigate which
cell-specific makers co-localized with BrdU-positive nucleus,
sections were treated with different antibodies including
vWF (Abcam), nestin (Abcam), and coimmunostaining with
BrdU. To detect neuroblasts, a polyclonal antibody against
nestin (Abcam) and ùõΩ-III tubulin (Santa Cruz) were used.
In order to quantify the number of immunoreactive cells,
three representative sections from each animal were analyzed.
The numbers of cells was blindly counted within 0.25 mm2 of
subventricular zone (SVZ), ischemic border zone (IB), and
ischemic zone (IZ) using NIH image software, Image J. The
immunoreactive cells were manually marked and calculated
with Image J.

2.6. Statistical Analysis. All quantitative results were obtained
from at least three samples for analysis. Data were expressed
as the mean ¬± SD. An independent ùë°-test was used for two
group comparisons and one-way ANOVA for multiple-group
comparison, with suitable post hoc analysis. The level of
statistical significance was set at ùëÉ < 0.05.

3. Results
3.1. Characterization and Differentiation of SKPs. As shown
in bright field picture (Figure 1(a)(I)), the rat SKPs developed
into sphere-like structure in suspension cultures. The
SKPs specific marker nestin (Figure 1(a)(II)), fibronectin
(Figure 1(a)(III)), neural crest stem cells marker P75
(Figures 1(a)(IV)‚Äì1(a)(VI)), and ùõº-SMA negative were
examined by immunocytochemistry methods and FACS
(Figure 1(b)). After induction, SKP spheres began to
express neuroblast marker ùõΩ-III tubulin (Figure 1(c)(I))
and astrocyte marker GFAP (Figure 1(c)(II)), indicating the
neural potential of SKP cells in vitro. Furthermore, some
cells were positively stained for ùõº-SMA (Figure 1(c)(III)) and
Oil red O (Figure 1(c)(IV)), which revealed the mesodermal
cell types differentiation capacity.
3.2. Neurobehavioral Tests and Lesion Size. To study SKPs
induced neurogenesis and angiogenesis after cerebral
ischemia, rats were subjected to MCAO, given SKPs on day 1
and injected cell proliferation maker BrdU on days 7‚Äì14 after
ischemia injury (Figure 2(a)). Two weeks after treatment,
SKPs transplantation did not result in significant reduction
of lesion size compared to the control group by hematoxylineosin staining (Figures 2(c)(I) and 2(c)(II)) and statistical
analysis (Figure 2(d)). However, the modified neurological
severity score (mNSS) was significantly improved at 7 and 14
days in the SKPs treatment group (Figure 2(e)). Compared
with control group, toluidine blue staining showed that more
neuron exhibited relatively homogenous oval shaped nuclei
in SKPs group (Figures 2(c)(III) and 2(c)(IV)). These data
suggest that SKPs may contribute to neurological function
improvement after stroke.
3.3. The Function of SKPs in Rat Brain. In order to clarify
the therapeutic contribution of SKPs, DiI+ SKPs were first
immunostained with basic FGF and VEGF. Our results
revealed that the transplanted DiI+ cells were colocalized
with trophic factors bFGF and VEGF (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)).
Meanwhile, the higher blood vessel density with marker
vWF (Figure 3(c)) and ùõº-SMA (Figure 3(d)) were observed
around DiI+ cells, which indicated that secreted growth
factors had angiogenic capacity in the ischemic tissue and
could ameliorate the function of brain after injury.
3.4. The Neurogenesis and Angiogenesis Effect of Transplanted
SKPs. To study the proliferation of endogenous stem cells
in subventricular zone (SVZ) and ischemic boundary zone
(IBZ), animals received BrdU injection for 7 days before
sacrifice. Colocalization of BrdU-positive cells with nestin
was observed in the SVZ (Figures 4(a)(I) and 4(a)(III))
and IBZ (Figures 4(b)(I) and 4(b)(III)) areas 14 days after

stroke. The number of total BrdU+ cells had no significant
difference between cell therapy group and control group in
SVZ (Figure 4(d)). Meanwhile, BrdU+ cells also are widely
distributed in areas from SVZ to infarct boundary in both
groups. Compared with control group, the BrdU+ cells had
a 2.5-fold increase in IBZ. Moreover, nestin+ cells had a 2fold increase in IBZ of SKPs treated groups, but no significant
difference between two groups in SVZ (Figure 4(f)). ùõΩ-III
tubulin is a marker that is expressed in newborn neuroblasts
and used to trace the nascent cells. At second week after
stroke, we observed that ùõΩ-III tubulin+ cells are distributed
in SVZ (Figures 4(b)(II) and 4(b)(IV)) and IBZ (Figures
4(b)(II) and 4(b)(IV)). Compared with control group, the
number of ùõΩ-III tubulin+ cells was increased 2-fold in SVZ,
1.4-fold in IBZ of SKPs group (Figure 4(e)). The increased
BrdU+ cells and migrated neuroblasts indicated ameliorated
microenvironment in the infract region which promoted
neurogenesis in SVZ.
The number of ùõº-SMA+ , vWF+ vessels and vWF+ /BrdU+
cells at 14 days after transplantation in IBZ (Figure 5(a))
and ischemic zone (IZ) (Figure 5(b)) were analyzed by

double immunofluorescence staining and visualized by laser
scanning confocal microscopy respectively. By counting the
number of ùõº-SMA+ vessels, which represent large blood
vessel, the results were significantly higher than that of
control group in IBZ but not in IZ (Figure 4(d)). Meanwhile,
the vWF+ vessel density of SKPs group has followed the same
trend (Figure 5(e)). However, the numbers of vWF+ /BrdU+
cells were increased 2.3-fold in IBZ, 2-fold in IZ (Figure 5(f)).
These data demonstrate that SKPs have an obvious effect on
revascularization of ischemic damage.

4. Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that injection of 0.5 √ó 106 SKPs
(24 h after brain ischemia) significantly improved functional
outcome compared with control group at day 7 and day 14.
Morphological analysis indicated that paracrine signaling of
SKPs played a major role to enhance vessel density, cellular
proliferation, and neurogenesis along the lateral ventricle
and in the striatal ischemic boundary zone, which likely

contributed to the improvement of neurological functional
recovery in rat after stroke.
SKPs were initially derived from neural crest and displayed multidirectional differentiation capacity including
mesodermal and neural progeny during long-term culture
[24]. However, the ability of differentiation into electrophysiologically active neural cells has not been proved by animal
model just through hippocampal slices culture [14]. Here,
we do not observe any DiI+ neural cells differentiation in
injection area perhaps due to low cell viability after transplantation. In the present research, the fact that transplanted
SKPs improved functional restoration without the reduction
of lesion area in the ischemic brain of rats would be more
probably due to neurorestorative effects of proteins released

by transplanted SKPs, which resulted in neurogenesis and
angiogenesis in the ischemic boundary zone.
It was known that NSCs reside in the specific region of
brain. When damaged, NSCs will be mobilized and migrate
toward injury site immediately in the first two weeks [25]
and yet were hard to survive due to low blood-supply
level and hypoxia in the local microenvironment [26]. To
overcome this problem, MSCs [27] and olfactory ensheathing
cells [28] were applied to neuroprotective in stroke animal
models of stroke. Noteworthy this is the first report in
which the treatment outcome was found in ischemic brain
tissue after SKPs transplantation. Results showed that SKPs
also secrete VEGF and bFGF, which could help in vascular
remolding. Increased vWF-immunoreactive vessel density

significantly (ùëÉ < 0.05) increased the number of endothelial cells and the density of vessels in the IZ and IBZ compared with group treated
with PBS (ùëõ = 5).

and the number of BrdU+ vWF+ cells in the rats treated with
SKPs indicated that SKPs modulated vascular system and
stimulated endothelial cells proliferation.
Previous study reported that, compared to MSCs, SKPs
were able to secrete more neurotrophic molecules (like
BDNFs, GDNFs, and bFGF) that exhibit substantial effects on
neuron survival and functions [29]. Neurotrophic molecules
not only stimulates neurite outgrowth for several neuronal
cell types in vitro but also stimulates regrowth of multiple
descending axon tracts within the spinal cord following
injury [30]. In addition, transplantation of neural stem cells
overexpressing GDNF enhanced neurogenesis in rats after
stroke [31]. We also demonstrated that treatment with SKPs
significantly increased the number of BrdU incorporating
cells, nestin-immunoreactive cells, and the ùõΩ-III tubulinimmunoreactive cells in the SVZ suggesting that SKPs
treatment enhanced endogenous neurogenesis. Moreover,
H&E and toluidine blue staining showed that most neuron
exhibited relatively homogenous oval shaped nuclei in SKPs
group and less extent of inflammation in SKPs group than the
control group. It has been reported that extracellular matrix

(ECM) affects cells survival, proliferation, and migration [32].
Fibronectin is a crucial component of the ECM that has
been demonstrated to stimulate nerve fiber growth in vitro
and exert a neural protective effect after stroke [33]. In our
study, SKPs expressed fibronectin in culture. Therefore, it is
possible that fibronectin may participate in neuron survival
and differentiation and involve the functional restoration
by activating integrin signal transduction and reestablishing
new neuronal circuits in host brain tissue. Taken together,
these data further explain why SKPs could enhance neurological function recovery.

5. Conclusion
Transplantation of SKPs into rat brain after stroke improved
neurological function recovery by promoting neurogenesis
and neovascularization, because SKPs are readily accessible
pluripotent sources and possess various therapeutic capacities, which may become a promising candidate cell source for
treatment of stroke.
