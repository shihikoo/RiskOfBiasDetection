Abstract: Delayed treatment of stroke with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) induces overexpression of matrix
metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) which leads to breakdown of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and causes more injuries to the brain
parenchyma. In this study, the effect of ascorbic acid (AA), an antioxidant agent, on the delayed administration of r-tPA in a rat
model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was investigated. Forty male rats were randomly divided into four
groups: untreated control rats (ischaemic animals), AA-treated (500 mg/kg; 5 hr after stroke) rats, r-tPA-treated (5 hr after stroke
1 mg/kg) rats and rats treated with the combination of AA and r-tPA. Middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced by occluding
the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). Infarct size, BBB, brain oedema and the levels of MMP-9 were measured at the end of
study. Neurological deficits were evaluated at 24 and 48 hr after stroke. Compared to the control or r-tPA-treated animals, AA
alone (p < 0.001) or in combination with r-tPA (p < 0.05) significantly decreased infarct volume. Ascorbic acid alone or
r-tPA + AA significantly reduced BBB permeability (p < 0.05), levels of MMP-9 (p < 0.05 versus control; p < 0.01 versus
r-tPA) and brain oedema (p < 0.001) when compared to either the control or the r-tPA-treated animals. Latency to the removal
of sticky labels from the forepaw was also significantly decreased after the administration of AA + r-tPA (p < 0.05) at 24 or
48 hr after stroke. Based on our data, acute treatment with AA may be considered as a useful candidate to reduce the side effects
of delayed application of r-tPA in stroke therapy.

Ischaemic brain injury (IBI) is one of the most common
causes of mortality and morbidity in the world [1,2]. Ischaemic brain injury is accompanied by several side effects,
including brain oedema, destruction of blood–brain barrier
(BBB), inflammation and induction of oxidative stress [3].
Oxidative stress in turn leads to oedema and more destruction
of BBB which causes additional brain damage [4]. Reperfusion with thrombolytic recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) remains the only treatment proved to be safe and
effective when given within 3–4.5 hr after ischaemia onset
[5]. It has been shown that delayed use of r-tPA leads to hyperperfusion which results in the accumulation of free radicals
and the up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
including MMP-9 [6,7] and these events lead to more injuries
to the brain parenchyma. Under normal conditions, the endogenous and exogenous antioxidants scavenge free radicals and
inhibit the harmful effects of oxidative stress [8]. Previous
investigations revealed that after IBI, the concentrations of
glutathione and ascorbic acid (AA) are decreased, while free
radicals are increased [9,10], suggesting that increasing the
concentration of AA, which may act as an antioxidant under
these conditions, could be considered as new therapeutic strategy for treatment of IBI [11].
One vitamer form of AA, vitamin C, is a potential antioxidant factor that can neutralize free radicals (especially

hydroxyl radicals) via electron transfer, especially in brain
parenchyma [12,13]. It has been shown that antioxidant treatment with AA significantly reduces lipid peroxidation and
increases superoxide dismutase and catalase activities after seizures induced by pilocarpine [14]. Moreover, AA is an essential antioxidant for scavenging free radicals in the brain and
may protect endothelial function against the exacerbated
ischaemic oxidative injury in diabetes [15]. Furthermore, oxidative stress is an early trigger for the up-regulation of MMP9 which in turn contributes to BBB damage after cerebral
ischaemia reperfusion [16,17]. Therefore, in this study, we
examined the role of AA in infarct volume, BBB permeability,
behavioural function and the levels of MMP-9 after delayed
administration of r-tPA (5 hr) in a rat model of permanent
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
Material and Methods
Animals and treatments. Animals were handled in accordance with
the criteria outlined in the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (NIH US publication 86-23 revised 1985; http://oacu.
od.nih.gov/regs/guide/guidex.htm). Experimental protocols were
approved by the animal ethics committee of the Rafsanjan University
of Medical Science (permission number 9/3042). A total of 60 male
rats (200–250 g) were maintained on a 12-hr light–dark cycle with
food and water available ad libitum. In the first experiment, 40 rats
were randomized into 4 separated MCAO groups (10 rats in each
group) as follows: control (ischaemic animals, treated orally with 2 ml
saline), AA (500 mg/kg dissolved in 2 ml saline; Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA) using an oral-gastric catheter, r-tPA (1 mg/kg, i.v.;

Boehringer-Ingelheim, Rhein, Germany) and the combination therapy
of AA + r-tPA. These animals were used for the measurement of
infarct volume, brain oedema and sticky tape behavioural test. In the
second experiment, 20 rats were randomly divided into four equal
groups as noted above, and these animals were used for the evaluation
of BBB permeability and levels of MMP-9. The dose of r-tPA and
AA was selected based on the other investigations [14,18] and our
preliminary results. The drugs were applied at 5 hr after the stroke
onset.
MCAO induction. Rats were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection
of ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (8 mg/kg). Induction of MCAO
was performed via occluding the left MCA as previously reported
[19]. In brief, a small incision was made between the ear and the eye.
The temporalis muscle was retracted and the skull exposed. A small
hole, about 1 mm in diameter, was drilled on the temporal bone above
the MCA at the level of the inferior cerebral vein. The dura was
carefully removed and the MCA cauterized permanently using a
thermo coagulator. After the procedure, the muscle was replaced and
the skin wound sutured. After recovery from the anaesthesia, the
animals were returned to their individual home cages. The surgeon
was blinded to treatment assignments.
Measurement of infarct volumes and brain oedema. The
quantification of infarct volume has been described previously [20].
Briefly, all animals were killed 48 hr after the onset of MCA
occlusion. The brains were removed from the skull, prepared into 2mm-thick coronal sections using a cutting block and stained with 2%
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma Chemical Co., St.
Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min. at 37°C followed by overnight
immersion in 10% formalin. The infarcted tissue remained unstained
(white), whereas normal tissue was stained red. The infarct zone was
demarcated and analysed by ImageJ software (NIH Image, version
1.61 Bethesda, Maryland, USA). Infarct areas of all sections were
added to determine the total infarct area, which was multiplied by the
thickness (2 mm) of the brain sections to obtain the infarct volume.
To compensate for the effect of brain oedema, the corrected infarct
volume was calculated as follows: corrected infarct area = measured
infarct
area 9 {1 [(ipsilateral
hemisphere
area-contralateral
hemisphere area)/contralateral hemisphere]}. Brain oedema was
determined using the following formula: oedema = (volume of left
hemisphere volume of right hemisphere)/volume of right hemisphere
[21]. The brain oedema was reported as percentages. The examiner
was blinded to treatment assignments.
Evaluation of blood–brain barrier permeability. The permeability of
the BBB was quantitatively determined by extravasation of Evans blue
as a marker of albumin extravasations [22]. Briefly, 2% Evans blue in
saline (2 mg/kg) was injected intravenously 2 hr before each expected
time-point via a femoral vein. Rats were then deeply anaesthetized
with (100 mg/kg) pentobarbital (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and
infused with heparinized saline through the cardiac ventricle until
colourless infusion fluid was obtained from the atrium. After
decapitation of animals and removing the brain from skull, the
hemispheres were separated along the sagittal suture. Then, both
hemispheres were weighed and put into formamide (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) (1 ml/100 mg) at 60°C for 24 hr. The
concentration of dye extracted from each brain was determined at
620 nm using spectrophotometry. The quantitative calculation of the
dye content in the brain was performed based on the external
standards dissolved in the same solvent.
Serum MMP-9 levels. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 was measured using
a commercial ELISA kit (R and D system, Minneapolis, MN, USA)
according to the company’s guidelines. Briefly, serum samples were

added to the anti-MMP-9 pre-coated ELISA plates and incubated for
2 hr at room temperature. After removing the remained serum with
washing solution, a HRP-conjugated anti-MMP-9 was added and
incubated for 30 min. The free HRP-conjugated anti-MMP-9 was
removed by washing solution and the substrate (TMB + H2O2) was
added, and after 15 min. of incubation, the reaction was stopped using
2 N sulphuric acid. The optical density of each sample was measured
using an ELISA reader (Bio-Rad, California, USA) at 450 nm.
Behavioural testing. The sensorimotor function was evaluated by the
adhesive removal test [23]. Rats were tested 24 hr before MCAO and
at 24 and 48 hr after ischaemia insult. In brief, a small adhesive label
(1 9 1 cm) was attached to the radial surface of the left forepaw, and
the latency to remove label from the right forepaw (in seconds) was
recorded.
Statistical analysis. Data are expressed as means  S.E.M. and were
analysed by one-way ANOVA. Individual differences were determined
by Tukey’s test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Brain infarction and oedema.
Infarct volume changes are shown in fig. 1. There was no significant change between the control and r-tPA-treated animals.
Compared to the ischaemic (control) or r-tPA-treated groups,
AA or the combination of AA and r-tPA significantly reduced
infarct volume (p < 0.001). Ascorbic acid alone or in combination with r-tPA also significantly decreased brain oedema compared to the control or r-tPA-treated animals (p < 0.001; fig. 2).
Brain permeability and levels of MMP-9.
Blood–brain barrier leakage was calculated by determining the
concentration of Evans blue (mg/g tissue) as shown in fig. 3.
There were no significant changes in BBB leakage or MMP-9
levels between ischaemic and r-tPA-treated animals. Ascorbic
acid alone or in combination with r-tPA significantly reduced
BBB disruption (p < 0.05; fig. 3.). Ascorbic acid alone
(p < 0.05) or in combination with r-tPA (p < 0.01) reduced
MMP-9 levels compared to the control or r-tPA-treated rats
when measured at 48 hr after stroke onset (fig. 4).

Discussion
There has been significant discussion in the literature showing
that r-tPA is safe and effective when given within 3–4.5 hr after
the onset of ischaemic stroke [6,24]. Conversely, the use of
r-tPA after this time-point leads to accumulation of high concentrations of free radicals which is harmful for neurons [25]. Our
results demonstrated that AA ameliorates the adverse affects of
late r-tPA therapy because the combination of treatments
decreased MMP-9 levels, BBB disruption and brain oedema.
AA alone or in combination with r-tPA also showed to be neuroprotective as assessed by decreased infarct volume. According

to these results, it appears that AA can be considered as a potential adjuvant therapeutic approach in the treatment of brain
ischaemia to resolve the limitations of using r-tPA.
Oxidative stress plays crucial roles in the pathogenesis of
cerebral ischaemia [6]. Excessive free-radical production during stroke increases the risk of BBB disruption which may
contribute to more serious consequences such as cerebral
oedema [26]. On the other hand, there are a number of reports
stating that the side effects of tPA can be reduced using antioxidant vitamins or edaravone as free-radical scavengers
[27,28]. Hence, it appears that AA may suppress oxidative
stress and the accumulation of free radicals and thereby inhibit
the side effects of r-tPA. Recently, Iwata et al. (2014) [15]
found that chronic AA supplementation inhibits apoptotic and
pro-inflammatory changes and attenuates brain injury and neurological deficits in STZ-induced diabetic rats.

Our results showed that the levels of MMP-9 and brain
oedema increased after the induction of permanent MCAO
and also after therapy with r-tPA. It has been reported that the
main reason for brain haemorrhage and oedema after receiving
r-tPA is related to the up-regulation of MMP-9 [17]. Matrix
metalloproteinases are involved in the pathogenesis of several
brain diseases that share common pathophysiological processes
such as BBB disruption, oxidative stress and inflammation
[16]. Oxidative stress was not directly studied in this report,
and this is a limitation of our study; however, there are significant correlations between oxidative stress and MMP-9 in both
stroke patients and animals [29,30]. In stroke patients, oxidative stress has been shown to have a significant correlation
with MMP-9 expression [29]. It has been shown that damage
caused by H2O2-induced oxidative stress can be reduced by
down-regulating the levels of MMP-9 [31]. Koken et al.
(2010) [32] have shown that long-term alcohol consumption
increases MMP-9 levels via oxidative stress. They concluded
that oxidative stress could be one of the mediators of the
expression of MMP-9. Therefore, as MMP-9 levels are
reduced in ischaemic animals treated with AA alone or AA in
combination with thrombolysis, it can be suggested that AA
may reduce oxidative stress in the current study; however, this
has yet to be demonstrated in the current animal model.
In addition to its antioxidant protection, AA participates in
numerous cellular functions [33]. Although AA circulates in
plasma in micromolar concentrations, it reaches millimolar
concentrations in most tissues. Neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) contain some of the highest AA concentrations of mammalian tissues. Ascorbic acid serves several
functions in the CNS, including peptide amidation, myelin
formation, synaptic potentiation and protection against glutamate toxicity [33]. NF-jB is a dimeric transcription factor
activated by reactive oxygen species [2], and it has been
shown that it up-regulates many inflammatory cytokines such
as MMP-9 [34]. Vitamin C may neutralize free radicals and
inhibit the NF-jB signalling pathway, thus reducing MMP-9
concentrations.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that
evaluated the use of AA on reducing the deleterious effects of
delayed r-tPA treatment in the permanent MCAO model.
However, in parallel with our results, it has been reported that
treatment using a form of dehydro AA significantly reduces
the damage caused by stroke in a cerebral ischaemia model
[35]. It has also been shown that dehydro AA can lead to
amelioration of altered antioxidant status and reduction of
oedema formation in a rat model of focal cerebral ischaemia
[36]. One may argue that AA may not penetrate the BBB, as
opposed to dehydro AA which does. However, BBB disruption after ischaemic attack can be exploited because neuroprotective drugs can reach the ischaemic area through the
damaged tissues [37]. Furthermore, expression and transport
activity of sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 after
stroke are increased, which results in a significant increase of
AA uptake into the brain after stroke [38].
In contrast to our findings and the above-mentioned studies,
it has been reported that the administration of vitamin C to

ischaemic stroke patients has not led to improvement of the
clinical and functional status of patients after 3 months [39].
The result of another study demonstrated that intravenous
treatment with a combination of the antioxidant AA and the
iron-chelating agent desferrioxamine is unable to protect
animal models from myocardial reperfusion injury [40]. The
reason why our findings and the other investigators are not in
parallel with the above report may be due to the fact that they
used a different tissue or doses of vitamin C but not AA.
Conclusion
Based on our data and those of other investigators, AA has
neuroprotective properties and reduces IBI. Moreover, it might
be possible to benefit from delayed r-tPA administration even
up to five hours after stroke when it is coadministered with
AA. Many studies are recommended to prove the efficacy of
administering acute AA to reduce the deleterious effects of
delayed r-tPA treatment. The initial data from this study suggest that AA may have beneficial effects on post-stroke treatment, and these studies should now be expanded to obtain
more statistically significant data and to explore the function
of AA in reducing the adverse effects of delayed tissue plasminogen activator in post-stroke situations.
